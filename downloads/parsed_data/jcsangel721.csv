"event","John & Maryam.  I'm soo incredibly happy for them.  They are so in love.  Tomorrow is their Wedding Shower, then in November, they get married.  Again.  Hehe.  I love John so much, I'm glad he's so happy.  I think about them, and listen to this song and wish that could be me.  Do you think that might be why I have been looking into Wedding Planning so much.  I know I'm gonna cry on their wedding day.  How can I do that?  I'm in the wedding!  Hehe.  I hope that wonderful day comes when I am walking down that aisle.  I'm sooo dreamy.  All I do is dream.  I think I should start to write all my dreams down on paper, then I can check them off as they happen.  I love everyone and I hope all their hopes and dreams come true, with love and life.  Muah, Faith"

"event","Fridays...they are fun because you always get to do something that night (most usually).  But they are followed by Saturdays, which for me usually mean working all day outside.  Boo Hiss.  I don't get paid on Saturdays.  Then come Sundays.  Yea, they're okay, but youth group sucks anymore and I just feel bad vibes whenever I go to church anymore.  I dunno why, I feel like I'm being looked down upon.  Then comes Mondays which are always busy and that just starts your week all over again.  So, in reality, are Fridays really all that great?"

"event","It's been 22 months.  Can you believe it?  I can't.  We are so happy now though.  It's good to get back to livejournal.  I had completely forgotten about it.  Anyways, Tim and I went and saw Pirates of the Carribean.  Super good.  If you haven't seen it, it's sooo good.  I didn't think I'd like it and it was really good.  Kind of like a Three Muskateers on a ship.  But yea, I'm gonna make this short because my eyes are about to fall out (haha -- anyone who saw the movie would get the funny of it).  So, out go the contacts and to the bed I go.  I love you, Timmy.  I love everyone.  Muah to all my friends; never leave me.

Love, Faith

P.S.  God bless all my friends tonight.  I love them all."

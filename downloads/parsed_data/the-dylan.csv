"event","I've been here about two weeks, embedded into the world of spain, and i gotta say I'm enjoying it throughly.  at first i was kinda lonely, missed everyone (as i still do) but now its like, I'm in fucking Spain.  The people are so nice, the drinks are cheap, and the party's are always hopping.  One thing that takes alot of getting used to is the lifestyle.  Dinner at 11 drinks at 12 home at 6, and thats the norm.  Not complaining but it takes alot of sleep to get back to normal after nights like that.

To everyone back home, i miss you all dearly and to those who are visiting please post dates so i can arrange properly.  

love you all"

"event","Its official,I will be leaving the great Community of Lee County on March 29th 2007.  I will be gone for at least a year, with no chance of return before that.  However if you are any where in Europe after that date, i would love to meet up with you somewhere.

Oh and the details.  I am going to be a student at the prestigious University of Salamanca, in Salamanca Spain.  Its about 4 hours west of Madrid by train.  The city is beautiful, as well i'll be living in a dorm 5 minutes from campus.  

I love you all so lets hang out before i leave."

"event","Before i begin i must warn you, my thoughts are lost in the explicable and my ideas and emotions might appear to be fragmented, however its just my current stream of consciousness.  So please just flow with it.

I must give thanks to my counterpart this evening, through conversation i have fortified my appreciation for life and all aspects of it.  I find it hard to try and express the mental state i am in.  Its bliss perhaps, with a hint of astonishment.

I must say i have never had such a fierce curiosity about life as i do now, i feel like a fire is burning inside me, and the only way to quench it is to think, deeply, and to learn as much as i can.  Its a feeling of ecstasy, I've never had such a thirst for knowledge as i do now.  I find my self reading literature and articles on philosophy in my free time, creating art, and most importantly discussing such basic concepts that are so influential to human wellness, that dissecting them and attempting to understand them while barely scratching the surface, creates a sort of childlike excitement.  

I feel like a small boy again, yet with an acceptance of life,  i am just excited about everything as well i am intensely curious, i feel that it is because i have left school, that my mind is free of the traditional idea of education, and now that such constricting methods of education are gone, i am free to learn the best way possible.

I never thought that graduating high school would be such a life altering event, but tonight i realize it really is.  Whether or not i want it to be or not it IS.

I've never felt so alive either so abuzz with the breath of life, that just waking up is a wondrous moment, for now each waking moment is pounding with excitement of life and what lays ahead.

Its such an overwhelmingly beautiful feeling i feel.  Each day is a breath of fresh air, in every sense.  As well simple things are more alive and have a greater impact on me now than ever before.  Music has always been an immensely important aspect of my life, however now it feels like more than that.  Music creates a sensation of a false reality now, its a intrigues feeling i must say, that music can trigger such a variety of emotions or serve to enhance an emotion.  As well i have been using music in a new way, to help me understand certain situations to use the emotion i feel, as a reminder to learn from said experience.  It helps me dissect my reality and extract the good, while examining the bad and why it is bad and how to make it better.  Music is so incredibly insightful.  Oh and another odd behavior change that just happened was my desire to dance, i used to feel so awkward dancing that the idea of it was just no fun, however now its so great, and i dont give a fuck who sees me, cause i can fucking dance real nice and i know it.

I gotta say though a lot of who i am right now, spiritually, emotionally, physically is because of chelsea and not through her words but the relationship we had, while gone now, her impact on my life is felt everyday.  You made me stronger and smarter and showed me a whole new way to perceive and live life.  For that I am eternally gratefully to you and the relationship we had.  It was a beautiful thing you taught me. 

I really wish i could pinpoint what it was that triggered this drastic change in my thought process, what happened that made me really stop and think, not about me or about other but about the universe and its impeccably gracefully way of working.  Its awe inspiring.

To address the burning question in the back of my mind and perhaps those of you reading, It wasn't the drugs.  I mean yeah they helped but it ultimately comes down to you and what you want out of life.  I do not mean to advocate drug use, but psychoactive drugs such as Mushrooms can have a very profound influence on your life, its just like i said though.  It all comes down to want you want, Grow up or Get Fucked up.  you decide.  then again there is the other approach to profound moments of introspective enlightenment, a more drastic way is through trauma perhaps the easier approach would be to just think everyday about life, Think about what is really important, far from the materialistic your thoughts should think about the priceless aspects of life, that can never break or wear down.  So do that for me and tell me what you hold truly important to you, and then i will share mine with you.

This feels good, expunging all my emotion into a written vessel for others to read and interpret as they wish,  witch brings me to another important detail in life.  Never be afraid of who you are, i speak from experience when i didn't know what i wanted.  I was just apart of the social machine that is life and i vied for acceptance while denying my self acceptance.  It hurts to much to hide your true self, its to depressing to live that way.  Please just Love your self and thats all you need to do.  i say this only because i am beginning to really appreciate the role self confidence has in wellness.

Its quite amazing to think about your life, i mean its almost unbelievable how much i matured in the last 8 months let alone 4 years.  That feeling of astonishment brings about such amazing hope in life, if i can become a better person in just 4 years, imagine what i can do with a lifetime.  Our potentials are limitless and its in that belief that i derive such enjoyment in life.

This is just the beginning, i haven't even began to scratch the surface yet.
stay tuned."

"event","i never thought that so much could of happened in 36 hours, and not just that main thing your thinking of but just like whoa.  A day and a half has never had such a crazy chain of events in my life.

Now its time to sleep, something i am lacking.

Oh and that sleep problem shit is solved so no worries there.  I've just been up for awhile dealing with some stuff."

"event","man if only time could stand still ya know, maybe not time its self but just the emotions and actions of those around.  Things just keep on changing and time is running out, i keep telling my self its just as good as before, but shit is really starting to get scary.  what will i do, how will i do it.  Perhaps these are questions everyone must ask but seriously its your own battle.

also whats the deal with everything, i know there is good times and bad times, but its the fucking holidays, yet in the last year i've never felt in such emotional turmoil as i do now.  

I'm overworked sleep deprived and just going nuts.  I might hide it well but seriously i'm going insane.

My sleep deprivation continues, i get irritable irrational insane.  the days i sleep good i am good.  the other days not so much.  i'm thinking about going to the doc, and i know you all want me to, but don't push me were all different and i gotta take this at my own pace.
Perhaps its another form of self destructive behavior i seem to undergo, if its not habitual drug use its not sleeping and working to much, even when i don't have to.

i could sleep tonight,  if only things had gone better.

i wanna disappear for days at a time, i might just start doing that."

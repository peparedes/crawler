better than my dad's

I wrote an entire strand of Frederick Douglass quasi-haiku and shared them with Ken and Jon once, way back in October. They were wasted on Jon who is a dipshit, but not on Ken, who is sweeet. I feel the need to revive the bad owrds my parents used when I was little subsequent to a trip to the Baltimore airport with my dad wherein we reflected on the 80s per my essay about him. And I feel somewhat cheated by the fact that I missed so much of them, although today things are going well and Im largely feel pretty satisfied with this place and time. 

That said, I am fighting the sweltering sense of my own mortality engendered by my reflections on my possibly HIVity. Not possible. They all say the excuses I keep citing mean nothing; they all being the public service and school authorities who assure me that any amount of conact with HIV cum could infect me and anyone could have it, fucking fat lot of good these helpful messages do me now. I guess if I had thought my life were at stake I might have been able to overcome the paralysis that came into play; however, had I attempted to struggle I would possibly have inccurred more voluminous blood & seman exchanges. No way of knowing now; note that hindsight is not always twenty twenty, in particular when you were barely conscious at the time (and when immediately after your eyes are crusted over with (hopefullynot AIDs-infected) seman. )

I have not heard of cum in your eye giving you aids. It was also barely any, and hopefully on the lid mostly. And I don't think there was other exchange involved. 

So let me say that in the interest of boltering my flagging spirits, this argument is so valid that Im *thankful* I woke when I did, since Im pretty sure he didnt have his unprotected way with me, which may not have been the case if I hadn't woke up and played along. 

Huzzah? 

Don't fuck girls when they're passing in and out of conciousness. How's that for a public service announcement? 

Hate!"

"event","actually updateable. cannot update due to recent strangeness o life. the thing I want to deconstruct and ponder is off limits til it is addressed with person in question. 

almost like I'm a grownup, that. 

will note, however, that my leprous OCD-inspired face problem seems of less significance to others than it is to me. 

I would like a girl friend. not in the hilary sense because in that sense I am supremely gifted. but in the smooshable sense. A girl who could be smooshed. A boy would work too, for some reason, however, I imagine a girl, or else Ben. I think the element here is Texas. I imagine it is not actually grown up to hold it against the state that things have gone awry for me there in this single area. I think I am getting better building a life which does not rest upon others of significance. 

Also: amazingly TIRED. Will probably go eat a bagel, though I just had breakfast a little bit ago, and drink all the coffee in the world."

"event","its funny how in this one way a person can be braver than you I mean he can be braver than me I mean he can tell every girl in his high school he wants her funny I think I was the one woman who ever told him. I guess that shouldn't have boded well. bt in this sense he is with someone and I am paralyzed to tell the person I am smitten with how smitten I am, to even ask the guy out to a movie. I don't know why. I just know I talk myself in and out of this six times a day. Im not pretty enough, Im a mess, my teeth are bad, Im not toned, I don't dress well -- I'm crazy. 
funny though, crazy I can work around. any flaw in who I am I think I can defend. I just dont want to deal with the fact that Im not well kept enough. 
god though. I like him a lot."

"event","I CANT WRITE
I want another tattoo and to be brilliant. as brilliant as I can convince other people I am when I'm grinning and bouncing and throwing energy that looks like light around, as opposed to self indulgent and all the things Im afraid I am. general dissatisfaction is way more annoying than palpable and destructive self-contempt. I wish I were well no, I dont, I dont want to do all the stuff I used to do and so I have a lot of empty Saturday nights. also: fuck joe. fuck him fuck him fuck him fuck him. 
see, Im not even angry. 
And I don't want to be as ugly as I am but I am tired right now of masking it. Im ugly and lame at times, also petty, and I have to say: why the fuck doesn't anyone adore me? I mean, in addition to all the ugliness theres a lot of other stuff too. Maybe not beautiful, but I mean, everyone's got ugliness. What the hell is wrong with me? 
Thats not really the ugly part. The ugly part is that I wish I were hanging out with Matt, but mostly right now because he acts like Im amazing when Im around him, and no one else really thinks that. Not even me, not really. I want to borrow his opinion of me and wear it like a hat. Or like Kyle's ass. 
I really should be doing work... 
so this dresden dolls song includes the lyrics ""can't you just do it for me,"" and its totally make me channel high school and Avon Grove. And maybes Im actually amazing and cool, because I was pretty cool when I was fifteen and I totally didn't see it, though certain other people did.
Not so much here. 
That guy needs to ASK me OUT already. 
Come on, that guy. 
Not that the larger issues at play with the crippling feelings of inadequecy would be solved by that. But really, I don't even think thats an issue. Honestly, I think Im pretty amazing, Im just afraid Im not, since pertinant people seem to... not agree? 
Ehhhhhh. This revision's not going to happen, is it? 
Not so much, no."

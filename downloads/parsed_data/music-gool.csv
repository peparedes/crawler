Yaaaaaayyyyyy. Christmas at Drew and Jennifer's. Fun. And guess what. I get to see Sierra! Yay! Happy is the turtle within me! I should tell her to get a greatestjournal. Then it'd be cool. Drew told me he's got all the big gifts, and so I need to tell him what small stuff I want. He said he might give me my present early. Asked me if I'd mind. Hell no! Hmm. What could it be? Damn, I wish I knew. Hmm. What am I going to get people for Christmas? Hmm. Something to ponder.

Fun, my mom made me cookies.

Silence! We have a new recliner. As beat up and uncomfortable the old one was, I like it better. The new one is tiny and the foot rest doesn't raise at all; it's really low to the ground. I don't like it. The arms and the back are too short. I liked the old one. It was big and cool and denim and I could curl up in it very comfortably, or I could sit back and my head would rest against it. With the new one, my head goes a little above it. Gah.

"event","I had a dream. I was at a concert, and I left my purse somewhere at the place where you first go in. When I got back to it, there was a note there saying I shouldn't leave my purse unattended. In one of my notepads there were some drawings. They were really good. Oh, and I remember one of the songs I heard at the show was ""Your New Aesthetic"" by Jimmy Eat World. It was a really cool dream.
I had another dream. I was in a house, with other people in there. It was like a haunted house. Well, actually, it's hard to describe this dream, because I know what it was like, but I can't explain it.
I had a dream the night before. I was in a town. It was kind of a.........like an old western Traverse Town. But kinda like Homer's hallucination when he ate the pepper at the Chili Cookoff. You know, with the coyote and the soulmate thing. Anyways, in part of it, I walk up to a door to a building. Some guy walks through it, and a guillotine blade comes down. Apparently the owners had put it in and didn't tell anyone about the change. So, every few seconds, it comes down. I walk away. Actually, the way the dream looked, it reminded me of the animation in Okage. A bit. In part of it, two of the guys i hang out with (I think one was Tim) battle. Kind of. Did you ever see Mad Max Thunderdome? How the people would watch two guys try to kill each other? Yeah. Except minus the Thunderdome. So, I was in the crowd, and each guy has a big thingy on wheels. Like a wheelbarrow, but really big and flat. One guy has a bunch of sacks of stuff on it. The other has a bunch of metal stuff. They shover the two thingies at each other. Basically, it's bloody gorey fight-to-the-death kinda thing. There was more to it than the moving thingies. Anyways, I can't watch, so I leave. I climb on top of this roof sorta thing. I wanted to go through one of the little windows (like the ones you can't go into in video games) but Jiffy was there and she was saying no, lets go this way. Then one of the guys comes, and he's painting the wall below us slime green. Then he starts painting it bright red. Ok, so this dream may not sound so bad. But it was really kinda freaky.

I couldn't remember them very well, sorry. Oh well. Anyways....once again, my weekend plans were fucked up. I slept all of Saturday, making it very hard indeed for me to answer the phone, and my mom, whenever she heard the phone ring, was probably playing minesweep on the computer and wanted to just get those last ten before getting up to answer the phone. Oh well. I did stay up until 4:30am watching volume 1 disc 2 of Futurama. Five episodes of fun. Then I watched two with audio commentary, but I was tired and went to sleep after that. I also watched Thumb Wars. And then I watched it with audio commentary. Hahahahahahahahhahahahahaha. ""Now touch your tongue to mine."" ""Why?"" ""To make it all official."" Umm..to make what official?"" ""You know. <i>All of it</i>. Uh. Nevermind. Let's go.""

Boys suck. Ok. Boys don't suck all the time. And not all boys. The only guy I can think of that's never done anything to piss me off is Casey. Yay for you, Casey. The perfect gentleman, if there ever was one. Well, as far as I can tell.

Mandi, I lloooovvvvveee you. Thanks for keeping me from totally losing control in Biology.

Hahahahahahahahaha. I watched ""Monty Python's The Meaning Of Life"". Definitely a guy movie. But very funny. Best was the end with the Grim Reaper."

I really wish my mom would get the computer fixed, so we could get a cd burner, so I could burn cds; and if we had a working computer, we would get internet, and I could also use cd-roms and play Riven and Myst and Grim Fandango and You Don't Know Jack and yeah. Except I really suck at Riven, Myst, and Grim Fandango. But I wanna play 'em soooooo much.

I would have gone to Jeremy's house on Saturday...but I didn't. No way to get there, I guess. And I never went to Alexa's house. Wow. Weekend plans just didn't pan out. I spent Saturday sleeping, sitting on a rock at the river watching/hating people and listening to <i>Spiritual Machines</i>, sitting in my room, and so on. Today I was ok. Woke up and watched tv. Saturday tv (for someone who doesn't get cool channels) really sucks. Sunday tv is gooder, because there's Seinfeld and stuff like that on Fox. Yay. I saw an episode of Seinfeld today that I'd never seen before, which was really cool because I've watched reruns of it all the time since it ended, and I of course watched it when it was still going.

And she doesn't like gore. But that's ok. We had fun with Eskimo Bill and Walter. Of course, we had to be careful not to lose Eskimo Bill's wheel. And yeah, and stuff, and she was really cool to hang out with. I didn't eat much; Thanksgiving food is not really the stuff for me. I had part of a roll, some mashed potatoes, and half of a tiny piece of pecan pie that had a lot of bourbon in it that hadn't been cooked out completely or whatever(I got a headache on the way home).

By the way, I've fiinnaaallllly fixed Eskimo Bill's loose wheel. Krazy glue is fun. Now he goes like the wind... Or just a little toy car without a broken wheel. I also found my string, so I now have a new little bracelet thingy, which I attached to my trapper, and I'm in the process of making a new one. What fun.

My pants don't fit me any more. I really need to get new one, since my current pants are too small. (Ha, this makes me happy. Except I can't wear them, because they're constantly about to fall off. Or could easily be pulled off(Don't even think about it).)

I was surprised by people's reactions to my ""high school is a puzzle"" thing. Usually my ideas come out sounding like shit.
You know that one survey where it said ""Name one thing you would change about yourself"", and I listed a bunch? Just one: my ADD. It ruins me.

Chris did really well at the Talent Show. I know I laughed. Hehe. Trucks. Mandi and Cori were awesome. Yay for all of you that were incredibly brave to go up there!

Acgh! It's really hot in here!
And yet my fingers are cold.
Oh my god! My mom made cookies, and they are sooo good! *drool*

Woo! I figured out the dungeon I was stuck on in Okage! But then I discovered I wasn't at a high enough level to beat the boss, so I have to level up in that little dungeon in Madril. Bummer. And I beat Kurt Zisa in Kingdom Hearts! But I'm still stuck on all the other hidden bosses. Stupid bosses... I should start playing Ratchet and Clank again. That game is pretty damn nifty.

My head hurt, my sinuses hurt, my throat hurt, my stomach hurt (but that's because I was hungry), all that good shit. Oh, and I was either freezing cold or boiling hot. Yeah. I feel a lot better.

ET: Rriigghhtt..whatever you say. [eats Clauss] Oops. [leaves]

[in a field of flowers, ET is taking Muffy for a walk]

M: [moves to use a bed of purple flowers as a restroom]

ET: No!

M: [growl] Why not?

ET: Those will become beautiful one day.

M: Umm..no.

ET: Yes.. Wht's wrong with flowers?

M: [barks; bites off ET's hand] Hmm flowers..they're ugly.

ET: Muffy that was my hand! Well, I'll grow one again sometime.

M: True.. I should have bitten your face off..maybe then you'd grow a prettier face.

ET: Well you know you're not that cute either..you drool on yourself all day.

M: [growls]

[leaves the meadow]

[back at Zoronine Industries Lab]

ET: [enters]

W: [notices ET} Where is Clauss?

ET: He fell in a deep hole when I was walking him home.

W: What do you mean? Why didn't you help him?

ET: He fell and umm drowned in mud.

W: What did you do to him?!

ET: Nothing he fell. Dur.

W: You're lying! What happened?!

ET: [points to stomach] Yummy!?

W: You ate him?! How could you?!

ET: Did he even serve a purpose?

W: He was my friend! [electric zappiness] I won't let you get away with killing my only friend!

ET: MWUAHAHAHA...friend you had no [dies]

[ET's words are cut short as Wilhelm kills him]

BECAUSE OF HIS FATHER'S HORRIBLE CRIME, WILHELM IS DRIVEN INSANE.

[in Zoronine Industries Lab]

Ina: [enters, being chased by Muffy] Aaaah!*

M: [jumps and attacks her] Ha!

W: [turns and attacks Ina] Must destroy!

I: Oh please no!

[Muffy and Wilhelm kill Ina]

M: Hello um I've seen you before; aren't you the professor's creation?

W: Yes. He is dead now. Did you suffer at his hand too?

M: I got his hand in my tummy. HAHA you're my buddy now. I've never had a buddy due to my drooling.

W: We...are friends?

M: My new buddy. Wanna go get some Burger King?

W: Yes. Yes I do.

SO, WILHELM AND MUFFY WENT ON TO BE GOOD FRIENDS. WILHELM REMAINED INSANE, AND MUFFY STAYED JUST THE WAY HE ALWAYS WAS.

<center>THE END</center>



*Ina was in the Zoronine Industries Lab because she was stealing stuff from it. Wilhelm killed her because he was psychotic or whatnot. Muffy killed her because he was a talking killer dog. Makes sense, no?

Yeah, towards the end we just wrote the conversation between our characters like, I'd write Wilhelm's line, and Alexa would write her character's response, and so it was like a real conversation or whatnot. This is pretty much completely unchanged, except for a bit of proofreading. Excellent, if I do say so myself. :)"

stupid motherfuckers who were smart enough to buy their tickets ahead of time, smart enough so that they didn't have to spend the rest of the night part bored and miserable as hell because they have so little to say to the people with them and part indifferent, and then go home and cry for a bit and then watch snl and then read until 5 am because reading and sleeping are the only ways to keep from thinking.

it didn't mean as much to any of you as it meant to me. yes, tim, i realize that it was your birthday and it must have really sucked to not be able to see Coheed and Cambria. but when i get depressed, music is the only fucking thing i care about. the best part of the entire night for me was getting ""Wiretap Scars"" by Sparta and the 30 Seconds to Mars cd. of course, those are two very excellent cds, and i'm glad i got them. oh yes, and the glow in the dark star from will. ooh. it glows. oh, and getting the black and glow-in-the-dark purple bracelets from hot topic. the guy at hot topic was really cool. i wish i'd been in more of a mood to be friendly. ok, so yeah, at the time i wasn't all that upset, but like i said to whitney, ""i'm going to be really depressed about this later."" and damn, was it true. i think i should've spent the day at the mall with alexa. if only i had known...

"event","ignore that last post. As far as I can remember, I was just being really overdramatic and depressed because I was quite certain I was going to fail again. It was really late, and I hadn't even started. But then I stayed up until 5:00am working, and then the next day I spent a few hours in the band hall after school working on the stuff, turning it all in late, but at least turning it in. I just felt really shitty about myself and my procrastination and laziness. Ordinary self-hatred, disappointment, unnecessary drama crap from me. Yeah, sorry about that. Me overreacting. ""I'm just..being stupid."" Dear lord, how many times in the past few months have I said that? Way too many times. I need to stop being stupid.

Edit: Oh yeah, and I don't know why I made such a big deal about being grounded. Both days I as grounded I was at my mom's work anyways. And I had Friday free to do what I pleased. More overreacting. One of the things I hate most about myself. In the moment, everything seems so extreme, and later I realize it just isn't, and I feel really stupid about how stupid I was."

"event","So, on Halloween, I went over to Alexa's house, and we messed around on the internet for a while. Then we walked over to Chris's house to get Chris, and then the tree of us walked around Llano, actually getting very little candy, and mostly just hanging out. That was lots of fun. Then Chris went home, and me and Alexa walked to the square. Alexa barked at people. She does the coolest bark. It sounds a hell of a lot like a real dog; like Ginger, actually. We walked across the bridge to the playsets in that park by the bridge and talked. Then we walked back across the bridge and sat on the base of that statue across from Stonewall on the square (where we had sat before) and just hung out. Patrick and Joey were walking back and forth in front of all the shops, and so Alexa and I walked over to them and I asked Patrick why they were walking back and forth. He said they were deciding what to do, since he has a job at the theater, and since they had taken all the toilet paper from the men's bathrooms at the school for toilet papering. He told me I should help them by getting all the toilet paper from the girls' bathrooms next year, and I said he needs only to remind me. So they walked off, and we walked back to Alexa's house, and then her dad gave me a ride home. Maybe it doesn't sound all that exciting, but it was probably the best Halloween I've ever had. Candy count: 2 tiny boxes of Nerds, a little box of Milkduds, a thing of Bottlecaps (which taste like little kid medicine), and a 3 Musketeers. And yeah, I think that's it.

On Saturday, I went to Chris's house and we just lay on his bed watching Comedy Central. Then he asked me if I'd go out with him. Then, with very little hesitation, I said yes. So, yay, I have a boyfriend. Yeah, I don't sound, or, erm, read very enthusiastic or happy, but I really am. Chris is cool. So, anyways, a little later Jeremy came over, and we watched the beginning of <i>The Godfather</i>, decided it wasn't very attention-holding, and watched <i>Waterworld</i> instead. Then my mom called, and then came and got me. Exciting, no? Oh yeah, and those little round chocolates were really weird. I think I did get the only good one.

So, today I went to Chris's house, and we lay on his bed and watched Comedy Central, and then we went to Mandi's house and hung out with her. Oh, the funness of it all. Best weekend since...last weekend, I guess. But it was great because otherwise, I would have been sitting around the house depressed.

Tim, I was going to apologize to you. I don't know why you're so defensive about this. No matter what you wish on me, I don't wish any badness on you. I just don't want you to go out of your way to piss me off. You know what, I am sorry for some of what I said. Yeah, I've been a bitch. But whatever. You weren't completely undeserving. But whatever, if this is what you believe you wish to be the end of our friendship, there's not a lot I can do. Have a good life, meet your soulmate, have all the kids you want, work in something you love to do, be surrounded by people you love that love you, hire as many guys as you want to rape and kill me. If you're ending this, then whatever happens to you, have fun (except for the sending guys to rape and kill me; I hope you don't do that).

Gah, I need to be doing my Biology. I will. Oh yes. You'll see. Ha. Man, I need to redye my hair pretty soon. It'll be fun... ""Whose Line Is It Anyway"" is so frickin awesome."

I drew a picture of myself. I sat on my bed in front of a mirror, and drew myself, sitting there on my bed, with my shelves behind me, drawing. Probably one of the best drawings of a person I've ever done. Unfortunately, I can't show it to you, because I happened to not be wearing a shirt or pants while I drew it, which I don't want people to see, and I'm unwilling to draw in clothes and fuck it up.

Gee, a toaster, that's an...interesting present for someone's 16th birthday... Yeah, that robot thingy violated me. A number of times. It tickled. <i>Thirteen Ghosts</i> was freaky. But cool. The part with the angered princess in the bathtub was cool. So was the part with the lawyer. <i>The Exorcist</i> was cool, but not really scary. <i>Scary Movie 2</i> was stupid, but I think I'm just dumb enough to have been really entertained. <i>Scream 2</i> and <i>Scream 3</i> were ok. Bad acting, weird plot, but ok. (And yes, I do like using italics, now that I've figured out how to. Yeah, it was oodles of funness.

Tim, when you go out with a girl, here's my advice: When she says she needs some time to herself, there's a very good chance it doesn't mean she hates you. Also, when you follow her around every single place she goes and wait for her outside the bathroom, well, dammit, that's going to either creep her out, piss her off, or both. Girls need space sometimes. It's natural. Also, you smell funny.

AND I found black nail polish (that wasn't special for Halloween and wasn't a crappy brand) again! Heh. So, yeah, I also got the pictures developed. The one of Mandi and Cori is great. I also like the one of Mandi and Jeremy on the band hall floor during lunch. And since Jeremy had asked for doubles, and since he was in the temple of Wal Mart, I gave him the pictures then. And yes, JR did manage to get into plenty of them. And there are actually some tolerable pictures of me in there. After the temple of the god of Wal-Mart, Wal Mart, my mom and I went to H-E-B (Ham Eating Balloons), and I got some Wooden Fun Stix! Yeah, popsicle sticks. But the package said Wooden Fun Stix, so...whatcha gonna do? Not much. Actually, Ham Eating Balloons is where I got the black nail polish. Whatever. Hmm... Oh yes, and I got strawberry-watermelon push pop. Heehee.

So, yeah. I was really depressed yesterday. Gah, I fell asleep at 2 am and woke up at 7 am today. Shit.

The most I've eaten all weekend is a burrito and a half. Half a burrito, that is. But then I couldn't eat any more. The only other food I ate this weekend...umm, some fritos. Five pixy stix. Maybe a snickers. Nutritious. I did have coffee this morning. Ha. Yay for me.

Ooooh, I listened to the cd ""Clarity"", Jimmy Eat World. I'd never really gotten into it before. But I listened to it. And I realized....that cd kicks so much ass! Oh yes! So, I guess basically what I've been doing recently is listening to the cds I either never really liked at first, or the cds I got tired of a while ago. Really not a bad idea. I haven't listened to The Strokes in ages. But I just did. Now it's ""Clarity"" again. Next... maybe ""Yourself or Someone Like You"", Matchbox 20. Haven't listened to it in ages, baby.

Tim, you asshole. Just because you're fucked doesn't mean you have to fuck up your friendships. I wish I knew better what's going on, so I could judge this better. Not that it's my place to judge. I don't know...

Abby, you didn't make me hate Tim. He and are still friends. You just made me lose all attraction to him, with your disgusting information that I didn't and will never need to know.

Gah. THe bell will toll in...4 minutes."

You know what I think? I think we should start a religion where Raine Maida is god. What did Christianity's god do for me? Well, I don't really know if he did anything or not. But Raine Maida creates incredible music that moves me more than any hymn or preacher ever could.

I have robot shirt now.

Biology was fun today. I wore Mandi's cool jacket. And I spent the entire time drawing on a little piece of paper with Chris. I drew monkeyface and handed it to him. He gave it a body. I gave it wings. And so forth. At some point I drew a flying pimp tree. Good times, man. Good stuff.

Maybe I've got some Viking in me. I am half Danish, after all.

Mandi, don't let the assholes of the world get you down. You are a fantastic person, one of the best I've ever met. You are so special (no, not like Kenny down the street who got hit in the head with a brick), and so many people love you. Remember that. Take some sparkle. A gift from me to you."

"event","Ok, so not this past weekend, but the weekend before that, I went up north to Alpena with the parents. First I went to work with my mom where I shredded paper all day. It wasn't too bad, just very monotonous which I won't complain about because it was easy and they were paying me $10/hour. After work, we left for the trek. It wasn't too bad just kinda long, another 5 hours I believe. Once we got up there, my dad got us a little lost. We were on the road which Cathy's house is on and which we were told the motel was on as well. Well we were going and going, and he decided that when it finally turned from a dirt road to a paved road, we needed to turn because he was looking at the GPS and thought that he knew where we needed to go based on that. Turned out we needed to continue down the paved part of the road...good job dad, lol.

Anyway, the rest of the weekend was ok. The next day, when it started to get really hot downriver, it was 65 and rainy all day up there. So that wasn't too much fun, but we made due, we just hung out in the pole barn which was all furnished super nicely. Took a drive over to my dad's cousin's house (I'm not sure what that makes our relation) with the rest of my aunts and everything. She had such an amazing house that look right over Hubbard lake, which there was a little issue there. Apparently Susie's (the cousin) best friend, who also happened to live in Riverview, was already on their way up and had called for the first time to say they were coming to visit when they were already halfway up. Well she hardly gets to see her cousins at all, and we had been expecting all of us to come for a while, but her best friend gave us some attitude for coming over and hanging out for less than an hour since they had arrived 15 minutes before us. Whatever. They eventually came to join us around our bonfire and our little party that we had going on. Taught my drunk aunts how to play spoons. THAT was a fun time XD. The next day it was really hot, and then we only visited for a little bit that day, and then all the aunts left to go gambling in the UP for a little bit before they had to leave a few days later, and then we had to get heading back since the parents had to go to work the next day still. Cathy's land was also really nice. The house was still just a trailer type thing, but still really nice, and the land is REALLY nice. The previous owner was starting to thin out the woods behind the house so it was entirely trees and there was a nice little lake and a creek that ran through it. 

Then the week, nothing all that special happened. Started a Batman movie marathon with Katie that has been on going, rather fun actually. Went to work again with mother on Thursday since I was going to a concert in sterling heights on friday which was just down the street from her, so she wanted to show me the way. Then on Friday I went to the Jason Mraz concert with Jess! It was really a ton of fun. We left really early so we could avoid the traffic of rush hour and everything, which in doing so we got there an hour and a half early. Yeah, my mom was telling me to prepare to be late for the concert which started at 7 if we left at 4:30....way to be wrong lol. Whatever, we had time to get a bite to eat and have the short lines for buying the merchandise. It was really nice though because it was free parking, although getting out was really obnoxious. Back to that later though.

So we walked around for a bit, listened to the singer they had playing out in the little merchandise area. Finally went inside and found our seats. The place was really nice, it had a roof but it was all open so it was very nature-esque which was very fitting for a Jason Mraz concert we thought. The opening band, K9, was pretty good. He was from Swahili and was kinda telling his story and had some really good songs although they were a bit rap-like at times. The next band was REALLY good, G love and special sauce. Very very cool indeed. Then it was time for Mr. Mraz and it was SOOOOOOOO awesome! Like he was so good, his voice was just like on the CD, which often isn't the case because singers normally aren't extraordinarily good on their own so they often need some adjusting in the recording room. Not the case here by any means, SO good. Ugh, such an outstanding artist, really, truly. 

Afterwards, the parking lot was a mess. It was a gravel parking lot, so there wasn't really any official rows or anything like that (people were directed where to park by attendants, so it wasn't just a free for all). But like the front rows of the parking lot didn't lead to the main drag to get to the road, which is where a lot of people go because that's how things normally go. So there was a lot of confusion and waiting a while and people not following the courtesy rule of you go, I go, you go, etc., which made it quite a bit annoying. After that the ride back was a breeze. Although I did go the wrong way on I-96 but I noticed it pretty quickly afterward and then flipped around and we were set. It was a really good time. 

On Sunday, we had the family birthday party for the summer birthdays with Alex thrown in since he's been gone and is leaving very soon. Overall it was fine, but Faye started to annoy the crap out of me. She started really getting on me about cutting my hair, like obnoxiously this time. She's brought it up before and I've always politely declined, but this time polite wasn't working. She was the one that started in on it out of the blue, we weren't even talking about hair and she just turned to me and commented about how I looked like I needed a haircut and that she could do it. I politely skimmed over her offer and explained how I was waiting kinda until the last minute before I leave for college so that I wouldn't have to come home that early. So she asked when I was leaving and I told her and that it was a Tuesday, and she came in with ""oh well I work on Mondays so I can cut your hair the day before you go so that works out."" So I was trying to do the Oh no that's ok but...and then some reason that would excuse me somehow, but I couldn't think of anything really fast enough. So she turns to Jordan and is like ""Oh he doesn't want me to cut his hair, he REALLY likes his hairstylist already and their friends"" kinda sarcastic like. And then she started getting all into how she has some really high esteemed clientele like Jeff Daniel's son. It was just really annoying.

Ok, so now the future, lol. We are finally all ready for our camping trip tomorrow. We've got the cars all packed up, and we're all set to go. I'm riding down with Sam, Ash and Roman are driving together, and Ben and Elliott in Ben's car. It should be pretty fun, although there's chances of rain all day Thursday and some of the day Friday. If that does happen, we've got some ideas for indoor activities in the surrounding areas. I really hope it's a good time :-D"

"event","It's been a fun past couple of days. Um, I went and bought a fridge for the dorm room. It was a kickass deal at target for 3.5 cubic feet for only $94, originally for $155 or something like that. But anyway, we go to one target at like 2 and that store was already out of it. So they called another store and they said they only had 3 left and they couldn't hold them for anyone because they were selling so fast. And the sale had only begun that day. In fact, the first store we went to hadn't even set up a display or put up anything telling of the sale that was going on. But we got it! And Wes actually got a futon for us, and it was only $50. So our room is mostly furnished, just need a tv, cuz I guess Robb is getting a microwave. 

Oh right! I found out my roommates for next year. One is Robb Morford from Alpena and the other is Thomas Bohn from Seville, Ohio. I haven't gotten ahold of Thomas at all, but Robb seems pretty cool, and apparently a tall guy at 6'2"". 

Joe left yesterday. He was supposed to leave on Sunday but he didn't for some reason, but anyway I was all kinds of goodbye to him and he's like yeah I'm not leaving till tomorrow. So I invited him to wallyball but he didn't end up going to that. So then I actually said goodbye for reals when he had left. He seemed appreciative. I really am going to miss him. Although he said he'll still text and whatnot, but then again I'm always the one who texts him first anyhow, but at least he'll still respond so he says. Apparently he told Katie at one point that he sometimes thinks I take him too seriously and don't realize he's only joking... I'll have to ask him about that once he's settled a bit more, and maybe when he gets more texts since he's running out. 

Today I saw The Ugly Truth with Ash, Roman, and Meesh. It was really good, I'm a big fan. I mean it had Gerard Butler in it! AND a flash of a side penis of another hot man, good stuff right there :-P I got a ""free movie ticket"" from the whole thing though. The show was supposed to start at 11:30 but I guess they were having problems with that projector so they asked us to be patient. Well around 11:50 they said that they weren't going to be able to fix in a timely manner at all, so we could either see another movie there (Ugly Truth was playing at 12:30 in a different theater) or get a refund for that movie, and on top of that we got a voucher for a free movie for any movie at any time valid for 3 months. Pretty good for only a $4 movie. 

I got carded though! It's a rated R movie and they asked to see my ID when I was buying it and I was just so confused that I pulled out my college ID and the cashier was like ""Oh I meant your state ID, but I guess that works since it shows you go to college."" I'm almost 19, and apparently I need an ID to prove that I'm over 16...."

"event","Yesterday was pretty fun. Adam had tried to get me to hang out with him the day before, but I wasn't really feeling it a superb amount, so I kind of lied to him to get him off my back. He still wanted to hang out then yesterday, so I decided what the hell. He picked me up and then we went back over to his house and watched Transformers 1 in his basement. It was pretty good, some of the lines were just sooo cheesy and just a little bit too much for me, but it was cool. Then we played some wii in which I did terribly of course. After that we then went to the movies to see Transformers 2. That one was definitely all about the action, but not really in a good way I would say. Once they got into Egypt, it was all just fighting and explosions and robots. Honestly, I didn't realize what was really going on at all, couldn't recognize which robot was on which side, and couldn't really process any of it. Whatever, it was only $5 and Adam bought the pop and popcorn. After that he dropped me back off at home.

Then Katie and I decided to talk a walk around for a little bit. We kinda encountered a creeper of a man though along the way. He had turned down Ray street and we had as well because we were gonna stop by the park there. Well this guy decided he was gonna cut through the park to go to Speedway and kept looking back towards us, but it kinda freaked us a bit so we decided to walk down to sibley and round the corner to give him time to go in and get his stuff and hopefully leave so we could cut back and hang out at the park. Well there are some other kids on the play ground at that point so we were already kinda no, but then we saw this guy sitting there at the picnic table. So we just avoided the park altogether and walked back down to Hale along Fort. Well of course as we start going down Hale, this guy had already started walking back down Ray and then walked behind us the way he came before down Hale with us. Just a bit creepy right?

Anyway, we came back to my house and hung out here for a while and then went over to Katie's house for a sleepover. It was pretty fun, stayed up pretty late just chatting and watched Watchmen. It was good, but I was a little bit disinterested in all honesty. We had started it late and I knew it was a long movie and I was already tired, and also Katie was talking to me during it a little bit as well. I also just had a feeling that I was missing a lot of things that were being said and I just fell behind. It also could have been just the style of movie it was too. I know some movies do that where all the characters will make references to things they're already aware of but the audience doesn't know yet, and it takes a while for all these things to be explained but not really in such an obvious way. So you kinda have to keep taking this info in and then applying it to make sense to the first things shown, and it's just all confusing for me, especially in a tired state. Woke up this morning and then watched When Harry Met Sally While Katie was taking a shower. Also a very good movie which I hadn't seen before."

"event","I've enjoyed the past two lazy days. lol, I know that most of my other days have been lazy as well, but I haven't had one in a while this past week. But anyway, not too much has really happened. 

I did get my memory card and adapter for my phone finally. The way they packaged it, I thought I almost bought only a memory card again and would have been pissed, but they had it in a separate envelope in the package. I'm pretty sure they don't actually sell the adapter with anything or even by itself, because I didn't see it sold that way anywhere and they didn't send it in any sort of packaging at all, and this was a reputable site not just some random guy selling stuff. Also almost got very pissed off because it doesn't fit into my computer's port by itself. However, as luck would have it, I still have the adapter for my camera's memory card to computer adapter which also fits and works for this adapter. So I just have to put my memory card into an adapter, then put that into an adapter, and then put that into my computer for it to work, but it works all the same so I won't complain! lol. Funny enough though, from where it was made, it goes China, Japan, China, Malaysia. It's all over asia! haha.

Um, really that's it for now. I think I shall say goodbye then. Goodbye!"

"event","So today was finally the day for me to babysit. It actually wasn't too bad at all. In all honesty, the day went by really quickly up until like 3. Then it kinda dragged on forever. But let's see, got there at 9 and Ethan was taking a nap already so I only had Elliot for a little bit at the beginning. After a little bit Ethan was up, and I played with him for a bit while Elliot watched tv. A little later we went to the Tot Lot riding our bikes, or rather I rode Faye's bike with the baby seat. I had to get a back pack and fill it with water and juice and snacks and everything and changed Ethan into long sleeves and pants (because it was cold when I came. Of course it was hot by the time we left, *sigh*) and then we were off. Unfortunately, I didn't realize until we got to the park that I had forgotten to put shoes on Ethan, lol. My bad. But we rode back home real quick, put the shoes on, then went back to the park again.

Of course, as my luck would have it, the first slide I went down had a pool of water at the bottom that I didn't realize was there until my ass was soaked. Anyway played there for quite some time, had our little snack and everything and played on the swings and everything. Went back and had a little bit of lunch. Haha, interesting thing happened with that one. I made chicken nuggets in the oven. Well I preheated it without looking inside cuz I'm used to ours always being empty unless it's in use. Turns out there was a pot full of something, like oil or grease or something in it. By the time I realized it, it was obviously very hot and sparking a bit for some reason. Well one of these sparks hit my oven mitt and definitely set it a tiny bit on fire, so there's a little bit of it that's now charred a bit, heh heh. But Ethan ate a little bit then went down for a nap for a while and then Elliot and I went and watched High School Musical 3 in his room. 

Ethan woke up during that so my focus went back to him obviously. Tried to play with Ethan in Elliot's room while Elliot was considering watching HSM3 again, but he ended up wanting me to read to him a little bit. That proved to be a little more of a challenge actually because there wasn't a lot the Ethan was interested in playing with in Elliot's room except the other library books which only would have lead to destruction. So I was trying to keep him occupied while I actually read to Elliot. Even then Elliot seemed to be getting a little bored, so he went back out to the living room to watch tv. I brought Ethan back out there and gave him some snacks and that was pretty much all that we did. Faye came home around 6:15ish and then talked for a little bit and I was home $45 richer lol.

I am free for Friday though. Apparently Ester is free now and can and wants to take them. Of course Faye gave me the option to still do it, but I declined. It wasn't really bad at all, but I really feel like Elliot was super bored the last few hours and I do feel bad, and I think Elliot would know that he would be bored again if I babysat again so soon. I would do it again though."

"event","So I went over Faye's today to do that whole thing. It wasn't too bad, just lasted a long time, 5 hours in all. Most of the day wasn't really needed and wasn't about preparing me for tomorrow, but that was to be expected anyway. She did treat me to lunch at taco bell though which was nice. Pretty much she showed me how to work the baby gate and the high chair, where all the changing supplies were, how to open the crib, where the food is and what they can and will eat, all that stuff. It seems like it'll be pretty easy. I know I say that now, but I know that may easily change lol, especially when it's gonna be for like 9 hours. 

In other news, I came out to Faye. She asked me about it directly, and I've decided that I'm not gonna lie about it ever, unless it's inappropriate like if my students ask. She said that she heard at the party or something from the other side of a door, Jason talking about some Eric being gay or possibly being gay type thing. She said that she thought he might have been talking to Jeff or something, but she can't be sure about that and that it very well could have been Jamie, who already knows. I told my mom about it, and she wasn't very happy with me at first, but what can you do. I started saying you know I'm not gonna lie about it, and while I was saying that it kinda sounded like she was in the middle of saying I should have lied about it, but I think she got the message that I am not going to lie about it, especially to family. And yes I know that she's just afraid that our more conservative parts of the family, which is most of them, do not agree with or like homosexuality at all and may treat me differently because of it. I know it's the best of intentions, but it's who I am and I'm not gonna lie about it, they will just have to deal with it or I'll have to deal without them. Faye did say that she won't say anything since I said that I really don't want to tell people but she doesn't have to like take it to the grave. We'll see if she holds to that, but if it gets out, it gets out."

"event","Not too much happened today. Got up and took a shower when my parents called and said they were going to Denny's after church with my grandma. So I met them up there and had a nice lunch. My grandma had been complaining about being able to smell gas in her car, so we took a look at it afterwards. We looked underneath and saw that there was something that very well could have come from her car, so we had her back it up so we could actually look at it, which caused something else to splash down, which we just assumed was antifreeze or something. So we were sitting there discussing what it could be and all that, and I just figure what the hell, let's see if we can actually see her car dripping something. It was like pouring down from her car, and it did smell like gas or something with gas in it. But yeah, so we just had her pull it into Mastertech which is right next door so it was fine. Definitely had a bit of an ""Oh shit! Get out of the car grandma and run!"" haha. And yeah, dumbass dad was like, let's see if it's gas by trying to light it on fire! When there is clearly a trail to the car which still has grandma in it with the engine running....

Anyway, nothing really happened with that, just a bit of a scare. It won't be looked at until tomorrow to see how much it'll be to fix and what actually is wrong with it. Anyway, after that, I went over to Anne's again and worked some more on her landscaping. It was easier this time than last time, although still took a while. I had to go back and dig the barrier a little deeper, which was easier this time since it was in the section that Anne had already taken the grass off of, so it was just moving loose soil. Then I had to remove the rest of the grass from around the pool. After that she fed us and we hung out for a bit talking with her and a friend of hers. I'll have to go back at least once more for this project once she gets the mulch or stones or whatever she decides to fill the space with. She said she's going to pay me more, but she really doesn't need to, nor really should she since I only worked for like 3 hours both days and she paid me $100, so that's like $13 dollars and hour right there. 

Tomorrow is the orientation meeting if you will, over Faye's for my babysitting this week. Should be real fun..."

"event","Woke up at 5:30 so I could shower and eat and leave by 6:30 for Detroit. Driving and everything was fine, except I forgot my sun glasses so the morning sun was a bitch. Get to Cobo at about 7, half an hour early so that's good. Walk in for my Michigan Test for Teacher Certification Basic Skills test and there's this big line that wasn't really moving at all, so I was kinda freaking out since they said that if you arrive after the testing starts you may not be allowed in. Well I didn't realize that testing didn't start until 8 and that the 7:30 reporting time was when they started the checking of ID's and everything. 

So we all go down to the basement finally and they tell us to find our seat based on our seat number on our admission ticket and they had number brackets to give you a general idea of where to go. Well they were still really dumb with this whole thing, because the numbers ran all the way from left to right over the entire room, which clearly had 3 separate sections to it. So I'm going back and forth in the middle section because my seat was supposed to be 2 away, and I thought it might continue across so I follow it across but it jumps down like 200 numbers, so that can't be right. Well after having to ask one of the helper guys, I realized that the rows didn't line up very well across the sections, so I was just one row back from where I had looked before -.- 

Once you found your seat, your ATAs (never found out what that meant, but the helper people for your section) were supposed to come over to you to check your IDs that you brought. As people were still coming in and everything, they told us to raise our hands if we hadn't been checked yet. Well there was like a group of like 6 or 7 of us in our little section that were raising our hands for like 20 minutes no joke. And only YOUR ATA could check your ID, not just any of them. We didn't realize this right away which added to the frustration because the section ended a row in front of us who had their IDs checked pretty quickly, and then the section that ended like 3 rows behind us got checked quickly too. Our little section was the last ones to get our IDs checked because our ATA was really slow or something. The main proctor had to give him attitude since we were running late. 

So anyway, we finally get our test and I start working. I realized from the front cover of our test booklets that the girl sharing the table with me was taking the exact same test, Basic Skills test form A. It's like, that's great planning to make sure nobody cheats, since all this stuff is determined by computer in advance. Whatever, I wasn't going to cheat and I didn't notice the other girl even looking over at all. But yeah, we started the test, the reading section was pretty easy although some of the questions definitely gave me a ""huh?"" moment, which me and the girl stayed pretty much at the same pace for that. Then I got to the math section and I just blew right through that, it really felt incredible, lol. Then I did the writing section which my prompt was really easy. It was something along the lines of ""everybody gets advice. Tell of some advice you've received and how your life has improved because of it"" or something like that, and it was meant to be an essay to be read by a journalism professor. So it was really easy. I actually filled two full pages and then like a quarter or something. Funny enough though, once I finished my writing section and therefore was done, the girl next to me was only finishing up the math section hehe. So then I handed in my work and headed back home.

I was only there for a couple minutes when it was time to go pick up some of the stuff for Mike's retirement party and pick up grandma and everything. So no rest for me lol. But yeah, did the running and we get a call from Barb saying that Mike's already there and we don't have to worry about being late type thing, but he still only thinks it's a family BBQ and not a surprise party for him yet. So we get there and we have to hide our car a bit since it's full of balloons and the cake and everything and Jamie was gonna try to get him to leave for the store in a few minutes. So I guess they finally leave and we all try to hurry to get everything set up, all the food and the decorations and everything. It definitely was getting a little stressful with trying to do it all so fast and people having different ideas and trying to say which one was the one we should/needed to do. But it all worked out, and Mike was genuinely surprised, so that was nice. Got to really play with the cousins a bit more today than I normally do which is always fun. I am now babysitting both Tuesday and Friday now, since Emily can't do Friday cuz she already has another gig, and I already said I'd take Tuesday so I don't want to back down on that one I guess. I may call in my resources though for Tuesday in case I get bored or something in the middle of the day ;-) haha!

After that whole party, I was finally able to take a nap for a while. Then I got up and went over Roman's house for a camping meeting to make sure who's bringing what major supplies and everything and make sure we have everything covered there, and then to figure out all the food that we need to get. I'm really getting excited for it all though, should be a lot of fun! After that, we went up to Sonic and then came back to his house and watched Knowing. It was actually pretty good, although the second major accident shouldn't have been that severe, physically speaking lol. I was surprised at how graphic those scenes were though, I mean I've seen a lot worse, but they were pretty long and did some POVs that showed people really getting smacked and smashed and everything. And I didn't like how quickly he just picked up this whole meaning behind the numbers and how obsessive he got with it right away. Still good overall though. And very interesting, especially the ending. Who'd have thought that you could actually tie in science, aliens, and religion...."

"event","Yesterday was pretty fun. Went and saw Harry Potter with Kaylyn and then went to lunch afterwards. Kaylyn was none too pleased with the movie at all, but pretty much that was just because of the ending kinda being open-ended. Lol, I was ok with that because it was going into the last book. The only complaints I had was that it shouldn't have been called Half-Blood Prince the way it was done haha. Just because they made two references to it and then they revealed who it was at the end of the movie. The book was focused on it much more and had more speculation and concern about who it was. The other thing is that I thought Dumbledore got a lot weaker and closer to death because of the cave scene, but after it was over he seemed like everything was pretty much ok. And I thought there was more fighting with everyone in that part of the story, but I could be wrong on that one. They did add one big thing to the movie (I think, I'm pretty sure it wasn't in the book but I can't be entirely sure) that might be a bit of a spoiler so I won't say it. 

Later that night was guys night over at Joe's. That was pretty fun, but I will admit I expected more from it. I mean it was great don't get me wrong, but we came and started Fanboys right away (which I thought was hilarious btw, even if I didn't get all of the references lol) and then watched the special features and then we had to leave. I can understand cuz it was an early morning cuz they're going tubing today and everything. And I love Sam, I do, but she said that she was gonna come over around 10 but she'd stay out of the way. Well we all left by like 10:30 and she came out quarter after instead and Joe told her right away that we were almost done. But she came in and was trying to pack and everything cuz she was staying the night there to make it easier for them, but she was in the other room and was asking where things were and if Joe had packed this and that. It was just a little annoying since we were still watching stuff not just sitting around talking at that point, and she knew we were only going to be a little bit longer, and she HAD said that she would stay out of the way. Didn't exactly happen, but it was only for like 15 minutes so not horrible. We are planning another one before Joe leaves with a Star Wars theme of stuff like Star Wars Robot Chicken and the Family Guy Star Wars and something else too, but it should be fun all the same :-) And it was nice to hang out with Derek as well, I don't do that very often."

"event","Today was my step-grandma's 80th birthday. We wanted to surprise her by having dessert at my house with all the family already there for her and also letting her talk to and see Alex via Skype. I spent most of the day cleaning the house, making sure it was relatively neat and clean and whatnot. Mom came home around 5 to be able to set up the house for the party and get her gift ready for her (my other grandma's old chair that she's always liked). 

Anyway, had the family all come over at 6ish and gave Mary a nice surprise. Let everyone talk to Alex for a bit and then had cake and ice cream ""cake"" (it was all ice cream, no cake. So it was just ice cream in the shape of cake, wtf) and just generally chitchatted and everything. Most of the family was leaving by 7:30, 8ish, but my one cousin was coming late cuz she was just getting off of work in Dexter at 6. So she came kinda as everyone was getting ready to leave and had her cake and everything but then kinda just stayed at chatted until 10, kinda because she didn't want to go back home because I guess Mike, her husband, has been annoying her recently. 

But anyway during her stay here, she kinda talked me into babysitting next Tuesday. I've never really babysat alone before, but not that big of a deal, it's a 4 year old and a 14 month old. The only thing though is that it'll be for all day pretty much, like 9-7 or something like that. Idk, I'm a bit nervous about it mostly because I'm not so great at keeping little kids amused for long periods of time lol. I can muddle through this time for sure, but I'm afraid she might make me her go to babysitter type thing while I'm home, and I'm not gonna want to do this twice a week for the rest of summer or whatever. The reason why she needs the sitter is because Mike is a trucker so he's gone all day and she has her job in Dexter like three times a week all day long. And I mean I know they aren't very well off financially and I've never babysat before so I don't know normal rates, so I kinda let her decide how much to pay me and we decided about $5 an hour. So it's not horrible, but not all that great at the same time, especially since the 4 year old is very active. *sigh* We'll just see about that one.

On another note, got a copy of the police report for my case. Kind of unfortunately, it doesn't appear that the police report was botched at all. I kind of wanted it to be so I could have a reason as to why nothing happened with it, but now it just really seems like the justice system is flawed. The only thing I have against the cop is that his investigation was focused on Logan and not the other two guys, granted he had no information other than their names, but you'd think they'd be able to find an address/number for them with the police resources at their disposal. But the report was pretty thorough actually, but for whatever reason the prosecutor's office decided that it could not establish that Logan or any of the suspects OR anybody took our possessions. That last part's the kicker, apparently it just seems like our items were misplaced according to them. I can understand maybe not issues the warrant for the larceny, but there was clear proof in the report that showed that she committed non-forceful breaking and entering, which is still a felony charge. Whatever, my mom's going to call at some point to figure out further reasoning behind their denial of the warrant. 


Tomorrow night is HP6 and then Guys Night...should be fun! :-)"

"event","So I did the math, and my last page of entries averages around 4 paragraphs long, and knowing how I can ramble on, those are normally very long paragraphs. In order to try to cut down on that, since I'm sure no one reads them in part because of their massiveness, I will try to update every day or every other day.

I didn't really do much today, HAHA! Yes, that might be how a lot of these updates go. But I woke up and decided that I really wanted to go to the premier of Harry Potter tonight, so I started texting people and whatnot to see who I could go with, since it's no fun to go alone. But a lot of people that were going had gotten their tickets a while in advance so they were in like theater 1 or 11, obviously sold out on the day of. I started talking to Kaylyn and she said she would like to go a few days later, so we decided to go on Thursday at 11:50AM so that way our tickets were only $4 each.

Also decided to run up to the library since my one book (that I still never read after checking it out twice) was due tomorrow. And since there was that book list on Facebook and Ashley Burton had suggested that I reread the Giver now that I'm more mature and whatnot and can pick up on more out of it now. Should be interesting for sure."

"event","So my dad's a total ass-hat. I've known this for sometime, but it just takes the cake tonight it seems. We're having a ""surprise"" party for my step-grandma's 80th birthday and we were having Alex call on Skype if he could, since they really haven't talked to him since he's left. Well his place in Honduras doesn't have wireless internet so he can't Skype from home. However he is by a Pizza Hut which has WiFi so he's gonna try to do that. Well the party starts at 6 on Wednesday, however it's not working out too well to be a surprise type thing. I guess people are coming over at six and so are my grandparents. And I guess there are issues with Alex being able to call on time. I'm not sure what the issues are there, but he can't sit at Pizza Hut all day, so I'm guessing that he only has a limited time in which he can get to Pizza Hut, but the ending time only depends on courtesy of not staying at Pizza Hut all day. But anyway, his initial ""best he can do"" would be to call at 5:30, which obviously doesn't work really at all, so my mom was trying to get him to call at 6 then, which still isn't ideal at all really. 

But as we, or should I say my dad and my mom according to him, were talking, ass-hat started to get a little bit snotty or whatever and I didn't appreciate it and I know mom wasn't either. So I said why don't you calm down type thing, and he didn't really say anything. He started going back and forth saying why doesn't Alex call later and my mom's trying to explain he really can't he's running into problems, ""but why not?"", well she doesn't know but he keeps asking like that even though she can't get an immediate answer on that. Anyway, so I ask him to calm down again cuz he's getting all upset for no real reason. Finally he turns to me and pulls the same old shit with the ""I am talking to your mother stay out of this, if you don't like us arguing you are free to leave."" Well I throw back that mom doesn't like him arguing either, since she kept agreeing whenever I asked for him to cool down. And then he started going in circles, saying that it doesn't matter how I feel if they wanna argue, then I'd say that mom didn't want to argue either, then he'd say that well he wanted to argue and that's all that mattered and I would come back with he's arguing over something that doesn't need to be argued over, but that's for him and mom to decided, but mom thinks so too, ok so I wanted to argue about it, etc, etc. 

I was surprised though because I did get him to shut up though. I can't remember what lead up to it, but I kept saying that he's the only one that ever wants to argue and that he's always arguing over small things that don't need to be ""argued"" over but can just be talked about. And as I was finishing up he was saying something about how he was done trying to talk over me, and then he just stopped talking! It was kinda fantastic really. I mean, I wasn't surprised that he stopped talking, but he stopped talking and never once repeatedly muttered his feelings and his opinions over and over again like he normally does."

"event","I've been kinda meh lately. Friday I got into another blow out with Katie. She came back from her camping trip and we had hung out and things seemed to be fine. She kinda brought up her Sam a few times and I didn't make a fuss and just kinda let the subject roll over. She had told me the day before she had seen her first penis or something, so I brought it up when she messaged me on Friday. When she said that, I had thought that Sam had sent her a picture or something, which I would have been ok with. Turns out, she had webcam-ed with him. When I heard that, I couldn't take it, so I asked her not to talk to me about him at all, seeing as how she had asked me not to talk to her about my Sam because she was tired of hearing about that from my end when I was doing things against her advice. Well she wasn't happy with me and kept calling me hypocrite and everything since I've cybered with people and trade pics with people and all that. And she kept insisting that I didn't have the right to ask her to stop talking about him because it was a different situation than with my Sam and that mine was worse obviously. Anyway, spelt out the arguments I had from the last entry and everything, she kept saying that she's smarter than the girls that do the same thing and end up raped and all that, and that she wasn't in essence having sex with this guy. I was getting incredibly pissed off and it got to the point where there were ""never talk to me agains"" being thrown around. 

Eventually we just started fighting more in general than about the issues at hand kinda type thing. She told me that we were ""more of fun friends than best friends"" which totally threw me for a loop. I've legitimately thought of her as a best friend for a while now, and we've told each other that many times, including her telling me that unprompted on Monday when we last hung out. Well that pissed me off as well, and she said that how can I be surprised when our friendship has obviously been rocky for some time now. Once again, news to me. I knew we had some problems when I first went off to college and in the middle of it as well, but I thought we had honestly gone totally past that since we've been fine since then, except for a few weeks ago. But she said that we have different definitions of healthy relationships, which was her admitting that she's been holding back things from me for a while now. Which funny enough, she tried to accuse me of holding stuff back from her during the argument as well, which I refuted. As I was getting super pissed off since we were pretty much ending our friendship, she made some comment about how she's not upset but actually rather calm. Totally made me feel like she couldn't care less if I was in her life or not. 

I talked to Joe about it afterwards while I DDRed for 2 hours. He was really trying to help which was nice, especially since he helped me validate some of my viewpoints. Jokingly he said katie could come to guys night like she wanted if she and I made up. I texted her of this offer on Saturday, but left out the making up part since I assumed she wouldn't respond anyway. She never did, so I texted her again today saying I would tell Joe she declined, to which she said that would be childish since she never declined. According to her, she had been talking to Joe about it and was considering it but needed more details and whatnot. I don't know if I want her to go. I mean first off, it is guys night. And second off, she doesn't really hang around with any of the attendees, she's friends and friendly towards them, but she hardly ever hangs out with them. And third, I really do think it's gonna be awkward because of this whole thing, like guys night was originally my plan and gonna be a fun stress-relieving time, and also to hang out with Joe specifically, and now it very likely is gonna be awkward and stressful for me. 

Anyway, apart from Katie drama, Saturday I drove out to Detroit with my mother to make sure that I knew where I was going for my Teaching Test next weekend. We then drove out to Bennihanna's for lunch to see the new layout and everything. It looks really cool I think, a nice infusion of modern and traditional I would say. I went out to a party at Chris Stergalas's house that night as well. It was pretty fun, although I had to kinda watch out when we played a drinking game right off that bat and my first drink was waaaaaay too strong even just for sipping. But it turned out ok once I weakened it considerably. Still ended up drinking too much though, moreso just not stopping very early in the night, everyone else had kinda sobered up a bit at the end of it when I was just flying. *shrug* Nothing bad happened, and I would have had my wits about me should anyone had tried anything. Went to Denny's with the family afterwards lol, good times :-D. Did start texting Chris back and forth afterwards, and it wasn't the cleanest of texts, but it wasn't sexting at all though, so don't worry haha. 

Sunday not too much happened. I was planning on going to Wallyball, swear to it, but my mom's friend Anne paid me $100 to put one of those black plastic barriers around her pool. It was supposed to be around 2, but things came up for her so I didn't get to get to her house until 4. It certainly was exhausting for me, cuz I was putting it into the grass around it, not just lining an already dug out trench type thing. So because it was so exhausting and I didn't get too much recovery time, there was no way wallyball was gonna happen."

"event","So I'm fucking pissed. This entire time I've tried to remain positive about this whole robbery thing. From the moment it happened, my mom was really pessimistic about it, when it took a couple days to hear back from the cop, she automatically assumed that nothing was happening with it, but I remained positive insisting that the cop must have been working on it since he seemed to care so much and really had a thing against thieves. When the cop was really dumb and didn't think to put a tag on the new key or any limitations on letting Dan get his which allowed Dan to pick up the rest of his stuff, I was upset by it, but I still just remained positive trying to excuse him thinking he was just busy and it's a little understandable. When he went on vacation and didn't put in the paperwork before he was gone for about 3 weeks, I was pretty upset by that, but there was still that hope that<em> eventually </em>they would get theirs, even though I was angry I'd have to wait for justice.<br /><br />But today I'm done.&nbsp; I got an email from the cop like 2 weeks ago after emailing him a couple times 2 weeks prior to that. He told me that the paperwork was still at the prosecutor's office after a month of it being there. Well that seemed very odd to me, and to my mother who's in the legal system. So she finally called down there today to see what was going on with the warrants. According to the file, the police report could not establish that it was anyone that robbed us, so no issues will be warranted. <br /><br />Simply put, they get off scot free. Now I'm not completely sure about this, but I'm pretty sure eye witness accounts of unauthorized persons being in a room where items were stolen, including being on the opposite side of the room where they could have had some business, along with video evidence of these unauthorized persons being in the same hallway as the room that was robbed showing them taking out full trashbags of stuff which could easily hold our stolen belongings, should count as evidence which is pretty indicitive of these people being the robbers. On top of that, our suitemate admitted to lending out his room key, showing that that is the way she got into the room seeing as none of the actual roommates let Logan into our room, showing that she did in fact commit a breaking and entering. Pretty sure ALL of THAT should be enough evidence to issue a warrant.<br /><br />Now assuming that the above is reason for a warrant, the fact that warrants still aren't being issued leads me to think that the police report was botched. Which of course pisses me off to no end, ESPECIALLY because I have defended the cop the entire time. I'm no longer positive at all when it comes to this case, maybe even the ypsi police in general, maybe even the whole justice system for allowing a cop to screw up a clear cut case like this one. It all just sucks. <br />"

"event","It all started Thursday. It was my mom's friend's friend's birthday party who I've met once before, but hey, it was a reason to party lol. It was a pretty good time I would say, my drinks were delicious, I didn't say anything embarrassing as far as I can recall haha. There was a bit of depression that I will admit scared me immensely, but it went away after a while. I did get some things off my chest to my mother which helped, and it's helped since that night that Katie and I have started talking again, although glossing over any of the issues. 

Friday was Sam and Joe's 4th of July BBQ. During the day I went to the mall with Ash and helped buy her a pretty new purse which was fun. I also bought a memory card for my phone, although that turned out to really suck actually because I bought a generic one totally forgetting that I a Sony phone and Sony likes to be exclusive and only take Sony accessories. So the one I bought didn't fit, so I've still got to take that one back, but I was looking online and I had read that Sony was talking about stopping making phones with the Sony exclusive memory slot and stop making the Sony memory card. Well anyway, went back up to the mall and bought a Sony memory card from T-mobile, which was more expensive than anything else I had seen from Sony directly online, and also did not come with an adapter, so we'll have to see if I can buy just an adapter for it, so that I won't be stuck with 2 cards that I don't need. But anyway, Joe's was fun, there was good food, a bunch of people that mostly all played some frisbee and catch and stuff lol, and a lot of illegal fireworks :-D. Although I was not very smart in my outfit choice for the entire day. I was wearing shorts and a t-shirt, which was fine during the day, but being in the field and the backyard at dusk and after dark made me a feast for the mosquitoes.

Saturday I went up to Ash's Dad's house up on Union Lake. It was really nice cuz it was just a small number of us, just Ash, Roman, Ben, with her sister Emily and dad and step-mom, and then later Sam joined us. It was really great, we went tubing on her dad's pontoon boat, and it was great for a first timer like myself. I fell off before Emily both times I went, but she's been doing it for a while. It took soo much muscle effort though, I am STILL extremely sore from it all, but it was worth it I would say. After that we went over to the sandbar and hung out on the boat and played in the water a bit. Then we went back to the house and then had some food and watched a bit of twilight zone, then went out and sat by the bonfire for a bit. Once it got darker, we got on the boat again and went to DQ and then just went around the lake watching the fireworks that everyone else was shooting off from their houses and everything. It was really amazing, so beautiful and serene and peaceful. And it was fun to just chat with Roman and Ben the way the seating on the boat was set up. But like I never really do that, I never really just hang with guys normally and it really is kinda nice to talk about stuff that's not so much drama filled and just simple I feel. Not that I don't like the drama stuff too haha. But after that, we pretty much packed it up and came back home. 

Sunday I had a little bit of a BBQ at my house with some of the family. My pool finally got up and filled so we decided to invite my cousins over since they like our pool haha. But it's been very cloudy the entire week that we had the pool filled so it didn't have a chance to get anywhere near warm. But the cousins really enjoyed it all and it was nice to see them and really just hang out for the day. After that though, we had a bit of a swim party/grill out at Roman's house. It was cool because it was kinda with a different crowd that I don't really hang out with that often, but I'm still friends with them at the same time. And I must admit, seeing Joe shirtless was a plus, and having him manhandle me in the pool a few times :-D He also mistakenly used my towel to dry off afterwards. ANYWAY, after the swimming we went downstairs and then played Rock Band for a while until I left, which was cool because I haven't played Rock Band in months! 

And then Monday (even though that wasn't really part of the weekend but whatever, I'm counting it as a 4-day weekend lol) was pretty nice. Started to set up a guys night with Joe and some others which is really exciting. Then I got a song from West Side Story stuck in my head, so I figured why not have a good laugh and watch the SBS version of it. Oh god what a hoot that one was! I was SOOOOO short then. And then Katie came over and we watched the SBS version of Into the Woods Jr. since she didn't see that one and didn't want to watch herself in our version. After that we took a walk and chatted, then got some taco bell with dessert at her Grandma's house and then hung out at her house for the rest of the night. 

It really was just a really fun time. And not just the fun time where there was intermittent fun and then just nothing stressful. Like the entire time was full of fun stuff to do, even if a lot of it was just not really doing anything just with friends haha. Good times :-D"

"event","As many of you know, I did acting when I was younger around 10 until I was 14 with a director named Carol Ann Black. I knew that she wasn't the greatest director while I was working with her, but I especially realized that in the years since I've left. She always had poor techniques and scheduling, like she would always do scenes out of order until hell week and then we were always pushed for learning things on time, often blocking or choreographing a scene during hell week as well. Just for the record, most of her shows were musicals so being out of order at times wasn't a horribly crazy idea. And there was one show in particular, She Loves Me, where she focused a ton on an extra dance number for our curtain call pretty much instead of working on the show. 

Oh and another thing is that she was bad at keeping records of her choreography. A couple times she would teach us part of a song and we would do it the next week to continue learning it. Well we weren't always too sure ourselves because it was new to us, but there would be a general consensus amongst us as to which way it was once we went through it and one of us ""remembered"" pretty well to jog the memories of everyone else. And then she would come out and say that that was wrong and she wanted some other variation insisting that that's what she taught us, pretty much calling us liars or lazy for not actually learning it. 

And once it got down to crunch time, you did have to walk on eggshells if you will. I mean if you made a mildly serious mistake, she would yell at you. And sometimes it would just be once when it happened, but most times she would put it in her notes and bring it up again at the end and talk directly to you and I found it to be humiliating at times. Like during She Loves Me again, there was one scene where it went through the different seasons in a short span and it had a bunch of seasonal items as well. Well I was part of the summer group and I had to talk to the costume lady during the scene and I had to wait to talk to her. Granted I could have run up to do the scene but from the costume room it was hard to hear what was going on onstage, so I missed it. Well the only reason why it was noticed that I missed it at all was because I was supposed to take a tree off with me. This was during hell week, and I could hear Carol Ann shouting about ""why is there still the tree? who was in charge of that? well then where is eric?"" So someone ran out and grabbed it and I believe mentioned I was at costume, and the issue passed but then at notes time she brought it up again with that snotty attitude of ""what the hell?"" and it was ok after I explained I was working on issues with the costume lady again. And she would always do that, it would get down to crunch time and she would say that this run-through would be exactly like a show so no stopping to fix mistakes, but would then yell from the audience about things and make us stop and re-do scenes to get them right, even over relatively small things that the show could easily move on from.

But like I said, while I was working with her I didn't like her, but I was ok with her I suppose. But since I've left, I've developed a hatred/fear of her. A couple months ago I was at Red Robin where she was for a cast party and I could hear her voice from the other side of the wall and my skin started to crawl. I've never known what they meant by that phrase, but I knew after that. Like it was literally driving me crazy, I had to run to the bathroom to calm myself down. And then she was at Tim Beson's grad party, and it took everything in my power to not run and I tried my best to avoid being seen by her. 

And I've had a few nightmares about her as well, the most recent being last night. And they really just terrify me upon waking up. Like this one, I was doing her a favor by stepping in for someone else who got hurt or something and couldn't do the show the week before it went up. And some of the monologues were done offstage and I couldn't remember ever going over them at all anyway, so I was using a script offstage even though I could be seen because of the crappy curtain positions. But there were no lights on stage at the time and no accommodations had been made to give me really any light to read the lines. There was a pause and some of the other actors were saying that those were my lines even though I didn't recognize the character name at all, but I went with it. And I guess the scene had an actor saying her lines from the audience, and she was correcting me as I made mistakes from the poor light. Then it got to the part that I was actually filling in for, and I didn't know what to do, and Carol Ann was furious with me that I was screwing everything up for her and she was yelling at me from the audience saying that it was my fault for listening to the cast and now I had to just deal with it and keep going. Well before the scene was done even though I believe my lines were done, I had to run offstage because I was so upset that I was making myself sick. And when I woke up, I seriously felt like crying. Like even though I knew it was a dream, I still had that hate and anger and fear from it that I wanted to just curl up and cry for a bit."

"event","So today I'm woken up by the UPS man knocking on my door. I was actually pretty excited because that meant that my USB cord for my phone was here, and it was at 11 so I wasn't woken up early by it either. But anyway, I had ordered the cord because my phone said it was a music player but I needed this cord, $15 plus shipping, so that I could transfer music onto the phone. So I get it out and hook it up and everything, and the Media Manager thing still doesn't work on my computer for some reason, but no big cuz it downloaded on my desktop computer. So I get my flash drive and transfer my Avenue Q album to the desktop since it was one of the only album's I currently have. So I do that and get everything set up and start to transfer my music. Well I only get 5 songs on there when it says that device is full. That certainly was a shock, but I figured that I might have just transferred it to the wrong place on the phone or something. So I try something a little different, but nothing, still full. So I delete the Avenue Q stuff and just try to do some random songs that I like from the itunes on the desktop, but still only got 4 this time since one song was a bit longer. So I'm trying to find out if there's anyway to get more songs on there and there's nothing, the only thing I can figure is to use the slot provided for a memory stick. So I look up how much they'd cost, and it's like $20-25. So pretty much T-mobile was extremely misleading when it said it was media player phone since you have to purchase additional stuff in order to really use it in that fashion at all. 

So I'm already a bit aggravated at that, but whatever, I decided to get the official transcript that I need for this one scholarship I'm applying for, which is only worth $250 anyway. So I call the registration office which takes care of that, but they no longer do it over the phone I'd have to come in or do it online, so I opt for the online of course. So I'm filing it all out and it's $5 to order a transcription, which is a little annoying anyway since it's such a small award but I can deal. In order to get my transcript sent, I have to print out a consent form and then send that in. Luckily you can just scan in your consent form, but I don't have my printer hooked up and I had to use the crappy other desktop that has the scanner that works. Of course we don't use it that often, so I had to wait for all the updates to go through and then scan it in. So I scan it and send it off and whatever, just a really big hassle overall for a transcript. So I go around and do some other stuff and come back and check my email, and apparently the email with the consent form didn't go through for some reason that they didn't tell me. Luckily it went through the second time that I sent it, but still just very annoying."

I don't really have anything to do, and I understand that I do have a responsibility to help around the house, I understand all of that. So today I noticed that there was a good amount of laundry that had piled up, full laundry hamper and full laundry basket, so I decided I would focus on laundry. I do the full two loads basically before either parent got home today, and was just finishing up folding the final load when my mom comes home. 

So my dad comes home and sees that the dishes aren't done. Granted there is a good amount of dishes that needed to be done, but it was only a couple bowls of which we have a ton that were still clean, a couple of the small plates that we don't use horribly often and still had a ton of clean ones, and maybe a few glass and forks which we also have a good amount of clean ones. And the drainer was full as well. But anyway, my dad walks in the door and within 5 minutes makes the sarcastic comment ""I see Eric was kind enough to do the dishes today."" Kinda wanted to hit him right there, but nothing too bad so I say that I did all the laundry instead. His response? ""Well I think it would have been more important for you to do the dishes"" Could have slugged him right there. So I further explained that I figured it'd be more important to take care of the fairly large amount of laundry since we were running low on towels and had only one washcloth left. Of course he still thought ""it would have been better if I had done the dishes.""

It just really drives me crazy how he always gets down on me for ""not doing anything"" around the house. I know I don't do a ton and there's a lot more that I could do, but I do help out around the house and there's no way that he can say that I do nothing. And it always seems that whenever I'm happy that I did something (like actually getting the laundry done before they came home today, I normally start too late) is when he's an ass. And it's really not like I don't have my own things to do. Today I spent over an hour calling places trying to find places that were hiring and filling out online applications and all that. Which my lack of job is something that he also gets done on me for. And he probably only thought the dishes were more important because he's OBSESSED with them. He does the dishes like 4 times a day it seems. I was surprised to actually find more than just 2 coffee cups because he normally does them right after dinner. But on his days off is when you really see how obsessed he is. He'll wash my mother's coffee cup in the morning with the cat dishes, and then he'll make himself something to eat and then do those few dishes when he's done, then I'll make something to eat and then he'll wash those, and then he does the dinner stuff after dinner most nights. He really wastes soo much energy and water by doing the dishes so much. 

Enough to drive a person crazy I swear."

"event","So I woke up from a dream this morning and was pretty upset actually. The dream itself was relatively benign and kinda humorous, but the message behind it, at least the one I picked up on, was kind of a downer. Basically, I'm struggling with coming out again. My immediate family knows and my friends know, which really is great. But only one person from my extended family knows, which I wasn't the one to tell her and she thinks it's only a phase even though she's known for over a year. And on top of that, I'm pretty certain my dad's in denial about it too. It wouldn't be quite as bad if I didn't have to lie about it. It's not even just a lie by omission, because they've noticed that I've been single for quite sometime and since I just went to college where I ""can meet all these new people"" they ask about it a lot more. And of course it's always at birthday parties and holidays that we ever get together, so I don't think that that's the most appropriate place for this discussion. 

Add on top of it the fact that my own mother basically told me not to come out to my family because they wouldn't really be happy with it at all. I did figure some wouldn't because they're a little bit more conservative and republican and whatnot, and some are older so they have a bit more traditional values anyway. But my mom told me that if and when I get a boyfriend that I want to bring to events, that I should just say that he's my friend and go that route with it all with no holding hands, snuggling, none of that and just let them think what they want. Which as bad as that makes me feel on its own, I know that my family talks. And I think it'd almost be a worse feeling knowing everyone was talking and wondering about me behind my back and making assumptions and possibly thinking bad of me for not just coming out with it (really no pun intended) especially because we never bring just friends to family parties. And that whole thing about not being able to show affection basically, it's just deeply upsetting because everyone does that with their people. Like Jordan will sit on Alex's lap sometimes and Kevin will put his arm around Lucy and hold hands sometimes at these parties, and I honestly feel like my mom would say something even our knees touched. Add to that that some of my family members are getting facebook and things like that, so I also feel like I have to censor somethings there too so that things don't just get around to start the behind the back conversations and wonderings there as well. Which granted I have been a lot more open on there anyway, but still.

And I really do feel like my dad is in denial. A while ago, a couple months after he finally found out, we were talking about something and he said something along the lines of ""you and your wife might move into this house."" Now I didn't say anything because I've never really talked about that sort of thing with him at all, which is why it was so difficult for me to come out to him in the first place, and so I didn't correct him. There have been other times when it seems like he's been vague about my future and things like that that make me wonder. And he made a pretty big issue last summer when I said I was going to sleep over Katie Mara's house just the two of us pretty much unsupervised. On the way driving back from D.C. as well, we were talking about Christian and how his parents are kinda crazy with their whole extreme dislike of him being gay. And my dad brought up the fact that I wasn't allowed over his house but said ""because they thought you were gay, right?"" instead of saying because I was gay. Idk, maybe he just said it that way because maybe he thought I wasn't gay at that point, not necessarily that he doesn't think I'm gay now. 

Maybe some of the reason that I worry about it so much and don't want to literally just come out to everyone is because I'm really not comfortable with it myself. I mean, I don't really care about it, but at the same time I hate when people tell other people for me before they really know me. That might just be me being afraid of being stereotyped, but I still have to be a little bit ashamed of it, as horrible as that sounds. I don't know, it's just that whole being different thing I think. Maybe it's just that I don't feel like I fit in in the gay crowd. I mean I'm not super flamboyant, and yet I don't date a lot of guys (yes I know it's actually none but you get the point). And really a lot of my friends ""joke around"" that I'm really not gay mainly citing my lack of boyfriends, and it's like I can't ""prove"" I'm gay without giving some random guy head or something. And as much as I know that I am, it's really starting to get to me, like maybe I don't have any boyfriends because I'm not asserting my gayness enough. But I don't want to be super flamboyant or a whore just to assert it though. 

It's like I'm stuck between everyone's opinions and I can't fully dispute any of it because I've hardly done anything with a guy. It all just really sucks."

"event","So D.C. wasn't as bad as I was really expecting. The first day started a little gruffly because my dad decided that he was going to drive despite Alex's wishes and he was a bit unnerved. He was also insistent on putting his big backpack in the back seat instead of the pretty full trunk (even though I still think there was enough room for it). Anyway, drove the entire 8 or so hours to D.C. sleeping and doing sudoku. Got to the hotel and was told that we were upgraded to a suite because ""we needed it with our crowd"" lol. Turned out that the suite had one king bed and then a small couch that did not have a pull out in it. So that didn't work for all 4 of us, so we looked at a non-suite with 2 queen beds, but ultimately decided on a suite with 2 queen beds instead. We had dinner at the taco bell/kfc across the street and then took the shuttle and then walked along the mall to see the capital building and the washington monument. 

The next day we got up and went to the lincoln memorial, the vietnam memorial, the national archives, and the museum of natural history. Which funny story about the constitution...there are TYPOS! That's right, they left out a few ""the""s and things of that sort that they went back and put the little carrot in and added the word, haha! I was a little bit upset that I didn't get to see as much as I wanted at the museum of natural history. The parking meter only let you pay for up to 2 hours and time ran out before I could see everything. Part of it was my own fault for sure though. I spent some time looking at the stuff I wasn't really interested in because I thought Alex and my dad were pretty far behind me and didn't want to go horribly far in front of them. So I started looking at the gems and stones and everything and then we really had to go without being able to really look at all of that, and I never even got to see the dinosaur exhibits :-(. 

Next day we saw the museum of american history (with the ruby slippers and lincoln's jacket and top hat), the air and space museum, the jefferson memorial, and then arlington cemetery. I will admit that Alex was rather annoying me this day, because he was walking pretty fast which is ""just how he walks"" and kept walking in front of us. It was just annoying because after he was in front of us a bit, he seemed to pretty much stay the same distance in front of us meaning he was walking at the same pace. Eventually he got tired of that too and started lagging behind for a while then walking his faster way, passing us up and then walking in front of us for a while until he stopped and sat down and then repeated. He said it was just because he was really hot as well and it was easier to walk faster and spend less time in the sun. Which yeah, it was surprisingly hotter down there, like high 80s and humid as hell everyday. This night it actually rained quite heavily right after we got out of arlington where it was hailing and everything. 

The next day, Wednesday for those keeping track, we didn't do anything but took Alex to the airport around noon and helped get him through bag check and security and everything. Let him go off with his group so he could get to know them before having to be stuck in the jungle with them lol. After that we started the drive back to michigan. Nothing really all that exciting there, finally got back around 10-10:30. Which we were surprised to hear that the shooting took place outside the Holocaust museum around the time we were at the airport. Although the airport was actually in Virginia and not D.C.

Overall the trip was pretty nice, a lot of walking and being sore but that was expected. I got a few more souvenir pennies for my collection which is exciting."

"event","So I'm heading off to D.C. on Sunday with most of the family. I'm not sure if I'm exactly looking forward to it. I mean, I already went in 8th grade, and my brother didn't get to go at all. So he's gonna want to spend time at places that I've already been and whatnot. However, the thought of just spending 4 days with my brother gives me some reservations, as well as with my father, and especially with both of them together. It's certainly going to be stressful. On the one hand you've got my dad who takes him time reading all the little things in museums and sleeps late and doesn't like to get started anywhere near early in the day and always takes his time with things. Then you have my brother who keeps saying he pretty much wants to just run though everything, like he doesn't plan on spending an hour at any of the Smithsonians, and will like to get an early start since things close around 6 there. I really think things wouldn't be too bad with either one, but with both being so stubborn and together, I know there's going to be a lot of conflict. And already dad isn't helping things. We're leaving on Sunday and he still hasn't booked a hotel for us. When mom kinda pushes him to do it or starts to take over it herself to get the ball rolling, does he get the message and really start doing it or let her take over? No, he gets a little heated and pulls the whole ""just let me take care of it"" type thing.

Went and saw Up! on Friday and was thrilled by it! lol. It started off as one of those really sad Disney movies, like Finding Nemo did, but it got really good after that. 

Went and saw Into the Woods at Eastern Saturday night with Katie. Let me tell you, it was absolutely outstanding! The set was so cool and when everyone was all moving around during some of the numbers, totally reminded me of an Escher painting. And the vocals on just about everyone were fantastic. Really just utterly fantastic I must say."

"event","Wallyball really killed me quite a bit tonight I must say. I was on Nate and...that other guy, I really can't remember his name at the moment, anyway I was on their team. I was a little happy a little not about that one. I mean if it was Nate and someone else, it would be fine. But with him and this other guy, they're both really good and competitive and like to set for each other and do that whole thing, which I am not good with at all. I am only good at longer, deeper shots, not the spikes and whatnot lol. But Nate was really nice too when it came down to my team and the team that Katie Mara was on. He made easier shots and made shots right to Katie to give her the chance to hit the ball now and then instead of her competitive teammates always going for it. 

So now to the killing part. Like right away I got hit in the head with the ball and got a pretty bad headache from that, which refuses to go away. Anyway, so I was doing the whole playing thing when I was up at the net and actually do one of those jump up and make sure it goes over type thing when the other team's guy is doing the same thing. Well coming down I sorta landed on him and therefore landed on my ankle weird and almost sprained it. Then I had some pretty solid run-ins with the wall, which wasn't the greatest feeling as you can imagine lol. And then there was another jump up moment at the net, but this time it was by the wall where it was just ropes. When I jumped up, it wasn't straight up but moreso into the net, which made the landing pretty bad for my side. It's all gross and bruised type thing. AND THEN, Nate like totally and full fledged stepped on my foot as he went up for the ball on the last match. I don't blame him at all though because he had the momentum already going and would be sure to get the ball over where I wouldn't have been quite as easily, and I wasn't able to get out of the way even though I knew exactly what was going to happen. Quite a bit of pain with that one too. It was certainly an interesting evening for my body :-P And yes I know that sounds bad, haha."

This time it was Ash, Roman, Kayla, and Ben, and then Lisa Li showed up for a bit at the end. Of course, there was an excess of citronella, so the best way to get rid of it was to toss it in the fire! haha. 

Thursday was Lisa's birthday and she decided to have a little barbecue in Elizabeth Park. It was a nice little time. It was Roman, Ash, Lucy, Lisa, and then some of Lisa's friends Brandon, Courtney, and Niku. We grilled out and had hamburgers and hot dogs which were prepared as we played Skipbo. After the food and some chatting we all played some frisbee using I think 5 of them. So that made it certainly interesting with almost as many frisbees as people haha. Lisa's parents also came by to help us grill because Lisa was not capable of getting the fire going enough to cook the hamburgers :-P 

So it's been a fun past couple of days. Today was just a lazy day, which is always generally a good time.

Oh also, Dan has got some balls. I messaged him telling him to call Officer McGill or email him because they were really interested in talking to him. This was about a week or less after the initial robbery. He finally messaged me back today. Pretty much he said that he already had to contact the Ypsi police because he had some stuff missing! It was like 2 xbox games, 2 ""expensive polos"", a hollister hoodie, and a chain of some sort. He apparently noticed them missing the last time he was there overnight, which he admits was late February/early March. It's like really? You wanna throw your hate into the ""victim"" ring now, after it's been like 3 months since you noticed the stuff missing? I really doubt if he contacted the police at all and was just trying to get me off his back, which I haven't tried contacting him pretty much since that message. Anyway, I messaged the officer myself today to see if Dan did call him and to see what he said. Some nerve he has if he didn't at all."

"event","Not too much has happened since the bonfire. Had a little party with my mother on Saturday night, always a fun little time. Today I went to see the play production show at the high school. It was pretty good, which honestly was a little surprising. The improv show afterward was also pretty good too. It had it's duds of course, but that comes with the territory I'm sure. It was pretty nice to see some of those people again, although most were freshmen actually, so I had no idea who they were lol. 

Finally heard back from Officer McGill today. I hadn't heard from him since the end of finals weeks, and even then there was no update at that point, just him being dumb and wondering how Dan was able to get back in the room. *rolls eyes* That part still just really pisses me off. Anyway, I had sent him an email Wednesday last week and then the same email to his other email yesterday since he had not responded at all to me, or my father's phone calls from even earlier. He finally called my father back today and left him a message.

He said that he had been out of the office on vacation since the 10th. The papers for the arrest warrants for everyone were currently at the prosecutor's desk so he can review the warrant requests and then he would see if anything more was needed for them. He said that with the warrant, they might not be caught for 5,6 or even 7 years. But they could also be caught in like a day or a month, if the warrant allows them to go after them or something. I couldn't really hear him at that point in the message. 

What really drives me crazy, is that he's been gone on vacation the past while and apparently didn't tell anyone else in the department about my case at all, since they had no knowledge when we called. And since he wasn't doing any work while on vacation, and just got back today and was able to get the papers on his desk right away, that means pretty much he could have had the papers out a while ago. And it's not like on tv where warrants take minutes to get, it takes a couple days. So instead of telling another officer about the case so he could work it and submit the papers for him earlier as well as keep me informed as to what's going on, he decided to stay quiet and waste time. I mean, for all we know one of these guys was pulled over since then and was let off with a warning or something instead of being arrested, all because he decided to wait until after his vacation to file paperwork so the warrant was out yet. 

And really, 5-7 years before they could be caught?! And only a could be then?! That's just infuriating to me. I'll already be in my career by that point, and I'll get a call saying ""Hey we finally got the guys that robbed you freshman year of college"" while these guys have been able to continue on with their education and possibly start their own lives/careers. And what? Am I supposed to feel justified at that point that the legal system finally caught these guys even though I knew exactly who did it, with first and last names, with video confirmation, the DAY AFTER this happened?! 

I'm just gonna guess and say that I'll feel no sense of justification whatsoever. What a great justice system we have."

We started off with grilling hot dogs and snacking on chips and just chatting. After that we ended up starting the bonfire still chatting away. Of course with Ben there, we ended up playing with the fire with a bottle of citronella which certainly had some blazing results lol. After a while Sam and Joe left to go watch Smallville and then Kayla and Brandon left as well. Which left the rest of us to play the 10 Fingers Game. Surprisingly enough, I was close to being the first one out the first game and was the first one out the second game. That was a new one for me lol.

"event","Let's see it's been a bit since I last updated. I hung out with Raechel on Wednesday. I haven't done that in a while so it was nice to get to see her again. We went to Sonic and had lunch and then hung out on the swings at Memorial Park for a while and chatted. We then went back to her house and played some Rock Band. God, it's been too long since I've played that lol. After that I came home and then watched my shows. 

Which let me tell you, the judges on Make Me A Supermodel are really starting to annoy me. I agreed with their final decision this past week, but the other comments and criticisms they made were just dumb. So the photo challenge was to pose nude with an accessory and they were told to pick which accessory they wanted before they knew the challenge. So one of the super skinny girls got a really big bag. Well the photo was supposed to be about the accessory so it's not like she could really make the bag not so big in the picture, but the judges criticized her photo saying that it just really looked like a small shy girl behind a giant bag. It's like, it's not her fault her accessory wasn't superb for the challenge, but she didn't know the challenge when she picked it. And then they said one of the other model's picture wasn't a very good angle and she didn't really have a good figure for that pose. But first off, the photographer picks the best picture from the set not the models, and second, the photographer was the one that told her to pose like that. I mean yes, sometimes the models are told to just go for it pretty much, but often the photographer gives them the basic pose or whatever and then says go for it. And then (last one promise lol) they said that they think one really good model is starting to just kinda play it safe by doing exactly what is being asked from him, but still doing great. First off, that just sounds dumb and doesn't exactly make sense. But anyway, another model decided to try to be bold a little bit and did a unusual pose at the end of the runway. She had been told to work angles by the photographer so she decided to try it. What do the judges say to that? ""I would have fired her for trying soomething like that"" So they ream one model for listening and not being adventurous enough and then ream another for trying something different. 

Anyway, the rest of the week wasn't really all that exciting. Friday night went out to Denny's at 2 in the morning to join my family after their night of clubbing. And then yesterday was Mother's Day. Got my mom a pair of shoes that she wanted (she actually had told me ""they'd make a good Mother's Day gift"" lol) which she enjoyed still. We then went out to Olive Garden with all the chillin' and Mom lol. After that, we decided we were going to Bingo with Grandma! Haha, that's right, Alex, Mom, Grandma and I went to play Bingo, which ended up lasting about 4 hours. I didn't win anything, but at least my mother won $10."

Anyway, did that and then got ready and went to submit my application, in person this time, to Tim Hortons and picked up a mother's day gift. Then just sat on my ass, eating and whatnot lol. Then I went to the collage concert at the high school which was...adequate, although I wasn't really expecting much more. It was kinda nice to see some of those people again. After that, the plan was to go play laser tag with a bunch of people. However once we got there, they had no more games for the night, bummer. So we all decided to go to Red Robin instead. It ended up being me, Kayla, Brandon, Sam, Joe, Ash, Roman, and Elliot. Had a pretty good time and it was really good to see them all again. 

I know I really shouldn't, but I'm still super into Joe. I know that he says he's straight and whatnot, and I'm not saying that he's a flamer, but I do think there's more to him than just completely straight. And it's not just I want his sex or anything like that, I really just think he's an incredible guy all around. Incredibly funny, incredibly nice, incredibly witty, simply incredible. And he certainly makes it easy for me to like him too. Like he makes sexual innuendos around/about me and about my obsession and whatnot with him all the time. And he's willing to be around me even though he knows how much I like him. Like I sent him a text on the way home from Red Robin saying that I decided that we needed to hang out more, and he said ""ok dude. I'm always around."" And I'm perfectly fine just hanging out with him, of course I'd be even more fine with more lol. But like I send him sexual messages and things like that all the time, and he'll respond and joke around with it. Which let me just make it clear that I do text him other things besides sexual messages, but there's never really much conversation in either case. And honestly one of the main reasons why I go the sexual route is that that's how I got him to show any interest before, and Sam even told me when he did send me more explicit messages that he thinks with his dick easily when he's horny. So the sexual messages are kinda like the only way that I'll really get him to show interest, if he ever does again. *sigh* If only."

"event","So today has been a good day so far. Got up at about 11 when I heard a big truck outside my house and was very excited to find my new phone was being delivered! That was very exciting indeed. It's a new Sony Ericsson 506 (not completely certain on that number but whatev) and it's black and bright green! Very exciting indeed. 

Plugged the phone in and then went and got ready and then headed off for my little shindig with Samuel. He picked me up around noon and then we went to the movies to see Monsters vs. Aliens in 3D. It was a really funny movie that I really enjoyed. During the movie, me and Samuel did end up holding hands. He had been talking about holding my hand and everything last night and at that point I was kinda just doing the whole ""say lol or haha whenever he brings it up to not necessarily encourage him but not be a dick and say hellz no"" thing, cuz I really don't want to get involved like I said last post. Well first off he grabbed my hand, and I saw that he had been kinda moving his hand closer to mine anyway, so I decided to let him. And granted it was just really nice, and I was kinda cuddling up against him and everything, which was also nice. 

After the movie we went to Applebee's for lunch and had a pretty good time just talking and everything, which nothing happening during the meal; no footsies or anything. And then he drove me home and everything and I decided to and made the move to give him a kiss goodbye. And pretty much the reason for that is that he's been saying this past week that he really just wanted to kiss me and everything just to see what he was and will be missing and what not. 

So I do have a question for you all, do you think it's bad that I did all that even though I really don't feel a ton for Samuel and don't really plan to be a couple with him, at least currently? I mean, I feel ok about it, so it's more of a question of what do you think, not what should I think."

"event","First off, today was exhausting. I got up and was out the door by 9 to head to Ann Arbor to move my brother out of his campus apartment and clean it and all that fun stuff. Well we didn't get back to Riverview until a little after 5, and that wasn't even unpacking the cars at all. So yeah, exhausting. 

Tomorrow I'm going on...something, with Samuel. It's not exactly a date, but it kinda is. I'm not looking into really at all because he's leaving on Sunday to go to Pennsylvania for the entire summer. And I'm not gonna do a long distance relationship to be the first relationship, especially when there was nothing to keep going before he left, if that makes sense. But he might be a little bit more into this than I am. Whatever, we'll see how things play out."

"event","Saturday was an interesting day. Woke up and hung around the house for a while. Decided that I should really put something on my walls so I hung all of my posters up in my room which is pretty nice. 

In the process of that however I get a call from Wes saying that Dan's back at the room getting his stuff and that Nik (the Area Complex Director) said that there's nothing we could do to stop him from taking his stuff. Now mind you this was disappointing to hear in two ways. One, I was hoping to be able to take his futon and fridge for myself since I will not have those for sure next semester unless I go an buy it over the summer. Second, that gave us no leverage on Dan at all to kinda say if you want your stuff back, get our back to us. And there's no reason for Dan to be back on campus for the police to talk to him at least right there. 

So this really irked me, so I called Ypsi police. Turns out that Officer McGill wasn't working that day, so he wasn't available to talk to Dan at all. So I asked the Area Police Officer, Officer Elliott, if she or someone else could go over and talk to him since the police had been wanting to talk to him and trying to get a hold of him. She said something along the lines of McGill had just talked to Nik about the case yesterday and said that they weren't ready to talk to him, and she wasn't actively involved in the case so she wasn't sure what sanctions were in place and what she was capable of doing. So pretty much, they weren't going to do a damn thing, even though Dan obviously has some information about what happened, and he was literally right there, and yet no one was going to talk to him at all. I emailed Nik about it, and he assured me that when the cops are ready to talk to him, the will. And if Dan doesn't cooperate with them then, they will certainly go to him. *shrug* Almost makes it sound like they very well might charge him something and go after him, instead of just go to him for info. 

Relatively shortly after that Ash and Kayla called me up wanting to know if I wanted to hang out. Of course I was not in the mood because I was a little distraught by the lack of effort by the police and just really had a loss of faith in the legal system and whatnot. Like it seems they may get caught, which would be great and all, but the chances of getting my stuff back are getting less and less.

Anyway, Later that night, I went to the lovely Katie Mara's dinner theater. Went at 7 for the dinner part of it, which was relatively good. The chicken was alright, the potatoes and green beans were good. They sat me at a table with a bunch of older ladies that all knew each other which was fine by me. The seems like a great bunch and they were all really friendly.

I thought the show itself, A Little Murder Never Hurt Anybody, was pretty terrific. Katie was fantastically awesome and hysterically funny, partly because of our relationship, but mostly just on her own. The rest of the cast was pretty good, although there were some mess ups that I saw lol. Some of the actors just played their roles really cheesy I felt, which it was a cheesy show so it would sound like that would be a job well done. But I find that a cheesy comedy is much better when the actors take themselves in the role seriously, but what they actually say and their actions is what makes it cheesy, is what makes a cheesy show funny. If that makes any sense at all lol. Like, if the actor hams things up on purpose to make things cheesier kinda type thing, not my favorite. After the show I talked with Samuel a little bit which was nice. Then Katie, her mother and her brother and I went to Old Chicago after words to just hang out while the rest of them really ate since they didn't get a chance to like I had earlier. 

And that's all I got for ya'll. TTFN :-)"

"event","I think the last day I updated was Tuesday night, so I'll start with Wednesday. Woke up and went to Spanish for the final. It wasn't too bad at all, some of it was right out of the study guide. The Cultural section wasn't the greatest, but I actually did read over everything again before the final, but it just didn't stick the second time either lol. Then went to lunch for the last time with everyone. Then I came back and packed all my shit up. It's always surprised how much you have when you have to put it into boxes and things like that lol. Like I had a bunch of paper boxes and at first I thought there was no way I was gonna use them all. Turns out I used all of them and was still kinda overpacking them to everything into something. Then went to the marketplace for dinner with just about everyone which was nice because they were all right there to say goodbye to. Although I did have to make a special trip for everyone in room 115 lol. But yeah, packed all my stuff in my mom's car when she got there, did the whole check out thing and then headed home, in time to watch my shows too!

Thursday and Friday were nothing all that special really, pretty much just lounging around, unpacking only what was needed and all that lol. Although I will say that Samuel and I have been talking lately again and he has been partying a lot this past week (end of finals/his 21 birthday on Monday) and he has been confessing how much he just wants to kiss me and sleep with me and all this stuff. It's a little amusing to say the least. Hehe"

"event","So today was alright. Got up, went to lunch with Jonny, Sarah and Miranda. Came back and studied for chem a long while. In the middle of it Officer McGill, the one that has been handling the robbery, stopped by to get a statement from Wes that said what exactly he saw and whatnot in writing so it could be put into the police report. I did manage to get a hold of him the night before to tell him the name of the other guy and also tried to call Dan just to get his voicemail. 

Anyway, so studied chemistry and then took the final. It wasn't that bad, the section that was department wide had some kinda weird questions on it where I didn't really know what they were asking or it was an idea that we only kinda skimmed over in class or it was just worded funny. Dr. Kennedy's part was really easy. It was all old test questions almost exactly only this time they were all multiple choice and had all the math worked out, so no math errors possible :-)

After the exam I had some taco bell at the student center and came back to the dorm and just putted around the internet for a while when I get a call from Officer McGill again. Turned out that he'd been looking at the surveillance camera footage and thought he found the guys we were talking about and wanted me to come down to see if I could identify them, so I got Greg to come with me as well since he'd have a better chance at identifying them since he actually saw them. So we take a ride down to the police station in the parking structure and Greg recognizes them in the frames that McGill had already been looking at. Then he sat there looking before and after those times to see if he could see how they got in, when they left and all that. He found the two guys leaving with the tv and two trashbags full of stuff. 

We also found when the came in. However it wasn't like we initially thought. Logan wasn't the one that let them in with Dan's card. According to the footage, a girl came out of the stairwell on the phone, walks through the first set of doors and then looks out the second set of doors. A second later the two guys come through those doors and then the girl swipes her card to open the first set of doors. So the guys come in and go downstairs, most likely right to my room, and then the girl kinda just meanders back up the stairs to the stairwell while texting or something like that. So it seems like she's involved somehow cuz she comes down lets them in and then goes back up. The cops were able to figure out who she is because they have the records from the card reader at the time we saw it in the video and they had gone to talk to her. That was the last I heard. Now I don't know who she is or what her story was, but up to that point of the cop's and our searching, Logan had not been seen at all. Now to be fair I don't think the cop had done too much more looking through the footage before he had picked us up and he had gone right to the girl after he dropped us off. So Logan will probably be in the footage somewhere, just a matter of getting to that point. I'll be posting more updates as I get them.

Oh, and I've just got my spanish final tomorrow morning then I'm officially done with my freshman year at college! So exciting!"

"event","So yesterday, Sunday, I get a message from Wes saying come to the room, we have a situation. Kinda freaked out so I go down pretty quickly. I'm told to check my stuff to make sure that it's all there. Well I start checking, and lo and behold I'm missing some things. 

So here's what happened. Apparently Dan had given his key and card to Logan, his girlfriend, and two friends to move his stuff while he was at work. Well apparently while they were moving his stuff, they decided to also take some of our stuff. And this wasn't like by accident at all. They went through my drawers to get some of my stuff. Greg and Wes saw them kinda as they were walking out or whatever, so that's how we know who it was. They weren't carrying anything at the time, so it's not like they could have even seen that the stuff they were taking was not Dan's anyway. 

Here's a list of what was taken, prices are purchasing prices:
Greg: $25 cash
Wes: Ipod ($250)
     tin of change ($5)
Me: Nintendo DS + game in it ($125+$20)
    Camera ($250)
    Class ring ($300)
    Jewelery box with earrings and first communion cross($50)
    Winter Coat + scarf + gloves ($300+$30+$30)
    Some of my t-shirts ($50)

So currently I am miss $1000+ worth of stuff. Never realized I had such good stuff that people would want. Lucky for us though, we know Logan's full name, found out the first names of the two guys from Dan, and then one of them was dumb enough to have used Greg's computer to go on facebook and then left his page up. Latest update, Dan friended two new people, the same Scott as was on Greg's computer, and an Andrew that Wes recognizes. So it's good cuz we have all of their names, bad because Dan might not be so willing to be help us like we initially thought. We're going to try to give him a call later tonight and see if we can through to him. 

We did go to the cops and got them involved. Currently Logan has a warrant out for her arrest with three felony counts of breaking and entering, and that's as far as I know. I have yet to be in contact with the officer since discovering this last person's name. Although I did leave him a message telling him I had that information. So that's the story of Sunday.

Today has been ok so far. Had my acting class final today, my scene partner completely froze when it got to his first monologue and in order to get any dialogue going again I had to skip a page to jump to my monologue, because at that point in the scene my partner was accusing me of stuff and pulling information out of me, obviously not something I could really cover. So I do my monologue and throw some of the info we skipped into it as well, and I'm thinking we'll be pretty well off. Turns out he skips another page and goes into the little bit of dialogue that there is after my second monologue. So we ended up skipping 2 out of 5 pages. Hopefully the professor will be reasonable with me once he sees how the script was supposed to go. And I did help him when another scene fell apart when one scene partner just completely gave up and left the room. 

Good news though, I had an interview for the holman learning center and I got a job as a tutor for next fall :-)"

"event","So instead of shutting down and pretty much just running from my uncomfortableness with Matt, I mustered up some courage and logic and decided that I should actually talk to him about it. 

Well before I reached that conclusion, I had decided to lie to Matt and stay in instead of going to the club by saying i really didn't feel well. Avoided facebook because he apparently didn't go to the club either and was on there. Then I started hanging out with Hannah and Becky while they did Spanish and then went to watch Seven Pounds with Hannah and some other people which needed my computer. So I go into my room to grab it and apparently Wes was talking to Matt via video chat, so it seemed like I had been busted. But anyway, nothing really came of that. 

So tonight, we finally both are online around 12:30 and I just start with pleasantries and whatnot. Then I just bit the bullet and told him that there was another reason behind why I didn't go yesterday and told him that I was afraid that his level of attachment was too great already and he seemed like he was already putting us together and that I was still really just feeling things out. He said that he was surprised because he's been thinking that our personalities were just too different. Which it seems funny, but I was so relieved to hear that! So I was nice about it and everything and told him that I wasn't necessarily ruling anything out completely, just let's be friends and we'll see what happens, if anything. And he said great so just friends then. And then he went to bed. 

It's great, being mature really really worked out :-). I feel so relieved and just great right now!"

"event","Ok so my mind is abuzz, but not in the good way. And it's all about Matt. 

Yesterday was our little dinner get together thing. I was really excited for it actually. Well we had figured around 9, 9:30 would be when his meeting would get out. Turned out it didn't get done until about 10:30. So I was freaking out before he finally called because I thought I was being ditched or something, which didn't make sense because he was really excited for it the night before. So he finally calls and the frat isn't going to dinner cuz it's too late so we just went to the student center where I got taco bell. So I'm eating and the conversation is generally ok, a little choppy it seemed but it wasn't horrible. Luckily though mutual friend jonathan polan came up with his friend and talked to us for a good long while. After he finally left, the conversation was a lot better. Although a good chunk of it was me kinda venting about some things. And that lasted until about 1 where he walked me back and told me that he's been taught to be a gentleman so whenever we go on dates he'll be paying and was planning on it that night if we had actually gone out. So that made me happy that he's that much of a gentleman and everything, and my general opinion was very positive of what was going. In comparison to my relationship with sam, I didn't feel as strongly for Matt as I did with Sam by that point, but my wanting to run was much lower after the first get together.

Then today. We hadn't made any plans to do anything tonight but he called me up at about 10 and asked what I was doing, I said I was just watching tv and he asked if I wanted to watch the stars or something. I said sure why not, especially because my show wasn't on tonight at all which was a little depressing to find out. So yeah when I said yeah he said ok come on out i'm already almost to Downing. At first I didn't really think anything of it, but I just realized a bit ago that he called assuming that I would say yes, because he shouldn't be walking towards Downing at all normally because he lives in the FYC, the complete other way. Anyway, so we go, walk around for a bit looking for a place to sit and talk and whatnot. After a while of sitting and talking, which the conversation was generally flowing ok, I was really cold so I suggested we get me some starbucks to keep me warm. We get that and go back outside and talk some more. After a while he gets cold so we head inside the student center for a bit, and then I lied and said that I had to do homework so I should be heading back and he walked me back to the dorm around 12. 

So here's why I'm going crazy. I'm not sure how I feel about him. I mean he's a good guy and all and I'd be perfectly content just seeing how things go. BUT I'm really kinda afraid that he's already really attached and I don't want to lead him on at all, and also his level of attachment is kinda freaking me out a bit. Like he was talking tonight about his marching career and stuff. He's already signed a contract saying he's being in blue coats for the summer, so he can't go back on that decision at all. So he was talking more about not doing it again for the summer after that. And he was telling me all his reasons why he's considering not doing it again, and it was stuff like he feels like he's taken everything out of it that he can, and that he's not in love with that whole thing, and he knows that that's not what he's meant to do with his life and wants to focus more on other things more involved in what he wants to do. All of which makes sense and I can see where he's coming from, but then he throws in a whole ""and then there's meeting you."" Which honestly makes me think that he's already putting me in his life in a year, which i don't even know if i like him that way yet, let alone if we'll still be together over the summer and throughout the next school year. And there's just a lot that he seems to just keep throwing me into his future and it really just makes me wonder what he's feeling for me right now. 

And then he's just kinda driving me a little crazy with some of his mannerisms and attitudes I guess. Like he insists on walking slow, which I can understand to an extent. But I naturally walk relatively pretty fast, and it's been really pretty chilly at night lately, so that motivates me to walk faster too. And like he's kinda insistent on walking extremely slowly for my standards. Which at the very end of tonight he said something along the lines of let me know if that's getting annoying, cuz it's only fun for me to train people to walk slowly until it just gets annoying for them. He's also kinda annoying when it comes to some of the traditional gay antics if you will. Like it's kinda muddy by the path to the student center and he was kinda like ""oh no there's a little mud"" making fun of my deliberate stopping around the mud, which was me making sure I stepped on dry patches, not like me walking 10 feet around the entire area. And then I knocked my hot chocolate at one point and it splashed on my pants and my zippy and my jacket as well as on his jacket. Of course I try to make sure that it's not too bad and trying to swipe off as much as possible, and once again he was kinda like ""boo-hoo your jacket's a little dirty"" and stuff like that. And it wasn't even like i was really freaking out about it, ready to fly back to dorms to wash it asap or anything, just maybe a little bit of the ""oh shoot that really sucks cuz i'm not doing laundry until I'm going home and this is the only jacket I have here."" Nothing all that dramatic I would say, but apparently not the case. 

And honestly, the amount to which he talks about music is a little bit much for me. I mean he's always talking about his blue coats and what happens with blue coats and all this different stuff. Like thinking on my parts of the conversation, I really don't think I have focused on any one thing like he has. I mean, I kinda complain a lot about things, but it's things that I kinda have a right to complain about when he asks about some things of it, like family and things like that. But it just really seems like he's almost kinda one track and doesn't have too much more to offer. And he's a little aloof about some things like one of his reasons for possibly not doing bluecoats next time, the whole i've taken everything i can out of it. Idk, but it's kinda like you started it because you enjoyed it, and nothing's really changed about how it's run and you did enjoy your first year, so now it's almost like he's been there done that, let's move on. Maybe that's just a bad example, or just a bad description of it, but does anyone else see what I'm talking about?

So I'm just really confused as to what I should do with this. Do I do the whole ""dating"" thing and just see how things go even though it seems like he's already thinking he's in a relationship almost, or do i put a stop to it already so soon because he seems like he's already so attached without really allowing adequate time to see if we'd work? Please let me know what you think. 

Also, I'm supposed to go to the club with him and his friends tomorrow, and I'm not really sure if I want to go right now. Should I suck it up and just go, or do I make up something to get out of it?"

"event","Last Wednesday I had lunch with Wes and during it he told me about a guy named Matt that might be interested in me and seemed to have a relatively similar personality. On Thursday I met him for just a couple minutes and then friended him on facebook. That night and every night since then, except for tonight so far, we've facebook chatted just generally getting to know each other. And then last night we made plans to go to necto with a some of his friends on Thursday night (for free I might add) and then later we decided I would join him and his fraternity (the music one) for their weekly dinner at Tower Inn for dinner. 

Overall he seems to be a very nice guy and reasonable cute, at least in my eyes. The only thing is that he's already had some really clingy moments, but it very well could have just been his attempt to start a relationship since we have such a limited amount of time before the semester ends and he starts his tour with the drum corps he's in. Not exactly sure there, but there's no harm in letting it play out and seeing how things go for the time being. I'm trying to keep an open mind to it since it's normally my mind that gets in the way of finding a bf at all."

"event","So this past weekend was pretty fun. I saw Angels in America: Millennium Approaches on Thursday (which I know is not part of the weekend, but close enough) which was pretty good. Some of the things were left really open ended, which makes sense because it does have a second part. Had I realized that it was a continuation, I probably would have made the time to see both parts. I had heard falsely that the second part of the show had new characters but had the same general theme to it and stayed in the same time. Turns out that it still did follow the same characters and summed up their stories, although I heard that the second part was kinda boring with just a lot of dialog and stuff. On Friday I really didn't do too much of anything, did the graphs for my final physics lab report, then went to the symphony concert (I feel like that's redundant, is it?). Then came back and played Euchre in the lounge for a good while. Then came back to my room and made some hot chocolate which looked gross so I didn't drink it. Good thing too, because after it sat for a bit and the froth went away, I found bugs floating in it that had crawled into a little tear by the perforation in the packet. Needless to say I threw the rest of that away.

Saturday is where the real fun was at. I got up and did some more homework and ate lunch and all that, and then around 4 I think, Neil, Alyssa, Sarah, Jonny, and Jess walked to Depot Town and had went to Aubree's. Oh my god was that delicious, Alyssa, Neil and I split a bacon and pepperoni pizza and it was just sooo good. Then we walked to the bridge thing that leads to Depot Town and went on the wooden bridge underneath and then followed it onto Frog Island where Allen met up with us all. We walked all over there and then ended up back at the dorms for a short bathroom break. We then all went to Dom's bakery and had amazing donuts then walked to Hollywood Video to pick up some movies. We ended up getting Milk, Role Models, and Slumdog Millionaire. We then got starbucks and headed back to Jonny's room and watched Role Models and then Milk and then called it a night. 

Sunday I just worked on doing the rest of my lab report which took a while and was interrupted by meals and then the Close Up performance, which was really good. I'm so glad to be done with physics lab. The actual time in lab wasn't too bad, but just all of the time that had to be put into the lab reports really sucked. But at least I don't have to worry about that again for a couple months. 

Nothing much really happened today really. Went to all my classes like usual and nothing major really happened. I like my serious scene a little better now that I went over it with Matt a few times and we figured out what was actually happening in the scene. It was kinda humorous though because Wallace just about flipped out when Ben asked him if we had to move in this scene at all. He was so upset at first, but he calmed down when he realized Ben's scene didn't have much stage direction on its own and just said that they were sitting at a table. Of course Wallace helped to show him everything that he could do instead.

So now to talk about Allen. *sigh* He's so nice and seems like such a good guy, and I think he's gay or if nothing else at least curious with/for me, or whatever you want to say. It's just a vibe that I get, but it could just be him being ""guy friends"" with me. Honestly it could just be that, because I've never really been guy friends with anybody. It's only been girls or gays or just acquaintances. But like when I offered to buy him starbucks, he was going for something in the display case, not an actual starbucks drink. And he picked up one of the Naked brand juices, showed it to me and then like underlined the naked part. Of course I was dumb and didn't get what he was doing at first and was just holding my hand out thinking that's what he wanted. Anyway, turns out he didn't want the juice at all and just set it back down and grabbed a peligreno water instead. And there are just so many times when I hint at things or just completely make an ass of myself trying to put myself out there to try to get something out of him that gives me more of a clue at all. If nothing else, he likes being my friend and I like being his friend, I just wish it was more, but at least we actually have a friendship unlike the other times I've been pining after a ""straight"" guy where it was just awkward kinda and there wasn't really a true friendship behind it."

It only took 15 minutes and we ran through it twice, once on our own and then once in front of Erin's boyfriend and some other people she knew. I was actually kinda freaked when she pulled out like 4 people to watch us that I didn't know any of, I only thought it would be one. Anyway, I think we're going to be ok, nothing really major to worry about, just a matter of doing it pretty much.

I'm also feeling like crap right now. Like my nose is constantly running and my sinuses are hating me right now. It came on really fast, so it makes me think that it's just ""allergies"" at least that's what I'm hoping. Otherwise tomorrow is going to suck soo much.

Although the scene that I got for my serious scene was kinda long and confusing, but I think I'll like my partner better. 

In other news, I got a scholarship from the chemistry department for being a freshman chem major that is doing exceptionally well. I believe it's worth around $900, but i can't be too sure. I know jonny got a scholarship too. There's a chem banquet that I get to go to for free and then the rest of the fam is coming for $20 each. That should be a nice little get together, at least I hope it will. That's the Friday before finals.

Last night was Fire Up! for NSOA, I had a really fun time with that. Sarah and Becky are in my core group and our O-teamer is Donny, who seems pretty cool. The rest of the group should be ok, some are a little bit more obnoxious than others, but they seem like it should all balance. Not gonna lie Jonny was pissing me off like none other yesterday. I really just feel like he, and some of my other friends too, focus too much on my being gay. Like it's a big part of who I am, so I'm not upset that they call me it when I do act outlandishly gay or something like that, but lately I say anything and it's ""oh my god you're soo gay, like just stop it"" even when it's not that gay if you will. And besides that, he was doing the same thing to one of the o-teamers too. Like he moved and jonny was like ""he's so gay oh my god"" It's like there's so much more to people than just the most obvious trait. And he wasn't really taking the whole thing seriously at all. Like I was excited for fire up and he was just like, there's nothing to be excited about, and he didn't sit with his core group the first time either. And it's like these are the people you're going to be working with for 3 full days, and then you'll be paired up (hopefully, they're talking about not doing pairs next year) with one of them. He just doesn't seem to understand that college is more than just your core group of friends, that you need to get to know other people. Like for the chem banquet, before he knew he was getting a scholarship he didn't want to go, even though it's still a good opportunity to meet people from the chem department. And I'm pretty sure us both being chem majors, we'll need to get to know and have them know us, before we graduate. 

Wow, that turned into a lot more of a bitchfest about jonny. Oh well, it's how I feel and I'd tell it to his face if he asked about it. It's just I know he'll disagree and say I'm overreacting or something of that sort if I did tell him to his face and it would just aggravate me more and he wouldn't care at all. Whatev.

Anyway, I've gotta go ""rehearse"" my scene for tomorrow. That should be fun..."

"event","It really was. Woke and got ready surprisingly quickly, so I had a little bit of time to enjoy myself before running off to class. It was sooo nice outside too, I even wore shorts! So I go to physics lab and get my lab report from last week back, guess what the grade is? 11.2 out of 12! Meaning first A on a lab report! Very happy about that. Did the lab, which went pretty easily and it seemed like we got good data and I understood all the equations and everything. 

After that I go to the group advising for secondary education majors which wasn't that bad at all. Everything was presented in a way that I understand easily, and it doesn't seem like the actual certification process is going to be very difficult at all. Pretty much as long as I can complete all of my major and minor courses, it should be a piece of cake. I just hope that doesn't come back to bite me lol. One bad thing that came from that though was that I found out that I have to have my current major adviser, idiot Larry Kolopajlo, because he's the only one for chemistry education. I guess that's not horrible news, just slightly depressing.

Anyway, went to lunch at the commons and then hung out and took a nap at my dorm for a bit. Then went to chemistry where I got my last exam back. I got a 100% and the top score in the class! First time that's happened too! And while I was at chemistry, my parents came home from work to find that my computer charger, which broke over the weekend with a replacement ordered on Monday, had been delivered already! So I get that today because my mommy is bringing it out to me today on her way home from work.

Today has been good so far, kinda fun day in spanish, didn't do anything in acting because my partner wasn't here which is ok because I'm pretty much already memorized with my lines. And now I'm gonna start on my chem assignment from a while ago and then head to physics class. Let's hope the good days continue :-)"

"event","So this past week went pretty well. On Monday I performed my monologue and did very well on it I would say, we'll see how it's graded though. Pretty sure the professor was very upset at our class by the end though cuz a lot of people didn't do their scoring correctly or didn't have their scenes memorized. Ended up doing very well on my physics test, 97% actually. It was a little surprising actually just because a good chunk of it was all the details about crash test stuff that I only looked at once. Got back my lab report from last week on Tuesday and got the lowest I've gotten on one of those yet, I think a 80.3% or something like that. Got my comic scene that I have to present in two weeks I think, which seems kinda small seeing as we only have class 2 times a week, so that's only like 3 or 4 classes that we meet together in class. That means that we'll have to get together outside of class I guess, which I think is kinda ostentatious of the professor thinking that we have time and ability to set aside to do this in that time period. Anyway, rocked my chem test on Thursday I'm pretty sure, I found out for sure on Tuesday.

This weekend I'm home actually for my sister's birthday party. She's 22 this year and I'm going to meet them up at Denny's tonight after their bar night tonight and then the family party is tomorrow. Got my haircut today and did all of my homework for the weekend which is always nice. Well I didn't completely finish my lab report cuz I didn't understand one of the concepts for one of the questions. Oh, and my power cord for my laptop is not working for some reason today. Have to call Dell tomorrow and see if they'll replace it or if nothing else buy one so I can get it here ASAP. 

So that's my story for now, Ta ta :-)"

"event","So yesterday was a fun time. Went to Spanish until 12:30 then went to Krazy Jim's Blimpie Burger in Ann Arbor with Becky, Hannah, and Hannah's mom, aunt, and nephew. That was fun, although I think it would have been better if it hadn't been a friday during lent lol. But we did that and got back just in time for my NSOA interview at the student center. Had a lot of fun there and I think my interviews went well, although some of the questions were kinda tough. So I do that until 5 and then head back to the dorm for a bit. 

Around six, Neil calls me up and asks if i wanted to go to the casino. Well of course I did! So we apparently were getting dressed up, but yeah I just wore a polo and jeans. Got some money from the ATM and then headed to the student center for a little dinner and then headed off for our 2 hour or so drive to the casino. Well we finally get there and then walk in and then we have no clue what to do lol. We weren't sure if we had to get a player's card or if we could just go. We we just go and Becky and I head off to the slots and have a pretty fun time I would say. Played a pretty sweet Star Wars slot machine where I had a good amount of luck. Although it was only a penny slot, so I didn't win much in the money sense. Although I did  get $2.35 after putting a dollar in. Overall though, I ended up losing about 11 bucks. Got carded at one point though when trying to go back on to the floor, damn my young face! lol. We finally left around midnight and then went to the IHOP and left there a little after 1. And then it was the long ass ride back to Ypsi through random patches of fog. I couldn't keep awake though and slept a good deal. Sorry Neil lol."

"event","So I just got back from the doctor's and it turns out that I am perfectly fine. Well I shouldn't say perfectly, but rather imperfectly fine. I have a mitral valve prolapse which basically means that the valve in my heart that transports blood through the heart is slightly bigger, or my heartstrings are slightly longer, than average which causes the valve to buckle slightly when closed. This is also related to the fact that I have an irregularity in the skeletal structure of my chest wall, I believe the called it pectic. Anyway, my chest kinda makes a basin and goes in slightly, relatively common, 1 in 10 have it. 

However, this could be bad if the mitral valve was also leaking because of the prolapse. Mine is not leaking, therefore I am completely fine and it will have no affect on my life expectancy or my ability to do anything. This is genetic actually, my grandma had this as well, although her's leaked which is what caused her many problems throughout her life and eventually lead to her death. But she lived a long life anyhow, and mine is not nearly as bad. 

Funny thing is though, that during my stress test and all that, they said that I actually have very good form for running and I am actually very fit. I was working to the point where I was doing 17 met which means I was consuming oxygen 17 times faster than when at rest, or something like that. The average person can only get to like 15 or 16, well trained can get about 17, and then olympiads can get to 20. Funny thing there lol. So I just thought I should let you all know!"

"event","So I decided that I was gonna start this back up. Let me just say sorry in advance for the length of this entry.

So when I last left off, I believe I still wanted to be an actor and had no idea about where I wanted to go to college. Well I switched to biochemistry my senior year and was considering Kalamazoo College or Eastern Michigan University. I got accepted into both and it came down to who gave me more money. Due to complications with the timing of my application, I could no be processed as Early Action which meant that I could not take part in the competitive scholarships. I was able to compete for the Presidential Scholarship at Eastern. I didn't get the full ride which was the top prize if you will for that, but I did make it to the second round which got me basically full tuition for four years (124 credit hours) and a $1,000 scholarship for housing and I believe another $1,000 for the Honors college. 

So obviously I chose Eastern where I'm a member of the Honors College. In all honesty, my first semester was very hard on me, and I switched from biochemistry to Secondary Education for Chemistry with a minor in Mathematics. That's right, I might be the next Ms. Kremkus! But I'm living in the Honors dorms, which means that I'm in a suite with a common room (living room if you will) and its own bathroom. I do still have a roommate in the same bedroom with me as well as 2 suitemates in the other bedroom. I went in blind for my roommates, but I think who I got turned out really well. In fact I have requested my roommate again for next year. First semester I made the Dean's List with my 4.0 after I took Gen Chem 121 with lab, Biology 110 with lab, Interpersonal Communications, and Calc 1. This semester I am taking Chem 123 with lab, Spanish 1, Fundamentals of Acting, and Physics 121 with lab. Which yes, the physics is kinda kicking my ass. Still doing well, but it's taking a ton of work. I've made a good number of friends here which is always good, although they sometimes drive me crazy too, but what kind of friends would they be if they didn't? lol. I did just participate in a staged reading of The Laramie Project here at EMU.

Anyway back to high school. I took Chem 1 and 2 and calc and then all the other normal courses. I was section leader of the trombone section for 2 years of both regular band and jazz band. I was the VP of drama club my senior year and was in all of the shows since the last entries. Well all except Steel Magnolias which I directed. Taught catechism all the rest of my high school years as well. In the end I got to be 15th in the class. I was voted most likely to appear on Broadway. I took the ACT and got a 29 the first time with a score of 6 out of 12 I believe on the writing. Retook it and got a 30 on it that time. Oh I also got involved with DYPAC a little bit, being in Death by Chocolate and Bang Bang You're Dead. I still have yet to have a boyfriend at all, a little bit of a fling here and there, but nothing really serious at all. Not necessarily happy by that fact, but not as depressed as I was about it all before. I mean obviously there are times, but not as bad as before. 

I suppose I should also tell you about my band experiences here at EMU. Well I had all intentions of joining the marching band here. I went to the precamp day which is where you ""audition"" for the band, which was really just to see which part you'll get. They had you do chromatic scales and play part of the upcoming show, which in this case I had an unfair advantage sorta because it was Superman. So I ended up getting first part, which is great obviously. Well I didn't really memorize my music before band camp at all, except one song out of like 20 things. This honestly really screwed me over. Band camp came, and I had to relearn everything, because they did everything just slightly differently. Unlike high school band camp, the first ""performance"" was on Thursday (a day sooner) and was at an actual football game. Well because of the quickness that we had to have things ready by, obviously things were very fast paced. I knew that I was making lots of mistakes, and some of the moves required me to be much more physically in shape than I ever have been in my life. Normally I wouldn't be too horribly upset, but unlike high school where beson pointed out that we needed a lot of work, Zastoupil (the EMU director) always complimented us saying we were pretty much doing fantastically. I know it's just another way of motivating us, but it really made me feel like I was one of the only ones really screwing up. I know this wasn't the case I'm sure, but that's just how I felt, and I knew that I would never be able to live up to my own expectations of myself in time for that performance, let alone for a good while. So I quit the band after 3 or 4 days, I believe 3 though. Honestly I really feel that it was a good decision in the long run anyway, because I know that I would have struggled a lot more first semester, and who knows what might have happened then. 

Onto the health issues that have happened. Senior year, the week leading up to homecoming, I was dancing in my room to Rent, tried a little dance move that apparently I was not capable of doing, and dislocated my right knee. Hurt like a bitch, had to be on crutches for two or three weeks. Of course because of the timing, I was not able to march in the homecoming parade or game. I was, however, still in the parade, just being driven in the gator :-). And I played on the sidelines for halftime and pregame too. Also had to do the same thing for marching festival too. I was able to march in the senior show though, although it was a little difficult for some of the moves. Every now and then it still acts up, but Aleve fixes that. For the current health update, I tried to help do a study for the physiology department here at EMU and they used an EKG during that. The study only focused on a certain part of the heart or something like that, but what they say looked like something could be wrong/abnormal. So I was taken off that study but put in another that wasn't as physically trying which also had an EKG looking at another part of the heart. Once again, something looked like it could be wrong/abnormal. So they took me off that study and did a full diagnostic test for free. Once again, they saw some abnormalities that warranted further investigation. So now, I currently have an appointment with the cardiology department from U of M, one of their doctor's has been looking at my results this entire time, so that's why I'm going there. Now they are doing a Stress Echo test, or Doppler Stress test. Something like that, where I'll be on a treadmill. This test will give them a look at the structure of my heart, instead of just the electrical impulses shown on the EKG, which could just be the structure is messed up (bad) or that I just have some abnormalities in its functioning (better). So that is this upcoming Wednesday and we'll see how that goes. 

Ok, I believe I'm done for now. Probably missed some things, it has been two years, almost three, after all. But it's almost 2 in the morning and I'm tired. Good thing I don't have class until 11. But it's physics lab tomorrow, so that sucks mucho. And my traditional sign-off, ta ta."

I had a whole water, then an hour later I went to burger king and had a big chicken sandwich with fries and a medium drink. And it wasn't like I ordered it and didn't eat it...I ate all but a couple fries. And I felt soo full and like I couldn't eat another bite. Then I went over to Ash's where they had pizza...I had a good size piece and a half. After the pizza i felt kinda ick and couldn't really stand up straight. I just couldn't help it, the pizza looked and smelled so good :-("

"event","fucked me over. the whole situation goes something like this:

-Thursday
""stephen you're moving away you're my brother we won't be friends anymore""
""BAILEY YOU SHUT YOUR DAMN MOUTH I KAFLUG YOU I LOVE YOU SISTA WE'LL HANG OUT""
""let's hang out before you leave""
""okay, i'm going to the lake tomorrow""
""my car's broken, pick me up""
""okay, i'm picking up aboudi, i'll be there around 11""

-Friday - 2 o'clock 
""stephen finally you get here""
""i just stopped by to say that you can't come i have hannah and jess and amanda and aboudi in the car""
""what the hell stephen when will i see you you're leaving tomorrow""
""i'll be back to see you tonight bailey i'm sorry i love i'll see you later""

what the fuck stephen? you never showed up or even called. and i heard from ericka young that you would be here this weekend. i thought, ""oohh. yippee. maybe he still cares. he would call if he cared enough to speak to or hang out with me."" what exactly is your problem. i saw your grandma at gottschalks (where i've been working for a month but you wouldn't know that) and she asked if i'd seen you and i almost fucking cried. so i repeat, WHAT THE FUCK STEPHEN?"

i'm looking forward to two things in the mail -
1. The Last Unicorn (most awesome movie ever, which i ordered from best buy.)
2. Sara's package that i will consider my birthday present.

below you'll find a few things i appreciate, care of ms. emily dickinson. i like the fact that she didn't bother to title her poems, that she simply numbered them. i like the fact that she didn't deal with people, she sat in her room and wrote incredible poetry. i like that she was a person of extraordinary intellect and talent.

This World is not Conclusion.
A Species stands beyond --
Invisible, as Music --
But positive, as Sound --
It beckons, and it baffles --
Philosophy -- don't know --
And through a Riddle, at the last --
Sagacity, must go --
To guess it, puzzles scholars --
To gain it, Men have borne
Contempt of Generations
And Crucifixion, shown --
Faith slips -- and laughs, and rallies --
Blushes, if any see --
Plucks at a twig of Evidence --
And asks a Vane, the way --
Much Gesture, from the Pulpit --
Strong Hallelujahs roll --
Narcotics cannot still the Tooth
That nibbles at the soul --

I started Early -- Took my Dog --
And visited the Sea --
The Mermaids in the Basement
Came out to look at me --

And Frigates -- in the Upper Floor
Extended Hempen Hands --
Presuming Me to be a Mouse --
Aground -- upon the Sands --

But no Man moved Me -- till the Tide
Went past my simple Shoe --
And past my Apron -- and my Belt --
And past my Bodice -- too --

And made as He would eat me up --
As wholly as a Dew
Upon a Dandelion's Sleeve --
And then -- I started -- too --

And He -- He followed -- close behind --
I felt his Silver Heel
Upon my Ankle -- Then my Shoes
Would overflow with Pearl --

Until We met the Solid Town --
No One He seemed to know --
And bowing -- with a Might look --
At me -- The Sea withdrew --

536

The Heart asks Pleasure -- first --
And then -- Excuse from Pain --
And then -- those little Anodyness
That deaden suffering --

And then -- to go to sleep --
And then -- if it should be
The will of its Inquisitor
The privilege to die --"

Then we wouldn't have to wait so long
And wouldn't it be nice to live together
In the kind of world where we belong

You know its gonna make it that much better
When we can say goodnight and stay together

Wouldn't it be nice if we could wake up
In the morning when the day is new
And after having spent the day together
Hold each other close the whole night through

Happy times together we've been spending
I wish that every kiss was neverending
Wouldn't it be nice

Maybe if we think and wish and hope and pray it might come true
Baby then there wouldn't be a single thing we couldn't do
We could be married
And then we'd be happy

Wouldn't it be nice

You know it seems the more we talk about it
It only makes it worse to live without it
But lets talk about it
Wouldn't it be nice

"event","okay. i don't want to have amaletta ""whacked"". but this is all like 70% her fault. if she could just follow the damn rules and have her ONE friend over...no bullshit would occur. i would like to post what ""really happened"", but as i have heard three stories about the ""real story"" and all of them conflict with each other,i'll have to write all of what i know/think, in as close to chronological order as possible.

-mike and gail say one friend may come over for the weekend while we're gone.
-amanda is said approved friend.
-amanda, hannah, desi, shawna, and paige actually spend the night.
-paige decides she'll sleep in my bed.
-stephen and aboudi ""show up"".
-travis???
one of three options occurs now:
1)stephen goes into my room where paige is, and they LEAVE together or
2)stephen goes into my room where paige is, they talk and cuddle and make-out, then LEAVE together or
3)they stay at the house alone in my room and do whatever.
-paige gets drunk. (this event is out of order, it could have occured at stephen's or my dad's house) 
-everyone spends their saturday wherever.
-paige works with me sunday morning. (9 a.m.)
-i ask paige ""where?"" she says ""in your bed"" (this message seems completely clear to me).
-(IT'S FATHER'S DAY.)
-i talk to my father on the phone, planning to keep my mouth shut as usual, but when he says he loves me i suddenly feel incredibly shitty about not telling him the truth.
-i tell him the truth as i know it. (5 p.m.)
-i start crying.
-he is furious, amaletta lies all the time, the sex in my bed is over the line.
-he fights with gail.
-i go to his house .
-i cry more.
-amie shows up, and dad tells her to stay in the car, to leave, ""you can't come in here cause this is my house"" .
-amie goes to shawna's, rages and cries.
-paige calls me saying ""bailey how could you do this?"" (as in ""bailey how could tell your father the truth about what goes on in his home ((where he pays all the bills and lives with his girlfriend and her daughter)) and betray MY trust?!?!"").
-i think ""HOW COULD YOU, MY ""BEST"" FRIEND, SO BLATANTLY DISREGARD ALL RESPECT FOR ME AND MY FAMILY?"".
the crying continues.
-i talk to stephen.
-i talk to amaletta.
-i cry more.
-(i ask all three for the truth, all three give me different stories.)
- i go to my dad's at and tell him all these other stories, which means that i even tried to save everyone else's ass. (10 p.m.)
-i'm almost done crying now.
i talk to evan.
-i fall asleep.(12ish)
-i wake up monday morning feeling like shit, and with bags under my eyes that scare me when i look in the mirror."

<P>~last night weas graduation. it was set up all carnival-like, and evan and i were in line for some food, and i was argueing with the lady because she got soda on my nachos when isee karen drive by with a person in the passenger seat who looks rather like ms. sara gordon. i think to myself ""is she here?! would she have not told me?! she was here last year at graduation!"" so i run to my car and try to follow them. end up in a movie theater and i'm not quite sure how. i see them a few chairs up, with mason, and chris, and a friend of chris. i'm consused because she looks like the emaciated kind of thin, and her face looks...younger. i ash karen if it is sara, and she says something like ""No! it's her MG-30!"" apparently, the MG-30 is a kind of hologram/robot thing you can have somewhere in place of yourself. i become preoccupied with many questions. why did she send this stupin thing? why couldn't she just send herSELF? why the hell would the robot be at the movies?! i leave the theater, and walk around a bit. the theater is inside a big mall apparently. all the stairways either are extremely narrow, or move. i see mason running around in a dress shop, trailing this flower pink dress behind him, the clerk is trying to catch him. i get mason to stop, grab the dress, and the clerk says ""thank you, please leave."" we do. once we get outside, i realize that the clerk didn't take the dress back from me. oh well.&nbsp; we find my car and go home.~</P>
<P>but before i went to bed and had the dream - i had a rather sad episode with evan. we hung out at the graduation with his fucking friends, which i did not find enjoyable. i ask if we can leave, as i have come in evan's car, and all the guys decide to go to dinner. i would prefer to not continue hanging out with these people. they treat me like i don't exist, or sometimes like they would rather me not exist. i tell evan that it's okay if he goes with them but i don't want to. (i am NOT telling the truth. almost subconciously, i am asking him to choose between myself and his friends. this is not fair. i should twll him what i want, but at the time, i don't. ""what the fuck?!"" right?) so, we get back to his house, and as i'm telling him ""what's wrong"", i start crying. IT'S KIND OF HARD TO HANDLE BEING TREATED LIKE NOTHING ALMOST DAILY. i still feel stupid for crying. whatever. anyways, he stays with me, and cries a little too because he sees how much this upsets me. so stays with me. and i love him more now. &lt;3</P>
<P>and sally, when i think too long sabout you moving away i become quite desolate. you are the thrid best friend of mine who has moved away. but our seperation is so fucking phenomenal. it's really very difficult stretching my heart all the way to fucking alaska. it was strange, how my heart lept at the thought of you back with me. even in a dream.</P>

NOW THAT I HAVE RECLAIMED MY OWN LIVEJOURNAL, I HAVE A FEW THINGS TO SAY:

- it was interesting to read your communications
- they were all very sad
- (kel) on my last post i was not confused about re-befriending stephen because of you at all, i was confused because i did not want him to be a shit to me Again
- stephen has become friendly with me, not really anyone else
- i love you both
- it makes me very sad that you have both gone through so much pain
- lindsey lohan is really fuckin' hot
- as is brad pitt
- i had a fun dream which included detention at ""our school"" being that you were tied to a pole outside. when Jon Hale got detention we cut him down, and then ran away from the authorities and hid in the library/art gallery where i bumped into sara and christine and sara and i hugged (past tense of hug) and danced around.

"event","stephen has become friendly again and has decided to post this message:

OK guys, I know not too many people are going to read this and realize the sincerity of these words, but this is mainly for you Kelly, but like I said in the previous statement, I'm not positive this is going to get read by you.  Throughout our relationship, I desperately tried to mold you into this girl that I deep down knew you could never be.  I wanted to do stuff for you that only the sweetest guy would do, I wanted to be that perfect boyfriend for you and wanted to be seen as nothing but amazing in your eyes.  But it seemed that despite my efforts to be that great boyfriend, I could never do anything right.  Remember that night you were sick and I put chicken soup on your car?  Do you remember how that same night you called me an asshole?  I mean, it seemed that I could never do anything right with you, and I desperately wanted to make it right so I kept in this relationship.  But it seemed the more I tried the worse things got, and then Christine came into the picture, and she actually made me feel accepted, made ME feel like I was good enough.  It was what I wanted but from the wrong person.  It doesn't condone my actions and in no way will I ever expect to win back your respect, let alone your friendship, but you need to understand that what I did I did out of sorrow.  I did it because my self esteem was so low after it seemed I failed to be a good boyfriend to you.  Imeant it when I told you I loved you Kell, I meant that, you can't say things like that and not mean it, I just can't do things like that.  And with love comes honesty, and I knew that I had to confess my mistakes to you.  I hoped at the time we could get through it, but now I see that too much has happened and your heartache will never mend; and I'm ok with it.  I don't deserve you back.  I guess the point of this letter Kell is that I want you to know that I'm sorry, it might not mean anything to you but I'm so sorry.  I still love you Kell, but I understand why things have to be the way they are.  I'm sorry for everything I've done to you.

i'm not sure what i think about heaven anymore. 
but anyone who lived their life as sam did, must be in a place better than this. 
especially the way he lived his last few months.

i was really missing stephen for a while - then i didn't even care - then we came back to each other and now i'm glad that our friendliness and lovliness is back on track.

i got a prom dress. it's black with pink bows and very pretty - and i try it on all the time because it makes me feel pretty. me likes pretty.

and me likes the cheese monkeys. it's proving to be funny - and educational in some aspects."

"event","periods are both painful and grotesque, though that is not what i was referring to. i was simply quoting a movie. ""miss congeniality"" as a matter of fact. not the most intellectually stimulating, i'll admit, but it is funny. and that sandra bullock really lights my fire. yee-ow.

i find lower case a to b painful and grotesque - and find endless amusement in their guest book at lowercasea.com. ha-freakin'-ha.

i'm really looking forward to wearing a certain red dress to prom. i hope it works out. what can i say? though lame and girly - i really want to go to prom. 
i've got to wear dresses and be a girl sometimes, dammit!"

SKA. ruder than you. sometimes...i like it when sara steals my camera and takes pictuers and writes in my notebook while i sleep. those insomniacs have the right idea.

i don't feel different...
actually, i feel rather content most of the time.
i've noticed that we see each other but do not talk as much. i am not content with that.

how is it that i've changed?"

<P>i love you so so much. it's disgusting how much i want you sometimes. want to be with you. want to touch you, smell you, see you, hear you, taste you. i can't wait to see you tomorrow morning. maybe we'll have waffles...as usual.</P>
<P>smell is the scent that most provokes memory.</P>
<P>i stole your shirt, so i could smell it and remember you.</P>

"event","oh baby. you love me.
i love the way you love me. 
""ya know, there's a difference between like and love..."" there is a freaky bond between us that is deeper than like, or love, or in love, or soulmates, or any thing describable with words. it's louder than SOUND. it's brighter than light. it's greater than the number of atoms in the universe. 
you make me happy. very VERY happy. 

i guess what i'm trying to say is...thank you for caring for me that same way that i care for you. <3<3<3<3<3










oh ya. and Evan, you rock. in so many ways. i'm pretty sure that we are ""in love"". fun, eh?"

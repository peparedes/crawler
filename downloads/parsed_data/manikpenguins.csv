"event","To bad your out to break my heart a few billion times over. I am sick of being alone. But i need to be picky. I miss being younger. A lot younger. I wish all my friends would stop getting sick and dying from drugs. I mean yeah i know its college its like a must. But grr...i cant take much more of this. It was bad enough when i dated drug addicts and they ended up bad, but its worse when i have no one left to talk to, because everyone i know does drugs. I hate when drug addicts try to make sense of the world while high. I hate to let them know that by doing that they are just becoming more confused. If your high you arent in this world there for your not able to make sense of it. I am thinking about disappearing for a while. I thought about death a few too many times recently for my own good. I know i dont want to die. I am not selfish enough to kill myself...or maybe i am far to selfish to let people have the joy or whatever of me dying. I can't play god. And breathing is becoming tiring. I have my voids too. Yet i am not filling them with things that only cause more problems. This time last year i was dating someone who broke my heart the worst from the same problem....is this god or whoever's idea of amusement. to let me alone to see how long i can last. To see how many times i crack and follow the idiots into my own hypocrisy. i dont know what happened to being young and in love. obviously i lost that somewhere. christ will someone please send me the instruction/solution manual to this life. Because i have never been great at math and the only problem i seem to know the answer to when it comes to life is that we all die someday. And recently its the only answer to most everything i am finding."

"event","Its hard to believe where my life has gone. The people it has gone through, and who i am. I am 18 years old and i think i started writing in livejournal and deadjournal when i felt i didnt have many people to talk to. I mean now i have a ton of friends, and i still feel my words fall silent. So here are somethings on my mind.


I have a boyfriend. As usual he isnt what i had expected. He is a good person though. He spoils me. 

I have a tendency to want things or people i know i cant have (not just because i have a boyfriend). I like people i have no intention of ever getting to know. I just like them because they are there and i cant actually be with them.

Tonight i ran into an ex. He lost a lot of weight. Could be the drugs then again. He is nice. Nerdy but nice. 

I am and always will be who i am. I am sick of people having a problem with how i live my life. I dont usually question theirs, there for they should get off my ass or stop making my business theirs.

"event","Once an amazing fortune cookie of mine said ""things will get better in the spring"" well grand did i fucking miss something. I got that cookie last mid summer so i assumed it ment the up coming spring. Seriously. So Yay boyfriend of spring= ross. Was grand except a lack of money, lack of communication, and now lack of pretty much anything outside of a title. Which keeps me going and trying, and emailing and calling. And not getting much ever in return. About a week and a half i have talked to him on the phone for 8 minutes maybe. I have messaged him a good ton, but didnt get anything back there. Oh dont get me wrong those first 4 days i said nothing, assuming he was busy or something. Well i guess he might be, but he isnt too busy to go to someones house to play on myspace for a few hours (his place does not have internet!). merg. Tonight it movie night at collins. I want to go but only if i get ahold of toni. Recently i have been realizing because i never stay in one place to long, or have time to develope those forever friendships, that leaves me with out those group of friends that are always there. I mean Toni, Brad Lawrence, Odle, Pietak, and Mike furton have been there sooooooo much for me this past year its insane. and i have been finally feeling that i have expended my welcome as friend or something. i mean i spend days alone and with family, but i always like having people around and sometimes i think the people who happen to be around are sick of me. Like i Call Toni or Pietak first to see whats going on. Then i call brad to see what he is doing, then mike and usually eventually after like 3-5 phone calls hours apart someone isnt busy. odle i call almost everynight. So much so its hard to sleep with out. I mean that kid has made me laugh and smile when i felt the lowest of the low. Those are my friends who never judged me by what others said. And i am so thankful for them, but recently i just have felt very out of place. 3 out of 5 of them grew up more or less together...or at least the last 6 years. Right now i wish i hadnt spent so much money trying to make ross and me work from a distance, and saved some of it, so when things arise i can go do them with my friends. or even go see odle in florida. ugh i dont know i am just lost. and feeling a bit lonely even when around friends. :-("

"event","So i have been living on my own now for a few weeks. I went home last weekend and made the mistake of staying here this one. Mike came down and it was really nice. It sucks when you fall in love and all of a sudden it feels just like the past. I dont quite understand people. I just need a companion. Ok so its a bit more picky then that but its there. I wanted to write something and get my head strait. I dont think i can though. I am just so depressed. It will pass i am sure i just need a few more weeks. Right? I really want to go shopping but i dont have the money. Gone in 60 seconds is a very interesting movie. SO who wants to go see Goldens Aces? or something like that. I do. i love art but i just dont feel like do anything anymore. SLeeping is my main priority. Thinking i might do that again soon. I need to go hiking but i dont know the parks around here. I wanna dress up all victorian goth and take pictures out in the snow. I also want to go thrifting. ANd i want to sew a new victorian outfit. None of this i am doing. merg. I also really really super duper want to go snowboarding. I also probably should wash my clothes right now. Merg.  I cant think i guess ill sleep."

"event","Sooo kiddies. Let me recap stuff for ya. Ok petty much past 3 weeks were a <font color=""#ffff00"">blur.</font> First <font color=""#cc99ff"">plymouths homecoming</font> which was ok. It was more fun just hanging out with Toni, Colin, John, Laurn and PT after. Then that week went by then came <font color=""#00ff00"">Ludingtons homecoming</font>. That was a blast. First night up there bon fire at my <font color=""#ff00ff"">husbands</font>. Very fun. I hide from meeting his parents though. I am picky about that stuff and i like to be sober which i wasnt. Then next night was homecoming. Did all the good stuff. but my nerves have been kicking my ass and depression kicked in big time. i had fun though. <font color=""#ff9900"">dylan (the husband</font>) and i danced a lot. i met a ton of people most who are really cool. then went back to dylans cuz his parents had left for chicago that morning...then stuff (ill leave it to your imagination) but on the way back there we almost hit like <font color=""#ffcc00"">10 deer and a porcupine</font>. it was crazy. then around 1 am we went to dylans friends party. i drank to much and almost died.... by morning i just felt like death itself. went to dylans one last time before driving the impossible 4 hours home. lets just say that last sunday there was amazing and i didnt want to leave. Dylans house is on like&nbsp; a bajillion acres and it was all fall and pretty out. then drove home had a week here. then this weekend <font color=""#00ccff"">he came here and stayed with me</font>. Friday was cuddle day and then Saturday we had my family dinner for my sisters birthday. Then Saturday night came <font color=""#ff0000"" size=""4"">GWAR</font> with merissa and jay with me and dylan. we met up with colin and dave and dave there. it kicked ass i am still feeling it. today was the last day for me and dylan to see each other for a while so we took forever getting up and making breakfast. then we just cuddled for hours onend. but now he is back up in Pentwater/ludington and i miss him soooooo much already. Hopefully the next few weeks will fly by so i can see him again. I wanted a dreamer to fit my dream and i got more then i wished for. <font color=""#ffcc00"">perfect is almost close to what it is</font>."

When i was more inlove then a newly married couple. I had dreams. I wrote um down once but now it seems everything i wrote <font color=""#ff6600"">fell to pieces</font>. My love life my friendships...its a <font color=""#cc99ff"">curse</font> i was once told. Now i am starting to believe it again. I always said my untimate <font color=""#ff0000"">hell would be to be alone</font>. And even now i recognize i am not completely alone but when you lose the things that you thought mattered most, well it throws you for a loop. i am trying to find my self from upside down in that loop. last year i felt alone but then i met an awesome girl i havent talked to in months. her friends made me feel welcome and awesome. <font color=""#ffff00"">Angel</font> was her name...wow wasnt that the truth.

Last night while talking to my friend<font color=""#00ff00"" size=""4""> brad</font> his ex had asked him if he was still her best friend...he had to ask himself what that was.

""...thank you for bringing him into my life. it would have never been the same with out him. so many times things come into my life and back out of it and sometimes back in again. i dont understand it. * i was thinking of my step dad and other such important people* i am not angery at you (god and goddess)i just dont understand it. maybe there was a reason. or maybe i just dont get it yet. well i guess i do. i once heard if you put a butterfly in a glass jar it will die but if you let it go and it returns it was ment to be. i guess people are like butterflys. the difference is some of us are people who give up and some who continually search and some who settle. he was someone who always was looking for a new place and wasnt scared to go out and find it. i always wanted to be a searcher,  a wander, someone who looks for something better. but i am always scared. i give up on everything, even a few times i have tried to give up on life. i gave up on soccer, on school, on him...all to early because i am to damn scared to try to risk it. i want a life where i am not scared; a place that i can explore out side of but when it comes down to it, its home; i want to be happy with out recognizing it. and in the end i know by giving up or settling now or earlier i would have never gotten this and i till wont unless i try harder. i know in a month the harvest and the blood moon will be the time i am supposed to thank you...but let me thanks you now for something other then food...let me thank you for life.""

In the end i am going to new york. in a year i will feel as all of this was a distant memory. i am not perfect by any means. i dont plan on it. but i am me. there is a ton i have to learn. and one is not to be afraid. right now i feel freedom, love, hope and strangely enough warm. i dont know how i thought i could settle and make what i wanted come true...and i guess i am glad i fucked up..because now we are both free. sometimes when i hold my penguin i see everything i missed but there is no going back now. just lease live a good life. a life by your standards. not anyone elses."

"event","I dont know who sent the thing to me. Jason isnt happy about that but he admits it was about me. But i dont care what jason thinks. i am happy you did. Although its relavince is slim to none now it has some. Love doesnt always prevail because its the closest emotion to hate. This is one of those cases. but sense it once existed i thank you from the bottom of my heart, it means the world. Although i have moved on this will forever be saved in my memory. Who ever you are just know in love there is truth but rarely in hate can truth ever exist. So there for i love you. I may never know you but because you showed truth you showed me love and i will do the same to you.&nbsp;
May your life be blessed.

"event","A few years ago i believe i was just as most people have descibed me. Be aware I was not one to look into the mirror emotionally,or for anything other then skin deep reflection. As time went buy i got rid of some of the sensitivity i had towards things and gained some. Now that i am about 3 sentances in i am sure some of you will stop reading. but in all honesty i dont care if you read on; this is for me not you. Well tonight while scrambling to look for papers i need to graduate in a matter of months, i found a letter to me. Now let me tell you my mother keeps most of my important papers and as mature as i believe i am, i am still a mess. I didnt remember much about the letter before i reread it. I remembered alex had written it to me. it had something to do with Kairos and we had just broken up. For you who dont know what Kairos is, its a leadership retreat the catholic schools do. More then that i will not explain. In this letter he wrote "" i once heard 'to love is to see the face of god."" If this is so i realize all the more about the saying i was given in my second semester this year. I was supposed to try and figure out the meaning to this saying. The saying is, ""The Buddha is Dung"". It means we are all interconnected, even god. For those who believe in a supreme being, most are taught we are made in the likeness of god(s). unfortunately i was only made in the <em>likeness</em> of god(s).&nbsp; I can look into the mirror and realize my face is my makers face and he she they or it knows that too. I should love myself then. For who i am. Just as i should love everyone else for who they are. We make mistakes. We arent gods. But we should love each other for our mistakes just as much as we love each other for our blessings. But as i am only human i will say there will be grudges held,and i will see all the ugly and evil in people. I just hope that in the end while i lay dying (whether is be 80+ years from now or tomorrow) i will remember how i loved people and those i thought i didnt forgive me because i will let go of all wrong doings then and love you for what you were made."

I told him the other night but i was half asleep an i think  i didnt get my point across. he's leaving too so i shouldnt get my hopes up. and i'm not sure if anything will ever come of it. i am a bit freaked out by guys right now though...but he is being really sweet about all my weirdness right now. I cant tell if i am more freaked out by Alchol or boys...and the combination seriously freaks me out. But i can avoid alchol better then boys.

yeah i am still out here till friday. my days have been good but the nights get lonely. My legs are killing me because i went all over New York city yesterday and used the train only once. yeah with out walking better classes everyday my legs have become stupid. I think i have a new plan to try to go onholiday this year in russia. why dont know. but other then that i have been working on college apps here and playing with the 2 cutest pit bulls ever. Buddy is a retarded psyco dog though. he is afraid of everything. honey is honey and cuddles. pt (aunts cat) has no tail anymore after&nbsp; getting it crushed by a car...and he isnt doing so well so if he is not recovering in a few more weeks he will probably pass away. James (other cat) is mr. grumpy old james...he looks like a grump but he loves everyone. he even follows kids down the street so that they will pet him. Lucky(cat) is no longer with us. I names him when i was 5 and when my aunt moved away he went with her. but he was 12 years old and about a month back passed away. i love all my animals.&nbsp;
Any way today i am going to the beach and stuff. probably going to grab some shells.&nbsp;
Tomorrow i come home. that is if the terror level doesnt get any higher with that whole britian/ us terror scheme spoiled....i just hope i dont get stuck in an airport. or have any flight troubles. it is a big fear. 

Well i cant wait to see everyone i missed all of you a ton. XOXOXOXOXO"

Speaking of fashion yesterday when jason asked me about setting up some retail stuff&nbsp; i got bitchy about how everyone thinks they can do it. its not that i hate all the people who didnt go to school for it. but god i am planning on going to college for about $30 grand a year. its a hell of a lot of money if everyone could do it. i guess its me. eh. what ever if they can do it with out college more power to them. Anyway i will only be in new york 5 days. this gives me time to have a break down. feel completely rediculous and like i am going no where. freak out about school. all with out disturbing my friends. then i will go to the knitting factory watch a show or go to St. marks place and go see my favorite ex punk rocker. and feel much better. not to mention hanging out with my longest standing best friend because she has no choice(my sister). things i plan on buyign this trip ....
Merissa's shoe thingies from china town
Jason a godzilla or random other comic toys or maybe something cute to wear...who knows
Cait something better then nun soap. (thats what i got her last time)

Today Merissa and i went up to my old elementary school. i hated it there but i always liked at least one of my teachers. most of them are probably super old now and retired but if&nbsp; not i am going to go visit this year. but i gotta admit i miss an excuse to bring cup cakes to school (or work)...ya know how when it was your birthday you always had a tiny party with your class. yeah i miss that. or halloween... or christmas...or easter...or any other holiday because in elementary school everything is a party. and i miss an excuse to get sent to the safe teacher because i was in trouble or play tag during gym class or soccer at recess. jesus christ i want to play tag.

"event","Song in a minute. Where i am at. Lets see i have spent the day remaking my hoop skirt in hopes it will soon stop raining and merissa and i will dress up and go down town...in the best of our victorian clothing. i wish we had more people coming. we had some decent ideas. jason i thought would look amazing in a victorian detective costume and kevin dressed as ichibod crane. also maybe someone such as i dont know a younger guy we know dressed as a school boy from england. well now its kinda stopped raining and i cant find my gloves and i have no hat. it wouldbe very un lady like to go out without those. so yeah that for a few hours and then maybe someone will want to love me (aka hang out and be bored with me). Also in the jeanette news. it seems the middle east is up in arms.... it was going to happen people. not at all suprising. now lets just deal with it instead of panicing. andyes the bush administation is retarded its been 6 years of building for this, you think they would stop looking at other things and work on what needs to be done there. jesus. ok well now i am done....time for the song...

Bink 182- I miss you
Hello there, the angel from my nightmare
the shadow in the background of the morgue
the unsuspecting victim of darkness in the valley
we can live like Jack and Sally if we want
where you can always find me
we'll have Halloween on Christmas
and in the night we'll wish this never ends
we'll wish this never ends

(I miss you, miss you)
(I miss you, miss you)

Where are you and I'm so sorry
I cannot sleep, I cannot dream tonight
I need somebody and always
this sick strange darkness
comes creeping on so haunting every time
and as I stared I counted
webs from all the spiders
catching things and eating their insides
like indecision to call you
and hear your voice of treason
will you come home and stop this pain tonight
stop this pain tonight

Don't waste your time on me you're already
the voice inside my head (I miss you, miss you)
don't waste your time on me you're already
the voice inside my head (I miss you, miss you)

Don't waste your time on me you're already
the voice inside my head (I miss you, miss you)
don't waste your time on me you're already
the voice inside my head (I miss you, miss you)

Don't waste your time on me you're already
the voice inside my head (I miss you, miss you)
don't waste your time on me you're already
the voice inside my head (I miss you, miss you)

(I miss you, miss you)
(I miss you, miss you)
(I miss you, miss you)
(I miss you, miss you)"

"event","so worked today. outside. my face is burned. i look like my rosie irish self. eh. came home went to sleep. then realized evan had called me last night while i was sleeping and i hung up on him. so i called him back. not there. called and talked to james for a short while. then passed out again. till evan called. woke up talked. so now i find out Dan is coming home. Yeah my brother i adopted but before he left that changed and things got interesting. and when he came home the last time he was changed. and this time i am paranoid he wont like me or something. i know its rediculous. but i still feel weird. i never really got over it. he just left. but now he is different and i havent gotten over him (more as a brother in this aspect) but i know he changed and its not ever going to be the same dan. merg. goo thing though is Evan is usually right. and Evan says james is a great guy for me even with the fact everything has gotten emotional. Evan says it will pass. i hope so. Its the first time Evan has liked anyone i dated (to the point he believed&nbsp;that i choose well for myself)&nbsp;so that has to say something. . I was worried that not going to caits would suck because it looks as if i might not be able to see columbine now and i dont know. i was all well i could have partied with cait. but i think it will be fine. i guess as much as i worried i was over it. and now this. yay for the karma of staying home."

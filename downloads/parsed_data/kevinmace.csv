"event","well its been about a week sence my last post. last week was rather bussy for me. preston has been helping me with moving up to driver and keeping me there. hes a really good boss and understands that im a hard worker and all i wanna do is help the company and make more money. so ive gone out a few times and dide the morning air which is a pretty synch job. only about 5 stops which run from port orchard to poulsbo. this should help me with moving up to driver becasue theres been alot of people who have gone up and dont make it there expectations are really high and its a hell of alot harder to make it as a driver than even a couple years ago.
wendsday was our first game for softball and unfortunatly we lost which rather sucks but there were a couple things that were wrong first of all half our team didnt show up until it was almost to late. so we didny have a chance to really warm up. so by the time we were playing at our best was about 3 innings in. second our ump was rather bad when it came to calling the game he couldnt get his strike zone right and there were a couple plays that the person was out but he called them safe. but what can u do thats the way it goes. this week we should be alot better and more prepared.
friday i got to go and hang out with germ its been along time sence me and him were aloud to just sit and talk. alicia is looking well. im still working on talking about maraige but its still hard for him to think about it.
sat was a bbq at kells which was awsome hanging out with a bunch of the guys and drink and laugh played some horshoes and hung around the fire do to the fact that its so cold even though the sun was shinning but the wind was coming right off the water and ooo it was cold. gram was bundled up like an iglu. 
sunday was well fine until i was heading to bed when i imed hollie and joel responded and desided to spend the time insulting me. so of corse i slung some back at him. he really pissed me off and i feel our friend ship is over im tired of him being an ass trying to use my reasorces so he can get ahead im done with him.
finally ive got this new interest shes rather funny and weve been enjoying talking sad part is i met her off my space when she sent me a message. hopefully she doesnt turn out to be baba joe in a stained tank top. we shall see next week shes wanting to meet me so we will see. 
thats it i know its been along post but meh"

"event","wellps its been a while sence ive posted so figuered id better say something. this week rather blew ups is going i mean im putting in my hours and moving up in the skeem of things but its getting old i mean im having fun messin with the people and i couldnt ask for a better group to work with. all of them fun to work with and i cant wait for our group to move up to being a driver cuz we will make things rather interesting. ive been doing alot of soul searching and alot more thinkin about my life. part of me really wishes i could move up to driver soon and get a g/f and buy a house but then again i realize the trials im going threw are good for me there building some charicter so i can tell my kids interesting stories. anyway back to this week i asked for monday off because i was planning on going to see zach down at u of o but then i got a phone call on thrusday that he wasnt going to be there so i cant come down until next weekend so that kinda sucked cuz now i cant get that monday off so ill have to make it a quick trip. then on wendsday i was leaving work and when i was backing outa the spot i cought the side of my bumper on the protection bloacks by the gas station where they fill the trucks and it riped off a peace of my gril GOOD TIMES the best part is it was infront of the drivers. so i got so much shit for that. but the gril was a peace of shit so i can replace it with the same grill for only 20 bux and i can do it by my self with barily any trouble so thats good news but i got some vacation coming so im going to drive back to wyomin and see some of my buddies and my family check out how the ranch is goin. and my buddy mat is going to be there so it will be rather bad ass and ill be able to work on gettin it on with some hot wyomin chicks nothings better than wyoming girls. so i guess this week isnt as bad as i thought but the best news is germ and alic are now with child and im going to be another kids god father so i better hope that my friends dont die because ill turn into my very own orfanage home"

(by the way mike thanks man) i go and grab about a half dozen trashbags and we proside to turn me into the michelon man with ductape and extream injunity.  i get benhind the truck and sing my self as low as possible into the mucky wet stinking cold disgusting bloby blucky yuck yuck and get a good footing well as good as possible and try to do my best to pushing and picking up this half tun truck outa this 3 foot hole we barried the stuck up too. nedless to say didnt happen. i like to pride my self on how strong i am but damn kidd that fucker was heavy. so we called aaa where after the moron on the phone finaly realized after geremy told him 20 times that we were off of old frontier. and then told him the street which he said wasnt there. and about 30 mins of geremy telling him the address and him going ohh ur right it is there. the tow truck guy showed up seemed to be a rather cool guy. he wasnt supposed to help us but he did and he did a good job the truck is out dirty as fuck*as all trucks should be* and that was my amazing night geremy ur the man the funny thing is right before we were stuck he goes ""i sure hope we dont get stuck"" and me in my 3 beer buzz go ""ohh dude we wont get stuck"" good times man this was long hopefully u guys didnt read this hole thing"

You are attracted to those who are unbridled, untrammeled, and free.

In love, you feel the most alive when your partner is patient and never willing to give up on you.

You'd like to your lover to think you are loyal and faithful... that you'll never change.

You would be forced to break up with someone who was emotional, moody, and difficult to please.

Your ideal relationship is lasting. You want a relationship that looks to the future... one you can grow with.

Your risk of cheating is zero. You care about society and morality. You would never break a commitment.

You think of marriage as something that will confine you. You are afraid of marriage.

In this moment, you think of love as something you thirst for. You'll do anything for love, but you won't fall for it easily.</font></td></tr></table><div align=""center""><a href=""http://www.blogthings.com/keystoyourheartquiz/"">What Are The Keys To Your Heart?</a></div>"

"event","did you know THAT------

     The cerebral cortex chamber in a wolf's brain can be up to 30% larger than that of a domestic dog's. This, of course besides increased intelligence, allows wolves to form complex social groups within a pack. It also assists them when they are hunting. 
     A pack does not stalk and ambush their prey, as many of the other large predators do, but openly let their prey see them. They trail a group of animals, trying to pick out the weakest member. Once they have found it, attempts to single it out from its herd commence. This part of the hunt can prove very tedious. Taking turns, as if in a relay, they sprint after their choice, attempting to catch it. To conserve energy, every so often the sprinters drop back to rest, letting the ones who were previously resting sprint. 
    A wolf's body is very well designed for long term chases. They have long, muscular hind-legs that can propel their streamline body to bursts of up to 25 miles an hour. Long, non-retractable claws provide traction. Wolves also have 2-inch canine teeth that help hold on to their catch. Once the wolf has bitten, strong muscles in the jaw help them to hold on to the flailing animal. 
     A common tactic for downing an animal is biting it on its hamstring. Doing so hinders the animal's ability to continue running and kicking. Once the back legs have been seized, one wolf usually comes around to the front and latches on to the prey's super-sensitive nose. This helps to distract and frustrate the animal, almost always much too large for one wolf to bring down.
     Once the animal has been killed, the dominant male and female are the first to eat, followed by the rest of the hierarchy. A wolf's stomach can hold up to twenty pounds of raw meat in one sitting. One animal is often not enough to satisfy a whole pack with high metabolisms, due to their warm-bloodedness and stressfull activities. Soon the pack will be on the hunt yet again to ensure the survival of their species.


interesting enough?"

So I got it and took it out and it was like... barely-breathing-exhausted.  It started recovering a bit so I feverishly dug up worms to try and feed it... and when I got back it like... stuck its beak in the ground, flapped its wings, and...died.  I felt bad... so I buried it in a nice sunny spot in my backyard : ) oh and during all of this my cat hauled in a mole...and my conscience took control and I stole the mole and buried it too.

"event","those people from Connecticut came today. for some reason im feeling anti social and have no urge to talk to them at all. its dumb when you just ask them how they have been and they always say ""good"" because if they said anything like ""im not doing well"" then you have to ask them why and stuff. and my parents expect me to entertain them all week...i don't see it happening. im going to assateague about every day this week so if anybody else is going please tell me so i can say im going for a walk and then come see you. anyway, ill write more later. blah."

"event","a lovely lovely song by Jar of Clay
I want to Fall in love with you.


In open fields of wild flowers,
she breathes the air and flies away
She thanks her Jesus for the daises and the roses
in no simple language
Someday she'll understand the meaning of it all
He's more than the laughter or the stars in the heavens
As close a heartbeat or a song on her lips
Someday she'll trust Him and learn how to see Him
Someday He'll call her and she will come running
and fall in His arms and the tears will fall down and she'll pray,
""I want to fall in love with You""

Sitting silent wearing Sunday best
The sermon echoes through the walls
A great salvation through it calls to the people
who stare into nowhere, and can't feel the chains on their souls

He's more than the laughter or the stars in the heavens
As close a heartbeat or a song on our lips
Someday we'll trust Him and learn how to see Him
Someday He'll call us and we will come running
and fall in His arms and the tears will fall down and we'll pray,
""I want to fall in love with You""

It seems too easy to call you ""Savior"",
Not close enough to call you ""God""
So as I sit and think of words I can mention
to show my devotion

""I want to fall in love with You""

""my heart beats for You"""

"event","Wow. I cannot believe it. 1 year has already passed. 
Time waits for noone as they say.
It brings back memories of when I 1st came and had my first half term.
It starts after the FunRun tomorrow.
I remember when mom and dad came down.
Sigh.

"event","Heh. <br />Got to sleep in today. Had a slight fever. <br />Was sick for bout 4 days now.
<div class=""ljcut"">Oh! I went to get my neck checked out. It seems that the lump/s <br />(yes. I have more than 1 now) <br />Are swollen glands. Which possibly means that I could have <br />glandular fever. <br />I had to get a blood test to check it out. which hurts. T_T <br /><br />For those who dont know what Glandular fever is. <br />Heres a description: <br /><strong>Glandular fever (Infectious mononucleosis) is a virus infection causing sore throat, fever, enlarged and tender glands, and sometimes inflammation of the liver (hepatitis). It frequently causes a prolonged period of tiredness and debility.<br /><br /></strong>The annoying thing about this is that. Its on and off... So, I can feel really great 1 minute and absolutely crap the next. ._____.<br />Soooo.. Yea.. i'm waiting for the results to come back. But.. I dont think I've got it anyway. =/<br /><br />Blargh~.<br /><br />*rant rant rant*<br /><br />off to do art.<br /></div>

"event","Today was ""fun"". Got to dissect a pig's heart. I think it's a pig's anyway.
I thought it would be all gross but it wasn't too bad actually.
The disgusting part was the smell. Ugh *shudder*
It smelt so bad. I nearly threw up.
I just stabbed and prodded it a few times then left it there cause I couldnt stand the smell any more. Strangely enough, Charlotte could smell anything.. 
I was just like. Do you even have a sense of smell? Cause like, everyone could smell how wrank it was..

Anyway.
I am actually drowning in artwork.. And I am still procrastinating. Haha.
I am such a lazy git. 
Gah! and i Havent revised for RE yet.

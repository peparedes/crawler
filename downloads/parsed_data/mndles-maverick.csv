"event","<p>So, I noticed today that this week was not a ""good mood"" week. I was in an awful mood for three days, everyone in my classes is stressed about PoOV, which you all should come to on the 13th from 5.30p-7.30p if you can, Nancy was in an awful mood yesterday and a still-crappy mood today which made Julianne Ribaudo angry, sending her into a bad mood. One of the partnerships that one of my friends is in for PoOV is making her somewhat upset, because the other partner is basically taking credit for the entire&nbsp;thing, despite the fact that they have done NOTHING!!! That's just the tip of the iceberg. Although, from here it's all downhill.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Moral of the story: I hope next week is better!</p>"

Some of the awards should have gone to other people, but it was still fun. Congratualtions to everyone who was nominated. Even if you didn't win, it proves that you are the best of the best.

Social studies or watching Abby ""fail"", as she says (which she won't)? Really tough decision! Anyway, it's the day after my birthday, so... yeah. One-Acts are going well. We rehearsed the dentist one like 80 times already. It's a lot easier to work on than Kayoon, because there are like 5 high-schoolers to about 10 elementary students. I'm auditioning for Anne of Green Gables and Joseph at the Palace, though. I was going to audition for Godspell, but I'm going away during that one, so its a no go (Sorry, Michele! :-() Sound of Music callbacks are Thursday. I'm definitley going!

Loyalty:

You value loyalty highly.
You're completely devoted to your friends and family.
Even if they totally screw up, you're still there for them.
Just make sure they're equally loyal to you!

Honesty:

You value honesty a fair amount.
You're honest when you can be, but you aren't a stickler for it.
If a little white lie will make a situation more comfortable, you'll go for it.
In the end, you mostly care about ""situational integrity.""

Generosity:

You value generosity a fair amount.
You are all about giving, as long as there's some give and take.
Supportive and kind, you don't mind helping out a friend in need.
But you know when you've given too much. You have no problem saying ""no""!

Humility:

You value humility a fair amount.
You tend to be an easy going, humble person.
But occasionally your ego takes over.
You have a slight competitive streak - and the need to be the best.

Tolerance: 

You value tolerance highly.
Not only do you enjoy the company of those very different from you...
You do all that you can to seek it out interesting and unique friends.
You think there are many truths in life, and you're open to many of them.</font></td></tr></table><div align=""center""><a href=""http://www.blogthings.com/thefivefactorvaluestest/"">The Five Factor Values Test</a></div>"

Angel: Angels are the guardians of all things, from the smallest ant to
the tallest tree. They give inspiration, love, hope, and positive
emotion. They live among humans without being seen. They are the good
in all things, and if you feel alone, don't fear. They are always
watching. Often times they merely stand by, whispering into the ears of
those who feel lost. They would love nothing more then to reveal
themselves, but in today's society, this would bring havoc and many
unneeded questions. Give thanks to all things beautiful, for you are an

Monday is ALL tests and crap like that, but Tuesday is all ""end-of-the-year-saying-good-bye"" stuff!!!! I'm so happy that schools almost over!! Of course, some people are already out of school (YOU SUCK!!!), but that's ok!! This is going to be one of the BEST summers ever, if I have anything to say about it!! I'm spending the weekend planning everything out!!! This summer, I'm completely changing ME!!! Hopefully, Keith will put me on the YC backstage crew! That would be awesome! I'm taking voice, doing Peacock camp, and MORE! Yes, I sound stupid (what else is new), but what can I say!!

updated, but, the parental unit prohibited ""computer usage on
holidays."" My mother has something against sports fans, too. She always
rants about the fact that my sister and I are Sox and Pats fans, and
yet, she got my sister and I each an Ortiz and a Brady bear. Then, last
night, we got ""Shall We Dance?"" on Pay-Per-View. It's an awesome movie.
I take tap already, but, now I want to take Latin Dance because it
looks hard. Complex? Yes. Easy? Probably not. Fun? Maybe. ~ Write later

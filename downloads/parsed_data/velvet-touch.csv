"event","His back was slightly bent from where he always stayed over the table, leaning, examing.  It could have been from the fumes, but those didn't always linger.  He kept his viles on the back corner, stacked above the burner and caffeine pills.  He liked things to be perfect when he wasn't cooking.  His ocd had kicked ina few years before... it started when his arms began to blister, oozing pus along the tiny hairs on his arm.  Fortunately, unlike his protege's he'd managed to get by with just one lost tooth, and fortunately it was on the bottom corner of his mouth.  That's why he'd grown out his wiry auburn mustache, to distract wandering glances from his mouth.  It's not that he was ashamed for what he did, he just knew he wasn't symmetrical anymore.

All around the room behind him lay glass cases of model trains.  When he wasn't working, it was how he kept his sanity, hunched over his desk, meticulously painting each tiny aluminum hull to exact scale.  Or from what he managed to remember.  The main importance of the tiny models is what they held, the tiny white rocks packed tightly inside the little rectangular sliding doors.

He wiped the sweat from his brow and locked the lawnmower back into the shed.  His wife smiled at him through the window, and sipped her glass of tea while walking around on the phone.  The backyard was bordered by large oak trees, but otherwise left completely open.  Besides the shed the only real tangible things in the backyard were his 7 year old son's swingset and treehouse.  They were built not really as a father-son team but more a distraction to keep the lanky kid's distraction.  He'd wandered into the room before, tried to play with the pricelss model trains and science kit that shared the space.  That was a grown-ups room full of toys, not for him.

He could hear the cartoons blaring from the upstairs television as soon as he walked in.  He knew it was probably so the conversation couldn't be heard by curious ears upstairs.  What it was about... it didn't really matter. they had complete trust in one another.  afterall, she had stayed out of the business affairs through the entire marriage and never once became unattracted to him from his physical state.  it was pure love.  The only one in the house she really loved more than her faithful, aging husband was her son. the two adults knew the house wouldn't have a father figure too much longer, that they were almost to their last hand.

The sound increased slightly as he crept up the stairs, trudging to the television.  he muted it, his son wasn't playing there anymore anyway.  the bedroom door was shut.  he opened it, but no one was inside.  he turned around to look in the work room, and saw a small white sneaker next to the desk leg. 

the sight of the tipped model train on the table with open doors was the first clue. it lay there, with chipped paint, halfway full of the small white pills that called the boxcar home.  He walked closer to the desk.  the boy was lying on his back, open lips covered in foam.  nose bleeding.  his hands and cheeks were covered in white powder and his bright blue eyes stared empty at the door.

The man made no sign of emotion as he reached towards the train and emptied the other half of its contents into his cupped hand.  He threw back his head and dropped them in. out the door {carefully closing it behind him}. down the stairs {quietly; his wife was in the living room}. he grabbed a bottle of whiskey from the freezer and put the cool glass neck to his mouth."

"event","it's really my fault for letting myself become so manipulated by people that convince me i can have at least an iota of trust in them. if not as anything unique, then at least as friends. but once you lead me on or lie  to me, it won't ever come back. i have the misfortune of being a caring, genuine person and it seems that that characteristic always has a way of biting me in the ass.








the smell of coffee filtered through the cigarette smoke as i lifted the coffee mug to my lips. i'd eaten a quarter of the waffle and had let the rest absorb the stale, runny maple syrup i'd enveloped it. she was fidgety.. never really stared in one place for too long. well, that's what i thought i saw out of the corner of my eye.  i knew from the moment we'd met that i'd found someone i could relate to, someone i could eventually talk to and trust one hundred percent. we'd hung out a few times, afterall. she knew i was attracted to her and i hoped she was attracted to me. and despite what my friends said, what my gut feeling was... i let myself fall for her.  and it was that one fucking mistake that ruined it all.  she'd been doing coke with me all night, even after I stopped. i mean, we had at least a half gram between us. but it was her being unable to stop that really bothered me. i couldn't look her in the eye. i felt so fucking sorry for this one beautiful, intelligent girl because she used this shit as a crutch and not to hone her skills as a socialite.

but i didnt let it get to me.

i knew when she'd said she loved someone else what she meant.  she loved two people, and tried to use me to get over them. but it didnt work for her like she thought it would. in the meantime, a seemingly tight bond was desecrated over because she decided to use a friend to get over someone else. i fell hard for her.  too hard to go back immediately, anyways. i'm not hurt by it, and i shouldnt be this pissed. but i guess you can't control every emotion all the time.  it sucks that a friendship was ruined over this. it sucks that i was used to get back at someone... to get over someone... just used. it's weird how dropping your guard can lead to fucked up situations. and now i know, no girl is worth risking anything of value.



and i value time the most."

"event","i half-smoked a cigarette on the drive home tonight, watched each streetlight turn off before my car could be illuminated.  

the windows were down, and there was lightning all around me. iggy pop played in the speakers and all i could think of was how happy she's made me.





emotions are some of the most intriguing aspect of human existence... poking and prodding at someone only to find their breaking point has become a hobby with people i start to not like.



and i did it again tonight, got a rise out of someone not because i was pissed, but because they deserve to be hurt.





what does that make me?"

"event","i've found no solace in these people's homes. the floral wallpaper, their linoleum floors, outdated furniture.  it makes me realize that nothing really is permanent anymore.  when i wake up tomorrow there won't be a single thing that was the same as before i closed my eyes.  paint will have faded slightly, people will have died, lived, loved, and cried.  the air is a little dirtier and the weather won't be quite as good as i tend to make it in retrospect.

retrospect...

i hate looking back because it only makes me want to look forward and predict where i'll be, who i'll be... and the people that will have come and gone in my life.  I'm desperate for some substance to this life, some mark that won't eventually wash away with the rain, some factual evidence that won't be distorted into history books.  you never really do remember exact details when the thoughts push everything out, glaze it with some fog that either i brought on or the alcohol and drugs took the liberty to do for me.

i like poisoning my body... i like being a young adult with no time at all but always willing to kill it anyway.

when i traced my finger along the tiled floor i realized how close i had come. my nose bled far too thick and far too long to haplessly shrug away like it was insignificant.  it's really the significance that matters, not who people are or what they do. it's how they make things ""better"".  but usually better isnt always as good as people tend to believe.  satisfaction is a greedy force, an ideology that is always hungry but never full. we all want more. we all want more money and less work. we all want beautiful partners and meaningful relationships. but we also want their friends and envy what their friends have.  we detest newlyweds because of their affection but at heart we're telling ourselves that in 6 more years alimony will replace love. and the world will continue. animals will still hunt, procreate, sleep, dwell... and people will do the same in their own ways.  we're always searching for something to make of ourselves, something to create, something to satisfy us and convince us that we have fully lived out our lives and that we can finally embrace death because we've maxed out the credit we've been given.


but it won't ever fucking happen. our grandparents die. our parents are next. then it's us. slowly fdorced, kicking and screaming against our will into the inevitable exclamation point that is death. or maybe it's an elipses?  i don't know how to define who i am anymore, i can only go back and look through photo albums and year books and addresses and realize who i was, and only speculate on who i will be.  when i wake up, i wont be the same person, and neither will anyone else. i can only hope that i will change at the same pace and direction as those i respect and admire most, as those i hold closest to my heart.  i've realized that i can love anyone that sparks some interest or intrigues me, but it's not a lasting force and it will die out eventually.

my only hope is that my body dies first."

"event","there's this group of people at my school, a tight group of fashion seekers and music critics that all hang out together... what's weird is that i used to hang out around them at some points, until i got bored with their caddy gossip and comments on everyone but themselves. they are infallible.  these people spend too much money on used clothing, scour the internet too long for bands no one has heard of, and when they are together they talk trash.

the trash talk is nothing new; i have been around it all before, and it never ceases to surprise me how much these people are willing to gossip and talk about their friends. laughing behind their backs, intensifying rumors, etc.  these kids are the most elitist people i think i have ever met, disloyal and unafraid to stab a fellow scene member in the back if it means it's to their advantage.

they all sleep with the same people.  they all throw the same parties.  in this group, everyone knows every intimate detail about everyone else. in this group, they wont hesitate to poke fun at someone's attire, at their pronunciation, at their habits, their activities, hobbies, etc.  If it isnt with them, then it is something to be mocked.

recently i heard these kids saying rumors about me... small bullshit lies about different things... but it's weird, because i've distanced myself from them. i dont like them, and i htink that maybe they assume i do.  it's weird, how much shit talking these people do, when they really don't have anything to talk about. they're untalented, lifeless, generally unnattractive people who happened to get into a good school and escape their hick towns.  then they found more people, as plastic as they are.

i dont know why i wrote that... maybe it's just because it's funny how absurdly immature these kids are. i mean sure, they're intelligent, but these days being smart isn't too hard.  sure they read their underground unpopular theorists and authors, listen to their underground off-tempo obscure music, and fuck each other's boyfriends and girlfriends. it's like a fucking mtv television show, only these kids are too cool for mtv.

what a bunch of fucking losers. it's crazy how some people think mocking is funny, when most people find it EXTREMELY immature.

{see friends page, maybe you'll get it}
oh, and fuck you!"

"event","The torrent of words swept in and cleansed all of our consciences clean.  We'd been purged of the morality they'd forced into our heads.  Logic reigns now.  

Outside the bell struck 13 times, the sun began to sink into the hills and corpses littered the street.  The world was burning beneath us, and the buildings began to quake.  Nothing will ever be as intense as the imagery they seared into our eyelids, the faces blurring together, the screams becoming a cacophony of heartbreak, lust, death, laughter, pain, suffering, and pride.  No, the wind refused to blow the flags all raised half mast. nothing seemed relevant as the earth floated away.  the floor spun, the ceiling rose and a chorus of sobs rang in to meet the blood red moon.  There's no surviving this chaos.  there's no escaping the invalids who we spit on and kicked at on the sidewalk.  their disease belongs to us, and we've never realized it.

one more night and we'd see the day we'd expected since before a single breath came from the heavens.  There's a shortage of roseries, bibles, and canned food.  and the lines of people... the riots... we'd kill each other before anything else was able to.

tomorrow i wont wake up to see the sun searing through the ash.  tomorrow i wont wake up to the light of day. tomorrow i wont take a breath.  i wont realize my calling. i wont translate a single dream.  pockets empty, soul empty, chest empty.... the things i've seen with these eyes will never leak out. the things i've felt with these fingertips have already eroded away.

"event","i'd like to take this opportunity to say FUCK ALL OF YOU PRETENTIOUS ASSHOLES.  i hate it when mother fuckers are ALWAYS going on about this underground band and that underground band, reciting the history of the group as well as the bio of every fucking member.  people like that get on my nerves more than anyone else, the people who force music on others, the people who force classification and labels, the people who abandon all distinction.  distinction is what is fucking important. it's how we know what band is what band, it's how we become inspired, reach outside of this smoggy atmosphere and into another realm.  when people classify bands according to sound and genre, or say that they play in a _________________ band... what's that? it's setting up perimeters, establishing boundaries on how the band can sound. there is no room for growth, instead there's just a mold of prefabricated sounds and arrangements and topics. cliches develop, and eventually the whole ______________ scene dies out.  they're your favorite band right now, but what about later on when they cease to grow because of the labels YOU gave them?

and above all else, never EVER be that fucking close minded about music until you yourself can play, and develop talent.  i've heard a lot of people who think they reign supreme because they ""love music"" or because ""music is life"". i mean, of course it is, that's why we're into it. no one needs lame ass people ruining the music for them because they are too simpleminded to respect that some bands sound good and they dont fit a genre.

yes, this is directed to someone specifically. and yes, that person plays music. and yes, i've heard their music and fuckign hated it. 



it's just weird that people use music as a medium to advertise their knowledge.  i dont give a fuck what genre a band is, i'd rather listen to them and become inspired to be better. perhaps if some people spent less time on the internet finding stupid ass obscure no-talent bands, they themselves could find talent of their own.

"event","There are greater sob stories out there.  There have been better tragedies, more elaborate truths, more negative consequences, and larger tear drops.  But still, this is the only story that affects me completely and only.

I've had this trouble differentiating truth from facade, friend from foe, happiness from anything else.  Over the last semester, i've felt myself change a lot.  At one point I cared a lot more abotu school and education.  At one point i felt like school was effective and mandatory and that in order to be highly successful i needed it.  But now that i'm here, what?  I can't afford $12,000 a year out of my pocket on tuition and room and board.  I don't have a meal plan.  I cant bring myself to get out of bed anymore, i can't stop thinking. i cant stop lamenting.

and it's sofucking lame, that i am here pouring out very personal thoughts and feeligns on an online journal while one of the happiest songs:ohia songs i have ever heard plays in the background.  but, that's me.

Not many people know the extent of the drug use.  Not many people know the shadows of whatever this depression is.  Some people don't understand anything that is thrown at them.  If this were anyone else, it's something i could easily brush off my shoulder, store the generalization in the back of my head, and pass judgement.

but there's more to it than that.  I havent seen my father in almost a year and he lives less than an hour away.  we only talk when i need money--- having to beg and plead for hours, only agreed to be ""lent"" to me if i pay him back asap.  Nah, no one ever set up a college fund for me. 

what about the work that i'm not doing, for the classes i don't attend?  I don't know. it seems simple enough, but it's too boring.  there's nothing stimulating me anymore, and i believe i have priority over myself... but whatever. i'm going to set up an appointment to get examined. something's wrong, and i ignored it when i noticed.  now, everything is out of control.


i really don't know what to do anymore."

"event","I took too many pills today.  Reached out a trembling hand from the floor, searched blindly for the phone.  Clutched the orange bottle with a clammy palm.  I forgot the number, collapsed in a heap of drook and clothing, rocking in the corner. Crying.

The sun filters through the window a little less magically than it used to.  I used to try to count the dust that just floated through the air.  Matching numbers, finding patterns. 

I've grown up too much, i guess.  The curtain is drawn and the lights are off. Rose petals litter the floor, and sheet music is strewn on the charcoal carpet.

The desert seemed to speed by, the headlights capturing the occasional cactus balanced between dirt and asphalt.  The moon was red hot, and the dark mountains jutted into the violet night sky.  The car rocked, the highway made up of a cheap mixture of sand and gravel and tar.  Potholes, cracks, unevenness.  They all helped test the suspension.

I want to see the ocean.

I want to see her.

I want to stay awake.

I want to meet the man on the moon.

I want to walk on water.

I want to turn hay into golden thread.

I want to make sense of it all.

My eyes were long ago caked with the images i've come to associate with that negatively narcistic view i have of my past.  the whole reason i need to escape.  the force that drove this distance between us.

once, i fell in love.
twice, i've wished for it.
thrice, i've kicked myself.

I feel that some things have changed, though i cant pinpoint what.  I forgot who i was, back when people liked me.  That's changed.  I know who i am more than i know anythign else. but...

but...

is it worth it? self actualization, the premise to a bright, successful life. I used to dream about being famous.  Travelling the world.  Writing.  Taking pictures.  Documenting.

But sometimes documents show things for just what they were.

fuck that, i'll build a legend."

most of you would say the latter.

i stopped trying to keep up with your music, i dont know which obscure indie band is popular now. i dont like it when girls dress like old ladies, i dont manifest my insecurities into a pretentious trend minding owner... regulating who should know what kind of music. i have no inner circle and maybe i should have joined yours before i spread myself thin. i dont like your china dolls or your broken melodies. i like mp3 over vinyl. i wear canvas shoes, i have short hair. i dont own a suit jacket, i dont wear 80s style sneakers. i rarey wear sweaters and i will never own a pea coat. 

i hate what's happend, and i hate that it's taken this long for me to notice. i blame myself, for looking away. for giving them something to gossip about. whats funny is that they dont know that i know what they say about me. it just isnt the same for them though, im tired of this drama. im tired of this self consciousness. im tired of urban outfitters, and interpunk. im tired of ebay and goodwill. thrift stores have always made me itch

"event","It's weird what seclusion can do to a man. I sit here, in this cell, and twiddle my thumbs.  I pace.  I pray. I curse.  And I'm here for what? To be punished?  To be rehabilitated back into society?

I knew from the moment they said ""guilty"" it wasn't for me or society.  They were scared that they were next.  I was their neighbor, their boss, their babysitter, their mechanic, their god.  I saw his hand trembling under his cuff as he read the paper.  I saw his eyes dart to the police, to the judge when he was finished.  Families were crying.  My lawyer was shaking his head, the prosecutors looking triumphant. And I sat back and smiled, leaned the chair on the two back legs, felt it creak underneath me.  They led me through the double wooden doors, and a man spit on me.  I licked it off, and flashed another smile.

There is a worn out calendar dated December, 1978 on the wall. 1978.  When was that?  What's happened beyond these walls? So many people have come and gone, so many seasons. sunsets. sunrises.  I've worn a path in this concrete, i've gone through pages and pages of paper.  Jars of ink.  Cans of paint.  And i've done it all from this room.  This same room with the barred window, the two beds.  The fading polaroids of what seemed like a normal childhood.  It's amazing what skeletons we keep.

I don't know why i did it.  That house seemed to loom there, the yard was too perfect.  The columns were too white and the welcome mat was too new to look welcoming at all.  It was sterile.  The type of place you'd go into and leave your shoes at the door.  I knew the history of the place, how it stayed in the family for centuries.  How it was a plantation house.  A hospital during the civil war.  Fuck, if it wasn't in south carolina i'm sure the declaration of independence would have been signed there.

The fans aren't on high enough and i'm sweating through my orange jumpsuit.  Sometime in the last 3 decades they abandoned the horizontal stripes.  For awhile we wore mint green. it really brought out my eyes.  but now, i'm a human caution.  maybe it's the pun they intended.  I stare at my wall of crucifixes.  I must be in a phase. i collect them, paint them with nail polish and let my creations speak to me.  Accentuate the holes through his hands, the blood pouring down his face onto his chest.  Sometimes i add little things; tennis shoes, t-shirts, smiles.  But this one, this one is mocking me.  I can see it in his piercing blue eyes.  i grab a bottle of white. now the mother fucker is blind, never to judge me again.

When i crept through the doorway a persian cat purred beneath my knees, weaving in and out of my leagues.  The oak floor creaked a little, but not enough to matter.  I bent down, twisted its neck sharply.  Subdued the collar from jingling.  Made my way up the stairs, freshly carpeted and silent. I knew which door to go to. i had spent many nights exploring this house, occasionally taking food or switchign things around.  Once, an exorcist came and i just laughed at their stupidity. their ignorance. their outdated neotraditionalist liberal bullshit.  she came to the door, pale, grey wirey hair, shrunk into her burgundy bathrobe and pointing inside, shaking her head.  stupid cunt.

The air in here is too sticky to breathe through my nose.  I keep taking gulps of it, and i feel like a fish.  Sometime soon we'll be able to eat, and it's the one thing i have to look forward to.  I enjoy the tension in the air as rapists and murderers and liars and theives and adulterers and molestors all stand in line, shuffling one behind the other. All eating the same food, sitting beside each other, and trying to look as tough and intimidating as possible.  Interesting to do while devouring a red ripe apple, or portion of chocolate pudding.  But me, they set me at my own table.  They said i was too much of a risk to eat with the others. I wasnt volatile enough to go into solitary confinement.  And so i sit and eat, making the occasional crack to the guards, blatantly disobeying the no-talk policy and all the while getting away with it.  I found the right people to intimidate.  These men, the guards, the lawyers, the senators, the journalists... they are more my peers than any of the uneducated underprivileged people who share this facility with me.  They got caught, i strolled into the station and turned myself in, dropping the paper bag on the table and demanded they cuff me.

she was asleep when i opened the door, sleeping the beautiful daylight away, blissfully content with her money and her lifestyle and her new ghost-free house.  i tied her legs, lightly, to her bedposts.  I picked up the serated knife i was holding, and delicately, slowly, worked its way through her wrist.  Of course she woke up.  But the gag i placed in her mouth did its job.  I worked the knife through her other hand, and held them up to her.  Grabbed the knife, sliced into her eyes, gently wiping away her bloody tears and whispering in my most nurturing voice that it would all be ok. that she would never have a care again.  i left her there, satisfied with what i had done for my savior.  i knew she would bleed to death, but when he spoke to me that's what he said he wanted. she had tosuffer for all of her sins. she had to pay for stealing my father away, for allowing the bastard to abandon us.  She had to pay for my mother's suicide. and she paid.

i whistled a tune i had faintly heard on the television downstairs, where her grand daughter was intently watching the mickey mouse club. carrying my brown paper bag, i strolled outside and got in my truck, driving to the station.  it was such a beautiful day."

"event","The dark brown '79 cadillac purred away in the driveway, behind the cabin.  The top was down, and i could see the lake through the trees.  It ws pretty easy; all the leaves were gone.  I hugged my red and black plaid flannel jacket and kept watching the right sideview mirror as he talked. I looked down and studied my class ring, tarnished, holding memories i forced away a long time ago.
""Alright, i just gotta sell him this half ounce and i will be gone.  I know we had beef in the day, but it's all better now.  Look at him, he's settled in, and he's done lived his dreams.  He respects a man with dreams still left, like us.  We don't gotta worry about nothin'.""
he tipped his white cowboy hat at me, and winked. his face was unshaven, and his blonde hair curled out from underneath the brim.  he pulled the key from the ignition, briskly got out of the car.  made his way behind it, towards the waiting man. 
""wait, i need some type of insurance, what if something happens to you?"" i called out, a little weary of the man pacing at the back door of the cabin, lighting and relighting his cigarette.
""here's some insurance"" he said, and came over to my door.  he tossed me the keys, and pulled a white baggie out of jacket pocket. ""here, take some of this.""  i put my nostril up to his fingertip and inhaled sharply. the world spun a little slower, and i regrouped.
I watched him from the sideview mirror.  The other man looked at me; i knew he studied me under those aviator glasses and brown suede cowboy hat. My pal pulled out the baggie filled with pot, weighed it in front of him, and handed it over.  The man put it in his left hand, and reached around to his wallet. instead, he pulled out an ivory-gripped revolver and fired.

bang.

bang.

bang.

He looked at me and tipped his hat.  Walked back inside.  My pal lied there, unmoving and leaking whatever crimson life that wasnt already splattered onto the tree trunks.  I threw the keys into the ignition and turned as hard as i could, feeling the key bend between my fingers.  from the passenger seat i shifted into drive and hopped over, slamming my foot on the gas pedal.  gravel spun everywhere, and i knew he wouldnt even bother coming after me.  his beef wasnt with me.  but i sped down the half mile long driveway, pullig out at a wooded bend, and nearly sideswiped a police car.

but they didnt notice.  i took another hit from that little white baggie, and glanced at the speed limit sign. i depressed the accelerator, and stayed in my lane.  one day, i knew, i was going to see him again.

"event","Knees bent, head lowered.  Eyes squinted, helmet cocked back.  The smell of napalm burned the air, blew into the foxholes.  The trees were crouching, leaves dodging the toxicitiy.  The scope was the only savior now, the crosshairs the only savior.  In times like these, in times where it was kill or be killed, everything else didnt matter.  The bullet that went through your companion's head hit like a wrecking ball.  The way his head snapped back, eyes rolled, knees buckled... something even the best hollywood director could never recreate.  Blood splattered on the dirt, and I tasted it.  I felt it on my cheek.

He screamed, grabbed at my ankles, not yet dead.  He was struggling, and in pain.  I pulled the barrel out of the tripod, pulled the hammer, and sent him salvation from this hell.  A mortar exploded.  A bomb whistled.  Rockets flared, and no one moved.  Everyone thought the same thing.  Everyone saw the mangled corpses; body parts scattered in the trenches, in the fields, the trees, the burnt, melting hulls of tanks and helicoptors.  And everyone knew their duty.

We were put here for america.  We were put her to prevent the spread of an idea, because the bureaucrats in Washington were convinced that if we stopped the army we would stop their plague.  If we killed them down, men, women, children, animals we could end it all.  If we burned their villages and destroyed their food we knew we could land them on our side.  

and so we fought.

I caught a sniper in a palm tree, relocating.  Putting a bullet in his rifle.  It took one time to shoot the gun from his hand. 

""Bet ya 10 bucks you cant shoot his foot off without him falling out of the tree"" he yelled into my ear between bomb blasts.  I answered with a quick nod.  Cocked the rifle, pulled the trigger, smelled the hammer hitting the pin.  And he didnt fall.  He looked down and screamed.  He must have been baffled; he must have thought of his family, of his flag, of the idea we were fighting.  He must have realized he was no more, and he just bastardized his legacy.  Me?  I responded to every dream the mother fucker had by hitting him between the eyes.  Ten dollars doesn't buy much on the front line anyway.

In my pocket i had all that mattered.  I put a little on my finger and sniffed.  Then another. And another.  And another.

Fuck, my nose was bleeding. Or was it from the younger soldier that i helped?  I guess it didnt really matter.  in times like these, no one matters other than the people who are out to kill.  And i was one of them.  I was in charge of killing the idea, of stopping their plague.  I was in charge of giving the government statistics.  I was incharge of giving the media coverage.  I was in charge of making my family proud.  I was in charge of fucking every relation we had with the free world.  And i was fulfilling every obligation with ease as i felt the trigger snap back to attention with every round i fired off.

The napalm was starting to smell sweet, like the smell of burning flesh, cauterizing itself so slowly that i could taste their meat being cooked.  And it tasted good.  Nothin gave me more happiness than a writhing corpse."

the children hadn't suffered. some remained holding teddy bears. some still smiled, though their skin was falling off from their skulls.  one child had been crying- his greying skin dried from the salt on the inside of his eyes. his dead labrador laid at the foot of the bed.

no one knew what it was. there were no autopsies given, just scores of shallow graves for the wealthy, and a crematorium dug for the rest.  their money was taken. their houses burned down. all evidence of foul play ignored.

lately i have gotten over her.. i dont know when or how, but for the most part i am.  i've been meeting awesome people and including them in my life, and i cannot believe how truly lucky i really am to know the people i know, and to share all these experiences with--- memories that i will never let go of.

but lately i've been craving something more, a best friend i can share everything with, something past sex.  i've proven i can go without, and actually turn it down. 

i want the girl who i go to bed thinking about and wake up thinking about, the girl that will always make me smile and the only memories and stories we tell have happy endings.  i want to roll over at night, and extend my hand just inches and feel her breathing next to me. i want to fall asleep with my head between her shoulders and neck. i want to feel her eyelashes tickle my cheek. 

i want to look for clovers and go on picnics and listen to music and go to museums and color in coloring books and make sure she knew more about me than i did, and hopefully she would feel the same.

i want to fall in love again, but how many chances do people get? i've skipped over so many people and taken so many for granted and all i want is the perfect kiss again, to feel what it's like to live."

<P>so we drive to a parking lot about 600 yards from the movie theater and smoked again which was pleasant, then walked into the movie where i got a free drink and got in for free. mmmmm. during the movie, which was full of cliche and cheesiness and everything highly predictable, i realized my head still hurt but wasnt lumping up... so i put my hand up to it and some of my hair was stuck together and it was kind of gross and moist... so i turn my phone on and shine it on my hand which had blood on it. fucking tree... my head wound up bleeding half the night, even after i washed it out and such.</P>

hours later i was in a pale yellow padded room, sipping cold bitter coffee and eyeing the tray beside me for crumbs left over from my suasage, biscuit, eggs, and cereal.  i was tired, and the foam blue couch i sat on wasn't nearly long enough to lie down on. i yawned.

""hello, i am ms. manning, dean of students. this is doctor hamrick, head of student health's psychiatrics. since you dont have a parent here, we will just go ahead and talk to you alone.  because of university policy, you cannot return to the residence halls or to class.""

i didnt like where it was going. ""so how are you going to reimburse me?""

she continued ""there is a committee set up to evaluate your risk level and to run an investigation on what has happened here.""

""but nothing has happened to investigate, i dont appreciate how im being treated unfairly right now.""

he spoke up, ""we dont know that it didnt happen, and we want to make sure you are not a risk to yourself or others.""

""it's on instant messager, you cant prove shit.""

""well we need to know where you're staying tonight, so we can contact you later""

""i have no clue.""

""well we need to know""

""well as of 15 min ago i am homeless, i have nowhere to go and no way to contact anyone.""

gets flustered, ""well i can obviously see im wasting my time. here's my card, when you know what you're doing, give me a call.""

me, very pissed off, ""you need to stop and understand where the fuck i am coming from, i have no where to go because ih ave had no way to contact anyone. until you guys walked in i had no idea i couldnt stay in the residence halls, and you obviously havent seen me talk to anyone a ride, so chill out""

he became angry, ""you need to realize you are speaking in front of the dean of students.""

""you need to realize i really dont care at this point, i am being treated very biasly right now over something i never said, and dont have this whole patronizing act towards me that you guys are looking out for my interests. i researched what the school does in these situations, and i know right now i am a liabilty, and because of that you guys are doing what you can to take care of your own asses, which really sucks. and it seems to me that if i were pissed at someone who went to this university all i would have to do is say that the kid has a bomb and is going to blow up himself and other people, and he will automatically lose weeks of classes.""

""well it's procedure, we cant have everyone running wild on campus""

 

in case anyone is wondering what's going on, i scared a friend the other night and she got worried about me and called the university police, saying she was worried about me. well they called a different police station, who called a different police station, who called the university back as well as my parents. the story changed from her being worried to me having a gun and being suicidal.

well the police officers realized what was going on and said it was university policy that i get a psychiatric evaluation at student health. they were closed, so the officers suggested the emergency room. i checked myself in and was put in a padded room for 6 hours, talked to 4 psychiatrists and 3 RNs. they all saw i was of no harm to myself or others and recommended to the school that they just realize it was a mistake.  the school sent people in to ""invesitgate"" my apparently bad behavior, and made me sign legal documentation without a parent there (i am 19, but the hospital wouldnt let me out without a parent, making me wonder how i wasnt of reasonable mind to leave the hospital alone, but  could make legal decisions).  right now i cannot go back to school until the investigation is finished and a committee has evaluated my case and decided what degree of risk i am to the university.

it was on my school's application and student health records initially that i have depression, but those records were ignored. this means that though the school knew i was a liability, they accepted me anyway, and are now treating me biasly when it was REPORTED that i was a risk.

i couldnt sleep in my dorm room the night this all happened. i cant stay in the dorm during the weekend, because i am considered dangerous. however, they let me stay thursday night. (so i am suddenly not dangerous?)

the committee involved is created to evaluate ""students whose behavior makes them a danger to self."" however there was NO behavior involved.

i have to meet in front of the dean of my school and tell him that i am willing to go to therapy once a week, and i am back on antidepressants.

i may not be able to return for this summer session, or next semester, or back to the school period. if i am kicked out there will be a lawsuit because the university has handled this as if they had no clue i was any type of risk, though it was in their records that i had depression and they did nothing to contact me about psychological services.

the school does not intend to reimburse me for classes or nights missed.

i am missing a least 4 days of class, which during the summer is equivalent to about half a month of a real semester.

The waves would crash below our feet and in the dim blue glow of the moon we'd eye crabs occasionally scurry by, not giving us a second glance.  i remember tracing my fingertips down your neck and around your stomach, how the air would get stickier as we'd slide into each other.  In the chaos of lips on lips, tongues on necks, teeth on shoulders, our eyes would sometimes catch.  They'd speak of more than lust.  i remember how i'd always make sure you'd come first, though most of the time you were fighting it so we'd come together, ""it means more,"" you'd say between gasps.  

then we'd lie on the blanket, knowing everyone was missing us.  we were huddled below the dunes, they'd never find us at night.  we'd make our plans for the future, and i'd say how i would love for you to be in mine.  you'd agree, and our hands would stay interlocked.  we'd laugh about things, and i'd smile genuinely.  

i remember how special those moments seemed to me, knowing then that they would always be in my mind, always be more than an erotic memory.

but now i look back and wonder, i don't know if i were the first, and now i dread not being the last.  i see you with him, under those same stars we stole, mapping out the same constellations, kissing your body that i once claimed as mine and no one elses.  though we never spoke, i'm assuming the plans have changed. you're most likely still wanting a new white picket fence and two kids and a pet or two.  but something is different, i'm the ghost haunting your house. i'm not the man taking the kids to school or fucking you by the fireplace.  i'm the outsider, the person you trade stories about with the women at the tupperware parties, the high school boyfriend mentioned between conversations of promotions and anniversaries.  i will always be there, i will always rest my head on your sholder, feeling your breath on my neck when we sleep.

"event","ok so saturday my roommate randomly informs me that he's leaving. this was good because right beforehand, larkyn said she was coming up to chapel hill to visit me. i had to cancel plans with kate, but she watched britney spears...

so larkyn came over and we made out and decided to have sex.  little did i know that in the exchange of bodily fluids and orgasms that i had sealed my fate to go meet every single friend she had... and so i did. we went to emily's and hung out (larkyn promised to give me head for doing so) and emily is really sweet and pretty. these random ass drunk kids came in and everyone (with the exception of your dear narrator) discussed piercings and homosexuality. we left after two hours, and she gave me great great head after agreeing to meet up with another one of her friends, grayson.

so then we met up with grayson and it was fucking old and miserable but it was ok because there werent too many drunken intrusions at the pit.  larkyn and i got back and we watched wildboyz on mtv and she scratched my back, then my legs, and then we got the idea of videotaping her giving me head. so we did. and then we watched it.  then we cuddled for a really long time and i almost fell asleep on top of her. she is awesome, and def the best head i have ever ever gotten. and no one else can have her because she is mine. unless you're female... hmmm.

and then i went to sleep at 7 am. kate woke me up at 1 pm and we went to see ""secret window"" starring johnny depp. pretty interesting movie, though somewhat predictable. i still think pirates is his best movie. then i did some other stuff like going to class and bleh that's it. but anywayz kate and i were talking about my fav things in life in the movie theater so i will list them. (people and money are not mentioned).

1) receiving head

2) back rubs and scratches

3) red sour patch kids

4) sex

5) making out"

"event","ok so today i just slept really late, skipped all my classes and pretty much felt like shit all day. i watched reading rainbow with my clothes off, ate oatmeal and gatorade then showered after watching the travel channel. went and ate a turkey, lettuce, swiss and mayo bagel sandwich at alpine, then met up with denise on franklin street. we went to schoolkids, i bought a new sigur ros cd, an old blood brothers cd, and a really old reissue of radio berlin.

i ate again, not too much. studied at davis with cool girl layn. and that' been it, i still feel so fucking sick. UGH"

"event","so today i failed a psych exam... it sucked. i had a huge headache... it sucked. i got laid, it was great.  ummm yeah that's about it. on a lighter note, someone said i'm desolate... i hate that i am that despairing to people, especially those people who like to make fun of others and like to use words out of context. stupid fuck, you know who you are. hahaha pretty girls makes graves is next week... if i wasnt so desolate i'd prolly be excited about going."

"event","yeah so get up kids SUCKED. however, let's go over the list of who was there: Jessica, Tyler, Kurt, Kristin, Courtney, John, Michelle, Dustin, Orlando, Martin, Sam, Jimmy, Matt, Denise, Meghan, Hanin, Allison, Rachel, and Michael.  and i heard autumn was there, but i never saw her.  The first guy, rocky, was not very good. the second band, recover, tried to act a lot more hardcore than they were. their problem was a mediocre drummer, who couldnt play fast through an entire song. some kids tried ""moshing"" and as soon as i jumped in and showed em how they got out. fuckers. then when get up kids played i kept trying to race jimmy to the front and i was pushed into some kid and he fuckin punched me in the stomach. it was really funny when i started laughing at him and he left.  then later some guy fuckin elbowed me in the mouth and it started bleeding... not a big deal, but when some guy was elbowing my ribs, i told him to watch his fuckin elbows and he brought his fist out. what a cock sucker... these kids are so fucking clueless to show etiquette.

jimmy and i are cool now, and so are courtney and i. i met a lot of cool people, like some kid named nathan who could actually mosh. ahhh life is good right now.

"event","so here's my time for insightful comments about my life that i type with a certain reluctance because i'm not sure what people will think of me... the real me.  so my backspace key gets hit a lot, and i alter everything to sound intriguing and well, i just dont know anymore.

im tired of christi not talking to me. i cant get it off my mind.  fuck everyone else who's bailed on me, but i have only got in one fight with her ever.

now i'm lost...

the way things are going, i wouldnt be sad if i didnt wake up."

"event","i've read all these journals and thought it weird where people were so happy then the next day it seems as if their world ended, then the next day they were oblivious to what happened to them 24 hours prior.

this spring break has changed me. a fuckin week to myself and my world crumbled. how the fuck? i dont talk to jimmy or john anymore, jimmy being more shady than john.  i talked to roshan for the first time in months. i told christi about her ""friends"" and found out she's one of them. carin bailed on me, and i didnt get my work done.

and so fayetteville, with the constant black cloud always hanging over it, has chiseled it's way into my being again. the curse has struck, and it's never hurt this bad before. there's no one here for me anymore, no friends, no one to talk to. people have either changed or just recently unveiled their true personas. whatever the case, it's really fucked up and i am shell shocked.

the room was spinning after i got my lip pierced, most likely from adrenaline, and i had to sit down. that's my world right now, so chaotic that it seems i would have to step out of it and sort it out slowly and carefully- each problem its own entity, like untying a knot that's been weathered for years.

but the problem is, that it's MY WORLD, so no matter where i go my head is always in the midst of things and they're all orbitting around. no set direction or pace, just buzzing at my ears.it's too loud to humm away, too bright to blink out. i dont know what im going to do anymore. i havent a best friend, and i have not had one for years. no one is there, and i feel so fucking lonely.i reach my arms out and it's empty space, just empty space."

"event","ok so for the past 3 or so weeks drama has been buliding and leaving. i mean what is with high school and this drama. and to think it would be my so called best friend at the root of it all. some how i dont think she deserves that title anymore. she's just another friend add to the bunch of lairs, backstabbers, and betrayers. i mean it seriously hasnt changed. i mean i could deal with all that shit but she hit that heart with all of hers. i dont trust her at all anymore. i mean she's screwed our friendship and i told her that if she did what she is doing i would never be her friend again but she went and did it anyways...i see that i dont matter. she tells me all the bs that she would never do that because she values our friendship to much but damn her actions are speaking louder than her words. now i finally get why my parents say that to me. haha...kick in the ass. anyways...so yeah. its all over a boy to..how fucking gay on how to end a friendship...i mean whats that saying friends are forever boys are whatever. i guess i was never really a friend in the first place. i told her pretty much everything and trusted her. but like everytime i talked about liking a guy she was all oh look steph likes them lets go and take them adn make them like me adn leave her heart broken...this is the first time ive said this and ment it ""that fucking bitch."" i mean im even gonna have to fake everything at my prom so that it isnt hell. ok so get this prom story. i asked this guy he said he couldnt because his friend wanted him to go with some girl then omg 2 weeks later he's going with her. fucked up right, yeah i thought so too. i dont even want to go because i dont think i will be able to handle seeing them together. i mean ive seen them seperatly but together i might die. i mean thinking about it makes me sick to my stomach. so much for eatting...haha best diet ever...lol. jk. i hate this!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I CANT WAIT FOR HIGH SCHOOL TO END! i mean atleast i got a car this week so i dont have to be around her if i dont want to."

"event","omg i havent written in LJ in forever but since no one really knows i write here i guess its better. especially because my parents dont know about it. like myspace i got in trouble because they found it and read it. well lots has been going on i guess since the last time i actually wrote. i actually think i was still with my x the last time i wrote and a lot has changed since then. like im not with him. i still work at PJ's though. except there's lots of drama. stupid girls. i totally dont get them and i am one. how can someone have so much effing drama its so stupid and pointless. i guess i learned that the 1st 2 and a half years of high school and now im just sick of it all. i want it to be easy. the drama isnt even really at school its more at work but its the hs girls. figures huh? i dont know what to do i mean non of the guys im friends with pull this shit why cant girls just stop being so dramatic. yeah i can be but normally only once a month if that. it really depends on the mood of the week and all. im happy i have friends that are in college. the girls i know in college arent so effing dramatic and stupid. idk im venting. im also sick and dont really give a shit right now. but still i wonder how much crap is said about me. oh well talk is talk and idk i know the truth and some ppl do and if they cross me i can make their life hell to so i guess it works out. lol. um...lets see life. well i had a car and then i got hit by this guy i know josh and my car is totaled so my life pretty much is put on hold because i live in bfe. once again i cant wait to be 18. christmas is right around the corner and its hard to believe its been a year since most things happened or started. i miss some of my friends at sabino but like proven no one there gives a shit about me. thought i had friends and they all tend to stab me in the back. wow what a crazy pattern ive gotten into with all these ppl. i think the only person i really talk to is tyler. yeah he's the only cool one like that. lol. i talk to linds and ange but their both in college. woot. i dont its funny how ppl change and some change and they became bitches and some became nicer and idk ppl are weird i totally dont understand them. i really dont even know what im typing so if it doesnt make sence dont ask. let see...um...boys-they suck. i totally dont give a shit though because i shouldnt. its like oh your cool hey ill try a little...no stephanie dont try you'll fuck it up oh oh to late you tried its gone. damnit. yeah that sums that up. lol. wow its effing early in the morning. lets see my friend kristen ditched me for her CP friends like her friend kim ditched her for her boyfriend steve. funny. um...kas is cool but starting drama. brittany its awesome but we havent been talking. idk. and tracie totally rocks my socks lol. my cousin connie is having boy issues and falling in love again and im pretty sure she's scared (i would be to if i were her love is effing mess up). my parents arent fighting because im a fuck up anymore so thats good. i have to work christmas eve. BOO! but there are parties from the 26th to the 1st so thats good. im totally get smashed on new years eve. no matter what. woot!yeah idk thats it for now ill come back later to type more/ mwhahahah!"

You are quite distant from emotion and<br>people, but you have been made this way by one<br>thing or another. You are truly unique yet fail<br>to see it, and are quite creative be it in art,<br>music, writing, ect.. You used to let people in<br>now you don't even bother to try having been<br>hurt so many times in the past. Your attitude<br>is that you don't need anyone but yourself,<br>people are just trouble waiting to happen. But<br>you really do want to trust someone no matter<br>if you see it or not, deep down your waiting<br>for someone to come and set you free. This kind<br>of depression can turn dangerous, don't let<br>them get to you. Not everyone in the world will<br>hurt you, humans are humans and are not<br>perfect. So most likely sooner or later you'll<br>meet someone who feels like you do and perhaps<br>your shell will eventually disappear.

"event","I'm so sick of being home with this damn illness. Alex is getting frustrated all the time cuz he doesnt know when he gets to see me next and he really misses me and i really miss him and this being apart stuff is driving us both crazy. If i dont get to see him soon and i mean real so i might go insane. He told me he's been buying me stuff to. He spoils me so much. I just dont want him to spend a lot of money on me. Cuz im not exactly rich (well he isnt either) but i cant always buy him stuff. He says he like buying me stuff though. Its sweet. I love him so much and i really want to spend more time with him, and it doesnt help with me being so damn sick. Grrrrr... I want to get out of this house. But my mom freaks out that ill get sicker if i do to much stuff. And this medicine im taken makes you want to eat a lot. But ive lost weight. Yay! I lost 2 pounds in a week from being sick. Its a good diet but it sux cuz you cant do anything. Well im really tired so im gonna go sleep. ttyl!
PS ive been having all these cravings for Alex. Lol!"

It takes away the pain and the swelling kinda. I feel really bad for Alex though cuz he cant see me till im better or he has a ride up here. It makes me so depressed and miserable becuz i love him more than anything and want to make him happy but all this being apart just makes him frustered and i hate it. God i love him so much i cant even discribe it. I would give anything for him. I already have given him my totaland complete love. Sometimes when i tell him i love him i get goosebumps or my heart does this weird tingly thing. And its never happen to me before so this has to be true love. I cant wait till im 18 and Alex and I can live together!"

"event","god i feel like shit and it keeps getting worse and im sick of it. My head feels like its gonna fall off. Im so miserable and i miss Alex and he's mad cuz i was supposed to see him today but i woke up at 2am and didnt go back to sleep till 6am. Nothing helps with the pain anymore either. Plus now my stomach hurts cuz i take all this medicine but i dont eat enough. But eating hurts my thoart to much, I hate feeling like this. I wish i was better so I could get on with my life instead of being stuck at home in pain. Plus yeterrday i had to have blood taken to test to see if i have mono. Only good thing about mono once you have it you cant have it again. But still there is no medicine for it and it takes forever to feel better. I still dont know if I have it though. I probably wont even go to school for the rest of the week if I keep feeling like this. ARGggg...."

So i guess my mom hates when i sleep in cuz I want to sleep cuz im tired and still kinda sick (stupid thoart) so i slept till 11am and she comes in a starts bitchin at me for no reason actually its cuz i slept in and had stuff to do. So I woke up, cried and did all the shit she wanted me to which only took me an hour. im so pissed at her and then like this afternoon she's trying to be all nice to me cuz she knows she was being a bitch. Im sick of this shit. I cant wait till i can drive and never be home! YAY!

So Alex and I are trying to plan a way for him to get up here and its difficult but all he has to do is get half way. So he called Josh last night and Josh was all call me tomorrow dude. So Alex did and but no one answered and he got real pissed. Cuz by the time someone did answer Josh left for work. Alex was bumbed which made me sad like yesterrday he was really frustrated and he sounded so sad and angry on the phone, I cried so much yesterrday. Then he eventually cheered me up at like 10pm. Then I was supposed to ask Tiff and I imed her and she was all I dunno its far and its really not at all. So me and her got in a fight which sucked cuz i hate fighting with her. I feel better though. So she gonna try and ask Josh. Otherwise Alex says he's gonna take the bus and I really dont want him to. He's trying so hard to get a job and I'm gonna look asap. Alex was so cute he's like I'm gonna get a job and save for a car so I can see you everyday he's all I dont care about gas money. I'm like awww... I need to get my grades up and get a job so I get a car and I need my permit. LOL! Well I hope I get to see him tomorrow cuz I babysit all saturday and sunday i have to go to the library actually he can go with me if he cant come till then. But he really wants to come tomorrow. I miss him so much. I love him to death and really want to tell him that but im afraid to. Even though I'm pretty sure he loves me."

Then he left and I cried. But yesterrday totally sucked. It was V-day and me and Alex really wanted to see each other so I asked Tiff if her and josh wanted to come up here and bring Alex I could see him. She said she'd talk to Josh. So i called her after school and she wsa all me and josh decided not to. I was like whatever got off the phone and cried. Because if I was in her shoe's andhad a car and she called me asking that I would do it in a heart beat cuz she's like my sister and i love her. But i guess it was to much to ask of her. Even though she said her and josh were probably goin to the mts and its the same distance there as it is to my home. God living in BFE sux major f***ing ass. I never get to do whatever cuz rides and all that bs. I want to live in town and be close to everything and everyone, not way out here with no one around. I was so sad and pissed yesterrday I cried for 2hrs and Alex tried to cheer me up, and i feel bad becuz i was cring to him and it made him kinda sad. And now I wanna cry again cuz i miss him with all my heart. And would die if I lost him. Well g2g."

This day marks the 4th year my grandpa was stolen from me I'll never know why God took him from he but he did. I still cry (but it seems I cry more today then everyother time i think about my grandpa). I miss him! I also miss Alex (bf). I havent even seen him today and it makes me sad! I cried! I have never loved someone the way I love him. All I have to do is see his number when he calls me on the phone and I light up with a smile on my face. The thing I is how Tiff and Josh see each other everyday and night and  they complain when their apart for like an hour and I get to see Alex maybe once a week or not even that. Its not fair. Stupid Parents and their rules. Well lets see whats new besides today. Um... school sux ass and I only need 4 more credits to graduate and I want to go to TA to graduate early and my mom wont let me but I have a summer and the rest of the year to convince her. I need a job cuz I'm broke. I have a math test tomorrow damn it! LOL! Oh well dont care. Mr. Shulter's mean to me and only yells at me when I'm talking or something but not anyone on else. ts fucked up. ARG...

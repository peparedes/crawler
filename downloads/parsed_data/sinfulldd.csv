I think its messed up that i can't just post on myspace, or look at my facebook account without having to go through lots of proxies. Personally its bullshit.<br />I'm in a generally good mood today, which is odd considering I'm at work.&nbsp;<br />I had a pretty good morning with the kids today. I didn't feed the baby before I took him to the sitter's&nbsp; this morning-does that make me a bad parent?&nbsp;I knew if I had moved him around a whole bunch he would just wake up and be even more pissed off. He didn't have a very good night.<br />He woke up around 230am, looking for some food of course. I nursed him, and he just wasn't in the mood. So I gave in and got up and made a bottle for him-he drank 1 oz. and then just cried and cried. I changed his pamper and double checked that he wasn't to hot or injured. But he just cried and cried. Finally at 4am, he fell asleep. It was a magical silence! So I didn't want to disturb him at 545am. I wish I could have gotten more sleep myself, but you know the saying ""the needs of the many out weigh the needs of the few""<br />Man I'm tired of being the few. *pouts*<br />More later</font>"

Category: Food and Restaurants 


So as I sat there at my booth looking off into space, and by space I mean the bar...I wondered, Does anyone I know come to this place? Does anyone know about Laterna?  


The is the bar at Laterna. Its rather well stocked. Carol was our waitress and bartender, she's niffty!


There are numerous bottles of spirits....just dying to be drank by all of you over 21! 

Do people truly know the caliber of food that they are missing out on? Greek food is wonderful. There are also TONS of Americanesque alternative. Unfortunately there are NO chicken tenders on the adult menu...sorry 'Hanna. I have never looked at the kids menu, but I saw some kid eating a bowl of spagehtti...so its possible.

They have a 40.00 bottle of Merlot that I am going to drink next time I go. I'll be wearing better shoes in case I get sauced.


For all of you anit-big corporation people, you'll be glad to know that Laterna is a locally owned restaurant. The man has lived in Wilmington NC for quite some time, he's actually got another restaurant in town. There's a brief history on the owner and his family on the back of the menu. Check it out, its actually interesting. 

So until then, enjoy this great place. Laterna. Its where Perkins used to be, so you already know where its at! They're open from 11am-12am every weekday, and from 11a-2am on the weekends. 

They serve breakfast, lunch, and dinner. They've got a huge selection of food that I can't pronounce, but tastes really great. I am currently using the caveman style of ordering from the menu...pointing and staring at her, hoping she can get the hint. I can however tell her that I want Hummus, Spanikopita, Tzazti, and Greek Salad. How American of me. Why is it that I keep trying to pronounce Greek words with an Italian accent? They're not the same! Damn my ignorance! 

Come, eat, be merry!"

Current mood:  depressed 
Category: Life 


I feel like screaming. I feel overwhelmed. I feel that I have nobody to talk with. I feel alone. I feel trivial. I feel sad. I feel like I'm not important. What happened to my anniversary? Perhaps I shouldn't ask, because that just makes you want to do it less right?

Am I really overly dramatic? Is it bad to cry because you're going to miss someone? Is it my fault that I have feelings and emotions, and some people don't? Should I not feel in front of them? What do I do?

I feel like cutting again, but I can't because she's here. I just wish I could blink out of existance, but then who would take care of her? 

Have I really put that much more on my plate? I have more responsibilty than I should. I can't do this all by myself. I need help. I want help. But there's no help for me, is there. 

I need touch. Its always about that, yeah think that to yourself. Its all I ever want, yeah. Just a simple hug, its not much to ask for. Hug me without sighing deeply, am I that disgusting? 

Maybe its not me that has a problem. Maybe its you. Wouldn't it be awesome to know that all along, I wasn't crazy? And I only ever thought I was because you made me feel that way?"

"event","Well today was disappointing. Here's a hint for couples. If you don't see each other often, don't get anyone's hopes up. Don't wake a person up after you get off work, for nothing. If you tell them earlier that day that you've got to get some rest before work (fine), and that ""we always have tonight""...man just don't fucking lie. Don't pretend that all of a sudden its weird that your partner's pissed. First off, don't wake them up, because most likely they're expecting it, because you told them. Don't act like a fucking slow kid when they get disappointed. I know its not nice to ask for sex, but when it seems that is the only way a person gets it...well, you could probably see why they do. 
I feel ridiculous. I feel like the ugliest person alive. Am I so horrible that even the man who ""says he loves me"" doesn't want to touch me. The only time he seems to want to do anything is when he knows that I can't. Like in the middle of the day when my daughter's awake. Yeah, great fucking timing. But then I'm the asshole who doesn't put out right? Fuck you. Don't tell me that we'll have tonight...if all you do is come home eat a bowl of cereal, pee, and go to bed. Don't ask me if I'm pissed. You HAVE to know that I am. You have to at least understand why. But you don't. You have no idea why I'm acting all cold, do you. God! It must be great to be such an idiot. I can't tell you why I'm angry, because it gets me nowhere. The only thing it does is piss you off. I don't expect you to hang out with me all the time. But when I see you for only 30 mins the whole day, and 25 of those minutes you're preoccupied...how am I supposed to feel. No wonder I feel so unimportant. No wonder I feel like I'm just around for sex. Because when it comes time for you to want or have sex, you make sure that you get it don't you. Because if I don't put out, I feel like you'll just find some other girl to fuck. Then you wonder why I feel like I'm just around for sex. That's why. You say we talk, but we don't. Its mostly me babbling about something you don't give a shit about. Maybe your father's right...maybe I'm just not good enough for you? Maybe if I was you'd act like you gave a fuck about me. Don't just tell me you love me...show me. Make me feel like I matter to you more than just when we're having sex. You don't have to tell me that ""sex last night was awesome"" especially if I'm already feeling like that's all I am to you. You go on and on about how great the sex was...great. Now if only you could be that excited about everything else in our ""relationship"". I don't think you'd ever stand up for me. If you dad was talking shit about me in front of you, you'd let him wouldn't you? Yeah, show's how much you really care. Does it not bother you that I seem to think the world of you and love you and do EVERYTHING for you, and you...all you do is fuck me once in awhile and pay 1/2 the bills, and not even 1/2. I'm never going to be good enough for you. Today you'll go to class, come home and ""be tired"" and sleep before  you have to get up and go to work. You won't get off work until 9am. Then you'll need a nap before a meeting at 12...and I'll have to leave around then. I won't get back in town till at least 6pm, no matter how fast I'm driving. It may even be 7pm. Great...then you'll be asleep. You'll wake up at 8 to be at work at 9...I won't see you again until 9am. Right, why do we even live together? I may as well move out. I never see you. When I do you're always fucking tired or in a bad mood. You never act like my presence is the one you want. I""m sorry I'm not as good as Elizabeth. Obviously she was soo fucking great. I feel that you're not over her. Its not fair to me. Its not fair to our relationship. Perhaps I am the crazy one, and I'm imagining this. But then why do you still talk to her? Why do you go to her myspace page daily? Why does she still call you? Why do you bother keeping in contact with someone who treated you like such shit, and me...I get treated like shit. I'm the one who's been here for you. I'm the one who treats you better than you've ever been treated. But that's not good enough for you is it? You want to be left alone. You want to be sad. You want to be degraded. Well, I'm not doing that. If that's what you want-then go back to that ugly redheaded bitch. Don't waste my fucking time. Its always about this isn't it. I feel inadequate. You never do do you? You just walk around with this stupid inflated sense of self. You make me sick. Everything's not okay. Why do you act like it is? You'll wake up in the morning, I'll still be pissed. You'll act like nothing ever happened. I won't forget. I bet after class, you won't spend any time with us. You'll be ""too tired"". Fine. I don't care. Perhaps I should find someone else to spend my time with, someone who's willing to make the sacrafice to make me happy. Because obviously you're not. You're too worried about Elizabeth and how her life is going. Your life is right here. You should pay more attention to it, before its gone. A person will only stick around for so long. Remember that."

"event","SO my last blog was to someone really great. Let me tell you about how my V-day went:

I got up later than I wanted to, he calls: Just wanted to make sure you're up

Got to work, work sucked, ran errands, accidentally rented the same movie he did-trying to surprise him

Went to Honda to make an appt, went to the bank to take out more than I wanted to (pouts)

I get home, he starts rattling things off that he wants me to do, he's getting settled in as well.

I do these things, because they're no problem at all. Fill the cat dish, and something else-oh get him a drink....

I open the fridge door...HOLY SHIT!!!!



To my surprise there sits: 1 baker's dozen of red roses, 1 video I was dying to see, and 1 big bottle of Crown Royal Reserve (I love Crown-I'm gangsta I know)

I just look at these items for a second...do I really see them? I had all but abandoned the idea that I would receive anything for this ""holiday"", because frankly I didn't think I deserved it. I haven't been myself for awhile, and I'm finally getting my brains back in my head-slowly but surely.

So, as I stand here looking at these things (keep in mind he's pretended that nothings up the whole time) my heart just about explodes, my eyes get all watery, my lip quivers...I think I'm going to pass out. I guess people do listen to me when I talk-sometimes. 

I am enraptured with this man, he never ceases to amaze me with the things he does. I remember telling him a long time ago: I wish I could just cut you open and wear you and be inside of you...*sigh* I feel great for the first time in a good long while. I just want to say ""Thanks a bunches honey sugar pie-ooh, I know you hate it when I call you that"" 

My roses hang in front of the door, I'm drying the bouquet, soon I will buy a vase just for them. I love him, not because of these items, but because he took the time to even consider my feelings for a split second. Thanks darling...I love you!"

"event","What do you do when all you feel is saddness? When all you're trying to do in your life is make things right? When you're told that you should just go with the flow of things, and not control life. Life, pffft! I'm in a place where all I want to do is cry. There is anger, there is anxiety, there is saddness, there is uncertainty, there are other people involved. God, I just wish that maybe I could go with the flow of things...and just be. I change things thinking that they'll get better. I don't talk about ""feelings"" so much because maybe I don't want to have them. No, I don't want you to know that I'm crazy in love with you. No, I don't want you to know that I don't think I'm right for you. No, I don't want you to find anyone else. No, I don't want you to BE with anyone else. And NO, I don't want to have to just be. I don't know what the fuck I want anymore. I thought I'd be happier this way. I thought that things would still honestly just stay the same ""without the title"". But God knows, I knew they wouldn't. I knew that as soon as I gave a little that it would happen. I think that's why I gave a little. Its like trying to just give the inevitable a little help. You're not happy one way or the other. I'm confused. We were dandy as candy before you made me talk. I'm sorry that the old me came out a little. WTF did you expect. You didn't expect me to make the choice I made, but I did because I thought you'd be happier. I am scared that I'm gonna lose you to someone else...someone a lot like her. I don't know what to do. The thought of you even touching her sends shivers down my spine, and not the good kind...the kind that send your hairs raising. I just want to ball up and cry. I'm sooooo goddamned confused about everything. I want to be with you. I do, really. I just don't know if I can ""handle"" the way you like to live your life. I'm scared shitless...that you'll ""befriend"" someone and then the end. You say it won't happen that way...but I bet it would if your someone wanted it to be. I don't want to end the way the last one did. I am better, I am stronger...and I am a good person. But for me, I can't ever just get what I deserve. I must've screwed up along time ago...to get what I'm getting now. I don't know. I just want things to be the way they were before I opened up my mouth and decided to be an idiot. But you are happier this way. I guess I just have to accept it, if I want to be with you."

"event","So this week my boyfriend of a year and I have decided that we are no longer ""boyfriend/girlfriend"". He has decided that when you put that ""title"" on a relationship it ruins things. It ruins things in his opinion because then its like property. He says he feels like I own him, and that he's just a piece of furniture or something. Not fair for him to say. SO in turn I decided not to fight the obvious any longer. Its painfully clear that our relationship is not ever going to be the way I would like it, even after the compromises we've made. So I gave him what he wanted, friendship. I admit it was painful, because although this is a pointless relationship...its all I've known for the last year. And sadly enough, I do love him. Why? I couldn't tell you though. So for now on I have to get used to saying my ""friend"" instead of boyfriend. But its hard for him to understand that ""friend"" is a completely different thing for me. I don't just have sex with my friends...they're JUST FRIENDS! Now I've become ""distant and hesitant to show affection"", well I don't usually do that with my friends. I think I'm just scared to have 100% feelings in this because I don't think that we'll make it throughout the year. Its just hard.  
MOVING ON
Sunday night I threw him a party. It was a mildly wild keg, very small group...like less than 15 people. So small for the size I'm used to throwing. So everything's going great at the party: people are drinking and having fun, beer supply is apt, music is good, weather is perfect...but then I notice something, Kendrick's (that's his name) Josh wasn't there. Well for everyone who doesn't know Josh, I'll enlighten you as to why I thought this was important. Josh used to work with Kendrick at Harris Teeter. When I first moved in with Kendrick-strictly as a roommate-Josh was the guy I was head over-heels for! Josh is a great guy. Kinda looks like Keanu Reeves-who if you didn't know I have a total hard on for!!!! I thought the world of Josh. So I asked Kendrick to you know ""hook me up"". Well, later I found out that Josh thought I was creepy and stalking him. Didn't like me like that, and didn't even want to talk to me as a friend or anything to do with me. So of course me being who I am took it with a grain of salt and decided ""well, fuck Josh!"" But I've still always crushed on Josh, when I see him I get butterflies, my palms get sweaty, my pupils dialate...I'm like totally electric. (boogie woogie!) SO I call Josh and invite him to this party, because Kendrick ""forgot"" to do so. Josh gets there, and yay me!, he's having a great time. The whole night Kendrick's not really been talking to me or hanging out with me like all the other couples are, so I decide that damnit I want a man to cuddle up with. SO while Josh is talking to Kendrick, I put my arm around his waist and hug him. Josh is like 6'1 maybe 6'3, dunno tall as hell its great because my head is right by his heart...I love that. Josh hugs me back, and since I didn't move immediately away after the hug (like I usually would) he kept his arm around me. WOW! Not only was this the first time I ever touched Josh, but the first time he's ever touched me. Man alive! He kept his arm around me for like 4 hours really. With the hand that was over my shoulders/behind my back, we held hands. He rubbed my hand, I grazed his back with my nails under his jacket. For like 4 hours I got to laugh in his armpit, be held when I was cold...it was like he was meant for ME! Of course we talked, and I asked him about how he felt about me...that whole creepy/stalker issue. Come to find out-HE NEVER SAID ANYTHING LIKE THAT! So this leads me to instantly like him so much more, because no I know that he doesn't think I'm a total fruit. For the first time in like 6 months I was happy. All my saddness and depression melted away. I felt like I used to in high school...GRRRREAT! When I got home I called Josh to make sure he got home okay, and vice versa. We talked a bit, it was nice. Then I decided to ask him to a movie. And his response- *bad brakes sound effect* ""Yeah it'd be cool to catch a movie with you and I guess Kendrick"" *glass shattering sound effect* With Kendrick?! Damnit...am I really that off as to how feelings are here? You flirt with me, very much so ALL night and then that? What the hell am I supposed to do? Ugh...I'm confused. So I told him I'd give a call someday this week, I thought Weds...but I was tipsy and a lot was going on in the background at my apt (drunk people) and I didn't catch what time he said he wanted me to call. Damn! So I don't realize this until Monday night around 11pm. So, in great creepy/stalker fashion, I call. He's not there so I left a message that I called. Bet he's gonna be like damn I told that girl to call WEDS not now. Ugh, hopefully things go swell. 
Gotta go shop...more next time...stay tuned."

"event","So I've had crazy dreams lately and well things aren't going as well as they could go in the fantasy land. Most recent dream:
Walking with a tribe from I don't know where, I am going to assume that they were Gallic, only by the way we were talking. Well were walking along this dense wood, trying to find the cure for Angelina Jolie, who just happens to be the princess Gladriel-from LOTR-, who has been poisoned by extreme exposure to methane gas. So we have this makeshift cart, made of young trees and rope, been drug behind the Budweiser horses-Klaisdales?-, and she's on it, surrounded by a mosquito net of red. Her robes were all in red, her shoes were black. Her hair was long, and the ends were starting to turn white, with her sickness. Her eyes were not they're usual color, instead they were turning red. But nonetheless, there's hardly a picture I could paint with words that would describe her majestic nature even in a dream, where she's in critical condition. So to steal another seen from LOTR-the one where the elves are migrating to the ship-we are in the same kind of procession. Only the aura that surrounds us is not of white and fairey majick...its of war and passion. Apparently we're a warring tribe, and we kill savagely...most of the time for the sheer entertainment value. So to look at our tribe, clad in red robes, our lanterns shine with a crimson light...and then to see this glorious tent-if you will-we are art in action. We walk through the woods for what seems like forever, and then we come across a section of the forrest that is made of bamboo and parsnips. I know, they don't even grow in the same climate, and there's no way to explain why parsnips were about 4-6 feet tall, but they were. As we walk through this forrest, we have to pick parsnip to save the Princess, but it can only be the purest white variety. As we pick our parsnips, we come across the mage that is to help us. His tower is magnificent! His tower towers the tower of Saurmun! Its a huge marble tower, but the marble is red. Imagine if you will a topographic map of a dense forest, and smack in the middle is this huge tower of red marble. Above it swirls purple and black clouds. No matter how menacing it looks, your eyes can't help but look at it. You're drawn to it, entranced by it, called. 
When you enter the tower, there's a serious of rooms, its like a labyrinth. This maze has consequences though, every wrong step is a minute of life drained from the princess.
 -Random jump in memory-
The Princess is in a beaker, full of what can only be described as Tang. She stands there while the mage carefully slices pieces of parsnip. She seems to float in some kind of animated suspension. Its terrifying and we, the red robed ones, are all around in a circle, chanting. Chanting, chanting in a Gregorian type song...images of Dark Ages monks come to mind-mind you apparently this happens prior to that.
And suddenly I awake!
Grumpy and groggy...but also saddened. I feel as though I could cry any minutes. But I do not, because there is no need to do so.
But I thought I'd share that with you."

Just to watch you be seen
I could almost go there
Just to live in a dream

But no I won't go for any of those things
To not touch your skin is not why I sing
I can't help myself
I've got to see you again

I could almost go there
Just to watch you be seen
I could almost go there
Just to live in a dream

No I won't go to share you with them
But oh even though I know where
you've been
I can't help myself
I've got to see you again

***Hyper Ballad (Bjork)-
we live on a mountain
right at the top
there's a beautiful view
from the top of the mountain
every morning i walk towards the edge
and throw little things off
like:
car-parts, bottles and cutlery
or whatever i find lying around

it's become a habit 
a way
to start the day

i go through this 
before you wake up
so i can feel happier
to be safe up here with you

it's real early morning
no-one is awake
i'm back at my cliff
still throwing things off
i listen to the sounds they make
on their way down
i follow with my eyes 'til they crash
imagine what my body would sound like
slamming against those rocks

and when it lands
will my eyes
be closed or open?

i'll go through all this
before you wake up
so i can feel happier
to be safe up here with you

***I love you (Sarah MacLachlan)-
I have a smile
stretched from ear to ear
to see you walking down the road

we meet at the lights
I stare for a while
the world around disappears

just you and me
on this island of hope
a breath between us could be miles

let me surround you
my sea to your shore
let me be the calm you seek

oh and every time I'm close to you
there's too much I can't say
and you just walk away

and I forgot
to tell you
I love you
and the night's
too long
and cold here
without you 
I grieve in my condition
for I cannot find the strength to say I need you so

oh and every time I'm close to you
there's too much I can't say
and you just walk away

and I forgot
to tell you
I love you
and the night's
too long
and cold here
without you

***Mr. Jones (Counting Crows)-
I was down at the New Amsterdam staring
at this yellow-haired girl
Mr. Jones strikes up a conversation with this
black- haired flamenco dancer
She dances while his father plays guitar
She's suddenly beautiful
We all want something beautiful
man I wish I was beautiful
So come dance this silence down through the morning
Cut up, Maria! Show me some of them Spanish dances
Pass me a bottle, Mr. Jones
Believe in me
Help me believe in anything
cause I want to be someone who believes
Mr. Jones and me tell each other fairy tales
and we st are at the beautiful women
""She's looking at you. Ah, no, no, she's looking at me.""
Smiling in the bright lights
Coming through in stereo
When everybody loves you, you can never be lonely
I will paint my picture
Paint myself in blue and red and black and gray
All of the beautiful colors are very very meaningful
Gray is my favorite color
I felt so symbolic yesterday
If I knew Picasso
I would buy myself a gray guitar and play
Mr. Jones and me look into the future
Stare at the beautiful women
""She's looking at you.
, I don't think so. She's looking at me.""
Standing in the spotlight
I bought myself a gray guitar
When everybody loves me, I will never be lonely
I will never be lonely
I will never be lonely
I want to be a lion
Everybody wants to pass as cats
We all want to be big big stars, but we all got different
reasons for that
Believe in me because I don't believe in anything
and I want to be someone to believe
Mr. Jones and me stumbling through the barrio
Yeah we stare at the beautiful women
""She's perfect for you, Man, there's got to be
somebody for me.""
I want to be Bob Dylan
Mr. Jones wishes he was someone just a little more
funky
When everybody loves you, son, that's just about as
funky as you can be
Mr. Jones and me staring at the video
when I look at the television, I want to see me staring
right back at me
We all want to be big stars, but we don't know why
and we don't know how
But when everybody loves me, I'm going to be just
about as happy as I can be
Mr. Jones and me, we're gonna be big stars...

***Sour Times (Portishead)-
To pretend no one can find
The fallacies of morning rose
Forbidden fruit, hidden eyes
Curtises that I despise in me
Take a ride, take a shot now

Cos nobody loves me
Its true
Not like you do

Covered by the blind belief
That fantasies of sinful screens
Bear the facts, assume the dye
End the vows no need to lie, enjoy
Take a ride, take a shot now

Cos nobody loves me
Its true
Not like you do

Who oo am I, what and why
Cos all I have left is my memories of yesterday
Ohh these sour times

Cos nobody loves me
Its true
Not like you do

After time the bitter taste
Of innocence decent or race
Scattered seeds, buried lives
Mysteries of our disguise revolve
Circumstance will decide ....

Cos nobody loves me
Its true
Not like you do

Cos nobody loves me
Its true
Not like you
Nobody loves.. me
Its true
Not, like, you.. do"

"event","Ever just wanted to be noticed? 
Ever just wanted to be seen?
Ever done something for someone, and they don't see it?
Hoping to surprise them, and end up disappointed?

You get that sick feeling in your body.
Almost like you're gonna cry.
But there's no reason to cry.
Do they realize what you've done?

That sick feeling grows in you. 
You don't know what to do with it.
You want to scream.
But you can't.
It does nothing.

Tiny cuts in the skin.
Help to let freedom in.
Drops of blood make you laugh.
The pain is release.

Humiliation is the closest word for that feeling.
Plunging on the top of a roller coaster.
How your stomach jumps. 
That's the feeling of disappointment.

But there's guilt in this disappointment.
There's an excuse for nonchalantly brushing me aside.
Rest.  Tired.  Sleepy.
Yah, I'm selfish.
You're not a toy.

So torn between wanting to feel angry and understanding.
""You look nice""-Thanks.
The look on my face could have broken a million hearts.
But yours was tired.

If I understand, why does it hurt?
If I'm compassionate, why does it hurt?
If I'm good, why don't you care?
I want to leave and never come back, but I can't.

I can't hurt you.
You can hurt me."

"event","HA!
Just when bitches thought they'd put me in a hard spot, I have managed to slip out unscathed. I will end up better than I am now...minus one thing, the man I love. But hey that's okay. 
""You know what people like you call guys like me? I'm the bad guy...say hello to the bad guy!""
Yah that's right...you want him so bad? YOU should have treated him better when you had him...now he's loving on me.
Well I'm moving, but know that you've won nothing...I move so you don't get the satisfaction of starting a scene. Everytime you try to do something that would make our lives difficult...I won't submit. You lose. In everything you do. You can't win. Because if worse comes to worse, and I lose him, I still won't have lost...because you can't make someone love you. God you're stupid...and I'll be glad when you're gone. I'm tired of you and all the psychotic drama you bring with you because you think for some reason in your sick little head that he still wants to be with you in a relationship and would eventually marry you...you're pathetic. 
And now you lose."

"event","i have a smile
stretched from ear to ear
to see you walking down the road

we meet at the lights
i stare for a while
the world around disappears

just you and me
on this island of hope
a breath between us could be miles

let me surround you
my sea to your shore
let me be the calm you seek

oh and every time i'm close to you
there's too much i can't say
and you just walk away

and i forgot
to tell you
i love you
and the night's
too long
and cold here
without you
i grieve in my condition
for i cannot find the strength to say i need you so

"event","You know, I know you read this..and I wonder why! 
Why didn't you tell her?! WHY! Damnit, now I have to defend myself in the morning. This is a battle I am not looking forward to. I didn't tell her we were dating to piss her off, she asked and I said ""I guess."" She gets upset, give you a good inkling as to why! You didn't fucking tell her! Why, do I feel upset?! Why am I also hurt by this? I understand why she's upset...she's been misled. Does she know for how long she has been misled? I bet not. I leave you to do all the ""work"" in this situation, but it turns out that you haven't been doing any of the work at all. I consider this ""draggin ass"" on things. You were supposed to smooth things over, but all you've done was wrinkle it more. How was I supposed to know that you didn't tell her? Why didn't you tell her? Didn't you think that, that little bit of information would be prudent? What were you thinking? Now, once again...I AM THE BAD GUY!!!!
Damnit, why am I always the bad guy? I didn't do anything wrong this time...I finally had her in a good mood, but oh...wait...what's this...YOU DIDN'T TELL HER THE ABSOLUTE TRUTH!
It makes me wonder if I know the truth as well? Do I? I mean you have this wonderful way of telling me that everything is going to be okay, truth is we couldn't be farther from that. 
So now she's pissed, and going to move out. Way to keep that issue from blowing up...nice. 
You may wonder why I am so angry. Well, considering our pass conversations, and the feelings that you make me have, I think I have every fucking reason to be upset. Here I am thinking the whole time that I am the bad guy, but no, its not me! Are you sure she even knew that we've been fucking since December? Since I moved in? I don't think she does. Don't you think she should have? It's really not my place to tell her these things, but I can't stop her from reading this journal. But then I don't guess I should have posted it should I?
Here I was thinking that this is the closest we've ever been...and I'm a secret. A shadow, an underlying thought...that maybe you'd get a chance to mention. 
I am sorry if this letter hurts you, but you have no fucking idea how much a ""slap in the face"" that was. Its nice of you to keep people abreast of their lives. 
I am angry, as if you didn't notice. I will get over it. I know I'll be getting alot more angry, because now you have to back track. Now you have to reassure her that ""blah, blah, blah"" and its going to piss me off. I'm not going to pretend or lie that it won't piss me off. I'm letting you know in advanced. God, I thought you would have been alot more careful with this situation, you knew it was delicate, and yet...yet it was not handled as such. I don't know...I'm venting...You're mine. But now I feel that you will reconsider this, I didn't mean to ""rat you out"". I just thought that you'd told her. No fucking wonder she feels so confused, she has every fucking right. Here she is thinking that she's ""being replaced. You & his schedule matches up, you have more fun than we've had in along time, I just feel bad. I know its irrational, but I just feel like I'm being replaced."" And here I am ""you're not being replaced. He's made that abundantly clear, I have fun with alot of people that I am around"".
We talked about things that have been going on this week, and how you got upset about me calling you ungratefull, and about the grocery shopping, and then something else was said *don't really remember* then she flat out asked, ""are you guys dating?"" I said, ""I guess, I don't really know"", because all of a sudden I got the distinct feeling that you DIDN""T TELL HER! So then she gets pissed *totally understandably* and says ""well I guess I have to Fucking move out don't I?!"" I tried to console her...but there was nothing I could say. I said ""Are you mad at me? What's wrong?!"" She says,""How nice of him to fucking inform me. Its just like him not to let anyone know."" 
I don't know what to do. I am angry, but at the same time I feel bad for her. I just don't understand what made you think that she wouldn't find out before you were ready? She says she's been asking you for quite sometime, and you've negated the fact that anything was going on. I don't know how I should feel. 
I'll tell you I don't feel very happy/nice inside right now."

"event","I tried so hard, my dear, to show
that you're my every dream
Yet you're afraid each thing I do
Is just some evil scheme

A memory from your lonesome past
keeps us so far apart
Why can't I free your doubtful mind
and melt your cold, cold heart? 

Another love, before my time, 
made your heart sad an' blue, 
and so my heart is paying now 
for things I didn't do 

In anger, unkind words are said 
that make the teardrops start 
Why can't I free your doubtful mind
And melt your cold, cold heart?

There was a time when I believed
that you belonged to me
but now I know your heart is shackled
to a memory

The more I learn to care for you
the more we drift apart
Why can't I free your doubtful mind
and melt your cold, cold heart?"

"event","Well this is the first entry on this, hope it works...if not I'll just have to try it again. I'm here listening to some music...looking up some interesting things about birth control b/c I'm a girl and I wanna know the best of the best before I settle for second best. You know, gotta be sure I'm not paying too much...then I'd really be white huh?! 
So far here's what I've come up with: 

*The boring ass pill that I choke down every day at the same time- 
95 to 99.9%effective 
The pill may add to your risk of heart disease, including high blood pressure, blood clots, and blockage of the arteries. If you are over age 35 and smoke, or have a history of blood clots or breast or endometrial cancer, your health care provider may advise you not to take the pill.(I smoke!!) 

*The ""Copper T IUD""- 
99%effective 
yah...sounds like soo much effin fun...but it works for 10 years...the arms of the Copper T IUD contain some copper, which stops fertilization by preventing sperm from making their way up through the uterus into the fallopian tubes. If fertilization does occur, the IUD would prevent the fertilized egg from implanting in the lining of the uterus 

*The ""Progestasert IUD""- 
98%effective 
Um, yah only it lasts one year...The progesterone causes the cervical mucus to thicken so sperm cannot reach the egg, and so that a fertilized egg cannot successfully implant into the lining of the uterus. 

*The ""Intrauterine System or IUS""- 
99%effective 
Again the same, but for 5 years, and it releases a small amount of a hormone each day to keep you from getting pregnant. 

*Depo-Provera- 
99.7% effective 
A shot every 3 months...Prolonged use of the drug may result in significant loss of bone density. This bone loss is greater the longer the drug is used. (NICE) 

So you can understand the huge decisions that need to be made. IUS sounds good for right now, that or the copper IUD...has the best chance of getting done. It's just getting them in that you have to worry about. Considering they go into the uterus...yah..I hope that the numb ya up or something when the do that...doesn't sound too damn fun. Oh well, all in a days work for women though right?"

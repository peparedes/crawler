"event","this weekend totally sucked.. lets c i got grounded and well.. lets just say everything else went wrong. My parents are so messed up... cant wait till i can move out. I also figured out that i should probably just move to the amish country. Yeehaw! a farm girl.. doesn't that sound like fun=( i finally finished my gov. power point and i gotta say its not that bad. I hope i can at least get a b on it. i really need it. They sorta moved me up a half a lane in swimming...so i guess i'm not getting any worse.. which i have to say is kinda cool. 


btw.. thanks jimmy"

"event","... i had driving school and i have to say.. rosie and emily u too are way toooo funny! i had an awesome time. Today was kool, but idk, i think one of my ""use to be good friends"" hates me. 
Im kinda upset, it seems now that she like this kid ( who by the way totally ignores me now) and doesnt have to be with us everyday at practice, she seems to have changed. I really dont understand what her problem is.. but w/e. but not letting that ruin my day... omg rosie i havent found anyone yet.. but im still looking... but u kno swimmers are really hottt espectially -----, and oh yah i guess im now over jimmy and then other one well... b/c hes a senior and hes leaving i guess ill just find someone else...

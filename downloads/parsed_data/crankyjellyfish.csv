Holly is now moving in my room with me, and in a few months we are moving to LA together!!!!!  This is going to be a shockingly crazy change!  LA here I come"

"event","A few days ago I was playing with his dog Slick, and I said Slickers what am I going to do without you?  Dean quickly retorted that he had already offered the roommate position to me but, it would have to be completely pleutonic.  I told him we can hardly do that now, and I am nowhere near ready to do that to myself.  I have come to a point where I am at a loss for what to do.  His Bar exam is tuesday through thursday, I am taking care of his dog for that time.  After he is done with the Bar I am he is going to be reintroduced to the wild where undoubtedly he will be with Colin most of the time.  I am so hurt right now that I can't understand my own feelings let alone his.  I know I can't let myself hurt forever, but that is what feels like is going to happen.  I know it was my mistake and I shouldn't have doubted us in the first place, but I am content in the fact that I know where my feelings stand for him.  Through misunderstanding and turbulent times we have come to this plateau.  There is no right nor wrong choice for either of us and the only thing that bonds us is our past combined with emotions.  I can't let this keep going it isn't healthy for me.  I need him to make this less painful and either put me out of my misery or save me from myself.  The more time passes I can't help but lose him.  I am crying...I have to stop"

"event","The update...so here is what I am/have been thinking about the last few weeks.  After I returned from England I got back together with Dean.  I have been in love with him since I met him. I got back and we hung out a few times.  I told him if he is dating me then he is dating only me.  After a brief period he agreed.  Things were going swimmingly until I realized how little of him I was actually seeing.  I knew he was busy with school, but I just wasn't getting enough.  I went to Boy Bar (A club/bar in the Castro) with him, and he introduced me to what I fondly refer to as the ""Slew of Hookers"".  These people being the ones who would come into my store and be completely rude and act as if they were better than every person around them.  I told Dean I had to leave.  Instead of staying with his friends like I told him to, he took me home.  I proceeded to tell him how I felt.  He said he would try harder, and that he didn't care about those people...they were his MySpace friends.  A week and a half went by and by, and then I met this guy named Matt.  He came up to me on the sidewalk and said what is a cute guy like you doing alone.  I told him I was waiting for my manager.  I told him that I was seeing Dean and he said no pressure, just friends.  So I hung out with him.  He started telling me about how he would treat me if I was with him, an yadda yadda ya.  This sparked a fury in me.  Why was it so hard for me to get my bf to tell me these things, but a stranger could walk up on the street and after three days tell me what I should have.  I went to Dean and I hurt him.  I told him I wasn't getting enough, and that I needed someone who really cared.  We had a four hour convo in which we broke up and got back together four times.  I spent the night.  I didn't hear from him for two days.  I called him and told him that I didn't want to distract him from the Bar.  That I wasn't going to be blamed for him failing if it came down to it.  He agreed and we decided to  seperate.  I decided to not see Dean or Matt for a while.  I started talking to Matt again because I knew he was moving.  I helped him move to his new place and paint it.  I started talking to Dean again.  Dean took a trip to Sacramento to get away and study.  He left with more than knowledge.  He decided he wanted to date a boy named Colin.  I told Dean when I got a hold of him that I realized what I lost.  That I love him so much that I wanted to fall off the earth with him, and only be his.  I was at a point where I was giving myself fully to him.  He said we would talk when he got back.  We did.  He told me about Colin, and that I was being a child and not making proper decisions to which I fully agreed.  He said it was too late...I cried.  I have cried oh, just about every day.  Maybe I have gotten away without crying for one, but I was sure as hell thinking about it.  Oh, forgot to mention, Colin is going to school 20 minutes away from where Dean will be working in LA.  I am doomed.  I care so much for him that I want to see him happy, but it turns my stomach to think of them together.  I better not do this all in one posting, I will continue on the next one."

"event","Well Chittlins,

I am fairly sure that I am completely crazy now!  The day we got into London we met up with Matt's friend Paul.  Super hot!  As we were walking down the stairs of this coffee shop, Matt turned to me and said, oh btw Paul's friend David is here!  The last thing I needed was to be set up with a troll from a different country!  So I was pissed!  We meet him, and he is so gorgeous!  Wow!!!  We go get some drinks, hang out, flirt, it was great!  Paul had to go to work, so I told David he couldn't possibly leave us alone in such a huge city.  SO HE STAYED :)  He dropped us off at an Underground station and that was that!  The next day, Paul calls, wants to hang out, David's there!  WE saw him every night right up until New Years!  He was my date!  We went to this club that was called PopStarz!  It was amazing, we danced all night, did poppers, got tossed before we even went!  It was great, we had the most amazing time.  At midnight, he kissed me, and it was the best kiss I have ever had, it even topped my first which was my cherished one!  He told Matt he thought I was cute, yadda yadda ya, I fell so hard for him!  I have been a wreck ever since.  On the first night we met two acqauintances of David's.  Australian and Lithuanian.  I we saw them again at G-A-Y the club.  I said hi, we talked a bit, he asked Matt if he liked Paul, he said yes, he turned to me and asked if I liked David and I said yes!  Australian talked to Lithuanian, who talked to Michael (not sure the affiliation of this one) but he told David.  Apparently David is like my brother and only wants what he can't have, so he is not interested now.  Here is the best part, I can't stop thinking about him, and we are hanging out with him tomorrow night!  I have to talk to him!  YIKES!  I sent him a drunken e-mail on Myspace the other day.....he read it today.....I don't know what he is thinking.....who has one of those amphibious cars that would like to get me the hell out of JOLLY OL' ENGLAND!!!!!!!!!!!!!

We came home finished our baking projects and stayed up all night!  Jonathan and I watched Mr. and Mrs. Smith, and Hedwig twice...because we missed it the first time around;)  

We got up and went to school and Jonathan went to his hotel.

So, Diego, Reno, Vanessa, Jon and I decide to go!  I ended up on the gogo stage with Rich, another boy gogo-er, and two girls!  They stripped me down to my underwear and we did a grinding train!

Story...So I go to the movies last night with reno nessy and diegers, we saw Harry Potter totally nerded out, movie rocked and such.  I get a text from my ex who I am still in love with but I try not to remember what he did.  This is the boy that thought he was nothing, I made him realize he was something great, then he forgot about me...apparently not though.  It was my lil Jake.  He gave me his new number.  Invited me to come see his family who I love.  I said yes.

Straight boy from Nor Cal is talking to me a lot, and I like it.  He is such a different person than what I expected, but I can't get involved cuz it's not what I ""want""

Matt is being filmed for Real World and has outed himself.  He is going to gay bars tonight and talking to gorgeous Vegas bois.  He kills my heart and has his own fun.  I am expected to just be his friend.  Go traveling with him...I shall....I don't know what I am doing....I have ot put on a show....for me no prob...my heart...another story.

I don't want to be lonely anymore and I am not.  However, I am more alone now than ever.  I am at the precipous, and I have to jump.  Which leads to another story...Brett from my school wants me to go skydiving.  I don't think I can, but I want to...and Arbury, I want you to come.  If I do this I am doing it with you.

I need help with my life.  Taking control is overrated, so is letting it run it's course.....What the fuck"

I still have it, but I continue to fuck around and it gets me in trouble.  The other night I danced at a guy, he threw fish oil at my car, we threw sodas, he followed us down a dead end street, threatened to cut me and held a knife to my face.

Matt:
Made out with some guy in Vegas, told me not to worry about it.

England Yay or Nay?:
Definitely bought the tickets, worst that can happen, Matt treats me like shit, I meet a posh gay London boy and stay with him til we leave ; )

Life:
Not sure where mine is headed but if you see a spiral downward then I guess I am looking at the same page.

My hand is getting tired, I was propositioned for a three-some by my friend and his girlfriend for this saturday evening, gonna go for it, could be interesting.

Prereq. Story

     So last weekend Hone came.  Judging by some of my recent entries you would most likely assume this was a joyous event....you are sadly mistaken...  From the moment of arrival something fishy was in the air.   I believe this was stemmed from the fact that one of our more important phone calls he stated in a dream that we were just good friends...not together.  Well, we arrived home and settled in.  Diego was introduced, and we all hung out in the living room.  After the awkward intro, we arrived at the idea that we were all hungers...so we went to Little Italy to a lovely bistro called the Mona Lisa.  In a rousing round of boring how do you do convo Hone decides to ask some questions...
""Who would you want to be?""
""Who would you want to meet?""
""Who would you want to fall in love with you and marry you?""
     As the last question fell on me I paused, if I say Hone I will be embarassed...if I say i celeb I will wish I had said Hone...  I asked him if he meant celeb...or...what?  He said it could be either one, whatever I felt....I didn't answer :(

Wow...Just had a thought...I am way too tired for the rest of this story...this is going to be a long entry so just hang in there....Soon to be Finished!"

Then we drove to Sac and now I am going to shop and then drive back to SF to go pick up Diego and help him get all situated, then school starts Wednesday again!  Holy shit!  I can't believe how much has happened in two days, I haven't done this much all week!  Oh well, at least it was FUN"

"event","So, I got back from San Diego today after being trashed with all my brother's kick ass roommates, then I decide hmm!  Let's add some more travel time to Sean's journey, so I asked my friend Alan what he was doing and he said nothing!  So tonight, we drove down rented some movies, watched Top Gun, which is surprisingly good, then The Grudge, Alan scared the shit out of me!  Now we are off to bed, possibly going to Bodega Bay later today, then I don't know what other shananigans, but we will see!"

Basically when I went to Ireland he told me no sex in the champagne room, then I told him the same when he went to LA, now he is in Vegas and his ex was ""visiting""  so I was worried, but nothing happened between them, they just got really drunk!  Well anywho, yesterday a LOT of things were fixed by a very interesting phone call, so there, sorry to all who were confused/injured/bankrupt due to my earlier posts!

"event","So Alan came down friday night, he came up and we kicked it for a while, we got our gin and tonics on!  Sadly he allowed me to make the drinks!!!!  BAD PLAN!!  They were really strong, I was drunk after the first drink!!!

Next, we kicked it on my patio and smoked some peach shisha in the hooka, we talked and laughed and it was very interesting to learn about his underwear haha!!!  So we go back in and he pours two more drinks so I am way tossed at this point, and I start talking about breakfast (total fatkid)!!!  So we decide to WALK to Safeway!!!!

We start walking from 24th to Geary (2 blocks)  then 24th to 42nd!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  So we see these lions like guarding this wicked secret path it was nuts!!!!  We run off down this wild trail and we can hear the ocean!!!!  We look over this cliff and there is The Cliffhouse!!!  Right on the edge of the coast, we climbed this wall to get to the overlook and cut our hands on these sharp plants!  Ouch!

So, the whole time I have had to pee really bad, and Alan is telling me how liberating it is to be in the outdoors!  So, of course I whip it out and pee!!!  Random gay man move!  Then we start walking down the rest of the path, and somehow Alan knows exactly where Safeway is, I guess his Alan sense was tingling!  So we go in and get waffle mix, oil, and strawberries!  Just then, on comes Gloria Gaynor!!!  All I know is Alan and I Will Survive!!!  Haha, so we leave....

"event","we're moving this saturday.  i'm a little sad cuz this townhouse is probaly the best place i've lived and it's just starting to get so green and pretty outside. we have so many trees here.  and we're not even sure where we're moving just yet.  the plan was to move into that nasty camper i posted pictures of, but we might have talked mom into letting us stay in the house...which still isn't GREAT.  their beds are SO hard and squeaky. if you even breathe, the bed squeaks! and they wake up really early and turn the tv full blast. 

i bitched out united bilt (yes it is spelled that way...don't you hate it when businesses spell their name wrong intentionally??  i usually avoid those places.) yesterday.  i thought they put the wrong shingles on the roof, cuz i know i picked out black, but i got grey.  turns out black looks grey when it all up there and finished, but nobody told me that, so i made a big fool out of myself.  i still hate them so much though.  so much for being a happy new homeowner.  they have made this whole experience HELL...and they don't care...they just smile and nod at you.  yesterday i just ended up yelling random things i was mad about at him...and he just smiled and nodded his bald little head and said ""I wasn't aware of that, Ms. Gayer.""  ""I'll check in to that Ms. Gayer.""  ""We're taking good care of you Ms. Gayer.""  then why the fuck am i about to move into a camper??!!

           David Sedaris""
i was at least hoping for an ""i love you back""  or ""i want you to mother my children.""  but all i got was the generic to, from thing. 

melissa had him sign her book to peter, her boss...and then had david add his wife's name.  david asked where she worked and when she said an interior decorating place, he asked ""And your boss isn't a homosexual??"" 
melissa was like...""no, he's just english.""  it was funny at the time. i wish i could've have talked to him more, but i froze up. surprise."

i'm so stressed about this...and mad...and even kinda hurt....even though it will hopefully fizzle out.  my boss said we definately need to talk about it, but the guy doesn't really have much ground to stand on cuz there's not anything in the discrimination policy about discrimating against straight people.

"event","today we found 3 ceiling fans on clearance for $30.  they're fairly pretty and modern-looking.  this week when the tax $$$ comes in, we're buying a jacuzzi.  i'm so excited.  this week at lowes you get a $75 gift card when you buy a jacuzzi, but where the hell are we gonna keep it until the house is finished. we also have bought all the faucets & fixtures for the bathroom.  they haven't even started building the house, but when they do we'll be oh so prepared."

"event","we've been trying so hard not to spend a dime on anything but house building stuff and obviously it's get to us.  i came home last night prepared to hide the books i bought off the clearance shelf at b. dalton (tattoos, a cool picture book & cavedweller by dorothy allison (who, as you know is my literary girlfriend)) and i saw that kayla had bought a kitchen utensil set (the things that excite her). 
today i woke up feeling like i needed to spend more money...i mean, i earned it...so, i went to hastings and could find nothing, cuz you never can when you have money to spend, so i went to the grocery store and bought comfort food.  sad. 
i'm gonna go eat now."

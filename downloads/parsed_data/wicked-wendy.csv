"event","If you could go or have been to Japan where would you go?

I&nbsp;need to book my shit and I want to go to the major tourist places (like Kyoto and Hiroshima) and maybe some small random places too.

Oh yeah, i'll be in the Can for a couple of days over Easter visiting the family and all. Work is working me hard (but gave me some random bonus woot!) and i'm actually looking forward to doing something different for a few days, even if it was to go to the same place i've always ever been tm. 

ummm... what else?

Saw Russell Brand live the other w/e. He's a funny funny man. Had a girls night out the other night, and me and about 15 girls painted the town all kinds of red velvet. (If you've been to the Carlton Club you would know what I mean) Have been a hibernating geek on work nights and been playing all kinds of computer games, eating delicious paella and am getting delerious from all of this wonderful money i've been saving. (which will prolly be alll gone in Japan by buying canned underwear from vending machines and hello kitty vibrators..... though really from the JR&nbsp;Travel pass which is some FUCKING&nbsp;LUDICROUS&nbsp;AMOUNT&nbsp;and accommodation which is again in the latter catergorey)

I&nbsp;think i'm addicted to accupuncture.

"event","I'm still in Chiang Mai. On Tuesday the gang, which we have been referring to ourselves as ""Lucky Man and the Pip Squeaks"" traveled to palace grounds on a mountain.  This  was kind of lame, as we could look at the palace, but we weren't allowed to go near it! We paid a fee for the privilege of ""viewing the outside"". Admittedly the fee came to about.. $2 so that wasn't to much of a concern. We also visited a small rustic village, and made many purchases (including for myself a gorgeous parchment with much of it painted in gold leaf) and visited a temple, which the name of i'm at a blank.  It was by far the most elaborate temple i've seen so far.  Very picturesque on the mountain, with breaths of fog whisping past.  Many photo's were taken.

  Wednesday, we traveled to the zoo.  It was simply HUGE, and cars were needed to travel around.  The highlight was the Panda's.  They were the Paris Hilton's of the zoo, with a security guard set aside for each one!
  Again, many photo's were taken!

 By night we have been attending markets.  They take about 5 hours to walk around!  Very large - a little repetitive at times, but much has been purchased and they are quite their own little experience.  A few earthquakes have passed.  Kind of freaky, but apparently a regular occurrence.

"event","Phuket -

  In Phuket, we thought it would be an adventure to visit Phuket town.  It was really interesting seing the juxtoposition of a really nice boutique shop right next to a derelict house with a begger and the smell of rotten fish.
  
  We decided to eat food where the locals do at the market.  We quickly changed our minds though, when we went to buy some food and noticed flies and maggots on it! The town smelt.  

Chiang Mai - 

  The next day we flew to Chiang Mai, which is to the north of Thailand in the mountains.  It is a lot cleaner here, cheaper and the locals are very friendly. We saw a couple of temples, and lots of old guys with very young local guys, which I find to be the most disturbing part of the trip.  I swear, it's a haven for bald middle aged guys here. I feel like hugging the young girls.

  Chaing Mai also has a lot of cheap silver, so i've gone jewelery shopping. Tonight i'm heading off to the local night markets which are currently been set up on my left, as well as a large march consisting of army men, monks and large golden boats.

  I may even go and have a look..

I've been told it would stink. It doesn't. The shower water does though. It smells as though someone has put an onion to sit in the water tank! (ew!)

The resort i'm staying at for the next couple of nights is simply GORGEOUS. I will take many many photo's.  

The locals are a crack up. They keep on saying ""G'day mate, throw a shrimp on the barby"" They also keep saying to my brother ""Lucky man"" as he is travelling with three girls. Starting to get annoying though...

Anyway, i'll update as the trip continues.  Right now I have a cocktail with my name on it.

Dan heard about it but didn't tell me that it was on until after the fact.
  Boy was I livid...

I woke up and realised it was but simply a dream...

   Then today, I find out NIN actually ARE touring Australia. (thanks Dan!) 

I jumped around in all kinds of excitement. Only to realise that I will actually be oversea's when they tour!

"event","I don't feel there is enough emphasis on scents.

    To me, smelling divine, is as important as looking divine.  It's a highly erotic sense and can ""make"" or ""break"" one's interest in someone.  The make, is smelling cologne on a boy/girl and wanting to lick their neck like a kitten at a saucer of milk.  The break, is when someone has such bad hygiene and b.o they begin to smell like bong water. Totally ick!

   In light of my fascination with scents, i've concocted a list which brings me to my knees with delight...

* Agent Provocateur, my new trademark scent
* Joop, a lot of people wear it, and for a good reason too...
* MOR's Pomegranate body butter, soaps, etc.
* Dessert - yes, the Jessica Simpson stuff. Shut up, it smells, tastes really yummy.
* Gucci Envy and the Green Monte Blanc - very similar scents which are v. masculine. In a good way!
* Hugo Boss, the red one for girls... mMmmmmMmm...

Now, what are your favorite scents?"

""Womb With A View""

Fiendish and crude
Froosty and lews
This is the life I have whored myself to
Spackled and battered and smothered and covered
And cleaving and cloven and bitter and blued
Your womb
Your breeding sac

Your womb is a membrane I must penetrate
Your womb is a sewer
I grunt at the grate
Your womb is a sewer
Your womb is manure
but still, I'm worse

My life is a sinkhole
Egregious and rude
Worm fested and filthy
Froosty and lewd
A womb with a view
When one becomes two
Fuck you
Never to matter the number of flies feasting the flab that bolsters your thighs
Your womb
Your breeding hive
Womb with a view
I see you

I was born
Deep in the void
Raped by millions I soon grew
Annoyed!

Could I somehow elope?
Like a molecule in a microscope
So your womb won't become the tomb of our dead baby
Never to matter the number of flies
Lapping the flab that bolsters your thighs
Womb with a view
When one becomes two
Fuck you

Your womb is a membrane I must penetrate
Your womb is a sewer
I grunt at the grate
Your womb is a sewer
Your womb is manure
But still, I'm worse"

And I feel as though an entry is due.
I'm in a rioting mood - who wants to come a-rioting tomorow night (yes, at Lithium)
It'll be great. If your not there, you don't love me. :p 

I'm getting better at work, but today has been a day filled with questions I don't know much about. Really draining. I swear my call times have gone up 5 minutes today.

*shrugs*

I think I scared Chris by humping dan's leg. hahaha

I'm enjoying work, but I can't wait until I move away and spread my wings a little... Canberra is slowly suffacating me. I feel trapped. I need some friends me thinks... I adore Shane and Dan, but I feel I need to extend my social life out of two people.
esp where one of those people i'm having limited contact with these days...

Time for me to go home darlings. xx."

  Wednesday shall forever imprinted in the minds of Alyssa and Daniel. 
To begin, Daniel picked me up, and we headed out to Questacon. NAKED. Yes, Daniel got changed in the car, and I decided that he should drive naked there - which Daniel agreed to. 

<img src=""http://i9.photobucket.com/albums/a95/absinthe_mindead/buttercock.jpg"" alt=""Butter Cock"" />

(I had to hide Daniels MASSIVE RAGING dick with butterflies.... I don't think you could quite mentally prepare yourself for Daniels diabolical cock.)

After many giggles. (and a few weird looks) we arrived. 
Questacon was fun but there are way to many twerps. It seemed like our arms and legs's reflexes were out of control. We tried our hardest not to kick the kiddies. Really!

So, on to home to do the unthinkable. Wax Daniels eyebrows. I brought my trusty camera phone for the occasion. 

<img src=""http://i9.photobucket.com/albums/a95/absinthe_mindead/pain.jpg"" alt=""moi"" />

OUCH!


Daniels funny looking now!

But still just as lovable and sweet as ever. :)
Which reminds me! CONGRATULATIONS HON ON YOUR NEW JOB *Squeezes you so tight, we both burst in glee*!!!

I also took this photo... actually Tuesday night. I'd like to burst my ""LJ photo of myself virginity"" to those of you who don't know what I look like. (which i think is about 2 people, cause i know most of the people on here)

"event","Argh. i want to rant. And this is LJ, so this is the perfect place to spill my furthur (very trivial) heartache.

Here is a list of things which piss me off.

- People giving you christmas presents then taking them back. (yes.. this happened to me this year)
- The fact that the smallest size in half the clothes stores in canberra is to large. I'm a size 6, the smallest most places are are a size 8. Is it that everyone is so fat these days that Small is now a retarted size. (I used to be able to fit into size 8 when I was smaller than this!)
- The fact that the smallest size underwear Bra and things stocks is a size 10 - unless I want a g-string cause they have those, and only those in 8's. (What kind of message are they trying to put across?)
  Oh yeah, I hate g-strings.
- Supre is fucking awesome though!  ie skin tight black jeans for $20 which look/fit better than the stocks $140 version.
- My hair is ugh. The haircut = awesome, but my hair has this habit of going really... blonde in summer even with copious amounts of black hair dye. It's currently brown. Maybe i'll just go white next time?
- Centrestink and everything associated with it.
- The Sun. And light. And heat. etc.
- Canberra shopping. It's pretty lame.
- My fucking curse. (and yes I have one. I call it my gypsy curse.)
- My Anxiety disorder.
- The fact that it's not the early 80's and i'm not living in England. *wah wah wah*

Now before I start to sound emo.

Oh yes, thats another thing that I can add to my list

- EMO'S

I'll end it here.

[edit. Aside from this things are pretty peachy :) ]"

  - I'm reinventing myself, to fit how I currently feel. A lot more pinks and reds, pants and overall punk/trashiness. My hair is now pink/red/fuscia and very back combed. 
  - For once in my life, i've started to stop fighting my body. No more pigging out and feeling ill to gain weight. I've come to accept that my natural weight is 45kg's... can you? (and, lately, my body hasn't looked hotter.. not that I have tickets on myself, but it's just sitting properly in proportion etc.)
  - I saw a shooting star last night... let us hope that my wish comes true...
  - I swear in the song ""Rock the Kasbah"" they are REALLY saying ""Fuck the Cats Bum""
  - It never ceases to amaze me, how perspective can change one's emotion/need of a situation.
  - I bought yesterday - Fredrich W Nietzsche's - ""On the Genealogy of Morals"". I'm re opening my avid interest of the existentialist  perspective of things.  
  - It seems that when I am at my most selfless, I appear to be the ever most selfish. But somethings, I feel are best left unsaid...

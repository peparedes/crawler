"event","Uh... so. I haven't posted in forever, for much the same reasons I haven't done a lot of things (like get dinner with friends, write my Aralis summary, play LOTRO, sleep). Consider this a drive-by update whilst waiting for dinner.

Our holiday party was Friday, on Pier 48, which sounds all schmancy but was basically a warehouse done up nice and festive. I had a great time, saw MC Hammer (1), and met up with Alex and Alex afterwards. The number of Alexs in my life is adorably large. Saturday was SantaCon in SF, and I played MidWinter and then went to DNA Lounge, though I didn't have a great time as I was kind of under the weather and tired by that point. 

The rest of my life is largely work. I did reread Deepness in the Sky (soooo good!) and started in on Walking Dead (the graphic novel), but apart from that I've been doing a lot of engineering on large scales, which is fun and at times terrifying. I wish I was more talented, but it's really rewarding to work with brilliant people and almost keep up.

I'm sure that there is more to say, but this has already taken me three days to write. I was going to say something about my social life being near terminal, but I'm not sure I have the time or energy to care. Which is probably why it's terminal. Ah, well!

(1) He's real! Which is sort of a weird thought, but not actually life-changing."

"event","So, I did some serious biking around SF today. In part this was to run errands. In part this was because it was beautiful out, and I had the day off. In case you hadn't heard, there are some certified hills here in the West. This happened while going up one.

I turned to my left, to look to see the situation of the intersection I was about to go through. I car was pulling up with it's rear passenger side window down. Two barrels emerged, and a young child, maybe 7 to 9 range started shooting me, ""Pew, pew pew!"" True story. I reflexively went ""Ahh!"" and threw up my hands. And promptly lost my balance and fell over. 

Anyway, this is a friendly city, and I am charmed."

Anyway, someone with a persistently grumbly stomach said I should post more. Therefore:

- Work is going really well. I'm dead tired at the end of every day, and being forced to do things I have zero experience with. This is all to the good. I'm still very disoriented in terms of what I'm doing, but pieces are starting to fit into place, and what's more important is that there aren't dull moments. There is only Zuul. Which in this case is a humongous amount of code on a positively egregious number of servers. Computers in my world have ceased to be things that do many things. They each only do one thing. And there are many, many of them. 
- Holy moly, the tech culture out here is social. I'm glad my bike is here and that I live on a hill because there is just plain a lot of food and drink. And by drink I mean beer. And liquor. And wine. Oh god, the wine. 
- My apartment is in total disarray, but I have my bed! Hopefully I can find the hardware for the frame, which unfortunately did not get taped to it. Still, the mattress and boxspring makes sleep so much more effective. I got some extra furniture to fill in the gaps, too, including a table for gaming on. 


In general, I'm very happy right now. This is the runner's high, I think. Being applied, having things to do that I'm interested in, and when not doing those I've had plenty of opportunity to chill with friends not seen in a long time. I'd forgotten how good a GM Adam is and what interesting conversations I have with Ion, and how natural it is for Suko to wander around with two swords strapped to her back and a bevy of arrows in her hand. Part of me is super exhausted by this constant parade of things to do, but I find energy every morning to rise at or before 8am. Anyone who knows me knows what this implies.

There are still moments of intense sadness. It's possible I'm just a melancholy person, and I'll never escape that. It's possible this is a huge fuck-off mistake. But it's more likely that these things are bundled in with the good things for rational reasons that I haven't had time to figure out yet. But there is sunshine here, and that goes a long ways. At least one AU, and probably beyond."

- I got to hang with some friends I hadn't really seen in a while... very good thing.
- The UTA department meeting was awesome. Hilarious!

This is the only way we can get closure on the Belgian Chocolate issue.'"" ""...and unlike 123, 167 has a book..."") Despite the recent turbulence with the TA program, it's spirit is surviving.

"event","Making people feel bad by suggesting that they either 
a) must be part of your facebook group or 
b) must repost some post you made
and if they don't, they're a bad person and going to hell is not unlike saying if you don't accept Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior into your heart, you're a bad person and going to hell.

Both are totally... uh... accepted stances. But I wonder? Does the 8 month child who dies in a car accident going to hell? Does the person who utterly fails to join or read facebook go to hell? In the latter case, why are people who read facebook religiously... or, like, me, because they're highly, highly distractable and quite possibly addicted... held to a 'higher' standard? Does that make sense to you?

I'm not going to mindlessly repost stuff. I'm also not going to get into why I do happen to repost stuff when I do; facebook is a form of crack for me, almost literally. I don't really need more of it. I certainly don't need my relationship with it to devolve into a non-functioning back and forth spamfest wherein I am controlled by the random insistent whim of whomever wrote the original lackluster post. Much like, if I were to do crack, I'd inject it directly into my eyeball, or between the toes... and not stoop to having needle tracks up and down my arms, whilst I drooled all over myself. Please, people. 

Facebook is not the end-all, be-all of political or humanitarian action, either. Joining groups or repeating humanitarian notices may do something tangible for your efforts in helping these things: if so, please please please keep doing it. Please do not expect me or think less of me for not doing these things. I choose other forms, and find the facebook expectations to translate largely to, ""DO CRACK OR SOME POOR BASTARD WILL DIE."" I mean, not the worst reason for doing crack, but also sort of thin reasoning. I'm allergic to thin reasoning.

Uh... and since I didn't mention sex yet, but did politics and religion. So... SEX! It's good. Everyone should do it. Almost daily. (Translation: ""F**K YOU CIT!!!"")"

Like almost all the British series I've found(1), it was bloody brilliant and cut down in the prime of it's brilliance - it's only two seasons, 12 episodes, long. The ending is not an ending. But that's ok, because the writing and acting is awesome. It's funny, witty and perceptive. Also, it's possibly the first thing to make me actually want to move to Scotland. 


(1) Ultraviolet and Spaced jump to mind immediately, along with Peep Show. I can't remember if Coupling was cut short, but The Book Group is that level of clever, if not quite that funny. It is, of course, not meant to be that funny; it's definitely darker than Spaced or Coupling."

Currently, Jaime Lannister is matched against Hermione. While I feel for my classmate, I think that she (contrary to popular opinion) wouldn't stand a chance. She has no killer instinct. And few social defenses against Jaime's winning smile. Jaime, on the other hand, throws children out windows. But whatever.

The real tragedy is the lopsided reporting on the Vlad Taltos v Dumbledore matchup. It ignores Taltos's pheonix medallions, Lady Teldra's ability to bounce spells and general soul-devouring capability, Vlad's psionics, sorcery AND elder sorcery (the latter of which would eat any master of Dark Arts for a light luncheon, nevermind Dumbledore), but most damningly, Loiosh. I mean, seriously, you'll let Fawkes 'heal' Dumbledore, but Loiosh stands around snickering? Please. Our little Jhereg would be munching on Pheonix - AND snickering.

In other news, someone is wrong on the internet."

My brief commentary: I think that this is actually pretty common, and a lot more subversive than the 'obvious' version. It seems to me to be a common specific case of a person who thinks they possess some authoritative attribute (gender, academic degree, logical reasoning, a father-who-did-such-and-such-for-a-living-so-don't-f**k-with-them...) that they think the listener does not possess. Mothers; don't let your sons adopt condescension based on imaginary advantages as a preferred strategy."

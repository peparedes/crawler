"event","I am a phone hag. Everyone knows what a phone hag is, though they usually refer to them as a ""receptionist"" or even a ""secretary."" The truth is, I answer a telephone with a faux chipper voice, transfer the call, then go back to doing something else that's just as boring and pointless as being someone's living caller-ID. Because, really, all I do is screen the calls that come in before passing them along to someone that makes ten times what I do and can't possibly be bothered for the millisecond it takes to look at their phone display that says, ""George is calling.""

I do, however, get free orange juice. And that, my friends, makes all the difference."

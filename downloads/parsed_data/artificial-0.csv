"event","she went to see a mystic
who made medicine from rain
and gave up her existance&nbsp;
to&nbsp;feel everything, dream others dreams.
bid farewell to her family
with one ecstatic wave
out the window
as the car rolled
away.
she just vanished
into a thickness
of change.
so let us rejoice"

"event","well
today: 
ballet rehersal, 
then, 
starbucks with adam, emiko, courtney, ally and later on ethan came. 
im entering this contest to design a skateboard deck. so i worked on that the whole time. 
i brought my trusty kalidescope. it is always good for entertaining people who never get bored. 
right now i really like my life. i find everything intruiging and interesting. i cant believe i spent so much time being selfish and unhappy. its just the way you look at it. we have to remember to be thankful for our time no matter the trials we are going through."

"event","today was a nice nice day.
i made this new livejournal, to symbolize a new fresh start. or fresh ending. because when i made my old LJ it was when i was first starting high school. now that im finishing high school im different. i read my old posts from freshman year when i loved jocks and school and i was quite insecure. i know who i am now. its a good feeling. im so happy. so happy. i find beauty in the&nbsp;in things i never thought&nbsp;i could find beauty in before,&nbsp;and i hope i will always have these good feelings about the world.&nbsp;"

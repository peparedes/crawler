Narnak be thinkin it be time ta tell da second part of da adventure with Fuzzy. It be a really long story, and it be scary at times. Narnak be thinkin she be good warrior for Thrall. I be tellin why.

It be late at night and Fuzzy and me be meetin again at da entrance of da scary orc cave. I be laughin because Fuzzy be actin all tough, like he not be scared of da orcses. Pfah, Narnak be knowin better!

<img src=""http://i103.photobucket.com/albums/m155/crushdmnky/narnakAnAdventurewithFuzzyII-01.jpg"" alt=""Meetin again with Fuzzy"" height=""100%"" width=""100%"" />

So we be tip-toe'ing past da scary orcs again ta reach da entrance of da cave Thrall be talkin about. Dem orcs really be scary!

<img src=""http://i103.photobucket.com/albums/m155/crushdmnky/narnakAnAdventurewithFuzzyII-02.jpg"" height=""100%"" width=""100%"" />

Once we enter da cave we be seeing worm things, it be really strange. Narnak be thinkin she be seein orcs in da cave, not strange worm things.

Fuzzy not be likin da worms much, he be cuttin dem down really fast. I be runnin ta keep up with him. Maybe fuzzy really be strong like he be sayin. 

We suddenly be seein lots of strange, dwarf like things. Fuzzy be smart. He be knowin it be Troggs, da enemies of da orcs. Narnak be thinkin Fuzzy be strong and smart, he be killin many of da Troggs with Narnak healin him. Fuzzy be great!

<img src=""http://i103.photobucket.com/albums/m155/crushdmnky/narnakAnAdventurewithFuzzyII-06.jpg"" height=""100%"" width=""100%"" />

There be a hidden path in da cave, and Narnak be knowin from da ways of da Shaman that da hidden paths be da paths that be leadin to da really important things. So we be headin up. Fuzzy rippin da way through da surprised Troggs till we find da corps of a poor Tauren, maybe Fuzzy be a really strong Tauren. Narnak not be knowin much about da Tauren, Fuzzy be strong though. And he be angry because da Troggs be killin Tauren. We be huntin Troggs now, da evil orcs can wait.

After Fuzzy be losin da rage we be headin deeper in da cave. It be lookin really gloomy and fiery here. Narnak be wonderin why anyone would be likin ta stay in place like dis long. Fuzzy be saying some of da other Tauren be stayin days in places like dis. Somethin about Molten Boredom. It be soundin like a strange Fuzzy thing, like da flyin Tauren idea. Sometimes Fuzzy be really strange.

<img src=""http://i103.photobucket.com/albums/m155/crushdmnky/narnakAnAdventurewithFuzzyII-09.jpg"" height=""100%"" width=""100%"" />

He be fightin da bad elemental though, and then we be finally seein da bad orcs. Narnak be a bit confused though, they not be lookin that strange. Maybe they be good orcs. Narnak be walkin ahead tryin ta speak to da orcs, but Fuzzy be running past fast ta take a shadowy bolt. Fuzzy be really good friend, he be right orcs be bad! It be scary battle, many orcs be comin ta Narnak and Fuzzy be tryin ta keep them all busy. Narnak be healin Fuzzy all da time, he be really tough. Da orcs be stronger than da worm things, but they still be orcs so da be not strange.

One of da orcs be carryin a strange book, Narnak be wantin ta open it but Fuzzy be saying it be really dangerous. It be about ""Facial Treatments of Recently Deceased Forsaken, A selfhelp-guide for the Fashion Conscious Corpse"" Narnak be thinkin it be strange book.

<img src=""http://i103.photobucket.com/albums/m155/crushdmnky/narnakAnAdventurewithFuzzyII-12.jpg"" height=""100%"" width=""100%"" />

Suddenly Fuzzy be screamin in rage, he be seein a demon ahead. Fuzzy not be likin demon! Narnak don't think she be likin them either. They be hurtin and look ugly.

<img src=""http://i103.photobucket.com/albums/m155/crushdmnky/narnakAnAdventurewithFuzzyII-13.jpg"" height=""100%"" width=""100%"" />

It seemed da orcs be a lot stronger than da stupid demon. Narnak shouldn't be surprised, Orcs be really strong!

Fuzzy be knowin da way around da cave, he be really smart. He be saying Narnak should be watchin Narnak's feet, da floor be really hot.

<img src=""http://i103.photobucket.com/albums/m155/crushdmnky/narnakAnAdventurewithFuzzyII-14.jpg"" height=""100%"" width=""100%"" />

We be headin up, meetin more bad orcs. Da be really many bad orcs. More bad orcs than in Narnak's village. Narnak be confused. But da be a bad Satyr who be leadin da orcs, Narnak be bringin da heart of da Satyr ta show Thrall.

<img src=""http://i103.photobucket.com/albums/m155/crushdmnky/narnakAnAdventurewithFuzzyII-15.jpg"" height=""100%"" width=""100%"" />

There be one sad thing ta do. Bring da proof of da poor Tauren ta Thunderbluff. Dem Taurens be sad ta hear da loss but they be happy ta know dem Troggs be killed as revenge.

When walkin to da inn, Narnak be lookin over da edges of Thunderbluff. Narnak be hopin Fuzzy didn't try ta fly here, it be really high. Silly Tauren, they should be livin on da plains, it be much nicer...

Kranal Fiss be livin in da Barrens, Narnak never been there. So I be travelin east. It be excitin ta see da new places. I first be reachin da big bridge. It be really big and impressive.

Kranal Fiss be livin near da bridge, and Narnak didn't be meetin bad creatures.

He be really concerned daddy, Narnak's hart be warmin now. He will be good master.

He be tellin Narnak ta go to da biggest, highest mountain in Durotar, there be a troll there who will be tellin ya  what ta do ta have a Sapta made. So I be headin back to Durotar, over da pretty bridge and lookin for da hidden mountain path up da mountain. Narnak be thinkin shaman's be likin things hidden. Maybe da elementals be really sneaky...

Da mountain really be high, and Narnak found da troll. He be nice and tellin Narnak about da Sapta. Apparently da Sapta be needin a Reagent Pouch from bad orcs, and some Fire Tar from da quillboars. 

Narnak be strong orc, so I be travellin to da bad orcs and take da Reagent Pouch with force. Kranal Fiss would be proud.

And da Fire Tar, da quillboars not be nice at all. They be wantin ta kill Narnak really bad. Maybe da be why da other orcs hate them so bad. They not be nice folk at all!

Telf be makin da Sapta. It be tastin strange, maybe da reagents be a bit too strange. But I be seeing elementals now.

Hmm Narnak be wondering if da Sapta be bad for ya. Narnak normally not be seein elementals. Maybe there no be elementals but it be strange Sapta. Hmm, head hurts. Narnak smash silly elemental.

Da elemental be lightin a torch, and I be runnin back ta Kranal Fiss. Hmm it be feelin strange, Narnak be thinkin of five interlocking rings...  It must be da Sapta and da strange torch making Narnak dizzy.

I was sent to find da shaman Margoz ta find out about da bad demon orcs. Fuzzy be wanting ta help me so head North towards Orgrimmar. Fuzzy says he be feeling rather dizzy...

<img src=""http://i103.photobucket.com/albums/m155/crushdmnky/narnakAAdventurewithFuzzy-03.jpg"" alt=""Fuzzy Keeps Headbutting"" height=""100%"" width=""100%"" />

We found da orc Margoz, and he be telling us that we need ta kill da Burning Blade orcs ta get their collars, and find a thing for Thrall. Fuzzy be knowing where da Skull Rock is, so he be leading me ta them and we smash them puny demon orcses.

We found da collars and da thing for Thrall fast, and be taking it ta Margoz. He be wanting ta test them, Fuzzy whispered that da might not be good idea. He be right, Margoz hurt himself. *giggles* He be sending us ta Orgrimmar ta speek with Thrall and another orc. 

Fuzzy know da way ta Orgrimmar, and da nice places so he be leading us there. Orgrimmar is big! Lots bigger then Narnak's family farm.

Maybe Fuzzy be not as dense as da headbutting showed. He be knowing many thing about Orgrimmar, about goblins, and orcs, bank and da gold. And da nice place ta get some drinks. Drink be tasting a bit like da Sapta Canaga made. Maybe I be seeing elementals too if I be drinking lots.

After da drink Fuzzy be showing da way too Thrall, not da fast way because he be scared of heights. He be saying Taurens weren't made for heights, if they be they could fly he says. Fuzzy might be right. He says he tried ta fly, but it didn't work. I am having fun seeing a Tauren trying ta fly, Fuzzy must have looked silly.

But it be a really scary orc. So Fuzzy and Narnak be walking tip-toe and looking like we just be shopping.

I be Narnak, young orc seeking to be a great Shaman. I recently came of age and now I be learning da important things to become a great orc. Today I recieved da Call of the Earth, I was very excited when Canaga wanted ta speak with me.

Da hidden path be leading to da Spirit Rock. That be strange, Narnak didn't see a hidden path here. Hmmm, maybe that be why it be called hidden path. Canaga be smart Shaman indeed. He be saying I need ta drink a Septa, a trance drink, ta speak with da elemental. I hope it be friendly.

Da path wasn't hard ta find, perhaps it be not that hidden after all. Well time to run along and find da Spirit Rock!

Time drink da Septa, it be strange feeling. Narnak feels like she be drunk. Maybe I be, I be seeing lots of elementals now. One be very big, and speaking to Narnak. Big rocks don't speak, do they? Narnak be feeling strange.

Narnak be feeling strange, running down da path is scary now. But big chunk of stone be saying Narnak learned good lesson. So I be running fast to show da quartz to Canaga so I be getting da totem of the Earth.

Canaga be happy, and I be feeling less strange now. Maybe da Septa worked out. But I have a Earth Totem now! Daboe!

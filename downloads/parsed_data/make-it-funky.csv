(about a year and 2 months)

but seriously
I was in the woods with a few friends having a nice chat and the next thing i know a roughly 35 year old guy ran by naked from the ankles up!  None of us noticed him until he was about 10 feet away and muttered ""good evening gentlemen.""  Looks like his little secret is out."

"event","im back from my long 3 day camping excursion. me and jen went up to tawas and were gonna try finding some random campground to stay at when we got there. the first one we tried was full and the rest were all closed. so we went over to my dad's aunt's motel and got a free room. it had wood paneling on all of the walls which gave it that 60's porno look. the next day finally got ourselves hooked up with a spot to camp which was nice and close to the lake. after gettin the tent set up we headed out for a dip. while i was there i did the usual stuff. (i.e. drink a 6 pack and kick down a kid's sand castle, then kick down a kid.) then after a few more hours of relentless camping, the storm of the century hit. we managed to stay dry in the tent.  there was so much lightening it was awesome. i came home yesterday with only a few minor injuries. 

and believe it or not i started working today. i have a whole 4 weeks before i go on a vacation and then head back to school. job number 1 was chippin some paint off this shabby lookin subway in gross pointe. tomorrow im gonna make that place look like new."

its nice out.  i think i need to play disc golf today."

"event","its crazy what a pipe smoke, some good conversation and laying on the grass on my back staring up at the sky can do to my mind. we just chilled out there bouncing for one profound topic to another. it really got me thinking about everything that i should be thinking about gets me off the monotonous daily bullshit.  it gives me a good feeling of insignificance.  Not that im insignificant to other people but more that people in general are to the rest of the universe. if the earth didnt even exist the rest of the universe you go on with its business just the same.  That feeling does wonders to any stress that may have been going on for me.  i see people whos days or even weeks are ruined becasue they do bad on a test.  i did terrible on the ast test i took and i just laughed at it.  getting all wrapped up in things like that and dwelling on it has no useful purpose.  man   so much went through my head in the past 2 hours.  i really need to do more meditating.  ive had nothing but good experiences with it before i just dont get the chance most often.

well its past 4 and i see no sings of me going to sleep in sight.  so i think im gonna get cook up some hot dogs out back and drink myself lots of coffee."

"event","so last night was a good random night.  i was just coolin out when i got a ca from a buddy of mine who i havent seen in 2 years.  He ended up being out in this area so me him and two of his boys went to a party at the atlantis co-op.  Live music is always a good touch for a party.  I thought none of us would know anybody there but it turned out that natalie and mad max were both there.  I swear mad max is at every party i go to. Even earlier in the year i went to some random parties and sure enough, he was there.  Our show friday was cool too.  We played really good and got a free frankenixon show out of it.  They were definately an awesome band. Well, its sunday and i got a whole lot of nothing to do.  Gotta love sundays."

"event","What an awesome weekend.  My plan friday was to get just flat out destroyed and that worked very well.  Brians party was good as usual. Afterwards i headed out to a party at my friends co-op. On the way out there i ended up going into some party to use their bathroom and wound up chillin there for about a half hour.  I also made it over to pita pit for the first time ever.  That place sure puts Mr Pita to shame. I never thought id say that.  Saturday started off kinda slow but then Elle came at about 1130 and met up with me at party.  It was fun watchin douchey frat guys try to find some rhythem.  Then yesterday me, alex and jon started coming up with ideas for a short film for MSUs film festival.  Our desired reaction is  ""wait.. huh?... whoa, what the fuck?"" or something along those lines.  i wish we had some sort of massive budget and could get a few explosions in there and have vin deisel play the lead roll. But we dont have much money so we might just have to settle on david spade."

Today was fucking beautiful. The siblings and I saw Ari Hest play in Ann Arbor today.. and I swear to God.. my life is almost complete. His set was amazing, he played mostly new stuff, but his voice in person is even more phenomenal. He's funny, talented, and quite beautiful. I ended up buying his new EP 'Guilty Hearts,' and a shirt.. and the best is yet to come!

After his set, he was signing autographs!! So, the siblings and I waited in line.. assuming I'd keep my cool. I was a little flustered, but then when it was my turn, everything went hooey. I started crying like a little girl.. of course, but I proceeded to tell him how I was in absolute awe of his performance and his music in general. He took my obnoxious tears quite gracefully, hugged me TWICE, and signed my CD. I swear to God.. I'm never washing myself again.. and his fingerprints will remain on me forever haha.

well, I'm off to have oh-so-sweet dreams about the dishy singer..


p.s. (I'm kidding about the shower.. I'm not that gross)

lots o' love kids."

"event","i'm sincerely going to make an effort to not be such a lazy piece of crap this summer.

i mean, i've always wanted to.. but today kind of showed me.. that i need to do something worth while.

i woke up at 2.. and now it's 6, and all i've done is sit around in my PJs and watch horrible TV because we dont have cable.

so, therefore i think, instead of just saying ""hey, im gonna do stuff with myself,"" i might actually do it.

so, i think im gonna get a job somewhere, stop blowing the gym off, and stop eating fatty foods, stop spending my money like im addicted to crack, and make more of an effort to hang out with people, because while i dont have my phone.. i still have the house phone and the internet.

that being said, i think since my mom is just AWOL, i'm off to maybe do a little house-cleaning/unpacking while i listen to horrible music.

i'll chat with you kids later."

it seems that things are actually going well for our friend cherilyn. so far, no bummers to report.. except finals..

but i find myself actually happy for once. of course it will most likely be temporary. but, im going to enjoy it while i can.

today was so fun, megan, rich, and john came up to visit me. and even though it was dreary outside, and the dairy store was closed, i had a blast, and i forgot how cool it was to just hang out. ended up spending $80 @ old navy, but i dont care, the clothes were cute and i needed them. diddy can kiss my ass.

i find myself smiling 10 times more, and you know what, i like it. i dont even care that i have mounds of homework, and that im probably gonna delay doing until 2 in the morning. im too happy to care.

well, now that im done being an overly-giddy ass, i think im gonna procrastinate a little more.. and play mindless puzzle games, because i can."

and everything is working out and such, except when it comes to german, of course. i chose to take german 420 & 460, like advanced and linguistic shit.

the problem is that both of those are quite rigid with open sections.. so therefore, i had to fuck my schedule allll up, and now i have an 8:30 that im going to kill myself over. i mean, if it was an easy class, i could cope, but its international econ. so, im gonna HAVE to go, and gonna HAVE to pay attention. ughhhh.

but other than that, i took some sweet classes, like this theater humanities class, where you get to write plays and such, and a bunch of business-y classes like accounting and such.

and on top of this frustration.. i currently am not sure where my 5/3rd debit card is. it's not in my little card holder thing, and i KNOW i brought it back with me, because i used it to buy gas, and i distinctly remember putting it back in my card thing... but its not there.

so that makes my cell, AND my debit card. wow.. im fucking retarded.

"event","i apologize for always writing bummer entries.. but i mean.. bummers are all im encountering lately.

i think i missed the deadline for summer aid here @ msu. therefore, if i want to take classes to better my grades, and actually try to catch up.. i have to make money appear magically or something, because lord knows i dont have it, nor will my father front it, unless i become his slave, and profess my love for denise.

i dont think this higher medicine dose (for my 'ADD') is working.. because although i might be concentrating a little better while reading.. i still procrastinate at all opportunities (even if its just sitting for hours at my computer and playing solitaire) and i still have left a class going: ""wtf just went on."" now i know alot of you are thinking: ""well i procrastinate too, and i dont have ADD."" well, this may very well be so. the problem w/ people who have ADD and procrastinate is that they will do ANYTHING to prevent having to do whatever it is.. (ie as i mentioned before, my frequent solitaire lapses, which have now expanded to both MahJong and Sudoku).

i have absolutely no willpower, nor do i keep any of my promises. im always telling myself that im going to eat better (while i dont eat horribly now, theres still room for improvement), and im going to exercise. none of which have happened. i also told myself that i was gonna slow down on the drinking so that maybe i could shed a few pounds. thats not happening either. thursday i went out and got smashed, on beer no less, which is horribly fattening. and friday, had the party not fallen through, i would have gotten smashed again.

i thought the roommate thing was improving. but, sadly, its not. although we dont verbally fight anymore, i still find myself abiding by her rules, and letting her boss me around like her little lap dog. she never takes the trash out, nor does she even CONSIDER cleaning the bathroom.. she uses my cell phone and my computer, always putting on the song she wants to listen to on my iTunes, and messing w/ my controls, she tells me not to play certain songs.. and i actually listen to her. everything she says. like a fucking asshole. saturday night, i knew i wasnt going out, because i was just tired as a mofo and beat.. so i was gonna stay in and chill. i get home, and she goes to bed at like 10:30ish. i had the TV on, quite quiet mind you, and she told me (didnt ask mind you) to turn it off because she had a ""headache."" and i did it, and ended up in the dark, playing mahjong and sudoku because i had nothing else better to do.

i feel like im distancing myself from certain friends/family members. my brother and i were inseperable. now i think he sees me as more of a burden than his sister. im so insecure in our relationship.. and i always feel that he doesnt love me.. and idk how to stop feeling that way, and its taking its toll on both of us.

last part, and i swear i'll stop whining. im sooo dreading the future, money wise. soon im going to have to make payments on my credit card. im so broke its ridiculous, i cant even afford the $75 application fee for my apartment next year. and rent for that apartment starts august first. i missed the deadline to apply in the caf.. therefore im jobless this summer.. unless by some miracle i actually find one. and its gonna be really tough, i didnt even find a job last summer, and if that happens to me this summer, i'll have no way of paying for my credit card, my gym membership, my car insurance, or my apartment rent. my father is going to disown me."

in linguistics today, we were discussing different forms of word formations, one being invention. this is the case where a word is just made up out of the blue and given a meaning..

as we were discussing examples like ""geek,"" ""nerd,"" and ""bootylicious"" (which started my gag reflex up).. some girl raised her hand with an example.

what's her example, you ask? it was ""muggle."" which is some Harry Potter word.. i dont even care to give it a meaning.. and then we spent at least a half an hour of class time talking about various made-up Harry Potter words.. i swear.. it was ridiculous.

"event","i think after st. patty's day.. i'm gonna give drinking a little rest. this week was crazy. i was in panama.. i was sober approximately 30% of the time.. but didnt puke at all (and i treated this as an accomplishment).. however.. last night was ridiculous. i was chugging rum (chugging liquor apparently seems to be my new pastime). and i was beligerent.. again. (when i told myself earlier that day that i'd take it easy.) i apparently didnt stop after consuming a good amount of my FIFTH of rum. i went on to drink more beer, and then run from my brother with a shot of pucker in my hand, because i wanted to take it, and he didnt want me to.

so i ended up puking and crying.. a classic cherilyn situation. crying about some stupid shit, ie, ""i love michael (my brother) so much, and he doesnt love me at all,"" using evidence such as: ""i'm not even on his top 8 on myspace."" yes, it was absurd.

dont get me wrong, i always have fun while drinking, and i love recalling the stupid shit i do in the morning.. but i mean, i think i need a little break.. i'm a little sick of being other people's burdens, and i'm a little sick of the choices i make while drunk.

so, after st. patty's day (a MUST drunken holiday), i think im gonna take it easy. and ease out of it for a while, only having maybe like one beer or something. but no more puking, crying, or chugging rum. my liver is going to die."

"event","oh lord. last night.. sam and i saw coldplay in concert, with fiona apple. 

fiona apple is spectacular on stage. she's lively, and her voice is just sultry.. and soulful. i very much enjoyed her portion of the show. and she was also very supportive of coldplay.

and after the intermission (in which sam and i bought big pops, and then i immediately spilled mine as i tripped up the stairs, and i now, as a result have bruises and 3 scratches on my arm shaped kind of like C's.).. coldplay came on, their opener being ""Square One"".. not one of my total favorites.. but still a good song. 

i cried. like a little bitch. as i knew i would. they proceeded to rock the house, chris being very charismatic, running through the aisles, playing with the balloons that fell down, and going crazy on the piano in a way only someone like stevie wonder would do. they proceeded to play some of my faves including: politik, trouble, clocks, in my place, the scientist, x & y.. etc, with their encores being 'swallowed in the sea' (which was phenomenal) and 'fix you.' 

all in all.. the concert was amazing, we found our way to and from the palace with ease, we made our own matching coldplay tank-tops (shut up, it was cute) which generated alot of reactions/sneak peeks at our chestal regions.. we signed the petition for ""Make Trade Fair"" so that we support our beloved chris, and we bought a shirt and a patch. 

it was one of the best nights of my life. and i look forward to their future shows."

"event","so. last night, i had a big blow out, with my new russian cunt whore roommate.

i thought i could handle her.. but i now know that even i, the MASTER of passive-agressivism, cant keep my 'happy face' on around her.

so chuck came up this weekend. (mind you all, i TOLD her that a BOY was coming up to STAY THE NIGHT, and she didnt say a god damn word about it.) so we rented a couple movies. and we were just having a very low-key hang out session. she was gone all day, at tennis shit.. and then comes home.. and we offer to go in my suitemates room, because although she is a cunt, i try not to piss her off. and still, at this point she's OK. so, because we couldnt sleep, we stay up till like 4ish, and we come in the room, super super quiet. she apparently is ALREADY awake, and says: ""cherilyn, this is room for 2 girls."" and i was like.. umm ok.. and then she goes on for like 20 minutes on how she has a competition and how she doesnt want him in the room. so he slept in the fucking lounge, like a homeless person, because again, i'm not a selfish fuck, and i try to make her comfortable, this being one of her first times in america. so, after that, i thought everything was fine.

the next day, im a little sick, because the ketchup i had at IHOP was bad, and i was puky. so chuck wanted to stay up a little longer, which i didnt see a huge problem with. she comes home around 8ish.. and just looks at me for a second.. and says: ""what is with this cherilyn? you want him to sleep here?"" (IN FRONT OF HIM, mind you). and i said: ""no, dont worry, he's going home tonight."" and then i told her he was staying because i was a little sick, and she says: ""i dont even want to hear,"" and then proceeded to storm out of the room.

so, last night, it was quiet in the room, and it was 11ish, because i had just gotten off work, and talked to my mom and sister. she was going to bed and said: ""cherilyn, i go to bed, shut everything off"" (just ORDERS me to do shit.. not thinking twice about it). and i said, well, i dont have a problem putting my headphones on, but i have homework to do. then she tells me i can go in the lounge with my computer.. and i was like, well there's no internet in there.

this set her off, she begins to YELL at me, straight out, about the weekend, and how she had a competition, and she didnt want me having some guy up here.. and all this other shit. it was horrible.. she wouldnt shut her mouth.. and i got so mad i couldnt even look at her, i was shaking, and then i cried.. because it's just ridiculous that she's such a selfish bitch to me.. and i let her use my computer, and i serve her every need..

so, now i have to go through some mediation or something, which im sure she either wont understand, or wont give a shit about.. so im pretty much fucked for the rest of the semester. but one thing is for damn sure, im done doing shit for her. she can find some other computer, one that wont care if she's a huge fucking cunt."

well, not to worry cherilyn, its not dan. i get another text later in the day, around now-ish.  they said they saw a pic of me, and thought i was hot. i was confused, because dan has seen me in person.  so then i ask: ""who is this?"" and the answer is Krystina.

thats right. some girl i have no fucking clue who it is, texts me, because she found my number on facebook. she then proceeds to ask if she could ""please me,"" and how she wants to meet me and shit.

i just want to know, what the fuck it is about me that says: ""creepy weirdos, feel free to stalk me, and put me in uncomfortable situations."" because it seems to happen waaaay too often. how depressing."

"event","so. this weekend, saturday night. megan and the lynzz are up visiting, and i want to show them a good time. so i talk to a few people, and nothings panning out. so i call the guy from work, that gave me his number.

let me make that clear, HE gave ME his number.

and i was like: ""hey, its cherilyn, hows it going"" and such. and then i was like: ""well i was just seeing if maybe you wanted to hang out."" and then he says: ""umm.. tonights not such a good night."" and i was like.. ""umm ok then."" and then he says: ""well i have alot of stuff going on, ok bye.""

what the fuck is that? i mean, dont give me your number, if you have no intentions of actually hanging out with me. ass. also, come up with better excuses. ugh.

so we went & hung out with the gina, and things went swimmingly afterwards.

anyway, on a lighter note.. I HAVE COLDPLAY TICKETS!!!! thats right, i'll be seeing them Wednesday, February 22nd, at 7:30 p.m. at the palace. i would say something like: ""jealous much?"" or ""dont hate me.."" but i have to remember that no one gives a rats ass about them anymore.

so whatever, im elated, and i'll be creaming my jeans on that date ;)"

i dont know what my problem is.

on top of it all, i asked diddy for Coldplay tickets, for my bday/christmas, because i had heard a commercial, (and i am 100 % sure i heard this, and 100 % sure the info was correct), that said they'd be coming Feb. 22 at the palace.  i was elated, because i knew diddy would buy them.

however, life likes to take shits on cherilyn, because diddy called yesterday.  apparently there is no such date on ticketmaster.  so the one thing i was counting on to revive me from this rut of horridness.. is out the window.

as a cop out, i decided to explain the whole ""Paul is dead"" conspiracy that the beatles orchestrated back in the day, because i had already done a report on it.  however, i forgot that it has to intertwine with german culture.  

so i present this topic to him, and he says he'd rather me do it on the beatles' career in germany. because hes a dick.  i mean, how am i gonna talk for 10 minutes on how they had 2 german songs?  im allowed to play them.. but only a minute of each. so i have to come up with 8 minutes of bullshit to survive.

yeah, so sunday, my dad wants to go out to lunch right? and for the last couple weeks, he's been taking a general interest in my life right?  ie, he's been calling to ask about chuck, and how school was, and offering me more money and such.  and i found this weird, because usually he only calls me when i owe him money.  so i was boggled by the whole sitch.

so we go to baker's square, as per michael's suggestion, and we went with him and denise. we order and such, and bullshit around and whatever.  

then, i find out why he was really calling, and pretending to have an interest in my life.  apparently, a week from yesterday, he's going to the hospital to have major surgery. i guess he has some sort of tumor-like growth in his stomach, that apparently weighs something like 20 pounds.  

we dont know if its cancerous yet.. but it just makes sense now, that since he has a minor threat on his life.. he'll pretend like he gives a rat's ass about my life.

Your birth on the 25th day of the month (7 energy) modifies your life path by giving you some special interest in technical, scientific, or other complex and often hard to understand subjects. 
You may become something of a perfectionist and a stickler for details. 
Your thinking is logical and intuitive, rational and responsible. 

Your feelings may run deep, but you are not very likely to let them show. 
This birthday makes you a more private person, more introspective and perhaps more inflexible. 
In friendships you are very cautious and reserved. 
You are probably inventive, and given to unique approaches and solutions.</font></td></tr></table><div align=""center""><a href=""http://www.blogthings.com/whatdoesyourbirthdatemeanquiz/"">What Does Your Birth Date Mean?</a></div>

so im talkin to joey, one of chucks best buds and closest confidants. and hes telling me more truths to other lies that chuck has told me without even flinching.  joey's also telling me his opinions on chuck, which couldnt have been more in sync with mine.

furthermore, i just got a call from chuck, not even more than a minute ago, and he asked what i was doing, and i made the mistake of telling him that i was talking to joey and justin.. and he automatically accuses me of ""cybering"" with joey, and having this crush on him or something.

the shit is just all piling up.. and i just dont know what to do.. i mean, i could break up with him.. but im afraid he'll lay a guilt trip or cry or something, and then i dont want to never hang out with his friends again either, because i enjoy it.. and also, his mom loooovvveess me, and i really like her too.. and im just sooooo confused right now..

am i crazy?"

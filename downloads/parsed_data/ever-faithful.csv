I am not talking about lenient parenting styles here, I am talking basically no parenting. This idiot of a woman wanted to bring her three year old into an R rated feature. Policy is that no one under six will be admitted. She throws an absolute fit and accuses us of stifling her child and tries to explain her views on parenting. Meanwhile , her wonderfully unrestricted children are tearing the place apart and walking up to strangers and asking them for money to buy soda and popcorn and calling people names when they refuse. 
About a bazillion experts have proven that kids need stability and boundaries and limits and occasionally a swift kick in the rear. Why people can't get this through their heads is beyong me. I hope to God that my child never goes to school with kids that have parents who are incapable of actually parenting their children."

I try everyday to just let something go. Whether it is resentment towards someone who wronged me, or my regret regarding something I did or didn't do. I made a deal with myself around New Years that I would do my best not to harbor hatred or anger or just general bad feeling in my heart anymore. I could give myself a day, but the next morning I had to start fresh. This is not to say that I let people walk all over me or that I don't learn from my mistakes, but I don't let my past rule me. I let as much as I can go. I choose happiness, as corny as that sounds. I look around me, at my beautiful daughter and my wonderful husband and I realize that nothing else really matters. 
I am not saying that I am always happy and that I never have a bad day. I am saying that I kind of force myself to choose to be happy . Even when I don't get everything I want or need, I still can find something in my life to be happy about because I do have WHO I want and need in my life. God, I am such a sap sometimes."

I really don't want a c section , the whole idea of being cut opne freaks me out completely. There is another thing making me anxious: when they try to trun the baby it could stress her out and send me into labor or physically effect her enough that they will have to do a c section right away. The doctor does not want to chance me going into labor with her in full breech because of the complications it could cause. Maybe I will get lucky and she will turn on her own.

Maybe the people in question didn't realize how disrespectful they were being or how far out of bounds they really were , but if they don't listen when I gently try to get them to realize what they are doing, then obviously I have to be alot firmer about it. 
What is worse is that one of these people is someone I have been nothing but nice to and I have stuck up for her in the past as well as make it known to others that I think highly of her potential. I feel like its unfair that the second I stick up for myself it turns into this senseless melodrama where people are twisting what I said so they can make me feel bad about sticking up for myself. Well, tough. I have a right to tell people that they don't have the right to tell me to shut up or otherwise be rude. I have a right to expect people to do their jobs without mocking everything I do or say . I used to think I was being extra sensitive but now I realize that I just wasn't being firm enough because some people think it is okay to try to walk all over me and then turn my defending myself into their own little ""poor me, I am so upset now because I am not allowed to behave with no regard to others"". Seriously, I took these peoples feelings into consideration for quite some time. I let alot of things slide. Way too many things.

"event","I just saw the news on CNN , where this man ( and I use the term very loosely) is suing to get his parental rights terminated because he got his girlfriend pregnant and doesn't think it is fair to have to pay child support when he did not want children. He believes that because a woman has the right to choose whether or not she is a parent, so should he . Except ....abortion is different than saying you simply refuse to acknowledge or care for a child who has already been born. See , a fetus isn't able to survive on it's own outside of the womb until sometime after the 30th week of pregnancy (in most cases), and an infant child is already alive and in our world, completely dependent on us for it's care. I am not saying that the mother of his child is completely blameless, or that he shouldn't terminate his parental rights (because obviously this asshat does not have the ability to parent anyone), what I am saying is that regardless of how this child came to be, he is responsible because he was also right there having sex. And for those of you who may not be aware of this , sex is how we continue as a species. Thats right , sex isn't just about pleasure , it is about babies. And if this guy graduated high school , then some where in his freshman or sophmore year he had to take health class, or sex ed. and should be aware of this. 
His main argument was that she knew that he didn't want children and he was told she couldn't concieve (which she may have been told she couldn't. My own mother was told she would never have another child after me because of cervical cancer , but my little brother was born anyway) and he feels that somehow , even though he didn't use protection that it was still somehow all her responsibility. So , um.....did he miss that part in health class about how to protect yourself from sexually transmitted diseases too?  Why was birth control , or lack there of solely her responsibility? 
I feel extremely lucky to be married to a good , strong man who is worthy of me and his child that I am carrying. He will help me to help our daughter value herself enough to know to stay the hell away from useless, weak men who instead of stepping up and dealing with life, place the blame for their decisions on someone else . We will teach her to love and respect herself so that she will choose a man who is strong and kind and able to meet the challenges of life. And she will be raised with the understanding and belief that it is the man who must gain the woman's approval, not the woman who must gain the man's approval."

A little noisy , but otherwise well behaved. But , of course we had some problem kids. Two boys had snuck in without paying for a ticket. I tracked them down and was in the process of escorting them out of the theatre when the one in front yells "" This is bullshit. This is motherfucking bullshit."" He was too far away for me to detain. However , the boy behind me said quite loudly "" Later niggers "" . I stopped and whipped around so fast that this kid actually bumped into me.  I then asked him in a tone of voice that would make Batman proud what he had just said, to which of course he replied ""nuthin'"" , like the winner he was.
     So I get him into the lobby , sit him down on the bench and tell one of my employees to call security cause at this point , I really want for there to be some sort of consequences for this kid. Anyway , while I am waiting for security I am basically going off on this kid. First I asked him if he knew what the word even meant to which I recieved a sullen ""yeah"" and when he confirmed understanding and knowledge of the word , I asked him how dare he use that word. How dare he use that word fully understanding the ugliness that it represents. Was he aware of the history of the word ? Is he aware of all the trials and torments that the black and brown people that have constantly had this word thrown in thier faces have had to go through? I recieved a wide eyed stare in response and then he tried to tell me that he wasn't racist that he was ""just kidding"". That just angered me further so I ended up asking him , since he was white , if anyone had ever looked down on him or treated him badly or if he was just some rich , spoiled brat . To which , I kid you not , he replied , "" I'm not rich"". Apparently he felt no need to dispute the spoiled brat part. Then I asked him if he was just ignorant. I recieved no reply. Then , unfortunately I ended up being distracted long enough for this kid to bolt. So much for my Bat skills.
       I guess that besides the use of the word nigger , as if it were no big deal, I am most upset that I had no opportunity to speak to this kids parents. I want to know if they know what their son decides to yell out in public places. I want to know if they too, are horrified and righteously angry. I want to know if they are good , upstanding people whom once they know what their wayward son is doing , will take the time to straighten him out. See, I want to believe that this was not a case of racist people raising a racist kid. I want to believe that there a more good , non-racist people in Green Bay , because seriously I keep running into the bad , very racist people who seem so surpised that the little red headed, white girl has any problem with thier behavior. Sorry , my God and Goddess love everyone and embrace uniqueness. So there. :)"

"event","Today , quite a few times I found myself ready to burst into tears. It has been what , five years now, since the 9/11 tragedy ? I still can't let it go. I was lucky this time . Unlike during the Oklahoma event, I didn't know anyone affected. The sorrow , the anger though , hits me just the same. Sorrow because the loss of life is just so damned senseless and anger because how fucking dare they ? How dare they ? Some of my liberal friends are slightly diappointed in my attitude regarding the terrorist attacks. They tried to rationalize the attack by saying that we have done far worse to people , blah , blah , blah. Maybe. Then again , maybe not. 
        The simple truth , for me anyway is this : I don't care who started what. I don't care about the different philsophies, the cultural differences or religious beliefs. None of that matters to me. At all. I just want the killing and the destruction to stop. On both sides. I realize how childish a desire that is. But again , I don't care. I am sick of revenge being called justice and I am sick of mad men leading undereducated people to their doom with false promises of glory. 
       Don't get me wrong , I am not a pacifist. I am fully aware of the cost of peace and freedom . But I can't help wondering what the hell we are doing. Since we put troops in the middle east , it seems like we aren't really there to keep peace or enforce peace. The president was even hinting at a possible occupation of Iran. Where does it stop ? Where does it end ? Because this isn't really a war . I mean , the terrorists just keep moving from country to country gathering maniacs as they go. So are we just going to randomly invade or try to take over every country that a terrorist has been in or visited ? What are we doing ? Someone please tell me , so I can understand this. So I can sleep better at night."

"event","So I was thinking about how horrible the gas prices are right now and how irritated I am that a cap wasn't put on the prices when it was at 1.99 a gallon or so. Yes people , it is perfectly legal for the government to step in and put a cap on the prices of things like gas and milk and other ""necessities"" before the prices become unbearable. A little known fact , but it is true none the less. Of course , this administration would never step in and do that because our Texan president has friends in the oil business and probably quite a few investments there himself. Anyway , gas here in Green Bay , Wisconsin is averaging out to be 3.29 a gallon. Minimum wage is currently 5.75 an hour. This means that a gallon of gasoline costs more than half of someones hourly wage. This means that someone who works at a minimum wage job for forty hours a week may have to choose between filling their tank so they can get to work , or buying food , or a toy for their child. And Goddess help them if they have to pay for daycare as well. 
What I really want to know , is how the oil companies and our lovely current administration can justify what they are doing to the lower middle class and the poor with these horrendous gas prices. I realize that some of it was unavoidable , but I can't help but feel that this is just another example of the rich staying rich by keeping the poor , poor."

It takes place in Victorian times and is actually accurate when it comes to the traditions and social restricitions placed upon people during that time. There are cameos too. Dick Grayson makes a cameo , as well as Barbara Gordon and Anita Fite (a.k.a. Empress , from Young Justice). It's a great fic and it should be read by as many people as possible."

"event","Today was an almost perfect example of why I bother with people at all. There was an incident at work in which two teen age boys were harassing a female customer . They were making racist and sexual remarks. I went to kick them out and they tried to get in my face , telling me that I should be happy that they were "" taking care of the chink slut"" . What these boys did not know is that I am married to a man who is half filipino. I am highly unlikely to join in any kind of racist reindeer games . So I firmly explain that the lady is most definately welcome to stay and that they have 3 seconds to leave before I call security. The lady , who was really a girl who couldn't have been more than 18 or 19, quietly thanks me. And then , it went bad. I was standing between her and these creeps when they decided to make a grab for her which didn't succeed because I was in the way. As they are about to shove me out of the way , there are all of a sudden 4 guys between me and the girl , and the creeps. These guys had just been passing buy , while shopping and had seen what happened. They were more than happy to keep the creeps in check while I got security. They were awesome. The security guard called the police and the guys stayed to give a statement. The best part is how embarrassed these guys were that we were gushing over their helping us. They insisted that anyone would have done the same thing and that it was no big deal. Well, it was a big deal to me because this encounter took about 20 minutes and while plenty of people passed by us , they were the only ones who stopped. They turned what could have been another story about a random hate crime into a story about 4 average Joes who were somebodies heroes for just a little while."

"event","I work in a movie theatre , and because of this I see tons of kids both with and without their parents on an almost daily basis. I cannot tell you how many parents are just not bothering to instill any common courtesy or even decency in their children . These people are also the parents who will swear that Hollywood and other various forms of media are ""ruining"" thier children. Yeah . Fine , then how about you don't take your eight year old to see Sin City. Better yet , how about you don't throw a fit when you are told you can't take your six year old to The Texas Chainsaw Massacre because our theatre policy doesn't allow for children six and under to enter a rated R movie for any reason . And why , for the love of the Goddess , would anyone want to expose their young children to something like that ? I have heard the various excuses these parents come up with : He/She can handle it , It's my kid I'll decide what they can and can't see and my personal favorite : They see worse on TV. Then why are you letting them watch that program you dumb ass ? In what way does any child benefit from being exposed to senseless and brutal violence at an early age ? 

   And then there are the parents that will let their kid watch any movie so long as there is no sex or nudity. What the hell kind of message is this ? People being murdered , tortured or torn apart is fine , but please don't show any nudity or physical expressions of love. 

But what really bothers me is that eventually we will have our own child and my kid will have to go to school with these little psychos that have been completely desensitized to violence . 

Bright Lady , Blessed Consort please watch over our children because apparently we are incapable of doing so ourselves."

"event","So everyone and their grandmother is now giving me advice on how to successfully concieve a child. Yeah thanks. Really ? I have to have sex to get pregnant ? No way ! I thought that that was just a nasty rumor . Sigh. 

I realize that people are just trying to be helpful and that they really do mean well. Honestly though , I just want them to shut the fuck up . Half the stuff they recommend has absolutely no scientific basis and some of it is just down right rude. 

I regret telling anyone that we are trying to have a baby . And I am so sick of being asked why we haven't concieved yet when we have only been trying for four months. I'm sorry , some people just don't get pregnant at the drop of a hat. No , there is nothing wrong with either one of us , yes we have seen doctors , it just takes some people longer than others. And Jesus Christ , to every member of our respective families : We are horribly sorry that we are not conceiving according to your time table . We will try much harder in the future to get pregnant on your schedule and as quickly as possible for your convenience. Now back the fuck off , you fucking harpies !!!"

I found that angry music (NIN, Disturbed, Korn, Rollins Band) doesn't necessarily make me angry, sometimes it energizes me and other times it just depresses me . New Age music(Enya, Clannad, etc) always makes me feel at peace , and the misic from Enigma always makes me feel sexy. I draw a complete blank from most country and pop , however there is this relatively new artist who could be classified as pop that I have recently realized is somehow writing about my life and feelings and singing about it all in a beautiful voice. Anna Nalick. Yep. Angsty and a little weepy at times, she is also very empowering because she puts it all out there and says ""here it is...now what are you going to do with it ?"" Everyone needs to go get her cd. Now."

To the point where I believe that they have no right to have kids. Some times I think that there should be a test or something you should have to take before you have kids to prove that you won't completely fuck them up. How can people just purposely hurt their children ? I just don't understand it. There is absolutely no good reason to abuse and demolish your kid emotionally and take out shit on them because you are unhappy with your life. I propose treating shitty parents with shock collars."

So many of them are going away to college next fall and they are in for a shock. College is a lot like a bigger high school , but the rules are different. Yeah, you still have your cliques and your back stabbers , but believe it or not more and more people are leaning away from it cause they realize it just doesn't matter. It really doesn't. In the corporate setting people don't have time for gossip mongers and alot of the head honchos I know won't put up with it at all - one warning and then you're out . Anything that interferes with work and people doing their jobs effectively is taken care of immediately even if that means firing someone. Or even firing both parties.
    Anyway , I work with these kids, that are so full of energy and ideas and I fell like they are wasting them , wasting it all on bull shit. They could be doing so much better , making a real difference. But no. They won't possibly expend effort into helping other people or doing something positive. They'll just keep wallowing in misery and complaining about how no one understands them . Screw that . I totally understand . Misery is easy . Happiness takes real effort. They are too lazy to be happy."

"event","I think that it is funny how we all go through phases.  

I remember being a kid and I couldn't wait to grow up.  I loved that song by the Beach Boys that said, ""Wouldn't it be nice if we were older than we wouldn't have to wait so long.""  I loved most of the Beach Boys songs.  I love that style of music.  

When I was a teenager I wanted to find my true love and eventually get married and have kids.  I couldn't wait.

Recently I have had feelings of wanting to be younger.

This past year, I have really wanted to adopt.  I am not exactly sure why but, I do.  In fact logically it doesn't make a lot of sense but yet, I still do.  I used to have dreams when I was a kid about rescuing a baby that was on the side of the road in a ditch.  I tried to find the baby's Mom and when she could not be found, I cared for the baby as my own.  I recently had a dream that my sister and I found some abandoned triplets and she helped me to care for them though she was quite hesitant at first.  I guess I am believing that when and if the time is right that God will work it all out.  The problem is that I am not the most patient person.  Sometimes if I let the devil have his way I can get discouraged.  Satan is good at reminding me of all the times I have tried to do things and failed which really stinks.  He will also remind me of all of the dreams that seem to just sit.  When you focus on the past you can get really depressed.  I am learning to ignore the past though I have been known to be quite sentimental, nostaligic and a pack rat which makes it difficult.  Sometimes Satan will tell me that I am alone and that no one understands me.  Whether or not this is true, I am learning to ignore it and remember God knows and cares.  I guess I am realizing that you can't focus on whether or not you feel alone, this too will just depress you.

The most interesting thing that I have learned this year (actually this past few weeks)is something that I relearned and probably will continue to relearn.  The most interesting thing that I learned is that satan is a liar in fact, he is the father of lies.  He has taken lying to the extreme.  I think that he believes that each lie is a deceptive, confusing masterpiece in which he will meld a little truth with a lot of lies.  What I realized is that what he creates is abstract and not a concrete reality.

Anyways old habits die hard and I am learning that it takes persistent training to overcome a bad habit."

I typed in several photos and I usually got mostly the same people and a few different ones.  Anyways it does both male and female but I got barely any men that I look like.  One of the men that I did get was Liberace and I laughed but when I looked him up, I was surprised that we had a lot in common.  He was Polish and Italian.  My Mom is Polish and my step-dad is Italian.  He had a twin who died at birth.  My dad has a twin and my I lost one when I was pregnant with my son.  We both have an interest in music and people.  We both have musical families including pianists.  He enjoyed acting and so do I.  He owned an antique store and I love antiques.  I just thought that it was interesting."

"event","I have had some of the craziest dreams lately.  I had one dream that the kids and I where running from a tornado.  We ran past a trailor park because I didn't feel that it was safe.  We ended up in a strangers house.  

I also had a dream that my sister and I were walking through a slummy city in like a third world country.  We were at an open market type place.  Next to a fruit stand was a 'changing station'.  It was a station that had shelves stacked with diapers and wipes and such for changing babies.  On the ground were 3 babies wearing diapers and wraped in a thin baby blanket.  I picked up the one and realized that he was poopy.  My sister said, ""you are not going to change him are you?""  I looked around and there was no one around and I said, ""yes I am, this baby needs a diaper change.""  So I changed the babies diaper.  Then I asked my sister to help me carry the babies.  They appeared to be triplets and only a month or two old.  They were african babies with very black, curly hair.  I thought one of them was a girl.  Anyways after hesitating my sister said that she would carry one of the babies and I carried the other two.
 
I had a dream that Pete was working on something top secret for work.  Then some guys found out and kidnapped him and some other guys that were on his team.  I was with him but escaped through a glass door that was shuting fast.  I barely made it.  I quickly dialed 911 and flew to escape getting caught by a security guard type guy.  The police came and broke into the building they told me that Pete was gone that he had been beaten in the head and thrown into something.  I didn't believe the police and went in to find him.  I asked the police why they did it was it for his secret intellegence and they said we think it was for money or to get the kids.  Then the police asked me where my kids were and I said ""oh my gosh, I left them at the sitters"" and I ran to get them.  (That part reminded me of Incredibles).  

Anyways I have been having some weird dreams."

"event","So yesterday my Mom calls me on the phone and says that she needs help moving Casey into her house.  I have known Casey since I was a little kid and she is like a grandma to me.  Well when we got to her house Casey was in a wheel chair and unable to move her legs.  We were told that she had fallen out of her chair that morning and that she had fallen a few times during the week.  My Mom looked at her legs which were oozing yellow stuff and smelled.  They were badly swollen especially the right.  We realized that it would be difficult to move her because she was in some kind of pain though she never screamed or cried.  My Mom said, ""I bet her hip is broke.""  So I took one of the seats out of my van. My brother, Peter and I lifted her wheelchair while my Mom lifted and stabilized her legs.  We put her in the van and seatbelted her wheelchair to the van.  It was interesting.  I was so nervous driving that I was shaking.  I didn't want to stop to fast and really hurt her.  
     When we got back to my Mom's house another family friend was waiting along with my husband to help us.  The friend regularly worked with the elderly.  She saw Casey's swollen legs and yellow coloring and said she is going to the ER.  The friend, Terry, jumped into my van and we headed out to the ER.  When we got there two men and I lifted her out of the van.  Then I held her legs and shuffled backwards while they pushed her to her room.  I had high heels on so this was a bit challenging.  When we go to the room they had to lift her onto the bed.  My guess is that she has probably been to a doctor's less than five times in her life and so she was quite nervous.  They had to take X-rays which I explained to her were like pictures.  One of the x-ray techs was a little rough with her.  After they saw the x-rays they realized that her right hip bone was completely broken and displaced.  She would not take any pain medication though.  From that point on they treated her a little better and after that they brought the x-ray machine to her.  They also gave her food to eat and a put in a catheter.  I fought back tears after finding out the severity of her hip.  She is a tough, tough lady especially for 90.  Terry and I tried our best to make her comfortable.  We left the hospital close to 1:00 in the morning.  I got a couple of Happy Birthdays as I was leaving the hospital since it was already the 19th.  Anyways today she may have to have her hip replaced.  
     
     My step-dad ironically went to the same hospital this morning.  He had a scheduled heart surgery.  I don't think that it was invasive.  My Mom just called to say that it was successful.  Praise God. I will try to visit them both.  It should be an interesting day.

If you have a minute please say a prayer.  Thanks"

"event","So Friday was a weird day.  I did the usual get my daughter off to school, pick her up etc.  My brother asked me to pass out flyer's and posters for a concert that they were having that evening.  It seemed a little late but I thought, what the heck.  So I headed out.  My objectives were to just post the signs and hand out the flyer's.  In the process I managed to score a discount on pizza with free delivery for the concert.  I also scored two ""one month free"" tanning packages as door prizes for the concert without even asking.  (Later I ended up winning the one tanning package but told them to draw someone elses name as I didn't think this would be fair.)  Anyways than after all of this fun I went into a party store that is co-owned by a fellow elementary school parent.  I walked in and at first thought it was the elementary school students dad but later realized it was his partner.  Anyways, there was a guy in front of me in line who was buying a huge bag of menthol tobacco.  I guess he would have to roll the cigarettes himself.  Anyways he then told me that I had extremely beautiful eyes.  I laughed and said thanks.  Then he said, ""don't tell my girlfriend I said that she will kick my butt.""  Then he talked to the co-owner guy behind the counter for a few.  Then there was a pause. Then looking at no one he muttered, ""have sex with me tonight?""  He wasn't looking at me but besides the 38 year old guy behind the counter, I was the only one in the store.  I was standing right behind him in line.  I said nothing and the owner guy was like, ""what did you say!?!""  He was like, nothing, it was nothing, I am glad you didn't hear it.  Then he left.  Weird, weird.
Than I went to the church and picked up my brother.  We headed to the football game.  We passed out 200 flyers and than decided to leave at half time.  Well we got stopped at the gate and the lady thought that I was a high schooler.  The lady next to her said, ""I don't think that she is a high schooler...""  Then I showed her my license and told her how old I was.  She was surprised and I think she felt bad but I told her that it was cool.  She said that she used to be like that and had a younger looking face.  I got my hand stamped so I could get back in if I wanted and we left.

Back to the coffee house we went. The concert was good.  At the end I was handed the microphone and started singing with the band and possibly embarrassed my less crazy relatives that were there.  It was so loud I had no idea what I was singing since there were no monitors either.  It was fun though in my heart I feel I could have sung better.  I kind of had lost my voice from talking so much to people at the football game and then shouting to talk to people at the coffee house because of the loud music.  After the show I talked and prayed with some of the band members.

It was an eventful night.  I thought I would crash when I got home but I actually couldn't sleep so I got on the pute.  OK that's it.  

Weird Friday."

Sometimes it's hard to keep on doing good.  I have been learning not to rely on any person but solely on God.  I am learning how to not be self-seeking.  I am learning how to persist in doing good even to those who do not do good to me.  It is a very hard lesson for me to learn but I am sure I will be stronger in the end."

"event","So this guy Kirk and his wife started coming to our church recently.  I went to high-school with his wife.  I didn't hang out with her though because she was a grade older and we didn't really have classes together.  Anyways a few weeks ago he forgot or lost his guitar pick so I gave him one I had in my wallet.  This week I brought my guitar to have him tune it and he gave me a nice guitar tuner.  It was awesome and instead of me spending an hour tuning my guitar by ear, it took me about 5-10 minutes to tune it with a little device.  I was elated.  I was really happy.  Then after practice I decided out of the blue to show/sing one of the songs that I am working on to Kirk.  He immediately grabbed his guitar and put chords to it.  It only took him like 10 minutes give or take.  I was impressed, seriously impressed.  Anyways he was like you have perfect pitch because you sang the whole song perfectly in the key of C.  I was like, ""I did?!""  Cool.  I just sing what sounds right to me but I am not always perfect.  Anyways he used to play guitar at my sister's church.  My sister is the worship leader/lead singer at her church.  Her new husband is the bass player.  Kirk said that he had asked my sister many, many times to write some music for him and she never did.  I have been practically begging people to play my music and Kirk was more than happy.  I really believe God is so good and amazing and wonderful to me."

"event","Pete has been pulled over a handful of times for rediculous things and it is always when I am around.  When we were dating and he was 21 he had never been pulled over before.  One night after we had gone out to a restaurant to eat we were sitting in the parking lot ""talking"".  We had taken separate cars and I got out and got into mine and pulled out.  Pete pulled out behind me and immediately a police officer pulled him over.  The police officer said that he just wanted to know why Pete was sitting in the car.  Rediculous.  I pulled off about 50 feet at a gas station and walked over to the scene to see what the heck was going on and to have a talk with the rude police officer and then he let Pete go.  Then Pete and I were driving one night late trying to put the kids to sleep.  A police officer that I had met before pulled Pete over for apparently not coming to a complete stop at a stop sign, which was rediculous.  After talking with us a few minutes he let us go which was decent.  Then Pete and I had just bought a used car and I was following him home.  We had just barely got out onto the road and a police officer pulled him over.  I confirmed what Pete was saying that we had just bought the car 5 minutes before and that we were on our way home.  He let us go.  Then this last week, Pete and I went to the mall.  Apparently our taillight was out though it goes out periodically because of a bad wire but Pete or I had never been pulled over for it.  So we get pulled over right before we are going to turn into Red Robin to eat because we are hungry.  The 2 young police officers approaced our car from both sides all sneaky like like we were freakin murderers or something.  I had just got off the phone with my sister and Pete started rolling down my window.  I looked up to find a police officer in my face on the passenger side with a freakish look on his face.  I screamed because he practically scared the crap out of me.  Is this standard for police officers to approach family mini vans with baby car seats in them as if they were convicted criminals?  What is wrong with police officers these days?  They scared the heck out of my kids in the back seat and me who were just shopping at the mall all over one tail light being out.  Rediculous ok"

I called the fire department and they said that they had issued a burning permit to that neighbor.  ""But it is raining out and it is supposed to rain all day,"" I said.  ""My throat is burning and my voice sounds as if I have smoked a pack of cigarettes,"" I continued.  He did not care.  Does anyone know if you vote for the fire chief or if they are hired in????  I know that I will be campaigning for a new fire chief if we get the chance to vote.  I will go door to door, I will put signs in my yard.  I am sick of this crap.  I want a fire chief in office that doesn't smoke cigarettes and understands what asthma or a burning throat feels like.  It would be nice to have a fire chief who understands the dangers of burning poison oak, ivy and sumac since it is rampant in my neighborhood. Well that is it for now."

Then, the other day Pete told me that we had a raccoon in our trash can and so he put the lid on it.    Well with the given heat I didn't want the little guy to suffocate and I really didn't want to mess with it.  I had called several places and most would not help.  The ones that would said that they would charge me $50-over $100 to remove a raccoon.  I didn't really have that kind of cash.  I just kept calling a list of people that I found on the internet.  Then I found a guy who lived in the same city as me.  He said that he was busy but because I lived so close by that he would come and help me out.  He came out and had a Jesus t-shirt on.  When he opened the trash lid, there were 2 raccoons inside.  He got rid of them for me and returned my trash can and left without letting me pay him a cent.  I realized after the fact that he was actually in the phone book and had a business of removing animals.  I could not believe how wonderful it all worked out.  God is so good to me."

During one of the games we had an 8 point lead before they even scored a point.  We were excited about the wins and joked that we had a sister connection.  Derek and Pete had a hard time losing.  When we were winnning the third game Tammy said that we should have made a bet.  I told Pete that if I won than he had to do the laundry. Tammy thought that was funny.  Derek said that if they won then he was going to do nothing all day tomorrow.  We won.  It was a fun, relaxing time."

Please check out the above link.  I don't know if this story is true but please read it.  The bottom line is that there are people in the world much much worse off financially etc. than we are and God doesn't love them any less.  Please pray for the orphans of the world and that people across the globe would value life more.  If they could understand how much God loves them that he would crucify his only perfect son for them maybe this would help.  If you would like to donate money to the help Pete and I foster/aid/adopt a child please let me know.  I am convinced that there are thousands of children and babies worldwide in bad conditions in need of a home yet the cost to adopt just one child internationally seems to be $10,000-$30,000 or more.  I don't understand why it costs so much to adopt a child who desperately needs help but if that's what it costs than isn't a child worth it?

Any suggestions/prayers would be appreciated.  Children are a wonderful gift from God.

D 
Once you get it into your head that you want someone, you move full steam ahead in pursuit. You do not give up your quest easily. You are nurturing and caring. If someone has a problem, this turns you on. You are highly sexual, passionate, loyal, and intense in your involvements, sometimes possessive and jealous. Sex to you is a pleasure to be enjoyed. You are stimulated by the eccentric and unusual, having a free and open attitude

M 
You are emotional and intense. When involved in a relationship, you throw your entire being into it. Nothing stops you; there are no holds barred. You are all-consuming and crave someone who is equally passionate and intense. You believe in total sexual freedom. You are willing to try anything and everything. Your supply of sexual energy is inexhaustible. You also enjoy mothering your mate."

"event","Pete and I went to a Toby Mac and Mercy Me concert on Saturday.  Toby was amazing as always.  We sat in the second row but I actually got to go right up to the stage and dance.  Before the concert I stood in line to get Toby's autograph.  I talked to him for a minute or two and told him that he reached multiple generations and to keep up the good work.  I got a picture or two and went back to my seat.  When they were on stage I felt like Toby Mac was singing right to me.  At the end of the show Gabe was throwing out water bottles.  He threw 3 in my general direction.  Pete picked up one and caught like 2 of the water bottles.  He gave the 2 away and then I told him I wanted to keep one so I kept the third.  After Toby played we waited for Mercy Me.  I went over to the side and talked with Bob Smiley the comedian who is friends with Toby Mac.  Bob is hilarious, seriously funny.  I talked with him for 5 to 10 minutes.  He showed me how to open a Cd case easier and than signed it for me.  Then a few minutes later Pete caught a T-shirt and a bracelet from Smile FM that Bob threw.  Jen from Smile FM was a little mad that he threw it to Pete and not a little kid.  The comedian made fun of Pete for beating up a little girl to get it only there was no little girl within 10 feet of him and the shirt went right to him.  Then he gave the shirt to me and I guess I am a little girl so that is cool.  It was nice to have the XL T-shirt when the temperature started to drop outside.  The t-shirt was quite large on me though and it covered my shorts so it looked like I was just wearing a t-shirt.  Pete said that it looked like a dress on me.  hahahhahaha oh well.  I got a picture or two of Toby on the side lines.  I was a regular paparazzi.  The night was amazing.  I really felt like God spoiled me.  Pete and I had a good time and I am glad that he has such great hands for catching everything though it did seem like sometimes they were aiming for us. hahahahahaha  What a cool night.  I will probably never forget it.  God is good.

Also, a girl that was in my daughters kindergarten classes Mom was there.  What are the chances of that?  She sat in the row right in front of me and I was like your daughter is Ashley.  She was like yeah I knew I recognized you.  I got to help teach the kids computers every Thursday at the elementary so I got to meet all of the kids and some of the parents.  It was fun.  Also a lady that I was talking to who sat next to me told me that I looked like I was 19 and Pete looked 31.  Then she apologized profusely.  Hahhahhahha I loved it.  Since Pete is 30 I didn't really think she should have apologized for saying 31.  I think Pete knows that he looks a little older than me and is ok with it.  It really made my day that she thought that I looked 19.  God is good.

Please pray for Pete's grandma as the doctor said that she has a brain tumor that seems to have popped up rather quickly and they are doing surgery today.

Thank you to everyone who read this LJ.  Remember God is good."

Once or maybe twice I reached for Pete's and she was like, ""this is yours,"" as she pushed my  glass closer to me.  I thought the girl was strange.  As time progressed I noticed her with a big chessy smile on her face and she was very friendly with Pete.  She would crack a joke and than giggle.  She asked Pete how he was doing many times.  When my chicken sandwhich came out I noticed that the grilled chicked was barely warm.  I like my food at least warm.  This was rough but I said nothing to the waitress.  Pete then I guess moved the bill on the table so that Elizabeth didn't mess with it.  She came out and teased him that he confused her by moving the bill on the table and giggled profusely.  I was thinking, ""What?""  This morning I woke up with what appears to be food poisoning.  God is good to me though and is helping me to feel better quickly."

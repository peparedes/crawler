"event","Every now and then I get to take a look back at where I have been. I'm not the man I was 5 years ago, just as then I was not the man I was 5 years previous. Life continues to provide an endless array of lessons and somehow I manage to survive them and grow a bit more. To those inadvertently left behind, I miss most of you. It would be so much fun to return to California, but I can see that many of those I wish to go back for have moved on as well. Old friends, new friends, and others, what is the best format for maintaining long distance friendships?

This will be a paid commission, terms to be discussed. I need someone who can draw a decent dragon as well as a midevil city with castle. If you have links to some dragons you've done in the past, I would appreciate that.

"event","I know that many of my friends are disappointed by the results of the recent election.  I find it horrible that a group of people have decided to protest mostly against my religion.  As recent events have shown, this isn't just about the rights of gays to marry.  It's about the rights of the extremists to push their liberal agenda on all children attending public schools.  It's about forcing society to embrace what many still do not accept and what a few still do not tolerate.  I need to know from my gay friends an answer to these questions:

1. Are you aware of what is being taught in Massachusetts schools to children as young as kindergarten?

2. Do you think it is right?

This fight for me, is about freedom of religion.  If gay marriage becomes part of the national law, it's only a small step to take action against religions which won't accept or perform gay marriages.  As you can see by the way the protests have gone, LGBT wants the LDS church to start performing gay marriages.  The line has been drawn in the sand, and I cannot stand by while it is eroded. That is why this election was important to me.  That is why I agree with prop 8.  I am proud to be a Latter-day Saint.  Especially at times like this.

"event","Today I worked up a Calendar of Events for my novel.  It's amazing what I will go through to avoid actually writing.  Oh well.  I realized today that I had forgotten to take leap years into account.  In Puji, the first day of the year is defined as the day of the Vernal Equinox.  This means that every 188 years there is a year with one less day.  Had to calculate which years those were so I could calculate my lunar cycles.  Sounds a bit crazy for a fantasy novel, I know, but that's just part of my personality.  :p

"event","When I stop and consider the sum of knowledge of the human race at this point in history, I have to wonder how much of what is believed is based on incorrect assumptions and misinterpretations of observations.  Certainly there are truths which are hidden from the everyday man, but not because it is supposed to be that way.  Instead, the society we live in encourages us to ignore the supernatural and existential in favor of the concrete and mundane.  Reach out with your mind and feel the world around you.  Can you sense more than you can see?  Is there more happening underneath the superficial layer we all live in?  The answer is yes.  There is more than enough power contained in a single moment to change the course of your life, open your mind to a new truth, and/or remember who you really are."

Each day that goes by without an improvement is a day less of hope. I try not to think about the despair. I felt like I needed to reach out to a friend, someone to talk to. I pondered it for awhile and wasn't sure who I could call anymore. Wasn't sure who to reach out to. I'm isolating myself without meaning to. Being cut off from my friends in SoCal doesn't help. Having no professional social circle doesn't help. I have so many needs and feel I have nothing to give right now. The more I think about it, the less I want to try to fix things. There I am, at the bottom of a hole. Does anyone have a ladder?

In case you are wondering what is happening in my life, I am still loving the marriage scene and still feel like a newlywed. Jenn is working full time and work is hot and cold for me. Sometimes I have plenty of work or a large job, and some days I have nothing to do but play solitaire. I know, it's a rough life. Jenn really likes her new VUE. Sometimes I think her favorite feature is the seat warmers.

Happy Thoughts for the past whenever
1. Back to the Gym. I always feel better when I get in at least three days at the gym.
2. Reduced Anxiety
3. Stargate is back on!
4. That crazy Carlos
5. I can afford a new car? Have you seen my credit report?"

"event","Thursday Morning I fly to Charleston, South Carolina. Saturday Night I fly back. In the interim I will be rubbing elbows with the professors and students of a medical school I am hoping to attend. I don't know what is expected of me. I do know they haven't made their final decision and their impression of me will determine if I'm on the top of the list or on the bottom. If all goes well I will leave California in early August, just after my first wedding anniversary. My wife has spent most of her life in California. I've spent most of my life in the Mountain states or the West Coast. Going to the East Coast would be a big change for both of us. If things don't go well, I'll probably look for a job in an area where we can afford to live on one income. 

Intellectually, I'm really looking forward to this trip. Emotionally, I'm totally freaking out. There's so much pressure, and I have difficulty with change. So much has changed recently. I went from no debt to massive debt, I got married, I moved, my parents came for a visit, we got two cats, and I bought a used car for my wife to drive. Now I'm looking at moving 3000 miles away and going back to school. All things considered, it's a wonder I haven't had a melt down. Well, actually, I kind of did before my parents arrived. That was the toughest to handle. Oh well. Ever onward!

If you haven't had the pleasure of watching The Dresden Files on Sci-Fi, it's a show about a Wizard that solves crimes. It's kind of like Medium, but with a Wizard. As for Marshmallow, we let him out to play outside and he didn't come in when it was bed time. So we went looking for him and he had found a path behind some of the apartments in our complex. Neither of us knew it was there, and Marshmallow knew he wasn't supposed to be there. It took us about 15 minutes to catch him once we found him. He is a real trouble maker."

"event","In order to divine one's future, one first must understand the present and determine some possible consequences of one's current situation. It helps when you can hear God's whisperings meant specifically for you. What one must avoid is telling their therapist that God speaks to them directly. Why do we have glimpses of our future? To show us which path to take at key moments. Ever had deja vu? That is remembering that you saw that moment in a flash of the future. Many people do not see these flashes in their conscious mind, but instead they dwell in the unconscious where they direct our actions in an indirect way. It is only when the end is achieved that the conscious mind is made aware that a specific goal has been reached. A specific moment marking your steps on a path has occurred. There are events in life that we cannot easily avoid. There are trials we are meant to have because we agreed before this life they would be best for us. Others come from our own stupidity. I don't know anyone that can easily tell the difference.

"event","<pre wrap="""">Well, after 5 months of trying to rid myself of the depression which has haunted me my whole life, I'm finally back at work. It hasn't been easy getting everything going again. All the work that I had before I left is either done, or being worked on by others. it can take awhile to build up enough work to take up a full week or time. I've only been able to do that once or twice in the six years that I've been working here. I know most people wouldn't complain about having free time at work, but I feel like I'm cheating the company. It just feeds into my anxiety and I worry that they are going to let me go because I don't put enough time into the few tasks they give me. I long to be somewhere that judges people on their throughput instead of on how much time they put into something. One place this is true is college. That's one of the reasons I'm going back. I'm getting my doctorate in Statistics and moving to a company where my talents pay enough to raise a family without worrying about having enough to pay the mortgage. <br />I copied 4.5 GB of music onto my computer today. I had about 3 GB when I left, but they lost all my data when they upgraded my computer to XP. It seems they didn't really think through what happens if someone is on a long vacation or extended leave of absence. They are checking the tape backups, but I'm not going to hold my breath. The other thing missing when I got back was my monitor. Someone swapped it for a 19"" CRT. Well, they forgot to leave the cables, so I couldn't hook it up. I've informed security and I wonder what they will do if they find it on someone's desk. Oh well. Not my concern anymore. Onward and upward.<br /><br />Larikaz</pre>"

"event","<div text=""Atonement Sermon"" class=""ljcut"">I know the atonement is one of the holy mysteries in the Catholic church, but in the LDS church, it is well spelled out. God decreed a law in heaven before the world was that all actions have consequences. One of those consequences is pain. When you sin, the consequence is feeling the horrible feeling of being drawn away from God. It was also decreed that no one person could permanantely take the suffering of another unless that person had done nothing to deserve suffering. Jesus led a perfect life in which he committed no sin and took no actions that would require suffering on His part, except in seeing the choices of others. When Christ went to the Garden of Gethsemane, He was tormented with infinite suffering. He suffered body, mind, and soul. He felt every pain that anyone in the universe could ever feel and He felt it to the most extreme example there was. <br /><br />This act of God allows us to end our suffering from sin or other actions. All we have to do is call upon God, in the name of Christ to end the suffering, and, God willing, Christ takes that suffering from us because He has already felt it for us. For sins, this is acheived through prayer and sometimes through confession to the proper authorities and true repentance. For temporal pains, this can be achieved through prayer and sometimes through the power of the priesthood, requiring faith on the part of the injured or sick.<br /><br />The other half of the atonement began when Christ died on the cross. He was literally the Son of God. He had the power to come down off the cross and live. Nothing in this world could kill Him. But He allowed the Romans and the Jews to cause His body enough suffering that His soul would be able to leave His body. Christ sacrificed immortality among us for a greater goal that He achieved through faith. He and He alone had the power to take His body back after it had been dead. No one in the universe had been able to do that before Him. He could do it because He was the first born of the Father, the Anointed One. For some reason which I do not understand, when Christ's spirit reentered His body, it made it possible for others to be resurrected. And many were that day. Because of Christ's resurrection, it is guaranteed that all men (and women) who receive a body will be resurrected, whether they want to be or not.<br /><br />There is one more aspect of the atonement that is often overlooked, but which is just as vital to God's plan of Salvation. When Christ's body lay in the tomb, His spirit was in the spirit world creating a bridge of sorts between Spirit Prison and Spirit Paradise. Only then, after Christ's visit to the spirit world could the missionary work to the dead begin. Only then could the empowered and baptized go and visit those who died without baptism and begin to teach them. Then, if they accept what they are taught, and someone acts as their proxy on this earth to do the necessary ordinances, they could progress to Spirit Paradise or even Resurrection.<br /><br />If I have left anything out of the wonders of the atonement, please feel free to comment.<br /><br />Larikaz<br /></div>"

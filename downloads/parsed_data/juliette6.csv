"event","I had quite a surprise today.  My upstairs neighbor knocked on my door (I was afraid he might complain about my singing practice, but no, he liked it :)  We spoke a bit (in German).  Turned out, he's been living in Germany for 12 years and comes from Iraq.  So, upon hearing this, I apologized for all that our last president has done.

And he - he said no!  That it is so much better now than with Sadaam before.  He is actually grateful for what Bush has done for Iraq.  He said he is a fan!!  Apparently, before Bush, it was much more difficult to visit Iraq (coming from Germany), and now, he can visit easily, and finds things much improved.  

I was... shocked..."

"event","should NOT be administered intramuscularly!!!!!!!!!!  

Based on the feeling in my left arm triceps muscle which is similar to the soreness when I got a flu shot (which IS intramuscular), the fierce way the nurse jabbed my arm, and the MASSIVE allergy symptoms I am experiencing, it seems most likely that the subcutaneous shot went at least somewhat into my muscle.  And I am SUFFERING.  I guess I am lucky not to be dead with throat swollen shut, but uh yeah.  

So, if you ever get allergy shots and you have semi-muscular arms, make sure the nurses know NOT to JAB them so hard the shot goes into the muscle.   

Although, I wonder if this shot will be like super effective in terms of immunotherapy....  if I survive it, that is."

"event","Romeo's new vet gave me this recipe:  

INGREDIENTS
1.5 lbs ground beef or cut up steak into bite sized pieces
1.5 lbs ground turkey - high fat
1 package chicken livers
1 small yam or sweet potato
0.25 cup couscous, oatmeal or cooked rice

DIRECTIONS
cook and mash the yam.  Simmer chicken livers until slightly firm.  Add 0.25 cup water to couscous/oatmeal and set aside for a few minutes to absorb.  Combine everything, add 4.5 tsp animal essentials as you mix (i'm not sure what ""animal essentials"" are...  i think it's like fresh dead animal bits...) 

Then, you put in ziplock bags, 1 day's worth per bag, freeze, and defrost overnight each day before serving.

Hmmmmmm.  Curious, I wonder if it's cheaper than buying food?  Probably not, unless you get a special butcher deal...  And, how would one make the dry food?  Bake all that stuff up??  And what are ""animal essentials"" anyways?  

But yeah, if you really LOVE your cat, now you can make him/her homemade food!"

"event","my apartment is literally covered in a layer of black dust from leaving the windows open.  why?  massive fires this summer, insufficient rain.  walking down the street, can barely keep eyes open because so many airborne particles.

okay, so california has always had fires.  but, apparently this dust-in-air problem is new.  

of course, throughout history there have been weather disturbances, human reactions to these (oh no, it's the apocalypse etc etc).  

but, in the past 100 years, not only is there concrete evidence of unprecedented change (decrease) in the polar ice, but there have also been changes ""closer to home."" (earthquakes?  hurricanes??  possibly related?  i'm not an expert in these things).   

it seems that these local weather disturbances will continue until it becomes egregiously obvious to even the dumbest fucks that humans have severely impacted the earth's climate.  at that point, will we be clever enough to fix things?  will we end up with some stupid ass kevin costner waterworld (doubtful)?  maybe the us will piss off enough countries to get ourselves in big trouble and war, nukes, etc etc.  or maybe something catastrophic will happen at the olympics next year 2008 in beijing (after being there this summer, the cultural differences are shocking, the language barriers immense, i am concerned...) and the us and china will duke/nuke it out?  i don't know.  but scientifically, human impact on the environment, of which i've been aware since a kid in science class (greenhouse gases, etc etc, made perfect reasonable sense - did we not all learn that stuff like 20 years ago???), is now becoming evident in everyday life.  

i just hope that we're not too fucking dumb to fix things while we still have a pretty decent environment, and that we continue to figure out how to change lifestyles, advance in science and technology, etc etc, so we can keep tigers, tarantulas, turtles and not just end up with a bunch of skin-cancered/fake-tanned dumbasses and their stupid little yippy pink-sweater-wearing mini-dogs.  

oh yeah, and i hope this fucking ash gets the fuck out of the air!  in the meantime, i'm cleaning off this black shit and closing the windows.  whoever thinks rain is a drag, try breathing soot and cleaning it off every surface in your fucking domicile!"

"event","It is amazing how a very small reproach, when properly delivered, is so effective on young people.  All it took was ""I was disappointed in some of you..."" and maybe 2 minutes of a firm but gentle lecture to regain discipline in the classroom on Monday.  It's easy to forget that I can be quite intimidating when I get serious...  

So, the kids have been wonderful all week.  I think I ""cracked"" the arrogant-bully-know-it-all kid, when I proved the Euler Fermat Theorem and showed how it allows one to solve problems like:  Find a prime divisor of 2^55 + 1, a problem which would make most calculators overflow... ha ha...  Oh, and today I did some estimates for an induction proof and busted out my ninja-analysis skillz, and they actually APPLAUDED (!!)  They've done that a few other times this week...  

Since the kids have been so good all week, I am making super spaz kid brownies, a new recipe.  It involves:
- a lot of very dark chocolate powder (all fancy and organic)
- a healthy amount (read large but not sickly sweet) of sugar
- a shot of espresso
- dark chocolate chips mixed-in and sprinkled on top

I haven't perfected the recipe yet, but I think they'll be pretty great....  If anyone wants it, I could send you a rough-idea, but if you know how to make brownies from scratch, it's essentially a standard recipe just tweaked a bit...  TWEAK!!  It will be entertaining to see how hyper the kids are tomorrow morning and hopefully they will keep me up after MEAT tonight.  YAY MEAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

maybe the pepper was a cosmic punishment for totally butchering my RSA lecture today.  i finally fixed it, but the students were so confused by the end, it didn't matter.  it is soooooo awful to fuck up soooooo publicly.  oh yeah, and some random old dude was sitting in the back of the class as i made a total dumbass of myself.  good work.

I was warned I might puff up, get itchy, not be able to breathe and stuff  but...  instead i get completely tired about an hour after the shots and pass out.  After the first shots I thought maybe i just hadn't slept enough the night before, but the same thing happened again after the second set of shots - with several full nights' (8+ hours) sleep preceding, so that can't be it... 

Anybody else ever get allergy shots and have weird reactions?  I hope this means they're doing something and eventually i'll be all insensitized...  maybe it's because they're shooting into two arms each time and my solutions are full of like everything:  dog & cat dander, trees, grasses, weeds, molds, dust.....

So Im thinking maybe I should just smile really big at every student I pass, just in case he/she is a student??  I can't bear the thought of one of them walking by and feeling badly because I don't recognize him/her...  :(  I want all my kids to feel happy and good about themselves!"

POW!!!

With freezing, slippery salty sidewalks, and ICICLES.  Oh my!  They don't look anything like those stupid christmas lights.  

They are EVERYWHERE...  On roofs, railings, fences, trees!  On stop signs, street signs, vinyl hanging signs too!  There's even...  ICICLES ON BICYCLES!!!

Um, that is all."

"event","Yeah, so I've been worried, out clubbing here with the drinking age 18 and nobody carding that I will eventually run across one of my hundred or so students...  

Each week, new students show up to my classes.  Apparently they are all ditching the other sections and attending mine.  It's fun, and my evil competitive side *loves* it.  HA!  MINE MINE MINE!!!  

So today, teaching afternoon section, I see a new student.  OMFG, I am pretty sure it's the same tall, blonde, golden boy that was trying to dance up on me a few weeks ago. Then - I see him in class...  Is he smiling cause he recognizes me or cause I am funny-mathematician??  I don't *think* he recognized me, thank god for the long sleeves that night.  (Falcor).  Is it really him???  I'm telling myself that it wasn't....  What about UCSB when I have like 500 students???  EEK!  

Um, stressful.... To relax, I got a bikini wax.  I suggest getting bikini waxes near strip clubs..."

"event","Anybody know why a hyperbolic surface with finite geometry (convex co compact hyperbolic quotient, infinite volume) should have scattering resonances with imaginary part bounded below by say, 0.  Or at least (1/2 - \delta) where \delta is the limit set of the group??  

Yeah.  Like a month of research, and *finitely* many terms in an **infinite** sum may wreak havoc with all our work. 

POOP!  

I mean, there are only finitely many of these stupid imaginary part < 0 crappos, I should be able to dominate them, right???  Just have to figure out something clever, very clever... And new...

Otherwise, um, life is good/bad.  

Good:  I have been invited to give a talk at MIT and Columbia...  And they're flying me out, putting me up, probably taking me to dinner.  Wheeeeeee! If any of my LDG girls (or other girlie friends) would like to spend an October weekend (19-22) in NYC, holler back.  I got the hotel, yo.  BUT - you all will probably be busy rehearsing...

Bad:  Chronic sinusitis.  Most of the time, my head just feels a little weird here/there.  But, if I catch a virus or my allergies flare up, it gets painful and gross.  There's some mold in the buildings here to which I am waaaaay allergic.  Combine that with a virus, and it's a recipe for trapped thick mucus in the sinuses and enough head pain to make me literally consider blowing it off.  I've been sick all week, with both virus symptoms (normal cold) and hellish sinus symptoms.  Since the infection has stayed viral (no fever) I get to wash the sinuses several times a day:  shooting saline solution up my nose, sucking it back through my throat and spitting out a mixture of solution and funky, thick, colorful, congealed mucus.  Yeah.  And hope that it doesn't *become* a bacterial infection.... 

When the head pain gets really bad, I curl up with some nice math:  lower bound on #resonances on even-dimensional conformally compact asymptotically hyperbolic manifolds is the new research.   

I hope everybody had an excellent time at MEAT/PopRoxx!!!  Pictures pictures, s'il vous plait!"

Another funny thing today - There are these little ice cream looking cones with solid maple at the top.  So I bought one for Andy for $0.65 Canadian because it was so cute, he'd like it.  So he bites into it and...  it's filled with syrup!  It went all over his face and spilled some on the floor.  Tasty though!  He he heeee."

Thursday eve I'll be in SF then heading over to Berkeley, could do something like dinner, but nothing late (no Blackmail :(( cause Friday early I'm the official note-taker for the conference - WOO!

and reading all the research papers (6 or so) from the CRM research group for the past 5 years.  

i like the work - there's just way too much.

my running legs are back now.  and that feels great.  especially with massive hills.  

Going out is fun too - but also sad, because all the awesome fun nice smartie bay area folks i'm gonna miss so much :(  it wasn't my idea to move - but it's part of becoming a math prof.

<b> Flammable </b> The common word meaning ""combustible"" is <em> inflammable. </em>  But some people are thrown off by the <em> in- </em> and think <em> inflammable </em> means ""not combustible.""  For this reason, trucks carrying gasoline or explosives are now marked FLAMMABLE.  Unless you are operating such a truck and hence are concerned with the safety of children and illerates, use <em> inflammable. </em>

my epilator is my new friend.  it's pink and rips out body hair.  woo woo!  it's like waxing, but you don't have to wait for the hair to get long - and i can do it without making a mess and burning myself.  woo!  it does hurt, less than tattoos but has a similar soothing buzzing sound, and if you do it while half asleep after a long night out - hardly feel a thing!  i only use it once a week (or less) - and it's as good as shaving EVERY DAY!!

aaaahhhhrgh.

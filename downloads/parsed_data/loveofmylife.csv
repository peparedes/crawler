"event","ok its late i should be in bed but i wont sit down again for a week so here goes. 
 I think that i find my views different from most people my age because my family has always been really politcail not to mention i have alot of family in the milatary. i feel outta everyone reading this entry i have more to lose if this war gets out of hand. But I know others feel differently so i hold my tounge because their opion matters too but also i dont want a fight because there is no change my mind, and i'm not out to change anyones else. I think the protesting is stupid but in the same they are just practicing there right to free speech. I dont want any inosent people to die but in the same kill sadom husan ( or how ever the hell you spell devil in iraq) I think what we are doing is the right thing our goverment has information that iraq help o-somama-yo-mama with money, too in the long run cause 9 11 so in a way he help do it enough for me bomb his ass. And really the whole weapons excuse is that just an excuse, but if he really has them and we let him seat there and plan how to show the stupid americans for putting our nose in his bussniess last time wont everyone feel stupid. And really if hes doing it for the oil gooo smartest man every, then guess what amaercian gas goes back to $.99 that the lord. Although until it over we wont know what the real reason is. but i just pary for our solders in battle while i seat in the comfort of my room and type when they are out there to make sure i have the right to.
And i think they need to cut the coveage down to just the breaking news and the nightly news...too much is depressing and obseive. 

And to end on a good note Celina called me this morning and asked me to be in her wedding cutest girl every i wanted to cry."

"event","so today saturday, well yesterday i had pretty much made up my mind that serjick had to go, so casey said she would help me because it would be the first time i would have fired some body like ""get outta my store"" so i was afraid i would do something wrong, and i nearlly gave myself another attack because i was afraid i would say something stupid. but it really wasn't that hard i kindda felt bad for him. but  the bad part was i had to work open to close on a saturday, busy day of the week. sucks to be me
anyways onto the drama so wendy and i really good friends right well latley she has been leaving me out on alot of thing and really i can pull 2 right off the top of my head, jovi's brithday at fridays, and the show in la with patricks drummer....hmmm...dont think i wasn't hurt because i wasn't invited. because i was but really i got over it like a big girl. 
Now we have celina one of my best friends who has a child and goes to school. I'm so proud of her because she is the best damn mom and really does what she wants to do she must be in a new play every month. well its no wonder i haven't talked to her in a while i have a full time job, and to boot i'm the boss who has major responsibity at my store, i mean dont get me wrong i have time to play to but really she got a man and doesn't want to come hang out with us young ones who are always looking or fresh meat. But she calls me up last week and tells me that she is getting married and really i'm so excited for her and since then we've been trying to hang out. 
So my words of wisdom, someimes people take things the worng wayand really i dont understand why, i didn't mean to hurt wendys feelings but i was just saying what i felt i hate haveing to watch what i say so that i dont hurt anyone feelings. I didn't leave wendy out because i didn't want her to go i really thought she wouldn't want to go so instead i just didnt bother."

"event","Ok so my head hurts really bad. I swear sometimes people that shop in that mall need to hurt. Rudest lady in tonight, i mean we are closing the store and she trying shoes on her son well decides she needs another pair because these 13 are damaged i told her the shoes were stacked out on the table i believe there were more and i was ringing up he sister at the register and the other girl was on the other side of the store cleaning, i mean the malls closed at this ponit gates are down. Well then the lady gets an atitude and is like "" well i guess your not getting any shoes because i'm not getting them i need some service"" and really i'm ringing some one up. SO when i finish that marina had walked to my side of the store and the women was up getting her stuff so then i turn around and was like "" did you want to see another pair"" and she said "" yes were not getting those they are damaged"" so i turned and marina was by the stack out witch the lady was by and i asked marina for a 13 and really loudly said because there are 4 of them there, so marina gave me one and but it was a display i gave it back to her and said better give me one thats not displayd it might be damaged. short story they bought the cheap sale shoes and left my store with there big'ol family.

Any ways so thats my headache, well funny thing happened today. SO justin and christina concert tickets go on sale sunday at 12 this i have known since monday and celina and i were talking about it on wednsday and she called her dad because he has a friend who knows a ticket broker, well missy and i had alreay decide we would pay a million dollar to have good seats and so celina said that she would get 4 from the him and that we couold pay here when we got the tickets. And celina and i both thought i wonder if wendy would like to go but as far as i know she wasn't realling into spending her life savings to see a member of nsync espeaclly justin because that last couple of time missy and i have done justin thing, she reminds me on how over that part of her life she is, so why do i get attitude when i just try to avoid the leacture on how juvinille i cfan be sometimes because for the reacord i'm not over that part of my life yet so i'm still enjoying the ride. i hope to see 3 or 4 or if i'm lucky more shows in this tour.
 now with that said celinas dad has a new group he is trying to get started they are call level and they have a show at the key club on march the 8th i believe, everyone is welcome to come he said that are more rock. so i'm planning on going i think it'll be fun."

So on to better thing, lets go onto the subject of boys, better yet let just get onto a boy. ( lol...get it) anyways. Jimmy, or jim as he likes to call himself. Hot man, i mean i've always thought this. Well missy and i hung out with him and a friend of his last night wasn't the greatest time of my life but i was nevrous all night all i could think was that he was only talking to me because he thought i was easy and he wanted to get laid...i dont know what would ever put that idea in my head. Really i find no problems with sex, would love to get some, N E way by the end of the night he was drunk, and a little more talkative, but i did learn that he's nothing like my last guy, very drawn back in no hurry, i like that about him. so to the point, i called him today and left a message on his voice mail that i was sorry for being so bored and that next time we should do something when everyone isn't so tied and well can you believe it he called me back. Cutest boy ever. 
 And i'm totally bummed the radiers lost, i mean i'm not the biggest fan but just the thought of cali taking everything, baseball, basket ball abd then foot ball that would have been cool. Oh we moving on...over it. 
 no for everyone that dosen't know my grandpa bought new furniture for my room everyone needs to come and see it ( as soon as i get it all clean) its lovely, althought the green isn't really me i can make it work and i finnally moved my computer into my room because he caught me a bigger desk. happy happy joy joy. although dragging the desk all the way up my stairs was kill i lived. OK nite guys

I know what I'm doing with my life.


Took me long enough.


Plans have the option of going wrong, so I didn't make any specific plans.


I think I finally know what I'm supposed to do, and I'm pretty sure I've never felt better about myself or more confident in my abilities to achieve my goals.



Part of my work to move my life in the direction I have chosen, will involve me staying at Widener for only a year, and then heading overseas for three.  I'll be back on winter break and summer break possibly, it will depend on what I'm working on.


******************************


I did, however, make a plan for the summer (other than working).  It does need to stay sorta secret till all the pieces are in place, but anyone with any interest in acting should watch my Live Journal as I'll have details out soon, hopefully.


Who knows what the summer will bring, but I hope everyone enjoys theirs to its fullest extent.

Now I'm pretty sure I know nothing of consequence...

-----

I used to tell myself how great it would be, when one day, I'd be old enough to leave my family and go live on my own.  Not just on my own, but all alone, until the day I died, at peace by myself, far, far away.

I don't think we can ever truly appreciate what we have, or who we are until we have experienced what it is not to have those things, or not be permitted to be ourselves.

-----

I used to always have a plan, ready to go, with never a doubt in my mind that it would work.  But I'd still have plenty of back-up plans and ideas ready-to-go at a moment's notice.

I don't know what I'm doing anymore... I don't have a plan... and it has me scared to death.

-----

I used to always feel sorry for myself, and feel depressed.  Constant wallowing really takes a toll on one's soul... especially when you find out it was all because of lies you had fed yourself for years.

Bearing the truth of one's life and situations is probably one of the hardest things to do after childhood.

I used to say I was going to lose weight.

Now I am, but its only an act of desperation to live.

-----

I used to know everything...

Now I know nothing...

And I've never been more terrified in my life.
 




I swear this entry wasn't meant to be depressing, and I'm not sad... just truly scared that I can't see what my life ahead of me holds... at all.  Nothing is set for me anymore.  I've finally managed to escape plans others gave me, only to find I have none of my own.  I'll be fine, I just wish I knew when."

"event","I can SING again!  My treatment for the calcium deposits I had is over, and my vocal therapy is down to one session, and I can finally SING like I could before getting my tonsils out.  I have my final follow-up appointment on Friday morning, and can't wait for it to be over (imagine getting a snake-camera shoved up your nose every 2-4 weeks!).  Just for the record, this doesn't mean that I'm making some miraculous return to school, I still have a lot to learn in private lessons, and quite a lot of practicing to do before I can go to any of the auditions I plan on doing.

My ""weight plateau"" has finally begun to see some downhill movement again, due to me being on a schedule of sorts, which helps your body tremendously by the way, whether or not you're trying to lose weight.

I was feeling a bit overburdened with the news of my grandparents, simply because they both sat me down, told me, then asked me to promise I would sing at their funerals.  Its not something you can exactly say no to, nor did I want to.  Then again, its something I would rather live blissfully ignorant of ever happening.

I'm starting construction on a major tent next week when the canvas arrives, so wish me the best of luck with my new center-pole-only design (meaning, it doesn't have perimeter poles, just one(s) to hold up the center- it uses crows-feet-styled guy ropes to support the structure and is a period design).  That means that by the end of this week the complete overhaul of my two main websites should be completed (www.TheJestersHat.com & www.TJDeLuca.com).  I've already posted new information on both, and after the suggestion of Sealie, and several others, I've decided to re-construct the two sites, both aesthetically and navigationally.  So keep an eye out.

I'm finishing the new design for my tent for both Pennsic and the PA Ren Faire, so make sure you watch for an update here or at www.TheJestersHat.com when the design is finished.  All I have to say is, why can't a tent have a tower? Or why can't a tent be multi-leveled?

All in all, its been a very epiphan-ish week, and I'm feeling great!  Hope all is going well for everyone else, and best of luck to those back in school!"

"event","I posted this entry on my myspace blog the other day, and to be honest I don't know why I have a myspace... so I'm re-posting the entry here, three days later.  I no longer have a cold, and am doing pretty well... gotta get back to work now though, not supposed to be doing this here at the shop...



So we're already 5 days into the New Year, and well... its still almost exactly the same to be honest.  Though its my hope that it'll be much different.

I'm working a lot, since there's honestly no point to me going to school right now, given the way my throat's been acting up.  And besides, the school I want to go to won't accept my application for an audition until I'm 21 anyway.  I'm working during the day for my family's drapery business.  I'm building the website, building a new base of decorators on the wholesale end, and trying to expand the business in general.  I've actually managed to do quite a lot since I started in mid-December.

The hat business at the renaissance faire did not do spectacularly.  Though it didn't do poorly either, I just ended up with $4,000 worth of stock at the end of the season, and nowhere to go with it, because of disagreements with my partners.  That seems to be fixed for the spring, and if its not, I'm set on going by myself.  For all of the assholes that have turned it into a huge joke, I still have to August to turn a profit (the one year mark).  I'll be back at the PA Faire this year, and a whole bunch before that that'll be listed on the website www.TheJestersHat.com  I'm also working on a couple of cosplay costumes for people that requested them (I still dislike anime though).  I'm also building two brand new tents, which will look much better than the old ones.

I'm singing at a lot of funerals right now, which is good, both for my pocket and my voice.  It needs the exercise.  Not really a happy job, but it helps pay the bills.

Oh and if you're looking at the websites and thinking they're not at all spectacular... that's because I don't know much about building them.

My voice is improving a lot, which is definately a plus.  Voice lessons are going well, and my teacher thinks I'm on a great track.  Wish piano lessons were going as well, but it probably would help if I started practicing more.

Just seems like I'm moving too fast right now, and that I'm not who I want to be.  I hit a hard spot in my self re-construction (code for my attempt at losing weight).  I think that aerobics and my sad form of diet aren't going to work to get off another 90 lb.  So I think I'm gonna have to start lifting weights, which well... sucks.

Honestly, its 9:45 on a Friday night... I'm sitting on my computer typing to no one... and one would be led to think I live a pathetic life (and its not... entirely) but today was a rough day for my family.  My grandmother has the lovely combination of Raynaud's Phenomenon, Scleroderma, and Pulmonary Hypertension, and the lovely prognosis of at least 5 years.  So hence my wanting to stay in.  However, my mom looks like she wants to talk to me.. so I'm probably gonna go bother Jim when he gets out of work at 10.

New Year's Resolutions:

Get Healthy
Get some work done
Cut down on the Bullshit
Stop being a prick
and Finish something major in my life."

"event","So a lot has happened since my last entry.  PA Ren. Faire has been over for about 2 weeks.  Haven't done any real work for 1.5 weeks.

We packed up our pop-up, tent, tables, and everything else up at the renaissance faire back on like November 2nd.  It was definitely bittersweet.  Sweet because it would mean 2 weeks off after 4 months of almost non-stop work, but bitter because it means I'll miss all the things I had up there.  I made a lot of new friends up at the faire, and I've actually managed to stay in contact with all of them thus far (thanks to the help of a very awesome leather-bound book).  Also, I loved working a the farie, as it is one of my favorite places to be, sad as that my seem to some of you.

This has led me to the decision to continue with the business.  We did really well for our first faire, and so now we'll be traveling down to Florida starting the 3rd week of January to sell hats at 3 renaissance festivals.  After that, we've been invited to go to texas for 2 months, but I doubt we'll be going, as we've also got other shows up around home that we'd like to do.  Then it'll be off to Sterling Forest in NY for another ren faire, then off to near Pittsburg for PENNSIC (www.pennsic.org - its insane) for two weeks, then we'll be back at the pa ren faire again.  We're also starting to build at the pa ren faire, with a decked-area to hold two new tents.  There's a lot going on with that right now, and I'll know more in December.


NEW WEBSITE: www.TheJestersHat.com  its up and running, and near completion!!! With pictures!!!


On another note, everything is going well here at home.  I've got a TON of cleaning done and gone through a lot of my old stuff (to get rid of it, mostly).  I've picked up a few new books as well.  I'm working for UPS as a driver helper through Christmas, and right now I'm looking into leasing a kiosk at the granite run mall to sell stuff at (there's one available right outside Spencer's).  So, hopefully I'll make a bunch of money to pay my parents back, and get some much needed things.  My car is still being sold soon (that's the way it looks right now), and I'm not gonna buy that pick-up truck.  Though Bill, Bob and myself are looking at trailers to take down to Florida.

Oh and another piece of big news: Kyle and I are working on a new comedy act to possibly travel to renaissance faires with.  Its called Brighton & The Queen.  I play Brighton Early (we're open for new character name suggestions... as cheesy as possible), who is a magician, and all around entertainer.  Kyle plays the Self-Proclaimed Queen of France.  Its turning out to be a hilarious bit, and we've already got two (paying) bookings for the spring.  Look for more over the next month, including some videos posted on a site I'm working on.  Oh and also, Kyle's character is dressed in a medieval nursemaid outfit of sorts in a brown robe, with an over-enlarged ass, and white nun's headpiece.  He also carries a sign that he puts on the ground that says ""Welcome to France"" which can be turned around for an upgrade to: ""Welcome to Super France"".  We're working on 3 separate shows right now, the first being: The non-so awesome adventures of Brighton and the Queen the second: The Queen vs. Creation- where Kyle faces off God as he creates the world, and his self-image on earth (a scottsman) and thirdly- yet to be named... but Kyle gets eaten by a Gremlin, so its all good.

Lots going on here, I'm going to be busy, but at least I'm enjoying myself.  Hope everything is going well for everyone.  Hope to see everyone coming back from college soon.

"event","So its 5:30am... and I'm awake.  Why?  I have NO idea.  But I just woke up so I decided to update my livejournal.  Why?  Becasue honestly... why the hell not?

Haven't posted since July 10th... which was oh I dunno... 3 months agoish.  A lot has happened, and most of its been good.

The Jester's Hat (the business name The Dragon Stone, LLC. uses at faires) is doing really well.  We've passed our break even point of $8,000.00 and have actually exceded it by over $2,000.00.  The company has been downsized to just myself, Bill & Bob.  Which is nice I guess, a lot less stressful at least.  We're purchasing a 40 foot bus and remodeling it to be like an RV kinda thing during our 9 weeks off (PA Ren Faire ends next weekend the 28th/29th) before we go to Florida for 6 weeks for pirate festivals.  Also, we're looking into building a building at the PA Ren Faire for next season.  Sketches coming... eventually!

I'm selling my Red Chevy and buying a 1998 GMC Sierra Extended Cab Pickup Truck (its a manual) its white and in really nice shape.  Plus, I'm getting it at a great price, and I'm going to need it to tow down a trailer to florida.

I've kinda let my personal website [www.tjdeluca.com] fall to the side and haven't really updated it, but that's on my list of to-do's after faire (along with a million other things).  However, the company site [www.thedragonstone.net] is being updated regularly.  I also just bought a new Cannon 6 megapixel camera and Bob and I are working on taking photos of all of our hats this week and next.

To those who are concerned about the fact that I'm no longer a student at Temple: I hated Temple.  I'm still taking private lessons weekly and we'll see what I'll be doing come the Spring, but right now my voice is too weak to make any decisions.  Last surgery is still scheduled for December.

Hope all of you still in school are doing well, working hard, and finding some time to relax.  I know this weekend was basically my first time off since a few days after my last entry, so its not any easier doing what I'm doing right now.  Though I am loving it and that's the important thing.  The only regret is that I haven't had time to talk to or hang out with anyone, and that is one thign I am sure will change starting next month!

"event","So I'm really bad at updating...  a lot has been going on recently, 98% of it being awesomely good and the other 2% just being meh.  

I've actually got my website to work, as well as The Dragon Stone's website to work, and there's a lot of stuff on there already, like pictures of hats we'll be selling at the PA Renaissance Faire (our space is already confirmed), and a list of arcade machines we're looking to purchase, as well as other stuff that we'll have in our store when we open in October.  So be sure to check out the sites:

I now have a signed contract with O'Leary's Funeral Home (the one across from Holy Cross Church in Springfield) so now I sing a a couple funerals a week at churches all over the place.  Though many people would think that singing at a funeral is creepy or awkward... it really isn't because you just get a feeling that you're doing something to help the family, and they usually confirm that fact afterwards.  It also helps that it pays at least $150 per funeral and travel expenses are paid.  So definitely a sweet deal there.

Jim and I are already looking to move back out.  We're looking at a 3br house in Port Richmond (part of Philly) later on this week. I'm trying to move out either August 1st or September 1st and this time for a full year at the least.  Of course, should I move out again, a large house-warming party shall be had.

Hope everyone's summer's going great, this is probably the best one I've had yet.

"event","This week was... interesting...


Monday - 

I honestly don't remember anything of importance happening monday... other than getting some of the results from my finals, which were all awesome somehow.


Tuesday- 

Started with an 8am doctor's appt. with my Otolaryngologist, Dr. Spiegel (who was Amy's nose doctor coincidentally), who informed me he was going to take on the task of removing me abnormally large and bothersome tonsils and my adenoids.  This will be on June 1st.  What does this mean?  I will lose approximately 7 months worth of work on my singing technique because of the changes in my throat, and I will lose 2-3 weeks of basic singing and about 6 of full-on singing... this... is not going to be fun.  It means I can only sing with my teacher for the first few weeks and I have to take loads of extra lessons over the summer.

Then, I had my jury... which was... not a pleasurable experience.  However, I was told I improved greatly... meh.

THEEEEEN... I had a sleep study for my Sleep Apnea.  I had like 8 or 9 wires literally glued to my head, and about 8 more on my face and a few other wires on my legs and chest... these were all plugged in and I was told to sleep in a room that somewhat resembled a bland hotel room.  My results were so severe, that my second study was moved up to next tuesday.  The miracle of this though, my apnea is caused mostly because of my enlarged tonsils, but a breathing machine will correct the problem until I've gotten my tonsils out and my weight down.  For those of you who don't know, sleep apnea is where you are unable to get restful sleep because your body stops breathing throughout the night preventing you from entering deep sleep... blah blah blah... its actually kinda really serious, but also easy to treat.


Wednesday- 

I kinda half-slept through wednesday and did a lot of crap at home, but I also hung out with Adri, Amy, Annie, Artty, Dave and Jim and walked to WaWa in Morton... big mistake... ruined a tradition of driving... shame.  Oh, and I also rescued my diploma from the depths of the high school.  It was captured by the evil Ms. Simon because I was ""ungraduated"" when I was dealing with truancy court apparently, however, when I checked with Dr. Kelly (who was the one helping me dig in the guidance dept.'s safe) she said that it was a miscommunication...


Thursday-

I had my last appearance at truancy court... halle-lujah.  The first time I went was almost a year ago, on the day of what should've be my commencement which was cut off due to other circumstances.




Upcoming-

- The Dragon Stone, LLC will be making a public announcement next week, a real one...
- I will have a party to celebrate the return of my Diploma
- I'll find out the results of my jury...
- A few new and a few updated pages will be put up on my site as I finish them up, and as I re-learn how to use Frontpage..."

On another note, I am single after a very short period of time.  However, I'm not upset about that at all for some reason, I'm really not.



Have I ever made a difference?  Ever left enough of a mark to be so much as a brief memory?  Or was I really that un-present the last 6 years of my life?  Its amazing how I still let things from the past, childish and stupid things... still let them get to me.  They hurt.



On the bright side I'm making a lot of money with Pampered Chef so hopefully I'll be able to quit my other job.  I'm also auditioning for a private grant in Philly in April.


I just wish I knew how to leave the past behind me and move on with only what I choose to take with me.  I wish I could say I made a difference in high school and that I helped someone in the past, but I can't say that and that doesn't make me feel to awesome.  Why do I let it still get to me?



On another side note, I found an apartment in Drexel Hill that my parents agreed I can move into, and therefore I signed the lease papers on friday.  I move in between mid-March and April 1st.  Still not happy about not being allowed to live in the city.


Things to do:

Perfect the B to C trill
Finish Transposing ""Der Guten Tag Hop Clop""
Choose an Aria for my next Jury
Actually move-in to my new apartment"

She was born on September 20th, 2005 (my parents anniversary) and she currently weighs approximately 25lb.  The part of her left leg that is shaved is due to her needing an iv last week.  She also has extra toes higher up on her leg which you might be able to see, which are used for climbing.

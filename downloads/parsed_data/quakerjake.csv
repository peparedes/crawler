"event","Man oh man. I have been really dying to do more music recently. I think this new song is pretty good, but I never know what to think about my own music. I'm not one to brag, and believe me when I say I don't think this is bragging at ALL, but everyone always seems to be so impressed when I show them my music. It's funny, really. I often think they're just saying it to be nice, and if someone does dislike it or tears it apart, I accept that as reality.

I guess what is often de-motivating is seeing musicians pour their heart and soul into music that is so flat and stale... horrible, really. I just think to myself, ""wow, I hope I'm not like that"" It seems like regardless of how the majority of the population may feel, every musician has their clicks of die-hard fans. I guess I'm afraid of entering my closet little world of thinking my music is wonderful, or I'm uber-talented or something like that. In a sense I always want to ""keep it real"" and not succumb to that. So where does my Lord and Savior fit in? Well... my spirit tells me I have a gift. Not necessarily a unique gift that sets me apart from the rest of the world, but certainly a gift, and it would be a shame for me to waste it. 

Another discouragement is the plethora of amazing bands that are in existence and have ever existed. It makes any attempt to write music seem so pointless. so why then, play music? I've never considered myself to be really ""artsy"" or even that creative. I'm still figuring out the whole ""outlet"" thing. I can't just sit down and force myself to write a song. It needs to just come... like an urge. That's how I write songs. I play everyday, but never make the time to record anymore. It's just so much work, and I simply don't have the time or the resources. But seeing a band play live KILLS me, because I want to be up there rocking out. I don't want to be famous, I just want to be in a band, playing my music where everything ""clicks,"" and be happy with that. I don't know. I submit to God's will, but it would be nice, to take the stage again... to build the buzz in this scene about me again... to just... PLAY."

"event","Discovering the joy of being saved is GLORIOUS, Tonight I met my office partner. An AWESOME guy, and a Christian in need of a little discipling. WEEEELLLL...(rolls up sleeves) I can see why God put ME here! It's amazing. I didn't get this job because I was ""being a good Christian"" or to enjoy it, God  saw an opportunity for me to do some work for Him, AND bless me. What other God can do that? Each your heart out, Ala! 7 virgins? I'm fine with one, THANK YOU! .... sorry... ok... so this guy needs to be prayed for. His name is Jon, and he's saved, but hasn't been to church in a while. He fought for 8 months with the Marines in this recent war. He saw A LOT of action, being part of the first unit to go into the war. He's a really good guy. I'm getting over a cold again and... CRAP. Go away!!! stupid thoughts sometimes... ok. 

GO BUY AND WATCH THE VISUAL BIBLICAL PRODUCTION, MATTHEW!!! It's amazing. The man who played Jesus prayed and fasted for days, begging God to give him the ability and wisdom to depict Jesus as He was and... wow. The word He kept receiving is ""joy"" sometimes we forget about how joyful being a Christian is. At least that's the kick I'm on"

"event","I don't want to start a debate, (see comments of last entry) but I hold nothing against praying hard, I was merely reffering to the people who try to force God's Spirit to reveal Itself at their own will. God sent His son not soley for our salvation, but so HE could be glorified, and we should be very thankful He has included our salvation in that. Yes we are His lovers, everyone of us, but the story was never about us, or what we're capable of. It was ALWAYS about Him. I am so very thankful for the fact that He included my salvation in His plan. as far as ""missing out"" on something, or overlooking a blessing or gift He is supposed to give me, It's not important to me. He has given me salvation, and I will live out the remainder of my days serving him soley for that reason. I'm not interested in receiving anything more than the salvation He has so graciously offered. If he still chooses to bless me, I know the ONLY reason I receive anything from the Lord isn't because I'm being a ""good Christian,"" but because God saw an opportunity to be glorified by granting me a gift or blessing, and when the purpose has been accomplished according to His plan, He'd do well to take it right from me, lest I become prideful. 

God has given me SALVATION. Salvation is the beach, and anything else is just a single grain of sand. If there is more to ""discover"" about the Christian life, great... but nothing, ABSOLUTELY NOTHING will even come close to comparing to the gift of salvation. www.ttwministries.com to learn more about Salvation. That is a WONDERFUL website."

"event","I've been meaning to update this for a while. I've had wonderful experiences discovering God's grace and PERFECT love once again. Church was wonderful, and I thank God for his presence. So many people try to ""call"" on the spirit of God and fail to realize we don't control the Spirit, God does, so ""praying really hard"" isn't always going to bring His Spirit to you. His Spirit lives in us, but OH how wonderful it is when God allows His Spirit to be so evident! I love learning and growing everyday! But I'm going to go because my spacebar doesn't work very well."

"event","is that a challenge? YES. I really miss my CO friends because they ALWAYS challenged me in my faith. I feel like I'm slipping... I'm sure I'll come around, but my room is so messy, and I don't feel like I have enough of God's love right now. I've asked Him for it. I want people to see me or be around me, and unmistakingly see the love of Christ. I guess this feeling teaches me about His grace, and His forgiveness. 

these verses in Romans 7 have rung so true with me lately:

----------14The law is good, then. The trouble is not with the law but with me, because I am sold into slavery, with sin as my master. 15I don't understand myself at all, for I really want to do what is right, but I don't do it. Instead, I do the very thing I hate. 16I know perfectly well that what I am doing is wrong, and my bad conscience shows that I agree that the law is good. 17But I can't help myself, because it is sin inside me that makes me do these evil things.
    18I know I am rotten through and through so far as my old sinful nature is concerned. No matter which way I turn, I can't make myself do right. I want to, but I can't. 19When I want to do good, I don't. And when I try not to do wrong, I do it anyway. 20But if I am doing what I don't want to do, I am not really the one doing it; the sin within me is doing it.

    21It seems to be a fact of life that when I want to do what is right, I inevitably do what is wrong. 22I love God's law with all my heart. 23But there is another law at work within me that is at war with my mind. This law wins the fight and makes me a slave to the sin that is still within me. 24Oh, what a miserable person I am! Who will free me from this life that is dominated by sin?[c] 25Thank God! The answer is in Jesus Christ our Lord. So you see how it is: In my mind I really want to obey God's law, but because of my sinful nature I am a slave to sin.--------------------


for those of you out there who call themselves Christians, remember, other Christians are depending on you to act accordingly, because they need examples to follow. May God bless the Christians who have understood and accepted God's grace, and have embraced the fruits of the Spirit, and serve as shining lights to struggling Christians everywhere.

I believe that sin your doing in secret is reflecting in your attitude, SO STOP. Don't go into a pity spiral, or make excuses, just accept the fact that God has FORGOTTEN ALL ABOUT IT, and don't do it again. Your fellow Christians are depending on you. I guess sin does keep me humble, but it still hurts to do the very things I KNOW God hates. 

Sorry this is coming out of left field. Sometimes when i get frustrated about Biblical truth, I get a little preachy. More to myself than anyone else. I love you all."

"event","one could say I'm having a killer time, and once again I'm affirmed of something I always knew... I have the sweetest frickin girlfriend on the face of the planet. Sorry if you're single and lonely and have to read about how sweet someone's significant other is, but I just gotta say it. This last week has been incredible. with my family and her family. And the presents she got me... AMAZING. I couldn't possibly ask for anyone more amazing, more fitting, or more beautiful than her, and lucky for me I won't have to :) I know, I know, No one wants to read sappy crap on here, but I just had to say it. How happy I am that God has blessed us so much. If anyone knows us well, they know we've gone through our own set of trials and tribulations, and it hasn't always been sugar plums and gumdrops, but finally, after learning how to align myself with God's will, and taking steps to assure I'm staying close to Him, God has again revealed to me how huge of a blessing I have, and I know it's not going to go away. ever. 

I can't stress the importance of reading God's Word EVERYDAY, praying to God EVERYDAY, and spending quality quiet time with Him EVERYDAY. It's so very essential for any stage in your life. Do it with a plain and simple attitude of getting close to God, and He will bless you! I knew Marie was amazing, I knew she was perfect for me, and I knew I loved her, but she continues to amaze me daily, and everyday she gets more and more beautiful. I always told God, whatever He wants for me, I will follow, regardless of how difficult things may become. And God answered back by saying, ""Ok, you're seeking me above all things? let's see if that's true... I'm going to allow things to get really messed up in your life, and see where you turn..."" So they did. in everything, and it was horrible. To a point where I pretty much lost all hope in everything... except God. I knew what God was telling me to do, and I told Him, regardless of HOW miserable it would make me, I would stay where i am at that point because it's what He desires. 

I was ready, even if I were to be miserable until the day I die, to place my trust and hope in Him... Notice, I didn't place my faith and trust in Him because I ""knew things would get better soon or eventually"" Not to say I didn't have hope it would, but I was ready to suffer until the end of this life under the attacks of the flesh and this crappy world until the day I stepped through the gates of heaven. Well, apparently I passed the test, because now God has just poured His blessings on me. With my new job, and Marie. it's been incredible. Relationships have always been a weakness of mine, and therefore easy for Satan to attack, but God has sent me the PERFECT woman, who loves me so much, and God continues to fortify our relationship. I was explaining to my mom how happy I am with marie, and she smiled and said ""All those wonderful feelings you have, they only get better over time"" I couldn't help but smile. 

It's safe to assume, that major attacks will come in other areas of my life, and because we're human, our relationship will never be perfect, but I feel ready. More ready than I've ever been because of who I have in my corner. I couldn't ask for a more amazing person to be with for the rest of my life, and I couldn't ask for a more amazing God, either.

So if you read this and feel lonely and discouraged, or want to puke because you have to read about how much some dude loves his girlfriend, (If you've gotten this far, good job) Remember to stay close to God, and seek Him in ANYTHING you do. Be willing to sacrifice a need or desire you have in your life for Him, and when you do, don't expect it to get better. TRULY be willing to give it up, not because you think giving it up will get it to you, anyways. He knows your heart. And He WANTS IT. More than anything, I believe God desires His children to be dedicated to Him. Some people can wait years for something they ask for, for some, it may never come. But what I can promise you, is that if you're taking steps to be close to God with no strings attached, you can have confidence that He will take care of you, whether or not He grants you your desires, because you'll soon discover your desires pale in comparison to what God has planned for you if you love Him. As Solomon tells us, this world and all it holds will fade away, so learn to allign yourself with God unconditionally, and you will have peace.

Imagine waiting in a LOOONG line. a few feet up, you see a lemonade stand. you anxiously wait to get to the lemonade stand and finally do. It's hot, so you purchase your lemonade and suck it down. but the line STILL goes on forever, and eventually the refreshment of the lemonade wears off, so you get irritable again. You have no idea WHY you need to wait in this line, and you see it goes on forever. People are starting to get impatient and restless, and you're on of them. You notice the person beside you. He's calmly sitting down and relaxing, shifting forward as the line moves. You look at him and say, ""aren't you anxious about this line? doesn't it drive you crazy you need to stand her for hours and hours???"" ""Nope"" he/she (gotta be PC ;) ) replied, ""because I knew what's at the front of line, and I know it's far greater than any lemonade stand, regardless of how thirsty I am. SO I'm going to enjoy my lemonade, when it comes, but my hope is in what I receive when I finally reach the front, and trust me when I say it's WAAAAAAY better than the greatest, most refreshing lemonade stand, and when you get it, I guarantee you'd be willing to wait in a line in worse conditions a hundred times longer with no lemonade stands to get it."""

Sofox has a new reality show called ""who's your daddy"". There's a young looking blonde girl who spends time with 12 different men. They're all older looking, and the object of the game is for her to find out who her true long lost father is. I guess if you're one of the old dudes, you win money if you convince her your her father when you're not, and she wins money if she finds her true father. WOW. that's all I can say. I can't imagine what sitting in on those meetings must be like. ""what significant emotional event can we exploit this week?"" I can see them play it up to be all emotional, but it's so fake. I get so sick of television programs, because it's so fake. And lately production companies have been on this ""we need to be real"" kick, but it's so far from the truth. I can't really watch TV anymore because it's so sickening sometimes. But I loooooove cartoons. it doesn't get much better, watching a cat light a mouse's tail on fire, then sitting at the end of the table with his mouth wide open, jaw resting on the table. The mouse is running full speed, looking back and blowing out the flames. He doesn't realize it, but he's running STRAIGHT towards the cat's hungry, open jaw. Everyone can see it and we think to ourselves, ""could this be it? Is Jerry finally gonna get eaten?"" We watch, as Jerry runs RIGHT into Tom's mouth, and POOT! right out the end of Tom's tail. Tom sits there, shell shocked, and I sit back in my chair and say to myself, ""It doesn't get much better than this""

I miss those days. Church is tonight, and I can't say I'm real sure what I'm going to talk about, but something came to mind in my nostalgic look at cartoons. Tom and Jerry reminds me a lot of our walk as Christians. Paul tells us in Phillipians to press towards the goal and win the prize. For Jerry, that prize is cheese, and despite the ridiculous persecution he receives from an enemy whose goal isn't just to ""make things difficult,"" but to DESTROY him. The enemy makes things difficult because he wants us to be destroyed. How many times has Jerry been SOOOO close to being destroyed? It reminds me of another verse, 

II Corinthians 4:8,9

""We are hard pressed on every side, but not crushed; perplexed, but not in despair; persecuted, but not abandoned; struck down, but not destroyed.""

It's so true, that Jerry reflects us as Christians, and our enemy, Tom. Sometimes we're made to feel bad for Tom, and you can see how crafty Tom can be, but it's always Jerry's alertness (Mark 13:33) and persistence (I Corinthians 9:24) that encourages us to press on. Jerry knows his enemy is waiting, so he carefully, but confidently wanders out to get his prize. Also notice, how Jerry knows, he needs to seek the prize to get it. Not sit in his hole where he knows he's safe. He'll never get anything that way. Jesus always challenges us to go past our limits and be uncomfortable (Hebrews 13:12-14) So we can't sit in our safe holes and expect to receive anything from the Lord. All those things are neat, but what I love the most about it, is how close Jerry gets, everytime, to being destroyed, but he still pulls out ahead. How many times have you sat and watched those cartoons, and actually thought Jerry was done for. He comes SO close, to the point where everyone loses hope, but he somehoe, even miraculously (like running through Tom and coming out his tail) to survive. It reminds me that regardless of ANY situation we find ourselves in, Jesus will pull us through, regardless of how bleek it seems. The best illustration is found in Luke 8:40-56. Jesus is on his way to heal someone who is VERY sick, and on his way, she dies. So they lose hope, and tell them not to bother Jesus anymnore because she's already dead... but Jesus said ""trust me..."" There is no limit to God, it's never too late. And I just love Jerry's joy and confidence. A lot more could be said about the similarities between Tom and Jerry, but I'd encourage all of you to read the passages I have in here, and next time you watch Tom and Jerry, be encouraged when things get difficult."

"event","I am tired as all get-up. In fact, I don't even know why I'm taking energy to write this. Tonight we had an overnight at my church, and because I'm one of the kiddie leaders, I was ordained with the ""privy"" of attending. We played dodgeball, and the very last game I managed to resprain my knee... not bad, though. Just popped the ligament a little. I can walk now, but it still kinda hurts. Uncle sam will make sure I'm all better. :) We then played this game called underground church. They LOVE this. We had about 30 kids, and we'd turn off all the lights and have em scatter like cock roaches on opposite day... (get it, cause cock roaches scatter when you turn the lights ON... ok... I'll stop.) Then we'd pick someone to be the ""pastor"" the person that starts the church, and the ""sherrif"" is the person who captures any Christian he finds and puts them in jail. If the sherrif captures the pastor, the Sherrif wins. If the pastor manages to get all the Christians into the church, the pastor wins, or, if time runs out, and there are more people in the church than in the jail, the pastor wins, vice versa, the sherrif takes home the grand prize of absolutely nothing... but it's still a prize. it's really intense because you run around, and no one knows where the sherrif is.

The sherrif has a flash light he can use to see, but everything else is pretty much pitch black. We usually have a few kids with some bumps and bruises at the end. About 2am, people were getting sick of playing it after several rounds, and a couple hours, but there was one group that was DYING to play. About 12 kids that whined until the cows come home, so I set it up for them. I was really the only leader attending to them because everyone but Jim and Tami left, and Jim and Tami were tending to the ones who didn't want to play. So i said ok, figuring after a couple more rounds they'd get sick of it... but they didn't. 4 hours later, i finally told them i was WAAAAY too exhausted to do it anymore. and they were NOT happy. I was like, ""cmon, guys it's 6:30am! and they whined and whined. They just couldn't get enough. Even after 6 hours, they didn't want to stop. I was ready to fall over at about three, but I'm glad they had fun. All in all, it was fun times, and a lot of kids had a REALLY good time, so I'm looking forward to seeing them again.

goodnight folks."

"event","I'd hate for you guys to think my life is always candy and gumdrops. I feel like crap right now. I have no reason to feel like crap, even though I can think I have hundreds... I tell myself they're invalid. Really though, I have a job lined up, that gives me FULL benefits RIGHT AWAY, and a $45,000 a year paycheck that's been handed to me. I guess that's what you get for serving your country... sweet. SO what's wrong with me? God's been blessing me up the ying yang these last few days, and still, I feel like crap. I'm going to try not to whine on live journal. I'm writing God a letter and hopefully He'll help me straighten this out because this is becoming far too consistent. BAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH Not today ladies and gents, I won't allow you to peer into my mind. But just for a little treat for anyone who's interested... I need some good 'ol fashioned confidence. but i don't know how to get it. I've been so worried about remaining humble, anything that would even hint at confidence I detest in myself. I'm so friggin concerned about not being prideful, so I make myself feel worthless, and focus on my weaknesses, and dwell on them until I'm miserable. Then I look at other people, and think about how much cooler they probably are than me... and think stupid thoughts. I hope you realize it's all bullcrap. I know it's all bull. I'm not stupid. just... humble. right? so yes, save the on-slaught of comments talking about how sweet I really am. I'm not looking for that. God made me to be Mr. Limelight, I suppose. And it's not an easy battle. I'm trying to wield myself into a person who can just chill out and relax, and not get worked up over situations... even if they appear DREADFUL, which, because I'm a drama queen, they most often do. 

In conclusion, I'll tell you what I know. God is hashing out an AMAZING plan for me with an AMAZINGLY wonderful and beautiful women. He has given me an AMAZING job, and continues to bless me through it, so now... the battle for middle-jake begins... ( a little nerd humor) I have a strong heart for God, and in the last few weeks, God has used me to save a few souls. (Another man committed his life to Christ today after God used me to show him the gospel) and satan is PISSED. He knows my weaknesses, and he's trying to bring me down. I'll tell you what, folks, it hurts... and i don't like it. thanks for reading. I feel much better. man, this thing is dangerous. I see why they're so popular. It's like a big electronic soap opera. I love you all.

by the way, I wasn't listening to music. I just found a song I could put there so people would think I'm cool."

"event","yep, I have a neeeeeeeeew job. and a good one too. Right now, I've been activated as an ""assistant recruiting and retention NCO"" and starting Jan 13th, if all goes well and God willing, I will become an official ""recruiting and retention NCO"" I'll get my own Governement car, my own office, the works. Not to mention a fat paycheck, housing allowance (which means I can buy a house), and medical insurance with NO co-payement, and NO deductible for me and any dependents I have. This will bump back my ability to complete college in a timely manner, HOWEVER, it will put me in a financial position to buy a house and get married, which was why I was going to college in the first place. I STILL plan on completing school, and getting my degree, but it's going to be nice being able to support myself and a significant other when the time permits. This is a HUUUUUGE blessing, and I am so very thankful God has placed this in my lap, because a major area I was lacking in was the finacial stability department, being that right now, I was still depending on my dad to pay for some of school, and was on a track to graduate in 3 years, which is WAAAY too long to wait to get married. Especially if you've known for 2 years exactly who you'll be marrying. I asked God to find a way, where I could do both, and this fell in my lap at just the right time. The next few months will consist of saving, and then, buying a house. 

Recruiting fits right into my personality, too. It's something I'm very good at. I pray God keeps me from acting in a way outside His will, but I feel God will bless me through this because in many ways, He already has. I can't even BEGIN to tell you how thankful I am for this. My experience in the military has not only given me stability, solidifyed who I would marry, and given me new and wonderful experiences in my life, but now it is providing me a way to provide for myself and my future family. God has RICHLY blessed me through it, because now, I can have a HUGE nest egg, AND graduate college with NO DEBT. It will be hard work, I know, but it's something I can be passionate about. It's SUCH a huge blessing, and I look forward to it. It's funny, though. Because anyone who knows me or has seen me knows I'm SOOO ""not military"" I feel like I'm tricking people. hehe. it should be good. I believe in what the military can do for people, and have always been an honest person. I can do this, and I'm excited.

btw... for anyone who's interested, i wrote a new song. you can here it HERE:

www.angelfire.com/indie/highwayeight

it's titled ""new song"" it's not new to some. I had it my last trip to CO.


have a wonderful night, and may God bless all of you"

"event","It's been so long since I updated this bad boy, so I figured I'd start writing in it more. I'm sitting here watching street smarts in my skivies getting ready to attempt to sleep. I've been such an insomniac lately. During the day I could close my eyes and fall asleep walking, but at night there's just no hope. Today I took a final in philosophy. The test was open note AND book, which, you would think, would make it easier, but it wasn't. I found my self scrounging around for every answer up until the last minute. It's amazing how much information is in there once you actually start opening it and reading it. It's ok, though, because I was close to an A, so I'm pretty sure I pulled a B out of it, (thanks God :) ) I don't know when my Mac econ final is, and I have a Speech final soon, which you would think would be easy, but my teacher is kind of a nazi. Nice, but a nazi. I think she's scared of us or something. 

All the christian liberals love my salvation message where I say ""Salvation has NOTHING to do with homosexuality, abortion, or anything else that is dividing this country. Salvation is about admitting you have sin in your life, humbling yourself before God and telling Him you accept the sacrifice of His son, Jesus Christ. Then, trusting in Him to forgive your sins."" I don't want people to think Jesus condones any sin, the point i was trying to make is God hates ALL sin, and it's not up to Christians to condemn certain ones. I get frustrated with churches who pick a sin they know they're far from and condemn it. If we're supposed to be models of Christ, this is the first verse that comes to mind... 

John 3:17
""For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him.""

it couldn't be more clear folks. the only sin that matters when it comes to salvation is the SIN that your convicted of when you accept Jesus Christ as your personal savior. This has been on my mind a lot lately, because I've had a lot of conversations with people who think of Christians as nothing more than cold-hearted republicans who care nothing about the world. What's happening folks is through the influence of Satan, because 50% of the people in this country are democrats, we have half a nation with a predisposition towards anything related to Christianity. People need to make the choice for themselves as to whether or not, once they accept The Lord Jesus Christ to forgive them for the sins they KNOW they have, if abortion is a sin, and I personally believe once they are annointed with the holy spirit, (in other words accept Jesus Christ as their savior) God will convict them about abortion, or they'll find themselves in conflict with they're spirit. Remember folks, it's GOD'S job to change hearts, not ours, and AS Christians we should know better than anyone persecution and condemnation will only push them further away from the beauty of salvation. If you don't think it's possible for a liberal to accept the sacrifice of our Lord for their sins, I'm afraid you're part of the problem.

"event","Hello all. I have some big news... God has been communicating to me something I'm afraid to face because I know some people were depending me, but I need to trust in Him to take care of all that, especially since the people that were counting on me are His children. In case you're wondering, God has called me to move home back to MN. Plain as day, I know God has made it clear to me, and as much as that sucks, because I'm going to miss so many people here in Fort Collins, I need to do what the Lord tells me to do. NO, for those of you wondering Marie and I are NOT breaking up... not even close, in fact one of the reasons I believe God is calling me back now is so I can set stuff up for our future. Marie and I will always be together, but it's going to be tough being away, so please keep us in your prayers. Of course, I have confidence that me moving back is God's will, so I'm not at all worried about anything. 

    To Matt, Jeremy, and Chris, I'm sorry. I know you were depending on me to move in with you guys in August, but God has called me home. I'll do what I can to help you guys find a replacememt, but I have confidence the same Lord that is calling me back is going to provide for you, too. Travis, and the Rock band, it has been AWESOME. Thank you so much for the opportunity to play with you guys. It has been such a blessing to play with you guys, and I'll always keep you guys in my prayers. I have met SO many cool people out here, and it has been SUCH a blessing making such cool friends, so we will always keep in touch!!! There are too many to name, you know who you are :) 

    There are a variety of reasons I believe God is calling me back, but you never know. Number one, school is 3 times more money out here, 2. I can live rent free in MN, 3. I'm still in the National Guard out there, so would need to fly to MN once a month for drill, moving to MN makes more sense for National Guard stuff, 4. My dad has agree to support me, and even possibly buy me a small house I can make payments on to gain some equity, 5. I have 2 cousins that need me right now because of some stuff that's going on between their parents, 6. I haven't spent more than a couple days with my family in more than a year, in fact I haven't been in MN for more than a few days since June of 2003, (I was in Bosnia for 9 months for those of you that don't know) 7. There isn't anything out here for me that's long term, and I'm ready to join a church and serve them whole-heartedly long term. Some may not like that statement, but I don't really feel a part of anything out here, not to say I can't, but this isn't permanent. 8. and this is HUGE, but just recently, I came to grips with the fact that God has given me a talent for music, and if I'm not using that to advance God's kingdom, I'm wasting it. I don't mean to sound like a little kid dreaming of being a rockstar, but I honestly believe God wants me to be in a band. I was most effective when I was playing in a band. I was able to reach people, and non-christians weren't afraid to come up to me after a show and talk to me, and I shared my faith, and reached a lot of people. I don't plan on being huge, or getting signed, but I know God has blessed me wih the ability, and being here in Fort Collins, I don't feel like I'm using it like I could in MN. I have 2 best friends waiting to start a band with me when I get home, and we're going to do all we can to seek God's kingdom, and bring the gospel to a secular world. Because right now, it seems Christian bands either become nothing more than entertainment for other Christians, or their faith becomes taboo to advance their career, and I want to break that.

    There are a few more reasons, and I believe God has a few reasons of His own I don't know yet, but I really am going to miss it out here. If you have any questions and such, email me. I'd appreciate it. I love all you guys, and remember, I'm still here a couple weeks so call me, we'll hang out. :)"

"event","I found this on a Christian Goth site while I was searching for my friend's band's site. I was really moved by it, and wanted to share it with everyone. I don't usually do stuff like this, but this was truly AMAZING...

sorry about the lack of paragraphs and such, if it really bugs you, copy it and make your own ;)  the website i found it is
http://www.christiangoth.com/bluerosesociety.html

enjoy, and tell me what you think!

If God has called you to be really like Jesus He will draw you into a life of crucifixion and humility, 
and put upon you such demands of obedience, that you will not be able to follow other people, or 
measure yourself by other Christians, and in many ways He will seem to let other people do things
which He will not let you do. Other Christians and ministers who seem very religious and useful, may 
push themselves, pull wires, and work schemes to carry out their plans, but you cannot do it, and if 
you attempt it, you will meet with such failure and rebuke from the Lord as to make you sorely penitent.
Others may boast of themselves, of their work, of their successes, of their writings, but the Holy Spirit 
will not allow you to do any such thing, and if you begin it, He will lead you into some deep mortification
that will make you despise yourself and all your good works. Others may be allowed to succeed in making 
money, or may have a legacy left to them, but it is likely God will keep you poor, because He wants you to
have something far better than gold, namely, a helpless dependence upon Him, that He may have the 
privilege of supplying your needs day by day out of an unseen treasury. The Lord may let others be honored 
and put forward, and keep you hidden in obscurity, because He wants to produce some choice fragrant fruit 
for His coming glory, which can only be produced in the shade. He may let others be great, but keep you small. 
He may let others do a work for Him and get the credit for it, but He will make you work and toil on without 
knowing how much you are doing; and then to make your work still more precious He may let others get credit 
for the work which you have done, and thus make YOUR REWARD TEN TIMES GREATER WHEN JESUS 
COMES. The Holy Spirit will put a strict watch over you, with a jealous love, and will rebuke you for little words
and feelings or for wasting your time, which other Christians never feel distressed over. So make up your mind 
that God is an Infinitely Sovereign Being, and has a right to do as He pleases with His own. He may not explain
to you a thousand things which puzzle your reason in His dealings with you, but if you absolutely sell yourself to 
be His love slave, He will wrap you up in Jealous Love, and bestow upon you many blessings which come only 
to those who are in the inner circle. Settle it forever, then that you are to DEAL DIRECTLY WITH THE 
HOLY SPIRIT, and that He is to have the privilege of tying your tongue, or chaining your hand, or closing your
eyes, in ways that He does not seem to use with others. Now, when you are so possessed with the living God 
that you are, in your secret heart, pleased and delighted over this PECULIAR, PERSONAL, PRIVATE, 
JEALOUS GUARDIANSHIP AND MANAGEMENT OF THE HOLY SPIRIT OVER YOUR LIFE, then you will 
have found the vestibule of Heaven."

"event","well, I'm back in here to schpeel a little more. I'm still waiting on Jesus to come back, and I used to want to do stuff before that happened, but now I just don't care. I'm not saying that in a ""life sucks"" sorda way, I'm saying anytime He chooses to come back or take me from this earth, I am ready. God wants asked me if I wanted to go ""home"" meaning heaven, and I said not now because of the people that care about me that would miss me. People act like I'm crazy when I say God talks to me, and they can be really mean about it, too. I'm SOOOO sorry I enjoy a personal relationship with God, and I'm SO sorry I know what it feels like when He's trying to tell me something, and YES, God tells me things that aren't always profound, like ""don't pee on my mountain"" but you know what, I AM NOT CRAZY, I love my relationship with Him, and sometimes it's not always easy to hear Him, and sometimes, when I do, I ignore Him :( But God talks to me very directly, and I don't think I'm special, I just keep my heart open to it. I dunno. perhaps I'm wording things a little different then most people. I refer to my conscience as God or the Holy Spirit a lot because that's what I believe it is, but when God tells me things like ""clean the kitchen"" when I have other obviously important priorities like paying my bills on time to avoid $200 in late fees, and only having 45 minutes to do it, knowing FULL well cleaning the kitchen would take an hour, It goes a little bit beyond conscience. In my life, God is VERY VERY real, and not in a cheesy church ""Sam has cancer, let's pray"" sorda way, but a real, physical, mental, and emotional sorda, ""Hey Dad, I'm confused about this certain life situation, could you help me out"" sorda way. God's gotta be one frustrated entity. He tells me DIRECTLY sometimes things I should be or should not be doing, and like a moron, I do it (or not do it) anyways. Like sometimes, when I'm in the store, He'll tell me to pay for someone's stuff, and like ""Dude, I'm not going to pay for some total stranger's groceries, they're gonna think I'm psycho"" and it turns into this big battle. God just wants to use me to extend His love to someone, and I'm a big wuss about it, and Satan's no help, either. He's always trying to coax me to do stupid crap, and let me be the FIRST person to tell you Satan is a little more dynamic than the ""do what's bad"" sord of image he's embraced. Satan will try to get you to do ANYTHING that will disrupt your spirit. My question would be who's the moron that said that only included sin. NO WAY. Satan can just as easily tempt you to do things that seem good, knowing full well what the outcome would be. One of his favorite tricks is taking something right out of the Bible and throwing it way out of context. He convinces a few bright-eyed theology buffs and WHAM. instant Christian Spin off (J witness, mormon) That, after a while became in-effective, so he goes right for the throat of EVERY person claiming to be Christian, exposes their weaknesses, and destroys the credibility of every Christian in the world, and he's VERY good at it. There was a kid I knew, who was having a bad night, and a young believer walked up to him and handed him a track. he was unresponsive, but the young believer was persistent. The argument became heated until the young believer became furious and insisted my friend was going to hell. He didn't leave, and after 2 hours, my friend called the police. This is a true story, and do you think it was easy for me to witness to this person after that? I did my best, but he was so bitter towards anything even closely resembling Christianity, there wasn't much I could do. Yep, Satan is kicking our asses, but we have one thing going for us, JESUS CHRIST. We're asking a world to believe in a God they know nothing about and have never seen before. You might as well ask someone to worship some random tree in your yard. There's no solid evidence that has been accepted publicly to even closely resemble the existence of the God we worship. Maybe some people will admit there may be A God, but certainly not Jesus Christ, and you know what, I think God prefers it that way because it's one more way He can show us His awesome power. If you REALLY think it's possible for ANYone to believe in Jesus Chrsit without divine intervention, you're sadly mistaken. That is why Jesus said His father ""calls on those who are saved"" and only the ones written in the book of life will be saved. I know my name's in there. is yours? if so, tell me how you know for sure."

"event","I haven't been able to walk for 3 days, and NOW I can barely move my arms. Thank God he has given me the strength to rock out. I have a gym membership at the pulse, and I got 2 free personal trainer sessions. So I met with him, and told him what i wanted. WOW. He floored me to say the least. He kept telling me, ""unless you hit muscle failure, you'll never improve."" Well, I hit it, BIG TIME. now my body feels like jello. I really need it, though because I miss being in shape. Yesterday ruled. Travis, the worship leader at the rock asked me to play bass on Friday, which was a total God send because I've been iching to play music for a LONG time now. It was great, and very spirit filled. I don't have a lot of activities in my life I can truly say are spirit filled with other believing brothers and sisters. I felt like the odd man out, and I'm usually the most outspoken about my faith. It was really good for me to be surrounded by people who have such gigantic amounts of faith. In my own opinion, no amounts of prayer on your own, quiet time, reading the Bible or anything and everything you can think of to do by yourself will be effective unless the people you surround yourself with have the same or more passion for Christ. It's a common pattern in my life. We all will become who we hang out with, and if loving God is something we do ""on our own time"" then it becomes a chore. My love for Jesus Christ is something that needs to be articulated in all aspects of my life ESPECIALLY who I spend time with. Yeah, I hate clicks as much as the next man, but the whole aspect of Christian clicks is a lie Satan likes to tell us to hopefully avoid Christians coming together and hanging out. BAH I'll step off of my soapbox for now, I just really wish more Christians today would make an effort at making sure their best friends shared the same faith, and that they could openly and comfortably talk about it."

"event","who's interested in a profound Jake moment? anyone? anyone? Well, I'm gonna give it to you like it is, so grab an easy chair and put on a pot of coffee... but seriously, I have a little something to say about my relationship with God. Jesus Christ has fought long and hard for the center of my life for some time now, and He so often feels like He is losing. I know He feels that way, because He tells me everytime I push Him away. I have an overwhelming love for my Lord and savior, that I'm scared to talk about it fearing I may push people away, or scare them into thinking I'm like millions of Christians out there that shove things down their throats or refuse to have ""fun"" I can't even begin to explain how much God means to me, and how quickly i would give up all He has given me in a heartbeat if He asked. I have a hard time explaining how and why He means so much to me, much like any other relationship I'm in, I just feel the strong connection, and i can feel His love and His power. God left it up to me to decide when We'd go home while we werein Bosnia, and I told Him early, and we did. Against all odds, against everything else. No one thought it would happen, no one expected it, and it was on the freezing cold night in October God asked me if I wanted to go home early, and i told Him I'd think about it. At first, I was scared, because I KNEW it was God. I KNEW God was asking me, and i knew He was seriously. My initial response was, ""Only if you will it, Father"" Of course i could feel Him shaking His head and saying, ""no, that answer is unnacceptable this time, DO YOU WANT TO GO HOME EARLY."" it was clear. God was asking me to make a decision that effect hundreds, if not thousands of people, and there was no cop-out. I honestly didn't know what to say. The census of course was ""we want home now,"" but I seriously considered verything before telling God my decision. It was a week or so later, after being reminded of it several times by God I made my decision. I saw the hurt in the eyes of the men that were away from thier families. Some had never done it before, and I appreciated my situation, but I couldn't keep them there knowing I had the power to send them home, and strangely, it was my lack of Faith that caused God to give me the power. I was feeling hopeless because of a certain situation that God also remedied later, and God spoke to me scolding my lack of Faith. He reminded me HE HAS THE POWER TO CHANGE ANY ANY ANY SITUATION, so despairing was pointless, SINFUL even, if you will. Fixing my situation wasn't big enough, He decided. He wanted to show me His power at a FAR greater level, so he rested this choice on me. Of course, one could say ""50-50"" but TRUST ME when I tell you there wasn't even a hinkering of a clue saying going home was a possibility. We were the 14th 6 month rotation, and followed the same schedule that had been drawn up 7 years ago, and SFOR units were scheduled as far as 17, so we all gave up on the idea, as did i until God gave me that choice. I said, ""I don't want to stray from your will, but Father, if the decision is mine, let us go home."" 2 weeks past, then about a month went by, and in light of everything, I never went back on what God had told me. as the days went by, I stayed confident and clear WE WERE GOING HOME EARLY based on the ONLY evidence I had, that God had asked me. I told other soldiers about my encounter, and they thought I was nuts. Looking back, i wish i had been more vocal about it. What a wonderful witness it would have been. Well, after a little over a month, The Chief of Staff Richard Meyers said in a press conference that the United States was pulling out of Bosnia. He told the public we would be out of there by April of 2005. This was the first step. A small one, but the first. After that, rumors started to trickle down, and people became convinced, even the higher brass that our stay would be extended for 3 months to finish up the rotation and clean house, and there ws NO talk about us leaving early. It was made VERY clear to us that WE WERE STAYING at last for the duration of our rotation. it was at this time the next SFOR unit had already started training to replace us on schedule in April. A couple more weeks went by, and rumors started circulating, then they shut down Cody Base in Srebinik, and they all moved to Eagle Base to finish up the rotation. No one was going home. Our General, General Nash, a strong man of God, needed to make a decision, and I'm sure He prayed about it. We didn't know this at the time, but his commander was telling him he needed to downsize the task force, and he was going to decide how. Rumors started circulating, and eventually our LT heard about certain possibilities, and informed us we needed to be prepared to pack up and leave at any time. This could have meant anything, because that's all he was told. It could have meant go to eagle and do our missions from there, it could have been move to another base to take over for another unit that was sent home, but things wer starting to happen, and believe it or not, I, of all people became the strongest skeptic. Not only because it was actually happening, but because of the AMAZING power God was displaying VERY directly to me. I knew what was going, and I knew what was happening, but i shook my head in disbelief. Our LT told us the LTC would be getting his orders the tenth of January to squelch all the rumors, but wouldn't reveal to us what was happening. Here's what he was told. ""Camp McGovern was shutting down, we were to to go to Eagle Base and remain there for an undisclosed amount of time the 7th of Febuary."" GREAT. That could only mean one thing according to the census, we were living at Eagle Base until April. no one was excited about that, but I knew what was happening. I knew what God was doing. pretty soon, the flight date leaked out, and every new, no one was certain, but everyone knew we were leaving the 14th of febuary, Almost 2 months earlier than expected. God asked me to make a decision, I made it, and despit the odds, it happened. Even over coming the overWHELMING odds of staying in Bosnia, There were several companies Gen Nash could have picked to go home, but he choose ours. I hope this story really gives you an idea of the AWESOME power God has over every situation, and it's stories like these, that happen time and time again that make it virtually impossible to deny His existence, and someone like this, who promises me anything my heart desires, and even promises me things i couldn't even dream of, just to love Him, how could i say no? how could I deny Him? God lives to love me, and invite me in His family, and He has dominion over EVERYTHING in this world, and sometimes bad things happen that we don't understand, but when times like that do happen, and think back to this story, and am humbled in remembering the time God blessed me IMMENSLEY with showing me a direct example of His power, and it's then i remember, ""If God has the power to do that, who am I to think this is out of His hands, and who am i to decide that something that seems so horrible and inhumane is out of God's hands."" This world can be an ugly, HORRIBLE place filled with disease and anguish, but it's in the horrid place we call Earth we are able to see His glory shine. God hasn't made life cushy for everyone for a reason, and even if we don't understand that reason right now, we need to trust Him and remember if life was so rotten for His only perfect Son, whom he loved more than ANYTHING, who are we to think A God that loves us would rid the world of all it's hurt? In the end, we'll know, and we'll see, and we will get down on our hands and knees and praise him for our pain if we choose to trust Him. THAT I can promise you"

I think I'll study a few hou irs and then run around the neighborhood handing out flyers. I live an exciting life. Marie is in Denver with Shelly, and everyone else I hang out with is either getting married or gone somewhere. That's ok, I'm npt feeling particularly social, and I have a lot to do. My school work isn't going to be as hard as i thought which is good, I just need to figure out how I'm going to make more than $100 a wekk because i really can't survive off of that. --- off the subject, was does Bob Barker get so excited when someone's going to win a new car? I mean, seriously. Ford SUCKS, and that's all they ever have. I'd rather have a coffee table or a dinette set. Man, this guy is dumb, a Ford Focus is NOT $18,000 dollars... oh man, I hope not. WOW. yep, it is. ok, I need to get outta here."

"event","Today I handed out a few invoices for my business. Starting and maintaining a business sucks. It's headache after headache. I tell everyone about what I'm doing, and there all like ""holy crap, dude!!! you're gonna make so much money blah blah blah!!!!"" but it's not that easy. I learned a valuable lesson, though. It really doesn't matter how good of a business idea you have, it's always going to be difficult, because even if you had a good idea that sells itself, I can promise you 100,000 people are already doing it. I got lucky, or blessed as I like to call it, I have no competition, but because I have no competition, businesses are wondering if it's such a good idea. ""well, if he's the only one doing it, then there must be something wrong, blah blah blah..."" NO!!!! there is NOTHING wrong, it will work, you'll see. it's cheaper than direct mail, TRUST ME. If you're wondering what the heck I do, it's here... www.freewebs.com/larimerflyers you can read all about it, and if you know of businesses in the FC area, tell them to look me up. It's amazing the amount of interest this has been producing, but so far no one wants to commit. I think I'm gonna twist things a little, maybe get some people to sign on with me. I just need to stick to my guns, and promote like nobody's business. I guess what's really frustrating is I'm starting to grow up, and therefore need to be ""responsible"" I haven't played video games in almost a month, and it's lame. I love video games, but I don't want to waste any time right now. I get mad if I'm just sitting around doing nothing constructive. There's always SOMETHING I can do. I have my own business to promote, and if I'm not doing that I can go do my regular job, and if I'm not doing that, I can work on my school work, (I'm taking 13 correspondence course credits through the U of M, The time allotted is 9 months, but I need to do it all in 3, which means a minimum of 6 hours a day, everyday, of studying), and if I'm not doing that there is ALWAYS something to clean, and if I'm not doing that I'm hanging out with my Marie or small group friends, and if I'm not doing that I'm studying God's word, and SOOOOO many other ""constructive"" things i could be doing besides being lazy. I miss Bosnia, when I could just sit on my dumb butt and do nothing."

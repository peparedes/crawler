"event","Chicago was wonderful as usual.  A day too short though.  After a day of driving up there, we got to the Burnham the next morning.  My parents usually stay at the Burnham so they know everyone, which is nice.  I love that hotel so much, I had forgotten how sweet it is.  I love the Four Seasons in Chicago alot too, but the Burnham's lobby and resturant are so lovely.  It was built like a hundred years ago to be used as office buildings...Al Capone's dentist had his office there.  So, the hallways look like there right out of an old 1930's detective movie...the lobby is all art deco.  It's right in the Loop so the views from all the rooms are awesome.  The first day my mom and I went over to Michigan Avenue and shopped at H&M...that store just fills me with happiness!  We walked along Michigan, just walking into stores. We went to the Bridal Salon at Saks and picked out dresses.
 When we came back to the hotel, I roamed around Filene's and noticed there was an H&M just around the corner from the Burnham...So of course I went in that one too.  I made a fun discovery that I fit in H&M's kid department...found some neat stuff.

 We went out to eat every night, and the last night went to Shaws with my brother and his roommates-really nice guys. It was like eating with three brothers. Also went to the Art Institute, we're members so we go everytime.  I love that place though...its so big there's always something new to look at.  Also went to the Aquarium, something I had never done. My dad gave us an architectual tour which was cute. I love Chicago...the lake, the wide streets, the beautiful buildings.  It's better than New York. 

My brother is now home which is nice. I work all week then leave for D.C.  I'll be exicted soon.

LOVE YOU MISS YOU"

It was to nice to hear from you, but I am going to be really busy this summer and traveling extensively.  So, a relationship/friendship is  impossible. Good luck in all your future endeavers. 

Let's hope that solves the problem of the annoying guy!  If this boy written about below emailed me and called me, I would never cry again:

I laugh alot louder and more frequently.
I bite my nails, to give me something intriguining and unique to do.
I say really stupid things, only because I can't think.
I apply tons of makeup and spray loads of perfume, just hoping you'll like it.
I try to remember everything you have ever spoken to me.
I wear really high heels and buy short skirts.
And it gets me. Nothing.
But there is always next year."

"event","The play is over and I feel really sad (!!!).  Even though it caused me alot of grief, I put alot of my life into this so its hard to comprehend its over.  I feel like this after any play is finished.  Most of the people you spend almost 2 months with you never see again.  WAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH. sob, sob.  The worst is the rep cuz then all the people go back to NY broke and jobless.  I just can't do that.  I want to be an actress but the temping life just isn't for me.  (temping=transitional jobs, not permanent ie secretarial, nannies).  Eck.  That really, really freaks me out.   I know I will finish high school, I know I will go to college, but then what?????  In the back of my head I dream that during college I will land a job and won't have to finish.  Then, I could just go back to school or finish it in between jobs ala Julia Stiles.

This guy who was in the play, a 19 year old college student, the last 2 days of the show, we started talking backstage and physically flirting (stupid stuff like grabbing each other when the other would walk by).  And then the last two performances Sat., he started sitting by me whenever he wasn't on stage, we hung out during intermission, just talking and finding ways to touch each other (it sounds gross but it isn't i swear!!!).  The last fucking day.  Said I was cute.  Only if I were older.  Struck the set, carried stuff out to his car.  Hugged him goodbye, knew we would never see each other again.

And, big surprise, like always, I feel nasty and gross just talking about it.  WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME?  I had a crush on him, started talking to him, then he starts talking to me, sitting by me when there are plenty of places to sit, holding my hand and I feel gross!!! like i always do when guys start paying attention to me.  I feel happy for awhile but then I'm like gross! get away from me! and I get annoyed by them.  I know if the show had more performances, I would stop talking to him."

My ear started bleeding in rehearsal last night which put me in a silly mood. During notes it was all I could do not to laugh...Caroline Holt and I were cracking up-we're such snobs. Being snobby isn't nice but it's fun....I think I was born a snob..I know I can say really mean things but Im just speaking my mind...people think I'm kidding but no, I'm really not.. For instance, I want to have kids cuz there really cute, but I only want to have them around me when they ARE being cute. When my daughter starts crying-""Rosita! Get your ass in here and get her away from me!"" or ""Rosita, I'm going shopping for the day, take the kid"" ""But Missy Kate, what do I feeda her?"" ""Damn Rosita! Do I have to do everything but give you a green card? There's&nbsp;scallops &nbsp;in the pantry-just give her that for fuck's sake!"" Door slams. Ahh, god Im going to have the best life...Since Im so bored in Desktop publishing I'll tell you about it_</FONT></P>

"event","13 going on 30 is the best movie ever!!!  Its one of those movies that really impacted me..like when you leave the theater you just feel so happy...its one of those movies that makes me want to be a screen actor or so badly...to be able to touch people like that...jennifer garner was soo good, thats what made the movie so sweet....i was bawling the whole time and then felt really embarrased and then realized that everyone with me and everyone in the theater was crying too...and when the good stuff happened everyone in the theater clapped...
Movies that Have produced that ""feeling"":
*King and I
*Gone with the Wind-for a week!
*Moulin Rouge
*Spider Man
Those are all that I can remember but isnt that fucking random? and weird? but seriously i remember at the end of spider man i was like omg im seeing that again tomorrow...
enough talk about movies- 
Friday went to tutoring then to Breckinridge were I met up with Allyson Rachel Lucy Meredith Chad and surpise surprise Elise....i think i need to stop being surprised when she keeps showing up...i guess shes friends with allyson now??? i always start being nice to her and then im like-stop, what are you doing? this is the girl that after homecoming never called you, never talked you, and is a complete loser.....god why am i so nice? but i know that if she was standing by herself in a crowded room, i wouldn't give her the fucking time of day. and that makes me feel better! went to hacienda but then came home bc i had to get up for rehearsal annnd they were going to the river and i didn't want to go.
Saturday rehearsal alllll day and same for tomorrow..."

It made me so happy, all through Bio I had a wonderful time of being a skank.  Its fun to bend over to pick stuff up and lean over the counters knowing that you have shorts on..but noone else knows

I think it would be fun to be a prostitute, if just for a night..but not a sex prostitute, just a bend over and pick stuff up while wearing a skirt prostitute.  I get to get my haircut, which I aDore with a capital D.  Joels is the best place in the world, all the richest people in Arkansas getting their haircut, its too wild. Joel is the greatest, he is now fully recovered from his nose job and it looks awesome.  Amy cuts my hair, or has been for awhile, because I haven't been able to match up my scedule  with Mariannes.  I miss Marianne but Amy is fun. Laura got her hair cut and it looks awesome, but for some weird reason it reminds me of Lauren Harrell! How random is that?  Im gonna have to shake that from my mind because Lauren Harrell used to bug the shitake mushrooms out of me.  It made my day though when MM asked Laura to take her handband off and she just threw it on the ground, it was so awkardly funny.
 Today's Fashion: jeans, red pumps, white tee, mostly purple and red scarf around my waist, redish necklace with two big beads with cats painted on it from my Nanny, bauxite bracelet, dangly mother of pearl earrings  Rating: 7, only because of the scarf

Results of ""The Test""  
How snobby are you?

Your score = 70  
What does your score mean?
You've got a superiority complex! You tend to judge others on a mental list of criteria you've developed over the years, and let me tell you there aren't too many people who make the cut! There's just no subtle way to say this - you are superficial. Perhaps you already know this, and don't really care. If you want to live in your closed little bubble, the only one you're hurting is yourself; but there's a whole world of fascinating people and places that you're missing out on because of your rigid views. If the most important thing to you is someone's outer shell, then you'll never get below the surface to find their real worth. 

       
 No shit I'm snobby!  Eww Id rather stay in my pretty bubble then get underneath someones outer shell! el grosso

I really want to go to the consignment shop in hillcrest...dunno when, i'll cash my paycheck from last week and try and go saturday morning! i seriously considered not doing anything friday just so i could go shopping-sad"

Honorable Mention is good enough for the state level, i didn't expect anything.  Have to go to WHAP study group, not sure where it is.  Before that I need to review my Bio.  When I come home, I need to review my Whap readings and try and do my Pre-Cal.  Then, I've got fuckin rehearsals from 7-9.  I love rehearsals but I just feel so awful.  Science Fair gives me headaches.  Hopefully, it was only because of Science Fair because they were awful.  Life isn't that bad, but I just have that overwhelmed feeling...only because I've been so busy.

*Good news tho...I just recieved a letter saying I won an all expense paid trip to Washingtion D.C!! It was an essay I wrote along time ago for bonus in Mrs. Colburn's class.  It was on U.S peacekeeping for THE NATIONAL SOCIETY of THE COLONIAL DAMES of AMERICA....I got my bonus but on a whimsy let mrs. Colburn enter it. 
I get to go to this...www.workshops.org  I, and the 60 other writers from across the nation (!!!) get to go for free while the other hundred have to pay $900. sissies.  But, its June 19-25...I had already entered it when i signed up for Canada, but Mrs. Rownd said I could get my money back if I won it...so i thought either Canada or Washingtion would be great..but I didn't think I'd actually win!!!!  I'm sad i can't have fun with laura and chris and spencer and see some great plays buuuut congressional seminar in washington?? pretty cool, at least to me 
I promise you, my fiance, that while im there i will get the congressmen to pass a law stating that ""Everyone, homosexuals, heterosexuals, or just plain friends for life, has the right to be joined in holy matrimony.""   I hope there are some cute boys!

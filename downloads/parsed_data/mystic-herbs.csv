Oh I am waiting to hear from LC on transfer rules. Yay Portland. 
Other than that radical information, Life as lived is good. 
Single and happy. Just got my new passport. Will be leaving country this year
on a jet plane

don't know when I will be back again

(of course if I took the time and read the ticket i would)

Still can't decide between Psych or Writing. 

Had dream about someone out of the blue. 
I like the vague game."

Life is good. Actually it is really good. changes are acomin and I am really happy about it. 
I am worried about money and school next year. but i know no matter what happens I will survive. 
I am moving to WSU that much I know.. yay. 
Which means in a year I will be a resident of Washington. Woo. 
I have been having these really weird dreams about someone from my past and I dont get as to why i am dreaming about them. hmm being a witch is confusing.. hahahaha
other than that like i have said life is great. I miss some of my old life but i know this change is good. 
I wish all of you the best."

But truly folks life is good. I quit my job at Michael's Nazi Crafts. I am praying that I will be working at Denny's soon. (yeah 9.15 an hour) 

Living in the Dorms sucks ass but oh well. My room mates are good. I am really good friends with one and the other I have a rocky relationship. 
My hair is hot pink. yeah I am that hott!

I am trying to transfer to WSU still no debate/speech team but it is a better school.

Anyway I have decided that I really don't enjoy were I am at this point in my life not specifically the geography but school and my loss of patience with someone that I love. (a friend nothing more .. oy!) 

I want to change I want to move I want to stir the air around me and push my limits. I want to be thrown into something new. I am watching my favorite movie and I think I want to study abroad in India. I want to go through the private school that My sister works for and move to India for a year and study with monks and The Dalhi Lama. I want to learn about this culture. While I am there I want to travel in the middle east, see Iran, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Tibet, Nepal, Everything. My sister and brother in law have plans to go to europe after she gets her PHD and I think I will meet them and we will go around europe. 

I want this more than anything. I want to be myself before I am anyone's fortune teller, girlfriend, Class mate. I want to have this experience. So badly that it hurts.

 
in the end...I WANNA GET OUT OF THIS FUCKING COUNTRY GAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH"

my roommate is a fucking slob there is shit everywhere and she doesnt clean up after herself
example:
a bowl of pasta was tipped over onto the floor by roommate, roommate looks down and walks away
anne cleans up (stupid anne)
anne leaves bowl and noodles in sink tells roommate to clean
three days later anne cleans up sink and said gross old food
example two:
anne is leaving for three days to visit family
anne overhauls and cleans room (ie sweeps does gross roommates dishes takes out trash cleans out trash bin cleans sink area cleans desk makes bed does laundry cleans bathroom scrubs bathroom dumps bathroom trash.. a three hour process)
annes leave for good weekend in riggins
anne comes home one day later due to problem in planning by older sisters evil nun boss
proudly goes to show sister and brother in law her beautiful clean room
finds roommate sleeping semi nude in her bed.. (anne's bed) finds trash all over room ... finds bra and dirty underware all over room ... FINDS STALE FOOD ALL OVER MY FUCKING ROOM, BED AND BATHROOM! FINDS SHIT (I DONT KNOW WHAT IT WAS) ALL OVER HER DESK, COMPUTER, MIRROR, TV, AND CLEAN TOWELS. 
anne embarassed because sister was disgusted
anne very very angry
roommate calls anne bitch and walks out to bring back friends that dont leave until 2 am.
that leave big mess

I know i should be patient i should be good i should be quiet .. but dudes when you have to go through and wash over have of what you own because she drank too much jack and wired ... things have to be done.. i am writing rules of engagement.. aka how to live with anne without getting your ass kicked. 
oh and no she didnt throw up.. its the jack and wired that is all over my room.. evidentally it makes pretty colors when you spit it out.

if you have ideas of threats that i can carry out if she doesnt follow rules please let me know.. i am thinking of slowly sending everything i brought from home .. back home. starting with the vcr and dvd player followed by my tv, then the microwave, the the rubermade tubes her shit is in.. but what else?

"event","... merry dickens called my mobile at 05.30 a.m. my time this morning ? ( which is midnight 30 EST ) Not that the phone was anywhere near me and not that I'm cross about it, I'm just curious as it came up "" Unknown ID "" on the missed calls, which is pretty damn unusual for my phone. Even if its a number thats not actually already in my phonebook the number will be displayed and I think its a different display if its a self barred number. So I am thinking someone with Skype ( I dont personally know anyone with Skype though, altho I know the lack of caller ID is a constant complaint for users ) or abroad or both. I doubt very much it was a random mistaken UK call.

So uhh...anyone out there want to own up to that one ? I don't mind, only it worries me if some unknown/known even, person was actually trying to get hold of me for some reason."

"event","...despite me enjoying it much more on a second run through than watching it at the cinema ( where I *did* enjoy it but had huge issues with all of the films esp the casting ) having now watched the last of the LOTR trilogy on t'telly again, the last 20-25 mins of Return of the King are the amongst the lamest & most fuckawful in film history. Oh that awful slow music. Oh the horrible incessant soft focus. Oh the limpid looks as the characters swoon and moon and sniffle all over each other. Oh those fucking emo-hobbits - I found myself shouting "" why didn't those stupid eagles leave the annoying little bastards to croak on Mount Doom "". Oh the mawkish saccharine sweet farewell scene at the Havens. Oh the fact that the Shire seems to have turned even more into technicolour Teletubby land by the time Sam gets back there.

Argh argh argh argh.

I will still never forgive them for leaving out Tom Bombadil and Saruman's abuse of the Shire, plus all that fuckery with Arwen running with Frodo to safety from the Riders and all that bollocks with Aragorns sword.

Argh."

Be warned tho my dear, I do use this LJ as my venting ground and you might find yourself exposed to emotional rants about Our Mutual Friend there - who is not above using the odd Dickensian reference himself and I am having to hold myself back from texting him with ""  I will never desert Mr Micawber ! "" :D  Sooo... I hope being privy to all this doesn't make you feel uncomfortable :)"

"event","... which will be followed later by a friends only entry re the weekend :)


I have a colleague at my weekend job, C., who is very nice but more than a touch prim.  I am not allowed to say "" Fuck "" in front of her because it upsets her so much and she has total OCD re cleaning etc. On Saturday, I found something else that seems to upset her a lot, or rather two things. A male colleage who is also a mate of mine asked did I want anything when he went out to the shop. Oh yes please J., said I, could you get me some sanitary towels ? He didnt blink an eyelid at this, said sure, and off he trotted. He returned later very pleased with himself having got a BOGOF deal on said sani towels, so was I :P So then C expressed horror that I could have asked him to get them in the first place ! Both J and I were like, eh ? what ? and J said ""  I'm 40 years old, Ive got a mum, sisters, and had numerous girlfriends, I'm not likely to get freaked out by buying female hygiene products at this time of my life, am I ? ""  

Then all went quiet until I annnounced I was off to the ladies ( which we have to do to make sure other colleagues know to cover the control centre if the alarm computers go off ) followed by ""  I'm going to test drive one of the new sanitary towels you kindly got me, J "" which was greeted by gales of laughter from him, and squeaks and cries of disgusted anguish and wailings and gnashings of teeth from C, who was absolutely horrified that I'd said this and rattled on about it in no uncertain terms.

Now, this would not be so annyoing and I would understand her attitude a bit more, but when J sent round an email a bit later in the day to several colleagues with a joke re mobile phones that included a photo of a phone with a vibrator strapped to it, she thought this was extremely amusing ! So, photographic representations of sex toys, which contravene the work ICT policy and are wholly inappropriate under the circumstances, are acceptable, but not either mentioning menstruation or asking a man to buy sanitary towels ?

FOR THE SAKE OF FUCK !!!! GRRRR."

"event","The last 36 hours or so has been....... long and difficult mostly, for several reasons. I'm not going to go into the ins and outs of it ... too drearily tedious. Just suffice to say, when will I ever learn to protect myself properly ? I don't know if it's just that I get caught up in giving relentlessly so I don't think of myself until its too late, or, in a magic working sense, that I just tend to avoid formal ritual even when necessary ( as like RIGHT NOW ) I'm also half blaming myself as I did do something formal last week, to help someone else out, the first I've done in months - and yes, I forgot to protect myself properly before doing so... duh me. So, I'm probably the idiot that is somehow responsible for the bruised stomach feeling right now :) as well as the assholes shoving their feet at me.

Saying that, today ended on a marvellously upbeat note :) I started off the day feeling like utter crap due to exhaustion, bad stomach, personal and work related stress, and ended it almost back to my usual cheery self. And now to bed, probably to not sleep properly again."

"event","Ye gods, I can't even write out a LJ journal update title without it sounding salacious :P

Ok, new LJ, new me, sort of. After my severe hermit phase of late, ( and Umm no not "" killing the hermit "" :P, well not too much :P  )it's time for a reinvention, I think. For the first time in ages, I feel the need to be slightly more open to people :) whilst still excercising due caution.  So I'll be making a few public entries now ( ooerrr missus as dear weatherwitch would say ). I've been through a bit of a rollercoaster lately... and its been good as well as scary. Every week seems to bring a steep new learning curve, to shake me out of my complacency, challenge me, open my eyes to new things. Maybe its because Im headed for the big Four Oh next year, there seems to be a series of mini awakenings, sheddings of skins, the cyclic itching of new growth. And now finally I'll be able to take my head out of my own arse and pay more attention to you lovely people :)

I have made a list of Things To Do Before I'm Forty. The top of the list.. I'm gonna gloss over that one :P But the rest are a mixture of things like ""  Run out of a restaurant without paying - ON PURPOSE "" ( and not just inadvertently like E and I did last year on the way to Wales, as that was only a Little Chef and didnt really count, and we just FORGOT to pay ) alongside stuff like finally, since my passport is coming up for renewal next March, getting my damn names legally the way I want them, and also re opening, exploring and nourishing my long neglected artistic side. Anyone else got milestone birthdays coming up that they have a Must Do list for ?

Anyway, I'll stfu up now and stop taking up space on your friends' pages :P"

This brought two other instances where Phill has injured other people on accident, including when he smacked Mario right in the nose with his elbow (causing a nosebleed and swelling) and got salt in Juan's eye (causing pain and probably temporary blindness)."

1. I was on the beltline, but everyone was walking. Some people were walking much faster than others. But everyone had their car keys in their hands. Also, the walking area was like a whole other two lanes on the right side of the beltline, with that bouncy soft shredded tire material they used for the track at my high school, and also still use outside Crabtree Valley Mall by Cheesecake Factory and P.F. Chang's.

2. I was trying to catch up with Dave and Jennifer, but it was in a tree-town, where everything was in the trees, and I was having a hard time catching up because I didn't know how to walk on the branches right.

3. But that's okay, because I also ran into Joy telling Amy how sick she was of eating tomato sauce all day long, and also of how she ate a piece of cheese for lunch."

"event","Hi. I'm sure you want to hear all about my life and what's been going on and all that crap. And maybe sometime soon I'll summarise it. But for now, I want to know just what the fuck is wrong with vegans. Does the complete lack of cholesterol in their diet (or apparent overabundance of ""nutritional yeast flakes"") just completely destroy their brain? What the fuck?

Here are some selected quotes from a vegan recipe site that allows commenting on its recipes:

<i>Hey! this is great sauce for when you have a guest over, because after you eat you can smear the leftover sauce all over your lover and yourself! Makes for a great way to lose your virginity while trying a great sauce!</i> (Seriously. What the fuck is wrong with vegans?)

<i>Yum! I had some left over tofu so I decided to give this a try. I only had about 1/2 cup of shitake mushrooms but that worked out fine. I added some spinach when I added the tofu. I also mixed in some baked sweet potato to the finished product. Delicious!</i> (No. No. ... no. Spinach and sweet potato should probably never be mixed.)

<i>Oh my. These are the bestest cookies EVER. I didn't have any flax seeds so I used tofu instead. I also usually don't like my cookies super-sweet so I halved the amount of sugar the recipe called for and they still turned out fabulous.</i> (I - I don't know what strikes me as so inherently wrong about this.)

<i>Wow! I'm still eating my spaghetti and tofu balls and loving this sauce. It has an amazing red-orange color and the spices are just right.</i> (The Flying Spaghetti Monster would be rolling in His Noodly Grave, if He were dead.)

<i>when i do scrambled tofu, i like to put in chopped tomato, finely chopped broccoli florets, and black olives (for this, the canned ones are fine) just add them to the pan after the onion's gone translucent and you've already added the spices</i> (Vegans are notorious for combining poor, innocent plants in Ways That God Never Intended.)

<i>I'm wondering if we made this incorrectly. The pesto was so dry and dirt-like that it was hard to eat. For our two cups of basil, we used the chopped leaves that are found in spice containers.</i> (Hint: before becoming vegan, learn how to cook with plants.)

<i>I guess it's like a vegan fettucini alfredo, but so so so much better.</i> (Which is to say, plain fettucini noodles.)"

As I was leaving, the cashier came running up to my car and said she undercharged me; I thought it'd be the cost of the O<sub>2</sub> sensor, but it was just another $27 due to a small addition problem.

Today, it's the oxygen sensor, timing belt (which is saturated with oil and was the site of my oil leak) and maintenance package, which was the reason many of these things were discovered.

"event","Under no circumstances should you purchase the chocolate known as Choxie.

Under even fewer circumstances should you eat it.

The name is not, as I found, a combination of <b>cho</b>colate and mo<b>xie</b>, which would imply that it is smooth and delicious. It's a combination of <b>cho</b>colate and wa<b>xie</b>, which is an alternate spelling of waxy. Seriously. I've had waxy chocolate before, and it wasn't good. This was like eating a candle, in the centre of which there is half of a Hershey's Kiss leftover from two Christmases ago, and it's Thanksgiving morning.

I'm still saving it, though, on the chance that I want something chocolatey, but not necessarily something that tastes good.

Interestingly! One of the things that makes chocolate so damn good (y'know, besides the flavour) is that it melts in your mouth; chocolate's melting point is just below the temperature of the human mouth. Which is around 98-odd degrees Fahrenheit, unless you're on fire and then it's probably much higher.

Joy's got some really good chocolates. They're Ghiradelli Peppermint Bark or something, and it's milk chocolate squares topped with peppermint-bit-infused white chocolate. They also contain the songs of angels, which you can hear if you listen while the chocolate slowly melts down on your tongue. They are delicious. In fact, I have just had two of them thrown to me.

Slightly more in the past are two other chocolates, made by Lindt Sprungli, that Joy and I bought at World Market the other week. I found an orange-flavoured dark chocolate, which I was going to get just for me (and Joy), and she found a pistachio-flavoured milk chocolate, which she was going to get for her dad. She decided that she had to know if it was really good or not, so she ate it. I also ate some of it, and it wasn't bad. Not at all. I just like dark chocolate better, is all. Less creamy, more chocolate. And when there's orange and orange pieces in the chocolate, hoo doggie.

Also at World Market, we bought two big chunks of dark chocolate for use in making hot chocolate (dark chocolate + slowly heated half-and-half = tasty!). Now, I hadn't realised it was quite so difficult to actually grate dark chocolate. But it's stupid hard. By the time the milk had heated up, I had expected to have had enough chocolate grated to build a bridge to the moon. This was not the case. I didn't have enough chocolate grated to make a mess on the kitchen floor.

So I grated more chocolate, Joy grated more chocolate, and to save us both even more trouble grating chocolate, I used the dark chocolate chips that we bought to make hot chocolate with the first time. And it was delicious."

Let's see ... Thanksgiving with Joy's family was nice. Her dad made for me some sort of portabello mushrooms and tofu marinated in something delicious, also the stuffing was made with vegetable broth. Garlic mashed potatoes are wonderful things.

We played Scrabble, drank espresso, watched <a href=""http://video.google.com"">Google Videos</a> and generally had a good time. Whee!

I wish I had more to say. I'll think a little bit.

Okay! My family is planning an engagement party for Joy and me, possibly in late February or early March. It should be interesting and fun. I'm told that engagement parties don't really result in the giving of gifts. Knowing my family, this one will. Might. It might. It might result in the giving of gifts. Possibly, but not probably.

See? Paragraphs like the last one are why I don't write more often. When I learn to make sense at least half the time, I'll write more.

P.S. Tomato sammiches are tasty."

"event","Well, since Target doesn't offer much of anything useful in plexiglass, I've been assembling a badass stainless steel Christmas wishlist at target.com for myself and Joysephine, as my family requested (/me being the only family member who actually lives away from everyone else).

The problem is that half the stuff we saw in-store wasn't actually there. In fact, according to the website, Target doesn't actually sell anything of Chefmate's except for one big set of cookware, which includes nothing of what I wanted (copper-base stainless steel 12-inch skillet, 10-inch skillet, 3-qt saucepan, etc.)."

"event","First and foremost: Joy and I are officially an item - an inanimate object incapable of acting on the surrounding world except by reacting.

... that's not it. That's not it at all. Joy and I are officially an item - and by ""an item"", I mean ""engaged"". She's done not much beyond stare at her ring since she got it. I think there's a little hypno-disk or something inside that keeps her attention right there.

Also, I'm mostly moved out of the house where I was living. It's a long story, and I'll tell it one day. I just want to type it out once, and then copy-paste it to everywhere else I intend on telling about it. If you want, you can read about it at Joy's blog, which should be easy to find if you don't mind clicking on links.

Um ... that's about it. I'll try to update again in less than a month."

I spilled coffee on my keyboard the other night. There was like 1/4 inch of coffee left in it. I knew I should have finished it that morning. Anyway, no ill effects yet, except that the left arrow, down arrow and right arrow keys stick.

I cleared my room of cobwebs today, as we moved the lamp over to my desk so that we could put the television and toiletries plastic drawers on top of a little two-tiered shelving unit. Anyway, it (the lamp) illuminated a lot of cobwebs. Stick in hand (once I got one from the yard), I removed them. Bleh.

And hey, Mozilla just crashed 'cause of some DHTML, but Deepest Sender saved what I had typed so far. Sweet.

Um ... well, I guess I really haven't that much to post after all."

A Nerd is someone who is passionate about learning/being smart/academia.<br />
A Geek is someone who is passionate about some particular area or subject, often an obscure or difficult one.<br />
A Dork is someone who has difficulty with common social expectations/interactions.

You scored better than half in Nerd, earning you the title of: <b>Pure Nerd</b>.
<br />
The times, they are a-changing. It used to be that being exceptionally
smart led to being unpopular, which would ultimately lead to picking up
all of the traits and tendences associated with the ""dork."" No-longer.
Being smart isn't as socially crippling as it once was, and even more
so as you get older: eventually being a Pure Nerd will likely be
replaced with the following label: Purely Successful.
<br />
Congratulations!

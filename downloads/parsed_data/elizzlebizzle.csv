"event","Hi. I'm really bored. I just wrote my note to Kayla. Isn't it sad that that's the only way we can talk to eachother anymore. Last semester we had lunch and 2nd hour together. This semester we have NOTHING together!!! :( so we write notes and stick it into eachothers locker since we are right next to eachother. Today is a day four and that means i don't get to see the cute little preschoolers today! i remember when i use to DREAD going to that class. But I am just in love with them. They are so fun and Hey its what i want to do when i am older. 
 i applyed to some colleges last nite and FINALLY got the college essay i wanted. After like seriously 10 drafts then my mom checked it and made a few changes. Now all I need is my lit teacher to proofread it. Which she will do in 5th hour. I am just ready to move on from all this. 
i am going out to lunch with tania today. i havent hung out with her since like JULY of last YEAR. i know! she text me this morning in first hour and was like hey you wanna go to lunch. i was like duh! haha yeah im typing random unimportant shit but im bored and need to just.. talk.
amallia is coming in soon! i am so excited! she is moving back this summer and i cant wait. i know dion is happy too. i think its the cutest thing that they have been like on and off for 6 years. 
yeah the sweetheart dance was lame. i left early and went to a movie with cameron and dion. we saw the messengers.. it was good.. we all jumped a couple times.. no, nothing has happened between me and cameron. and its driving me insane! but im being patient. when amallia comes in is when everything will come out cuz she is gon na talk to him since she is like his friend from elementary school and he can tell her stuff. he is the type of guy that doesnt show that he likes you and stuff and it drives me crazy. anyways ima get off. LOTS OF STUFF."

"event","Ok. Well let's just say there is this guy named cameron and i really liked him and november he told me that he liked me too. Well... its almost February and we still arent together which i dont mind.. he doesnt wanna be in a relationship becuase its his senior year and blah blah blah. what sux is that i havent gotten over it and i still like him and i think he still likes me? oh well and yeah so me and amallia decided that until she comes in which is Feb 16th i am just not gonna try anymore. like dont go and TRY and see him before school at his locker and dont Try and make plans and dont try and see him at lunch and stuff.. so i havent for like 3 days.. i havent seen or called him... and i think he is noticing but idk probably not... he just agrivates me.

other news....  you will be glad to no that even tho sometimes i completely just hate my body i am getting better with accepting it!! i know. its so weird but lately ive come to realize that even tho im exercising and i still gotta love my body and ive been dressing better and looking better and i feel SO much better about myself. yes the lil lizzie is growing up haha i got all girly now.. i mean i wear jewelry and make up and no sweats anymore or baggy shirts.. its an amazing feeling. i know i still struggle but im better than last year.... im so freaking girly and i use to hate people like that! 

i quit my job yesterday! yes i did. they didnt treat me rite and never gave me hours. so im back to being a bumb.. but hey.

i went to the hinder concert.. black stoned cherry and finger 11 opened for them.. IT WAS FUCKING AMAZING. i went with Tj. it was so much fun i am in LOVE with HInder.! haha

I am applying for colleges.. i have been so lazy about that and now im pissed i just didnt do it earlier.. im staying in STL.. i got a day care job already waiting for me the day i turn 18. which is great cuz i wanna open up a day care and this would be a great opportunity... i am so scared to graduate and leave the security of highschool and be like a grown up! i loved highschool and i am loving my senior year... i just hope that i can handle the ""real world"".

Well I'm in school and the bell is about to ring.. update later?

phew did it feel good to get it all out!"

"event","Do you wanna no how hard it is for me? Well dance.. its hard.. my toe nail.. on the big toe of my right foot has now came off!!! well its still hanging and i cant tear it off or ill infect it.. but the other big toe has a bruise on it too.. i have four blisters and my feet are killing me. i am now officially experiencing the life of dance. dance is becoming overwhelming.. even though it keeps me busy lately ive just been stressed by it. i dont do my homework in school cause honestly.. im too god damn tired when i get home and i just shower and go to bed.. and usually im too tired to shower til its morning then i have to wake up earlier to shower.. next year may be easier for me since none of us will be going back.. but im still confused ont hat.. cuz honestly.. i dun believe anyone when they say they wont be coming back.. cause dont we say that every year?  i think so. the only person relaly is emily and thats cuz she is going to college alllll the way out in minnesota so yeah.. we all know that deep down we are all gonna come back no matter what we say.. even tho we cry and yell and fucking hate that place we all end up coming back.... and we mite be strong about our decision now but mrs norma will call and i bet all of us will end up coming back!! which kinda makes me mad cuz i no i dun wanna go bak but i always end up going back. so maybe ill be stronger this year.. and also think of my feet and how im sooooooooooooooooooooooooooo stressed out.. school is ending soon and im excited but also upset cuz highschool is almost over. the seniors leave today and that means that us Juniors are moving up. its gonna be stressful these next week and a half... ima miss my friends... but then summer is gonna be awesome! well im in school and i ought to get going..

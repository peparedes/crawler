THIS JOURNAL IS FRIENDS ONLY.<br>I like to meet interesting people with something to say.  Even if you have different interests than me, I am willing to give it a try.  Introduce yourself.  Tell me your thoughts.  It's nice to meet you. &hearts;"

"event","<p align=justify>I know this is super annoying, but I have a new LJ due to the fact that soon, I will no longer be a MISS darcie.  Also, I feel like this journal represents the old me I'm not proud of.  I've grown up, and it's a new year, and I feel like a new person. So if you would like to be added, leave a comment at <lj user=vibrant_skies>.  I don't want to bother you at yours."

But, I love the first snow. It has a magic of its own. The first time it sticks, settles down like a carpet of silence. 
It has a way of turning even the oldest human beings into little kids again. 
There is that frosty anticipation, 
the promise of Christmas and bright packages, 
sparkling lights
and pine scenting everything,
Sipping hot chocolate
and the comforting warmth of loved ones
that only comes with frozen noses 
and the sudden opacity of breath...


It becomes a cocoon of sorts,
settling in against a blanket of white
wrapping ourselves away in warmth and love
like those chintzy packages under the tree.
We wait,
To be unwrapped by the spring
revealing something new,
something resplendent and fresh.
For now begins the time of reflection,
of inner learning 
of outward loving
soft nesting 
and warm hearts.


The first snow,
The first dusting 
of a magical land.
Be warm my friends,
Be loved!


MWA!!!!

Crisp reminiscence 
Of pumpkins and cool, scented air
Of turtlenecks
and newly knitted scarves
tokens of time and tenderness
and impending frosts


Jeweled crush 
And rivulets of nectar
A Potion of season and time,
Aged apothecary
Mottled jugs
with rustic seals
Nature, natural
Permeates everything
Emblazoned to take notice 
Of her
In her jeweled gown


Ruby lips and fire burned halo
sweeping out of the party
To dress for the next


The rush
Of Earth and Fire
Is done,
Over and gone..."

"event","Amber hues drip
In soft terminal falls
As the world slides into hush
the reality of color
the brilliance of fate
succumbing to the cold ambivalence 
of white


I would wish 
to be like them,
to fill the world 
with radiance before I die
to leave in a spark and crackle
of fire
before the cold takes me


where has all time 
run out to?
what binds us 
is falling to our feet in papery waves
the sweet smell of earth, birth and decay
playing games with our noses
taking in air we hate to love
the overabundant freshness
is anticipatory,
but ignored
  

The great crush 
of season on the Earth
begets death
then life
then death again
forever frozen in cycle
forever crystallizing life


I am happy world!
how long before I have to deny that?
I'd rather not know.
I'd rather be like the seasons,
loving like fire and color
then drifting softly 
into the quiet release 
of white
a blanket 
of nothing


I dance in amber hues
I dance in sun
in earth 
in fire


I live in Autumn
I love in fall
I live forever
I will never feel the frost..."

"event","Well.... I figured it was time to update this thing again. I guess the last time I posted was somewhere around 26 weeks ago!! Oops! I don't know. I guess I just don't have much to say on here anymore. Not many people read this thing, but I've always said that I write it for myself. I do. I always have. I guess that I haven't had the need to write in here for a while. I must say I miss it, though. Just the act of fitting words together, forming a thought with letters and imagination, is very freeing. For the most part I write with pen and paper, but I have always appreciated this journal as a nice change of medium. Sometimes the paper rips and the ink runs dry and the clacking of fingertips on a keyboard becomes very inspirational. Perhaps I will attempt a poetic thought or 2 in here before I am finished.

Much has happened in my life since my last posting. It's weird to have a definitive time passage to apply. All of this has happened in only 26 weeks. I feel more together and yet still very unsure. I feel more grounded, more like a part of this world, but my relationship with everything outside of reality is even more invigorating. I have learned some things about myself that I am very proud of. I have made amazing new friends and one very special one. He makes me scared as hell of what is to come... and I think he gives me the strength to overcome that too. We'll see if he or my insecurities win out. 

I just finished a show. It taught me a lot. It gave me even more. ^_~ I didn't realize how much I truly missed acting until I began again. It's like reconnecting with an old friend. I think actors are truly lucky people. More than most, they really understand the illusion that is reality. They are given the talent, the gift, to see past reality, to shape it to what they want to see, what they want others to see. They shape themselves, mold themselves into whomever they want to be. Reality doesn't control them, they control reality. They see that sometimes it is healthier to live outside the word, to let your soul breathe and change paces. It is a slippery precipice to be on, but the view is priceless. It can make you mad, but it can also make you immortal! I think I hope to be like that someday. I'm not saying I want that for a career. The word 'career' sometimes has a nasty way of ruining the greatest fun in a person's life. However, I don't think I will ever stop acting and would very much love to take it to another level. Maybe even become comfortable with calling myself an actress. (Oh and I'm working on the singing stage-fright too. It's about time. I want to share my voice and I want to conquer this fear.)

My life is plugging along. Slowly, but surely. The words are always there. For good or for bad. 

And, hey! I have a Brewers hat now! Woot! 




(Excerpt from ""The Damsel and the Detective""... maybe... that may change.) 

She dabbed impassively 
At the rubies on her lips,
Letting her gown
Wrinkle in the chair.
She sighed,
Grabbing whispers from the smokey air
And fixed a perfect strand of hair.
Perceptions touched her lightly 
Giving her a crystal grace
And when she moved,
Her presence framed the totality of the room...


Hopefully more updates on the way! Watch ""Torchwood"" if you can find it! It's a phenomenal show! (BBC Three)   

Love always,
The Dreamer"

I bid on this item. Yay! Britty bids! Then I waited for the appointed time when the auction would end. Literally 3 seconds before the auction was up someone outbid me!! I was so pissed!  That slimey little bastard was just WAITING for the time to tick down so that he could outbid me! He KNEW that I wouldn't have time to enter a higher bid!!! GRRRRR!!! The nerve! He thinks he so great because he's an experienced eBay thief, errr... bidder...  I know I shouldn't take it personally, but that seems so SNEAKY!! I'm still a little pissed! That just really burns my biscuits!! Ya know?!?! I was very disillusioned with the whole thing, but then I read about that auto-bidding thing! It's GREAT! HA!! Take that you sneaky RATS!!

fredonia: a graduation and a magical (all be it, interesting) night

home: this is the hardest part. words cannot express how much i miss the ones who are so far away from me! i feel like i am grasping, slipping, failing. i'm somewhere i hate. i'm suffocated and i feel like i can't get out... of my job, of my life, of my current path. i miss where i was and i can never go back there.... it's terrifying...

so... i come back here after all this time and post an utterly depressing entry! great! *sigh* lol! anyway, i hope to fill in more. perhaps, only for myself. maybe i won't come back and write more. i find i have so little time anymore. regardless, i felt this necessary for my own sanity. i am not gone. i have not abandoned everything. although, there are times that i feel i have been abandoned, by life itself. i feel as though everything i ever held as an undeniable truth has been proven false. i'm trying to rebuild what i know. i miss so many things, so many people. i feel so misunderstood, so foreign in my world right now. i need to get back to me. i haven't been myself since i left fredonia, my home. where have i gone?

"event","today is a fantastic day in all respects! yes, i am still freaking out about 20 different things, but today, none of that matters. I have a ton of drive and much more optimism than i started the week with. i'm taking everything in stride. i'm focusing on the good things, and when you do that, more good things happen! sure, i have a lot to do (i'm sitting in the computer lab right now getting 2 papers done so i can start on the third... all 3 being due tomorrow), but there is a time for everything right? i know i'll get it done, even if i have to stay up all night! i'm ok with that, then i get to relax and enjoy the company of important people that i am going to miss terribly! this morning, it was nice waking up to kind words. Those little, unexpected kindnesses are always the best. someone complimented me on my shirt today. i feel accomplished because i was proud of the presentation i gave. i had a wonderful talk about life with someone that i respect and trust to be a wise and experienced person. i appreciated that talk, i made me feel more secure and more in control over my own life. we are all connected in ways that may be difficult to comprehend at first. people that touch our lives and leave are never truly gone, because we always take a part of them with us wherever we go, whatever we do. the same is true for them. we are two parts. one half of us is always growing, being shaped, being improved and reinvented by the people and the world around us. the other half already knows everything there is to know and everytime we learn something new or express what we know we tap into that part of ourselves. it is almost like lighting up buttons on a console. we light another light each time we learn something new. Herodotus once said, ""call no man happy until he is dead."" This is by no means a depressing statement. all he is saying is that, we cannot truly measure the worth and weight of our lives until our lives are over! all we can do is to try to fill our lives with as many experiences as possible so that when we are taken from this earth we can say that we have had a satisfying life, a happy life. well now that i have ranted for far too long, i think i better end this and get back to work so that i can get enough done where i won't feel bad if i go out for a bit tonight.  

OOO! and it is beautiful out and my legs are soooo smoooooth cuz i just shaved them last night! lol! ^_~

<LJ-cut text=""Adventures in Aleve Land!"">(Ok, I just took a muscle relaxant (Aleve) a little while ago for *WARNING GIRLY STUFF* cramps and I'm not really used to then... so.... well, it hit me and i can't really feel anything from my waste down! My legs are spaghetti! and... I'm feeling very... good... I think... or numb... yes? I don't know... I can't really feel the tips of my fingers.... I know this is doing its job and all (very well), but I'm starting to wonder if I would prefer the pain to... not feeling anything at all. I am... very relaxed... I don't think I like this. I'm not a big drug person. I take tylenol and only if I have to, but it rarely works on those really bad cramps. so i thought i would try a muscle relaxant... i hope it wears off soon.... i am such a loser...) </LJ-cut>"

"event","Sometimes I wonder, why? Why me? Of all the little ticks I could have, OCD, ADD, I get the most annoying one in the world! I get the damn Guilt Complex with a side of sarcasm!

I mean, why couldn't I get a good quirk like... my right arm goes limp whenever a bell rings or... the inability to say the word ""thesaurus""? oh wait... anyway... this damn Guilt Complex has plagued me more than you know! I stepped on a bee in the grass once, it was an accident and anyway, it probably would have stung the kids in my camp, but afterward I literally wanted to cry, I felt so bad! I couldn't help thinking, 'that bee had a family!!' LOL! I know it's crazy, but I am not kidding! 

Ok, this is something that just makes it exponentially worse! Those of you who know me know that I am a VERY sarcastic person! It's how I live my life! I invite people to make fun of me all they want and I do the same to them. Nobody means any of it. I figure, if you can't take a joke then you are a very sad person and I feel sorry for you because life will be so much harder for you. Also, you are not a person that I would EVER get along with! I would probably piss you off SO much and vice versa! Anyway, the point of this is that I make fun of people that I love all the time (and vice versa). And because of the nature of these actions, someone is bound to hurt someone else's feelings once in a great while! It happens, whatever, both parties know it was not meant and you get over it! It's hard to hurt my feelings. However, if I hurt someone else's feelings, I will literally feel bad for weeks!! TERRRIBLE! I feel like I just killed my best friend's puppy and wrecked her moped in the process (i was borrowing it because there was a sale on kiwi fruit down at the local market and they make great hats if you peel them juuust right so.... uh...).

ANyway, it is a terrible curse. It gets worse when I PMS (no joke, then I'll actually CRY, people!) and I hate feeling so guilty for such stupid stuff! *sigh* What a freaking enigma!? I'll make fun of you mercilessly, but, wonder of wonders, if i should hurt your feelings, I'll feel like the WORST person in the world!!

DISCLAIMER!! no one gets to use this against me! I'll know if you're lying to me.... but then if you really aren't lying and i played it off like you were, then i'll feel even worse and then.... bloody nora... 



OK! On a completely different, and much more fun note, here is a site that I think everyone can benefit from and enjoy!! Every needed to get off the phone with someone, but lacked an excuse?? Well don't you fret kiddies! Now you will never be with out... and OUT! Here are some great lines for you to use when you're on the phone with telemarketers, your boss or just a really annoying person! Never again will you be caught without something to say! Well folks, gotta go!! The baby's crying!! ^_~ ENJOY!!

<LJ-cut text=""Cut For Angry Freshmen Rant!""> HOOOKAY! Seriously! Perhaps I just never noticed it, I can admit to that, but I really do not believe that we were EVER that bad when we were freshmen!! I know I was never that rude!! And if there was an amount of rudeness, it was minimal at best! I mean, I was in my Bio 101 class today (let me just say that it truly SUCKS to be one of the only seniors in a LECTURE HALL FULL OF FRESHMEN!! They were smart to get this out of the way! I was an idiot, I'm doing it now, and I have to deal with them!). let's just say, you kids have some BALLS to talk OVER your professor! no one wants to hear about your experiences at the tanning bed downtown, least of all our professor! suck it up for one hour and take the damn notes!! ok, now, 20 MINUTES BEFORE the end of class, the same little freshmen (DISCLAIMER: no, I am NOT 100% sure they were all freshmen, so yes these are gross over generalizations and this is also why i have FINALLY put something under a cut!)begin packing up and making as much noise as humanly possible! I was trying to pay attention and get the last bit of notes and I'm not even going to mention how RUDE that is to the Prof! come one people! is your time so DAMN important that you need to be that rude?!? you're not going to be late for your next class or anything, and hey! if you payed attention, you may actually get a college education worth your money!!! ok, i need to interject on myself for a bit!</LJ-cut>

Cutting back for something way more important! I was just coerced onto a motorcycle and I did not die! I made it back in one piece! oh wonder of wonders, this was NOT and elaborate plan to bump me off! lol! 

All kidding aside, it was pretty wonderful! It's a stunning day out! Not too hot, not too cold and crystal clear! We went down to the lake. It was incredible! Everything was sparkling! The wind in my... helmet.. OK! that one didn't work so well! lol! hey! it was a great workout for my butt too! ugh, and as much as I hate to admit it... it was a major turn-on! Especially with the choice of driver! UGH! i have no will power... But come on! Definitely extenuating circumstances! stunning scenery, beautiful day... Whatever my feelings about his personality or life habits... he's hot and this was fun! ^_~

plus, i have the sexy helmet-hair-flip down pat!! ^_~

ok, back to de ranty cut!    


<LJ-cut text=""Cut For Angry Freshmen Rant! PART 2!!"">SO, i plod along, through my day, already annoyed! I get to my Western Civ class (101 class number 2!! UGH why did i have to torture myself like this?!?!) I get into class and my Prof was already talking (yeah, i was a little late), but you'd never know it! there was this group of girls that were, again, talking over him. i quietly took out my notebook and a pen and waited for them to shut up! no such luck, and i was thinking, this is getting ridiculous! THEN, this girl (lady, she is a bit older, late 20s) yelled, 'Hey! Girls, just shut up, ok?!' I could have applauded and screamed, 'YOU GO GIRL!' They shut up after that and i think most of the older people in the class were very happy about that! I felt bad for my Prof though. He seemed very embarrassed and quiet for the rest of the class. it pissed me off even further that one of the girls just worked on a project for another class for the whole period. she didn't even try to hide it! ugh! seriously!! I know my class, for the most part, was never that rude! 

Look! I am usually the LAST person to rant about things like this! Unless you're hurting someone else, I say, ""live and let live and ignore them as much as you can until you explode and are forced to impart some serious homicidal rage on their asses!"" but this is waaaay to much! it's the middle of the week! it's a freaking wednesday! please, save some of your impatient rudeness for the end of the week or right before breaks or something!!! whatever, this rant has fizzled out like a birthday sparkler at bj's! lol! the other stuff, over the cut, was more entertaining anyway! i can't rant when i'm in a great mood like i am right now! ^_~ done now!</LJ-cut> 


Huh, very energizing! Better than a cup of coffee! ^_~

There are flowers on her dress. I wonder if she has ever stopped to smell one, or did she just trample them all with her feet? A wayfarer, a straining heart, curse cast and caged. Poisoned blood seeks contact, approval, forgiveness. Love... She reaches out a shaky hand, cold, cracked. The tips of her tired fingers remember, and realize their mistake. He turns away from her. She sinks to her soles. She struggles to steal back the scream. Once uttered, twice heard, never forgotten. She slipped and sold her soul to shadows. No substance there to hold something so heavy. He slept a sleep that dreamed a dream and damned the dame with the hell-bound heart...

Well ya play that Tarantella
All the hounds they start to roar
And the boys all go to hell
Then the Cubans hit the floor
And they drive along the pipeline
They tango till they're sore
They take apart their nightmares
And they leave them by the door.

Chorus:
Let me fall out the window
With confetti in my hair
Deal out jacks or better
On a blanket by the stairs
I'll tell you all my secrets
But I lie about my past
So send me off to bed forever more.

Make sure they play my theme song
I guess daisies will have to do
Just get me to New Orleans
And paint shadows on the pews
Turn the spit on that pig
Kick the drum and let me down
Put my clarinet beneath your bed
Till I get back in town.

Chorus

Just sure she's all in calico
And the color of a doll
Wave the flag on cadillac day
And a skillet on the wall
Cut me a switch or hold you breath
Till the sun goes down
Write my name on the hood
Send me off to another town.

Let me fall out the window
With confetti in my hair
Deal out jacks or better
On a blanket by the stairs
I'll tell you all my secrets
But I lie about my past
So send me off to bed forever more...."

Willbur is smiling because he is crying inside and at any moment he is going to murder that ecstatic little exclamation point next him!!! yup, that's kind of how i feel! lol) there are only 6 weeks left, i have sooo much to do and i just.... want... to.... be ... DONE!

*Went to visit MEGGGGGGGGIE over the weekend! (I think I'm going to call you Crumbles! or Crackers!) This was definitely the highlight of my break!!! I MISS YOU CRUMBLES!!! ^_~ omg! i am so jealous of her school! more later... and if Squeakers ever gets them up, PICS!

*Cute Is What We Aim For was AMAZING!! Lenny and Erik are my favorite sex toys EVER! ^_~ More later!! (awesome pic of me and Shaant, taken by Lenny! Shaant is totally stalking Lenny! lol!)

*New phone. It was awkward at first, but i think we're warming up to each other. I dropped it and scratched and I still feel sooooo sososo bad about that! I think it endeared the little phone to me cuz i wounded it. it's pretty though. still doesn't work in the house and some of its functions are foreign to me, but i'm learning.

*i have NO idea what I'm doing after graduation and it is FREAKING me out. this all...

"event","ok, this is more for my own benefit because i began to realize that i have severely overbooked myself for spring break! so here is the plan! if i have more than one plan on a certain day or days i'll pick whatever came up first, assuming i remember. if not, it's all first come first serve again. 

thursday (23): Jame's b-day! fredonia. out.

Friday (24): staying in Freddy for Laura (you know you love me ^_~) and because this is probably the easiest course of action for you Lenny!

Saturday (25): Concert with Lenny and Erik. Sorry Greg, we'll have to reschedule... sunday maybe?

Sunday: home, don't know when, don't know how. maybe getting together with greg.


ok... here's where things get sketchy... during the week, i'm doing stuff with friends that are home. now we get to: 

Thursday (30): I'm supposed to be going to Boston... or Buffalo... or a couple of other places... I'm of the mindset that this is not going to happen (although, i really hope i do get to Boston!!! i was really trying!!), but if it does, then it screws up any other plans for that weekend. aka:

FRIDAY (31): hmmm, this is an interesting day. this is the day i'm supposed to go visit meggie with christy... i think... i have no freaking idea! all i got from her was an im with some dates in it and then her profile had this trip laid out on the 31st. she didn't respond to any of my ims and she took those plans out of her profile. i have no idea what is going on and if i go to boston, i can't go see meggie. this is very frustrating! why would you make plans without telling anyone? i'm not home very often and i make plans really early on! one would think you would ask to see if i was free or not... or even just to confirm it with me! meggie! i want to see you so bad!!! i miss you like crazy!! but what the hell is going on with her?? first she bails on plans we made 3 months in advance and then, perhaps in an effort to boost her character, she makes plans without consulting us! i'm getting very tired of working around her schedule and her out of sight out of mind attitude! anyway, enough ranting. i guess i should try to figure this out sometime soon... meggie, maybe you should do it! ^_~

Saturday: hinges

Sunday: back to freddy


~anyway, like i said, this more so i don't forget anything or anyone, and so i don't overbook myself. hopefully, things will be resolved soon, and i am sooooo SOSOSOSOSOSO looking forward to a little rest and relaxation!! 9____9 


i neeeeeeed need need need to get away from the school work and drama (not too much drama, but something that has been weighing on my mind for a little bit) for a while and just figure some things out! mostly, i miss all the people i don't get to see very often!! i can't wait to see you guys! <3 <3 <3


The Dreamer wants a cure for her cold... or death!!! UUUUUUUUGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHH! (i couldn't even sleep last night! ;___;)"

wow! this is so perfect, and true! i really am an appletini! i like to drink them too! lol! although, i must say i am slightly distraught because when they asked the question, ""What's your favorite poison?"" the only choices were; rum, Tequila, Anything fruity, Anything salty, Gin, and Vodka! my poison is whiskey! so where is the whiskey in these choices?? nowhere! i am very disappointed! so i had to pick vodka, but oh well. whiskey, i love you still!


ok, for anyone that reads this lj diligently(i'm sure there aren't many of you) i PROMISE i will put something of substance in here the next time i post. when that will be.... is somewhat sketchy, but... at least it will have SUBSTANCE!! WOO HOO! lol!

"event","So, I'm feeling slightly cynical this Birth-tines (coined by the lovely Jada! <3). Can you tell by the layout? lol! His away message says something like, ""going to crawl under a rock until this day is over..."" Oh poor baby! Yeah, you've got it soooo bad! You turned ME down! You could have had someone! I'm really not all that bitter, but I do think he's being a whiny child. I mean, it's one thing to be single on your birthday. It's another thing to be single on valentines day, BUT it is a WHOLE 'nother story to be single on BOTH b-day and v-day at the SAME TIME! Yeah! That's what I have to deal with and I believe that might just be a LITTLE worse! ^_~ and i'm taking it like a man! lol! why can't he! *sigh* whatever... i guess, *guilty grin*, it's kind of nice to know that he's having a harder time than me right now. it's nice to know that he feels bad! lol! how terrible am i? I'm getting my jollies from knowing that the guy who rejected me is in pain. the normal-britty side of me feels bad for him though. i mean, with this attitude, it is going to be really hard for him to find a girl. ah, well! it's my birthday! I'm another year older... (another year closer to dying, JUST KIDDING) and another year on this wonderful earth! It's weird being 22! Just like it was weird turning 20. on the one hand i feel soooo ooooold! but on the other hand i feel... kind of mature and adulty (yes, i know that my usage of the word ""adulty"" makes me anything, but! lol!) and, if i had a 3rd hand, i still feel so much like a happy, carefree teen who misses playing with toys from the 80's and has a woolly mammoth stuffed animal named Giganto! OMG! Laura got me this card with sparkles and LIONS on the front! I totally squealed when I opened it!! it is SOOOO cute!! ...<--- see! perfect example! lol! you know, i feel caught between so many maturity levels, but i think that's just fine! i can act like a kid when i want to and an adult when i need to! good deal, good b-day, awesome friends to share it with! <3


  FOR ALL OF MY FRIENDS!!
i want to say thank you and I LOVE YOU SOOOO MUCH to every one of my friends! You guys have been the BEST! I mean it! I've had more Valentines this year than any other year! I think that's what Valentines really is, or at least what I believe it to be. It's a time, not just for couples, but a time to tell EVERYONE who is important in your life how much you care about them! so this is my day to tell all of my absolutely incredible friends that i think you are truly the GREATEST friends anyone could ever have! I mean it! through good times and bad, you have always been there. you've put up with me all these years and believe me, i KNOW that's not an easy thing to do! lol! i do not even know where i would be without you guys, but i know it would not be a good place at all! i cherish your friendships more than anything else in the entire world! I LOVE you all with all of my heart and to the greatest of my abilities! HAPPY VALENTINES DAY MY FRIENDS! MAY YOUR DAY BE FILLED WITH AS MUCH LOVE, AND MORE, AS I FEEL TODAY!!

<3 

It's nice to know that the cynicism hasn't completely taken over my life! ^_~


Thank you to everyone who wished me a happy birthday, left me an im, called, facebooked me, hugged me, kissed me, sang to me and just all around thought of me today! you make me feel like the luckiest person in the world and with friends and family like you, i know that i truly am! happy valentines day everyone!

(**and special love to my incredible housies! you always know when a cuddle or a hug is just the cure for a hurt heart! thanks for being just doors away and knowing just when i need to be dragged out of bed or joined there! ^_~ love you guys!)

I never loved it anyways
We fought the rain with the heaviest chains
Hoping to drown or float away...
Everything you could have been...
Has been rebuilt with gauze and tin
What I want is just to get on
Never get off
Never move on

And I dont have a single cell to pawn...
To the tricks the devil trips us on

"event","~Haven't posted a poem in a while. Here is one by the awesome John Koethe. This particular poem is new to me as well. I have his book ""The Constructor"", but not this one. I think I may just have to seek it out! PANIC IS TOMORROW!! I AM ECSTATIC!!! <3 The Dreamer



""Mary Astor's Journal""

by John Koethe

 
 The infamous ""Blue Diary"" of the thirties 
At long last purified by fire. Only
In New York could the body be free enough
To completely turn over its passion to words
Too stupid to ever conceal.

 
""His first initial is 'G'--- 
""And I fell for him like a ton of bricks.""

 
Arriving by plane in L.A.
She found him but recently dressed,
Arms bare in the rain. ""Gosh, it's so 
Perfectly hard!"" she breathed on her ticket.
And then: ""What woman was happier, ever?""

 
In 1935 Arletta Duncan, the Harvest Queen of Belle Plaine,
Iowa, decided to bow out. She collected all the memorabilia 
of her Hollywood career and made a great bonfire in a va-
cant lot in San Pedro. Then she mounted the gigantic, lethal 
letter ""H"" that was part of a development sign spelling out 
HOLLYWOODLAND, and nude, facing the city which had refused
her a crown, flung herself into the air. Her leap landed her 
square in a clump of prickly-pear cactus, where she was later 
discovered, ""a broken body hiding a broken heart""--her tale 
typical of many others.

 
O desert night!
The magician leaves, cruel fire descends.
His final weapon in the showdown:
""I need you,"" through tears,
Dumbly connecting the words through smoke
Until finally the pleasure is ours.

 
From Domes (1973)"

"event","Isn't it interesting how a song that you haven't heard in years can come back to you in such a profound way? How the meanings, of the lyrics, the music, can change so drastically over the years, but still have the same impact? They can bring back a powerful nostalgia, even after so much time and completely new feelings and emotions to be remembered the next time. Music, songs have so much power whether you notice or not. When I was young, this song was so sad to me. It still is. It made me look at my own mortality and that of the people around me. It showed me that we are not immortal and we never fully understand the time that we have. When I heard it today it also became a song of hope and a desperate warning. If you love someone, tell them, before they're gone! There is always a time and a place and never an excuse to leave things and regret that decision when it's too late to do anything. don't let resentment and anger hold you back, ever! so anyway, here's a bit of the song. it's beautiful and it's a very special song to me. hope you enjoy these excerpts.



In The Living Years
~Mike and the Mechanic

Crumpled bits of paper
Filled with imperfect thoughts
Stilted conversations
I'm afraid that's all we've got

You say you just don't see it
He says it's perfect sense
You just can't get agreement
In this present tense
We all talk a different language
Talkin' in defense

Say it loud, say it clear
You can listen as well as you hear
It's too late when we die
To admit we don't see eye to eye

So we open up a quarrel
Between the present and the past
We only sacrifice the future
It's the bitterness that lasts

So Don't yield to the fortunes
You sometimes see as fate
It may have a new perspective
On a different date
And if you don't give up, and don't give in
You may just be O.K.

Say it loud, say it clear
You can listen as well as you hear
It's too late when we die
To admit we don't see eye to eye

I wasn't there that morning
When my Father passed away
I didn't get to tell him
All the things I had to say

I think I caught his spirit
Later that same year
I'm sure I heard his echo
In my baby's new born tears
I just wish I could have told him in the living years

"event","""It's science versus the human need to believe in more than science. Logic rising from the shadows of mysticism... versus emotion and spirituality. As if the two are mutually exclusive. Are they?... There is room in our world for both. A need in our world for both. Nature may guide us in directions or relationships of her choosing... with pheromones, jealousy, rage, pretty smiles, or similarities of design... but our brains... our minds... our hearts allow us to learn from life and alter those decisions for the greater good of all. Moral choices in opposition to physical drives.   That is what can make us... make anyone, really... a 'superior' species.""

"event","It is the end of the second day.... of the rest of my life. More commonly known as the second day of classes in my last semester here at fredonia. I'm feeling the weight on so many levels. I don't want to leave here, it's such a scary thought! then i have to move out into the real word and i always feel that i am perpetually unprepared for anything new! i've gotten used to this place in the 4 years i have been here. it's small, and smells like bad cheese, but i love this place and i will miss it. it's a safe place for a directionless person like me! i can learn more and never have to worry about applying it! lol! anyway, i do love it here and i'm scared to leave. i'm scared to be done with something that took me 4 years to accomplish, but felt like it happened in the blink of a very small eye!

on the other hand i am immensly ready to be done! i really can't take this anymore! i am so checked out of the whole learning and classes thing! i was done before last semester ended! i has become so hard to get up in the morning and drag myself to class. i feel like i've spent too much time here. i feel like i need to do something new. i feel like i'm stagnating and i need to get out!

i feel trapped

and oh so contradictory!


i know these feelings will pass and i will get  back into the well worn groove of college life, but right now it's taking me every ounce of strength to keep from screaming and running! to where? i have no idea. I suppose these thoughts are also confounded by problems outside the college realm, but suppressing those thoughts with a vigor that any couch talking shrink would be proud of! ^_~ i feel bad, but i've become emotionless on a particular subject that meant a lot to me last semester. i have no drive to see the outcome. i think i've given away any emotional investment i would have had in the result. i just don't care anymore. *sigh* 

in another note, i think i'm becoming too involved in things that i should not be working on now. these things should be at the bottom of my to do list, but suddenly they've risen to the top and other things are suffering because of it.

well, anyway. please ignore the crazy ramblings of a tired and over-emotional girl.

IMPORTANT!!!!: I want the world to know my sorrow right now! yestarday i was informed that my landlord has contracted some people to... *GASP* rip out my BEAUTIFUL GLASS DOORS and replace them with a tacky, non-transparent, jail-cell of a door (aka a regular room door). i am devastated!! those doors had charm and uniqueness! they were beautiful and see-through and sarah and i could fit through the broken pane in the bottom of one of the doors!! i will miss them so much! what's more, i am going to feel so cloistered in the room now! even with the door open! people, i need your support! help me get through this horrible loss! i am crushed!

the countdown begins!
about 6 more days with my wonderful doors...


the dreamer is saaaad!

WEEE SCI-FI! enjoy all! <3


~~~~Techno Heaven~~~~

Electric flashes
Slicing through Techno Heaven
Regales that neo-city.

Metal dreamers create
Artificial imaginations.
Machinations
Of an inorganic future.

Crackling conduits
Speak the archaic language
Of electric and light orchestras,
The music of the metal
Rings in the alleyways.

Steel buildings bloom eternally
Growing leaves of luminosity.
Neon drivers fire
In brilliant spiraling supernovas,
Pure paintings of chrome and luster,
Swirling the flashing skies
Into the synaptic halos of synthetic angels.

Systematic fire and ice,
Fabricated souls,
Steel blood,
Coursing through vivid veins.
Perfect newborns,
Platinum flesh,
Stepping out into a sparkling world.
Created life in created life
In this city of Light.

Here the cyber punk's rules are God,
Spray painted onto circuit boards,
Coded onto chrome castles.
They ride the electric lanes,
Skate the sparkling streets with style.
They are the Monarchs of the Motherboard,
The Lords of the Luminous,
The Architects of the Machinations. 
They bear the synaptic fire.
They are the Kings
Of Techno Heaven.

where on earth did this past year go? it's unreal how an entire year can fall into obscurity in one minute. in one tick of the clock 2005 was gone and all of the things that we did went with it! we had fun! we had tears. there will be things from that year that we will remember for the rest of our lives, but there are things we couldn't remember 2 minutes after they happened (NO! i am NOT talking about those drunken hazes... but they didn't help either! ^_~). but even those moments, the ones we can't remember, helped to make this year what is was, good, bad or indifferent. it's important to take the time to remember all of the great moments of these past years, but i think it is also important to take a bit of time to acknowledge the moments that have fallen by the wayside. these are the memories that we can't put a finger on, can't tell a story about, but these are the ones that meld together to form the emotional backdrops for each year the passes in our heads. these moments are never lost, no matter how obscure. they just enrich our lives in a different way. so, for all those lost laughs and forgotten tears, phantom pains and faded smiles, thank you for making another year whole. and welcome to you, 2006, and all of the moments you will gives us all!


Man! i feel old! LOL! i know i shouldn't, but my measurement of time is becoming skewed. i still think that 2000 was less than a year ago!! i feel like i just got out of highschool and i'm going to be graduating college in ONE semester! i think of all of the young kids today that know nothing of what we grew up in! i mean, how many young kids know who Mr. Miagi was? not many and this was an ""important"" person for our generation. on halloween i asked a kid if he was a character from mortal kombat and he had NO idea what i was talking about! i KNOW how to SPELL mortal KOMBAT for goodness sakes! sometimes i feel like my memories are not current anymore. this is not such a bad feeling, but it's kind of weird. it's a new feeling. i've never had to deal with my PAST being outdated anymore! i am a child of the 80's and in about 10 years young kids will be asking me what it was like living in the 80's! what were the first computers like? how did i deal with such primitive video games? god! i hope i don't become the mother that can't program a VCR! lol! ooOOOMG!!! VCR!! WHAT'S THAT!! I JUST DATED MYSELF! LOL! Nobody owns a VCR anymore! LOL! OMG! I AM GOING TO STOP THIS RIGHT NOW!! I'M STILL YOUNG AND VITAL!! I DO NOT NEED A CANE, I DO NOT NEED MY FOOD MASHED INTO PASTE AND FED TO ME THROUGH A STRAW!! *sigh* hormones! lol! 

...i think i should take the side pony-tail out now and stop playing with this damn slap bracelet...

Motion City Soundtrack~ Attractive Today

I am wrecked. I am overblown.
I'm also fed up with the common cold.
But I just hate to say goodbye
To all the metaphors and lies
That have taken me years to come up with.

Say it's true. Say you like me.
(I like you.)
Just for the night 
For me it's been eternity..

And as I gently sip this drink,
I think about my lack of future,
And all the places I could learn to fall in love.

I know I shouldn't waste my time,
Wishing I'd been better designed,
Yet for some reason still think.

I am wrecked. I am overblown.
I'm also fed up with the fucking common cold!

When I just want to feel alive 
For the first time in my life,
I just want to feel attractive today.

Not knowing what is or is not illusion 
Riddled with myself and destruction 
Astray, and the bold raging flame of your heart is making me stay. 

and flux, we move, crawl across the sky like the weather 
To think that she once thought that I was clever 
But I was do or die not now or never 
Astray, still the bold raging flame of your heart is making me stay.



*Dreaming the time away...*

Astray

and times move so fast, and now there does not seem to be any 
and once it felt that there was more than plenty 
I do believe that something somewhere sent me 
To you, astray, and the bold raging flame of your heart is making me stay. 

and I admit, that I have spent some time in confusion 
Not knowing what is or is not illusion 
Riddled with myself and destruction 
Astray, and the bold raging flame of your heart is making me stay.

To think that she once thought that I was clever 
But I was do or die not now or never 
Astray, still the bold raging flame of your heart is making me stay.


No Fear of Falling

Through my sleepless days I've found,
That in my dreamless sleep I'm bound,
To one night here the sound, of you calling,
Do not stumble through tonight,
Have no fear of falling.

and if nobody got lost,
and if no-one paid the cost,
The price of this you may summise, is forever after,
You won't stumble through tonight drowning in their laughter.
You won't stumble through tonight drowning in their laughter.

From these moments, we awake,
Our heads clear of the mistakes,
How we never hit the breaks, or felt it stalling,
Just don't stumble through tonight,
Have no fear of falling.
No don't stumble through tonight,
Have no fear of falling.

Walking Wounded

Walk, wounded
Through the streets you fear.
Perish quietly
In the mysteries of your mind.
Tell tales
Of better days and dark histories.
Your are the Flightless,
The Mortal.
The Keepers of Death,
The Coveters of Life.
You stare at the eternal Earth, 
With fleeting eyes
And see nothing,
Everything.
You hone your spoken purposes,
And abandon the search
For your true ones. 
Then leave others,
With burnt fingers
From your spent fire.
The anatomies of truth
Allude you,
Blind you,
But you have perfected lies
Like no other creature.
Spinning them into webs
Of fancy
And false beauty.
Appeal with no penance,
Sincerity with no sense,
Here anyway, 
You walk
Wounded.



The Dreamer feels kind of humbled... and loved... hmmm..."

"event","well that's it. Japanese is done. Fucked and done. It's my fault. I have to answer for it, but, before i work myself back into my own self loathing let me just say that i am SO unbelievably glad that all of the extra work, that i did outside of class and to help my other classmates, amounted to NOTHING. It help me no where. I'm oh so glad that all of this extra time and effort i put forth for this class was completely lost on my professor. thanks. i've learned my lesson. now i'm back to hating myself for being the biggest loser in the fucking world! ta ta! have a good one! (FUCK THE WORLD!!)





On a happier note: i fucking nailed my presentation, probably because i was too pissed at myself to care what anyone thought. i got an awesome review and contributed a lot. And also, while i was walking here to write this entry and wait for the bus, i opened my phone to check the time and what did i see? my reminder to go have sex with jerome! it made me smile! something i needed today. ok i'm going now


The Dreamer is fucked!


Edit: i got my letter from the english department today. it was entertaining. verbatim: ""This is to confirm that you have been exempted from the requirement for ENGL100 English Composition, on the basis of the portfolio you submitted. Congratulations on your hard and successful work in English at Fredonia High School. etc..."" Well, I'm so very glad that I am able to write at the level of an above average High School student! Thanks Fredonia High School for teaching me SO much! ^_~ *sigh* it's so hard not to be cynical right now. at least this is one less thing i have to worry about. now, back to my frozen lunch and by Research Methods notes..."

"event","~Context of Life~


In what context 
Do you put a life?

Do you classify by sex?
By age, by race, by status?

Do you classify by desire?
By looks, by body, by mind?
Personality? Chemistry? Heart? 
Heat? 

Are you prone to folly,
Or do you walk with grace?

Are you a scholar, a cynic?
A lover, a lonely,
A puppet, a poet?

Do you have friends,
Or do your friends have you?

Do you exercise,
Or asphyxiate?

Are you dying to live?
Or living to die?

And who do you live for,
Or what?

Do you pray? 
Do you curse?
Do you believe?
Do you deny? 

Is there a purpose to the things you buy,
Or do you buy to find a purpose?
Are they treasures,
Or junk?
Do they make you,
Or clutter you?

Do stars call you,
Or city lights?

Do you sleep peacefully,
Or troubled?

Do you dream?

And if you do, 
Do you believe in your dreams?

What does it mean to be soulful,
Thoughtful,
Loving, caring, crazy?
Happy?

Do you live by laws,
Or do you live by breaking them?

Do you believe in science,
Or magic?
Religion, rationality, revolution?

Do you choose brutality,
Or indifference?
Can you ever be purely peaceful?

Do you embrace
Imagination and curiosity?
Or do you fear them?

Do you shake hands,
Or hug?

Do you have sex,
Or make love?

Do you scream?
Or are you silent?

Do you travel?
With money or your mind?

What is love?
Is it tangible,
Metaphoric?
Healing,
Or scarring?
Beauty,
Or betrayal?

Are you afraid of darkness,
Or light?
Pain?
Or the lack thereof? 

Do you have a 
Sense of self,
Sense of morals,
Sense of humor? 

We are all works in progress.

What do my words mean to you?
Do they simply slip
Through the cracks
In your consciousness?

I am 
I am
I am
In a Context of Life.

Where are you?

"event","Purple Jesus was a huge hit! I have to admit, i was worried it wouldn't work out. How wrong was I?!
~hmmm... i'm debating on whether or not to post the full list here....

The mistletoe was less effective, but it did provide for some interesting match ups later on! (Mike and Kendall!) 


Good times, good unwind

good grief my voice is gone! 




Compliments on various parts of my anatomy!

(4 )The Rack!
~spurned by a phone conversation between a friend who moved to Albany and his former housemates. Apparently, during the course of this conversation he complimented my ass (see below) and my 'rack'.  I think Brenda and Eddie enjoyed it immensely! ^_~ eh whatever! His housemates agreed and consequently so did some other people! That's nice to hear, i guess? I'm glad people think my breasts are praise worthy. Thanks everyone, my boobs feel great. (And yes, i like them too! ^_~) 

(2 )The Ass!
~began with a game of Girl Talk. Believe me! This game is MUCH more interesting when you're playing it with guys! Especially if they are asked to say something they like about everyone at the table. Apparently my ass is very eye-catching. Next, Andy's phone conversation. (see above) not one, but two things that Andy liked about me! ^_~ *sigh* sometimes... i wonder! and then i shake my nice ass and forget all of my worries! 

(1) The Hair
~well Kendall just likes my hair. He thinks it's interesting and i always get a massage out of the deal so, i'm not complaining! ^_~

Today in my LAST CLASS of Research Methods, our prof told us about a study that was done on a college campus in Florida. 6 men and 6 women went out on the campus and propostioned complete strangers of the opposite sex. That is, they asked them to have sex with them. Here are the results of the study.

100% of the women that were asked said NO! you go girls! ^_~




75% of the men that were asked said..... YES! lol! omg! guys! are you THAT horny??







so anyway, i'm currently in the computer lab working on my manuscript so, back to that i go! ooo! getting the trash can for purple jesus tonight! how fun! ^_~

last night was fun though. laura and i baked a cake for sarah with my NEW BUNT PAN! she had her cabaret night and we thought it would be a nice surprise! we invited a few people (Jerome, Jeff, Mary, Mike and Michelle) and cracked open a bottle of wine (well rather.... Jerome tried to open it, broke the bottle opener IN the cork. Mike when home, got a heavy duty one... meanwhile Jeff tried to pry the broken bottle opener and the cork out with plyers...i left because i dodn't want to see the ensuing destruction, but eventually the got it open, with minimal cork bits in wine and we finished the bottle between the 8 of us!) we sat around, had cake and wine and talked for a while. Mary and Jeff left and the rest of played Girl Talk! (blindfolding someone and then having them put lipstick on another person is REALLY entertaining!) Mike won! Michelle left and the rest of us had group orgies on my bed, sarah's bed and then laura's bed. the night ended with a rousing game of ""never have i ever"" and then off to bed at about 3am. and then....I WAKE UP THE NEXT DAY TO FIND I HAVE AN AWEFUL COLD AND FEEL LIKE SHIT! *sigh* funny how things work huh? (oh, i think i need to mention that in Girl Talk, i got a question that asked who my crush was.... I am SO glad Jeff left BEFORE the game started! My housemates... were not! HAH! ^_~)

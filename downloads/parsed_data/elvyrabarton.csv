"event","Wow, long time no update. =P  But here I am... filling in the blanks with all the useless information that is me.  First off... I'm moving to Texas!!  Yea!!  I'm excited.  it's not like gonna be tomorrow or anything... but I will be moving. =D  I can hardly wait.  And with any luck... I'll be able to transfer soon.  I hate hiring freezes. >_<  But it's cool.  I'll save a little and use this time to get back on my feet financially. =D

I've been feeling a bit disconnected lately and can't place why... =S  I've tried to think of several reasons, but none of them seem to click.  Oh well... things will get better... I know they will.

*sigh*  Okay... getting sleepy... need sleepy time... *yawn*  Good night. *hugs*

"event","Man, I hate it when I have these kindsa days. *rolls eyes*  It seems I've been having them more frequently lately.  And now the icing on the cake.

Okay, I have had this major fascination with this guy I've talked to on MSN and we usually have some interesting conversations... well, that's what I thought.  He never said anything, so I asked him, just in case cuz I didn't want to bother him.  I found out that most of the time I annoy him. Now I'm devastated. ;_;  He was one of the main reasons I signed in everyday to talk.  I never dreamed that I got on his nerves... so I asked him why he never told me and he said it was because he felt that would be rude.  But I would have rather had him tell me the truth... it makes it worse knowing that he thinks I'm annoying and felt like he couldn't tell me. ;_;  This is really lame, I know... I don't even know him.  But he's got this funny personality.

I guess it could just be that he's had a really horrible week already and it's just gettting started.  Maybe I should just give him a few days and see how it goes then.  *sigh* Oh well... I am just overtired... but I can't sleep.  Which brings me to another problem.  I can't sleep anymore.  I'm good to get two-three hours a night.  The thing is... it doesn't bother me... I mean, I get tired sometimes, but for the most part, I enjoy having the extra hours awake time for doing whatevers.

Man, somehow, when I end up putting stuff in here, it ends up sounding lame by the time I get finished.  Hmm... oh well.  I'm done."

"event","*sighs*  I have said it time and time again that I'm happy being alone, but it's beginning to get to me.  I have been through relationship after relationship thinking that it was finally the one!  But then it turns out to be worse than the last... that's bad.  I am generally a happy person willing to help anyone and I've been told numerous times that my heart is too big... but lately I've been finding myself a little less willing to share things I would have even two years ago... I don't wanna have my feelings hurt anymore... and I feel that the only way to keep this from happening is to be the hard, cold meanie I feel I'm becoming.

I think it's the weather.  For some reason, at this time each year, I begin to wish that love was in the air for me... but I don't want a serious commitment... I'm scared to commit... I pride myself on individuality and I am scared that if I settle into a relationship, I'll lose that.  And it's because I want only for the person I'm with to be happy, so i give up everything to ensure their happiness.

The only problem with opening up and telling all is that somewhere along the way, I end up contradicting myself... ""I wanna fall in love!""... ""I don't wanna a relationship.""  It's frustrating!  Maybe I'm better off just having internet relationships... their easier and less chaotic as real ones. *sighs* Oh well... that's my heart... I'll tell it once again that there IS some one out there for us... we just have to wait for him. :("

"event","Well, here it is... another day.  I've talked to a few friends today, but I'm guessing my sissy's phone got cut off, cuz I waited for her all night and she never signed in... all day yesterday and all night last night. *sigh*  And I don't know what happened to Shady :(... We were talking, then he disappeared and didn't come back... Oh well... I've been feeling kinda sad today.  Don't know why... maybe it's boredom.  I really need to find a job... but I don't even know where to begin looking.  This boring thing I call life is getting to me... I have no friends except for the ones online, and some of them are questionable.  The only real person I have is my sis, but I only get to see her on the weekends.  And if her phone got cut off, it'll make it worse since I won't be able to talk to her at all until Friday...:( Hmm... I guess I'll think of something to do until I can find a job... *sighs and slinks off into a corner*"

"event","Gack!  Man, being an S-Mod of a forum bites sometimes!  Especially when a friend of mine is one too and he does things just because he is unhappy about something...  Anyhoos... I signed on earlier to check the forum and much to my horror and dismay, I find that he's gone into the admin functions and changed the Censored Words list so that certain screen names would read something vulgar and nasty!  But what made it worse was that he changed the News Fader to read something ugly about the admin himself!  Well, I went in and changed everything back since we had some new members on at the time and the admin prolly wouldn't be on again until tomorrow... I sent an IM to the admin about it, but I know this guy will simply pass off the excuse that he stays logged in all the time and a friend used his computer.  I would be inclined to believe this except this isn't the first time it's happened and the last time it happened, he used the exact same excuse... *sighs* He's my friend, but what do you do about something like this?  Oh well... I left it in the admin's hands and I made sure that everything was set back the way it was..."

"event","i need to start smoking pot again. i stopped because it was messing up my focus at school.




............i graduated.




i know i shouldn't. but man oh man. i haven't smoked in months.  i should make a rule for myself. NEVER BUY IT. i'm not going to be able to afford it; i'm gonna have to pay rent and buy groceries soon and i don't want to make a habit out of buying it. it's selfish, i know. but i smoked myself silly for two years... and i never bought anything, ever. so i could definately do that again. i just need to find some stoner friends. some stoner friends who are actually good friends as well as stoners. unlike those other people i used to hang with.



i wonder why i get so attached to people. like tom; we're just coworkers. seriously. that's it. but when he talks to jasmine at work i get so jealous. they got into a huge fight today because jasmine was being stupid and wouldn't cook and i was wishing that i was jasmine so he would be like... yelling at me? he's so hot. oh man. i think i'm just lusting over him. well... i know i am. i wanted to ask him today if he wanted to smoke together sometime; because this was our last day working together... but i knew i'd end up having sex with him and that's really really bad. and i don't know how seriously he would take it. not the sex. just like...
i dont know... he's weird. he's so fucking nice to me and in the line, he makes my food first if i'm looking frantic and he'll always hand me the food, and sometimes he flirts and like pulls it away and whatnot. but to everyone else he's a complete douche. AHHHHHH i don't know how to explain him. but i don't think he takes life very seriously. he dropped out of high school. i think he's just one of those guys who doesn't get attached to anybody. which is whatever... i mean i'll probably forget about him in a month or two.. but right now all i want to do is be around him. infact today i stayed at work a whole extra hour, just so i could share oxygen with him.
i like to make people think that i'm not like this... get easily attached and whatnot. but really, i am. 



i talked to noah today. it was quite painful. but easier than i thought.



oh and by the way i've gained so much fucking weight it's discusting."

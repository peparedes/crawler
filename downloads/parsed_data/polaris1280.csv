lookin' back at all the lows and all the highs
through the black and white and the in between
all the miles I've walked 
the wars I've fought 
and all I've seen

It all seems like yesterday
like a bird, time just flies away
no sooner than you say hello
It's time, It's time, It's time to say goodbye

Consumed by worry, stress and fear
never learning to live
weighed down by wondering why we're here
collected memories
all that's in the end
I guess a sense of peace wasn't meant for some, my friend

It all seems like yesterday

"event","Tired of this
done with that
never satisfied with where I'm at
I sit and think
what to do
just a mother fuckin' bore
without a clue

Shot my drugs
drank my booze
tired of joy and self abuse
eternally jaded through and through
just a self loathing dick
without a clue

Oh, bored to death
I'm just bored to tears
same old shit just different days and years
killed myself but that got boring too
so beyond the point where it's not true

Far beyond high
dramatically low
eternal stare as if I care to know
all of this struggle
all this work
in the end you die like some moronic jerk

Shot my drugs
drank my booze
tired of joy and self abuse
eternally jaded through and through
just a self loathing fuck
without a clue

Oh, bored to death
I'm just bored to tears
same old shit just different days and years 
killed myself but that got boring too
so beyond the point where it's not true

The colors I see are all bleeding
the sound that was is now standing still
I wonder when it was it all faded
a dullen corpse that cannot be killed

Oh, bored to death 
I'm just bored to tears 
same old shit just different days and years
killed myself but that got boring too
just a self loathing fuck
without a clue

"event","So this past week has been shitty. Since Joe did what he did, him and I are no longer friends which sucks but thats the way it has to be. That day Kelly called her father and told him the story. Russ said to call the police but I fought against it and kept Joe's ass out of prison. Russ yelled at me telling me that ""He was going to eat my fucking liver"", I have never heard this man say the word fuck. After that I was stewing for a few days. When I went to grandma's house the other day is when I started to tell Kelly the way I was feeling about it all. Everything was fine at my grandma's but then on the way home Kelly and I started fighting again and it only got worse. Once we got home I was fixing the wall in the kitchen and I let it all come out. I said somethings about Kelly's family that I didn't mean and I won't ever say again because I didn't mean them, I was just talking shit. I ripped out Kelly's insides and stomped all over them with the things that I said and I almost lost her over it. I'm kissing major ass now, I made her a candle light dinner last night and breakfast this morning. Kelly says that I need to change back to the old me and she's right. I'm going to change back to the old me before my father died, a happy me. I made a vow when I was little to never hit a woman and I stick to that but the other night I might as well have done it because I feel like I have with my words. Things seem to be getting better between her and I now. I have not yelled at her since that night and I will try my hardest to never yell at her again because she doesn't deserve it, at least not all the time like I was before. (which was everyday) I am going to go see the Megadeth show for sure. Kelly bought me two tickets, one for me and one for my little brother. I don't mind taking my little brother because he's alright, I don't have to worry about him at this concert because this place has seats. We're in the 7th row center which is where I want to be. Joe just remember that I saved you from being someones anal bitch for a long time O.K. The choice was not mine to end this friendship, it was an order from Russ. If you step foot on my property again, I am out of a place to live. Well that's the gist of it.

I assume that they will work me from 4 to noon then send me home for the show then after that they will probably want me back sometime after 10 pm to go pack the shit back up. Sometime in there I have to go to school so my day is fucked. I just took a Vivaran to keep my not so happy ass awake. I'm tired of everything, school, work, and all the things that follow. I keep saying that life is a game so play well, I just can't wait for the game over anymore. The one downfall to this job is that I go early as fuck to a site, put all this shit together just to came back a few hours later to put it back in the fucking boxes and send it back on the road. I think that I want a normal job, I don't really care what it is just a job that doesn't involve getting the shit kicked out of me. Kelly is at work till 6 am and I have to leave at 3:30. I'm having a panic attack for some reason and have been for the past few days. It won't let up, it's a constant struggle to stay happy anymore I and I don't want to fight anymore. All I look forward to is the end because everything ends and I'm just waiting for mine. The only good thing that I have is Kelly and while she does piss me off from time to time I would rather have her than not. I keep doing all these thing mostly to please her but mainly because it's what society wants and if I don't I lose. I never said that I want to loose the game I want to beat it and get the fuck out, I just wish that there was a few cheat codes to use. I don't use codes in games because it's considered cheating but in this game I wouldn't mind a few. Unlimited money, invincibility, and stamina wouldn't hurt. Something just doesn't feel right and I can't put my finger on it, but what ever the hell it is I wish it would correct itself. There it is, lets fucking play."

Please don't let this bother you guys more than I'm sure than it already has.
     Joe I called Emily and guess the fuck what, I got some paid training, 2 days of load in for Moving Out, a day of load out for Moving out, and WWE.

Before I would be able to do things around the house and the like, with no problem, but now My body feels like I weigh a 1,000 pounds. There is no motivation and eventually things get done. The up-side is that I don't get angry with things that I use to, mainly the dumb shit.  
     I started school on Monday and it sucks for the most part but it's better than regular school so I can't complain. The things that suck about the school is that when we have our little 15 minute breaks I can't go outside to smoke. That would be nice and would help me out but what the hell can you do. The good thing about it is that it's only five hours a day, four days a week. No big deal I can do this!!! Today I only went for to school for two hours though. I didn't feel good at all today and I didn't do any thing around the house. I mostly laid in bed all day. 
     Jay is also at school with me. Thats a good thing because now we see each other everyday. Since school has started I've done coke twice and smoked just a about a bowl a day. I have to make what I have last, when Joe left I had about two bowls and Jay has brought some over a few times.Well that's it I'm done for now."

I sat in my grandma's living room and smoked pot from Joe's scorpion while I watched ""The Big Bounce"". I pasted the pipe to my grandma like she was one of the gang and she reluctantly took it. Now what shocked me the most was when she asked, and I quote, "" Does this mother fucker have a carb?"" I nearly shit myself when she said that.
   After all that we all had a laughing fit because when I handed the pipe to her she made a joke about thinking there was a bug at the end of it and How one night someone will be stoned and think that there is a bug at the end of the pipe and DROP it. 
   On another note, I do miss Trish and although I did not cry in front or behind you all, I just held it back because someone had to keep they're shit together. I will mot lie, it was there but we all need to be strong and keep our shit straight.
   
     P.S. Fuck Captin' Willie;)"

I got there at ten and was out of there at eleven. (empty fuckin' handed). Then from there we went to Amphi high to see if they would give me my transcripts. After a little sweet talking from Kelly, she got her way but I'm not complaining. Not only did I get my transcipts for free but I got a withdrawal slip without the need of a parent signature.
  We came home after that and relaxed for a while. From there we went to Desert Rose to see if we could sweet talk them into letting me enroll without the need of a parent, but they were closed. We went to Ace Hardware to get some LYE to unclog our shower drain. I don't know how that stuff works yet, I haven't used it yet. 
   Then we went to Kelly's dentist. She made it sound like she had some serious damage that needed to get repaired but all they did was take out the other stitch. Now from there we went to Rhino to pick up my check. I'll tell you the rest later but now I have to go"

When I went out, Carrie, as you all know is her little lezbo friend, came over sad and looking to get fucked up. Carrie has told me to my face that she likes girly girls, Kelly is a girly girl, and that If Carrie had the chance she would date Kelly. I trust Kelly 100%, But when I walked into our bedroom to find these two women in our bed, I was outraged. A lot of guys would probably say "" score, I've got two girls in my bed"" but I say NO.

I don't know where we are going or what we are doing but I don't have a problem with any of it."

"event","Wine is fine, but whiskey's quicker
suicide is slow with liquor
take a bottle, drown your sorrows
then it floods away tomorrows

Evil thoughts and evil doings
cold alone, you hang in ruins
thought that you'd escape the reaper
you can't escape your Master keeper

Cause you feel life's unreal and your living a lie
such a shame, who's to blame, and your wondering why 
then you ask from your cask, "" Is there life after birth?""
what you saw can mean hell on this earth

Now you live inside a bottle 
the reaper's traveling at full throttle
It's catching you, but you can't see
the reaper's you and the reaper is me

Breaking laws, knocking doors, but there's no one at home
made your bed, rest your head, but you lie there and moan
where to hide, suicide is the only way out
don't you know what it's really about

Wine is fine, but whiskey's quicker
suicide is slow with liquor
take a bottle, drown your sorrows
then it floods away tomorrows

    Nobody freak out. Yes, I have a bottle of whiskey, and Yes, I do feel that way sometimes. But If you really know who I am You would see that this is just talk. I say again "" nobody freak out."

"event","There's something sick
inside these walls
your loss of mind has
come and called
your dissolution view of
why
you'll find no dignity upon 
the day you die

In the end we find what's
true
suffering overdue

You claim this oath and
then you swore
beyond today, beyond 
forever more
withdrawn inside these
sickened walls
silence is broken and you
can't break me no more

In the end we find what's
true
suffering overdue

I tried to speak my mind
but it fell on deaf ears
these scars I've held
within for so many years

 All I have to say is sorry Joe!"

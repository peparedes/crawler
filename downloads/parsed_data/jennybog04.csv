"event","<P>Hola!!! first i need to start by asking if everyone could pray for my dad. He is in the hospital due to internal bleeding and he is getting a couple of procedures done today to find the cause and source of the bleeding. hopefully he will be coming home today and i hope they find out exactly what is wrong. So keep him in your prayers. Thanks :-)</P>
<P>Friday: after arguing with tommy about what we were going to do i ended up at his house watching scary movie 3, the flyers, and something else but i forget.&nbsp; I was just glad that it was friday and i was on fall break :-)</P>
<P>Saturday: worked 8-4 and suffered through the god damn flu clinic CVS was holding and i was sick of talking to old people in person and on the phone... grrr.... then i went to church and came home, got a shower and then tommy picked my up for the Glenoldne Bicenntial Party at the firehouse. Ate, danced and had an absolute blast!!!&nbsp; Of course they got a fire call and all the women just danced or sat around til they got back....It was so cool to watch all them get ready to fight a fire...it was hot!!! lol.&nbsp; I guess it's true that 95% of girls who see their boyfriend fight a fire marry them, even tho i didn't see him fight it lol.Got home late and then went to bed even tho i wanted to soak my feet lol</P>
<P>Sunday: worked 8-4...picked up tommy and then went to the hospital to visit my dad, He looked so cute sleeping but I woke him up lol.&nbsp; He's still himself cracking jokes and you really wouldn't know anything was wrong with him except for the machines and stuff.&nbsp; Then i went home, got a shower and tommy picked my up for him hockey game.&nbsp; I sat with Mr. and Mrs. August and watched my man play&nbsp;some hockey :-)&nbsp; The game at 7 was more of a wrestling match then a hockey game but the game @ 9 was really good.&nbsp; Thank god the kid who broke him foot and had to leave on a stretcher was not tommy because mrs. august would have had a heart attack. lol.&nbsp; Waited for tommy after and then we went to wawa for those pretzels with that sour cream or something in it...delicious!!!!!</P>
<P>Today i work 4-10 but i'm visiting my dad before that :-)&nbsp; later..</P>"

"event","<P>This past weekend was just amazing!!! It was all wedding related and it was just so much fun! </P>
<P>Well first of all wednesday was the season premiere of Lost and tommy came over just like tradition has it for us to watch it every wednesday.&nbsp; Just amazing and i can't wait for tonight's episode :-)</P>
<P>thursday was the rehearsal dinner at some really nice italian restaurant on west chester pike. We had some really good and then the soon to be bride and groom passed out gifts for the extremely large wedding party. The guys got martini shakers with their name engraved on it with a keychain that was a fishing rod since that was part of the bachelor party. The girls got jewelry for the wedding, flip flops for the reception and beach-bag- like purse.&nbsp; Tommy drove me home and then i wrapped my dad's birthday present for the next day.</P>
<P>Friday i had classes and then that night was the serenade at his aunt tree and uncle jerry's house.&nbsp; His cousin jerry picked me, tommy and debbie up so that if were to have drinks that we could.&nbsp; Got there and his uncle made me frozen green apple martini or margarita i forget which it was...but it was very good.&nbsp; Watched the phillies game and i supposedly jinxed it since they were up 3-0 and then were down 9-6 but then came back and won 11-10 so take that lol.&nbsp;Before that dan and nicole danced to music in the driveway but he never officially sang to her like italian tradition says to lol.&nbsp; he didn't have enough alcohol in him yet lol.&nbsp; Then we hung out on the deck, danced and had fun....i got wacked in the face by a swinging pom tree that left a cut and later a bruise. thanks jerry for tying it back to the house. and no tommy it wasn't a huge pineapple lol.&nbsp; went home and went straight to bed since i had a early and long day ahead of me. </P>
<P>Saturday i woke up at 6:20, got a shower, pu ton my nails, straightened my hair and then picked debbie up to get her hair doen @ 9 am.&nbsp; then we went back to her house, i hung out with tommy as he just woke until debbie was ready for my help. then i helped her get ready with the dress and all.&nbsp; Took her to her uncle's house @ 11 and then went to get my hair done @ 11:30.&nbsp; took forever because the girl was doing a blow dry and then she did me.I was completely against her doin gmy hair since the lady who normally does my hair wasn't there. she had my hair spiking in every direction and i had to tell her what to do b/c if i didn't i would have looked like freak.&nbsp; So then an hour later i sped home, stripped and put my dress on, packed my makeup, my mom helped me with the bow, i got my shoes on, tried not to rip my stockings, grabbed my school bag and ran out the door to pick tommy up @ 1 to take him to the church by 1:15. Got to tommy's and he wasn't even dressed yet so i ran back to the car and got my makeup and put it on at his house.&nbsp; I forgot the present and pins for debbie so i had my mom meet me outside on the way to the church and then we were off.&nbsp; Got to the church around 130 and guys were tailgating in the church parking lot lol.&nbsp; the bride and her father arrived in a historic car and then the bridal party in a trolley.&nbsp; I sat in church with chris and their aunt jenny.&nbsp; The ceremony was beautiful and when dan saw nicole coming down he aisle and starting crying i thought that was the cutest thing ever!!! after the ceremony, they got pics in the church and then we were off to the drexelbrook.</P>
<P>I followed their uncle jerry and then chris followed me.&nbsp; We stopped at a cvs so i could get batteries and we all stacked up on food b/c we were starving. got to the drexelbrook for more pics, and anxiously awaited for open bar. 5 o'clock hit and we were gone.&nbsp; 3 malibu bay breezes and 2 things of champagne&nbsp;by dinner and mr. august told me to get another bay breeze before dinner so i did :-)&nbsp; Dinner was great but i was so stuffed from drinks and appetizers that i didn't really finish anything.&nbsp; Lost count of drinks i had and we danced all night! fought with jen for the bouqet but i lost and then chris got the garder even tho he didn't catch it. tommy said that even tho it was coming to him that he would have given it to chris because he wasn't going up his cousin's leg lol.&nbsp;Danced and drank the night away and had the times of our lives.&nbsp; It was me and tommy's prom that we never had :-)</P>
<P>went&nbsp; back to his uncle nick's house and he spent his time outside smoking cigars and drinking more while i chilld inside and ate the long awaited pizza for uncle gus lol.&nbsp; left around 1:15 and went to tommy's house where we spent the night. From about 3:30 on tommy spent the night getting sick and i felt bad that i couldn't help him b/c if i got up from the position that i was in then i would have gotten sick too. I couldn't even lay on my stomach lol.&nbsp; got up around 8 with only 6 1/2 hours of sleep and helped tommy get rid of his ""tummy ache"" lol.&nbsp; but me and mrs. august had a kick out of watching the whole thing. lol.&nbsp; Dropped mrs. august off at aunt tree's house to get her car and then i went to work at 12...not a good idea.&nbsp; felt nausous and just drank gatorade and eventually perked up.&nbsp; Me and tommy don't even want to picture the day after our 21st birthday party.....it's gonna be scary!</P>
<P>Well so that was my great weekend and it was agreat kickoff to the school year kinda lol.&nbsp; I'm alot less stressed in school this week and i don't know why.&nbsp; Everyone kept asking us who we thought would be the next to get married and me and tommy would say jen and chriss and then jen and chris would say me and tommy. We would just say each other because we weren't gonna say that we would be next lol.....we will jsut have to wait and see :-)</P>"

"event","<P><EM>Well as of this morning i lost 6 pounds in 5 days and i feel great!!! i love being able to wear whatever and actually feel skinny and have people compliment me.&nbsp; I weight i am now is prob the weight i was when i lost saw all my friends so they prob won't notice but if i keep going th rate i am now until tommy's cousin's wedding, nothing is going to be left of me :-)&nbsp; My goal was 10 pounds(2 pounds less than my lowest weight that i achieved this summer) so i have a few more to go.&nbsp; The wedding is next saturday and hopefully i will still fit into my dress but i hope i don't have to worry about that.&nbsp; I just want to go the wedding and drink and eat without worrying how fat i will get.&nbsp; So by losing some extra weight i will have some room to gain i guess :-) Tomorrow b4 my 2:00 class i'm going&nbsp;&nbsp;to the granite run mall to pick up these cute shoes from DEB for the wedding since the shoes i borrowed had a toes separater and i need to wear stockings.&nbsp; This wedding is costing me more than i expected. o well...</EM></P>
<P><EM>Last nite me and tommy had a little argument about something i brought up and made a bigger deal about it than it really was b/c i was tired and cranky. So when i woke up this morning i realized how stupid it was so i had the urge later in the day to surprise tommy during his 3 hour break at school. i left after my 12:00 class and was on the road by 1.&nbsp; i told him i would call on his break but instead he called at 1:45 while i was about to get off at his exit lol.&nbsp; i was playing it kool and everything and then when i got there i found out that he was outside the caf talking to me and hadn't gone in yet to eat so i knew when the jasmine cafe was.&nbsp; Of course he wasn't there and i didn't know of any other entrances. And then the huge bell started going off and i was hoping he wouldn't hear an echo and then i saw lauren mchugh and i had to keep quiet b/c he thought i was home.&nbsp; so i finally asked where he was b/c i was there and he got really excited and didn't believe me. so i met him in the cafe and here i had drove right past him and when we were on the phone he was on the othter side of the wall. weird.&nbsp; So we saw mary shea, talked to him for a bit and then we got lunch and chilled. Went to the library, walked around campus, and after almost 1 1/2 hours i left.&nbsp; Tommy, i love you so much and nothing will ever come between us b/c i love too much!!!&nbsp; I am so proud of you for being a firefighter and i will be there every step of the way and i can't wait to hear all your rescue stories and we're gonna have so much fun going to those parties and meeting all those new people!!!! :-)&nbsp; I love you babe!!!</EM></P>
<P><EM>So now i should go and try to concentrate even tho the eagles are on and all my dad's friends are loud and i really don't want to do anything.&nbsp; But i have too much to catch up on by wednesday and it won't stop kicking me in the ass so i gotta go :-)</EM></P>"

Well i didn't know where the stupid breaks were and he had me going faster so i felt like i was the tazmanian devil. lol.&nbsp; I ran up on a curb and went flying.&nbsp; I laid on the ground crying while my brother helped me up since i couldn't feel my left arm. i really thought i broke it but my whole shoulder is just really bruised, my hands are effed up and my left knee looks like rocky's black eye. lol.&nbsp;The side of right foot is also pretty sore b/c my flip flop came off and i hit my foot on the street. thank go no cars were coming because i would have been road kill :-) </P>

"event","<P>Well i didn't update the whole summer because my computer was messed and frankly i just didn't care :-)&nbsp; I worked and when i wasn't working i was in delaware visiting tommy.&nbsp; I just got back from long neck delaware for labor day and it was awesome! Drinking, partying, hanging out and having an awesome time with tommy's family.&nbsp; Woke up on Monday with a hangover but it was all good b/c we had a blast. Nothing was better than sitting on the dock with a drink in your hand and watching the fireworks :-)&nbsp; </P>
<P>School is good and i love my classes except for Moral philosophy....big yawn.&nbsp; they are definitely not going to be easy but with my western civ class being my earliest and the teacher being on drugs and all my days begin pretty good.&nbsp; </P>
<P>I am back on the south beach diet now that the summer is ""unofficially"" over and i can stop eating all the junk food in delaware lol.&nbsp;&nbsp;My goal is what my weight was for the 4th of july.&nbsp; At that point i had lost a total of 12 pounds and i felt great. Once i get into the swing of things at school again i will start back at the gym.&nbsp; I just want to feel great for tommy's cousin's wedding in a couple of weeks :-)&nbsp; Wish me luck and that i don't give into temptations. </P>
<P>So overall this summer was awesome!! My family came down to delaware for part of out vacation and the familys bonded lol.&nbsp; i got to see my tommy ALOT and it was great! Now school is up and running and hopefully the stressed jen doesn't come out yet :-)</P>"

"event","<P>AHHHH!! Grrr.... i hate finals it is the MoSt stressful time of the year!!!&nbsp; The worst part is that i stress like you wouldn't believe and i take it out on the wrong people.&nbsp; I know i have to change it but it's just the way i roll when studying and due dates come around. It's not even that i procrastinate it's just that i'm so nervous and anxious that i stress and realize how hard school is.&nbsp; I've wanted to shun myself from the rest of the world so there are no distractions and i wouldn't hurt anyone's feelings by my smartass comments or comments that are taken the wrong way b/c it seems like whatever i say comes out wrong to the next person and that's not good. It's just that i'm in such a testy mood that anything at this point is annoying. ya know? i just can't wait til summer is here and the ""summer jen"" is back. lol. </P>
<P>The only helpful thing right now calming my stressy moods is the track. I've gone with tommy the past couple of mornings and walked 2 or 3 miles but even then i'm thinking about what i have to get done, etc.&nbsp; Then i go home and study like it's my job again. I just wish things would come much easier to me so i wouldn't have to work my ass off for a mediocre grade- it sucks!! Well now i'm gonna go and study some more for my western civ final tomorrow at 2. so if you're completely free,, an extra prayer wouldn't hurt. lol.&nbsp; Thanks and let's just hope i come out of this week aLivE!!!!</P>"

Me, hilary and col went to alex's house where all the couples were getting pics and we just reminisced.&nbsp; Talked with quigs and mac and about how sad it was lol.&nbsp; Dropped hil and col off and then cried in the car b/c it felt like i was supposed to be going to the prom but i wasn't allowed for some reason.&nbsp; then it felt like me and tommy broke up an dhe was taking someone else to his prom. i know...it's sad but it was just a depressing nite. no studying got done but i did my research paper saturday.</P>
<P>went to 5:30 mass to see my lil sister serve for the first time, ate dinner and then went to see ""Fever Pitch"" with tommy. hung out at my house and then i went to bed and worked today 8-4:40 and only had a 5 minute break to inhale my tuna because film wasn't done and no one else was&nbsp;coming in to cover me and i wasn't even supposed to be there lol.</P>
<P>Well my diet as been somewhat successful.&nbsp; I lost 7 pounds in 5 days and basically kept that off and lost a few more.&nbsp; I still want to lose another 4-9 pounds depending on what i feel like at the time. lol.&nbsp; I was real strict in the beginning and now i'm eating like i'm just on the 2nd phase of the diet so starting tomorrow i'm back on phase one to lose the weight all next week. It's gonna be hard tho b/c i'm gonna wanna snack when i'm studying. o well, i have to be strong for summer and for myself!&nbsp; Wish me luck :-)</P>

Watched Halloween 4 and watching scary movies with tommy makes them not scary b/c he makes them funny which came in handy with amanda lol.&nbsp;</P>
<P>Saturday i read all morning for english and then went with tommy to meet up with kyle and his mom at Dicarlo's for them to be fitted for a tux for prendie's senior prom on friday.&nbsp; Went home and chilled with the fam for awhile! i had to finish reading for english and 2 more books for western civ so i was making tommy and kyle leave but they insisted on staying so i went upstairs and read so i could see tommy that nite.&nbsp; they left a half an hour later lol.&nbsp; Had dinner and then went to tommy's and&nbsp;watched Mr. 3000.&nbsp; </P>

<P>Saturday- woke up @ 6, got a shower, got dressed and finished packing and then tommy picked me up @ 7:30 to meet at his house so we could follow his mom and the crew.&nbsp; Left there @ 8 and we were on our way to the shore! :-)&nbsp; The road trip was awesome with great music, great weather and all of this with my baby! Got to delaware around 10:15 including a rest stop.&nbsp; I got a 50 cent tour of the house by debbie and then we brought all our stuff in from the car. Drove the golf cart for about a total of 2 minutes before it died. lol. hung out and watched some tv and then had lunch.&nbsp; Went to rehoboth beach and walked the boardwalk and stopped in some warm shops- friggin freezing because of the 100 mph winds lol.&nbsp;encountered Raab from &nbsp;Viva la Bam because he was behind in line for boardwalk fries. haha. Went to duey and walked the dock...thanks tommy for making sure i didn't fall in lol :-)&nbsp; Then went to the liquor store and bought some beer and smirnoff twisted for late that nite.&nbsp; Went home, watched some more tv, layed down and tried to take naps and then got ready for that nite.&nbsp; Went to the roadhouse for dinner, tommy and i waited in the&nbsp;car for 25 minutes while everyone else waited inside to be called and just chatted and then we ate and&nbsp;we took 5 boxes of leftovers home lol. Went to blockbuster and got Shaun of the dead and Blue collar comedy tour rides again.&nbsp; Watched about 10 minutes of the shaun of the dead- stupid and brought some drinks into tommy's room and watched big daddy.&nbsp; Then some viva la bam.&nbsp; Hit the sack around 1.&nbsp; Tommy and i planned on sleeping together on the floor but during the nite i was freezing and couldn't get comfortable so i got 2 blankets and slept on the couch.&nbsp; I woke up to Mrs. August and tomy staring at me wondering how i got on the couch. lol. </P>
<P>Sunday - woke up and made my baby scrambled eggs and taught him to do it himself for another time.&nbsp; Well before i even began cooking them the pan was on the burner and mrs. august said it was a cheap pan and that i would burn the eggs so she took it off the stove and i got another one. well as soon as she did that the fire alarms started to go off. People were asleep but tommy insisted on yelling FIRE!!!!&nbsp; downey never even got up lol.....i thought i was a heavy sleeper lol.&nbsp; Finished making ""eggs that were the shit"" and cleaned up.&nbsp; Tommy took me around in the golf cart @ 10 in the morning and since i was still in my pajamas and it was gonna be chilly riding around he wrapped me in his ninja turtles sleeping bag haha. Visited his friend michael, yes in my pj's and then went back to the house about an hour later. Got changed and what not and then tommy took me around and showed me the town.&nbsp; Saw ginormous houses in the golf course and then took lots of pics of them lol.&nbsp; Visited their private beach and then had some pizza.&nbsp; Everyone else left early since downey had to work so after they left we just hung around :-) and then went to the outlet stores and did some shopping.&nbsp; Old navy sales are GOD!!! lol.&nbsp; Tommy got his tools and then we left.&nbsp; Hit Lewes and walked the dock, saw all the boats, ate dinner at ""irish Eyes"" outside and then headed home.&nbsp; It was soo romantic i felt like we were married. Drove home, hit CVS, stopped at his house and then dropped me off and we shared all the stories with my fam about the amazing weekend!!</P>
<P>This weekend was absolutely amazing and i have never felt closer with tommy or his family.&nbsp; i think love them more than my own family.&nbsp; There was never a dull moment and i cannot wait til we can get a house of our own there. :-)&nbsp; I love you sooo much tommy and thank you for the best weekend EVER!! i can't wait til the summer so i can practically live there! :-)</P>

I have found who i like being with and i feel like i belong.&nbsp; I love my monday lunches with Katie and kate( would have been mike too but noooooo he's too cool for us...well we don't need you b/c it's better with just us girls anyway. haha.)&nbsp; I have found a new best friend in Katie...don't worry tommy, you're still my BESTEST friend EvEr!!&nbsp; Hopefully i will get the classes i want next semester and it will be great. :-)&nbsp; My relationship with tommy couldn't be better and this weekend is gonna be the best cause we're going down the shore for debbie's prom !&nbsp; Tommy, i can't wait to wake up next to YOU!!! i love you soo much !!</P>
<P>Work is ok but when i get some free time i want to apply for a job at the media courthourse like someone i know did last year.&nbsp; She is the same major as me and all she did was tell them her major and they put her in an office and then they recommended her to a private investigator's office where she will get her summer internship and then hopefully a career.&nbsp; Maybe if it works out like she plans, if she wants to continue with grad school after college they will pay for it.&nbsp; I hope it will be as simply laid out as that because i want o start a serious life after college- no messing around. :-)</P>
<P>Well i guess that's all i have to say rite now...i just thought that since i was bored i would update for all you avid readers out there :-)&nbsp; ok bye.</P>"

"event","<P>Alrite, with this whole Dave concert thing,&nbsp; i'm a little confused!!!&nbsp; What makes people more special than others to go the second nite?&nbsp; I know some people have plans on the 5th and the only way to go is to go on the 6th...now they are forced to buy their own tickets and go with others because they aren't ""special"" enough to go on the 6th!!!!&nbsp; What makes a person more a fan than someone else??&nbsp; i personally know someone is doesn't know all the words to EVERY song and they are both going the second nite!!&nbsp;&nbsp; Ok, I'm not saying that i know every word either, but i know a decent amount and i believe i have every bit of an equal chance to go the second nite as anyone else.&nbsp; I'm not even going the second nite because i want to go the first where everyone will be there and not just the select few.- i'm just making a point that needs to be made.&nbsp; I just want to go and have a good time and enjoy the music i like listening to!! Is that a crime?!?!&nbsp; I THINK NOT!!!!&nbsp; I made my case and i know i'm gonna be getting shit for it but at this point i know i'm not the only one who feels this way!</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>*** Hmm....starting my own group sounds like fun!</P>"

"event","<P>I'm gonna try and make this as short and sweet as possible.&nbsp; Spring Break was good but not long enough :-(&nbsp; My sister ended up going on retreat and meg brooks went with her in case she needed to take a nap or what not since meg had the same speech and stuff this year.&nbsp; So that really helped.&nbsp; Since I wasn't gonna use the school gym, I went with tommy to the Y and worked out instead.&nbsp; Saw Fr. Large and Mr. Penot there....kinda weird. lol.&nbsp; Monday&nbsp;me and tommy&nbsp;played tennis and i got my butt kicked :-(&nbsp; THAT really kicked me in the ass the next day : i found out that you literally use EVERY muscle in your body when you play that sport haha.&nbsp; Went home after i lost because tommy had class and then i drove my mom to the car dealership to pick up her car.&nbsp; Ate dinner and got a shower and then picked up tommy and went to best buy to try and get another phone since mine broke in two pieces.- NOTHING.&nbsp; Cingular women are bitches at the cingular store on baltimore pike- just a warning.&nbsp; Went to Tommy's house and hung out in the kitchen with debbie.&nbsp; Never a dull moment.&nbsp; A little hissy fit between tommy against me, debbie, and mama august.&nbsp; It WAS serious later but we're fine now- thank god.&nbsp; Because I don't know what i would do without him in my life!!&nbsp; I love you Tommy!!</P>
<P>Tuesday- went with my mom to bring stuff up to prendie for michele to take on retreat.&nbsp; Then just hung out all day.&nbsp; Mrs. August took me and Tommy to Philly to give us a run of where we would be going for his dance on friday.&nbsp; Got lost but it was all good.&nbsp; Got delicious dinner and saw tommy's old house.&nbsp; Tommy came back to my house and watched Fast and the Furious.&nbsp; I took some nyquil pills to stop the sore throat i was beginning to get but fell asleep during Too Fast Too Furious.&nbsp; I went to bed while tommy and my brother finished the movie. It was kinda weird going to bed while my boyfriend stayed. lol.&nbsp; He left around 12.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Wednesday we went to the gym again but before that we visited his mom and her kids at the daycare- way too cute :-)&nbsp; Had fun with them in the gym and then we worked out.&nbsp; Helped them with pine cones, peanut butter and bird seed.&nbsp; God i love those kids!!&nbsp; Work 2-10.&nbsp; Thursday- work 12-8. pick up contacts at mall.</P>
<P>Friday- wake up go to bank get eyebrows waxed.&nbsp; Hung out ALL day and watched movies and then got my hair done @ 3.&nbsp; Ate a slice of pizza, got ready for dance.&nbsp; My&nbsp; mom mom , grandmom and grandpop came over around 5:30 followed by tommy and his parents.&nbsp; Got some pics and left around 6ish.&nbsp; This ballroom was absolutely gorgeous!!!&nbsp; Change of plans for my wedding. lol.&nbsp; We would have danced more if they played more than an hour of white music haha.&nbsp; But when they did play that music we had a blast.&nbsp; ALl of his friends are awesome and super nice.&nbsp; The bar was cool when they didn't card anyone but later on they started. damn it. lol.&nbsp; </P>
<P>So now i'm procrastinating on an english paper that is due wed.&nbsp; So i should be getting to it.&nbsp; later..</P>"

<P>So Spring Break is a little boring rite now.&nbsp; I went to see Grease on Friday- Awesome!!!&nbsp; I felt real bad b/c they forgot to put my sister's senior portrait in there, but&nbsp; believe me they have made up for it lol. Saturday me and tommy went to the gym and then that nite I stayed in because tommy was in the pit for the play and i was just exhausted from nothing.&nbsp; My mom had to pick michele up at 7:30 even before the play started because she was having severe back pains and she was having trouble breathing. So my mom took her to the taylor Hospital ER- bad idea.&nbsp; They got there around 8 and they didn't get home until 2:45 AM.&nbsp; They found out her potassium is very low and she has pnemonia.&nbsp; She so achey she can barely move and she hasn't eaten anything except for some crackers so she can take her medicine.&nbsp; She may not even be able to lead retreat tomorrow. My mom called Fr. jason and she may just go up on thurs to do her speech or go and leave when she pleases.&nbsp; It's up to her and we're just seeing if she begins to eat.&nbsp; And then my other sister has the flu so the entire Rec room is basically a hospital lol.&nbsp; I switched my sunday shift for wed. nite so i could run errands while my mom and sister went to the mother daughter brunch but they never went so i sat in all day watching sick people :-(</P>
<P>Last nite i went to Tommy's house and watched Friday Night Lights- good movie but Tim McGraw is an asshole in it.&nbsp; Today i have an eye doctor's appt and then me and tommy are hitting the gym again before he leaves for class @ 3. I only have 4 more days to lose a couple more pounds. Woo-Hoo!! I'm going strong! Ok, i'm going now.......later.<BR><BR></P>"

"event","<P>I don't think I can put into words how excited I am for Spring Break even tho i'm not going anywhere. lol.&nbsp; I had another mental breakdown yesterday at work because I was thinking about everything that i had to do for tomorrow and then the idea of me failing my spanish test yesterday kept haunting me.&nbsp; I ended up e-mailing my teacher today letting him know how bad i did on the first part (the second part is tomorrow) and asked if i could do extra credit or come to him for help.&nbsp; I've done exceptionally well on the presentations and papers but I'm afraid of failing.&nbsp; I know the first test that i got an F on was only 5% of my grade, but still.&nbsp; Hopefully I won't fail this course and have to take it again next semester!! That would be sheer hell!!</P>
<P>Even though I felt like crap last nite at work, Marissa really helped me.&nbsp; And then helping Michelle finish the cough and cold aisle was hell but we made it awesome by singing to the music : Britney Spears, Billy Joel, Elton John, Shania Twain, and Build me Up Buttercup.&nbsp; My cheeks were hurting because we were laughing so hard.&nbsp; Then after work i went ot pick michele up from bonner and i got to see tommy :-)&nbsp; And now that I've contacted my spanish teacher, all my worries are gone except for the fact that I have to finish the damn exam tomorrow. :-(&nbsp; o well...</P>
<P>So tonight is my sister Amanda's Confirmation and I'm her sponsor.&nbsp; I'm excited now because Marissa is her brother's sponsor so she will be there too, so if i mess up so does she because neith one of us know what we're supposed to do haha.&nbsp; Then me and my family is going to some new italian restaurant after :-)&nbsp; </P>
<P>I'm feeling much better about myself and I didn't even get any diet tips from anyone (grr..... nah i'm j/k)&nbsp; Yesterday for breakfast i had my nutrigrain cereal bar, for lunch i had this big fruit container and then an apple wih peanut butter, for dinner ravioli.&nbsp; I had no snacks in between meals and all i drank was water.&nbsp; I weighed myself this morning and i lost 1.5 pounds in&nbsp;2 days! :-)&nbsp; Hopefully that total will be 5-7lbs by next friday.&nbsp; I realy think i can do it becuase now i have a plan where i don't get hungry between meals.&nbsp; And since next week i'm on spring break, tommy is gonna use his guest passes and take me to the Y 3 times before the dance :-)&nbsp; God I love you Tommy! haha.</P>
<P>Well i'm gonna go now and study for my math exam and the rest of my spanish. Wish me luck...I need it! O wait....Math is open book so there is no studying, just hiliting. Yippee!!!&nbsp;&nbsp; later...</P>"

"event","Okay, I feel like crap: i've gained a couple of pounds since senior prom so now i don't feel as comfortable wearing the dress for tommy's formal next friday. I can usually lose weight quick but lately it's just been staying on me even after i go to the gym.  I guess i just don't have the will power to try hard enough but it's really upsetting me :-(  So if anyone has any quick weight loss tips, now would be a good time to share them with me...PLEASE!!!

Then since i'm my sister's sponsor for confirmation i feel i have to buy her a gift but i can't afford it. I have to wait to get paid on thurs so i can pay my cell phone bill and then i will have about 30 bucks left to last me a week.  I hate being poor :-(  O shit i forgot i have to get a manicure and my hair done next friday!

Now i'm still trying to memorize steps in spanish to a recipe and i'm making it rite now.  I just needed a break before i killed someone with the knife. lol. (not really).  I just can't wait to spring break so i don't have to worry about due dates and all that crap.  i will be free!!!!

So don't forget, any weight loss tips, please tell me!! You can even text me them: 610-506-2339..i'm desperate!!!"

Don't worrry i'm not gonna give you a day to day recount of everything that&nbsp; has happened since i last wrote. lol. But here's a quick recap.</P>
<P>So I'm really feeling like a NEW me!&nbsp; New semester, great classes, great teachers, less stressed, kept same great friends and made new ones, and i just feel healthy all around!&nbsp; I've been eating healthier and going to the gym 2-3 times a week and it's really been helping me.&nbsp; I don't feel so guilty now when i cheat once in a while because i think the gym has boosted my metabolism :-)&nbsp; My classes are great!&nbsp; My teachers are GREAT!! my english teacher is the same one i had last semester and I love him!&nbsp; My math teacher looks like danny tanner and talks like joey gladstone doing impressions. lol.&nbsp; I'm just waiting for the rest of the cast of Full House to come in one day lol.&nbsp; It's so cute though because he has 2 daughters and they help mark our tests and quizzes so we get little stickers all the time. He just loves them so much and it's so cute :-)&nbsp; My history teacher looks like he's 12 with bags under his eyes....i hate history in general but he's a good teacher.&nbsp; Psychology i have with dave mcfadden and the teacher i a lil fruity and fat and sounds like he has a permanent cold lol.&nbsp; What's even better about that class is that i got a 92 on the test and Dave, i'm still smarter than you even if you got a 98 :-)&nbsp; I can honestly say that i LOVE my spanish class!! Great group of friends in the corner and the teacher is awesome!&nbsp; I'm less stressed because i'm off thursdays which means i work these days and sundays so i have time to do school work and work doesn't get it in the way.&nbsp; I have all my afternoons free so this is a great stress relief factor!!</P>
<P>AHHH!! I'm so excited because Cabrini has formal and me and Tommy are going!!&nbsp; This is even more exciting because tommy and i never went to a dance together and this is our first one ! :-)&nbsp; It's March 11 and my countdowns have started. (hah hilary!)&nbsp; </P>
<P>Well i guess this is all i had to say but if i think of anything else i wil be back :-)&nbsp; later...</P>"

"event","<P>I have to start off by saying that this must have&nbsp;been the best New Year's of my life!! I got to spend it with the Love Of My Life and his family and then my family.&nbsp; I am so fortunate to have these people in my life!! They are truly the meaning of my life and I wouldn't be able to go on without any of them! :-)</P>
<P>So on New Year's Eve I helped my mom around the house all day and did last minute stops to stores to pick up food and then cleaned my room and what not. Then I started to curl my hair b/c i wanted to be a little dressed up for the party lol.&nbsp; And another reason is because i needed an excuse to stop doing chores haha.&nbsp; Then Tommy picked me up around 5:30 and we went to his grandmom's house and Father Esposito said New Year's Eve Mass.&nbsp; Stayed there until about 7:30 and then headed back to my house for the beginning of our party.&nbsp; We ate and played some air hockey where i beat Mr. Ed 10-7. Woo-Hoo!!!!&nbsp; Watched my uncle lose 5 bucks to my brother.&nbsp; Dave stopped by so he could go with me and tommy back to tommy's grandmom's house later on.&nbsp; Bradz stopped by and we all just kinda hung out.&nbsp; Left around 10:15, 10:30 ish and went back to Big Toot's house.&nbsp; They had a juke box johnny and all the furniture was cleared so we were dancing the whole night through.&nbsp; Mrs. August was bringing me drinks all night long and by the end of the night, me, tommy, debbie, and lindsey were past tipsy.&nbsp; ""You know Debbie's trashed when she sings and she sux."" haha.&nbsp; I got flashed a few times by tommy's aunt (Jerry Scanlan's mom) and was told by her that it was my job to hold her up.&nbsp; Wow, what an experience lol.&nbsp; Broke the seal - not good but it sobered me up along with bread haha.&nbsp; Mrs. August drove me home around 2:00 and got home a lil after that.&nbsp; Awesomenite and i slept like a baby!!</P>
<P>New Year's Day i woke up around 8:30 and then i was picked up by Mrs. August, Dave, tommy, lindsey, debbie and allison to go to the parade in philly.&nbsp;Mrs. August felt her job was done when all of us woke up with cotton mouths and headaches. haha. The day started off by us seeing a thong on a black girl-not a pretty sight. lol..&nbsp; Then we met drunken Skip who wore an ""Alcoholics"" hat.&nbsp; Yea Mrs. August, just say Thank you and Happy New Year. Whatever happened to that motto? lol.&nbsp; She was such a hypocrite but i love her. lol.&nbsp; Left there around 3 and headed home.&nbsp; Fell asleep on tommy on the&nbsp;couch watching&nbsp;the parade on tv. (like we hadn't seen enough :-))&nbsp; Tommy got changed and cleaned up and left around 4:20, went&nbsp;to my house, i got cleaned up and then we went to my mom mom's house for dinner.&nbsp; Watched more of the parade and just chilled with the&nbsp;fam&nbsp;:-)&nbsp; After dinner,&nbsp;tommy took me amanda and jimmy to his houes to pick up the aladdin dvd and we went&nbsp;to my house and watched&nbsp;it after tommy beat amanda in air hockey.&nbsp; He&nbsp;went home around 11?&nbsp; </P>
<P>Sunday i went to 10 o'&nbsp;clock mass, updated my picture album online and started a calendar for my mom on microsoft word that&nbsp;she's been nagging me about.&nbsp; Left around 1:15 for my cousins' house in Delaware and we all ate christmas cookies, ordered pizza, and just caught up since we&nbsp;haven't really spent time together.&nbsp; Left around 6:15 and got home around 7.&nbsp; Went to&nbsp;Sam's house and went to blockbuster with her,&nbsp;alexis, gamble, and dev and we rented ""When Harry Met Sally""- Aweseom movie!! Chick flick but&nbsp;romantic comedy and recommended for everyone! :-)&nbsp;&nbsp;Stopped by Wawa and then back to sam's house.&nbsp; Made myself leave&nbsp;around 10 so i could get a decent amount of sleep.&nbsp; &nbsp;</P>
<P>Monday i woke up about 9:30- it was grand.&nbsp; Finished my mom's stupid calendar and then around 11:30 i started getting ready for out 7:32 reunion :-)&nbsp; Picked sam and dana up at sam's house around 1:15 and headed for kelly kirk's house.&nbsp; Ate alot and just talked about college. Fun times but we left about 2:45?&nbsp; dropped them off and then went home.&nbsp; Tommy and i decided to see Meet the Fockers at 4:30 b/c i didn't feel like going out late since i had work @ 8 the next morning.&nbsp; Came to my house @ 4 and headed for the movies.&nbsp; Very funny movie but it was a little iffy about the whole PG-13 thing. ehhh.....&nbsp; Went back to his house and watched Blue Collar Comedy Tour- Hysterical!! I've never seen any of them before and i almost wet myself haha.&nbsp; ""Started to leave"" around 9 and i got home about 9:30 ish lol.&nbsp; God i love his porch.&nbsp; :-)&nbsp; </P>
<P>today I worked 8-4 :-(&nbsp; I'm too exhausted to do anything tonite so me and tommy have agreed just to stay in and to not see each other for one day lol.&nbsp; So i'll prob end up watching movies with my dad since he's been tired from his muscle relaxers and then i have to work tomorrow nite :-(&nbsp; So i'll update later....</P>
<P>P.S.-&nbsp; Tommy August is the Love Of My Life and I couldn't go on without him!! He is the man of my dreams- my night in shining armor! I am truly madly deeply in love with him!!&nbsp; </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; i hope that was tommy friendly enough :-)</P>"

I found out later that Mr. August got Mrs. August the same braclet but it was yellow gold.&nbsp; They have good taste b/c they didn't know they bought the same one. lol.&nbsp; Then i went to 5:30 mass with my family and then stopped in @ my Aunt Mary Kay's house for her first annual Christmas Eve dinner.&nbsp; I left as soon as i had&nbsp;a bite to eat so i can go to tommy's aunt's house.&nbsp; Unfortunately i missed all my cousins and everyone that came after i left. :-(&nbsp; So I left there around 7:30 and headed to see my Tommy :-)&nbsp; I was greeted with lots of yells and everyone laughing at Christmas vacation for the thousandth time lol.&nbsp; Tommy was getting wasted so that he would be calmed down when his turn came to open his presents b/c he hates being the center of attention.&nbsp;&nbsp; So after he was done opening his gifts, me and him went over to the tree and picked a snowflake off, looked at the number on the back and then went over to his grandmom and she gave us a stocking with a gift card in it.&nbsp; We both got Friendly's gift cards!! Woo-Hoo!!! cause we're poor but we love to go out haha.&nbsp; So around 10:45 I left becuase i still had gifts to wrap.&nbsp; But of course as soon as i get in my mom needs me to go on a celery hunt for her stuffing.&nbsp; So michele and i went to 2 acme's, a pathmark and 3 wawa's but everything was closed. :-(&nbsp; Then i went to bed.</P>
<P>Christmas morning:&nbsp; I got my long awaited digital camera!!!&nbsp; God i love this thing.&nbsp; Michele and i got the samw one and then my mom got one from my dad b/c she's been using my dad's and he wants his back lol.&nbsp; Got the Friends' purse from michele, gift cards, perfume, shoes, the usual. But i loved everything!! Every year me and my brother and sisters get one big combined gift from our parents. This year we got an air hockey table for the game room down the basement.&nbsp; O YEA!!! this thing is friggin awesome!! We actually got it a couple days b4 Christmas because they couldn't hide it anywhere.&nbsp; The nite we got it tommy came over and we played all nite.&nbsp; The entire rite side of my body was aching all week!! haha.&nbsp; For lunch on Christmas, my mom's side of he fam came over and enjoyed turkey, stuffing, cole slaw, pumpkin pie, and lote of christmas cookies.&nbsp; Then tommy and bradz came over and surprised me and michele....awww how cute!!!&nbsp; Then after everyone left we went to my mom mom's house for dinner.&nbsp; It was very depressing b/c she didn't ave a turkey or a tree :-(&nbsp; Opened presents and then the biggest heartbreak of all was that santa didn't come like he does evey year.&nbsp; All my uncle did was hand out the presents that santa WOULD have given out :-(&nbsp; it was sooo sad.&nbsp; The funniest thing of the nite tho was that my uncle had this farting machine and my dad was holding the remote and my uncle had the speaker and my mom mom didn't find out til desert that it&nbsp;was a machine.&nbsp; She was getting mad and actually making my uncle danny leave the table haha.</P>
<P>Sunday my aunt and cousins from virginia came for Father Chuck ( cousin)'s viewing at the cathedral.&nbsp; Very sad.&nbsp; then we went back to my mom mom's house for food and what not.&nbsp; There was more people there then and it was more fun than christmas was. - go figure.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Monday was the funeral and we had to be at the cathedral very early.&nbsp; It was bitter cold and we had to stand in the cold forever.&nbsp; The cathedral was PACKED.&nbsp; Even Mrs. Paffett was there. lol.&nbsp; Then went to the&nbsp; cemetery, said our good byes to Father chuck.&nbsp; Drexelbrook for lunch but it was so weird b/c chuck wasn't there to say prayer :-(&nbsp;&nbsp;Then went home to get changed and then headed back over mom mom's house for more food and fun.&nbsp; Played with my cousin allyson forver and got lots of pics with the new camera. lol&nbsp; My uncle bill discovered the fart machine and had lots of fun with that.&nbsp; Went home and watched Elf with the cousins.&nbsp; Went to bed. </P>
<P>Tuesday michele and i went to the mall and spent our gift cards and what not.&nbsp; Work 4-10</P>
<P>Wednesday worked 8-4 because 3 people called out.&nbsp; Took amanda's to border's and then came home and got ready for tommy.&nbsp; Tommy came and we went to blockbuster then to his cousin's house for debbie's party.&nbsp; picked up pizza and then headed home around 830 and we watched manchurian candidate- very confusing.&nbsp; Fell asleep on tommy while him and my dad watched the rest of the movie.</P>
<P>Today i have nothing planned.&nbsp; Maybe take my brother to modells' i dunno. But as soon as my baby is done work i get to see him!!! Woo-Hoo!!!&nbsp; We are sooo spoiled..i don't know what we're gonna do this summer haha.&nbsp; no i don't want to think about that :-(&nbsp; Ok well gott go....</P>"

<P>Saturday: I did nothign in the morning and then around 3 i went with the fam to pick out a christmas tree.&nbsp; Came home and watched Christmas Vacation and then Tommy picked me up around 5:15 and we went to his cousins house for his god-daughter's birthday party.&nbsp; Watched football, just chilled, sang to corrine, she opened presents, and then we left to go to dinner @ Sam's Saloon for out 6 month anniversary :-)&nbsp; Delicious food and then went back to his house and watched Rudoloph the red Nosed Reindeer. haha.&nbsp; Dropped me off at home around 11:30 and we were fascinated with amanda and jimmy watching the 1997 christmas tape- def black mail. lol.</P>
<P>Sunday : Me and michele went to 10 o'clock mass and then came home to watch Christmas vacation b/c we were both bored and she was procrastinating with homework.&nbsp; Around 1:30 we had to go over to the Norwood Firehouse for their annual Christmas party :-(&nbsp; We ate and then left.&nbsp; Work 4-10.</P>
<P>Monday:&nbsp; Wake up around 9. My mom and I go shopping and she buys me an outfit and she finishes her shopping.&nbsp; Get home around 12 and we wrap gifts.&nbsp; Tommy comes over around 1:30ish and we watch Christmas vacation haha.

<P>Tuesday: Spanish Final. got there a lil early so i met mary colleen and angela, kelly and sarah at the caf and we just complained about these finals and how bad everyone just wanted to go home.&nbsp; Took the test and then i stopped by tommy's house.&nbsp; Took some cookies home for my dad since he wanted an order since there was none left when he got home the night before lol.&nbsp; Went home and was bored out of my mind.&nbsp; Talked to sam for a bit and then i called hilary and then we went to the granite run mall to start her christmas shopping. I was already out so i picked her up around 545 and we were on the road by 6. Major traffic so got there around 6:40.&nbsp; Got what we needed and left.&nbsp;- good times and good talks with my right hand :-)&nbsp; Went home and watched Mystic River.&nbsp; Talked to ed for about 3 minutes, made an errand for my mom and then finished the movie - AWESOME movie i highly recommend it.</P>

"event","<P>I absolutely HATE feeling like this!! I don't know if I'm feeling extra worse and making things harder than they really are because ""my friend"" decided to pay me a visit or what but i don't like it.&nbsp; I feel trapped!! I feel like what i'm doing rite now is what i'll be doing for the rest of my life.&nbsp; I hate change but I could really go for some right now.&nbsp; And i know a certain someone is going to get offended by that but right now I need to let off some steam b4 i explode @ the wrong people!</P>
<P>I want to keep that friends I made here @ school but it's gonna be hard not having classes with them next year and especially not living @ school.&nbsp; I've already had this conversation with my dad but he doesn't want me to live anywhere else but home rite now b/c he would miss me. Boo Hoo!! Get over it! - you can't keep me under your wing forever! I need to live outside of my house- literally!&nbsp; It also won't work with me living @ school b/c if i'm gone for the school year, Tommy's gone for the summer.&nbsp; The thing is, we're so spoiled rite now w/seeing each other almost every day, that talking about seeing each other every other weekend and on breaks is just killer.&nbsp; But he could visit me ya know?&nbsp; If we really wanted to stay together, we could make it work.&nbsp; he goes away for the summer but you don't see me giving him crap for it or making him feel guilty for going.&nbsp; Grrr.... and i'm not even going away to school next year!!&nbsp; I already broke the news to katie and we're pretty upset :-(</P>
<P>I mean rite now my weekends consist of working and hanging out with Tommy.&nbsp; Don't get me wrong, i love being with MY tommy but i want to hang out with my friends but they're all at school (St. Joe's).&nbsp; yes, i could simply go here but then i feel guilty for not being with Tommy.&nbsp; I feel lost when i'm not @ school with katie, thom, tom and the rest of the crew.&nbsp; I'm just scared that if someday- not saying it will happen, but if someday me and tommy break up, i'm not gonna have any friends b/c i didn't attempt to keep any of them.&nbsp; Yea, i know i'll have the select few but what if @ me and Tommy's wedding I only have family in the ceremony and no friends? - that's sad and pathetic!! :-(</P>
<P>I just think I need help.&nbsp; What i really need is for finals to be over and Christmas break to be here and never end!!&nbsp; I hate finals especially philosophy and every fuckin philosopher that was ever created!!&nbsp; They need to get lives and stop thinking about identity, memory and all that shit!!&nbsp; ""If they were thinking, they wouldn't have thought that!""&nbsp; Maybe watching the Sandlot will cheer me up - Prob not b/c all i would be thinking about is me not studying 4 philosophy and how bad i'm gonna fail.&nbsp; Speakin gof failing, that's what i'm gonna do tomorrow b/c i've attempted studying and it's too complicated so i'm just gonnaa wing up some answers and match random quotes with random philosophers and make up explanations for the quotes - hmmm...sounds better than studying to me.</P>"

"event","<P>So i woke up this morning with MAJOR cramps and ANOTHER migraine.&nbsp; Migraines must really love me because they haven't wanted to leave me since the accident. lol.&nbsp; I loaded up on Advil and just prayed for relief and i'm finally getting some.&nbsp; I was supposed to go to school this morning for a review session on philosophy with some kids and the teacher, but i wasn't able to get out of the fetal position this morning.&nbsp; I figured: the teacher confuses me more when she tries to explain shit to me so i might as well just study everything myself and pull things out of my ass tomorrow.&nbsp; The final is on matching quotes with the correct philosopher and then explaining the quote but it doesn't help if u don't know them lol.&nbsp; So now i'm gonna be leaving around 1215 to have lunch with Katie and then head over for our english final :-(&nbsp; I memorized all the questions and answers but i just have a fear of blanking out. o well....</P>
<P>Then when i come home i have to pick up my paycheck, go to the bank and then head ""somewhere"" to pick up a Christmas present that i ordered.&nbsp; Hopefully Michele won't have to work so she can tag along.&nbsp; Then i'll come home and cram for philosophy and then MAYBE watch ER, depending on the progress of my studying. </P>
<P>Today is a week since the accident and i find out that the damages exceed $5000.&nbsp; Yes, thats rite, five thousand dollars!!!!&nbsp; They didn't mention the $1000 deductable so hopefully they forget and then i won't have to pay it. :- /&nbsp; I can't wait til all this christmas shopping si done so i can start paying off debts and bills and what not- it's just horrible.&nbsp; So ummm....later...</P>"

"event","<P><STRONG>Finals are just so frustrating!&nbsp; Today I had my sociology final and i studied for what seemed forver and a day yesterday.&nbsp; I read every reading and lecture that was required and went over the worksheets for the videos with Bill Cosby and Chris Rock. lol.&nbsp; Thank God it wasn't cumulative because that would have kicked my ass!!&nbsp; Speaking of getting my ass kicked, I'm gonna bomb my philosoophy on Friday considering all we had was 3 take home essays.&nbsp; She e-mailed us and let us know that we can meet with her tomorrow and go over some of the philosophers since we all have questions on them but it 's just gonna confuse me more so i dunno.&nbsp; The whole final is just her giving us quotes and us identifying and explaing them.&nbsp; But it's gonna suck when no one pays an ounce of attention in her class.&nbsp; </STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Another thing that sucks is that since i commute, all the friends that i made this semester are gonna disappear after i get new classes :-(&nbsp; I don't live there to have the same suite mates and all.&nbsp; I have a couple of the same classes with some of the guys but that's only because we have the same major : criminal justice.&nbsp; Katie...if ur reading this, I'm gonna miss you and I hope i'll get to see you when i'm leaving kullman's class and ur going in. lol.&nbsp; </STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>I just can't wait til Christmas break!!!&nbsp; Knowing that i won't have anything due over break takes a HUGE weight off my shoulders and just lets me relax :-)&nbsp; A month is so long compared to high school, but i could use 2 months. lol.&nbsp;&nbsp; </STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Tomorrow i might go in early to meet with a group for philosophy and then i have my english final 2-4.&nbsp; Then i'll come home and study for philosophy...maybe. lol.&nbsp; Tonight i'm going back to school to get together with peeps and study for english since he gave us the 5 questions and the answers and now we have to put it in essay form, and memorize it without any grammatical errors.&nbsp; SOUNDS easy.&nbsp; </STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>I'm kinda bummed because on Friday, Tommy's family is doing the seven fishes thing and i can't go for the killin gof the eel.&nbsp; I really wanted to go and be a part of it but tommy told me that it's friday and of course i'm working 4-12 :-(&nbsp; Yes, i need money but i really wanted to go.&nbsp; I can't even swtich shifts with&nbsp; someone b/c i have finals and then sat. i'm going out for me and tommy's&nbsp; 6 month :-)&nbsp; Well i&nbsp; guess i'm gonna go and bullshit til i have to go back to school.&nbsp; later...</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT size=4>P.S.&nbsp; I'm done my Christmas shopping !! Woo-Hoo!! YAY!!!</FONT></STRONG></P>"

"event","<P>This is gonna be a short update and a small outburst may occur. (just a precaution lol).</P>
<P>Friday, like i said, i came home early and then went to work.&nbsp; I've never hated truck nite more in my entire life than i did on&nbsp; Friday nite. I kept having recurring migraines and i seriously wanted to cry- it was just horrible.&nbsp; Truck was finished early so my manager let me leave about a half hour early - better than nothing.&nbsp; Then i stopped by Tommy's to show him my rental and then i went home to bed.</P>
<P>Saturday i was off and i worked on my Sociology paper that is due today.&nbsp; Then i took michele to CVS to get the red-eye out of the one pic of her and bradz from the dance and then i took her to work.&nbsp; I just felt so bad driving her b/c i can understand if she never wanted to get in a car with me again.&nbsp; Thank god she's being really calm about it but i do have to watch when i drive over bumps b/c her neck sometimes bothers her. :-(&nbsp; My mom took me to the mall to look for a christmas outfit but all we found were pants Love them tho b/c there red pin striped pants with black lace on the side.&nbsp; Went to 5:30 mass, ate dinner and then tommy came over.&nbsp; We went to Blockbuster, rented ""The Terminal"" and just crashed at my house.&nbsp; Made lunch plans with amanda for tues. haha tommy :-)&nbsp; </P>
<P>Sunday i worked 9-5.&nbsp; Came home for money, me and michele went to mandees and i found a red shirt for christmas. before mandess we stopped by tommy's to drop off his cabrini hoodie that he let jimmy borrow for college day at school.&nbsp; Tommy informed me that on sat, since it's our 6 month, he's taking me out to dinner at Sam's Saloon- YAY!!!&nbsp; Came home and had to get ready for Christmas pictures :-(&nbsp; Came out pretty good considering we did them at out house and my mom was the photographer lol.&nbsp; Called it an early nite and went to bed around 9:15 lol. </P>
<P>Now here's my outburst!...&nbsp; I fuckin hate how someone you thought was really good friends with you doesn't even react to the fact that i was in a bad car accident.&nbsp; I tell her and then she continues the conversation as if she never even heard me.&nbsp; And yes i know she heard me.&nbsp; Tommy wanted to kick her ass. lol.&nbsp; Even when i told Ali this morning when we were parking and she saw that i didn't have my car, she was so sympathetic and agreed that people HAVE changed- for the worse.&nbsp; It's just horrible.&nbsp; I hate how everyone changes once they leave for school.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; I'm just glad i know who my true friends are :-)</P>
<P>Today is my last day of class and we get cheese steaks in my sociology class while we go over what's on our final.&nbsp; WOo--Hoo!!&nbsp; Then i'm going home and working 4-12 :-(&nbsp; Studying for finals that are this week and hopefully and i don't bomb them. later...</P>"

"event","<P>Yesterday I was off because math was my only class and since i was happy with my grade i didn't have to take the final and yesterday was review.&nbsp; Anyway, i went up to cabrini and since it was tommy's break we went to the KOP mall and got some Christmas shopping done.&nbsp; Had lunch and then got really lost going back to cabrini :-(&nbsp; Went home, picked up my brother from the bus stop, took him home, went to work, picked up my paycheck, went to the bank, picked up michele from the trolley stop, went to sam's saloon to get a gift certificate and then it happened!!&nbsp; There was traffic at the end of south ave so i turned onto sylvan like i usually do and as i&nbsp; turn onto amosland in front of interboro school, a red car rams into me and me and michele spin.&nbsp; The car hit the door on the driver's side in the back and a part of my door.&nbsp; I tried to get out but the back door was overlapping my door.&nbsp; I couldn't help but cry and then michele called my mom.&nbsp; Cops and ambulances were there ungodly fast and then my mom and dad arrived on the scene.&nbsp; They put me and michele on a gurney and took us to the hospital b/c i hit my head and michele's neck was bothering her.&nbsp; They man in the other car was fine but the lady wasn't wearing her seatbelt and hit the windshield.&nbsp; My dad just held me and my sis b/c my crying was uncontrollable and i just kept apologizing and my dad was just telling me that it wasn't my fault- i couldn't see past the fence and then guy was going faster than 25 mph.&nbsp; We went to the hospital for a cat scan and what not and then about an hour and half later we were discharged.&nbsp; It made it that much easier and relazing knowing that i knew all of the ambulance crew.&nbsp; It just gave me a sense of relief.&nbsp; Tommy came over since he was a mess and then just had tuna sanswiches with the fam. lol.&nbsp; Then he took me to my friend's mom's viewing since i didn't have a ride and then took me home.&nbsp; </P>
<P>I'm just pretty much sore now. My neck, back and arm is stiff and my head is suffering from major migraines since i have a couple bumps and bruises on my head :-(&nbsp;&nbsp; I had my mom pick me up after my english class today b/c i felt like shit with the migraine and all and i couldn't concentrate with all the flashbacks running through my head. So i went home, had some soup, fell asleep and then went to work.&nbsp;&nbsp;But before work&nbsp;i had to pick up my rental car which is a 2005 Jeep Liberty.&nbsp; I'll have that for about a couple of weeks.&nbsp; I'm just scared about whose fault it was.&nbsp; If i'm to blame i'm going to court to fight it b/c i couldn't see him- it's not fair.&nbsp; Besides, my insurance will skyrocket and i don't want it to go on my record.&nbsp; I may even get a ticket for pulling out into traffic- not sure about that yet tho.&nbsp; After i get my baby back i may trade it in for an older SUV because i'm scared of little cars now.&nbsp; I feel much safer in this car then i did in my civic. My mom and i are gonna check out prices and stuff because if my insurance goes up then i'm gonna need a break on my car payments.&nbsp; So we'll see.&nbsp; Michele is at her winter formal rite now so i hope she's feeling ok.&nbsp; Well gotta go but wish me luck with all my problems with the whole situation.&nbsp; I have to somehow find $1000 b/c that's how much i have to pay and then the insurance is paying the rest of the damages :-(</P>"

"event","<P>The best part of this break was the fact that i was able to sleep a full 12 hours on Thursday nite.&nbsp; It was grand!!</P>
<P>Tuesday- I had my 10 o'clock math class which was supposed to be over @ 11:15 but he let us out @ 10:40 since peoplo ""were leaving for turkey."" -- he's Indian. lol.&nbsp; Then Ali and I got some lunch, brought it back to her dorm, and chilled out in the common room with Meg and Elisa - good times. :-)&nbsp; Decided to go to my 1 o' clock philosophy class and then got out 10 minutes early and went home.&nbsp; Worked 4-10 and hil sat with me for most of my break and watched ""Friends"". Went home and hit the sack.</P>
<P>Wednesday- Prendie reunion!! :-)&nbsp; Picked Kimmy up @ 7:30 and headed to prendie for mass.&nbsp; A little hard to concentrate on the road when kim is demonstrating the cat she had to disect and making all of her new noises.&nbsp; Absolutely hysterical and we actually made it on time and alive! :-)&nbsp; Got there and gave millions of hugs to all my dearly missed friends.&nbsp; Say with allison and hilary and made fun of the random turkey, Wade, Bianco, Dr. Werts, Fr. Jason's extremely short homily (no fair), and sung all the songs including ""We are one body"", but whatever happened to the clapping?&nbsp; Boy do i miss all my girls :-(&nbsp; Then we went to the caf for our ""social"" and then visited every teacher except for the select few (Bianco, Toner, Werts, etc.).&nbsp; Two hours later, I took Kimmy home and headed to allison's house.&nbsp; Me, Allison, Dev, Dana, Sar Mac, and Quiggs had pizza and basically just ""girl talked"".&nbsp; Before we left, Devon decided to dye her hair, so we stopped @ my CVS, picked up hair color, and went back to my house.&nbsp; Dev changed into a t-shirt, read the directions on the box, and we were ready!!&nbsp; After the dye was in for 10 minutes, we rinsed, washed, dried, and straightened and Dev was finally able to see the finished project!!!&nbsp; SUCCESS!!! because we all loved it !&nbsp; It was a lil darker than the box, but it came out to be a mix of strawberry blonde, w/light brown i guess. Looks awesome!!&nbsp; Then that nite i went to tommy's and we watched Shrek 2 and played Ping Pong of which i lost every game :-(&nbsp; o well...</P>
<P>Thursday-&nbsp; Turkey day!!&nbsp; In the morning i just worked on lots of homework and such and then went to my&nbsp; mom mom's house for dinner around 4.&nbsp; What was pretty darn annoying was everyone asking me how school was going!&nbsp; And then the typical questions, like how are your grades, how's your boy, etc.&nbsp; I had no problem talking bout tommy tho. lol&nbsp;&nbsp; Enjoyed awesome food and held my cousin allison all nite...she's so darn precious when she's sleeping in my arms....awww i want one. lol. not yet hto haha.</P>

<P>Monday- English class @ 10..break and lunch with katie, thom, and tom.&nbsp; Sociology class @ 12 and then home.&nbsp; Worked on my never-ending philosophy paper that was supposed to be 5-8 pages and ended up being 4...o well ask me if i care because my other grades from the other essays and tests are 91, 83, and 85.-yay!!&nbsp; I even finished my spanish composition which i dind't plan on finishing that early- double yay!!&nbsp; Tommy picked me up @ 9:45 for his 10:30 hockey game. My baby scored a goal!!!! And then to make it even&nbsp; better, it had an assist!!! Woo-Hoo!!!&nbsp; Great Job Babe!! I love you!&nbsp;</P>
<P>Tuesday-&nbsp; Review session in math @ 10 and got out around 10:45.&nbsp; Ali and I got some lunch, caught up on prendie gossip as usual. Wne to the C Store and filled up on some gummy worms and other frivolous types of candy.&nbsp; Went back to her room and chilled til our 1 o'clock class.&nbsp; Went home, helped my mom mom with some things, earned 10 bucks, listened to some of her stories, stopped by tommy's house, and then headed back to school.&nbsp; Got together with katie, thom, tom, tom,(yes, there are 3 toms, lol)&nbsp;and ashley for some dinner and then me and katie went back to her room and tried to organize our project since the guys were being little girls bout it. lol.&nbsp; God, i love those kids. :-)&nbsp; Got home round 7:30 and now i'm just printing out some things for classes.&nbsp; Pray for me tomorrow because we have our oral part to our final in spanish :-(&nbsp; I'm screwed!!!</P>

"event","Well i have updated in a while i guess because of the lack of energy and time. i dunno lol.  

This weekend was pretty good, i guess nothing extravagent but it was fun.  Friday nite I took tommy to Best Buy to return his american pie 2 that i got him.  For his bday i got him the american pie 1 and 2, american wedding, and S.W.A.T but i thought he told me he wanted the series of the American Pies but he really wanted to FINISH his collection so we had to return one.  Then we went to Cold Stone Creamery because I have never been there.  I should have gotten one of the incredible flavors but instead got only french vanilla with m&m's. lol.  Then we went back to my house and watched ""Elf""  Fell asleep after that watching ""Whose Line"" and then Tommy went home.

Saturday, i think i did some homework and watched my mom make christmas cookies.  Then tommy picked me up for dinner @ Ruby Tuesday's where we got a free appetizer since it took so long and had an awesome server!!  After dinner we picked up my sis Amanda and took her to see ""Spongebob Squarepants: The movie"" which was hysterical!!!!   What was even funnier was that tommy had his right arm around me and since amanda was using his arm rest, he just put his arm on the back of her seat but she ended up laying on his shoulder which i thought was adorable!  Her excuse was that there was a fat guy in front of her and she couldn't see....wahtever. Then since she didn't feel like getting up in the middle of the movie and buying snacks, we took her to stone cold creamery. lol.  Tommy Germanovich works there and we were gonna have amanda go up to him and ask him if he was in the movie the village but he realized who she was with so we figured it wouldn't work. o well.....  Then we went back to the house and played ping pong and watched Bruce Almighty. Then we used the rest of the nite to think of good songs for me to burn and then i took him home.  

Sunday i went to mass @ 10  and then just kinda hung out til i had work @ 4-10 where i had an unfortunate visitor: Tom DeFeo...my senior prom date. I tried to escape after i heard him talking to my manager but i felt like i was in a corner and i had no way to go and by that time he saw me :-(  Then i drove marissa home and when she told me where to turn i almost had a heart attack because it was hillcrest Ave....Tommy knows why that's significant. hahahahahahahaha :-)

Yesterday i had english class @ 10 and then stayed after to talk to my teacher about my essay.  He called me friday nite and asked if i could stay after class to talk about it becuase he wanted me to rewrite it after he helped me organize it.  Well then he decided to allow everyone to rewrite it and my grade was actually higher than others..very surprising., b/c i got a C+...he said if i rewrite it i'm looking at a B+ or an A so i'm goin for it.  Then i didn't feel like going to sociology since i wanted to visit my grandpop and be back up at school @ 4 to do a project.  Well since my mom was at the store we didn't go to the hospital rtie away.  At 3 i picked up Momma August from work since her car died and then i headed back up to school.  God I love my group...Thom making fun of my philly accent, tom just buggin the hell out of me and katie, you're my fiance....hahaha love ya babe.  Went home and visited my grandpop who is doing 100% better than when i saw him in ICU.  We know he's getting better because he was giving us history lessons and he was asking me bout my rhinestone cowboy-tommy. hahaha.  Seeing him just made my nite and the doctor said that since they got all the cancer out that they don't have to do treatment until they give him another MRin in a year. Woo - Hoo!!!!  I miss you being around grandpop! I love You!!  Then kimmy and i had a very hyper conversation which made me miss her even more!! I can't wait to hear all her new animal noices!!!

Tomorrow is mass @ Prendie which i am ECSTATIC about.  I""m picking up Kimmy and Hil and this is gonna be one hell of a car ride. hahaha i miss u girs!!!  I can't wait to see everyone and the flood gates will most likely be opening if they sing oiur old time faves. lol.  ALrite gonna go to math class :-( Then me and ali will get lunch and hang out in her room til our 1 o'clock class. And hil might visit me at work tonite. yay!! :-) i love getting visitors!!!"

"event","<P>I'm&nbsp;a little hostile about college rite now because i have a compare and contrast argumentative poetry essay due fri. and i'm bugging out!!!&nbsp; My friend Katie and i went to the school library today to get research material but of course the computer say the books are available but they're not there!!&nbsp; Great school library..let me tell ya.&nbsp; So we go back to her room and just chill until 4 our english group comes and we start watching commercials from the eagles game i taped for our project.&nbsp;&nbsp; We never realized how many car, beer, and phone service commercials are out there...it's insane.&nbsp; So i left there around 5:30 ish and got stuck in rush hour traffic.&nbsp; Went to the hospital and visited my grandpop who was taken there yesterday after he had been throwing up for a whole day straight and my grandmom was worried he was getting dehydrated. So since he was too sick to get out of bed, the ambulance came and got him.&nbsp; They tried to get an xray of his stomach but it was too inflamed so they are removing liquids and such from his stomach thru a tube in his nose which is making him feel much better-go figure.&nbsp; So i'm just praying for his health...and of course being the man he his, he's just complaining that he's dying and my grandmom is yelling @ him tellin ghis that he's not, that' he's just sick. lol</P>
<P>I'm stressed b/c they decide to throw all this mid term shit on us and then cvs decides to give me 5 days last week. Well i called out on tues. because of a mental breakdown.&nbsp; tommy came over and calmed me down and then tutored me in math..If it wasn't for him i think i may have gone insane.&nbsp; I love you tommy :-)&nbsp; I told cvs that i can only work wed. of this week and next week b/c of tests and what not so hopefully that will help me out. (crossing fingers)</P>
<P>On Friday i worked and then sat i worked 11-7 but then went to hibachi with tommy.&nbsp; Great place for a double date!!!&nbsp; Tommy caught both shrimp in his mouth and i missed :-(&nbsp; then we went back to his house and then he drove me home later.&nbsp; During that day, while my dad was building our garage, he shot himself in the leg with his nail gun and then pulled it out....gross....he went to the hospital to make sure it didn't hit anything but he was fine so he continued working...that's my dad for ya. lol.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Tomorrow i have a 10 o clock math class and then i'll go to ali's room form 11:15 to 1 because that's our free period and we're bored. Hopefully i'll get some homework done.&nbsp; so until then......</P>
<P>Good luck babe @ ur game!!! I love you!!</P>"

"event","<P>Well as you can see my other entry didn't turn out as planned. lol.&nbsp; Anyway this weekend went pretty well.&nbsp; Friday after class i went to work to get my paycheck, then went to the bank and then to the Springfield Mall and treated myself to some shopping.&nbsp; Later that nite i went over to Tommy's and watched Comedy Central and&nbsp; ""A League of Their Own"".&nbsp; Saturday i had to clean my room and just kinda hung out all day doing nothing :-) Then i had to go to work @ 4 :-(&nbsp; Sunday i worked 8-4 and then went home to get ready for some trick or treating :-)&nbsp; Tommy picked me up and we went to his cousins house to see his goddaughter and we went around with them and his other cousins and his mom.&nbsp; O by the way, we were a can can girl and a cowboy.&nbsp; Tommy's cowboy costume was a mummer's costume...extremely funny but awesome!&nbsp; After we were done there we went to his grandmom's house and saw the 4 ft. Santa that Fr. Esposito bought at my CVS.&nbsp; This santa was awesome!! It sang and danced and it was hooked up to a karaoke so that when you talked into the mike, it made santa move his lips to your words.&nbsp; Fr. Esposito scared some kids but it was all good. lol.&nbsp; Next stop was my mom mom's house where we met up with my mom, jimmy, amanda, michele, colleen, and my uncle dave.&nbsp; Chilled there for a lil bit and then swung over to my grandmom and grandpop's house b4 my fam left me to go to my aunt's house.&nbsp; Left there and went back to my mom mom's house so tommy could follow my mom to my aunt's house b/c she moved and i hadn't been there yet.&nbsp; After my aunt's house we went back to our house and me and tommy, michele, colleen, and jimmy watched Friday the 13th.....pretty darn scary!!&nbsp; My dad thought it would be funny to go outback to the basement window and scare us by knocking on the window and then putting his face against the glass with a flashlight shining in his face.&nbsp; Colleen almost wet herself. lol.&nbsp; Tommy left around 11 b/c we both had school the next day :-(&nbsp; Before i went to bed, i went to the bathroom in my mom's room.....well while i was peeing, the lights turn out and i literally screamed bloody murder!!!&nbsp; I was yelling for my mom and screaming Help Me but no one was coming...so i called my brother's name.&nbsp; I didn't want to get up b/c it's a long bathroom and i was afraid that someone was standing my the light switch.&nbsp; So my brother came in and i tolg him to turn the lights on but they didn't!!!&nbsp; Here, my mom accidentally turned the bathroom lights out when she was by the breaker turning the outside halloween lights out.&nbsp; What are the odds of that? lol. I was a bowl of jello the rest of the nite. </P>
<P>Yesterday, Debbie came to school with me for my 2 classes so she could check it out for archdiocesan scholar next year.&nbsp; We really bonded :-)&nbsp; After that i just went home and hung out with michele and colleen for a lil bit and colleen ended up planning my wedding and reception and also telling tommy what he should do for our 1 year anniversary.&nbsp; It's sooo friggin' cute....she was noticing in all my prom pics that we had never went to a dance together so her brilliant mind thought that he should set up the backyard with lights and candles and music and all and create our own prom and we could both get really dressed up :-)&nbsp; She had more ideas to go along with that but she didn't want to tell me so she is going to call tommy and let him know. lol.&nbsp; Later, i just took michele to play practice and then went to cvs to pick up my digital prints from halloween.&nbsp; Studied some sociology while watching the episode of friends when ross sleeps with someone else b/c he thought him and rachael were on a break-hysterical episode!!</P>
<P>Alrite i'm gonna go and prob but some hot chocolate and then go to math class :-(&nbsp; Then 2 hour break and then philosophy. Then I'll drive Ali home and then pick up my mom so we can go vote. Got work tonight and tommy might be stopping in :-)&nbsp; Later...</P>"

"event","<P>I HATE when the journal gets deleted...grrr.... Anyway this weekend went by pretty fast but i'm glad i got to spend every minute of it with my tommy :-)</P>
<P>Friday: Got home from school and didn nothing.&nbsp; Helped my sis get ready for the dad daughter dance. Tommy came over and then we drove to swarthmore to drop off my mom's work @ some house.&nbsp; Came back to my house and watched ""Runaway Jury"" because i never got to finish it last year in law :-(&nbsp; My mom was bored so we played Chickenfoot with dominos with jimmy, amanda, me, my mom, and tommy.&nbsp; I lost, my brother won :-(&nbsp; Tommy and i got into a fight about something i said&nbsp;but we resolved it later thank god!!&nbsp; Watched&nbsp;""Whose Line"" and then tommy went home around 12 after almost 3 hours and playing the damn game. lol.&nbsp; Went to bed.</P>
<P>Saturday:&nbsp; Tommy cam over around 1 and we left to go to prendie to watch amanda's all-star volleyball game.&nbsp; The first game was still going on so we went to the parking lot and i learned how to throw and catch a football.&nbsp; woo-hoo!!&nbsp; Michele was curious about fitting in tommy's trunk so she actually tried it and then bradz pulled up and was wondering where michele was.&nbsp; Tommy popped the trunk and there she was. lol.&nbsp; He fliiped out and told us to get her the fuck out of there. lol.&nbsp; I was curious too so i hopped in. haha.&nbsp; I'm afraid of the dark so i lasted about a full second and then i started to freak out. lol.&nbsp; Watched the game and then went back to our house and chilled.&nbsp; Bradz drove michele to work. Amanda and i were attacking each other on the kitchen floor and she wouldn't stop tickling me so i was to a point where i couldn't breath and tommy thought it was funny so he used the digital camera and took a pic of it. lol.&nbsp; Tommy went home and around 5:30 and i got in the shower to get ready for the movies.&nbsp; Tommy came over around 6:45, chilled, and then left to see ""Shark Tale""-funny, but they seemed to be trying too hard if that makes any sense. lol.&nbsp; On the way home my mom called and asked if i could meet her at CVS with my discount card so she could pick up her pictures.&nbsp; Went back to my house.&nbsp; Watched the world series and them tommy left and i went to bed.</P>
<P>Sunday:&nbsp; Went to 10 o clock mass becuase it was the confirmation initiation mass and i was amanda's sponsor.&nbsp; Went home, attempted some homework, watched the eagles game, slept for an hour and then went to tommy's house for debbie's brithday party. Had dinner with the fam including Fr. Esposito and watched ""Austin Powers :Gold Member""&nbsp; I was very holy because they had mass around 630 and Fr. said i could receive again so i did.&nbsp; Had cake, and candy, just watched ESPN with tommy, his dad, and his uncles, and his cousins. - fun times.&nbsp; Watched corrine be amused with rosey, the dog, and just basically had fun.&nbsp; His cousin Domineek was calling me mommy and tommy daddy, which i thought was adorable. haha :-)&nbsp; Went home and went to bed.</P>
<P>Monday: went to class, came home and did my philosophy paper, studied spanish, and did english journal entries.&nbsp;I hate being stressed out :-(</P>
<P>Tonight i have work 4-10 and i have a spanish quiz tomorrow and then work wed. night with a math test on thurs.&nbsp; In other words, with my owrk schedule there will be no studying going on which means i'm screwd for these tests. Wish me luck tho.&nbsp;&nbsp; later...</P>

<P><EM>Saturday i did nothing all day because i was soooo friggin' tired and cranky.&nbsp; I did go to the Springfield mall tho to look for something pink for my hair and i ran into the dunn fam and tommy.&nbsp; Then later that nite, Tommy came to mass with my family excluding michele who was at work.&nbsp; Then we went to Applebees for dinner and then went back to my house and we watched the Trading&nbsp; Spaces with Preston from Y100 and the Ellen Degeneres doing standup.&nbsp; What was weird was that it was my whole family including tommy in the basement watching it and it didn't feel weird at all.&nbsp; It just seemed like it was perfect and it fit - ya know?&nbsp; There was never a dull moment. haha. Then we picked up michele from work around 11:30 and then tommy went home. :-(</EM></P>

"event","<P>Alleluia!!!! It's Friday!!&nbsp; I can't tell you how excited i am to be able to sleep in tomorrow and not have to work AT ALL!!! WOO-HOO!!!!&nbsp; I need to get something out:&nbsp;&nbsp; I talked to Kim White and she straightened everything out about this whole rumor with her being engaged. IT""S NOT TRUE!!!&nbsp; Her mom called her crying becuase she was afraid that everyone thought really bad things about the family.&nbsp; Since Kim and I have known each other since 1st grade, she wanted to let me know that the person i knew forver, didn't go to college and turn into someone else.&nbsp; She wants to me to tell as many people as possible so i thought this was a good way.&nbsp; And to think that someone we went to grade school and high school with, someone i've known since kindergarten, started this rumor becuase she doesn't go to school and doesn't have a job so she has nothing else better to do than to start rumors about someone she used to be best friends about.&nbsp; Kim, I'm sorry for actually believing the rumor and i hope the truth spreads as fast as the rumor! I love ya babe!!!</P>
<P>Last nite I went to see ""Annie Warbucks"" and it was friggin' awesome!&nbsp; The car ride was ultimately the best and i love tommy's family.&nbsp; I love you Tommy!!&nbsp; ""What are they doing? Are they making love to the meter?""&nbsp; Haha. Gotta love Grace.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Alrite well i'm gonna go get some lunch since my english class was dismissed early and then i have 2 more classes and then work 3-9. I plan on watchin Ms. Congeniality and watchin ER that i taped last nite.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then i'm sleeping in like there's no tomorrow.&nbsp; :-)</P>"

"event","<P>Hola!!&nbsp; It's Thursday! Woo-Hoo!!&nbsp; Here's a little recap of the past week:</P>
<P>Monday- As I'm walking into the building for my english class, Tommy calls me and asks if i'm listening to the radio.&nbsp; He said that Preston and Steve from Y100 just read the e-mail i wrote them ON AIR!!!&nbsp; He said he was driving to school when he heard them talking about someone who's brother always listened to their show but she didn't know how a morning show could be that funny.&nbsp; At first he thought it could be&nbsp;me since Jimmy ALWAYS listens to the show and he knows that he got me hooked.&nbsp; Then he heard that the person always listens to&nbsp;the show on her way to school, St. Joe's!&nbsp; He flips out and then hears my name.&nbsp; He said his heart almost jumped out of his stomach. haha.&nbsp; After my e-mail, they started talking about the hoot toot again because i mentioned that in the e-mail, which i thought was aweseome because I started a conversation on a radio show-too cool.&nbsp; :-)&nbsp; I go to english and tommy obviously wasn't the only one that heard my e-mail because Mike comes into class and begins flipping out about he was just getting dressed for class when he hears St. Joe's and Jen Bradley on the Preston and Steve show.&nbsp; He began yelling at his radio and then had his roomate chime in becuase he's in my spanish class. I was rolling. lol.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Tuesday- Math and Philosphy class- BORING!! Then I worked 4-10 and Tommy stopped in to see me before he went to his hockey game. :-)&nbsp; That night he had 3 goals and 1 assist.&nbsp; I'm so proud of you baby!! And then what even better is that he's ranked 9th in the league for number of goals scored! WOO-HOO!!!!</P>
<P>Wednesday- Spanish test which I can confidently say I BOMBED!!!&nbsp; I'm horrible with oral things.&nbsp; We had questions on the test where we had 2 answer them based on the paragraph she was reading out loud - not good.&nbsp; Then i had 2 write some letter about us visiting us somewhere, blah blah blah.&nbsp; Then english, sociology, and philosophy.&nbsp; During my break, before i'm about to go into Sociology, I go through my phone and decide to call some people i haven't talked to in awhile.&nbsp; I leave Kim a message, try Sam and a couple other people.&nbsp; Then I call Ed just to say hi.&nbsp; I figured he would be @ work so i would just leave a message. Well when i called he never saved my number so he didn't realize who i&nbsp; was but i didn't know that.&nbsp; He had to go becuase he had 2 get ready for work in 10 minutes.&nbsp; Then about 2minutes later he calls me back and asks for my last name.&nbsp; I was little shocked, but when i told him he was like, ""OOOOO.......thank god, i thought u were a different Jen for a minute,.&nbsp; I had it saved but i didn't have the last name. When you called i knew the voice but was afraid it was this other Jen who was the reason i changed my number.&nbsp;""&nbsp; So anyway he was glad it was me and not someone else and then i went to class.&nbsp; After my philosophy class i have a missed call and when i call it back it was Robin Ford&nbsp; - where Ed works - I just hang&nbsp;up.&nbsp; On my way home from picking my lil sister up from school he calls again and tells me to come visit him at work and i say no becuase I have to go to work.&nbsp; Well when i do get to work, he texts me and says that he's glad that i called him today. Then he added a smiley face.&nbsp; I asked him why he was so glad b/c it's not like we can be together or anything.&nbsp; Well don't you know he comes in and visits me on his way home from work!!!!&nbsp; You should have seen Sarah Weiser's expression.&nbsp; He told me that if he's gonna buckle down, that he's gonna have to find out what kinda competition he has with Tommy.&nbsp; He said he liked my hair but he likes it better curly b/c that's how my hair was in the picture we took of ourselves in his car. - PSYCHO!!!&nbsp; And if he asked how long me and tommy were together one more time i was gonna flip!!&nbsp; Right before he left he said that i don't have to worry bout him interefering in my life with Tommy.&nbsp; I said ok b/c is he did Tommy would kick his ass but Ed didn't believe that he could.&nbsp; I said, ""Believe me, He WILL kick your ass!""&nbsp; Then he left.&nbsp; Now Tommy is pissed with Ed so if you see something on the news about a metrosexual being beat to death, you know that involved Tommy kicking ed's ass......haha side-note...Thanks Tommy for being so protective of me i love you sooo much!!! I'm glad i'm YOUR most prized possession. :-)&nbsp; Another side-note- Sarah loved my hair sooo much that she actually bought hair color last nite 2 dye her hair dark. lol.</P>
<P>Today-&nbsp; i only have one class til 11:15 and then me and ali are going to the gym for no more than an hour b/c i'm getting my haircut @ 1.&nbsp; After that i was supposed to have tennis practice with JV but that was cancelled so i 'm just gonna sleep. lol.&nbsp; Then @ 7, I""m being picked up to go&nbsp;see the play&nbsp;""Annie Warbucks"" in Philly with Tommy's family.&nbsp; I just can't wait to be with Tommy all nite :-)&nbsp; I'm gonna go and fall asleep in math class so i'll catch up later.&nbsp; Adios!!</P>"

"event","<P><EM><FONT size=4>This was truly a weekend from HELL!!!!&nbsp; Friday nite i worked from 3-9.&nbsp; To make things worse, i ended up yelling at my manager in front of customers and one of the customers told me that she liked my attitude and that i should be the manager, not him. It was seriously a brawl and then he tried to get on my good side b/c he didn't want to get in trouble since he's assistant manager. Blackmail...haha.&nbsp; So then when i got down i picked up tommy to come to my house for a little bit.&nbsp; We watched Whose Line and What Women Want. I took him home and got in early..around 11...got in a fight with my mom and went to bed angry..not a good thing. :-(</FONT></EM></P>
<P><EM><FONT size=4>Saturday morning i wake up around 7 to get ready to go into Philly to Jena Madeline so Alexis can do my hair.&nbsp; I get online to get directions and leave around 8:15 for my appointment @ 9.&nbsp; Well I get lost going there and arrive around 9:20.....20 minutes late and i only had enought change to put 38 minutes on the meter. haha.&nbsp; I scrounge up some change from a random lady in the shop and it bring my time to 2 hours. :-) (i was thinking i would be out of there in time...wrong!!!)&nbsp; Alexis matches up my hair color..blah blah blah...and 2 1/2 hours later i can get rinsed.&nbsp; First of all she missed a streak of blond hilite and she couldn't do anything about it.&nbsp; I figured, Hey, i'll go home put permanent black marker in it until i get it fixed no problem.....I get outside and call tommy to tell him that he has a gothic girlfriend!!!&nbsp; My hair was seriously black!!!!&nbsp; I get to my car and find out that i have a $20 ticket for the meter running out :-o!!!!&nbsp; Do police have nothing better to do with their lives than to go aorund and ticket damsels in distress? i mean seriously leave me alone!!!I sit in my car and the fountains break loose!!!!!&nbsp; Tommy told me that i have to calm down before i start driving b.c to make matters worse, i didn't know how to get home.&nbsp; So i'm driving and trying to see the road&nbsp; a head of me through my blurry crying eyes.&nbsp; I'm driving and i pass about 13 exits before i find out from my dad that i'm on 95 north and that i should be taking 95 south!!!!!&nbsp; So i get back on the phone with tommy and cry some more!! From now on i'm never volunteering to have my hair done by a beginner and i'm never taking road trips without someone else in the car.&nbsp; I call my hairdresser and she tells me to come in and she'll try to fix it as best as she can.&nbsp; Before i stop by there i see tommy so he can see my hair before i get it fixed.&nbsp; I thought it was soo sweet b.c i was starving so he brought out 2 bags of mini oreos...awwww......&nbsp; Anyway, she said she couldn't re-color it so soon so she just fixed that patchy parts and put 4 foils of hilites in the front just to lighten it up b/ i was sooo dark !!!!&nbsp; We both agreed it was a nice color but it was too dark for me. So i go in again on Thurs to get it cut.&nbsp; Then i&nbsp;went to work 4-10.</FONT></EM></P>
<P><EM><FONT size=4>While i'm at work tommy and my brother jimmy stop in to say hi because they were going to Marple for free open skate.&nbsp; Yes...while i was at work, my boyfriend and brother were having fun without me lol.&nbsp; I get home from work and then tommy stays until about 11:30.&nbsp;&nbsp;I get teased all nite from my dad and mom about how dark my hari is and my dad&nbsp;said i was set for halloween and it just didn't end...it was horrible. &nbsp;I find out that the arson fire in Philly was on 6th street...the street that i was driving on while I was in Philly...o yes that was great lol.&nbsp; </FONT></EM></P>
<P><EM><FONT size=4>Today Tommy picked me up for mass at his aunt's house and then we went to lunch @ Benigans!&nbsp; Then we stopped in the Halloween Adventure store to look at some ideas:&nbsp; Outlet and plug, pimp and flapper,&nbsp; nurse and army man, blah blah......then we went to the one in&nbsp; Mc Dirt mall and we found a great idea!!!!&nbsp; Cowboy and&nbsp; a can can girl!! haha.&nbsp; My costume was only $15 because it had a slight whole in it but it can easily be sewn.&nbsp; YAY!!!&nbsp; We are gonna look soooo hot!!!!&nbsp; Then he dropped my off around 3 and i went to get gas and finally get my car washed !! I couldn't help but laugh b/c while they were waxing it and drying it they were blasting my Mariah Carey CD and actually singing to it.&nbsp; haha.&nbsp; </FONT></EM></P>

"event","<P>Well hello everyone!!!&nbsp; Like my subject says, I have discovered caffeine pills!! I have been working at least 3 days during the school week and then a weekend, sometimes friday AND saturday&nbsp; (not good for Jen).&nbsp; I get up in the morning and go to class and i can't function..i just sit there and daydream and stare at the wall and it's not helping me in class at all!&nbsp; I figured i would try some caffeine pills b/c it says it raises attention span and keeps you awake.&nbsp; Tommy told me that he didn't want me to take them but i called him last nite and asked him b/c i was desperately seeking some way to stay awake.&nbsp; When I work i sometimes drink Red Bull and eat sour worm things that are loaded with sugar and that usually works but i can't just whip out that stuff in class haha.&nbsp; So hopefully this stuff works (crossing fingers).</P>
<P>Tuesday was my birthday and i've loaded up on cash which i will spending on a much needed car wash today and then when i find to time to go the&nbsp;mall, i'll be buying winter shirts/sweaters.&nbsp; My birthday dinner included my family, grandmom, grandpop, mom mom, and tommy coming over to enjoy a meal or Filet Mignon, baked potato, fresh salad, peas (which i don't voluntarily eat them so why would i have them on my birthday??? when i DO eat them i have 2 take them like i do with milk, except i use milk..haha).&nbsp; Me, tommy, amanda, and jimmy ate in the reckroom watching TV while the rest of the fam was in the kitchen.&nbsp; After dinner we had the infamous 204 cake and ice cream.&nbsp; Then Tommy got me the full 2nd season of Friends and the finale show on DVD so we watched the finale down the basement and then American Wedding which was on TV and he left around 9:45 b/c i really needed to get to bed for my early class the next morning :-(</P>
<P>Today i have a class til 11:15 then i'm taking Ali home and then i need to do homework and especially my sociology paper due tomorrow which isn't a big deal but it's such a broad topic that i don't know what to write. ya know?? Then i have 2 go Naylor's Run @ 2:30 and coach the JV tennis team.&nbsp; Since Meg is babysitting this week,&nbsp;Mr. Wieners was talking to Laura Moody and she said she would help me..thank god!!&nbsp; Then i have to go back home and FINISH my homework and probably pop another caffeine pill haha.</P>
<P>Starting today i am seriously starting a diet so i can lose 10 pounds.&nbsp; I mean i'm comfortable with my body to an extent but my weight has gone up a lil so i want 2 bring it down so i can feel even better about myself.&nbsp; I'm just cutting out snacks in between meals and drinking lots of water.&nbsp; I'm gonna have ali come to the gym with me and maybe walk the track sometimes so i can keep in shape :-)</P>
<P>Alrite well i'm outta here so i can be more bored before my math class...joy.&nbsp; This is the class where i need to be awake because i need to bring up my D on the last test.&nbsp; Talk to everyone later!! Leave a comment if you love me haha. :-)</P>"

I didn't feel so bad because Mike got the same grade so i didn't feel like the stupidest one in the class. lol.&nbsp; Then in between classes i talked to hilary becuase i found out that one of the sororitys at school is holding a ""Saved By the Bell"" trivia game tonight and all of them were wearing ""Bayside Tigers"" tee-shirts and i thought that was friggin' awesome!!!&nbsp; Too bad tonite is my bday dinner :-(&nbsp; </P>

"event","<P>Hello Everyone!! I haven't updated for awhile so i thought i would :-)&nbsp; Last week I had to work Tues, Wed, Thurs, and Friday...booooo....On Thursday i had to take my math test which i think i overworked myself for because it wasn't as bad as i thought it would be (knocking on wood).&nbsp; After i was done the test i left and it was only about 9:45 and i wasn't picking Ali up to go home til 11:15 after her class so i had some time to kill.&nbsp; I figured that i needed to get this packet for my sociology class the next day so since i had time i drove across the street to that St. Joe's Press to pick that up.&nbsp; Well when i was coming out of class it began to rain and i had white courdoroys on and black flip flops and my hair was straightened.&nbsp; At first it was just spitting out, then it began to pour and i didn't have an umbrella with me because it was nice when i went to class.&nbsp; So when i get to the Press, i pull out the umbrella in the back of my car but of course it's broken and it doesn't stay up by itself so i have 2 hold it up.&nbsp; So i begin running through the parking lot and i trip and my flip flop breaks...0f course....&nbsp; So now i'm running thru the parking lot with one flip flop on and carrying the other.&nbsp; I didn't want the people in the press to think i was this poor child without a flip flop so i just kinda slid it on and stood in place when i was talking to them . lol.&nbsp; But ya know the packet was $6 and they wouldn't accept credit card so i had to leave...DAMN!!!&nbsp; From here i got over to Sourin to pick up Ali but she's calling me and flippin out that it's raining and she's out of breath and she's wearing a white tee-shirt. haha.&nbsp; I ask her to bring a towel or rag so i can wipe off my feet and dry my pants that were draggin on the ground.&nbsp; I ended up driving home barefoot but i did end up fixing my flip flop. :-)&nbsp; So I go home and have some raviolios (Mmm Mmmm good) and get changed into some dry clothes and head back out for school to pick this packet up with cash.&nbsp; I was supposed to be coaching he JV tennis team @ 230 but i was hoping it would stop raining so i wouldn't have to rush back home. After i got the packet i get a call from my mom saying that Mr. Wieners called her from Michele's cell phone in class to tell me that the varsity match was cancelled but my the practice was still on (Bummer).&nbsp; But on my way home i was talking to meg amrein and she told me that i should check out the courts so see how wet they were and THANK GOD, they were absolutely flooded!! So i went to prendie and found mr. Wieners who made the annoucement and cancelled practice.&nbsp; Since i was already @ school, i thought i would be nice and pick up my brother and sister instead of them taking the bus.&nbsp; I pick them up along with Kelly Cupples and Debbie August.&nbsp; I drop them off and them michele and i head out to CVS and then to the bank.&nbsp; I het home and talk to Tommy and he wanted to go my lil sister Amanda's volleyball game with me so i started my homework so i could go out.&nbsp; I pick tommy up around 5:45 and head out to Holy Spirit for the game.&nbsp; Amanda has never been so excited that someone was coming to her game as she was when she found out that Tommy wanted to come. lol.&nbsp; I found out that putting my brother and tommy together was an extremely bad thing.&nbsp; After each hit or play or whatever, they would stand up and clap and yell for Amanda!!!&nbsp; They were so loud the entire game i felt like i was their mom.&nbsp; lol.&nbsp; On the way home i had to pull over and get my brother from my mom's car b/c he didn't feel like going the candle demonstration with my mom and sister so i had to bring him home after i dropped off Tommy. Instead my mom said the 3 of us could just hang out @ the house for a while.&nbsp; We ended up going home to get money and then going to Rita's and THEN went home.&nbsp; When we were @ the house i ditched the guys and went to the basement and tommy knew i was already upset (won't say about what because it's kinda disgusting haha) and he was telling my brother that I'm probably gonna dump him but he said that this is the first time a girl actually likes him and he wasn't going to lose me.&nbsp; Jimmy was actually upset later that night because he said that tommy was upset thinking that i was gonna dump him and jimmy was really concerned.&nbsp; I thought that was so cute. lol. Side note- i'm never gonna dump tommy. :-)</P>
<P>Friday i worked til 9 and i was exhausted and didn't want to go out so i went home and watched Finding Nemo because my manager was talking about it and it put me in the mood to watch it lol.</P>
<P>Saturday i worked 10-6 and then went home put my head over the tub, got changed and then tommy picked me up around 6:30 to go see Ladder 49.....May i say that i was fucking AWESOME!!!!&nbsp; The theater was packed!!! I ordered the tix online before work so we didn't have to worry about it being sold out or waiting in line.&nbsp; After the movie we went back to his house which was the PERFECT nite we just literally laid on the couch and cuddled with his sis in the room and us watching the Chapelle show. We had this vision of Full House when DJ and Steve fell asleep on his couch and her dad came and saw them, because i was seriously beginning to fall asleep. lol.</P>

"event","<P>I just have this gut feeling that today is going to be a bad day.&nbsp; It's miserable and raining out, i'm having a bad hair day, i have math and philosophy class today, i don't want to go to work, and it's only tuesday.&nbsp; AHHH!!!</P>
<P>Yesterday in english class, we were talking about things that make us remember cerain times in our lives and my teacher said that he will never be able to look at a full moon on a summer's night again without thinking of Venice.&nbsp; I couldn't help but smile because Tommy and I are always talking about our honeymoon and since he's 100 % Italian that's where he wants to go.&nbsp; Then at the end of class he was telling us his dream about his brother that passed away about a year ago.&nbsp; He said that with his brother in the dream, it gave him a sense of comfort and calm.&nbsp; Well as he was telling us his dream Tommy text me but i wasn't able to read it til after class.&nbsp; Tommy said that he had a dream about me but he didn't know what i was doing in the dream but it just comforted him.&nbsp; It was so weird. So for english class we have to do 3 journal entries a week from this one book or we can just write about what we talked about in class and that's what i did last nite...&nbsp;&nbsp; I was going crazy without seeing tommy even tho it had only been a day and half, so i drove my mom's work back to this house and then picked up the digital pictures of my cousin and since i was out i stopped by and saw tommy...shhhh....It ended up being&nbsp;a brawl becausee he slapped me twice and i tried 2 slap him back and he grabbed me and tried to slap him again but his glasses fell off...he grabbed my leg flipped me upside down and carried me to the couch and then pushed me off and i landed on Rosey, his dog.&nbsp; haha.&nbsp; He called his dog a bitch because hit was just kinda flipping her wrist and i told him that i wonder where she got it from and just looked at tommy...fight broke out again and then i left. lol.&nbsp; God i love him :-)</P>
<P>Well we got out sociology test back yesterday and the teacher was scaring us because she was saying how the grades range from A's to F's and I was scared because i thought the test was easy so if i did bad i would be upset.&nbsp; Well wouldn't you know that i got a 75!!! The girl next to me got a 54 so i didn't feel so bad.lol.&nbsp; She said the class average as 77.9 but since it was our first test that we shouldn't worry about it.&nbsp; I didn't get a chance to see what questions i got wrong since she gave it back the last 5 minutes of class but they had to have been trcik questions because i thought they were easy. o well....</P>
<P>Alrite well this was pretty boring but i'm gonna go and but pop tarts before my boring math class starts where we review for our test on thurs.-joy.&nbsp; Later....</P>"

"event","<P>Hello everyone, it's Monday and I surpisingly don't mind being at school.&nbsp; Today are my favorite classes, english and sociology, AND i dont have to work tonite which means i can just relax and do nothing--i'm so excited!&nbsp; My weekend was quite busy, but not overly hectic:</P>
<P>Friday nite I had to work 3-9.&nbsp; I was invited by Tommy and his family to stop over his Aunt Teresa's house because they were celebrating exactly a year to Tommy's cousin's wedding and they had food and stuff.&nbsp; I was determined to get out of work early so i could see tommy sooner so i asked my manager that since there were 2 other people besides me closing, that if i didn't take a break, if i could leave at 8:30 and he said that was fine so i got out early.&nbsp; I went to the party in my work outfit--very flattering, haha.&nbsp; We watched some of the Phillies game and just kinda hung out and then we left around 10 i guess to go to Hillcrest...only me and tommy know. haha.&nbsp; I got home around 11 because i was exhausted and i had to work the next day again.&nbsp; So then i went to bed...end of Friday nite.</P>
<P>Saturday i had to work 12-8..not as long as I expected.&nbsp; I got yelled at my an old woman because she thought that i cahrged her too much and she was swearing on her dead husband's grave, but then her ""live"" husband next to her realized that I was right and her apologized.&nbsp; I think she should apologize to her dead husband. lol.&nbsp; So I left at 8, went home and got ready to go to the movies to see ""Wimbledon"" with Tommy.&nbsp; He came over around 8:40 and&nbsp;we ended up watching some of Cast Away on tv and then watching Rocky III with my brother down the basement.&nbsp; We left for the movie around 9:10.&nbsp; The movie was very good--it was kinda the story about me and tommy except we aren't in wimbledon. haha.&nbsp; I got home around 12:15 and went to bed at like 12:30....end of Saturday.</P>
<P>Sunday I went to church @ 10, then took my sis and sarah guy to play practice @ 12.&nbsp; On my way home I stopped in @ Cannon's and bought a new car air freshener. Ocean Breeze smells awesome by the way.&nbsp; Then I came home and started my homework but my lap top doesn't have Microsoft Word so i took a trip to Best Buy and bought the program for students and some disks to save my documents on.&nbsp; $148 later i went home.&nbsp; Just as i was about to continue my homework, My uncle andy and my new cousin Alyson stop by for a visit.&nbsp; I ended up having her for an hour and a half, feeding her, burping, her and just basically keeping her content and happy.&nbsp; I just want to keep her, she's so friggin' adorable.&nbsp; Then my grandmom and grandpop came over which made me procrastinate some more and then finally around 4:30 I started my take home test for philosophy that's due Tues.&nbsp; I'm so proud of myself because I finished it and it wasn't even due today--go me!!Ate dinner....blah blah...did some more journal entries for english and then talked to tommy....O yea, for anyone who is reading this, if you could pray for Tommy's grandmom because she is in the hospital because she has fluid in her heart.&nbsp; She is Fr. Esposito's mother so pray for his also.&nbsp; Thank You!</P>
<P>Today I'm done my classes at 12:50.&nbsp; I am scheduled to give blood at St. George's today but i'm backing out because i'm too scared.&nbsp; I passed out last time and i just don't wanna do it this time.&nbsp; I was gonna ask tommy to go with me but my appt. is @ 3:15 and he doesn't get done class til 3:05.&nbsp; Besides i don't wanna drive home and i'm not gonna have my mom take me so i'm just not gonna go.&nbsp; lol.&nbsp; </P>
<P>I have some adjustments to the previous journal entries.&nbsp; The kiss quiz thing where it asks about kissing a celebrity and i never answered, my answers are john mayer, heath ledger, and maybe freddie prinz jr.&nbsp; Tommy said there's nothing wrong with this because i don't have chance with any of them. lol.&nbsp; And also in the survey where you're supposed to hilite the things that are true, i hilited that i tried drugs before and i didn't mean to. lol.&nbsp; Unless, taking diet pills counts as trying drugs, then i never did drugs. haha.&nbsp; later....</P>"

"event","yes, I hate this journal thing. Im just gonna start my own journal at home in my own copybook becuase this journal causes too much controversy and gets people upset.&nbsp; Tommy, i'm sorry...I didn't mean to make it sound like i had the worst day when i was talking about you and then my day got better when i was talking about ed....because that's not how it was.&nbsp; I was upset all day but i did get better when you and me worked things out. I am madly in love with you tommy and nothing is going to change that!!!&nbsp; And to straighten things out, Tommy didn't make me cry, i made myself cry because i was upset at the whole situation we were having that I caused.&nbsp; If anyone made anyone cry, it was me making tommy upset because i caused the situation but tommy brought it up for us to talk about.&nbsp; So I'm just starightening things out because i didn't want people to think that tommy is this horrible boyfriend making me cry becuase he isn't! He's perfect for me and we're perfect for each other!!&nbsp; I love you Tommy!!!"

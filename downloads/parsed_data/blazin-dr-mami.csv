Did you ever love someone and know they didnt care? Did you ever feel like crying knowing it would get you no where? Did you ever look into someones eyes and say a lil prayer? Did you ever loo into someones heart wishing you were there? Did you ever watch someone walk away, not wanting them to go? Did you wisper, ""God I love you"" but never letting them know? You cry at night in misery and almost go insane. Nothing in this world causes so much pain. If I could choose between love and death, I think I'd rather die. Love hurts and the price u pay is high. So I say, ""dont fall in love"" it'll hurt before its through, you see my friend, I ought to know, because I fell in love with you. 

              ***************** juss friendz **************************

You say you want to ""juss be friendz"" You dont want me to cry But you cant even bring yourself To look me in the eye How can I be friends with you When I love you so much And every time I close my eyes I remember your soft touch Why did you say you loved me If you knew it would end like this? Then I hear myself ask you For one last goodnight kiss As you lean down towards my face A tear falls from my eye I remember all we'd been through Now I have to say good-bye How rage flows through my veins Just as your lips brush my cheek You broke my heart in pieces Now I see that I was weak I've changed alot since then Sometimes I still think of you Now I dont feel love or hate For the boy who broke my heart in two

                 ************ I MISS U ************

I miss you But I know I must forget you Because you will never be with me you left me and never will return Because you love someone else I want to be with you I miss you And I always will."

I hate how certain people either avoid me or dont like me because I have a boyfriend. I dont understand that. I Hate how I am at the mental level of 18 or 19 and cant enjoy being young. Everything just plain sucks. I feel like I dont belong anywhere. maybe i dont. this will probably be neverending. I hate how almost no one seems to care whats really going on with me and I hate being treated like shit just because I dont talk alot in school. fuck them, im not shy, i just hate school. 

I will do everyone a favor once i can just leave. Let go of all the shit that has fucked with my mind so much over the years. I hate family. I hate doing the same thing every fucking day. Im not gonna go and kill myself though, I am just having a semi breakdown. What i need is a drink to forget.

My whole body aches and I have nothing to do. I hate the way I am, I just fucking hate myself."

Homecoming is on saturday, i dont really want to go, personally, i think its stupid and no, im not being apathetic or anti-social I just think its pointless. Sure ill go to prom but not homecoming besides i dont have a dress.

I think im almost out of therapy, i just have to talk to one more person, i wont even bother with my father, its pointless so ill just act like everythings fine with daddy dearest..

School is ok, im actually doing pretty well in my classes which is a surprise.

I decided finally that im going to get my belly button pierced, tongue pierced, and my tattoo, i hope i can get at least 1 done soon.

Im also getting pretty good at driving which means im closer to getting a liscence but im not going to get the car i wanted anymore, long story and besides i doubt anyones reading this anyways.

other than that everything is the same. Sarah hasnt called, i guess moving made her forget about me. oh well im not going to waste my energy on that, she wont change.

My personality is changing a little bit, i think its for the better, im not as weak anymore i think, actually this could just be a mood swing of happiness which will go away in a few days, im used to it.

Ive broken down at least 4 times since school started, it sucks. I stayed home because i was a mess on the 3rd day and i went home on the 5th day because Laz didnt aprove of my shirt. I hate being a sophmore.
Friday i went to lake compounce with serena, it was fun <3. 
My mom made an appt with some theripist, apparently she can force me to go on meds, long story. yeah...

But that does not make you a bad<br>person. Some of my friends are apathetic and I<br>love them, but it wouldn't hurt to care a<br>little more. Trust me life hurts, most people<br>who are apathetic do it cause they were hurt.<br>But don't worry, life is pain, its also<br>pleasure. Good luck. (please vote)

Alcohol!
 Mmmmmmm, Mmmmmm, Bitch! I like you, alcohol is one<br>of the better things to be addicted to. The<br>only bad part is it makes you feel like doing<br>nothing and the next morning you get a terrible<br>hangover.

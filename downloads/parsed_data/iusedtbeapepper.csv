"event","I don't usually post on here. But I just saw a movie that really makes me wonder.  I couldnt breathe for the last ten minutes of the film, but don't really know whether it was bad or good.  It was affecting but I don't know if I like being affected this way.  Atonement.  For everyone who works in the arts it is worth seeing just for the commentary it makes on art, but I am not sure I llike that commentary.  Thats all.  
   I also usually post who I think will and should be nominated for Academy Awards, even without seeing all of them, and these are what I think:
FILM:  No country for Old Men
       Juno

          Ellen Page JUNO
          Marion Cotillard La Vie En Rose
          Helena Bonham Carter SWEENEY TODD

"event","I don't generally make entries on my Lj, mainly because I use it to communicate things to the CDW lj, and so I am not even sure who reads my lj.  
   Likewise I have made some errors here at CDW, but there are some things that I am correct about.  And some things I have to share observations about.  I just saw the movie North Country last night, and even though I had avoided the movie because of lukewarm reviews, and it is rated R, I was stunned by the relevance of the movie.  
There are Union members quarrelling in this movie, there are questions of harassment and rights, there is a father told by his wife, she didnt kill anyone, her affront was far less.  There were moments in the movie when I cried. 
When I laughed.  There were questions about harassment, and situations of far worse actual attacks, shocking but part of the history.  But it said a lot to me.  About being part of a community, whether as a Union Brother or Sister, or a theatre company member.  Some things are private, but I have offended a couple of CDWers, sometimes I really do treat too many of the kids as if they truly are adults, revealing far too much to them, and asking far too much interaction from them. But I didnt kill anyone.  And I have provided a very good home base for numbers of them.  Sometimes I feel bad that I am not doing far more with far more folks my own age, but an awful lot my age are very jaded, very locked in to being uninspiring.  I may be too much of an artiste, a free spirit, and some who pretend that they are indeed avant garde, really freak out when in the midst of doing things supposedly conventional I do avant garde things, like attempting a movie, like finding the nuances in Shakespeare or Ibsen or Chekov, or even in Bedroom Farce.  
    There are things that are valuable.  We find some of them here.  And sometimes those who want to negate what they have done here, don't realize the real value of what they have gained.  Some of that has to to with age.  I may seem like the world's oldest teenager (and sometimes I function like that), but there is a tendency, I believe, for even those who loved this place and what happened here when they were young to rebel against it and me.   Some of that is natural.  Some 'kids"" cannot continue to gorever defer to this place like they could when they were young.  Everyone has to break away from time to time. Some to never come back.  But hopefully they will come back, not as deferent kids, but with a new appreciation for the opportunities here, and elsewhere, based on what they have learned here.  
     And I already confessed I am not the best always in how I interact with others.  I think I understand the dynamics of interpersonal interaction fairly well, and understand interaction in theatre very well, but I am not always the swiftest in dealing with others either.  I am human too, and sometimes fall prey to hurting and being hurt by others.  i make mistakes in how I deal with some, patience with others.  But one of the things I hope everyone learns as they grow up, is that we are all just trying the best path. Sometimes we make stupid turns, but in all of the ones who show their worth here, they are not from deliberate vindictiveness.  Most of us are just trying to find the best way to interact with others.  To play well with others.  I for one have not always played well with others, but I like to think I have provided a space where we can all practive that.  And any bads, are balanced out by many more goods.  You can tell that a few incidents have gotten me very very worked up.  For about four months now. 
    That was why North Country was so good.  It said the same things. There are ways to work out of the bads, and only those who give up and surrender to it, whether external or internal, are the real losers.  Strange, out of a strange and pretty oppressive movie, such a positive message.  Many of you won't read this, but for those that do, and if you are too young, maybe you can see North Country someday when you are older, and see some of the things I saw in it.  Some of the things may not be viewed as kind to me, but my approach has always been more theatrical, more vicarious, and I have never functioned as some in that movie had, which is good.  But many can learn from it.
We are always learning (my mode of functioning), even myself as I grow older.

"event","Already I am changing the season for this year.  I am going to do 5 short Chekov plays for the October slot, and save the Death of Christopher Columbus (so I can finish rewriting it) until next year when I can properly promote it, and maybe get it produced at some other locations than just in Sidney.  I am feeling a need to expand more out of the space here, and something like the film projects and producing a play like Columbus elsewhere will do that.

So be warned all:

October 7-15:  Five short plays by Chekov:  The Witch, The Proposal, the Festivities, The Bear, and Swan Song.

We/I have changed the CDW schedule already.

"event","I am late, as usual, but before Christina week is over I will make a posting on her.  First, have any of you seen Christina in a play. She can play almost anything.  And for that reason I and others have used her for a range of parts over the years.  From guys to girls (in As YOU LIKE IT), to multiple parts (as in MONTY PYTHON).  For those who have not seen her enough, you should see the current production at CDW (Shameless plug for current show, but this is the CDW site).  It is a very fun show, and, as usual, Christina plays all the fun parts so very very very well.  Which has been the case since she first came here.  She has done so many excellent character parts over the years (ARSENIC AND OLD LACE?) She also is fun in playing D and D which we also do here most weekends, and is into playing those characters and figuring them out too. She was SHELOB in RETURN OF THE KING here. She was Saruman, 
Guildenstern, in KING LEAR, HAMLET, PRINCESS BRIDE, and a whole host of other shows. One of the people who keep making CDW even better out here, and an excellent actress, exhibiting all the better qualities needed, focus, concentration, ability to maintain as a character, needed for the very best in theatre.  She is a treat to have around here, and we should all be thankful.  Thanks all.  Will mutter on about Henry and Rose later, although will wish them a HAPPY BIRTHDAY ! ! ! Hope their birthday is not on Monday however, because hopeful of rehearsing Bedroom Farce on Monday.

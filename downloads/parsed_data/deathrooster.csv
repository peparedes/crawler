You are pained love. Something has happened in either your life or his/hers that's hurt. You seek comfort in the arms of your love, or they in yours. Kind, gentle caresses and kisses ease the pain. Often, you spend hours together, simply in each others comforting embrace, forgetting about the worries and pain of the world. A love that is both sad and beautiful.

I am not online much these days, since there's plenty to do at work.. and plenty to do for school, and plenty to do with friends, and plenty to do around the house.. and soon plenty to do outdoors.

So, I live in the land of plenty, which means I have the opposite-of-plenty time for online posts.

But, I still wanted to say HEY!

Love ya!"

Any one know of a good site hosting service that allows you to customize your content and upload your own HTML code?

I signed up for a site through this hosting service, only to realize that they give you 11 cookie cutter page templates to choose from. If I want to change a dimension of a logo space, or select a pretty shade of green, I have to PAY EXTRA EVERY MONTH. I get only a squashed area for my logo, and a shitty shade of green.

I don't want to pay extra for working more. I want a cheap host with a domain registration that allows me to code/edit the HTML any fucking way I want.

OMG.

I'm so livid. I sent an e-mail, hoping they'll refund the money. Can you only edit your HTML in the sucky, pop-up-laden, ad-banner-ridden free sites???

Building Evacuation

The University Police Department has received a bomb threat for the following buildings: Blegen Hall, the Social Sciences Tower, and Anderson Hall on the West Bank. These buildings are being evacuated and closed for the day. Evening classes are canceled in these three buildings.

Those individuals in Blegen Hall, Social Sciences Tower, and Anderson Hall should secure their work spaces, take personal possessions, and leave for the day.

Naturally, the big drug companies, oil companies, and business lobbies are fighting hard to stop her.

MoveOn has started a petition to Congress so we can show our representatives we're ready for some real progress, and they should act quickly to pass the 100 Hours Agenda.

Plus, the total signature count and some of our comments will be read out loud on the floor of Congress during the debate -- so the more we get, the louder our voice will be. </i>"

They have a holiday flower show with oodles of poinsettias, and a new tropical rainforest exhibit.

<P align=""center""><font face=""Verdana"">Beauty, happiness, pleasure, success, luxury, dissipation.</font></P>
<p align=""center""><font face=""Verdana"">The Empress is associated with Venus, the feminine planet, so it represents, 
beauty, charm, pleasure, luxury, and delight. You&nbsp;may&nbsp;be&nbsp;good&nbsp;at&nbsp;home 
decorating, art or anything to do with making things beautiful.</font></p>
<p align=""center""><font face=""Verdana"">The Empress is a creator, be it creation of life, of romance, of art or business. While the Magician is the primal spark, the idea made real, and the High Priestess is the one who gives the idea a form, the Empress is the womb where it gestates and grows till it is ready to be born. This is why her symbol is Venus, goddess of beautiful things as well as love. Even so, the Empress is more Demeter, goddess of abundance, then sensual Venus. She is the giver of Earthly gifts, yet at the same time, she can, in anger withhold, as Demeter did when her daughter, Persephone, was kidnapped. In fury and grief, she kept the Earth barren till her child was returned to her.</font></p>

Apparently, Michael Richards (""Kramer"" from Seinfeld) went on a racist rampage at a recent comedy gig.

The video footage from a cell phone in the audience is pretty graphic and awful. There's no ambiguity AT ALL.

You can google the story. I'm too disgusted to post the link here."

My cube-mate at work cracks me up.

He was explaining a recent complaint from a customer in which they said that they thought if they stopped using the credit card, they wouldn't have to make payments or be charged late fees.

Then he said...

""Lady, this is your credit card agreement. It has lots of words.

These things, words... when you bunch them together, they make sentences.

Sentences tell you things, sometimes very important things. You should try looking at the sentences on your credit card agreement...""

Take this kiss upon the brow
And in parting from you now
Thus much let me avow
You are not wrong, who deem
That my days have been a dream
Yet if hope has flown away
In a night or in a day
In a vision or in none
Is it therefore the less gone
All that we see or seem
All that we see or seem
Is but a dream within a dream

I stand amid the roar
Of a surf tormented shore
And I hold within my hands
Grains of the golden sand
Oh how they creep
Through my fingers to the deep
While I weep while I weep
Oh God can I not grasp
Them with a tighter clasp
Oh God can I not save
One from the pitiless wave
Is all that we see or seem
Is all that we see or seem
But a dream within a dream
Dream, dream, dream ..."

"event","so my day?... it was alright normal monday night... group therapy at 6 till 7:30 and now waiting for my companys arival.

nothing really on my mind exsept my arms feel extra jigly today... im guessing its the whole drinking alot of soda n being a lazy slob... i thought theese meds where suppost to give me energy... god i may as well do real speed haha... fuck that im to crazy already to turn into a tweaker.

me and kt where talking today about how everything ust to be so wonderfull, and care free, and mellow, people still got along and where some what trust worthy... either that or we where to happy/blind to see the bad around us. its never good to dwell in the past tho... things will never be the same... but new good memorys can easly be arranged.

people are really startin to get on my nerves... i need a break from civilization just one day... but its highly impossible in the winter time... people tend to flock to my house... seen as its the closest worm thing to towson... im scared ill flip out on people again if i dont get my space because im getting really aggitated not really for anyreason.

have you ever walked bye some one and imageind they where talking about you, or walked in a room and feel like every one is against you? i feel it almost everyday... its a sick feeling in ur gut... and i question is it all in my head?

EVERY tihng is fucked up now some how... back stabbing, lack of trust, and not knowing weither or not the people u hang  out with are your friends or just some one to get fucked up with... people say its just a faze, you will grow out of it... or is it just this town? i want to go to a place where every one is honest about how they feel, and no lies are told... im just scared that if i stay here forever that ill loose all my ""spunk""... like im a burning candle and this place is trying to put out my flaim... haha wtf... i dont really care these are just thoughts... and this is just my journal...

I'm one confused mother fucker... i just want to be loved and give love back... i love to love... not even in a sexual way... im talking friendship love... totaly hippie core!!

(p.s. im alright so dont tell me to feel better... just tell me if u agree or disagree... i want feed back not pity tis all)

im stuck on this ideal best friend... one you talk to all the time, and hang out with a fuck load, and knows everything about you, and can tell when you need to be helped. 

but ive been shitty to. real fucking shitty. im not gonna say sorry cause i learned from my child hood that sorry doesnt mean shit. its just a word to make things better, but things never get better unless you change. sucks that the thing i haft to change is... being honest about  how i feel, even tho how i feel is a reaction of pure bull shit, the bullshit that is only in my head. 





how am i gonna dig myself out of this... i cant... and even if i get forgivin... i will not except it... i dont even forgive myself.

"event","girl and guy were speeding over 100 mph on the road on a motorcycle...

Girl: Slow down. Im scared.
Guy: No this is fun.
Girl: No its not. Please, its too scary!
Guy: Then tell me you love me.
Girl: Fine, I love you. Slow down!
Guy: Now give me a BIG hug.
*Girl hugs him*
Guy: Can you take my helmet off & put it on yourself? Its bugging me.

(In the paper the next day):

A motorcycle had crashed into a building because of break failure. 2 people were on it, but only 1 survived. The truth was that halfway down the road, the guy realized that his breaks broke, but he didn't want to let the girl know. Instead, he had her say she loved him & felt her hug one last time, then had her wear his helmet so that she would live even though it meant that he would die.

today was the first day in a long time ive takeing my medicine and tomorrow will hopefully be the secound... i had to put aside the fact that i hate pills and i hate how they can be addicting but then realizing if to get addicted to anything else why not it be something that sets me straight...helps me threw every day...

i wanted to write back to each and every one of you that commented and tell you how thank full i am that you guys do care...and i care about you alla lot i just need to deal with stuff in my head now... i guess i just thought since people arent around n we that dont talk much that people dont care but every one has there own lives... i just want to see you all more... at leats every once in a while... but i decided i didnt want the comments to be seen i wanted to keep it to myself... and commenting back would unscreen it.

FEELING BETTER for now and remembering the few that care and never forgetting they where there <3"

jesus christ is there any day i get threw with out crying??

im so tired of being sick mentally n physically... i need help or a friend that actually REALLY cares... not only says they do but shows it...

im so incredably close to going back to ""ED"" i dont know how long i can hold back... its been to long... and im a faliur...

i balled today on maggies back porch cause i couldnt stop thinking about how some one had told me shannon was a foxx n it wasent the first time... n i obsessed over the fact that im so discusting and it was just like wrong timeing i havent felt ok with myself in soo long not since i got my first taste of ""meaningless sex""... it makes me not want her to be around me cause ill feel like im the ugliest person in the world when she did nothing besides be perfect... i need help... i keep getting sicker and sicker... but only in my low slopes... when im getting a taste of happyness it freaks people out in a way they love... to bad im only happy half of each day... the other half... feeling only pain... 

i dont know why i cant get over anything... i dont know why every thing is a big deal to me... and when im on drugs im fine... every thing is fine i dont want to end up like my dad... chooseing an addiction over my family then quiting and looking at every thing i had lost... going down the wrong path then trying to go up the rite one realizing that i can never have would i could have.

im fucking crying out loud to people and they think i just want pitty i dont give a shit about pitty i want fucking help... i need help... i need to be helped... and no one is helping me... and i am way past the point where i could help myself...

i picture myself laying in my bed tonight like every other night... numb... face so wet from the tears... and my brain and heart on a one on one fight to the death... just waiting for my mood to swith... waiting for the next swing and hopeing its a good one not a bad one.

i dont remeber why i stopped takeing my meds... and i dont know why  i wont take them... im almost affraid to...

im so scared now... i ust to be possitive, i ust to be happy,  i ust to not care,  i ust to be forgiving, i ust to be giveing, i ust to go to school... i dont knwo why i am not anymore... i dont know whats happening... i only know its gonna get worse and im only scared... 

i need some false happyness... they say you cannot love until you love yourself... i find that complete bull shit... i havent loves myself in years... and ive had several exsperiences in love and i wa shappy for as long as it lasted in each one... ide face anything to be happy... and being liked bye someone i liek is one of the only things that makes ma happy... i could back this up on to as why but i dont really want to...

I dont exspect anyone to write anything back to me... i already know that my pain means nothing to anyone... 

no one understands how much i care about them... but i only show my love if they show me love first that way i wont be the only oe putting it out... what a horrible thing to teach ur self... how completely selfish... 

i know where i went wrong... i went wrong on giveing up on people to finally give back what i have givein out... so i shut myself down... i changed all the good things about me into bad...

myabe its all in my hea di dont even know what the hells going on anymore...

I DONT KNOW WHAT REAL WHATS FAKE... I CANT TELL IF THE THINGs IN MY HEAD ARE REAL OR FROM MYSICKNESS... I CANT TELL IF THIS IS HOW I REALLY FEAL OR IF ITS JUST FROM THE MOOD IM IN...

i want a logical exsplanation why people have mood swings...

i want people to be honest but i cant handle the truth...

im not really sure what i want but I NEED TO BE LOVED and i know that for a fact... im only scared that no one could ever love me...

theese are only haft the thing that go threw my head at night and not even as deep...

*you think i dont hide my depression well enough... well then youde hate me if i didnt hide any of it at all*

"event","I want to talk about Paranormal Activity. I really enjoyed it but I'm not gonna try to convince you to go see it one way or the other. There are gonna be some people who just won't like it. There are gonna be some people who go into it with such high expectations that anything will be a disappointment. There are gonna be some people who make a big show of how LAME something scary is so their buddies won't think they are weak. There are gonna be some people who automatically dislike anything embraced the the general public.

I will say that it is the kind of thing that is better in a theater full of screaming, freaked out people. And there WERE screaming, freaked out people at the showing I attended. Those commercials aren't all hype. I saw Blair Witch at the theater and it was much more effective on the big screen. I have a feeling this will be a similar sort of thing.

There is a catch though. Those of you who watch Ghost Hunters and shows of that nature will be familiar with straining to focus your ears to hear the various thuds, rattles, and knocks that ghosts seem to be so fond of. This is a very sound oriented movie. The downside to seeing it in the theater is that in addition to the ghostly thuds, rattles, and knocks you will also hear every candy wrapper crinkle, slurping drinker, and every bit of whispered conversation in the audience.

So, it is a bit of a trade off. You get the benefit of the presence of a group of people but you also get the annoyances."

"event","Thursday was my birthday. I'm 33 years old. I swear I never expected to live this long.

It was a nice day. I opened some really nice gifts(thanks Keith and Annie), had pizza, and watched movies.

My sister came in today and brought the nieces. We went to Five Guys and I had another delicious birthday dinner. After we ate we headed over to the movie theater and saw Where the Wild Things Are. It made me cry. Leslie and the girls left for home after that and Mom and I stayed to see Paranormal Activity. A very satisfying, if somewhat disorienting, double feature."

"event","I'm gonna try to start posting in this thing more often. I spend a lot of time fartin' around on Facebook these days but I usually just play games and stuff on there. I'm gonna talk about my visit to Alcatraz. I know there are a couple people on here with an interest in exploring creepy old places.

The boat ride over to the island is really worth the price of admission. I was afraid I would get seasick but it really didn't bother me at all. There are some absolutely priceless photo opportunities. Great views of the city, Coit Tower, both the Bay Bridge and the Golden Gate off in the distance.

We did the evening tour and we got to Alcatraz just as the sun was starting to set. It was a little more expensive but I really think the sun would have been too intense earlier in the day. It was just right when we were there. The ride back was a little chilly but it was a small price to pay.

You start out down below where they had a school then you make your way up the long incline to the prison itself. You enter into what was the receiving area. It was a large room with a shower area in the center. The men would be stripped and washed down then would proceed over to the outer areas of the room to get their bedding and stuff. Then they were marched to their cell while still nude. It must have been absolutely terrifying.

I expected the place to be pretty creepy, and parts were, but the actual cells were more interesting than anything. The dining area was a bit creepy though. I think maybe any area were a large group of people gather and socialize like that is always creepy when it is empty. It is very live and electric when it is full of people and that lingers. It is a bit like being in a school after hours. It just doesn't feel right.

The only part that really gave me the willies was the upstairs medical area. Just seeing the stainless steel operating table and the period wheelchairs and equipment was enough to put a little knock in my knees.

Alcatraz really is beautiful in a lot of ways. It is also a place that you can't take lightly. I was really glad I went."

The worst one so far was probably Zatoichi and the Chess Expert. I didn't like the way it was directed and the storyline was sorta all over the place. It still had enough good stuff in it to make it better than most movies though.

I am at 115 movies total for the year. Behind schedule but that is nothing new. I think I do better when I have a theme or some sort of guidelines to go by. I usually start flipping through my DVD books and everything and nothing looks good. I just can't decide on anything and I sit there thinking it over for so long that I lose interest in watching a movie. I know it sounds ridiculous but I do it ALL the time."

"event","My mother presented me with a gift a couple days ago. <a href=""https://www.bigcityslider.com/flare/next"" target=""_blank"">The Big City Slider Station</a>. You may have seen it advertised on television by the great Billy Mays. It is actually a pretty cool little thing. It makes little slider burgers. It is easy to use and I don't know if it is the size of the meat or the way it cooks or what but the things taste really good. I read some reviews around online and apparently the nonstick surface starts flaking off into your hamburgers after you use it a few times. That is kind of a bummer.

In other burgers news, I also ordered myself a burger press today. You put the meat into it and it forms a perfect little patty. I've always hated doing that part by hand so I'm pretty excited to try it out.

I've been doing a fair amount of reading lately. I picked up the first two Dexter books. I've never seen the show so I don't know how they compare but I finished the first one and really enjoyed it.

I also read <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Criminal-Macabre-Complete-McDonald-Stories/dp/159582118X/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1242625549&sr=8-2"" target=""_blank"">Criminal Macabre</a> by Steve Niles. It was a lot of fun. It is a private investigator who is sort of in the vein of John Constantine. He handles cases involving zombies and vampires andr werewolves and all manner of other kinds of weird shit. He also has a pretty severe drug habit but I guess you can't really blame him for that.

I had mixed feelings about <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/MULCHING-AMERICA-Novel-Harry-Crews/dp/0684825414/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1242625758&sr=8-1"" target=""_blank"">The Mulching of America</a> by Harry Crews. Crews is really one of my favorite authors and there are a lot of great parts in this book but it started going off the rails a little towards the middle then completely fell apart at the end. It is still worth reading because like I said, it does have some great stuff in there and even when it is bad it is still Harry Crews."

I have to say that I am sad to see Geocities go. I know a lot of people think of it as sort of a joke but it really opened the up internet and allowed a lot of people to create their own page without knowing HTML and all that sort of thing. A big chunk of internet history is going to go down the tubes when Geocities is gone.

And, on a personal level, I'll be sad to see my own little page go. It has a special place in my heart because I co-created it with <lj user=""devil_bunny71"">.  This was during a very bad time in my life and her friendship, along with the site, got me through a lot of sleepless nights that would have otherwise been spent in deep depression doing God knows what.

I do have to say that it sorta creeped me out a little when I looked at the stats page for the account though. It appears that the number one search phrase entered into Google that brought people to the review for Kikujiro was ""enema little boy."" Yikes."

I was out behind my house yesterday doing the thing that I go back there to do (cryptic eh?) and had an encounter with one of mankind's deadliest natural predators - the  dreaded gray squirrel. There is a sort of tin outcropping underneath the guttering back there. I don't even really know what purpose it serves but it is open on the ends and forms sort of a little tunnel. I was standing with my face literally 3 foot away from the opening and the squirrel poked his little head right out of there. I froze, partly so I could watch him without scaring him and partly because I had my tender vittles exposed and I didn't want him to do anything rash like maybe dive and latch on to them. There ended up being two of them in there and I stood and watched them for a long time. They either couldn't smell me for some reason or were relatively tame. I finally moved my hand and it must have made a sound and they both took off over the roof like a couple of little gray rockets. It was nice while it lasted."

"event","I've been reading Lovecraft. I sorta dabbled in his stuff a bit when I was in my early teens and didn't really care for it at all. I found a couple annotated volumes of his work at my local used book store and decided to give him another shot. I'm really glad that I did. I think being older has given me a lot more appreciation for his writing. The annotations so far are mostly useless but it is nice to have the option.

Ghost Hunters is treading on thin ice with me. There is already a lingering taint left from last year's live Halloween show. Like I said back then, I didn't believe everything they presented as evidence...but I believed that they believed it. The confidence that I had in those guys was the entire backbone of what made me enjoy the show. I didn't have to believe in what they found because I knew THEY believed in it and it was fun just to watch them explore and do their thing. That whole Halloween debacle made me really question that for the first time. I find myself looking for the con and it takes a lot of the fun out of it. 

And now, we have this past week's episode. Jay and Grant went in together to buy a hotel or inn or whatever and surprise, surprise...the place may be haunted! The way that I understood it was they didn't know it was supposed to be haunted until they bought it and started renovating the place. What's the odds? I mean, even if you totally believe in hauntings 100% what are the odds of these guys stumbling upon a haunted place like that? Pretty fucking slim. They made a big deal out of bringing in a non-biased group to investigate so people wouldn't think there was any funny business going on. Of course, this non biased group was the Ghost Hunters International team. Uh, yeah...sure."

"event","Today was a pretty shit day for a lot of reasons. It was one of those days when I just wanted to crawl back in bed so that is just what I did. The cat almost immediately puked on me. It wasn't one of those wussy hairball pukes neither. It was like somebody poured a bucket of hot oatmeal on my stomach. And, to complete the picture, let me remind those of you who don't know...I've got a really hairy stomach.

I was in K-Mart and saw a father leading his little girl around the store. She was just talking away to him a mile a minute. He was bragging on his cell phone to somebody about his new 4 wheel drive. Totally ignoring her. I just thought about how in 10 years he will be begging her to talk to him.

I've been slacking a little on my movie watching. I started one the other night called Death Note. I ended up just putting it right back into the envelope and sending it back to Netflix. I really should have known better because it is based off an anime and I've never had any great fondness for that stuff. The synopsis sounded good though so I gave it a shot. It has one of the most ridiculous looking CGI creatures in it that I've ever laid eyes on. It was just too much to take.

I did see a pretty good documentary called Blindsight. The first blind man to summit Everest gets together with a group of blind Tibetan children and attempts to take them to the top of one of the lesser peaks just below Everest. That alone is pretty powerful stuff but when you see how hard blind people have it in Tibet it becomes even more poignant. They are really treated like shit over there. It eventually turns into something a little more than all that but I'll let you guys discover exactly what it is for yourselves."

I never would have picked it up but a while back <lj user=""chibimermaid""> mentioned something about it that really piqued my interest. She told how Houdini was shackled and placed inside the carcass of a ""sea monster"" for an escape. It made me wonder if there was not more to this Houdini fella than I realized.

I never realized how much of his escape routines were real. A lot of it was stage magic with rigged containers and things of that nature...but a lot of it was just him using his own athleticism and highly practiced techniques to escape. I was really impressed with some of the stuff he pulled off. And, when the stunt was rigged in some way, Houdini pretty much invented all his own gimmicked devices. He put an unbelievable amount of effort into putting that stuff together.

The latter part of the book deals a lot with his efforts to battle false mediums and the rise of Spirituality. While his escapes impressed me, it was this part of the book that really made me a Houdini fan. He would expose the tricks mediums used to con people out of money. The dark room seances, the table rapping and bell ringing, the automatic writing, the uh...ectoplasm leaking vaginas. He really went after these mediums who were taking advantage of bereaved and desperate people.

As fascinating as this part of the book was, it was a little hard for me to read in places. I am a HUGE Sherlock Holmes fan. I knew Arthur Conan Doyle was into Spiritualism but I never realized what a nutty fruitcake bastard he was. It is hard for me to believe that this man who wrote these stories that were so steeped in logic could go for some of the weird shit that he went for. Then again, maybe it does make sense. Spiritualism was ""evidence"" of the afterlife. It was faked evidence that he should have known better than to accept...but it probably seemed more concrete than what was offered by other religions. It wasn't based on faith. You could see and hear the results with your own eyes and ears. I don't see how anybody can be so smart and do dumb all at the same time."

"event","I've had a scene in my head for the past couple days and can't remember what it is from to save my life. The really bad part is I can't even remember if it is from a book, movie, or tv show. I have the feeling it is going to be something very obvious and I'll feel like a jackass but here goes.

It is a guy who is out hunting and kills a deer or something else along those lines. I THINK it was some sort of survival situation and he was desperate for food. So, he kills the animal but it is his first time and he has never cleaned one before. I think he had a book or something but didn't have it on him. Maybe somebody had told him how to do it. I don't remember. The point is he was just sorta flying by ear and he ended up being too slow. The blood settled in the meat or flies got to it or something. He couldn't even use the meat after all the effort. I don't remember if this was actually how he felt or if it was just my own feeling but I remember it being really sad that he killed the animal for nothing.

Any ideas?"

"event","I love the movie Peggy Sue Got Married. I never really paid a lot of attention to the cover art for the movie though. I was looking at it this morning and realized how weird it is. The background is a lot of clouds and slightly off center in the middle is Peggy Sue peering through this enormous keyhole. She has a key in her hand and a creepy Mona Lisa-esque smirk on her face. Now, either the keyhole is waaay too large for the key she is holding or our eye is pressed right up against the opening to make it look so large. Judging by the look on her face I believe it to be the latter and she is really excited about hearing the squishy pop our eyeball makes when she jams that key into it.

I finally found an onion that could make me cry. I love onions and have been cutting them for 20 years. This is the first one that ever made me cry. It was so powerful. They bought it at Wal-Mart. It probably came from India or Uganda or somewhere."

"event","We had a nice Easter family thing yesterday. Leslie and my nieces came in and we had a cookout. Hiding eggs is as much fun as hunting them. The girls really got into it. Their little eyes would light up and here they would go.

After we ate the girls wanted to play hide and seek. I was usually ""it"" so I spent a lot of time walking around pretending like I couldn't find them. I'd shake bushes and look up into trees and ask if they were up in the top. They were giggling and laughing the entire time. I hope they are never in a combat situation where silence is key to survival. Then it was finally my turn to hide. They counted and I got behind a bush and waited for them to find me...and waited...and waited. It turns out they told me to hide then went inside to eat candy.

It was a good time but all that running around has left me so stoved up I can barely walk. A small price to pay."

"event","I watched a good horror movie this morning. It is called <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0808542/"" target=""_blank"">With You</a>. It is a low budget indie sorta ghost story. A lot of people will see the unpolished acting and SOV look of the thing and be turned off but they will be missing one of the most legitimately creepy movies I've seen in quite a while. There were several times during this movie that I literally had a cold chill run through me. I honestly can't remember the last time that happened. I'll leave it up to you to decide if that is a recommendation or a warning.

Tonight I watched <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0443435/"" target=""_blank"">Autopsy</a>. It is one of the 8 Movies to Die For from earlier this year. I think horror fans will probably like it pretty well. Nothing too great or groundbreaking is going on but there are some nice gore scenes and a creepy hospital location. It won't change your life but you probably won't feel like you wasted your time watching it neither.

Autopsy was the second of the 8 Movies to Die For that I've seen. <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0906734/"" target=""_blank"">The Broken</a> was the first and it was an entirely different sort of movie. Where Autopsy is a stalk and chase bloody mess The Broken is a much more deliberately paced, almost entirely gore free affair. The idea is to establish a creepy air of weirdness and tension that slowly builds to a bang at the end. I usually enjoy these slowburn type movies but this one suffers from one pretty major flaw. To be successful they needed to keep the audience as in the dark as the protagonist was and slowly drop clues as to what was going on along the way. It keeps the audience invested in what is going on and helps them identify with the character in the movie. There is one brief scene right at the first of the movie that reveals a key fact that pretty much destroys a lot of the mystery. When the weirdness does kick in this information allows you to figure out what is going on almost immediately. So, you spend the next hour or so watching the heroine struggle and desperately try to catch up to what you already know. Still, it is a technically well made movie. It looks great and Lena Headey is a pretty good actress. There is one bit of acting that she pulls off near the end that is really effective. It could have been great with a little editing but the way it is the end result is going to bore more people than it frightens.

Here is my updated movie list for this year so far. It's not that I really think any of you care what I watch. I'm just deathly paranoid of something happening to my list and I won't have a backup.

"event","There was a show I used to watch. I'm almost positive it was on Nickelodeon and it would have been mid to late 90's. It was some sort of school based show. The only thing I really remember about it was the school principal. He was a smallish skinny man with a large bulbous bald head. The kind of bald where you still have hair on the sides of your head. Looks kinda like an egg being squeezed out of a bird's ass. He had a really nasal annoying tone to his voice. He really reminds me of Mr Burns from The Simpsons come to life. I can see and hear him in my mind as clear as a bell but remember nothing else about the show. Any ideas what the title was?

I don't want to give away the plot, and I would warn you not to go read too much about it online. There are a lot of spoilers out there and it is really a movie you need to go into fresh. I will say that there is an interesting shift in direction about halfway into it that sorta threw me for a loop. I will also say that there was a point where I really just wanted to turn the movie off. It gets to be a bit much but then the ending pulls it back together and gives meaning to it all. I'm sure it will get an American DVD release at some point. I expect Dimension Extreme will snap it up. I'm really interested to see what people have to say about this movie."

If I can keep up this pace I might actually make my goal of 365 movies this year.

"event","I am fascinated with the concept of our place in time. The fact that we occupy a place in the here and now that many other people passed through before. I was just lying in bed listening to the various sounds of the night and thought about what it sounded like to people in the past. This house is over 100 years old and I thought about how different it must have sounded for people back then. 

I think the world is probably a lot noisier place nowadays. I have the grinding sound coming from my computer as it does a virus scan. I have the intermittent hum of the fan on my heater kicking on and off. I could hear cars going past down on the main highway. They didn't have cars in the distant past of course but I think about people who lived 50 years ago. There wouldn't have been anywhere near the number of cars on the road as there are now so it wouldn't have been a nearly constant stream like I am hearing. There certainly wouldn't have been many people out at 3 am. Not here in Oliver Springs anyway. I'll bet when they did hear one it sounded different than cars do now anyway. I don't know much about cars but I'll bet things like a catalytic converter have an effect on the sound the car makes.

I thought about how quiet things must have been back then. None of these things I'm hearing would have been present. It would have been just that kind of silence that lays over you like a blanket. That kind of silence that is actually an uncomfortable experience for most modern people. Then, somewhere off in the distance, I heard a dog barking. I couldn't tell exactly where it was coming from but it was really raising hell and it was echoing through the ridges and valleys here. That was the one thing that I couldn't dismiss. It was as likely to hear a barking dog 100 years ago as it is now. Maybe even moreso. A lot of people had hunting dogs back then. That dog was the one thing that tied it all together for me. It married the present to the past and was weirdly comforting to me."

"event","The first episode of the new season of The Amazing Race was on tonight. It was pretty...well, amazing. I think this is gonna be a good season.

I watched Changeling the other night. I'm not much of an Angelina Jolie fan but it was alright. She looks like shit though. The movie sorta loses direction in the middle somewhere and just drags on for a lot longer than it needed to. It is a really interesting story though and has some great period sets and costume work.

I read the autobiography of Jerry The King Lawler. It was a bit of a disappointment. I loved wrestling as a kid and I've always liked Jerry. I liked watching him wrestle and he was always amazing on the mic. He would also throw fireballs in people's faces and that just rocked my world. He really comes off as a bit of a douchebag in this book though. He really isn't very likeable. It's a real shame.

I went to the book store today to trade in a few things. I got to the door the same time as a little old lady using one of those walker/step/chair things. I held the door open for her and she thanked me. She got into the store and started having some very obvious respiratory distress. It really sounded scary. I didn't want to embarass her by staring or asking if she was ok so I just kinda watched out of the corner of my eye. I kept expecting her to just toss over off her seat and I was gonna try to cushion her landing. Both my grandfathers had lung cancer and one of them got really bad with it before he died. I don't remember either of them sounding as bad as this woman. It was really sad.

I've been playing a lot of Oblivion on the Xbox...and when I say ""a lot"" I mean I had a dream where my cat Fruity was my guildmaster and she was giving me tasks to carry out. I don't remember what the tasks were but I'll bet they had something to do with head rubs."

I ALSO found out that not only has a new season of Solitary been going on but I Love Money is back on as well. I'm gonna be a busy little beaver.

Rocknrolla is pretty good. Not as good as Lock,Stock or Snatch but still a lot of fun and full of interesting characters. It has a pretty amazing soundtrack too.

Burn After Reading was...weird. When I first started watching it I didn't like it at all but it grew on me as it went along. I think the problem was that there was a strange kind of disconnect going on. I mean, it was like there was a wall between me and the movie. It is really a depressing movie full of these miserable fucked up people.

I enjoyed The Midnight Meat Train. It has a lot of style and is bloody as hell. I mean it has some blood geysers right out of a 70's era samurai movie. Vinnie Jones is pretty great in his role as well. The writing isn't as impressive. It does a poor job of explaining what the heck is going on. I don't need my hand held but I would like SOME explanation. I would have been utterly baffled if I hadn't read the short story it is based on."

"event","So much has gone on in the last 3 months since I wrote in this journal! Started my senior year of college, moved in with some new (and some old) roommates, and have just been living it up with my Gamma Phi girls and the Delta Chi boys, especially my favorite...
The freaking out about graduating subsided for awhile but don't worry, it's back in full force. I am worrying that the real world isn't as friendly of a place as I would like it to be, and it's a lot more expensive than I can afford! So, I will be going back to Plano to take up residence w/ the rents after I graduate in May. Kristin and I thought it would be fun to get an apartment together, but let's be honest, that would be the messiest apartment on the face of the planet! I love you K. 
I'm headed home for Thanksgiving on Tuesday. Hopefully I'll get to see some of the old gang while I'm there, minus Leen unfortunately. I'm going to see Cirque du Soleil with Todd and his family on Friday after Thanksgiving, very excited. Then when we get back there's only 2 1/2 weeks til Christmas break! I have the privilege of taking Wintermester at Collin County though, get excited. Not to worry, I'll still have plenty of time to live it up for one last Christmas break...
So, long story short, nothing is really that new or interesting in my life! I guess 3 months doesn't change much!

"event","Yes, it's true. I will be moving back to that glorious greater Bryan College Station metropolis three weeks from Friday. I am SO excited! Don't get me wrong, it's been really nice being at home. I'm lucky that going home is not torturous for me like it is for some people. My parents are pretty cool (despite what I tell them ;) ), my job is going well, I've gotten to see some old friends, and I get all the luxuries of home (aka lots of good food, shopping, and plenty of TLC). BUT Aggieland is home to me too. I don't think the percentage of nice people is higher anywhere in the world. That place has become home to me over the last 3 years and much like I was sad to leave Plano when I graduated, I will be sad to leave CS next May when I graduate from A&M. Who knows where I will end up, but chances are it won't be in BCS, not a huge economy there...

I talked to my sister tonight about being freaked out beyond belief about not knowing what I'm going to do when I graduate and she reassured me that most people don't really know and that even if you do know what you're going to do you could end up doing something else. So, for the time being, my fears have been calmed in that arena. 

On a completely different subject, I can't stand guys that think ""nice guys finish last."" That is so not true. Girls may say that they want the bad boys, but when it comes down to it, we really do want the sweet guy that will treat us right and isn't afraid to admit it. So for all you nice guys out there, don't stop being nice. The world could use lots more of you ;)

That's all I got for the night folks. Anyone for Usher Aug. 12th? Seriously, I have FREE box tickets. Let me know...

"event","So, I know this is Texas and all, but seriously?! I couldn't even sit outside on the patio in the shade without breaking a sweat. I forgot how much I hate summers in Dallas...

So the summer is coming to an end. Only a few more days of work. The bosses are taking Lizzy (the other girl that works at the store) and I to Hotel Zaza for dinner on Thursday. Now I can say I've eaten at the hotel where Jessica Simpson stays when she comes to Dallas! Guess I'll have to break out the good manners! 

The packing has begun. I cannot even express how much I hate packing and unpacking, although it is much better moving in than moving out. I'm getting really excited about the new apartment. Should be lots of fun.

What else...I hate boys. Some in particular. Mostly just ones that either say they're going to call and don't, or don't return phone calls. They know who they are. Then on the other hand there are the wonderful ones that I have gotten to spend time with this summer. You know who you are too. I love you guys to death, I don't know what I would have done this summer without you. And don't forget about our pinky swear... ;)

Ok so the official countdown goes as this:
10 days til Usher w/ Joe and Christine
11 days til I move back to College Station
28 days til my LAST fall semester starts
52 days til I get my Fightin' Texas Aggie Ring! WHOOP! 

Quote of the day:
""Meeting people who like you, who understand you, who actually accept you for who you are will become an increasingly rare occurance. These people who contributed to who I am, they are with me wherever I go, and as history gets rewritten in small ways with each passing day, my love for them only grows. Because the truth is, it was the best of times. Mistakes were made, hearts were broken, harsh lessons learned, but all of that has receded into fond memory now. How does it happen? Why are we so quick to romanticize the good and forget the bad? Maybe it's because we need to believe that the time we spent together actually meant something, that we were there for each other in a time that defined us all, a time in our lives that we will never forget..."""

"event","Wow! I haven't updated this thing in over 2 weeks! That's just crazy! Guess I gotta give a Cliff's Notes version of what's been going on with me!

Fourth of July weekend...interesting, but lot's of fun. Got to see some of my very favorite people, hit up 6th Street in Austin, went out on the lake, saw some fireworks from Kris's apartment, all around good times.

So I was babysitting a few weeks ago and the father came home and randomly offered me tickets to Usher next month. Not only does he offer me 1 ticket, but 4! And these are not your average seats either, we're talking the Coke suite with all the free food and drinks! Not too shabby! Anyone want to go to Usher??

For the last week I have been in Cape Cod with my immediate and extended family. Wow. Not enough words to describe that group. Let's just say there is never a dull moment!! It was lots of fun, I got to lay on the beach, shop, and eat, does a vacation get much better than that!? The Cape is beautiful. I wouldn't mind spending more time there, it can be quiet at times, but its still really nice. Maybe I'll get a summer home there one day...But let me just say that the water was FREEZING! I don't think it got above 60 degrees while we were there. Needless to say I sat my happy ass down on the sand and caught some rays. I'm still a little pink, but I have to have something to show from vacation, right?! My family cracks me up. It was fun to see them, although it always makes me feel old, I remember holding some of these now high schoolers as babies. And my youngest cousin (after seeing me with a bottle in my hand) kept asking me if I was ""old enough to drink alcohol"" and when I would say yes she'd say, ""But are you a grown-up???"" as if it were the most unfathomable concept ever. Wow, I AM old. 

On that note, am I really graduating from college in 10 months? That's just about the scariest thing in the world. I am so not ready. What am I going to do with a degree in Journalism when I don't want to write or do broadcast?? And should I go to grad school? Could I get IN to grad school? Could I AFFORD grad school? And if I could, what would I get a degree in? Too much to think about right now, unfortunately the day for those decisions is rapidly approaching...I'll keep you posted.

Last and final thought of the evening: I AM MOVING BACK TO COLLEGE STATION IN 26 DAYS! Get excited because I am ready to see everyone and get back to our old tricks! That means you Reboppa!! 

You're in luck because there are 2 quotes of the day! The first is from an oldie but goodie:
""You know that place between awake and asleep, that place where you still remember dreaming? That's where I'll always love you."" -Tinkerbell, ""Hook""

The second is a shout out to all my camp friends (especially Val) and anyone else that thinks Brian Fellows is damn funny:
""What's wrong with your dog?!"" (seeing the guest come out with a Shetland pony)"

"event","It's been a few days! Nothing too exciting has happened...I saw Fahrenheit 9/11 on Monday, wow, that movie was interesting, and very emotional in parts. I definitely recommend seeing in, whether you like Bush or not. I also somehow talked Andrew and Daniel into seeing The Notebook with me. I am such a sucker for movies like that! Of course I cried like an idiot, but that's ok.

Hung out with the boys again last night, Army is leaving for several weeks so we were saying bye to him. I love those boys. It's funny how we have watched each other become different people over the years but are still all good friends and get along and have a good time! 

Well, it is the 4th of July weekend and I am headed out to Lake Travis to see some of my FAVORITE people in the world!! It has been 2 months since I've seen Christine and Joe, and that is just unacceptable! ;) But I am SOO soo excited, there should definitely be some good material for future journal entries!

Quote of the day is stolen from Kristin, and I think it is very true...

"event","Oh my gosh, a day off! Granted, I didn't work lots of days in a row, but when you are ""in charge"" it makes it seem like much more work! Yesterday was a beating. I got to work at 10:15, closed the store at 5:15, and babysat from 6:30 to 12:15...such a long day! But for once my bank account has a (+) in front of the numbers instead of a (-) so I'm not complaining....

STILL haven't seen The Notebook! Daddy is taking me to see Farenheit 9/11 tomorrow though so that should be fun. So much controversy surrounding that movie, I am very interested to see it.

Didn't do a whole lot today. Ran some errands, took a nap, layed out by the pool. WHEN is it going to stop raining!? The sun finally came out at like 5 this afternoon but by then we had lost most of the light in the backyard! Oh, what troubles I have...

So 2 weeks from today I will be laying on the beach in Cape Cod! I am so excited! Every year my mom's whole family (she's one of 11 children) goes up there and rents houses for a week. We go kayaking, bike riding, take day trips to Martha's Vineyard, and one of the nights we do a lobster bake. Even though I have lived in Texas for 11 years I think I am still partly a Yankee at heart. 

What else?? I am starting to freak out about starting my senior year of college, but that will be a completely different journal entry. I am, however, looking forward to Kristin and Julie Do Europe, Summer '05!! They won't know what hit 'em! ;)

Quote of the day is more like conversation of the day and it went a little something like this.... 

Kristin: I thought you said brother!? And I was like what??
Me: yeah, didn't you know I had a brother?
Kristin: that would make it easier for us to be sisters in law
Me: yeah it would, but what if he was like a huge nerd, then I wouldn't wish him on you
Kristin: then we'd give him to Kimberly, duh
Me: that still wouldn't make us sisters in law?!
Kristin: really? close enough...

I love that girl to death!!"

"event","So it seems like I have been working like crazy lately, but it was a lot of fun at our party today. We ate pizza, drank bellinis, and did really good business. Needless to say, I am EXHAUSTED!! Being charming is hard work! ;)

I wish I could say, ""Oh well, at least tomorrow is Saturday."" Be that as it may, I will still be up to open the store and after a full day at work I get to go straight to babysitting! This may be a lucrative weekend, but not an enjoyable one!

I am so sad that I didn't get to see either The Notebook OR Farenheit 9/11 today! I pride myself on being one of the first to see most sappy chick flicks! I must be slipping...

Wow, next weekend is the 4th of July! That is crazy! I love the 4th though, fireworks and cookouts and getting drunk, doesn't get much more American that that.

I can't believe I've been home for like 6 weeks! Only 7 more weeks and I will be moving back to College Station, WHOOP! I CANNOT wait to move back in with Sara and to get to live with Erin for the first time! I love those girls to death!! We are gonna have a LOT of fun! 

Ok, time to watch Friends and go to bed. Is this what my life has become?!

Bellinger and I need to stop talking about relationships and the opposite sex. I think all we do is either depress or enfuriate each other! Lol, we could make a career out of bitching, but it can be therapeutic :)

Tomorrow starts a long couple of days at work. The owners are out of the store at market so it's just us girls! Are they out of their ever-loving minds to give ME the keys to the store!? That's just asking for a call to the fire department, ambulance, police or all of the above. Just kidding of course!

Now I'm gonna go ahead and be controversial...Farenheit 9/11 opens at the Angelika this Friday and I am definitely going to see it. Apparently it does not show Bush in a positive light, but for those of you who think that people who don't kiss the ground Bush walks on are going to burn in hell, don't get your panties in a wad. It is not that I don't think Bush is a man of good morals, or a man of God, or an overall good guy in general. I am just interested to see Michael Moore's interpretation. I mean, what good is it to live in this country if you can't be free to express your opinions without fear of what others will say or do or think? 

On a much less serious note, WHO WANTS TO GO SEE THE NOTEBOOK ON FRIDAY?! I love me some Nicholas Sparks!

"event","Ok, so it's been several days, but don't you worry your pretty little heads, I'm still alive and kickin'. And since I have people like Army, Chuck and Reboppa still reading, I might as well share what's been going on with me lately!

So I don't have to work again until Wednesday so that was definitely some good news! But that just means I work Weds-Sun, more good news though: WE'RE HAVING A BELLINI MACHINE AT THE STORE ALL DAY FRIDAY! Whoop for that! Pretty sure I've never worked drunk before, we shall see....

Kristin is in town! Yay for that too! I love that girl! Only got to see her briefly b/c we had company in town but I had to meet and ""approve"" the new boy in her life. I find it highly amusing that we do not consider dating people unless they have the other's approval! He definitely has mine, which is not easy, I am very protective of her! I told him he better treat her like a princess though b/c that's what she deserves! He's a cool kid. Good job K. 

Hmm, what else...I saw an ex last night. I am kinda sad because he was one of the only ones left that I am still friends with and we didn't have such a good night. I don't get it. I used to pretty much think the kid hangs the moon, but we are just very very different people. Funny how it works I guess.

What is with people who say they are going to call you and never do? I mean, I would much rather someone be like ok well I'll talk to you soon, and have it be a nice surprise if they do call, than someone being like I will call you tomorrow and not calling! Don't tell me you're going to call if you're not going to! What's up with that?? Boys suck.

Highs of the day: getting the last cinnamon muffin at Corner Bakery, someone making me smile from ear to ear and jamming to Cross Canadian, life doesn't get much better that that.

Tomorrow is Father's Day. My dad is quite possibly one of my favorite people on Earth. He would lay down on train tracks for my mom, sisters and I, always knows the right thing to do, and loves us like crazy. My mom tells him he should be eligible for sainthood for putting up with all of us, and she's probably right. We have a lot of fun, usually at mom's expense, but she's a good sport...most of the time ;)

Wow, that was a lengthy journal entry! So much to say about nothing!

So today started another week...except my partner in crime is really gone and I don't really blame her, Austin has got to be more lively than Plano! 

But I've been staying busy, had some people over to the casa last night, good times. We were entertained by Matt's note-writing in high school, I think he almost wet his pants he was laughing so hard. ""My Friend Collin"" sang and played the guitar, pretty sure we woke up the whole neighborhood, but it was fun.

Decided to have a low-key night tonight so I am watching ""Miracle."" I am a such a sucker for these stupid sports movies like Remember the Titans and Rudy, no clue why. Speaking of movies, can I just say that I almost cry every time I even see PREVIEWS of The Notebook!? You can bet I will be standing in line to see it the day it comes out! Who's with me?! 

For all of my Aggie friends, I am planning a trip down to CS soon, who wants to hang out?? Maybe hit up N-Gate??

So, I think I must be sick or something, because I just deposited a pretty nice paycheck the other day and spent close to 2 hours at the mall today and came out with hardly anything! It must be a record, especially b/c that money was burning a hole in my pocket! Tomorrow I shall try again, no worries ;)

Can I just say that this town has nothing to do after 12am?! You know what, I am from Plano, PLANO! A town of over 250,000 people and at least 3 large shopping malls! And, I'm not gonna lie, the sidewalks roll up a little too early for my liking. I guess it's not so bad considering I go to bed early most nights to wake up and either work or babysit, what happened to freakin summer VACATION!? 

My third, final, and probably most significant thought of the evening can be summed up in a quote from one of my favorite movies...""That's why they call them crushes. If they were easy, they'd call 'em something else."" Soooo true. Because, honestly, isn't that what crushes are most of the time, just that? How often do they really turn into something more meaningful? But even though they can be extremely frustrating at times, they can also be so much fun :) Pretty sure I sounded like a 13-year-old right then, but that's ok....

"event","So I am having a hard time trying to think of what to say in this latest journal entry! We went to the movies tonight and saw 50 First Dates. Very cute, Kristin cried, but what else is new? JK Kris, I love you. Pretty sure I haven't sat that close to the screen since we saw Armageddon in the VERY front row when it came out in like 1998! 

Random thought...why is it that we always want what we can't have and never really truly appreciate that which we do? I know I am guilty of it. I think it's sort of a control thing. You want to be the one in charge of your decisions, and don't want someone else making them for you. Kristin and I discussed this the other day. I think sometimes we look so much towards what we THINK we want, and don't realize that what we have is being taken for granted. But, I digress...

Can I tell you what I really hate? When people say they ""have something to tell you"" but then refuse to tell you! What is that about? If you have something to say, say it, if you don't, don't say you do! Why is this a difficult concept? I think it is the inner drama queen in people, trying to get your attention when they really don't have anything important to say at all. The world may never know...

On a more positive note, Casey Zimmerman made my heart smile today!! He left a comment on my journal! I love that kid to death! I miss him and all of my other friends back in good ol' College Station! I will come visit soon!

If two timing is what it takes,
Then we both know one take is all we need we're not equipped to stay, unloved, 
But its all we've got and we're not at all alright.

"event","So my brother is definately not cool. At all.

So he leaves about an hour ago telling me he's goign to play tennis with his friend, Alex. And I fully believed him because they were talking about it all week.

So about 15 minute ago, I get a call from Alex and he says ""Is Matt there?""
and I say ""No, I thought you were playing tennis with him..""
""Uh...I've been on fire call for the last 2-3 hours""
""Hold on, lemme call him on his cell phone""

So I get my brother on his cell phone.

Me: ""So where are you really?""
""What do you mean?""
""You're apparently not playing tennis with Alex""
""Well, he told me he'd be there, but he wasn't sure when""
""So are you still there waiting?""
""No, why?""
""'Cause he just called and asked for you. Then I told him that I thought yall were playing tennis.""
""Oh, I left""
""I thought you said yall were waiting in your car for him to get there""
""No, I said it was just me""
""You didn't""
""Whatever""
""So where are you now?""
""Kalee's""
""Okay...""
""What?""
""I get the feeling you're not telling me everythign""
""Whatever, bye""

So Alex was on the other my house phone

Me: ""He says you talked to him, and you told him you'd come but weren't sure when""
""Well, I've been on fire call, like I said, for the last two or three hours, so I haven't talked to him""
""Okay, I'll talk to him when I get home. Thanks for clearing everything up""


Something about that isn't right"

"event","Today was our first day of school....again.

God, it's so aggravating.

But at least we're hoping to get the warrant to take away two of the weeks we missed, so we'd only have three days to make up.

So we wouldn't lose late-take-ins or anything.

Probably just Mardi Gras holidays, cuz I'm not sure if we're even having them.

And I'm angry

Why am I angry?

Because two people who said they'd give me hugs didn't.

At least I got two from Krystal

God, I love her =)

So yeah, we got progress reports

81 in Geometry

87 in Health

100 in Freshman Experience

91 in Physical Science

Go me

So I still hafta read two chapters of Flatland for Geometry

A novel for math class, hoorah

It's so retarded

Who cares about shapes having sex?

I don't

It needs to die

And I have some worksheet that should be easy"

"event","Just because you have a car and a job doesn't mean you boss me around. Just because you're ""in charge"" doesn't mean I have to listen to you, let alone, like you. I'm so sick of you. You need to leave me alone. You say I don't respect you. Why should I respect you when you don't respect me? I hate you. You always have to take charge of everything. If you're not the best, you get mad. If people don't listen, you cry and throw a temper tantrum. Believe me, it's annoying. You have the worst temper of anyone I've ever seen. You've threatened to send me to summer camp if I don't listen. Well, you don't have the power to do that. Shocking, huh? I really don't care what you think of me at all. I'm sick of you. Tennis this, tennis that. You're gonna lose in the tournament and throw a tantrum and mom and dad will get mad, and you'll say you'll never play again. You'll go in your room and cry and scream at mom and dad. I'll be in my room, laughing till I'm crying. Shocking, huh? That's called honesty. It's called telling the truth. I'm not the one who wants me to lie to mom for you. ""Tell Mom that I'm at work."" ""Tell Mom that we already got Dad's card and if she asks to see it, tell her that we'll surprise her on Sunday."" I'm sick of your crap. I'm tired of it. And you. Just go away, Matt."

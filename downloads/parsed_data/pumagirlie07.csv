"event","Welp, I haven't used this thing for like 100000000 years, so i decided it was time to write, and plus im bored....This weekend sucked i didn't do anything. On Friday, Ashleigh rode the bus home w/ me, but she didn't spend the night. Then, on Saturday, I didn't do anything, but I went to RadioShack in Woodstock w/ Lin and Dan, and then I went to Dairy Queen. What an exciting day!!! At last, on this wonderful Sunday I HAVE NOTHING TO DO!!!! Tomorrow is Memorial Day. We have school, but I don't think I'm gonna go, b/c no one else is going. Gotta stick w/ the crowd, b/c I'm a sheep, as the ""skanks"" call all the ""preps""...sure whatever. They all should die!! The skanks I mean. Hmmmmmm.............Well I have nothing else to write cuz my life is boring as hell, so BYE BYE!"

They were alright, but Ok Go was better. The first band, Loudermilk, kinda sucked. I bought a Donnas T-shirt, and I got two stickers for Katy, since she couldn't go, cuz her parents wouldn't let her, b/c of weather, even though it wasn't even bad. We kinda got lost in Harrisonburg, but alas we found our destination, JMU.. I'm majorly bored......well "" got places to go, got people ta see, the pena-tent-ary ain't the place for me, im warnin you to not tempt me, i run up the squeeze and put a hole in you.""-- just a little 50 cent for ya!..ok bye love ya butts! :-)"

Wesley did come over this morning for like an hour ...wow. Whenever he comes here his dumb bro, Eric, always calls and is like ""COME HOME"". He's so gay. He doesnt have his own life. He had to leave anyways cuz he had to go w/ his dad or some shyte. John Winkfield is talkin to me right now on ICQ, hes such a fag. I hope Jens does not go out w/ him, especially cuz she liked his lil bro, James. ...yeh well i have nothing else to write about so maybe i'll update u later this evening..BYE"

"event","yayE! <<the E is only for katy..hhehee... So anyways.. its like 3:41 A.M. Jennie is over, she is talking to John Winkfield on the phone. God Forbid. He's such a fag, and he likes Jens.. lol. 
   Anyways, since today is Wednesday it is Brandle Golladay's B-Day, but who cares. He pissed me off. Ashleigh and I are playing a horrible trick on him, but no one must know. 
   I keep telling people i have my private area down below pierced.. i'm not sure if anyone believes me or not.. It's really fun. 
   Oh yeh did i mention that Brent Judy is really dumb and annoying?!?!?! God. 
   OH yeh this is also 4 Katy. Ronald told me he still likes me...lol. He seems to be telling the truth and we had a very good phone convo at like 10..i guess. we actually talked the whole time.. 
   OH my goodnes, Neal Lucas told Jen and I to go to this one site and it was like about subliminal messages and at the beginning its like just like phone book ads and stuff that said like, ""We lay for less."" and like other dumb stuff and then it's like the Lord's Prayer Backwards..oh my god that is sooo scary. Then all of a sudden all this pictures of like scary people and chopped up babies comes up and like screams are playing. IT SCARED THE SHIT OUT OF US!!! I KNOCKED THE KEYBOARD AND THE MOUSE OFF THE DESK AND I KNOCKED THE ROLLY THINGY ITS ON OFF ONTO THE FLOOR. WE LIKE SHIT OUR PANTS!!! It was so freaky. Good god. I tryed to send it to other ppl, but it wouldnt work for anybody..which totally sucks.. 
    anyways, I've been talking to Erich like 24/7. He keeps going to his grandma's house so he can talk to me on the phone late cuz his mom is psycho and doesnt let him do anything. He's really sweet, but i can't ever leave my Wessy. I hope he comes over here tomorrow.... dont u just love the snow?! i do...cuz we have no school for like 94358945903590358049 days... well not quite THAT much but oh well.
    hey kate if u read this we need to get together sometime u retard. if we dont have skool friday, are u gonna have ppl come over?! I made ur present today..if i can find it.
    well.. i think i've said enough so bye!"

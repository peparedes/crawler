"event","wow i dont know how i used to do it. to think, last year, every night besides a couple id just be at my house... that changed when i met katie but thats good cause i needed to get out. now that i have NOTHING to do and no money, i am soooo bored. i have no interest in the things i used to do so ive been filling my time by playing guitar, watching tv, and just doing stuff. today i worked 8-1:45 and i got out ate lunch then went down to the shop to work on my car which if i may say looks BAD ASS! anyways so i was there till like 5 so i came home went downstairs chilled watched some movies that were on TV although i HATE COMMERCIALS! haha yea so i did that till i had to eat then i went on the comp for like 5 mins then went back downstairs to watch more tv and make some songs. i tried recording some onto my phone but it sounds like shit. oh well... so uhh yea tomorrow i have to work 7-12 which sucks but the earlier i get in the earlier i get out. so yea after work i think im goin back down to the shop to work on my car for a while put some more shit back together... yea... after i work at the shop i think im going to band practice even though we probably wont accomplish anything.. ugh.. if anyone can play bass and wants to be in a rock/metal/alternative band let me know, it would help out a lot. 

this season is killin me. christmas time is so stressing cause all of my paychecks go towards shopping and stuff. i got most of my shopping done now i just gotta get a few more things for katie. well i guess thats it for now leave some comments."

"event","Wow i miss the summer. i used to think fall was my favorite season, but it is really just depressing. seeing everything that was good fade away. the nice trees with all their leaves, the bright green grass, the warmness, and the all around feeling of those warm summer days. now its just empty. everything is empty. the trees have no leaves you can see things you dont want to see through them, the grass is covered with brown, rotting leaves, the warmth is drowned out again by the nastyness of the cold yet to come. this sucks. i miss the summer so much. it made me happy. everything was good. i hate it now. i HATE IT. summer had everything. i had katie by my side every day, i saw my friends, i had fun, and i had money. now im all alone i have no one, my money doesnt matter, and im stuck at home all the time doing stuff for my parents. i miss katie so much. i miss driving down our dirt road on those hot days and just having fun. we had rough times during the summer but all in all it was awesome. this season sucks and i hope it goes away. winter is going to make me even more upset cause its just going to remind me of her even more. im scared for next month. what if katie cant visit? what if i dont see her till the spring!? i dont know how i can deal with this. its been a week since i saw her and i miss her 3592158 times more. i would give anything just to have her live here again. wow i sound pathetic but you dont know what its like. i love her and i was with her every day and i was happy. i was complete, i needed nothing more. all of a sudden like a train hitting me shes moving away and i talk to her only a little bit. i cant deal with this. i have no one. i have friends yea, and i hang out with them but it still doesnt help. i feel like i am so empty and nothing can fill that emptyness except for her. the days in school are going by so slow. i hate everyone in it. all those happy people with out a care in the world. i am alone and i hate it. i hope this gets better. i want it to get better. it needs to get better. all i can do is think about the past and hope for the future cause the present sucks right now. i wish people would understand and not say "" oh man why are you still with her thats really hard"" well i am its my choice i love her i wouldnt give her up for anything. fuck you people that are supposed to be my friends and support me not talk shit about my feelings or choices. i dont need you. well i guess thats it ima go find something to do that will make me be in a better mood a little... thats gonna be hard. katie auber i love you."

"event","everything is different now that she left. this sucks. i know it will get better and i will get used to it as the days go on but its still weird. i was with her almost every single day for 10 months, and now all of a sudden i can only see her for maybe a week straight and that depends on if i go down there or she comes up here. this sucks. i miss meeting up with her in the halways after class and holding hands and stuff. i miss all the little stuff like smelling her perfume when i pick her up, going to dunkins ordering a small iced coffee full of ice 4 sugars with regular cream, i miss going to her house at 7 in the morning and having to call her to wake her up then her coming to the door acting all tired and getting mad saying 'dammit i fell asleep again!'. its the small things you take for grantid that you miss the most. i cant wait till i am done with school and i can move down there. i love her. it seems like i cant remember what it was like without her. what did i do after school? what did i do when i had nothing better to do? i hate this lonliness and i cant wait for it to end. i know sitting around moping is not going to change anything. what happens happens and i gotta deal with it. well i dunno, ill see her and ill talk to her as often as possible and that will make me happy. well i am done writing and leave some comments and junk
peace"

"event","well its a little over 24 hours till katie leaves. these past few days have seemed so long and im glad for it. im trying to make the best of the little time i have. well im making it seem like its the end but it isnt. it will be sooner than i think when i get to see my baby again. i cant wait. this is gonna be stressful and depressing but i know our relationship is strong enough to last. some people say im dumb for staying with her but im not gonna let something stupid like this demolish what i cherrish and live by. i love her thats it you cant change my mind. this is my decision so fuck off. i love katherine elizabeth auber and no one can change that. not even West virginia. for all of those people out there shittin on katie for stuff she has no control of; kiss my ass and get a life you fuckers. and to those special people that have made this even worse for my katie: congradulations, you are going to regret saying or doing those things that you did when you miss her. and i know you will miss her. just like i will. you WILL miss her and you will feel sorry for her. maybe that will make you stop thinking about yourself for one goddamn minute and wake up. you know who you are so fuck you. thats all i have to say. fuck you. you inconsiderate pieces of shit that if everything doesnt go your way then you get all pissy and blame it on other people. nice try i hope this gets you far in life. NOT. you will wake up and grow up. we all pray you do. and its not just me that thinks this. its everyone that gives you an awkward look when all you do is talk about yourself but doesnt say anything because they know it will hurt your feelings, because unlike YOU, they care about other people, not themselves. FUCK YOU. get this through your head: you making other peoples lives miserable does not help your life it only makes you live off of what you hate and get pissed about. good job. have a good life. fuck you. im out."

BS i yelled at her today and then walked around for a while. katie left early so i went to her house right after school. then i had to drive to concord to go get my senior pics cause theyre due tomorrow so i went and got my moms car cause my car sucks and drove there without getting lost and i only broke a few laws in the traffic system that is like a maze in downtown concord. pooey. yea anyways so i got those and then drove to katies and went to the store so we could cook dinner tonite and it was pretty good. uhh tomorrow my windshield for the celica is coming in and my dad is paying me for it. (birfday present) yea so i still need brakes, and my exhaust system. katie is my love and i love her cause shes my love lalala i dont know what else to put. yea so saturday is my last day of work then i have the whole week off from then till next sunday. works pretty good but that means i work haloween. oh wellllllll.... i guess thats it for now. peace out dawgys."

"event","THANK YOU VERY MUCH CAROLYN FOR HELPING ME WITH MY LJ! Now i am not embarassed to write in it hahaha. anyyyyways. wow what a up and down day. well, most of the day was ok except when i got to work. i hate it so much that i think if it keeps making me pissed im gonna burn the building down like in office space. i want my stapler. i hate the managers there they all suck the big one. i flipped out at one today right before i left cause she didnt know what the hell she was doing. man, if only they let me run the store itd be fine. shes so dumb! ahh i wanted to punch her. anyways, after i left the 100 foot skid mark in the shaws parking lot i went and picked up katie and we had mexican food at my house. yea, im sleeping with a window open tonite.. heh heh.... yea so after we were on the computer and after i took a power nap we went over carolyniums to have her fix my LJ now its all cool. tomorrow is a wednesday which means im getting paid. hopefuly it'll be enough to last. yea so saturday is my last day of work and then i have a week off starting sunday (my birfday) so that will be relaxing. i can actually sleep in. thats not gonna help the fact that my baby is leaving in less than 2 weeks. ahh i dont know man this isnt fair. i love katie so much and its cruel that she is getting ""taken away"". but i guess it will all be OK in the end. she will be happier down there and so will her family, and after i finish high school ill head down there and go to a tech school. i am gonna visit her every chance i get. 

my car is almost done. after the accident we have put everything besides the windshield that got wrecked either fixed or replaced and put it all together. it is all sanded (the whole car) we decided to paint the whole entire car which is a big stretch but its gonna be better that way because we are fixing every single little tiny scratch or dent on the thing and its gonna look mint. i have a dupont bright silver on it with 250 dollar dupont showroom clear coat too. the thing is gonna shine like nonya business. that will hopefuly be done before november so i can drive it for a while before it snows. well i guess thats all i have to say today. remember.... drive it like you stole it and respect my gangster. peace out for now"

"event","Ok, so I just made this, and it looks like crap right now but hey, I did it like 5 minutes. I called out of work last night so i didn't have to work today. Corbin slept over and we just chillaxed. We went over katies and got taco bell and all that cool stuff. after we were there for a while and after i got moolah from my dad we went to corbins house and jammed for a little. me and katie got in a pretty big fight while i was driving back from corbins in brookline, and if you know me, thats not good. when i drive i tend to take all my frustration out on my car. i pushed my poor saturn up to 100mph on 101 today and passed a million and a half cars. i know i know its not safe but whatever. katie talked to her friend and we worked things out and then we went over my house and had dinner and she took a shower here :-D and we went downstairs....... yeah. after that we went driving listening to my sister-in-laws brother's band, Alacrity. They're really good. I'll put a link somehow to their site sometime. We then went to carolyn's and talked to derek kyle and zach. and then we left and i dropped katie off at her house. now i am sitting here bored and tired making a live journal. Well I'm off now hopefuly ill have some comments."

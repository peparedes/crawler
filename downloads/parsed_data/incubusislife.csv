oars freed from their holes long ago
lying face up on the floor
of my vessel
I marvel at the stars
and feel my heart overflow

Further down the river
further down the river
further down the river
further down the river

Two weeks without my lover
I'm in this boat alone
floating down a river named emotion
will I make it back to shore?
or drift into the unknown

Further down the river
further down the river
further down the river
further down the river

I'm building an antenna
transmissions will be sent
when I am through
maybe we can meet again
further down the river
and share what we both discovered
then revel in the view

Further down the river
further down the river
further down the river

And then begin to breathe in
The darkest country road
And the strong scent of evergreen
From the passenger seat as you are driving me home.

Then looking upwards
I strain my eyes and try
To tell the difference between shooting stars and satellites
From the passenger seat as you are driving me home.

""do they collide?""
I ask and you smile.
With my feet on the dash
The world doesn't matter.

When you feel embarrassed then i'll be your pride
When you need directions then i'll be the guide
For all time.
For all time.

And all that I saw just kept goin on and on
Sweep all the pieces under the bed
Close all the curtains and cover my head

You aren't surprised love, are you?
If this serenade is not what you want
It's just how it is, it keeps goin on and on
Come out, come out where ever you are
Would you do it all over right from the start
And what you wish for won't come true

So what you wish for won't come true
You aren't surprised love, are you?
Once had this dream, crashed down in Oz
Not black and white, but where the colors are
I never dreamed that I would let her go
And I will get what I deserve
Keep all the secrets under the bed
Open the curtains, forget what I said

"event","There was a decorated General with a heart of gold
That likened him to all the stories he told,
Of past battles won and lost
And legends of old
A seasoned veteran in his own time

On the battlefield he gained respectful fame
With many medals of bravery and stripes to his name
He grew a beard as soon as he could to cover the scars on his face
And always urged his men on

But on the eve of a great battle with the infantry in dream
The Old General tossed in his sleep and wrestled with his meaning
He awoke from the night to tell what he had seen
And walked slowly out of his tent

All the men held tall with their chests in the air
With the courage in their blood and a fire in their stare
and It was a gray morning and they all wondered how they would fare
Till the old general told them to go home

He said: I have seen the others
And I have discovered
That this fight is not worth fighting
And I've seen their mothers
And I will no other, to follow me where I'm going
So

Take a shower, shine your shoes
You got no time to lose
You are young men you must be living 
Take a shower, and shine your shoes
You got no time to lose
You are young men you must be living
Go now you are forgiven

But the men stood fast with their guns on their shoulders
Not knowing what to do with the contradicting orders
The General said he would do his own duty but he would extend it no further
The men can go as they pleased

Not a man moved their eyes gazed straight ahead,
Till one by one they stepped back and not a word was said
And the old general was left with his own words echoing in his head
He then prepared to fight

He said: I have seen the others
And I have discovered
That this fight is not worth fighting
No, And I've seen their mothers
and I will no other
to follow me where I'm going
So
Take a shower shine your shoes

Take a shower shine your shoes

Go now you are forgiven, go

Go now you are forgiven 
Go now you are forgiven

A downpour of sweat, damp cotton clouds
was a fool, you were my friend
We made it happen
You took off your clothes, left on the light
You stood there so brave
You used to be shy
Each feature improved, each movement refined and eyes like a showroom
Now they are spreading out the blankets on the beach
That weatherman is a liar
He said it would be raining but it is clear and blue as far as I can see

Left by the lamp, right next to the bed,
on a cartoon cat pad you scratched with a pen,
""Everything is as it has always been.
This never happened.
Don't take it so bad it is nothing you did.
It's just once something dies you can't make it live.
You are a beautiful boy.
You're a sweet little kid but I am a woman.""
So I laid back down and wrapped myself up in the sheet
And I must have looked like a ghost because something frightened me
and since then I've been so good at vanishing

Now I do as I please and lie through my teeth
Someone might get hurt, but it won't be me
I should probably feel cheap but I just feel free...
and a little bit empty
No, it isn't so hard to get close to me
There will be no arguments
We will always agree
And I will try and be kind when I ask you to leave
We will both take it easy
But if you stay too long inside my memory,
I will trap you in a song tied to a melody
and I will keep you there so you can't bother me

Why can't we give love that one more chance?
Why can't we give love give love give love?
Give love give love give love give love give love give love?
Cause love's such an old fashioned word
And love dares you to care
For the people on the edge of the light
And love dares you to change our way
Of caring about ourselves
This is our last dance
This is our last dance
This is ourselves Under Pressure

Kind of morning that lasts all afternoon
just stuck inside the gloom
4 more exits to my apartment but
I am tempted to keep the car in drive
And leave it all behind

Cause I wonder sometimes
About the outcome
Of a still verdictless life

Am I living it right?
Am I living it right?
Am I living it right?
Why Georgia, why?

I rent a room and I fill the spaces with
Wood in places to make it feel like home
But all I feel's alone
It might be a quarter life crisis
Or just the stirring in my soul

Either way I wonder sometimes
About the outcome
Of a still verdictless life

Am I living it right?
Am I living it right?
Am I living it right?
Why Georgia, why?

So what, so I've got a smile on
But it's hiding the quiet superstitions in my head
Don't believe me
When I say I've got it down

Everybody is just a stranger but
That's the danger in going my own way
I guess it's the price I have to pay
Still ""everything happens for a reason""
Is no reason not to ask myself

If I am living it right
Am I living it right?
Am I living it right?
Why Georgia, why?

Well if you wanted honesty, that's all you had to say.
I never want to let you down or have you go, it's better off this way.
For all the dirty looks, the photographs your boyfriend took,
Remember when you broke your foot from jumping out the second floor?

I'm not okay
I'm not okay
I'm not okay
You wear me out

What will it take to show you that it's not the life it seems?
(I'm not okay)
I told you time and time again you sing the words but don't know what it means
(I'm not okay)
To be a joke and look, another line without a hook
I held you close as we both shook for the last time take a good hard look!

I'm not okay
I'm not okay
I'm not okay
You wear me out

Forget about the dirty looks
The photographs your boyfriend took
You said you read me like a book, but the pages are all torn and frayed

I'm okay
I'm okay!
I'm okay, now
(I'm okay, now)

But you really need to listen to me
Because I'm telling you the truth
I mean this, I'm okay!
(Trust Me)

I'm not okay
I'm not okay
Well, I'm not okay
I'm not o-fucking-kay
I'm not okay
I'm not okay

When we get there, we're gonna go far away.

we won't back down
(bang, bang, guns go bang)
from a fight
(bang, bang, guns go bang)
90 paces west
(bang, bang, guns go bang)
at noon we draw to, we draw to death
we draw to death
we draw to death
we draw to death
we draw to death

there was a man from way back west
(desperado ain't got shit on me)
he took 12 rounds straight to the chest
(that's two six-shooters to be exact)
at night this town, it lays awake
(for they keep their eyes wide open)
the terror of the rattlesnake

i bite it, but i don't light it
(this town ain't big enough for the both of us)
i'll use the rope and i'll ride her
two barrels and a whole lot of bang
and when i'm down with it, this town will never be the same

[chorus]

can i touch your legs?
do i make you sweat?

we write a thousand pages, they're torn and on the floor
headlights hammer the windows, we're locked behind these doors
and we are never leaving, this place is part of us
and all these scenes repeating are cold to the touch

my hands seem to deceive me
when I'm nervous or when I'm healthy.
the scenery's all drawn.

they hang here from the walls dear,
painting pictures, bleeding colors,
blanket the windows.

sometimes it gets so hard to breathe.
your eyes can see right through me.

these fights with your arms left beside.
one thing and one more says goodnight.
you've got the map come get to me.
these knuckles break before they bleed.

tear out these veins that own my heart.
this skin that wears your lasting marks.
i've built these walls come get to me, come get to me.

is this your lesson, a slight discretion,
the lines that keep you, the lines that sweep you.
lock the doors from the inside.

your face is so contagious, it wears announcements,
it leaves me breathless, i won't forget this,
i won't forget...

sometimes it gets so hard to breathe.
your eyes can see right through me.
let the walls have their say.

there's no conversation, words without remorse
and this television drowns the only source
wake from these dreams of you in my arms
to the staircase where you hold my heart
this place, these walls mean everything to me.

"event","Okay, I kinda disappeared from LJ for awhile. I've not been able to think of much to say and I've always had trouble getting myself to write much anymore. I'm sure you've been reading Tara's LJ, so you know we're pregnant. I'm really looking forward to the next ultrasound.(Curious as to wether it's a boy or girl,but not hoping for one over the other) I can't wait to see our child's heartbeat again. I have trouble showing my emotions much, and on top of that I'm still in the shock/rejoicing that I'm going to be a father stage. Tara and I went to LJ Meet-Up and Barnes and Nobles(Newport Levee). It was alot of fun. I'm usually pretty shy around people I haven't met before, but didn't have a problem tonight. 


I've really enjoyed the last 2 Sundays. Tara and I joined a D&D group at Violet Vortex Games in Milford. I've waited so long to be able to play D&D again.(Thanks phoenixforce)
Most of the group that I've gotten a feeling about are pretty cool. 

We'll, Gotta go for now. Hopefully I'll be making a more regular update to LJ. Everyone take care."

"event","I know I haven't posted in a while. Been pretty stressed and depressed. AnyWHO....
here's a little something to get y'all thinking :-)

Mysteries of Life

1. Who was the first person to look at a cow and say, ""I think I'll 
squeeze
these dangly things here, and drink whatever comes out""?

2. Why do toasters always have a setting that burns toast to a horrible
crisp which no decent human being would ever eat?

3. Why is there a light in the fridge and not one in the freezer?

4. If Jimmy cracks corn and noone cares, why is there a song about him?

5. Can a hearse carrying a corpse drive in the carpool lane?

6. If the professor on Gilligan's Island can make a radio out of 
coconut,
why can't he fix a hole in a boat?

7. Why do people point to their wrist when asking for the time, but 
don't
point to their crotch when they ask where the bathroom is?

8. Why does your OB-GYN leave the room when you get undressed if
they are going to look up there anyway?

9. Why does Goofy stand erect while Pluto remains on all fours? They're
both dogs!

10. What do you call male ballerinas?

11. Can blind people see their dreams?

12. Why ARE Trix only for kids?

13. If Wile E. Coyote had enough money to buy all that Acme crap, why
didn't he just buy dinner?

14. Why is a person that handles your money called a 'Broker'?

15. If quizzes are quizzical, what are tests?

16. If a man is talking in the forest, and no woman is there to hear 
him,
is he still wrong?

17. Why is it that when someone tells you that there are over a billion 
stars
in the universe, you believe them, but if there is a ""wet paint"" sign 
somewhere,
you have to touch it to make sure?

18. If electricity comes from electrons, does morality come from 
morons?

19. Is Disney World the only people trap operated by a mouse?

20. Why do the alphabet song and ""Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star"" have 
the
same tune?

21. Do illiterate people get the full effect of alphabet soup?

22. Why do they call it an 'asteroid' when it's outside the hemisphere, 
but call it a
'hemorrhoid' when it's inside your ass?

23. Did you ever notice that when you blow in a dog's face, he gets mad 
at you,
but when you take him on a car ride, he sticks his head out the window?

oh yeah....and a personal favorite of mine...
Why do they put Brail on drive-up ATM's?"

"event","Kinda hash subject, I know,but right about now I'm totally pissed at the world. Today was crusing along okay til 15 mins ago.<lj user=lady_wintermoon> and Ihad just sat down to eat. I went to the kitchen to grab drinks and step in a puddle. No biggie I thought at first, maybe one of our cats made a mess.(Disgusting, but easily cleaned up) Trouble is, life can't be that genereous. I hear the sound of dripping....I look up and there's a huge bubble in the paint on the ceiling and big drops of water falling steadily(about 1 large drop per second) I called my grandpa, who's been working on our roof along with my aunt and her 2 sons. He says he'll take a look at it tomorrow since it's already getting dark outside. Now don't get me wrong, I'm not upset that he can't come out tonight. What upsets me is that it seems that every time I turn around something else goes wrong. Wheeewww..just need to vent a little. BTW I took a big cooler we have and placed it under the leak, now the cats are trying to figure out what's going on. 

Oh well. Bye4now"

"event","Well, another post for all my avid readers(LOL). Kinda slow day today. Wintermoon and I visited Casiel and Shantirose for a bit, then went to Biggs and Meijers for snack foods.
I got a party loaf of rye and some Beer Cheese. MMM MMMM. Lady wintermoon got some beef jerky that reminds me of her.              Sweet and Hot <BG>
The most exciting thing about the trip to the store was seeing Santa Claus. Of course he wasn't dressed in the red suit we all expect to see Santa in. But hey, Santa needs to dress casual sometimes too. Lady wintermoon's comment was ""Santa's the same height as me!"" Okay, okay....so it was really some old man with a very chubby tummy, bushy long white beard and hair, and rosey red cheeks. But I couldn't help but think of how often that man has probably run into some people with young kids that look to their parents and exclaim ""Mommy, Daddy, Why is Santa walking around in blue jeans and a flannel shirt??"" Oh well...gotta go for now."

"event","Hello again. Well, not much happened today. Had to chase down 2 of our gerbils after getting home from visiting shantirose and casiel. We watched Dungeons and Dragons and I actually fell asleep on the floor. I'm kinda embarrassed about that. I don't usually fall asleep during a movie unless I'm really, really tired. Other than that I've played around on Neopets for a little while. If you're a member of Neopets look me up to add as a Neofriend. Lady_wintermoon and I caught another mouse tonight(in a live animal trap from Wal-Mart), and as I was getting the trap ready to transfer the mouse to another container, the mouse managed to climb out of the trap.... wintermoon screamed a couple times. So all in all we had a little excitement within the past hour. Oh well....starting to sound like I'm rambling here, so I guess I'll post the answers to the little quiz from my first post.

Quiz answers
1. George Carlin
2. Denis Leary
3. Robin Williams
4. Gallager (sp)
5. Steve Erwin a.k.a. The Crocodile Hunter

So long for now ;-)"

"event","Hello everyone. Well....I finally decided to try a LJ. I just spent a couple hours on the roof with my grandpa setting rafters. I'm always amazed by how active he is. He's 73 years old, retired from the Post Office(since '86) and Rose Brothers Lumber(since '86 or '87). He grew up in Pennington Gap, VA on the side of a mountain, worked in coal mines till he went into the Army(during the Korean War). He's a self-taught plumber, carpenter, and electrician. For as long as I can remember I can't think of many times when he wasn't working on something. 

I guess I should say aliitle about myself. For those of you that follow lady_wintermoon's LJ, I'm her husband. We met on Aug. 9th, 1999 and my life has felt complete ever since. The only things that could make life better would be a couple rug rats and winning the Lotto.(Working on one.....praying for the other. LOL)

I don't know much else to say at the moment. I'd appreciate any comments or questions (because they'd give me a better idea as to what to post). ;-)

A quick quiz before I go.

If you can, tell whom these quotes are from. (All from well known people)

1. Get ON the plane? Fuck that, I'm getting IN the plane. Let Evel Kenevel get ON the plane.

2. Real smokers smoke a cigarette down to the filter 'cause we know that's where they hide the Crack cocaine.

3. I had to quit drinking 'cause I got tired of waking up naked on the hood of my car with my keys up my ass.

4. It's not a slicer, it's not a dicer, it's not a chopper in a hopper. It's the handiest and the dandiest kitchen tool ever and DON'T YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT IT IS?

5. Ain't she a beaut? And they really hate it when you do this?

Answers posted tomorrow.
Well as Tigger would say TTFN....Ta Ta For Now"

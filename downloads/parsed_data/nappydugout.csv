"event","sup peeps cant find anyone yet. Hi addie, swear to god u must be the only mutherfucker who reads my shyt. Ne ways there is a band called Phil D that plays in my basement very tuesday and thursday night theyre death metal, its sooo  kew. I got a new skateboard but im still fAT. Next sunday im going to sell all my shyt at rietta ranch and make millions im still not really atracted to guys only one. Kyle M. Hanks. He doesnt want me to give out his middle name. The other night i taught him how to kiss and i just rubbed his stomach and back he loved it. In the moring his neck as a mixture of purple, blue and black light the sun setting. LOL. I can never rightlike addie. Ad, i havent been avoiding u so if u think that stop it. I like u alot. Ya i still kinda like Vikki but she doent like me like that so fuck it. I made andrew quit smoking pot which is good. Were super good griends now. YA a few weekends ago me and sam Thomas made out and did other stuff and wee really liked each other for a while. So this weekend me and her slept over andrews house. I was all excited because I thought that me and her were gonna make out the whole time. But it wasnt that at all. She kept talking about andrew and how bad she liked him and how she wanted a chinese girlfriend because she thinks chineses girls are super hot. Im just sooo upset. Addie asked me out like two weeks ago but i turned her down because if we broke up it would destroy our friendship. An i wouldnt be faithful enough. I get too horny to much. I need someone that drives me absolutly wild and when i see them or hear them i have an orgasm. Im soo shallow. If penis's were oozie and green, it would be so gross. I dont like penises. So any ways i made sam feel like shyt and im glad she really hurt my feelings. She told me that she loved me and that i was everything that she looked for in a girl. I guess she was lying or something. This is the longest journal entry i have ever written. I hate gay bashers and homophobes. Im gonna work at my grandmas house the rest of April vacation for ten bucks an hour so i cvan buy something kewl like a person that would love me."

"event","In the past week i have lost whieght, got a new love, got a guitar, frumset, bass, and a keyboerd and found out my pourpose on this earth. Its so hard to explain in words what I've been goin through, i saw addie on thursday, shes so kewl and sweet. Im not depressed anymore becuase i learned that people do love me, their just to afraid to admit it. Ya Addie is wickedd kewl im goin to a prom with her in May! so happy. Ya know sometimes i get really nervous around her and I dunno but i usually warm up after a few hours of hanging out with her shes a great person as well a one of my best friends. This is so du,b because shes gonna read this and shes gonna laugh. Oh well. I still like Meagn, Andrews girlfriend (Andrew is my best friend so i feel kinda bad) but he doesnt know and he doesnt need to know. All my friends like Amanda, Erin, Andrew, and Erik are all beconming wicked big stoners i hate it because I'm a straight edge. Erin keeps dropping hints to her and her family that sh'e bysexual. Im just gonna not tell my mom because she would let me have friends taht re girls over anymore. LOL! Im a hornball. Amandas wicked hott. Ya Addie has  the brain intellegince of the Dally Lamma its kewl to listen to someone only 16 talk about life and actually understand it the way i do. I love her. Not in the rapists sense at all and she has the most beautiful voice ever well i dont know what else to say right now except is all i need now is money, to be skinny and a girlfriend. Untill next time this has been J-Boogie aka the spider!"

"event","Wats up people my friend Addie told me about this website so i decided to go on it and i love it. Im at one of my best friends Erins house. This whole week has been kind of upsetting because it was valentines day about a week ago and it just really upset me because i havent gone out with anybody for a year ya so that kinda pisses me off. I anyone wants to get to know me guy or girl that would be kewl. For all you dumbasses that dont know im a chick and im not manly. If theres one thing i hate its a manly girl. For some reason that wicked grosses me out. Ya so if theres anyone that wants to hook up with a 15 years old girl that lives near winchendon just IM me please. I need love. 


For about 2 years Ived liked this kid named andrew and i stopped likening him the other day because I relized that we were never going to go out again and that upset me. Im such a lonely girl. Right now im listening to coldplay i love coldplay, the scientist OOOOOOOOO.  Wanna here something else thats fucked up i feel soo bad about?? ok here its is. Ya know the andrew kid that i just talked about well i like his girlfriend megan a wicked lot. Shes 17 and shes has such a good heart. 

Im in love with this girl named Addie but i don't think she really knows how much i like her. Im not going out with her. I love her to much. we talk to each other on the phone like everynight for like hours she lieks me too. But she doent talk about me much in her journal. 

I also like other people but they all have boyfriends which sux.

All I wan't is some one to love

P.s. Vikki, seriously Neils not worth it and i like you alot, i wanna go out with you

Addie I love you sooo much yes love not like i cant explain it in words. I think about you all the time and i wicked wanna hang out soon. I'm kinda sad so give me a call.  I love you"

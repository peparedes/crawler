"event","been a while since i have written in this internet reality show. honestly the only reason im writing in this is b/c im bored. im in miami now for a visit and theres no electronic entertainment so im going insane. kinda sad.

lets do an amazing gainesville update shall we.

same shit, same smell. still got no friends, (other than the occasional ""hey ozzie, long time no see"" from one of the people i know from miami) hell even less now that tone moved out. at least when he was in the apt. we would go out places. im still in santa fe, fucking santa fe. im almost 23 years old and im still not in a real university. at this rate ill be a veterinarian around the same time i purchase my first little raskle(tm) motorized scooter. 

some good news though is that this girl rachel introduced me to actually talked to me and apparently wanted to see me, so lets hope that goes well and not like the 7598693 other women ive given the old eye.

lets see, my english proff is a fucking moron. poetry is the most USELESS thing in existance.  well next to the fucks who teach it saying it means one thing, when it can mean something else. i mean, how does this guy know what the meaning of the poem is? did he dig up the writer and ask her 20 questions? fucking cock sucker, i have the worst luck with english teacher. 

my best friend isnt talking to me, though i can understand why. just hurts a bit.

what else... ah max is a old fart but he runs around like hes getting chased by jason or something. i guess thats good though, better than him laying down all day. 

i guess that all for now. see u in another 9 months internet reality show (with the lowest ratings ever!}"

<P>if a guy she met 3 weeks ago can make her think that she will have a future with and maybe spend the rest of her life with him, well then that just shows how badly i have treated her. she is trying something better/different. she deserves to be made&nbsp;happy and well, quite frankly i never did that. .&nbsp;maybe one day i will learn how to do it, maybe one day ill get another chance. the way things are looking though, i dont think it will happen. and that wouldnt be a bad thing for her. now she is happy.</P>
<P>&nbsp;im not going to venom you. im not gonna oppress you. im going to leave you alone. you can be happy now.</P>

"event","<P>so im in my chinese humanities class today, and the lady is yapping on about some crap, and then we get to this part about Confucius.

<P>""Do not do to others what you do not want done to yourself""</P>
<P>and holy shit, when i heard that i started thinking. if the whole fucking world would just do what that quote said, everyont would be happier. its fucking insane. its like, would you want to be stabbed in the eye by a frozen trout? of course not, so dont do it to someone else.</P>
<P>i thought about it some more, and i realize that the past 3 years would of been so much better, if&nbsp; both her and I would of&nbsp; followed that quote. hurtful words and hurtful actions on both our parts would not of been said done. its&nbsp;things that I&nbsp;my opinion&nbsp;shap up the current situation. </P>
<P>such a simple thing, and no one does it. it comes to show how fucking stupid and retarded all the people in this world are. a fucking ancient ass chinese guy is smarter than all the billions of people on this planet combined. its pretty depressing</P>

<P>so i get a call and its vivi asking ""did u send me flowers?"" and i was gonna say nope. but that woulda been bad for obvious reasons. but yeah. so i try to salvage the situation. instead of feeling depresed off my ass about that i think that maybe i will get a nice loooooong call about how nice they are and shit. nope, i get like 5 IMs in the span of an hour, and a nice mention about the flowers in her journal. not to sound ungreatful, but if i was a chick and a guy sent me a gazzilion flowers, i would be a bit more talkative. w/e actions speak louder than words. favorite flowers cant compare to ""lost in translation"" apparently. </P>

i woke up at 9:30am because my body decided it had enough sleep with the 4 hours and all. its not all so bad as when i turned on the tv in an attempt to try to get back to sleep, i saw the 1988 remake of the blob. man that movie was bloddy as shit. i enjoyed it.

today vivi told me she is changing her major from forensixs to some criminal law thingy. i asked her if thats what she wanted and if it would make her happy and she said yes, so its all good. her future is looking up. i'm very happy for her.

gotta love a book where they kill off the characters faster than a slut opens her legs for a random pretty boy who gives her the old eye. that actually reminds me of something funny i over heard last night. this girl, who of course had no interest in talking to me, was chatting with some people about her roomate. she asked the roomate ""are u going to come to the party tonight?"" and this is the funny part, the roomate responds ""naw, im gonna stay home tonight, my pussy is raw as fuck from the 8 hours with the guy i met from the club"".  all i gots to say to this poor, vaginally raw roomate is, enjoy the rigamortis (inside joke that was most probably forgotten) that develops.

fellow readers, heres a tip from your buddy old frank, when 2 people who care about each other are veeeeeeery hot headed (for example: saying things they do not mean when they are angry) things can be pretty difficult. you can either do 2 things.

thing number 1: say fuck it and move on
thing number 2: endure, endure and endure, b/c eventually things will be better. as long as both people don't give up on eachother.

and now, back i go to killing the rebel scum of the galaxy. they will all die by my mighty saber........OF DOOM!"

History: Victor Von Doom was raised by gypsies in a<br>small European county called Latveria. He lost<br>both of his parents at a very young age.<br>Swearing revenge, Victor began to increase both<br>his scientific and mystical knowledge with such<br>determination that he was given a full<br>scholarship to Empire State University. It was<br>at ESU that Victor met Reed Richards and Ben<br>Grimm, and where he started his<br>extradimensional research. Doom's vanity<br>prevented him from adjusting the schematics to<br>one of his experiments, and the end result was<br>an explosion that scarred Victor for life.<br>Expelled from school, Victor began to travel<br>the world, eventually stumbling upon a village<br>of Tibetan monks who trained him and crafted<br>him a suit of body armor, complete with face<br>plate. He soon returned to Latveria, overthrew<br>the government and crowned himself King. Ruling<br>with an iron fist, Doom began to turn the<br>resources of his small nation to his plans of<br>world domination. <br><br>

Known Superhuman Powers: While in his armor, Dr.<br>Doom can lift (press) approximately 2 tons. He<br>is one of the smartest men in the world and has<br>an almost endless variety of weapons and<br>equipment at his disposal. At the very least,<br>Doom's armor contains a force field and<br>concussion beams -- though more weapons may<br>also be included. Dr. Doom also has the ability<br>to switch minds with another person and he<br>possesses a small amount of mystical knowledge<br>as well.<br><br><font face=""Georgia""<br>size=""+1"">

I cant play like i did in the summer b/c of schoo land shit but its alright, no biggie. dolphins beat jacksonville suck wagons today, man do they suck. i mean seriously they couldnt catch the ball if they had nails coming out of thier hands and the nails had bees that would hover the ball into the nails to stick into the ball. o man i saw kill bill this weekend and its uber good, everyone must see it or be forced to run laps around the world till they die. so so so so so so so so good. better than pulp fiction, which i also saw this weekend. i wanna see jackie brown and resovour dogs also, see which of the 4 i like the best. o well another day another time to go to bed and another sleepless/not too good of a sleep night. gir is in my prayers and he should be in all of urs also. dont ask just do it. good night and dont let freddy kill u"

"event","Two words, Publix Sub. holy shit, thats a good sub. i had ""the ultimate"" and im telling you, brian micheal bendis must of made my sub. AH speaking of new comics ocming out tommarow, new comics come out tommarow! woot, all the hard work of living is all worth it come tommrow. I ran to the bridge and back tonight, it was pretty hard but I did it. The way I see it is when i can run without stopping to the cold stone on newberry then i can have coldstone *drool* Seans mom and aunt and hot cousin came to the house, but i wasnt there. his aunt said me and tyler's section of the house smelled bad. lucky for her i was enjoying a publix sub..... i take like 3 showers a days! its impossible for me to smell. well im gonna go shower, then sleep for 20 hours (i wish) see ya on the flip side"

"event","So I got up today 30 mins earlier to finish some homework that i was too distracted to do yesterday, good distractions though. So im doing math and what do i see, my fucking cat Mr. Kelvin smelling my sheets, so i go to investigate and find a nice wet spot on my bed, freshly made by Kelvin. So after i kill the fucker (in my mind) i make my bed naked and scrubb the thing and throw the sheets in the wash. Its funny to see feline zombie walk around.... anyways college was fun, i got a 106 in math, which is weird, im such an underachiever. i got a package in the mail, 2 tshirts i ordered, my cobra commander one and supposivly my decepticon/cobra one, but the later shirt was wrong, so i gotta like return it. how annoying. if i was agent smith ill send a copy out to devil's due (online store where i bought said shirts) to suffice them. Tyler runs fast, faster than me. and gato perdido runs slow, slower than me so im stuck in the middle, like a penis except sideways, sorta. sean got cut today and it really stings. and his car feels better now, b/c it got a new battery. ah and i saw more kingdom hearts 2 pictures, holy christ wagons i cant wait till it comes out, oh my god. *drool* i miss my mom and dad again, it is sad. and timmy and max and colossus. they are so much better than zombie feline. friggin timmy, still sleeps on on my bed at night so says mother. hes a good cat, again unlike zombie cat. o well time to go shower off the stink of running. laterz"

"event","I went running today with Tyler and Gato Perdido, it was pretty good surprisingly. Gato Perdido walked some of it, but she will get used to it. It good that I am running with Tyler b/c exercise is good, and i wanna get rid of this spare tire so i can look hella sexy. I bet this is how Frank did it in Vietnam, he probably ran to the near by jungle, killed some NVA, ran back, ate some tuna. So today I was thinking about Psycho. I havent seen it in so long. What a great fucking movie. But you gotta see it all in one sitting, none of that see 30 mins here, 30 mins there crapola. I wanna buy way too many movies, and i dont got the cash for it, seriously i think that if those fuckers at banfield veterinary clinic dont call me by next thursday, im just gonna make a mafia here in Gainesville with Tyler, like Tony Montana. Except Im not gonna kill Miguel/Tyler b/c he was dating my sister, and I'm not gonna do my coke, b/c coke is bad. anyways, i think im going to sleep, and w/o doing my homework, ho boy. o well"

"event","I finally got a live journal, see what all the hoopla was about. Its pretty cool. Thank you Emaly for the code. So yeah I live in Gainesville and its quiet. I like quiet. The Dolphins beat the Giants today. So all you people from New York should just jump out a window or something b/c you suck at life (TM Anthony Roldan, from Godzilla). I should be doing homework but im not. Sean downloaded League of Extraordinary Gentlemen so im gonna watch it now. I'm gonna go run with Tone today, I hope i dont die or anything, 2 miles seems like a lot. But anyways, this is my first entry, enjoy."

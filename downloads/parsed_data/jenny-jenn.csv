Also, No Specia Talent, lol, how many ppl do u know that can remember song lyrics like I can???? & no that wasn't a chance fer self praise, it's actually the truth!!!!

Plus Paul had my hopes up before tellin me he knew how fix it but it didn't work at all so now I'm thrilled, hehe. Night we're doin laundry, not til later on cause Paul got a class in a min, I got study do plus der ain't a chance I'm missin PH night, no friggen way! Probably be the last thing I does before I goes bed. Yummy, we had tacos fer supper, it was wicked. Actually we had em like 4 day cause Paul wanted em early cause he had class after. Man I never haves my supper dat early! Gettin like Tan & Trista Blake now havin it dat early, lol.

Got study do night fer Soc on Monday. Still dunno my plan fer Friday yet. Mom & Dad needs come in on Friday cause mom's gettin blood work done & she needs come in on Monday too have this surgery done so I'd have ride both ways. Plus I SOOOOO wants go McKays weekend watch girls play ball so Paul wanted go out on Friday, get his car & go. I wouldn't really sure what do cause I had study my butt off but if I knew I could get in der I'd study hard til then so I could get in der. I wants go right bad see Ing & dem play. This'll be Ing's last year so I'd like see whas on go. God knows, see what Jeff is up to weekend too. I'd like go home fer a night but like I told mom, the only person I'd go home see would be Meg & Kita cause I say Pearl'll be in here, & Meg's gone & Shane's gone too. Dear little Kita'll be all by her lonesome, hehe. Plus ders ger crowd goin home which means me & Paul'll be on our floor by ourselves. If Cora had ppl up I'd go up but Paul ain't goin up alone with no fellers in case dickass shows up & the only guy left would be like Joey S. Dunno, I'd spend a bit of time with mom weekend cause I doubt I'd be up fer much since I got study do & last time I went home I was in same boat & ended up gettin hungover all Saturday. Shitty deal. A my, I probably won't make up my mind til Friday o man. Meggy I wish u were home! I'd be out in a flash!

So work is alright so far. Gettin bogged down at times but o well, dat all comes with it. I got 65% on my Pych & 77% on my French. Mom was pleased cause she knows the lowdown on this Univ crap & she said I can't expect get marks like I did in high school. All I cares about is makin her & dad happy. Plus the way I looks at it, with my first tests over, I knows what to expect now so I should be a bit more calm, but knowin I, das nah likely to happen. 
 
Last night I took it easy. Iwent down Gym fer an hous & came home & relaxed. Paul played hockey so I watched The Breakfast Club & Lizzie McGuire movie. Michael joined me fer a bit of Lizzie McGuire movie cause he was waitin fer Paul get home cause he had some crap belong to him. Paul brought me back cookies from Subway! I was pleased, hehe. Man o man, I can't friggen sleep in here! When I was home I'd be in bed 5 minutes & I'd be out, but in here it's more like over an hour & I'm forcin myself to go sleep. It rots me! I dunno, too weird fer me. Til next time..."

I won't be here long cause I might run back & study a chapter in Soc & watch a movie while I waits go bed. I feels the flu comin on, but I don't see how das possible cause like Ing said a few weeks ago one thing is fer sure I won't get flu cause I drinks ger shit loada juice in day time. It's nuts. O well, Cora got it too so dat could be the damn source, hehe. 

Had my French test day, dunno how it was cause ya know how it is, me & Cora got out & started chattin bout it & we was like WTF? Was I sposed do dat???? Weird. O well, the prof is startin to turn on me now, I don't like him much anymore. Be alright if he cracked a smile. I ran into Kimmy day, first time since I got here. I was talkin to her over the ball field other day & she was like ""Do you still go to that school???"" cause where we haven't seen eachother. She's coo, hopefully we can get gether sometime cause she spends lotsa time over here. A well, feels like I've been in school ALL damn week & it's only Monday. I might take a trip up mall sometime this week to secretly buy Paul's birthday gift without him knowin cause he always manages to either be der when I buys it or find out some other way what it is. Nah dis year I tell ya.

Last but not least, Congrats to my twin Miggy Jean Foote on bein Prez of Grad class & Vice Prez of BA school, hehe. Das my girl, take over I tell ya, take over!!!

"event","So...where do I start? Friday night I had a pretty good time, better than I thought. We went to Marc's fer a bit which meant, as usual the majority of the ppl der was from Burgeo, YAY! We had a good chat about ball & hockey & shit, which made me wish I was still in high school cause das the stuff I misses the most, except for a few buddies left behind, hehe. We left Marc's & walked over to Puff Puff Giiive's place. On the way der was dis other party on the go & we looked in through window & this gay guy in my French class was goin right to town with the dirty dancin. It was fuckin funny. Me, Marksy & Dana just stood there pissin ourselves laughin & the ppl at the party knew it so they shut the damn blind on us. O well, I had enough of dat anyways. Der was a pretty big crowd at Puff Puff's place. Lotsa ppl I saw in school, didn't know many names though. OMG this stun guy on my floor was der, Brad & he was as friggen annoying as ever. I calls him Nikita cause he acts like Nikita except he's to the point of bein so stun & annoyin I don't like him, & Nikita is not annoyin & I loves her death! We did our best to convince him that Dana was my roomate Sonia. Dumbass. He wouldn't know difference anyways. So everybody got ready & went club so I walked back to rez by myself, not far anyways. Paul had planned go club but he showed up after, decided not go. I was glad cause I was superly upset when I got back to my room alone, thinkin bout Wade on his birthday, me & Mike was talkin bout it on MSN. I honestly got in that bad fits of cryin that Paul was like freakin out, scared there was somethin wrong with me. Ders nothin wrong with me...I only misses my buddy. I remembers he used to hawl us around in trailer on his bike, we'd sit in dis little wagon. Peter Strides taxi we called it, hehe. Bev used to make us pancakes & I'd go down Meg & Wade's fer breakfast. I rememebers the first & only time I saw a bat was in under the bridge late one night & he was the one to point it out to us. Then of course there was the time he locked me, Meg & Karen in trailer when we was youngsters & we used the fire escape to get out. We locked the keys in too, oops, hehe. He got in trouble fer it too. A my, the good old days when I never had a damn worry in the world. What'd I'd give to feel the same about Peter Strides now as I did then. I dunno, it ain't the same no more. Too much has changed. Too many memories are there. Memories are good but when I'm there, I dunno, I'm overwhelmed with like a million in 5 minutes that it's too much. Too hard.

Yesterday we got up early & went across the Bay to watch the boys play ball. I loved it, made me feel right at home again. Hugged Vic a nice bit cause I miss him, he ain't the same no more either, he was fine yesday, but I dunno, it was the first time I spoke to him in a good conversation in a long time. Boys really surprised me though, I was honestly expectin a shit team, but they wasn't bad at all, or not as bad as I thought. Hehe, we went over in taxi, me, Paul, Dana, Jeff, & Marc which was just a million stories in itself. We had no idea how we were gettin back to Corner Brook but all I cared about was gettin over to see em play. Dana & I crammed in on bus with em on the way back & boys went with this guy. Wicked, free trip on Stew's bus & free trip to Murphy's Square to get a sub. Loved it.  Didn't do nuthin last night. Had shower & got in bed cause I was beat. Paul went bowlin but it was all guys goin so...I watched Clueless & fell asleep at like 11:00. Paul called like 1:30 fer me to let him in cause I must've locked the door, dunno.

Day mom & dad came in to bring Pop home & they came up & got me. Wasn't with em very long, just enough to say I saw em basically & to have a chat. Didn't buy a single thing cause fer one thing, ain't got shit all cash & plus what I got, I wants save. On a shittier note, I got a damn urine infection which is the most fuckin uncomfortable thing in the world. Well das what I gets fer holdin my piss all yesday over ballfield. I'll need get antibiotics. Crapp, o well, anything to get rid of it. I'd rather have dis then some other crap, but it still sucks bad. A my, shit happens. Til next time..."

Plus, all our lives we've called him Poppy Penney, the same way everybody calls Pop ""Pop"". So Pop was there tryin to convince me he was my grandfather & I was like ""No Pop, ur my grandfather & dad's father is!"" but he was like ""Yeh but ders some relation but I can't figure it out,"" & I was like ""He's Bradley's grandfather Pop but not mine, Florence is no relation to me!"" I dunno if I got him to believe it or not. We did a lot of laughin though. He gave a me a bit of money, which I feels bad takin all the time but I'm next to broke so I took it, plus I'm savin it now. Then he was talkin bout he never saw no wrestlin or Bob Barker in awhile, which made him remember he had wrestlin tapes down the house he used to watch belong to Wade that we never gave back. Pop remembers him. Told me last night about when we got our roof shingled before summer he was out helpin dad & he said he remembers him comin in the porch every now & then when he popped down to tell mom a message from dad in Peter Strides. Mom would always make a point of tellin Pop it was Wade Ronald, Bev's & der boy, she'd say. Pop always brings it up about how he met it sudden, das his words, & how he says the prayer for him. Me too.

Paul came to meet me & we had a good chat on the way back. We went back in his room to watch Ice Age that he downloaded but I couldn't hear it  I didn't wanna turn it up cause Brock was out der studyin fer his Geog. So I left to come in my room & met Karen knockin on my door. I ran up there for a bit to meet her friend Mike. I likes meetin Karen's buddies (Danny's an exception, hehe, O God!) cause I can tell that they don't judge you first off at all. Mike seemed pretty nice & he's been keepin her company. When I went up they were actually in Ashley's room cause she's gone fer a bit. So I wanted to see her Grad pics cause Cora said they was nice but we couldn't find em but instead I stumbled upon a ger shit load of Cosmo magazines & DVDs. Yay fer Ashley's room!!! So I scammed a few magazines & Rat Race DVD. I plan on givin em back of course, more than likely before she gets back so she won't know we was nosyin around her room, hehe. I came back down to watch the DVD but I got tired really quick, honest God, my eyelids ached man. It was weird. So we said we could watch it another time, like night or mar or somethin. 

So on a pissier note, my god damn phone is on DO Not Disturb & it won't friggen go off. So I missed like 2 calls from mom & dad while I was here in my friggen room sat right by the friggen phone & a call from Jeff. They must think I'm off the planet o man. They all said they'll call me later & I'm like ""Too bad I won't be able to hear the fuckin phone ring!!!!!"" I called this buddy day & he said they should get back to me after dinner sometime, after I hung up I realized once again I won't hear my jesus phone ring anyways. I put a different message on my phone fer ppl to call my damn cell. Hopefully they'll get the message, I dunno why mom & dad or Jeff wouldn't think of dat anyways!!!! My God PPL!

I missed her call....crap. Plus mom & dad had just left so I was a bit weanie over that although I never cried, but then when I checked my messages, der was Tan tellin me all she wanted say was she was sorry she ain't called in awhile & that she loved me & missed me. Der I goes, snottin & bawlin. Plus this song is makin me rather homesick, not fer just home, but like it reminds me of Sand & Sea when like everyone was home.

I studied all last night. Though PH was sposed come on but checked the Net & it's night. Crap, see if I can fit it in night. I hates it here, it's only cause of this studyin racket but we was all talkin bout it smarnin, it sucks, & I still dunno if I'm ready fer all this. I can't get back into the studyin mode at all. It's retarded. I was never one to say I couldn't wait to get outta the house anyways & away from home liek Paul was. I didn't mind high school, or Burgeo when it comes down to it. I liked home when there was crowd of us. Then as more ppl graduated, BANG, no one's left. It's crazy. The only time we're all gether is Christmas & Summer. I miss Tan.... I miss Free. 2 of my bestest buddies from high school & 2 that stuck with me through everything. God knows when we'll all be gether again. 

On a brighter note, me & Cora just bought SWGC sweaters. They're cute too, yeh call us dorky all you want & God knows, I mightn't even be here next term, but der coo.

I slept like crap again last night, Paul was asleep long before I got in bed. I didn't even wanna get in bed cause I knew I wasn't overly tired but it was late & I felt like I had to. I was like wide awake fer like 2 hours & then of course everyhting once again starts goin through my head. Then that kept me up just fer the fact I was scared again....

God I can't wait to get my Psych test done & go down Gym again. Forget bout everyhting & relax. Every time I thinks bout that damn Psych test I gets sick. I knows after it's over, even if I does shit, I'll be relived cause it'll be my first test done in here & I'll know what to friggen expect. A my, am I friggen ready fer all this??? Til next time...."

We we did our Math assignment last night, we didn't actually do it considering Brock got all the answers off Imuetin. We didn't get #5 doen & today before our Math class Cora & I decided to go to SI which was bein taught by none other than friggen Pansy herslef, Krystal Lee who refused to help cause with an assignment cause she wasn't allowed too. Needless to say I was overjoyed. So then we took off up to Marksy & Dana's to see if they could help. We didn't get much more done up there. 5 minutes before that we found out that one question was wrong anyways, worded wrong. Dumass Richards. We got one more day to work on it considering it was worded wrong but I still don't think it'll be much help. I dunno, I friggen hates it. Math is makin me feel like shit & I knows I ain't the only one cause I can tell by the other ppl in my class. It rots. If I friggen fails it I'll freak. 

I think I'm gonna tell Paul stay out in his own room night cause man, I don't need go class til 12:30 mar & he needs go 8:30. Plus smarnin we set alarm from 7:15 & when he got up he realized his class wasn't til 9:30. THEN I couldn't get back sleep & I had a headache, like the one you gets when ur over tired. I thought I was gonna bust! On the plus side, he slept at the foot last night which was way more comfortable & gave me lots more room. I don't mind the bed size, that is when Paul gets up & goes class, I finds em cozy. I hates sleepin in huge beds alone anyways.

Mom & Dad will be out from trailer night so I can finally talk to em sensibly without this ger racket in my ear when they talks to me on bag phone. It drives me crazy, especially when I was talkin mom on saturday & I had killer hangover including massive headache & this ger screechin sound was goin on when we'd talk. OMG it almost drove me nuts man. Hopefully she'll put money in fer me day & gimme some on Wednesday when they're in.

I dunno, I told him I feels like we aren't together as much as we used to be & I knew stuff would change around here considering we ain't in Burgeo no more, but to me it seems like he'd rather do other stuff than be with me. Plus it seems like, well he wa the one to actually bring it up, we bitches a lot more in here. Well I was the first to admit I'm snottier. No use denyin the truth. He always tries to make me say stuff I don't wanna say when we haves these talks. Like he tried basically make me say I was thinkin bout breakin up with him or some crap. Well I mentioned takin time a part but he said he's scared we'll never get back gether. Plus if I don't have Paul, even as a close friend, I don't even wanna be in here. But maybe time is the key, I dunno, maybe not too cause I think I'd be unhappy & upset if I knew he wasn't in my life like he is now. I dunno, we never had any problems when we was home, now we fights a nice bit, not like ger load, but more than usual. Plus I'm usually left unhappy & upset but he doesn't know it. I hates keepin stuff from him but I don't wanna wean all the time too. He asked me did I think we would break up this year. I hope not & I hope the rest of the year don't go by like this cause we won't be gether next year & God only knows when we'll be gether again. Til next time..."

On the other hand, I needs study fer my Psych but can't get my ass to friggen do it. A my, all I needs do is have a shower & get at it. That'll wake me up a bit. Me & Cora needs work on our assignment again night.

Last night I went down see Pop like 7. Paul came down & met me when I walked back cause I didn't wanna walk back in dark. We watched Enough after dat & was on Net fer bit. Ing & them was goin bowlin & wanted us go but we didn't bother, I knows Paul wanted go & I told him go ahead but he didn't cause we said we'd spend night gether. Made me feel like shit though cause I knew he really would rather go bowling but he didn't cause I think he knew I woulda been a bit disappointed so basically the reason he didn't go was to not piss me off, not because he actually wanted to be with me, I dunno. Things are really different round here, but I've been talkin to Cora bout it & she's in the same boat.

So I was talkin Cora day & she said that big guy has ben up her place since & she said he's right gone over Paul, thinks he's right cocky. Scares the crap outta me dat do. Like I knows we probably picked fer it a bit, then again we never cause like man that buddy wanted to fight over nuthin & acording to wht he was tellin us, das all he does too, fight. I hates peope like that. Wicked let's go get ourslef in shit & get cops come pick us up so we can brag bout it at the next party we goes to. *Sarcastically*. What a dumbass idiot face. I think the part that scares me most is he's related to Eddie.....

I'm off to have a shower & get at the books...finally. Right now I dunno, I'm feelin not weanie or contrary, but I'm kinda wishin I was home, not homesick but home sounds good right about now, just comfort sounds good. Dammit, I wish I was home. Til next time...."

He had pics of Glen on his Computer which I friggen died at. Glen....God I'd love to be a fly on wall down der where he's at. So then we left Joe's, by the way, Kerri Berri showed up with us!!! We all left & walked up this party up above this pub thingy where we were friggen welcomed by friggen David Warren's father, Jer. Like really, what old man parties with us??? I dunno, but it was too weird fer me man. Then a few of us left der cause like the friggen smell of dope & just the overall non-party atmosphere made us make a move up to Cora's which was a pretty God damn happenin place. Met lotsa new ppl up der & they was all pretty coo. Except fer dis ger big dude who was the best one der first, like he seemed coo & he was a laugh, but he ended up bein the biggest fuckin ass der. Well at first he & Paul hit it off & like he was over around talkin to us all & shit & crackin jokes left & right. Then he started say shit to ppl so I started say shit back cause like man, I hates it when ppl don't pick up fer derself plus he wasn't like dead serious, we was just carryin on. He said he liked me cause I was saucy back at him like he was to all of us so I was like well ya know, gotta pick up fer urself & ur buddies right? So next thing I finds out he's related to Eddie, Rob's pervy old-guy buddy, who I knows lotsa stories bout, he's a sicko. So he satrts like get right freaked out cause none of us liked Eddie & shit & he started tellin us how tough Eddie was & ger buncha crap. Anyways, dropped that subject. Then he got started on Paul about his car & that he thought was the best thing in the world, & which Paul plainly stated he knew was a piece of shit. So he gets all pissed at Paul & goes over in kitchen. I sees him watchin Paul & Lindy & I seen him look at his buddy & say ""Get him with me?"" & so I looks at him & tells him to settle down & ders no need to fight & crap, plus I knew he was a big fucker & probably could cleared works of us out. Then I started get really scared cause like man, I didn't know much bout him, he probably coulda followed us home or somehtin or got us outside Cora's house to beat the crap outta Paul or somethin. From then on I tried be nice to him & stuff basically suck up his ass to be on safe side, I don't usually do that to nobody but man I was frightened shitless. The he was der tryin get Paul go club with em which we all kinda figured was just a suck up job to get Paul down der & then gang up on him. I dunno. Around one, me, Kerri, & Paul took off down road & called taxi to come get us. We got dropped off side Kerri's & me & Paul started to walk home cause it was all downhill. When we got down side the lights this taxi slowed down & God damn if it wouldn't buddy der again tryin get Paul go club. We went on home anyways, fuck dat.

Aside from buddy bein a idiot, Cora's place was excellent. We tried convince buddy that Cora was born in a dory down Francois & I was born in a toilet & my name was Berfa, LMFAO!!! Then we told him all about a girl home named Tank Kloof Green. Then of course Eddie & Christine got tossed in der, next Peter. It was a laugh. We me the guy who won the car down Tim Horton's. We called him Tim all friggen night & God damn, he was the man with all the stories behind buddy, ger fat feller. His real name was Chris but man, he looked like somebody from Rivers or somehtin, pretty laid back. Overall, I had a good night, not feelin to hot day though but like dat all goes with it, what can ya expect? Paul & them is gone golfin so I'll just flake out here fer the day, Ing called & said she's havin a nap & whoever wakes up first come get the other one, more than likely she'll wake up first o man, lol. 

I was talkin Pearl day & I was sposed call her after but my phone was dead. I plugged er in, went out in lounge & when I come back I had missed a call so maybe it was her. I called her back but der was no answer. I think she wants go movie night & I think das the plan over dis way, nah sure yet. I'd be satisfied watch Enough cause I bought it but ain't had time watch it. ut I'd go movie if everyone else was goin. See whas playin. Til next time....

Jeff called last night. He wasn't at much. He's goin home day go huntin with dad. Then I called him after & he was drivin round & sounded like Porter was on patrol with him, lol. Sonia was out here last night too fer little while, we had a good chat. She's really coo & since she's older, she's not friggen weird like some of the friggen retards on this floor cause man, ders lots here. It's weird too cause she didn't know anyone from Burgeo & I didn't know anyone from Rose Blanche but it ended up she knows Jamie King really good & well he knows Jeff really good. He was here last night for a bit, she had a few friends here. Her boyfriend is comin soon, maybe day, she wasn't sure. When she was out here she told me too that well last year Julia's friend Vanessa had my room & this Deanna girl had her room. So anyways, other day Deanna showed up & wanted to see the room & tried to convince Sonia it was friggen possessed. Like WTF right? Some people... I was like right on. 

So our friggen Math Prof didn't show up day. Didn't I say he wasn;t the brightest crayon in the box?? Well Brock decided not go class anyways & Karen never did show up so we was all just sat there, then ppl started leavin & they told stunasses (Me & Cora Dora) that if a Prof is 10 mins late we can leave so we left & came back here & downloaded ger shit loada songs. But when we was comin from English a girl in my Math class, dunno her name yet, but she talks to us a lot, told us that he showed up like 1, so der wasn't much point of stayin anyways. Didn't miss much.

I dunno what do night, Ders dis party up on Eliz. Street & I think das where boys wants go, dunno, but ders one up Chalets too. I ain't friggen goin up Chalets, I didn't like it last time. Cora said to if we goes up on Eliz Street & we don't like it, cause she said it's a small spot, we can all ""bust a move"" to her place. I'd luv dat, she got a wicked spot. 

Wonder what I can have fer supper, I wanted pizza but I think das what made Paul sick, Pizza Delight pizza but I wants homemade. Dunno, maybe I will go ahead & make it fer myself. then again I feels like meatballs & rice too. Ing'll be in soon. Yay! A girl I knows on this floor.

Seeing how I've been sleepin on the covers, havin cold showers, & got the doors swingin wide open all the time, I'm glad it cooled down a bit cause it was gettin a bit much man. Sweatin all the time sucks & here I am with Cora who barely sweats at all! Plus it was cold in all my classes day.

Mom & Dad were in day to do some crap & visit Pop. They came up & got me & Paul after we were doen classes & I shopped a bit, first time since I've been here believe it or not. I bought pair of Pooh pjs I got on sale, cute little yellow top at Garage, & a cool shirt at Sports Check. Plus I bought some other crap & mom made me blueberry muffins! Fresh from Peter Strides, berries & all! We went to Aroma's Plus fer supper, my first time there, it was good. Paul didn't go cause we brought him back up here, he had a lab at 5:20. I saw my french teacher there & it was just after I was talkin bout French to them, can't remember if I said anything bad or not. Oopsy! Doubt it though cause French is my fave. Maybe I might've said he looks like a basketball player from the 70s, lmao. Honest God he do, Brock thinks he's a bit feminine & so do Karen cause he's really small & I totally get what they're sayin, but I dunno, I needs to think about that one.

I got work do night, Crap! Crap Crap! Paul won't be outa his lab til 8:30 so I'd say I'll get a ger loada songs on the go to download & then get at it. I'm like freakin fer my Psych test but I still can't get myself to actually do it, my own damn fault. Til next time...."

"event","I have to agree with my siamese twin Miggy Jean, school is back in full swing. I have a French Quiz mar, a Math Assignment, yes another one, due fer Monday, & I have a Psych test next Thursday which our Prof advised us to start studyin fer Monday night gone. Oopsy! On the other hand I did get 100% on my French Quiz day. High Five Cora! Ok yeh it was easy vocab but I really don't care, I was proud!

So first I'd like to inform Meg that I miss miss miss you & if ur tryin to talk to me anytime on MSN, I ain't gettin ur messages cause my Net is complete crap so far. So Meg I'd appreciate it if you could pass that around to people I talks to or annoying people who tries to talk to me & then gets pissed cause I don't talk back. Not pointing any fingers but.......JOEY HARE! So please tell him it ain't my friggen fault!

I just got back from visiting Pop just down the road from here. I had to take a friggen taxi down & back cause it was like misty. I was actually looking forward to the walk too. Umm I dunno, he seems alright cause I know if he hated it there he'd tell me but we had a good chat & laughed a lot. When we was walkin around cause he was showin me around the place, this little woman kept peepin out through her door at us & then when I'd catch her she'd smile at me. Kinda pissed me off but Pop noticed it too & kept askin me what she was peepin at so we kept laughin at it all the way down the hall. Plus Pop kept stoppin, turnin around, & lookin right at her to see if she was there & then he'd look at me & laugh. A my, I'll be happier when he's home though. I think I'll be down again mar cause Mom & Dad might be in just fer somethin do so I might run up mall, go see Pop & hopefully we'll go out fer supper somewhere. I looked forward to it day cause they said they might be in day but dad had a message on my phone that they wouln't be in day. I hope they calls me night.

Tan just called. Cor's & John's birthday day so they got this ger birthday supper/party on go up der. She got a job down plant & she starts on Friday. I wish she was here......I miss her so much cause like she was gone all summer & was only back fer like 2 weeks or shit all time anyways & then gone again.

Another note to Meggy, I swear to God there is a friggen frog inside my computer! Honest God! I woke up last night & heard this sound & I thought it was ppl outside my window cause yesday Tys had some freaky ppl just led down outside his place, honest God! So everytime I heard it last night I woke up. So when Paul got up go class smarnin we heard it again & distinguished the sound to be a frog! I dunno what it is, it goes off every now & then, sounds just like one though. I hope ders nuthin wrong with my Computer. God damn well better not be, it better not be no one hackin into it. I know Karen had that problem. Crap!

I must go have a bath, get into some pjs & do some study & work, that is if I don't die of suffocation cause it's steamin down here & we're on the bottom floor fer fuck sake! I slept on top of the covers last night! Un-freakin-believable! Til next time..."

"event","Well not like I wasn't expectin all this to happen anyways, to me it just seems like it happens to everyone when you gets out on ur own & gets to a completely different environment. So I did a shit load of work the weekend, or actually Sunday night when I got back, lol so I had planned last night to do nothing. Little did I know it would involve me bein alone & really disappointed.

On Sunday night Paul went to a hockey game with the boys while me & Cora stayed in my room doin our Math. Anyways, blah blah blah blah balh....so I got done classes yesterday at 5:30 & I think Paul got done like 6:30. So my Net was like complete shit & I vowed not to do any work school related. So Paul told me he was goin to hockey game again with Mark & I was like, almost jokingly I guess, ""you never does anyhting with me anymore,"" & das when it hit me!!! That was the truth! During our past 2 weeks & a bit here, I haven't spent one second of quality time with Paul, & we're on our own fer fuck sakes! Ok yes we have slept in the same bed gether every night, but that doesn't mean we haven't went to sleep 5 minutes after we got in, & he made the point of saying he's out here between classes & I proved my point that so were Karen & Cora! So then he said I never goes out in his room, but I do!!! It's just that every time I'm der so is Brock or Joe or Mark & they don't talk to me, boys is too wound up in their converstion that Paul don't even notice me gone! It's fuckin true & I'm God damn well sick of it. So anyways, he went hockey game & left me super pissed with like no one to talk to, but then Jeff called me which cheered me up big time. So Paul called when I was talkin to Jeff & when I called him back he knew I was pissed so he acted like a prick back which made me friggen 10 times more pissed. So he dropped out later & I was watchin TV & he asked was we goin bed cause he was tired so we got in bed & I could not sleep bein super pissed at him on side of me. Plus I could not believe, in our full relationship, I think it was the first time he never asked me why I was mad! He asked did I want him to stay there & I said no so he got up & left & went to his own room. First I was upset & cried a bit cause he knows I've been having a rough time in here lately but then I said hell with it, I'm tougher den that. Last thing I was doin was admittin I was wrong cause fer one thing I NEVER EVER do dat, or not a lot anyways :), & plus I knew I wasn't. So I surprisingly drifted off to sleep, & was woke up with the phone ringin but when I picked it up der was no on der, figurin it was him I led back down & he called again & asked did I want him to come out which was the WRONG question to ask me. He was tryin to make me be like ""Yes I wants you to come out!"" but I told him I was totally fine without him considering I actually got to sleep & everything. So then he told me he wasn't alright & he once again left to come out. We talked & stuff & I told him I am not the type of person & he knows it, to sit up & wait til the time is right for him. We always made a point o ebin gether when we were home, but in here I got the feeling he thinks sleepin side by side is enough but it ain't for me. I miss like our friendship part, just like talkin & bein comfortable & tellin eachother every little thing. Now I'm gettin the feelin I'm second best or maybe even third compared to Brock or Mark, & I'd put Paul first before anyone except fer my family. I dunno, he promised to spend more time with me but I don't want him to do it if he feels obligated but he claims he don't, he really wants to. But I'm still unhappy, I dunno why, I just get the feeling he loves me less now, like not as much as he used to anyways. Is that crazy or maybe even weird? I can't help feeling like it. I dunno, I know ppl change & shit, trust me I know that, but I never expected it from Paul. It's like I spends most my time with Cora & Karen & he spends his with Brock & Mark & the resta the boys. Is it sposed be like that? Til next time........."

"event","So my first weekend home is over, went too fast, not long enough. On Saturday me & Meg & April got an order, April dropped out the house during the day. I was glad. I miss her...missed her. We wasted our full summer gether, but well there's lotsa time to catch up & well now she'll be in here with Gavin a lot. I noticed she like got a lot louder & friggen laughs at everything!!!! LMAO. Still want that table for 2 Meg???? By the way, Troy is wicked lookin now, but what is it he got done with his hair???? :)!

So Saturday night Paul was goin drinkin up Steve's & well Meg was havin ppl up so my plans were to take Scruff fer a walk & then run up, but I ran into Kerri & Dillon & ended up talkin to them fer hour & half plus Meg walked up road somewhere along the end of our conversation & said she din't bother have ppl up cause Steve was. So I walked on round Burgeo & met up with Paul, I think he was a tad bit drunk even though he would never say it. So we got in here at like 1 on Sunday but I didn't get back to my room til 7 cause we had to bring Pop to this Seniors Place cause he's stayin there for 2 weeks. Broke my heart to leave him cause he startd to break down, but I told him I'll be down to visit him as soon as I can, which will probably be mar cause I don't have late classes then. It's hard knowing that he's so close though but I can't be with him when I wants. After we dropped Pop off we picked up ger loada food fer me at Wal-Mart & Dominion cause Jeff'll be gone out hunting this weekend again so I won't be able to get groceries. I got enough to last we awhile now though.

I came back to my room last night, & well Mom went up & brought Cora down so we could finish our assignment which was half the reason I was goin crazy, plus our teacher got like the IQ of a bumble bee. Dumass. Poor ol Cora, I had ger shit load of food, & clothes & I had to move stuff around cause I brought in a new TV stand & she had no clue where to get to in my teeny room, lol. I was glad she was here though cause otheriwse I woulda had no clue how to put up my shower curtain, which is purple I might add, said to be navy. But Paul & Brock got the same one so it's worse fer 2 guys to have a purple shower curatin in there room :)! Til next time...."

                       -Billy Valentine Melbourne

A my Billy, it's good to have you around. So this is an entry from Home Sweet Home! God it feels like I was just away at camp fer a few weeks & now I'm home to stay, which I'm not, & which totally sucks. Plus like a weekend really isn't long enough to be home, I wish it was so much longer. But I dunno, I still have this feeling that I know my stay here is only temporarily.

Last night we went up carolyn's & like the majority of ppl was ppl who were away fer school & were home for the weekend like me. I had a good time, hungover day which totally surprised me cause that usually doesn't happen often anymore. No trouble to tell this is Burgeo I guess. I spent most of the night with Miggy & Ing too, just talkin about whas on go & what der gonna do next year. Paul kept bringin up his friggen workload & I told him to frig off cause I didn't come home to talk about school, I came home to escape it. I came home fairly early cause I was friggen beat. Me & mom sat at the table talkin, I poured my heart out to her about whas on the go & about the stuff runnin through my head 24/7. Mom is strong. I turn after Dad, very weak hearted. I told mom every little thing cause I finally gave in & told Paul the other night, & he's scared. He says I'm scaring him. He asked me last night to tell mom cause he knows that I think she's like the smartest woman I know, & no that wasn't an attempt to brag about my mother. But she is, strong & she knows what she's talkin about. I was glad she kept it cool & didn't freak out like I knows dad would have. She told me she wouldn't tell dad I'm in there worryin & shit all the time cause she said dad is bad enough now, just knowin I'm gone, without knowin I'm upset a lot. But I'm not homesick by no means at all, nothin like that. I just haven't been sleepin well & I'm constantly scared & worried over the ppl I love, scared somehtin will happen to them. I'm scared to be happy too, scared to say I'm happy cause I think when I do, somethin else will happen. I dunno, sounds crazy to me at times, but then I think well I can't friggen help it & I wish I was different then I am & I wish I felt differently but I don't. I dunno, I wonders a lot, is this ever gonna change? Or will it continue to get worse until I do somehtin about it? 

On a happier note, Miggy & I are having a ""date"" tonight, dining out at the one & only Highway Diner. O yeh, Shane is tagging along too, lol. Maybe to chaperone. Can't friggen wait. Dunno what I'll do night. Paul said he heard there might be more on go night then there was last night, but I'm not up for nuthin. I'll probably stay here with mom & help her get our stuff ready for mar when I go back. I'm not up for gettin on the go. Til next time...."

So I'm done my classes fer day, just came to the library where I finally got to use MSN!!!! Needs go get my ID done at 4 cause day is the last day & slack ass me left it fer the last minute! Oopsy! Plus starting Friday we needs our ID to get on our floor & crap to show we're a student or some crap. Das cause some friggen moron stole the TV from our lounge & our RA can't find it so everyone on our floor might have pay like $30 fee. Sucky ass shit! BOOOOOO!!!!

So I'm leavin with Mike mar like 4;30 cause we needs wait fer Dana get done her classes. I'll have my bag & crap packed night cause I was talkin Mike yesday out in the lounge & he wants leave 4:30 on the dot! Plus I needs do some French work night, read an article in English & work some more on my Math assignment, try my best to clue dat up. Plus I wnats go down Gym night cause I ain't been there in a few nights. Wants get one more workout in before I goes home cause I've went in ger eatin spert last few days, eatin all the time! Can't friggen help it! Dunno what to have fer supper, we got a floor meeting at 6 so somethin quick I'm figurin. 

Didn't do a thing last night, fell asleep til 7 so the I had to cook & clean up from supper. Then Paul played crib with the boys fer a bit so I went out in his room to watch Paradise Hotel. Then we came out & went to bed. I just stopped by his room before I came here cause he told me to drop out but Joe & Brock was der & I kinda just stood there fer like a minute cause das pretty much all I can take of them there just talkin & my own boyfriend who asked me to stop by ignores me. Like I got better things to do right. A my, he'll get the hint of me just leavin without a ""c-ya"" means like w/e!

Anyways, gonna write a few e-mails, go get my ID doen, do a bit of work & pack my bags all the while figurin out what to eat. Til next time...."

"event","So I slept like shit last night, not good at all. Paul fell on to sleep leaving me lying awake in the dark thinkin & worryin about lotsa crap, like wonderin about this year & thinkin about stuff in the past, especially about happenings of this summer gone. I dunno, I always got this worried feeling, always, I hate it & I think the only way I'll get rid of it is if I get help but it's like I think I'm not the type of person who needs proffessional help!!!! Or am I??? I dunno how else to stop thinkin about everything, how to stop fearing everything, how to stop being afraid of losing another special friend. I'm constantly worryin & it's gettin worse. Seems like no one in here is like it, I think das what is weird too. I dunno....

So last night me & Paul watched Legally Blond, I did a bit of French work, Shane called, & I was talkin to mom & dad. I was also talkin to poor ol Pop earlier on the cell but I got cut off which I felt horribly bad about & there was nuthin I could do about it. This morning Paul ha a class at 8:30 & mine was 10:30 so when he got up he set my alarm for what I thought was 9:30 but was actually 8:30 so I got up around 9 thinkin I had a class half past but Paul called me like 20 after & I told him I had to go cause I had a class & he's like ""Ain't ur class 10:30??"" & I was like OMF yeh! So he saved me from lookin like an ass cause I woulda walked on into my Psych class & realized it wasn't actually my Psych class. Me, Cora, Paul & Mark ate at the cafeteria day whih I told myself I wouldn't do a lot of. O well. Then I had my very first French Lab which was pretty cool, just repeating what the computer says & then having to listen to yourself is soo weird! 

Not much to say today...I'm heading home in 2 more sleeps! Yay! I miss ppl...Mig, Ing, Kita, Vic, Shane....Andy, Fre, Glen....even Porter fer God sakes! Good to get back with most of em. Til next time...GTG cook my burgars, MMMMmmmm home cooked meals!"

So my weekend was okay. I'd like to say we pretty much went mummerin in September & wore out the saying ""bust a move."" Yeh we're lame asses but there's one thing I love about it here, Burgeo ppl stick together. True! We went to 4 different parties in like a matter of 2 or 3 hours so we were like mummers in a sense except no we didn't get offred drinks, we had to bring our own, lmao. So ""bust a move"" came in every time we decided to move from one place to another. Umm I didn't get really drunk & that pissed me off cause I think I sobered up with all the friggen walkin we did from place to place. But o well, things are different here & that's what I expected I guess, but I'd still rather be home down Rob's drinkin!

So On Saturday me & Cora went up Wal-Mart to get food & crap. We went at like 4;30 & got home like 6;30. No we didn't friggen walk! Thankfully Jeff is here to scoot us around. Then I came home & had to figgen bar myself in my dungeon cause I had a migraine like the size of my ass! Honest God! Light killed me & everyone who came had to sit & talk with Paul in the dark cause I was like near unconcious or das what it felt like. It was ridiculous. So I slept like all night & Paul watched movies. Overall it was a shitty night. 

Last night we all went to a hockey game down the Civic Center cause Jeff & them was playin & I means it, if it wasn't for the Burgeo line der team would be complete & udder shit! It was still fun, fights & all included & Brock almost totally freakin out. GTG check the resta my mail & get me books fer class. Til next time...."

Ok so I'll admit I cries every time I talks to Pop on the phone, breaks my heart but that has been the only time I've cried. I've even had dad here to visit yesday & let him go on & didn't break to tears. But today Tan called from her apartment & I wasn't expecting this call til mar cause she said she'd be back in to get her stuff on Sturday but her mom brought her in today instead. So it was around 12 & I had a class half past so she took off down jut to give me a hug she said. So me & her & Brock walked out to the main entrance & at this point brock had no idea she wasn't goin to CONA as planned cause he looked at her & said ""Wha school u goin to?"" then she hugged into me & started to cry which led to me bawlin my eyes out. Lettin her go fer 4 months was super hard, it was all bad enough she wasn't here all summer & I only got to spend like a week or 2 with her. Poor ol Tan, I hope she's alright cause I know she's been upset for awhile about this whole school/work/PEI decision. I'm proud of her though, like I can totally get it that Cora is a bit disappointed cause I know I would be too if i was in her shoes, but as my best friend I'm glad she chose not to go to school now than to do it a month down the road with money one down the drain. I think she made a good decision & I support her all the way. She asked my advice the other day cause she was like superly upset about it all & I told her I would go with her dad, not with Joan cause I know she'd be happy with her dad & Beck. I'm glad she never had it in her head to live with Joan & Corey in the first place, & to what ppl may think, when she told me he's not moving over there for Cor, I totally believe her. Tan wouldn't lie to me. I support her & I'm happy for her. I just wish she would get outta an unhappy relationship. I wish her the best of luck. I just wish I didn't have to let go of her now."

"event","K so I just got up, so much for my last day to sleep in. Well I was lying awake in bed & I was gettin super pissed cause I thought I heard mom & dad out here bitching about me & I was like OK so I'm leaving mar & all they can do is bitch???? But it must have been Jeff they was talkin bout cause I got outta bed & dad was fine with me, unless whatever they was talkin about me for blew over fast, but with dad that usually doesn't happen. So when I was lying awake in bed Scruff was der with me & I was thinkin aside from mar which will be a mad rush, this is my last morning to wake up with Scruff. Then I started cryin & to be honest it wouldn't take much for me to do it now either. Like call me crazy, cryin in bed with my dog, but man, he's a super big part of my life, my best friend in the whole world & he's been sleepin with me since Grade 3. Like man why is this so hard. So here I am sittin to my Computer sobbin to my Computer screen & what for? Cause I'm movin 2 hours away? Cause I'm startin a completely different school life? Cause I'm leavin my family? friends? I dunno, maybe all of the above. I just wish I wasn't so soft hearted like I am. It really sucks at times like this. Plus I'd like to know why this is all kickin in now? How am I gonna be mar when all my thinkin & shit becomes my reality? 

Gavin had ppl up last night. I had a good time, but honestly, it wasn't how I wanted to spend my last friday here, it was enough ""up-beat"" for me, or at least I wanted it to be up-beat last night since it was out last Friday here. When Kita left I was talkin to Lindy & I had to fight back my tears. I'm pretty sure I'll see her day cause I'm makin a point to see all my buddies day or tonight. I'm kinda dreadin it to be honest. When Free left I was fine cause I'm used to him leavin us by now, but I'm not used to bein the one to leave. 

I think I'm goin to the wedding night. Cor was allowed to invite a few of his friends & he told me & Paul to go. I'd be super excited on your average night but since I knows when I goes home from it, it'll be my last sleep in my bed makes me weanie all over again. Plus I'd like just to relax night & make a few minor packing adjustments, but like everybody is goin so it'll give us a chance to be gether one last time til like Christmas.

I dunno, this feeling sucks, & I hates myself for bein like it cause I totally realizes that everybody has to do this at some point & some of my friends'll be in der but I still feels like this. I'm thinkin my next entry will be in Corner Brook, maybe I'll update later today, who knows. Til next time....."

"event","I have no idea whas on go fer night but I do know it's my last Friday here, last ""time"" fer a little while. I'm not worried cause I'm pretty sure I can come out here on weekends whenever I want to except when the winter time comes & the Burgeo road is crap. I'm gonna try & space out my visits home unless there's something big on the go like a ball tournament. I'll be home if the boys or girls hosts the Provincials here. That'll make me weanie knowin that I won't be able to play with em, but actually I'll be more relaxed then usual cause when I plays ball I gets super nervous. 

Last night I didn't do much, went out late kinda cause me & mom were busy with stuff & thn she wanted me to go fer a walk with her up Sandbanks. So Paul came up & got me & I had to carry around a few Grad pics & then we sat up down shop for a bit. Not much on the go but what the hell did I expect?? Then me & Paul went up his place & watched TV.

So as I was sayin, I have no clue whas on the go night. I wish tonight was like last Friday & we could have it here. Jeff is indeed comin out but mom & dad aren't oin in cause dad got a bad eye, plus I think they thinks I would be hurt if they left me my last weekend here, which I wouldn't considering I ain't gonna be far & now they'll have to get someone to come stay with Pop when they wants to go in trailer. I'm wondering if Pop even gets it, like gets the fact that I'm not gonna be here everyday now? Mom has told him a few times so he must know cause mom had to leave him alone when she went to Univ & then came to Burgeo. He must understand, or I hope he does. That's another reason I'm considering comin home maybe a few weekends cause Pop is gettin old now & I wouldn't want anything to happen to him while I'm away. But there's one thing I've learned, you can't avoid it happening & there's nothing you can do about it, but still, I wanna spend more time with him. I'm also hoping Scruff isn't scared of me when I comes home like he was when Jeff came back from Fort Mac. That was funny, he was frightened shitless of the man with the beard which was Jeff but poor ol Scruff didn't know the difference. Well I won't be gone that long for him to forget me. A well, all a part of takin another step into life I po. Somethin to get used to, hopefully won't take long. Til next time.....I love all you Burgeo ppl! Well most of you!"

"event","Well Im supposed to be working on an assisgnment but I cant but bothered. Matte rof fact I really dont want to do it. Can you believe it half of the uni semester is nearly passed and I have completed at least 20-30% of my average grade. Woot! But still havent received any of my marks. 

In greater news. I fell over in the middle of Broadway shopping centre and grazed my knee. I now only look like an 8 year old I feel and act like one too. Joel also bought a nintendo wii which means countless hours of computer games especially mario party - my new vice. 

I have taken to drinking mochas not lattes as no one knows how to make a latter. Froth - no more than a 1/3 of the cup not half a cup or none at all  - thats just wrong and poor barista skills. I dream of going to Italy and drinking real coffee and eating carbs. 

Carbs are my friend as Jaime and I have discovered - revered food group of our existence. Cakes are also important in the scheme of things too. Work is going well - I have been working with Jai for the past month and now Im bsck to Mascot, world of bogans, office junkies and ethnic civilisation as it is. No more homosexuals, meterosexuals and art fags. Shucks Im going to miss them ! I seen Rachels friend a few weeks ago - I forget his name but we met once when I was out with Caley and Rachel was at the same venue. Funny that...

Ive been discussing Australian values and normalcy in a few of my lectures and have discovered a new found passion of mine. I love this stuff - the whole identity thing and what is normal. Shame the classes I discuss this in is full of education/business students who really dont get the politics behind all this. 

Funniest thing ever was about 3 weeks ago I had this debate with a girl over the fact you cannot get sodium out of sodium chloride as once its combined you cant separate again and you she told 'uhhh maybe you can?' I replied insistently 'no you cant' then she repeated the question. I said with an angry look no you cant. Long aand behold she was from the education faculty. But isnt that suimple knowledge. Dude you are going to be teaching my children one day and you dont know basic chemistry. PS sodium is a highly reactive metal thats like rubber when its by itself - combined with chlorine and its table salt. You cannot separate a solution...

In other news - Joel and i have been going out for 7 months, its full time and for a long time i think. Long Long  like several years. Its fabulous. 

Anyway must fly - do have uni work to do, 

Nat xo

PS Earthdance is on at Sydney Park near Newtown - looks like a tops festival - gold coin entry, live music and markets. I encourage all you housebodies to go. Jai, Joel and I will be thereand square, drinking chai and eating vegan brownies while the sun shines and the music plays..."

Not much has really happened, I watched 80% of Hot Fuzz before falling asleep and now Im doing uni work and checking out the net while Joel watches a dvd in bed. Comfy time...

"event","The best thing about this week is going back to uni and begining to study again which is fabulous as when Im at uni I actually feel productive and I save money as opposed to working full time when I blow all my money and feel depressed and unproductive.

My biggest complaint is the new computers at uni have really small keys on the keyboard  and the fact that I spent $200 on books for my world lit unit. 

Uni results last year were ok - credits for everything. This semester Im aiming for distinctions to improve my average.

My birthday is in 17 days and Im considering having dinner on saturday 17th August with my friends at urban bites at newtown. Cheap food and fairly easy to get to ie a bus from railway square. RSVP if u can make it. Otherwise will send out formal email soon enough.

I told mum I want DKNY gold for my birthday and Im buying myself this...

http://www.oroton.com.au/pc-45-30-signature-hobo.aspx

Expensive Yes, classic definately and its something that will go with my whole wardrobe forever. Other than that I really dont need anything. Joel might make me pretty jewellery. 

In other news Joel made me the prettiest ring for our 5 month anniversary. ITs rose gold with champagne diamonds all the way around a whole 86 of them. Very sparkly. I also got a yellow gold band with blue topaz and peridot in a zig zag pattern. I wear them together and that pretty much the only jewellery I wear in addition to my watch.

Ive been eying off this cool black pierre cardin watch with CZ on the face but I dot know if I can afford that and the new handbag for my birthday.

Anyway nothing much more to say,
Love u

"event","Jais birthday celebrations were wonderful - filled with dancing and drinking. Need I say more. Joel ended up coming and he stood in the background most of the night letting me and Jaime continue our reign of joy. It was nice being with everyone and being silly. It made me feel better than I have been in a while. 

I went to a Greek wedding ceremonby today - it wa Joels family friend. It was beautiful despite me not knowing what they what they were talking about 60% of time. I stood there most of time grinning at Joel at his silly comments and generally feeling warm and cosy in regards to our relationship. 

I feel so happy with us it seems like it will last forever. The cynical Nat is now considering marriage for the first time ever. It seems like ill be just another 20 something jumping on the engagement bandwagon and I dont really want to unless I know it will be right. Im planning an engagement in 5 years perhaps, then marriage in another 5 nothing too soon. Im too young and silly but thats what Joel loves about me - the little girl grin and glow in my eyes.

Anyway tommorow I have my first exam at 2pm. Wsh me luck I havent really considered studying Im too relaxed. Ill probably just look over my notes and take a deep breath.

Tuesday Joel and I are spending a day together which will be nice. Probably eat lunch and do some shopping nothing much.

Havent been up to much just dinner with Joels parents, work, playing xbox 360 all because of Joel moving it to my house, shopping and cleaning my room. 

joel has moved in which has resulted in mass wardrobe infiltration, new LCD tv and xbox 360, boy mess and washing chaos.

Today I was supposed to do some washing and study for my exams next week but I havent. Not too concerned - considering getting up and being proactive but the bed and pjs sound more attractive. 

Spent most of the day patrolling myspace am astonded at the potential engagements and births happening where I used to live. However have decided its the rural thing to do.

Last night went to see my sister dance - was good considering it was a public schools showcase which resulted in minimal sluttiness and lesbian themes. Much to my happiness it was rather demure and well presented. In terms of choreography by teachers it was fantastic.

Anyway at a loss for news.

Saturday going out for Jais birthday - Pah-vil-ion at 9 I think.

Sunday I have a wedding to go to.

Monday to wednesday exams

"event","During the past few weeks I have felt at my worst - a case of a severe low I just havent been able to shake. IN turn I have caused much worry to my family and immediate friends.

The worse thing is I feel like I cant escape and it just lingers - emerging to make me sad and all alone again. 

My mum and Joel have been great but it feels like they havent helped at all like its only something I can get myslef I out of. 

Uni work has been getting done but with meagre effort and if I have tried I get really anxious and stressed about it. My last major essay I am handing in late because I couldnt afford the stress of getting it done in 3 days. Thus losing 10% but not the last of my sanity.

My relationship with Joel is suffering cos it feels like I need him more and I only get to see him for 3 hours at the most as he works. So I get upset and sometimes angry at him and he gets upset at me cos im not telling him why I feel like this cos I dont have an answer.

I just want to crawl up and sleep but I have my essay to finish.

I feel so alone but I have so many people around me who care about me.

I want this feeling to stop but it wont.

I think its a combination of uni work, the death of someone close, my mum and her worries, my crazy grandad and him harassing me, not seeing Joel as much as i used to, not seeing any of my friends as much especially Punk and not having the money to do as much as I used to.

Meh!"

- Have made an active attempt at uni since last week. 

- Started work on 2 of my major essays due.

- Have considered doing work on my major article but have continued to draw at straws due to the fact I really cant be bothered with journalism anymore.

- Have developed succint article writing as opposed to long winded sentences that go nowhere.

- Have considered my PR report but have decided to hate that too.

- Have saved $600 for my car rego. Only $300 to go by the 26th May.

- Decided that this weekend im going out no matter what.

- Been with Joel for 3 whole months and 4 days. 

- Joel and I now have pet fighting fish at his house. My fishy is red. His name is Oscar. Joel has a blue one and his name is Tooky.

- My Joel has a job now so I have more time for uni now and our time together now means so much.

- Joel graduated 2 weeks ago and I bought the most amazing dress. So chic! and only $20 so cheap and chic.

Friday I had Good Friday Lunch at my Nan and Pops with all the family and my Joel. It was really cruisy and after lunch I had to go to work for 4 hours. Saturday I worked for 11 hours which sucked but it flew by. I went out to dinner with Joel and his parents and had Nepalese food which was yummo. Joel and I then went easter shopping at Coles at 10pm which was entertaining to say the least. 

Sunday morning I woke up to Joel as I do most mornings these days and it was beautiful cos I was spending the day with the boy I love and my crazy family. We went to Luna Park with my family. My little cousin who is 6 went on the Wild mouse ie the mini rollercoaster with me 10 times. It was crazy. I conned Joel into going on the ferris wheel despite being scared of heights. My cousin Jess gave Joel a picture of her and my Uncle on the Wild mouse with their finger up. My mum gave Joel a pic of me and my sister on the wild mouse. It was cute. 

All in all it has been a fun few days. Monday I went shopping with Punk to Birkenhead Point I didnt buy much - just a pretty Fleur Wood skirt and some shoes for joel. 

Last night I had dinner with at Joels house and today we slept in to 12.30. It was wonderful. I got up had a shower and Joel came home from the shops with brunch. Unfortunately Joel has left me with his computer while hes downstairs finishing off a gold cuff for a client. 

Tommorrow I have lunch with Jai, Sam and Caley which will be fabulous as I havent seen them in ages. Then its work on Thursday and maybe uni work on Friday or maybe a daytrip to the Blue Mountains with my Joel.

Anyway must do stuff besides idle procratsination. 

Love Nat xo

PS Passover at Joels has been amusing. THe food is healthy but basic in that every meal contains matza - a flat unlevened bread thats like a cracker. Ive stayed away from chicken liver and red horseradish. Tonight bread can be eaten again which is good cos I like bread."

I have noticed as I walk down George St/Broadway you are wearing those dreadful smock dresses. Unfortunately you have curves and breasts so you look like a fool with a short hemline and a high necked sack-like dress on. I do not care who designed your smock you look stupid. You are a modern women unless u are waif like you are covering a beautiful figure. 

Please stop wearing them so I do not have to vomit my breakfast up each time I see you or at least wear it true skank style and slash the neck to reveal some skin. 

While you are repairing your smock please burn them ankle boots you like to wear with stockings and short fashion items. You also look stupid in them too.

Love always your fashion advisor,

PS As much as you think COUNTRY ROAD is cool cos I agree, I dont agree with the cult of CR bags that you are carrying. I know it may be a Sydney Uni thing but its definately not a Notre Dame thing and its definately not a seen in public thing.

For one thing Im scared you might topple over in a struggle with the bags contents and ur elegant little frame.

I seen puppet shows, a ventriloquist, a dance/spoken work production (Joels sisters production - so pretty - so contemporary flamenco), comedians, street performers, a puppet made from a garbage bad and the amazing drumming monkeys (a kids show but obsenely funny and Joels fav thing ever, will have to hold a screening of teh DvD Joel bought). 

I ate out every day at cafes along Rundle St. Went shopping on Rundle St. Went to markets. Ate festival food. Spent half a day in bed. Went to the Adelaide Hills. Ate junk food. Laughed until my sides hurt at Joels sisters bf. Seen my bf get stoned (which was a little weird, against my anti-drugs thing but in essence was Joel just being cruisy and reliving his days as a highschool student). 

Met Joels dad and step mum. Made a lasting impression on Joels family despite my inate Sydney ability to smile fakely all the time. Generally just got along with everyone I met.

In essence, in the words of Joel, I was an art fag for four days. 

Had fun. Glad to be back in the civilisation that is Sydney however.

Booked my tickets tonight which cost me a week and half of my pay for three days and two nights but its just enough time to chill out and get away from the city. As well as spend (more) time with my bf. Luckily my bf can also be my tour guide since he lived in adelaide for most of his life...

It feels as though my friends stay away from me now since I have a bf - I dont know why but meh. Im happy and if they cant accept that then i cant accept making an effort. Its not as if I dont give them the time, Id give them an entire week - I just dont get asked to do anything so I just spend my time with joel. Dont know what to do so Ill just do what im doing until things happen.

Anyway Im further isolating myself from study and homework cos Im so happy. It gets done just not weeks in advance only hours and minutes in advance.

Must fly have a little study to do and joel has been left alone with my parents. Not that they dont get on - they love each other more than anything. He probably thinks ive ran away from him.

So Im at uni being an uber cool second year looking down upon all them kids that are definately first years cos I just happened to finish school before them I am so better than them. LOL NOT REALLY but Ill tell myself that cos it makes me smile bigger than normal.

I strolled down the street almost dancing to the funky new CD i bought last tuesday Modular's Leave them all behind 2. So indie so electronica so alternative. I brushed this guys hand as i was on the verge of dancing down broadway I mumbled sorry and flashed him this masive grin.

Life couldnt get more perfect. I have a fabulous bf, some form of money, appeal, a blossoming study life, friends that love me, family that love me, a social life and a  sydney existence.

I cant get over how well Joel and I get on. It seems so perfect so idealistic and at times it feels as if we will be together forever and its only been 2 weeks / 2days. Its crazy and it doesnt feel as if this feeling will ever subside. 

Im at uni today for one lecture at 10.30am which sucks big time but then Im going to Joels so Im excited. I have PR homework already which I was going to do last night but Joel came over and shattered any prospects of me doing that. Not that I mind. Im kinda addicted to him just being around. 

Tonight because Joels at Tafe I might go to dinner with jai as wed im at uni for a good 2 hours lol. But yeah I miss my punk. Its not as if im neglecting her because of Joel we just dont see each other as often as we should. 3 times a week isnt much. 

Saturday I have the house to myself and Joel is coming over. We are going to crack open his uncles wine. (His uncle owns a vineyard in the barossa valley which could be bad with jai and i's alcoholic tendencies) So we will most prob drink wine, eat, chat and sleep. In essence avoid mardi gras and the chaos of the city. 

Im considering going to Adelaide fromthe 23rd to the 26th with Joel to meet his sister and some of his family but the flight will cost $300 which is kinda epic since im a uni studnet but I guess we will just wait and see. 

Anyway enough about Joel and my state of happiness. Next entry will be a guarenteed depressing one. :P

"event","So far Ive worked four days straight and Im so over it. I have 2 to go so my total working hours this week will be 60 hours making me a pile of money but no fun in the process.

Last Nite me and my fav punk Jai to the P went to a funky Newtown cafe 'Urban Bites' for dinner. It was a recommendation from my boss and it was so good. Punk and I being communal eaters shared a plate of seafood antipasto and roast vegie stack. We then had 99% fat free gelato from the the best gelato shop evah - Gelatomassi. We spent the night chatting about work, lack of semi-attached bf, the phil adventure, the ben adventure, the cammeron adventure and the lack of sex/fabulous sex. 

We then determined we would go to Waynes 21st birthday together then celebrate a punky anniversary  afterwards. 

Sunday Punk and I are going out with our workmates to the Golden Sheaf at Double bay darling. Its going to be interesting to say the least. I will have to pull out my finery for the occaision.

Tonight Cammeron called me. There was a heap of background noise it sounded like skateboards grinding and people talking *shrugs* He suggested we catch up on the weekend. I suggested saturday perhaps after the 21st and he concluded that i should call him and we will meet up. Hopefully things work out. He seems nice enough but im not attaching myself emotionally to him.

Jeff lossely referred to me as a slut last nite after I called him concerned about his state after he messaged me 3 times. So all today he has tried to clarify things and throw the whole issue at me. I told him to just leave me alone. It hurt me what he said and its definately far from the truth. I guess hes hurting that im moving on but no need for extreme name calling. Thats just childish. I also mentioned that I might be meeting up with a guy i met while i was on the phone and he got all cut. I only mentioned it in passing and he has a hissy fit like some 10 year old. In all honesty i just hope he finds someone to love and soon because its starting to annoy me all his judgements and ideas he has about me. 

I found out my uni timetable on tuesday and I have 2 hours at uni on mon and tues then 4 hours on wed and 6 hours on fri which kinda sucks but also leaves alot of room for studying. Not much time for work but I will survive on 2 days of work (I hope). My textbooks are going to cost $250 which isnt bad considering i only have to buy 3 with my stupid PR textbook costing $120. Ick...I think I might go and buy them on monday.

Anyway not much else has happened, 
must pace away the night,

"event","Guess whos had a few fun days?

ME!!!

Thursday was Big Day Out bliss. Grooved to dirty electro, dirty beats and dirty rock with my dirty punk. Seen alot of people we knew which was odd. BDO is so mainstream that everyone goes just for the hell of it which means alot of hardcore fans miss out especially those trashy sluts. WHat Id give to hit them. Seen the odd bands/individuals and avoided the main satge all day due to the sheer crappness of it. 

Friday me and my punk went to Norton St for brunch which was delightful. Splendid chaps. Ate and done a social commentary on the Italian haven of Norton St. Also bought 2 new cds - Pinky Tuscadero and Phoenix. Tres fun!

Saturday was work then the usual going out. Met up with K and all the school crowd. Was kinda boring cos we were at Pah-villion so crap music wise and uber mainstream trashy skank wise. So what was a girl to do but drink. Drunk 8 drinks and was merry. Brad and I danced like indie kids on the dance floor and amused ourselves with moves such as the penguin, wax on wax off and the charlie. 

Changed venues to Star Bar which isnt a step up in venues but a step across just without the indian minority. I pullled up this guy who had the same tshirt as his friend who later turned out to be his brother and got chatting. He was noice. 

The guy was Cameron a baker who lived at Darlinghurst, skated and was 21. Cute and tall. We danced to horrid 90s dnce tunes and K, Jai, Johnny and I caught a cab to the Orient with the nightclub closed we retreated to the Quay where we deliberated what to do. I rang Cameron and we met up again. We decided to walk to his house in Darlinghurst.

I talked and talked some more which amused him and made me less bored. We walked all the way from Myer in the city to Darlinghurst. It was a long walk but an enjoyable one. I stayed at his house to 6 in the morning we mainly slept, talked and fooled around as young people do. Oddly enough he wasnt into one night stands which was a nice change from all the other guys I have been with. He said he would contact me during the week and we would do something so I guess it sounds promising. 

Today I woke up at 1 after falling asleep at 7am. I read the paper and went shopping with Jai at Eastgardens. I bought 2 new stussy tshirts and some billabong jeans. I know cringeworty but they are so nice and they are dark denim. SO HOT! Bought a mask from Lush to clear skin some more. 

Got home and cleaned out my wardrobe which was invigorating. IT means I have space for more new stuff. Not that I need it. 

This week Im working Mon-Tues at Surry Hills and Wed-Sat at mascot which means im going to have no life but it also means that next week I will be cashed up to the extreme. I might do dinner with Cameron sometime this week other than that no real plans. Will have to go out on Sat nite to cleanse body.

Must dawdle away,

"event","To compensate for the loss of indie kid attachment. Saturday night Jai and I had about 5 drinks and done a venue hop. We went to Pavillion, the Observer, the Orient, Establishment, Bar 333, Kinselas, and, Jacksons. It was fun we venue hopped mainly to people watch and evaluate the crowds.


We talked to the Gaffs British spruiker who advised us not to go to the Gaff but go to Havanna we decided against it. 

Jai didnt really want to go to Spectrum. So I couldnt check out hot indie boys. Sigh. Instead we watched gays boys and fake bake chicks strut around on oxford st. Much to my enjoyment. 

Not once did I try and pick up. I just danced and enjoyed myself in an innocent fashion. 

We met up with my mum at the observer and decided to abandon her due to tipsy state. It was innocent fun. Next week we will have to go to spectrum. 

Today I woke up with no hangover and went into the city to buy Big Day Out attire minus my punky friend who spent the day with Phil. I went to David Jones and bought a purple Bonds dress that was reduced from 40 to 25. Its pretty and suitable for BDO. Not skanky, cool and cute. I can also wear it with my sneakers. 

I also bought a pair of $320 italian jeans for 80. They are stripey inside and super hot. I also went to land of trash SES and picked up a pretty black tshirt with flowers on it for the bargain price of 5 bucks. 

It was one productive day of shopping.

At 2 I met up with Caley, Matt, Allan, Jeff and Adrian at Bar Broadway where the boys had a few games of pool and a few drinks. It was cruisy and in essence perfect. It was a get together for Matts birthday. Relaxed atmosphere in all. 

On the way home Jeff and I caught a bus home together and we were close a little too much. He kissed me and I didnt object. I dont think we should do anything. Its kinda not good for our friendship. 

Anyway Monday and Tuesday Im working at Surry Hills and Wednesday Im working at Mascot. Thursday is Big Day Out and I cant wait! After BDO Jai and I are going to go to Spectrum with her brother and cousins so its going to be a big night aswell. At least I have Friday to recover before work on Saturday. 

Must run,

Today I woke up and listened to Cansei de ser sexy and phoenix my indie bands that David recommmended and I was happy. Happy because the last time I had sex I had sex to the band phoenix and listening to it in the car made me feel really good cos I was seeing David tonight. 

I smiled and thought things cant get better. Work was cruisy and I was just content. I messaged David and he was 90% sure he was going to bandits. That made me happier as I felt like dancing. 

I left work tired but happy cos I was going out. I ate a good dinner then rang david he didnt answer his phone. I got off the phone and there was the message. 

""I think you should move on: I got back with my ex.""

THEN the world came crashing down again and my world felt so lonely again."

"event","Havent posted in so long nto because Ive been busy but because I couldnt be bothered to sit and type due to being a little self absorbed. Too self absorbed to worry about telling my story to the world. In a round about mish mash I will tell you what I have been up to in a series of points.

* Holiday was bliss. Involved vintage shopping, a beach day, a music festival, riding off all the beach sluts I used to go to school with now working at the pub, seeing my boy toy (boy toy in that hes so cute and was my best friend in high school)- Jason, a drunken friday in which i consumed alot of jaiger and red bull, and, tequila and lemonade, chatting to to my indie  boy every day and driving my uncles car everywhere.

* Got back and there was dramas with my indie boy who wa contacted by his estranged Korean gf. I thought I was going to lose him or that I was just the other woman (again). I was an emotional wreck because after me missing him on my holidays and vesting so much in teh relationship I thought it was the end. Instead he was just sorting things out and resolving all the little issues I found out later on. 

*Tueday I had a naughty day I slept in, had pancakes, went and seen Happy feet and had a pie for lunch *faints in shock*. It involved no physical activity so this week Im making up for it. 

* Work and more work. LOL

* Wednesday night I applied for a car loan to buy my uncles car because Im earning enough money and will be even when I go back to uni. Im borrowing slightly more than the value of the car so I can buy some shares and new laptop as well as a car. I guess its my way of taking more financial responsibility and in some ways forcing me into budgeting instead of blowing money on stuff I dont need. Im excited yet a little scared its such a big step for someone who is only 19. Cant wait til I get an answer. Most prbably tues or wed. 

*Saturday night went out to dinner at the Hernandez Cafe off Oxford ST sheerly because Jai and I know the owner. Went with sam and Jai - got slightly tipsy on a jug of sangria were laughing and talking about all things naughty. Had blacklisted indie boy as hadnt heard from him and decided I was going to find another indie boy to lust over but he answered one of my messages and I fell head over ballet flats again. Went to Pavillion seen Anna and Tash then went to the Orient which was filled with older people. Tried to set up sam with some younguns to no avail. Night was fun and for once Jai and I behave because we are semi-attached. 

* Sunday I went to spotlight and bought buttons and ribbon. I wove ribbon ribbon through this bag I bought and it looks super pretty and I made some button necklaces. I also started pricing a new laptop. Im considering buying a Mac or a pretty sony laptop. Until I get my loan I will just lust over new gadgetry. 

*Today I picked up new sheets Mum wanted then went to the city to have lunch with David. However that was changed when he rang up at 11 and said Nat lets to go to an alcoholics anonymous meeting. Being caught out all of a sudden I said yes and before I knew it we were listening to stories of recovering acoholics. He told me he went to feel better that he didnt have the issues they had but I felt compassion for them and wanted to help them. Luckily we left after an hour and we went had lunch at Japanese a much more savoury activity for a second date. We then went shopping for a man bag for david. It was amusig just to be with him. He makes me smile and he also makes me think hes one crazy cat. 

* Tommorow I might cruise to Kensington to check out this factory outlet and possibly see Marie Antoinette at Newtown. 

* Wednesday noght I might go to the Becks Festival Bar and see Midnight Juggernauts with David since Jai is at Forster on holidays. 

* Sunday Matt, Jai and I might go for lunch at Newtown. Might invite David."

Last Tuesday I went to Teppenyaki at Newtown for Erins birthday. It was fun and I got to meet all her friends from highschool. She gave me a pretty fairy book for christmas. 

Wednesday through to Sunday I worked but that didnt stop me from having fun on Friday night. I went out with Jaime and Kyra to Pavillion and Star BAr where we danced and drunk and in essence had a fabulous time. We then met up with Caley and Sam C at Spectrum where we continued to drink and dance to dirty electronica. Dirty in that it had wicked fat beats and despite being 80s vs 00s there was little evidence of heavily mashed up 80s tunes. It was fabulous and Jai and I had suffered from massive grins. 

This guy comes up to me and starts chatting to me telling me his friend was the larger DJ and that hes from California as in Lagunna Beach. I smile and think interesting. He buys me a drink - a shot of white sambucca and Im more interested. Hes wearing skinny leg jeans, a black singlet slashed at the sides revealing tattoos and a bling chain. Hot indie kid I must say. 

We leave Spectrum and he follows us on an adventure to Jacksons he tells me he is a med student and is going to summer school at USyd. I swoom over his tales and his intellectual conversation despite our mutual state of drunkeness. I also learn he owned a company for three years and that hes 23. We end up at Jacksons after an eventful walk. I walk in and walk out with jai in tow. In a matter of seconds we exchange numbers and we get into a cab.

Saturday when im eating lunch, he rings me and suggests we meet up for dinner at the quay. That scared me a little so i suggest newtown as its central. All day at work i suffered from a hangover much to my bosses amusement. By the end of my shif im exhausted, i go home have a nap and i then i get ready to go out for dinner. 

We meet at 9 and he is wearing a purple t and green skinny leg jeans. TRes hot. We go to dinner at some swanky place and consume some gelato afterwards. We sat in the restaurant and talked. Our food went cold as we talked so much. I learnt he has travelled extensively (last semester break he went to Korea), he goes to Avondale College at Morrisset, has studied in England, hes company produced 80s synth electronica which paid for his first year of college at UCLA, the stories behind his tattoos, a fair amount about his family. I was a little all over the place due to my lack of sleep.

After dinner and dessert we went back to his place where in essence we just chilled with some fun thrown in on the side. We sat and listened to his favourite songs and I was intrigued by him. He made me smile as it was just so cruisy. Oddly reminiscent of a high school date but a little more mature. I left his place at 2 and got home at 2.30.

I was happy on Sunday and work flew by. I finished early and went home and slept in preparation for NYE festivities. Jai and I swung by Daniels small house party and we caught up with Matt and everyone. Jai and I the went back to my place ate and went into the city. It was packed. We went to the orient had a drink, danced and went and saw the fireworks. We watched the revellers and were amused in each others company.

Jai and I met up with Phil and walked back to his apartment. I left as things seemed imminent between them. For NYE David ie the boy i went on a date with was at milsons point with friends, cameras and tripods so he went straight home after midnight. The first New Years message I got was from him. That made me smile. 

Tommorrow Im at work. IM contemplating seeing Cansei de Sexy at Bar Broadway before I go away on Wednesday. I just messaged David to see if hes interested. Other than that Im away from Wednesday to Saturday (well i think sat we will leave). Before I leave however I have to pack my bags and contact some old friends as well as see jai and david hopefully. Sunday when I get back Im going for afternoon drinks at the Bank hotel at Newtown with Matt and Jai and whoever else is interested. Am excited anbout my week ahead already. 

Too many things to do, to little time.

In the meantime Happy New Year!

Today ie Christmas was my first day off in 5 days and I had fun. It started early ie 15 to 6 and we unwrapped presents and it was amusing to watch dad open his presents one by one taking 15 minutes on each present examning them. It was off to Nan and Pops for breakfast where we opened more presents and received the traditional bag of money from my grandparents. 

I got a shiny shiny watch off my parents and some stuff I picked out like underwear, PJS, a cd, a black handbag, a pirate scarf, a big day out ticket. I can finally wear my pearls I bought myself. I got perfume off my uncle and off jai some a collection of button jewellery made by jai and some pictures of newtown jai bought and then mounted for me. 

In other words I fared well. 

I saw Jai and her family for christmas and then i came home and done the traditional eat and drink thing. It was fun yet relaxing yet amusing.

Overall pleasant.

Tommorrow its my mothers birthday and in the night Im going to teppenyaki at Newtown for Erin's birthday then its back to work on Wednesday.

Merry Christmas Everyone!

"event","Apart from the usual work routine, making gossip and being the gossip at work I did go out on Saturday night despite being a little tired.

Jai and I went to Spectrum to see some bands notably British India and The Devoted Few. We also saw a band called Skull Squadron who loved a bit of distortion pedal with the lead guitarist possessing at least 20 of them. At the end of the set he got down and played the 20 or so distortion pedals as if he was a Dj. For christmas he wants a real set of decks I believe.

British India were ok, a little pretentious and definately sound better loud. Devoted Few were pretty good, the lead singer is hawt and the keyboardist acts seedy but she isnt. I went to see devoted few only because they are one of jai's fav band. 

We then walked to the orient and drunk a sugarless v on the way. It was fun to say the least. We were rudely shocked by the $5 cover charge at the Orient of all places. Downstairs was packed and upstairs was absolute trash. The DJ was playing shite music and the place was full of ugly, fat and old people. We sat and people watched but were getting sick of the lack of pick up potential so we left and went to the brooklyn for further amusement. We drunk and were further confronted by the lack of attractive people out that night. 

We resorted to playing hot or not and ended up noticing all the hot people were coupled. We left early with no pash gained or number added. 

If we didnt see a band that night would have been crap.

Sunday I went shopping with Mum so she could finish her christmas shopping. All i have left is my Nan and something else for Jai. I mused about my house until I left for dinner.

Nearly the whole gang from school was reunited for christmas dinner at Gourmet Pizza Kitchen (much to my disgust...I so hate that place but K did go to the effort of organising something so I commend her). Overall it wasnt bad despite jai and i resorting to talking to each other at tomes due to sheer habit. Matt and I had a great laugh and brad was the funny indie kid. Warwick and Jeff got on well and Daniel was evaluated the gay factor of pizzas. 

After dinner I drove Matt home and we gossiped along the way. It was nice to catch up before christmas and on my way home from Matts I pondered about life and came to the conclusion that next year im just going to go with the flow but study a little more and not be so evil.

Today I lazed about the house which is my usual monday behaviour. Tommorrow I might finish my christmas shopping and possibly pick up my pretty pink pearls.

"event","I went christmas shopping with Jeff which was fun really. I helped pick quite a few gifts and it felt as if we were friends not once did we resort to cuple behaviour. It almost felt as if there was no need - we were just friends shopping. 

I bought some new work shoes - Crocs in the mary jane style. They look really cute on. I also bought my sister a how to play drums book for an early christmas present. I bought a new EP for me aswell. 

I walked from the far end of newtown to broadway then caught a bus to the city to meet jeff. I then rushed from the city to broadway to catch a bus back to newtown so I could meet erin for lunch at 1. We had a great lunch and in general just caught up on things. We then went shoppping as she hadnt started her christmas shopping and I found a cool black vintage dress circa early 80s. Very cool trust me! I also bought a vintage scarf. 

All in all had a successful day - didnt spend much only $100 and I also paid a deposit on my pink pearls for christmas - $55. Only $90 to go. 

Cant wait til christmas...Stay cool chickens its freezing and its fooking winter, Arggghhh

I also bought myself a new black handbag and a skull scarf for christmas as mum gave me an extra 100 to spend. All in all she spent so much on me and much over her budget which i kinda feel guilty about but she did spend the same amount on my sister. I also bought my cousin Julie a bangle and my mum a necklace to go with her knives i bought her for christmas.&nbsp;<br /><br />Today I lounged around the house and watched season 3 of sex and the city. I thought i would stay at home and save money. I also got great news that I got a big day out ticket throught the final release. So excited - jai and i's traditional festival attendance can continue.&nbsp;<br /><br />Also planned lunch with erin at newtown at one. Christmas shopping with Jeff at 9 in the city. So tommorow Im busy as,&nbsp;<br /><br />As of recent i havent had much of an appetite. I dont know why - just dont feel like eating. Anyway Im sure i wont turn anorexic.&nbsp;<br /><br />I have butterflies in my tummy im so excited. Am going to go out on saturday night hopefully with everyone and possibly see nurse boy who is so cute and sweet. Not planning anything nor am i going to sleep with him on a whim I need to move slowly and think things through before I do. I dont want commitment for a while.<br /><br />In other words my sister is getting a drum kit for christmas and my cousin is getting a guitar, My little cousin might be getting a percussion set. Dad wants an electric guitar. Family band here we come.<br /><br />This christmas is looking fabulous already. I feel so lucky. <br /></p>"

"event","MY life consists of working and shopping and going out.&nbsp;

I work wed to sat to earn $480 which of recently has gone to christmas shopping and going out. Pathetic I know. But i feel happy - well kind of.&nbsp;

I have officially ended things with jeff for now. I said we migh consider things in january but somehow I dont think it will work again. He tried to get me to gp back out with him but i said no due to something he told me and how we have been arpund each other recently. The hardest thing is moving on after your first love and I want to have another just not right away.

I have finished all of my christmas shopping. I just have to get my grandma her christmas cake, my uncles havianas&nbsp;and my second cousins husband something and Im sone. All in all Ive spent close to $500 which is a little overboard but my family and friends mean the word to me. Im not to sure if I should buy Jeff something but time will tell.

Last friday I seen Mondo Rock with my mum and uncle - twas fun and as such my mum and i ended up slightly tipsy and dancing in the olds disco at souths juniors. We also had a small party for my sister that sunday. Jai came over and we wrapped up some christmas presents together and chatted about things.

The past week all ive done is work and shop a little.&nbsp;

Friday night Jai and I joined, Daniel and Matt at Matts house where we had a night of fun and games. It was like old times. The boys and Jai getting drunk, (I was driving) tickling Matt, watching the meaning of life, singing, talking about sex, matt swaying, and laughing at daniels japanese friend Yooyah recite pick up lines. It was stupid enjoable fun.

Saturday night I went out to dinner with Mum, Dad, Alice, Julie and Eddy to italian. Was really good. We then bought Lebanese sweets ie baklava and all things almond and went to my grandparents. Uncle Jas and Dad drove me into the city for Anna Steels birthday bash at pavillion. Jai and I had a few drinks, chatted to people and left. It was getting boring and the music was crap.&nbsp;

Jai and I was waking to our fav venue ie the orient and on the way we stopped at the rocks cafe and had ricotta cheesecake which wasnt as good as the one from work and it cost $9.35&nbsp;

We eventually made it to the orient and within 10 minutes jaime was dancing with some guy and within another 5 she was pashing him ie being skank rat. I was getting bored so i waleked around talent spotting and eventually jai parted from her new friend and we talked. I was introduced to his cute and rather hot friend Richard who was a nurse.&nbsp; So I had someone to dance with and have fun with. We left the orient after lots of dancing and fun and started walking to get a cab still with the guys. It was fun until I grazed my elbow on a wall and Richard went into nurse mode trying to save me from pain. He was cute and he told me several times how beautiful and pretty I was. He wasnt sleazy at all and he wasnt exactly trying to sleep with me.&nbsp;

I kissed him and got butterflies ad he would just sit and&nbsp;stare at me in a content yet non-creepy fashion. His friend Dylan got into an empty wheelie bin and was being stupid. It was like hanging with the boys but we could kiss them and not feel horrible. We were next to this park at one point and under the light was a couple having sex in the middle of the city. Richards crazy friend Dylan went over and tried to hassle them with no effect reached.&nbsp;

They hailed us a cab and I was home by 4. I only had 7 drinks and was feeling a little sick at one point but I had an enjoyable yet pleasant night with a hot nurse that wasnt skanky or the slightest bit sleazy. He was cute and he wants to see me again but iM not going to rush into things thats for sure but he was a great kiss.&nbsp;

Tommorow Im planning on cleaning up all my old newspapers as ive wrapped all my christmas presents. Tuesday I might see if Erin wants to meet me in newtown for lunch and I might buy my christmas present to myself - the pink pearls i wanted. I got an extra $100&nbsp; to spend for christmas from my parents and i bought a black handbag and a scarf to tie around it. I have $50 left and my pearls are $125.&nbsp;

Ime xcited about christmas. Jai and I are going to have a bike gang for christmas and cruise between each others houses so we can get the best of all houses.&nbsp;

Anyway Im off to cover my new diary for 2007.

Love ya&nbsp;

I went shopping and bought my sister a new CD and some turquoise Havs for her birthday. I also bought my Grandma, Grandpa, Mum and Erin a giftpack for christmas from Lush as well as a massage bar for me. IT smells pretty and hopefully will rid my body of dry skin. The only problem is that it coats your skin with a shiny layer of oil whch looks shiny and glistens but wouldnt work with satin PJs - u'd stick. Its slowly absorbing into my skin and it feels ultra smooth :P

I seen some pink pearls at a jeweller at eastgardens. They are as big as gobstoppers and were reduced from 170 to 140. I tried them on and they looked really pretty. I told Mum and she said I could get them for christmas which would be good. I dont really need anything else so why not add another a strand of pearls to the collection. 

I didnt spend much money - just enough. 

I seen Jai on her way to work and we had lunch together and chatted. Hopefully Jai will start working the same shifts as me at work ie fulltime and we can spend days actig like idiots at Christophers. LOL

Anyway not much more to say - working Wed to Sat. Friday nite im going to see Mondo Rock with my mum and my uncle which will be interesting to say the least."

We then went to Newtown and cruised around, checked out some shops, looking for a present for my sister to no avail. But I did end up finding the materials for Jai's present which are oh so pretty and bright. I cant tell you what it is cos she has my LJ password but I tod Sam and Caley what I was going to buy - well Im still doing that, Im just making it. LOL

I also bought the BErtie Blackman CD titled Black which is really good, very pretty. We walked to my uni cos I wante dto pick up my assignment but it wasnt ready so I will have to go back next week on my day off. 

Other than that we had lunch and yeh just had a cruisy day. 

Tommorow Im taking my dog for a haircut and I have to find my sister present but other than that another day of shopping.

"event","<p>Finished my last exam on thursday which was the biggest relief. I think I did alright considering I studied a little but not much. I relied on my natural intelligence.&nbsp;<br /><br />Wed, Thurs (after my exam), Fri, Sat I worked all day at work which was hectic as I was practically managing the front of the shop. However it results in a pay check of at least $500 so Im stoked. Because Im full time for 3 months while uni is off they are paying me my casual rate at $14 an hour and on sat $17.50 so im stoked as can be. After I finish buying christmas presents im going to save like crazy so I can go away in my july holidays overseas or somewhere pretty for a fortnight.&nbsp;<br /><br />Saturday Jai and I went crazy at work and put on a show for everyone pretty much cos we were hyped up about the evening. I left work at 4 so I could get to Sams concert which was alright considering Ive never been a ""dance"" person. Sam was wonderful and at times her costumes were hawt others were just blah but im sure she realises that :P If only I possessed flexibility.&nbsp;<br /><br />Jai, Sam, Caley and I went to dinner which was nice and we headed into the city. We went to star bar and pavillion, practically flitting between the two. Both were pretty shit. Pavillion the music was crap as was star bar. Music is how i generally evaluate places and since they weren't playing any of my songs it was shit. Except at star bar where the pool tables were, the music was good. I ended up going home at 1.30 due to curfew of 2 with Jeff. Jai left at 1 and we left Caley at pavillion at one point in time with Maddy and Tim. Sam at Star bar was drunk. Funny but my fault due to me encouragingf her to mix drinks when she probably cant handle it like Jai and I do.&nbsp;<br /><br />In other news, one of the guys that comes into the cake shop is a publisher of the magazine Cafe Society and I was joking around with one of my colleagues about writers being good if they can have a few drinks as its a trait of a fabulous writer. He then said I should write for cafe society next year when it starts up again in january and that there&nbsp;are a few cadets ie two but he might be looking for more. He gave me his business card and told me to contact him. SO it looks like I might have some work experience next year all because I began talking to some random at the cake shop. LOL<br /><br />This week Im working Wed to Sat 7.30 am to 6 pm which will&nbsp;be good for the bank balance. I think on tues i will do some more christmas shopping and then one night I might go to the movies and see Shortbus. Other than that Im just going to cruise along.<br /><br />Have a fab week.&nbsp;<br />Nat xo</p>"

"event","IVe been thinking recently of a topic that will most probably be supported or completely hated but its something Ive been pondering and deserves a post as such.&nbsp;

Ive been thinking how no one ever sees anyone anymore and I miss everyone alot but no one ever makes the effort to see anyone or contact anyone. The only person I hear from on a regular basis is Jai and we are just about as busy as each other but we always make time for each other. Its not as if we all live far far away or have extentuatingly busy schedules. We are supposed to have friendships but it seems so many of us neglect them. Im not just talking about my male friends either some of my best friends I havent heard from in months which hurts but I dont think its my duty to be forever organising things.&nbsp;

So take it as you see fit this entry but some things are reality and in some respects this is not an attack on people but an insight into my thoughts and maybe a call for some correspondence and proactive behaviour.

I miss my friends :("

"event","I have been busy in my own little way this week but not very busy.&nbsp;

Tuesday I went Christmas shopping with Jeff which was so much fun. I bought my parents, sisters and cousins present. I just have to buy my grandparents, jai, erin, my uncle and some others then Im done. So thats pretty cool.

Wednesday I cruised around home. Thursday I cruised about home some more then I went out to dinner with Jaime to Newtown for Thai. I was a little meh as I had some lower back pain but we chatted and entertained each other. We also had the best gelato from Gelatomassi on King St. I went home and the pain in my lower back was really bad so Friday I called in sick and didt go to work. I went to the doctor and I discovered I had a bladder infection so my kidneys were hurting.&nbsp;I have to go back on Monday for more results.&nbsp;

Friday afternoon I had my exam and considering I didnt do much study I think I went alright. I met up with Jeff afterwards and drove him home from Broadway.

Saturday I got up early to go to my sisters basketball game we then went shopping :P Mum bought me some gold thongs that have an ankle strap for an early christmas present and I bought some black pointy patent flats. I also got 6 new necklaces, a bracelet and some earrings for another early christmas present. Which means I will have less presents under the tree but more to wear now...

Saturday night I went out to dinner but my kidneys started to hurt again. Today I cruised around home and just had a relaxing day, reading, talking to my&nbsp;mum and eating :P I also went grocery shopping early in the morning - its apart of my chores when mum doesnt want to go.&nbsp;

Tommorow, Im going to vaccuum my grandparents house and do some studying. Other than an exam on Thursday and work on Wed, Fri and Sat Im pretty busy at the end of the week. Apparently Friday nite someones organising something. Saturday I think I have Sams dancing concert but I havent heard from her so I dont know. Anna was considering having something for her birthday on Saturday nite but Im not too sure. SO the end of the week is filled with maybes.&nbsp;

Ill just have to wait and see,&nbsp;
Till later,

"event","Well since the dreaded change your life talk given by my parents over the event I still giggle over due to the sheer nature of it I have been busy doing things that do not invove nightclubs, randoms, provocative dance moves etc but more wholistic activities. 

Last week I was supposed to be studying but that didnt happen because I was rishing to complete 13 film critiques. So much fun - not! Thursday night Jai and I seen Jackass 2, very guy humour but funny nonetheless. 

Friday I had work which was a blast. One of the guys that works with me, a charming British guy around the age of 29 keeps smiling at me, winking and being a little flirty which makes the idea of the work christmas party interestng but Im just going with the flow in the meantime. I might also be opening and closing the new cake store at Kogarah which hopefully means more noney and more hours for the next 3 months which will be good as I need something to keep me occupied. I was also offered a receptionist position for a physio - Mon to Wed, 2-6pm at Ramsgate but I was like meh I will stay with the cake shop. 

Saturday night I went out to dinner with my parents and my Aunty Julie and her husband Eddy to Macedonian at Newtown. It was good but carnivourous in nature. I had 2 glasses of chardonnay and was quietly content. I wore my tutu inspired black dress and my purple peep toes with a purple cardi - I felt prettiful. 

Sunday Jai and I went to the Newtown festival and I bought 3 items of new clothing for $5 each - a black shrug, a blue sleaveless tunic top with black birds and a paisley green singlet. Oh so pretty! I also bought 2 rings - one made out of pate knife and the other made out of a teaspoon - very funky and shiny. We ventured to the beach afterwards but it was a little overcast so we just sat on the beach. That night I had dinner at my grandparents house. 

Monday I had my first exam for the semester - Aboriginal People. I walked in with no study done just a brief glance at my notes and I managed to develop neat and tidy responses that are worthy of a credit at the least. Well Im hoping. Jeff took me to lunch after my exam and it was good but i got splashed big time when we standing at the kerb due to the weird weather. One minute it was warm the next raining and overcast. 

I dont know if I mentioned this but I got a distinction for both my politics and aboriginal people essay which makes me go woohoo!!! On Sunday night Jeff told me Im pretty intelligent and I was like no you are just saying that. He replied No Im serious. Sure what ever you say. I think I just have the ability to string words together not so much intelligence per se.

Tuesday Im going shopping with Jeff for Christmas presents for my family. Am excited because I love christmas - its something my mother has forever ingrained in my head. Am also contemplating my own christmas presents to myself, Im thinking clothes and shoes :D

Thursday night Jai and I are going out for dinner maybe, other than that its going to be a quiet week. Maybe on saturday I will see a movie with JEff. I really want to see Shortbus and Suburban Mayhem. 

Next exam is on Friday and its history. Have decided that once I get back home I will study for history on wed and thurs aswell as tues afternoon so I can gain knowledge which leads to sheer confidence.

Watch those white elephants, Ciao - Nat xo"

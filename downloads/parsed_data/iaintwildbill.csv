Everyone sat around the table, eating dinner and discussing the day's events. All except Lou. And by proxy, Jimmy, because all he'd done was worry about why she hadn't come back from her ride.

""Jimmy, like I said, I heard there was some storms rollin' down from Sioux country. She prob'ly just decided to wait 'em out. You know they get rough this time a'year,"" Teaspoon attempted to reassure him, but he knew better. He knew damn well Lou would ride through hell and high water, so long as her horse wasn't in danger. 

""I'm just sayin'...""

""Why you so concerned anyways, Jimmy? Ain't like she ain't ever been late before,"" 

The table went quiet for a second. Kid had been pretty quiet the whole meal and everybody knew why. And Jimmy actually held quite a bit of sympathy for him, right up until that moment. The tone in Kid's voice was more than enough to have Jimmy's shoving up off the table and towering above him.

""'Cause, Kid. She's my friend. I remember when she could say the same about you,""

With that, he turned and snatched his hat off the wall, slamming the door behind him in the process. It didn't take him long to grab a horse out of the barn and lead it out into the cool night air. 

""Where do you think you're goin', son?"" Teaspoon stood on the porch to the main house, smoking his cigar and eyeing Jimmy. The old man's gaze was enough to make Jimmy pause long enough to give him an answer.

""Teaspoon, somethin' 'bout this ain't right. And I'll be damned if I'm gonna sit around here while he   doesn't seem ta give one damn about her,""

""You doin' this for her, son? Or for you?"" 

""For both of us,"" And before Teaspoon could say another word, he was gone."

"event","Alright. So I've kinda been gone a while and in the process, a few people got screwed over in RP and such. I can't even begin to tell you how terrible I feel about it. I've been defriended by a few people, which is something I completely understand and accept. I'd just like the opportunity to offer an explanation.

Not very many people (except maybe Emma's mun) know this, but I was in a pretty rough relationship a few months ago. We'd been together for a long time, but things got... let's just go with bad, and I had to move. I moved out of state with no money and no job. Needless to say, things were not great. I had no internet and no way to get online to tell anyone what was going on. Plus, I felt at the time like I didn't need to explain all the personal private stuff, because really... it was personal and private. BUT, I also didn't think I would be gone nearly as long as I was, either. 

There are other reasons I wasn't on that are more medical, but I won't get into that, because frankly, I'm not ready to talk about it. I'm going to be crossposting this to all of my journals, because unfortunately there are numerous people who've played in depth with a lot of my muses and this affected a few of them a great deal.

I sincerely apologize to anyone who got hurt or upset about my disappearing. Same goes for their muses. If this could have been avoided, it would have been. And believe me, I know how it feels to have someone up and stop playing with you without explanation one. *eyes and pets Cassandra* Please know it was never my intention to screw anyone over or hurt anyone's feelings. I tried to downplay this as much as possible, but once I realized just how many people had dumped me from their friends' lists, I was kinda taken aback. I understand it, it was just... surprising is all.

Again, I'm sorry. I'm not mad or upset with anyone, swear to God. I just felt like I owed a lot of people an explanation."

Lotsa uncles and aunts and cousins, not ta mention my brothers and sisters. But I was always alone. A lotta times it was just the choice I made, goin' off while everyone else played. I spent a lotta time out in the loft of the barn or out in the woods by the house, just tryin' ta be alone.

I think that's why I went with the Judge in the first place. I decided alone wasn't so great, ya know? But in the end, I woulda been better off that way. I'da never become so good with the one reason I'll probably be alone for the rest of my life. 

These guns are the reason I'm alone now. I ain't alone in the sense that there ain't abody around. There's quite a few of 'em, actually. Cody's snorin', Buck and Ike are signin' somethin' to each other, Lou's pretendin' ta sleep even if I know she has a hard time whenever Kid's on a run. They're here, but it don't make me one of 'em. They're my family, but I'm still alone. Always gonna be, I think. Maybe it was just meant ta be that way."

Things've been brewin' with the Kid and I for a long time. Probably from the beginnin'. He and I? We're just different kind of people is all. And no matter what kind of looks The Kid gives me, I'd lay my life on the line for him and I know he'd do the same for me. We're brothers in a way. In a I don't think you deserve your woman kinda way. In a you think you're always right but I think you're a plain fool kinda way. In a way that no one's ever gonna change. Not her, not Teaspoon, not no war, and not that glare he's throwin' at me right now. He thinks I ain't payin' attention, but he should know better. I've gotten pretty damn good at bein' aware of my surroundings and believe you me, the reasons I've had to is usually why he's so angry with me ta begin with. He'll say somethin' and try and be all smart with me and I'll say somethin' back and one of us will end up in the sweatlodge before its all said and done. He's suckerpunched me, called me just about everything in the book and damn near shot me on a couple of occasions. None of it bothers me as much as that look of hatred he's got now. 

This ain't about Lou. This is about war and fightin' for what ya believe in. He's for slavery and I'm against. Nothin's ever gonna change that. He and I? We're just different kind of people is all."

That's the way it is with a lot of folks. People talk a lot, but there ain't really nothin' there to back it up. There are a few people though, that I have trusted no matter what. And only one of 'em that I grew up with. Wish I woulda known sooner what a snake he was. Before I left the Judge's, there wasn't a man alive other than Brad that I would have trusted at my back. He was my best friend. 

The Judge... it's his fault, really. He put Brad and I at odds from day one. Always tryin' ta see who could outshoot the other, who was quicker on the draw. I guess I shoulda seen it comin'. We both wanted the Judge's approval, but Brad didn't just want it. He needed it. 

Clare died on account of him. Him and the Judge. And Brad died on account of the lie he told me. If he hadn't told me Clare had been kidnapped, instead of just run off, then she never would have died.

Of someone else's game..."" -- Wicked</i>

There's always somebody who wants to tell ya what to do and how ta be doin' it. Now, normally, despite all that, you still get ta live your life however you see fit. Ya get ta earn your own way and start a family. Or just roam around in the wild 'til the day you die. 

I ain't that somebody. I've always had people tellin' me what ta do, but more than that, I've had people lyin' and manipulating me to get what they want. Seems strange, 'cause everybody that knows me would tell ya I ain't exactly a pushover. But it always seems like I'm livin' my life by other body's rules. 

The Judge, Sarah Downs, Teaspoon (even though I know he means well, and he's probably right in what he's tryin to teach me), J.D. Marcus...

Marcus. The man that changed my life forever and will be the death of me, I know. Before him, I was just a rider for the Pony Express. Alright, maybe I was a little hotheaded and capable of findin' my own trouble, but hell, ain't that my right? But now, he's made sure that trouble will find me no matter where I go or what I choose to be doin'. And now, there are a lot of choices I can't make anymore. 

He took away the rest of my life and gave me this new one. He killed James Butler Hickok and left in his place a man named Wild Bill. He didn't kill him with a gun or a knife. There was no shootout or fight. He cut the man out with a pen and filled his veins with ink. He wrote Wild Bill into existence and now the damnable man won't leave me be. The people I love with never be safe. My family... my home. I'm gonna have to leave them all behind someday, because of Marcus' game. 

Well I don't like his game. But I know I have to play by the rules of it now, or I'll end up dead. Don't seem rightly fair. Not fair at all."

That's why, when he woke up from the last one, drenched in sweat and clawing at his blanket he'd almost yelled at the pair of soft brown eyes that met his. It wasn't her fault. He's obviously woke up her up with all his tossing and turning. But it didn't help that she was standin' right there next to him, when just a second ago she'd been hanging from a noose. The thought alone was enough to stir him into speaking.

<i>His fault. It had been his fault. Kid, Cody, Buck, even Emma had all told him. Your fault, Jimmy! She's hanging 'cause of you. And somehow, he knew they were all right. And she just stood there, lookin' at her with those big eyes of her that he was sure he could lose himself in.</i> 

He ran a hand through his hair and hopped down off his bunk, heading outside for some air. Last thing he needed was to be there with her staring at him the way she was right now. Just like she had been in the dream. Because someday, it might not be a dream anymore. And that was something he didn't think he could ever face. 

Just like her.

Longley. That's probably the most disappointin' thing ta ever happen to me. I always think there had ta have been a way ta avoid that whole mess, but the man had it comin'. Ta come chargin' into Tompkins' store and demand an apology for spookin' his horse, without even knowin' I'd done it? And then tryin' ta talk about my mother... If he'd have just let well enough alone at that, after Kid got in the way and stopped a killin', he coulda gone his way and I coulda gone mine. But he had ta go and hurt Emma by takin' her daddy's watch as a bribe to leave me be, knowin' full well he wouldn't ever do such a thing. It was too much. 

It disappointed me that she asked me ta apologize to him. It disappointed me more that I cared so much about her to agree to it. She asked me ta go say I was sorry, 'cause a man like Longley doesn't abide an insult. But I knew better. I knew he'd never just accept an apology, but she asked me to and I had ta try. And as I stood there, swallowin' my pride and hearin' him ask me to shine his shoes, I had a little hope. I hoped that maybe he just wanted ta embarass me and be done with it. I hoped I could get Emma's watch back and forget this whole mess.

I shoulda never hoped. When I shot him, I had that moment that I think everyone must get the first time they haveta kill a man. And in that moment, I had a feelin' that my life would never be the same. I was always gonna be a killer, livin' by my wits and a pearl handled Colt.

Willow Springs. Dancing in the middle of the street with the smartest, strongest, most perfect girl I know. Now, I know, I know. Ain't nobody perfect. But her flaws make her even more perfect, if that makes sense. She's stubborn, naive, and completely blind to how loved she is. Not just by me, but everyone around her. And I never loved nobody more than I loved her right there in the dead of night, dancin' to a song I didn't even know. Hearin' her laugh and seein' her actually havin fun for the first time in so long... it made her seem like an angel.

Then there's the kiss. I don't know whether that was a good or bad thing in the long run, but it was definitely the best night of my life. No matter how bad I felt after, it was by far the sweetest, most pure thing I've ever felt. I wouldn't trade it for anything. 

Of course, there are the bad things. Kissin' Emma at Ft. Reunion, convinced I was in love with her. I looked like a plain fool, and I don't know how she ever forgave me for it. Or when I tried to 'save' Sarah Downs from bein' beaten by her husband, only ta find out she was settin' me up ta frame me for his killin'. The nightmares of all the things my daddy did to my mama.

"event","I couldn't believe it. I ain't exactly known as the luckiest man in the world, and yet here I was sittin' in the saloon with twenty dollars in my hand. How I came by that twenty dollars, well.. that's a story for some other time. 

<lj-cut text=""So there I was..."">

So there I was, sittin' in the saloon' right, and I figured, since I got this money, I'd best put it to good use. There was a perfectly good poker game goin' on and I figured ta get myself in on it. Ever since I saw Sam lose that hand at my expense, I was determined ta get that money back for him. Now, I hadn't seen Sam in a long time, ever since he and Emma got married, but I'd heard they were expectin' a baby girl and I figured maybe they could use the extra money, no matter how small the amount. And considerin' the luck I'd had comin' across that twenty dollars, I didn't see any reason not to try and get it right then. 'Course, I'd had a few drinks in me to, an' that helped. 

Ya see, poker is an art and a science, and it takes a certain kind of skill. One learned over time and careful study. I've always had a mind for it, if I do say so myself. I've always been quite good at bein' able to spot a liar, and that's all poker really is. Knowin' when people are lyin' and when they aren't. Well, that and bein' a decent liar yourself. 

I suppose I just happened ta be a better liar than the gentlemen that were at the table that night. I walked away with a little more than double what I'd left with and wandered into the night air happy as a calm and drunk as a skunk. I walked past the girls standing on the porch of the saloon, and even though what they tried to offer was temptin', I paid 'em no mind. I walked (even though it was probably most of a stumble if I was bein' honest) down the way, past the general store and blacksmith. I let my mind wander, trying to think of something... ANYTHING, that would make this night even better than it already had been. As I passed a dress shop, something flashed in the fire light from the street and I paused in mid step. There in the window, sat a ring. Not just any ring, though. This one was special. This was HER ring. 

She was the only thing that could have made this night better. She made everything better when she was around. She understood me like no one else did, and she deserved the best. And this ring... this was HER ring. When she was ready, I'd give it to her and leave everything else behind. I'd change my name, even cut my hair... anything to keep her safe. 

I made his way to the store the next day, using all the winnings plus a week's pay much to the shopkeeper's surprise. She'd never expected a man like me to afford such an extrvagant gift. It was silver, with a tiny little diamond on it. Simple, yet beautiful. Much like her. And she'll have it on her perfect finger.

"event","I don't tend to wait around for much. Some might call it bein' impatient, but it ain't that. It's just that a lotta times, the things you think are worth waitin' for don't come around 'til you stopped waitin'. Emma said it's like watchin' a pot boil. The longer your stand there and wait for it to happen, the longer it takes. And when you finally give up and start ta doin' somethin' else, it'll boil. 

Plus, my daddy always said that men who matter don't wait for somethin' to happen. They're the one that makes things happen. Maybe that's what came over me that night with Lou, or the day that Longley came into Tompkins' store. Hell, maybe that's why I tried to save Sarah and looked like a plain fool. I didn't wanna wait. I wanted to make things happen. 

I wanted to matter.

But if I HAVE ta pick somethin' I'm waitin' for, I'll go with death. It happens to the best of us. I imagine it'll come at the end of a gun, but you never know. I could just go peacefully in my sleep. 

Yeah, I don't buy that, either."

"event","Have you ever cheered for the wrong team, chosen the wrong side, picked the wrong horse or backed the wrong person in a fight? If so, what would you do differently, if you could do it over?


Well, Teasppon'd say I've picked the wrong side plenty o' times. Sidin' with my temper instead of thinkin' about things. See, this temper of mine's gonna be the death of me...

I've been in trouble since I was a bitty kid and ain't nobody tried ta stop me 'til I joined up with this bunch. Hell, people been encouragin' me to do things a body shouldn't do since I was livin' with my Ma and Pa. Daddy used to have me helpin' him with escaped slaves... you know, helpin' 'em get to Canada. My Ma was always beggin' him to keep me out of it, but I really wanted ta help, and he needed it bad. Weren't many people of the time thinkin' like he did about how everbody deserved to be free. Helpin' him got me a whole lotta life experience. Got me shot at for the first time, too.  

But after they both died and my brothers and sisters all went off to other kin, I met a man who promised ta help me become the man I'd always wanted to be. He was a judge and had what I thought had to have been the biggest house in all of Missouri. He was citified folk, and had all the things in life anybody could ever want. He took me in and taught me about a lot of things, and not a one of 'em good. I wouldn't have these here Navy Colts if it weren't for him. He wanted me to work for him, doin' things that I just didn't think I could do. So I left, and made my way out West.
 
Which is how I ended up here, in Rock Creek. With the only buncha people in this world that give a damn about me anymore. We bicker and fight a lotta times, but it's only cause we give a care about one another. And they've all tried to help me fight this temper I got. Teaspoon says this temper is my destiny. And destiny is somethin' that a man cain't avoid, at least not in this life. And I have a feelin' he ain't at all wrong about it."

"event","<i>If this world is wearing thin
And you're thinking of escape
I'll go anywhere with you
Just wrap me up in chains
But if you try to go alone
Don't think I'll understand</i>

It was like she could see everything about me. Those big brown eyes starin' up at me like I had all the answers. She was everything I've ever wanted outta life. She wasn't like some other women ya meet, ya know? A lot of 'em, they just wanted ta be wives and raise babies and the like. Ain't nothin' wrong with that. Hell, that's all my mama ever wanted, and she was a good woman. But Louise... I didn't think she'd ever be like that. She was too strong and brave to ever be a quiet woman who sat in the house takin' care of babies. She'd rode with us through thick and thin, and worked harder than any of us. All to save her brother and sister from bein' orphans. There ain't a woman in this world I admired more than her. 

And she was standin' there, looking up at me as if I could fix everything. Damnit, I loved her. Loved her more than I'd ever loved anybody, including myself. She deserved so much better than what she had with Kid. He didn't understand that she couldn't be tamed. She couldn't just give up who she was because that's what he wanted. The whole sorry fact of it was, though, that I couldn't give her better, either. A man like me ain't no good for a woman, and especially not one as special as her. I'd only get her hurt, or worse. But lookin' at me like that, she made me forget all of it. That people would always be huntin' me down. Made me forget that I was 'Wild Bill'. So I did the only think I could do. The only thing Jimmy; HER Jimmy; could do. I kissed the hell out of her. I gave her everything I'd never said to her in that kiss. 

I know there were times that she wanted to leave us. Leave the Express and never come back. It was so damn hard for her, bein' there while her brother and sister sat in an orphanage. But in that one kiss, I let her know that she had me no matter what, if she wanted. I knew she loved Kid, and that in the end, she'd go back to him. But I wanted her to know that she wouldn't be alone if she didn't."

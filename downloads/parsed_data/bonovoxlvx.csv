"event","Iowa was an amazing experience.  Were it not for being so behind with other concerns, as well as the apparent overflow of volunteers, I would have made it to New Hampshire as well.  Perhaps I will detail the trip at some point, but I'll just be brief here.  I was pleasantly surprised to have the opportunity to see Governor Dean at a rally.  It was quite fun to go door to door sharing a message of truth & hope with the citizens of Iowa.  There is something special about knowing that you are fighting or working for something good & true, without reward beyond that.  It was inspiring to see all the stormers around Iowa in their orange caps, Americans traveling on their own dime to try and take their country back, an oasis in this desert of cynicism.  I was also able to observe a caucus, which was quite the fascinating experience.  Alas, things did not go well.

I was in a reception with other Dean supporters, all quite down, after the surprising 3rd place draw.  We all hoped that Gov. Dean would not try to put a lame spin on things, as so many others do.  The speech he gave, the chanting of states we will go to & the rally cry had everyone up & cheering, spirits restored.  I have never witnessed such a shame, such an absolute crime as the warping & twisting of that moment by the media, to try & destroy his campaign.  It shows clearer than anything how strong the forces against change are.  Republicans have tried to paint Dr. Dean as the ideal opponent, only because they fear him most.  It is pure ignorance to buy into the notion that the Republicans would show their hand, or that they would rather face someone who has backed all of President Bush's programs & policies (all the other major candidates) rather than one who offers a clear choice.  Howard Dean is bringing new enthusiastic voters to the table.  He would defeat Bush & his lies, and change the agenda of the Democratic party, which as of now is very hard to distinguish from the Republican party in deed, if not rhetoric.  

Governor Dean received generally good press, save from Fox, until an interview with Chris Matthews.  During that interview when pressed, he stated that he would break up the large media companies & not reverse any laws that allowed them to own stations across the country to control the flow of information.  This is a topic that the other candidates would not dare.  This is a true example of standing up to special interests.  This was the last time he received any good press.  Even CNN & MSNBC, have slammed him since, being large media conglomerates with aspirations of growth themselves.  CNN has contributed $200,000 to the Kerry campaign.  The messages have been passed from on high.  Notice how even the 'right' leaning commentators on CNN or MSNBC will not say a bad word about Kerry now, grudgingly admitting that they will support Bush, but that Kerry is the toughest opponent.  Bull, Kerry is Dole revisited.  An old hack who is dragged out to be bludgeoned by the incumbents juggernaut, since he inspires no one & offers nothing new.  

On caucus night the returns were listed as: 'Sen. Kerry, Sen. Edwards, Howard Dean, Rep. Gephardt, Rep. Kucinich.'  They would not give him his title.  Then when issues were tracked, for example those who said the economy was the most important issue, a pie chart was pulled out which read: 'Kerry 35%, Edwards 28%, Gephardt 6%, OTHER! 31%/'  This subconsciously effects the viewer.  They are led to believe that Governor Dean has no title, and that he has no greater standing than Kucinich, Sharpton & the like being grouped with 'OTHER!'  

I know a handful of people, and have heard others on the radio whom are fully aware of the corruption in the Bush Administration, it's collusion with the media & the apathy of the Democratic leadership.  Despite this, they have rolled over & chosen to go out as practically slaves, allowing cynicism & self-interest to blind them to the fact that we have at last a candidate, a libertarian who has broken through the party lines & could offer real change, isn't stuck at 1% like Kucinich unfortunately is, could actually win this thing, if we all did our best.  The alternative is to sit at home in the comfort zone & like an intellectual snob point out all that is wrong, but like a dutiful servant sit idly by & never try to stop it.  Or just drag out the sorry excuse that the powers that be are too vast & strong to fight, so why bother.  That is a poor perception, like Rome this too will fall, but only when men's courage overcomes their greed & laziness.  If one is even slightly appalled at the last 3 years of the Bush Administration & the Democrats who sat did not have the courage to stand up against it, what shall the next four bring, when there is no re-election to plan for?  What liberties will remain?  I for one shall not let this last glimmer of hope go without a fight.

On a lighter note, as synchronicity would have it, I met an author & former Clinton Administration member, who was out stumping for Dean as well.  He looked over me flyer I had slapped together promoting the organization & said I should develop it into a book, as my particular insight into the conservative mind & lifestyle is worth telling.  Now that I have returned, I shall endeavor to post the website asap.  Now if only I could go without sleep entirely!  Onward to New Mexico & Arizona!"

"event","I have been reflecting on my time with Natasha here in the states, during what little moments of free time I have.  I am very happy that she met Lyvia, and we spent some time with my best friend Amy & her boyfriend.  I have moved back to where I grew up for a few reasons, namely I wanted a pool & my money to go further.  However, I also felt drawn, as issues from my past confronted me, particularly with my dad.  Also, it is sort of an exercise in humility for me to say Riverside, rather than Irvine.  I still cringe & want to lie about it, which clearly indicates that a good amount of the superficial is yet to be cleansed.  I must admit that I had a romantic notion of seeing old friends, or things being somewhat as they were when I was younger.  Silly nostalgia.  Natasha & I spent more time in Orange County than here, for I felt it to be more comfortable & certainly more warm & inviting.  Hmmm...I can't imagine much worse I could say than that Orange County was a warmer & inviting environment than fill in the blank.  I recall now that I had felt this is where people go (or stay) to die.  Time has stopped, progress halted, cynicism has stepped in & with a good mix of apathy created a new world just over the hills from Irvine.  Occasionally talks or visual stimuli would trigger a story, while Natasha was here, which would sometimes prompt a 'do you see so and so often?'  The most oft used response was 'No, they ran off with their girlfriend, or are holed up with them, not allowed to come out,' and how I cannot imagine being so subservient in a relationship, nor why someone would want such a partner anyway.  Then again, I did run off to Orange County in the first place with a girlfriend, so maybe it's just a full cycle.  At least I still came & went by my own choice and NEVER EVER have I had a girlfriend who called incessantly to check up on me, or that I had to practically beg to go out & do what I wanted.  Ugh, I can hear the chants of 'sacrifice' and 'compromise.'  Absurd.  A true partnership does not require that one partner has to give up any of themself to please the other.  If such is present than one level of dependence or another is all that is going on.  

Funny, I must have listened to too many Howard Dean speeches lately!  I was not intending to go on a rant, but it seems everything comes out passionately these days. I am not apologetic about it however.  Far better to be passionate about everything, than about nothing, under the sorry guise of maturity & responsibility.

Anyhow, after hearing the polling data last night, I booked my flight to Iowa!  This campaign as life needs to be about doing, rather than saying.  I will arrive in Des Moines on Sunday morning the 18th.  From there I will immediately drive to Cedar Rapids to campaign for Dean.  My Dad was born & raised in Cedar Rapids, Iowa.  3 years ago he died on January 18.  I don't know what it means, other than coincidence, but I have been making a concerted effort to face the ugliness of emotion that I have held in since childhood toward him.  This could be a cathartic experience.  It should be a beginning on a couple of fronts.  How ironic, that I will be campaigning in his hometown for a Democrat.  I cannot imagine anything that would please him more.

"event","Michael Moore is endorsing Wesley Clark, claiming he is the ""...best hope we have of defeating George W. Bush.""  This is such an old, overused & just plain wrong notion.  I am extremely disappointed in folks who throw their support behind someone who they feel has the best chance to win, rather than someone with clear & different ideas.  Wesley Clark is now, and always has been the Democrats Arnold Schwarzenegger.  He joined the race with such fanfare, painted as a Democrat who could stand against the President on foreign policy, a shining star in a weak field, expecting to be granted the nomination without having to take a stand on any issues.  To this day he is a smiling puppet head, being secretly backed by the Clinton's & their Hollywood friends.  Beating George Bush is the most important crossroads this country has faced in it's young existence.  However, to replace him with someone who is not even certain of his own identity (he has spent his career as a near Republican & even praised the President, until his own notions of power began to grow) and is clearly the choice of the establishment will avail us nothing.  We need strong change, and that will not be found by swapping the Republican establishment darling for the Democratic establishment darling.  Has no one figured out that their is little fundamental change in our nations direction when we elect such insiders or their puppets.  Only when an outsider captures the imagination of the young, the unmotivated, those who had given up hope in the system, do we see any actual change in our direction.  Howard Dean is our only chance for real change.  I absolutely reject the idea that he cannot win.  Considering his 2% early polling numbers, the army of fervent supporters behind him which is predominately made up of those who have not voted previously, the youth, and former republicans who are fed up, along with the most important fact which is that Howard Dean is the only candidate to have consistently taken strong positions of opposition to George Bush, regardless of what the polls said.  With Saddam Hussein captured, a strengthening economy, a fake medicare prescription bill being passed & plans for Iraq to be handed it's power back 3 months before the election, how in hell can anyone in their right mind say that any of the candidates who have supported Bush & his war & his programs will stand a chance against him?  Why would the country make a change so slight, when it is feeling generally positive?  Only a clear and obviously different choice has a chance of winning. Only a candidate with the passion & will to stand in a debating forum, pound the podium & speak the truth has a chance to win.  Howard Dean is the only candidate who can possibly defeat George W. Bush in this election cycle.  Howard Dean is the only candidate whose election can make a real difference in America.

As for Michael Moore, perhaps he really believes that winning at all is better than winning with substance.  Perhaps it is too much to expect that although he is clearly well thought in many aspects of politics, that he will consistently be on the right side of things.  It is unfortunate that he would back the 'pretty' or 'safe' candidate.  I would have some modicum of respect if he backed ANY of the others who have taken some sort of political stand, albeit most often with the President or the polls.  All support for Wesley Clark is based on the same foundation as Arnold Schwarzenegger's, a party line based win at all costs, win without substance game.  Our new governor is rehashing Grey Davis' programs & ideas, but hey, he's a Republican so the ideas are suddenly good?  If Wesley Clark were President, I believe he would continue with George Bush's policies, once all the smiling & promising is over, just as our Governor has with his predecessor.

So much for plans like keeping up my journal, writing some of my essay, pamphlet & ultimately book, designing the websites & even paying the bills.  Typically I neglected such things, while Natasha was here, as her presence is too consuming & near literally takes me into another world where the present is truly all that matters.  Now I am well behind, and must see if flights to Iowa this weekend will still be reasonable for the caucus.  I will be inundated with work tomorrow, but for now I enjoy some wine & allow myself to arrive back at home...our home, which I am alone in for now.

I was very surprised to see someone I recognized coming out of the immigration area of LAX, apparently on the same flight as she was...Morrissey.  I felt old to see his grey hairs, larger frame, and plodding along while pushing his own luggage, as opposed to the beaming energy of entourage.  Still, I felt compelled to shake his hand & say hello.  Someone who was an old friend back in the days we used to figure out his flight times & meet him at the airport for a few moments was there to pick him up.  Apparently they have developed a relationship.  It was strange however.  When I was younger this would have been a dream: the chance encounter with Morrissey & a few moments to talk, without anyone else there.  However, I felt silly as soon as it begun, and was far more worried about missing Natasha's emergence, so nearly as soon as it started, I buggered out, then felt childish for even saying hello in the first place.  Why would I be impulsed to do so?  

I just saw Return of the King, and as has been reported by most everyone who has seen it, it is wonderful.  Now I am planning to see Big Fish tomorrow or Sunday.  

Natasha & I were at Stater Bros, to pick up a few things to eat, and some wood for the fire.  A woman who I recognized (but forgot her name & didn't get it again) came up having recognized me.  I had met her on the plane ride over to England to see Natasha the first time!  What a remarkable coincidence.  She does not even live here, but was visiting her sister.  It would be strange enough in the first place, but to have Natasha with me at the time is even more fascinating.

Hmmm...If I wanted to get carried away, I could endeavor to figure out what all these chance encounters 'mean.'"

As each day passes, it seems more clear that his candidacy is our only chance to save the country.  I read a democratic website, where some Clark supporters were complaining that Dean is actually a Libertarian.  Exactly!  We do not need a typical Democrat any more than a typical Republican.  They are one in the same, with mildy different appearances.  Was Clinton not quite right-winged in is policies?  Has Bush not increased our Government's size, added new programs, run in deficit?  We need an outsider, a libertarian, a populist.  It's the only hope for real change.  

Also, my father was from Iowa, and we lived there for a year in 1979.  I have vague memories, but if I can locate the old address...well suffice to say it could be a very cathartic experience for me in that sense as well."

"event","Lyvia has been what I would call 'more than happy' lately around me.  She has always been very comfortable with things someone her age should not be, and can think & reason through issues quite remarkably.  Still it seemed that she was unnaturally happy about meeting Natasha, yet I could not get her to convey anything other than how excited she was.  I picked up on how out of her way she went to make me happy this last couple weeks, but could not finger what the driving force behind it was.  Actually, I figured it was as simple as new surroundings, having just moved into this new place & her staying the night here.  Her mother let me know that Lyvia expresses fear that my love for Natasha is replacing my love for her, and that she is going out of her way to make me happy, for fear of seeming dull & played out, when compared to Natasha's light.  So many things that she said or did make more sense when seen through those eyes.  When I think of how effected I was by my parents after all, I fear any slight impact negatively on my daughter's life from my misguided actions.  I can't believe that I would be so blind to this, or that my baby is going through such a conflict, because of me."

In the background 'The Simple Life' was playing.  I overheard a couple things which caught my attention to the point that soon I was on the couch.  Suffice to say, I haven't missed an episode since.  The episode where they work at 'Sonic Burgers' is classic, one of the funniest things I have ever seen on television.

Yesterday evening as I fed the fish, I realized the area would support a frog or two, and looking into getting one & it's care was on my to-do list for today.  A little after the rains started, I heard a strange sound from outside, quite different than the myriad of bird noises I am growing accustomed to.  I went outside & listened a bit.  Very clearly & distinctly I could hear 3 different frogs croaking from around the pond.  Admittedly, the 'bud-wies-er' commercial ran briefly through my mind.  I am very excited to have these creatures living here as well."

With moving & business & such, the time has past rapidly, since Manchester.  Natasha will be here in just over a week.  As it is her first time to visit me in the states, and I think of the things to do & people to see, this becomes an opportunity for reflection.  If I took a friend to Germany, Spain & most considerably England, I would have at least a half dozen up to fifteen people that I would like for them to meet, whom I consider very close friends, the kind which I can be open & frank with.  Look you in the eye, listening, caring & sharing type friends.  All of these I have met in the last year.  Now, with Natasha coming to visit, I consider how this applies to the US, where I have lived my whole life.  In fact, now I live in the city where I grew up & lived up through my early 20's.  Who are those I can count as real friends, which I be excited for her to meet?

"event","If Al Gore spoke with the passion I heard tonight when he endorsed Howard Dean, during the last presidential election, he would have won without controversy.  His speech about the patriot act, it's infringements upon civil liberties and the utter necessity of it's repeal, if we are to remain in any mild sense a constitutional republic, is overwhelmingly the most moving & important speech of this campaign season.  Alas, it is unfortunate that he is not running again, with this conviction.  Howard Dean has said that he will repeal the most offensive aspects of the act, which is a start.  I would rather he would commit to repealing the whole thing.

In regards to Al Gore, I have heard all sorts of ideas today pertaining to his endorsement.  They have ranged from positioning himself for the 2008 election (experts still think Dean can't win, does anyone else recall that argument being made against Clinton V Bush I?) to him positioning himself versus the Clinton family for control of the Democratic party.  Perhaps I am naive, but recalling his disappearance, after the election & then showing up bearded, looking as if he had gone off to find enlightenment & now only appearing at select functions to deliver powerful speeches, often for free...I would like to believe that a person can change, dramatically & fundamentally.  I would like to believe that a person could see wrong, and be inspired to fight against it.  I personally, proudly & fervently supported President Bush II in his election campaign versus Al Gore.  I still believe that if he had followed the advice Powell, instead of Cheney, we may not be having this debate.  Nonetheless, upon reflection, personal growth & observation of the world in a less selfish, more open way, I have experienced great personal change.  Like I said, perhaps it's naive, but I would like to believe that Al Gore has gone through a change & is casting his support, his hope with Howard Dean that he may lead us on a different path.  In the end, I would rather be naive & hope, than cynical & accepting of our sad fate.

On another note, it is unfortunate, even tragic that the media is so dominated by our political & corporate masters.  This is evident in how Dennis Kucinich is portrayed as a fringe, almost silly candidate.  The best case is that he can stay through the whole primary season, planting seeds of ideals based on truth & real change, within the hearts & minds of those tuning in to watch the debates & such.  Perhaps these seeds will bear some real fruit in the future.

As it stands, I suppose I should be happy that an outsider, my second choice is far & away the front runner."

"event","It always amazes me how much crap I have been dragging from place to place.  As I went through things this evening, I came across various items pushed various emotional buttons.  I am certain that over the next couple weeks of packing & unpacking I will have various such incidents, which I welcome.  Actually I expect it shall be exacerbated by the holidays & by moving back to where some memories lie.  Although I anticipate it being a hard time in that regard, it is clearly time to deal with some long buried feelings, based on what I learned of myself in Manchester.

What hit me strongest tonight was the letters, pictures & cards from Janet (biological mother), many of which I did not recall I had.  Her notes imploring me to travel to England to meet her, when she was going to vacation there were poignant, as I travel there often now.  The travel concept had escaped me, seeming too far a bridge to cross, until I did.  Now I cannot travel enough & not only does nothing in that vein intimidate me, in fact the more exotic & mysterious, the more exciting.  Anyhow, Janet is a whole subject which seems to be forcing it's way to the forefront.  Should I contact her?  I think that in some morbid way I took pleasure in cutting her off, as she had me at birth.  The catalyst for that is still strong in my mind & heart.  Speaking of that, I found younger pictures of my Grandfather, which I did not recall having.  It is so odd to thing how genetically I am related to this person I have never meet & assume I never will.  About 5 years ago, Janet & I had been in contact regularly.  I had met her already, when she flew to New Mexico for a vacation.  I was with Lyvia's mother at the time & envied her large, close family with it's monthly gatherings & such.  She lost both of her Grandfathers, within the first year & a half I knew her.  Janet always told me wonderful things about her father, how gentle he is, etc.  This is clear from his eyes in the one picture I have of him.  I wanted to meet him desperately.  My father's parents had died well before I was born/adopted.  My mother's died when I was relatively young, soon after the one time I had a chance to really spend any time with them.  I knew that Janet's parent lived in Arizona, not too far.  She was quite obsessive about my getting a degree, for some reason.  I tried to explain that I was an executive at a mortgage lender, and made vastly more money than most people with certificates of completion (degrees) on the wall, in fact I had stepped over 3 on my way to the position, 2 from USC, despite their 'business management' degrees.  One evening she calls & says that she will be coming to Arizona soon, as her father is quite ill, possibly/probably terminal.  I don't recall much of the conversation, other than the end.  I finally verbalized that I would love very much to meet him.  She let me know that although we had been in contact for about 3 years at that point, she had not informed her parents of this.  She feared that her mother would give her grief.  She made the statement that if I had a degree however, she was sure that her father would love to meet me, and her mother would be more accepting of it.  That was the last time we spoke."

"event","I was confronted by my six year old.  She said that I felt more like a friend than a real Dad.  She wished I was not so focused on my trips & my girlfriend.  

I told her that I was exceptionally proud of her for coming to me with her feelings, so we could share & understand, even perhaps find solutions.

I admitted that I had made some poor choices.  Too often I would allow her mother to go on outings with us, for I thought it would make Lyvia happier, plus I did not want her mother feeling bad, left out or that a wedge was being driven, based on my ability to pay for certain events and such.  In that I have neglected the time I could have used to get to know her more closely.  Lyvia shared that she would like us to have a closer, more meaningful relationship.  We agreed to take some time together & do things & learn more about each other, so that we do not miss out on this wonderful opportunity to have a close father - daughter relationship.

I am marveled & so very proud of her to have the courage to approach me with this.  Also the level of development of her thoughts & feelings, and most apparent is her empathy at only six years old.

Remarkable."

"event","I have been packing for the move.  This evening I endeavored to pack some of the things thrown idly about, within various drawers.  It is an odd mixture of things recent, recent & far past.  Packing in general is a melancholy emotion for me.  I enjoy change, but am conscious of finality as well.  This is the leaving behind of a house I have lived in for near 3 years.  It is also leaving of a county I have been in for roughly 7 years and all that that means & entails for me personally.  I could wax lyrical about that subject in particular & probably will at some point.

Admittedly I have avoided the big items in the memory sense.  Anything pertaining to my parents, including Janet I pushed aside for another evening.  I could of course simply cram things into boxes, without looking.  However that would eliminate the necessary aspect of throwing some things away, as well as the often cathartic experience of conjuring the past up, especially that which I had forgotten that I had forgotten.  It was odd to find a postcard from Janet (my biological mother) from Cornwall.  Her imploring me that I should travel & how nice it would be to meet me there.  I was recently there with Natasha.  The biggest difference being that Natasha does not require me to fulfill certain desires, expectations or psuedo-qualifications for me to be part of her life.  Hm-mm, I'll have to dive into that quick hit of anger at some other point.

I came across some fun things.  Old phone numbers...ah for those young days, as there were so very many of them.  I expected to find an old pack of 'players' cigarettes at any moment!  Old photos & correspondence from the Morrissey Apostles.  I even found a few pictures of Tim, from the last performance I saw of James.  It was the Palace 10 years ago or so.  How odd it was to think of that, and dancing with him now.  

A few more boxes full, and off to another day."

It is a very intriguing idea.  It also makes sense to consolidate like minded peoples, considering the vastness & relative sparseness of our country.  We certainly need a different approach, if we are to produce real change.  

I took a look at some homes for sale.  Admittedly I know nothing of the areas in particular, but one example was a beautiful (from the web pictures) 7 bedroom Victorian home, built in 1893 on an acre of land for $244,000.  This is typical.  The combination of like minded people, working toward a real & noble goal, as opposed to just talking about it, coupled with seeing my money go further than it does in Southern California anyway is definitely enticing."

"event","I watched Dr. Dean on Hardball tonight.  I am more comfortable with him than before.  Dennis Kucinich would be my first choice, but I must keep in mind that the primary season is near & he will be out of the race soon.  Even if all the candidates were equal in terms of popularity, Dr. Dean would be easily my second choice, so it's not too far a drop.  It is clear that as front runner he is trying to shake off the image of having a short temper & putting his foot in his mouth.  Oddly that is what has vaulted his campaign in the first place.  I appreciate hearing straight answers, even if I disagree.  Nothing would be more welcome from a candidate than to believe that they were actually speaking their own formulated thoughts & feelings & that they would follow through with them.  He did dip into a little political speak, the not answering of questions & such, but when pressed for a yes or know, he would give it, whereas I have been fair in watching the other candidates who to a man (other than Kucinich) will avoid actually answering a loaded question even when pressed for truth.  I was most impressed when he was pressed to answer whether or not he hoped that his back problem would get him out of the draft, he admitted a firm ""yes.""  I have not had so much interest in an election since...the last presidential election.  I was on the wrong side of that one.  I hope my candidate wins (again) and that this time I am not so disappointed with the outcome."

I wonder from **'s comment if he feels incomplete and so is buying into the whole idea that permeates our society that someone else out there is meant to complete us, rather than looking within ourselves to connect up the dots and thus feel complete.  I am so glad that you don't feel that I complete you.  In fact if you did feel that way, I wouldn't be around because I have always run away from people who have wanted me for that reason - I think that you have done the same.  I am ever so thankful for our relationship and how we are growing together and celebrating each other's growth.  The fact that you do not expect me to fit into a box of your making and vice versa means that I desire to be close to you and spend as much time with you as possible because I know that I do not have to or am expected to - I am free to choose and so because I have that choice, that very real choice with no undercurrents of resentment, I choose you.  I love you freely.  

She puts things far more succintly than I.  This is the epitome of a truly loving relationship, rather than a needy, possessive one, as we seem so ready to accept.  I am humbled & awed."

"event","The most magical time at the workshop was the Friday evening wave.  Natasha & I were near when it was a time for partners & as it happened we danced Lyrical & Silence together.  Our first night in Gomera of dancing we also danced Lyrical & Silence together.  On that night she saw my vulnerability, which I hide from others, even those I have known for years.  I saw her purity of spirit.  We had only met 2 days prior.  It was remarkable that I could be so open with someone I had just met, let alone at all.  It was and still is always rather easy to be utterly open & true with her.  It is unnatural to be otherwise.  I fell in love with her that night.  Last friday, as well shared those moments again, I fell in love with her even more.  Today I love her more still.

Elaine commented the next morning that we were beautiful together, even stating that it was an honor to witness us.  

Warm words from such wonderful & deep people are an even greater honor."

"event","My expectations were little more than to work with Tim & Kate again, as well as with Natasha for the first time as a couple.  I made a mask, a jester's cap, which I was unhappy with for I felt it was a bit of a fraud, that I could have done something more meaningful.  As the day drew on however, I realized that I could connect that aspect, to aspects that were prominent in my father.  I ran from this thought.  I abhor the idea that I would take on any traits of someone I hated.  I also wanted to hide the hate.  Until that moment, I felt that I had properly dealt with all significant emotions regarding my father, after his death a few years ago.  I now see that I had dealt with the love & some guilt, but just buried the uglier aspects.  This will be quite a challenge to deal with, but it is obviously the next step I must take.  Perhaps I will need to go to Gomera in February after-all!

I spent a great deal of the time working with Natasha.  Neither of us planned it, but we seemed to be near each other when it was time for partners, quite often.  Thus, I did not connect as much as at Earth's Embrace, for example, but I was quite fine with this.  It was a lovely bonding experience to share with her so much, and on the last day, as I dealt with the mask & the thoughts that came from it through constantly, I became more & more self-absorbed.  This was clearly a beginning, rather than an ending."

The immigration line had only 1 person in front of me, and everyone was friendly.  Even with a terminal change & a trip through immigration, it was only 30 minutes from disembarking, until I was at my gate for the Los Angeles connection.  The Immigration experience in LA is always up-wards of 2 hours, and having glorified security guards trying to be subtle, as they ask the same questions repeatedly is just a pain.  This is their one little nugget of power in the world, to make me late, and they are going to exploit it.  It is unfortunate that I feel far more welcome arriving in any foreign country than returning to my own.  That is not security, but harassment."

I am excited to work with Kate & Tim again, and of course with Natasha.  It has been so hectic here, that the event has just crept up on me, so I am not full of any deep thoughts beforehand, other than I look forward to delving deeper into myself & taking another step toward my goals & dreams.

Too bad I could not have gone earlier in the week.  I would have loved to participate in the Bush protests!  The last two trips I made, I made note of flyers, graffitti & such all over the country, regarding the war & this visit.  

I am tempted to stay home instead of leaving, and just planting myself in front of the television to watch Michael Jackson's arrest.  Hmmm, shall I waste valuable Tivo space??

I have a paper due tomorrow answering 2 questions and each has to be 3-4 pages long hmm lets see how this goes because i have not even started it. lol 
also i had a subway sandwich that is tuna. i don't think it was good tuna because i got so sick this morning to the point that I can not eat very much even now and its the afternoon. not to mention i dropped green tea on my laptop and i worried my ass to the point of not feeling well again of that it is ruined but it is working well still so maybe I just got lucky (MA)!
Chris and I do talk a little here and there but thank god its not all the time because he was starting to annoy me more so thank god its just easy.

"event","Hey there! so lets see what I have been up to the last week or so. 

Tuesday was St. Pattys day so of course i wore green that day. then at night i went to Maggies pub. had a couple drinks cuz earlier on i wasnt feeling so well. its really strange but on and off ive been feeling sick. yuck not to mention im always exhausted! i just dont get it. 
wed. i REALLY got sick so i missed all of my classes. 

Thursday only had 2 classes so i figured i would go to them eventhough my body was like wtf r u doing missy?? 
friday i was getting better but just a lil. it still didnt stop me from getting manicures and a pedicure done. i neva did a pedicure b4 this but i must say i am a fan! then i went bdubs and oddly enough the buffalo wild wings stayed down. but i really didnt eat a lot at time so that could b why. i wanted to go to an exchange that night but i was just laying in bed and was like i just dont want to get up i really just want a low key weekend. and that is what i did hooray! 

Saturday was beautiful so i went to Cold Stones and then to the movie theater. Marissa and I watched He's Just Not that Into You...Love that movie! I&nbsp;even bought the book haha

Sunday was Locust Cleanup and of course didnt feel well again that morning but i was like its an hour so get out of bed and just go. so i did, im proud of myself for that one. then we had chapter in the evening OMG i wanted to kill someone cuz of how long it was!! im sorry i love my ESA girls but I really have other things to do! kk well that night i didnt but wat if happens on a night i really do then wat? not to mention i was starving so my mood was a pissed off mood but i do have to admit everytime i looked down near my feet i was happy cuz Kara's late bday present was right thurr and i think its soo fuckin cute!! o and another thing since im driving to Starved Rock other people could ride with me and i have 3 girls i have neva seen b4 riding with me so this should b interesting. 

Monday was school and school is school nothing special. 

Same with tuesday. 

Now its Wed. and lets see tonight is the mandatory ed for the phi class...which i dont wanna go to cuz i have all my eds. so i really dont think these things should b mandatory but that is just me whining. then maybe sarah's apt. cuz she said she is bringing out the booze tonight with Leah and wants me to come on over. so yea that is all now im off to take a nap and then start on some hmwk."

i have figured out a plan which i hope doesnt get messed up but here it is... get my bach. degree in sociology then find a job and start paying off loans and saving some money up at the same time to get my masters at hopefully UIC. this is all while i am living at home so i can save money not to mention i dont think my fam. would be keen on me living by myself but after i get my masters (IA) and i havent found someone to be with yet i will save to get an apt downtown or near work. once i get my Masters i would love to work as a guidance councelor at a high school.

now im thinking about that someone i want to be with. will i ever find him?? oh gawd i hope so! slowly as days goes by im starting become more hopeless than before. questions start popping in my head...is there something wrong with me? why am i not good enough? is it really me or just them?...this all feels like an obstacle course where u have to go through a lot to get to the prize...the right guy. but for me the obstacle is like never ending...fml y the fuck can i just finish the obstacle and get to the end already?? they say he will come when u dont expect it HA&nbsp;i say the bullshit...there have been plenty of times i dont expect it but when i think of it now nothing fucking happened! 

well i guess im done with my rant for now just cuz i gotta go pack then pick up dan and head off to ISU"

Cost accounting isnt bad either i mean i know what i am doing but when the exam comes i blank so that is the part i def. need to fix. english well my professor def. needs a break since she is just driving the class bonanza! management is a bitch! i hate group projects, they never work out for me. also i think i will take next quarter off so all i need to do for that quarter is to apply to different colleges and work and save up my money.

neways Mrs. Jones (the director of the Study Abroad program) gave the all the students who r going (9 students) a 2 hr. orientation meeting. got to meet people who have gone and people who im going with. it should be very exciting but the only thing is that the people i see that i would be able to hang out with is this one girl named Maggie because everyone else is just not the people i usually end up hanging out with. which sounds bad but w/e its just how it is eh? they say to go to at least one palace/castle which ive planned on doing. also go out of the country for the weekend or even a day which i just might...i am thinking about France and/or&nbsp;Ireland. lets see one of the kids that went on the trip also gave out his email to everyone and he said he could get us into&nbsp;clubs as VIPs so as long as&nbsp;i give him my name i can get discounts for being a student and knowing him so hooray for that. im gonna need&nbsp;A LOT of money cuz they r soo effing expensive!! but im gonna look at it this way, i am a&nbsp;college student and i am suppose to be broke&nbsp;to some extent right? well i&nbsp;hope Allah will bless me in this department as well as he has been doing for me! i get to&nbsp;take 2 suitcases, 1 carry-on, and my laptop bag.&nbsp;that reminds me i need to get that converter thing whatever its called&nbsp;for comp. and other&nbsp;electrical things. i also need a laptop bag haha not to mention. i am right in the middle of downtown where&nbsp;everything is sooo i should be good with entertainment wise lol. i need to talk to my bro about when he will be arriving so i can hang out with him fo sho.&nbsp;hmm gotta find good priced hotels there for him damn. i want to go to France with him for sure.&nbsp; what else o i leave here May 11th at 6 pm and i arrive (inshallah) in London at 8 am. then take a bus over to school.&nbsp;

"event","like really i have written in here for like 9 days what?!?! 

neways lets see where we r at...
i need money desperatley for London cuz it is soo fucking expensive!! and i am gonna be another college student who is broke!
also tomorrow i am going downtown to the Chicago campus to have a London meeting with other students who r going and students who have gone. hmm i am kinda nervous cuz i have to admit i havent been on the train by myself and i am pretty nervous about that, like when do i get off? did i get on the right train? u know that kinda shit. anyways stating May 1 i have 2 days of classes a week for the first 2 weeks before i leave and my class will be in Chicago so i am gonna have to take the train for that but its only Tuesdays and Thursdays. then i immediatly have to get on the train so i can get to work.
then for a month and half i am gone to London (inshallah) and when i come back i have to take the class again in Chicago for Tuesdays and Thursdays. 
the quarter after i will have to take 5 classes instead of 4 so i can graduate the same time as i was planning.
i am hoping i dont have to take British airlines cuz they r bitches about luggage i hear.
i am also nervous about the whole pickpocket situation that happens all the time in Europe.
i think that is it what i want to say now but i shall return with some more shit to talk about."

"event","It was early in the morning at four.
When death knocked upon a bedroom door.
""Who is there?"" the sleeping one cried.
""I'm Izrael, let me inside.""

At once, the man began to shiver,
as one sweating in deadly fever, he
shouted to his sleeping wife,
""Don't let him take away my life.""

""Please go away, O Angel of Death!
Leave me alone, I'm not ready yet.
My family on me depend, give me a chance,
O please prepense!""

The Angel knocked again and again,
""Friend! I'll take your life without a pain,
'It is your soul Allah require,
I come not with my own desire.

Bewildered, the man began to cry,
""O Angel! I'm so afraid to die
I'll give you gold and be your slave,
don't send me to the unlit grave.""

""Let me in, O Friend!"" the Angel said,
""Open the door, get up from your bed.
If you do not allow me in,
I will walk through it, like a Jinn.""

The man held a gun in his right hand,
ready to defy the Angel's stand,
""I'll point my gun, towards your head.
You dare come in, I'll shoot you dead.""
By now, the Angel was in the room,
Saying, ""O Friend! prepare for your doom.
Foolish man, Angels never die,
Put down your gun and do not sigh.""

""Why are you afraid! Tell me O man,
to die according to Allah's plan?
Come, smile at me, do not be grim,
be happy to return to Him.""

""O Angel! I bow my head in shame,
I had no time to take Allah's name.
From morn till dusk I made my wealth,
not even caring for my health.""

""Allah's commands I never obeyed
nor five times a day I ever prayed.
A Ramadan came and Ramadan went but
no time had I to repent.""

""The Haj was already fard on me
But I would not part with my money.
All charities I did ignore taking usury more and more.""

""Sometimes I sipped my favorite wine
with flirting women I sat to dine.
O Angel! I appeal to you spare my life for a year or two.""

""The Laws of Qur'an I will obey,
I'll begin Salat this very day.
My Fast and Haj, I will complete,
and keep away from self conceit.""

""I will refrain from usury,
and give all my wealth to charity, wine
and wenches I will detest,
Allah's oneness I will attest.""

""We Angels do what Allah demands,
we cannot go against His commands.
Death is ordained for everyone,
father, mother, daughter or son.""

""I'm afraid, this moment is your last,
now be reminded, of your past.
I do understand your fears
but it is now too late for tears.""

""You lived in this world, two score and more,
Never did you, your people adore.
Your parents, you did not obey,
hungry beggars, you turned away.""

""Your two ill-gotten, female offsprings,
in night-clubs, for livelihood they sing.
Instead of making more Muslims,
you made your children non-Muslims.""

""You ignored the Mu'athin's Athaan,
nor did you read the Holy Qur'an.
Breaking promises all your life,
backbiting friends, and causing strife.""

""From hoarded goods, great profits
you made, and your poor workers,
you underpaid.
Horses and cards were your leisure,
money-making was your pleasure.""

""You ate vitamins and grew more fat,
with the very sick, you never sat.
A pint of blood you never gave,
which could a little baby save.""

""O human, you have done enough wrong,
you bought good properties for a song.
When the farmers appealed to you,
you did not have mercy, 'tis true.""

""Paradise for you? I cannot tell,
undoubtedly you will dwell in hell.
There's no time for you to repent,
I'll take your soul for which I'm sent.""

The ending, however, is very sad.
Eventually the man became mad.
With a cry, he jumped out of bed.
And suddenly, he fell down dead.

O Reader! take a moral from here,
you never know, your end may be near.
Change your living and make amends,
for heaven, on your deeds depends.

With du'a
Wassalamu'alaikum wa Rahmatullah wa Barakatuh

"event","<!--StartFragment -->THE COLD WITHIN

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Six humans trapped by circumstances,
in bleak and bitter cold.
Each one possessed a stick of wood,
or so the story told.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their dying fire in need of logs,
the first man held his back,
for,of the faces around the fire,
he noticed one man black.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next man looking across the way,
saw one not of his church,
and couldn't bring himself
to give the fire his stick of birch.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The third one sat in tattered clothes
he gave his coat a hitch.
Why should his log be put to use,
to warm the idle rich?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The rich man just sat back
and thought of the wealth he had in store,
and how to keep what he had earned
from the lazy, shiftless poor.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The black man's face bespoke revenge
as the fire passed from his sight,
for all he saw in his stick of wood,
was a chance to spite the white.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The last man of this forlorn group
did naught except for gain,
giving only to those who gave,
was how he played the game.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their logs held tight in death's still hand,
was proof of human sin.
They didn't die from the cold without,
they died from the cold within.

here is another poem i felt like putting up, like i do haha.

so how this is my day so far...
went to my 10:00 class then to my 12:00 class and got done at 1:00
going to do my accounting homework
going to do my critical thinking homework
shop&nbsp;for a CD,&nbsp;blank CDs, and some more few things&nbsp;
go to work between 5:00p.m.-1:00a.m. maybe 12:00a.m.(how insane, but its inventory)
go home (inshallah) by&nbsp;12:30 to 1:30a.m.
go to bed

life is very busy, which at times i dont mind cuz it gives me something to do but college life for me is just staying at home, going to classes, and going to work. no parties or anything which to tell ya the truth i&nbsp;dont mind cuz i am starting to become all about stayin at home and sleeping, but dont worry when every1 comes back home we need a lil party/get together so i can see people and actually put some fun in my life, eh?

okay im outtie"

"event","<p align=""center"">okay so i totally failed my accounting final no questions about that and i really want to cry about it! what makes it even worse is that i got on to the honors list and if i get a C in the class it wont be the greatest of achievements, it may not&nbsp; even be called an achievement. also my parents really know how to work me up. i mean this morning i couldnt stop yelling at them nor could they stop yelling at me gawd. then usually my parents make me take out the garbage by the street and today i saw it i knew that i was suppose to but i didnt cuz i dont want to do anything for anybody. people annoy its as simple as that and i dont believe that will ever really change.&nbsp;<br /><br />so in other news i have lyrics of different songs stuck in my head so i figured i&nbsp;would type a couple&nbsp;in here...<br /><br />""those who do not feel me is not real to me therefore he does not exist so poof vamos son of bitch""<br /><br />""If i tol' you once, I tol' you twice, <br />You can see it in my eyes,<br />I'm all cried out with nothin' to say,<br />You're everything i wanted to be,<br />If you could only see your heart belongs to me,<br />I love you so much,<br />I'm yearin' for your touch,<br />Come and set me free,<br />Forever yours i'll be,<br />Baby won't you come and take this pain awayay.""<br /><br /></p>"

"event","-So thursday i worked from 3:45-9:15
-friday worked from 3:45-10:00
-saturday worked from 5:00-9:00
-sunday woke up at 4:30 am and leave for work at 5:15am start work at 6:00-2:30
kind of watched the superbowl but at times fell asleep but i recorded it because some1 wanted me too. i gotta say colts suck balls. bears suck balls. commercials suck balls. everybody and everything suck balls!!!!!! so i fell asleep at like 11:30 and i am like not going to school cuz i worked so long and i planned on coming home and sleeping but i had watch the Superbowl to make sure it recorded. i cant believe grossman! but i do feel bad for him getting critized before hand and we know he will be after this and i dont know but isnt this like his first year in the league? poor guy...but i do gotta say i think he has wat it takes to become a whole lot better. and wat the other guys on both teams had many other years on the league compared to grossman so even though he didnt play well AT ALL those others guys didnt play as well as i think they should have. more plays would have helped them a lot.
-mark comes home on the 8th but i wont get to see him cuz he is only coming for 1 day and for his dads bday.&nbsp;
-hey it was 0degrees and in just 1 minute it changed to 2degrees.
-new rule cant wear jeans without a jacket...we need to be more sophisticated but it will still look casual. i gotta say i love fashion, i love my fashion. i would love to have some1 i can shop with and be like let me pick out your clothes cuz yr sense of fashion sucks!! haha"

"event","<p>okay i came to the conclusion that i have&nbsp;A.D.D how the hell did i get to this conclusion u ask? well i dont pay attention to anyone says to me. i try to listen but it just doesnt happen. in class i am talking too much, i am doodling way toooooooo much. i dont know what is going on in my classes and thats not good. and i dont know how to start paying attention. i seriously have a problem! some1 please help me! when some1 talks to me i wont be listening, i try and i feel bad b/c i will pretend to listen but if some1 is telling me a story im just like thinking about other things.<br /><br />in other news im back to working again thank god. so i had my orientation today. i guess i am working in the back a lot which i dont mind b/c they r clothes and not heavy boxes of sprays or lotion or glass items, when u drop those it is def. not fun but i doubt&nbsp;i will drop clothes haha. so things i learned about The Limited...they are known well for the their pants even though their shirts r also fantastic...we have 2 kinds pants 1 named Drew and the other Cassidy and each kind have different styles, so u can get casual or sophisticated or w/e. hmm those r just a couple. next week i will get 19 hrs. finally buuuut that means i will miss Lincoln Heights but i can just watch that later b/c they always play it later on again. then i will also miss Supernatural which will suck.<br /><br />i think Nawal knows i dont like her b/c she doesnt talk to me as much. and i think she finally learned that i dont need to be wasting my time talking to a drunk-ass like hers at school. what else my friend comes up to me today and was like ""omg i am so high, this cheeseburger is so delicious"" like what do i say to that, good for u i am proud yr high? haha if she gets high just so its an excuse to hang out with Nawal its pretty pathetic.<br /><br />lets see wat else...i miss my bro. i get even more bored when he isnt around. hes outta town in oklahoma like wtf? but thats work 4 ya. i&nbsp;cant even talk to him. like yesterday was the only time i talked to for practically 2 weeks! thats insane. in the Wii he became a pro in tennis and i still havent its like wtf is going on here lol.<br /><br />there is a new show on right now called Engaged&amp;Underage. its about couples that get engaged while they may still be in high school or they just graduated, awesome lol.<br />k my comp. did that whole pink screen thing again so before it turns blue and i loose what i wrote i will go now bye ya'lls...i finally wrote a lil more than i usually do eh?</p>"

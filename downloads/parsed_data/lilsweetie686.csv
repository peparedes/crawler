I feel like the world is going to seriously end soon in the direction we're heading. But seeing over the last 2 days that Roe V. Wade might be overturned already is just... I can't even describe how upsetting it is. I mean, how long have we had the new justices? Crazy. Sorry... not much else to say and stuff, but I had to vent so I can move on with my life and do my homework. Hope all is well."

Just finished my first final. One paper, one final to go. I'm sooo ready to go home. It's not even funny. I just don't wanna be here. And I'm so excited for a break without homework, but I feel like break is so far away, because I have so much work to do between now and saturday. AHHHHHHHH!. Okay, so yeah. That's my update. Other than that, I don't like being cold, math, or papers. And I can't wait to see everyone.

And I have a shitload of work right until Thanksgiving break starts. So yeah. And I wanted to take an extra class next semester but the only teacher left is a really shitty one... so I dunno if I should? Any one? Ideas? It would help for the job I want to have this summer. But if the teacher sucks... plus it's for people who got less than a 680 on their SAT 1s for math. Well I have to go... edit a paper on a book I didn't read. AHH! love to all... see you all soon!"

1) I'm failing math. I hate it. It hates me. That is all. 

2) Duke basketball makes me happy. Even if it means I will fail math more. You can't go to Duke and not love it. It is my shit. Yes. My shit. Do you have a problem with that? Maybe because your team will lose. Haha. Go to hell, Carolina, eat shit! 

3) Thanksgiving break is soon. I'm pretty sure I'll be home Friday evening through Sunday afternoon, ish? I might leave early monday morning depending on stuff. But again, still not sure. 

4) I just ate 2 really yummy s'mores. One for me, one for Hallie. Yes. I can eat a s'more for someone? haha. :o) 

5) I'm taking too many credits next semester. But hopefully my advisor will let me.

Hope you all had a good October and are now getting excited about upcoming holidays! :o) I'm sooooo excited for winter break. I'm excited for Thanksgiving, too. But OH MAN I can't wait for winter break. Halloween was good - hence the new facebook picture. Finally, I know. I'm going home this weekend -- one of my friends wanted to go to Howard to visit this weekend and this was the only one that was good for her - otherwise I'd have gone last weekend for HC. And right now I'm having such a hard time motivating myself to work. I have a paper due on Thursday and I haven't done any of the reading and I'm fucked. Why do I fail at school? I'm still not out of senior slump. And I hate math now. I used to love it, and now... AHHH!!!! It takes over my life. So I'ma leave and pretend to work. I love you all, miss you... talk to you soon... call me!!"

<TD align=middle><FONT size=5><B>Hippie</B></FONT><BR>You are 28% Rational, 71% Extroverted, 14% Brutal, and 28% Arrogant. </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD>You are the Hippie! Characterized by a strong sense of extroversion, irrationality, gentleness, and humility, you no doubt frolic through fields preaching peace and love to all! You are probably either very spiritual or needlessly paranoid about ""the man"", like most hippies, as a result of your focus on intuition and feelings over cold, brutal logic. You are also very, very social. And like any hippie, who would have no qualms about hitchiking across the country just to meet some interesting people, you too love to interact with others, even complete strangers. Because we know most any hippie is peace-loving and humble, it stands to reason that you, as well, are terribly gentle and humble, almost to the point of revulsion. Your carefree attitude of peace and harmony is probably very, very sickening to realists or cynics or anyone who isn't a hippie, to tell the truth. In short, your personality is defective because you are overly emotional, extroverted, gentle, and humble--thus making you an annoying hippie. And you listen to psychadelic rock and smoke a whole lot of pot. Okay, maybe not, but I wouldn't be surprised if you did. 
<P>
<P><B>To put it less negatively:</B> 
<P><I>1. You are more INTUITIVE than rational. 
<P>2. You are more EXTROVERTED than introverted. 
<P>3. You are more GENTLE than brutal. 
<P>4. You are more HUMBLE than arrogant.</I> 
<P><B>Compatibility:</B> 
<P>Your exact opposite is the <A href=""http://www.okcupid.com/tests/describescore?testid=4741219933576750506&amp;score0=100&amp;score1=0&amp;score2=100&amp;score3=100"">Sociopath</A>. 
<P>Other personalities you would probably get along with are the <A href=""http://www.okcupid.com/tests/describescore?testid=4741219933576750506&amp;score0=100&amp;score1=100&amp;score2=0&amp;score3=0"">Hand-Raiser</A>, the <A href=""http://www.okcupid.com/tests/describescore?testid=4741219933576750506&amp;score0=0&amp;score1=100&amp;score2=0&amp;score3=100"">Televangelist</A>, and the <A href=""http://www.okcupid.com/tests/describescore?testid=4741219933576750506&amp;score0=100&amp;score1=0&amp;score2=0&amp;score3=0"">Robot</A>.

<P><I>If you scored near fifty percent for a certain trait (42%-58%), you could very well go either way.

Your birth on the 19th day of the month adds a tone of independence and extra energy to your life path. 

But at the same time, it poses a number of obstacles to overcome before you are able to be as independent as you would like. The number 1 energy suggests more executive ability and leadership qualities than your path may have indicated. 



A birthday on the 19th of any month gives greater will power and self-confidence, and very often a rather original approach. However, a somewhat self-centered approach to life that may be in conflict with some of the other influences in your life. 

This 1 energy may diminish your ability and desire to handle details, preferring instead to paint with a broad brush. 



You are sensitive, but your feeling stay somewhat repressed. 

You have a compelling manner that can be dominating in many situations. 

You do not tend to follow convention or take advice very well. 



Consequently, you tend to learn through experience; sometimes hard experiences. 

The 19/1 is a loner number and you may experience feelings of being alone even if you are married. 

You may take on a tendency to be nervous and angry.</td>

I have never been so hurt and maddened and disappointed in a friend. *obviously none of my lovely ljers whom i love dearly for being real friends who are mature enough to have friendships and who care about me too*
I feel cheated, betrayed, and so upset and emotional and mad overall. And I don't really want to go into it, but I can't get it off my mind, and I wanted to write something. So I hope you all never have a loser friend who sucks and who turns out to be not a friend at all, because no one deserves that.

"event","Wow. Oh my gosh. West Side Story was absolutely amazing. I love you all, so much. It was such a purgation of emotion. I just was blown away. And I even started to cry on the way home thinking about all my amazing friends and the amazing job they did tonight. Everyone was so talented. It made me so happy and now I have a completely new level of respect and admiration for all of you. NOt that I didn't respect or admire you, but it kind of confirmed and enhanced those feelings? I dunno. And yay for Yen crying with me. AND ALL THOSE BOYS NEED TO JOIN CHOIR! NOW!!!!!!

Which brings me to spring show. I'm so excited for it, but then again, dreading it coming, because I love choir so much and I know I'll be a wreck, much worse than tonight. But I'm also just so pysched! I know it will be such an amazing experience. A night I'll never forget. It's really finally hitting me that we are leaving. And I'm ready, but I will miss choir, and all of the choirites (as well as all my other awesome friends!)

And this afternoon... well... all I have to say is 2ge+her rocks, as do those who love it too! :o) SOO much fun drunk driving without being drunk, and singing at the top of my lungs with Lisa and Jenn to 90s pop! Must be repeated. Defintely. And we are also definitely doing that CD. Introducing Lisa to Evan & Jaron is essential. 

Hope everyone is having a good night, and have a good weekend. I love everybody. A lot. And if you haven't already, for superlatives put me for sunshine on a rainy day (you know I am ;oP)"

"event","So, freshman preview tonight. Do you remember when we were there. Seems like a lifetime ago. The whole thing is so crazy. Being there, describing the awesomeness that is choir got me thinking about all the amazing times we've had over the years. Especially freshman year, just getting to know each other, and New York funness. I definitely feel like I'm ready to leave TJ, start something new, but when it comes to choir, I'm dreading leaving it. This year has been interesting with clique-y-ness and stuff, but overall it's so nice to have all these wonderful people together and just talking, singing, being absolutely crazy... I'm gonna miss it a lot. So to all you choirites - I love you muchos. Thanks for making my time at TJ bearable."

"event","Back from Vassar and UVa. I actually don't think there could be two more different schools, but I'll save the college entry for later, after Duke, except to say that my indecisiveness is going to be a problem, I think. 
There are so many random things which are going to be said right now, but you all will just have to deal. Or stop reading. Ha ;o) 
First, how beautiful was it today?! I am so ready for this gorgeous weather. It really boosts my mood. A lot. But it makes me think that it's later in the year than it is, which is both sad and happy. Because I'm glad that there is still time for funness in choir and hanging out with cool people, but I am sick of work and studying and the rest of school in general. 

OMG my right butt cheek really hurts. Just thought I'd let you in on that little secret. Fell off my pony on Saturday, and landed on this thing which held up the jump, and I have a huge bruise and it's ugly and my butt hurts. The end. haha. And AJ was kind of a brat at times this weekend. As I said, if he were a boy I would have dumped him, and then taken him back when he was an angel on Saturday afternoon. But I was harboring some unhappy feelings toward him at some points during the weekend. 

And, 8 hour car rides with my mom. Very hard to describe, and probably not all that entertaining to hear about unless you know my mom. But if you do, you can imagine that it was CRAZY. First, my mom is the most directionally challenged woman I have ever met. We have driven to and from the barn a thousand times, and she still has no idea how to get there or back. So I had to direct her, which is always fun. We were getting gas, and she swerved away because she saw a sign for Newark and Baltimore, and thought it was going North. (We were in Delaware.) Then every time we saw brake lights she screamed or made some noise. Then, by the time it had been 6 hours and we were passing through northern VA on the way to Charlottesville, she went crazy. It was really funny. On 29 she regressed to her southern accent. I think I laughed the entire time we were on 29, with her constant commentary. She kept saying, ""daaamn huuhnay"" and things like that. And she has really bad vision, and never wears her glasses, so she saw this sign that said ""Airport motors"" and exclaimed, ""What are apricot motors?!"" LOL. It was soo funny.  

Sorry if you actually read that all, but I hope you were entertained, or at least it helped procrastination ;o)"

I put all these guilty pleasure songs on it, and for the last half hour or so I listened to Britney Spears, Hanson, Evan & Jaron, and a song from That Thing You Do.

That was kind of a fun thing to do... personality tests and online quizzes are generally so addictive. Hope everyone is having a good spring break?! It snowed/sleeted today in upstate NY, which was a little depressing, but it was nice yesterday, so that was happyful on my birthday. I'm 18! Crazy! And fun... so yeah. 
So, as most of you know I've been up here, ""horsing"" as some of my friends say... which has been really fun. And all the girls who work at the barn dressed up my horse for my birthday with tinsel in his mane and on his nose and red christmas bows and those ""happy birthday"" banners that you hang up on kids birthdays with the reflecty color things which was really cute and made me feel loved. :o) I've been having a really good time, but it's weird, because although I am a much better rider than I used to be and I am improving a lot, I've fallen off twice in the last two days. The second time was because AJ *my horse* was being a bum and a half and stopped right before a jump, so there was nothing I could do, but it seems counterintuitive that I would fall off more now that I am better than before. One of my old instructors told me that once you've fallen off 10 times you'd be a good rider. I've fallen off now about 18 times throughout the time that I've been riding and I guess I'm good enough, but nowhere near where I want to be. Oh well... the good thing is that I've never really been seriously hurt. 
This is going to sound kind of whiny and maybe immature, but I'm gonna say it anyway. (After all, that's what LJ is for, right?) It's just discouraging that it seems like everyone I know and all my friends have found out that they've gotten into at least one school, and I still haven't heard anything. And I'm sure I'll get in somewhere and be happy wherever I end up going, but I just feel left out and not smart. I know I am pretty smart, but I feel academically inferior to, like, the whole lunch group and a lot of people at TJ. Which hasn't really been an issue for me, because I can learn so much from everyone, and it's awesome that I have these amazing, brilliant friends, but sometimes I just wish I could be on the same level. At good old BFCDS I was always one of the smartest and it was kind of an ego boost, but I feel that since coming to TJ I haven't been in the top of anything, riding, singing, or school stuff. Which is fine, but I dunno, it's just nice to feel like you can do one thing really well, which I don't. 
So, sorry for the really long I've-just-fallen-off-for-the-2nd-time-in-2-days post. Hope everyone's having a good spring break, and if you're feeling bored and wanna talk, our number up here is 518-398-1885 (yes, we have a phone line up here, it's actually pathetic, but oh well :o) )"

That would be me, right now. And I just felt like sharing my stupidity, because that's fun, and because I never update, and I figured I'd try to be better about that. And yes, if you want to know the song, you won't actually know it, but it's Something Else by my guilty pleasure, Evan & Jaron. Gotta love iPods, and diong the shuffle thing so random songs you haven't heard in like 4 years come up. Makes me happy. Everyone should have an iPod. And that is the moral of the story. Haha 
Hope everyone is having a fun Sunday night, though I presume people all are dying with homework like me.

"event","Oh man. So feeling randomly shitty and depressed (which is the point of having one of these) so I will write something for my once a month(ish) post. Anyway, I just feel like this year has not been the best. My classes suck but more importantly I feel like I haven't really seen or hung out with most of my friends in a while (though friday night was awesome). And it's depressing because I know it's my fault, and I know the exact cause, but I feel helpless in stopping what I am now calling my addiction. *this is going to be very cryptic to pretty much everybody reading this, just fyi, don't feel bad if you're like ""what?"" by addiction I do not mean drugs or alcohol or anything crazy like that* So I'm gonna try to be a better friend now...  
And people can be so dense sometimes. Which is frustrating. As Seethal said, we should ship all the stupid people (aka stupid people + republicans) off to Mars. Not that stupid and dense are the same... just a thought though. Do you ever do something and then you realize what you are doing (or saying) and think ""oh my gosh is that me saying that?"". Cuz sometimes I take a step back and think how could I be so needy and controlling and just bitchy? And then I feel bad. So basically, the root of my feeling ugly (and by ugly I mean depressed, because ugly is the ultimate adverb - and adjective) is me. Which is also ugly. It's just that with certain people, I want them to do a certain thing or respond a certain way, and then I feel bad and am like, dude, Gillet, just let people be themselves. But it doesn't stop me from wanting it... 

Okay well I don't know if that made any sense but I have kind of a long day ahead of me, so I'll try to sleep. (So glad I'm going to Cedar Crest tomorrow. So not glad I'll be in the car for 6 hours. Hmmph.)"

Awesome. But does that mean that one boobie is ""Love"" and the other is ""Muffins"" or that they are both ""Love Muffins""? Hmm... So I have a random not so funny but kind of interesting story about boobie names. Actually I have more than one, but I will only burden you, the crazy person who is reading this LJ post, with one. Does anyone remember the Evan and Jaron est. 1974 shirt I used to have? (I miss it! Evan and Jaron = the best!) Well anyway, the first time I wore it was the last day of camp. And this guy's brother was there to take him home, and so the guy introduced me to his brother, and before his brother said ""hi"" or ""nice to meet you"" or any of the normal greetings, he asked me if I had named my boobies Evan and Jaron. I of course, told him he shouldn't be looking at my boobies (hot as they are... ;oP) but it was kind of funny in a not laughing kind of way. But it had to do with Evan and Jaron, and that makes me happy. Wow I'm a freak. haha 

Hope everyone has a boobilicious last day of the long weekend! (And by boobilicious I mean great) ;o)"

That's me... except the little part, but I sure as hell am all the rest. oh man. If you close your eyes and use your imagination. ;o) okay, well we have a two hour delay tomorrow and that's happy. But what's not happy is writing my All the King's Men (awesome book you all should read it) analysis and not being able to make sugar cookies for Seethal's GOLDEN birthday (though I'll have them Wednesday! :o))

so everyone enjoy sleeping in tomorrow, and don't freak out about the mountain of tests or work we have coming up to finish the semester! we've almost made it, seniors!"

"event","I love getting Christmas presents! But I always feel bad cuz I never know what to get anyone. What are good presents for guys? Anyone who has suggestions, please let me know... I am at a total loss. Today is Christmas Eve day! That makes me excited. But I actually have had such a hard time actually grasping that it is winter break and that Christmas is so soon and yeah... and I have soo much work to do on college apps (just like everyone else)! I was going to be so productive today, and then that just died. A lot. As if anything could die a lot. But oh well. 
And I'm sad because when I go to the barn it will be the last time I ride with one of the instructors, cuz her 1 year working visa to work in the US is over in January, and she's going back to England. 
OMG I'm listening to Evan and Jaron and that makes me SOOO happy. I'm so pathetic, listening to a group that no one remembers and were one hit wonders but who are actually soo amazing! Or maybe that's just my opinion. Oh man. So I'm gonna go to bed so I will hopefully wake up and be able to do some work? And of course, that won't happen, but I can pretend. 
Merry Christmas! *almost*"

"event","I'm kind of excited... I have an lj... and then again, kind of saddened by my breaking down and actually getting one. Oh well. At least Lisa is happy haha :o) Okay. So I want you to look at that smiley face I just did, and tell me if you think that's supposed to mean I have a big nose. Because that's what some people think I am saying, and, while it may be true, it's ugly. Oh man... yay for doing absolutely nothing in 8th period. 


Oh wait! I almost forgot that I have to say how excited I am about Caroling tonight!!! SOOOO EXCITED!!! :o) (again with the big-nosed smiley face) Hopefully it's not too cold tonight. But because a little person (called Seethal, she's really hot) was smart and told me she'd bring two pairs of gloves, I am too. And now A block is over."

"event","Background:

I have been identified by my company to take a course titled ""Results Centred Leadership.""  The general goal is to improve my skills at leading the small team I have been assigned.  One of the topics we talk about is motivation, and people were identifying monetary compensation as a major motivator for employees.  I disagreed with this, given that cash is not a motivator for me in my day-to-day job.  This led to an interesting discussion.

Hypothesis:

Once basic needs are met (ie, you're able to comfortably support yourself and your dependents), cash money is not a significant source of positive motivation.  However, perceived inequities and/or unfairness can be a significant source of demotivation.

Discussion:

Do you agree or disagree with this hypothesis?  I'm especially interested in your story if your basic needs are met, yet you still find cash compensation to be a major motivating force in your job.  Consider the following questions:
o Does the promise of a future raise or bonus result in a daily increase in effort?
o Does your answer change if you consider performance-based bonuses?  (ie, piecework, early completion of tasks, etc)

Personally, it doesn't for me.  I don't know if I'm an unusual case or not, and I'm trying to find out.  When my boss promises me incentives for project performance, I happily accept them, but it does not significantly impact the amount of effort that I put into a project.  Similarly, I'm happy when I'm given a raise, but it is not the goal of obtaining a raise that causes me to work hard throughout the year.

"event","Another one-way hike, thanks to the beauty of carpooling.  <lj user=""dairymilk"">, Minnie, and I were joined by J, and her sister C for a wonderful hike in the Iroquoia section of the trail.  We started at Tiffany Falls, which is actually 460m up a side trail from the main trail.  If you're ever in the area, I highly recommend taking a quick visit.  The path to the falls is wide, smooth stone dust, suitable even for strollers.  The end of the canyon is amazingly picturesque.  I do suggest, though, going early in the morning.  There was nobody there at 9am, but when we arrived back at 1:30 in the afternoon, the parking lot was absolutely packed.

It's really amazing how much of the Bruce Trail, even in the heart of Hamilton/Dundas, manages to stay in conservation areas.  Most of what we were hiking through was apparently the Dundas Valley Conservation Area.  We had a quick stop at the Centre of Trails there to buy some ice cream, and get some bandaids for J's blistered heel.

Lunch was taken in the parking lot of a golf course, with a bit of lucky shade.  Unfortunately, the last 2.5km of the hike were along Dundas city streets, due to a right of way issue crossing the CN rail line towards Webster's Falls.  A real pity, as that Spencer Gorge loop is a perennial favourite 3h hike.  The conservancy is working on getting those access rights back, probably through arranging for a safe crossing of the rail line.  I look forward to that happening.

Minnie conked out after lunch, and I had to drag her the last 2.5km.  We made it all the way to the confluence of the Main Trail and the Webster's Falls side trail, then a quick jog back down Sydenham rd to where we parked on a side street.

"event","July 30 hike with a whole lot of people, Minnie included :)

We wanted to hike the Spencer Gorge area of the trail, and a second group of people were going to join us at the start, and hike a smaller loop at a slower pace.  However, it was pointed out to us that the main trail had been re-routed away from the gorge, because of the rail crossing.  So, instead we started at Webster's Falls, and made our way to the Royal Botanical Gardens, where the trail crosses Patterson Road.

This time, <lj user=""dairymilk""> and I brought over five litres of water.  Between the two of us, Minnie, and sharing with other hikers that hadn't brought enough for themselves, we burned through it all before we finished.  Minnie decided halfway through that it was too hot, and crawled under a tree on someone's yard, lay down, and refused to move.  We let her have a five minute break, but since our car was parked a long way away, she had to get back on her feet and struggle through the sun :)

Officially, we were only on the main trail from where it hits Sydenham Road, and we were on a side trail for the first 4 km.

"event","A Hike on July 24th with J, <lj user=""dairymilk"">, Minnie, and I.  We started at the Toronto/Iroquoia border on Appleby Line, and marched our way all the way to the furthest connection point to the Crawford Lake side trail.

If I recall correctly, this was a beautiful day for a hike.  Sunny and hot.  We brought a whole lot of water along on this one.  Minnie got doused with muskol, to try to prevent a relapse of the lumpiness that she gets with deerfly bites.  She did get quite a few mosquito bites, though, so we gave her half a benadryl at what we thought was going to be near the end of the hike.  Of course, between when the 24th edition of the trail guide was printed and when we walked the trail, the Crawford Lake Side Trail and the main trail had moved, so we ended up walking a couple of kilometres longer than we though we would be :/

"event","This posting is quite late.  It documents the hike that <lj user=""dairymilk"">, Minnie and I went on with J, J&M on June 5th.  For this particular hike, we decided to knock off the start of the trail.  Our route took us from Queenston Heights, kilometre zero, to about km 13, where the trail crosses the access road in the Woodend Conservation Area (26th edition of the trail guide).

The terrain here is very different from the other sections of the trail that we've hiked.  There was much more deciduous tree cover, and the escarpment itself is much less cliff-like - much more erosion and soil cover.  The weather was very nice - sunny and clear, but a little hot.  Geographically, it was a nice hike, but really, so many other things went wrong, that a lot of us were disappointed with the hike.

First, J lost her camera when she slipped on the trail.  We walked back half a klick checking the sides of the trail for it, but couldn't find it.

Next, halfway through the hike, poor Minnie the dog got so many mosquito bites so quickly that it overloaded her immune system, and her face got all swollen and lumpy.  Needless to say, this really freaked out S.  Luckily, the trail crossed a road right there, so we asked one of the homeowners if there was a drug store nearby, thinking to go there and buy some Benadryl (an antihistamine that I know dogs can take safely).  Unfortunately, the directions we got were wrong, and I walked very quickly 1.5km down the road before finding a corner store, where they didn't have any benadryl, and told me that the drugstore was about 8km in the other direction.  So, no drugs for Minnie, but I picked up 5 creamsicles and started to hike back towards everyone else, only to find Stacey coming in the store, to tell me that they asked a passing motorist, and he also said that we were going the wrong way.

By the time the two of us got back to the others and Minnie, the swelling had started to go down, so we decided to continue the hike.  Through the Bruce Trail.  Dodging dirtbikes.  Yay.

By the time we finished the hike, we were all hot, tired, and very thirsty.  Luckily, we got to wait at the end while S&J drove back to Queenston Heights to get the other car.  Then we found the ticks.  Wood ticks, not deer ticks, so there is no risk of Lyme disease, but we had to sterilize everything we took on the hike, as well as perform thorough inspections when we got home.  Ugh.

Oh, and M apparently had heat exhaustion, and had to pull over on the drive home to be sick.

Not our favourite hike of the trail.

"event","This is a special posting.  It's a report of my performance in the 100 Miles of Nowhere bicycle race, prepared for Fatty, of http://www.fatcyclist.com/.  For those of you not coming there from his blog, you're probably asking what 100MoN is.  Well, it started as a joke.  Fatty rode 100 miles on his bike, on rollers, inside, in front of the television.  His blogging audience thought that it was such an awesome stunt, they all wanted in on it.  It's now become an annual fundraising event for the Livestrong Foundation.  Cyclists all over the world ride 100 miles on ridiculously short courses, or on trainers or rollers, or on stationary bikes.  The entire entry fee for the race is a donation to the Livestrong Foundation.  And, because you get to define your category, you're guaranteed to get a first place finish in it.  So, on to the race report:

The Man:

Codenamed Psychedelic Bike, the 6'3"" monster of a man weighs in at a surprising 230 lbs (race weight).  His thighs are larger around than many a model's waist, measuring a massive, crank-pumping 26 inches.  By day, he works a desk job, pushing pixels around for money.  By night, he rides his bike, plays Ultimate, is an avid hiker (currently attempting to hike the 830km Bruce trail from end to end), and participates in local theatre as an actor, director, and on the technical side as well.

The Machine:

Pictured in the user icon above, it's a 2005 Rans Rocket recumbent bicycle.  Like riding an easy chair.  Non-stock components that have been added include a Terracycle Easyreacher underseat rack, on which hangs an Arkel Overdesign RT-40 pannier, which will hold all of the provisions for the 100 mile ride.  The power idler has be upgraded with the wonderful replacement that Terracycle also makes.  Clipless pedals from MEC hold the powertrain of the bicycle together.  And there's fenders too, because this is the bike that is used to commute to work every day, from when the snow melts to when the snow flies.

The Training:

After reading many race reports for long-distance bike rides, I have discovered that the hardest part of riding long distances isn't cardiovascular fitness.  It's not muscular power either.  No, according to other cyclists, the hardest part of riding long distances is just the incredible discomfort of a bicycle that hits after hour three, or four, or six.  To train for this, I have obtained a seat that is as close as I can to my bike seat.  For upwards of four hours each night, I have put my body through the gruelling task of sitting in a recliner, in front of a television.  Sometimes, I even watch nature shows on the television, to simulate being out in the wide world.

I've also taken a page from Fatty's playbook.  He has talked about the importance of carbo-loading prior to a big ride.  I've taken this advice to heart, and for the past month, I've been eating huge plates of pasta, and big loaves of bread to supply myself with the quick energy that I'll need for the ride.  In fact, I have put on eight pounds of quick energy since starting this training regimen.

The Preparation:

Okay, I'm gonna tell the truth here.  I haven't done much to prepare for this.  I oiled my chain yesterday morning before going to work.  Today I pumped the tires up to 120psi to keep the rolling resistance as low as possible.  I gathered some food together.  This is what I'll be taking with me to eat:

32 Nature Valley sweet 'n' salty peanut granola bars (Fatty, have you ever tried these?  They're fantastic!  A staple when we go backwoods camping).  1kg of pepperettes.  The stuff that came in the swag bag.  A cannister of lemon/lime gatorade.  I'm going to have a bottle of gatorade with me, and a bottle of water.  I'll alternate drinking one of each.  I'll be able to refill the water, and mix more gatorade, while on my route, so that'll be pretty awesome.

I'm going to carry my emergency repair kit, with a set of allen keys, a couple of wrenches, a chain tool, tire patch kit, and small pump (that won't get up to 120PSI, I need my big floor pump for that).  I plan to repair anything that I can, if anything happens.  I don't want to get to 95 miles and have to stop because I run over a nail.

I'm also going to make damn sure to lather myself up with sunblock, and bring chapstick along with me.  I'm a pale, pale man.  When I first start wearing shorts after winter, the entire city populace needs to break out their sunglasses.  And I know just how uncomfortable chapped lips are when you don't have anything for them.  I spent a week in Killarney last year, portaging and camping, unable to smile because my lips would bleed if I did.  Man, those were some weird photographs.

The Plan:

I wanted to try to find an easy route to ride.  So, I went to my dad's school, planning to ride a loop from there to his childhood home and back.  After all, he had to walk uphill both ways, so if I just go in the opposite direction, it should be downhill both ways, right?  Turns out, though, there's been some seismological shifts or something since his childhood, because the whole route is pretty much level.

Instead, I plan to ride around Ring Road at the University of Waterloo.  It's a 2.6km (approx.) loop that goes around the majority of the campus.  It also has the benefit of going right past the Student Life Centre, which has water fountains and flush toilets inside.  I'm hoping that, since it's going to be Saturday, the traffic won't be very bad.  This route means going through two stop signs, but I'm pretty sure that I'll be able to ride through them without stopping.  The sight lines are very good.

In case traffic (automobile or pedestrian) is too heavy on Ring Road, or the cops object to me blowing through stop signs 120 times in one day, I can just head a little bit north to the Tech Park.  There's a medium-sized roundabout there that I can ride around and around and around, for 100 very boring miles.

For entertainment, I hope to be able to watch the student bodies, er, the student body.  That, and sing to myself.  Since I'm going to be in traffic, it won't be a good idea to wear headphones to listen to my iPod.  So, singing to myself and admiring the scenery is what will have to keep me occupied for the 6 to 8 hours that this ride is probably going to take me.

In terms of resting, I'm going to drink my water whenever I feel like it.  When that's empty, I'll drink gatorade whenever I feel like it.  When that's empty, I'll stop by the Student Life Centre, refill the bottles, stretch, and munch some granola bars and pepperettes.  I don't know how many breaks it's going to take to finish the 100 miles, so we'll just have to wait and see.

One thing I'm going to be consciously monitoring is my cadence.  With a recumbent bike, it's very important to keep the cadence up, to keep the stress on your knees down.  I'm aiming to stay over 90 RPM (my normal pedalling pace) for the entire duration.  If that means that by the end of the ride, I'm in my granny gear, well, so be it.

The Ride:

That was hard.  You know how some people say something was hard, and it doesn't really carry any weight?  Like, ""man, climbing those stairs was hard.""  Well, this was harder.  This was like, ""man, climbing those stairs to the 300th floor while carrying an 80lb bag of rice and being harried by rabid monkeys was hard.""  There were times where only pure determination allowed me to keep my cranks turning.  There were other, more frequent times when it was stubbornness.  And honestly, there were a few times when it was only momentum that kept me moving forwards.

The route choice was relatively good.  There was almost no traffic for the entire day, barring at around 12:30, when there was a flood of people attending a dance competition at the Humanities Theatre.  In fact, progress was impeded more by the campus geese than by anything else.

The weather, on the other hand, was much less good.  The ride started at 8:40am, with an overcast sky and light rain threatening.  By the time I made it the 3 kilometres to my loop, the rain had started.  I recall thinking about an hour in that the rain was letting up, but it wasn't ""letting up"" so much as ""saving up.""  That was about when the first torrential downpour of the day started.  So much rain that Noah pulled up alongside in his Ark and asked if I wanted a lift.  I thanked him, but informed him that not only was I in the middle of a bike race, I was winning!

About an hour later, the thunderstorms rolled in.  Fantastic, sky-spanning arcs of cyclist frying static discharges.  I tried counting the seconds between the lightning and thunder, to determine how close to being roasted I was, but there was just too much of it.  And more rain.  And I'm pretty sure some hail as well.  The thunderstorms were so intense that two separate events being held in local parks were cancelled.

Here's where I admit to hitting the first real low point of the ride.  40km in, soaked to the skin, cold, and facing very strong winds.  There's also a really long stretch of road between 25% done and 50% done, and I was staring right at the start of it.  But I kept turning those cranks.

By about km 70, the sun had come out again.  I wasn't dry, but at least I wasn't cold any more.  In addition, the pedestrians started coming out of the woodwork.  Having something new to look at, other than geese and puddles, really helped take my mind off the monotony of the ride.  And by km 80 I was either hitting my second wind, or I was slightly delerious.  Either way, it felt like I always had a tailwind for my uphill climbs, and my leg muscles weren't near as sore as they had been.  Hitting the halfway point in the ride was a real high, until I looked at my watch and realized that I had another 4 hours of riding to go.  I stopped looking at my watch after that.

I really started to hit a groove around then.  At that point, I had figured out some on-bike stretches that I could complete on the downhill portion of the lap to keep my butt from going numb (I guess that I didn't do enough recliner training) and keep the blood flowing to my toes.  The distance between rest stops increased to 16km, then 24, then 32.  Then I hit another wall.  Right around km 120, actually.  It felt like it took forever to get to the 75% mark.  The hills got steeper, the headwinds got stronger, and the tailwinds got weaker.

At 133km into the ride, my girlfriend pulled up alongside in her car.  It turns out, she was worried about me because of the thunderstorms (four hours previous), and had tried to find me sooner, but apparently I was on one of my rest stops.  She drove next to me for almost an entire lap, and I had the first conversation of the day.  When she asked if I needed anything, my reply was ""eggs - we've only got one at home, and we need more for eggs and Who.""  We have a tradition of eating eggs benedict while watching Doctor Who, you see, and we were out of eggs.

After that, the kilometres moved by at a steady, if not rapid, pace.  I could feel myself getting slower on each lap, but I could also see the end in sight.  By the time I hit 20km to go, I was counting them down individually.  I broke off from the loop with 3km left to go, and headed home.  The final odometer for the trip ticked in at 161.63km, or 100.43 miles.  We'll consider the extra 0.43 miles to be a victory lap.  My computer reported the time on the bike at 6h37, and my watch said it had taken me 7h40.  According to some online calculators, I burned between 6,500 and 8,500 calories.

The Aftermath:

It's very surprising how good you can feel on a bike, and how difficult it can be to walk once you get off of it.  When I got home, I had enough energy to have a shower and down some advil, then I fell into bed and slept for four straight hours.  Now, later in the evening, apart from a general sense of tiredness, it's only my butt muscles that are sore.  Recumbent cycling uses the glutes a lot more than upright, and it's painfully evident.

I think that pretty much wraps up this race report.  It was a great experience, and a wonderful personal challenge.  Right now I don't know if I'll be crazy enough to try it again next year, but I know in a week's time the memories of the boredom and pain will have faded, and I'll be enthusiastically signing up when the time comes.  Now it's time for me to roll off to bed, so I can be ready for a 15km hike on the Bruce Trail tomorrow morning.

PS - I don't know what flavour that DZ Nuts energy gel was supposed to be, but it sure wasn't nut flavour.  Also, it made my mouth feel all tingly.  Is that supposed to happen?

PPS - the official results are in from the judges, and I placed first in the men's 100kg+ recumbent all-weather division!  Go me!"

"event","Welcome to the fourth entry in the Bruce Trail End to End hike series!  This report is about 5 days late, since we went hiking last Sunday.  This time, we headed out to the Peninsula Club portion of the trail.  Our hike started just outside of Lion's Head, at the parking lot on Forty HIlls Rd.  We hit the main trail at km 87.7.  And continued on that trail all the way to km 99.6.

This was a beautiful hike, attended by <lj user=""dairymilk"">, little Minnie dog, J&B, and S.  And it was a long hike.  A very long hike.  We hit the trail at about 1pm, after doing the carpool setup, and didn't get off the trail for 5 1/2 hours.  The terrain here was very challenging, especially after the rain we'd had.  The rocks were quite slippery.  No injuries to the hikers, barring some blisters, and apparently, B needs to have his feet replaced now.

We were very fortunate, too, because even though we'd missed Beth's geography hike here the previous weekend, she had sent us the handout that talked about all of the different points of interest, and we followed it with interest.  The parking lot really is a spectacular example of an alvar.  The hike follows the top of the cliffs, and right here, the cliffs drop straight down to a small shelf, then look out over Georgian Bay.  And they drop a looooong way.  So, once the air started to clear, we could see a looong way out into the bay too :)

The wildflowers were going nuts beneath the trees.  Periwinkles in white and purple carpeted the forest floors, as did some late trilliums, and a few other flowers that we didn't recognize.  Lots of patches of wild leek too, so I got my fill of them :)  We took the side trail down to the shore at Reed's Dump too, and spent some time rock picking along the shore.  I found a nice lump of rock with some Halycite coral fossils in it, and we found a spiral shell fossil (some kind of nautiloid?) as well as some of the clams that are so abundant in the Fossil Hill formation.  I also now have enough information (thanks to Beth and her great hikes) to answer the question ""why is that rock blue?""  It's shale!  And to prove it, you can grind it with some of the dolostone, and see how easily it crumbles apart.  In fact, if you find a thin piece, you can actually snap it in your hands.

Bird sightings were abundant on this hike.  J & B were happy about that.  Hrm.  What do I remember.  They saw mergansers on Georgian Bay, as well as turkey vultures soaring in the updrafts in front of the cliffs.  And lots of smaller birds too.  For mammal sightings, we came across a porcupine in the middle of the trail.  I saw it, and Minnie did too.  I think <lj user=""dairymilk""> saw it.  S, with the camera out, was at the back of the line, and the porcupine had darted before she could get to the front.  We also saw a fresh pile of bear spoor, so we started singing loudly :)  And right near the end of the trail, there was the remains of another porcupine.  Nothing left except for bones and quills, really.  Later, someone told me that I should have picked up the quills, since they're useful for crafting, and can be expensive.  On the internets, it looks like you can get 50 of 'em for $5.  I don't think that's worth the potential piercing :)

We were all really wiped by the end of the hike.  Minnie slept the whole way home, and for the next two days as well.  Dinner in Owen Sound, and we were back home just in time to go to bed.  A great hike, and another section of trail knocked off.

"event","And now for the third in our series of Bruce Trail end-to-end hike reports.  For this hike, we drove to Waterdown.  Our hike started in the Iroquoia section, km 70.8, at Waterdown Road, and went all the way to km 62.5 (almost) at Patterson Road.  <lj user=""dairymilk""> and I were not alone on this hike.  There were ten of us in total, most from K-W, trudging through the rain.

The trail was awfully muddy, but I had my hiking boots on, so my feet stayed dry.  I think I was one of the only people that had dry feet by the end of it, though.  The rain was fairly light until the very end of the hike.

The trail itself was very beautiful.  Steep hills, rushing streams, mossy rocks in valleys, and rain.  The rain had knocked most of the blossoms off of the wildflowers.  The only thing still holding on were the triliums.  Nowhere near as many as I'm used to from Eastern Ontario, but apparently a whole bunch for out here.

We managed to set up a car relay for this hike, so we were able to go one-way on the trail.  It meant that four of us were left standing in the rain (with poor Minnie) waiting for the drivers to return.  We spent the time singing camp songs from our youth.  What fun!

"event","It's been a long time since the first one of these, but it's been winter, I guess.  Now that spring has officially hit, the end-to-end hiking of the Bruce Trail has begin in earnest by <lj user=""dairymilk""> and I.

Last weekend we were fortunate enough to be led on a geology hike by Beth (checks internets) Kummling, the Executive Director of the Bruce Trail Conservancy.  The entire hiking group consisted of about forty people.  Our hike started in the Sydenham Club section, at km 116.7 off of East Linton Side Road, and continued to km 127.1, at Lindenwood Road. (26th edition of the Bruce Trail reference)

Being a geology hike, Beth had prepared handouts describing the different layers that we would be hiking through.  What do I remember?  Not too much.  The capstone of the escarpment is made of dolostone - limestone with magnesium in it as well.  Underneath that is a layer of very red shale, due to high iron content.  The topmost layer of the dolostone is called the ""Amabel formation.""  Underneath that is the fossil hill formation, also dolostone, but deposited during a geological time period when the sea was shallow, calm, and sunny, so it's absolutely chock-full of fossils.  Most common were tabulate corals.  We also saw halysite coral, that looks like chains made of many links.  And in these particular rock, many many many pentapod fossils (clams, really).  At one point, we found a mystery fossil, that we thought (after checking the books back at the car) was a cephalopod.

One of the really cool things about the dolostone that was made very evident is how it is made up of dolomite crystals.  The rock fractures along lines that mimic the crystal structure of dolomite.  Dolomite forms as rhombic crystals with angles of 75 and 105 degrees.  There was one point on the trail where two fissures intersected at 75/105 degrees, and the downhill chunk had slid on the shale underneath a good 15 feet away from the rest of the cliff.

We were also very fortunate to be hiking right in the peak of spring wildflower season.  The trout lilies were out in force, as were the red triliums (but not the white ones yet).  We also saw, er, other flowers.  Um, something breeches, and something closely related to that, but heart shaped.  Dang, I suck at remembering things.

Wild leeks were super-abundant on this particular hike, and I ate one bajillion of them.  There was one woman who complained about the smell after I ate them.  M'oh well.  They were delicious.  And the wild ginger smelled great, but I certainly didn't try eating any of them.

"event","Dear Senators,

You are all now doubtlessly aware of the results of Election 41 in this country of ours.  The Conservatives now hold a majority of the seats in the House of Commons.  With their party whips, this means that they can pass any bill that they propose.

A lot of their election platform frightens and dismays me.  Superprisons, US-style copyright reform, blocking generic drugs for third world countries -- all of these are policies that I disagree heartily with, and can logically debate how they are unnecessary or even harmful.

The Senate in this country is supposed to be a bastion of sober second thought.  With a Conservative majority in the house, your job is now more important than ever.  Putting aside all question of Senate reform, I ask you to step up to the plate.  Please, perform the duties that the Canadian public expects of you.  Look at each bill that's tabled in a critical light.  Analyze it for its strengths and weaknesses.  Analyze the costs and benefits.  Please, determine if the bills actually deserve to be passed.  And if they don't, do not be shy about giving the House of Commons that message.  You have the power to stop inappropriate, unconstitutional, and ill-advised bills.  When you see one come across your desk, please use it.

Sincerely,

"event","To all Conservative MPs,

Firstly, congratulations on your win.  Though I am disappointed in the result, I must commend you all on a finely run campaign.  Unfortunately, I am concerned that with a majority in the House of Commons, there will not be anything to moderate the CPC's legislation.  It's a difficult thing to ask, but I have to ask you to be the moderating voices for your party.

I remind you all that you are first and foremost representatives of your local ridings.  In many cases, your constituents almost overwhelmingly voted for candidates that were more progressive than the CPC.  These are the people that you are representing, so please try to remember them when it comes time to vote in the House.

This coming parliamentary session will doubtlessly see many controversial bills up for vote.  And I'm sure it's also going to see the CPC whips working overtime to ensure they pass.  Please read the bills.  Please think about them.  Think about what's being used to justify the bills.  Think about whether or not those bills will be best for Canada.  And don't be cowed into toeing the party line by the threats that the party whips hold over you.

Don't be afraid to vote your conscience.  Because your conscience is what is now governing this great country of ours.  All of our hopes and fears now rest in your hands.

Sincerely,

"event","Dear opposition MPs,

Every non-CPC person in this country has just suffered a crushing defeat.  Because of the idiosyncracies of our First-Past-the-Post voting system, we now have a majority Conservative government, elected by only 40% of the voters.

When facing a majority government, unfortunately, there is not much that an opposition party can do other than talk.  As long as the CPC whips do their job (and, I assure you, they will), any bill that Stephen Harper wants passed will pass in the House.  However, I still plead for you to do the best you can for this country.  I'm going to make three requests of you:

1. Don't let Harper pull the wool over our eyes.  In the past couple of years, the minority Conservative government has done as much as it can in secret.  We cannot let this continue.  Please, use your parliamentary privilege to discover what they're doing.  And please, release this information to the press as publicly as possible.  With the CPC wish to eliminate the press gallery, and with Harper's reluctance, nay, refusal to answer tough questions from the media, it's up to our opposition to keep the Canadian public informed.

2. Don't roll over.  Even though a bill that comes to a vote can be passed by the CPC whips, there are things that you can do before the bill gets to a vote.  Debate furiously.  Debate logically.  Debate publicly.  Let the Canadian public know what's wrong with each of the bills, why you disagree with them, and how they could be made better.  And, for particularly onerous legislation, please don't be afraid to filibuster.

3. Be there.  Historically, votes in the House of Commons have an absenteeism rate of 20-50 MPs.  If there are zero opposition MPs absent, it only takes 28 CPC members absent or abstaining to defeat a bill.  Please make every effort to be in attendance for every vote.  I am positive that such a voting record will put you in a favourable light amongst your constituents in four years, when we have another chance at the polls.

I implore you all to stand strong and stand together for this country.

"event","Idle pondering today.  When the Conservative Party of Canada phones me up and asks if they can count on my vote on May 2nd, my twitch-response is ""Absolutely you can count on my vote . . . to go to the person most likely to defeat your local talking-point-spewing robot.""

But, would it be more advantageous to me to lie to them?  To tell them that I fully intend to vote for them?

What are these poll numbers used for?  Within the Conservative riding headquarters, there are people that are trying to use them for something.  What are they using them for?  Are they using them to decide where to focus their dollars?  Their time?  If that's the case, wouldn't feeding them misinformation be to my benefit, as it would throw off their predictions, and lead them to spend their time and money in less efficient ways?  Maybe I should say I'm undecided, so that they focus more of their campaigning on me and people like me.  People who have strongly decided _not_ to vote Conservative.

My boss actually made the comment (after a discussion about the election during a lunchtime walk) that if Peter Braid came to my door, I should invite him in, all friendly-like, offer him tea, and talk to him jovially for as long as I possibly could.  Nothing he could say would swing my vote over to the Right, and by monopolizing his time, I'm reducing the number of undecideds that he could sway.

It's pretty easy to decide how to vote strategically.  Should the ""anyone but Harper"" crowd be campaigning strategically as well?  Or, well, whatever the verb is for being on the receiving end of a campaign.?  Are there any downsides to these tactics?  Would too much apparent support for the Conservatives lead other parties to declare this region a lost cause, and put their campaign dollars elsewhere?"

Subject: How many times must you be told that LRT is the correct solution?

Dear Regional Councillors, City Mayors and Township Mayors,

The Thursday edition of The Record has a disturbing article in it.  It states that you are all still trying to gauge if there's support for light-rail transit.  The article is available online here:

http://www.therecord.com/news/local/article/517072--councillors-still-trying-to-gauge-if-there-s-support-for-light-rail-transit

The article has some quotes from some of you in it.  For instance, Mayor Halloran is quoted as saying that she has ""heard from thousands of taxpayers who are very concerned and are opposed to the system.""  Also, Councillor Strickland has indicated that in the past two days, he has received a total of nine emails opposing the plans for LRT.

If phone calls and a grand total of nine emails is enough to sway your opinion, I would like to try to influence you as well.  Please count this as one email, and one taxpayer, who is strongly in support of LRT.

I would hope that you are all well-informed enough on this subject that I don't have to repeat all of the information that is available to you in multiple reports, but here it is anyway, just as a reminder:

o The original rapid transit plan recommended LRT from Conestoga Mall to Fairview Park Mall as the optimum solution for our region.
o Several of you were elected at least partially on your support for rapid transit.  I know that for many of my friends, the past regional election was a single-issue election, where choices were made solely on support of rapid transit.
o Public consultations were held, and at those consultations, a MASSIVE 78% of attendees supported rapid transit, and 66% supported LRT in particular
o A report was issued, directed towards the council, recommending the preliminary preferred option for rapid transit implementation.  This report examined public support of the issue, as well as the financial implications involved.  In a huge non-surprise, it recommends almost exactly the same plan as originally recommended - LRT from Conestoga Mall to Fairview Park Mall, with aBRT continuing down to Ainsle Street in Cambridge.
o For constituents that call you concerned about the cost of this system, I suggest that you point out the following: 
	1. The recommended LRT solution will cost the region approximately $395M
	2. Implementing no rapid tranist options will result in the need for more roads, to the cost of $500M
	3. Implementing BRT will cost the region approximately $168M, but the system is projected to require replacement in only 20 years.
o All of these reports have undergone extensive peer review, and all of the qualified reviewers have agreed with the conclusions.

One of the benefits of our system of government is that, ostensibly, it is supposed to prevent the tragedy of the commons.  You are supposed to be taking into account not only the current desires of your constituents, but also their future well-being.  You are supposed to be more well-informed on these issues than your constituents, and this is supposed to allow you to make a better choice.  All of the information at your disposal states that LRT is the best choice for our region.  What do I have to do to make you listen to all of that information, rather than to the small handfull of naysayers who object to a tiny property tax increase in order to prevent urban sprawl, gridlock, and larger property tax increases in the future?

Thank you for your time,

-P. Bike

"event","Peter,

While I respect your attempt to be more responsive to your constituents' voices, I feel that the way you went about arranging for your telephone town hall last night was ill-advised.

First of all, if there's one thing that most people dislike more than telemarketers calling during their dinner, it's when those telemarketers happen to be using a robo-caller.

Secondly, if you want me to actually contribute to the town hall, I would appreciate knowing about it in advance so that I can prepare.  What would you do if someone called your house right now and asked you to comment on your vehicle insurance?  Would you be able to formulate your thoughts & concerns about it on the spot?

I assume that because I have communicated with you in the past through email that you have my address on file.  Perhaps it's even in a folder labelled ""constituents that took the time to speak to me about something, and who clearly care about political issues.""  I suggest that next time you arrange one of these meetings, a quick email to all the people in that folder would cost you almost nothing, and allow you to issue a proposed agenda to all those concerned citizens, allowing them time to prepare.

"event","Welcome to the first of doubtless many entries that will attempt to document the efforts of <lj user=""dairymilk""> & me, as we attempt to hike every kilometre of the Bruce Trail within 365 days.

<lj-cut text=""Hike Description Inside"">This Sunday was a great day for an outdoor hike.  Lots of sun, a bit chilly, mostly-fresh snow everywhere.  We piled into a pair of cars along with <lj user=""westacular"">, <lj user=""pundigrion"">, <lj user=""mooseb0y"">, S, and J.  Leaving K-W at 10am, we got to Mono Centre shortly before noon and parked in the Community Centre, where we met up with (another) S and A, and their two jack russels terriers in hilarious winter coats and booties. Our goal for the day - the Bruce Trail section that goes through Mono Cliffs Provincial Park.

The trail crosses the road about 50 metres from Mono Cliffs Inn, diving into the park.  It is used (along with various side trails and park trails) by many cross-country skiers and snowshoers.  Thanks to this, the trail was pretty well packed, if single-file.  Us lowly hikers were treated to good footing and no sinking into the deep snow that abounded.

Our hike took us over the crests of windswept hills, through snow-filled hardwood forests, and past the picturesquely frozen McCarston's Lake.  The sky was very clear, and the snowy valleys that we hiked around were particularly beautiful in the early afternoon sun.  After about 90 minutes of hiking, we exited the park and left the nicely packed ski trails behind.  Luckily, the snow was nice and fluffy, and I had my gaiters on, so I was able to wade through the shin-deep accumulation without much trouble.  It was certainly much more tiring than hiking on the hard-packed trails, but it at least it was downhill!

At the bottom of the ungroomed hill, we met up with a series of snowmobile trails.  The majority of the group elected to take a break while <lj user=""dairymilk"">, A & I continued to our projected endpoint.  It did not take long for us to get to 1st Line E, where the Trail continues along the road.  Doing so allows us to park right at that dead end in order to continue our trek next time, with no backtracking.

For the route home, half the group elected to head South to link up with the other end of 1st Line E, then take roads back to Mono Centre.  <lj user=""dairymilk"">, J, A & S & their dogs and I all went back through the park.  Rather than following the Bruce Trail all the way back (the way out took us just over 2 hours), we took some of the route-shortening link trails and made it back to Mono Centre in just under an hour, five minutes faster than the group that elected to take the roads :)  The dogs were too tired to walk back, so one went into A's coat, and the other got put in my backpack.

As a side note, Mono Centre was holding their Winterfest on Sunday!  We celebrated with free apple cider, and, a special treat for <lj user=""dairymilk"">, a horse-drawn sleigh ride!  Then, we went to Mono Cliffs Inn for dinner/lunch, it being 3:30, and most people not having had a meal since breakfast.  Decent food, if a bit pricey.  It's definitely an upscale joint.  At least, the restaurant upstairs is.  The pub downstairs was way to packed for the nine of us to pile in.

"event","I've been working on my Elemental Arcane Spells.  So far, I've developed the following innovations:

<b>Summon Snowstorm</b>
Material Components: snow shovel, friends that are traveling to a warm location (note, components are not consumed in casting this spell, so they can be considered talismans for this purpose).
Verbal Component: roughly translated into Common, the phrase ""Sure, I can make sure your walk is shoveled while you're away.""
Effects: A medium-sized snowstorm coats the ground in 2d4 inches of powder.  Creatures caught in this effect suffer 1d6 cold damage.

Note: The duration and damage of this spell can be doubled by adding the verbal component ""Besides, we haven't really had much snow this year anyway.""

<b>David's Continuing Snowfall</b>
Somatic Component: complete the shoveling of two houses worth of sidewalk
Verbal Component: again, a rough translation into Common: ""There.  That's done.""
Effects: the skies open again and deposit an additional 2d4 inches of powder.  Creatures caught in this effect suffer 1d6 cold damage.  Caster suffers 1d4 frustration damage.

Note: Further experimentation is necessary to determine if shoveling a single sidewalk is sufficient for the somatic component of this spell.  Important to recognize that using a snowblower, or a fire-based spell such as <i>Wall of Fire</i> is not sufficient.  Study indicates that paying a neighbourhood child should be sufficient.

<b>Unseasonably Warm Spell</b>
Somatic Component: travel to a warm locale
Verbal Component: again a rough translation into Common: ""Hey, if you keep my walk shoveled while I'm away, we'll call it even.""
Effects: Within 1 day of departure, the temperature will rise above the freezing point of water (or whatever liquid local life is based on) and any accumulated frozen precipitation will re-liquify.  Radiation levels of local celestial bodies will increase for a period of 2d4 days, resulting in increased happiness for all non-travelers.  Caster takes 2d6 frustration damage upon return from travel.

Note: Further testing of this Spell is required, but the effects have been extrapolated from the General Perversity of the Universe factor."

"event","Or, at least, so James Moore feels, and has said.  The ""Honourable"" James Moore has termed me a radical extremist, as I seek to oppose certain provisions within Bill C-32.  (ref: http://money.canoe.ca/money/business/international/archives/2010/06/20100622-145853.html).  Now, either this is slander, and I, along with the thousands of other Canadians who have spoken up against provisions in this bill deserve an apology and a retraction from Moore, or it is true, and I can expect a knock on the door from the RCMP sometime soon.  Which will it be?

To reiterate on previous communications with all of you, I feel that Bill C-32 is _almost_ a good compromise between the rights of content creators and consumers.  Unfortunately, the sections on Technological Protection Measures, as they are currently written, trump any other section of the Bill.  If any copyrighted work has any TPM on it, the proposed bill would make it illegal to circumvent that TPM, even for purposes expressly listed in the fair dealing section of the bill.

The Canadian government, and I'm sure Moore in particular, has doubtless received thousands of communications about this particular clause within the Bill.  It also featured heavily in the copyright consultation recently held (and largely ignored) by the government.  What have you to say about that?  Are we a democratic nation?  Does the government even pretend to respond to the will of the people, or is it just a collection of corporate shills, kowtowing to the wishes of American media conglomerates?

I understand that the section on TPMs is an attempt to fulfill our requirements under the WIPO Internet Treaties.  However, these obligations can be fulfilled without such draconian, and, let's face it, ridiculous measures.  The WIPO Internet Treaties require legal status for technological protections, but many groups have confirmed that there is enough flexibility that simply stating circumventing TPMs for the purposes of copyright infringement is illegal would be sufficient.  There is no onus to prevent the distribution of devices which can circumvent TPMs, or to prevent people from offering their services in circumventing TPMs.

In summary, here I sit in my home, waiting for one of two things.  Perhaps I'm going to be arrested as a radical extremist.  Or perhaps I will get an apology from Moore, and my government will actually start listening to what I, and thousands of my countrymen, are trying to tell it.

I am a cheap bastard.  And I want to listen to music at work.  I have (nearly) full access to this wonderful data repository call ""the Internet.""  The Internet is a series of tubes that can deliver content directly to my desk, unless the tubes get clogged (or contain pornography, but that's more a function of the gatekeeper to our LAN.

Anyway, the salient points here are:

o I want to listen to music at work
o I'm a cheap bastard

Are there any ad-supported sites similar to <a href=http:\\www.last.fm>last.fm</a> where you can automagically build a library of songs you like as you listen to them?  Failing that, are there any good internet radio stations that are free to listen?

I disagree with the Executive Director of the Toronto Cyclists Union.

Her position is that bicycles are better than cars because (among other things) they don't get stuck in traffic.  Also, that dedicated bike lanes are the optimum solution to get more cyclists on the road and make them feel more comfortable.

Number one, if a cyclist in heavy traffic is not being slowed down by the heavy traffic, that means they are travelling faster than the traffic, between cars that are stopped.  The most common form of this is bikes travelling up the right hand side of the road, beside a lineup of cars stopped at a red light.

To me, this is an especially bad idea, as the number of motorists that actually perform a shoulder check every time before turning right can probably be counted on the fingers of a leper.  Seriously.  I drive cars as well, and I know that I don't shoulder-check before turning right, unless I've passed a cyclist or jogger on the sidewalk, and know that they are there and travelling at higher speeds than a walker.

My personal opinion is that a cyclist is safest when they (as much as possible) act just like a car.  Yes, a cyclist is more manoeverable than a car.  Yes, they can hop onto the sidewalk to get around obstacles (sometimes).  However, a cyclist can only avoid obstacles that they recognize.  By riding in a predictable manner, motorists that the cyclist does not see (on side streets, or behind them, or wherever) can more accurately predict what the cyclist will do.  This is the number one reason to ride on the road, in a lane of traffic, with traffic.

Two - she feels that dedicated bike lanes are the best way to make cyclists more comfortable on the road, and to increase bike ridership.  This may be true, but I feel less safe riding in a bike lane.  The top three collision situations between adult cyclists and automobiles in cities are:
1. motorists turning left
2. signal lights changing (running lights?)
3. motorists turning right

My opinion is that a cyclist in a bike lane is something that is easier for a motorist to ignore.  They don't have to take any special action in order to pass the cyclist, so the cyclists are less prominent in their sphere of consciousness, and more likely to be right-hooked.

In addition, my experience with bike lanes is that their maintenance is terrible.  Almost universally in this city, bike lanes are full of storm drains, potholes, loose gravel, and broken glass.  I wouldn't ride in them even if it was the law that I had to.  And many motorists believe that, according to the law, it is mandated that I ride in the bike lanes.  This is far from the truth.  The actual wording of the Highway Traffic Act is that a cyclist should ride as far to the right ""as practical.""  The MTO website, though, notes that a cyclist is entitled to as much of any lane of traffic as <b>the cyclist</b> deems necessary.  And notes that under no circumstances should a cyclist sacrifice their own safety for the convenience of a motorist behind them.

I will admit that it takes a lot of chutzpah to get a bike into the middle of a lane in a heavily-trafficked road.  And I will admit that having a space designated as exclusively for cyclists will make novice riders more comfortable.  I just worry that said novice cyclists in said designated lanes will lead to more collisions.  Ideally, I would like to see a significant amount of education, of both motorists and cyclists, to facilitate more reasonable road use by both parties."

Some of you may remember my new tires.  20 x 1.125, rated for 125PSI.  These are the tires that I was unable to use for months because Braun's kept giving me tubes that were too long for them.  I finally did get an appropriately sized pair of tubes, but it was at the end of the season, so this week is the first time I've ridden on them.

And, as per the title, they feel freaking awesome.  Skinny, rock-hard tires like those, and I feel like I could coast forever.  When I get to work, I usually coast circles in the parking lot to kill speed, mostly to cool down and rest, but I figure it saves wear and tear on my brake pads too.  This morning?  I was circling for what seemed like 60 seconds.  Around and around and around and around and around and I'm not slowing down yet and around and around . . .

Leeks wrapped in ham, drenched in a rich cream sauce, covered with melted smoked gruyere.

The on-hand ingredients:

leeks (chopped into bite-sized bits)
potatoes (ditto on the chopping, skins on)
butter
flour
swiss cheese
vegetarian chicken broth
liquid smoke
wine vinegar
sour cream
salt & pepper to taste

The approach:

boil the leeks & potatoes (separately) until they are cooked.  In salted water.  Use the butter and flour to make a roux.  Add the chicken broth to the roux to make gravy.  Put the liquid smoke into the gravy, along with some sour cream to make it richer.  Add wine vinegar, salt, and pepper to taste.  Toss everything in an oven-safe casserole.  Top with cheese.  Bake until cheese is melty, house smells like a campfire, and you're too hungry to wait any more.

The results:

Too much gravy made for a more soup-like experience.  But, it's strangely pleasant.  Probably too heavy on the smoke this time.  Really tasted like it could use some bacon.  Deferred on account of a vegetarian spouse."

<lj-cut text = ""click here if bored or if a heavy Linux user"">So, for the past couple of months, we've been having trouble with our OLPC.  It uses a membrane-style keyboard, there is a fairly common problem of keys ""sticking"" because the membrane is too thin.  This is most common with the left Alt and Ctrl keys.

Using diagnostics tools available on the OLPC, I have confirmed that my left Ctrl and Alt keys are flakey, sometimes stuck on, sometimes flickering, sometimes not responing to keypresses.

The OLPC wiki has helpful hints on a hardware fix for it (open up the laptop and add strips of packing tape to effectively make the membrane thicker), but before potentially destroying the little thing, I decided to try their software fix first.

The software fix is essentially to unmap the left Ctrl and Alt keys using xmodmap statements in .xsession.  I added the following lines to my .xsession file:

xmodmap -e ""remove modl = Alt_L""
xmodmap -e ""keycode 64 =""
xmodmap -e ""remove modl = Control_L""
xmodmap -e ""keycode 37 =""

and this has, in fact, unmapped the left Ctrl and Alt keys.

Unfortunately, there's only one Ctrl key on the keyboard, and I would like to occasionally use it for things (copy-paste, for example).  Now, there is a hand key on the left side of the keyboard, and I tried to re-map that using the following lines:

xmodmap -e ""keycode 133 = Control_L""
xmodmap -e ""add modl Control_L""

but this does not make the hand key function as a Ctrl key.  I did use xev to verify that the hand key does trigger keycode 133.

Anyone have any ideas why my remapping of the hand key isn't working?"

Dear drivers.  Please take note.  Should you yell at me out of the window of your vehicle as you pass, blare your horn, or do anything else which leads me to believe that you are upset with me and that is affecting your actions, I shall follow you long enough to make note of your license plate, and then phone the police.  The police will then phone you, and inform you that yes, bicycles are allowed to drive on city streets.  And yes, they are entitled to an entire lane should <b>they</b> deem it necessary for their safety.  Oh, and there will be an official police report of your road rage in existence, which may or may not influence such items as: insurance rates, culpability in later accidents, etc.

Last night someone in a giant black SUV told me to ""get the f@#k off the road"" as I was traveling southbound on Weber near Bridgeport.  They then turned into a tiny subdivision.  As I followed, they sped off in a completely different direction.  Recognizing the size of the subdivision they turned into, I headed back there, and got there in time to see them pulling into their driveway.  Real smart.

Anyway, I recorded their license plate number, called the cops at home, and (after being transferred five times - you want to get to division 3 dispatch to make a road rage report) told them what happened.  Later that night, I got a call from a constable saying that he'd talked to the registered owner of the vehicle about his actions.

Why the fuck are these things allowed on the road?  If I owned a car that sounded like that, the cops would take away my license, and impound my car.  When the bikes are loud enough to cause physical pain to my ears from 15 feet away, there is a distinct problem.  Christ, ten minutes after they'd passed me on King street (I was walking the dog) I could still hear the damn things tearing up the road.

What kind of shithead thinks they need to blast a racket at 210dB to be cool?  And yes, they did think they were cool.  The bikes were all shined up and chromed, and covered in blue LEDs.  Seriously.  You'd think, too, if they took that kind of effort to make their bike look pretty, they'd spend at least a bit of time on making sure it was running properly, too.  Nope.  One of them was running so rich, I could smell the uncombusted gasoline coming out of the exhaust from half a block away.  Tune your fucking carburetor, you poncey git.

Ricers who put fart-mufflers on their cars are under high suspicion of street-racing, and you can bet that if they get in an accident or stopped by the cops, the fact that they've got a modded car is going to weigh heavily against them.  Why is it appropriate for a company to design a motorbike that is loud enough to cause physical pain?"

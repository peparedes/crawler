<img src=""http://www.platinumprodukshunz.com/files/LiveJournal/pinklivejournal2005.JPG"">
<b>::.muahs!!.::</b></center> there ya go... 
and tony.. I <b>don't</b> want to hear it busta!! <img src=""http://www.clicksmilies.com/s0105/aetsch/cheeky-smiley-018.gif"">

anyway....
For some reason I'm feeling hyper <img src=""http://www.clicksmilies.com/s0105/sprachlos/speechless-smiley-022.gif""> as hell right now. I was almost dieing of sleep <img src=""http://www.clicksmilies.com/s0105/spezial/Fool/mog.gif""> at work today but now I can't sleep!! <img src=""http://www.clicksmilies.com/s0105/spezial/Fool/wht.gif"">


OoOh.. I went and saw <b>Coach Carter</b> last week. <img src=""http://www.clicksmilies.com/s0105/spezial/Fool/popc.gif""> I liked it.. dunno why so many people hate it. I have to admit.. never thought I would say this.. but that white kid was kinda cute <img src=""http://www.clicksmilies.com/s0105/grinser/grinning-smiley-003.gif"">.. he <b>must</b> be mixed!! LOL And since when did the kid from One on One get a body like that? <img src=""http://www.clicksmilies.com/s0105/sprachlos/speechless-smiley-020.gif""> NICE!! So anyway.. the movie.. I like it except for Ashanti.. I'm not ""hating"" on the girl.. she wasn't bad.. I just didn't really see a reason for her in the movie.. and I <b>really</b> didn't like the whole abortion issue.. but whatever.. it is based on a true story so they did what they had to do..

One of the previews I saw when I went to the theaters was the preview for the next XXX movie.. and <b>NO</b> not a XXX rated movie, I'm talking about the next Triple X Movie. I was disappointed when I heard Vin Diesel wasn't in it but Ice Cube looked like he did a good job.. and he brought a lil westcoast flavor to the movie.. <b>plus</b>  I  <img src=""http://www.clicksmilies.com/s0105/liebe/love-smiley-009.gif"">  Ice Cube! Now I have to go see <b>Are We There Yet</b>.

OoOoOh.. I also saw the previews for Vin Diesels movie.. <b>Pacifier</b> <img src=""http://www.clicksmilies.com/s0105/spezial/Fool/ma.gif"">.. that shish looked funny as hell!! <img src=""http://www.clicksmilies.com/s0105/lachen/laughing-smiley-001.gif"">

hmmm.. I have sOo much to say but I must go now.. <b>PEACE</b>!!

<CENTER><h2>HAPPY NEW YEAR PEOPLE!!!!!!!</h2> 
i hope all you bustas brought in the new year safely!!</center>


im sittin here listenin Mario's song.. is it just me or does Mario look like a young version of Chris Rock? <img src=""http://www.click-smilies.de/sammlung0304/grinser/grinning-smiley-018.gif""> LOL serio..

aight, i'm not about to sit here and summarize all that's happened these past months.. so lets forward and pause at the present. so much is on my mind right about now <img src=""http://www.click-smilies.de/sammlung0304/spezial/Fool/wht.gif"">.. the main thing is <b>guys</b>.. what else! I feel like im stuck between a rock and a hard place ya know? lets break it down..

There are these three guys.. lets call them <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, and <b>C</b>. 

<b>A</b> & <b>B</b> are best friends who grew up together and i've known them for about 4-5 years. 

<b>A</b> & <b>B</b> have known <b>C</b> for about 3 years. 

I've known <b>C</b> for 2 months. 

Ever since I've known <b>A</b> he has always told me how much he likes me and how I should give him a chance.. I would.. except he has a girl.. whom he has always said he would drop for me lol thats some sad shish. 

Last week <b>C</b> came up to me saying he wants to get to know me better and start dating.. the thing is <b>C</b> is pretty shy and never really said much before this day so I really don't know much about him.. so I decided to go to <b>B</b> to see what he thought about me and <b>C</b> going out. The reason I went to <b>B</b> is because I thought that <b>A</b> would just try to make <b>C</b> look bad since <b>he</b> has been tryin to get at me for 5 years lol. so anyway.. I was over <b>B</b> place tonight and when I told him about <b>C</b> he looked a lil upset and didnt say anything. after what seemed to be 4546764614687 minutes of silence I asked wtf was the problem. he said he was pissed at the thought that I would go out with <b>C</b> before ever going out with him.. I was like <b>WTF where did this come from?!</b>. come to find out <b>B</b> has had a crush on me forever but never said anything since his best friend <b>A</b> was always trying to hook up with me. now I have no idea what to do.. <b>B</b> is mad sweet.. he has always been there for me.. we have <b>a lot</b> in common.. <b>BUT</b> he feels uncomfortable because of <b>A</b>.. then theres <b>C</b> who is shy as hell but had the guts to approach me. WTF should i do.. <img src=""http://www.click-smilies.de/sammlung0304/spezial/Fool/obm.gif"">

anyway.. time to go.. </font>

1) A kindergarten pupil told his teacher he'd found a cat, but it was dead. ""How do you know that the cat was dead?"" she asked her pupil. ""Because I pissed in its ear and it didn't move."" answered the child innocently. ""You did WHAT?"" the teacher exclaimed in surprise. ""You know,"" explained the boy, ""I leaned over and went 'Pssssssst!' and it didn't move.""
<center><img src=""http://www.click-smilies.de/sammlung0903/spezial/Fool/burr.gif""></center>
2) A small boy is sent to bed by his father. Five minutes later..... ""Da-ad..."" ""What?"" ""I'm thirsty. Can you bring me a drink of water?"" ""No, You had your chance. Lights out."" Five minutes later: ""Da-aaaaad...."" ""WHAT?"" ""I'm THIRSTY. Can I have a drink of water??"" ""I told you NO! If you ask again, I'll have to spank you!!"" Five minutes later... ""Daaaaa-aaaaaaad..."" ""WHAT!"" ""When you come in to spank me, can you bring me a drink of water?""
<center><img src=""http://www.click-smilies.de/sammlung0903/spezial/Fool/nunu.gif""></center>
3) An exasperated mother, whose son was always getting into mischief, finally asked him ""How do you expect to get into Heaven?"" The boy thought it over and said, ""Well, I'll run in and out and in and out and keep slamming the door until St. Peter says, 'For Heaven's sake, Dylan, come in or stay out!'""
<center><img src=""http://www.click-smilies.de/sammlung0903/spezial/Fool/daz.gif""></center>
4) One summer evening during a violent thunderstorm a mother was tucking her son into bed. She was about to turn off the light when he asked with a tremor in his voice, ""Mommy, will you sleep with me tonight?"" The mother smiled and gave him a reassuring hug. ""I can't dear,"" she said. ""I have to sleep in Daddy's room."" A long silence was broken at last by his shaky little voice: ""The big sissy.""

5) It was that time, during the Sunday morning service, for the children's sermon. all the children were invited to come forward. One little girl was wearing a particularly pretty dress and , as she sat down, the pastor leaned over and said, ""That is a very pretty dress. Is it your Easter Dress?"" the little girl replied, directly into the pastor's clip on microphone, ""Yes, and my Mom says it's a bitch to iron.""

6) When I was six months pregnant with my third child, my three year old came into the room when I was getting ready to get into the shower. She said, ""Mommy, you are getting fat!"" I replied, ""Yes honey, remember Mommy has a baby growing in her tummy."" ""I know,"" she replied, ""but what's growing in your butt?""

7) A little boy was doing his math homework. He said to himself, ""Two plus five, that son of a bitch is seven. three plus six, that son of a bitch is nine..."" His mother heard what he was saying and gasped, ""What are you doing?"" The little boy answered, ""I'm doing my math homework, Mom."" ""And this is how your teacher taught you to do it?"" the mother asked. ""Yes,"" he answered. Infuriated, the mother asked the teacher the next day, ""What are you teaching my son in math?"" The teacher replied, ""Right now, we are learning addition."" The mother asked, ""And are you teaching them to say two plus two, that son of a bitch is four?"" After the teacher stopped laughing, she answered, ""What I taught them was, two plus two, THE SUM OF WHICH, is four.""

8) One day the first grade teacher was reading the story of Chicken Little to her class. She came to the part of the story where Chicken Little tried to warn the farmer. She read, ""...and so the Chicken Little went up to the farmer and said, 'The sky is falling, the sky is falling!'"" The teacher paused then asked the class, ""And what do you think that farmer said?"" One little girl raised her hand and said, ""I think he said: 'Holy Shit! A talking chicken!'"" The teacher was unable to teach for the next 10 minutes.

9) A certain little girl, when asked her name, would reply, ""I'm Mr. Sugarbrown's daughter."" Her mother told her this was wrong, she must say, ""I'm Jane Sugarbrown."" The Vicar spoke to her in Sunday School, and said, ""Aren't you Mr. Sugarbrown's daughter?"" She replied, ""I thought I was, but my mother says I'm not.""
<center><img src=""http://www.click-smilies.de/sammlung0903/spezial/Fool/wht.gif""></center>
10) A little girl asked her mother, ""Can I go outside and play with the boys?"" Her mother replied, ""No, you can't play with the boys, they're too rough."" The little girl thought about it for a few moments and asked, ""If I can find a smooth one, can I play with him?""

11) A little girl goes to the barber shop with her father. She stands next to the barber chair, while her dad gets his hair cut, eating a snack cake. The barber says to her, ""Sweetheart, you're gonna get hair on your Twinkie."" She says, ""Yes, I know, and I'm gonna get boobs too.""

so anyway.. it' 3:35am and I'm awake.. just reading my notes on MiGente.. (by the way.. if you're not a member of migente yet.. here you go:

...let them know guera sent you.. <img src=""http://www.click-smilies.de/sammlung0903/grinser/grinning-smiley-003.gif"">) 

migente is pure comedy.. you get notes from complete strangers confessing their love for you just because they read your page and saw your pics <img src=""http://www.click-smilies.de/sammlung0903/lachen/laughing-smiley-017.gif"">.. unbelievable. then you get one word notes that just say ::.holla.:: (the word alone annoys the sh!t out of me) so you decided to be nice and check their page out before you ignore them and you realize their page is just as empty as the note they sent.. why am i going to waste my time trying to ::.holla.:: and someone with no depth? <img src=""http://www.click-smilies.de/sammlung0903/sprachlos/speechless-smiley-011.gif"">.. they make me want to be able to jump out their screen and punch the sh!t out of them <img src=""http://www.click-smilies.de/sammlung0903/grinser/grinning-smiley-017.gif"">. OoOh.. and you can't forget about the people who send you a ::.a/s/l.:: note.. wtf.. are you serious??!! migente is not AOL. i mean.. i understand people not wanting to read peoples life stories on their page but the A/S/L is located on everyones page.. right on the left side.. so sO SO simple.. <img src=""http://www.click-smilies.de/sammlung0903/traurig/sad-smiley-066.gif""> 

okay.. i think this is enough of me ranting for right now.. time for me to head to my bed and try to get some sleep in this freezing weather <img src=""http://www.click-smilies.de/sammlung0903/schlafen/sleeping-smiley-015.gif"">.. it's a damn shame i have nobody here to keep me warm <img src=""http://www.click-smilies.de/sammlung0903/grinser/grinning-smiley-001.gif""> j/k ya damn freaks ::<b>SMH</b>:: 

i'll be back.. bYe peoples!!!!!!!

"event","I forgot I had this website.. it's been almost one year since I hit this up so lets see what boring stuff I've been up to.. 

Relocation- 
I'm living in Antioch now.. I have to admit.. it's a nice ass house.. it was the model house so all the rooms were already painted and decorated and you know I had to pick the best room with a walk-in closet right? The neighborhood is quiet as hell and everybody that lives here seems to be either over 45 yrs old or under 17 yrs old.. no in between. And the 17 and under get on my last nerve.. here's why: 

So my lil sister is going to Deer Valley High.. a good ass school with many opportunities and a huge selection of classes.. the average test scores of that school are high and it's in the top rank of Cali high schools.. all these kids are spoiled as hell with no jobs.. driving 2003 cars that their mommy or daddy bought them.. none of the students have probably even stepped foot in a ghetto.. so tell me why the hell they act like they've lived a hard knock life?!?!?! there are kids claiming they belong to gangs.. GANGS IN ANTIOCH? LMFAOoOoOoOoOoOoOo oh man that some funny stuff.. they try so hard to act hard core and grown which annoys the hell outta me. 

Anyway.. there is absolutly nothing to do here. The only time you see people here after 10PM is on Friday and Saturday at the Theater by Deer Valley. The only other place to see people in antioch is at County East Mall.. a small ass 1 level mall.. 

OoOh and one more thing about Antioch.. ITS HOT AS HELL.. everyday and night it's over 100 degrees!! 

But eyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyz.. i'm not one to complain.. =] 


Work- 
So I obviously left Sears in San Bruno and began working at Washington Mutual as soon as I moved. Managers there were on a powertrip on a daily basis so I had to leave. I went back to working my ass off for Marriott. 


Aight.. it's time for me to head out to work so I'll be updating this later..

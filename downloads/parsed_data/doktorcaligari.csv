I'm a mean motherfucker
I'm a one eyed jack...

Last night was one of the weirdest nights of my life.  My friend Michelle moved in to HJ North, left her stuff in a pile on the floor, and took off with this guy she'd met the day before at Food Lion.  This was about 3:30 in the afternoon, and that was the last time I saw her.  She wouldn't answer her cell phone.

So, about midnight-1:00 last night, I tried to find out if anyone else had seen her, and no one had.  And everyone told me to call the Department of Public Safety, and they sent an officer over...

So me and Kalissa had to talk to a cop at 3:30 IN THE FUCKING MORNING (I was dressed in a nightgown with a long coat over it).  I finally went to bed after that.  

At 7:30 this morning, she called and said she got my message and she was coming back.  I don't know where she was or anything, but I called the officer and told him she was ok.  On top of all of this, my huge first college exam was at 9:00am this morning and I got four hours of sleep.  It was ok, because I've never really needed much sleep, but still...

when I hear her story, it had better be good after all this."

The girl:  Hey, this is a church on campus, and we're really fun and informal, so if you're looking for a church, you should come out and join us!  Have you been saved?

Me:  Actually, I'm an atheist and I'm proud of it.

The girl looks shocked and turns to Michelle and Kalissa:  How about you guys?
Michelle:  I'm an atheist.
Kalissa:  Me too.
Me:  You really stumbled into the pit of hell in this room!  (I shouldn't have said it, but the temptation was too great)
The girl:  So...what year are you guys?
Kalissa:  We're freshmen.
The girl:  So how do you decide to be an atheist when you're just a freshman?!
Me:  Well, it's sort of the family religion, back to my grandparents.
Kalissa:  My family
the girl:  (looks at Michelle) Are your family atheists too?
Michelle:  My family are Buddhists, but I'm an atheist.

I'm beginning to think I'm not, at least as far as friendship with girls goes. I'm not sure about guys yet. I was worried I'd be the only one sitting in the dorm on Friday night, but I ended up sitting in my suitemate's friend's dorm making curry at 2:00 in the morning. That weekend, my suitemate, the friend, and I went shopping at Walmart, made a cake in the dorm kitchen, and went out for Chinese food. We're trying to thwart my roommate by getting this girl moved into our suite before my roommate can move her friend into my half of the room. As far as class goes, they're mainly pretty similar to the ones in high school, except HUGE!! These lecture halls are ginormous! I adore my sci-fi class, and that's the only one that has less than 100 people in it. Actually, it has about 30, and I think it's hilarious that only four of us are girls. I got into biology lab, and now I have to raise backteria in little dishes. And that's all the news I've got for now."

Actually, I do, because I can hear her voice across the hall, so she's got to be over there somewhere.  She's a very social girl.  Seriously, every time I go into the room there's, like, three more of her friends in there.  Helping her fill out the sorority registration.  My main role in our room is to direct people who come looking for her.

California:  I managed not to get in a fight with anyone.  We went to the beach and dodged the jellyfish, but I wasn't  scared.  I really do love my relatives, although we haven't always gotten along and they're some of the most deranged people ever. 

My aunt had huge boxes of pictures from when she and my mom were children, and from when my grandparents were children.  I spent forever looking through them and reading all the old family papers.  It's amazing to me to actually know anything about my ancestors, who I've never heard much about.  I learned that my great great grandmother came from either Austria or Russia, and my great great grandfather was from either Poland or Russia.  It's different on different papers, but my aunt thinks that's because the borders of those countries were shifting when they were born.  My grandmother and her parents and sister all had their last names changed so they wouldn't sound Jewish.  She got married when she was seventeen, and she was very beautiful.  My great grandfather either had his first name changed at an early age or had a twin who died young, because we found a birth certificate for someone we've never heard of with the same birthday as him.

I went to see my grandfather, who I've rarely seen.  His hands shake very badly, so I sat by him and held them still, and he said he was sorry that he never saw me growing up.  I almost started crying.  He says, ""I don't know what happened to us."""

I went to my college orientation--Session 9 of it, to be exact.  It says Alice Robinson:  Session 9 across my nametag.  It took five hours to drive up there because of inclement weather, and I had to keep pulling over to sit in gas station parking lots because I couldn't see the road well enough to drive, it was raining so hard, but I finally got to the dorm to lie around and talk about movies and high school and high school movies with my roommate.  Then it was time to sign up for classes and collect my free computer!  I get to take  a whole class about sci-fi for my english credit, so I'm all excited.  

When I got back from orientation, I found my long-lost friend Travis, and he says he'll bring me his pirated copies of various cool movies and then he told me all about what kind of movies drag queens like to watch!  I'm trying to copy Dead Ringers for him because it's brilliant.

Speaking of home, you wouldn't believe the craziness going on today.  I came home from the pool and my mom was acting really weird to me.  She said, ""I went in your bookbag to find some notebook paper.  I hope that was ok with you.""  I said it was fine.  She finally blurted out, ""Alice, are you making a will?""  I couldn't imagine what she was talking about until she told me she had found a sheet of paper in my bookbag saying ""I, Alice, do hereby leave...""  Of course, it was the thingie for the school newspaper where all the seniors tell what they'll leave to the next class.  She saw that and thought I was going to kill myself.

And I got into a long conversation about horror movies with the guy behind the counter.  The other best part was the Pit, a big place where all the students hang out, because it contains the Pit Preacher.  Nobody knows his name, and he appears out of nowhere in the pit to bang on his Bible and tell all the students they're headed straight for Hell.  The students sit around and argue with him between classes.  I really hope I can go there...

and it continued on like that for a long time.  I guess he's sweet, but I just hate it when people grill me about my lack of a significant other.  I've had a boyfriend for two months of my life last year, three guys have asked me out in my life (and two of them were nuts), and the only time I made out was in the third grade.  That's all there is to it.  I know that I'm a social charity case--but I don't know how it ended up that way.  I am only on the same level with a few people who sit in the corner at our very own picnic table every day at lunch.  The boys who I could possibly have gone out with (Jay and Aaron) are gone away, and we were always just friends anyway.  

So anyway, now it have to go to work because some other girl got the flu. 

Bye!"

On the positive side, I'm going to meet with the wonderful amazing Latin teacher to discuss my future because I know absolutely nothing about colleges, scholarships, etc. and the guidance counselors are detestable and vile (and occasionally forget to send off people's college transcripts).

I watched this movie called Man Bites Dog that was about following a serial killer around trying to make a movie about him.  It was really inspirational, because it was made by three college kids with, like, no money and no actors besides their families and a few friends and they managed to actually make this cool movie (and get it banned in a bunch of countries!).  I wanna make my own movie now (a horror movie, of course), but what could it be about?  Sigh...

And Claire?  Do you wanna make me a pretty background for this thing some day?"

Actually, I'm not even sure it's a he--I turned him over to look, but I didn't know what to look for.  He's very sweet and pretty, and has green eyes.    My other cat is very jealous and hides under the desk all day looking mad.  I tried to drag him to my room last night, but we got in a huge fight in which he scratched me viciously.  

School tomorrow, though I hate to think of it...and I STILL haven't finished my summer reading!  However, I have read the entire set of Sandman comic books, which are much better, prettier, smarter, and more educational.  Plus, they involve a human-shaped nightmare with little mouths for eyes!  You should all read them.  And now I have to call my prospective college and find out why I haven't heard from them, so fare-thee-well..."

They're middle aged women, at least as old as my parents, and they're identical twins.  They look exactly alike, and they dress alike in old fashioned flowery dresses.  They have long, wavy brown hair.  They have bright eye makeup like dolls.  I saw them once in the library (the only time I've seen them), and their makeup was bright turquoise.  They're very beautiful.  My dad says he used to see them occasionally and he thinks they used to own an antique store.  My mom has seen them, but she doesn't know anything about them.  Jordan's mom thinks they live near us, and that's all I know.

Have you seen them?

The plan:  I'll see the twins in the library again.  I'll be dressed up in an old dress, which will catch their eye.  I'll think of something to say to them, or maybe they'll say something to me first.  They'll be starting another antique store (or strange curiousity shop) and will want me to work for them dusting the jars containing pickled creatures in their dark little store.

"event","A random list of what I've done since I last wrote...

School, work, home, school, work, home...I have to work so much (and there's nothing to do at work but rearrange the greeting cards so ""Happy birthday, Sexy!"" is in the slot labelled ""Grandmother's birthday."")  The boss must not realize that I'm a student and I can't spend all my time at the store.  Today I have to go look for her and demand that she cut back.  I'll wear my Tank Girl boots so I can be brave.

A few days ago, I went in the basement all by myself after school.  I was so scared I'd get caught by a creepy custodian, but at the same time it was exciting to be in there alone (in the dark, for part of the time).  

Yesterday the store was full of football-crazed assholes.  First, the Georgia fans came in and tried to play football in the store.  Then they tried to convince me to ""hang out"" with them after the store closed.  I said the only thing I could think of, which was that I wanted to be a nun when I grew up, but I'm not sure they believed me.  Next time a creep asks me out at work, I'm going to say, ""My homicidally jealous boyfriend is getting out on parole tomorrow,"" or ""My daddy is taking me to a hotel room tonight.""  I tend to think any guy who asks me out is probably trying to make fun of me or is out to get me somehow and any guy who I like would be disappointed that it's me who likes him and not a prettier, more feminine, and more social girl.  It's always the slimy creeps who ask me, anyway.  Later, the Carolina fans came in looking depressed and talking in subdued voices.  I really couldn't care less about football, which in this place is like saying you rape babies.  The zombies were smart enough to stay in hiding, so I didnt' see them.  After work, I went to Jordan's house to watch Peeping Tom, which was a really great movie.  

I went to Walmart and wore my wooden Japanese shoes.  Jay heard me clacking around and came looking for me, and we tried on all the Halloween masks.  Wallyworld isn't really so bad when you're not there alone.  Ok, off the find my boss...

But first, have you ever heard this song that went ""I could have made you say I'm beautiful, I'm wonderful...""  I heard it on the radio once, years ago, and it's now stuck in my head."

"event","California:  The good parts were wandering around the stores, learning to boogie board at the beach, Thomas throwing crackers around my head so I was lying in the middle of a ravenous flock of creepy ragged sea gulls, and seeing my aunts again (actually one is my aunt and the other is her permanent female lover).  The bad parts were getting in a huge argument with one aunt (the one who's related to me) because she put down a towel on her desk so our stuff wouldn't touch it and somehow mess it up.  She also complained the my brother put down the toilet seat too loudly and that my shoes hurt her ears.  After the argument I was so embarassed because I cried and acted like a baby, and I don't even know why I cared.  I hate for anyone to see me cry.  My grandparents seem to be falling apart.  My grandmother lives in a nursing home where one of the other women never stops screaming, and my grandfather plans to join her there.  He's a paranoid schizophrenic, and seeing him reminded me of the joke he told me a long time ago, when I was a little kid:  A man and his wife were riding in a horse-drawn carriage.  As they were going down the road, the horse stumbled.  The man said ""That's one.""  A little later, the horse let one wheel fall in a ditch.  He said ""That's two.""  Finally, the horse stopped to eat grass in the road.  He said ""That's three"" and then got out of the carriage and shot the horse in the head.  When he got back into the carriage, his wife yelled ""That was horrible!  Why did you do that?""  He said ""That's one.""  My aunt said (quite seriously) that I am very lucky that I haven't inherited any form of insanity.  

I really do adore my aunts, though they're picky and crazy at times, and overall, the trip to California was great.  It's a little strange being back in South Cackilackie.  And unfornately, now I'm about to go back to school, and I have one more trip to the guidance office ahead of me.  

Movies at Claire's house were fun, especially The Royal Tenenbaums.  I really should have warned everyone about Elephant, though.  Anyway, I'm off to guidance."

The girl and the crazy man live all alone, and the girl loves him so much that she starts to see his crazy visions.  I tried to discuss movies with my aunt, who I'm going to visit in a week.  She said I should watch City of God.  I told her about The Cabinet of Doctor Caligari and she said, ""What's the point?""  She thinks I'm a freak and said I should make sure to find a college where they'll put up with my weirdness, so I'm a little nervous about going to visit her.

"event","i wasn't able to make it home to see my family for christmas.
so, monica and i celebrated in our usual holiday tradition: vodka cranberries
we made a turkey dinner, which is noteworthy because neither of us can cook.
after talking to our families, the first drinks were poured (more out of necessity than celebration) and it was downhill from there
i think it was one of the best christmases i've had, having a simple day with one of the people i love most. 
i hope you all had a great christmas, and that santa was good to you!"

"event","i've been living in nashville for about a week now. it's definitely not phoenix, which is both good and bad. i'll definitely miss the weather and scenery of arizona, especially when i warm my car up in the 23 degree mornings. i won't miss the traffic there, and it's nice to be within 1000 mile range of my family.

i won't be able to go home for christmas, because having just started at my new office, everybody already has their vacations scheduled. i'm fine with that. my boss lives and works out of knoxville, which is nice. i'll see him roughly once per month. 

i'm living with a gay couple of five years, joe and joe. it's been nice thus far. my last roommate was okay, but all he ever did when he was home was watch tivoed episodes of judge judy, which didn't lend itself to bonding. 

i really really hope i'll be able to make friends here. i have such bad people skills when i'm meeting people. after i've known them for awhile it's okay, but it's so hard to get to that point with anyone. blah, guess we'll just have to see what happens."

"event","it's been a little while. i should change my new years resolution to lj more to a mid-year type resolution.

how's everyone? i still read everybody's livejournals so i know pretty much whats going on, but keeping up errs, you know. 

what's been happening with me? this would be a great time for a list:

- so, gas prices. wow! it's up to $4.15 / gallon here, and that's still among the cheaper places in the country. i bought a bike and i now bike to work. it's six miles each way. i feel great by the time i get to work in the morning i'm refreshed. by the time i get home at night, i'm a puddle of sweat. i enjoy that people think i'm environmentally conscious, when really i'm just too cheap to pay that much for gasoline.

- i've moved closer to work. i had a weird situation where i ended up paying rent on three different places for the month of june, but that's over and done with. i found this roommate / place on craigslist. it's pretty nice, it's close to work (see above) and i'm saving almost $300/month on rent *high five* 

- using some of this money i'm able to save (see above), i took a long weekend last week and drove to las vegas. my brother and sister in law flew in from ny, and a gaggle of our friends from high school went, too. for the two of you who actually know him, maarten says 'hi' he came in from denver with his fiancee. the hilight of the trip was seeing my brother nearly pass out as he stepped outside the air conditioned airport, after weeks of ""it's a dry heat, it's no big deal"". if he had fallen and required stitches, i'd be particularly vindicated. i won enough overall on the blackjack table to pay for my trip (score) but lost enough on the last day to make sure this would not be habit forming. the play of the weekend came when my friend nikki the pharmacist won $400 on one hand of blackjack at caesar's palace. 

- if new york new york is so named for it's whimsical portrayal of the big apple, then they really should change the name of the casino ""slots a fun"" to ""new jersey new jersey"". in a nod to the garden state, this casino lacks any doors, opting instead for the slide-down metal doors much like a warehouse, ninety nine cent one-pound hotdogs, and enough aquanet to burn a hole in the ozone the size of new jersey.  

- we can what, barack? 
i'm not particularly thrilled with either candidate this election cycle. the oldest candidate in history running against a man who was practically passing dog-poop ordinances three years ago. oh, the options. why is it mccain can pander to people's morality and oppose gay marrige on those grounds, when he had an affair with his current wife, while still married to his first one? 

-'only child of an heiress, turned sorority sister at usc, turned the-other-woman' i think if cindy mccain plays up that angle with aggressive marketing at pilates studios and ann taylor's across the country they will cinch the exurb votes. 

- politics aside, i think michelle obama could be the next jackie-o from an iconic standpoint. she reminds me of aunt viv from the fresh prince of bel air. 

- i'd also love to see little malia and sasha obama get into a hair-pulling screaming match at an important state function. the possibility of that happening may be enough to cinch my vote. i wonder if any superdelegates have made up their minds based on this.

- as of next week i'll have been in phoenix for a year. how time flies. it certainly has been different then i'd expected it to be but i'm alive, i'm sober, and i'm at peace...or i may just be addicted to klonopin. 

- i was kidding about klonopin addiction

- ....and i'm done :-) hope you're all doing well!"

"event","- i usually go running on a treadmill, especially since moving here. last night, i went running at tempe town lake. the scenery was beautiful (sun devil stadium, a bunch of new condos etc). even though the lake is more of a canal, the humidity coming off it was almost unbearable! it's amazing what a little water will do. 

- speaking of running; i'm not sure why, but i can run alot further / longer on a treadmill than i can outside. i don't think it's the weather, because it's always been like that. i've talked to other people for whom it's the other way around. i guess it just depends what you're used to. 

- i have an appointment next week to get more zoloft. woot. i don't think i'm dependant on it, but it sure helps with the social anxiety, especially since i'm in a new place and don't really know anybody. i think i've been doing okay, but i'll probably feel a lot calmer once i'm taking it again. 

- flipping through the channels last night, i saw a q & a session with the democratic candidates on logo. i was expecting the panel to fawn over the candidates. it was rather refreshing to see melissa etheridge jump down hilary's throat. she talked about what a 'hopeful time' it was for the gays when bill was elected, and how his administration 'thew them under the bus'. it was funny. 

- speaking of politics; why is it just assumed that gay people are liberal? the panel on logo wasn't representative of who i am. i identify more with middle of the road straight people than angry loud militant lesbians. i doubt logo will provide any airtime to the log cabin republicans. 

- been trying to meet some people lately. ive managed to meet two people that i can at least hang out with once a week and play a game of pool or something. it's slow going, but i realize these things take time."

"event","i hate blue cross blue shield. more specifically, i hate their website that keeps timing out and their busy server when i'm trying to find a lousy dermatologist who got roped into getting screwed over by their contracted rates to treat me for stupid acne that should've gone away when i was 17. 

i thought i had found one yesterday. i called to make an appointment smack dab in the middle of business hours. i received a message stating the office does not answer their phones between noon and 3pm.

what?

i can understand taking an hour or so for lunch. but three hours? i would love to be able to leave a message telling people i don't answer my phone for a three hour period each day. if i did, though, i wouldn't be answering anymore calls because i'd be out of a job. 

i left a message requesting a return call to schedule a new patient appointment. of course, i didn't receive a call back. bah. 

yesterday afternoon, i got to ride along with one of our field reps on a face to face appointment she had with a claimant on a liability claim. 

i really didn't realize how sprawling the phoenix area is. before yesterday, i hadn't been west of i-17, so i basically hadn't seen over half the metro area. we drove by the university of phoenix stadium, where the superbowl is going to be. it looks like it's inflatable or something, because it was built with a gray kind of metal, and the structure is kind of round. hm, i obviously didn't explain that well. take my word for it. 

anyway, we meet with the lady at her apartment yesterday afternoon. in this case, we insure a restaurant, and a table top from a bar table fell on her foot after she placed her drink on it. at first, she was okay. her foot was bruised and she went to the doctor to make sure her foot wasn't broken. 

three weeks later *and after she was undoubetly contacted by somebody telling her she could make some money from this* she answered the door on crutches wearing an air cast complaining about the ""worst pain of her life"". granted, i'm sure having a tabletop fall on your foot is not pleasant. the first time the field person met with the lady a week after the accident, she was walking on it with no problems. two weeks later, her foot is numb, except when it's unberably painful. right. if people wonder why insurance rates are so high, it's the millions of examples like this, where people make more of their pain and suffering to make some money. 

i've had a horrible sinus problem since i moved here. i saw the doctor who gave me zithromax for a sinus infection. the medicine helped, but it didn't competely fix it. i've had nasty headaches almost every night. i looked online for a natural remedy, because i don't like taking too much medication.

i found a 'neti pot', which is basically a do it yourself sinus flush. sounds kinda gross, huh? well, i found a neti pot at walgreens and went to town. it looks like a genie's lamp that's filled with warm water and a little packet of powder that makes it into a saline soultion, much like tears. 

the process was awkward at first. it feels like when you get water up your nose while swimming, but not as bad.

but: i had instant relief. i haven't had any sort of headaches or allergies since i started using it. so, if any of you take claritin or lots of sinus / allergy medication it might be worth it to try a neti pot. 

i don't have any big plans this weekend, but i still can't wait to get out of here. i'm jealous of all you east coast people, where it's already noon."

i was under the impression that when you move, all you need to do to have your mail delivered to your new address is to fill out a form at the post office, which i did well before i left tennessee.

i thought it was kind of strange that i haven't received any mail since being in phoenix. i got a call from my mom this morning at 5:30 (she still hasn't caught on to the time change thing) saying the birthday card she sent me had been returned. i checked the mailbox, and there on a little green slip was a snippy note, all in capital letters, from the mail man stating ""NO NAME, NO MAIL!!"". 

i've lived in several apartments, and i've never had to label my mailbox with my name in order to receive my mail. i spoke with the post office, who stated it was not an actual law, but it was just something they decided to do (without telling anybody on the usps website) for 'security' reasons. 

i'm glad the only thing i've really missed is a bank statement and a few birthday cards. what if i was a senior citizen waiting for a social security check? that whole thing made me angry. i don't mind following the procedure, but when the procedure isn't even communicated, i get frustrated."

"event","i love it here! anyplace where people complain because it doesn't rain enough, and the sunshine is boring is alright with me. 

yesterday was my birthday. i wasn't expecting for it to be great, because i'd only been here for six days. i ended up having a really nice time, though. my boss and coworkers took me out for happy hour after work. it didn't disappoint; i was quite happy by the time i left, as a result of doing shots with my bosses boss. i was possibly happy enough to have my license suspended if i had been pulled over. 

i walked in my apartment to see a freshly baked cake from my roommate. he and a friend of his took me out for even more drinks. i didn't need them obviously, but it didn't require too much arm twisting to get me to go out. i discovered a little hole in the wall bar named apollo's that i think will be the new metro (where i always went in memphis). it looks like a double wide from the inside, complete with wood paneled walls. that's my kinda place lol. they also have a charlie's here - a gay country bar. i think it's a chain, because its basically the same place that jeepskank talks about going to in denver. the country music is a welcome relief from dance / techno music and it almost brings a tear to my eye to see cowboys two stepping with each other - i really don't know why, though. 

one of my major pet peeves are people who are alone in their vehicle, but think it's okay if they drive in the hov lane during rush hour. we only had one stretch of hov lane in memphis that lasted for a few miles, so i was able to look past it. here, though, there are hov lanes everywhere. i can't really remember anything that's made me angrier in recent memory.

i've finally started running again. despite having done well at it earlier this year, and really enjoying it, i stopped for a few months because i was distracted with applying for jobs and figuring out where i wanted to move to. i have a bad habit of hyper focusing on certain things, and giving up recreational things while waiting for the issued to be worked out. the two months that i had to wait to hear back about my job i wasn't able to think about much else except where and when i would be moving.

anyway, long story short, i had a painful and pitiful, yet gratifying run the other night and will hopefully go tonight. i live near a desert / foothills park that's just beautiful. running with cactuses and palm trees will hopefully be novel enough to get me motivated to run until i get back into the habit. 

i'm not sure what i'll do this weekend. maybe go to the snooty scottsdale fashion square mall. i'd really never seen 'on the rack' items in a store that cost $3,000 until i went there last week. i should probably finish putting together my bedroom furniture. i bought a 'malm' bed and matress from ikea and managed to put the bed together myself. that was enough to justify not doing anyting else for about a week, but maybe i can get the dresser put together. 

that's my life in the fast lane. i hope all of you are doing well! i bought a new digital camera before i moved, but have yet to take any pictures. maybe ill snap some photos and get them posted here. enjoy your weekend."

leaving monica again is really the only thing that's giving me pause. this past year was a beautiful reminder of what having a best friend means. i love her more than i've loved anything. it's a healthy comfortable love that lets me be myself. i've tried my best not to take seeing her everyday for granted. 

she was asleep when i left for work this morning. i didn't want to wake her up just to fumble around for some words that wouldn't come close to describing what she means to me. instead, i kissed her forehead just before i left. she sighed a bit and shuffled around in bed. that seems to have said it all.

i'm excited to be going, though. i found a roommate on craigslist who seems relatively normal. i was a bit hesitant, but i managed to convince myself that a disproportionate number of freaks do not use craigslist. it looks like a nice place, near downtown phoenix. my commute should only take about twenty minutes. 

i had a quiet weekend, mostly spent packing. i can't believe how much junk i've managed to accumulate in the course of two years. my friends were all otherwise occupied by either parents, out of town trips, or new love interests. at any rate, this weekend helped assuage any lingering doubts i may have had about leaving.

"event","Hey everybody. I'm alive. Stuff has actually been happening in my life. Score.

There's no great way to segue an awkward three month gap with no updates, so why don't we just go for the bullet format:

 - My best friend (the highly esteemed, yet short lived monbon218) moved here from Minnesota two months ago. She'll be taking my other roommate's bedroom who is moving out for personal reasons. It's been so great having her here. Before August, I hadn't seen her in almost four years (although we talked on the phone several times per week). Surprisingly, there was no awkwardness when I did see her for the first time. It was just like we picked up where we left off. 
Monica + living here = no more boring life for me!

- Having Monica here has equated to a fat life for me, though. My weight, while not obese, has reached epic proportions for what I'm used to. I haven't run in two months. So, I fell off the bandwagon. I think i'll wait until January to start worrying about all this. 

- I withdrew from school. My calculus professor could not speak English. Math is difficult enough without that language barrier. I'll try again once I can find a professor whose words wouldn't be well accompanied by a gong.

- I've begun volunteering at a shelter / center for abused women and children. It feels great to do something that matters. 

- In a strange turn of events, Adam and I are speaking again. Adam is the guy I dated for 4 or 5 months last year. We stopped speaking one day in January with no reason or warning. I thought seeing him again would be really weird, but we went out for a drink one night and it was a lot of fun. We're having Thanksgiving together this year; minus his adonis like exboyfriend, and the chicken entree we ate last year.

- I think I've been disowned by my older brother, who hasn't spoken to me in over two months. There was stupid family drama. I'm not as shaken up over it as I thought I might be.

- I had the honor of being in Adrianne (Chachi42)'s wedding a few weeks ago. It was a wonderful wedding once we got there. My plane broke down on the runway as we were taxiing for take off, and Adrianne had to drive for three hours through the freak snowstorm in October.

All in all, life is good. If anybody still checks this thing for updates, God bless you!

Doctors appointment now; more later."

"event","Growing up, one of those things I could always be sure would happen come hell or high water, was having to run the mile in gym class in the fall, and again in the spring. I hated it. 

Being the quintessential fat kid with messed up hair, glasses and braces I was always in the back of the pack. It was a hard fought victory for me to finish the mile before the integrated special needs students, the anorexic girl who didn't have enough energy to run, and the girl nicknamed the suicidal giant, because well, she was large and unstable.

Our gym teacher was really serious about the mile run, and establised a cut off time by which had to complete it, or else we would have to stay after school to run it again. Seriously. 

Sometime around my sophmore year of high school I decided that I really didn't want the frustration and humiliation that came twice a year like clockwork. The mile run was actually only one part of the New York State physical fitness tests. We would get these stupid index cards to fill out our results for situps, pushups etc. They were dramatically official for gym class, with things like stamps and signatures. Anyway, we were under strict instruction to hand our cards in at the end of class to be reviewed by our teacher. Because our gym classes were held every other day, I figured realistically there was no way the teacher would sit and look at the results for hundreds of kids. I didn't turn mine in on situp and pushup day, and skipped class on ""the mile"" day. Very aware that I was not a jock, i fudged a number that wouldn't raise any suspicions given my height / weight ratio and my very apparent lack of effort. 

I would hold on to the card until later in the day, or the next day, when I would tell the gym teacher that I must have been in the bathroom or at the drinking fountain when he collected the cards. I was nervous doing it, but it was better then running the mile. Our tests were in September and May, coupled with the fact my gym teacher had absolutely no idea who I was, and because I do believe he drank heavily, he never caught on that I always brought my card to him after the fact. 

For two and a half years it worked. I graduated high school comfortable in the knowledge that I would never again have to run another mile in my life, and really never intended to.

I shared this story to contextualize last evening. For the first time in my entire life I ran two miles. I did so without stopping, and in the time it used to take me to run ""the mile"". Little victories are great. Two miles down, 24.2 left."

"event","I got back from my great grandmothers funeral last night at 11pm. Eight hours later, I was sitting at work. I had a three hour layover in Detroit. 

I got home to NY Tuesday around midnight. Even though I know my family, I always feel weird around people when somebody has died. Despite being the only one willing to plan the funeral, my mom had a sense of relief about her. Both for my great grandmother, who had been suffering terribly for the past few months, as well as a certain amount of relief for her. It felt partially like my mother was graduating from school - a world of bright possibility laid out before her (nevermind she's 50 years old).

My mother never really had the opportunity to experience, well, freedom. Her father died a week before her high school graduation. My grandmother had to get a job, leaving my mother at home to raise my aunt and uncle, who were eight and twelve. She then married and divorced my father, married my step-father and had three sons. 

About the time my brothers and I were old enough to allow our mom some sort of reprieve, my grandmother was diagnosed with cancer. My mother moved her in with us, and took care of her while she struggled with terminal cancer for almost three years. After my grandmother died, my great grandmother moved back to New York from Florida. By this time, it was assumed that my mom would be the one to once again put her life on hold and take care of things. My mother did this dutifully. Five plus times per week taking her to appointments, running errands, cleaning her apartment, all while trying to raise her own family. This continued week after week, month after month since 1994, ultimately culminating in daily visits to the nursing home. 

The planning was rather difficult. The Church my Nana belonged to is under construction and was unavailable for a funeral. We had to go to another Church, whose music person wanted $200 to sing four songs at the service. My mom told him for that price he'd better be dancing, too. 

I'm phobically uncomfortable around the dead, and am equally bothered by conflict. So basically, my family in a funeral home is about as bad as it gets for me. My family was there, along with my aunt and uncle we haven't spoken to in twelve years. We took our respective places on opposite ends of the coffin. They were trying to make small talk before everybody arrived.

Mom: ""So, how were your 40's?""
Uncle: ""good *clears throat* yup""
Mom: ""Clinton was reelected""
Uncle: *nervous laughter*

I have two aunts: ""loud aunt"" (who is married to estranged uncle)and ""meth aunt"" (useless relative who lived with nana, but should have been arrested for elder abuse). It was a shock to everyone that Meth Aunt showed up. She's lost over sixty pounds since I last saw her, some of which i'm sure are from her teeth rotting out of her head from the various illicit substances that are coursing through her body. 

Luckily, Meth Aunt's boyfriend ""Scum of the Earth"" didn't come to the wake. Though that didn't stop him from calling her a fuckton of times and berating her in the funeral home. ""Scum of the Earth"" hit on ""Loud Aunt's"" eighteen year old daughter at her graduation party, even though he's fifty. I found that out while standing inbetween meth aunt and nana's body. 

Meth aunt is apparently friends with some Wiccan people, which doesn't sit very well with my die hard Catholic mother. An entire gaggle of them walked in the room wearing that weird flowing renaissance shit and pentograms. This included a he-witch, who looked just like comic book guy from the Simpsons. No joke. Loud aunt was apparently taken aback and wanted to know why there were witches walking toward her. She's not as quiet as she thinks she is. That only added to the awkwardness. 

Fortnately, my eighteen month old niece kept trying to climb into the coffin with Nana. This would obviously be unfortunate for her still developing psyche were she to succeed, however it let my mom pick her up and take her away from the bereavement line, where the witches were slowly approaching to offer condolences. 

My mom took little Anna outside for some fresh air, where she was almost run over by a police car. My uncle, ""jail guy"", had arrived. He was escorted from his stay in the penitentary to the funeral home to pay his last respects in an orange jumpsuit. 

The police escort scared away the witches, who had just skiied up my aunt in the casket showroom (no, i'm not kidding). 

All things considered, it went a lot better then it could have. Meth Auth, Estranged Uncle, and Loud Aunt had an awkward limousine ride. It took nearly an hour to travel a few miles to the cemetery because of construction. During the ride, estranged uncle said that people should be having a reception ""for us, because we're the ones who did everything for Nana"". My mom asked him if he had a mouse in his pocket, because he certainly hadn't done much of anything since 1994.

I had to be a pallbearer. I wasn't sure how heavy the thing was going to be, so I lifted too much which was kind of embarassing. Also, I pinched my finger inbetween the casket and the hearse. Ouch. 

So that was the story of the funeral.

On a happier note, I got to see the triplets for the first time. They were born the day I went back to Tennessee after my last visit. They're so tiny now, it's hard to imagine what they were like when they were born. Ryan got circumcized while we were there. My brother, step dad and I made a beeline for the door when they came in to do the procedure, but my mom was like ""we need to be here for him"". We all winced and ran out the door. Then it was awkward afterward because my mother was talking about the importance of circumcision, and when we had ours done. I really didn't want to know that about my brothers. 

So, another nice trip home. The low humidity was a novelty for sure."

"event","My great grandmother passed away earlier today. She was 99 years old.

I often joke that Nana has more of a social life then I do, and it's true. She lived in apartment with my aunt until only a few weeks ago, when she agreed to move into a nursing home. She was more aware of current events then a majority of this year's graduating class at most public high schools.

Concessions had to be made to keep Nana independent - ie: my mother's life. For the past fifteen years, my mom has dutifully gone to see my Nana at least five times per week to take her grocery shopping, to pay her bills and make sure her checkbook was balanced, to get her hair done, and to doctor's appointments. 

To paint a portrait of the my family heritage: My mother had to call her twin brother to inform him of Nana's passing. The same twin brother who hasn't spoken to us in twelve years, and hired lawyers to try and kick us out of our house sometime in the mid 90's, after my grandmother passed away. 

She tried to call her sister, my aunt, however her phone was disconnected because her paychecks have been going up her nose for the past 8 months.

Lastly, she would have attempted to contact her younger brother to let him know, but he's in prison. My mother is truely a saint among sinners. 

Obviously this was expected. Nana has cheated death on more occasions then I can count. She was on hospice care no less then five times over the past ten years. (Hospice is for  when people are only expected to live for a month or two longer). Still, it's a pretty big loss, the ""family matriach"" is gone. She's quite literally ALWAYS been there. 

Once, while talking about her younger days, she was talking about ""the war"". I assumed it was world war II, but she was actually referring to the first world war! How many people today are alive and lucid enough recall memories from 1917? 

Nana saw the advent of the automobile, airplane, radio, television and computers. She lived to become a great-great-grandmother. She also had to live through losing her husband (who passed away 28 years ago today), twelve of her siblings, and her only child, my grandmother(who died on the same day as her favorite sister). 

I'll sure miss her.

It'll be nice to go home and see my family, though however dubious the circumstances. 

RIP Eva Simms. 03-24-1907 - 07-16-2006."

It started off with a happy-birthday wake up call from my mom. It pretty much ended there, too lol. Actually, Chris remembered which was nice of him. And Marvelboy74 gave me a ""shout out"" in his LJ. 

BUT I had to work all day, followed by class tonight. I was going to treat myself to a barbeque sandwich for lunch, but I had to buy a book for my class during lunch so I wasn't able to. 

It's annoying when you realize how small you are in the grand scheme of things. My older brother is in St. Louis on a business trip, and my younger brother is on vacation in Florida so I didn't hear from either of them. 

Neither did I hear from any of the three people who claim me as their best friend. I've lived with one (who also forgot it when we were roommates), I'm in one of these people's weddings, and the third I really never talk to anymore. 

Whine Whine Whine. Obviously, it's not a HUGE deal. It's more of a reminder of the consequences that occur when I shut people out of my life, as i'm quite prone to doing. 

Life in general is going pretty well. Nothing earth shattering to report. I did some physical therapy for my knees, which seem to be doing better. I'm taking a second accounting course this summer. 

I rejected the advances of a new bartender and MY bar. He wanted to be like life partners after only having known me for three days. That's stupid. I need to know somebody for a few months before feeling comfortable dating them. So, because i'm mature, I can never go there again because i'll be trying to avoid him forever."

Yesterday after work, Jennifer, Kahla and I went to look at our new apartment. In a word: LOL. The place is actually pretty big: 1800 square feet, with all bedrooms upstairs. The laughable part of our new home is the ""den"". It's located at the back of the apartment, and with good reason. 

My words can't do it justice except to say it looks like an Elks Lodge, or some similar type place where one would expect to see men in straight-brimmed baseball caps drinking cheap beer out of koozies, while talking about the hard times in town after the plant shut down, with women who have home perms and names like ""Tammy"" ""Brandy"" or ""Crystal"". You know, that kind of place. 

There's wood paneling on the walls, brown linoleum floors and a giant off-centered fireplace. The location of the fireplace isn't off centered, the actual hole-in-the-wall where the fire goes is grossly lopsided, resulting in a few FEET of faux stone on the left side of it, versus a few INCHES of it to the right. There's a stained and schalacked wood beam that functions as the fireplace mantle. It ain't-no-place for the ""Starry Night"" print that we currently have hanging over our fireplace.

We were all laughing too hard at the room to actually feel hoodwinked. We decided that, much like Star Jones, there ain't no making it prettier, and it'd be ugly no matter what size it is, so we might as well enjoy it. Hopefully, we can find a moose head to put on the wall, along with second hand shag carpeting, and a copy of ""Dog's Playing Poker"" for the wall. 

Pictures definitely to follow."

I had to post it from photobucket, and then type and click really quickly to make it a 'private' entry. Sorry if anybody who didn't otherwise want to, can now conjure up an image of my chest / stomach. 

Fitness sucks, but cancer is worse. The fronts of my knees hurt me when I run. I need to figure out how to properly stretch them. 

At the track where I go running, there is a football team that practices at the same time i'm there. I pretend the coach is yelling at me to motivate me, except when he yells about pushups and i ignore him, because they hurt too much. 

I was *this* close to leaving Memphis and moving to Charlotte next month, but will be staying here for at least another six months. They go by quickly. I haven't really given living here a fair chance.

I took one for the team and volunteered to work today so that people with actual lives could enjoy them. I woke up with bitter pangs of jealousy this morning, but now that the day is half way over they have subsided. It'll be nice coming in tomorrow because i'll be situated and caught up, whereas everybody else will still be lacadazical from the long weekend. 

Speaking of the weekend: It was nice. 

On Friday, I went to look at a townhouse in Germantown with Jennifer and Kahla. The aparment is 3 bedrooms, 2.5 baths, two living rooms and a separate dining room. It's 1800 square feet, which I'm pretty sure is larger then my parents house. I really hope we get it. Jennifer was approved, so I don't see any reason why I won't be. We only need 2/3 people to be approved, so even if i'm not, Kahla will be because her mother cosigned for her. I've never heard of cosigning for a lease, but whatever. 

Kahla's mother is the embodiment of the stereotypical ""southern belle"". Mrs. Marla Rowell, said in an old-money southern white repulican drawal. When I met her, she extended her hand and kept her palm down, in that don't-you-dare-shake-it type way. So I just kind of held it for a minute lol, it was awkward. 

On Saturday, amicrazyorwhat drove here from Nashville to take a picture of water. I am admittedly not a chatty person, especially when I don't know somebody, so lunch was a little quiet! Afterward though, we went to the Wolf river, and I took him on a half hour tour of Memphis and I was starting to be able to verbalize my thoughts haha. I'm the worst navigator in the world. I forget to tell him to turn or get in the correct lane like ten times within a twenty minute span. Whoops. Garrett hates Elvis, but I made him drive past Graceland just because he couldn't come here without seeing it. It has a jet parked in the front yard, which reminds me of homes that have the broken down cars parked in the lawn. You can make a man a superstar, but ya can't take the south out of the man!

On Saturday night, I went out with my friend Herschel, who used to be my manager at my part time job. He and his boyfriend of two years recently broke up, so he's trying to get back in the proverbial saddle.

Who here is good at small talk? I need some pointers. After a weekend of social anxiety, I really need to improve my ""soft"" people skills. Actually, I'm fine around a majority of the population, it's just when i'm around the gays that I clam up. 

For the first time since 1998, I ran two miles last night. It's not alot, and I'm frankly a bit embarassed to be writing it, but it's more then i've been able to run in eight years. I'm writing it here so that hopefully as I look back, i'll be able to see what kind of improvement I am making. 

I did some checking online, and there is a very active running community here. Once i'm able to run three-ish miles or so, i'm going to check it out. One of my life dreams is to run a marathon. I can't imagine being able to complete 26.2 miles, but it's something to work toward. 

Just for my own reassurance:
154 days without smoking
2 miles"

Going to a club with my friend / ex part time job boss; watching him shamelessly hit on people. I felt like I was watching an episode of elimidate, becuase he was juggling three different men.

Drag queen routine to ""My Name is Luca"" - a good way to guilt the tips in,

**Seeing a man wearing a monicle! I really can't stress how much that made my night. I too was under the mistaken impression that they were an irrelevant statement with the voice of today. I thought they had been ushered out with the ending of the agrarian revolution in America, but I was wrong! I went to get my digital camera from my car to take his picture, but when I got back, he was gone. One day, mysterious monicle man, one day."

"event","96 degrees yesterday, 94 today, and the 90's are expected to continue for the rest of the week. I love hot weather! Summertime has arrived.

Today marks one year since moving to Memphis. All things considered, I think i've done pretty well especially since i had never even been here before moving. 

I quit smoking, which is probably one of my proudest accomplishments ever, because I honestly never thought I would be able to do it. 

I also went back to school to pursue a more relevant degree to my career. I always said I would, but I know if I had stayed where I was, I would never have done anything about it.

I tried some dating / relationship stuff. It didn't work, but I'm certainly not bitter. Better luck next time, right?

I do get lonely sometimes, because being more outgoing / sociable is definitely something that I have to work on. But ya know what? I'm still here.  

Oh and I meant to apologize to y'all for not responding to the comment you've left lately. I think it's kind of rude when I don't, so I wanted to let you know that I appreciate that you read and care enough to leave them.

Been in an LJ rut lately, but I'm gonna make an effort to get back in the swing of things.

My friend Nicole (Eyebrow00) is visiting from Ohio, which has been a blast. We're going to a barbeque later today. BTW: I was told in no uncertain terms that there is a difference between a cookout and a barbeque. Did you know that? I sure as hell didn't."

The first picture is of Katelyn. She was the smallest of the three until a week or so ago when she moved in to second place at 2.6 pounds. 

The second picture is of Jack. I can't imagine how tiny they are. His diaper is the smallest they make, and he's swimming in it. 

They look so uncomfortable, it's kind of heartbreaking.

Not pictured due to technical difficulties (ie: My mother's finger on the lens) is Ryan. My brother and mom both say he looks exactly like my grandfather. I was never good at telling who looks like whom, but I guess i'll have to wait to see.

"event","I made it back to NY safely, for those of you who have been holding their breath. 

I was en route to the airport at 6am on Saturday morning, and never had the opportunity to realize what an unfortunate number of people are awake at that time of the day. 

On my flight from Cleveland to here, I had a very gay flight attendant named ""phaul"" - which is pronounced ""paul"". He was wearing a rainbow bracelet and before takeoff Whitney Houston's greatest hits were playing in the cabin. It struck me as being odd because I have never heard music playing on an airplane. I wondered what kind of divas were in the cockpit. That flight was awkward, because it was a small plane, and I was located in seat 1-A, so while ""phaul"" was seated in his reverse facing flight attendent chair, i felt like he was staring at me. 

My brother and I went out, and just after exiting the highway the axel in his car snapped. Nice. If we had done what we were going to do, we would have been going 80 miles per hour when it broke, probably killing us. He picked up his 2006 Altima today. 

I went to the mall with my brother and cousin, and we made it our mission to fix every flipped up collar on display in American Eagle, since it bothers all of us a lot. We actually got most of the collard flipped back to their intended position. Nevermind that we're 26, 25 and 22 years old. 

I saw my old coworkers today. My friend Cristy is being wooed by a coworker. He brought her a homemade taupiary in the shape of a heart. *blank stare*

Not much else to report. It's nice to have a social life of sorts again. I briefly thought about coming back, but i've been subtley reminded why I left since then. 

I hope everybody is doing well."

"event","I didnt go out til about 9 tonight. I went to the beach to celebrate our independence. Colin and i drove out to Savys beach house in Madeira. We had some took conversations and then we stopped by Wendy's.....open late night bitch. There was no one there cept the gay dude that hit on us and gave us free food and stuff. Weird. So we kept on driving and finally got to the beachhouse. It was Kelli,Kierston, Savy, Colin and me. We went out to the water and there were a bunch of people and some white trash too...they arent people. so we went back and then everyone had a few drinks. Later we went out there to swim and such and we all started talking in the water. Its all about being naked. Everyone freaks about it. Cept for Colin. People do things just to do em so they can say they did...whatever. I decided to go skimboarding for an hour. Oh man it was amazing surf for skimboarding. After awhile i just laid on my board and thouht about everything. My mind was so clear at that point. When everyone came out of the water...Colin just marched naked towards Savy and Kiebs and he said they freaked out. Kierston was being pretty bitchy all night til we made her have a few shots. We went back tot he beachhouse and saw mikes car. He drove my car so i was pissed. We didnt think hed actually go and i told him id pay him if he showed up. Anyways we all started playing cards with this relative of savys. He had no problem giving us money since he was drunk. So my night was pretty much free from the money I won. We left savys around 4 and got home at 445. What fun it is when there no one on the road. When i got home my mom said i was grounded....i wonder if shell stick to it or even remember it....they did go to ybor soo yeah. I have to work in like 2 hours so ill post later..uhh today   night"

"event","so yeah i didnt post yesterday....eh oh well i saw Terminator 3...that movie was badass and kelli and i were makin sexual references the whole time....that was fun. After that Mike Kel and me went to cheddars. We met Kiebs Savaho and Amber? yeah thats her name or is it? I had an energy drink during the movie and some motrin....bad combo bc everything was funny. I ate some of Kierstons chocolate cake and it was good. We decided to go to Walmart and box bc we wanted to see kel and amber fight...woulda been badass but instead mike and i fought. Mike pulled the you didnt win shit again with me even though i punched the hell out of it and he only got me good once. So then we just left and all went home afterward. Mike and I went over to colins house and talked to him to tell him his light was on and i had to ask him when we were goin to the beach. Anyways after that we left and on the way home through buckhorn We found a house with huge boxes all up in the driveway stacked and stuff so mikes like hell yeah im gonna drive through that......so we got in his car and smashed right through em. It was hilarious   man weve done so much crazy shit in our day. After that i drove around and then went over to Macs house and hung out with some of em until 2ish. We had fun even though theres nothing to do in this town. So yeah i went to bed again around 5ish and woke up at 8 this morning. Hoban and colin were comming around 9 so i had to get my stuff together. We went over to dunkindonuts and ate and then left. We went to Anna Maria Island and frankly...that beach sucked...there was shells and rocks when you went in the water so it hurt like hell when i was skimboarding today. Man my hands are all cut up and stuff. The beach was empty and it was sunny. I got really burnt on my back but i was the least burnt out of everyone. These 2 guys that Jenna knew were total dumbass assholes to everyone so that was gay. I called Chels to talk for awhile while everyone went in the pool bc the pool sucked....jenna was stayin at a resort called the bistro and well it was more like crap. We all went to Bk where i had another incredible Whopper and then we were off for valrico again. I hate it. Pulliam drove us home and Colin was talkinga bout alotta stuff and was saying good shit again. So yeah im kinda tired now and i dunno what im doing tonight. Maybe someone cool will call me and ask me to do something so ill post later tonight."

"event","After the dentist i just talked online for a couple of hours. I decided that i wanted some food so I told chelsea that she was coming with me to McDonalds. Turns out that that plan failed and so I just went inside and slept in MY bed. We got in a huge tickle fight. Yeah thats right im the CHAMPION and youre not bc its my bed. So i left after a couple of hours and then i had to go to work. Boy we were short people tonight  good thing it wasnt busy. Poor linda had to work 15 hours today. Everyone called off and they thought i was goin to when i called and they yelled at me. Oh well i had a really good whopper and fries once again. My mouth hurt for ahwile but then i took 6 Motrin and felt better. So hopefully im posed to get my car back tomorrow. My mom said that shes rushin me over there bc she hates me driving hers....shes mad bc i figured out how to race that bia. Jess came up to work and brought me some food around 9 that was really nice of her thanks Green...so you get a discount. Anyways i came home around 11 to find that Hailey was Iming me about weird stuff...not to mention anything....musta been bored. So im talking to Chelsea yet once again for the who knows how many nights in a row now. :0) thats my crappy smiley so im off to talk and ill post later or maybe tomorrow....ill be one happy spanish if i get my car you have no idea. Apes said shed give me a call to do something so maybe thatll be fun if it happens. Im poor with a hurted mouth so yeah. Later"

We went over to colins to get him to play and it was about to storm. Finally we went over to Austins house where Jenn showed up and the game was on. We played for like 3 hours and i always get skipped. No matter what im always skipped. Jess showed up later and kept the flow or skippage on me so that sucked. I gave up and just went and talked to Amanda. I talked to her like once a month. I talked and slept with her for awhile til i was like bah and decided to go home. 0-120 on Bloomingdale is fun everyone. Just make sure its not raining.

I swear ive eatin there like 20 times so far this summer. I cant get enough French Onion soup. Lauren you got me hooked. We walked around and just talked about things. Girls really know how to make guys feel like a dumbass. We messed with a bunch of things at Brookstone when my mom called and was like boy get yo ass home! so i did. Erica met us back at my house and we chilled here for a bit. Dont knock it. My pts had their little party thing and so i left. Green picked me up and a bunch of us went to putt putt. Instead we played like 5 holes and Joe and me drove some balls instead. I saw Nate up there. I hadnt talked to him in a while. He seems different now. After putt putt we all went to Christinas where Erin is housesitting so its like a free house. We all decided to get some food from everhwere  like chinese to mcds to subway to smoothie king to little caesars  so pretty much every place in bdale square. We went back to Tinas where everyone was dancing and stuff to music while i was trying to fix my sunglasses....bastards i just got em yesterday and the screw it stripped. Someone took a shit and clogged the toilet and Erin had to use her hand to unclog the TP. We think it was Sean but oh well. It was pretty damn disgusting. Chels called me at like 1030 and we talked for a long while. back to how girls make you feel stupid yeah! Amandas bro got in an accident tonight   i guess he just lost control and slammed in a wall. He looked ok so yeah that dimmed things for awhile. We all decided to go cosmic bowling but left to late and never bowled at all. So after Jess and Erin dropped off Cara and Amanda, Sean Joe Stef Jess Erin and me went to Bennigans. We hung out there for quite awhile talking and playing cards and stuff....good times and we waited for the barfight that never happened. Everyone likes it when im tired bc they say im alot funnier bc i have no idea whats goin on. I decided to go to home instead of staying the night. I was hoping that there would be people online but there isnt. everyone is sleeping and i think im just gonna go to bed. I can barely remember what happened today and i hafta work tomorrow.

My next door neighbor like had something bad happen to him and all the ambulances and firetrucks came around 2 am. I hope hes ok bc hes a great guy and plays bball at Illinois. Lauren called me around 230 and we talked for quite awhile. Freaked me out bc i hate when people call unexpectedly. So that was nice i guess but then we hung up and i continued talking to Mike and Chels. 5 came around and it sure felt like 1 or 2 so around 530 i called it quits and went to bed and now i just woke up.

Joe came over around 10 and gave her a lapdance and it was really funny. By then people were swimming and i dont remember alot. CHris degig was breakin screens and stuff and sooner or later there was a water balloon fight and i got slammed with one. The cake was huge with a picture of her face eatin cake on it. As usual i was the first to get some and i ate 3 pieces. I was full the whole night. Around 1 or 2 everyone that wasnt spending the night left. I told colin that i wanted to be the huge black guy that just sat there and moved to the beat. That guy was pimp. Around 2 joe and everyone was telling jokes and we talked about drama and stuff from each school. I had a really good time and Im making new frineds fast now. Jessica Green is the funniest person i know now. Ben left for good around 3 or so and i figured he went over to Aprils. I hope she gets over him soon. shes killin herself. Anyways after that i had some more cake and everyone was downstairs in the living room watching tv layin everywhere. we started watching the play around 4. I had no idea what footloose was about til i watched it. I just knew when i had to be out and such...intersting. Around 5 Ben came back for awhile and surprised us bc we thought it was someone tryin to mess with us. I ate some more cake. Ortegas sister sounds so much like her and it freaked me out big time. Around 6 people were gettin delirious and i started doin cartwheels and handstands and almsot landed on my neck but had no idea what was goin on. People thought i broke something bc they heard a crak and it was ebonis porn takeout dish. Ha good job Holly that was funny. We put in the faculty when ben finally said goobye. His flight was at 630 this morning. That movie sucked so bad that i was pissed off. I told everyone the next time i haer ""what the heezy"" i was gonna kick people. And i did. Ben came back around 6 when he told us that his dad messed up the times and we were all like damn ben jsut leave ~ ha we finished the movie and the sun came out and everyone was sleepin cept joe stacey and me. Joe had an urge to go to steak n shake so we all hopped over there at like 830 this morning and ate breakfast. our server was a real bitch so that sucked. I had a rootbeer float and hot fudge brownie!  BREAKFAST OF CHAMPIONS!!! we got back to Christinas and most of us passed out. Some were takin pictures and stuff and i left around 12 with jess. I left alot out of what happened bc i vaguely remember. I just had a good time and slept til 7 when Lindsey called and said come to cherry's with jenna and mike and her. Im like alright so I went and had no money but got a BIG ONE! Mike must be mad at me or something...eh oh well what can ya do. We drove around adn i was gettin out of the window yellin at people and they wre like ahh...Jenna Linds and me went over to Dans house to hang out with their friends. Not bad. I played pool and we went in the hot tub and played some Ping pong so that was fun. i enjoyed myself and now im really tired so im gonna go to bed soon. hopefully i get my car back tomorrow. At least i get paid too. post tomorrow"

"event","Man i had a fun time today. Erica and I went to Panera and i got a good bowl of French onion soup..mmm i want more. Shes a crazy ass driver and then decided to wake up her friend Chelsea. Their way of getting people to the door is the to yell their names before they ring the doorbell. It was really funny. Her house was nice and I learned my way around Fishhawk today too. Carlos lives across neighborhoods in there so we drove passed and yelled his name. The three of us went driving around and got bored so we just decided to go get Carlos and steal him. We later went o the bank where they splashed me with water and then on to Ericas. We watched Jackass at her house for awhlie and we all had a wrestling match on the bed. It wasnt pretty. So i made a new friend today and shes pretty cool. Around 4 i had to make my way to work where it was dead inside. We got a new manager and hes all geeky and shit. I hate new people bc they never know what the hell they are doing. I talked to Desiree today for the first time in like 2 weeks. Itd been awhle. Theres a bunch of new Pharmacy girls and each of em is pretty good looking. Our store is badass when it comes to girls. The night flew by and no im home just posting."

"event","(IM IN A BAD MOOD SO THIS IS GONNA BE AN UGLY POST)Tonight i talked to Lauren for about 4 hours. It was pointless. She really made me regret being in the relationship. THeres really no point in us trying to be friends. Im not friends with Aimee or Becca still so why should I even try with Lauren. I shouldnt. Ive moved on. She says that ive moved on for all the wrong reasons, but why is it that im happy? Tell me that one genious. You say that ive forgotten when im the one who remembers. Yeah ive finally closed the door. Whos the one who told me to be happy, to move on, and forget about her bc our relationship was bad...thats right Lauren it was you. That was the last time we spent together and I was just trying to love you. You made up your mind on waht you wanted. You were happy with all of the attention you got.  We both know that we couldnt be together. So dont try and make me feel bad for being happy bc im not. I dont need you or your bullshit. I didnt need your moms bullshit. I didnt need our shitty relationship and now that i think about it. I regret most of it like you said and i didnt need it so that i would feel good about myself. I learned how to do that the real way the past 3 weeks. Ive stopped lieing to myself. You asked me what I wanted and so i told you. I would like to be friends but theres no point now. Im happy and if you think its for the wrong reasons think what you want. Im tired of you bringing me down when we talk. I hate talking to you bc all you do is bring up why we arent together or why im over things or stupid shit like that. I want you to be happy again and I want you to be able to talkt o me. I want to talk to you. I still love you for you are but not for your bullshit. Thats why i regret our relationship. NOT for the small things bc we both adored them but for the lying and pretending that we kept goin on for some 8 or 9 odd month. It wasnt worth it. Im glad i shared the things i did with you of what little i remember. Its too hard to remember the good times. We agreed that 80% of our relationship was crap (IM IN A BAD MOOD SO THIS IS GONNA BE AN UGLY POST) Ill prolly regret writing this. Im tired of trying and im tired of talking and theres not a damn thing that can change my mind. Lauren this is all in your hands now. Ive found something better to keep my mind off it. Let me know when you do the same. Sorry im venting to everyone now but hell its 5 fuckin o'clock and she really pissed me off. Im leaving before i can write anything else thats mean. PLease if anyone knows something will help let me know. Let her know. Im tired of this shit. Theres no point. Aimee failed....Becca failed...Lauren prolly will follow suit. FUCK ME  you have really pissed me off Lauren. SOrry again everyone. To make matters worse I have fillings tomorrow along with senior pics. Ive had it. I cant sleep. Screw you!"

It was actually pretty cool and we all played this game. I think it was called cranium and oo man. I was tired. Anywyas i left that and went to work at 4. It wasnt really busy but Casey looked bored to death. Work went by really fast tonight. We ordered a Pizza for dinner and it was really good. It seemed like Large pizzas got smaller....bastards. Anyways I just got home around 1030. It really feels like nothin happened. Kel said shed call me if she was doin anything tonight so maybe ill wait for that. Post later  night"

"event","This will be the longest entry ever! So i left for the play real early today bc it was my last show ever. I really enjoyed doing footloose this year. Ive met some really cool people. It was Hawkins last show at riverview bc hes leaving for NYU monday and gl to him in life. Everyone was taking pictures throughout the night. Around six I had already down one Ciclona(drink of hell) Carlos walked in with his guitar and started playin so that was cool. After our preshow stuff Tania really pissed me off so i wasnt in a good mood for awhile. We had fun gettin ready tonight. It was the last showing of Footloose. What an amazing job accomplished in 2 weeks. Im really gonna miss the people ive met like avery,grace,chelsey,erica,carlos,joe,cat,karina,kristy,steph,matt,ben,kayla,jess,green,vero,and everyone else i prolly left out. I really got to know some of them pretty well. I dont even feel like i know the kids from bdale anymore. Kate and jess never hung out with us once. They always say they werent invited or some bullshit like that....oh well. I didnt even get to talk to april or cara tonight either. I got to know some of the new ambassadors too. Im actually kind of excited for that to happen next year. I really wish i would be able to hang out with the kids from RVHS. So we started the play and it was a really good showing i thought. Right after the opening number i got really upset bc i started thinking about Lauren. All the girls were like whats up and i said bah and tried to forget about it. I was really nervous to go on stage but i enjoyed it. My tumbling was awesome yet again. We all took so many pictures tonight. Avery let me wear her PINK hat and that made me smile. IM not gay(get into that later). In the town council scene, Ben took my glasses and it was really funny. Alot of my friends were there that i had no idea went to the play. Oh well. I saw Dan tonight but its like I dont even know who he is anymore. Same with Austin. What can you do? Anyways the play ended and we took our final bows. it didnt seem like it was over and no one wanted it to be over. It was a great time. We all striked the set and planned on the Cast party over at matts house later that night. I was pretty upset again just bc i dunno why. I really miss Lauren sometimes but she hates me now. I wish she could be my best friend one day just like ben and apes try to do. So on to the cast party we go. I know that ill prolly never see half of thses kids again even though they are like ill call you or whatever. I was still down in the dumps when i got there so i played a game of pool and after that was over everyone had arrived. Christina told me to enjoy myself whlie i had time to. I was sittin by myself for awhile until this girl asked me to come over to where she was. So i went over tehre and we talked and got to know each other. It was nice. I think we were both attracted to each other but i didnt know what to think for a bit(more later) I sat around talking to Avery for a bit until Chris decided to go into the pool splashing everyone. Matts house was really nice and fun. Everyone seemed like they were having a good time. Avery Grace Hailey? and Chelsey left around 12 and we all said our goodbyes. They are the sweetest girls by far that were in the play. Im gonna miss them. So i decided to get into the hot tub and stay there for 2 hours. I felt like a retarded rubberband afterwards. oh man let me tell you. It was Karina and Kristy and me in there for a long time. They are cool people to talk to. The Green monster decided to be mean to me and asked me if i wanted a drink so i was like sure and she got my worst enemy. MTN DEW! that stuff is dangerous to your teeth. THats why i have so many cavities. Hell you know that i drank that shit so yeah. Apes Kase and Cara left around 1 and i think that was the first time i talked to them all night maybe. oh shit i forgot about my boy. Carlos is awesome. He said we were gonna ""pick up some hookers along 301"" soon and prolly chill out at Warped. Im lookin foward to that. Erica said shed talk to me later but never did. Ill miss her too.ALex and Jess left soon after that. Jess had to have been the nicest person out of everyone next to Avery. My hottub friends left around 130 so the crowd was dwindling. It was Ortega,amanda,jess,erin,ebs,ben,cara,stacey,and me left there around 2 so we decided to go to mcdonalds for some food. mmm yum. I ordered 4 hamburgers and a large fry. I ran out of bens car bc i was gettin carsick and almost threw up in the bushes. I walked up to Ebonis car and they were makin fun of me so i went around and pinched Christina and then she chased after me. we were outside when these huge ass bugs started flyin around us. i mean these things were like lemon sized cockroaches with pinchers or claw fuckin things on em and were gross as shit or something. Cara was sleepin the whole time but ooo wait. At Kings and Lumsden for all yall valrico/brandon folk you know waht im talking about. We saw this bum walkin across the street and its like 230 in the morning and i see Cara run up and open our door and we all flipped out. Ben and i yelled so fast and freaked out while amanda. right tehre at the door was lookin like she was a gonna kick some ass. it was really funny but shoo that was great. I think mcds was the best part of my night. We all ate on the Green monsters truck bed and good times. So back to the gay thing. Eboni was videotapin us bc i think this is like her last time here before she leaves for NYU gl to her too. anyways they got on tape of me saying ""IM GAY!""  and then i took that camera and was like shit i aint gay eff that. and  yeah it was funnny soo no im not gay people. and we were trying to get ebs to do the carlton but that failed.   for minute we thought ben had one of those bugs in his salad so he screeched so loud ooo man good times. it was coochie time posedly and then i guess we all said our goodbyes and left. On to aprils we go  we go hidy ho yeah! this girl in a jeep decided to tail us and be a real bitch to us. jess and ben had a honking fight and it was fun. ON the way to brentwood hills that girl tried to get ben to hit her so we passed that skank and she flicked us off. WHATA BITCH! you know whats up. WE got to aprils house and everyone was liek asleep there. so much for sofority. Cara was online and apes was asleep. everyone seemed like in a bad mood since we had gotten tehre. it was about 3am when we did get tehre. We watched some videos and a Police show and that was that. I didnt wanna stay bc i felt sick anyways. thats what 4 hamburgers do to you. so dont eat em. ever. never. whatever. Ben and i left around 4 and we had a good talk on the way home. Cara and Kase kicked me out so that ben and apes didnt talk alone outside. weird bah. Anyways ben asked me about lauren and i told him that i really wanna be friends and we both know wahts up and it will be hard. him and apes and me and lj....i miss her alot. i still love her even though she hates me. what can i do? nothin so oh well. I really wish that i could talk to her right now too but i cant. anyway ben leaves for NY on monday so i wish him luck with that and for good luck in life. hes an awesome guy and im gonna miss him. When I got home my pts were just gettin in too..weird eh so yeah now theres 3 fuckin racecars here bc a drunk friend is here and no one leaves and drives drunk eveer. Im bummed about my car still but anyways its been one hella night and im gonna miss everything. This post wasnt as long as teh one i did b4 my comp froze but much love to everyone tonight. Im gonna miss Footloose and i hope we'll all meet again. Its summer and its the time of our lives just bc its been a grand time. Much love people. Ill finish this shit later so night everyone.

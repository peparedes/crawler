"event","I live in fremont.  I remember over the summer my dad and I had just finished watching judge judy (hey, its what we do) and the news came on.  I decided to stay and watch.  The funniest guy ever was on.

Time flew by and I was browsing the internet and found not only the actual recording of this hilarious guy from oakland, but also some fan made crap that people actually took the time to make!

"event","So late last night, I got kind of bored.  I was walking through the hallways and was looking at matts picture of him with a diaper on his head, and thought to myself, wouldnt it be funny if i scanned it and photoshoped it a bit.  So I did.  Now please, just note, these are for fun only and should not be taken seriously.  Matt in no way posed for any of these pictures, and they are only here for cheap laughs.  Hardeeharhar.      Enjoy!

PS.  If matt ever wishes for me to remove this, I will.

So this was my first attempt, not my best, but still pretty funny.  I call it..

This one is my personal favorite, and I call it, ""All I want is Love""

Thats it for todays episode of Photoshop Phun!  Trust me, there will be plenty more where this came from!"

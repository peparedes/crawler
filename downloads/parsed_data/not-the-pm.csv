"event","A bunch of people are gone for the weekend, including Dory and Silvia.  Apparently some members of Lucius Malfoy's extended family are getting married and all the relatives and family connections have to be there to celebrate.  I wonder what wizard weddings are like?  The Jewish students went home too, for some kind of religious holiday.
The people who went home aren't missing much.  The house-elves are on strike or something, the library is a shambles, and we had porridge for breakfast instead of the usual variety of things.  It seems the combined magical expertise of the Hogwarts faculty only goes so far.  Or maybe they all heard the story of the Sorcerer's Apprentice when they were growing up and are afraid that any magical efforts at cleaning the place up would backfire horribly.  I suppose I could ask Dylan this Sunday, if I see him at tea again and he isn't too busy talking to other people.  He takes Housewitchery, so he should know.  I can also ask him if Magistra Gardiner wants any more help.  Even if I wouldn't be much use for magical things at this point, there's probably lots of chopping and stirring that needs doing, and I'm <u>good</u> at that sort of thing.  It would be interesting learning to cook for lots and lots of people, since the most I've ever cooked for at once before was ten.

There's a new girl in Ravenclaw.  She's few years older than me and comes from some country where they don't speak English.  I wonder if she's a refugee.  She might be related to the Malfoys somehow, since she left with them this weekend.  She's doesn't look very Malfoyish, but aristocrats have relatives all over the map, so it's certainly possible."

"event","Hebrew is not an easy language.  How on Earth did all the ancient Israelites manage?  It must be easier if you grow up using it and don't get used to things like the English alphabet first.
I've been trying to teach Nelvana to fetch, but not with much luck.  I suppose an opossum in the wild wouldn't have the incentive to chase after things that a dog or cat would, since they're mostly scavengers.  She'd probably be more interested if it was something she could eat, but that wouldn't make the prefects very happy.  Especially since this is wartime and we're supposed to conserve food, not toss it around our bedrooms or the common room.
I don't know whether to hope that the people in charge know more than they're telling us.  It would be nice if <u>somebody</u> knew what was going on, but it's very frustrating being kept in the dark.  How can anyone solve a mystery without any knowledge of the evidence?  Well, I suppose that a detective with brilliant insights into human nature could, by interviewing all the suspects and finding the holes in their stories.  I'm not even sure that the bad guys here are human."

"event","Asher Greengrass wasn't in Transfiguration today.  I don't think he'd have missed it on purpose, since he's very good at it and seems to get on so well with Professor Dumbledore.  Maybe Elisa knows what's going on with him.
I heard that Hamish's big brother is going to be teaching some extracurricular classes.  (I wonder what Miss Abbott thinks about <u>that</u>?)  Sounds interesting, although I don't know exactly what they'll involve yet.  Edmund Diggory is very nice, and new knowledge is always useful.
Constable Forester is still here at Hogwarts investigating.  Do Mounties always get their Unknown Sinister Forces?  I hope so.  It's rather nice having another Canadian around, even if we don't actually know each other.  I'd like to meet him properly some time, when he's not too busy doing Mountie things, but it probably wouldn't be a good idea to introduce Nelvana and his wolf, even if they are both expatriate Canadian wildlife.
At this point I've decided to postpone any solo scientific expeditions until the Unknown Sinister Forces are discovered and defeated.  At least I'm waiting until we get a good idea of what we're dealing with and how to protect ourselves (and I've taken more than one Defence class).  I don't believe in living in fear, but that doesn't mean I'm going to be stupid on purpose."

"event","I can't believe that I've only been here a week and a day!  Last Wednesday, the only impending doom I was <u>remotely</u> worried about involved an imaginary rowboat tipping over on an imaginary aquatic research expedition.  Now we have to deal with Unknown Sinister Forces for <u>real</u>.  It turns out that this sort of thing is more exciting to read about than to live through.

I've been trying to think of recipes that don't use too much of what Dylan told me has become harder to get around here.  People around here need cheering up under the current circumstances, and baking is the best way I can do this.  Let's hope Miss Abbott won't object too much."

"event","I thought that Miss Abbott was possibly a bit off, with her notions of sinister culinary conspiracies, but it seems that other Houses have been having more serious leadership problems.  A couple of the Ravenclaw prefects had to hand their badges in at breakfast today.  I wonder if it has anything to do with Claire Jeannot (the missing Ravenclaw girl) being found dead.

We're also having an Inquisition here at school, whatever that is.  It doesn't seem to be the Spanish kind, which I'm very glad about, since I'm not Catholic and a lot of the other students aren't either.  Apparently it involves drills and keeping track of where our roommates are so that they don't wind up going off on their own and getting killed.  This all seems sensible enough.  Maybe it just has a scary title so people will take it more seriously.  I hope my friends in Ravenclaw are being careful."

"event","I'm beginning to suspect that this place isn't very well-regulated.  First there was that mess with the boats last week and one of the students not being where he should be (have they found out anything about that yet?) and now one of the big girls in Ravenclaw has wound up dead in the lake!  I hope Elisa, Anjali, Dylan and Mercuria are all right.

Maybe the lake is cursed somehow.  But if it was, wouldn't someone have noticed by now?  This needs more investigation."

It has been an interesting and enjoyable weekend.

Nelvana and I went exploring on Saturday and <u>finally</u> got a good look around the library.  It's a fascinating place!  I went looking for the mysterious migratory card catalogues with Elisa Miller and Anjali Patil, and also met Mercuria Casaubon and Jonathan Dashwood, although we didn't talk for very long.  

I've finally met someone else interested in baking!  His name is Dylan Mulciber, and he's a few years older than me and a Ravenclaw.  (Elisa, Anjali, and Mercuria are Ravenclaws too, I think.  I wonder if this means anything.)  I like him a lot, but I don't think Miss Abbott the prefect does.  She seemed to suspect him of being behind some sort of villainous cooking-related plot and trying to involve me in it.  Either that, or she simply has a very strange way of expressing herself.

I've also found yet more evidence that British Wizards Are Not Like Canadians (at least, not like Canadian Muggles).  I knew that they were before, of course, given the magic, and the classical names, and the fact that some of them don't seem to have cleaned out their closets since the 17th century.  But apparently the differences in customs go further than that.  If I understand the conversation correctly, Dylan's sweetheart is another boy, and another couple of boys are <u>actually engaged</u>.

This makes a certain amount of sense, if your criteria for wanting to marry someone is ""the person you like best in the world who isn't already family,"" but I have no idea how it works out in practice.</lj-cut>"

"event","It has been Quite a Week.
School started on Tuesday, and the first order of business was to assign all the new students to their Houses.  This involved making us all try on a talking hat that analyses people's personalities.  I wonder if wizard psychiatrists have anything like it?  It seems like it would save a lot of time and trouble.  Do wizards and witches even have psychiatrists?  They'd probably need something like them.  From what I've seen so far of my fellow students and the faculty here, magical people don't necessarily have it together any better than regular people back home.  There must be <u>something</u>, because the government wouldn't want crazy people running around with wands.

Anyway, Nelvana and I wound up here in Hufflepuff.  My housemates seem really nice so far, although I don't know anyone very well yet.  I've been busy enough just with school stuff and trying not to get lost!

I'm studying <u>three</u> different languages right now, and two of them don't even have an alphabet I'm used to.  At this point it's the best I can do to just keep everything sorted out in my head, but it should be lots of fun once I learn enough to actually read things.  I'll be able to travel around Greece and Rome and the Holy Land and decipher ancient inscriptions like they were magazine ads!  Although if I really want to do that I'll have to study hieroglyphics as well.

We're studying real magic along with all the languages.  I think Charms is the most interesting, but my best subject is probably Herbology. 

I've heard that there's a giant squid in the lake, although I haven't seen it.  For all I know, there may be all kinds of interesting creatures living in there.  If I had a glass-bottomed rowboat (with a don't-tip-over charm that <u>actually works</u>) I'd take it out this weekend and investigate.

In the meantime, now that I know that Hogwarts has access to all sorts of ingredients that are normally rationed, I need to look into ways of acquiring some for myself and getting access to cooking facilities.  It's been a long time since I had a chance to properly bake."

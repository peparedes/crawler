"event","Like last year, I would like to continue this new found tradition of mine and just list some of the things that I am thankful for. I know I could never list all the things that I am thankful for but I guess the things I list are the things most important to me right now.
I am thankful for:
~ My faith and the best gift of all that God has given us, Jesus
~ My parents, who support me and give me more than I ever hoped to deserve and have given me the best life I could imagine
~ My brother, who also spoils me like crazy and is a great role model and the fact that he will now only be 30 minutes away after this semester
~ The rest of my family, who always cares about my life no matter how long it's been since they last saw me and again, like to spoil me
~ My amazing friends, who always make me feel happy and have helped me get through college and given me so many fond memories, as well as always laughing at me as I laugh by myself :D
~ Living in a house/dorm
~ Having AC and Heat in my house/dorm
~ Going to UNC-Chapel Hill, a great university where there is a good balance of academics and a great student life
~ Big warm sweaters
~ Cosmic Cantina, The Yogurt Pump, and Gumby's (especially Pokey Sticks)
~ Free movies at the Student Union
~ My hallmates, who are always so much fun (like ultimate frisbee, poker, eating food, watching movies)
~ Buses that take you to the Harris Teeter in Chapel Hill
~ Outta Here
~ Computers
~ Blankets
~ The gym
~ AP and IB credit at UNC
~ Music and the composers who create it and the performers who play it
~ Ruckus
~ Graduating from high school
~ Having my own bathroom and room at home
~ This nation that gave my family a chance to start a new life here and offers so many freedoms not offered in so many other countries
~ All the troops who serve this country dutifully, whether they support the cause or not
~ Love

Well I hope everyone had a great Thanksgiving! And there is less than a month till this semester is over! Quotes are from MIB this time:
~[to candidates rejected as MIB agents] 
Zed: Gentlemen, congratulations. You're everything we've come to expect from years of government training.

~Elle: Hey, Jay! Zed called. The high consulate from Solaxiant 9 wants floor seats for the next Bulls game. 
Jay: All right, let's put in a call to Dennis Rodman. He's from that planet. 
Elle: Rodman? You're kidding. 
Jay: Nope. 
Elle: Not much of a disguise. 

~Beatrice: You here to make fun of me too? 
Kay: No, ma'am. We at the FBI do not have a sense of humor we're aware of. May we come in? 
Beatrice: Sure."

"event","Well I have now been at school for over a month...and I must say it has been great. I've enjoyed almost all of it except for math homework and the thought of upcoming midterms. But there's plenty of other things to make up for that. Like having almost all of Friday free to traverse the campus with Jennifer and have movie marathons. I think our record is 5 1/2 movies. And of course our workouts at the gym, especially funk and butts, gutts, and thigh class. Then there's our Friday night cooking experiments and DE ;) And I must not forget the many interesting, yet fun nights with my hallmates...playing poker and all sorts of other games two or three times a week and of course playing ultimate frisbee until 2:30 am. Go minorities! I have also really enjoyed ballroom dancing...especially the tango. (Hannah makes for a good guy ;) and I still haven't ever had to dance the lead part which is quite an accomplishment.) There are still so many other fun experiences (like running all the way from Franklin street to Jennifer's dorm for a TV show and squished car rides to and from school) but I would be going on forever. Well it's nice to be home now for the weekend and be spoiled by my parents :) Whenever I come back to Charlotte it feels like I have not been away for more than a few days, which makes me realize just how important it is to come home and how much I love it. Well that's all for now...just hoping I do well on my midterms and all those who have to take midterms soon as well. 
Quotes are from Thank You For Smoking:
~Jeff Megall: Sony has a futuristic sci-fi movie they're looking to make. 
Nick Naylor: Cigarettes in space? 
Jeff Megall: It's the final frontier, Nick. 
Nick Naylor: But wouldn't they blow up in an all oxygen environment? 
Jeff Megall: Probably. But it's an easy fix. One line of dialogue. 'Thank God we invented the... you know, whatever device.' 

~Joey Naylor: Dad, why is the American government the best government? 
Nick Naylor: Because of our endless appeals system. 

~Joey Naylor: [as Nick comes to speak to Joey's class about his job] Please don't ruin my childhood."

"event","So I have now been in Carolina for a week, and I must say it was better than I expected. The people here are great and all the activities on campus have been fun and I'm really just enjoying everything here. The classes seem more like they will be interesting and not as much work as back in IB. Also, I placed out of English 101 which was a great relief to me and I got the piano lessons that I auditioned for. So all in all things have worked out for the best for me and I look forward to the next few years here. I could go on with more little details but I don't think anybody would care to read them and I don't feel like writing that much so I shall end it here.
Quotes are from V for Vendetta:
~Delia Surridge: [Her last lines] Is it too late to ask for forgiveness? 
V: Never. 
Delia Surridge: I'm sorry. 

~Evey Hammond: My father was a writer. You would've liked him. He used to say that artists use lies to tell the truth while politicians use them to cover it up. 
V: A man after my own heart. 

~Evey Hammond: Who are you? 
V: Who? Who is but the form following the function of what, and what I am is a man in a mask. 
Evey Hammond: Well I can see that. 
V: Of course you can. I'm not questioning your powers of observation, I'm merely remarking upon the paradox of asking a masked man who he is."

"event","Well after I posted yesterday, I went to celebrate Caroline's birthday which was fun. We watched Rumor Has It, which is one of the worst movies I've seen but afterward we shared a ton of middle school and high school memories which was so much fun. On the way home though, when we (Sangeeta, Priya, and I) stopped at a stoplight, we looked over and Hannah and Max were in the car next to us. It was definitely freaky...that was twice in one day that I came across Hannah totally by chance which is very rare since we live so far apart. Well pulled into some church parking lot and talked for a little bit but then it rained and kinda ruined that. But of course we can't forget Max's, ""girl, give me yo digits"" or something like that. Well today was mostly spent helping the parents clean the house for guests tonight and then I went off to Elizabeth's to eat Chinese once again and watch Nanny McPhee with Armanda as well. It was an entertaining movie which I enjoyed, mostly because Colin Firth was in it, but it was all good. Well I don't have much planned for this upcoming week so if you want to do something just let me know.
Quotes are from Just Like Heaven:
~David Abbott: You were right, she's alive! 
Darryl: Righteous 
David Abbott: But her family is going to turn off her life support. 
Darryl: Not so righteous. 

~David Abbott: I don't think your sister's a very spiritual person. 
Elizabeth Martinson: She's just trying to be a good parent and keep her kids away from a crazy man."

"event","So today I went to help at the church my mom works at by stuffing bulletins with a sheet and stapling more sheets. Anyways, this older couple helped me stuff the bulletins and, well the old guy was interesting. When his wife left to get a box he complained about her to me and then asked me where I was going for school and what I wanted to study. I obviously said Carolina and I want to study business. When I said that he said, ""Wow so you got accepted and everything""...like I would go to a college where I wasn't accepted, but I'm pretty sure he was joking. Anywho, he then said, ""Do you know another name for Business administration?"" and I said, ""um......no"" and he said ""Jewish engineering"" which I thought was quite clever and I even laughed. Then his wife came back and asked me where I was going and before I could say anything the guy said, ""She's going to Carolina to study medicine. She's going to become a doctor and practice in Cuba."" So what was I supposed to do??? I just didn't say anything and laughed to myself some more. Then after working there I went to Bruegger's and Caribou for lunch and surprise surprise, I saw Hannah! Or rather she honked at me as I walked on and then yelled at me and then I finally saw her. So we had lunch together, bought batteries and I saw a friend of hers at Starbucks although I doubt he saw me...oh and Hannah's car handle broke which was kinda funny and bad at the same time. Anywho, it was just a nice surprise to have lunch with Hannah again out of the blue and listen to an old man's interesting comments. 
Quotes are from Mulan and Emma:
Mulan
~Mulan: Would you like to stay for dinner? 
Grandmother Fa: Would you like to stay forever?

~Mushu: My little baby's all grown up and... 
Mushu: [sniffle] ... and savin' China. 

Emma
~Mr. Knightley: I rode through the rain! I'd - I'd ride through worse than that if I could just hear your voice telling me that I might, at least, have some chance to win you. 

~Mr. Knightley: Maybe it is our imperfections which make us so perfect for one another. 

~Emma: Mr. Knightley, if I have not spoken, it is because I am afraid I will awaken myself from this dream."

"event","Well since I last wrote I went to Philly and came back and then went to orientation. Philadelphia was everything a history dork like me could hope for. I spent a whole day there just looking at all the historic sites plus I had my Philly cheesesteak. Valley Forge was pretty cool too, but there's not much to do there except drive around the park and look at monuments. Orientation on the other hand was just alright. It wasn't that much fun and most of the time I was just anxious to sign up for classes since I thought there would be no good classes left. But luckily I got all the classes I wanted, plus some...I would write down my schedule but it might change so I'm not going to waste my time. However I do like my schedule now as I will only have one class on Wednesday and Fridays and they're at 9 so I have the rest of the day to do nothing, so I'm really hoping that won't change. Other than that I've just been hanging out with friends and chilling at home. I've hung out with Sangeeta (we went crazy with the digital camera), Hannah (""We're not really a Starbucks, we just sell their coffee and have the same menu and have their logo on everything""), Christina (Disney songs rock my socks), Sal (tennis is awesome), Daniel (Band of Brothers is great but Family Guy not so much), and I plan to hang out with Priyanka, Woody, Armanda, and more of the same people for the rest of summer as well. I've seen so many movies over this summer so it's hard to choose one for quotes but I'll try. By the way, I really really like the new Pride and Prejudice movie, and I must confess I like this Mr. Darcy more than Colin Firth's Darcy. I know this will shock many, but I had to get it out. Amanda no longer has Firthitis.
Quotes are from different movies this time:
Pride and Prejudice:
~Mr. Darcy: You must know... surely, you must know it was all for you. You are too generous to trifle with me. I believe you spoke with my aunt last night, and it has taught me to hope as I'd scarcely allowed myself before. If your feelings are still what they were last April, tell me so at once. My affections and wishes have not changed, but one word from you will silence me forever. If, however, your feelings have changed, I will have to tell you: you have bewitched me, body and soul, and I love, I love, I love you. I never wish to be parted from you from this day on. 

Taxi:
~Belle: We've gotta play to your strengths. And thinkin ain't one of them. 

Pirates of the Caribbean 2:
~Jack Sparrow: So what's your plan? 
Will Turner: I row over, search the ship until I find your bloody key. 
Jack Sparrow: And if there are crewmen? 
Will Turner: I cut down anyone in my path. 
Jack Sparrow: I like it. Simple, easy to remember. 

~Elizabeth Swann: There will come a time when you have a chance to do the right thing. 
Jack Sparrow: I love those moments. I like to wave at them as they pass by."

~Jack Taylor: Maggie, when you grow up and are incredibly beautiful and intelligent and possess a certain sweetness that's... that's like a distant promise to the brave, to the worthy, could you please not beat to a pulp every miserable bastard that comes your way simply because you can? Could you not do that? 
Maggie Taylor: Okay Daddy.

~Jack: You know what my mother used to say to me? 
Melanie: Gee, no, what? 
Jack: Love your guy like a little boy and he'll grow into a man. 
Melanie: So she knew back then that you were gay? 

~Melanie: Your Peter Pan complex is so 90s. 
Jack: What Peter Pan complex? 
Melanie: The one you're so proud of. 
Jack: Do you have any friends? 
Melanie: I don't have time for friends.

I was cleaning out all my school stuff, but it wasn't as hard as previous years. I gladly chucked all of Ms. Shuping's stuff in the trash along with all my stuff from Abbott, Demera, Dr. D, and Franklin. But I found an awesome quote I had from my passage of Phantom of the Opera that I used for the book review exam in Berini's last year: ""Music has the power to abolish everything in the outside world except its sounds, which go straight to the heart...and new music that gave a strange impression of gentleness, languor, and peace, music that stirred my soul, then gradually soothed it and led it to the threshold of a dream."" (You know I had to put that in there since I love music so much!) Well, on other interesting news, I found my housing assignment and roommate. I'll be at Carmichael and my roommate seems to be pretty cool and nice. Well, a week from today we'll be graduating, and then it's on to bigger and better things.
Quotes are from Spinal Tap:

~Lt. Hookstratten: May I start by saying how thrilled we are to have you here. We are such fans of your music and all of your records. I'm not speaking of yours personally, but the whole genre of the rock and roll. 

~Derek Smalls: We're lucky. 
David St. Hubbins: Yeah. 
Derek Smalls: I mean, people should be envying us, you know. 
David St. Hubbins: I envy us. 
Derek Smalls: Yeah. 
David St. Hubbins: I do. 
Derek Smalls: Me too. 

~David St. Hubbins: Well, I'm sure I'd feel much worse if I weren't under such heavy sedation. 

~David St. Hubbins: Dozens of people spontaneously combust each year. It's just not really widely reported. 

~[Nigel Tufnel is showing Marty DiBergi one of his favorite guitars] 
Nigel Tufnel: The sustain, listen to it. 
Marty DiBergi: I don't hear anything. 
Nigel Tufnel: Well you would though, if it were playing."

It's been kinda nice not doing anything in school, although I wish Mr. Layton would let us play hangman on the board...I mean, he's not using it. Well this weekend has just been nice. For the first time in a long time I was able to read for pleasure and I actually preferred reading over spending time in front of the computer or watching TV. Also I went to a family picnic with other Catholic families, which may sound boring to most, but it was just so nice to be with other wonderful, loving families. I also managed to finish another project this weekend, so that's two down and two more to go. The best part about it though was that I actually enjoyed working on this project and the last one since I got to work with friends. Well I don't have many plans for the coming weeks, other than graduation and family stuff, so if you want to do something, let me know.

~Sangeeta arriving late as usual and leaving her stuff all over my house
~Her and Daniel both forgetting their prom tickets
~My mom continuously talking to me in her mommy voice saying over and over again ""have fun"" and ""you look great""
~Riding in a limo with Sal where our driver was Albanian and didn't understand our directions half the time
~Taking pictures at both my and Sal's house
~Dinner at Campania and the deflated pasta
~Avoiding most teachers at prom, especially Abbott and Mrs. Franklin

Not that the exams have been extremely difficult or anything, but they make me realize how sometimes even after sitting in a class for a year,  it still won't fully prepare me for these exams, no matter how hard I try. But despite the two exams today, English and Statistics, hanging out with two of my best friends totally made it worth it. So now our list may expand tenfold Sangeeta! One cannot forget the lady at Subway who doesn't speak English, singing to songs we don't know the words to, or Sangeeta pumping gas by herself for the first time. Oh and of course getting free Starbucks coffee from Hannah. (Muchas gracias mi barista favorita.) Well tomorrow I have school, which will seem nice after these last two days, and then the biology exam on Thursday and Friday. And then Saturday is prom, finally! I'm so excited! Well that's it for now. I'm afraid I have to do some biology hw now as Mrs. Franklin thinks we can still learn new information the same week as our final exam. But this is no big surprise.

~Jessica Rabbit: I'm not bad. I'm just drawn that way.

~Mrs. Herman: Mommy's going to the beauty parlor, darling, but I'm leaving you with your favorite friend, Roger. He's going to take very, very good care of you, because if he doesn't... HE'S GOING BACK TO THE SCIENCE LAB. 

~Eddie Valiant: This singing ain't my line/ It's hard to make a rhyme/If I get stuck, I'm... I'm out of luck, I'm... 
Jessica Rabbit: I'm running out of time. 
Eddie Valiant: Thanks.

Also, one more week until IB and AP exams, which isn't the most fun thing to do, but at least I'll barely have to go to school for May. It's hard to believe we only have a month and a half left. It seems the only thing we talk about now is where everyone is going for college and prom. Well I have decided to go to UNC-Chapel Hill and I'll most likely live on North campus or at Carmichael on Middle campus. I may not be as crazy about the school as others are, but I think I'll be happy there and I'll be able to see a lot of my friends still, which is good. As for prom, it sure has been an interesting road getting there, but I am very happy with my date and I know it will be a great night. I only wish more of my friends were going, but we'll make it up somehow. Life in general though is great right now. I actually have a few free weekends, and I've started jogging again which feels really good. Oh, and I went to the school musical yesterday, The Fantasticks, which I thought was cute, except the singing could be a little bit better, but overall, it was a job well done. Well I hope to update more often, but we'll see...
Quotes will be from The Godfather (thanks Sal for recommending it):

~Calo: In Sicily, women are more dangerous than shotguns.

~[Tessio brings in Luca Brasi's bulletproof vest, delivered with a fish inside] 
Sonny: What the hell is this? 
Tessio: It's a Sicilian message. It means Luca Brasi sleeps with the fishes. 

~Don Corleone: I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse.

~[to his associate, who has killed Paulie in the car] 
Clemenza: Leave the gun.

Clemenza: Take the cannolis"

"event","This was one of the best weekends I have had in a while. It may not seem great to some people, but it was the little things that made it so great for me and I wish I could have spent more weekends like this with my friends. Well, on Friday, after picking up those dreadful little things that we call our World Lit. papers I went to Starbucks to meet Hannah, Daniel, and Elena, although I didn't drink anything since everything there goes against my dietary restrictions. Well then Hannah and Elena had to leave so Daniel and I were trying to fill the time between then and soccer and just walked around the shopping center twice and went inside Party Land where we made fun of the over the hill decorations. We then proceeded to go to the park for soccer although Daniel took the shortcut without telling me, so I showed up later but that didn't really matter since nobody else showed up. So Daniel and I just took shots and passed the ball and I found out how much I sucked. He also showed me how to kick the ball right which is really sad that I'm figuring this out now after my last season of soccer. Oh well, it was a lot of fun and during the hour and a half we were there I got 4 calls from Elizabeth about what were going to do that evening which was muy divertido. So after soccer, Daniel and I were trying to pass each other, safely of course, until we went our separate ways and I headed for Elizabeth's house. At Elizabeth's house we talked until Armanda and Priyanka came and then went out for some Chinese food and to rent Love Actually. Walking into Blockbuster, the four of us saw Coach Simmons, who is the PE coach for 3 of us and I was strutting because we had just listened to rap and unfortunately I believe Coach Simmons saw me. Oh well, as we were driving off Armanda and I were dancing to rap in the car and I believe Coach Simmons saw us do that as well as he told us to have a safe weekend, which just added to fun of the night. Once we got back to Elizabeth's house we ate our food on the floor and watched Love Actually. I don't know how many times I said awwwwww, but I'm sure it was a lot. 
After the movie I went home because the on Saturday I had to go work at Christina's house for our Group IV project. So at Christina's I would like to say we did some work, but not really. Her internet connection was bad so we just talked and ate Samoas and sang Disney songs and played the piano. Priyanka and I did our best to convince Christina she should go to prom but first we need to get her date. I believe Priyanka and Elizabeth are working on that. It sounds stupid, but it was so much fun. Then I came home and did nothing until my family and I went to mass and then to Mr. Fisher's house to celebrate his birthday. That may also sound dorky but it was a lot of good fun and we also played Texas Hold Em in which case I believe I won the most money. It's something that just runs in the family. Well today was pretty laid back, I've done barely any homework and a lot of relaxing and I just wish every weekend could be like this. I would just like to say as well that I have such awesome, amazing friends. Unfortunately the next two weekends will be spent at Carolina and Wake for scholarship interviews and I won't get to enjoy them with my friends, but I'm definitely glad to have this experience and I hope I do well. Quotes are from Love Actually:
~Jamie: It's my favorite time of day, driving you. 
Aurelia: [in Portuguese] It is the saddest part of my day, leaving you. 

~[to a portrait of Margaret Thatcher] 
Prime Minister: Did you ever have this kind of problem? Yeah - of course you did, you saucy minx. 

~Mark: But for now, let me say - Without hope or agenda - Just because it's Christmas - And at Christmas you tell the truth - To me, you are perfect - And my wasted heart will love you - Until you look like this

I've also found out that now I'm a finalist for 3 scholarships, 2 at Chapel Hill and 1 at Wake, and my first ""interview"" is tomorrow. Although it's more a group discussion and not so much an interview. Well I haven't been this happy in a while. Right now, life is really good and I expect it to be like this for the rest of the year.

~Viola De Lesseps: [to her Nurse] I will have poetry in my life. And adventure. And love. Love above all. No... not the artful postures of love, not playful and poetical games of love for the amusement of an evening, but love that... over-throws life. Unbiddable, ungovernable - like a riot in the heart, and nothing to be done, come ruin or rapture. Love - like there has never been in a play."

We stay at my grandparent's house, buy Cuban pastries from Vicki's Bakery, prepare a whole pig, cook it, and eat it on Nochebuena (Christmas Eve), then go to midnight mass, then the rest of the time it is just chilling with my cousins and grandparents. This year was fun as usual, except the excitement that usually surrounds this time of the year didn't seem to be as great. It came and went so quickly that it didn't feel special. Also, the fact that this was the first year where my paternal grandmother was not at our Christmas party was hard. She is still alive but her condition is not good. I was just glad that I was able to see her again. As for gifts, I didn't get anything super exciting, just nice stuff that I was glad to get. Well since I don't have much else to say, I'll end with quotes from the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air since my brother bought the first season and it's hilarious.

~Vivian: [about Hilary's purpose of going to college] We just want you to be all you can be. 
Hilary: You want me to join the army? 
Phillip Banks: Let's try this again. 

~Philip Banks: Will, I want the best for Ashley. When I was young I loved classical music, but my parents could never afford lessons. I would stand in parking lot outside the Phil Harmonic, hoping to catch a spare note in the night air. 
Vivian Banks: Philip, when I met you, you were into James Brown. 
Will: [laughing] He liked James Brown? 
Vivian Banks: He even wore his hair like him. 
Will: [laughing harder] He had hair? 

~Will: Roses are red, violets are blue, Jazz and I are black but Carlton what are you? 

~Hilary: Congratulate me. It took all day, but I finally found the perfect pair of alligator pumps to wear to the Save the Everglades dinner tonight."

As it is Thanksgiving Day, I would like to write down some of the things I am thankful for, although I could never presume to write them all down since I have been so blessed, but here it goes. I am thankful for:
~My faith and the best gift of all that God has given us, Jesus
~My parents who have supported me through so much and provide for me in more ways than I deserve
~My brother who is always great to talk to and a great source for awesome music, and yes, Rachel as well who is a great example of a good Catholic woman
~The rest of my family who have also been there to share in all my joys and triumphs as well as through the sad and difficult times
~A home to come to with enough food for every meal, plus some
~My church, which has a great youth program that has helped me grow stronger in my faith, as well as helping me become more active in the community
~Amazing friends, who always listen to me, no matter how stupid I can be, who help me with homework and personal problems, and who are with me through the good and bad times
~A great boyfriend who has given me so many wonderful and happy moments these past few months
~This nation, who gave my family a chance and gave us the freedoms that would have been denied to us in Cuba
~Our armed forces who fight for this nation whether they believe in the cause or not
~My talents 
~A great school that offers the IB program (I know it doesn't seem great but it's one of the best high school education someone can get)
~Central heat, having warm clothes, and blankets
~Computers and phones
~Music and the instruments that create it and the composers who compose it
~That my grandmother is still alive and even if she dies within the next few days, I'm thankful that she was in my life
~Love

Well there's so much more I could say, but I would be here for a couple more days, so now I'll end with quotes from some of the movies I've seen within this past week - thanks to Sangeeta ;) 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire 
Ron Weasley: Do you think we'll ever have a quiet year at Hogwarts? 
Hermione Granger: No. 
Ron Weasley: Oh well, what's life, without a few dragons? 

Office Space
[Peter, Michael and Samir are trying to figure out how to launder money]

Earlier this year I had thought that things were going to suck but now I feel like I've never been happier. I only wish all my other friends were as happy as I am. Well my main source of happiness stems from the fact that I am going out with such an awesome guy. Plus my college application for Chapel Hill is practically done and will be sent out soon. And despite all the work at school nowadays, it doesn't seem so bad, especially since I've learned how to get B's and be happy with them. Well now for quotations, which are from Pocahontas this time.

~John Smith: I'd rather die tomorrow than live a hundred years without knowing you. 

~Governor Ratcliffe: Wiggins, why do you think those insolent heathens attacked us? 
Wiggins: Because we invaded their land and cut down their trees and dug up their earth? 

~Wiggins: Hurry now, Percy. We must be all squeaky clean for the New World.

~Wiggins: Do you think we'll meet some savages?

Wiggins: Ooh, gift baskets!

Also, I only had to go to history once this week thanks to the National Business Women's Week meeting on Thursday. I got to go with Elena and present the flags since we're Girl Scouts and got a nice free lunch out of it. Then Friday was just great. Statistics was boring as usual but I was able to study for my bio quiz, and then Hannah came to get me out of class early just to practice our duo piece for debate for no particular reason. English wasn't that much fun, but at least we got to work in small groups today so I actually could give my input in class, and we didn't have any homework due. Then in biology we had our quiz and then split up into groups to work on a presentation, but instead my group just talked about middle school and other fun topics ;) Luckily we had a shortened class due to the Frank Ponce BBQ and a longer lunch. Lunch was better than usual, and not just because it was longer :) Anyways, after lunch I had psychology in which we just copied notes in Mr. St. Clair's room since Mr. Flynn wasn't here, and spent the rest of the period just talking. So overall, it was just great day. I also got a debate sweatshirt and an interview for the Jefferson scholarship, which made the day even better. So tomorrow I head out for two soccer games this weekend, which will be tough, but fun, and luckily there are no projects due right after this weekend. 
On a side note, I'd just like to mention that I have the bestest friends in the world. Sometimes I forget to realize just how great some people are and how happy they make me, so I wanted to say thanks for being amazing people : D

Quotes are from Crash:
~Officer Hanson: Something else funny? 
Peter: [laughing] People, man... people. 

~Graham: It's the sense of touch. In any real city, you walk, you know? You brush past people, people bump into you. In L.A., nobody touches you. We're always behind this metal and glass. I think we miss that touch so much, that we crash into each other, just so we can feel something.

Officer Ryan: You have no idea."

"event","This always happens. As soon as school starts I never update my journal because I'm too busy or don't feel like writing down how much I hate school like everyone else. But it's time. This year has just been project after project, test after test, with no signs of slowing down, but knowing that I have less than a year of this is what is getting me through. My least favorite class has got to be biology like last year, with history behind it. It's not that I don't like history, it's just I'm sick of getting all this reading to do that I don't have time for and worrying all the time about his tests and projects. But like I said, less than a year to go now. On another topic, things really haven't gotten any better for me health wise. Since I last wrote, I've seen another specialist and have had the really painful test I didn't want to take done, as well as go to the hospital for another procedure, which luckily I got to be under anesthesia this time. Other than that, I've tried some more medicines that weren't really helpful, but now my doctors are pretty sure they have the right diagnosis. Now it's just a matter of trying to find the right therapy or medicine that will work for me. 
Sorry, I hate being such a downer but I just wanted to get it our. Now on to better things. My parents are out of town for over a week now, and while I really miss them (because I'm such a momma's girl), I sort of enjoy this new found freedom. But of course, no parties at my house, especially since I'm not staying there. Also, this weekend I'll be going to my first debate tournament in about 3 years. I'm really hoping that it will be fun, especially since Hannah and I are doing duo and doing a piece called Ditzies. We thought it was perfect for us. But we really have had only one week or so to work on it. Oh well. Challenges help make fun a little more interesting. Well, I better go and work on my homework now, and I will really try to update more in the future, or so I hope. My quotes this time are from While You Were Sleeping.

Lucy: Well, that's probably because we've never met. 
Jack: That could have something to do with it. 

~Lucy: Doesn't anybody use a phone anymore?

Lucy: I'm not talking about 900 numbers.

"event","Well I just got back from St. Louis today. It was so much fun because my mom and I did a road trip to St. Louis stopping at these awesome state resort parks in Kentucky. We also got to see Mammoth Cave, which is the longest cave in the world, which they tell you over and over. It was so cool down there, I mean literally and figuratively. We just went on a short tour because I wasn't sure if I could handle a longer tour, but the short tour was enough for me. Just walking through the cave and hearing the history behind it was so interesting. I know that sounds dorky, but I love history. The best part was when our guide was telling us about one time when someone got left behind on a tour and had to stay in the dark there for 24 hours, and then right after she told us that, the lights went out. Someone didn't know that we were down there so they turned off the light by accident, so here we were in complete darkness, like nothing I've ever experienced before, and our guide has to find the old grease light that they used in the 1800s to find our way back to the switch. It really gave us a feel for how it was to explore the cave years ago. Anyways, in St. Louis we were staying with family friends who were having the baptism of their daughter. They chose my mom to be the godmother which was really special, and the baptism, which was during the mass, was the most beautiful one I had ever seen. It was perfect in every way. I really enjoyed staying at our friend's house because they had all their family from out of town staying as well, and they were a great group of people, all Catholic mind you, and it was just an awesome experience to be part of such a close-knit huge Catholic family. The only thing that made the trip bad was that I started getting an allergic reaction to the latest medicine my doctor gave me. I started getting a rash on my face on Saturday and it just got worse, and spread all over my torso, so that now it is really uncomfortable, but I've been to the doctor and now have more medicine to help with the allergic reaction. But other than that, the trip was so much fun!
Today I had the pleasure of going to the open house and meeting a lot of my new teachers and saying hi to my old ones. I saw Berini, Abbott, Anliker, Cartiff, Shuping, Layton, Simmons (pe teacher), Demera, LaJoie, and Davidson. Although this year might not be as easy as I would like it to be, I'm trying my hardest not to stress out, and even if I get a few B's and slip in my class rank, I won't care, because I'm proud of the work I did the last three years and it's good enough to get me into Chapel Hill, I hope, so I'm not going to let the expectations of everyone else stress me out because I don't need that right now. I'm not looking to become valedictorian or even salutatorian, I just want to enjoy my last year of high school and get my health problem fixed. If I happen to receive such an honor, it's just a lucky bonus. I have enough honors and awards to be proud of that I don't want to become obsessed with another. Well, here is my schedule, please let me know if we have any classes together if you haven't already told me.
1 - PE 9 - Simmons
2 - AP Statistics - Davidson
3 - IB Spanish VI - Demera
4 - IB English IV - Shuping
5 - IB International History - Layton
6 - IB Biology - Franklin

"event","I'll try to make this brief as I do not like to complain much to others about my life, except when it's about school. If only my frustration was caused by school, I would be so happy, but unfortunately my frustration stems from my health problem. Now, after I visited a specialist in the area of my problem, he could not say what exactly was my problem, but just gave me more medicine and in bigger doses, hoping it will work. So far, it hasn't really, which may mean that I will have to go through more advanced tests which are even more uncomfortable and painful than what I have already experienced, if that's possible. And while I won't mind the pain much because I just want to find out what is wrong with me, it's still very frustrating, and even if he does find the problem, I then might have to have surgery. And while I won't mind that either because I just want this fixed, I know it's going to take it's toll on me, and I wish I hadn't waited all this time till senior year to tell my mom about my problem. So I'm hoping that the medicine will work, but  it's just very frustrating in the mean time. And I would like to thank all those who gave me words of encouragement after I came back from the doctor, it was more helpful than words can say.
Well, I hate being so down, so I'll try to write about some good stuff to end on a good note. Well I delivered my gold award to the hospital!! And it was great!! Some kids from my youth group at church came with me to the hospital, and we read to some of the patients in the play room, which was awesome. They are so inspiring, to see these kids suffering from illnesses who still have the vivacity of any other child. One parent told me that his child never liked to read, and here she was picking out book after book for us to read to her. I was so happy, because just knowing that one person benefited from my project makes all the work worth it, even if no one else does. So now, all I have to do is present it to the board sometime, and I'm officially done! I also worked as the camp director's assistance last week since I knew them, which wasn't bad at all since they like to spoil me. This week I found out that my parents are going on a cruise in October and I'll have to stay with these people, which will be great since they're always so nice to me, plus I get to experience a little bit of freedom, which may not seem like much to others, but it's a big deal for me. Well that's pretty much it for now, I just have to read like crazy these next two weeks for my summer reading, in between going to a soccer tournament in Wilmington and going to St. Louis.  Well, that's it for now. I hope everyone has a great rest of the summer!"

"event","Wow, I've definitely let this slip. There have been so many times that I wanted to update but I just felt too lazy or tired to do so. So since I last wrote, I saw Batman Begins, Bewitched, Kicking and Screaming, and a ton of movies from the library. I also went to Miami, or rather Hialeah, to see family and get a taste of the Cuban culture. I always love going there because I get to eat all this great Cuban food that you can't get here and see my wonderful extended family. Although there was a downside to the trip because my paternal grandmother has Alzheimer's and it was really sad to see her in the state that she was in. It really made me thought of how important it is to live a good, fun life so you can have friends and family that will always be willing to look at for you and have good memories of you, even when you don't of yourself. Plus, I got to see a lot of old pictures on this trip of just all my family from when they lived in Cuba to until my parents got married, and it was really interesting to see my elders at my same age and hear their stories. At the same time though, it made me rather nostalgic and somewhat depressed at times. Well, since we came back, I've been working on my Gold Award a lot, so that by August 1, I will have delivered the books to the hospital, and be done with it, other than the final report and meeting with the council. I've also just been hanging out with friends, like Sangeeta, Jonathan, and Hannah, and dealing with a current health problem, that not most know about, but it's just been very frustrating because it has been cutting into the quality of my life at the moment. But it's ok, because I'm dealing with it and hopefully it won't so much of a problem anymore. Other, than that, there hasn't been much else except visiting Wake Forest, which seems ok, but I still like Chapel Hill better. Anyways, that's all I can think of to say now, but I definitely will try to update more often. My quotes will be from the 3 movies I mentioned in this entry.
Kicking and Screaming
~Phil Weston: You're my assistant. You're supposed to back me up and go get me juiceboxes whenever I want. Now go get me a juicebox! 
Mike Ditka: DO YOU KNOW WHO YOU'RE TALKING TO? 
Phil Weston: I'm talkin' to the juicebox guy! 
Mike Ditka: You're crazy! 
Phil Weston: I'm not crazy, I'm just thirsty! 
Mike Ditka: OH, YOU GO TO HELL! 
Phil Weston: No, you go to hell, and while you're there, why don't you grab me a juicebox! 

Batman Begins
~Ra's al Ghul: If someone stands in the way of true justice, you simply walk up behind them and stab them in the heart. 

Bewitched
~Uncle Arthur: Do you want the long version or the short version? And I have to warn you, the long version is in Aramaic."

"event","Well, since Tuesday, a bunch of stuff has happened, well at least for me. On Thursday was the actual graduation, and although taking half of the seniors to the stage was kinda boring, it was really cool leading them in with Claire. And luckily, my feet didn't hurt too much afterwards although Claire was smart, of course, and had gone to practice with the shoes she would be wearing on Thursday, so she knew where to put the band-aids to prevent blisters. After graduation was even more fun because while I was going in search of my mother I saw Jonathan and his family, since his brother was graduating, and they invited me to go with them to lunch. So even though I had planned on going to lunch with my mom and shopping with her, she allowed me to go, much to the amusement of everyone I told. Well, I had a really good time at lunch, talking mostly to Jonathan's little sister who made fun of me for belonging to SCSA soccer club and always referred to me as Jonathan's girlfriend, as did practically the rest of the family. Another amusing feature to the lunch was how everyone in Jonathan's family was saying something to me about Jonathan to try and embarrass him. Well I can't really remember anything else that happened that week, except for going to the gym with my mom and finally starting to get back in shape for soccer. This week I was more productive, working as a camp counselor at Queen's University for a gifted and talented kids camp. I helped in the Crash and Burn Chemistry course, which was fun because we did cool demos, some of which I did in Mrs. Heath's clas, but this time I didn't have to do a stupid lab write-up. Luckily, I only had to work from 9 to 12 so I had the rest of the afternoon off. On Monday, after camp I went to piano lessons after hanging out at Hannah's for like 30 minutes while I scarfed down lunch, and then later that day Sangeeta and Hannah came over. We mostly just played DDR and ate and then called Arun and Jonathan to see how they were doing at their nationals debate tournament. Afterwards, Sangeeta had to leave and Hannah stayed for the night and we watched Phantom of the Opera because she hadn't seen it. The rest of the afternoons this week I mostly just slept and went to the gym. Today I finally got to sleep in and then recorded some more children's stories for my Gold Award. Later on I had to go to my piano recital which always makes me a nervous wreck, because no matter how confident I feel about the piece I'm playing beforehand, when I actually get to the place where I'm playing, I feel like I forget everything. Luckily, I was able to play my piece without any noticeable slip-ups and got a nice sense of satisfaction. When I got home I ate dinner with my family then went to go babysitting for only 3 hours, but i still got payed $12 an hour, which is a lot for not doing much. Well now I'm going to go watch the Wedding Planner and hope to have a nice Father's Day tomorrow. 
My quotes today will be from Twister which I saw sometime, but I can't really remember when.

~Melissa: When you used to tell me that you chase tornadoes, deep down I thought it was just a metaphor. 

~Dusty: ""The Suck Zone"". It's the point basically when the twister... sucks you up. That's not the technical term for it, obviously. 

~[about Bill's new fiancee] 
Bill: She's a... she's a therapist. 
Jo: Oh... Yours? 
Bill: Christ, you couldn't resist, could you? 
Jo: What? I'm not saying you NEED therapy. 
Bill: What? Wait, wait, wait, I need therapy? 
Jo: I didn't say that. 
Bill: What could I possibly need a therapist for? Huh? You're the doctor, tell me! 
Jo: I don't know... inability to finish things? 
Bill: ""Inability to finish things""? 
Jo: Maybe rushing into things you can't quite commit to. 
Bill: Commitment? 
Jo: You asked!"

"event","I didn't mean to let almost a month pass by before writing again, I've just been either too busy or apathetic. Well this school year is finally over! During exams, it felt like it was only the end of 1st semester, but I'm really glad that's not true. I don't know how much longer I could last. So far grades have been good, I'm just not certain about a couple yet, but I appreciate everyone wanting me to do well for certain reasons. ;) I can only hope my work meets your expectations. Graduation rehearsals were today, which were extremely boring. I almost wish I could be #61 at this point so I didn't have to be a marshal, but I guess class rank is a curse and a blessing. Well, since the last time I wrote, I've watched many movies, such as About a Boy, Kingdom of Heaven, Phonebooth, and the Mummy, and I can't really remember the others, but I know I watched more. I went to go see Kingdom of Heaven with Jonathan which was a lot of fun, although I think a light-hearted movie would have been better because the seige on Jerusalem for an hour gets kinda old and tedious. I've also gone to two birthday parties which were fun. At one of them I got to make a stuffed animal from Build-A-Bear-Workshop, and I made a cute bunny that wears graduation robes and scholarly glasses to give me motiviation throughtout the year and so I could take it to college without looking like a dork. The other birthday party was fun since it was yesterday and after our last day of school.
So, basically, I don't have too many plans this summer, so if you want to hang out or do something please call or IM me. Also if you need some service hours, I could use some help on my Gold Award for Girl Scouts which is just recording children's stories for the children's hospital. For more details, again just contact me somehow. Well I can't think of too much else to say, so I'll end with movie quotes from all 4 movies that I listed.

The Mummy
[Upon opening the tomb] 
Evelyn: I've dreamt about this since I was a little girl. 
Rick: You dream about dead guys? 

About a Boy
[singing ""Killing me Softly""] 
Will: And there I was killing them softly with my song. Or rather being killed. And not so softly either. 

Kingdom of Heaven
Balian of Ibelin: What could a king ask of a man like me? 
Godfrey of Ibelin: A better world than has ever been seen. A kingdom of conscious. A kingdom of heaven. 

Phonebooth
[Stu is not answering The Caller] 
The Caller: Stu, don't do this. Please, come on. My sainted mother used to do this. She used to dish this out... Stu, please don't this. Stu, you're bringing back my unhappy childhood. Stu, talk to me, please! Talk to me! I can't take it Stu... Ahh! 
[the Caller laughs] 
The Caller: I'm kidding. I had a very happy childhood."

"event","Well, my last entry was that of a stressed out IB kid who can't believe she went to school on a teacher workday, but this entry is that of an IB kid who is completely finished with all her papers, exams, and the tests during exam time. This makes me very happy. The rest of the year should be pretty nice because I'm doing nothing in like all of my classes except for history and biology, although Mrs. Demera claims we will still have tests and work to do and that the year doesn't end till June, and blah blah blah. Seriously, does she not understand that the seniors don't care and we've already had our exam, so lay off. Oh well, what can one do? Absolutely nothing. So, I'll look on the bright side of things. Well prom was awesome, and I've been in a good mood ever since. Every time I think about it, I get a smile on my face and anything that was bothering me goes away for a moment. I must compliment Jonathan on being a true gentleman and a great date. Although, the only thing he needs to work on is dancing, because the sprinkler move can only work for so many dances. Everyone looked great and thanks to everyone who complimented me! I would definitely recommend going next year if you didn't go this year because it was so much fun. Well, I also took the SAT's that Saturday morning, which kinda sucked, but it wasn't too bad, just really long. So when I came home, I was intending on cleaning up the house because my parents weren't supposed to get back from Minnesota till like 3, but they were already back home before I got back from the SAT's. So much for cleaning the house. The good thing about them getting back early was that my mom had more time to help me get ready. It probably took 3 hours doing everything, which included curling the hair, makeup, nails, and finally doing the hair once it was curled. The make up bit took the longest because I could not keep my eye still while doing the eyeliner. But in the end, I think my mom did a pretty good job, and it was nice to be the center of attention in the house. 
Other than prom, I got Phantom of the Opera on DVD, the special collector's edition, which made me really happy. If you haven't noticed yet, I'm obsessed with Phantom of the Opera. Also, my brother came home between exams and then back again after all of the exams were over. It's nice to have him here because we can go out to lunch and have our parents pay for it, plus just talk about everything. Let's see, what else? Um...Oh, right, we got our yearbooks which is always fun, but I need to get more people to sign it. If you want some space reserved, just tell me or just sign it when you see me next time.
Well I haven't gotten to see any movies really except for Phantom of the Opera again, and Robots and the Secret Garden when I was babysitting. So I'm afraid the quotes this time will be coming from Robots. (Please excuse me if they are corny)
~Fender: [while running down a conveyor belt after putting on a new pair of legs, which reveal they have a skirt on them] This is so wrong... this is *so wrong*! 

~Rodney Copperbottom: There should be an angry mob out there.
[angry mob runs past the window]
Fender: [Fender, Rodney and the others go out to investigate the mob] Wow! That was great, psychic friend! Now say, ?Money should be falling from the sky? 

~Mrs. Copperbottom: I told you I'd find him! It's a mother's instinct.
Herb Copperbottom: What instinct? He left us a note, ?I'm leaving, I'll be at the train station.?"

~Jack Burton: Hey, I'm a reasonable guy. But I've just experienced some very unreasonable things. 

~Jack Burton: You know what Jack Burton always says... what the hell? 

~Jack Burton: I don't get this at all. I thought Lo Pan. 
Lo Pan: Shut up Mr Burton! You were not brought upon this world to get it!

~Jack Burton: Okay, I get the picture White Tigers, Lords of Death, guys in funny suits throwing plastic explosives while poison arrows fall from the sky and the pillars of heaven shake, huh? Sure, okay, I see Charlie Chan, Fu Manchu and a hundred howlin' monkey temples, and that's just for starters, right? Fine! I'm back! I'm ready, goddammit let me at 'em!"

"event","Well, finally we have a break from school, but I'll be going tomorrow for tutoring on the AP US history exam. Oh well, at least I can sleep in somewhat later than usual. This past week went by somewhat fast, with world lit 1 almost done and world lit 2 beginning. I decided to do the diary entry, which isn't bad, but I'm just sick of papers now, especially with the TOK Paper at the same time. Plus IB and AP exams are coming up and some teachers have decided to give regular class tests during this time, as if we didn't have enough already. But at least two weeks from now, things will be considerably easier for the rest of the year. This weekend I'll be babysitting for most of Saturday and then I'll be working on papers the rest of the time, that way I won't have too much work the weekend after which is prom and SAT's and I have exams that Friday and Monday around the weekend. Oh well, what can I do but just push through it? There's a light at the end of every tunnel, except for last year in computer science in which case Priya's and my crickets were feeling quite ill and almost died. But that's just a special case. 
So today I had a lot of fun at school and afterwards. Well school wasn't that much fun but it was really easy since we did nothing in TOK or English. Well actually, in English I worked on the history packet and during TOK, Arun and I went over the multiple choice answers in the AP History book, and we did pretty well which made us think we should take partner tests. But alas, the college board doesn't allow it, so I figure I'll see what Abbott has to say about the test. After school, I stayed to make up a quiz and then helped Mrs. Franklin grade papers to kill time until I had to leave. Once I got home, I had to clean the upstairs so that it would be presentable when Matt came over. So once I finished cleaning for like 2 hours, I picked Matt up and we went to Avanti's in the Arboretum. It was good, but we didn't even eat half of a calzone when we just ordered one to share. It was kinda sad, but at least I have lunch for the next couple of days. Then we went over to my house and I showed him my prom dresses, but he wasn't really useful in helping me decide, but I don't blame him. Then I showed him my pictures from Italy because he hadn't seen them, and it was fun reliving those memories again and finidng we had the same interests when it came to traveling. After looking at pictures, we decided, or rather I decided, to watch Big Trouble in Little China, a very confusing but interesting film from the 80's. Then he played the guitar, which sounded really cool, and I played some piano until he left. I had forgotten how much fun it was to hang out with him. We should definitely do it again soon. So I think I've finally caught up on going out with all my friends that I wanted to, and if I haven't hung out with you yet, let me know and we'll plan something. Well time to go to bed so I can actually stay awake tomorrow."

"event","Well, it's been a little while again since I wrote. This month has sure been full of emotion for Catholics worldwide. First mourning, then suspense and waiting, and then the joyous occasion of electing a new pope. I am very pleased with the choice of Pope Benedict XVI because I know he will stick to church doctrine and keep the Church on the right track. Well since I last wrote, I've pretty much just been busy with school. Nothing much is going on except Jonathan asked me to prom, which I'm happy about. I'm really looking forward to prom, but not to all the exams I have before that weekend and afterward and the SAT's on the day of prom. Oh, well at least I won't have much to do in the classes I have exams for, which is a plus. 
Well I guess I'll try to think of other stuff that has happened since I last wrote (me thinking right now)... oh right. Hannah finally could sleep over and we watched the old SNL show where Ashlee Simpson messed up and we also watched Adventures in Babysitting, which was a great movie, no joke. They don't make movies like that anymore. Some other movies I can actually remember watching are The Phantom of the Opera and Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. I think Willy Wonka has become my new favorite movie. For some reason when I watched it this time, I noticed a lot of funny stuff I never noticed before or didn't get. Gene Wilder did an awesome job and despite liking Johnny Depp, I don't think I'll like the remake as much as the original. And my new favorite song is Pure Imagination from that movie. It is so pretty. Well this weekend I will be working on my TOK Oral because I go on Tuesday and perfecting my World Lit Paper 1 because I haven't made any big changes since I wrote the first draft. Right now I'm at 1647 words, which is good. While we had that working day in English today, I spent a good 30 minutes just counting how many words I had and the rest of the time was spent looking busy. Oh, and for history, Mr. Abbott can't just put a map on a test when he never went over it. And also, he shouldn't give another test until he has graded and returned any previous test. I mean we turned in our papers and took the last test over a month ago. I know teachers can be very busy, but this is a bit too long for grading. Ok, well I'll stop bashing him now and go on to find some movie quotes from Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, although most of Wonka's lines in the movie are quotes from other works. (I know there's a lot today, but I assure they're all good and hopefully you'll enjoy reading them)

~Mr. Turkentine: I've just decided to switch our Friday schedule to Monday, which means that the test we take each Friday on what we learned during the week will now take place on Monday before we've learned it. But since today is Tuesday, it doesn't matter in the slightest. 

~Willy Wonka: Oh, you should never, never doubt what nobody is sure about. 

~Willy Wonka: [singing] There is no life I know to compare with pure imagination. Living there, you'll be free if you truly wish to be. 

~Veruca Salt: Snozzberry? Who ever heard of a snozzberry? 
Willy Wonka: [grabs Veruca's chin] We are the music makers, and we are the dreamers of the dreams. 

~Willy Wonka: So much time and so little to do. Wait a minute. Strike that. Reverse it. 

~Willy Wonka: Wrong, sir. Wrong. Under section 37B of the contract signed by him, it states quite clearly that all offers shall become null and void if - and you can read it for yourself in this photostatic copy - ""I, the undersigned, shall forfeit all rights, privileges, and licenses herein and herein contained,"" et cetera, et cetera...""Fax mentis incendium gloria cultum,"" et cetera, et cetera...""Memo bis punitor delicatum"". It's all there, black and white, clear as crystal. You stole fizzy lifting drinks. You bumped into the ceiling which now has to be washed and sterilized, so you get nothing. You lose. Good day sir. 

~Willy Wonka: But Charlie, don't forget what happened to the man who suddenly got everything he he always wanted. 
Charlie Bucket: What happened? 
Willy Wonka: He lived happily ever after. 

~Reporter: Four down, one to go and somewhere out there a lucky person is moving closer and closer to the most sought after prize in history. Though we cannot help but envy whoever he is, and we may feel bitter but we must remember there are more important things, many more important things. Though offhand I cannot think of what they are but I'm sure there must be something. 

~Willy Wonka: The snozzberries taste like snozzberries"

"event","I finally get to update my journal now after a week of my computer's internet not working, but I'm in such a good mood now I don't care about that. These last three days have been amazing for me as they have not only signaled the end of 3rd quarter and the beginning of Spring Break, but it is also the Easter Tridium in the Catholic Church. I have been very fortunate to be an altar server at every mass of the Tridium and as well as tomorrow for Easter. I know other Catholics will agree with me when I say this it the best time of the year in our faith because of what happened and the traditions we celebrate in the mass. After coming home from Holy Thursday mass, I felt like I was on a Catholic high and I hope that feeling doesn't go away. I know most won't care about Catholic tradition or the Easter Tridium, but I guess this is just a time for me to reiterate how important my religion is to me in case you didn't already know. Well I have great stories to tell of my altar serving experiences but I'm afraid most won't have a clue what I'm talking about (and I don't mean that in a bad way) so if you want to know ask me, or I've probably already told you if you go to my church. 
This week at school wasn't too bad, but Monday and Tuesday seemed to last forever, but Wednesday and Thursday were much better. On Monday I got to school around 5:30 to sign up for my World Literature thesis, and although I probably could have gotten any of my theses that I wanted if I came later, I still enjoyed coming early because it was fun to hang out outside of the LA building and in the hallways. After I signed up for my thesis and most everyone else left to get coffee or food, I just stayed in Mrs. Berini's room doing biology homework. I know that's the ultimate IB thing to do, but I stayed up late Sunday night coming up with obscure theses. Thursday wasn't bad since I had two subs, and we watched a movie for most of Spanish, something we never do, and then I had PHI. In Music Theory after finishing our worksheet we watched part of The Incredibles and then in Spanish we finished watching The Motorcycle Diaries, which is a good movie. In math, we had Mr. Ward as our sub, and I swear if I have to listen to anymore of his jokes or him arguing with all the liberal kids about the new social security plan, I will scream. Oh and I forgot about how great Wednesday was because I finally got to go to bible study at my church without any homework preventing me from doing so and Jonathan actually came, which made me really happy. While we were there we made this ""Resurrection Rolls"" which were really cool because you take biscuit dough from the can to represent Jesus' tomb, and a marshmallow to represent Jesus wrapped inside the dough, and when you bake it the right way with butter as the oil and cinnamon as the spices for Jesus' body on top of the roll, the marshmallow will disappear from the inside. It was pretty awesome. Well since my last entry I've watched The Incredibles, Little Women, Pride and Prejudice (again) and part of Laws of Attraction. But I've decided to go with quotes from Little Women.

~Amy: I don't wanna die. I've never even been kissed. I've waited my whole to be kissed, and what if I miss it? 
Laurie: I tell you what. I promise to kiss you before you die. 

~Laurie: Someday you'll find a man, a good man, and you'll love him, and marry him, and live and die for him. And I'll be hanged if I stand by and watch. 

~Beth: I know I shall be homesick for you even in Heaven. 

~Friedrich: Your heart understood mine. In the depth of the fragrant night, I listened with ravished soul to your beloved voice. Your heart understood mine. 

I also forgot to mention that from Monday to Friday I will be in Raleigh as a governor's page, so I shall hope to update when I get back home, on either Friday or Saturday. Well I better go to bed as I have to serve at 7:00 am mass on Easter and I feel a sore throat coming (probably from all the incense at church). Happy Easter everyone and have a great Spring Break!"

"event","Well the history Internal Assessment is over which means only the World Lit Papers left. At least we have a substantial amount of time to write them. Today also marks the end of third quarter, which is probably the hardest quarter of our high school career. Only 5 more to go. Yes! I also turned in my registration card today, so my prospective classes next year are: IB English, IB History, IB Biology 3, IB Spanish 6, IB Psychology, AP Statistics, AP Government and Politics, and PE/Health. Although it was hard for me to choose between statistics and calculus and government and politics and human geography I think I will be happy with my choices. Well, since the last time I wrote I've been working hard on the History IA and finishing and annotating The Pickup. I've also watched a couple of movies over the weekends, such as One Fine Day, The Bachelor, The Incredibles, and a mini series of Pride and Prejudice, which was really good. I've also finished my piano competitions, finally getting superior at the last one. Third time's a charm. I also got a new cell phone, although its the same number as before. Things are pretty good for me now, which makes me really happy, obviously. Although I'm sorry for my friends who are going through rough times now, and I hope everything gets better. Just remember I'm always here if you need me. ;) 
I just remembered something about school this week which I thought was worth mentioning. In biology, we were learning about photosynthesis, but whenever Mrs. Franklin is lecturing I usually space out because I stayed up late doing either history or English homework, so to keep myself awake I was playing MASH. MASH used to get me through biology in 9th grade with Caroline, and throughout middle school. If you ever feel like you're going to fall asleep, you should definitely do it because it provides entertainment for at least 10 to 15 minutes. Also in history, we better move on to something other than the Mexican Revolution because we spent 3 days working on the Mexican Revolution chart, and that just got annoying. As for English, I definitely think we could have spent more time on The Pickup, but I'm just glad we're done with our last book that we have to annotate or read beforehand. And TOK sucks now that we're actually learning stuff. Cartiff is alright but it gets boring, especially at the end of the day when he is just lecturing or reading something aloud. As for my A days classes, they're alright. I had my Spanish Oral last Friday, and it really wasn't that bad. Mrs. Demera was actually nice and I was able to talk with her for 12 minutes on tape. Yay! Plus I got a smoothie and a nice salad after the oral and missed most of English and part of history. Well, I'm hoping 4th quarter will be a bit easier, especially since I'll be missing a couple days of school for exams, and my classes with seniors will hopefully get easier as the end of the school year approaches. Also, prom is 4th quarter, which is something to look forward to. I hope I can get a date, but if not, I wouldn't mind going in a group with my friends. Well, I think I'm going to go watch another movie now, but of course I will end with my quotes. These will be from Pride and Prejudice because it was just that awesome.

~Mr. Darcy: In vain have I struggled, it will not do. You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love you. 

~Mrs. Bennet: Oh, Mr. Bennet, nothing you say shall ever vex me again. 
Mr. Bennet: I'm sorry to hear it. 

~Mr. Collins: Lady Catherine de Bourgh herself was kind enough to suggest that these shelves be fitted exactly as you see them there. 
Elizabeth Bennet: Shelves in the closet. Happy thought indeed. 

~Mr. Darcy: Yes, but that was only when I first knew her, for it is many months since I have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance."

"event","Today is a very happy day (well actually yesterday) because the extended essay is finally done and over with and I am pretty happy with how mine ended up. I should be sleeping right now, but I'm in too good of a mood, despite sleeping about 7 to 10 hours this whole week. The worst night was Thursday morning with only one hour of sleep. Every other night I went to bed after 12, usually around 1 or 2. Despite this fact, I was in relatively good spirits this week. I never broke down and cried like I thought I would and if I had a laughing fit, it didn't last too long. Well the next thing to worry about is the History Internal Assessment, but that seems like a piece of cake now compared to the extended essay. The theme I chose to write about, oddly enough, was Castro's Cuba. I will be looking at immigration from Castro's Cuba, which I'm sure is another big surprise since many of you know my parents are Cuban immigrants. Oh well, enough talk about papers. It's Friday! And my senior exit/extended essay is done! And I'm in a super good mood! Well this weekend, I plan to sleep, sleep a little more, then get some more sleep, and end up sleeping again. In between all that sleeping I have a piano competition which should be interesting since I can't play my songs that well since I haven't gotten to practice much. Also, I plan to hang out with my brother and family since I've been stuck in my room working all week long. Today I watched Titanic which brought back all kinds of memories back from 4th grade. I forgot how sad it was and now I wished I hadn't wathced it because I feel depressed whenever I think about it. Don't worry, I will not quote anything from that movie. That movie is more like eye candy instead of being a good story that you will cherish. Anyhow, I'm really happy! Sorry, I know I keep mentioning it, but I really am happy. So...wow, my brain is starting to turn off. Anyways, for all those who think I gave Mr. Cartiff a back rub out of my own choice are seriously mistaken. I will tell my tale so there is no more confusion. Well, in TOK one day I was working on my extended essay like everyone else (yeah right) and I actually had a question about citing something, so I went up to Cartiff, who had been moaning all class about his neck and back, and asked him my question. But before I said anything, he said he would only answer my question if I rubbed his back because he was in a lot of pain. Like seriously, he was hunched over the desk and could not move. But I still didn't think he was serious, so I asked my question anyways. Well once I did and he answered it he said I had to keep my end of the bargain, so I very tentatively attempted to massage with like one fingertip where he said it hurt, but then he told me I could stop since I wasn't doing it hard enough, and finally getting the message that this was a tad awkward. And that was it. If you had been there, maybe you would understand the situation better, but I'll repeat again that I did not do it out of free choice. Anywho, I should probably go to bed. But now for my quotes. Today's choice will be from Dave, a great movie that I watched a while back, but I was reminded about it today so here are some of my favorite quotes.
~[singing in the shower] 
Dave: Hail to the chief / He's the one we all say ""Hail"" to. / We all say ""Hail"" / 'Cause he keeps himself so clean! / He's got the power, / That's why he's in the shower... 

~Ellen Mitchell: Why couldn't you die from a stroke like everyone else? 

~Dave Kovic: She's great. She's really exotic! She's a princess! She's Polynesian - well, half Polynesian, and half American. She's... Amnesian. 

I hope these put a smile on your face. :)"

"event","Well today I finally started on my extended essay. I got to 730 words, but the introduction is always the hardest thing for me, so I hope the word count will rise very quickly in the next few days as I continue to write the body of my paper. I still can't believe I'm interested in my topic after this much time! I actually made a good choice for once. Yay. Well this week was not bad, considering it was a 4 day week. On Tuesday, nothing of significance must have happened because I can't remember anything. On Wednesday, nothing much happened, but I left school early to go to the doctor to see what was wrong with the part of my skin that is turning white. I forgot the name of what I have, but apparently my immune system works too hard and causes my skin to be harder to replace there or something so it doesn't have the time to turn the same color as the rest of my skin. If I could choose an auto-immune disease to have, this would be it because it's pretty much harmless. On Thursday, bio was boring as usual with some lab that didn't turn out right for my group because we had some bad iodine. In English we got our transcripts and class rank. I know I swore I wouldn't say what my class rank is but I was so happy that I couldn't keep a straight face when Arun was asking me and everyone already had somewhat of an idea. And all this time I had been worrying that I would get something past 5 and that my life would be over, but I didn't and I got 2 instead which really made my day. And of course I'd like to thank all of my friends who have supported me thus far and have given me more support in the hopes that I become 1. Then when I went to history after English we got our tests back and I got a 97, which I definitely wasn't expecting, making the day even better. After school I had to go make up watching a video for Mrs. Franklin which was so boring, then I copied Priyanka's notes from Franklin's tutoring (thanks Priyanka!). After bio, I still had like an hour before Mr. Fisher would be done at the track and be able to give me a ride home so I went to Mr. Abbott's class and looked at my mistakes on the test then ended up filling the whole hour there talking to him about colleges and he was trying to tell me how useful a history major was and how I shouldn't go into business or else I would be stuck at some desk job (but in a nice way). While I was there, I found another freaky coincidence between us, but I won't say it because it's really dorky. I mean, I don't think it's dorky but considering some of the looks I've gotten when I've told others, I decided it better not to say anything. When I got home I ate, did some homework and cleaned my room because company was coming over for the weekend and then I left for the talent show. It was ok, but I didn't like the acts that won, just like last year. Oh well, that's life. Then I had my last basketball practice of the season which was pretty uneventful. On Friday, nothing much happened at school, except Mrs. Demera chose me to tutor this kid from El Salvador during Spanish class and she gave me a 100 on a test grade for doing it and I missed class so I was happy. I helped tutor the guy in English and math, but it was hard because he barely knew any English, and I was never a great tutor, even in English, let alone trying some fragmented Spanish. After school my family and I went to Mr. Fisher's 50th birthday party where I mingled with all the adults, then I played a game I usually play while I'm there then Mrs. Fisher let me sleep on their bed since she noticed me trying to sleep on the floor. Then came today and I just worked on my extended essay then went to a family friend's house where I had pizza for like the 3rd time this week (not counting school) and we watched Elf. That movie can always put me in a good mood. Well I'm going to try and go to bed somewhat early tonight because I'm going to Mass in the morning, which we haven't done in a while because we go Saturday night, and so I can finish all my work tomorrow. Well now for my quotes. Today's selection will be from Elf.
~Gimbel's Manager: Why are you smiling like that? 
Buddy: I just like to smile, smiling's my favorite 

~Santa: I've been to New York thousands of times. 
Buddy: Really? 
Santa: Mm-hmm. 
Buddy: What's it like? 
Santa: Well, there are some things you should know. First off, you see gum on the street, leave it there. It's not candy. 
Buddy: Oh. 
Santa: Second, there are, like, thirty Ray's Pizzas. They all claim to be the original. But the real one's on 11th. And if you see a sign that says ""Peep Show"", that doesn't mean that they're letting you look at presents before Christmas. 

~Buddy: Actually, I'm a human, but I was raised by elves. 
Carolyn: I'm a human... raised by humans. 
Buddy: Cool. 

~Buddy: It's just nice to meet another human that shares my affinity for elf culture."

"event","Well, I just came home from Sangeeta's birthday party which was a lot of fun. I just hope I didn't get anyone sick. One really cool thing about the party was watching an Indian movie, and it was interesting but Caroline and I still couldn't figure out what was happening even though Priya and Neeli told us quite a few times. The first half of this weekend I was in Raleigh and Chapel Hill, which was also fun. I took a tour of UNC-Chapel Hill and I really liked what I saw and I even went to the dining hall like Mrs. Berini said we should and I liked the atmosphere there and around the whole campus in general. Later that day my brother, mother, and I went to go see Million Dollar Baby. None of us liked it because of the way it portrayed the Catholic Church and how it dealt with the issues in the movie. So I would not recommend it but then again I come from a conservative family. Just know that the Catholic Church is not how it seems in the movie. On Saturday I went to the NC State Library and a sniffle that I had the night before turned into a cold. I couldn't focus too much while I was at the library but I did get some work and research done. I also slept because they had desks against the wall with little walls around the desk so people can ""concentrate"", but I just slept after a while because I wasn't feeling well. The only other thing we did was go to mass at the church my brother goes to while he is at State. Then we bought some snacks, went back to the hotel, ate and talked, and then after my brother left, my mom and I watched Ever After. On Sunday, we went to the Olive Garden for breakfast/lunch, then I went to my brother's room to chill until we had to leave to pick my dad up from the airport. I just hope that I don't get a roommate like my brother's, who's side of the room was beyond messy and just eww. Then I came home and went to Sangeeta's party. Tomorrow, my mom is going to try and get an appointment for my arm because there is a patch of skin that is turning white, and although I've had it for at least a year she just now noticed it. I will also go to piano lessons and a dentist appointment. Somewhere in between all that I need to finish history and bio homework and try to do at least some work on my extended essay. Happy Valentine's Day to all. Mwah! And now for my quote. This selection will be from Ever After, a movie that Hannah and I can both recite from memory. 
~Prince Henry: You told me it was a matter of life or death. 
Leonardo da Vinci: A woman always is. 

~Danielle: It is not fair, sire. You have found my weakness, but i have yet to learn yours. 
Prince Henry: But I should think it was quite obvious. 

~Prince Henry: I kneel before you not as a prince, but as a man in love... I would feel like a king if you, Danielle De Barberac, would be my wife. 

~Danielle: [to Henry] Why did you have to be so wonderful?"

"event","I completely forgot about my quote for the end of each entry, so just pretend this is at the end of my last entry. This entry's quote will be from the wondeful musical Phantom of the Opera, which I have had the pleasure to see both on stage and in the movies. The quote comes from the All I Ask of You [reprise] which is so incredibly moving when Michael Crawford sings it. I can remember when I saw the musical here in Charlotte when I was in 7th grade and I fell in love with it. All I Ask of You is my favorite song, and Greg and I both agreed that we would have it played at our weddings (not to each other) because it is just so beautiful. Of course I think we would leave out the reprise at the weddings. So here it is, the much anticipated entry quote:
The Phantom: I gave you my music; made your song take wing. And now how you've repaid me - denied me and betrayed me. He was bound to love you when he heard you sing, Christine!"

"event","Yes, I am now 17. My last entry was that of a mere 16 year old, but now I write in this journal as a teenager who can now watch R rated movies legally, by herself. Well since the last time I wrote, i found out my grade in Spanish on the exam and for the semester and if you know me, you know I do not want to go into that anymore, I went to Charleston for a soccer tournament where we got second place, I turned 17 on January 15, I found out i have a month to write my extended essay (4,000 word paper) and I got my report card. What a fun time. And I've decided not to divulge my grade or GPA because I don't want others comparing themselves to me or myself to others. It's just not healthy. So... oh right! How could I neglect to mention that I finally saw Phantom of the Opera. It was pretty good. And although the actor playing phantom is in his 30's I can still say he looked pretty darn good, well at least the half not under the mask. And when you see the other half, you realized just how hot his good side is. Anywho, thank you to all who sent me a birthday wish or gift. I truly appreciated it. Well I just watched Camille, some black and white movie from 1936 which actually wasn't too bad. But it's way too complicated to explain. This weekend I shall do more research on my extended essay and read 100 Years of Solitude, and if there's no frozen precipitation, then I will be going to the opera on Sunday to see Samson and Delilah. Other than that, nothing else is going on. Life will just be hectic and I suppose a couple of nervous breakdowns or mental ones may be in order during the rest of the semester. I think people at my A day lunch have noticed my mental degeneration, but I'm really ok once I have some sugar. Well that's all I can think of to say now."

"event","Today was a pretty nice day, despite my current mood. Well I woke up at 11 then then went out to lunch with my brother which was nice since we hadn't had the chance since he came home from college. Then we went to go see Finding Neverland which was a great movie in my opinion. Johnny Depp was so cute in that movie and I would have cried had I been watching it in the privacy of my home, but I didn't want to leave the theater with red eyes. At the movie theater though, I saw Steve Udelson (if that's how you spell his name), the meteoroligist on ABC. That's as close as you're going to get to see a ""celebrity"" in Charlotte. Well then I went to my brother's girlfriend's house to stay until mass at St. Vincent's. While I was at her house I watched part of Napoleon Dynamite. It definitely wasn't your typical movie. Then we went to mass at St. Vincent's, which was nice to go to a different church (still Catholic though, of course). Then we went to our good family friend's house to have pizza and watch I, Robot. I had already seen it, but it wasn't bad watching it again with the family. Tomorrow we're going out to dinner at Maggiano's to celebrate my birthday while my brother is still here, and then I have soccer practice. The rest of my free time tomorrow will be spent studying for biology and a litte for music theory. My current mood is only becuase I've been thinking of stuff that I'd rather not think about or didn't have to think about but I still did. I don't want to say what though, because I've done that before and it only created worse problems. But I'll be in a good mood in no time. Actually, I'm already feeling better. Well, that's all for now, except for my quotes. Both are from Finding Neverland.
~J.M. Barrie: [discussing Sylvia's reluctance to accept her illness] You can't go on just pretending. 
Sylvia Llewelyn Davies: Just pretending? You brought pretending into this family, James. You taught us that we can change things just by believing them to be different. 
J.M. Barrie: Some things, Sylvia. Not everything. 
Sylvia Llewelyn Davies: But the things that matter. We've pretended for some time now that you're a part of this family, haven't we? You've come to mean so much to us all that now, it doesn't matter if it's true. And even if it isn't true, even if that can never be... I need to go on pretending. Until the end.
~Sylvia Llewelyn Davies: What's it like, Neverland? 
J.M. Barrie: One day I'll take you there."

"event","Well, I'm halfway through my exams now. Too bad I had all my easy ones first. Next week is going to be tough since I need to get high A's in Spanish and Biology if I want an A for the semester, which is important because class rank will be coming out after this semester. Scary, but true. On my first day of exams I had Sports and Fitness, which was a 50 question test on different sports we had played. It was super easy and gave me 2 hours to be able to study for history which I had next. It definitely was not as bad as I thought it would be, but then again I had studied until midnight and had gone to tutoring until 4:40 the previous day. Today, I had math and TOK. Math wasn't that bad, it just took me the whole period because there was one problem that i realized on my checking through it that I had done wrong and it took me forever to figure it out. And then it was like one of those obvious things that makes you go like, ""why did I spend 30 minutes on that one problem?"" TOK was nice since we only had to bring in something beautiful and say why it is. I actually enjoyed seeing what everyone brought and it reminded me of so many other beautiful things I could have brought in. So this weekend I shall be concentrating mostly on Spanish and biology and perhaps English.
Other than school, tomorrow or actually today after I wake up my brother and I are going out to lunch and hopefully to watch Finding Neverland. Yay! Also my birthday is in a week and I'll be in Charleston for the James Island soccer tournament which is always so much fun.  I need to start working on my Gold Award project soon for girl scouts, plus bring in all this stuff I'm missing for Mu Alpha Theta, and also try to sell some girl scout cookies. Other than that, life is pretty good. Well I've decided after watching some movies that I shall end my entries with a quote I liked, not necessarily from a movie though. So here it is:  ""There are as many forms of love as there are moments in time."" ~ Edmund Bertram from Mansfield Park
I actually have one more because I just watched Mansfield Park and it's full of great quotes: 
Edmund Bertram: Fanny, I've loved you my whole life. 
Fanny Price: I know, Edmund. 
Edmund Bertram: No... I've loved you as a man loves a woman. As a hero loves a heroine. As I have never loved anyone. 
Well that's all for now. Oh I forgot I just wanted to say Sangeeta is the best! Thanks so much again for your help, I don't know what I would have done without you."

"event","Well I came home today from skiing at Snowshoe in West Virginia. Tomorrow, at like 4 or 5 in the morning, it's off to Florida we go for our annual trip to celebrate Christmas there with the family, Cuban style. Christmas in Hialeah, Florida (AKA Little Habana(the correct spelling))consists of roasting a pig for dinner on Christmas eve, dancing to music until dinner is ready, eating pig and rice and black beans, then opening gifts, and then going to midnight mass at a Spanish church. I'm looking forward to it all as it is my one chance a year to be injected with all that Cuban goodness and good Cuban food. Yummy! Well WV was fun. We had a mini Christmas party there. So far I have gotten:
~a purple scarf and picture frame from a gift exchange at Girl Scouts
~the Chicago soundtrack and $20 gift card to Walmart from a family friend
~soccer socks, gloves, hat, headband, an athletic top, and snow pants from my parents
~frosted flower lights from Rachel, my brother's girlfriend
The skiing was nice, except it was like -22 at the beginning of Monday. On Tuesday, I spent the day at our cabin with my mom just reading Ishmael and playing on the computer and bringing in wood for the fire. By the way, Ishmael sucks. Here is a brief synopsis: A gorilla, named Ishmael, tells this guy that civilized humans have screwed up the world and are continuing to do so and that we should become primitive people. That's all. Well on the trip down to Florida, I shall start 100 Years of Solitude and possibly Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, plus do history notes.
I don't know if I'll be able to write while I'm in Florida, but if I can't I hope everyone has a nice Christmas or just a nice break if you don't celebrate it. And by the way I have a new email address: amanda.tamayo@gmail.com 
God Bless everyone! Enjoy the break!"

At least tomorrow I will be getting up to pack for my ski trip to Snowshoe in West Virginia where I can see a lot of snow. It will be so pretty. Woohoo. I'll be taking Ishmael and 100 Years of Solitude with me though, which won't be so cool. Anywho, school is alright I suppose. I was happy to hear Mr. Fuller is going to have another child but, not so happy to hear that Mr. Abbott plans on getting a buzz cut. Oh my gosh, eww. It will be his fault if he looks like a fool though.
Luckily, I won't have to hear any more orals in English or TOK. No offense to anyone, but after a while, they do get old. Also I have two weeks to catch up my history reading, which is good I suppose. Today I had a Christmas party 3 other girls from my girl scout troop and we went to Kabuto's which was fun, and very filling, then we had a gift exchange and I got a new scarf (which is really pretty) and a pretty picture frame. Well I can't think of anything else to say. Well I'll be coming back the 22 for one day and then leaving the 23 for Hialeah, (Little Habana)Florida for Christmas. I expect to be back the 30th so I'll be here for New Years. Anyways, like I said, I'm tired and I want to go to bed. I hope everyone has a Happy Holiday and safe traveling! Mwah to everyone."

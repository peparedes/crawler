You and me for the rest of our lives. I can't wait. I hope you read this and i want you to know that no matter how many ""hott"" guys are in sun river, you don't have to worry, and i know you know that. You trust me and i'm so glad.

"event","Matt and I are back together. My life has a purpose again. I can't believe how happy I am. We both are so happy and i can't believe how long it's been since i've been to this site. anyway i love him.....so much. life is good, no great. and school starts in a few days and every thing is wonderful. Thank you God for bringing him back to me. 

a peaceful sorrow at home is the best i'll ever be able to offer the world, in the end and so i told my desolation angels goodbye, a new life for me.

"event","I thought that you cared about me
that you would never leave my side
i believed in my trust for you
as well as my strength and my pride

Yet for you it was so easy
to throw all of this away
When i leaned for you to comfort me
you had nothing left to say

So i lie here in my bed at night
all i can do is cry
I try so hard to forget you
but my heart, I can't deny

Becaues i will always love you
and wish that you were here
Since now i am without you
and that is my worst fear

I just wanted to let you know 
as i wipe the tears from my face
i miss the way you made me laugh
your smile and warm embrace

And to tell you that your happiness 
is all i want to see
Even if your happiness
means being without me.

So i'll end this poem now
as i try hard not to cry
and with these final words i'll say
I love you and goodbye.

"event","an empty promise
an empty threat
an empty word you couldn't forget
your heart constricting with so much pain
a world of losses 
a world of gains
the devil speaking to your soul
never, not once, ever feeling control
a thousand tears, a thousand lies
a thousand deaths, a million cries
spinning around just like a top
never catching your breath, never able to stop
put the key in the lock and turn it fast
engulfed in the future caught up in the past
you're blind for all you can see is black
spinning in the darkness feeling the attack
of anguish and hurt coursing through your veins
all cuts run deep and the pain will never change


found:
i bleed my own blood
after slitting my own wrist
lost without love, trapt, forever hopeless.


A shadow lies across a distant time
where there was love and understanding
two people were brought together
one weaker than the other
conformed to their ruling
while losing old images, and creating new ones
a new person was born
only a few could see....
what neither of the two did at the time
then voices on the wind spoke
and eyes were opened
and hearts were crushed
storms raged in two persons minds
'til one day when the minds came again into one
but something had changed
once weaker before
that person was guarded
by their own cautiousness
walls had been set and made with great care
the one of ruling before
now felt unwanted and unclean
oh how those walls created problems for us all
unknowing of how to fix things
both hold back
the truest things of their minds
where once before
both walked with ease and understanding
now walk blind and frightened
this storm has settled on these poor persons minds
has seemed to have settled in
for a long time yet to come
both of these persons are fighting 
each other 
for something
neither of them can have
tears shed from countless battles
could fill and ocean
tears shed for both
and themselves
tears of hopes and wished
for a day when things were like 
once before.

Broken Promise Ring 

I really wanna call you, but I know that it's not right.
I probably shouldn't tell you but I dreamed of you last night.
I guess I'm not prepared to say...
Goodbye, so long, farewell, I won't be seeing you again
Until next time that he goes away.

You told me that you loved me, I started tearing down those walls.
I really started to trust you but you set me up to take the fall.
I guess I'm not prepared to say...
Goodbye, so long, farewell, I won't be seeing you again
Until next time that he goes away.

I guess that I'm wrong for falling in love,
But you're still the one that I'm dreaming of.
I guess that it's you I want to hold onto,
But you're holding onto someone else. 

i don't know how you feel about me
i don't know where you seem to be
i don't know if you have a girlfriend back home
i don't know if right now you alone
i don't know why i think about you so much
i don't know why its you i want to touch
i don't know if you forgot all about that week
i don't know if when i called you didn't want to speak
i don't know when i'm going to see you again
i don't know if you think about me now and then
i don't realize why our phone conversations got so small
i don't undersand why you put up a huge wall
the only thing i do know is, i fell in love with you
and if you don't know anything either, know that because it's true

things happen for reasons not understood
i want to see you
i wish there was a way i could
please tell me that we'll someday meet again
without your friendship my summer would not be what it's been
we're miles apart and i know you don't care
although i really yearn to be sitting there
right next to you, like it used to be
even though it was just a short while
you made me so happy
the pain i felt was extremely deep and true
but somehow i forgot it all when i was with you
too bad my vacation had to come to an end
because now i feel like i've lost a friend
my feeling for you will not go away
and i seriously doubt that i'll be okay
because i know you don't feel the same
after a few weeks you won't even remember my name
every first star in the sky at night that i see
i make a wish that you'll fall in love with me
although sadly wishing is all that i can do
it's just too bad because i know they'll never come true

betrayer has become your new name
our friendship will never again be the same
you lied to me every way you could 
i won't forgive you don't think i should
so many hours i spent thinking of our future and past
plans i had for us got broken so fast
it was all your fault i won't take any of the blame
because of what you did i'll never be the same
you hurt me and left with so much pain
you made me feel like i had nothing to gain
don't think i'm going to keep the promises i made to you
because you never kept my sectrets, you were so untrue
i thought you cared i guess i was wrong
i can't believe you lied for so long
you don't have to worry about me ever again
because we are no longer friends
i'm so sick of you only pretending to care
because when i really need you, you're never there"

"event","So you think you can walk all over her and treat her like a doll? She has feeling and when you're done with her you can't just put her on a shelf for a later day. She thought she ment something to you, I guess she was wrong but it doesn't matter because she's done with you and now she's gone. You'll never find another like her and it's up to you whether you want to be a part of her life or not. Don't go looking for things you already have and don't pretend to feel sorry for the hurt you cause; don't be sad. Even though it might suck, life has to go on and whether or not you chose to be part of her life is your decision. From your point of view she understands why you did what you did but to her it was so selfish. She knows that you weren't willing to waste your time on her so now she needs to ecxept that her time will be better wasted on someone else. Someone who cares and who knows what they want because it seems to her that when you think you want something it slips away and you let it die. and then that wonderfully beautiful person that you tormented and played with like a doll is tossed aside. Rejected and confused with the short, unfilling answers she recieves. She thinks about you, the good and the bad, and now the bad takes over because she can truly see how you made her become tomorrows trash."

We'll all look the same someday 
And even now the robot starts to think 
I wonder what it dreams


""Concealer""

With fists raised high in tightened knots 
The room explodes and now this blood is on your hands 
And there is no time for a second chance 
To paint my face with blood and tears and cover up 
In an open book that no one reads 
A misspelled word that no one knows 
You stole the rain 
Then you turned around and tore my life in two 
Just like the picture that once hung on the wall in the room that we used to share 
So fold me up and put me back in the place where you used to keep your heart 

You think its getting smaller? 
It's been that way for quite some time now 

The cadence beats down on the tar 
It sounds the same as your fists raining down 
(if you wanted to change the way I look at you...) 
We've got to leave before the sun sets 
Or maybe we don't have time(time to waste.) 
It won't be long until you're gone into the night 
You won't have time to paint my face with cover-up


""Autobiography Of A Nation""

Write these words back down inside 
We have burned their villages and all the people in them died 
We adopt their customs and everything they say we steal 
All the dreams they had we kill 
Still we all sleep sound tonight 
Is this what you wanted to hear? 
We erased all their images and dance 
And replaced them with borders and flags 

At the top of this timeline you'll remember 
This is the lipstick on the collar 
And in my own life I've seen it in the mirror 
sometimes at the cost of others hopes 

So write these words back down inside 
That's where you need it the most 
and without conviction of heart you will never feel it at all 
Yeah, we all dance to the same beat when we we're marching 
Yeah, the TV tells us everythign we need to know 
And this scene is painting in all the fashions of the moment 
And history is all the same 

Everything you say you stole 
Every dream you dream you bought


""A Hole In The World""

In this blackout inertia will hold our thoughts 
And the exit sign offers no light to see by 
Can we cast our shadows alone in the dark? 
I can't see without you 

When the world comes crashing down 
Part with it 
Start again 
When the world comes crashing down 
These notes will fold themselves 
Standing at the margin's edge to see where the daybreak ends 
You can find compassion here 
But the page turns too fast 

We fell in this hole that opened up 
Giving up on hope 
Living without love 
And we still type black lines 
When the world comes crashing down 
These notes will fold themselves 

Adjust the aperture to focus on the negative 
Like phosphors in the darkroom ignite 
Like dodging faces in the corner of the print 
Frame by frame this hole is opening and we fall in 

There is no such thing as whole 
There is a hole in the world

""Cross Out The Eyes""

Let's call this the quiet city: 
Where screams are felt as a wave of stoplights 
Drive through the the streets as gunshots punctuate the night 
The sides we take divide us from our faith 
And the mourning dove gets caught in the telephone wire 

Asleep you set the fire in your own house 
And the night was a knife that cut 
And I'm paralyzed 

Cross out the eyes 
Blur all the lines 
Tearing this canvas from the wall 
We crossed out the eyes 
Put lines through these cries 
We pulled all the leaves from the trees that fall 

A silent dance that we did into this hospital bed 
Hear voices from another room 
""It happens all the time"" 
But July in the sand 
Then the leaves that fall 
And counting down our days to live.... 
Drain the blood from this valentine. 

""We can rise on the wings of the dove 
See blue skies getting caught in the trail of all this smoke 
We can rise like candles in the dark your always"" 
and an envelope marked with your new address 

It was the first time face to face 
I'm crossing the line 
Talking to the other side of death 
Hearing the words that choke memories into flatlines 
I'm calling your name, I'm hoping for something to wash these dreams of you away 

Our fence was blown down in a winter storm and this field 
stretched out of this world into the sound of a trace of blood in a love song 
What can we do to put a stop to the coming white days? 
I'm hoping for something to wash these dreams of you away.


""Paris In Flames""

Now its time to wrap our fears in the night 
And on the first day we'll dress this city in flames 
After all the things you say 
You hate me for being this way 

Still you won't let go of old ideals 
There is no headline to read at night 
When the record slips and you're not holding the needle 

We all sing the songs of separation 
And we watch our lives bleed out through our hands 
Thats how it was on the first day 
We saw Paris in Flames 

I think it's going to rain, rain down 

Here in this collapsed lung of a borough 
There is no sunlight 
The sunlight is manufactured in a windowless room 
Distant and incoherent 
Businessmen hang themselves 

The lower cast side is a jukebox playing the deadman's crescendo 
The needle is a vector 
An intersection that well all must cross 
A dimly lit hallway where shadows of moths decorate the walls 
Discard this message 
Burn this city down 

Discard this message 
Throw this bottle back in the ocean 
Rip this page from the history books 
Smash all the street signs 
Erase all the maps 
Forget my name 
Forget my face 
Because it's going to rain 
And it never ends


""I Am The Killer""

Tuesday wakes up silent 
And there aren't enough pills to sleep 
And then it cuts out like miswired shortwave radio 
It's over 
But nothing can change to ever make it right 
When you live in a nightmare 
It's written all over your face. 

And in a short time 
You're never the same again 
The distance is streamlined 
Between decision and defense: 

Distorient the senses 
Loss of identity 
No one to trust 

Life runs through this trade 
I am no killer 
But I still hide my face 
In the coming days 

I wake up every morning 
From the same dream 
And then I kill it 
But you can't change the letters when the ink dries 

I woke up on the sidewalk and everything just changed 
Now the lights are blinking but I can't see anything 

Everything is falling apart: 
Crumpled paper 
Crushed tin cans 
Broken bottles 
Paper scraps 
We all look the same 
We all look the same 
But I am the killer


""Standing On The Edge Of Summer""

In this room I'm sitting by your side. 
It rains for hours and the phone is off its hook. 
Standing on the edge, casting lots to set me up before you knock me down, 
off the summer's edge and drown me. 
We're betting on our own lives, making up for all the time we lost.
In this house of cards we're all holding hearts and spades
(one breath, one step could knock it all down) 
but you lead with your eyes and you give it away 
(decide, design to cut from the clouds). 
When the people you love get lost in the shuffle, 
(when you leave, you leave nothing but broken hearts)
you let it go and then you fold. 
So we stay on the open road. 
We drive for hours and still no end in sight at all. 
Driving in your car, miss the stop sign, fall in love, just to get knocked out. 
Pull your punches and burn with your cigarettes. 
Pulled like a punch and burnt like a cigarette?
forever.

""Wind Up""

Just ahead I see you winding up 
And you're dressing this color on the edge of fire 
Until these tightened strides 
They march in time again 
I don't know if I will cut through 

I don't know if my heart will beat without you guiding it 

Winding up 
Leading me 
Winding up to explode 

It's the sound of your racing heart 
That beats in time with every start 
(the start of the year. the start of life. the start of war) 
That reaches up and across the sky 
That makes us want to try 

I'm falling to peices 
I can't let go 
Tearing apart your lies 
I want to live 

It's the sound of your shotgun pulse 
Beating over and over in your silent halls 
It's a thought that keeps us alive 
It makes us want to rise 

A scream to guide me through my life 
Winding up 
Leading me 
Winding up to what you can not unwind 

This side of you and if it's taken away 
You won't know what to do 
You're stretching to meet expectations that you will never reach 

And now it's far to late to ever leave this cold 

I'm giving up 
Marching in time with your drums 
I'm letting go of everything i once loved


""How Long Is The Night""

If we run far away do you think we will ever die? 
We'll throw these books in the fire 
Can you stop the train 
Cause it some delay? 
The change machine lied 
And it's too late to scream 

How long is the night? 
It's never over 
The ribbon was tied 
But the card was never read 
The ribbon was crimson 
The color of the night 

Can you see the handwriting on the walls 
And on the autumn leaves that fall 
""What are we gonna do?"" 
The trees are giving up on us 
The needle and the thread 
Won't stitch us to the branch 
And the night never ends 

I will never sleep again 
(I will never even close my eyes) 

If the sun is on its way 
Then we will never die 
And we'll follow these tracks to the sight 
Now the lungs collapse 
And the air is getting thin 
All breath expired 
Is too late to heal? 

How long is the night? 

It's all I ever see anymore 
But the day was so bright in the pictures 
In the photo album that you gave me 
It's all I have to live for 

I'm falling down 
And you're not here to break my fall 
I shut my eyes when you're around 
I hold my breath to kill the sound of your voice 
I'm falling down. 
And you're not here to break my fall

""!1100""

We'll all look the same someday 
And even now the robot starts to think 
I wonder what it dreams 
The Tide is high on Fourtheeth Street 
The rain comes in to clear the heat 
The way in is the same way out 
the way up is the same way down 
Now there is no safe way down"

FUCK KATIE! well, i shouldn't say that because she could be a really nice little slut. who knows? but i was thinking about stevie yesterday and the picture i have of him by my bed and everything that happened between us. he was and is so fake. i cant stand it. so it's 11 am and i've been at school for 3 and a half hours and we had to give a speech in health but my group, sunnie, ana and i had no idea what we were supposed to do because every body had these big posters and all we had was a black and white picture that we printed out 5 minutes before class started. Matt wrote me this email about how i remind him of carrissa. i really don't care anymore if he wants to be pissed at me for scratching his cd go ahead. i wonder if rene's here today. hummmmm.....oh yeah and he thinks he's so fucking mature but when he talks bad about people and says shit about people behind their backs is that really being as mature as he says he is? NO he's such a fucking hypocrite. okay, two of my favorite songs for the moment:


I met you at the club that night
around was spinning records
and my heart said
hey now
hey now
hey now
hey now
yaaaow

you said you were pleased to meet me
through the sweet smell of your perfume
blew me
away now
away now
away now
away now
yaaaow

later on that week we went out, 
talked under the stars until the next 
day now
day now
day now
day now
yaaaow

you drank your fruitopia
and we never ran out of things to
say now
say now
say now
say now
yaaow

any minute im not with you
i hope ill see you soon
theres just something that happens
when you walk into the room

and instantly i feel so complete
it hits me right about the time you kiss my cheek
and you give me this feeling
its like no other feeling
but it knocks me off my feet

please dont ask me what i like about you
cause its every little thing you do
and thats just the way you make me feel

and i dont think
that there are any others out there like you
and i wont blink cause that would mean 
i would miss a second beside you

and maybe you know what i mean
or maybe this is just a dream
i pinch myself just to make sure
but im still here and there you are
i wonder why we just met now
it just kind of happened somehow
but here we are together and
thats all that matters in the end

and instantly i feel so complete
it hits me right about the time you kiss my cheek
and you give me this feeling
its like no other feeling
but it knocks me off my feet

please dont ask me what i like about you
cause its every little thing you do
and thats just the way you make me feel

you can never ask for too much
cause id travel the world just to feel your touch
thats just the way you make me feel


AND THEN THIS SONG!!

playground school bell rings again
rain clouds come to play again
has no one told you she's not breathing?
hello i'm your mind giving you someone to talk to
hello

if i smile and don't believe
soon i know i'll wake from this dream
don't try to fix me i'm not broken
hello i'm the lie living for you so you can hide
don't cry

suddenly i know i'm not sleeping
hello i'm still here 
all that's left of yesterday


Hello
I've waited here for you
Everlong
Tonight
I throw myself into
and out of the red out of her head she sang
Come down and waste away with me
down with me
Slow out you wanted it to be
over my head, out of my head she sang
and I wonder
when I sing along with you
If everything could ever feel this real forever
If anything could ever be this good again
the only thing I'll ever ask of you
you've got to promise not to stop when I say when
Breathe out
so I can breathe you in
Hold you in
and now
I know you've always been
out of your head out of my head i sang


I met a girl named Tara
She lived in the heart of america
She liked black caddies
Listened to puff daddy
Danced until her legs were sore

She worked around the corner
At the diner with the grouchy owner
And her boyfriends shady, dates another girl named katie
he loves her definately maybe

dont think i can take it
wake me when its over
so far away
i wish that it was closer
i see you every day
im too scared to go over
i wonder what she'd say
i barely even know her

chorus:
and how much longer
will this keep getting stronger
i wonder what shes doing when im singing myself to sleep
cause hes a faker
so see ya later
i wonder when you realize that she means a lot more to me

i saw you in the hallway when my last class was just over
it was friday, school was out tonight
everything seems to be allright
i said yo are you going to the party at the cove
hes picking me up six again and i dont wanna disappoint my boyfriend

and shes staring at his picture hanging in her locker
shes telling all the girls about all the things that he bought her
i saw what really happened all those times he went for water
when we were at the movie theatre watching harry potter
he had his hands on
every single girl he laid his eyes on
hate to break it to you, hes a pylon
and even when he kissed her
he was looking over, staring at her sister"

""Understanding In A Car Crash""

Splintered piece of glass falls, in the seat, gets caught 
These broken windows, open locks, reminders of the youth we lost 
In trying so hard to look away from you 
we followed white lines to the sunset 
I crash my car everyday the same way 

Time to let this pass 
(the time it takes, the time it takes to let go) 
Time runs through our veins. 
(it starts and stops and starts and stops again) 
We don't stand a chance in this threadbare time 
(the time it takes, the time it takes to let go)
Time to let this pass 
(the time it takes, the time it takes to let go)

Staring at the setting sun 
No reason to come back again 
The twilight world in blue and white 
The needle and the damage done 

I don't want to feel this way forever 
A dead letter marked return to sender 

The broken watch you gave me turns into a compass 
It's two hands still point to the same time 12:03, our last goodbye 

So push the seats back a little further
I can see the headlights coming 
So push the seats back a little further
Roll the windows down and take a breath
I can see the headlights coming
They paint the world in red and broken glass

Time to let this pass 
(the time it takes, the time it takes to let go) 
Time runs through our veins. 
(it starts and stops and starts and stops again) 
We don't stand a chance in this threadbare time 
(the time it takes, the time it takes to let go)
Time to let this pass 
(the time it takes, the time it takes to let go)

Staring at the setting sun 
No reason to come back again 
The twilight world in blue and white 
The needle and the damage done 

I don't want to feel this way forever 
A dead letter marked return to sender 

The spinning hubcaps set the tempo, for the music of the broken window 
The Cameras on and the cameras click 
We open up the lens and kiss the...

Staring at the setting sun 
No reason to come back again 
The twilight world in blue and white 
The needle and the damage done

I don't want to feel this way forever 

The lights are on and the cameras click 
We open up the lens (to broken glass!) 

Staring at the setting sun (Understanding!)
No reason to come back again (In a Crash!)
The twilight world in blue and white (In a Car Crash!) 
The needle and the damage done (I'll Never Understand!)

I don't want to feel this way forever (Understanding!) 
(In a Car Crash!)A dead letter marked return to sender (In a Car Crash!)
In a Crash!"

"event","okay, i dont think he's here today, which sucks cuz i could've stayed home, but i chose to come to school so that maybe i could see him cuz i haven't in 4 days, but now it's gunna be 5 because that little shit head stayed home to sleep which he shouldn't of done because school is really important and he's gunna fail all his classes and i don't know why i'm this upset, well, i'm not upset. i'm just frustrated because he told me to bring cookies so what do i do, bring cookies, but is he here to get them? NO. well, that's not my fault and if he's not here i'm gunna give them to matt. why? because i know he'll eat them and YES, he'll eat them, unlike ben who isn't even here today. but who cares, oh, i bought a whale too! yes i know i copied that girl, but i really don't care. his name is icabus or something like that and i love him. he got intangled when he was a baby! poor whale! hummmmmm......now i'm really bored and i have to print out pictures of a drummer, and other people for me and cynthias science project. great fun! a new life for me with boys who care!"

"event","today, i have 2 periods. why? because i'm not going to the ihs international day at south. it will be boring, stupid, annoying and i will no one to hang out with except for joel but he'll be in class most of the time. well, today is going to be kinda boring. lunch with becca, will be good. cookies for ben. don't know if he'll really eat them. nothings bad in them, i made them. so anyway, life goes on like normal. piano today, don't really know if i'm going to do the chior thing. it would help me a lot, but so much work. i don't know about that. this summer will be fun. matt and aleesha, not gunna happen. why did he have to realize all that stuff now? i don't understand any of it. oh well, things happen for a reason. this gum is nasty. oh, on the radio this morning there was a guy in ohio (the 7th ring of hell) who robbed a bank but he was on an oxygen tank but he left it in the car because he thought that it would be quick, but the glass in the bank was bullet proof and the guy working there wasn't scared and i don't know the rest of the story but it worked out that the pakastinian tackled the robber while a gas station lady ran to the guys car to get him the tank so he wouldn't die. interesting, yes. NO. ummmmmm........... i'm really bored right now and i think i'm going to go look something up because i'm really bored and wasting my time when i could be doing something cool like buying a whale which is what i'm going to do right now! i will name him spartagus and he shall be mine and i shall love him until he gets harpooned! so i'll probably come back later because i'm really bored and i don't have a first period. ummmmmm.... not my fault."

"event","last night, my piano recital. wow, it went really really good! I was last but probably shouldn't have been because Tim was really good. I think he was better than me but you never know. So anyway, today is friday and after my recital, i called ben and he said that he broke it off with katie. i'm so happy about that. he was making me very mad! not anymore though. okay, so, he said that katie didn't have a problem with it, but then i talked to lani and she said that katie was pissed off. oh well, sucks to be her. matt was right, i was getting bored of our relationship. he was not at all what i wanted and honestly right now i don't really know what i want. i thought i wanted ben, but now? now, i have to forgive him because i do want him. i just can't trust him. last night was a good first step. we'll see how it goes. he better be able to do something on monday, if he doesn't i'm gunna be pissed. 
so this kid at my piano recital was talking to Ana and Lissa about us going out. EWWWWW! NO! he is nasty and i can't stand him, then he was talking about condoms and how everybody at his school hates him and shoves him into lockers. The said something about me and tim going out and then in the car my dad said that tim should be my boyfriend. NO! NO! NO! my hena looks really cool! i wonder if ben would go to the library with me, then we could go to that shop so i could get more. it makes me look really brown. There is a dude over there staring at me and it's really creeping me out and i really can't believe that jimmy knows who i am, that's weird. so, ana and lani best friends till the end and i can't break that no matter what so i'm always going to feel out of place when their together. I hope ben doesn't get bored of me or change his mind again. he might, guys are like that and i can't trust him. so, ummmmmm..................people think ryans hot? no, no, he's nice. i really want to make tiffany jealous. the best part about that is i can. why the hell did matt run into cody? i am really mad at him right now, first he breaks up with me, which i was okay with, but still, and then he pushed cody who did nothing, and then he lies to me about coming to my recital. I'm pissed! so anyway, joels advice,
it will get worse before it gets better
ben and kaite=worse
ben and aleesha=better
yep, so that's my story

a peaceful sorrow at home is the best i'll ever be able to offer the world. in the end and so i told my desolation angels goodbye,  A NEW LIFE FOR ME."

Don't know what to do. can't believe it's tomorrow! so freakin scared. spring fest was the stupidest thing i've ever 'seen' in my life. why even have one? i think ben made out with katie again during lunch but i don't know for sure yet. tiffany bass, wow, really doesn't like me, first matt and now ben! she really can't win! oh well, sucks to be he.so lets see, matt said that we weren't ment to be even though i know and he knows that we were. he admitted to me that he made the same mistakes which means a lot because he has a HUGE ego
now i can ask ben because he's sitting here

"event","ok, so now me and matt broke up, again. Yes, again. I have a piano recital this thursday and i'm really scared. I really need to work on my songs! so, ben kissed katie after telling me he liked me, wow, well, he not only kissed her, but they made out and he felt her up. SO, i'm pissed off. but i still like him and i can't really do anything about anything because it's all his choice. I emailed cody today and he said that he's been really busy and i can't do anything about that either. So, life will go on whether i do or not. 
oh, i really like this song by doubtfully yours, i have no idea what its called but i really really like it and ashley is so lucky to have a boyfriend in the band. but ben really needs to make up his mind because after him, i'm done with boys, FOREVER! well, not forever, but for a long time because i'm sick of them all just wanting to be friends!"

"event","Cody told me he likes me on thursday. He said all this really nice stuff about me and blah, blah, blah, life goes on, rah blah, blah, blah, blah life goes on. So then today, matt got mad at me because he wanted me to prove to him that cody didn't mean anything to me by french kissing him in front of Cody, i said no because that would have been really rude, but then matt got mad at me for trying to get nail polish on him when i was joking and it was dry anyway. plus today i told him that me and cody are going out to lunch tomorrow. This will be very interesting. OH and ben crossed off something on his list. He shaved his hair and i can't tell if it looks good or bad because i haven't seen him up close yet. pretty soon. anyway, i love the cd he made me and joel is happy and me and becca are friends and other than my love life, things seem to be going good. 

plus today, after 2nd period mine started, 3 days before it should have"

"event","me and matt have been having some real troubles lately. oh it's so much fun. i can't imagine my life without him and i know in my heart that he's the one for me, but i don't think that he loves me anymore. he doesn't want to spend time with me at school because we should have our own lives. that's what he said to me. i can't believe it. I really need someone right now to be there for me and i have no one. no one at all. i feel so alone and can't believe that matt can be such a hipocrite. one time he got mad at me because i didn't want him to come over and he told me that we should take every chance we can to see eachother. so i said okay and we have only been apart when we really have to be. until friday when he gave me a whole speach about how we're only 15 and how we need to have a life and not spend as much time together. and then he said that he was doing this in the best interest of both of us and that if i thought that this was a slow way to break up (which i do) then i was stupid because he still loves me and he's not gunna cheat on me or break up with me or anything. Yeah right matt, bull shit! his mom realized that something was different with him too and she's talking about family, i'm talking about me. because i need to be selfish now because he's been selfish in our whole realationship, 6 and a half months down the drain. well, not yet but close. i really hope not becauce as much as i'm in love with him, i am so confused about everything i can't even stand it. God, help me. i love him so much."

"event","matt has been gone for 8 or 9 days now. I think i'm gunna go crazy. He's in Costa Rica. visiting family, and having the time of his life, while he leaves me here to rot. surprise, surprise. Easter, wow what happy day, not. I'm at my aunts house right now and all i want to do is go home and wait for the time to go by. I think I've taken just about every quiz on quizilla, that's how bored i am. plus, nothing but matt crosses my mind every 1.9 seconds. my life is pointless right now, and i worried about some of my grades, and there is nothing for me to do but wait, wait, for tonight, wait for tommorrow, wait for matt, who sadly might never come. He feels like a dream, not real. non existant. I don't know how you spell that. But if my heart is anything like what i think it is, all will be well. It's just been so long and I don't feel like anything's going to get better. I just have to wait. 
these are the lyrics to the song 24 by switchfoot:  

Twenty-four oceans, twenty-four skies, 
twenty-four failures in twenty-four tries. 
Twenty-four finds me in twenty-fourth place. 
With twenty-four dropouts at the end of the day. 

Life is not what I thought it was 
twenty-four hours ago. 
Still I'm singing Spirit take me up in arms with you. 
And I'm not who I thought I was 
twenty-four hours ago 
Still I'm singing Spirit take me up in arms with you. 

Twenty-four reasons to admit that I'm wrong. 
With all my excuses still twenty-four strong. 

But see I'm not copping out 
When you're raising the dead in me 

Oh, I am the second man 
Oh, I am the second man now 
Oh, I am the second man now 

And you're raising these twenty-four voices 
With twenty-four hearts 
With all of my symphonies in twenty-four parts 
But I want to be one today 
Centered and true 

I want to see miracles 
To see the world change 
I wrestled the angel 
For more than a name 
For more than a feeling 
For more than a cause 
Singing Spirit take me up in arms with you 
You're raising the dead in me

favorite song for the week that matt's been gone"

No one is really sure what<br>that can always mean, because it can be defined<br>in many ways.

They walk the<br>earth, brooding mysteriously, always appearing<br>when you expect it least. So hence, if you have<br>a Lost Soul, then you are probably very<br>insecure and shy. Stuck in your own little box,<br>you watch the world fly by as a loner. You dont<br>know your place. You seemingly dont have a<br>place in society or an interest. You are a very<br>capricious person, and are confused and<br>frustrated about where you belong. You crave<br>for the sense and feeling of home-but have not<br>obtained it yet.

I'm so tired of being here
Suppressed by all my childish fears
And if you have to leave
I wish that you would just leave
'Cause your presence still lingers here
And it won't leave me alone

These wounds won't seem to heal
This pain is just too real
There's just too much that time cannot erase

When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears
When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears
I held your hand through all of these years
But you still have
All of me

You used to captivate me
By your resonating light
Now I'm bound by the life you left behind
Your face it haunts
My once pleasant dreams
Your voice it chased away
All the sanity in me

These wounds won't seem to heal
This pain is just too real
There's just too much that time cannot erase

When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears
When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears
I held your hand through all of these years
But you still have
All of me

I've tried so hard to tell myself that you're gone
But though you're still with me
I've been alone all along

When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears
When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears
I held your hand through all of these years
But you still have
All of me

i was condemned by satan and he wouldn't stop talking to me in my head
matt, my mom and bruce all didn't believe me and the only person who seemed to care was my grandma
it was the worst dream 
i woke up this morning in a cold sweat and didn't hesitate to junp in the shower at 5:37, 20 minutes after the time i'm supposed to get up
i was so happy that it was a dream cus i could have swore that it was real and i really don't want to think that satan can talk to me when i'm dreaming but if i have another dream like that, i really need to talk to someone who knows what to do. 
I tried to find my favorite quote yesturday but i forgot it, luckily today, i remembered it:

A peaceful sorrow at home is the best I'll ever be able to offer the world, in the end, and so i told my desolation angels goodbye a new life for me.
-Jack Kerouac

the author of the book i was supposed to read for lit class, but i didn't and still managed to get an A on the project 
anyway i'm in the library right now and i'm gunna go sit next to my boyfriend who looks really lonely sitting at the table all by himself.

"event","joel thinks this is my best one:

in me the quiet or the strife
in me the dying or the life
in me the lethargy or the will
in me the power to heal my ill
and when my soul is parched with pain
in my own heaven it will pour rain

but this is the one that's getting published:

Angel of death come claim my life
take me away from my daily strife
angel of darkness be my guide
show me the way to the other side
suck me into a hole in the ground
make my head spin fast around
let me lose all sense of control 
let everlasting pain fill my soul
make me forget the love i've lost
death seems like the perfect cost
and angel of death when you come knocking at my door
i will then be gone forevermore

THIS CLASS SUCKS! all i want to do is go home. Veronica's gunna be on tv and i have a headache. dj's sitting next to me right now and i really want him to leave me alone
i miss matt. i only haven't seen him for a half hour well about 40 min
maybe tomorrow i can find a different place to sit because no matter where i go, dj always finds some way to sit next to me and it makes me really uncomforatble
one of the things that made me cut
it really pissed me off when my mom said she'd rather slash her wrists and die to death than do something i don't remember what the something was but it really pissed me off that she would use that saying in front of me
and it would be better if people never used the words that start with s when they're talking about it, slash and slit mostly you don't slit your wrists, you cut them
and when she found out about it she was really surprised because she had heard me talking about Jessica's cutting and becca's cutting and joel's and stevie's and mostly everybody i know except for matt, and he wont 
he thinks its stupid, like smoking pot, which i don't do anyway
the only thing i really want to do is burn my insence 
i'm done with the past
for now anyway

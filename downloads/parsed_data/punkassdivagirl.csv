Nothin I like better than a work social event... ~hear the sarcasm dripping??~ Actually I love my co-workers; they rock my world.  Nothing else is new today.  The roof of my mouth itches.  Isnt that somethin to write about?  haha.  Today, my self esteem improved.  Lets hope that tomorrow is a stellar day.   Those damn packers are coming to pack up my mom's shit for the move to japan.  I did tell you faithfuls that my mom was moving to japan right?  Hope so.  <3"

"event","Yes.  So.  Hmm. Lastnight at about 10 - 1030 Akira informed me that he just wants to be friends.  -At least thats what i think he said...- but none the less he used the terms ""i have a tendency to slip"" and ""I dont wanna ruin anything cuz face it... we're awesome friends"".  That's not good enough.  I dont even want to be friends with him.  I ACTUALLY HONESTLY thought -yeah that's where I went wrong... I thought- that he really wanted to be with me and that he -I dont know.  All I can say is 'HOW INCREDIBLY STUPID ARE YOU AMANDA???'.  I am a little numb right now.  I dont know what to say or how to say it.  I almost started crying in front of him.  Thank God I didnt.  I start to realize now that he never really liked me.  He only wanted a piece of ass and when he realized that isnt all that I wanted he breaks shit off.  WHAT THE FUCK EVER.  ...if that boy only knew..."

"event","Technically my day started last night.  My dad's truck broke down on me.  I am a sissy girl... I dont know what the fuck is wrong with it but just thinking about it make me infuriated - if that really is a word. My parents keep asking 'well, what's wrong with it?' and OMG I think that if I hear that one more time I will scream and choke someone's neck.  The way I see it is that if I actually knew what was wrong with it I wouldn't be in this shit canoe and I would have fixed it.  But as my mom pointed out to me this morning, you dont very well go to the doctor's when you are sick and say ""I dont know what's wrong just fix it"".  I finally got home last night at about 3 am but I didn't fall asleep until approximately 4 am.  I had to get up for an overseas screening at 7 am.  *For y'all who are unaware, My parent's and my brother are moving to gay-tard Japan*  The icing on the cake is when they made me get on the scale.  Talk about LARD ASS.  And everything has just spiraled down from there.  I feel about as nasty as it gets.  I hate myself for letting me just lose control over something that was going so well for the longest time.  I truly dont understand how I can wonder why guys dont like me when I look like this.  Even as I sit here I want to eat.  That's all I ever want to do.  Stuff my fat fucking face.  I make myself sick.  When did I turn into something that I hate? Why is it that the only thing I can seem to do these days with confidence is cry? I am not going back to dance.  I can't.  I let myself down.  I need to stop being such a sissy."

I have been talking to Cortney a lot lately and it makes me happy.  I like being still connected to Ridgiecresto.  I really wish that I was there right now.  I miss my friends and I miss Jimmy and I miss Nicole and I miss Cortney and I miss Del Taco and shit really I could just go on and on...  I want to go down for a visit.
so I am planning on sending Cortney up here.  I cant wait but it seems like the world is against me in my endeavor.  My dad is gone and I keep having to fix bullshit on the truck.  I think that I am going to buy a new car.  I hope.  I want a cute white one.  or a navy blue one.  or a red one. or a black one.  or one that just works.  haha!
Havent talked to Kirk in FOREVER. eh.  It was good while it lasted.  Talked to Ryan a few weeks ago.  God he makes me smile. I really should go and see him... *smile* :0) and I called Stevie on his b-day!  Yay for mah bestest buddie Stevie!!  Woop woop."

The type of girl that will getchu up and go make you grind (grind)

Dirty, making her mine
Look at her hips, look at her legs, Ain't she stacked (stacked)
I sure wouldn't mind hittn' that from the back (back)
I like it when I touch it, cuz she moan lil bit
Jeans saggin', so I can see her thong lil bit
I know she grown lil bit, 20 years old, you legal
Don't trip off my people, just hop in the regal
I swoop on her like an eagle, swoop down and rate
I know your popular, but you gon be famous today

[Chorus]

Man she's soo stacked, does she knows that I want that
He make he's soo whack, girl can i taste your cat
Gave her 300$ to spend, like buying a throw-back
She stay in the club, like they be saying she got it
In real life, girl remind me of pochantas
She be at events, like the best when she past
All the high rollin' cats, wana pay for that ssss
Niggas half steppin', strapped with a nice weapon
It's against the law for her to move them hips
If you ever seen it dirty, your mouth gone drop
World wide, fools volenteer tell you its off top

I like the way you do that right thurr (right thurr)
Swish your hips when you walk, let down your hair (down your hurr)

Gimmie what you got for a pork chop (uh)
She threw it at me like I was a show stop (uh)
Twerkin in a phatty girl halter top
Then she backed it up on me, and let it drop (drop)
Make it hop (boing) , like a bunny (bunny)
Can I touch you where it's sunny
Or embarrass, and make you give us some money 
She should pose for sports illustriated 
It's like a picture perfect site
when she passed all the other girls hated.

[Chorus]
But I like the way you do that right thurr (right thurr)
Swish your hips when you walk, let down your hair (down your hurr)
I like the what you do that right thurr (right thurr)
wet your lips when you talk,that make me slurr (make me slurr)
I like the way you do that right thurr (right thurr)
Swish your hips when you walk, let down your hair (down your hurr)
I like the what you do that right thurr (right thurr)

I hate being boyfriend-less because it makes me want to hook up with old flames.  But Really I need to move on with the new.  -If I find someone patient and perfect for me... He doesnt have to be 'perfect'... just perfect for me.   as if that made any sence.   my mother and I have been getting along a lot better these days.  I attribute it to the fact that I am never really home any more.  I have been kickin it with my newest greatest friend Morgan.  I love  her!!  She is just like me.  It is so fuckin crazy!!  I also luuuuvvv my newest bestest friend Megan!  She is sooo much fun.  Life is definately good right now.   I really want to start taking violin lessons.  It is such a beautiful instrument.  sigh.

And I also had to sit towards the middle of the church.  TALK ABOUT BEING PISSED OFF.  Yeah so I havent been on here in like forever.  Not much has changed.  I talked to Cassie the other day.  That made things here in Washington much more bearable.  I miss her and Cammie sooo sooo sooo sooo much.  Its not even funny.  Washington is so dark and dingy and lonely.  I am working on a diabolical scheme... muah ha ha and I am hella excited.  I pray and hope and wish that all goes as according to plan.  I miss Jimmy.  I had a dream the other night that jimmy was getting married.  It sucked cuz the wife wasnt me and she was pissed cuz she found out that she wasnt the only on in his life.  but I really wasnt even with him.  It was confusing.  It just made me want him more.  I miss california sooo sooo bad.  Sigh.  Im talking to Kirk right now.  He makes me smile.  Well, enough of this for now.  Guess I will write more later... maybe"

We had to run back home cuz he forgot his headgear -poor kid- and then we went to the orthodontists office.  Nothing exciting happened.  I sat in the waiting room for 15 minutes and then we were done.  Then I went to the post office and then we drove down by the beach...(gotta love living on an island).  TA DA.  thats is.  I was highly disappointed.



Tonight...is a new episode of Dawson's Creek.  I cant believe that my favorite show ends this year.  It's like a small part of my life is over.  The only thing that I have that has been consistant since high school.  That and my friendship with Nicole.  I guess that after 2 damn years its time to let go of hs.  But it hurts me so.  Agh.  


I need a boyfriend.  Someone to love on.  I miss Jimmy :(  I miss kirk being all lovey with me.  Fuck  I even miss fun Bobby."

I cant really decide if it really works.  I went to bed earlier than usual but I just kinda layed there for a bit.  I finally fell asleep.  Are those things addictive?

That means that I am being adopted.  I have mixed feelings about it really.  Which is the lesser of 2 evils Along or Chenard?  Yeah um okay I just blasted my last name on the internet huh?  Oh well.  I had to say it for you to get the full effect.  Amanda Chenard.  Yall get used to it.  I think that maybe the only other thing I have to tell yous guys about is my latest catch.  He's a Helicopter pilot.  mmmm Amanda's got herself a little navy boy.  SCORE!  Oh yeah and his name is Bobby."

"event","You know I really have to stop watching Dawson's Creek.  I love that show so much though it's not even funny.  Sometime's I feel like I totally relate to the show but then like I do something psycho like get all protective over Pacey like its MY boyfriend/bestfriend/whatever.  Im bordering on the edge of obsessed and its digusting.  It all started my junior year when I had a little Dawson-Joey-Pacey love triangle of my own going on.  I used it as a crutch to get through my worst time...well one of them.  And now its like I gave birth to the damn show or something.  It could be Chad Michael Murray (Charlie) who is totally and completely undeniable gorgeous that is making me so emotional over Dawson's too.  When ever I watch it I get this horrible feeling in my gut.  Like when someone dumps you.  It really sucks.  I balled like a baby when Dawson and Jen broke up last week.  I am totally rooting for Joey and Charlie.  I am torn with Pacey and Audrey.  I like them both but I am crushed that Pacey and Joey arent together anymore because face it - they are perfect for eachother.  2 wild children dont belong together.  MAYBE just maybe Dawson should be with Audrey and Joey still with Pacey.  I will give Joey and Pacey props though for remaining friends.  We really dont know what is going on with Jack lately.  Which is really too bad.  I like him for Daniel's sake.  (sigh.  I miss you best friend).  

I think that Dawson and his little group of friends remind me of my friends in Spain a little.  I missed them so much.  I am so glad to just be reconnecting with them.  Unfortunately I've already missed out on 3 years of there lives.  They were my first group of real friends.  If I was to assign them characters (well first off I would have to group like 3 of them in 1 person) but they would be: I of course am Dawson, Joey would be Andrea cuz she's still my best friend, Pacey would be Jimmy and Butch, Audrey would be Shavonne, and all the others that I really dont keep in touch with that much  would be Andi because we never hear about her.  (Actually I didnt like Andi but that doesnt mean that the ppl I clumped with her I dont like.  Au contrair.  I LOVE my friends!)  I would have to make up a whole new character for Megan Horry though.  I would call her Celeste.  I dont know why I just would.
hmm.  Rambling on about Dawsons Creek.  At least I feel a little better.
heh.  Dont get me started on Felicity..."

And though my heart is eating for ya, I can't stop crying
I don't know how I allow you to treat me this way and still i stay

So sad, so sad what love will make you do
all the things that we accept, be the things that we regret
too all of my ladies (ladies) feel me c'mon sing wit me

See, when I get the strength to leave
you, always tell me that you need
me, and I'm weak cause I believe 
you, and I'm mad because I love
you. so I stop and think that 
maybe, you can learn to appreciate
me, then it all remains the same
that, you ain't never gonna change
(never gonna change, never gonna change)

and though my heart can't take no more I keep on running back to you

Baby why you hurt me
leave me and desert me
boy I gave you all my heart and all you do is tear it up

looking out my window
knowing that I should go
even when I pack my bags
This something always hold me back"

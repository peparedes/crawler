I guess when you're one of 4 people that dress up for Halloween any costume works.

Out of the 30 or so people in my department 4 dressed up.  Two Scadians came in their garb (Norse women) and one cat-girl (not a sexy one).

"event","I'm breaking a cardinal rule, don't post drunk, but it's important.

I was taking my cab home and the cab stops to pick up someone else.

Now, usually I mind this, but this girl was in trouble.

She gets into the cab and I know she's been crying.

I don't care who you are, there's no reason to leave some poor girl crying to try to get a cab.

I know I've done my share of heart-breaking, but this girl was in dire straits.

I felt bad for her, I wanted to be sure she was okay.  I didn't know her, but I wanted to make sure she got home okay.

I don't know what happened to make her cry, but I was damn sure I it wasn't an okay night for her and I wanted her to be okay.

I know she won't read this, but I feel for her.

Where ever you are girl: I hope everything is okay.  Whoever they were, boy or girl, They weren't worth making you cry over.

I'll read this tomorrow and be a little embarassed, but whoever she was, she deserved better."

"event","I must have a huge karmic debt from a previous life.  As hard as I try I never seem to find the right woman.

I'm polite, well-groomed, handsome, funny, kind and stuff.  These are qualities that make me a great catch for any woman, but I never seem to have any luck in that area.

I'm pretty sure the universe has decided I'm not supposed to be with anybody.

Maybe it's the crowd I hang out with.  More and more of the people I meet are polyamorous, I'm not suited for that.  I'm beginning to think I'm in the minority being a straight mono-amourous male.

I've been single too long.  I haven't had someone to call my girlfriend in 10 months.  Yes, I've had sex during this time, but I need more than that and the women I've met either can't or won't provide what I need.

Right now I'm something to many people.

I need to be everything to somebody."

"event","I don't have allot of faith in people.

I've found that if I expect to be disappointed by someone or something I'm usually correct.  I try to be as self-reliant as possible because people aren't reliable.  I don't like to go anywhere I can't get back from on my own.  I don't ask people for help because I don't expect them to.

It's not like I don't hope things will be different.  ""Hope for the best, expect the worst."" is my motto.

I give people the benefit-of-the-doubt, but I'm rarely surprised when they disappoint me."

"event","My roommate hasn't had a job for about 2 months (He walked out of his last one so UE is a no go) and hasn't paid me yet for either the April or May phone bills or the power bill.

Last night was the last straw.  Rent was due yesterday, the 5th of the month, just like every month.  Kirk is no where to be found.  Now, I'm not going to ruin my rental history because of him so I pay the rent for the whole month leaving me with nothing for the next 2 weeks.

Last night has shown me I can afford my apartment without a roommate.  Either he pays me what he owes me tonight, or he's out at the end of the month.  

My generous nature has it's limits."

"event","One of my greatest fears is the fear of being boring.

I don't make up stories about myself to seem more interesting.  All the embarrasing stories I tell about myself are true they actually happened to me.

But, I don't have any trauma.  I have this weird thought that being without trauma makes me less interesting, less deep.

I was never abused as a child, I've never been addicted to drugs, I've never lived on the street, my parents are still married to each other, I've lead a pretty comfortable life.

What do people say about me behind my back?  I hear what other people say about each other, I know what I say about other people.  People are talking about me, I just wish I knew what they were saying."

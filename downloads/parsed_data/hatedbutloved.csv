1. At least 2 people in this world LOVE you so much they would DiE for you.

2. At least 15 people in this world love you in some way.

3. The only reason anyone would ever hate you is because they want to be just like you.

4. A SMiLE from you can bring happiness to anyone, even if they don't like you.

5. Every night, SOMEONE thinks about you before they go to sleep.

6. You mean the world to someone.

7. If not for you, someone may not be living.

8. You are special&unique.

9. Someone that you don't even know exists, loves you.

10. When you make the biggest mistake ever, something good comes from it.

11. When you think the world has turned its back on you, take a look: you most likely turned your back on the world.

12. When you think you have no chance of getting what you want, you probably won't get it, but if you BELiEVE in yourself, probably, sooner or later, you will get it.

13. Always remember the compliments you received. FORGET about the rude remarks.

14. Always tell someone how you feel about them; you will feel much better when they know.

15. If you have a GREAT FRiEND, take the time to let them know that they are great.

i was woken up by my stepdad tellin me Happy thanksgiving and a pink rose.. AWWW and then he was like ok now you have to get out of bed and help us. lol. yeah nice.. UGH. so i get up and then my cousins Amy and Tom showed up.. then brittany. then Josh.. and then while we were eating.. tyler called.. and he needed us to come get him.. so we left.. and went to get him.. and then we came back, and he ate, and then we started playin games. all the games we played that night.. were, Kemps, Uno, Poker, Monopoly, Clue, some weird but cool card game.. that we played for like 3 hours!!but it was cool.. Tyler was like messin with Cody and he was getting so pissed. it was kinda embarrassing how Cody was acting. but oh well.. i couldnt do anything about it. Tom was sleeping over, and Brittany and Tyler didnt leave until 3:30. so we stayed up talking and everything until they left. and then i FINALLY went to bed.. like an hour after they left. *sleeping as been so bad for me.. lately.. i dont get much sleep at all.. and i hate it.. i wish i had those sleeping pills again, i know they didnt work after about a month of taking them.. but maybe i could get a stronger one or something.. * then i woke up **its now Friday at 1:23* and i got up and got dressed and then i went to Alex's to chill with him for a bit. hes still laid up since he tore his ACL in his leg.. and hes going to be laid up for a while. maybe surgery.. so i went over.. hes been wanting to watch How High.. so i brought it over.. but Nicks Playstation chose not to play it.. so we ended up sittin around watching TV and i was playin on his comp.. and then i had his mom bring me home.. and i talked to my baby for a bit.. which was good.. and then i had to leave yet again.. because i was going to Brittanys house. so then she comes.. and we go to MCD's because i wanted a McChicken like HARDCORE!!  and then we came back to here.. and we ate. and then we were chillen and nothin.. and nothin but chillen. then i dyed Brittanys hair.. which looks awesome right now.. its like all black with purple on the bottom. its def. hott. Yay for me and my hair dyin! so then brad shows up right in the middle of that.. and we chill with him for awhile. and then he decided to leave beause now its like 2 or something in the morning. and then i decided that i wanted my eyebrow pierced.. so we did that since she had one more needle left. and then we just hung out and talked. we didnt go to sleep until like 7 in the morning.. so then the phone wakes us up.. and its brad. and he wants to come over.. so brittany's like umm yeah alright.. so he comes over and wakes me up with a SPIDERMAN book.. omg omg  O M G! i love it. lol not as much as the other one im reading.  so then we lay around for awhile and then i had to go back to my house to do my chores *gag me*so blah blah blah chores,, blah blah blah.. ok then we come back here and eat pizza and play some cards.. then i called Tyler.. and he was like yeah.. ill call you back to let you know.. if im comming or not.. so we play a little bit more cards.. and then me and brad went to go get tyler.. and Brittany was waiting for Andy to get here so they could go get Jenni. so then me and brad og outside.. and yeah , his car.. was DEAD. we had to jump it. and it was Lightly Snowing!! yay so we leave.. we go get tyler.. and we are driving back.. yeah brad almost missed the exit.. so he turned the wheel.. and since the road was wet.. and his driving sucks. we swerved around on the highway.. almost hit the Exit sign.. and i hit my head on the window. next thing i know.. we are stopped.. and stuck.. in a ditch. i was so shooken up.. so much shit was goin thru my head.. which was throbbing like none other. people kept stopping and asking if we needed help and what not.. so i called brittany and told her that we had gotten into a slight incident. then the cop showed up.. took out names.. looked at the car.. and then said he'd call a tow truck. before the cop had even gotten there.. we had tried to push it out.. and we had tried to back it out.. but when i say ditch..i mean DITCH. brad kept asking if i was ok.. and i kinda was.. kinda wasnt. i told him how i hit my head on the window.. and he was huggin me and i pushed him off.. i was like.. no if you werent dumb.. we wouldnt be in this ditch. tyler was tellin me it would be ok.. so then after the cop showed up and said he would get a tow truck.. he said we should go wait in the car.. bc at least it was warm. so we go down there and sit in the car.. tyler had been sayin how fun it was and how he wanted to do it again. and im like UGH no.. ill pass. so then we're sittin there.. and brittany and andy show up.. but then we go talk to them.. and the tow truck shows up. so then brittany and andy went to get jenni and we told them,  that we would meet them here.. so we FINALLY get the car out of the ditch.. and a trip to the gas station and $73.50 later.. we're back at brittanys. lol.. so then i went up and took a nice HOTT shower.. then blah blah blah.. then JENGA tyme. finally. haha so we start to play Jenga.. and my head still hurts.. and it was still fun. Brittany had to make out with Jenni like mad tymes.. lol. i think they loast count after like 5. lol.. and brad .. who i was still a lil upset at.. had been being an ass.. well i picked the block that said. take an article of clothing from the person next to you. so i took brad's hoody.. which i absolutly love. lol. southpole.. and omg its SO warm. and FUZZY! so then a few turns later i somehow manage to pick the same block. lol.. so i take brad's shirt.. muhahah im thinking you know bc hes shy and all.. PAY BACKS A BITCH. lmao.. but then a few turns later.. it got more interesting.. because i got the block again.. since brad was only wearing pants and boxers.. i asked tyler. if i could have his shirt.. and hes thought about it.. and told me.. not thime around.. so i looked at brad and he was like nooo.. and i was like come on.. i need your pants.. lol. so he takes off his pants.. and the game goes on.. so after awhile.. i got the block again.. and tyler still wouldnt give up his shirt.. so brad was offically screwd. he handed me his boxers.. and now.. brad was nakey. haha he deserved it. i really didnt want to see brad naked.. bc thats just not. some thing i want to see. but it was funny. and pay back is a bitch. so the game goes on.. but we were kinda getting bored with it. so.. when the towers fell down.. brad got his clothes back.. and we decided to play cards again.. but then jenni had to go downstairs and talk to someone on the phone. so the game got put on hold.. and then brittany went down there to talk to her. and me and tyler started playin Quarters.. with a poker chip.. oh man. his knuckles look ALOT worse then myne. haha yeah and guess what time tyler and brad left? yeah 3:30. lol i tihnk thats going to be an everytime thing. so then me and brittany liad around for awhile.. after we cleaned everything up.. and finally went to  bed around.. like 4:30 and then woke up around 2.. ish.  and no here i am.. we're watching The Nightmare Before Christmas.. and its 4:33.. and i have to go home soon.. bc i want to take a nice warm shower.. and lay down for a bit.. my head hurts.. ive been taking aspirin. and its not helping. and i have a bump on my head.. from hitting the window.. i have a mild concussion. and i dont really remember much from the accident.. excpet swerving on the road.. and then being in the ditch. we were close to the wall. and i dont know how i would have been had we hit the wall. or flipped the car..like me and tyler thought was going to happen.. but im glad no one got hurt.. but now my wrists hurt.. my knuckels hurts.. and i want to fiinish this movie.. so ill write more later..

""people say, when your'e dreaming and you fall off a building.. you always wake up before you hit the ground, and if you dont then you die in your sleep"" 
*blinking light*  news flash.. its not true. 

Every month i have this dream.. this is how it goes.

i see myself. standing on the roof of a building.. i look down. its a long way down. then i jump. and i see myself falling. i see myself hit the ground. dead. and i see it. and then nothing but black. and then i see myself hanging myself in a basment with a rope. and i see myself kick out the chair. dead. then black. then i see my self loading a hand gun. then aiming. and i see myself pull the trigger. i see myself fall to the ground dead. then black. thats how it goes.. 

Jump off building, 
hanging
shooting
drowning
fire
car accident
slit my wrists
OD
poison. 
every month its a new method. this month.. plane crash.  figure the odds. *chills*  i hate this dream. im not sucidial either.. anyone who knows me, know im NOT. but this re occuring dream.. scares me. i wish i knew why i dream this.. i just dont know.. but its horrible.. i wish it would stop.

oh i got to talk to my sister tonite.. shes doing good. alot better then she was doing when i left.. but its all good.. shes proud of me for how good im doin in school. hell i am too. Brittany has been a big help.. if get so frustrated in math. and shes like NO DONT GET MAD.. JUST DO IT.. haha but its good.. i gotta have someone who will push me.. and britt is my <strike>Pusher</strike> and she rocks ass. lol.. oh and we got this dumb problem solving shit commin up these next two weeks.. im glad ""meyer"" said we can work together.. because that way i can ask her if im doing something right.. and she can be like.. ""haha your dumb"" and then help me.. ( and the funny thing is.. i can picture her doin it) but its all good.. i think this weekend.. shes havin her friend Jenni over.. which would be cool.. because i hear alot about her.. and from what i hear.. shes cool shit.. but like.. i know shes got alot on her mind.. and i dont want her to have more on her mind.. it might get to heavy for her.. and then i would buy her a head sling. haha that would be funny. i could hang it from the ceiling.. and it could like.. go under her chin. and then she could sit on her chair and just let her head rest in the sling.. and then she could adjust it so she can sit on the floor.. when we play Jenga.. oh man.. im going to invent and patent that idea.. IF her head gets too heavy.. but i DO think it would be cool to chill with more people.. oh man.. Me, Brittany, Jenni, Alex, and Brad.. all playin Jenga.. wowza!! that would be baller.  eh oh well.. i miss my brittany.. shes over her sister's hizouse. and i cant talk to her online.. hmmm. imma go watch Degrassi.. after i download my eminem. then .. <b>BED TYME</b>"

 *The Untouchable*
I put you on a pedestal
up above everyone else.
I placed you up so high
even sometimes, you were
hard to for me to reach.
I liked you way up there
mine .. but not completly.
and everyone saw you up there, 
like some forbidden fruit. 
then came the day,
i had to *take you down*
because i reliezed thats
all you did to me.
and i couldnt deal with it.
so you came down 
and walked away.
just like that.
you didnt even know you were on my pedestal. 
and you didnt even know..
that i found out, 
you werent worth it. 

I dont really know if this is FOR steven.. or what.. but.. eh.. 

on a lighter note..

You walked into my life, when i was down and out 
Took away my pain and gave me your smile 
And at the time, still lovin someone else 
I know why cause baby the reason why I felt the way i felt 
And then one day I realize that you were the one for me 
I was so blind, but baby now I see 

I wish that I could turn back the hands of time 
Cause if I wouldov'e knew your love was like this 
Back then I wouldov'e made you mine, oh yeah 
If I had to die a thousand times a day 
I would do it for you, just to take 
The pain that I have given you away 
Cause I love you and I never want to

Her Name...my everything   when i saw that.. it felt like someone had ripped my heart out, stepped on it and then nailed it to the floor of a basement flooded with steaming hot water with an electric nail gun.  god.. it hurt.. i mean i know he loves me.. but when i see something like that.. i feel like i am sharing him. and then you have to think about when it comes to this triangle thing again.. see me talking to (L) seems to piss (C) off  but could you imagine what would happen if i said that (L) was my everything.. (C) would shit a brick.  but i wouldnt do that.. because ..well i just wouldnt.. but now im all like OMG WTF SOMEONE SHOOT ME!! i cant do this anymore. i really cant. one of these days soon.. im going to break down.. again. but this does change alot. thinking about my heart being ripped out and nailed to the floor with an eletric nail gun.. just gives me a cold chill that wont go away.. like the words in his info.. but i cant do this anymore.. i wont do it.    but whew im glad i got that off my chest. lol oh and let me tell you.. i am still heated about mom bein all "" its a school night.. stay home"" i just wanted to scream..

Thier Waterfall. 

Silently staring
The conversation rushing between them.
There was no stopping now.
Spilling the feelings they had and
 not knowing when to stop.
A break in the moment
 a brief smile of reassurance.
It started again, a waterfall of words
  crashing downs upon the hearts of the source.
And then it was over.
 Everything quiet, calm, 
   and so understood.
The rain came puoring down,
 wahsing over the looks of happiness.
Cleaning thier clearly defined

"event","Friday I was comming home from work and it was snowy and icy...I got into a little accident. I was so upset I didn't get much sleep all weekend and had to work everyday too. I am exahusted. Apparently I messed up my upper and lower ball joints on my drivers side, bent my rim, and put some scratches in my car. I am really still upset about it too.
 I am suppose to be moving in with my friend Karen soon, I am excited about that. I hope that when I do move in with her Ben and I will get to see more of eachother, because my sister doesn't get along with him and I live with her now. But I don't care what she thinks because he is a great guy."

"event","Hey everyone! What is going on? I moved out of my parents house last week! That's pretty damn exciting. ""Our little girl is growing up!"" Ha ha, last night I was cleaning the slicer at work and sliced my thumb, it's pretty sweet! It sliced damn near to the bone. It's at an angle from the bottom of my fingernail to my knuckle. OOPS!"

"event","I am so pissed off at myself. I always seem to mess things up. This time I really messed up. The only guy that I care about, well I definally messed that up. I don't deserve him anyways, he has been so good to me and all I do is keep f***ing it up. He deserves so much better I know, so why am I even so damn upset about it all. I always told myself that I want a good guy, but look, I had one and now that I f***ed things up on more than one occasion...I wouldn't blame him if he never wanted to talk to me again. I wish that I could go back in time and fix everything, but I also have learned from my mistakes. I am so SORRY!"

"event","It has been really hard on me going from being able to see Ben anytime that I wanted to this, not seeing him for a week or so. It's also hard not being able to see my friends either. When I was younger all I wanted was to grow up, but now I don't know if I can handle it. It's a lot of work and responsibility. These days pass by and turn into months, I wonder if I am living life to the fullest. There is so much that I want out in the world yet I am too afraid to conquer it by myself. I am afraid of leaving this place! I would miss my family and friends too much. But I also know that there aren't many restaurants here, therefore I might miss out on a culinary oppertunity. I know that I am going to stay until I finish college but after that who knows I might just pack up my balls and leave. No matter where I go I can always come back or people who care about me can come visit me! Should I stay or should I go?"

"event","So I started college, the thing is that I kinda enjoy it! I don't like the homework but I want to get no lower that a B-, so I just have to suffer thru the homework. I am so glad that alot have people have pushed me to go, because now I can get it all over sooner. LOL! It's weird not talking to Ben every night now unlike the summer. We both have school and work so it's all very understandable. It's also weird not going out with my friends at all hours of the night, because they have school too! But we all have to do what we got to do!"

"event","Hey everyone! My parents went out of town for a short while so whoo hooo! Tonight I got off work and couldn't find my little sister anywhere. So when she got home I told her how much trouble she is in...she dyed her hair (my mom is gonna flip when she gets home). Oh well guess theres not much I can do now. It wasn't really my fault because my parents knew I had to work. But anyways...besides having to work all weekend I think it is going to be a pretty cool weekend! Just chilling with my friends. Oh yeah HAPPY BIRTHDAY JOSH!"

"event","Today I am gonna clean the whole house with my mom and lil sister. Because this comming weekend my parents are leaving and I have to work a big ass wedding thing so I won't have time to clean. But I will make time to party. I really hope Ben will come and stay with me, I am too scared to stay alone. Oh last night I bought myself a flip chair because me and my sister had two when we were little but then one day they were gone, and damn it I was upset...So I was in a bad mood last night and thought it would cheer me up! I also got tank tops for $4, that just made my day. Well I am gonna go clean then call Ben and see what he is up to!"

"event","Well last night I went to Ben's around 1 or so...and Ben, Dale, and I stayed up till about 5 then I took Dale home and went back to Ben's. So I got home around 7:30 or so and slept til about 11:30. But when I got up I was shakeing so bad that I puked and I had a bit of a fever...I don't know what the hell was wrong with me. But I went to work anyways. It sucked the members had lobsterfest by the pool and everyone of the cooks and gm's were fighting. Plus poor lil Angie having contractions was sweating and trying to get shit done. I still felt like shit too...So finally I got home and I am gonna take a shower and go out tonight prolly for a lil bit. I am just glad that I am not shaking so badly now. Weird huh?"

"event","Today I went and registered for my last class at Ivy Tech. I am not to thrilled about going back to school. But I know that I will benefit from it in the long run. I am so scared of becoming an adult...I think that I need to get a second job to be able to make my car payments and everything else. 2 jobs plus college, that is mind blowing to me! I feel as if I don't have enough time for my friends and family as it is, but it seems as if it is only gonna get worse. The person that has pushed me this far to go to school has been Ben, he always is there to support me and encourage me. Even when I complain about how much I hate something he reminds me that it is life and it's something that I have to do. He is such a hard worker and I rarely hear him complain about anything. He is a great guy and I don't know what I'd do without him."

"event","Ok so I was sleeping hard core and my cell phone rings, so I answer it and it was Ben. He said that he was going to stop by and bring me my birthday presents. So I got up and watched tv and waited for him. So when he got here I open the door for him and he hands me a mini tourch (ya know the kind you burn creme brulee off with). Which is an awesome present for someone who cooks, and I was excited about that :). But then from behind his back he brings out a dozen pink roses in a vase with a soft furry teddy bear around it, I just wanted to fall over and faint. That's what I have always wanted, and never expected to get. I didn't know what to do, I couldn't cry because I was too overwhelmed with joy..so I just smiled so big that I thought I was going to explode. I am still in shock that I finally got what I really wanted and he didn't even know that I ever wanted that! OH this is the bestest day ever! Thanks Ben you made my day and made me the happiest girl on earth ever!"

"event","My birthday was yesterday...I had to go to a baby shower, but it was fun, and I saw my buddy RIM JOB! Then I went to work but they let me go home early so that was cool. So I went to Jade's birthday party and became very sleepy and so I came home and Whitney and Toni stayed the night so we could leave early this morning. Candace came out last night to give me my birthday present, it was something cool I could add to my collection. Then this morning we left for Cedar Point at 6 am...and hung out there until 3 or 4 and on the way home I let Whitney drive my baby but I nearly died from all the stress so I made her pull over and let me drive even though I was so sleepy but not so very sleepy to let her drive. Now I am going to lay down and get a ton of sleep but it's not gonna be very comfy because I am very sunburnt! Then later when my hunny Ben calls me I might go over there...I miss him!"

I think he has been working late and is just too sleepy to call...At least that's what I hope it is. In about 5 more hours I will be 19, yeah whooo hooo! I am not looking forward to tomorrow...I have to go to work! BLAH! I wish there was something to do tonight, but the night is young...Even though there isn't much to do, damn it I will try and find something."

"event","Today I have been thinking about stuff...all sorts of stuff! I don't know why I let myself think that things are going to go perfect when I know that they aren't going to. It's like I have all these great ideas and concepts in my head that would be so wonderful if it actually happened. But then as things get closer I realize not much in life is going to be perfect, so why do I let myself even think it!?! Like for instance my birthday...for some reason I have always wanted someone to throw me a suprise birtday party, like complete suprise. That would be so awesome I think that I would cry....I feel bad writing that because it sounds so greedy! But this year I am happy with going to Cedar Point with my friends. : ) Then I have finally realized that I am a stubborn as can be...I never listen to anyone's advice. I know who I am, I kinda know who I'll be and therefore I don't like listening to people. Really the only way that I learn is from my mistakes. Nobody else can tell me that I shouldn't do something because then I want to do it even more. Oh shoot I hate days like this where I just think about things..somethings I don't want to tell anyone but I don't want to hurt anyone's feelings. Ok well that's enough sharing with the world...I gotta clean my room and go to work...laters"

"event","Today I got home around 7:30a.m. from Ben's house. I greeted my parents as they were getting ready to go to work with a smiling good morning. Then I fell asleep for 15 minutes on the couch until Gina made me drive her to her job. After that I came home and slept until 3:45 p.m. but I wanted to sleep even more, but I had to get stuff done. So I went and picked up Whitney and we went to Angie's. I took Jade to do some chores and I got him a birthday present and got my cousin Morgan's baby Hannah some things. Then we took Jade back to Angie's and he peed all over the floor it was the funniest thing ever. Then I took Whitney to DQ. Now she is staying the night and whatnot...I do belive it is almost bed time...I am sleepy, I could sleep all day every day."

My mother always says that God must have some great purpose in mind for me, because (s)He (my mother would never go with 'she' but I'm more open-minded) has prevented me from dying a few times.

Apparently as a little baby I nearly crawled out a second-story window of a building when a family friend picked me up and stopped me.   A beautiful woman, I am still friends with her to this very day, forty-odd years later.

As a pre-teen child while holidaying in Tasmania, we were swimming in a creek that had a fast current out further.   My father told us not to go there as it was too fast, and of course I didn't listen.   I remember trying to hold rocks below me and they just giving way and pulling up as I grasped them to get some stability.   Eventually one of the young men who were frolicking about in the current earlier (that made me want to swim out there) grabbed a hold of me and pulled me to the shore.   I think the river lowered its level that day as I swallowed so much of it.

In my twenties I took up skydiving and would work all week to go to the drop-zone on the weekend and spend my pay buying one-way tickets to height.   One day, while doing a demonstration jump for students (of which one was my brother), I lost consiousness shorty after pulling my parachute.   I was heading downwind at the time and the estimates are that I hit the ground limp with a forward speed of 60-70 km per hour.   I do not remember anything of the next few days, but I survived that one too.

Finally...near-death?   Maybe not quite as close as others, but while visiting, and staying with the family of an online friend in Beaumont, Texas in 2000, her husband (who, incidentally, had had his wife, my friend, sleeping on the sofa for the previous 18 months or so) got it into his head that I was ""doing"" his wife and we were having a grand old time.   It wasn't so (though I wish it was), but he was motivated enough to get his gun out before his wife told him to stop being stupid and not make a mistake.   Needless to say, she and her son dropped me at the local bus station at 2am the next morning to catch the 3.15 bus out of Beaumont...

So, does God really have some special purpose for me in mind, or have I just been insanely lucky?   I do not know either way, but it will never stop me from doing my best to always <i>live</I> life."

When a band you have liked since the early days makes it big, one should be happy for them and all the hard work they've put in, and also that more people have started to recognise how good they are.   The main problem for me is that I feel like my interest in them is kind of devalued if everyone else now likes them also, like my precious little secret now has to be shared with so many more people.

This has happened with a few bands/artists I've known of in my younger years.   I wish I could just be happy for them without the empty feeling of selfishness that overcomes me..."

On Saturday I entered a committed relationship with a 4-month-old Rottweiler pup!

I've loved Rotties ever since spending time with my cousin in the States in 2000, as he had three of them!   I've wanted one ever since.   And now the lovely Tom and I are sharing each other's lives indefinitely.

Tom was named after two of my 'heroes' (not that I really have heroes, but these are people I honour greatly), singer/songwriter extraordinaire Tom Waits, and legendary cricketer and primary contributor to the 'invention' of Australian Rules football Tom Wills (google them if you do not know).   

Yesterday I was considering what his full name would be, and I laughingly came up with Tom Will Wait (definitely something this little energetic puppy does not much of at the moment).

No photos as yet, but I hope to take some real soon, otherwise he will be a lot bigger."

"event","<span style=""font-size: large"">Hi everyone.

My head and arse are both very sore from kicking and slapping myself about not posting more often here.  Yeah yeah, I know, you've heard it all before...

I've found a spare ten minutes or so to jot down an update on what is happening.

Currently I am the holder of four (yes 4!) casual jobs, and my juggling skills are rapidly improving with each passing day.

Since March or April I've been working one or two days a week at a piggery just 40km out of town. It is dirty work, but I actually like to get working and be able to lose my mind from everything else happening.

I'm also at the Discovery Science and Technology Centre in Bendigo, which is also a lot of fun, though I do not get as much work as I'd like to there.

Another role is as an underground tour guide at the Central Deborah tourist gold mine in the centre of town.  This is probably my favourite at the moment, and where I'm getting the most work currently, however I couldn't solely survive on it alone, as it is not enough.

And lastly, I begin a new job this Saturday, working as a carer for an intellectually disabled man through an organisation called Loddon Mallee Housing Services.  It's been a while since I've done work like this, but the opportunity arose and was too good to pass up.  And for a start it will only be Saturday work, so it will not get in the way of other jobs much.

I truly hope you are all well - I was motivated to post this because I was cleaning out my email inbox when I came across a couple of LJ friends' emails to me, and slapped myself up the head again!

Keep happy.

Your eternally unreliable, and regularly absent Brendan.</span>"

I feel fortunate though, as my life is a stimulating one that is full, and sometimes even rewarding.<br /><br />The latest excitement in my life has been to do with music, which is always wonderful when it affects my life.<br /><div style=""text-align: center""><br /><img border=""10"" width=""300"" height=""450"" alt="""" src=""http://www.gorgeousvoices.org.au/assets/images/gvflogo.png"" /></div><br />Last weekend in Bendigo was the <a href=""http://www.gorgeousvoices.org.au/index.html"">Gorgeous Voices Festival</a>&nbsp;and was amazing.&nbsp;&nbsp; By the time Sunday night came around I was physically exhausted!&nbsp;&nbsp; And that is no exaggeration!<br /><br />Friday night began with an afternoon/evening showcase/welcome of artists who would be around for the weekend, which was a great little taste that went for about two-and-a-bit hours.&nbsp;&nbsp; After that I moseyed on up to the grandstand at the local footy ground, the home of the Bendigo Folk Club, to see a show by one of my favourite songwriters, <a href=""http://www.kavisha.com/"">Kavisha Mazzella</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Before Kavisha was a family band from a town just down the road from Bendigo.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'd never heard them, but their name&nbsp;is <a href=""http://www.makingmusic.com.au/html/Rainmakers%20home.html"">The Rainmakers</a>, and they were a wonderful surprise, that I got to spend an entertaining time listening to.<br /><br />Saturday morning saw my usual start to the weekend of Bendigo Laughter Club, of which I am a facilitator.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This had nothing to do with the festival, but is always a wonderful part of my weekend.&nbsp;&nbsp; From there I went to a couple of hours of choir practice, for my first experience in a choir (apart from as a youngster at church) at the end of the weekend.&nbsp;&nbsp; Saturday in Bendigo was busy with things that weren't just to do with the festival, and there was a children's carnival in the main park, where I was working between 12 and 4, in a tent set up by one of my workplaces, the <a href=""http://www.discovery.asn.au/"">Discovery Science and Technology Centre</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Our tent was called &quot;The Grossology Tent&quot; and we spent the afternoon making fake scabs on kids' bodies, slimy snot that they could take home and play with, and my main job was teaching the kids about what is in poo and then making some fake poo out of a host of yummy ingrdients so that they could EAT&nbsp;IT!&nbsp;&nbsp; A few kids (and parents) weren't interested in the poo, but I had to go to the supermarket at one stage to get extra supplies!&nbsp;&nbsp; Yummy poo...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Between three and seven there was an open mike at the grandstand, and I had my guitar in the car and went on up and heard some great music, as well as played three songs, which all went well.&nbsp;&nbsp; Quick drive home for dinner and then out to a premiere of a &quot;folk-rock-opera&quot; that was written by a local.&nbsp;&nbsp; The music was more beautiful than I can describe, but it finished earlier than I expected, at about 9:15pm.&nbsp;&nbsp; Back over to the grandstand to hear someone I'd never heard of before named <a href=""http://www.jojosmithsoul.com/index.htm"">Jo Jo Smith</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; At the end of the night my jaw was sore due to its constnt state of being gawkingly hanging open.&nbsp;&nbsp; An older woman, Jo Jo played a nylon-string guitar like a maestro, and sung with a gusto and passion that made me totally envious.&nbsp;&nbsp; And her voice was beautiful.&nbsp;&nbsp; Check her website at the link...there're some good songs you can hear.<br /><br />Sunday morning was another two hours of choir practice.&nbsp;&nbsp; I could've done some workshops before the finale concert but I needed some lunch and wanted to organise some 'cheat notes' for songs I didn't know by heart.&nbsp;&nbsp; The finale was at the Catholic Sacred Heart Cathedral, a massive behemoth of intricate architecture that, even though it was a fine day, was pretty chily inside of.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'd battled most of the weekend with a runny-nosed cold, and after we finished singing and I sat down to watch the end of the concert, I couldn't stop shivering.&nbsp;&nbsp; Reluctantly, I left when the last act started, because I was feeling the agony.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm sure it was also from exhaustion too.&nbsp;&nbsp; When I got back to my car, parked facing the lowering afternoon sun, it was so heated inside that I simply put some music on (the CD of Jo Jo I'd bought the night before) and put the seat back to recover from my cold.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was about 4.20pm then and when I opened my eyes again it was 5.30, so maybe I was tired...<br /><br />What a beautiful joy-giving weekend with a host of marvellous, talented, and personally edifying people to share time with.&nbsp;&nbsp; I encourage you to have a look at all of the links I've put in this post, as you may just find some great additions to your life.<br /><br />Much love to you all.<br /><br /></span></span><br />"

"event","Hi everyone.

Yesterday we travelled from Berry Springs to Katherine, and it was a great drive, the absolute highlight being a visit to Edith Falls (google it and tell me what you think).

We're only in Katherine for one night, and today we are doing a Katherine Gorge river cruise before driving back up to Kakadu National Park.&nbsp;&nbsp; While there internet access will be very little if any at all.&nbsp;&nbsp; We'll be home on Friday, so I'll post anything then that I wish to, including more photos.

Speaking of photos, as I'm not a pro member at Flickr, I ran out of space for photos, so have reverted to my old Photobucket.com account.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm not sure how you can go about it, but if you go to photobucket and do a search for brendanobrien (all one word) hopefully it will show you my pages and you can find the latest photos.&nbsp;&nbsp; Otherwise you'll just have to wait until I get home and update.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sorry, but it can't be helped.

until next time..."

We've been looking around and exploring plenty of places with many highlights.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: small"">Yesterday we spent the day looking around the Litchfield National Park, which was wonderful for me, as my love of nature and hiking and such is quite all-encompassing of myself. Think about this: at the top end of Australia there is constant public announcement and warning signs about the presence of crocodiles in waterways. Indeed, nobody (except idiots and tourists who don't know better) swim at the beaches, because there are freshwater and saltwater crocodiles all around. Yesterday at Litchfield we visited two waterfalls and a set of rockholes that anybody could swim at. I don't know why, but there are no crocs around (actually, one of the falls - Wangi Falls - had a sign saying there were freshwater crocs local that were only dangerous if annoyed, but otherwise they fed on insects and plant life), and the water was crystal clear. No jokes, you could see right to the bottom of any areas that were 6 foot or so deep! And my favourite was Florence falls, where you could sit in the water and all around you were beautiful black fish swimming, some big enough to be a meal for two people if they were edible and you could catch them (I do not know if either is applicable or allowed), and with my goggles on it was amazing to swim amongst them.<br /></span></p><p style=""text-align: center""><span style=""font-size: small""><img height=""450"" width=""338"" align=""middle"" alt="""" src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2444/3676877439_6202fc45a5.jpg"" /></span></p><p><span style=""font-size: small"">We also spent a day at the Territory Wildlife Park, which was a full day's experience and was wonderfully amazing. They had all sorts of different animals there, as well as different habitats and mini-forests to walk through. I may even go back there again before we leave...<br /></span></p><p style=""text-align: center""><span style=""font-size: small""><img height=""300"" width=""400"" alt="""" src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3661/3673541434_7da88dfd65.jpg?v=0"" />&nbsp;&nbsp; <img height=""300"" width=""225"" alt="""" src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3401/3673530096_0ccc1ebd7f.jpg?v=0"" /></span></p><p><span style=""font-size: small"">These two places have been my highlights, but there've been so many so far that it is too difficult to pick an absolute. Crocosaurus Cove was another ripper. And, not at Crocosaurus Cove, but we got to buy croc fillets to cook and I ate croc meat for the first time ever! It's a white meat and tastes very much like pork. Very nice, and no fat to speak of.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: small"">If you'd like to peruse through any of my other photos, I'm uploading them to my Flickr site at <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/brendanooo"">http://www.flickr.com/photos/brendanooo</a>&nbsp;and there'll be more to come!</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: small"">Until next time, stay happy!</span></p></font>"

"event","...just the same as always, it has been a long time between drinks, indeed it has.<br /><br />Tonight, on my second-last night off before getting back to work for another 9 or 10 straight 12-hour days, I watched a wonderful movie that I'd never even heard of before.&nbsp;&nbsp; Given to me by a friend of mine, it is called <strong><em>The Man From Earth</em></strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp; After going to imdb.com I saw it was made last year and actually has quite a high rating, meaning people who can bother putting a vote in think well of it.<br /><br />No spoilers, but it is about a man who has apparently been living for 14,000 (yes fourteen <em>thousand</em>) years, who decides to share it with some good and learned friends.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was engrossed from the start of the movie right through until the end.&nbsp;&nbsp; This was a really good way to spend some 90-or-so minutes tonight.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />p.s.&nbsp;&nbsp; to all of my mates on here, I'm sincerely apologetic for not keeping up with your LJs and/or posting comments, as I know you know I enjoy doing.&nbsp;&nbsp; life really is getting in the way in recent times..."

"event","It is with regret that I announce, only 3 portraits in to the 52 planned for this year, that the project is no more. <br /><br />The reason for this is that my wife feels as though I have minimised the importance of my family in my life by not including her or either of my two sons in the first three weeks. As an artist, the last thing I wanted was for my project to come across as a family photo album, and I had planned to include all three of them at some stage in the process, but I obviously made the wrong choice by not making them weeks 2-4 (there <i>is</i> sarcasm in that statement in case you couldn't read it). <br /><br />Music takes a far higher place in my life than just about anything, to the extent that I'm currently deciding on my first tattoo ever to reflect that. Anyone who has had any ""musical"" interraction with me knows that my preference is for lyrical music, or ""storytelling"" songs. Over the years, having listened to many singer-songwriters plying their craft, often extremely beautifully, via tunes about women (or men) other than their partners, I often wondered if their spouses ever had issues. Nick Cave for example, is somewhat ""notorious"" for this, but surely his songwriting and musical talent in expressing his art would ""negate"" (bad word, but I cannot grasp the right one at the moment) any insecure feelings his partner may have. I mean, it is what he does as his passion. And to be fair, that should read <b>passion</b>, <i>passion</i>, or PASSION in order to place correct emphasis on it. <br /><br />Some artists, writers, musicians discipline themselves so rigorously to nurture, develop, and extend their passion, spending a certain amount of hours each day just for what they are passionate about. In a perfect world, that would be what any people with artistic inclinations would be able to do. However, some of us have to work and lead ""outside"" lives as well, disabling the possibility of a Utopian existence in our artistic lives. <br /><br />The reason for the above paragraph's observation is that without the above discipline, any other artistically-leaning persons often need to rely on ""inspiration"", and to be quite blunt about it, this&nbsp;<i><strong><u>FUCKING SUCKS</u></strong></i>&nbsp;(note the appropriate emphasis on that to portray how important I mean it), because one so wants to keep creating and cannot do it because everything else gets in the way. <br /><br />So I set projects to enable me to have parameters to aim for so that my artistic muse will not feel neglected, as it has for the last year or so. And I do not really need other shit that I cannot see coming getting in the way of it. <br /><br />I know I think differently from many people on many issues, but am I alone in thinking that the woman I profess my love for <b>daily</b> (appropriate emphasis again), that I've been married to for 5 years, who's two sons I have taken on as my own (with it's own major set of complications <i>not</i> going to be mentioned here), is letting her insecurities get in the way where they shouldn't??? <br /><br />Just to put it on the record, I can understand how she may feel this way, but I do not give it credence because if it were a bucket it wouldn't have a bottom and therefore would not hold a drop of water. Am I being heartless, uncaring, irresponsible? Or give me any other word that comes to your mind (from the sound of that last sentence, ""arrogant"" may well fit in there too, but I think it is just anger at the moment), because I'll value feedback on this one, and welcome you to be as brutal as you feel you need to be, because if I am seriously missing something here, maybe I need to know about it. <br /><br />Regardless, this project has provided more grief than I foresaw, so it is still going to die it's premature death. Now I feel I owe it to my marriage.&nbsp;<br /><br />Sorry,&nbsp;If you were looking forward to it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was.<br /><br />'Til next time..."

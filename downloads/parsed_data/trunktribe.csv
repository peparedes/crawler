"event","Ok so ive been back in austin since sunday and yeah ITs going good.. My 2 classes rule. I love them so much.. I just completed my first week and tonight I met Sarah... I had a lot of fun and my Hot chocolate was very good. I hope she had fun.. we didn't have all the time in the world but maybe she will want to hang out again.:) I'm just worried because of what happened with the last girl I met... Not reasons on her behalf.. just maybe something is wrong with me and I don't see it.. well till later...

"event","Gosh This Year has started out so nice... Certain things and people have just made it nice. Ive goten back in to my woodworking stuff a little which is sweet. I also have played my guitar so much more. I miss Austin In my own Little ways but im still enjoying Being Home... My apt is so prefabricated it just wont ever seem to be my own little dwelling.. But its nice. I seem to have My own dressing room of sorts unless they move somone into that extra room with out my knowledge and if thats the case i may get kicked out... but who needs them.... lol.... As we speak I miss my CKY dvds and my tummy is happy. I also am working on another guitar thta ive had for a few years but never had an idea for till now. I know im neglecting my site but i have what you call designers block. I want everyone who reads this to check out this band. (which is maybe one person. www.musictx.com/serene very good frinds with a killer sound... I wish them the best. anyways today was good.... I had pizza with my mom. and I slept way to late as usual. Im off for now... Speaking with danny of serene they play at 3 yay... bye bye...."

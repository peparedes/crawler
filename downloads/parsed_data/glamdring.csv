"event","Sometimes I dream of the future, or perhaps dream that I am. When you look at prophecy however, it seems to demand madness either way - I'm not sure the distinction matters. The murky vortex that looms before me is a hollowing beast, slowly consuming my soul through the cracks in my fragile human armor. I constantly find myself questioning the truth of this - an overactive imagination or dire warning subdued by the common perspective of reality? Then I find myself questioning truth itself, does this exist or is it just a security blanket humans hide beneath? When I was young, my father urged me to question everything. I'm sure he meant it in a sense of people and their motives, a gentle caution to the cruel world I would one day be left in without his guidance. Perhaps I took it too literally, propelled by the haunting sense that there is something fundamentally wrong with the world around me - but what price will I pay for the alternative? Are my demons in me or are just clever enough to be so convincing?"

"event","i was waiting for a bus with a plant, a painting and a bike while sitting on a couch. the bus came but left before i could collect my things, with a man on the back looking out the window and ranting about ""no more plants"". is that how it began?

cars were driving through crowds of people.
somebody tried to steal my wallet and i caught them, they got away with my keys but gave them back at the last second - the girl with him had stolen a hat which she returned to somebody else.

there was a window (that belonged to a family that could turn into different breeds of dogs) that i kept crawling in and out of, on a mission that involved somebody in a hospital - an older woman who was pregnant and the doctors didnt know. the person i was on the mission with knew and was frantic about saving her.

i offered the doctor a date if she would humor us, a little girl became upset because i had already promised her - she tried to be a waitress at the what was now a restaurant but couldnt get the order right - i smiled (pleading understanding) at the people ordering food and guided her away with a gentle hand on her shoulder.

i was at this party and i went into what i thought was a bathroom it turned out to be somebodies bedroom, i heard somebody mumbling from within that sounded distressed (groaning and arguing something about ""i don't know how to explain that!"") so i went to the corner of the wall that hid them from view and asked ""are you ok?"" a voice answered back ""i dont know, where are you?"" i stuck my hand around the corner and waved, giving a moments pause before following with my head.
a girl was laying there who had been having an argument with somebody who wasnt in the room, i took her for insane at first. as soon as i came into the room she smiled at me and asked me to wiggle my ears; so i sat next to her and did just that. she took the large bouncy ball which i was holding in my hand that suddenly appeared to be wrapped in foil with a dip in one side and smiled at me and said ""you got on the wrong train - it must be a good omen"" - it seemed to make so much sense, is she still insane or am i?"

perhaps i am what always was,
the truth invading as if a flood,
lines blurring, power announced,
even if this is delusion it doesnt matter now.
faith crumbles, collapsing in this,
even if i knew the healing, could i summon it?
does the initial madness hold sway to truth?
for instance if i find the wellspring, who could i give it to?
sometimes insane, moreso anyway,
mostly enraged that i cannot be today.
whispers ring true, madness ensues,
only stop to consider what this does to you.
society is the cage, cant release my rage,
cannot find a thread of its lost source today.
writing is useless, wish it didnt come down to this.
the confusion and blunders that persist in a world that seeks no tolerance.
do what you want to, discard what you've come to,
scarred and uncomfortable for the lies that you've become too.
so much fake,
muttering in disgrace to a world that cant begin to see a trace of my displace.
held apart by what i need, which even i no longer see,
lost this creature whatever it used to be.
wish i could hide this, tired of the lies that exist when i cant find what fits.
chasing the fog, lost from it all,
sometimes it is only the boy who gives me the strength to hold on.

"event","deep inside there is the call, for me to let down all these walls
let what is meant to be, become the truth for all to see
i will tell it all to you, the truth that these bafoons refuse
please listen to me this final time
the clock has run out and it is here, the truth that you've all become to fear
your clothes dont matter nor does your car
the credit cards are none by far
popularity is just dispairity bourne upon the blackness that eats you away
and throws you far
i know you wont listen to me, for this is not meant to be
i am a quiet voice drowned in the past and this is now the truth at last
no savior will come to you nobody will do this for you
you need to rise up for yourself, and kill the things that haunt the self
only you can do this task, this is the only thing that will make your soul last
and so i have spoken my final task
warrior of energy, lord of the past, listen to me to suffer your own mask"

"event","it seems to be i never have the time. to write on lj, to draw, to fly a kite  with my sweetie... what do i do instead? i sleep, i cook at home, i clean up, i do laundry with my baby, i work at jo's, i drink after work, i go to lovejoy's and drink more, i go home and pass out next to my boyfriend... sometimes my baby meets me at work to walk me home and we don't drink, that's good. we took a long walk together before i went to work yesterday, down by town lake and lost ourselves in critter-watchin. but i wasn't able to fully enjoy myself, stressed about bein to work on time, but i was fine.
 
my left ankle hurts and my heel too, every day. i wear an ace brace to support my ankle, and i wear good shoes at work, i wish it would stop. my left knee hurts sometimes(i injured it in 2001, 25 stitches!) and my wrists get sore, my shoulders hold all my tension in knots. i love workin in a kitchen, but it's tearin me up! i find new bruises all the time and i cut myself occasionally, nicks mostly. 

i feel like i can't work a cookin job and also be able to do caricatures, and that's why i've been in such a broke-ass state since i left vegas, where i used to draw funny pictures of people for a fuckin living! i'm so tired of bein broke! oh well, at least my boyfriend's pitchin in and my roomate got a job finally. maybe i can relax a little?"

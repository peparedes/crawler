"event","So I've decided to write a livejournal entry. I figure no one will read it, because no one really uses this website anymore. Hell, I know I haven't looked at it in a month until today. So I guess I could make this like a real journal entry, given that no one would really read it. Plus, the occasional reader that might, I don't think I'd mind them reading it that much. Basically here it goes.

So summer is fine, but still nothing like I thought it'd be. I thought I'd be working less, and hanging out with people more. Most occasions have been overrated and I've enjoyed the benefits that come with making money. Working at Cebella's is really my first job, and I got extremely lucky with them. They're fun to work with, it's not that hard to do, and hey, I get free pizza. 
Summer's pretty much more than halfway over. So I'm getting really apprehensive about school. I chose my classes. I got my dorm. I just need to register my car and find a job in Mt. Pleasant. I don't think I'll get the regular college experience that most people look forward to. I'm not anticipating partying too much, or even having more than two days a week when I don't have a class or work to do. I have goals, I want to do well. Even if it's not what I picture, there's always the chance that I'm putting way too much pressure on myself. Regardless, I'm still incredibly excited about the new experience, and above the change that I think I need in my life. 
I'm dancing again - summer commitment stuff. I really don't want to do parade. Practices are tomorrow and Friday, and the parade is Saturday morning. Barb and Bebe think I'm doing it. How do I not do it. I do not feel like getting my ass out of bed Saturday to walk down Grandriver for the founder's day of a city I don't even live in. Besides parade, it's Chicago practice, which is next weekend. I'm excited to hang out with cool people, but not so much the convention. I realize something though, I don't get what I use to out of dancing all the time. I'm glad with college that it'll be rare, so maybe I'll appreciate it a bit more. 

Hats off to you if you read this whole thing. 
You're awesome if you comment on it.

I less than three whoever reads this piece of shit."

"event","I fucking swear that these things always happen to me. Whether it be diarrhea related stories or if it involves me blurting out something stupid like ""just be careful because there's a lot of junk in my trunk"" to the Best Buy guy installing my car stereo, it always fucking happens to me. Well, for those of you who tend to like hearing all of my embarrassing stories (*cough* you all know who you are), here's one more for you. 

First day back to school after Spring Break was typical, and I thought it irregularly okay. But as Gina's sister, Jill and I were approaching my car to drive home, I realized my key was burried in my purse. So I set all of my books on top of my car momentarily. Well I wish I had a math book or something  on top of my books. If you recall the severe wind today? You do the math. 

I don't use folders...well I seldomly use folders. Most of my homework (including 30 poems I've written for my creative writing project) was in my notebook, just neatly filed sort of. But the wind picked up instantly. All of my papers, and I mean literally ALL of my papers, from six classes, from an entire card marking, exploded out of my notebook and into the wind. If ice bergs were made of paper and a ship hit it, it would look like all of my papers blowing away. 

They went everywhere. And I mean everywhere. Some blew on the roof, and I'll never get them back, I hope they weren't important. But over the span of the entire SHS parking lot, I had to run after dozens upon dozens of papers. I didn't catch them all, some went across the street, the wind had blown them away so quickly. 

Do you know what Groucho Marx looked like when he walked into a room, sort of a low and quick awkward walk, well that's how I was basically running/walking. I had to crouch low to the ground to scoop up scurrying papers and fast enough to cathch them in the wind. I looked overall ridiculous. People were laughing. Accouple people stopped to help. One kid chased me from the back of the parking lot to almost six mile just to give me a hand full of papers he had caught. But the people who laughed and did nothing, just pissed me off. 

I couldn't imagine losing all of that work. My poetry project drafts...most are gone. I was so angry I didn't know who to take it out on. I couldn't blame the wind...it's inanimate. I couldn't yell at the whoever was helping me, so I bitched at the side remarks. I got the ""haha oh man that sucks!"" 
My response: ""State the obvious, but don't help, thanks ass hole.""
""You know your papers are over the entire parking lot...right?""
My response: ""Why do you think I'm after them!?""

Ah...I was so mad and embarrassed after running around bitching and looking like a complete moron, I just left a crumbled up pile of papers in my back seat. Thanks Megan, Gina, Jill, and anonymous kid for helping."

I've gotten my Uncle Steve like twice. But this year I got my sister Adrienne. So, it'll be an easy holiday season. <br /><br />Then I'm just excited because of the four day weekend that still remains. Also because I got in to Central Michigan University. So far it's Central and Western. I don't I'll back from State anytime soon because I waited too long to apply, basically only did to appease my mom, I have no strong desire to go there because their journalism program isn't that great. I also applied to Wayne State, but again, same as State. <br /><br /><strong><u>So the question is: </u></strong><em>WMU or CMU?</em></p>"

"event","Hi, how are you doing? 
I am in that mood. Oooh one of those really good moods. And I am actually anxious to go to school tomorrow, which is new. Pantomime results are posted in the morning - and I'm not really anxious for much else. We've all just like worked everysingle day from last monday through now....and I think we generally did alright. Time Warp and&nbsp; Banana Phone were fun today at audtioins. Time Warp was hot just because everyone was in full out esemble. Banana Phone was hot because I was a fucking Banana....actually the costume looks like a nipple/ yellow kkk member, but it was still immensely hot.&nbsp; 
After audtions today - went to Taco Bell...I am sad I don't get to hang out with Alex and Sam more....anyway -went straight to dance after. There was a chick from the Free Press taking pictures. I'm probably in none of them knowing my luck. 
I finally got to go home since this morning at like 745, but then had to go back to dance. Jazz as hot, we're doing our dance to...haha ""Shakacon"" I don't think that's how you spell it - but it's so funny and the song makes me happy. Ballet was a blow off too. Bebe let O. Dobbs and myself scamper off to Farmer Jack's at Nine and Farmington for a cake...for our dance Thanksgiving celebration...it was fantastic! We all went around and said what we were thankful for...I was of course thankful for the Mayans for developing chocolate,&nbsp; for with out them, we may not have had such a splendid cake.&nbsp; 

Reminders: 
Dec 2 (3pm) and Dec 3 (1pm) CHRISTMAS FESTIVAL I""M IN.&nbsp; 

Pantomime Show Nov 29, 30, Dec 1 

COME!

Quotes from which I have found sufficient amusement the past two days.
New girl in Freaks and Geeks: ""OH MY GOD, Bill, your rocket's so huge!""

Dobbs Twins today in regards to a stupid girl: ""She didn't know England was an island!"" - ""She didn't know Napoleon was french!"""

Man, do I ponder the weirdest things at 3am, when I have nothing better do to.&nbsp;

Briefly helped Megan make a plane for our Snake on a Plane Pantomime...it just needs a back and a wing.&nbsp;
I kind of want this entire....uh week to be over, just I can think about something else, besides fucking Pantomime. I haven't had a head ache that throbbed this much since I had Optic-neuritis.&nbsp;

And I kind of feel like the stuff I continue to make up for Pantomime is getting exponentially worse as we practice. Ugh. I'll just be pissed if Time Warp gets the boot.&nbsp;

And yeah there's some other stuff I guess, but I dont' feel like typing, I'm only doing this because I'm bored out of my fucking mind.

I felt bad yesterday having people stay till like five at school, but it was tight because Van Horn opened the auditorium for us to practice in. For the Pantomime show, auditions are next week. Snakes on a Plane (Bring It) and Ghostbusters' auditions are on Tuesday...which really only gives us only tomorrow, the weekend and monday to put it together including massive props (like Ghostbusting packs and cardboard planes) . THose won't be hard to come up with stuff to do for, but the props are hard to come by. Time Warp and Banana Phone are comign alright. I have some choreography that's not too difficult to comprehend. For Time Warp I have mostly formation changes and ripples that look cool from the audience, or at least it will if we get everyone together and if we actually make the show. I hope Time Warp makes it - when there's other groups doing the same one....I hope my costume shiz and choreography and working on it everyday helps, and hopefully everyone is practicing.

She talked about it's inconsistancy and it's poor writing and that the subject for the opinion page wasn't very timely. So she ended asking me to write a follow up opinion piece on the elections. And it seemed like she sort of wanted it to be on the voter turn out. Ugh. I don't care, I much rather write about the Dems taken over congress again and my new hero Nancy Pelosi, but I want to be on her good side....so i'll do...more work....but ti does mean I get two major article bylines in addtion to the responsibility of editing the layout for the front page.

I got up at 130am to do homework and such...after having fell asleep at 830...when I skipped some of dance again. yep. I was wide awake by 730 this morning. And much of school was surprisingly a good time.&nbsp;

Bledell finally gave me a complement today in saying I write good reviews

Foster said I was a funny kid, which made my fourth hour because he was teasing me saying he wouldn't let me turn in my late work today because I only had one less day than everyone else, but he let me and it was just funny oh Rod Foster. Haha.

Lunch I spent writing a poem out my diarrhea experiences...it's actually bad and it rhymes horribly (haha ohoe sort of helped) and I couldn't keep a straight face I as wrote that crappy thing...but the story that we had to write for part of this assignment is good because I worked really hard on it....diarrhea is so awkward to desribe in print I've come to find out.

Pantomime show meeting today...so far we're doing the TIme Warp and Banana Phone for sure....maybe Video Killed the Radio Store...or some other 80's classic. P Sho 06 I'm excited. I'm going to be Columbia in Time Warp and choreographing everything for our group.

COME TO THE PANTOMIME SHOW!

Oh yeah and don't forget my Christmas Festival performance...I think I gave info in a previous entry....if not ask me if you want to go! Dec 2 and 3!"

Who remembers the diarrhea story when I got out of that ticket for really having it?
Or what about the time I hit that girl with my car?
Or what about the time I collided with a school conselor in the left hand turn lane?
Or when my left back door flew open and all my homework flew into sixmile?
OR how about when I was getting my radio installed in Burt and the guy at Best Buy said he was going to have to go into my trunk to install speakers and I replied ""Just be careful of all the junk in my trunk..."" like an idiot?
OR HOW ABOUT when I almost rearended a car on seven mile because I was sick and dizzy-  and ran Burt up a curb, then took that street the curb was on because I was too embarrassed to back up and keep going?

AND NOW! how about when I got sick during third hour debate class today then in the bathroom for a half hour and the hall monitor came in and practically held my hair back? Yeah that was like a half hour ago.
Hall monitor: ""You can't just sit in the bathroom, either go to class or go home.""
Me: ""I'm not finished yet. I don't wanna' spew again in the hallway!""
Hall monitor: ""OOOh, sorry, again? Well lemme' know when you come out....?""
Etc....
I was going to stay at school becuase I have to finish the last paragraph of a paper and take a math test. But she was waiting for me in the hallway...and escorted me to the attendance office. So I'm at home. I feel like crap still, but hey when do I not feel like crap? 
The worst part was having to go kick the custodial door after I was already in the parking lot to tell them I just spewed on the hood of somebody's car and that it should probably get cleaned up. Felt like huge ass loser.

Paper today I was also excited because I finished my TWO! pages for news and the layout looks amazing. I love having a twelve page paper as oppose to eight, but unfortuately we're converting back to eight next issue, which means only one news page I'll have to edit. It sucks. <br />Debate was sweet too. We watched exerpts from <em>12 Angry Men </em>and <em>To Kill a Mockingbird</em>. I was excited because each of those old movies are among my top thrity or so...and we applied examples from them to Debate logic...good times.<br />Fifth hour was cool today too! As luck would have it. Instead of just discussing Life of Pi like any other boring game - we played a survivor knock off game in groups or ""tribes."" Gina was in my tribe, so was this kid Evan. We were tribe MFC - or tribe ""Monkey Fuckin' a Coconut,"" because of this, Dane Cook was referenced the entire hour. haha. We had two machetes among our resources when we were stranded on our island. We decided we'd give one to an island monkey to battle with him...what a good hour.&nbsp;<br />Sixth hour was funny&nbsp; -&nbsp; because Shoe is always funny.<br /><br />Tonight -Gina, Megan, and I made cookie goody bag type of deals for everyone.

I liked doing it. I made all the fortune cookies...they probably aren't that good actually because I'm still practicing with the fortune cookie making process. It's really hard to let it chill on the burner long enough without it getting too stiff...and hard to make it thin enough to hold a fold and thick enough not to break when creased.

"event","So in our top story tonight, I can't sleep; and in other news, I decide to not practice for my debate. It's like twelve thirty and I have to get up in like four and a half hours for a shower but I don't care.&nbsp; Maybe I have insomnia like in Fight Club and I'll have to go to support group meetings and have myself a good cry in order to fall asleep. Ha I only say that with an Edward Norton reference because I just watched a movie starring him and Ben Stiller. It was actually kind of a good movie ""Keeping the Faith"" that Edward Norton directed by the by. Idk random.
But yeah, can't sleep, got a lot of things on the brain. A exordinant portioin of this week has revolved around frustration so maybe I'll spout about that.
First it bothers me that two AP English kids just got to be on the newspaper staff this year because they're AP English without even having to take the required journalism class first. Bledell's reasoning was that AP kids were good workers and they meet all deadlines....yeah so do people who work really hard for you like me! The AP kids on the Spotlight are over achievers and it drives me up a wall. This one kid, Stephen was supposed to do a point counter point, but the idea was he had for it was shot down by Bledell and so he took two main articles since he's not an editor...the foreign exchange article and the new club article. So I took his point counter point with another girl, and we're doing a governor prelim. I'm for Granholm and she defends Devos' outsourcing and lack of experience basically. This kid came in that same day and had BOTH SIDES of a point counter point written out...plus questionaires for interviews in his articles....he also took a positioin of a copy editor (WHICH ISN""T A REAL EDITOR JOB!!) All a sectioin (like myself) has to do is take one major article which I did - but this kid makes me look so bad....so I took a word search and the principal's corner article...in addtioin to writting a kickass editorial for Granholm. Overall I worked really hard, and Bledell told me that my copy was really good but to add less for Granholm and more attackign Devos...so I did and it was kickass again. Then she said I had to cut it down because I was way over line count even after she told that I didn't have to worry about that. It turns out the only reason I had to cut out some valid points is because my opponent in the point counter point piece is an unachieving miscrient, and couldn't come up with anything comparable enough to say about Devos. So I was PISSED when I had to disformulate my WORK OF ART and rearrange and cut stuff out. I just feel like even though I'm taking on a ton to show up the AP kid(s), my work STILL is underappreciated by advisor, who's job is to ADVISE! Oh yeah, I forgot to say that I ALSO JOINED THE EDITORIAL BOARD TO HAVE EVEN MORE RESPONSIBILITY.
Debate man...I love debate. I chose a topic this time that I'm amazing at debating....(About taking the phrase 'Under God' out of the Pledge of Allegiance) It was funny because this arrogant buttface kid called me a communist for taking the side the Affirmative in taking it out...but it really is the easier side to debate...and I really have no firm position on the subject...but after all my research (A LOT trust me). The partner I got this time is aware enough I guess to debate the subject. But just in case, I wrote his part of the argument too with facts and quotes just to be sure work was being done...so I sort of did way more than I need to. I know I'll ace with debate like the last one - but I'm not losign last time because my partner can't try to make an effort.
If you haven't seen the theme...I'm trying really hard in school, more than I usually do...I have all A's for the progress report to my knowledge...EXCEPT math because of ONE FUCKING TEST! here's how it went down.....I forgot to do the questions on the last page because I was tired and a dbag that day and ended up with a C for the test...ugh...with brought me down to a B in the class for progress reports....honestly I wanted the straight A thing so my parents could have SOMETHING to be proud of because I didn't get that damn job&nbsp; - I keep copping out of dance and I'm not exactly helpful around the house...so yeah
But I guess I work so hard at it for my mom yesterday emphasized my reasons more - my dad is proud of me, but my mom I'm not always sure.
My dad: ""I'm proud of you, you know that? You've been working so hard.""
*me grinning like an idiot because I did something right*
My dad: ""Mom, aren't proud of this girl?"" &lt;---retorical of course
My mom: ""I guess she works hard....""
Me: ""Way to intentionally dodge the question....ugh""

haha i think it's kind of funny because she was pissed I took dad's side in a fight they had - I usually don't take sides but my mom was being ridiculous. She threw a fit at my dad because she didn't get the vcr to record her show...and then she was mad when my dad reacted angerly to the petulant tirade.&nbsp;

I had to work with my debate partner at my house <em>briefly</em>, and then precede to drive her to Laurel Park for an eyebrow waxing appointment. Then I was procrastinating from doing my other homework and decided to go on my old screenname to see if anyone from that buddy list was still ON. Turns out this girl I knew from Interlochem, Renee, was on. I was actually really excited to talk to her, but the IM was brief because she broke news to me that was actually really shocking.<span style=""FONT-SIZE: 10pt""><font face=""Times New Roman""><strong><br /></strong><br /><br />I burried myself in my debate work that night. I prepared for my opening speach...and figured what I might say for rebuttle.<br />Then the next day in 3rd hour, my partner was only prepared with what I had already written down for her, and it unfortunately felt like I had done all the work. When it was her turn to speak...she hardly did. And I know we lost the debate. I guess I can't really blame it on her, because I wasn't really in a fantastic mood yesterday, but I hate losing at things I know I'm good at...like debates.<br />Then today after school, was my first day of orientation at Boston Market. I got into my car at like 345 trying to be a bit early for work to make a good impresion. But Burt, the sonofabitch, wouldn't start, the battery was dead. Fuck. I called almost everyone I knew who would be available to drive me there.&nbsp; But in the end I was fifteen-twenty minutes late. And because of that, I couldn't even go through orientation. I was pissed. Sine the first thing he said when he came out was ""I'm gonna' have to let you go"" I argued with him...of course. I figured if I'm not getting it anyway, I may as well substanitally defend myself. However unsuccessful, I'm glad I did. Then I continued home, after acquring a ride home,&nbsp;I destroyed the uniform they didn't ask back...I felt a lot better after. </font></span>"

Actually I only say that because of the embarrassing and painful experience that I endured biking to dance one day on megan's mom's bike. I fell like five hundred times that one time. But I took my dad's really nice bike actually to the gas station yesterday to quickly get the tires filled. I then rode my bike the three miles to dance (this was in addition to the couple of miles I ran and the GI Jane situps I did at the park), and preseated in dancing for two hours. I would've bike home, but my mom game and drove me because she said it was too dangerous to do so in the dark by myself.&nbsp;
Then today after it stopped raining, I biked a lot more. I took eight a couple of miles west. I started heading for Haggerty on eight mile, but the sidewalk ends after Newburgh, so I turned around and went back east past the golf course at newburgh and eight. I went south on farmington till five mile, then went east till middlebelt. Then I went the two and a half miles at home.&nbsp;
I think I did it, just to prove to myself I could. Because I felt like a chubbo yesterday after I ate like an entire bag of cheetos. Haha so I just biked for like almost two straight hours. I really started to slow down though towards the end today, because I drake all of my water before I got to Newburgh.&nbsp;

First hour, Newman's sociology class is in a nutshell, a waste of my life. I totally should've taken TGab's economic class...just to have TGabs and be with people I know. Seriously. I barely recognize people and know a couple of their names...I'm not tight with any of them....the funny thing is, is I knew this was going to happen. Sam was the only other person I knew that signed up for sociology...and everyone I know did Gen. Psych or Economics.
Second hour, is of course Advanced Journalism. I love journalism...haha if you don't know already. Not only do I get to keep my sectioin to edit, but I also get to be on the Editorial Board as well. I don't think you understand how much this excites me. I get to ride opinions now on behalf of the paper (it wouldn't say by Jackie Smith) and also, settle any ethical dispute. OH I'm excited. But I kicked myself today, because I forgot to bring up parking passes. I should be able to get one. I'm one of two most experienced staff members - the other kid is the Composition Editor so he'll get one - I should get the other for kicks.
Third hour....omg Debate. I love debating also. Ah I'm excited. I don't even mind the work. I am just excited to get up and pwn somebody's ass! sweetness.&nbsp; It'll kind of prepare me for MAMUN...as nerdy as that sounds...then I'll be able to DOMINATE...I think i've said this before...oh well I don't care because I'll have episodes of random excitedness
A lunch - mainly with Ohoe and Megan-and a few other fjdkl;afsla;fkj;la's
Fourth hour, Epidemiology with Mrs. Wyzlic (Wyzlic, your mom is not a bad sub) till October. I don't really have any interest in the subject...or science for that matter, but Megan and a couple other fun people are as well
Fifith - GE with Ohoe, Muzz and Gina - rare event. There's also some others that I got along quite well with on the summer trip - and basically everyone in global ed knows eachother so it's a sweet class no matter what
sixth hour - some familiar faces - people to converse with in times when math isn't demanding, but it doesn't even matter because Mr. Shoemaker is sweet. He's like four hundred feet tall - and cynical and funny. hhaha he went on about union pay cuts for teachers and then he went : ""What do I know? I'm just the teacher at the end of B hall bitchin' and moaning.""&nbsp; and when he was going over the ""lame"" rule sheet, he got to detentions and went: ""Aaaaand, Detentions! .....God I don't know, don't get them.""


any way pretty alright first day of school...all first hour calamitites set aside."

My favorite moments of the weekend are by far Gina trying to pee in O-hoe's kitchen last night and Alex falling off the couch on Friday because ""He's so hott"" haha so many funny moments. When everybody drank it was better, because drinking and getting really wasted by myself like I did, was lame.&nbsp;
Overall, good weekend. End of story."

"event","I just really want to say to everyone who was at Olivia's last night, that I'm sorry for being a fucking idiot. Now I know why Alcoholics Anonymous is anonymous because they're all idiots the morning after.

I don't remember anything past strip spoons. However, I woke up and lots of people who hadn't been there previously were, and it was weird. I don't remember much at all.&nbsp; I know that I lost at strip spoons and I do think my clothes stayed on for the most part. Past that is a complete blank. I guess I was pantsed. Ugh. I woke with a penis on my arm and&nbsp; huge bruise that I don't know where from. I also was wearing Kenny's shirt and I'm not sure why.&nbsp;

I'm really sorry everyone. I'm an idiot and I won't drink at the sequel party tonight, I'll be the person that takes care of all the obnoxious people and no the other way around. I wish I remember what happened, that's only formality that started this summer, which blows. If I at least knew to what degree of an idiot I was, I could have a final verdict in my self deprication right now.&nbsp;

I hate myself for the possibilities of what I did. And that's about it. Again everyone, I'm sorry, beyond belief. I won't be getting drunk tonight, that's for&nbsp;sure.&nbsp;My day yesterday, was unbelievably bad, aside from the amazing lunchin with Sam. That's in addition to all of the drama lately that has had me gritting my teeth. So I just wanted to have a good time, and maybe for a brief period it was worth jugging the five o'clock. But now I'm reminded of why I hate vodka so much and that it isn't wise at all to jug it and then stuff your face with ice cream."

"event","Ah, Katie called me last night at like 9:30pm and i had already fallen asleep. It's now 6am and I'm wide awake. I need to make myself stay up later because this way I'm just bored for longer hours in the day. Hope Putt-putting was fun guys.&nbsp;

RAR, I am mad though, I am going to say this much. Yesterday afternoon my dad and I went to get Burt from Henderson glass because he took him in to get the cracked windshield replaced. Well I was driving Burt and I noticed that my stereo system wasn't on and a piece of it was sitting on the seat next to me. When I was home I showed my dad and I also found some pieces of colored glass in the back seat and a benign wrapper from ice cream that I didn't leave there. If any body ate ice cream, left glass, and broke my radio in my car because we went back to Henderson's to point this out.

In addtion to glass, broken radio, and the wrapper, the car was almost out of gas. I swear that when I left it was a quarter full. My dad remembers there being a decent amount of gas in there too, because if there wasn't he would've filled it up. The guy that physically put the windshield in said that the radio piece was there when he worked on it because he remembered seeing it and not wanting to accidently sit on it. I believe him because Burt sat in the garage for two or three fucking days before it was worked on.&nbsp;Now I have to take the radio to best buy and use the warranty after only one fucking month of having the radio installed. what if in a year it's stolen and the thing expires...fucking henderson glass."

"event","England/Ireland was amazing! I feel so cultured and I just want to travel more:
""So who cares? I went to places like London and Dubland. Why not travel more? Amsterdam, Pretoria, Rome, Paris, Beirut? All places that are or will be eventually worthy of my travel?""

Anyway that's how the whole thing makes me feel. I got to see Stonehenge, Bath, Stratford, Wales, London, Dubland, Oxford...and I loved them all so much. I don't want to talk about everything because the entry would be longer than the Book of Kells (which I saw by the way in Dubland at Trinity). So, I'll talk about it briefly and elaborate on my favorite parts.

I stayed in London for the first for days. I roomed with the girl named Rachel who has this rather Gwenyth Paltrowesqueness to her. She didn't snore which was good and she wasn't SO blond that I couldn't carry on a decent conversation with her. She was just way too into the Paris Hilton song.&nbsp;
Anyhoo, London is an amazing city. I would love to live there if I ever had the chance. It's culture, the theatre is great there as well. I saw a play/musical called Blood Brothers, which remains to be the only time I ever cried during a play. It was also the only sad musical I've ever seen. I recommend you see it if you ever go to England. I also went to the British Museum and saw the Rosetta Stone and the most amazing exhibit on Ancient Egypt that exists!&nbsp;Basically everything else consisted of shopping and walking tours of England. I also got to go inside St. Paul's (2nd biggest dome in the world), it was absolutely beautiful.

One day in London, we took a bus to see Stonehenge. FYI&lt; unless you have an appreciation for archeology, don't see stonehenge. It really is just a bunch of really old rocks placed in alignment with the Winter Solstis in the middle of farm land -&nbsp;the middle of nowhere.&nbsp;However it was a beautiful day and the pictures I took came out amazing. I could have spend all day standing there looking at one of the world's seven wonders, trying to figure out how it was possible for ancient man to transport 3 ton boulders 150 miles from the nearest sight of where rock actually exists, before the wheel was even invented too.&nbsp;The only thing I could think of was rolling them on logs, which would take a ton of time. After that we took the bus to Bath and saw the archetecture of the Ancient Britania city. It was incredibly pretty. A discombobulation of Georgian and Roman Architecture. It was also the sight of the ancient Roman Hot Spings. The structure of the Roman spa is still there, and so are the baths. I touched it. It was warm. I also got to taste the mineral water in which the hot springs gets the water from. It tasted like warm well water and I immediately felt healthier afterward.

The next day we left London and went to Oxford. Oxford University consists of like 39 different colleges and is in itself nearly a millenium old. We got to spend the day walking around the town of Oxford - and I bought a ton of Oxford paraphernalia. We then had a walking tour of the Campus. It's beautiful and the buildings are centuries old. I went up in the tower of a church on the grounds called St. Mary's (same name as where I was born). The view from the top was inspiring. I could see the centuries buildings all around. That night we spent at Pembroke College, which was like the 20 -&nbsp;something college instigated at Oxford. The courtydard in which the dormatory we stayed was gorgeous. Perfect grass you weren't even allowed to walk on, and ivy up the walls. Each of us got our own room - considering the dorms were for one person anyway. My room was on the fourth, top, attic like floor, but it was huge. It was bigger than my room at home, plus it had it's own bathroom with a shower and everything. There was a gorgeous bayish window with a bench right in front where I could look out in the courtyard. I kept thinking of the centuries of brilliant people who had stayed in that room as I had. So when everyone went back into town after dinner - I stayed in the room and took at advantage of the academic atmostphere. It consisted of reading and writing for hours until bed check.&nbsp;Oxford is by far my favorite place in all of England.

The next day we went to Stratford - it looks just like Stratford, Ontario, only bigger. The only thing we saw of any significance besides more Georgian architecture, was the home where Shakespeare was born. Just being in his former home was like being reborn to me. I love every Shakespeare comedy and tragedy and every sonnet and lover's complaint I ever read. It was no wonder that when I touched the floor in the room he was born - was like having an epiphany.&nbsp;Then we went to Trinity church to see Shakespeare's tomb. I felt like I had lived his life in one day. I wrote six sonnets and five pages of entry&nbsp; that night. Completely inspiring.&nbsp;

The next two days we spend in Wales - apart from incredibly beautiful scenary and ancient castles&nbsp; - it wasn't all I thought it to be. The nineth day we took the boat to Dubland Ireland. I'll just say I really wish I could've seen some of the country side in Ireland because Dubland is so similar to England because of all the British history. Ireland is actually a younger independent country than the United States, but is obviously so much more successful economically. In the two days we had to see the city, I saw St. Peters church, went and saw the preserved soil bog bodies, and shopped all over the city. I favorite part was basically the street beformers and Bono."

Oh how I know the world will be lost with me on the OTHER SIDE OF THE WORLD. 
And on the off chance Gina reads this too: YEAH THAT""S RIGHT I GET TO GO TO IRELAND TOO! haha because Gina's patially irish (though she doesn't look it), she's jealous lol - i'm mostly angry because I won't see her till summer's almost over. She's camping now, and when I arrive home, she'll be at cross camp. Which totally sucks, I just can't not see her for like a month. I'm just happy megan's going to be home tomorrow. YEAH! MEGAN! missed you darling, you have to come get your pillow from my house. 

don't have TOO MUCH fun while I'm gone. And no parties at my house, because my parents will be home lol. I know that the parties are always preferable when I'm not there being obnoxious.

"event","I have come to the conclusion that it completely sucks when you're parents are gone for nearly two weeks and you really get used to the doing, going, or participating in whatever whenever, wherever, and with whoever you want, then they come home and it sucks. I have a curfew again. I can't be really loud at 3:30 in the mornign like I wish I was being right now. I can't come and go at all hours of the night, or have any sweet ass sleep overs with free reign of the house 24/7.&nbsp;
So now we will probably enter a whole new age of boredum and it really blows. The benefit of their coming home however, is that I don't have to put up with the dogs all alone, and I did recieve sweet stuff from France (dangling belly ring, new earrings, a skirt, two shirts, etc..)

But hey kids, let's make the most of the next couple of weeks I've got before I go to England.
Peace."

Do you sleep with your sheets tucked in or out?<br />tucked around me pretty much<br /><br />13. If you could have one last day on earth, what would you do during it?<br />let's just say it would have to be switched to a last week on earth&nbsp; -&nbsp; there's too much.<br /><br />14. Do you ever dance even if there's no music playing?<br />yeah - usually I provide my own music in and out of dance class<br /><br />16. How many people have you slept next to this week?<br />this week? as in from sunday on? uh...two - Megan M and Martha<br /><br />18. What is your ""Song of the week""?<br />""Foolish Games"" because it's pretty much been in my head all week since I watched Lindsay Fortune's solo on tape.<br /><br />19. Is it okay for guys to wear pink?<br />Hmmm? I question this because usually I would think not. But I guess during an occasion that might warrant wearing pink, it's socially acceptable for them to.<br /><br />20. Do you still watch cartoons?<br />Um, yes. Daria every so often. Adult swim sometimes. Spiderman when I wake up at 8am.&nbsp;<br /><br />21. What's your favorite scary movie?<br />I don't really like scary movies - unless they're well made. Whatever ""scary&nbsp;movies""&nbsp;Stanely Kubrick directs&nbsp;are pretty good. I like gory movies - they dont' necessarily mean scary<br /><br />23. What do you drink with dinner?<br />Liquid.<br /><br />25. What is your favorite food/ cuisine?<br />Applesauce and Cheetos, however I get the impression this question implies fast food cuisine, in which I say Chicken Whoppers from Burger King or Junior Cheese Burgers from Wendy's - or grilled cheese from anywhere.<br /><br />26. What movies could you watch over and over and still love?<br />John Hughes movies, anything Morgan Freeman does, and I don't know why, but I will watch <em>Mermaids</em> over and over again.<br /><br />29. Would you ever strip or pose nude in a magazine?<br />If I were paid a handsome amount of money. Let's just say if I were Ashley Simpson, I wouldn't have turned down that offer from Playboy.<br /><br />30. When was the last time you wrote a letter to someone on paper?<br />Carl Levon sophomore year.<br /><br />31. Can you change the oil on a car?<br />It's probably one of the only things I know how to do that my dad has shown me, I just have never had to.<br /><br />34. Favorite kind of sandwich?:<br />turkey, lettuce, and mayonaise. or the meatball sub from subway<br /><br />37. Are you lazy?<br />Why yes I am unfortunately.<br /><br />38. When you were a kid, what did you dress up as for halloween?<br />my favorite one was probably a dead musician inwhich I walked around in a dead waiter's outfit and carried my empty cello case on my back for hours.<br /><br />40. How many languages can you speak?<br />Basically english, and what I can remember of french. I can handle double talk in the requiring circumstances. But I think I would like to learn the clicks and hand gestures of the Bushman in the Kalahari desert.<br /><br />43. Are you stubborn?<br />Yes<br /><br />44. Whose better Leno or Letterman?<br />Stephen Cobert.<br /><br />50. Ever used a gun?<br />Water ones. I've had a dream before that my mom got me a revolver and I kept shooting holes in trees.<br /><br />54. Ever eat a pierogie?<br />Uh huh, very nice.<br /><br />57. Do you believe in ghosts?<br />Hardly, I have to see to believe. To me, everything has to have an explanation for&nbsp;it to be plausible.<br /><br />58. Ever have a Deja-vu feeling?<br />yes<br /><br />62. What do you wear to bed?<br />When its really hot, just underware. But usually boxers and a tank or t-shirt. In the winter something like sweat pants and shirt.<br /><br />63. First concert?<br />I can't remember the very first one, but the last one I went to was the Dashboard Confessionals/ Brand New/ MXPX/ Piebald concert...one of which I wish I had seen the error of my ways in going to. Though I did have&nbsp;a good time with Katie and Sarah while there.&nbsp;<br /><br />72. Ever won a spelling bee?<br />I wish. I can't spell exorbitantly hard words.<br /><br />73. Have you ever cried because you were so happy?<br />I cry over anything. A good cry feels pretty good.<br /><br />85. Are you patient?<br />Not very. <br /><br />92. Do you want to get married?<br />yes.<br /><br />95. Do you cry and throw a fit until you get your own way?<br />I was the Queen of Scream in my earlier days...what do you think?<br /><br />99. Do you miss anyone right now?<br />Sam - I never get to see her during the Summer as much. And Gina because she's so busy with her two jobs and new boyfriend...ooooooh.<br /></font></span>"

"event","My parents have been out of town. It's been amazing for the most part.
Had people over the first night - stayed up all night and went to Meijers. Let me correct myself - we dressed up, then we went to Meijers.&nbsp;
Had a toga party - haha more like get-together. But what I can actually&nbsp;remember was a good time. 
Have gone to Steak n' Shake on numerous occasions. Yay for not having a curfew when my rents are gone.
Went to dance last night - had a good night with a couple of my dancing loves.&nbsp;
Took Burt to belltire this afternoon. Had the most random conversation with this twenty-something guy with a dress shirt and running shorts on. Werido.

Sam's coming over Friday night - joy!
I anticipate spending the next couple of days cleaning weeding out side. *sigh*

Parents come home Saturday night."

"event","<p>The following are a few recommended things Gina, Megan and I thought up in regards to the Toga Party we're all excited to hold in my house while the parents are in Europe. I hope I don't seem like a stiff, I'm merely cautious and really really really really dont' want to get caught.&nbsp;I love you all and I hope you all can come.</p>
<ol>
    <li>I'm pretty sure we're having it Friday (7/8) of July, mainly because it's the day that's best for Gina and we all know, it's not a party without our little alcoholic flirt. </li>
    <li>Only to begin with, all drinks will be made and poured in the basement for two reasons: 1, to avoid any spilling on the nicer carpet upstairs, and 2, if for some reason someone comes to my house to ""check up on me"" the booze will already be hidden and we can just send the guys down there with it. </li>
    <li>The majority of the drinking should start around midnight&nbsp; -&nbsp; that way any ""checkins"" from my relatives will be long out of the way. </li>
    <li>If you want to go for a walk or stand on my roof while your wasted (which I know is a common tradition of many of you), please do so when it still dark out side. I don't want to run the risk of anyone getting caught in daylight. </li>
    <li>Boys please park your cars on Pembroke - the street adjacent to Flamingo - the Muzzells will drive by in the morning - I don't want them to think there were too many people over.</li>
    <li>YOU MUST WEAR A TOGA, or at least put one on when you come over. It is your choice what you wear underneath, just as long as nothing pokes out to say hello, it's cool - preferably wear underwear lol....yes Kenny, you have to wear underware. </li>
    <li>If you plan on getting wasted on somebody else's booze, pay them, unless they otherwise say so </li>
    <li>COME AND HAVE A SWEET TIME! I hope so anyways </li>

"event","Spree and fireworks and such have taken place. All a good time for the most part. A really weird situation happened at CVS Monday night, and all I could basically say was, ""eww, I'm a minor."" We went canoeing in Wixim, which I learned was north of Livonia. The parts with just us were fun, but the other times (specifically by the dam) were just...interesting I guess. 
Then I went home and sat around basically. At like 830 I went to the Civic to meet everyone there to see ""Just My Luck."" It was a really stupid movie and the Civic doesn't have a drinking fountain. Ugh. But we went to Gina's after and had a brief bonfire before I had to be home. 

That's really all that's happened....haha good times a wait in the future I'm sure.
I, however, am not looking forward to the pointless meeting for England I have to go to at school tonight. I'm at the point where I don't even want to go. I'm merely going to see England and nothing more."

"event","Yeah dress rehearsel was yesterday. I can't say that I like it, but it is necessary, and does get me enthused for this weekend's recitals. For a while yesterday, I thought I was going to get dehydrated...again. When I get dehydrated, it's bad. I hurl, and it's not pretty. Luckily I drank enough water so I was peachy after a while. However, by Martha's intensive, Color Spectrum, I was so exhausted. Then for Silver Fairy, my only pointe dance this year, it felt like I couldn't do anything. Seriously, it's times like those that I wish I had more pointe classes in the year so my performance doesn't blow so much. Finale rehearsel was beyond tedious. We practiced it three times for three different performances, but since precision is the last dance all three recitals, I do the same exact thing. Not that I mind, it's pretty much the same for everyone. There were so many things I forgot to do for rehearsel, I didn't so my ballet shoe elastic or tack down the Silver Fairy tutu. Ah hell, I'll bring saftey pins and call it job well-done.&nbsp;
I'll be honest, I am excited to an extent for recital, and the weird thing is, I don't know why. Haha, maybe mostly for dances like Celebration in Gold and The Blues Brothers. Blues Brothers is fun because our costumes have suspenders and we're wearing hats and sunglasses and I sort of get really into it. haha oh blessed tap.&nbsp;

anyway, recitals tonight

"event","<p>Today was a bit of an accomplishment for myself. I managed to finish just about everything&nbsp;on the <em>to do</em> list my mom left me this morning. There is no word or phrase that accurately describes how utterly aggravated I was when I saw the page length list of tasks. I read the paper and ate breakfast, diving head first into my predetermined agenda for the day. In the end, I cleaned the kitchen, the bathroom, did all my laundry, washed some rugs, took Lucy to the vet with Muzz (btw she has a benign tumor), and sorted all of my costumes for this weekend's recitial.<br /><br />Some time later, Megan and I went to the Anderle's for dinner. It was good pasta, rice, salad, and bread, which was a perfect considering we wento Buffalo Wild Wings after and I personally, couldn't afford to more than water there. This way I was full. After Bdubs, we watched <u>Freddie Got Fingered</u>. I can officially say that movie is ridiculous. Sure, I admit it had its humorous moments, my favorite being the part where Tom Green has the strings and the keyboard and the sausages hanging from the string, constantly reiterating the ""Daddy would you like some sausage?"" Yes, I nearly peed my pants, but some parts were really gross. For example, the part where Tom Green dances around in the deer skin and gets hit by a truck. Or, the part where his friend gets the compound fracture, or even again, where his dad is slapping his naked ass. OOOOoh man. Let's just say that everyone should enjoy their young asses because it was unnecessary to watch this old guy ""grab his flab.""<br /><br />Anyway, I'm out for the night, though ""out"" merely implies I'm done with livejournal for the night.<br /><br />Here's my new signing off line, I got it from the doctor at the vet. This is what he said about Lucy's tumor:<br /><br />""It's big, red, and ugly""<br />Good Night folks<br /><br />P.S. ""That's Tits"" and ""That's Grass"" are the new ""That Sucks,"" replacing ""That Blows.""</p>"

"event","so Friday I woke up at like 10ish, and it was incredibly nice. I did some laundry and I vegged moderately. I had dance at 3:15 which lasted like an hour total. When I came home, Megan was pulling into my drive way. She reminded me that we were going to the The Guess Who concert that night. We went with mr. and mrs. Muzzell, and Olivia, Gina, Megan, and I crammed in the back. I bought cotton candy for five bucks, big waste of money, because I was unable to contribute anything for the $15 Olivia and Gina got, but like always, I mouched off of others and ate three pieces. Well Blood Sweat and Tears, or should I say the alleged Blood Sweat and Tears played first, it was kind of lame because it was basically like a tribute band. The Guess Who part was good there, even though the lead singer looks like a wide faced Sebastian Bach.&nbsp;<br />We didn't get home till 12:30, and I of course couldn't fall asleep for another hour or so. It blew because the ACT was the next morning. Just to be frank (haha you still be who ever you are), the ACT makes me feel so monsterously stupid. I&nbsp;like to think that&nbsp;I'm a relatively&nbsp;smart person (for the threshold I have anyway ), but seriously it's ridiculous, you have to be fuckin' Rainman at everything to do well on that thing. I'm not the most omniscient person, I just think that I'd do so much better if there were a social studies and vocabulary portion, which there isn't. It's because it has like science comprehension rather than actual science and that it doesn't have every necessary core subject that I think it's a mistake to replace that with the MEAP. And I can't help but feel partially offended when people get an amazing score (which to me is anything over 25), and want to retake it. I know that if you don't get it the best you can, at least by your own standards, retaking it seems logical. It's just that wasn't good enough for some people, is a score that I can't even fathem getting.&nbsp; I had to take the ACT at Thurston High School out in Redford. I was surprised that it wasn't that far away, and that I actually saw a couple people I knew when I had previously thought I wouldn't at all. I ended sitting behind Brian Szpak, this kid I had three classes with all year, and I saw Megan and Gina's cross country friend Kelly in the bathroom. It was some how comforting to know that there were people there that I recognized.&nbsp;<br />After the ACT I went straight to Dance group pictures. Let me illustrate, how much I loathe going to focal point for pictures, I mean, I loathe it more than I do Mitch Album. It's crowded, lengthy, and I just don't ever like doing it. I forgot my ballet (sperm unitard) costume, so I made everyone wait while I went home to get it. By 4 or 5 it was over and I went to the studio for martha's intensive. Martha's intensive is always a good time, even if it is sometime uncomfortable being taught by a usual contemporary, I just so excessively drained and so god damn hungry! We ended up ording pizza and only running the dance a few times.<br />Good time and all, when dance was over, I was extremely ready to go home, since I had only been there briefly all day. When I got home I felt like my head was going to explode. I immediately felt a stress headache rising and I can't even really tell you why. I had been flustered about the ACT all day, and dance pictures was sort of stressfull, especially since&nbsp; Mrs. Jessop yelled at me. Also, my dad tried to start up a conversation about getting a job, which is a constant pressure threshold from my parents and I get really sick of it. I just thought about dance, the ACT (which brought on all this shiznit about college), job searching, and my family...basically I thought about everything and how so much is wrong in my life in almost every department there is. I sort of felt helpless like there wasn't much I could do about anything and broke down. It was good in the end because I called Muzz and she came right over and talked about stuff with me, plus a good cry always feels really good&nbsp;no matter how much I was hyperventilating this time. We talked a bit and I felt better after. A lot has gone on in her life too. If you haven't heard the latest about her brother and family, ask her, but it made me appreciate things which was greatly needed. Thanks Megan, I love you a lot hunny.&nbsp;<br />Sunday was a little better. I had an extra dance practice Sunday morning that was necessary, but hell did I not want to go. By the time we ran the dance some it wasn't so bad. I like going to dance, it's just been so frequent in scheduling lately. Six days a week for the past month. It just makes me glad that it's summer and I get a break from everything, dance and school alike.&nbsp;<br />My parents came home from best buy yesterday with stereo equiptment for Burt, which really surprised me due to the fact that its been over a month since my birthday and I thought they really didn't care like last year. I was going to have to go in today to get installed myself, which I didn't mind, I just didn't have enough gas in Burt. So I cleaned the gutters for three hours and made fifteen bucks for gas. I had dance at 7, which was fine, even though I wasn't physically capable of doing much due to fatigue.&nbsp; When I got home my mom gave me all of the envelopes for dance pictures and how she wanted me to get a picture in my snow queen costume from the last nutcracker, and I just sighed. I really prefer not to because I still have mild resentment for the last nutcracker. The part I was given this year wasn't bad, snow queen is fine. It should just be amazing, especially since it was my last nutcracker. I got the shaft the entire time, from the costume I was supposed to have to the choreography I was given to dance. The snow queen before me, Meghan, kind of had the same situation, except she was an overall better one than me. I just feel like the part in general should be more of a bigger deal than it is. I don't know how the experience was for the other snow queens, but I feel like Barb never really cared about my part.&nbsp; My mom had ended up making my costume for it and she wants me to take a picture in it wednesday. I prefer not to still, even though she busted out the minipulation and cried kind of ""I worked so hard on this costume."" I know she's right so I'm going to, I will suck up the memories of a performance that I'm much less than proud off.&nbsp;<br />Today was good. I woke up at like noon and hopped in the shower. I cleaned burt inside out and sweeped my kitchen floor for my mom. Then went with Megan to best buy. Through the course of turning my car in for radio instalation, I had a conversation with the best buy guy about ripping out my back seats to put in speakers and I responded, ""<strong>well be carefull because there's junk in my trunk</strong>"" I felt like an idiot and just hen megan walked in the door from outside, and the dude and megan both laughed at me.&nbsp; He replied, ""good choice of words."" Gina came and picked us up and we went to hang out at my house. On my way to dance, I picked up Burt and basked in the enjoyment of listening to music in my car that didn't&nbsp; envolve headphones.&nbsp;<br /><br />Now that I drive my car, I feel so unworthy. I know I don't deserve the new stereo system. Now that its summer, I'm going to earn it.&nbsp;<br />I""m going to get a job.<br />I'm going to keep neat in the house.<br />I'm going to do what they tell me with in reason.<br />I'm going to be a good daughter for once.<br /><br />*sigh*<br />happy no school."

"event","<font size=""2"">Well, I've gone through two of these things. And this makes my third. I'm starting this now because it's during summer, when I have so much more time on my hands and at times, more to write about. I don't have to worry about school, or even dance, and I can concentrate on what I want. Such as writing in this brand new, kick ass, or soon to be anyway, journal.&nbsp;<br />Yes the name: Quick shoot me now...really only applys to school and such during the year that I sometimes feel like well...quickly shooting myself lol.&nbsp;<br /><br />Anyhoo, I'm going to type now as if I hadn't just typed any of the above.<br />Today was the last day of school, finals too. It was so weird walking about of school as a senior, or maybe it was just the five books, a sweater, a sweatshirt, a coat, two hats, and a Lebanese flag that I had to carry with my bare hands because I didn't bring a backpack. I seriously walked to my car carrying so much shit in my hands. It was ridiculous. But after school, I went home and began to copy and paste all my old journal entries into micro soft word. It was excessively long, 123 pages to be exact. 123 pages filled with nothing but meaningless crap of what I thought was important. But by the time I finished, I had to leave with megan. We went to visit Riley in the last day of its existance with Katie, Kazda, Callie, Byrne, and surprisingly, Jeanne St. Onge. We did get to see Mr. Rathburn, Mr. Smith, Ms. Larose, (UGH mrs. beiderman), and Ms. Creighton. I'm really glad Ms. Creighton remembered me. And eventually Mr. Rathburn did to, at first he thought my name was Ashley, and then remembered me when he heard my name. We visited Riley's entirety, including the upstairs gym, in which Katie took out a basketball and played, and we all stole Riley paraphinalia, I took gray sweat pants...that I wore to dance.&nbsp;<br /><br />Ugh I had dance from 3-4, 5:45-7, and 8-10. It was obnoxiously long, but was the last Thursday, so it was imperitve that I be there. But now I'm whipped and I would very much like to sleep.<br /><br />So I'm off to bed, good night to any one reads this first official Journal entry.</font>"

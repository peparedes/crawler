"event","what you mean to me

                        by nick hansen

You turned my darkness into light;
You made everything all right.
You picked me up when I was down;
You turned my life around.
If I didn't have you, what would I be?
A blessing is what you are to me.

When I needed you the most, you were there;
Even if it seemed like you didn't care.
When I didn't think I could make it another day,
You chased all my doubts away.
If I didn't have you, what would I be?
A treasure is what you are to me.

The world is full of many people, it's true;
But there is only one of you.
You fill my heart with love;
You're a God-sent gift from above.
If I didn't have you, what would I be?
An angel is what you are to me.

Lost and alone, I will no longer be;
Because you are here with me.
There is no reason to be sad;
You've taken away all the bad.
If I didn't have you, what would I be?
A best friend is what you are to me!! 



i love you so much i wanna cry 


                          if u need me 
                          by nick hansen

If ever you need me,
I'll be right here,
To chase away the sadness,
And wipe away a tear.

If ever you need me,
I'll be two steps behind,
To follow in your footsteps,
And hear what's on your mind.

If ever you need me,
You'll never have to fear,
That your presence isn't important,
And your love isn't dear.

If ever you need me,
I'll always be around,
To bring back the laughter,
Where deep in your heart it's found.

You'll never have to worry,
For I'll always be here,
To chase away the sadness,
And wipe away a tear.



                      LISTEN AND WATCH
                      by. Nick Hansen
 
        what a thing it is to sit on my roof alone at night,
                       relaxed yet so tight,
            listining to the wind and wathching the sky,
               watching the rain fall right on by,
          nobody started it and nobodies is gonna stop it
               it will go on as long as it whants
         and as long it gose on i will listen and watch.


Close To The Flame 

The kiss sweetest 
And touch so warm 
The smile kindest 
In this world so cold and strong 

So close to the flame 
Burning brightly 
It won't fade away 
And leave us lonely 

The arms safest 
And words all good 
The faith deepest 
In this world so cold and cruel 

So close to the flame 
Burning brightly 
It won't fade away 
And leave us lonely 





You Are The One 

No I won't surrender 
At any cost 
You're something so sweet and tender 
From my heart 

Yes I've done my evil 
I've done my good 
Just believe me honey 
 I won't let go off you 

You are the one 
And there's no regrets at all 
You are the one 
And there's no regrets at all 

We've had our share of misfortune 
We've had our blues 
And God is not on our side 
Yes it's true 
We keep forgetting baby 
The others too 
There is no one who can take that away 
From me and you 

You are the one 
And there's no regrets at all 

You are the one 
And there's no regrets at all 


Beautiful 

Just one look into your eyes 
One look and I'm crying 
'Cause you're so beautiful 

Just one kiss and I'm alive 
One kiss and I'm ready to die 
'Cause you're so beautiful 

Just one touch and I'm on fire 
One touch and I'm crying 
'Cause you're so beautiful 

Just one smile and I'm wild 
One smile and I'm ready to die 
'Cause you're so beautiful 

Oh and you're so beautiful 
My darling 
Oh you're so beautiful 
You're so beautiful 
Oh my baby 
You're so beautiful 
And you're so beautiful 
Oh my darling 
Oh my baby 
And you're so beautiful 

right here in my arms

She is smiling like heaven's down on earth 
Sun is shining so bright on her 
All her wishes have finally come true 
Her heart is weeping. This happiness is killing her. 
It's right, she's in love 

She'll be right here in my arms 
So in Love 
She'll be right here in these arms 
She can't let go 

Repeat 

So hard she's trying 
But her heart won't turn to stone...oh no 
She keeps on crying 
But I won't leave her alone 
She'll never be alone 

She'll be right here in my arms 
So in Love 
She'll be right here in these arms 
She can't let go 

Repeat 






Bury Me Deep Inside Your Heart 

Let me wake up in your arms 
Hear you say it's not alright 
Let me be self dead and gone 
So far away from life 
Close my eyes 
Hold me tight 
And bury me deep inside your heart 

All I ever wanted was you, my love 
You...all I ever wanted is you, my love 
Your're all I ever wanted, just you 

Let me never see the sun 
And never see you smile 
Let us be so dead and so gone 
So far away from life 
Just close my eyes 
Hold me tight 
And bury me deep inside your heart 

All I ever wanted was you, my love 
You...all I ever wanted is you, my love 
You're all I ever wanted, you, oh my love 
You're all I ever wanted, you, my love 

That's the way it's always been 
My heart stops beating only for you Baby 
Only for you Darling 

All I ever wanted was you, my love 
You...all I ever wanted is you, my love 
You're all I ever wanted, you, my love 
You're all I ever wanted, you, my love 
  




 Heaven Tonight 

I hold your hand in mine 
I hold your hand and you're so lonely 
Oh so lonely 
Your eyes have lost their light 
Your eyes have lost their light and you're empty 
Oh my God you're so empty 

(I'm in love with you) 
You are my heaven tonight 
(I'm in love with you) 
You are my heaven tonight 

Trying to find the heart you hide 
Trying to find the heart you hide in vain 
Oh in vain 
And you're my haven in life 
And you're my haven in death, Baby 
Life and Death my Darling 

(I'm in love with you) 
You are my heaven tonight 
(I'm in love with you) 
You are my heaven tonight 
(I'm in love with you) 
You are my heaven tonight 
(I'm in love with you) 
You are my heaven tonight 
(I'm in love with you) 

Reapeat 

That's right 
(I'm in love with you) 
That's right 
(I'm in love with you) 
That's right 
(I'm in love with you) 
That's right 
(I'm in love with you)"

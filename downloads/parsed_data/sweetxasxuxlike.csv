ehhh....these are just a few stupid quizzes ive taken during my alotted hour of tv today...(my mom found out about the prom-oh how much i risked for so little!- and im on extreme probation). its just all too much. a week ago this moment i was getting off that accursed continental plane, stepping back into the horror and humidity i have come to know as my life. if i could back a week ago this moment i would have run home immediately  and burned that accursed dress, not even waiting to sell it (well, maybe to sell it, i probably would have goteen a good price on it....). but once again i can see the light at the end of the tunnel, maybe in time for isa's quince. its really not that bad tho....im having my dad send me a bunch of books from the states (because even thats not against the rules...) and ive got no pressing issues on my agenda to be filled. that is, to say, that ive done anything ive planned on (well, almost everything, right mary?) and the rest can wait for a little while. in fact, its best that it does. 

i know i really havent had the oppurtunity to tell everyone about my trip to mexico, but now that i think about it, and without going into great detail, theres really not that much to say. the highlights were:
1.ali getting detained by the airport officials (that was fucking hilarious tho)
2.my committee (and everything related)
3.the assemblies....(no comment)
4.my host! (she was the best right ana? :-P)
5.the people i went with (i couldnt have picked a better travel group, and enrique can liven up any picture!)

thats about it. i could go into everything, like how derek got his gender confused and had to declare his obleas :-P but i dont think anyone cares that much.

eh id write more but there really isnt that much to say, and the whole concept of typing quietly (to elude my mother as the use of my computer is expressly forbidden) has eluded me, so i shall be off before i am caught, again.

muahs much.

P.S. o and by the way, my icon refers to someone new. and TOTALLY deserving ;-)"

prom last night. disappointingly, well, disappointing. reminded me just how MUCH i HATE my ex, who annoys the hell out of me while trying to get ""some"" :-P right like THAT would EVER happen again! jaja......left early cuz i was depressed and my feet hurt like a bitch so i had him take me in a taxi over to marys house to get my backpack with all my shit in it.

these were the two options he gave me:
keep partying till 6.30 (it was 2) until i had to go to school
have him drop me off at a motel or something to sleep
^^me: ""what? ill have to think about that last option there.""
him: ""well i wouldnt stay and if you wanted me too, id be perfectly gentlemanly.""
right. so my options were to subject my feet to another 4 1/2 hours of torture, or be raped by some cheap motel owners(cuz i wasnt goint to intercontinental on $15). or i could be raped by my ""gentlemanly"" (horny) ex. some options.

so i told him to take me to marys house to get my stuff and by this time im about to fucking just burst out crying. i go up to her floor and my shit is sitting outside. now i had told marys mom i was at angelas, so there would be no excuse to be there, but god i just needed to talk to maree soooo badly.

fello was still waiting in the taxi, cuz i told him i would be back out again. 
me: ""hello? listen im gonna stay here ok?""
him: ""ok""
it was probably the best conversation id ever had with him.

 so i go in the stairwell, make the call, and out she comes. she loves me so much, and within 5 minutes im in her room changing for bed. we talked for a while, and hugged, which i really needed, and then i got about 4 hours of sleep, which i needed even more.

i woke up, got ready, and went to school on marys bus. and after that everything was normal, except that mary left. *tear*

i miss her a lot already. pipo and i are already having severe withdrawal symptoms, and it hasnt even been 8 hours. 

i leave for ny tomorrow. hopefully this will be the distraction i so desperately need.

hopefully yours,
vivis"

in Contradiction. Controversial, unpredictable, and<br>never what anyone expects.
You appearance and your personality are two<br>opposite things. Even your
appearance sends different signals to different<br>people. To some you may look
innocent and sweet, to others you look mysterious<br>and intimidating at the same
time. No one ever knows what to expect with you.<br>You are a little bit of
everything all mixed together. You can be watching<br>the football game with the
guys one minute and the next out shopping at the<br>mall. You seem to be almost a
different person every time you meet someone, but<br>at the same time you know
exactly who you are and there is always that one<br>thing that makes you you. You
enjoy keeping people guessing and people love how<br>completely unpredictable you
are.</p>

whoa. christ how long has it been since ive fucking updated???? :-S ... wow before panamun...(more than a month, and by far one of the most eventful *so far*). i picked out my prom dress yesterday......its so fucking beautiful and thank you piBo jaja :-P for coming with me i had a *sexylicious* day....muahs! i need to call fello tho....party on friday to raise money but i think i can get in for free jaja ;-) and i got to have something fun to do while everyone else is working their asses off studying for gayass easy semestrals...life has been a ton easier lately. mary got over that bet sin tav resh dalet(ask me what this stands for in english*its hebrew by the way**kinda*) and shes got something good coming something good i can tell ;-) luv ya lots babe....partied last friday.....made an ass out of myself jumping over pipo and doing my drunken ballet jaja it was so hotnsexi :-P christ its fucking 10, i have a geometry project thats 5% of my grade due tomorrow i havent even looked at, and my rooms a mess and the workers will be coming in all day tomorrow to work haha i have some really good priorities...

it was a really fucked up month for romance tho....i succeeded at and allowed everything i wanted...but it wasnt as great as i imagined....i hurt a few ppl along the way, mostly including myself, and gave myself a few more shameful moments to look back upon in later years :-P i just wanna start over and ive already got a little something something lined up for my extended absence in new york *que romantic!* haha who would have ever labeled moi as a planner? :-P if you wanna know more, i got plenty of stories *especially for all those of you who i might have been excluding in cali...sorry babes!* but i jsut dont feel like creating more drama by posting my *entire* life on the web ;-)

really fucked up month for friendships too. i had a couple of falling outs with some*one* while at the same time meeting some of the most awesome ppl ever (GOTTA LOVE YOU PIPO!!! YOU ROCK MY SOCKS FOREVER BABAY!) jaja you too dan NANNY FOREVER no jk hahahaha. got the thrill and disappointments of my life when i subsequently found out mary was staying all four years, then learning that the embassy changed it back to two... :-S i know itll all get better tho, if dalet resh dalet taught me anything its that its easier to get over even crazy shit with the help of a few close ppl. te amo. seriously, te amo.

im prob gonna start updating more consistently now....i guess i was jsut too busy and had too much to say before when everybody was pressuring me to....now that a lot of things are out of the way i can clear my head and get back to whats important, like CSI--whoops gotta run!

you know you &hearts; me,

I CANT BELIEVE I FELT BAD THIS MORNING MARY! im such an idiot! >:( i cant believe i almost fell for that act.... i feel awful, but only because of thinking how close i came to being used again. NEVER AGAIN. there were so many signs; the lack of communication, the enormous feeling of distance between us, his continual avoidance of me (shy and nervous my ass!) it would be bad enough just as it is, but my last relationship consisted of this one guy (who i really liked) who ""used"" me then abandoned me for my friend who gave him a handjob. and he (d) knew this. BEFORE we did anything too! and im angry at myself too, if not just as much. i should have learned my lesson about this sort of ""relationship"" from before, and not trusted ANYONE to make the right choice! and maybe i should have waited until later in the year (because i did want something anyhow, not just as a result of what happened), and maybe i should have waited for him, because i knew he was still ""confused"" about his last relationship. its the truth. guys think with their dicks, but girls think with their hearts. and only guys leave ""satisfied."""

"event","you remind me of everything i can never be
and yet im
joyful
knowing that i will have a 
lost world 
with me as long as 
you 
are in my heart.

you can never forget some things,
and this is best because the worst things in life make the best memories worth having

the only pure form of love is that which is sheltered from the public eye

the only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it

theres no sin....except stupidity

one should always play fairly...when one has winning cards

the power of acute observation is commonly called cynicism by those who have not got it

the trouble with her is that she lacks the power of conversation but not the power of speech

i want money in order to buy the time to get the things that money cannot buy

i think i am. therefore i am...i think

remember: dishonesty is the second best policy

if god really made everything, id say he has a quality control problem

i wonder why prostitution is illegal. why should it be illegal to sell something thats perfectly legal to give away?

nothing you write, if you hope it to be any good, will ever come out as you first hoped

cynicsim is an unpleasant way of saying the truth

people change...and forget to tell eachother

death is just nature's way of telling you ""hey, youre not alive any more""

god forbid anything should be easy

love is blind, but desire jsut doesnt give a good goddamn

humor is emotional chaos remembered in tranquility

sixty minutes of thinking of any kind is bound to lead to confusion and unhappiness

under certain circumstances, profanity provides a relief denied even to prayer

los angeles's full name is el pueblo de nuestra senora la reina de los angeles de prociuncula

never regret anything that once made you smile"

"event","*sigh* its like soo uneventful now after this weekend its almost kind of depressing! this weekend, when emy and i were planning all the dares and shit before, was supposed to be like the best weekend of the entire year. i mean no offense and everyone else probably had a ton of fun, but it was ok. saturday was fun like going to the beach and all but then like we had the party and there was nothing to do and the guys locked themselves in the room and then ali got all bitchy to sofia and like i was feeling awful so i went to bed at like 10. and then when i got up i was feeling even more tired even though i was asleep for like 4hours then i had a big enough breakfast for fucking fat bastard and then i jsut went up to the room and fell asleep again. it was nice though because when i came back i felt worse because i was hungry and achy and my parents had just yelled at me and then derek was online and we talked and he told me i made his day when i called him on saturday. it was really nice to hear that."

"event","ok well this is going to be kinda long because i havent updated in a long time cuz well ya no shit im grounded from comp and all. tuesday was pretty ok except for the whole talk with derek which was  1. really confusing and pointless in the end and 2. i think he might have asked me out but i wasnt really listening OOPS ok well ya its not like i didnt care or anything, its just that gd when youve had to say the same thing to a guy over and over again, it kinda gets boring listening to yourself and so i just kinda zoned out. i talked with mario like the whole bus ride home wich was pretty cool like hes a really cool guy friend. haha we were like quoting entire snl skits...""here are a few of my favorite cities....SCHNITZELS WITH NOODLES!.....they call it a diablo martini because it gives you a devil of a good time....GOULET!.....thats my catchphrase, its me, robert goulet!......too many cherry pop tarts....one,when the dog bites (ouch), 2, when the bee stings(im allergic), when youre feeling sad, *a single tear*.....ive done the music industry a frigging service...the coconut bangers ball, its a rap....ba da do be bop thong song.....POPPA, I LIKE IT WHEN YOU CALL ME BIG POPPA....puffman, coolioolio, dre......youre hungry arent you?....thats why i come up here.....quick staring contest! you win, you always win.....R O W D I E THATS THE WAY WE SPELL ROWDY!.....whos that spartan in my teepee?....NATIVE AMERICANS!.....the perfect cheer!.....you have some split ends, its ok, im a friend....i respect your honesty, but it still hurts....my friends call me whiskers, cuz im curious like a cat.....if the moon were made up of spare ribs, would you eat it? i would, in fact id even have seconds and wash it down with a cool frosty one!.....would u rather get mad cow disease or be the top scientist in your field?...the thinker, and the stinker......WINK!.....i got an A, 2 Bs and a C!....we're going to the dolce gabbana show, how fast can u have your bags packed?.....suck it trebek....ape tit!..... a one, or a two, or a three, or maybe even a four....thats the way your mother likes it! ok well ya that was fun anyways nm im frustrated also and most ppl know why but because this is public and some people will most likely be reading it very often, i will keep at least one thing in my life sacred from the public eye. that is until you know tomorrow when everyones had the chance to talk to everyone else about everyone else if you can follow that. hey people you know what? the subtlest clue you should ever leave for a guy(concerning dates, gifts, anniversaries etc.) should be printed in big block letters on a neon post it note stuck to his face. honestly im starting to get kind of fed up. i mean it was great for the first few days and i mean ppl if this sounds confusing to you imagine how it is to me! nojk its just cuz i havent explained the details to you yet. anyways ya i mean this actually turned out to be a pretty crappy journal entry. screw it"

"event","hey everyone just wanted to tell you that i might not be online for a little while (read: got grounded offline for two weeks). well as most of you may know the awesome party i had last friday night while my parents were gone was discovered when those assholes in adminsitration downstairs gave my parents the receipt for 75 dollars (for the social area downstairs where we had the party) and a complaint from the building about the overall ""rowdiness"" (my ass) of the thing. so ya now my building hates me, im grounded for three weeks (sry derek!) and im like never allowed to have parties in my building again unless i have them up in my penthouse. Ugh they are absolute fags!!! Also, i cant go to coronado which absolutely sucks ass because that was going to be the best weekend of our entire high school years honestly! on a slightly less traumatic side note, ive completely lost my parents trust, but hey, it was bound to happen anyway. OMG THOSE WHORES THEY TOOK AWAY THE 700 DOLLARS IN MY ACCOUNT!!! i hate them soo much! now i cant go shopping or go out to dinner because they are not going to even LEND me money. they are such fags they are making me work for it, for as much as my maid gets an hour! its an absolute outrage. when im a famous writer in the dedication im going to mention how all my inspiration came from pure hate, rage, and pain. then im going to thank my parents for inspiring me to write. gd they are so stupid. my mom kept coming into my room and saying (vainly in an effort to cheer me up,) that ""sofia/mary is 'meurta' too"" what the fuck is that supposed to mean?!?!?! she is such a stupid bitch sometimes i wonder what she drugged my dad with to get him to marry her. honestly. and like thinking that i had sold my friends out was going to make me feel better??? JESUS CHRIST they are assholes. i felt so bad honestly i know this is going to sound so insecure but i thought when i came to school today that everyone was going to ABSOLUTELY hate me i have no idea why i guess i just assume the worst sometimes. oh and now my dad is all like freaking out because he thinks im losing weight and im all anorexic and i mean im not denying it (to him) because hey anything that makes them worry about me will prob get my laptop back sooner but they dont know about me sneaking bowls of whipped cream up to my room at night! haha that sounds really immature but hey come on like you wouldnt be anorexic too just so youre parents would freak out and let you go to your friend emy's party because it might make you less depressed and you would eat more and then you could be normal again and start eating in front of ppl? honestly! well mary is like hitting me (on me haha ppl) jk and so i have to go 

&hearts; u all (haha especially u mary!!)"

"event","3:33 p.m.<br /><p>Drunk again.<br /><br />I wake up and abruptly find myself face-down in a porcelain vessel licking up the last little bit of bathtub moonshine before it goes down the drain. I&nbsp;lift my head too quickly and hit the back of my head on the faucet, knocking myself cold.<br /><br />3:33 p.m.</p><p>Drunk again.</p><p>I&nbsp;wake up, groggy, my one open eye peering down a bathtub drain like its some kind of home-plumbing periscope. I don't remember what I&nbsp;did last night, or when I&nbsp;passed out. It could have been days, weeks ago. Yet there's fresh whiskey on my breath. Bathtub moonshine, and that gentle rust flavor tells me it's been brewing in the flophouse over on 32nd Street--assuming I&nbsp;passed out while drinking it straight from the tub, and didn't empty the tub, get up, leave, hit another party and pass out in a totally unrelated pub. I'm just lucky I drank enough of it up before I&nbsp;went under. Knew this guy,&nbsp;Tom, was dared to suck up the last half-inch of the tub. Tom is down there, slurping it up, and the poor bastard comes up for air and hits his head on the faucet!&nbsp;He passes out, facedown in the tub! That's what happened to Tom anyway, but how did &quot;I&quot;&nbsp;get here? Suddenly I&nbsp;remember, so  I&nbsp;lift my head too quickly and hit the back of my head on the faucet, knocking myself cold.</p><p>3:35 p.m.</p><p>Drunk again.</p><p>I wake up, cloudy-headed, wearing some kind of ivory facemask that's way too big for me, with just one little tiny steel-grated eyehole. There's bourbon on my breath--and good stuff, too! The nose is sandy...yeasty, more than malty, sea salt and honey. The slightest rye note, gritty. The taste is rich and velvety texture, slow growing into subtle earth. Medium burn, semi-dry.&nbsp;Firm oak. Still rather young, but fresh and vibrant. It's a 10-year-old Eagle Rare single barrel, fifth batch. I'd been holding onto it for a special occasion. So I'm celebrating? In my ecstacy, I lift my head too quickly, striking something blunt and losing consciousness.</p><p>3:35 p.m.<br /><br />Drunk again.<br /><br />My eyes open, and I&nbsp;swear I'm in Heaven because all I see are bright white lights. There's just a hint of red wine on my lips. There's a halo spinning around my head whenever I try close my eyes, but the white lights are so bright, so I&nbsp;let them loll and blink, halfway between euphoria and vertigo. I'm dizzy and I&nbsp;rise to get get up, and pierce the back of my skull on the back of a sharp object, and then fade to black.</p>3:39 p.m.<br /><br />Drunk again.<br /><br />I wake up with what's either a Bloody Mary or blood pooling in my mouth, dripping down from the back of my head. Odd. I&nbsp;never drink tomato juice or bodily fluids unless I'm in a bedroom, not a bathroom. I&nbsp;begin to vomit and raise my head, hitting that goddamn faucet.<br /><br />1:14 a.m.<br /><br />Sobering up. <br /><br />Time to get to the mules, sun'll be up soon. I raise my head to get a start on the day's work, but I hit something with the back of my head. Or maybe something hit me. Somemule. Distracted by adjacent bathroom, and notice some moonshine around the basin of the faucet. I&nbsp;jump into the tub and suck up the remaining drops, jump up and hit my head on the faucet, knocking myself out.<br /><br />"

"event","""What the HELL are you doing, Tomorrow, Tomorrow, I'll love you tomorrow?"" I hated that damn musical, but more than that, I hated being named after a damn song from it, so this set me on edge.  This helped a lot, as I was doing my best to extract the Mule's blood.  You see, not only was this a virgin mule, it was a female virgin mule, and we needed its damn blood for another 5 years' worth of fuel for the Gable tractor.  In a blind rage, Clark had snapped its neck, not that he was angry or any somesuch beeswax, but because he just got the urge to every so often.  He'd try and do it to me, too, but the stubble on my neck is as tough as rubber and unbreakable as my will after a few handles of sweet, sweet antifreeze.

Any which way, there I was with a funnel, getting this damn mule over my shoulder and draining its blood into the Gable Tractor's fuel recepticle, made out of wood, grease and iron.  If it wasn't for this baby we'd've never got out of so many scrapes and japes, as me and the G man used to say.

""I hate it when you call me that, Tom.""  Clark was looking at me again with a steely eye.  Damnit, had he been reading my inner narrative again? ""You bet I have been, Tomdapadom.""  Damn, I hated that name.  ""I know you do, and I know you care about that damn Mule, Tom, so get draining that dirty whore over your shoulder before I break your neck.""  He could n-""I KNOW I COULDN'T BREAK YOUR NECK, IT'S A TURN OF PHRASE.""

Guh.

""Don't take that tone with me.""  

The Gable Tractor clucked back into action, spitting hot fire into the air and playing the theme of Matlock, and we were on the move, hauling our asses across the Grass towards the West, where we'd find my damn Mule, my damn wallet, and maybe some whiskey.  I was already running low, and this wasn't gonna be your grandmother's trip across town.  

Talking of towns, we were just entering one, when I realised where we'd just entered.

I looked at the sign and let out the nearest thing I have to a squeak - which is, of course, me breaking wind.

""Something up, Tommodactyl?"" I hated being called Tommodactyl.

""Yeah.  Yeah, something's up, alright.""

I read the sign.  It said ""Mayor's Income, TN."""

"event","This is a little known fact about me, but, among other famous inventions, I was the first guy to come up with  the idea for the telephone. It happened when I decided that my mules were gettin' spread too thin. How can you get behind the mule when he's all the way on the other side of the barn?

Now, I'd experimented with different ways of commulication for awhile. I tried hollerin' real loud, but mules can be pretty involved in what they're doing, and not pay attention. My voice only carries for about eight miles unless I shout really loud, and that's not enough of a radius to reach all the mules. I tried getting a big bell and hittin' it with a stick, but that just scares them off for some reason. I tried playing all sorts of tunes on my harmonica. Now, we all know that I've got my mule call down now, but I didn't write ""Singapore"" until 1985, and it was pretty tough in the early years.

But, finally, one day back in 1962, it hit me: kind a way to carry my voice! I tinkered around in the shop awhile, and I came up with this:

<IMG SRC=""http://img88.imageshack.us/img88/4659/506628tomwaits200x2000ay.jpg"">

There's me, in my workshop, with the first functional mule-caller, or telephone as it has come to be known. I had a post every quarter mile or so with a receiver, and when I hollered into my megaphones, it would travel down the wire to the posts. Now there tweren't no mule that couldn't hear my call.

But, wouldn't you know it, I went running off at the mouth at the bar, and this funny lookin' bearded guy overheard me.

<IMG SRC=""http://img88.imageshack.us/img88/2003/agbell18769yr.jpg"">

That's right, Alexander Graham Bell: a liar and a cheat. He leaned over real close, put his arm around me, and ordered a round of drinks while he asked me more about my idea. ""Boy there, Tom, I sure am interested in this donkey-caller of yours!"" he said. Now, I should have been wary by how he couldn't tell a mule from a donkey, but as long as he kept the booze coming, I was willing to listen. And, boy, he made sure to get me good and drunk, drunk enough to take him home and show him the blueprints. I tried to put up a resistance, but we were at the bar so long. 10 turned to midnight, midnight turned to last call, last call turned into opening hours, noon to night, Friday to Saturday, January to March. Eventually, I was good and buzzed, and a bit out of my senses, so I took him home. Then he reached into his jacket and hit me over the head. I passed out.

The next thing I knew, I woke up in a bathtub full of ice. My kidneys were gone, and so were the plans for the mule-caller. It was 1972, and nearly a third of the homes in the United States had mule-callers. Within the next two decades, the technology would be widespread, and I lost my claim to fame and fortune."

"event","I dunno.
There's not a day that goes by when I don't think about my wife.  And by that I mean, I don't think about my wife at all, because I lost track of time way back in 1863.  You know what I mean.  Anyway, talking about mules, yesterday I got in a lot of trouble with MUFF when I went to represent my company, NOPOOP, the National Origami Pelican Origami Origami Pelican at the National Mule Festival this year's month.  For those of you not in the know - get with the program, guys - MUFF is the Mules' United Funk Foundation, a group of mules who really like funk music.  I know Mules, but I've never understood their irrational love of funk, nor why they turn into Fats Domino after one too few drinks.

But as for my MUFF troubles, the problem was I turned up at the NMF last century stone-cold sober - it was the first time in a while, and what can I say, I thought they'd have wine or something else that'd get me good and hammered.  But they didn't.  Mules are usually well known alcoholics, but this was a dry festival, and all I could see for miles were mules and mules and no god-damned alcohol.  I was pretty worried.

Then this guy came up to me.

<img src=""http://img460.imageshack.us/img460/3334/token0713056ei.jpg"">

""You lost, man?"" He said, staring at my clean, white eyes and my shaved mug.  ""I...er..."" I hadn't got any words in me.  Not many, anyway, as this mule was about to find out unless it got out of my baby-smooth face.  ""I say...YOU LOST?"" I hate being patronised, even more than I hate being called T-Unit, and I was getting angry.  ""Y...you got any drink man? Anything.  Anything at all.""  The mule looked offended.  

""Nuh-UH, you got the wrong mule, man, I'm a MUFF.""  I've seen a lot of muffs in my time, and this wasn't what a MUFF looked like.  ""Look man,"" I said, ""You're no MUFF.  I know MUFFs.  MUFFs are big, hairy, and I usually see them because I'm drunk.  And I'm stone-cold sober.""  Then the mule mule-kicked me, right in my favourite place in the whole world.

Singapore.

Now, I don't know if you've heard about me going out west, but if you have, then you know that I gave a clear warning that said ""I know Karate, and voodoo too.""  This mule obviously didn't know that, so when I busted out a karate chop that shattered it into three halves, he was pretty surprised.

Then I realised I was surrounded by funking MUFFs.  

<img src=""http://img54.imageshack.us/img54/3599/mule1806cl2xl.jpg"">

Then I realised that I keep a bottle of Jack Daniel hidden in all of my undershirts.  I downed it in one go, and everything became clear.  Or it didn't, because next thing I knew, I woke up in a bed with two sleeping hookers, and it was two o'clock three days earlier.  Work that one out.  

I already have, so don't expect a prize for doing so."

"event","Clark and I got about five miles down the road before the Gable Tractor ran out of gas. It's a fine vehicle, don't get me wrong. It gets amazing mileage, and once you get it up to top speed that baby can really fly. It's just that fuel is hard to come by. You see, the Gable Tractor runs on a combination of whiskey and the blood of virgin girls who've had their necks snapped by Clark himself. And whenever me or Clark come across one of those thinks, we usually drink them, respectively. So, a bit down the road, we sputtered to a stop.

""Boy, Tom-Tom,"" Clark said, ""I guess maybe I should have put that ten year-old I ravaged a few miles back into the gas tank instead of into the newest notch on my belt, eh?"" I hated being called Tom-Tom. ""Then again, maybe you could have poured one of those bottles into the gas tank instead of your belly, eh, Tomadeus?"" I also hated being called Tomadeus.

I looked into my weekly supply of whiskey. I started off with sixty bottles, and we'd only been on the road for about two and a half minutes, so I still had fifty-seven bottles left. I considered it, but then I remembered what I looked like after the last time I went a week without a drink.

<img src=""http://img494.imageshack.us/img494/6484/tomwaitssober4fq.jpg"">

""...looks like we're hoofin' it, Clark,"" I replied.

""But Tom-Bomb,"" he replied, knowing I hated to be called that, ""Where are we going to get hoofs?""

I thought it over for a mintue, then pulled out my harmonica and played my mule call, waiting for one to show up. We waited for about five hours in awkward silence, until Clark spoke up.""

""Umm... what was that?""

""That was my mule call, Clark.""

""But you just played the first four bars of 'Singapore',"" he replied.

""You just wait and see,"" I said. And, sure enough, a few hours la ter, who should show up?

<img src=""http://img138.imageshack.us/img138/5062/mule2small2vf.jpg"">

""That's amazing!"" Clark said. ""But are we supposed to ride this thing?""

""Well, Clark,"" I said, ""Sometimes you just have to get behind the mule."""

"event","I woke up last night. That's surprising enough all on it's own, of course. After a bottle of whiskey or eight, I usually take one of my monthly naps. As in, lasting a month. But I must have switched off to cheaper whiskey at some point in the night, because I started drinking on Saturday and woke up before the week was out.

So, I wake up, grumble, then turn over to look at my alarm clock. But instead, I see this:

<img src=""http://img101.imageshack.us/img101/6802/mule1small2cw.jpg""/>

I asked him what he was doing there, and what his name was. He replied his name was Amanda, and he said he didn't know how he got here, that the last thing he remembered was drinking cheap whiskey (to which I laughed, then drank) and passing out in a barn. I asked him to kindly stop referring to my house in that manner, and told him I put a lot of work into this place. I built it myself, and I even just gave it a fresh coat of paint.

<img src=""http://img528.imageshack.us/img528/4330/20025qm.jpg"">

Amanda replied that any place that had a silo filled with corn and roosters in the yard probably counted as a barn, but I had stopped paying attention even before my own sentence was finished, and went back to drinking. He asked for a swig. I don't give drinks to anyone, aside from Ernest Hemingway. I can't say why. Let's just say I owe him one.

Anyway, he keeps going on and on about wanting a drink, so I rolled to put my back toward him, then mule-kicked him out of the bed and through the barn door of my house. Those damn mules. They always forget that I picked up more than the mule flu from spending so much time with them. I know their tricks. I know their ways.

And I know all their variations."

"event","The mule wants it Sunday.

I tell the mule that it's gonna get it one day, and it gets angry and walks out the door, saying I'm an asshole and that I'll never do anything good with my life.  Well that's a pretty big thing for anyone to say, let alone a damn mule, so I swing myself out the door as it trots off and tell it to come back when it's got itself some damn manners.  I say itself, but really it's a she, and my what a she she was.  A rich almond coat with little white splotches around the ears, and mule-fur so exquisite you could eat your lunch off of it - as I did one day, just as an experiment, you see.

So like I said, off it went, into the street, and my landlady put her head out the window and tutted.  She never knew why I kept mules, but I paid the rent, and I kept the place cleaner than Mr. Stitches and his three cats, all fur and fire and anger and fur, twitching and meowing all night long when me and the mule were just trying to get some shut-eye before my morning drink.  

So I stumbled back into the house and got a bottle of Jack Daniel, and we had a good heart to heart for an hour or five, talking over my various problems and deciding that they were out of my control and that the waitress had it coming and that I was the best god-damn dancer that New York had ever seen, and Mr. Daniel was right.  He was always right.  Never once did he tell me anything wrong, because if he did, he'd be out the window, into that burning New York heat, with the kids who play with bottlecaps and sing Buddy Holly and that Hobo, Mr. Joe and his five-legged dog.  Yeah, this was a real city, and I was a real man, built for fighting and dancing and writing.

I'd just got this internet thing, see, and I'realised that it's the best invention since sliced toast.  It's got everything - pornography, mule-sighting sites, mule pictures, mule biographies, mule testimonies; the works.  You can look up information on anything, and there's an internet guarantee thing that makes it legal in all 53 states, including the panama canal.  I nodded as I brought up google to look for some tiny mules and fats domino records, when I realised something.  Patting my side, that damn mule had taken my credit cards, snapping off the chain with her marble jaws and leaving before I had the chance to do my bi-monthly pat-down to make sure everything was in order.  

So slung my arm upwards and grabbed my gun.  I knew where she was heading.  She was my damn mule, and she had my damn credit cards, and there was only one place she could be heading.

West.

I picked up the phone and tapped in a number.  ""Clark? Yeah, it's Tom.  Get the Gable-tractor going.  We've got a mission.""  Clark was shaving, so all I could hear was this pressure as he forced the hairs out of his face.  I'm not much for face-shaving, but when it comes down to it, my hair knows its place.  It knows when it's not wanted.  And you can bet your bottom dollar that it gets out before I notice it's there.  

""Thomas!"" I hate being called Thomas.  ""It's Tom, Clark.  We've got to go.  Get the tractor going.""
""You said it, Tommy!"" I hate being called Tommy too. But I could hear him starting up the tractor.

I put down the phone, and walked over to a box in the corner that I marked ""for emergency mule recovery.""  I opened it up to see my collection of pristine bottles of Jack, marked with numbers one to sixty.  Just like that Nurse Rachet, I could kill a drink as well as I could nurse it, so I closed the box up and dragged my week's supply of the sauce to the side of the door just in time to see through it that Clark had pulled up in the Gable Tractor, grinning that grin of his and waving like an idiot.

""Hey, T-bone!"" I hate being called T-bone.  ""I see you got your whiskey ready!"" I nodded.  Damn smartass Gable.  Always stating the obvious.  But he was a good fighter and a well-seasoned adventurer, and just the man I'd need to get my damn mule back, along with my damn credit cards.  

And then I heard it.  The squealing. 

""What the hell are you doing blowing all that damn smoke up here you ruffian! I'll come down there and clip your damn ears you bastard-ass!"" The landlady was fussing over the sound of the Gable Tractor, and I instantly knew something was going to go wrong.  Clark's ears pricked up, sharper than a lemon full of razor-blades.  ""You shut up, Missy, or I'll break your neck!""

Unlike some guys, Clark never kids around.  If he says he's gonna break your neck, he means it.

The landlady shut up, and went back in the house.  Phew.  That was a close one.  She'd survived the wrath of an angry Gable.

I walked down the steps, box in hand, and piled it onto the back of the Gable Tractor.

""Okay, Tom.  Where're we headed?"" I looked grim.  There was only one place that damn mule of mine would head.

""We're goin' west, Clark.  We're goin' out west."""

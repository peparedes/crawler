In fact I am not even sure if it was ever made, but in my opinion, it should have been. How could there not be a special place for them? A place where shit is shoveled down there throats while being told that it is for their own good. A place where each day feels like a century, due to the mindless droning that constantly bores its way into their very sub-conscience.

I am referring to the Apostle Pimps of course.

What is an Apostle Pimp?

I'm glad you asked.

People of all different cultures ad Myth-os have spent years conniving and controling peoples minds and wallets with scare tactics and verbal bullying. Hell this, Hades that, damn you and to hell with them. Buy your loved one's way out of Purgatory! Tithe! Tithe! Tithe! God the creator of all things needs your hard earned money to feed the homeless! (whatever happened to some fish and bread?) These children need your help! (our children need our help too....) 

5%

That is the amount these ""charity organizations"" actually are required to send to their cause. Five whole cents out of every dollar. Where does the rest of it go? To the pimps of course.

These people are whoring out their own beliefs, troubles, and souls for what? A few extra dollars? 

All the while how many ""souls"" see the Prostitution of their Institutions and give up on their beliefs all together? How much Gold can a Catholic see in Mass before they realize who paid for it? And how long will their Deities put up with their corruption before bringing Hell down on their heads?

I say not much longer at all.

The time is near for God, Allah, Jehovah, Christ and whoever else to bring about the...

Apocalypse for the Apostle Pimps."

"event","So a friend of mine asked me a philosophical question the other day and now I am going to make an attempt to answer it on here. 

I hope you enjoy it.

The question was; ""How can mankind solve it's greatest problem on it's own?""

My answer;

First, as with any problem that must be solved, the exact problem must be identified. The biggest problem mankind has could be argued until we are blue in the face and still not everyone would agree with what the problem is. Since the question was asked of me, I will have to assume that the problem is the greatest problem that I am aware of personally. In my opinion humanity's biggest problem is the inability to accept. 

Accept what? 

To accept anything. Mortality, immorality, evolution, laws of nature, loss of materials, loss of loved ones, loss of love, loss of anything, insanity, depravity, but most importantly, things that are not in our control. Of course things that we can't conrol are the only real problem we have, for if we could control them then we could fix them and they would no longer be a problem.

So, lets look at the things that we can't control. Obviously, the aforementioned list is a good start, but when one takes the time to really think about it, what is there that we actually can control? 

An example of what I am saying could be your television. You own your T.V. You own the remote to to your T.V. You can replace anything about the remote or T.V. set that isn't working properly. So therefore you must be able to control what is on your T.V., Right? Wrong. You simply have a narrow selection of pre-set programs available to view that was decided by the T.V. networks. So then the Networks actually have control of what you see on your T.V.? Wrong again. Their selections were made from a list of programming assembled based on ratings. Well then obviously it must he people who set the ratings that must control it. Of course when decide what they do or don't like they have only a limited selection of Pilots (original show ideas) to choose from. 

So, basically, it doesn't matter how far back one traces the line, the true source of control will never be determined as it will eventually just be another step back in the process. The tricky thing, is that everything in life can be traced by following the same systematic approach. So how does does one explain all of this nonsense into a world the is based in logic? Science says, ""Big Bang"" and that everything else is just luck. Religion says, ""God"", ""Karma"", ""Allah"", or other such beliefs. There are others who claim ""aliens"". Of course there is no logical way to prove any of these theories.

My answer...Chaos. Life is what it is. Nothing more, nothing less. No great mysteries, no alien plot. No government scheme to control the universe. 

No control of anything by anyone.

Humanity's biggest problem is they can't accept that there is no higher being or purpose. They can't accept that there is no point to any of this.

Humanity's salvation?

Accept life and enjoy it."

What distance fades to stormy gray.
Wash out from the deep of the ocean.
Here I will stand to face your wrath.

Why are we ever so afraid?

Calm down my heart,  don't beat so fast
Don't be afraid, just once in a lifetime.
Calm down my heart,  don't beat so fast

Torn into the deep of the ocean.
I don't pretend that I love you,
'Cuz there is nothing left to lose.

And when silence comes back to me.
I find myself feeling lonely
Standing here on the shores of destiny,
I find myself feeling lonely.

I had a light to give,
Many dreams to live.
Don't you know that your losing so much this time?

There is no lesson you can learn.
And there sounds you cannot hear.

"event","All my life I have fought to hold onto certain ideals. Rules that I try to live by. My own set of twisted morals if you will. I say twisted because the majority of people labor under what I perceive to be a false set of morals. My own personal beliefs and guidelines rarely match that of another person. So in as much fairness as I am capable of, I say that my morals are twisted, even though I believe that it is humanity itself that is clearly wrong.

I digress....

Anyways these rules that I live by, are just some of the many things that define my person. So since a new acquaintance of mine asked about me, I will give somewhat of an effort to describe the way I try to live.

First, humanity as a whole is evil and therefore not to be trusted with anything important. One might ask why I would think that humanity is evil. So, I will humor you. All your so called good causes have caused more pain and suffering in the world than any other event, person, or natural disaster. Your religious crusades where you try to force your beliefs on other people have claimed more lives than Hitler ever did with the Jewish people. You war amongst yourselves while trying to make others believe it is for the good of all that you kill each other. You torture the sick by plugging them into damn machines instead of letting them be at peace. Millions starve to death because you think its ""wrong"" to learn how to pull your damn dick out instead of creating more children you can't feed. I could go on for days but I think you get the point.

Second, death is a natural thing. With a few exceptions in history, whether true or not, no living thing is immortal. We will all die. Our deaths will not be unexpected, for only a fool would expect not to die. We as humans don't do nearly enough of it. We have overpopulated the world to the point where we are running out of natural resources. At least that seems to be the general consensus. However, we will not kill this planet. Earth has stood long before us and will continue to exist long after our demise. When we become to big of a problem nature WILL kill us off. 

Third, honor IS worth dieing for. Sooner or later in every persons life there comes a time when all will be lost and the only thing that will be left is their honor. When that time comes if that person does not have their honor they will have nothing and thus they will be nothing. Just so there is no confusion, honor does not mean honesty to others. Honor is staying true to yourself.

Fourth, know thyself. For all you know I could be the Pope, the Anti-Christ or both. Who and what I truly am is relevant for only one person to know, Me. Any one else who knows the full truth of my being is by my decision alone. This doesn't mean one can't ask, it just means I may not answer or I may not answer truthfully.

Fifth, I demand either fear or respect. I don't really care which in most cases as they are often the same. When a person holds neither for me then there is no place in my world for them.

Sixth, never allow transgressions. If it is mine, it is not to be tampered with by anyone with my allowing it. This not only goes for material bull-shit but more importantly the intangible things such as ideals.

I have always tried to live by these rules, and thus far they have served me well. I have survived through hell and back, faced countless evils in the dark, and walked through the fire that is human emotion. All for one thing have I struggled for. Now, the time is drawing near when I shall claim that which is due. That which is mine. Of the nine, eight have been claimed. The one who walks shall walk no more. It is almost time for the ninth to fall.

I am coming."

I can see it now....

The rest of the world forms a new union aside from the UN
dedicated to ridding the world of sporks, because even the wisest of  people couldn't figure them out.

After many suicides of philosophers grieved because they were stumped by the problem of the spork, the union will be formed.

They will call this union UNAS (United Nations Against Sporks).

All will join this new allegiance with the exception of two countries,Switzerland because they've never stood for anything in their whole stinking existance, and the US because we're too stupid to realize that there is no real purpose for the spork. 

However, due to the inventions of skiing and Ricola, Switzerland will never be attacked. That and the fact that it is basically worthless territory anyways. But the US will suffer the onslaught of countless third world countries. Countries who are pissed off because while they can't even seem to find a decent meal, we can't even seem to find an efficient way to eat the meals we have.

After the US is wiped off the map..

The world economy will boom without the drain of the overpopulated society of the moronic masses. Unfortunately there won't be enough people to support the new booming economy, so it will crash even harder than before.

People will starve.
Then nukes will fly.
And time for all humans will cease to be.

"event","Last night was calm, too calm. Perhaps I was being over sensitive to the night in its stillness but then again, when am I not being sensitive to the night. Those of us who are the most comfortable with ourselves often tend to be enamored by the darkest, deepest nights. When the sun has hidden itself on the far side of the world, and even the moon seems ashamed to show its face is when we get to see our true metal. The dark of night is the truest mirror. It is the mirror that shows us the dark within ourselves. When we have come to accept what we are and face the beasts within us the night becomes the most serene time we will ever have to search our own souls.

The dark of last night was far to calm for my liking. No crickets chirped. No frogs croaked. The only sound in air at all was the lonely barking of a dog who sensed the same wrongness that I felt. I have yet to determine what transpired in the early morning hours but of this I am certain. The warm night in the middle of January smelled of death. Not the foul odor of rotting flesh mind you, but the unmistakable air of the Reaper himself. So today I am wondering, for whom will the bell toll? 

Perhaps I am just being apprehensive due to the upcoming date. Tomorrow will mark the third anniversary of the death of my fiance. The one who bore my soul. Now that she has passed I feel soulless, as if the very essence of my being was ripped from within me. I can only hope that the upcoming birth of my son will renew my vigor for life, and give me the reason I need to rise in the morning. 

Until I find what I that which I seek, I will continue to stare into the night, into myself, into the darkest mirror."

    Did you ever wonder about the other end of that statement? What if they were murdered? Surely the person who shot the man in the head expected him to die. In-fact, I'm quite sure he would have been surprised if the victim lived. Now that is unexpected. Imagine what it would be like to read the obituary of your own victim....


.....John Doe died unexpectedly from a tragic gunshot wound to the head on Dec 14, 2003. He was survived by his wife Jane Doe and two children, Johnny and Janey. Services will be held....


    Now imagine the shock and surprise you would have to learn that the family expected him to live through being shot in the head. Makes you wonder what they were smoking doesn't it? Perhaps that's why you shot him to begin with. Perhaps it was a drug deal gone horribly wrong. John was buying drugs for his family from you when you shot him in the head. Now poor Johnny and Janey will have to whore themselves out for a fix. Jane will have to play the pimp of her own children while giving hand jobs for crack. A family is tragically destroyed all because you decided it was more profitable to shoot John in the head, do the drugs yourself, and rent your street corner to poor John's family.

    Perhaps instead of experience we should all try to exercise a little wisdom. If we never make the mistake to begin with how can we possibly repeat it? Personally I think that there are no such things as mistakes. There are actions which are followed by consequences. Whether or not it was a mistake is not for us to know. There is a poem in the front of the Mother Goose Nursery Rhyme book that I would like to share.

For every evil under the sun,
There is a solution, or there is none.
If there is one, seek till you find it.
If there is none, then never mind it.

    This poem holds so much profound truth to me. It still amazes me that something we naturally know as children, we seem to forget as we grow older. People always say they wish they were still children, because kids have no real problems to worry about. That is about the most self-centered, bullshit excuse for a plea for sympathy I have ever heard. Do we really think so highly of ourselves that we believe we have more problems than children? So many things people take for granted, such as; tieing your shoes, counting to ten, walking, running, and everything else a child has to really work for in order to have a chance at succeeding. 
    What really challenges us? The boss being a pain in the ass because he actually expects you to do a job that your being paid for? Perhaps what challenges us is trying to find a vent for sexual frustration because we were not hugged enough as kids? When you think about it, what do you really have to worry about that is so DAMNED important?!?! I have news for you. You have nothing to worry about. Tomorrow the sun will still rise. Day will follow night, and night will follow day. Whether we are here or not is irrelevant. Things will go on as they always have. We, humans, are rather insignificant to the rest of the world. We are not needed for anything else to work right. We are not the saviors of any particular race, if anything we damn them with our presence. 

    So I say to you, to all of you, who sit around worried about their woes that do not matter at all to anyone... 

    ""HOW DARE YOU?!""


    They say history repeats itself. They say those that are unaware of their past are doomed to repeat it. They say hind sight is 20/20. I wonder if that's why ""they"" are always falling down. Perhaps instead of worrying about where they have been, they should watch where they are going."

"event","Consequences. The whole world and its daily decisions hang on consequences, the ""what ifs?"". It has been argued that the failure to see these consequences is a large portion of the problem with crime.

I disagree.

It is my belief that all people have a basic understanding of the consequences of their actions. Granted some of these people just don't care but I believe there is a much larger issue at hand.

The Pay-off.

To me, it appears that the majority of criminals understand the consequences but find that the Pros are better than the Cons. No pun intended. To put it bluntly, its a scale weighing the Pros and Cons. Is the pay-off worth the risk of incarceration? 

For example:

A man thinks of robbing a bank. He thinks to himself, ""IF I get caught there will be Hell to pay, BUT the chance of me retiring early is very good.""

So he looks to see if the scale tips in favor of the ""BUT"" or the ""IF"".

If the ""IF"" is larger then he doen't do it. If the ""BUT"" is bigger he is good to go.

So......

......if your looking into a life of crime, may i suggest you get off the Adkins diet and work on getting a bigger ""BUT"". Because the big BUTs get the roll."

"event","It is a proven medical fact that a great deal of birth defects are caused by inbreeding. Species of all types were designed to spread out before coupling with a mate, not sit at home and drool over your sister.

That being said, now we will move on to human anatomy. To start with I would like to discuss the fact that are eyes are in the front of our head. If one were to look at nature and try to pick out the predators, the easiest way to find them is the location of the eyes. Predators eyes are always in the front so as to provide depth perception. This depth perception is needed in order to hunt and kill their food. Where as other animals, ""prey"", have their eyes on the sides of their heads providing better vision around their bodies to help protect agaisnt predators. 

Another piece of the human anatomy is the appendix. The appendix serves but one purpose. A purpose that isn't used much anymore but still has the capability. This capabilty, this purpose, is to digest bone. Not bark, nor nuts, or seeds. Bone.

Thus I have logically deduced that someone who cannot eat meat must be incapable of the act. If they are incapable it must be because their bodies don't work like it was designed to. If their bodies are not working properly it must be because of a defect. This defect has a very high likelyhood of being caused by inbreeding.

So.........

"event","I've come to the conclusion that the first hour in the morning is the most frightening time when it comes to what my mind wanders to...

Still somewhat trapped in the Umbra not really awake yet not asleep either the nightmares from my dreams seem to try to follow me into the world of the waking. Obviously these dreams pose no real threat to anyone. What disturbs me are the thoughts that form in the recesses of my brain when I have yet to realize that in this place, this waking hell, my thoughts and actions affect others. For example....in my dreams if one were to offend me it would be quite alright to decapitate them, but in the waking realm this appears to be viewed as unacceptable social behavior.

--snickers to himself...

Of course the example provided is a bit extreme but the point remains the same. What if everyone in the world went through their days demonstrating the same behavior they display in their dreams? What kind of world would we live in? Murder rates would sky-rocket, suicides are way up from all the fools who like to ""fall"" in their dreams, all beds would no longer be on frames but securely attached to the floor so nothing can hide under there, closets would be nailed shut, and to quote Bill Murray ""cats living with dogs, we're talking mass hysteria here"".
One thing is certain......there would never be a dull moment.

I wonder what Freud would have to say about that.

Which poses yet another interesting question. If the world were this way, what would we dream about? Would our nightmares consist of being stuck behind a desk for eight hours a day? Or perhaps we would dream of holiday rushes, egg nog, screaming children in a movie theater at a movie they shouldn't be in anyways, dead end jobs, piss poor retirement, taxes, voting for some idiot with an accent, or living to a ripe old age just to suffer the indignity of pissing yourself on a daily basis.

It would appear that this, like many other things in life, falls into the cliche.......
......fact IS stranger than fiction.

I'll keep my monsters under my bed, my demons in the closet, my long falls with sudden stops, and you can have your waking hell....

because waking up is scary."

"event","A knock came to my door the other day....religious people with religous propaganda.
I love these people. They don't even know me yet they are kind enough to come offering eternal life. Problem is I have no use for eternal life. Where would the thrill of life be without the knowledge that one day it will end? So, unfortunately I had to decline their offer to live forever with whomever....

Since they no longer had use for their soapbox after my comments I decided to borrow it for a while....

It went a little something like this...

""Imagine if I were a super-genius. So immensly powerful in my intellect that I had the capabilty of geneticly designing a new race of beings. Then I built this new race because I had the ability. They were built so well that they had capacity for reason, free will, self awareness, problem solving skills, and a soul. Then I told this new race of beings to worship and love me or I would torture them for all eternity.""

At this point the carpetbaggers for god looked quite horrified. So I asked them...""If all this were true, what would you think of me?""

Some of the words that came forth were: evil, sadistic, twisted, satanic, wrong, and scum.

For all my efforts I have yet to find the differnce between my little hyptothetical scenario and their god.

So I guess if I were a god I would not be a very good one."

"event","As of late I've been wondering what has got me in this funk. I can't seem to break free of the of boring everyday hum-drum of the world that never used to bother me. Perhaps I have been thinking too much about the holidays and the way they used to be when ""things"" were better. Seems like every time I find a place of peace the holidays foul things up. Hmmm....there's an interesting thought.....never really thought of Santa as a war mongerer, come for the purpose of destroying my peace. Then again that leads to another thought of interest....what if these feelings of peace are as intangible and unreal as the Chris Kringle himself? The latter is probably closer to the truth. As a result it seems that my moods tend to rub off on all those around me. For Christmas cheer I have the tendency to stuff everyone's stockings with smart-assed comments and sharp retorts to their well wishings.

That said....it would appear that for Christmas this year i have a gift for everyone....

Funk for all."

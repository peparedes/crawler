"event","<p>OK! i created this journal, just to keep track of my weight loss. After quitting meetings and doing it on my own now, I'm going to try and use this journal and my communities more! (my old journal has friends who i don't think need to see this stuff)<br /><br />This mornings weight was 257.5.&nbsp;<br /><br />Got up and went to Curves like I'm supposed to! Good start. I CAN do this.&nbsp;<br /><br /></p>"

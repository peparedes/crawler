"event","Hey, so I heard via some new social network that Livejournal has cleaned up some of its interface and made things work better, so I thought I'd come test it out. If I actually start writing here again I'll have to clear out some of my own cobwebs--hello icon from 2006!

The diary tradition is to write about how so very long it's been since last I wrote, and then stall out because there's nothing particularly interesting top of mind. Let's see how far I get. If you follow me on Twitter or FB you know most of my quick hits--knitting is still awesome, infertility is still terrible, San Francisco is still delightful and expensive, and I still miss San Diego. We have a little dog called Rusty, maybe I should try putting a picture of him here:

I could be more specific about infertility related things, I suppose. From January until a few weeks ago, the next round of IVF had been on hold because we couldn't get my thyroid stimulating hormone measurements within euthyroid range. I switched dosages back and forth and back and forth--a new dosage takes a month to show properly, so they'd switch me from say 225mcg to 200mcg, I'd have to wait four weeks, then get my TSH tested again. Then I'd have to go back down to 175, wait another four weeks, find that wasn't right either, and go to 200. Finally we ended up settling on the goddamn dosage they'd prescribed in January, because my TSH measurements were *magically* in range in early August. And then they put me on birth control to regulate my cycle in preparation for the embryo transfer[0] which made my TSH go nuts again. So I'm now on a standing order for thyroid checks and getting weird instructions like ""take three double doses this week then switch back to the regular dose the rest of the week"". But I'm also on a calendar for IVF again, huzzah. 

Also during this time of thyroid bullshit I discovered that FOR MONTHS I'd been using skin for my insulin pump infusion sites[1] that had become scar tissue from overuse. My blood sugars had been surprisingly erratic and I couldn't figure out why--I was switching sides and occasionally moving to my abdomen, but I couldn't get them where I wanted them. Finally I decided I would just switch to my abdomen only for a few weeks to see what happened, and boom. My basal insulin needs went down TWENTY-FIVE PERCENT within a week. (Lots of lows there. I still hate Smarties.) I would also like to note that despite what I could see were shitty blood sugars, my A1C was still 7, which is in the acceptable range for type 1s, though certainly higher than I would have liked. Now that my blood sugars are much more consistent, I feel physically and existentially better. The existential contentment is particularly nice. I really did feel like I was losing my mind for a while there.

Ok, stopping abruptly, it's time to go cook some vegetables. See you on Ello or whatever!

"event","Some time in 2007, <lj user=""zigeunerweisen""> sent me a bundle of Rowanspun DK after she'd found it wasn't working into a sweater she liked. I was a pretty novice knitter at that point--stashless, even!--so I didn't know what I was going to make it into. I was sure it wouldn't be enough for a full sweater for me, so I started whittling away at it with smaller projects.

First was my <a href=""http://www.ravelry.com/projects/kirinqueen/my-modified-knotty-hat"">Modified Knotty Hat</a>. 

<a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/kirinqueen/423539607/""><img src=""http://farm1.static.flickr.com/159/423539607_b66dee0199.jpg""></a>

This was only the second or third hat I knit, so I didn't know much about sizing to fit. I held the yarn double or triple to make it the worsted called for in the pattern, but I don't think I got row gauge. I actually really liked this hat until it somehow felted a bit and become too short to cover my ears. This pattern dates from before Ravelry, so I have no idea how I found it.

Not long after that I made <a href=""http://www.ravelry.com/projects/kirinqueen/bubby"">Oatmeal the Bear</a>, also with the yarn held double or triple to get worsted-ish gauge.

<a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/kirinqueen/444530643/""><img src=""http://farm1.static.flickr.com/207/444530643_bdec296319.jpg""></a> 

He still rides around in my purse lo these three and a half years later. He's traveled with us up and down the U.S. coasts (and to Pennsylvania ;)), to Ireland, England, Scotland, Canada and Mexico. His nose was a bit worse for wear for a while until I gave it a trim, but otherwise he's held up beautifully. 

For over a year I was uninspired about the remaining ~400 yards of this yarn, until I had an impulse to knit myself some customized knee socks, my <a href=""http://www.ravelry.com/projects/kirinqueen/lothlorien-stockings"">Lothlorien Stockings</a>.

<a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/82181006@N00/3329813776""><img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3366/3329813776_8e8b55a1fe.jpg""></a>

This was one of my longest-hibernating projects--I finished the second sock fifteen months after starting the first. I made them to fit me, but without enough experience knitting knee socks to know they probably should have been at least an inch longer, and much tighter in the cuffs (and ankle, as you can see in the photo). After an hour or two of wear, they are prone to terrible sagginess. One day I'd like to re-knit these, with more testing and maybe more reverse stockinette in the non-leaf-cable portion.

The last partial ball marinated in the stash for a while, until I decided I needed a hat to go with my <a href=""http://www.ravelry.com/projects/kirinqueen/first-fo-ravenclaw-scarf"">Ravenclaw scarf</a>. The ""Leaves on Lazy Day"" hat pattern met my yardage/gauge/leaf obsession needs. I modified the pattern a bit in <a href=""http://www.ravelry.com/projects/kirinqueen/leaves-on-lazy-day-tam"">my rendition</a> so that the decreases started sooner (I thought it was too floppy as written) and completed the leaves instead of ending in the middle of the leaf pattern. I'm really happy with how this one turned out, and still wear this hat all the time two years later. (OMG, that means I've been meaning to write this post for two years. Laws, how time flies.)

"event","Today, I am 34. On this date in 1995, I started taking insulin to treat the type 1 diabetes I'd been diagnosed with some weeks before. Unlike a lot of diabetics of my acquaintance, I don't know my actual diagnosis date, so I count from my birthday instead. It's a good date to use, anyway, since World Diabetes Day (November 14) falls in the same week, and I can look at it with the same sense of mortality birthdays bring after 30. (""<a href=""http://pbfcomics.com/32/"">Today's my birthday!</a>"") Diaversaries are a celebration of survival, after all.

In a couple of weeks, I'll be providing more blood to Dr. Faustman's <a href=""http://www.faustmanlab.org/"">autoimmunity research</a> at Massachusetts General Hospital. I've become inured to the ""the cure is coming in the next 10 years"" noises people have been making in the 16 since my diagnosis, but I've never personally been involved in a clinical trial before, so it's exciting. In addition to the precious vials of sangre, I give the lab money every so often. Perhaps you'd like to <a href=""http://faustmanlab.org/support/support.html"">do the same</a>.

<ol>
<li>What is so appealing about unicorns? 

They're just as fantastical as horses to someone who didn't grow up around them but desperately wanted to, only with magical powers. Not quite as fierce as dragons, less wild than gryphons.</li>

<li>What is the last book that you read that had a deeply satisfying ending. The sort where you felt it was
 okay for it to end. 

This is tough--most books, half the time I spend talking about them seems to be about how they SHOULD have ended. (Of course, my memory for books is so terrible that I can go back and re-read them over and over before the ending really sinks in, since by the time I've chose to re-read, I've forgotten most of what happened.) Anyway, I think <i>The Last Unicorn</i> had a good ending. The unicorns stay mysterious and free, after all. (Yes, I've actually read that recently. Peter S. Beagle stayed with us during Comic-Con this year (true story), so after he signed my copy, I felt compelled to re-read. It was even better than I remembered.)</li>

<li>Have you considered knitting other purse-like things in the shape of other significant organs? 

I have! Of course the heart purse/pillow is the obvious one (and there's a Knitty pattern for that), but I think a knitted kidney or lung for someone with a particular association with those organs would be fun. One of these days someone will specifically ask for one, and I'll be off.</li>

<li>What is the best thing you have ever gotten out of a Christmas cracker?

My favorite things are always the tiny multi-piece toys that you have to assemble yourself. They don't appear very often, though--I think the last one I remember was a little car that I had to pop the axles into. 
</li>
<li>Why does it always rain on me?

Is it because I lied when I was seventeen?

"event","Hi! 

Time has gotten away from me. It really seemed that one day I was checking in on Livejournal when I had a free moment (""<a href=""http://xkcd.com/303/"">I'm compiling!</a>""), the next I was only finding time fortnightly to peek at the journals of people I (a) know in real life and have gotten email from recently (<lj user=""boffo"">, <lj user=""electricia"">), (b) am subscribed to elsewhere (<lj user=""perich"">), or (c) am just curious what their view of news I follow is (<lj user=""jonquil"">, <lj user=""gfrancie"">). I have been terribly neglectful of everyone and everything else, since November at least.

I still read tons of blogs, but mostly via Bloglines. I have become completely obsessed with knitting--I must be subscribed to 80 knitting-related blogs now. That takes up a lot of my not-at-work reading/watching time.

I have been knitting, too. I'd like to say a post with my latest knits is forthcoming, but yeah, my blog posting suffers even more from my apparently fuller schedule than my blog keep-uppage does. Unless it's microblogging!

Like half the free world, I've mostly been using Twitter to keep up with people--and to share my own stream of inanity, of course. Find me there under the usual handle, <a href=""http://twitter.com/kirinqueen"">kirinqueen</a>.

I've also been using <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/kirinqueen/"">Flickr</a> a bit more regularly, so that I can keep my Ravelry <a href=""http://ravelry.com/projects/kirinqueen"">projects page</a> updated. I'm more of a crafter than a writer or a photographer, it would seem.

If it were, then we could communicate with each other by random throwing there out words ordering no to regard with them. Our Dictionary Evangelist knows this, of course, but I couldn't figure out where else to say this without getting into a side discussion, so here we are.

Another song that I find upbeat sounding as long as I don't pay attention to the lyrics is MGMT's ""<a href=""http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/m/mgmt/time_to_pretend.html"">Time to Pretend</a>"", which is about life as a rockstar on drugs, including the dying of an overdose.

I guess conversely are the songs that sound really unhappy, but whose lyrics are actually joyful, but that's like half the tradtional Irish love songs out there."

"event","So here's something I don't get. What is the deal with Miracle Whip <a href=""http://www.slashfood.com/2005/12/29/miracle-whip-who-eats-this-crap/"">haters</a>? So many people's only response to the words ""Miracle Whip"" are ""IT'S NOTHING LIKE MAYONNAISE, HOW DARE YOU TRY TO TRICK ME?!"" I mean, I agree, it's nothing like mayonnaise, whatever its label claims, but it's easy enough to tell the difference, the same way you can tell the difference between margarine and butter. But I don't hear anyone but serious (non-vegan) cooks say ""WHO the HELL uses MARGARINE?"" And even then, it's only under certain circumstances (like making cakes and cookies).

Full disclosure: I'd mostly use Miracle Whip and mayonnaise interchangeably, but I would never tell anyone that they are interchangeable if they'd only tasted one or the other. Also homemade mayonnaise is like 1000% better than the kind that comes in a jar. And it's pretty easy to make."

Hey linguist friends, did you know that there was a <a href=""http://www.linguistlist.org/issues/2/2-457.html#2"">literary contest</a> that directed competitors to form a story making Chomsky's famous nonsensical sentence ""colorless green ideas sleep furiously"" sensical? This was the winner:

<blockquote>Thus Adam's Eden-plot in far-off time:
Colour-rampant fowers, trees a myriad green;
Helped by God-bless'd wind and temp'rate clime.
The path to primate knowledge unforseen,
He sleeps in peace at eve with Eve.
One apple later, he looks curiously
At the gardens of dichromates, in whom
colourless green ideas sleep furiously
then rage for birth each morning, until doom
Brings rainbows they at last perceive.
-- D. A. H. Byatt</blockquote>

I wonder if there are ""horse raced past the barn fell"" or ""kicked the bucket"" jokes out there, too ..."

"event","Hey look! There's a person under all that knitting! This meme brought to you by the regression I'm waiting to finish running. I got it from <lj user=""blergeatkitty"">.

<i>You know how sometimes people on your friend's list post about stuff going on in their life, and all of a sudden you think ""Wait a minute? Since when are they working THERE? Since when are they dating HIM/HER? since when???"" And then you wonder how you could have missed all that seemingly pretty standard information, but somehow you feel too ashamed to ask for clarification because it seems like info you *should* already know? It happens to all of us sometimes.

Please copy mine below, erase my answers putting yours in their place then post it in your journal! Please elaborate on the questions that would benefit from elaboration! One-Word-Answers seldom help anyone out :)</i>

<lj-cut text=""some general me stuff"">
<ol>
<li>First Name: Erin. I have only had one nickname, Chloe, and only one person ever called me that. </li>

<li> Age: 30</li>

<li> Location: San Diego, California. I moved here five years ago (!!!) to go to grad school, and I don't think I'll ever leave. I love my hometown (Fullerton), but I never learned by living there that I was really a city girl. I really don't like the idea of living somewhere I can't walk to the grocery store. </li>

<li> Occupation: Research linguist. I work for a company that makes software for the medical industry. I actually look at transcribed emergency room reports all day, and that is mostly not as interesting as you might think.</li>

<li> Partner?: I have been married to <lj user=""hober""> for almost three years now. He helped me with Prolog via Emacs five years ago, and now he helps me with the finer points of Python, Emacs, and European history. I'm not sure what I help him with, but he seems to like having me around. I do make him nice handknit socks every so often.</li>

<li> Kids: Not yet. But we're totally having some (relatively) soon, so <lj user=""infopractical""> can teach them cool math games.</li>

<li> Brothers/Sisters: I have three younger sisters. Ted says having us all in the same room is an Experience. Laura is two and a half years younger than me, and keeps me up to date on fashion, my taxes, and the Los Angeles Lakers. (Go Lakers!) Audrey is 15 months younger than Laura, the mother of two certified adorable toddlers, a Wii bowling savant, and a skilled singer of show tunes. Jenn is five years younger than Audrey, and has now ventured the furthest of us four for college (she's at UC Santa Cruz). She kicks my ass at art (seriously) and DDR.</li>

<li> Pets: one of these days we'll have a doggie from some rescue organization or other. In the meantime we'll enjoy our occasional visits with my parents' super-sweet Shih Tzu/spaniel mix, Waffles.</li>

<li> List the 3-5 biggest things going on in your life:

My life is really boring these days. In a good way.

<ol>
<li> Full-time employment. I've been mostly-employed (25-30 hours/week) for a couple of years now, but I finally decided it wasn't worth holding up my professional advancement with my master's thesis, which I am apparently never going to finish. It is a Really Good Thing to have benefits again. We're also getting debt paid off and saving money at an unprecedented rate.</li>
<li>Knitting. This isn't really a ""big thing"" in the sense referred to here, but I'm at it in most of my spare time, and I'm constantly learning new things in doing it. I learn more about design, fibercraft, and color theory every day.</li>
<li>Attempting to keep fit.  I try to spend an hour every other day or so on DDR, which isn't hugely physically challenging yet, but isn't bad for exercise done in the comfort of my home. I tried some yoga moves recently, and I'd like to try that in a class, too. A potential fitness thing is ladies' Gaelic football. I haven't played a team sport since junior high (<s>football</s> soccer) and I think it might be fun. Another potential fitness element is CrossFit, which I've been sold on for a while but am feeling unmotivated to do on my own. This whole not being able to coerce Ted into physical activity thing isn't working well for me.</li>
</ol>
<li>School: I got a B.A. in linguistics from California State University Fullerton in 2000. I lived at home while I went to college, which I think was a good idea cost-wise, but which makes me feel very foolish whenever my friends reminisce about that life particular to four years in a dormitory. I was a commuter at a commuter school, I worked off-campus (except for 5-10 hours a week I worked shelving books in the library), and I only had a few friends in my classes. I very occasionally exchange emails with two of my college friends.

I have finished 90% of an M.A. in computational linguistics at San Diego State University. I tried to live in the dorms, but they don't offer such things to grad students at State. Fortunately I didn't have the same problems making friends in San Diego that I did at CSUF.</li>

<li>Parents: Mom and Mark rule. My mad art skills are composed of some kind of eye for design I inherited from my mother and lots and lots of practice. Mark has exemplified a great attention to detail which I also try to emulate (I'm too impatient to be entirely successful). My parents have been married for almost 23 years now. My mother and father divorced when I was three or four, and my interaction with him over the years has varied along the spectrum between cordial and nonexistent. It's currently at nonexistent. My immediately family convinced me to not invite him to our wedding, and I'm still not entirely sure that was necessary.</li>

<li>Who are some of your closest friends?: I spent more time with Ted than I think is normal for a person to spend with their SO, and it's awesome. He does a good job of being my friend and doing (most of) those other things husbands are ""supposed to"" do. 

I don't see Rebecca as often as I used to, but she'd still be the first person I'd call if I had a Big Scary Problem or a Big Awesome Announcement. She's been good at reminding me that I'm not as dumb as I sometimes convince myself I am. 

Lindsay is my knitting enabler, and Ted's beer-connoisseuring enabler. It's a good combo. We can often be found on my couch or at the pub with knitting and untouched beverages (knitting takes two hands), talking each other through the rough parts of knitting projects, and working out the details of how our pub/yarn shop/used book store/cafe will be run. (It will be in San Diego. Ted will be the bartender when he retires from web development.)</li></ol></lj-cut>"

On our last trip to Seattle, I got a grey ""Mocker"" style Utilikilt, which naturally inspired me to make myself a pair of kilt hose, and this lovely tweedy gray coordinates quite nicely with the kilt. The leaf pattern going up the back of the sock comes from the Harmony Guides Aran stitch dictionary. The rest of the sock is 4x1 ribbing. I'm contemplating something much more design-y than I've ever done, namely, splitting the leaf pattern and making it go sideways around the cuff. We'll see if I can pull it off.<br clear=""all"" />"

I recently lost my external <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/kirinqueen/414694239/"">pancreas</a>, which held all the diabetic supplies I keep on me at all times: a bottle of insulin, vials of unused and used test strips, a glucose meter, batteries for my pump, an infusion set, antiseptic wipes, lancets. Since I knit it on a lark and in a dearth of materials, I'd been meaning for a while to make a new one that looked more pancreas-like. Plus it's an excuse to knit what amounts to a toy, even if its contents are more serious.

So re-inspired by some <a href=""http://www.freshmd.com/fresh_md/2007/12/knitted-anatomy.html"">knitted anatomy</a> images after <a href=""http://sixuntilme.com"">Kerri</a> linked to them a while back, I picked up a skein of a nice buttery yellow 100% cotton yarn, took a look in my Aran stitch dictionary, and got to work.

The new pancreas has approximately the same volume as the old one, but I worked it from the bottom of the fatter end up so that I could run the flap along the long edge. The long flap makes it a little more likely to spill its contents than the old one. I wanted to add a little interior pocket to hold syringes, and I thought that was the best way to do it. It's made with box stitch, which is basically 2x2 seed stitch, and which I thought looked the most like the pancreas in the knitted anatomy. It still doesn't entirely have the right shape, but it is definitely more pancreas-like than Pancreas 1.0. The two buttons on the flap give the pancreas something of a face, which made some friends think it needed a name--of course something beginning with a ""P"". I was originally thinking something like ""Percy"" or ""Panky"", until Game 6 of the Stanley Cup on Wednesday, where I saw the name Pierre and knew that had to be it.

"event","<a href=""http://lollygirl.com/blog/project-spectrum"">Project Spectrum</a> is an effort organized by Lauren Weinhold of <a href=""http://lollygirl.com/blog/"">Lolly Knitting Around</a>, in which a two-month period is assigned a set of colors that you can use as inspiration for crafty projects. This year's (almost-)quarterly colors are grouped according to the classic elements of fire, earth, water, and air. The fire projects of February and March were those made with red, pink, and orange. April and May are the earth months, with green, brown, and metallic colors. I learned about Project Spectrum through <lj user=""zigeunerweisen"">, who has demonstrated great thoughtfulness about her projects and how they relate to the colors of the moment. Thus far, I've worked on projects with no thought toward how they might fit into whatever Project Spectrum color theme is happening. It is a coincidence that my works of this month have aligned with Project Spectrum, but I am happy that they have. (Of course, I am an earth tones kind of person, so the odds are pretty good that I'll have something earthy on the needles at any given time.)

<lj-cut text=""adventures with Project Spectrum 2008"">I've been working on the Fancy Silk Sock from Nancy Bush's <i>Knitting Vintage Socks</i> for over a month now. It's my purse sock, so I tend to only work on it when I'm out of the house. (At-home knitting time has been reserved for less portable projects, like the Silk Corset described below.) The patterns in this book are really made for yarns without much variegation, but most of my sock yarn is pretty strongly variegated, so once I realized this, I knew this yarn would be best for one of these patterns. It's a merino/tencel blend, which I have found to be my favorite kind of sock yarn (so far). It's got a little bit of shine and knits up beautifully. The pattern is not terribly complicated, though I never did get it memorized. It was complex enough that I had a few evenings of ripping back an inch after knitting while drinking. Here's a close-up of the first sock, completed yesterday. I'm about an inch into the second one now.

I did some instant gratification knitting with stash yarn on Thursday and Friday for <lj user=""laruu"">.

The Fibonacci striped hat took a little over an evening to complete. It's made with 100% cotton Elann Sonata, which I love. I did finally experience some of the wrist pain I've seen other knitters complain about when knitting cotton while working on this project, even though I've knit two blankets and several other projects in cotton and never experienced any pain. My wrists feel fine now, at least, a day and a half later. The stripe pattern is from a felted bag pattern, but I winged it on gauge and everything else. Hopefully baby Lucas will get to wear this hat at some point. :)

With a whole nother evening available for baby knitting before the shower, I decided a pair of <a href=""http://www.saartjeknits.nl/"">Saartje's Bootees</a> were just the thing to coordinate with the hat. I had some Alpaca Sox yarn left over from a pair of socks, and it matched so perfectly, I had to do it.

Another project I finished recently just missed the beginning of the earth color period. I made <a href=""http://www.modeknit.com/silk_corset.html"">Annie Modesitt's Silk Corset</a> in an emerald green cotton. I cannot believe how well this project turned out, though I do believe Ms. Modesitt gets most of the credit for this. I just followed her instructions. :)

In fact, no one can come up with a <a href=""http://www.economyprofessor.com/economictheories/arrow-debreu-model.php"">better way</a> to make as many people as wealthy as possible than by allowing them to trade freely with each other.

"event","Today is Type 1 Diabetes Awareness Day. To mark it, I would like to share some facts about this condition and my life with it.

<ul><li> Only about 5% of the people diagnosed with diabetes are type 1. That's around 6.8 million of the 135 million worldwide. Most diabetes-related advertising/journalistic writing is NOT geared toward me.</li>
<li> There is no cure for diabetes. Insulin makes it possible for us survive, but is only a treatment.</li>
<li> The cause of Type 1 diabetes is not an overabundance of sugar in the diet. (Nor is it a direct cause of any other kind of diabetes.)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I was diagnosed when I was almost 18 years old. I mark my diagnosis date with my birthday because I started giving myself insulin shots on my 18th birthday.</li>
<li> I test my blood sugar 6-12 times a day. Test strips cost about $1.35 each, so that's $8.10 a day just to get a very general idea of how I'm responding to my insulin dosage and food intake. Diabetes costs me and my insurance company ~$12 per day, every day.</li>
<li> I have worn an insulin pump for just over two years. I feel it has made my life 100% better.</li>
<li> In order to keep up with my diabetes, I carry my ""<a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/kirinqueen/414694239/"">pancreas</a>"" with me everywhere I go. </li>
<li> The <a href=""http://www.jdrf.org"">JDRF</a> is my organization of choice for fundraising for type 1 diabetes, but their focus is mostly on children with diabetes. I find this very frustrating, as I was barely a child when I was diagnosed, and all those children will still have diabetes when they are adults. What then?</li>

"event","Good: my blood sugar numbers have been stellar lately. My meter tells me my 14-day average is 139, which in the past has corresponded to an A1C of ~6, which is very good. In the past, though, I've had lots of lows bringing that average down, while the last few days my numbers have been consistently in the low 100s. The most recent numbers on my meter right now, reflecting the last 24 hours or so, are 110, 101, 123, 189, 169, 198, 101. The higher numbers reflect my under-bolusing for my lunch yesterday, rather than the mysterious wtf-am-I-so-high-when-I've-been-good numbers I still too often get.

Bad: For the first time in my knitting career, I've lost part of a project. I've finished this sock and have been carrying it around as a reference for its mate, which I've been working on in spare moments at work, when out to dinner, out at the bar at happy hour, and so forth. It's my purse sock, but the knitting pocket in my purse has gotten a little crowded, so I think it was accidentally pulled out when I was reaching for something else and I didn't notice it at the bar. I was really proud of my ripped-and-restarted-three-times picot edge (not pictured, even sadder!). I guess that's what I get for my pride. I can't bear to look at the sock in progress right now, so it's going into the hibernation bin. On the bright side, the first sock was not perfect, but I couldn't bring myself to rip it out and start over again, so now I guess I have a chance to do that with the second sock and make it extra awesome.

This is the first sweater I've ever knit, so I'm sort of in love with it. I learned much making it, and it serves its intended purpose (being the goes-with-everything all-purpose sweater) very well.<br /><br /><lj-cut text=""details""><br />Specs:<br />Pattern: Knitty's <a href=""http://www.knitty.com/ISSUEfall07/PATTroam.html"">Roam</a><br />Yarn: Queensland Collection Cotolino, 60% cotton, 40% linen.<br />Needles: US 7, and US 6 for the three-needle bindoff seaming.<br /><br />The first sleeve served as my swatch, and I got gauge by going up a needle size from the one given in the pattern. This is typical. I don't even bother starting a swatch with the suggested needle size anymore. Sometimes I have to go up two needle sizes.<br /><br />I substituted the cotton-linen yarn for the wool suggested in the pattern because I intended this sweater to get pretty hard wear, which would make machine wash- and dryability a must. Also I figured the wool might make it too warm to wear for much of the ""cool"" weather we get in Southern California, where my blood is thin enough that under 60 F is certainly sweater-worthy. Also this yarn was ~$40 for the 13 skeins I used. Wool would very likely have been quite a bit more.<br /><br />The entire sweater is made with one of my favorite simple-yet-cool-looking stitch patterns, seed stitch. TO do it you k1 p1 all the way across, then purl the knit stitches and knit the purl stitches on successive rows. It would seem I am not one of those knitters who gets bored by miles of the same pair of stitches over and over. This shouldn't really surprise me, as it is not so different from drawing and shading thousands of individual scales or feathers, which I have been <a href=""http://www.elfwood.com/art/s/t/stevensone/ewfallenangel.jpg.html"">known to do</a> from time to time.<br /><br />I seem to be one of the few Ravelers who kept the hood on the pattern. This is not so strange, but to me, it was a selling point of the pattern. I think all upper body outerwear items should have hoods and pockets. This sweater doesn't have pockets, but I think it could be modified to include them. <br /><br />Before I added the applied i-cord that sits beside the zipper, I washed the sweater and let it air dry. I was afraid a tumble in the dryer in its unfinished state would do something horrible to it. I did not take into consideration how much the wash would make the sweater stretch. Cotton and linen have no memory, so they really rely on the application of heat to get sproinged back into shape. After I finally got the zipper in and tried the final-final product on (I'd been wearing it sans zipper for a few days), I was disappointed to find the armholes so much longer and the body of the sweater so much bigger around than they seemed when I'd held the individual pieces up to myself as I finished them. I shrugged and chalked it up to first sweaterness. Last week I gave the sweater its first full wash and dry, and lo! It fit! It's still too big around--I guess in knitting patterns, I'm a small, rather than a medium--but the armholes are the right size and the sleeves aren't all slouchy.<br /><br />I inadvertently made the sweater shorter than the pattern called for, but since it has a bit of sag from being too big around, this is not a problem at all.<br /><br />Firsts on this sweater: applied i-cord, sewing in a zipper. The zipper sewing-in was much less of a trial than I thought it would be. The seam isn't perfect, since it's hand-sewn, but I think you can really only see that if you look at the back side of the zipper. The seaming was technically a first, I guess, since I've never joined five pieces together to make a large garment, but three-needle bindoff was not new to me, so it wasn't really scary.<br /><br />I didn't really make any modifications to the pattern, except for continuing the line of the darts all the way up the hood--I thought it would be interesting. I'm now not thrilled about that, but it's not a huge deal. Hardly anyone sees the hood, or would notice the lines, anyway.<br /><br />So! New sweater! Yay!<br /><br />I have yarn enough for two more sweaters, but I really don't know what either of them will be yet. There are a few possibilities lurking in my queue...</lj-cut><br clear=""all"" />"

"event","I've become a bad blogger. Well, I've been a bad blogger for a while, even though I think about writing up my cooking experiences and everyday linguistic observations all the time. If I were going to have a resolution for this year, it would be to follow through on those blog thoughts. That just seems like setting myself up for disappointment, so I'll just stay unofficially resolute for now. 

And here's what's become my usual bulleted list of stuff from the top of my head today:

<ul><li> I've been meaning to write a ""2007 in socks"" knitting post since late December, but I need to take some flippin' photos of said socks before I do that. I'm pretty much addicted to knitting socks. I made 7 1/2 pairs last year. I've already completed half of two pairs so far this month.</li>
<li> You know what is one of the stupidest things ever? How all the people who want to talk about the Superbowl on the radio (and TV, presumably) have to say ""the big game"" instead of ""Superbowl."" Seriously LAME.</li>
<li> I finally went to the endocrinologist after far too long last week. My A1C was 6.8, up from my last one, but still within an acceptable range. I've been entering my blood sugar numbers and taking notes on my food intake on <a href=""http://www.sugarstats.com"">SugarStats</a>, which is cool because I can output from there to a spreadsheet where I can generate interesting charts and graphs. Not that I've taken the time to do that yet.</li>
<li> I have a low-grade case of the flu: it's not quite enough to keep me from going to work, but I am trying to avoid people so that I'm not propagating the germies.</li>
<li> My commute sucks, but my job is pretty cool. I'm learning a lot about a particular sort of debugging, and the subject material has the occasional overlap with our TV show-on-DVD of the moment, <i>Bones</i>.</li>
<li> I like <i>Bones</i>. It's like a fantasy version of the crime-solving part of <i>Law & Order</i>, except it's not fake science, just prettied-up.</li>

"event","Lilly Belle, the Silky Terrier, joined our family as a fairly young dog in the fall of 1991, the first year we lived in the house on Fox Hills Avenue. She came to us mostly neglected, from a neighbor who had little use for her. She was named after <a href=""http://waltstoytrains.railfan.net/lilly.htm"">a favorite train car</a> of Walt Disney's. She grew up with Jenn, and over the years was always the alpha dog, among Max the Airedale, Barkley the Lhasa Apso, Gizmo the Shih Tzu, and the cats Buster and Pesto. (We didn't have all these pets all at once, and all of them but Max came to us as charity cases, like Lilly.) She protected us from strangers, but had an easy affection with anyone we let into the house.  She quietly laid by you when you were sick or unhappy, and jumped up to lick your hands and face any other time. She never destroyed anything but her favorite toys, though we let her up on the couch and our beds. Only in the last year or two did she show her age, developing eye problems and hearing loss, creeping slowly around the house, so unlike herself that it made you sad to watch her, if you'd known her. I can't remember the last time I saw her wag her tail, even. She was put to sleep this last Saturday. 

Gizmo came to us off the street--literally, trotting down the block, looking mangy but chipper--six, seven, eight? years ago. (I can't remember.) We already had Lilly, Gizmo, and Pesto, so were unsure about taking on another dog, but he completely charmed Mom and Jenn. We named him after the character from <i>Gremlins</i>, because of his cute mogwai face. Lilly tolerated him, snapping occasionally if he pressed her. He taught all the other dogs to beg by standing up like a prairie dog, barking when you didn't respond quickly enough. The first time they took him in, to get him cleaned up and to make sure he wasn't mangy (he wasn't), they said he was about six years old. Mom liked him the best, but I had to stay loyal to Lilly, so was always a little suspicious of him. He never gave me any reason to doubt him, really, but I couldn't help it. Lilly was a better guard dog. As long as he was with us, he had sensitive, itchy skin that had to be treated with prescription medication, lest he chew on it and give himself that mangy look again, and in the last few years he also developed vision problems. He stopped begging in the last couple of years, presumably because he couldn't see, and I think when Barkley went to live with Grandma and Papa, he gave up on trying to be alpha dog--perhaps ironically, since Lilly in her dotage probably wouldn't have cared much. I'd say he didn't seem particularly happy to be alive the last six months or more. He'd given up climbing to the highest spot he could get to on the couch, and he hardly even sought anyone's company. He was put to sleep on Saturday, too.

Enjoy that couch in the sky, doggies. You will be missed."

I wasn't planning to to give a talk, but then I put a tag for ""introduction to computational linguistics and NLP"" under the ""potential talks"" sign. I got more asterisks than any of the others on the wall, so I felt obliged to give it, then. It was by far the most rushed presentation I've ever given, including the one I did on snowclones in June. Of course if there's anything I can present on with no preparation, it's compling. :)</li>
<li>my <b>birthday party</b> went really well, though I missed lots of people, including my sisters! and <lj user=""browascenscion"">, <lj user=""infopractical"">, <lj user=""integreillumine"">, <lj user=""lightling"">, <lj user=""madbard"">,  <lj user=""neoteny"">, <lj user=""theinimitable_l"">.

If I wasn't quite so busy trying to talk to everyone and picking up my tiara off the floor, I would have tried to do a group shot, too, particularly of the awesome folks who showed up without dates. I didn't expect to get so few non-posed photos. I had a bit of a whiskey sour, some champagne, and some random thing Ted brewed up for me, but was never really more than buzzed. I like that. Best of all, there was lots of dancing with <lj user=""scottsch"">. We danced enough that I had to change out of my fancy dress into something cooler about halfway through. Though there were many who didn't stay very late, we didn't end up winding things completely down until 2 am. </li>
<li>Over <b>Thanksgiving</b><sup>2</sup> my sisters and I got hooked on Dance Dance Revolution (or DDR 2 Dance Master or something like that). I've never gotten so much exercise over a holiday weekend. It was awesome. Nephew Andy and niece Autumn were as entertaining as ever. Andy is one of the most obedient two-year-olds I've ever known--which is not to say he's docile. If he doesn't want to eat or take a nap, especially when there are too many distracting aunties around, he won't. He likes to be read to, and he likes to dance, so he was also a big fan of DDR. If only he weren't too short for the game pad. The food was good, too, of course. Next year I get to bring my own dish, woo! I've been looking forward to putting more participation than potato peeling and onion chopping into Thanksgiving for a couple of years now.</li>
<li>This Monday night we went with blogless fellow fan Reed to the final show of <b><a href=""http://travisonline.com"">Travis</a></b>'s tour at the House of Blues downtown. Fantastic.

I'd never seen them live, shamefully, as they've been in my top five bands for five years or more. We bookended the concert with Guinness, Strongbow, and Jameson's at Ted's ""favorite downtown Irish"" bar, <a href=""http://www.yelp.com/biz/zKIg4GhJ7vTMtP2tRokJ1Q"">Stout</a>. [That sounds way more lushie than it actually was. Really. -Ed.] I think I'd call it my ""favorite bar in easy walking distance"", myself. Since they've only been open a few months, and they showed the ALCS and World Series, they've come to know us by name, too.</li>
<li>And of course from my birthday to Tuesday, we got to spend lots of time with our favorite Seattle transplants, <a href=""http://mattbo.com"">Matt</a> and <a href=""http://lindsaydayton.com"">Lindsay</a>. While they weren't out enjoying the local restaurants they've missed and visiting with other friends, they telecommuted on their shiny Macbooks from our couch, so I got lots of opportunities to pester Lindsay with knitting questions and YouTube videos. </li>

"event","The second San Diego Barcamp is this weekend. It's where <lj user=""hober""> and I, plus a bunch of other folks will be. You should come!

Barcamp is a conference where anyone can sign up to speak. It has a techie bent, but really welcomes experts of all stripes. For example, <a href=""http://edward.oconnor.cx/2007/06/BarCamp-San-Diego"">last time</a> I talked about snowclones, <a href=""http://mattbo.com"">Matt</a> talked about ""what the other [camera] buttons do"", and <a href=""http://mokolabs.com"">Patrick</a> talked about coworking. 

This time, <a href=""http://blog.perfectspace.com/"">Nate</a> is planning to talk about ""<a href=""http://twitter.com/sandiegofire"">#sandiegofire</a>, hashtags, <a href=""http://twitter.com"">Twitter</a> and what happened with both mainstream and independent media during the course of the San Diego fires"", Ted is talking about <a href=""http://hober.backpackit.com/pub/1233865"">personal unit testing</a>, and I ... don't have a talk planned yet. I was thinking about talking about the difference between type 1 and type 2 diabetes. I have no idea if that would be of any interest, but that shouldn't stop me. It's all so very laid-back, that if I don't get any takers, I can just wander over to another talk."

"event","Ted and I have discussed hypothetical sons' names before, and had (only somewhat) jokingly settled on Steven Patrick Sarsfield. Steven for my middle/maiden name, Steven Patrick for Morrissey and Patrick Sarsfield for Patrick Sarsfield, a 17th century Irish hero. (Are we geeks? Damn right we are.) But you know who is way cuter and happier than Morrissey? Fran Healy. (He's the one in the beaver costume.)

BTW, no, Rebecca and Lisa, I am not pregnant. This is still a ways in the future."

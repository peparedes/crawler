"event","It's that time of year again! Pull out the powder-blue suit, your top hat, pimp cane, monacle, and anything else that could make you feel sophisticated (while usually having the opposite effect). Get your pumpkin and mice ready to be turned into a horse drawn carriage. Prepare yourself for the night that awaits you at Apparel Mart on October 30... Homecoming. It's coming up folks. Brush up on your dance moves. If necessary, go into your attic, find your great grandfather's trunk of belongings, and pull out a book. This book should be ""Learn to dance in 8 easy lessons"" you know, the one with all the footsteps on them from the 20s. Impress your date with your newfound knowledge of how to do the Charleston, the Jitterbug, the Peabody, the Lindy Hop, the Jive, and the Foxtrot. Trust me, behind the weird looks and the ""you're embarrassing me"" comments, she really is impressed in your abilities to be a swinger, or a ""hopper,"" depending on what dance style you are showcasing at that moment. It may be difficult to Jitterbug when rap is pretty much the only thing played at these dances, but I'm sure you can manage. If it doesn't work, if you are unable to conform to the dance styles of today, and equally unable to foxtrot to 50 Cent, you can always enter into the early stages of Pathological Gambling (a mental disease where gambling overcomes a person) and play blackjack at the availiable tables. Hope to see you all there, I'll be the one in the duct tape suit.

<P>Do you remember those commercials? Where the little kids would be chanting about TCBY while accidentally covering themselves with colorful ice cream? Aahh good times. I must say, TCBY is, in fact, home of the country's best yogurt, in my opinion. Kudos TCBY, way to stay true to your name. *clap* *clap* It is quite a delicious little snack, with the parfaits, the waffle cones, the chocolate tipped waffle cones, the sprinkles, the frozen yogurt, the smoothies... with so many choices a guy could spend his entire life at that place. Sure, by the age of 20 he'd weigh about... 500 pounds... but it would be totally worth it. Its entire little building is so colorful and welcoming... it brings me much joy. When&nbsp;choosing a good ice cream place... there are many variables that must be taken into account. Only about 37% of my desire to go to a certain ice cream parlor&nbsp;comes from&nbsp;the actual quality of ice cream... no... it must also be convenient (13%), have an interesting name (25.8%), provide me with tiny, pink sampling spoons (6.1%), and finally, it must enrich my life with bright colors and childish drawings (18.1%). TCBY (which stands for The Country's Best&nbsp;Yogurt for all who were unaware) has got it all, is there a greater place on the face of this planet? Of course, many in fact... but I&nbsp;still say that everyone&nbsp;should go&nbsp;to TCBY... and bring me with them. </P>
<P>and now I must go wash the rainbow colored ice cream stains out of my clothing&nbsp;<BR>*salutes* <BR>-Caleb&nbsp;</P>"

"event","<P>Caleb here, and yes, I -am- listening to Spice Girls- those talented girls. Ginger Spice, Posh Spice, Baby Spice, Scary Spice, Sporty Spice, I love them all. Well, maybe not Sporty. They are amazing though, with their wonderful lyrics, fascinating dance styles, and moving pictures, they have mesmerized me. Alas, I was a few years too late, seeing as they have split apart. But who could not love with them such amazing lyrics such as ""If you wanna be my lover, you gotta get with my friends"" and ""So tell me what you want, what you really really want."" I'll tell you what I want, what I really really want Spice Girls, for you to settle your differences and join together to produce another cinematic experience such as <STRONG>Spice World</STRONG>. But as it seems, my hopes of <STRONG>Spice World II</STRONG> will never come to be, so I will just have to make my peace with that. *le sigh*</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I think that all of you should go out right now and pick up the latest Spice Girls album... from however long ago that was...</P>

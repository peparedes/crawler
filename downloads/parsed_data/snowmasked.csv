Hey.

Uh.

Have you heard the talk circling around here? When we ran into those refugees earlier, they were talking about Coliya ... I wasn't sure if you'd talked to them. You've been ... weird, since we've left Coliya, and I just didn't want to ask.

But it sounds like it's gone. Like -- <i>gone.</i> Something about Maea. I didn't really hear many details ..."

That was way, way too close.

I -- wish it could have turned out differently. Dragons, none of it should have been like this. If we could have just stopped Sylea's march, or at least gotten things to stall longer at Noye ... And if Lord Henry hadn't died, then -- 

We should have known they would call our bluff. We really, really should have guessed.

So.

What now?

<b>[Filter: Jessica]</b>

We made it out. It was a close call, but -- but, well, we're out. Verity and I found some dragons in the stables and we had to take what we could get. I -- know I don't really need to make excuses to you, but it was the only way they had. They were talking about killing us. Like, we'd probably be swinging from the gallows right <i>now,</i> if we hadn't bolted. They almost <I>caught</i> us.

We're camping out for the night now. We're far enough from Coliya, and I don't think they're going to come after us. I think they're just glad that we're <I>gone.</i> We just have to hope they don't go to anybody about us."

Three years today, and for what.

People keep talking about the rebels like they're brigands, like it's <I>us</i> carrying out these attacks. They hear what we're saying about Forna saving them, but they brush it off because somebody's attacked them under our name. The entire West is going to war.

Keran's still alive.

I shouldn't keep coming back to that, but I do. Keran's still alive. Mera is still gone, and he's still sitting at the crown of the world, watching the entire rest of the country scurry around like ants.

We -- have to put a stop to this soon. Three years, and for <i>what?</i> For a ruin of a country that he's destroyed all on his own? I can't take that. I don't think any of us can take that.

So, Tasha, I figure I'd better quiz you about Timothy, here. Just to make sure you've got everything down. Wouldn't want you slipping up on your story, or anything.

Hey. Just saying hi, again. Oh, and Tasha's actually written recently, I thought you should know. You probably couldn't guess where, though ..."

Hey.

Hey, are you all going to be okay, for the holiday? It's almost ... yeah. It's almost time now. And I just ... thought I'd ask, you know?"

Hey. I don't really have anything important to say, I just wanted to let you know about something.

Jess, Tasha, and Angeline have all been working on this project of theirs where they're going to try and write in public again, with disguised handwriting. They really miss talking to people. I know you talk to them all the time already, but ... yeah, I just thought you should know, I forgot if any of them told you already. If they did, well, forget it, I guess.

I'm thinking of doing something like that, but they've all been working really hard, practicing their handwriting and stuff like that, and I haven't been. I'm starting to feel like I'm rusting, out here ... I'm considering asking Lady Eve for a small guard just so I can go see if I can find Verity. There's been a few more reports of letters like that last one floating around ... Hah, Lady Eve's advisors thought it was directed at them. She was really relieved when I told her what it actually was. I should probably write Verity a letter and let her know to be a bit more direct next time. 

I know none of this is really important or ... anything. I just feel like ... we don't know what's going on with each other anymore, since we can't see each other now. I think that just talking to you about stupid things like my day, or what's going on, will help. If you don't mind, or anything."

Hey, uh, this is going to be kind of a weird question.

Do you remember that letter people were talking about, on the journals a few weeks ago?"

... Ugh.

Every time this day rolls around all I can think about is how things could have been. What happened, way back before all of this ... Back when Colleen and I barely knew each other. Things were so much easier then, I don't know. It was all so different. Maybe it wasn't actually easier, I just ... <i>remember</i> it that way. Things were just.

Ugh.

<b>[Filter: Former Mera and Colleen]</b>

Uh, hey.

Hey, I didn't send out any gifts for anybody. I didn't think it was worth risking it, so if you were expecting ... yeah, I don't think you would have been expecting anything, but I thought I might as well let you know. Happy Festival anyway. I hope all of you are ... doing okay. I'll think of you guys tonight, when we have dinner. I know that doesn't mean much.

Colleen, are you okay?"

Hey, Colleen. Did you see that? I hope you know what I'm talking about, but I guess if you don't I can say, I just hoped you'd seen it. The letter those people were talking about, a few pages ago ..."

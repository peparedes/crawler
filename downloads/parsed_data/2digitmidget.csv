"event","<center><h1>Friends Only.</h1>

<Center>Because I can, and there are particular people that I know personally whom I do not want reading my journal. Excluding this post, my journal is 50% public, and 50% private, 0% public. It's not hard to be added, simply comment on this post.

<center>I don't have to know you from any fancy website or even personally.
Pretty much anyone who comments is welcome on my friends list.

<center>I do a lot of reading, so dispite any number of posts, I read full friends pages quite often, though I do not always comment. I don't expect comments on every one of my posts, but if I've commented in yours, try to return the favor once in a while and I'd appreciate it. And in one last note, SUCK MY JEMIMA. And that is all.

I would have taken it away from her, but she did so much work to get it so I left her alone. I really think she enjoyed it too.I asked her if she liked the sandwich and she replied with an enthusiastic meow. It was honey turkey with american cheese and mayonaise on wheat bread, in case you were wondering."

"event","Through out extensive studies conducted on my own, I have come to the conclusion that america sucks. Maybe not the actual land mass, but the people. Thats not to say all the people, but mainly those from red states such as the 'boot in your ass texans' that I stood behind while checking my luggage for continental flights. 

Now for the good part. I had an absolutely AMAZING (a-m-a-z-i-n-g) time in paris. I absolutely love the city and the whole city life aspect in general. It makes me consider going to school in a city. What I loved about paris was that there were so many different types of people there from all different countries and parts of the world. I suppose you get the same experience in manhattan, but manhattan is not as much fun. 

I will further elaborate and post some pictures on another day but right nwo I am exhausted after a really long (eight hour!!) flight and I would like to go to sleep. By the way, I will be starting a paypal account for donations to send me to europe on my next vacation. I will leave the details and I know all of you fine, generous people will donate."

"event","So I've been listening to 'bye bye miss american pie' and I was curious about the lyrics that go

""And while Lennon(Lenin?) read a book on Marx
the quartet practiced in the park""

And I cannot figure out whether it's supposed to be lennon or lenin. (John lennon, vladimir leninm) I even looked up the lyrics on a bunch of sites and some say lennon and others say lenin. Either would make sense, really. 

And uhh, anyone want to tell me where to go to college? I can't figure it out, so maybe someone else can. At least I have my prom dress, so I've accomplished SOMETHING worthwhile in these past few weeks, right?"

"event","This is the entry where I will describe to you the things that I think sucked in 2005. This is a 2 part series, and later on I will write about the things that did NOT suck in 2005. 

Suckfest '05, Starring:

1. Nicole Richie: She's famous for being friends with Paris Hilton, but doesn't really have any real or valid talent.(just like paris hilton)I hate the fact that she's become famous for being really skinny and walking around LA wearing big sunglasses and drinking lattes or something. Then she became engaged to some obscure dj, and everyone was like 'OMG!'. Then they broke up. Oh well. My point is that Nicole Richie sucks. A lot.

2. Hawthorne Heights/those generic 'screamo' type bands that become oh so popular this year: Hey Hawthorne Heights! Try creating two songs that don't sound exactly alike, or don't suck for that matter. I bet you couldn't do it! That goes for any of those other bands too, like halifax.

3. Scenie boppers: Great, you like hawthorne heights and my chemical romance and from first to last. And you wear a lot of eyeliner and pyramid belts and band t-shirts and your screen name has X's in it. That doesn't make you scene or elite or cool, it just makes you annoying. Get your own sense of style and stop being annoying.

4. Being in high school: Self explanitory and covers a broad spectrum of problems and annoyances. June 2007 can't come soon enough.

5. The Backstreet Boys: why would they get back together? Come on, thats just desperate.

6. Jessica Simpson: she sucks, almost as much as her now ex-husband. Wait, but ashlee simpson sucks more. Hmm. So the simpsons suck in general. Why is the father always talking about jessicas boobs?

7. Laguna Beach: I know this didn't come out in '05, but it was annoying this year anyway. If you watch this show, you probably are a drama queen that is still in high school and this show is exactly like your own life. The girls this season weren't even pretty, they were just richer than you.

8. Ugg Boots: They were 'out' in 2004, so why are people still wearing them in 2005? Oh, and stop tucking your pants into your boots. If you're not sienna miller or kate moss it probably looks bad on you.

9. Popped Collars: Its not 1987 and you're not the captain of the football team,  so don't pop your collar. 

10. Todd: He knows why he's here. 

I could write a lot more, but I'm going to cut this short. My next entry will be much nicer and less full of hatorade. Maybe later I can think of more stuff to add."

"event","Am I a freak for loving airports? Call me eccentric, but I get really excited going to them, even if I'm not actually going anywhere. Like earlier today I dropped my sister off at newark airport. I kind of like the chaos there. Its fun to wonder where everyone is going or why they're going there. Especially at the international terminal, which is where we had to drop elayne off even though she was just going back to VA. (the domestic terminal was too crowded) And there were flights there going to Tokyo and Bejing and Europe. I will go to all of those places one day. It's weird to think that in a little over a month Elayne is going to be LIVING in Paris. And then I will go to visit her in April. Ahhhhhhhhh, I can't wait. It will probably be what gets me though this school year. It is going to be amazing. But she's going to be on an entirely different continent. Weird thought. I can't wait til I can do something like that. 

I just can't wait til I'm done with high school and can have my own life. I feel so stuck where I am now."

"event","Alright this will be my REAL first entry. The other one was just messing with you. I decided to join in on this whole LJ scene because I wanted to enrich my life or something. So all of you friends out there best do that for me. Or random commenters, if I'm privileged enough to get some of those. 2 entries in one night. Wow, I kind of suck. Uhhhhh any questions for me? In case you're wondering, my sign is a leo. And I don't really like long walks on the beach because I get kind of tired. I do however enjoy dinners by candlelight, because everyone looks better in dim lighting. Thats all I have to say for now. Besides that my hands are really cold."

i'll post pics when i can. but for now, i must tell you of my days. 
friday was hilarious. me and my friend jordan were sitting on the bus. (let me explain her story first) jordan goes out with this guy named chris. (both of them are freshman.) jordan's friend lindsay got the names mixed up, and said that jordan was going out with this guy named josh, who is chris' best friend (another freshman.) jordan had never met josh before, so jos just walks up to her and pledges his eternal love to her. so now she has her boyfriend on one side, and josh on the other telling her that he loves her and that he wants to marry her and blowing kisses to her and all this other crazy shit. but he's only joking, as far as we know. so anyway. back to the busride. jordan and i are sitting there. we were talking about chris, b/c it was his birthday and she had gotten him a leash from petco (long story, d/a). so i look over, and there is some guy sitting in he bus next to us looking out the window and yelling JORDAN. so i point him out, and she starts cracking up. ITS JOSH. he's blowing kisses to her, and mouthing 'i love you'. and then chris pops his head up from the seat behind him, and is laughing, and waving. josh has curly blonde hair, me likey. chris has like the coolest natural eyes i've ever seen. their grey-green, and in sharp contrast to his brown hair. anywho. so the buses start pulling out, and chris lowers his head back into the bus doing something we can't see. then he comes back up, and he's wearing a werewolf mask. we start laughing even harder, but i was kind of confused. so i ask her why he has it... apparently, he wears it so that people will flick him off. he's trying to count how many actually do. lol, it was great. i guess you had to be there. (btw, ive never met either of those guys, but jordan might introduce me to them on tuesday.)

on to saturday. went over to mary's GOT MY HAIR CUT. it's the same style, but the back is WAY shorteer then it was before. and the angle of the sides is steeper. i'll get pictures up when i figure out my camera software. wahoo. didn't really do much else, except go to radioshack and the foodstore with my dad and mary. yes.

monday, MERIDETH is coming to see me!!!!!!!!!! she moved to NJ, and i havne't seen her in monthes. she's visting her aunt, and on monday she's picking my up and we're going to go hang out over by kohl's and starbucks and stuff. CAN'T WAIT.

didn't do much else today. got my interims, 3 a's, 2 b's, 1 c, and a D. dammit. its in biology, not MATH. i can't understnad a frigging word Mrs. Cuevas says! she doesn't speak english well. she's nice, but its kind of hard to pay attention when you can't comprehend the teacher's accent.

"event","FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL ROCKED

oh yes.

first of all, kenneth dyed his hair. it is YELLOW. but not like a bad yellow. a good yellow. a good yellow that looks absolutely great on him. =). 

next, this was my day.

---HMRM. i got to spend 45 minutes talking to no one but kenneth! fun. we talked about alot of things. like movies, and soda, and alcohol (thats sort of a joke i dont feel like explaining), and drivers ed, and how he's getting his license in a month. xD. 
---FIRST. Mrs. Lacey is actually really cool. i didnt really think she would be. i only know one person in the class though, but thats okay.
---SECOND. Mrs. Cuevas has a really, REALLY strong Puerto Rican accent, so i can barely understand her.
---THIRD. Senora Jones is nice, but i think she expects to much from our class. she was talking so fast with words i didn't learn last year ALREADY.... argh.
---FOURTH. i've heard alot of good things about Coach Woods and the way he teaches, so i'm actually looking forward to my last year of PE. and im looking forward to Driver's Ed, of course.
---FIFTH. MRS. BONTRAGER NEEDS TO DIE. SHE'S ALMOST AS FUCKING BAD AS MRS. CANAS, GODAMMIT! i'm gonna hate it.
---SIXTH. since Mrs. Bontrager is evil, i get sent to the best teacher ever for my next period class. Mrs. Hornung is definately my new favorite teacher... she's just the coolest. she'll give you candy if she calls you the wrong name, she'll give you candy for getting an answer right in the Foogabaloos (don't ask), she'll even give you candy just because. plus, when she gave us a writing exercise to do, she made it especially hard to concentrate by playing Marvin Gaye.... it was hilarious. the whole class was cracking up pretty much the entire period. she jokes around ALOT. she's just the coolest.
---LUNCH. me, andrea, kaitlyn, bryan, jasmine, jenny. must i say more?
---SEVENTH. Mrs. Wehrle is pretty cool, which goes against everything i thought she would be. apparently she's an awesome teacher and a mean director, but hey. i guess ill just have to see. and guess what! guess who's in my class! KENNETH KAITLYN AMANDA JESSICA CHAD CHRIS MARCUS NATHANIEL CJ and other cool people that are funny. i think we're probably going to do alot of improv this year, which sucks for me. i'm horrible at improv! but yes.



but its now like the third week of school, and me likey. its not so bad after all. but i already have a project due on religion in South America for my World History class next week. I've had two... no three if you count to creative response... english papers i had to do. And i just found out that my grade in Geometry is an astonishing 101.75 A+... the highest grade in the class. i want to shoot myself. im still in shock. but okay. 

must tell you about last night. me, andrea and bryan went to see The Forgotten last night, which was friday. i swear, i don't think ive ever screamed so many times in one movie. bryan was sitting in between us, and andrea and me were holding his hands so tight and screaming so loud im surprised he can still hear. arghhhhh. go watch the movie. its insane, im telling you. scary and creepy dont even begin to describe it. *shudder* i'm still afraid i'm gonna be sucked into the sky.

why is it everytime i go to the lay's campsite, me and jessica always do something bad? is that placed cursed? i think it is. last weekend when i went (i forgot to mention this part before) we 'confiscated' my dad's half-empty bottle of Dr. McGuilicudy's Mentholmint Shcnapps and took a few hits each in her tent before returning it to where it was hidden. just yesterday, we rolled one of her dad's cigarettes and smoked out in the woods. us little troublemakers. good thing we didn't get caught.  it actually wasn't too bad... i've never tried a generic brand name one, but the one we had was the do-it-yourself roll-it-with-fresh-non-chemical-tobacco. eh. haha, me and jessica ate and drank so much stuff right after it so they wouldn't smell our breath. our clothes already smell like smoke b/c both of our dad's do. but we put on some lotion anyway. i'll tell you one thing, i couldn't get the taste out of my mouth or out of my chest till this morning, after about four cups of coffee and a couple of mydol. and btw, jamie, ill never get on your case about smoking occasionally. promise. i think my dad already suspects i do drugs or smoke or something. he's always coming into my room at wierd hours of the day for stupid reasons, or no reason at all, looking around or sniffing the air. i use alot of incense (watermelon!), so he probably thinks im trying to cover up the smell. arrogant, untrusting little bastard. =). its not like he never did pot. he told me he did it in colege, for crying out loud! almost every teenager tries it at one point, unfortunatly. i can't believe he thinks i do it, though.... well, maybe i'm jumping to conclusions. whatever.


nothing else is really new. school starts tmrw, wish me luck.

"event","i have a request to make. from all of you (who read this). i need your help. I need you to make sure i stick by my word this time, and i don't screw up royally like i did last year..... here' goes.

last year, i made some major mistakes. i let emotion cloud my reason; i let minor problems itch at the major ones till they were to big for me to handle, so i put them aside. i didn't look at things from the right angle, and that almost, and still might, cost me my education. i had my priorities all wrong. i focused on having fun and relaxing instead of doing my work, and i got low grades. only one D, mind you, but too many C's and B's. only one A. i can't do that this year. i HAVE to get A's and B's, only one C, or else i could ruin my chances of getting into Mary Washington. collectively, i had a 2.0 GPA last year. even though i was a freshman, and i still have this year and two more to raise it to a 3.0 or a 3.5, a 2.0 just doesn't cut it. i see that now. maybe i should explain the GPA/college thing. my dad works at the University of Mary Washington as a locksmith. even though he's a small part of the work force there, a sort of bonus every employee gets is that their children can attend the University for FREE, but on the condition that that child has a collective GPA of their high school years at a 3.0 or higher (preferrably higher). i don't think anybody understands the effect all this has better then me and my dad. my family CANNOT, under any circumstances, afford to send me or my brother to college. we just can't. not now, nor will we ever. we're in debt up to our eyeballs because of my stupid mother, which is another reason i hate her freakin guts so much, and we'll be in debt till about 2007 if this new credit plan pulls through. if im going to get anywhere in this world, i've got to go to college. im not making the mistake of joining the army like my dad did. im going to college. and the only i can is if i get that GPA! its all one vicious, cannibalistic cycle. if i get in to UMW, then i can: live at home, go to school 3 or 4 days a week, work those other days, and pay my dad about a third of the rent a month (a third of the rent is like 300 dollars). the university only pays for the education, not a dorm room or any of that other stuff. but we can handle that by me living at home. but back to me asking for your help. i need to stick to this, you guys. i need to focus on SCHOOL and not FUN. as boring as that sounds. i mean, i can have a little fun, but i NEED THESE GRADES like you wouldn't believe. hold me to my word, i beg you, or do what you can to prevent from messing my life up. i can't do it by myself. i need people, friends behind me. so please. don't let me screw this up. i can't afford to.

Mrs. Lacey is okay, Mrs. Cuevas i've been warned against (apparently its hard to understand her accent), mrs. Jones is really cool (except when she was talking i could hardly understand her because i haven't used/ listened to spanish all summer), mr. Woods seems cool, Mrs. Bontrager should be okay (i've heard she's easy), Mrs. Hornung reminds me too much of Mrs. Canas but that's okay cause shes is nice and teaches one of my favorite subjects (English!), i love lunch, and Wehrle is evil but i don't care. she was in a good mood today.

what else happened..... oh yessss. my peoples. uh, i saw MIKE. lol, i poked his hand and he grabbed, and he spun me around. then i saw some other people, like EMILY and RACHEL. then i saw SEAN. haha he had a cowboy hat. i don't have any classes with him though =(. but he put his arm around my shoulder in a half-hug, and my dad glared at him. it was great. oh, and KENNETHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH. he's still in my homeroom, and i have drama with him so Wehrle should be bareable. i introduced him to my dad! it was funny. oh yeah, i should probably make this announcement. its been decided. im not going to wait for people to ask me out; im making the first move this time. i just haven't decided who im going to ask. that's sort of a problem, isn't it?

went to jenny's b'day party. that was great. her mom rented a hotel room at the Wingate Inn, and we all spent the night there. me, jenny, jenny's mom lisa, andrea, kaitlyn, jordan, sammy, and jasmine. in one hotel room. we played games, none of whcih i won, but none of which i lost either. we went swimming in the pool, got in the hot tub, ate alot of pizza.... HAHA funny pizza story. me, sammy, and sammy's mom were going downstairs to get the pizza. now, me being stupid = awesome. i was doing karate kicks while running down the hallway, and then this military dude opens up his door. i yelp, and stumble. he thought i was dancing.... so sammy and her mom are cracking up while this guy is just looking at me funny. we go get in the elevator, and he's in there with us, saying, ""go ahead, don't be emabaressed! you can dance! it was funny!"" i felt like a dork. but it was funny. so anyway. we ate alot of cake too. and sat in the hallways a couple of times too. then we spread out all the blankets on the floor and sat in a circle and talked. jen's mom crashed first in the chair (there were two beds, but she claimed the chair.). jordan was next, the jasmine took one of the beds. so jenny, kaitlyn, sammy, me, and andrea are sitting there talking quietly, until andrea and kaitlyn get into an arguement about who's boobs are bigger out of all of us. lol, andrea grabbed jordans boob, while jordan was asleep, and jordan woke up all confused. then she woke up jasmine the same way. andrea discovers my tarot cards, so i do her and kaitlyns tarot. then i discover that kaitlyn has never had coffee before! we made hotel coffee in the bathroom with the confusing little coffee pot. btw, this is at 2 in the morning. so me and kaitlyn and andrea claim the other bed, while jordan and sammy, and jenny take the floor. we wake up at 8. eat breakfast downstairs. i had a bagel, lucky charms, apple juice, a lemon poppyseed muffin, and yogurt. then i stole another yogurt. and i had coffee! witha lot of sugar. my dad picked me up at like 10.

ummm we went camping.... ladedoo. my dad, jessica's dad dave, skip, julius, and justin finished the pavilion. AHHHHH!!!! justin dyed his hair BRIGHT BLUE and its so hot i want to scream. im bringing a disposible camera to the barbeque, no doubt about it. ill get a picture of him one way or another, and i'll show it to you all how hot his hair is. because... its hot. so there.

me and jessica drove alot, too. since neither of us have our permits, we can't go on the roads, but we drove around the farm. its cool. so then on sunday, jessica and elliot came over and we rented movies.
KILL BILL VOL 1! i already saw it. as good as ever
KILL BILL VOL 2! ahahahah everyone watch it. it kicks ass. everyone watch it. do it. i said so.

HIDALGO! ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh sexy viggo+cowboy. and a funny horse. it was great. can't get much better.

monday me and jessica went to walmart. you see, we are special there. we had what is called a five finger discount. 3 pairs of boxers (mr. bubbles - the bubble bath dude, duckies, and moon&stars), 3 ties (pink, purple and red) , 2 shirts (black and pink, both tanktops), and a whole lot of makeup. now i have to come up with a whole bunch of creative lies to explain how i got it all. ughhhhh. itll take a while. im thinking ill ask friends to cover for me and say they were gifts. or old stuff they don't want anymore. idk. anyways. so then that night we went to cracker barrel. i dont like thier cheese. but the meatloaf was good.

yesterday, my friends came over. bryan, aislynn, and andrea. you see, andrea favorite movie is Rocky Horror Picture Show. i've never seen it. and bryan hates it. so she brought ove rthe movie in the Finding Nemo case, which is bryan's favorite movie, and we made him wach the whole thing. it was funny, b/c he's never seen the whole thing. i thought it was good, actually. my favorite char would have to be columbia or frankenfurter. well, both. 

i went to the pool today with aislynn, bryan, and andrea.... we got there, and one by one more people we knew showed up. mandy, evan, adam, tia, kaitlyn, sara, and i think im forgeting someone. but oh well. it was great.... we played marco polo, sharks and minnows, and i played colors with evan and tia. and bryan is super skinny and super tan b/c he went to the bahamas for vacation, and hes going to be in my english class. and evans going to be in my spanish class.

it makes absolutely no sense whatsoever, but it sounds REALLY good when its sung. i mean it! of course you all won't be able to decipher the tune by reading it on the screen, but still. read please.

<lj-cut text=""Footsteps of the Loud and Clear"">

""Footsteps of the Loud and Clear""

insanity sits up on the windowsill
watching time float by on a wooden door with no thought to leave behind
watching the sun rise like and ageless breath of fear
twisted glass like memories
open for everyone to see
spun in her hair three leaves of gold and bloodied faces
a new beginning rings like a secret kept long years ago
paranoid and careless it left you standing there
alone you cry
tears of rain on the fields
lifting life into the meal
broken hearts dance to a very solemn tune
shattered hopes sing along to the mewling of the newborn light
changes made reflect on the universe itself
maybe the changes 
won't last to save the ages
from hysteria
and unreasonable effects...

maybe its not so bad
to be insanity

</lj-cut>

it started out as a completely random poem i was writting, but gave it a tune because i felt like it. actually, i just got done watching 'Evita' on tv and was in a singing mood anyway. of course, i can't sing for shit served on a silver platter, but it doesn't matter. i like the way it sounds.... maybe even with my voice. it doesn't have a chorus, it doesn't have a bridge, it doesn't even have the correct structure to be a song. but i like it.

the days is over! im sad, because it was extremely good.... but they left a lot of things open, so they may bring it back. i hope.

GOING TO THE LAYS TMRW. happiness. we're leaving tommorrow, going to the beach on wednesday, and coming back thursday. HOW FUN. i can't wait, esp. since i haven't seen the lays in forever.i miss them! whaoo. should be great.

ARRRRGGGHHH i had like the best day EVER man! that includes yesterday. im sitting on my floor, 5 o'clock on friday, when my dad comes in.

""You wanna go to Jamie's?""
""Sure.... when?
""Three minutes. Hurry up.""

Then Miss Mary shows up, and (right on que) so does Julie, with both Jason and Buddy.
My house was a mad house. For those few excruciatingly long and loud minutes.

Miss Mary gave me 10 bucks for the mall, and I met up with Jamie and Amanda there. I didn't spend my money BECAUSE I'm trying to save up so my poor ass can go shopping for clothes at Goodwill for the school year. Sorry Jamie. Anywho, we walked around, did pretty much nothing except walk around, talk, read magazines in Books-a-Million, and watch for people to step in the gum. but nobody did. Then Amanda's dad picked us up at like 9, and he didn't know I was coming, so instead of bringing the spacious station wagon he brought the tiny (well not tiny, it's actually HUGE; i use that word in terms of 'room for three people') truck. so amanda sat in the middle, jamie sat on the side, and i sat on jamie. i felt bad because i didn't want to suffocate her or anything. in my drama class we had to do this one act, and my scene required me to sit on a chair, but we weren't aloud to use chairs, just people acting as chairs! so i had to sit on chad, and i was embarressed like hell. i don't like sitting on people because I WEIGH FRIGGING alot. like 170 something. i hate my body. it so.... heavy. and big. and i so did not just get off subject, like twice. we got to amandas house and we went downstairs and listened to music and jamie was online. oh yeah, me and amanda were talking about books and movies and things.... AMANDA needs to read Harry Potter number 4. please. and then 5. because its sad and i now want to murder J. K. Rowling with a pencil sharpener because she's not aloud to do that. i say no more.

went to bed at like 11:30, but i didnt fall asleep for very long because i made the mistake of keeping my hand slightly over the side of the VERY (thats not sarcasm, thats absolute honesty) comfortable Ikea cot i was sleeping on. Amanda's dog Trixie came down and starting licking my fingers, which woke me up, and then persisted to jump on top of my bed by my feet and take up alot of my room... i didn't mind though, i thought it was cute. so i laid awake for like an hour and just petted Trixie, who left after awhile, and then i went in to comtinue helping jamie with her journal HTML stuff. except i didn't really help, i just kind of sat there half-awake saying ""yeah"" and ""that's right"" every so often. =P. yeah, you know im helpful.

finally fell asleep at like 2? 3? maybe. i forget. woke up at nine. Amanda went to visit her boyfriend in rehab. jamie and i THOUGHT we were locked out of her house so we had to go to the storage place with amandas parents (mary and gary! isn't that great? jamie 'speculated' they should have named thier kids lary, terri and jerri.) (thats just how i spell terri and jerri, so deal with it =D) . then we went back to amandas house, and while we were downstairs on the computer, EVERYBODY ELSE just sort of left. so we're stranded. i have my dad coming over to julies house to pick my brother and me up at 6:30, nobody's home, i have no ride, and its 6:30! then mary shows up, we go to mcdonalds (shhh) and then i get dropped off at julies house. turns out jason and jason had been home ALL DAY, they just had the door locked. and buddy was there. they were playing video games. so i changed my clothes, took off my little squiggly eye things cause my dad would flip out if i had em on, and did my hair because i missed my gel. the i went out and tortured the boys with music like NIN, nickelback, and BAD COMPANY mmm yes that was hilarious, watching them squirm! then i went back in the bathrrom to get something i forgot, and somebody comes in the house and says 'jason's dad is here' in a voice i didn't recognize. so i walk out and its KEVIN. lol i haven't seen him in forever.... he CHANGED. for one, his voice got different. hmm that sentence was smart. but his head is still the same shape i noticed that. so then my dad is all glaring at me because im asuming he didnt want me to be there so that he could yell at me when and if i did show up. long sentence. 

we leave.... my dad's an IDIOT like you wouldn't believe! its my fault. thats what he said. its my fault. hmmmm. thats funny. i found a ride, i got there an hour before he did.... whats my fault again? i seem to have forgotton. then he goes on and says im not aloud to do anyhting else for the rest of the summer with any of my friends because i didnt tell him i was going to amandas house. HOW IN THE HELL did i know? i didn't even know! until it happened of course. then i knew. and by the time i got a chance to call, he would probably be on the stupid effing internet anyways. 


THIS WHOLE FIASCO IS JUST ANOTHER CLASSIC EXAMPLE OF WHY I NEED A CELL PHONE. THANK YOU. 

also, the lays AREN'T coming over tommorrow, like my dad promised they were, because he cancelled. he had to work. GODDAMMIT THEY COULD HAVE COME OVER ANYWAYS. dave and sue would watch us till he came home! GODDAMMIT.

not that im pissed off or anything.

arrrrrrrrrrghghhhhh im not in a funny mood like i was when i started writing this. i should go eat something.



okay now i have grapes. and they are good. AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH my brother, though annoying at times, is so adorably cute.

HE's GOING TO ASK OUT A GIRL.
HE'S GOING TO ASK OUT ALEX!!!!!!!!!!!!

"event","hahah. well my dad's off his rampage-ness. kinda. not off it enough to stop calling me names like 'brat' and 'cruel little girl who will never grow up'. just because i scratched my brother. hmmmm. my brother has made attempts on my LIFE, and i have the scars to prove it, yet i'm a cruel little girl that will never grow up.


but on to the lighter aspects of my week....

got back monday from a weekend in new jersey with my grandparents.... always fun! no one else around, but my aunt vanessa and uncle danny stopped by to say hi and leave a spare basketball behind so we could shoot some hoops. 

my mother HAHHAAHAHAHAHAH got caught in her own trap.... thanks to my little bro. a couple of monthes ago, like beginning of june, my mom bought my brother this $40 game he wanted, but 'didn't have the money' to get me a yearbook. so i just recently realized that i cant FIND MY TAROT CARDS and was bumming. but not any more!!!! my bro remembered that little incident and how pissed i was, so he reminded her. she fought it tooth and nail.... hilarious to watch, really.

""well, you don't really need them, do you?"" 
but mom, i miss them desperately, and really, really would like a new set.
""but how much do they cost?""
no more then 30 dollars, mom.... about ten dollars less then that game you bought jason! funny how things work out.... 
""i don't know where to get them!""
bookstores. 

it was GREAT, because she got soooooo frustrated. and jason kept egging her on tho get them for my, until finally she agreed. i love it when parents can't wait to buy stuff for one of their kids but get pissy when they have to buy stuff for the other one..... i love it like i love spicy food.

which i don't love. i think spicy food is cruel to people's taste buds..... like my mom is to ME. haha.

anyways.



yes, so she's bringing them by tmrw, along with the tub of hairgel my brother pestered her to buy for us (she refused when i asked her to get, saying my father should if i need it that much) and the movie stubs for the village she forgot to give us last week.

"event","okay, my weekend was great! and horrible. thursday night i went over to jamie's house... her mom came and picked me up, kind of spur-of-the-moment like. we stayed up pretty late just talking and whatnot.

friday was emily's belated 16th birthday party. at like 6 we went to pick up amanda and drop her off at the mall, then we went to the Natural Grocer to get some stuff. jamie's mom had to give this lady something, so we had to swing by some house... idk. then we went to CVS so jamie could get emily some stuff: a card, a bag with cupcakes on it, some silly string, some gum, and a pack of baseball cards. weehoo! it was like 9 when we finally got to her party. apparently most of her friends who were suppossed to show up didn't, because they were all on vacation, and the only people there when we got there were emily herself, tiffany, and two guys tiffany brought over, jason and daniel. they were playing poker.... they played a couple rounds of it and then we all went on the moonbounce. MOONBOUNCE. i couldn't get my balance for the life of me. i kept falling, and *people* kept falling on me. (coughcoughJAMIEcoughcough.) we played some BS, and then jason and daniel left, so we went inside to watch Old School. I called my dad and told him that i was staying the night over at jamie's house again instead of him picking me up, and he was mad about that. big deal, right? wrong.

after the movie, we all left. jamie and i went to bed kinda late again, and woke up at like 11 on saturday. emily called, so we went over there and played on the moonbounce till like 1 or 2. then we decided to go get something to eat. emily's mom dropped us off at Red Robin, and we had som tortilla things, onion rings, chicken strips, and fries. we shared it all. then we walked over to the mall. fun times...

i can't really remember what we did first, but i know we just walked around and went in stores... we went to planet fun, where we played some video games, and then we sat on the floor and played some card games, like BS and capitalism. we played cards in the food court, and vans too. we went ina couple more stores, like spencers and this clothes store. we tried on some dresses.... lol emily tried on this really slutty white dress thing, that was hilarious. we took a picture... me and jamie tried on some homecoming dresses. the first on i tried was one size too small, but my favorite. it was black and white striped with glittery little stone things all over it. i looked GOOD. the second one fit me, though. it was black with white stripes on the side and back, the sides had this little black laces, and it had stones on the top of it, too. i felt pretty... and thin. which is odd, because im not. jamie insisted that she was too big for a 14, which i totally disagree with, and tried on this really wierd navy blue dress with the ugliest straps ive ever seen. it was definitely a size too big on her.... (i told you, jamie.)

we had some pretzels after that, and then we left. i called my dad, and he was pissed off because he had to come get me, and he didnt know where i was, which was not my fault, by the way. jamie had left a note on the chair that said where we were, and i would have thought that someone would have had the sense to answer the phone when he called and tell him. but i guess not. so now im grounded off the phone, and i got a 'talking-to' about how if i can't tell him where im going then im not going anywhere. but this may work out in my favor.... you see, if i had a cell phone, nothing like that would EVER happen again! =D.

but to make a long story of punishment short, i no longer have a summer of free will. 

as for yesterday, EVERYONE GO SEE THE VILLAGE. EVERYONE. just do what i say, and see it. i swear, m. night shamalan knows what he's doing.... i think thats his best one yet. i sooooo did not expect that ending, nor did i expect practically everything that happened. (to everyone who already has seen it: i practically screamed YOU CAN'T DO THAT TO MY LUCIUS!!!! in that twisted scene with Noah.... but seriously, you just can't do that. its not fair. ((i hope that didn't give anything away...)) ) yes, so all of you go see it. best movie this year, i think. besides HP.

that is all.

"event","HAHAH guess what?! i just found a bunch of old journal entries that i never posted but wanted to...well not a bunch. just two. =P.  here. you look.





written at 6:00 pm July 10:

to be honest, i don't know why i bother anymore.
my dad gives us money obviously. i have no other way of recieveing funds. he gave us money for kings dominion. he gave me money for the movies. he gave me money to go to hershey park. and he just NOW decides to tell me that it was MY money... the whole thirty dollars i had left over from the 75 i had from our trip across the US?!

collectively, my brother and i had ninety to spend at KD. 90 dollars.

he gave me 10 for the movies. 10 dollars.

he gave me thirty dollars for hershey park. 30 dollars.

90+10+30.

that's a total of 130 dollars. considering i had only 30 dollars saved up, i apparently owe him 100 dollars in back pay. 100 dollars that i DONT have, 100 dollars that I will NEVER have, 100 dollars that I HAVE NO WAY OF GETTING. aside from staying home for the rest of the entire summer and doing chores. that seems to me to be the only possibility. 

now, when he gave me the money each time, i thought he was doing it so we could have fun. when me and my bro got the money for KD, i was under the assumption that we got it so we could HAVE FUN. when i got the money for the movies, i was under the assumption that he actually cared that it might have been the last time i would ever see my friend, because she's moving at the end of july to new jersey. when i got the money for Hershey Park, i was under the assumption that i got it because i had slaved over cleaning up my room for about 4 hours, and that i had earned it. well, i was OBVIOUSLY wrong.

so now he probably thinks we have to work to pay him back. but i have something else up my sleeves... if he thinks that doing our chores is going to be our payment; wait a second. haven't we been doing our chores for 2 years straight and running? and that we haven't ever seen a dime of it? if our chores constitute our payment, then can we have everythinghe owes us from june of 2002 till now? that's quite a bit of money. it should already cover this 100 dollars... plus some. 

i'll just throw that arguement up in his face... the bastard won't know what hit him.

written at 8:19 pm July 10:

that insolent, self absorbed, little IDIOT!!!

i can't beleive him! i can't believe the nerve of that man...ugh i can hardly think straight.

we're sitting there, watching princess of theives on abc, and keira knightly, who plays the apparent princess whose name i dont remember, says something stupid. so what does my dad do? he says, ""that selfish, childish, little... child."" i assumed he was joking, so i say, ""of course a child is childish. isn't that what they are supposed to be?"" and then this comes out: "" she's selfish... childish... stubborn..."" and then slowly turns his gaze from the tele to glare at me. BASTARD. goddamnit, i hope he sees this. i want him to know what a palehearted, yellowbellied, snivelling CREEP he is!




oh, that is RICH.
here's more:



HELLO.

god damn im bored. went to a locksmith convention with my dad, brother, and some family friends. the only cool part was the free stuff. i got a sailboat but it fell apart.

my dad's a dumbass. he put me on restriction because i didn't FOLD THE FUCKING LAUNDRY. how stupid is that? he claims i didnt do the laundry right.... i didn't even know there was a wrong way to do it. you put some clothes in the washer, you add some soap, you turn it on the right setting, you let it run. when its done you put half of it in the dryer and let it run for an hour, then do the other half. is that really sooooo hard? he says im ignorant and stupid, and im never going to get anywhere.... all because i didnt fold the laundry right after it got out of the dryer. big whoop. i asked my brother to fold it while i went to go clean the kitchen. but does my dad really care? no. he calls it ' pawning my work off on other people so that i can be lazy and sit on my ass all day. ' first of all, i'm the only one in this stupid fucking house who does a damn bit of work. im the only one who cleans, the only one who does laundry, and the only one that takes showers six days out of seven. i'm clean, they aren't. and yet they have the nerve to say that i'm not going to get anywhere in life? and as for pawning my work off on others so i can be LAZY..... while i work and clean and all that good shit, my dad and my brother sit around on THEIR asses in their UNDERWEAR playing videogames and making a mess out of the kitchen that I end up having to clean. i feel like a fucking maid or a housewife, for christ's sake. im 15. FIFTEEN, and im already more mature then that pair will EVER be. yet he says IM ignorant, and stupid.

and get a load out of this. according to my father, i'm only aloud to go to mary washington college, because that is where he works and i can get in for free. and i am also not aloud to pursue a career in acting, because its not worth HIS time and i wont get anywhere doing it. and because he says so. and never once has he given me compliment because i passed a monolgue test in my drama class, or patted my back when i got that part in the play. the only compliment he did ever give me was the night of the play.... he said i did good. pfft. he probably only siad that because my drama teacher was standing right there and he wanted to look like a supportive parent.

can you say, ""crushing someone's dreams""?

i'm not aloud to do what i want to do because it wont bring in money. MONEY. i can understand that he's worried about money, seeing's how we have less then a dollar to our name and all, but you dont just tell a 15-year-old girl that she can't do something because YOU SAY SO. so, mary washington college doesnt have a major in acting. what if i get a scholarship? what if i can get into an acting school FOR FREE because my grades are high and i have 'potential'? i bet you everything i own that he'll refuse to let me go, or say something against it.

he thinks its all about the movies. that every actor or actress out there is competing to get an agent and waste their time trying to get a big name role in some indie film, or even act along-side celebrities. that's not what its all about. not at all. what my dad doesn't see is that every actor, even celebrities, they have to start small. its called PLAYS. i wouldnt even try to make it big, and move to hollywood and spend all my money on some highpriced apartment infested with rats while i try to sneak my way into a bigshot audition that im going to end up failing anyway. I WANT PLAYS. plays. not movies, at least not until ive had enough experience and i wont make a big idiot of myself. everyone has to start small.

and im not going to let that controlling, power hungry, twisted little bastard tell me what i can and cannot do. i'll make my dreams come true on my own terms. i dont need his pessimism, telling me its a waste of time, that i need to take a major in something i dont even like. yes, i will get a degree in something else, not just acting. maybe archaeology, or enviornmental studies. but i will do what i want. im going to act.

so there.





LMAO.
that i wrote last night, but never got around to posting. he IS a dumbass. god, i feel so.... RIGHTEOUS when i read that. ""i'll make my dreams come true..."" damn. i dont know where that came from. i was sooooo angry and upset when i wrote all that. lol.... its great.

what's new...... hmmm. nothing really. i'm still pissed off at the dipshit, so i have no updates.

i wanted jamie to come over to my dad's work this week, but that now looks impossible and im bummed. the college is a great place, and we have HIGH SPEED DSL INTERNET THER INSTEAD OF THIS CRAPPY DIAL UP AT MY HOUSE. but that's not the only reason its cool.... switching cylinders on the doors and visting all the different halls is perty neat, as dorky as it sounds. the reasons she can't is because on i have to stay home all week and take care of my brother, who is sick, and then on friday we are all meeting family friends, the lays, over at a locksmith convention in baltimore and its super important we see them b/c we haven't seen them since may. and my dad has to go to the convention anyway b/c he is a locksmith. but yes, im bumming. maybe next week.

"event","i went to king's dominion last week... had a blast with my friend jamie. she had never been on a roller coaster before. that changed. 
let's see... what did we go on? berserker, white water canyon, log flume, grizzly, hurler, ricochete, rebel yell, and shockwave. that's pretty much all the big ones, but we did a couple tiny-er ones too. we went 'shopping'... i bought some candy, couple rings, some hello kitty stuff, and a necklace. some other junk too, wasn't paying attention to what i was buying. =P. i actually picked up this thing, in which i thought was lip gloss. its not. in fact, i dont know what the hell it is. the caution sticker says...: ""Caution (big surprise there.) : do not use near eye or lip areas."" so its definitely not lip gloss. its not nail polish, and i dont know what else it could be... there isnt any label on it, and there's no directions for it either. so im lost. what else is new? leave a comment if you have any 'suggestions' on what my mystery item is.

in other news, i got back from a three day trip to pennsylvania with my friend merideth.... let me tell you the tales of my adventure! wee hoo.

day one: monday july 4
                 merideth and her family picked me up at five and we went to the driving range... i can't hit a golf ball worth a sack of potatoes. after that, we went to Cici's Pizza for dinner *yummm*, and went back to her house for fireworks. watched Back to the Future pt. 1, which i have never seen before, and went to bed.

day two: tuesday july 5
                 me, merideth, her mom and little brother mitchell all got up at 8... merideth had a dentist's appointment at 9 we had to go to before we could hit the road. got that done and over with, then headed to their Aunt Renee's house to pick her up. picked up some Wendy's and headed straight to PA after that. 
                 got there around 12:30. the whole point of the trip was Hershey Park!!! yumm. chocolate. anyways, we went into the park and hit some roller coasters.... sooperdooperlooper and great bear were the best two. i took mitchell down the water slides, because mitchell's only about 8 and couldn't go by himself. went on the white water rapids.... i have to admit, the ones at KD are are cool, but these are better. only because instead of praying to get hit by some water at KD, there is no way you won't get wet on these... they have waterfalls you HAVE to go under to get to the end of the ride, so you get completely soaked. weehoo.
                 went on a log flume sort of thing next, which was pretty neat, then me and merideth went on the Tidal Force, which is by far the best ride i have EVER been on in my entire 15 year old life. you get in this big boat, an you go down this big hill, and when you hit the water.... it creates this massive wave  that drenches you. and when i say massive, i mean its bigger then any i've ever seen before in my life. aside from the ones in day after tommorrow. plus, after the ride, there is this bridge you can stand on that allows you to get hit by the wave. it felt really good.
                 got in line for this one ride in which i forget the name of. you get in the seat, and you're hanging there. you have this little lever to pull, and you can drop water on the people below you... plus you get wet in the process. but the line was really long, and it was abiout 9:00 at night, and after the ride we were half frozen. so lisa, merideth's mom, bought us all sweatshirts. i bought myself some flipflops, because my shoes were throughly drenched and were irritating my feet so much i wanted to scream; but once we got warm and semi-dry and ate something, we felt a little bit better. had some dippin' dots, and saw this amazingly cool laser show at 10. left at like 11, after buying alot of chocolate, and stayed at Comfort Inn where merideth's mom had made reservations for the night.
                 i swear... i have never, EVER felt so comfortable, nor have i ever needed that rest like i did that night. none of us felt like moving. so after a hot shower and a 7 hour sleep, we all felt a little better. plus i stole the soap, and two tea packets.

day three: wednesday july 6
                 got up at eight, had some breakfast at the little restaurant in the hotel, and left at 9. took Renee home, and got back to merideth's at about 12:45. got my stuff that i had left there, and they took me home at 1.

that was my adventure. it is now thursday, and i dont want to do anything for another week. because my feet still hurt."

"event","What the hell is going on??? I mean, I get a letter from somewhere the day after it says i have to attend a damn interview.  WTF?!?!?! I took my cat to the groomers shes getting the cutest little lion haircut ever! I have to pick my sister up from school, i guess whenever she calls. So yeah, on another note, everything has gotten worse, anger, depression, everything. I had this horrible breakdown the other day and i almost lost cliff because of it. im just sick of trying hard just to fail. no matter what i do, i worked friday night, okay, a FRIDAY NIGHT, yes i had a choice to work, but i need money as much as possible. I worked from 4:00 pm to what was supposed to be 12:00 midnight, but turned into 2:30 in the morning, cliff had to work saturday but he was my ride home, i only got $55.  How much bullshit is that?  Then, i keep feeling so bad about my damn car, when i had my breakdown the other day, i kicked in my wiondshield a lil bit more, not like it didnt need to be fixed anyways, but still i shouldnt have!  I LOVE THAT DAMN CAR!! We think we found out whats wrong with it, in the front end i mean, my tire is on an angle and now when i turn the wheel, the passanger wheel doesnt even move! I know im going to have to do something with that interior too. Its just too depressing to think about, Everytime i see that car, I remember the accident all over again, but I guess thats better than being dead...right? Everything just bums me out anymore, I try so hard to be happy, but its like I never really am, I may smile and act like it, but inside it seems as if nothing truly makes me happy, I know Cliff makes me happy, He could have easily given up on me, I did. But he DIDNT and he ISNT going to. Yeah whoever has something to say about that considering the mood i am in, Keep it to your damn selves. Anyways, I think im done babbling. Bye."

"event","So, this sucks. Ive been out of a car since December 12th......Yes dumbass me got into an accident....Well, kind of...I got all the way over on Mound when the freeway merges and got all the way right there was a semi next to me  i did NOT see a blinker or him starting to get over so i tried to go past him (yes i was going about 55-60 in a 45) but out of nowhere i see the front of his truck starting to get over, i was thinking WTF?!?! i was almost past him, but then i just tried slowing down letting my foot off of the gas (didnt hit my brakes because the freeway people were flying behind me. Surely one of them woulda hit me. Anyways, next thing i know im going up a curb so i wouldnt be pulled under the semi,I do only have a Grand Prix!!!!! I hit 2 stop signs and i got a 2for a no right turn and wrong way lol yeah funny now. Anyways, So the police impounded my car (I HAVE NO INSURANCE!) and i got a ticket for that. They took me to the hospital because i fainted, i was just overwhelmed. But anyways Medicaid doesnt cover car accidents so i got my bill for the ambulance ride (516.00) for 3 miles but they had me in a neck brace strapped to a board all that crap and an IV. Well anyways at the hospital they did about 24 x-rays and 2 catscans, thats gonna be a nice bill!!! I was so fucking terrified, i thought i was gonna die until i finally came to a stop when i hit the guard rail. so now im in the process of repairing my car.....I got a new front bumper cover, yay!!! 2 new front tires.  my rim is fine, but i wouldnt bitch i i had a chance to get a new one.  now all i need is my roof popped out and a new windshield. well but we just found a new problem in my front end. when you turn the wheel, my whole front end dips down. and my brakes suck...well, fronts. Anyways that ticket is a hefty fine, but its 0 points and wount be on my record since noone else was involved, but when my car is fixed, i am not going to drive my baby without it again. but now i have all these repairs and the ticket to pay (im waiting for my court date) but so much money...212.00 down for ins then 111.00 a month, 185.00 for the ticket, and 165.00 for a new windshield.   HAHAH  thats a cheap price for a windshield, for them to come to my house and do it and replace the molding, which was shit anyways.  but the better my car looks the better i will feel.  we found another grand prix for 50.00 we could use to part it for my car. i need a new trunk ( i dont like the single red racing stripe lol) a new hood would be fine the paint was peeling anyways. then hopefully everything will work out perfectly........but thats still only a hope....me and cliff are doing great, better than ever, I love him so much he has done so much to make me feel better about the accident. Hes my world :)"

"event","So yeah Yesterday was the greatest day ever!!!!! My baby got my car all legal for me :) I love him so much, not cause he does things like that for me, but because hes constantly thinking about me and making me happy and for that hes my baby :) He took it to work today though hes gotta get it put on the diagnostic machine at some shop so we can fix it together...i know it needs 2 tires, front brake pads, an instrument cluster (the main one) and now whatevers wrong under the hood...I know I need an alternator. but anyways it was a 200.00 car and it runs, cant bitch about it. That and its my first car and cliff has done all of this for me. I LOVE YOU SO MUCH HUNNI!! Yesterday he replaced my Turn Signal Switch..that steering wheel just did NOT wanna come off to save its life...its all good though now the blinkers work and it doesnt smoke or spark from the steering column anymore. lol although, it was kinda funny hehe..ok anyways i have to call around and get quotes on an alt. If anyone besides my sisters reads this, IF YOU WANT A CAT CALL ME HE IS A WHITE MALE 2 YEARS 2 MONTHS AND 9 DAYS OLD HE IS NEUTERED ALREADY, HES A GREAT CAT, HE MAKES FUNNY NOISES WHEN HE PLAYS (1 IS A BURNIE (LIKEA CAR LOL) AND THE OTHER IS KINDA CREEPY (A LITTLE GIRL GIGGLING, WHEN HE RUNS)..Something i have to get off of my chest, My sisters leaving for AZ on the 27th, I know we havent been the closest, but Im going to miss her like hell.  :(  but i know her new hubby needs her more than I do..Anyways hes a great guy, He should be considered Lucky...be back later....kristina"

"event","Ok, So alot of crap has been on my mind...Why do people find it necessary to stab ""friends"" in the back?? I've been thinking alot about that kinda stuff and I came to the conclusion there is no such thing as a friend you have your acquaintances until they get promoted to being like a sister or a brother. Another thing why do people say they know they have a leash (cell phone ect) and still stay with the person that is holding the handle?? How can anyone be with someone like that?? Isnt the point of a relationship to be happy and have honesty, loyalty, and TRUST?? I just hate seeing people and hearing them say how their leash is getting shorter (different phrasing) and then thats all and say that their relationhsip is doing ""good""?? That bothers me to the point of insanity! Everyone says im so blunt and crap, but why can I not say this to them probably cause ive stirred up enough hell for them :) I dont mind him hes a good guy, but its her who needs a reality check...can u say psycho??? People like that just bother me and I do not know why I cant just speak up about this, like I do everything else??? Anyways, on another note, me and Cliff are doing great!!We havent even argued in like 2-3 weeks!!Im thinking the same thing you are...but it is so not a bad thing we have been soo happy and I cant wait for all this crap to go down the drain that way we won't have anything on our minds, not like its a bad thing or anything..Anyways, Ill update later this is getting to the point of extinction if I write anymore....

"event","Here's a fun fact......I'm an insomniac....not every night, but tonight I swear I am. Well lets see here...Not much happened on Sunday except someone came back and we went by my parents then came home and cleaned the hell out of this place, then while that was happening my cell phone rang, i didnt hear it, but cliff did next thing you know I have a voicemail...I listen to it...Its my cousin she's having guy problems again , but this time its all because of a dirty cunt me and cliff had warned he about in the first place her name is HEATHER...a.k.a Moo Cow...shes nasty, talks shit to make ""badder friends"" and is just obnoxious and never shuts up. Oh and did I mention she got fucked in the ass then claimed she got preggo from that?  ewwie, yeah! But anyways tonight coulda been better, but I dont care, im here to listen, not necessarily get involved...I love her to death, but she needs to understand that not everyone is who you want them to be that may suck, but it happens.  Anywho, Me and Cliff are doing great, I am loving it!! Its so weird I was the last person to expect Id be in a serious relationship, but its ok im sooooooo grateful that it happened, that we met and started a relationship....I dont remember life without him...hes all i care about (well besides family, but its a different kind of love....Its weird I got diagnosed as bi-polar when I was 9, but around my 18th b-day I went to get re-evaluated and turns out im not....9 friggin years...so many meds and 3 institutionalizations! OMG!!! but they say i have ADHD, PostTraumatic Stress Disorder, Dysthymia, and Borderline Personality Disorder! WTF IS THAT?!?!?! WHAT KIND OF 18 YEAR OLD HAS THAT CRAP?!?!?! Anyways the cunt I went to see for my mental crap put it down as i was bulimic....she told me she wouldnt do that, IM NOT, LADY!!! She thinks because of how small I am that I have something like that, sooo not true...I LIKE KEEPING MY FOOD DOWN!  Wow this was a longer post than i thought.....Anyways IMa go lay down next to my baby...NIGHT NIGHT!!!

"event","So lets see here....Lets start with Friday...I finally got my title to my car..YAY! I have been waiting since the last payment and I finally got it now all I need is insurace and new plates and tabs and that stuff...But as for the car itself it has its issues...Cliff helped me do the muffler, the dogbones, the spark plugs and painetd my hood now its all almost white!  As for the interior i mainly need a backseat cover, a new digital cluster panel, and i nees the wires in the steering column for my blinkers fixed. It can't be healthy when you put the blinkers on the car fills with smoke...Then let's see I didnt work at all last week, that killed me...then Monday i had a dentist appointment for the dentist to finish my root canal. So today im pretty sore, but anyways on the way home from the dentist we got to the driveway of the apartment complex and what else should happen?? woop woop...go figure he got pulled over...the officer said that he was doing 56 in a 40, but he only wrote the ticket for 45.  The funny part about that is.how can he be going 56 when there was a bunch of traffic and the lady he was stuck behinfd was going 5 under???!!!  Thats fucked up...Anywasy didnt do much this weekend, we went to canada and thats about it.  Oh well. Cliffs so happy now cause he cheered himself up yesterday by getting XM radio..hews happy...im happy. What else should ahppen today, except I GET MY DAMN PERIOD?  aint that about a bitch?? Ok enough typing for me right now..Ill write later.  Buh-Bye!"

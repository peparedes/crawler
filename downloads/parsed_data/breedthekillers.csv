"event","Okay so I went to Target today and spent 60 dollars of my own. I got four awesome shirts a skirt and a pair of shorts. I don't like shopping that much because I hate spending money but I am running out of clothes that aren't ripped stained or have holes in them.I have a suprise but I can't tell anyone. 

After I wrote this I realized I am a brat so I am coming back to type in more. One reason I came back to Live Journal is because I think Myspace is very over rated. Another reason is because it is less dangerous [that one is for my Mom because she was watching Dr. Phil and they told how many people got raped because of myspace. Though I explained that it is not myspaces fault but the people who are on it because they give away their age, adress, phone, # and more they also meet people online which is so very stupid."

"event","Well I have not posted anything in a while everything is going to change from  now on Jeff ran out and Cassie ran away but of course they left a huge finally. Also I got a part in the play a Mid-summers night dream [by Willam S. for all you mental challenged people out there} I keep on getting depressed for no reasons and not really caring about anything. Though it does help to type it all down it sorta helps because I lost my journal and this is also more efficent. I am sorry if i have ""grammar/spelling errors"" I have to admit I am not all that good with puncuation and spelling correctly. Well anyway I think of the reasons I might get depressed. I mean being past all material possesions is depressing because you have no...distractions. Really thats all music and telivison, music and computers. Though I might as well leave my print on this earth and I don't like watching or reading people do that.

              Well thats all for today [love to most known and unknown]

"event","Odly I am not excited for christmas at all this year. Well we got our progress report and I got all A's exept a B+. Berkley and Muffin were put to sleep and everyone seems to be ignoring it execpt me. The whole story is well Berkley attacked Muffin on Thursday and had to stay at the vet we were all mad at Berkley I even kicked her because the vet said Muffin might not last the night. The next day I got home and found out my beautiful German Shepard who was only one and had no problems was put down. And the way I had said goodbye to her was kicking her. It was my Moms and Jeffs decision to put her to sleep so they can rot in hell for all I care [sorry I am just expressing how I feel] Then it turns out muffin lived we took her home on saterday. Though she was still very sick. We did not want her to go outside or die alone so we got her a heating blanket on the love seat. But she kept trying to walk away. Sh we put her in Berkleys old cage [whick is preety big} I made all these layers of blankets so she would be comfterble. Later she would not eat so my Mom and I had to force feed her. I had to come in every ten minutes and clean her eye. I also brought her fresh water and brushed her hair. We stayed up til 4 in morning watching this program on how cats used to be gods to ancient Egyptians. Though we did this on sunday and saterday but I hate force feeding her. But she was not cooped up in the cage for the whole time we played with strings. ON monday I stayed home because I was ""sick"" and watched muffin. My mom took her to the vet that day and said she had puss coming for her mouth and had a broken bone and they had to put her to sleep."

I mean if the world just happens to combust or summat NO ONE is going to be rembered not any scrap of material. THIS is probabally not even going to be rembered by MYSELF. Though while we ARE alive we don't do anything some take stupid risks some don't take risks at all. Though what is a risk...realy? Then we trouble ourselves with meaning less triffles like ""omg anyone who listens to fall out boy is a poser"" who fall out boy is not gong too be rembered! Though if it is hopless to be rembered then the point of life has to be...just to live and smile!?"

WOW i have not updated in like a MONTH. {recap on month[s]:} Went up to brittnay's cottage pretty rad people next door. There is this one kid named cutler who brittnay thinks I like...Yeah RiGHT! Wedid karyoke to Billy Idol's dancing with myself and I SUCKED I should just stick to opera. Got a new myspace name. Did a whole bunch of bike rides by the river. Erica, Brandon, Stephanie, cassie, and Angie came up to our cottage. We did donuts behind the speed boat [scary] and for some odd reason I screamed the oscar Myer weiner song at the top of my lungs. Getting into Razorlight. Bought the new Kings of leon Cd, and our school starts in 8 days! Staying at a hotel with Erica and her family because their getting their house re-done. Went bowling with my little sister and brandon. Woodward dream cruise was a few days ago. ERICAS B-DAY WAS YESTERDAY, we went  to home depot and hid in fridges and made farting sounds behind peoples buts it was HILLAROUS and poped out of fridges in front of people haha very funny. Erica and I are now equals because she got yelled at and asian dude[nothing wrong with asians or anything].But we are egual because this asian woman screamed ""you to big"" when we were in the laundry mat. Complicated. Got new pantsss from TARGET because I forgot to pack pantss. Went to the 'green lantern' Ericas birthday to make the pizza it took an half hour then it was then wrong pizza green olives and onions [ewwww] then we had to wait another 20 minutes for another pizza, then later that day I forgot my purse\backpack with all my cds my cd player, make up, and money. And the whole family had to drive back to check for it. Then on the ride back we groved out to dancing queen...lame but totally awesome. 


And thats most of the month but when i rember somthing else I will add it

"event","last night i  went to Sarahs and spent the night and just hung out and talked and watched May. It was so fucked up but cool. We were laughing the whole movie. then earlier today I went to a car wash with Sarah that she was having to raise money for her trip to Australia for the field trip. Traca showed up and we stayed from 10:00 to 5:00. She raised about $500. It was pretty cool we talked and messed around a lot. Then these two guys came by on skateboards and wal-mart. They were fucking HOT! When they came back out and came up to us and started talking so then we talked for a little while. When they left we started spraying them with our hoses lol it was priceless. Anyways I'm realy glad Traca showed up before I barley knew her and now were pretty close she is really awesome.

"event","sorry for not updating. I am finaly ungrounded though. My parents are still pissed though because progress reports came out yesterday and I got 2 D's and they were mailed home. 

Any ways I am going skating with Drew on Sarurday. fun. And the 8th graders are gone till next monday on the D.C. trip. Meaning we have the school to ourselves. I already miss stalking Zach. But I finaly saved up a decent amount of money so me and Emily are hitting up Easton sometime soon too. There was a new girl at school today. She was kind of strange. I dunno about her yet though.

[x]the major i decided to go friends only is because some people at out school have nothing better to do then spread around rumors and lies. recently they were printing out livejournals and passing them around (including mine)

[x]plus i like to feel important XD

After all shouldn't I be one of those famous 
bloggers that everyone talks about. You know..
on some political show they will say ""Well 
Bloggers today are saying......"" 

Shouldn't that be me? 

""Why yes John. good point about Bush and the Stem Cell 
situation. I know that is a hot topic with Bloggers now. In 
fact one blogger was recently writing about .. about...
uh... her eyebrows and her new glasses...."" 

Hmm.. I guess I am not there yet.&nbsp; Maybe I could 
write great movie reviews...... hmmm nope, don't 
see enough movies on a regular basis.. 

Maybe I could write about TV shows... well yeah, 
I have about 13 emails lists that I do enough of that one. 

Well hell.... I bet the world is dying to here the day to day 
activities of Malcolm, Ally-bob and Teva. In fact Teva is 
crying and looking at herself in the mirror. Apparently she 
has self-esteem issues.... I know alot about that."

"event","Picked up my first pair of the new glasses today. Bifocals. Fucking weird. <br />It seems the only way to see my computer screen here at home is to tilt my <br />head slightly to the left. I am foreseeing many stiff necks in my future. <br />I like these frames more than I did, now that I have them. These were doing <br />to be my backup pair... but since the others aren't in yet, I might get used <br />to these and use the other as back up... but I so like the others... <br /><font size=""4"" color=""#0000ff"">Only time will tell!</font>"

just a test. Will my friend Sue click on this link 
and read my blog or will she ignore it? If she does 
click... and then if she does read.... will she comment? 
Will we ever know? Only the shadow knows..... I guess."

Listening to people answer phones. What Fun! What 
a time! 

My candle order came today! Yay for free stuff. 
I have a whole shelf full of candles from candle 
parties probably 3 years ago. I needed more obviously. 
How exciting. Now I get to bag it all up and play 
delivery girl to all my friends. I am the luckiest. 
At least my office smells wonderful."

"event","I have no money. Well no frivolous, spendable, god that is a cute 
skirt money to spend. but I really really want that skirt! And that 
top!I really really do! Oh what to do? 
I could take money out of savings. That would be the ""Malcolm and Teva 
annual vet visit"" money, and I am not sure that should be converted in 
to the ""God that skirt is cute and so is that top"" money. Why do 
cats need vet care anyway? And I haven't even gotten the Teva reminder 
card yet. Just the Malcolm one. 
Must be strong! Must remember that the skirt and top might possibly 
still be there next weekend when I will have ""god that is a cute 
skirt"" money. Can I stay strong? Can I be counted on to be good? 
When I get done walking at the river park this afternoon can I be 
strong enough to drive home and not to the nearest ATM. 
Fingers Crossed. Let's hope so."

"event","Apparently I am, possibly, sadly, but most likely 
allergic to corn! I spent today home sick because 
I hate nothing but corn for dinner last night. 
Wonderful, delicious grilled corn. 

Now I fell like Crap! 

I woke up at 7:10am this morning in so much 
pain I could barely get out of bed. It was 
billing day at work, so I had no choice 
but to get up and go in. Luckily I had 
called my boss first and she told me that 
I could go home as soon as I got the mail. 
The drive to work and back home was excruciating. 
It took me forever to get to sleep but when I did, 
I slept until 4pm. I cancelled walking with my friend 
and stayed home this evening. Now I just want to
get to bed but from 12am-12:30 everynight I am
on the work vigil... 6 more minutes I can go to bed... 

Then there is tomorrow, which is really today, 
but I would rather face it tomorrow. Not a 
day I have been looking forward to. Oh well..
There is no avoiding it now. August 17th 2005 
is the day my mom died. Here is the last pic 
I took of her, about a week before she went to the 
hospital.

Oh well, who really cares. Hmmm..
Maybe Malcolm... and Ally... they both 
like to eat. Teva isnt as fond of food. 

So here is my live journal. Why? Why? 
Why not. Why not write daily (or yearly)
about sitting around watching tv. 
Hey I cleaned corn tonight. Give me 
some props for that. 

Look! There I go talking all street again. 
It hurts to be this hip. Hurts..."

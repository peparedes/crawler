If ignorance is bliss,
Then eradicate my knowledge of my history
Now meaningless, left on my own
I looked for a long time,
Crossed paths with your kind
But some things are better left alone

Just bodies, they bite, they scratch, 
They crawl at golden souls
Hue pictures you won't see or ever know
Just bodies, these golden souls 
With pictures were deleted
Heaved into the ocean to drown with their brothers."

I hear the cries
but I don't see the reasons to which
this cry should lead me to
a tradgedy
a crowd gathers as I look with curiosity

and as I stare at a masterpiece
I want to give you the grace that led me
to this state of mind
it's beautiful

and frightened
I approach a crowd
I act as if connive
the stare at me
with bitter dislike
awaiting a proper response
they stare at me"

Do you ever feel like breaking down?
Do you ever feel out of place?
Like somehow you just don't belong
And no one understands you
Do you ever wanna runaway?
Do you lock yourself in your room?
With the radio on turned up so loud 
That no one hears you screaming

No you don't know what it's like
When nothing feels all right
You don't know what it's like
To be like me

To be hurt
To feel lost
To be left out in the dark
To be kicked when you're down
To feel like you've been pushed around
To be on the edge of breaking down
And no one's there to save you 
No you don't know what it's like"

Who shot the bullet
That killed the air tonight
Without a thought, without a reason
Take a gun called hate
Up against your heart
And pull the trigger

It's over, it's only over
It's only over when we say

The smoke and mirrors
The lies that wind your tongue
Is this oppression what we wanted or what we needed?
As we function on impatience
And our patience is wearing thin
And live a lie that will destroy us all"

A killer with the perfect weapons, crystal eyes, and a heart of coal

Lip are quivering like a withering rose

It's much more than words and feelings sucking me dry
Is my marrow that sweet?
Your dead lovers have left a trail of broken hearts and misspent hopes
Sucking them dry
Does their marrow taste of sweetness, sweetness?

Hey there,
I know it's hard to feel like I don't care at all.
Where you are and how you feel.
With these lights off as these wheels
keep rolling on and on. (and on and on and on...)
Slow things down or speed them up.
Not enough or way too much. (and on and on and on...)
How are you when I'm gone?

So cut my wrists and black my eyes. 
(Cut my wrists and black my eyes)
So I can fall asleep tonight, or die.
Because you kill me.
You know you do, you kill me well.
You like it too, and I can tell.
You never stop until my final breath is gone.

Spare me just three last words.
""I love you"" is all she heard.
I'll wait for you, but I can't wait forever."

Hand in mine, into your icy blues
And then I'd say to you we could take to the highway
With this trunk of ammunition too

To let you know just how much you mean to me

Take in the context,
It's not a bad thing,
But when you start to pick it apart,
And you get so depressed,
It's that sort of thing,
That makes you think too much,
It's that sort of thing,
Makes you lose your objectivity,

So if you made it,
Just be glad that you did and stay there,
If you ever feel loved or needed,
Remember that you're one of the lucky ones,
And if it's over,
Just remember what I told you,
It was bound to happen so just...
Keep moving on,
There's no perfect endings,"

I'm happy you'll never understand what 
It's like to be trapped under six feet of solid glass,
I can see out, but no one gets in 
Screaming at this prison, I've locked myself into,
I'm sorry that I'm still breathing and that I'll 
Kill again. The loneliness is too much for me to handle.
But the taste for fresh blood, pushes me on. 
The fear of romance 
The pain of living 
The joy of sorrow 
The strength of forgiving 
I told myself the constant pain would ease the tension burning inside 
But the nights were cold and the days dragged to weeks,
I will die here alone I will die"

I said, we'll drown ourselves in misery tonight
I lied, you've worn out all your dancing shoes this time

Just give us war, worn lipstick by the door if I inflame

These eyes have had too much to drink again tonight
Black skies, we'll douse ourselves in high explosive light

Just give us war, I've been calling you all week
for my shotgun

Pick up the phone
Pick up the phone fucker

I wanna see what you're insides look like
I bet you're not fuckin pretty on the inside
I wanna see what you're insides look like
I wanna see em

Well you don't say
And well I can explain what happened to my face
late last night
I'm sleepin next to pools in vacant alleyways
And what I'm goin through, shot lipgloss through my veins
And when I can't complain
With the falling rain

C'mon

I wanna save your heart
I wanna see what your insides may be"

Put it off again

Our separate paths will lead us
Different ways
But the care remains
It will always stay


Yesterday's not all that bad
Sorry I could not make this last
Yesterday's not all we have
Sorry I could not make this last


One thing I need from you
That's honesty
Please never lie to me
That's what she said to me

One thing for sure is that
I will be true
In everything I do
That's what I learned from you"

When the sun came up,
We were sleeping in,
Sunk inside our blankets,
Sprawled across the bed,
And we were dreaming,

There are moments when,
When I know it ends,
The world revolves around us,
And were keeping it,
Keeping it all going,
This delicate balance,
Vulnerable all knowing,

Sing like you think no one's listening,
You would kill for this,
Just a little bit,
Just a little bit,
You would,

All the summer nights spent wondering;
So many questions asked, but no one's answering.
Would it be okay if I left today?
Took my chances on what you said was wrong?

I'm jaded, stupid, and wreckless.
Not sorry, and I'll never regret.
These years spent, so faded and wreckless.
Not sorry, and I'll never regret these years.
I'll never regret these years.

Now here i sit, so far away.
Remembering all our memories.
Its times like these that I miss you most,
Remembering when we were so close."

I walk a lonely road 
The only one I that have ever known
Don't know were it goes
But its home and I walk alone 

I walk this empty street
On the Blvd. of broken dreams
Were the city sleeps
And I'm the only one and I walk alone

My shadows the only one that walks beside me
My shallow hearts the only thing that's beating
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find
Till then I'll walk alone"

Life, is floating fast away.
But I look, your head is turned away.

From the moment you left I knew that something wasn't right.
But the feeling inside has kept me up all night.

You and me are like one heart-beat.

So slice open my veins.
And let, the romance bleed away."

Found a box of sharp objects what a beautiful thing

i'll try and know that everything's ok

So I guess this is where I lie
where the days are endless and the nights, they just don't belong.

Dreaming my reality
where truth and fiction don't seem to exist
Confusion is home here, but believe in you is what you insist (it's what you insist)

Nights, don't belong, the nights, don't belong, and the nights, they just don't belong.

(Nights don't belong) I'll never be ok, as long as i'm dreaming a reality."

Do you ever feel like breaking down?
Do you ever feel out of place?
Like somehow you just don't belong
And no one understands you
Do you ever wanna runaway?
Do you lock yourself in your room?
With the radio on turned up so loud 
That no one hears you screaming

No you don't know what it's like
When nothing feels all right
You don't know what it's like
To be like me"

My head, it hurts
Each day it's getting worse
My looks and smile 
Have now become my curse
Tight lips, red skirt
The neverending street
Big car, little man
My lover for a fee

So if you see me while you just driving by
Oh well I catch the twinkle inside you're eye
And if you want me well I guess I want you
Oh pretty baby how could you?

Standing in the rain 
Milk carton mug-shot baby
Missing since 1983
Standing in the rain
20 years of dirty needles 
Raindrops runnin' through my veins

My head it hurts 
Each day its getting worse
No sun, my room
Has now become my herse
Cold sores, im beat
Got bruises on my feet
My pride, these men
Have taken it from me

So if you see me while you're just driving by
Oh well I catch the twinkle inside you're eye
And if you want me well I guess I want you
Oh pretty baby how could you?

Standing in the rain

Lies make it better
Lies are forever
Lies to go home to 
Lies you wake up to
Lies from the alter
Lies make you falter
Lies keep your mouth fed
Lies till your death bed
Lies

Inside an office, a fallen angel
A smilin boomer with snake eyes
Creates the latest trends
And i just cant pretend
Dont call me your friend

When all these
Lies make it better
Lies are forever
Lies to go home to 
Lies you wake up to
Lies from the alter
Lies make you falter
Lies keep your mouth fed
Lies till your death bed"

Life, is floating fast away.
But I look, your head is turned away.

From the moment you left I knew that something wasn't right.
But the feeling inside has kept me up all night.

You and me are like one heart-beat.

So slice open my veins.
And let, the romance bleed away.

Back into I thought I knew, these words inside me, tell me what to do.
My heart held, in the palm of your hand.
(Forget my name)Now I know, the way to go, this place inside my demented mind.
(Forget my name)You saw me bleeding on the bathroom floor.
(Forget my name)This time in silence, this time I win."

This may never start.
We could fall apart.
And I'd be your memory.
Lost your sense of fear. 
Feelings insincere.
Can I be your memory?

So get back, back, back to where we lasted.
Just like I imagine.
I could never feel this way.
So get back, back, back to the disaster.
My heart's beating faster.
Holding on to feel the same."

You almost always pick the best times
To drop the worst lines
You almost made me cry again this time
Another false alarm
Red flashing lights 
Well this time I'm not going to watch myself die
I think I made it a game to play your game 
And let myself cry 
I buried myself alive on the inside
So I could shut you out
And let you go away for a long time"

And as the fragments of my skull begin to fall
Fall on your tongue like pixie dust just think happy thoughts

You and I
We'll fly home

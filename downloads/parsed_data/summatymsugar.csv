"event","Today Coach Montoya scheduled our camp at different times for different teams and I didn't have to go until 8:45!  I was soooo happy.  I know that sounds bad since it's summer vacation and 8:45 is early, but at least it's not 7:30!  lol.  We did our usual warm-ups and then we split off into Varsity and JV.  We practiced Shell defense and then our press break, and since I'm a guard I pass in the ball or go to the half court line and come up to get the ball.  And while I was passing in the ball, the person I'm supposed to pass it into wasn't open, so I looked over on the other side and another girl was open (cuz we had the rest of the girls guarding us lol) and I passed it to her instead and Coach Montoya stopped EVERYTHING to tell them that I made a great read on the play.  lol.  I felt very proud of myself, but now I feel conceded for saying that in here, but oh well!  Then I went home and Courtney came over and we went to Waterworld.  Ryan and Mark were there, but I didn't hang out with them cuz they had a WHOLE bunch of other ppl with them, so yeah.  Then we saw Derek and Sajed so we hung out with them.  It was fun I guess, but Derek and Sajed were being there usual selves, GAY!  lol Well Sajed was just acting stupid and it made Derek really mad.  And they got kicked out of the lazy river.  lol.  I'm sad though cuz Derek is moving to Washington on Sunday.  It's not that I like him like that again or anything, but he is my friend, and he says that he probably won't move back in with his mom (cuz he's goin with his Dad) until he gets out of highskewl.  I hate it when friends move!  It sux!  I don't think I'll see him again b4 he moves though.  And if he doesn't move back then I probably won't see him ever again, cuz u know, we'll be going into college and stuff.  Oh well.  I'm talking to Mike now and we may go to WaterWorld together tomorrow, but I can only stay for a lil while cuz I have 2 basketball games for G-Way.  But oh well!"

"event","Yesterday I didn't have basketball camp so I go to sleep in!  YAY!  After I woke up I went to Waterworld with Melissa.  We met up with Kayce, and Nicole.  It was so funny.  All these girls were trying to cut us cuz we were going down the tube slides and they weren't.  But Kayce wouldn't let them.  The whole day every time they saw us they'd give us the dirtiest looks.  lol.  We were gonna follow them around and see what happened, but then decided not to.  Then Melissa's older sister and my bro came after there summer skewl classes.  We walked over to KFC/TacoBell for dinner and on our way there this old guy looked at us from his car and started like wagging his tongue at us.  Melissa and I freaked out.  lol.  I mean, it wasn't that bad, but it just kinda freaked us out u know?  Today I had basketball camp, then went and helped Ms. O. OMG!  We had a blast!  We took these four gym mats and mad a little fort thing with one mat on tope of the whole thing.  Then we'd put 3 ppl under the mat on top and one person would jump on top and the 3 under would bounce them up and down using there feet and it would collapse and stuff!  It was really funny.  U kinda had to be there though.  lol.  Then I went to the younger kids camp and helped out.  And now I'm at home and about to go get ready for 2 b-ball games!  Fun stuff!  Buh bye!"

"event","Yesterday I couldn't update cuz my bro was on the net all day cuz he got an MP3 player with money he's saved up, so I couldn't get on the net.  I went to the D-Bax game and we had seats right on the first base line.  It was kewl, cuz we won.  Then I got home and I watched the DVD of Randy Johnson's perfect game.  Today I got up to go to b-ball camp.  It was fun, but we had to run a lot, cuz that's just what Coach Montoya does, makes us run.  lol.  Then we worked on plays for our games on Wednesday and Friday.  Then I got home, took a shower, and went over to help Ms. O.  We played charades the whole time lol.  And then made prank phone calls.  We were like ummm this is West Coast Chestnuts and we're a cattering service looking for Frank and one time the guys name was Frank that answered the phone.  lol It was great.  lol.  Now I'm at home and j/c, talking to Mike.  He wants me and my bro to come over to his house cuz he's bored.  lol I guess I'll go.  There's nuttin else to do.  Buh bye!"

"event","UGH!  I keep forgetting to update this.  lol.  Wednesday I went to Waterworld again with my bro, Melissa, and her older sister.  I twas ok.  But Tim and Melissa kept getting into it like always.  I swear, they like each other for a long time and then hate each other.  They fight like they're already married or sumthing lol.  We went again on Thursday where Tim and Melissa got even more mad at each other, but luckily Samantha and whole bunch of other ppl were there from our school too so we didn't have to put up with it. Ryan wasn't there though cuz his little brother had a baseball game.  *tear*  Then Friday I had a b-ball game for Greenway.  Which I guess individually I did really well in.  At least that's what the coach said.  But as a team we lost by 11.  lol.  But it's only a summer league, and the girls were pressing us REALLY hard.  And there not supposed to do that in the summer league.  Then, I got home and took a shower and got dressed to go to the movies. We took my friend Lacey to the movies with us.  She just moved back to Phoenix, last week so I'm really excited.  Cuz she lived like next door to me 4 a while and moved 6 years ago and just moved back.  lol.  Today I'm going to the D-Back game, cuz we have season tickets u know.  lol.  There giving away DVD's of Randy Johnson's perfect game and have autographs b4 the game starts so we're gonna do that.  Other than that I haven't done anything today, even though I wanted to go to Waterworld, but since we have the game I'm not gonna go.  Oh yeah, yesterday I was at DF helping Ms. O for summer skewl and Andrew, Shelby, Britt Lewis, Natahan, and I were making prank phone calss telling ppl that they won stuff from like Power 92 and stuff, but they all knew it was us, so it didn't matter.  lol.  THen we got a ride to McDonald's in Ms. Moran's convertable.  lol.  It was fun stuff.  lol.  Well that's pretty much it.  I SWEAR I'll update more often, hopefully.  lol. Oh and about the flirty thing, I""m not really feeling flirty right now, but if I saw Ryan or Mike (maybe not as much of Mike cuz he is like in LOVE with Candice and only likes me a lil bit) I probably would be.  I just wanted to see what it would do. lol"

"event","Yesterday I went to Waterworld for the first time this year.  It was ok I guess, except since it was Memorial Day it was friggen packed!  My bro and I were on the Lazy River and I saw Ryan.  So when he went to get out I stayed there and waited for him.  Then I got in and we floated aroudn for a while.  It was fun!  He would wrap his legs around mine while we were in inner tubes and he'd splash me and I'd splash back and stuff.  It was fun.  Then I had to go fin my bro and he helped look for him wiht me.  Which was sweet. Then he had to go back to his family cuz his Mom was lookin for him.  So then I found my bro who was with my aunt cuz he had called her cuz he couldn't find me.  So then I got in trouble and we had to go home.  But it was worth it.  I think. . . N-E-wayz. . . Today I went to b-ball camp at &:30 in the morning.  Whoopee!!  (yeah right)  Then I went to another camp to help out with the little kids.  After that I haven't done anything except watch t.v.!  Fun stuff!  lol.  I g2g cuz it's dinner time!  YUM!"

"event","OMG!!!!  I just spent like 15 minutes writing this journal and the comp just kicked me off.  lol  N-E-Wayz. . . I went camping with my friend's family on Friday night.  It was fun stuff.  lol.  We stayed until today and I got back about an hour ago.  We got to the camp around 11 at night and then set everything up.  We got up Saturday and rode quads all day.  It was soooo cool.  Melissa, Tim, and I went out on this one rode that took 4ever to get back to the camp site on.  It went all around the Cocconino National Forest and it was full of rocks and bumps and stuff.  So we were all gunnin it over the bumps and rocks.  It was great, lol.  Then we played this one game, 500, except instead of using a football like most people do, we hit a baseball.  Then Tim, Melissa, and I went out riding again and we were all going up and down these hills.  Then I wanted to go down a steeper one, and let me tell u, this was my first time actually driving a quad lol.  I lost control half way down and hit a rock.  The quad automatically stopped and I fell off and kinda rolled.  I was ok, but something on the quad broke to where we couldn't steer (stear?) it.  I felt sooooo bad, and still do.  I have to pay for half of it to get it fixed.  Then we played 500 again then had some dinner and then went out for a night ride and sense there was only 2 quads now, we had to have 3 ppl on each one.  lol.  But it was ok.  We went to bed and then got up today, packed everything up and went home.  Now, I might go over to Vallie's house and stay the night.  We might T.P. too.  He, he, he!"

"event","OMG!  I haven't updated this in forever.  lol, sry.  I went to Disneyland last Friday, with my school's band.  Even though I'm not in band, but my bro is,  so I got to go too.  lol.  Saturday I had a b-ball tournament, which we got second in.  It sucked cuz the refs were REALLY crappy, and the team we played wasn't even in our division, they were in an older one, but their tourney had been canceled, so they were in ours.  Sunday I didn't do anything.  On Monday all we did at skewl was sign yearbooks or watch movies which was fun stuff lol.  Then later that night we had a promotion dance which was fun cuz I danced with Mike!  lol.  But I just found out that he doesn't like me like that anymore, so I think I'm moving on cuz I don't wanna waste time ya know?  lol.  Tuesday we practiced our promotion for the promotion cermony that was on Wednesday.  It was sooooo boring.  We had to walk in and out like 3 times.  It sucked!  Then we went to third hour and then to fourth hour which sucked cuz we had to do writing assignments cuz we were too loud, but then our teacher gave us all candy cuz we cooperated with him.  lol.  Then we went to lunch and got REAL burgers that they cooked outside on a grill.  lol.  Then we went to 6th hour for like 1 minute and went over to the gym for a volleyball game which was hilarious cuz we all started doing the wave.  lol.  Then we had a talent show which sucked except for Mike's band and some dances.  Then we had our promotion on Wednesday and got to stay a little while after to take pictures with friends and stuff.  Then Courtney, Amanda, Melissa, Audrey, Mike, my bro (Tim), and I (and some parents too) went to T.G.I. Friday's for lunch and on the way home with Audrey and Mike we saw one of our friends' older sister get ina car accident.  They went right through a fence cuz some lady didn't stop in the yellow lane but stopped WAY after it while crossing amajor street.  Luckily they weren't hurt.  Then Audrey came to my house and we went to go pick up her sister from skewl cuz her school is by my house.  Since it's not far we walked and on our way home some guy started jacking-off in front of us.  It was so gross!  My Mom had us call the cops and stuff so they came over and asked questions and gave us a case # and stuff.  I felt bad for Audrey's sister though cuz she's only just got out of 5th grade and she started crying, out of shock I guess.  It was sad.  Thursday I didn't do anything until Courtney came over and spent the night, which wasn't all that fun, but it gave me something to do.  We went over to the baseball field where I saw Ryan.  (He's sooooooo hot!) I hung out with him, Shauna, Meghan, Cody, Matt, Courtney, and Tim.  It was fun stuff.  After we stole Ryan's hat from him he was tryin to pretend all upset, but I knew he wasn't.  lol.  Then we finally gave it back to him, after her poured like 2 gallons of water on me lol, and we sat on this bench and every once and a while Ryan would just turn and stare at me so I'd stare back and he'd look right into my eyes.  A lot of guys stare away from your eyes or avoid your eyes, but not Ryan, it's really weird, but REALLY cute, cuz I love his eyse.  lol.  Then todya I went and saw Shrek 2 with Courtney and haven't done anything after that.  I'm sooooo bored though, maybe I'll call Nicole and get her to come over or something.  I'll try and update this journal more often though lol.  BYE!"

"event","Today was a pretty good day.  In first hour I got to get out of class for IZAPP so we could ZAP two girls that are in 7th grade for like, 20 minutes.  So I didn't have to put up w/that guy writing notes to me.  Excetp when I got back he wrote me a lil note saying he's gonna write me an actual note, like a page long kinda thing that I'm supposed to write back to.  I was like NOOOOOOO!!!!!!  But then I went to second hour which is when I T.A. and I found out that the teacher I T.A. for, who's like the coolest teacher ever, is gonna buy all of her T.A.'s lunch tomorrow.  We might get to make burglar alarms in my science class.  lol.  Fun stuff.  Then I found out that Samantha decided to write notes to the guy I like in 3rd hour.  She was trying to hook us up.  I like him soooo much, he says he likes me too, but he likes this one other girl more.  But she lives WAY far away, and that's why he won't really go after her.  So Sam keeps telling him to go after me, but he's just not sure what to do.  I'm gonna tell her to back off though, cuz I don't think she's helping any by pressuring him.  N-E-Wayz. . . I DON'T HAVE ANYMORE HOMEWORK FOR THE REST OF THE YEAR!!!!!!  YAY!!  lol.  But I have a test tomorrow in math with Mrs. Kasprzbitch.  lol  GAYNESS!!!!  But then that will all be ok cuz I'm goin to Disneyland Friday with the school band, which I'm not in, but my brother is so I get to go too, and the guy I like, Mike, is in his group!!  He, he, he."

"event","Hey there!!!  I had a pretty good day.  Not much actually happened though.  lol.  OMG!!!  I hate first hour.  It's already frigin boring, but now this guy that I can't stand keeps writing me notes.  I'M GONNA GO NUTS IF HE WRITES ME ONE MORE NOTE!!!!  I keep trying to tell him to stop but he won't.  He's so annoying.  I wish he'd just stop or my teacher would catch us and move one of us, even though there's only one REAL week of skewl left, but still. . . I played softball in P.E. today and showed off to the softball coach.  He says I have a good swing and asked me why I didn't try out for softball, but of course, cuz this is the type of luck I have, during softball try-outs I still had a cast on my leg from braking my ankle during basketball season coming down from a rebound.  GRRR. . .Ok, well I'm gonna stop updating cuz Mike wants to see my journal but he's waiting till I finish updating, so I'm finished now.  lol"

"event","Today was an ok day.  I stayed up WAY late last night cuz some guys threatened to T.P. my house cuz I T.Ped one their g/f's house.  So now they wanna get me back, but no one else that was w/me. . .umm, alrighty then!  I technically caught them too cuz I saw our motion light go on outside and I heard them all run through the rocks.  So I went outside and they were all making stupid ghost noises. So I stayed up waiting just in case they came back, which they didn't.  So I slept in and then stayed in my P.J's all day.  I watched the D-Bax game, which they lost, GAYNESS!!  But what else is new?  Then I finally got dressed to go to church at 5:30.  I got home and went on the net earlier.  While I was on the comp crashed and my mom started yelling at me.  She got all pissed off.  I was like WTF I didn't do anything I was just typing.  Then she told me not to get on this site, cuz this was what I was doing when it crashed, until we fixed the comp since this is the third time it's crashed in like 2 weeks.  See how well that worked?  lol.  THat was about it for today.  Buh Bye!
I love Mike!!!"

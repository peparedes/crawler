what the fuck is up with commnication in all its walls and patterns?  I understand my issues and my throwback and holdups and problems with my life and existence from an outside stance, i can give other people amazing advice on the whole deal, but when it comes to myself, i am consumed, absorbed by my own pathos and lack and inabilities.  Why is it that i say what i dont mean and accomodate accomodate and give all that i have then resent when i dont get the same mindless, idiotic devotion in return?  

(((breathe.)))

okay.  so thats a venting, an air venting, circulation of gases, hot air.  The thing is, i have purpose, just not resolve.  I mess up on the follow-through.  I can dig deep, but then find myself at the bottom of a hole, by myself.  Is this enough goddamn vagueness for you?  It's enough for me.  I spend my creation turning realism into metaphor, what else do i expect?  A mythic struggle of mystics, a poltergeist masturbation.  A life of dreams.

Dont worry, i know what im doing.  Have confidence in me, and i will too."

"event","Thoughts on the art, is it artifice?  

My social controls and norms dictating my reactions, my hopes, my very outlook, but what happened to free will?  It gets lost in the shuffle of learning all others, and then finding your voice.  To pair down a driving emotion to an image, to communicate clearly, to say ""I've been having bad dreams."" is not sufficient.  I want to rock people's heads back.  I want for a validation of my movements through this world.  

Am I looking in the wrong place?  Is an audience, even one comprised of many artists and creators the correct source of approval?  Of course not.  It must come from me.  It all comes from and returns to myself.  My SELF, but at the same time, or out of time, or maybe just in time, I try to break the self, to train the mind.  To train the mind is to not seek approval from other than the accomplishment of diminishing negativities and weaknesses within me.  

You are right, though, we must not lose that connection to our bodies.  Whenever I imagine an image, a communication, a translation of thought from my head to the screen, it is within my physical frame that I launch this attempt.  But the separation for me is not of the mind from the body, but of the mind from the self, the emotion from the intellect.

Thinking and doing are very different concepts, and creating and critiqueing are likewise in opposition.  I have trouble committing.
I have trouble committing.
I have trouble committing, but I'm trying harder every day.

As long as I commit to trying, I'm getting somewhere."

Our van, the rocks in colorado, the sky in california, the urban rust pealing decay of bums with two different shoes, graffiti paint rolling along beaches, hiking through the dark, itching my poison oak ohh, it feels so good but it's soooo baaaaaaddd.....  giving gifts on the road is a beautiful thing, even if it's only a copy of each of the Lord of the Rings trilogy books, the covers torn off, that we dug out of a barnes and noble dumpster.  or rainbow ribbons for prayer in lodge. medicinemedicine, my heart is getting free-er.

"event","I've developed a theory.  It's called Turtle Climbs Out, turns into She-Tiger and Befriends Giant Hawk.  

Turtles are most of the time very wise, and know when it is safe to explore and when to sleep.  But sometimes a turtle (in my theory) will climb out of it's shell and believe that it is a beautiful She-Tiger.  She-Tigers are very much like turtles, but have the added protection of sharp claws and teeth.  Turtles have the protection of their shells, which keep them reminded that they have strength and security within themselves, but also that they have limits to their abilities of protecting themselves, and need to at times, retire to the wisdom and seclusion of their thoughts.  

Even though I most of the time know I am the Turtle, last night I acted a little like the Turtle Who Thought it was a She-Tiger.  It is because on some level, I wanted to befriend the Giant Hawk and go racing across the land and sky with him, and as a She-Tiger, could have done so because the She-Tiger knows that if the Hawk tries to eat her, she can just bite or claw him and he will know that it is impossible to eat a powerful although beautiful She-Tiger.  

But Since I am not a She-Tiger, but was for a moment only a Turtle Who Thought it was a She-Tiger, I had no claws or sharp teeth.  Turtles do not like clawing or biting in anger or distress, but only in moments of play and joy.  My only hope in not being consumed by the charming, intelligent and beautiful Giant Hawk laid in remembering that my powers are in the wisdom of self wholeness, and the ability and wisdom to know my limits.

Once I remember my turtle qualities and strengths, I know that i can hold my own with even the most amazing Hawks, and holding my own doesnt mean fighting off, but resisting an inherent urge to become a soaring She-Tiger.  Because Turtles dont want their urges fulfilled under the powers of spirits with the names of alcohol."

In this moment I am doing well, spiritually, mentally, physically, emotionally, really, i'm not too stressed, although trying to get enough sleep.  I am now getting almost all food from either my co-op or dumpsters.  This is amazing, and you wouldnt believe how little i spend on food.  This is good, considering i want a camera, a road trip, a college education, etc.  oh yeah, and an apartment.  Yeah.

My friend benjamin read me my chart (astrologically speaking) the other day, and he does it in the eastern tradition, not westernm, so instead of being a Sagitarius like i am used to, I am instead a Libra.  A well-balanced sign.  A lot of good things were said, I am now in a period of moon, which is awesome.  I am a mystical being, so sez ben, in so many words.  A lot of goodness in my chart mmmhmmm, but we knew that, didnt we?  My day of birth is next tuesday.  The 7th.

I may go chant in a yoga center in NYC tonight, and bring my drum and get that heartbeat going, you, know, that rhythm.  beatbeatbeat

"event","So lots of things are moving through my consciousness.  I am starting a new video project and feel as if i am embarking on a new journey.  Which it is.  It's always a path of rediscovery and growth, to create.  Been having nightmares, but i think i know how to fix it.  

I now have two turtles, in case y'all didn't know.  They are Red-Eared Sliders, about an inch long, and cute as hell.  I got them in Chinatown about a month ago and their Names are Ancient and Spread-Eagled.  They love to swim and be warm and make their water very messy.  Also that thing about turtles being slow? COMPLETE MYTH.  These critters are FAST!  And Ancient escaped from her bowl before i had a tank and she also can climb up completely vertical surfaces as long as there is a little texture to grasp.  (some purchase, you could say...;)  So if anyone knows anything about these lovely creatures and their caretaking, I'd love to have that knowledge passed to myself.

peace."

If anyone wants to get more involved in the co-op, come to a meeting!  They are always Wednesdays at noon.  We are located in the Dining Hall to the right of the stairs before you go down them into the chartwells giganticness.  Our hours are M-F noon-midnight, S/Sun 8pm-midnight.  We are completely volunteer run off the loving compassion of organic goods and good community, all decisions are made with concensus, (cooperatively)  and most importantly, EVERYONE IS WELCOME!!!  

If you wanna join the email list go to http://groups.yahoo.com/group/purchase_food_coop/  and subscribe.  You can also read all past emails there, there's lots of tasty info in those archives, sometimes i just read them for nostalgia reaons...  Also x6985 is us.

We just got a new distributor (Tree Of Life)  so, this means that we will soon have a more consistent level of cheap natural vegan/vegetarian grocery and personal care items.  If anyone wants to help out with this, suggest something, or propose a new idea, come and be heard!!!  We strive to work on a basis of non-heirarchical decision-making and structure in general (no president/etc, all roles are shared by everyone.)

Okay, enough fer now.  If ya wanna contact me too, i'm more than willing to talk yer ear off about our belives co-op.  Or just give you a summary.  Don't be scared to ask questions, my heart is bursting with good will towards life and passion!  See you all soon.

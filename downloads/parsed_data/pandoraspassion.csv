"event","So I stayed home today. Biological reasons and a cold, not particularly pleasant... Tried to sleep, couldn't sleep. So I watched TV and hung at the computer all day. Instead of being at school. That is indeed a nice feeling. Not like I missed much today anyway... Latin, Religion/Philosophy and Biology. *shrug* 

Mareike just invited me to her all-inclusive birthday celebration in March... that should be fun. I hardly see her anymore, but somehow we're still friends without talking. Nice girl... difficult life she has. Things seem to be getting better now though.

So tomorrow there's this presentation about Abi and then we get our report cards... easy day, then Thursday and Friday off. Can't wait till I'm in Leer again tomorrow noon. Don't feel at home anywhere but when I'm with Jan, as pathetic as that sounds."

"event","Ugh. I can't recall why I agreed to join the roleplay Jan is in Wednesday nights over mIRC. Most of the people there are idiots and the story is... without any substance whatsoever. I'm amazed I'm somehow staying at it this whole evening.

Full day of school again tomorrow... bah. Biology, German, English, History, two hours of each. Wish I could just stay home... although Friday I only have to be at school for two hours and can go straight to Leer afterwards. Have a lot to do Friday. Choir rehearsal, Doctor, ask the office for employment about becoming a <i>Logopede</i> (?) and ... and... go to the bank. Yes. That's about it, but it's still enough to fill an afternoon.

Bah. I'm tired and wish I could just stay home tomorrow. And skip all of tomorrow if I had the choice... wah. At least I have off next Thursday and Friday. Huzzah."

"event","I hate Sunday evenings, but at least I can spend them with Jan. Makes getting up the following morning not quite so difficult.

Jan's been downstairs for over 20 minutes speaking with his parents about helping me finance my driver's liscence since my parents decided not to... I'm missing 200 Euros which I have to have by Tuesday, and I don't have that kind of money nor the possibility to make it within six days... sorry folks... and Thursday night my glasses broke, and Benni is on vacation so I had to go find another glasses repair shop. Turned out they couldn't repair the frame (thank Heaven that's the only thing that was broken) and I had to buy a new one. The lady gave me a pair for 79 Euros instead of 189, but still, it's money I haven't got. And when I told my mother she said I had to pay for it. Nice. A few hours later she called back and told me she'd changed her mind because she'd misunderstood. Devil, can't she just pay attention properly for once?

Jan just came back... his parents are absolutely against him giving me the money, and think that I'll fail the driving test, and and and. They say I should get a job (where? and with what qualification? and when? I come home from school at 5pm, and I'm not in Leer regularly enough on weekends to have a regular job), and they wonder where the child support money goes to that my parents get. So do I. I'm at school all day, and on the weekend and during vacation I'm here. 

Oh right, I remember now. My parents planned the child support money into their new house. And they ""need"" me to go study so that they can keep paying for it.

As far as I care, they can go fuck themselves. They're my parents and it's their duty to make sure I have enough money for necessities, including food, school supplies and my liscence. And I hardly have enough money for the pill and to be able to see my boyfriend on the weekends. Things aren't at all turning out the way I'd hoped them to... and I wonder why they haven't. Until we moved everything was going well.

Every day I find myself wishing I could move out, move in with Jan. But I wouldn't be able to cover transportation costs to go to school (would total to about 100 Euros a month), and somehow his parents would have to support me, Jan and his sister Sarah who is studying medicine... I hardly think that that's an option.

Jan is done with school in spring. Then we'll see if we can't work anything out."

"event","...it's been over a year now. Enough has happened to fill half a novel. Won't go into any of that now... I don't even expect anyone to read this.

Out of sentimentality... hello again.

Somehow I miss my old life. This... new one hasn't quite turned out the way I expected it to. Everything is working out beautifully with Jan and with school, but fucko - home life has taken a mighty turn since last year, since almost exactly one year ago. Maybe this is ""adult life"", or maybe this is just a friendly reminder of the fact that I want to get away from here as soon as possible. Don't even know what I want to do with my education... what good will it do me? Our job market hasn't seen a low like this in ages... I don't have particularly good chances of finding a job other than homemaker. Not quite what my goal was, but if it's at Jan's side, I'm willing to do it... with a smile on my face.

At least I don't need to fear about a roof over my head just yet.

So much to do, so little ambition, too much time... I wish Jan were here... evenings can be so cold and long."

"event","1. Name someone with the same birthday as you.
Don't know anyone.
2. Where was your first kiss?
First random kiss on Henne's terrace with three other people simultaneously. First real kiss behind the canisters and bike stand in the school yard.
3. Have you ever seriously vandalized someone else's property?
Just a bit of graffitti on school tables.
4. Have you ever hit someone of the opposite sex?
Sure.
5. Have you ever sung in front of a large number of people?
Yes, and I would love to do it again.
6. What's the first thing you notice about the preferred sex?
Posture. No, not figure.
7. What really turns you on?
Ask certain individuals and they may just tell.
8. What do you order at Starbucks?
If I actually had a Starbucks to go to, I'd order something along the lines of coffee.
9. What is your biggest mistake?
Not trusting myself.
10. Have you ever hurt yourself on purpose?
One time too often. One time too little.
11. Say something totally random about yourself.
Sometimes I wish I weren't blonde. Then I wish I were blonder.
12. Has anyone ever said you looked like a celebrity?
Juliet once told me I look like Miranda Otto. I was happy for 12 hours.
13. Do you still watch kiddy movies or tv shows?
I hardly ever watch television.
14. Did you have braces?
No.
15. Are you comfortable with your height?
Yes.
16. What is the most romantic thing someone of the opposite sex has done for you?
Hm. Couldn't say...
17. When do you know it's love?
When that one person is my one and only inspiration.
18. Do you speak any other languages?
English, German, French, Latin.
19. Have you ever been to a tanning salon?
No. Don't plan to.
20. What magazines do you read?
National Geographic now and then.
21. Have you ever ridden in a limo?
No. Seen a few though.
22. Has anyone you were really close to passed away?
Friends come and friends go.
23. Do you watch MTV?
Not since they turned for the worse.

Good luck to my dear friend Ian, may everything turn out well! *hugs* Knowing you, everything will one way or another... can't imagine you leaving us without a tormenter already. ;)

Going to Limit with Jan and Julia this evening, and have a practise day tomorrow for the choir competition. Which is in a week... I'm nervous and excited, and I think you can all guess which of those attributes I am more!

*sigh* Yes. Jan will be here any minute, so I better clean up a bit. Talk to all of you soon I hope."

At 16.00 I have choir practise (hurrah!) and I should be finished round 20.00 or 20.30 this evening. Then I'll be picked up by either my parents or Jan and be driven to his house for the party. Yes, today will be one of the best Saturdays in my life.

And the last few hours of last night were among the best hours of a Friday I've ever witnessed. But if I go into any detail, several of you *cough*Ian*cough* will surely go mad. So I shall spare the last bits of sanity... or destroy them, depending on how pedophilistic you all are! Muahahahaha!

I don't joke around as much, I see the world differently, I think differently. I like this me more. Secretly I hated the happy, somehow foolish, somehow deep child I was. Somehow I've become something so different over summer. So much more like I wanted to become. Maybe it was because I looked at my relatives and saw what I didn't want to become. I don't know. It doesn't really matter.

Jan is a godsend. Just when I was preparing myself for another mind-breaking year, he showed up and proved me wrong. I couldn't thank him enough for that.

My eyes have been getting better and better for some reason. Without them I'm still a bit shortsighted, but now I'm shortsighted on both eyes, not just one and longsighted on the other. So I can actually do some things without my glasses (like updating lj!). Very nice.

I still have quite a lot of homework to do this afternoon... and I need to do something for math. Not that I really don't want to, I have the incentive, it's just that I have other things I'd rather be doing. Waking up completely would be one of them."

Oh yes, it was worth it, things are so much better. And through Jan I've become so much more self-loving, assured, happy, optimistic, <b>creative</b>. I've rediscovered my Muse, my love of language and expression. I could go on but dare not bore you.

I need to make a new layout... I think the time is right for some more colour, wouldn't you agree?

I haven't done more than my English homework today, I just can't be bothered... math is hardly important at the moment, and I couldn't find the page for Biology we were supposed to. Teachers, I swear... can't believe Jan wants to become one.

I've been leaning more and more towards studying music. But for that I need piano lessons, my piano skills may be good, but not nearly good enough to gain acceptance to a music school. Music theory is so much more fascinating, it draws me in. Every music lesson I'm propelled into another world that I completely understand. Art theory... art is not theory for me, art is creation. Art is expression. Not theory, it can't be learned. You can, or you can't. That's all there is to it.

We shall see. For now I need my Photoshop and Bach. Be back in no more than an hour with a new layout."

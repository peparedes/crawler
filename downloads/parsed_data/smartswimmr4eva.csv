on saturday night, i got a .........................................................................................................................................................................................................................cell phone!!!!!!

"event","ok, so today i woke up and went to school early to get NJHS service hours.  so we were moving stands into the auditorium for the band concert adn my left shoulder started hurting like crap!!!  and i dont think it was because of lifting stands, cuz they're not that heavy.  anyways, i felt soooooo bad in homeroom, my shoulder, i felt really hot, and it hurt to breathe.  so anyways, about half way trough first bell, i couldnt handle it any more, and went to the nurse.  all my friends were saying how pale i was and when my teacher signed my planner, she said the same thing.  so i went to the nurse and she said i didnt have a fever, even though i was burning up.  so i couldnt go home.  i put some ice on my shoulder and laid down on the beds on the back.  then i went back for second bell, but i was gonna be late cuz of the nurse thing.  so i asked my teacher to sign my planner again and she was like ""you're ot going home!!!""  so she went to alk to the nurse and told her how pale i was and that i wasnt being my usual self today so the nurse let me call my mom, who came to pick me up, but she came all the way from sufflok and had to leave work so it took about 45 minutes.  i wen tback to my locker to get my stuff and then dropped my practice sheet off in the band room (actually the auditorium cuz we have combined band this week) and then got my instrument.  so in the 40 minutes i sat in teh nurses office waiting for my mom, i actually felt better and kinda didnt fell sick any more.  but my mom came all the way from work, which she had to leave early so i came home and laid on the couch for like hours.  then i took a little nap and then watched spiderman till my brother got home.  now i have to babysit (last minute) and i'm still not 100% but oh well, i'll live.

7th bell- i felt soooooo sick in this bell that i didnt really comprehend what was going on and now i dont get the homework, but is it really my fault???

ok, so i got a headache during 5th bell, that wouldnt go away, and then in 7th bell, i felt REALLY sick so i came home and told my mom and she let me skip swim practice.  so i fell asleep on the couch for about a hour and now i feel MUCH better!!

on sunday, we went to the pool.  morgan, lauren B, tim, jordy, the suttons, and the egresses were all there.  it was fun but i got a little burnt on my shoulders.
then we went to dinner at ruby tuesdays with my daddy 4 fathers day.  the food was yummy!!!!

2day, after swim practice, i came home and then went 2 emilys 2 play.  we took a LONG bike ride all around her neighborhood and mine.  it was fun though.

Dear Meredith,

I dont understand y u r mad at me.  it was my choice and i chose what i thought was best for me.  the only reason u r mad at me is bcuz u hate it when u dont get ur way.  i was goin to challenge u that one time in band when ur ""lip was bleeding"", but i saw that u would be really mad if i did, so i didnt.  in doing that, i just spoiled u more, if thats possible.  If u dont accept my decision then oh well.  it was my decision, not urs, even josh and sarah said so.  u can continue to be mad at me but the reason u r mad is so stupid, its doesnt make sense.  Just to let u know, i'm not mad at u.  i'm just sad that u told me (and in a bragging way) about never paying attention in church and coloring during church.  from now on, i'm going to tell u when u do things that make me mad, like""
-pointing every little mistake that i make in band
- always making me feel like u r sooooo much better that me at everything
-and dont even pretend like its not true u wouldnt have even started playing the fulte if it wasnt 4 me!!!
-pretending like josh would go out with u if he had the chance, newsflash!  HE HAS A GURLFRIEND!!  josh is tired of u accusing him of something he didnt do.  So stop!!!

I hope u fianlly understand.

Julia Lea and Joah Chase (josh agrees)




Just so u know, i never said i colored in church, i never did when i was little either!!!!!!!  and i dont remember ever accusing josh of anything, newsflash!!!!  I DONT LIKE HIM ANYMORE!!!!!
yes, u got me to play the flute, but so wat???????????????  ur better than me

If u agree with them, tell me, bcuz u guys dont no anything about my life at home, u think u do but thats BS, no one does.

I hope i made my point"

Yesterday, Saturday, i went to busch gardens with the Band.  We arrived, Julia, Diane, and Chelsea were in my group.  We headed for Loch ness first, but chelsea sat out.  Then we saw the animal show (sooooooo cute) then we rode alpengeist.  Despite not wanting to ride it, Chelsea loved it.  My group took the skyrideto england, where we went to apollos, again chelsea loved it.  Then, we did bumper cars, just b4 check in at 2:00, which was when julia had to leave.  after check in, chelsea won and arcade game, getting a platypus as her prize.  then we rode loch ness again, with chelsea this time.  she loved it and me and diane sat in the front.  The big moment of our threee young lives was when me, chelsea, and diane rode apollos chariot in the front seat. SOOOOOOO MUCH FUN!!!!!!!!!!!!!  it beats out alpengeist!!!!!!!!  the came battering ram, divincis cradle, italain ice, dinner, big bad wolf, and then time to go back to the bus.  I wont tell u about the bus ride home, but if u wanna know wat happened and y i am sad about it, ask me to tell u.

Josh lost his wallet with $20 in it, a military ID in it and his 2 day pass in it.  he'll be groubnded for a while. SORRY JOSH, I STILL LOVE U!!!!!

so i had a tiring day yesterday.  but i stayed up till midnight watching miracle, thats not really half bad, even though i knew the USA was gonna win.

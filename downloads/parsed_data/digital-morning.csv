"event","I woke up yesterday at 6:30 in the god damn morning, well it was more of dad throwing my globes at me to get up actually lol. I hate mornings thats the worst bit of a day except if you have a crap day then the whole day is the worst part. Anyway what i was actually doing up at that time was that i had an operation at 9am and we had to drop Trent and his little friend of in town. The thing is i have had this operations before, i think it was about 2 years ago when i was still living with that whore bitch (my Mum, thats another story) But yeah he did the same as before and put me under anesthetic which was great and i woke up later with the minor operation finished, i just basically walked out (well hopping to be exact). HAHAHA what made it really funny was that the night before that i asked dad whether he was going to take me home after the operation and he said 'no, you can catch the bus', what made it funny was that he was totally serious. So i told him how much its gonna hurt and he changed his mind lol. 

I came home and come on LJ to find that a good mate of mine Chris was angry with another person from out little (friendship group). But i soon found out what happened and im totally on the side of Chris, that creep should rot in fucking hell. And well today my foot doesn't hurt at all actually i feel like i could wear shoes and everything. So im hoping that i will be able to go to Harbour town tomorrow and get some black shirts with dad. And that reminds me too i got to get a studded belt, another chain and some eyeliner. 

So hopefully i will be able to go tumoro with dad, because i really need some more shirts, and oh yeah Trent got his braces off meaning bad moods for a week because his teeth hurt BOOHOO FUCKING TRENT, oh well he is a little cry babi anyway, ill just stay in my room and close myself off from all other human activities around me (except when there is food of course) lol. 

Oh yeah and i got 9 days left to school and i still have to get my biology assignement done, not exactly looking forward to that"

"event","last night me and trent organised to go to cyber hive which is basically where we can play games against each other via a lan cable. The main reason i think he wanted me to go is because alot of people werent arriving until later in the day and well i think he wanted the company, so i thought i might invite a few mates, aaron and ewan which are some close mates from school. Anyway Trent and I took the bus into town, seriously that is one boring ride if you dont have music, or any mates to keep you company. This time i was luckily to have my mp3 on me YAY! when we got to town we went straight into cyber hive and started playing except Trent wanted a drink so i had to run down to coles to get one for him ^_^ onli coz im nice hahahaha nahhhhhh when i came back i jumped on a comp and aaron and ewan soon turned up.

I was pretty happy to see that they turned up, then we kept playing games except trent's little shit of a friends kept killing us because well it was 4 vs the 3 of us but meh i wasnt fussing. Then we decided to play call of duty and man that was the funniest i have played in a long while. First aaron starting jumping on one of the roofs and he went to jump off and ewan shot him as he went to jump it was the funniest thing i had seen in a long time, there were other funny moments but i cant be bothered remembering them and then typing haha im so lazy. 

Im suppose to be going shopping this afternoon but the weather is too gloomy and i would rather stay inside than go out atm.So ill talk to you all soon ^_^

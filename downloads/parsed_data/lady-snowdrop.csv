Not much news to tell lately, uni is going well although it keeps me busy and with my part time job it means I dont get to see much of my sexy hubby. Although he has been keeping himself busy anyway so probably doesnt even miss me *smiles*

Life is going on as normal and as normal you can see I havent been here in a while to post. Sorry but I guess I have too many things going on in my life that I just dont get time to get on and write about them.

Anyway I hope everyone is well and I'll post again next time I get a chance.

"event","Dear Journal,

Its been a long time since I was last here to see you.
So much has been happening lately.

Will has been very hard to live with, he has had some crap happen that has effected the way he is looking at life at the moment.

Its been effecting my life as well.

I know that Will would never be physically abusive to any female but that doesnt mean that he doesnt get physical with other things and that can be upsetting at times.

There are times when he will be depressed and we will sit down to dinner and he wont eat, or only eats a bit, doesnt say a word and then goes to his room. There are times when I will have to eat alone and here I am sitting at this big empty table, Will's plate on the table waiting for him and he just wont show, those are hard to deal with but what is even hard to deal with is when he doesnt come to our bed. I will be waiting, fall asleep and wake up during the night without him next to me, I will find him in his other room either curled up on the couch, on the floor or at his desk asleep, other times he wont even be asleep, he will just be sitting there with a candle burning in the darkened room.

Those are the hardest times to deal with cause I hate to see him hurting and not be able to do anything.

Its also hard when he ignores me or stays away from me.

The more scarier times are when he gets angry, like I said I know that he would never hurt a female, but it might happen accidentally and then he would but even more upset and angry.

He has thrown plates of food off the table, just because of something said that pissed him off at the time, he has thrown punches at Nate, but luckily Nate can handle himself and isnt stressed by it. 
Will can lash out verbally with things that are hurtful, but its the throwing things and breaking things that can be scary.

He isnt going to push me away no matter how much he tries.

I love him and I am going to be their for him through the good times and the bad times, after all isnt that what our wedding vows said.

I just want him to get back to his old self, the charming, happy, loving, fun guy. I know it might take time cause these 3 guys that died were really close to him and the fact they all died within a 9 day time frame would probably fuck anyone up in the head.. the last couple of years seem to have just been pretty bad ones for Will. I am hoping that the second half of the year might be better for him.

He had one good day the other day, he said that he had talked to Amanda that night and that even though he still has feelings for her and still thinks about her, that he felt they were getting back to the old friendship they had started with. He said it made him forget his troubles and feel that everything was going to be ok again..

Now he is in a bit of a pissed off and depressed mood at the same time, seems Amanda doesnt want things to be just the way they were cause she cant handle that.. the friendly flirting and stuff.. but now Will doesnt know what to do, cause that means that their friendship cant go back to the way it was and he doesnt know how to start a completely different type of friendship with her after so long of knowing her.

He says that its too hard to deal with this shit *I changed stuff to shit cause it sounds better*
He kind of feels like how can he still be friends with her and yet treat her differently than he used to at the beginning? He says thats not a friendship if you try to change people just cause you cant handle your own feelings and thoughts about them.

I kind of understand Amanda I mean if I was in love with Nate at the same time as Will, I know it would be hard to treat Nate just as a friend especially cause he is so hot and sexual, and if he was flirting with me I know it would be so easy to read more into it especially if he were to say certain things about feelings and thoughts.

But at the same time I kind of understand Will, I mean If I was in love with Nate at the same time as Will, but we could only be friends, I would try to put my thoughts and feeling to one side and I'd treat Nate just like every other male friend I have, because friendship is something special and when there is no chance of having anything else with the other person then I would put my feelings aside as best I could so that I didnt fuck up any chance of having a normal friendship like we used to.

*By the way just for the record, I am saying that I really do think Nate is very sexy, he has this charm which is different to Will's but at the same time just as charming and you know where you stand with Nate. He is just very good looking and sexy and smart and funny. But he does have a much darker side than Will.. And I would give up Will for all the money in the world. But that doesnt mean I cant think Nate is a very sexy, sexual guy*

"event","You know around January / February this year Will and I promised each other that we would never keep secrets from each other no matter what it was...except surprise parties are ok secrets =) ... but we have realized that by not keeping secrets we have trust in our relationship. 

You can get over being lied to and deceived only so much before you end up with a little seed of doubt always eating away at you and if that happens then its hard to make any relationship last for ever.
To have a happy, loving life with someone you need to be able to trust them with all your heart.

Will and I have that now and I am able to trust him because we talk about everything that is happening in our lives both good and bad.

All of Will's family has come to like me now, even though at the start of our marriage I know a few of them didn't like me at all, but now that they know I am willing to stand by Will and love him and work hard to make our relationship a good one.

There is nothing that I cant tell Will and we have some wonderful talks about anything and everything.

But I have to say to anyone reading this who is in a relationship, make sure that you are honest with your partner as well as your self  and if possible never hide anything from them because it isn't worth it.

If you are really meant to be with someone you will be able to be honest and truthful with them and they will be able to be truthful and honest with you as well... If they are not or you are not then the relationship isn't one that has a true future.

Will came back after his trip with his dad and he was like the Will I remember. Fun, happy, romantic, carefree, refreshed.

Michael and I had a talk today when Will was at work and although I understand where Michael is coming from I do kind of think that Will should have sorted out his own problems without help, dont get me wrong I am glad that I now know for sure that Will is totally mine in body, spirit and mind.

I now know for sure that the love he shows me and the romantic things he does are all for me and not because he feels guilty or that he is wishing I was someone else.

I'm just so happy and I just cant get over the difference in him now.

I'll will have to write more another day because for now I have to get going.

He has stuff coming out of both ends and his tummy is sore, which is probably why he is throwing up..

Its probably just a 24 hour bug.

Nath is sleeping and Deshae is also a sleep, its a good thing that she hardly wakes up during the night now..

I can give all my time to looking after Will, making sure he has a cool cloth and cleaning up after any throw ups that dont make it into the toilet bowl..

Poor thing he is really having a hard time tonight..

But I just wanted to let everyone know that he wont be able to come and play tonight..

"event","Dont you just hate it when all the quizzes that you do lose their pics as then you always end up with these boxes with no pic. 

I hate that.

Oh Well...

I've talked to some of Will's friends online and I always wonder why they think that Will is so perfect, sweet, sexy, and other stuff.. sometimes I feel that they put him on a pedestal because they only see the one side of him, you dont really get to see a 3D image of someone unless you spend time with them in real life because you dont actually get to know someone as well as you think by talking to them online.

I mean Will in real life is very much like he is online, but there are other parts to him as well, the parts of him with me that he doesnt go into such as the things we do, the laughs we have together.

I mean most people know that Will has a caring gentle side and that he is a decent guy who has a mother and a father and 9 siblings, but how many people know what his parents names are..unless you looked at my last post where their names are mentioned? 
How many people can tell me the names of all his siblings?
How many people can tell me what school Will went to?
How many people can tell me the names of his 4 best friends in real life?
How many people can tell me about the scars that he has?
How many people can tell me what his favorite foods are?
How many people can tell me what his favorite drink is...not including coffee?
How many people can tell me what Will wanted to be when he was a child?
What types of things does Will do during the day when he isnt working.. What does he like to do in his spare time?
What are his favorite sports? Movies? Music?

These are the types of things that you know when you are really friends with someone or when you are really in love with someone..

Its kind of like some of Will's online friends thought that I would be some little stuck up, sweet, innocent girl.
But thats far from true. I'm not a bitch but I can be, I am just being me. 

I lost both my parent when I was younger that in itself makes you grow up faster and sometimes harder.

I dont mean to sound like a bitch or anything right now.
I am just a normal 22 year old girl and I am just sharing my thoughts and feelings. 

Some days my entries will be like this, maybe sounding a bit bitchy, other days I may be sad, or maybe angry and on other days I will just share parts of my everyday life withyou all.. such as what I have done, what Will and I have done, just life in general, and some days it will be insights into the things I like and stuff.

Anyway Wills Gran may be coming to visit from England for xmas, so I guess Will wont have to send the present because he will be able to give it to her in person.

I dont know what to buy for Michael, Will's Dad, as its his birthday next month.

<b>If anyone has any suggestion let me know I will appreciate all the help...</b> 
What do you buy for a 43 year old guy with 10 children..?

Actually talking about Wills parents or at least his Mum now.. I found it really funny watching Pirates of the Caribbean.. especially with Will being Will.. Abby, Will's Mum, got a kick out of it too... lol.. Orlando Bloom as Will Turner.. lmfao.. you wouldnt believe it if I told you.. so I wont..

Mwhahaha *evil laugh*

Sometimes I dont understand Will, he brought a present but he hasnt sent it.. I dont know what he is waiting for. It will become a xmas by the time he does send it.

But I guess only he knows why he hasnt sent the present. Maybe he didnt actually know what she likes or wants and so maybe he thinks that she wont like what he got her? Knowing him its probably a teddy bear or maybe he brought her a gold bracelet and now doesnt know if she can even wear gold.

My sister cant wear gold, it makes her skin go green or black.

Anyway enough about the unsent present.

On friday we are going to become a family of 3 as we will have a baby with us.

My cousin is only 15 and she had a baby, I am unofficially adopting the baby because she cant look after it properly all the time.

Will just loves the baby and so we will be a family of 3, I think the baby will keep Will very busy.. its going to be fun to watch what happens.

I'll make a post next week to tell you all how things are going.

But just going to update this diary and then head back to bed, Will said that he will come to bed with me so that he can keep all the bad dreams away.

I really like the fact the he can work from home and that he only really has to work if a client asks for him personally.. like someone he has done good work for before..

It means that I get to spend lots of time with him unless he is out with his mates or actually working.

On sunday when the cars were racing there were about 12 guys here watching the tv.. normally they all go to Albert Park and watch it live in person but this year Will told everyone that he wasn't going and that everyone was invited over for a BBQ and to watch it on the tv.. just about everyone of the guys turned up.. Will had so much fun, laughing, telling jokes, drinking, getting excited over who was winning.. its so enjoyable just to watch him sometimes..

Maybe I will share more of the normal everyday life of Will.. the next time I update.. I'm going to bed now as its nearly 6am..

""An on line relationship is not what it seems. You feel closer than you really are; you seem to know more about the person than you really know. The experiences you share are not as deep and significant as similar experience you would have in person. For instance, you miss the body language."" 


..So Nathan and Kawena, please be careful about any feelings that you think you are having towards each other..

I can kind of understand how you can fall in love with someone on line, because like the quote above says.. you share things and feel closer to each other than you really are.. you don't have to deal with much in the way of the negative side of that person.. its easy to pretend to laugh at someones joke when they cant tell that you're really not laughing... its easy to tell someone about your life and still keep many things to yourself.. its easy to like someone online because its easy for people to be polite.. Especially when you don't see them on a bad day when things are not going well and they are yelling at everyone, or they are giving you the silent treatment..

Dealing with someone in real life is so much more different than dealing with them on line.. 
Which also kind of explains why so many people find it easy to get a crush on a movie star *smile* ...Good PR and also never having to deal personally with their annoying habits, bad moods, silly questions, or jokes.. all that everyday stuff that we all do..

You are refreshingly innocent and happy<br>with your life of purity and play. Life's a<br>game and it's a good one. In your eyes there's<br>no way to lose! You can be very mischievous and<br>have been known to cause trouble, but it's all<br>in the name of fun and not meant to really harm<br>anyone. You like to play tricks on people who<br>aren't quite as bright or clever as you - which<br>is almost everyone. Nature is the setting you<br>prefer to be in - Always. Barefoot and wild you<br>can't be tamed. You're probably a restless<br>spirit who loves to travel, and quite a<br>dreamer. Your creativity is astounding and your<br>art (of whatever media - from writing to<br>painting to drama) is like something from<br>another world - ethereal and often very<br>fantasy-oriented. You can either be a social<br>butterfly or a loner with their head in the<br>clouds - but rarely inbetween. You stubbornly<br>refuse to accept responsibility or to give in<br>to the wishes of others - unless you feel like<br>it. You have a strong passion for music and<br>can't imagine life without it. You'll grow up<br>someday, but you'll always be a child at heart.<br>You are adventurous and love to take risks, and<br>feel a deep connection with the weather,<br>plants, and animals. You prefer sunshine to<br>thunder or snow, the warmth of summer to<br>autumn's chill, and quiet forests to suburban<br>backyards. Magic through and through, you are<br>far more powerful than you seem, and are<br>capable of being extremely passionate. Though<br>you can be childish, naive, stubborn, and self-<br>absorbed, one thing is certain - life with you<br>will never be boring!

I guess that I am just a little jealous because I know that he does have feelings for her and so sometimes I just cant help being jealous of her having even a little bit of his heart.
 So I don't mean to sound bitchy sometimes but I cant help it when I am.

But everything has been going so well lately and I know that he does love me and that he wants to be with me.

The way he makes love to me and the way he talks to me and the way he holds me and the way he touches me and the way he treats me.. I am like a princess and you can just tell when someone really loves you.

I know that there are somethings he wont share with me because he doesn't want to hurt me and I understand that, especially with my jealousy, but I don't want to control him... he is free to do what he wants to do as long as he doesn't end up getting hurt.

I know I shouldn't have sent that e-mail to Amanda but I was feeling a little jealous and bitchy and I wanted to let her know that I love him and that I will fight for him because of how much I love him.

Well I'm not normally up this late but Cliff has gone out to pick up his sister who is having problems with her car and as its 2:02am I am waiting up for him to get back.. but I am going to go to the bedroom and read a bit while I wait.

So I just figured it was time for me to get myself one, now that I am a married woman I want to share my life with you all, as I am not sure what ups & downs I will have to face in my future.

I already have had to face a big problem in the form of a girl named Amanda who thinks she is in love with my husband. 

My god how can she even know him when she hasnt talked to him or seen him in RL situations so if she doesnt really know him how can she love him ??????

By the wat I'm really hoping that Cliff and I will be able to start a family before long because I know what a great daddy he will make.

By the way you may notice some times that I call my husband Cliff and other times I call him Will, but thats because this friends call him Will and only those really close to him call him Cliff because his real name is Heathcliff William Stevens but he now goes by William Heathcliff Stevens. 
So thats why he goes by both Will and Cliff.   

I so love my husband lol it still feels strange saying that."

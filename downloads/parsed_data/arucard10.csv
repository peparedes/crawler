   ""Do these hold power, do you think?"" Tabarast asked,
the black gown dangling from his fingers as Caladaster

by the way, if one day you happen to wake up
And find yourself in an existential quandry
Full of loathing and self-doubt
And wracked with the pain and isolation of your pitiful meaningless existence
At least you can take a small bit of comfort in knowing that
Somewhere out there in this crazy mixed-up old universe of ours
There's still a little place called

Albuquerque"

Fell from the roof on East Two-nine
Cathy was 11 when she pulled the plug
On 26 reds and a bottle of wine
Bobby got leukemia, 14 years old
He looked like 65 when he died
He was a friend of mine

Refrain:
Those are people who died, died
Those are people who died, died
Those are people who died, died
Those are people who died, died
They were all my friends, and they died

G-berg and Georgie let their gimmicks go rotten
So they died of hepatitis in upper Manhattan
Sly in Vietnam took a bullet in the head
Bobby OD'd on Drano on the night that he was wed
They were two more friends of mine
Two more friends that died / I miss 'em--they died

Repeat Refrain

Mary took a dry dive from a hotel room
Bobby hung himself from a cell in the tombs

And I salute you brother/ This song is for you my brother

"event","Cruisin' Mos Espa in my Delorian, 
War's over I'm a peacetime Mandalorian. 
My story has stumped star wars historians 
Deep in debate buffet plate at Bennigans. 
Rhyme renegade sure to penetrate 
First and second defense I won't hesitate.
Got a job to do and Darth's the guy that delegates. 
Got something against Skywalker someone he really hates. 
I don't give a f*ck. I'm after Solo 
For all I care he could be hiding at Yoda's dojo. 
Gotta make the money, credit's no good 
When the Jawas run the shop in your neighborhood.
Think you can cook? I got a grappling hook. 
Let's make this quick cuz I'm really booked. 
I'm a devious degenerate, defender of the devil,
Shut down all the trash compactors on the detention level.

My backpack's got jets. I'm Boba the Fett. 
I bounty hunt for Jabba Hutt to finance my 'Vette.
I chill in deep space, a mask is over my face. 
I deliver the prize but I still narrow my eyes 
Cuz my time I don't like to waste. Get down.

I'm a question wrapped inside an enigma, 
Get inside the Slave One, find your homing signal, 
From Endor to Hoth, Ripley to Spock, 
I'll find what you want, but there's gonna be a cost.
Say my name is Boba Fett. I know my sh*t is tight.
Start not acting right, you're frozen in carbonite.
Got telescopic sight, flame throwers on my wrist.
You still don't get the jist? Spiked boots are made to kick, 
Targets are made to hit. You think I give a sh*t?
Your mama is a b*tch! I'll see you in the Sarlaac pit. 
You just flipped my switch, integrity been dissed. 
You scratchin on my itch. You know I shoot the gift.
Got bambinas at cantinas waitin to lick my lusty lips, 
So I'll let you get back inside you're little space ship, 
Give you a head start, cuz I'm the sporting kind.
Consider the starting line the sneaky smile I hide inside. 
Hope you have hyper drive, pray to stay alive. 
Don't try to slip me a five cUz I never take a bribe, 
To the beat of a different drummer, bad *ss bounty hunter, 
Let no man put asunder or else they be put under, 
As in six feet. Got an imperial fleet 
Backing me up. Gonna blow up any attempt to defeat.
They got the Death Star, got four payments on my car, 
Hand it over to Hammer head at Mos Eisley bar.
He used to carjack, now he's a barback 
Just goes to show how you can get back on the right track. 
As for me that's not an option, can't say that with more clarity.
Me going legit would be like Jar Jar in speech therapy. 

My my my my backpack's got jets. I'm Boba the Fett. 
I bounty hunt for Jabba Hutt to finance my 'Vette.
I chill in deep space, a mask is over my face. 
I deliver the prize but I still narrow my eyes 
CUz my time I don't like to waste. Get down.

Slice you open like a tauntaun, faster than the Autobahn, 
Or a motorbike in Tron, do the deed and then I'm gone. 
Jaba has a hissyfit, contact Calrissian, 
Over a Colt, the plan unfolds, no politic is legit.
Back in the day when I was a slave 
Living life in the fast lane like in a pod race, 
My mean streak tweaked I became a basket case 
So this space ace split that place poste haste. 
Took up a noble cause called the Clone Wars 
Cuz life's not all about girls and cars,
Getting f*cked up in f*cked up bars, 
See I'm not a retard or gay like DeBarge. 
I'm large and in charge with a face so scarred, 
A cold black heart that's been torn apart. 
The Sith wish that they had a dick so hard 
Cuz it's long, long ago in a pussy far, far. 
Call me ""master,"" cuz I'm faster than Pryor on fire 
I no longer have to hot wire. 
I'm a hunter for hire with no plans to retire, 
And all the sucka MC's can call me ""Sire""! 

My backpack's got jets. I'm Boba the Fett. 
I bounty hunt for Jabba Hutt to finance my 'Vette.
I chill in deep space, a mask is over my face. 
I deliver the prize but I still narrow my eyes

You've got a fire burning inside of you. Vengeful<br>and bitter, you've been hurt in the past, and<br>don't plan on forgetting it soon. This may seem<br>like a bad thing, but really, you're just<br>holding others to the same high standards you<br>hold yourself. And when somebody crosses you,<br>they'd better be ready for a storm. You may be<br>in the habit of keeping negative feelings<br>bottled up inside you, brewing up to a bursting<br>point. Are all those grudges really directed at<br>who you think they are, or is it just bad<br>energy trying to break out of you? Getting<br>angry is a natural part of the grieving<br>process, and if it will help you move on, anger<br>can help you. Just remember to move on once<br>you're done.

Got to hang out with my favorite girls back home, so that was good. Got to hang with my friends from school too. Marisa was in town, and she stayed the night with me at home, then she came and stayed at Eastern too. We had a really good time. I love you girl! I'm so ready for the semester to be over, I want summer time soooo bad. I need vacations. I want this summer to be filled with them. Gotta start workin though to make some money. I want to find a new job, that has to deal with kids. Anywho have any suggestions, let me know. WEll I'm off to take a shower!

Wait scratch that, it's sad when you have people to talk to.....but you have to think about how they'll react to what you're telling them. It's too bad when you have something to share, or need advice but you don't wanna ask it, or tell it. Why? Because people are doo doo heads, and will just fuck up your mood. But anywho in other news, my life is just going great! Not too many complaints, break is coming up next week! Tell me this, is it sad that I don't really wanna.....wait I'm just gonna stop myself before I finish that statement. Use your imagination, and if you really know me, you'll be able to fill in the blank, lol. Well I'm off to shower, and head to bed! Peace Out!

Kelly called me to wish me a happy birthday. Went on my floor and most of the floor was awake and they all sang happy birthday to me. It was cute. Went in my room and Kelly had leftmy gift on my bed, and that was cute. Megan gave me my gift too, so that was nice. So then Thursday, my actual birthday I just spent the day chillin and checkin facebook. Facebook makes you feel really special on your birthday, lol. Friday came, Kelly went home so that was kinda sad. I thouhgt that my friends and I were gonna go to the movies later that night. We go to Yasmins house and all of my friends were there. Turns out they had planed a surprise party for me all week. It was really cute. I've never had a surprise party before,&nbsp;so that was exciting.&nbsp;Kelly came back and made his famous drink that everyone just loves. Drank a lot, and it was so great. Had a blast. Big thank you to Justine, Missy, and Paige for callin me!! lol, that was really fuuny. Saturday Annise came up for a minute to give me my present. That was fun. Left and went to the mall with Rhonda, and Alicia. Didn't do much last night. Today I'm just chillin, still haven't showered, guess I should do that huh?</P>

And thats how my break is goin! Still got a good 2 weeks left I do believe. Marisa leaves on the 31st!!! I can't believe it. She will be gone for good this time. Her mom is moving to Atlanta, which means she will not be here for breaks, no Marisa in the summer. She is really gonna be gone. I am so sad about it too. Ugh, it's all good though I've always thought about moving to Atlanta when I got older, and thats just one more positive thing to add to the ""why move to Atlanta"" list. Well I'm off now. Probably gonna go to bed, or stay up and download music. HSC night tomorrow ladies!! Don't forget!!

Didn't manage to see anyone this break, wait I take that back. Saw Kelsey and Adam A. That was nice. We went up to Northern, and that was cool cuz I got to see lots of fun people. But then it got gay real fast, and I realized that I just don't need to go back there, lol. I've had my share of Northern, next visit won't be for a minute. Over the break I got some new boots, so thats fun. Was bored pretty much every night, but it was all good cuz I just got on the phone. Thanks, Fred, Kelly, and Annise for keeping the break entertaining. Uhhhh came back after the break and that was nice. Megan and I decorated our room, and it's so full of Christmas. I love it! Had to go back home on Monday to go to my cousins viewing. Spent the night at home again, and had the funeral on Tuesday. I can't take this anymore. Saw lots of family that I hadn't seen in a few months so that was nice. Ready for Christmas, oh man you just don't know. Christmas brings happiness, adn I could use a bit of happiness in my life right now. I dunno, I'm just feelin a lot of mixed emotions and I could use something happy in my life right now.

"event","What a great weekend. After such a crap week, it's really what I needed. Friday was of course the day that HARRY POTTER AND THE GOBLET OF FIRE came out. So Megan and I had plans to go see it and meet Annise there. So then at the last minute Kelly & Greg decided to join us. So that made the trip extra quality because they are so fun. Went to Wendy's before the movie and waited for Annise. Met up with her then we went on in. That movie was soooo WONDERFUL in ever single way. Can't wait to see it again with the HSC, oh lord!! Movie started at 3:30, but we didn't get back until like 8:00 because the bus systems are cool. So when we got back Chenae had come to visit and was waitin for me in the eateries with ""the fam."" Went to this variety show and that was fun. Went to Gabes with Teri and Alicia for his birthday. That was a bit fun, had some nasty ass drink that tasted like cough syrup on ice. Left there and went to the ""chicken coop"" with some friends. Got in the clouds as Teri would say, and it was pretty much a quality time. Laughed at everything all night, it was funny. Next day woke up and got clean, got dressed and just chilled. Later that night Kelly, Fred, Chenae, Teri, and I took a cab to Annise's dorm. Met up with her Donna, and Erica then we walked to club OZ. The place was freakin packed and it was so annoying waiting outside. The bouncer ended up shutting the doors and said it was too full inside, so pretty much we wanted to cry. So then Kelly and Fred leave and next thing ya know we see them inside at the coat check. We were like ""whhhhaaaattt?!?!?!"" so Fred signals for us to go to the back. So we run to the alley in the back, and snuck in. Got in that bitch for FREE so that made the night even better. It was soooo freakin hot it was a shame. Went in with my hair straight and it was down. Came out with a curly ponytail, I look a hot mess, lol. I danced with some pretty fun people, and the night was just great!! Left OZ and walked to Jimmy John's and ate some yummy sandwiches. Went back to Annise's dorm and waited for a cab. Ended up getting a creepy cab river man, but it was alright. Today I'm just gonna chill I think and do my homework. Oh man, but the weekend was amazing and it's really what I needed!

"event","So yesterday the crap side of Rachel came out in full swing. Had a real shit day. I just kept getting annoyed with pretty much everything that everyone was doing yesterday. Mom was being gay, almost started crying on the phone. Why? Cuz I'm gay and when I'm in a crap mood thats all I wanna do. Didn't get much studying in for my Georgraphy test so I know I failed that. The day wasn't good until the very end, and even then it was still shit. Snapped on my friends and that's just not cool. Made people feel dumb, oh lord. Thought today would be a new day, but no. Psych test was on Tuesday. Actually studied for that test, results were posted today and I still did shitty. I swear no matter how hard I try I'll just never succeed in that subject. So I've decided that I'll work at Meijer for the rest of my life. I mean I've already been there for four years, why not my entire life? I'm hating this cold weather too, it can kiss my ass. Annise and I made a plan to go to Mexico and just smoke weed, get drunk, and have sex with hot men like Diego Luna. I'm looking forward to it. I wish that over this damn break I could go home and relax and enjoy my non school time. But I'm gonna be working. Oh but wait, they never called me back. So the schedule is probably already made, and I won't be on it and then I'll have no money. So pretty much everyones gifts for Christmas will be from the dollar store. Let's see I also have a big project due in English when we get abck from break. And since English is the ONLY class that I'm doing wonderful in I can't slack off. Plus I love that class. Well I'm off now to go fail some more in pretty much everything, you all have a nice day.

~*~*~*EDIT*~*~*~
Oh wait, here's one positive thing. Harry Potter comes out tomorrow. But with my luck the bus systems will breakdown and I won't be able to go and see it. Or the busses will work, but all the movie screens will start to malfunction.

Even though my hair looked a hot mess when I left, it was well worth it. that would probably be the highlight of the weekend. Yea, that and Big Boy on Friday. It's so great to be back in Ypsilanti. I'm sure everyone who reads my lj is tired of me saying this but....I just LOVE college. This place is so wonderful. Marisa is coming home for Thanksgiving now, and I'm sooooo excited now! I may even ride with her mama to go get her, but only if my parents don't have a problem with it. We're gonna have quite the weekend, lol. Well I guess I better go and complete my spanish homework.

Got a bite to eat at Big Boy and that was quality. Tomorrow I'm getting my hair done....YES!! Then around 8:15 Toni's for a lil bit. Goin to Ann Arbor tomorrow night I believe with Chenae. Coming home that night. Sunday is shopping/wash clothes day. Then back up to school on Sunday night!

Listen up bitches, and you know who you are. We all make mistakes, and I know that you've made plenty. I have a real problem with people who think shit is funny when it's not. Fucking get a life, get over it. You've been in that spot before bitch, and you know you felt like shit. Thinking of this right now makes me want to kick you all with metal boots. And this is me getting upset over something that really isn't that serious. But when people fuck with others that I care about, it becomes serious.

My hair was soakin when I left, and my clothes were all stuck to me. Yea, I was lookin pretty hot. Today I went to the mall with Megan, we took the bus. Not too sure how I feel about riding public transportation, the people scared me. Oh well. Annise met us there and we did a bit of shoppin. I got a new shirt, some shoes, a DVD, and a CD. And now I realized that I have about 1 dollar, if that in the bank. Well not really, but I'm just about all out of money, damn. I'm quite tired at the moment, and I have nothing to do. Was gonna go clubbin with these girls and Annise, but I don't wanna spend my money. So now I'm here on the damn computer. Everyone is gone. Teri, Vita, Mia and Alicia are all gone. So now it's just Megan and I, sitting here doing nothing. Actually we may pop in a movie, and mi amigo might be stoppin by. Well I'm gonna go now, even though I have nothing better to do.

She and I danced for 3 hours straight in front of her window so everyone outside could see us, it was so funny. Oh man, thank goodness there is someone here to be just as goofy as I am.

I've met some really fun people, and made some pretty cool friends. I still need to turn in my parking pass thing, oops. I keep forgetting, but it will get done soon enough....hopefully. So I met these two kids who are just as goofy as me when it gets really late. We had a grand time last night signing and dancing. Lets see here, what else has been going on. Not much, stalker man has gone away. I feel like an ass but what can ya do? Oh yea, I found my long lost bestest friend from pre school. We lost touch like 6 years ago, and I found her on my new love......the facebook. Oh yea, the OC last thursday, I was a fan. Glad to see it's back and running. Not too sure how I feel about Ryans hair, but maybe I can work with it. Other than that things are great, nothing can really bring me down right now.

"event","Well I got back from Florida today. The trip turned out to be better than I expected. It took us four days, yes four days to drive down there. Why? Cuz my dad likes to ""take his time."" We get there and we did all four parks, along with Universal Studios and Islands of Adventures. We went to Typhoon Lagoon twice, and Downtown Disney. It was a pretty action packed vacation. The weather was pretty nice. Very hot, but then it would storm for a good 30 minutes and go back to hotness again. No one got yelled at on this trip, so thats a plus. I was ready to come home though. Living in an RV for two weeks gets kind of annoying. Just being so close to my family for so long was really getting on my nerves towards the end of the trip. Plus I wanted to get home and talk to my friends. Annise and Katie stopped by today and we talked for a bit. Then later I went down to Annise's and we all went to get Wendy's. I'm home now, wishing that I didn't have to go into my dirty room. It's my own fault though, damn.

I really miss my cousins, which is so wierd to me. I met them, four years ago. Then we reconnected at this past family reunion. Every since I've missed them like woa. When I got home my one cousin sent me an email, so that was fun. I dunno, I just don't think that I can wait two years until I see them again.

Ultimate shopping trip with Marisa and Teri, coming up soon. I'm pretty excited. I believe we're going to three malls, AND to Mongolian Barbeque. We're getting things for COLLEGE, thats right COLLEGE. I'm so ready to go it's ridiculous.

My mom got a new teaching job. They're shipping her away to Las Vegas from the 31st until August 6th for training. Noooo, this means me, my sister and my dad for a week. Damn it! Maybe it won't be that bad, and I'll just have to work a lot. Speaking of work, that will be coming to an end pretty soon. Not quitting, just taking an ""eduactional leave"". I think I""ll start that in the middle of August, which is gettin kinda close.

RACHEL's RANDOM COMMENT OF THE DAY~ Out of the one thousand sumthin Disney animated characters, only one name is used twice. Can ya guess which on it is, I""ll give you a cookie! <--- this is what happens when you go to Disney World 3 years in a row"

"event","So Thursday we left at about 3:30 to head to Ohio for our family reunion. I didn't really want to go, and I was actually going to stay behind just so I could go to gradutaion parties. I'm sooooooo glad that I decided to go. I love my family. It was on my moms side and they are so fun. I got to know a lot of cousins that I never really talked to. We were together the entire time. I was so sad to leave this morning. Next reunion isn't until 2007, but I'm planning on visiting my a lot of people before that. My other cousins on my dads side are gonna be here on July 2nd. They live in Atlanta. I'm excited to see them. Then we leave the 5th for Florida. Oh man, don't really want to go, unless we can go to Alabama on the way home. I love southern accents. I'm really considering moving to Georgia or Alabama when I get older, oh man.

So my brother went clubbin in Ohio and got to meet Dwayne Wade (sp), and also saw frickin LEBRON JAMES!!!! OMG, and didn't even get his own sister an autograph. I was so upset, he said that Dwayne sat with he and my cousins for a good 30 minutes. Damn it, I wish I was 21 cuz I would have been in there havin a blast.

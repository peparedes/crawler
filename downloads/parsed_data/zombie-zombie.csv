all of these are things that didn't sell in my EBAY auctions the past month or that the high bidder never paid for. i decided i'd try to get rid of them this way rather than wasting more money on EBAY seller's fees.
i have like 7 boxes full of stuff that NEEDS to go, so if selling/trading on here goes better than EBAY, i'll be listing alot more & better stuff.

1. I want, I say, I do. Everybody dance now.
2. Walk close to the fence, feel it hit your clothes.
3. And what's more, they were boys with their cars, summer jobs, oh my god.
4. Daddy said you gotta show the world the thunder.
5. If a man's hands show his trade does it suit me then?
6. I'm sorry I know that's a strange way to tell you that I know we belong.
7. His glasses, the way he writes in purple pen...
8. All my friends are murder, and all my bones no marrow's in.
9. It's the one that stole your father's pride, that mighty mighty dollar sign.
10. I live in notes and photographs.
11. She will love you through your demise.
12. But does anyone notice there's a corpse in this bed?
13. I'd be chatting on the interweb...
14. Does her mother smoke?  Or does she jog every morning?  Does she drink when she thinks about me, or doesn't she need to drink?
15. So you say you like my shirt (I like your shirt).  And you say you've got a lot just like them (I've got a lot just like them).  And I hear you wrote a song about me (La la la la).  By definition a crush must hurt, and they do.  Just like the one I have on you.  
16. Who's the real sucker?  When they create you and then hate you for surviving.  No thanks to all the fair weather motherfuckers. 
17. Why can't we talk again?  Oh, why can't we talk again?
18. If it ain't your love...I want blood from you.
19. It's 1 AM, it's 2 AM, it's 4 in the morning.  Did I think she'd be here?  I fooled myself again.  I think I did.  I think I fooled myself again.
20. Forever a sleepwalker.
21. Most guys I dated got intimidated so now I date up.
22. I'll wear glass shoes and plastic wrap.  No, I'll just wear my insides.
23. We're all searching for something that you're never gonna find if you live in America.
24. So sneakers or flip flops.  I'm starting to panic.

"event","so last night was pretty awesome.  i haven't slept at all for the last few nights because of nightmares, and matt was super cranky because of work.  somehow we managed to pull it together to go out last night.

the night started at a dinner party.  a few friends of anna-lisa's live in boston now as well and had a potluck type dinner.  we were late going over, but it was okay.  we only stayed for a few hours, ate some delicious pie, and chatted.  for a room full of people that didn't know each other, it was surprisingly not that awkward.

we left around 10, and i convinced ann and matt to go with me to felt to see e for explosion play.  we had so much fun!  there was literally no one there...so we had a run at the bar.  the band played an amazing set, and we ended up hanging out with them for another hour or so after they finished up just shooting the shit.  it was awesome, and we definitely made some friends and contacts on the west coast.  chris, the guitarist, was probably one of the funniest, nicest people i've ever met.  him and i exchanged numbers and will definitely stay in contact for sure. the rest of the band was super adorable and nice as well...although jamison was super shy and a bit awkward (why can't i be an h&m model, j? i want free clothes!  i want to be dapper too!).  he's still pretty dreamy though...and dapper, of course.  

they invited us to play a show with them in cali sometime this summer.  chris and i will work out details. so pumped!"

"event","I miss sophomore year of college so badly right now it's insane.  That year will go down in history as one of the best years ever for me...possibly THE best.  I want it back.  I want to do it all over again.

Highlights of sophomore year at NYU:

- Throwing away all of my clothes and wearing the same pair of jeans and wife beaters every single day.  I barely showered, hardly ever wore make up, and just didn't care what anyone thought of me.  It was great not having to impress anyone.  

- Befriending Suzi and Liz.  Liz quickly became my wife, partner in crime, and all around bff at NYU.  Suzi was my party time, chill hang outs, spiritual advisor and confidante.  We got through a lot and I told her so many secrets.  

- Liz M. the sometimes horrible, sometimes amazing roommate.  She was going through a depression that year and it was really difficult for both of us being in such close quarters.  But in the end, I remember the ridiculous nights watching The O.C. together, going to the market at 3am for ice cream, and talking shit about our professors.  

- Patty's spy work on our professors.  She found every myspace, friendster, livejournal, etc. account of our music history professor.  She then would take his photos and make fun e-cards with them.  Awesome.  

- My constant boy drama...that wasn't really that dramatic at all.  Everyone else thought it was dramatic...I just didn't really care enough to get that worked up on it.  LOL Dan and JC.  Ambiguously Gay Vegan!  Jolly Green Giant!  

- Josh and Suzi's always entertaining friendship.  I could sit and watch them for hours.

- The INFAMOUS PARTIES: Robert Goulet's Coconut Bangers Ball (held by Josh, of course), scaring freshman and crashing their New Students Mixer and Dance, and the ever-so-famous among my friends - THE HALLOWEEN PARTY IN WHICH I TOOK OFF MY PANTS! yay naked.

- Meeting Ryan, RJ, and Brooks...my boys.  I love them.

- The epic Saves the Day show in Brooklyn with Ryan, RJ, Brooks, Liz M., and the Long Island crew.

- The day I wore bright yellow BOOTY SHORTS to our Music History final in December!  It was on a dare from Brooks.  He asked me to marry him.

- Playing Bad Dudes with the boys, late night Taco Bell (it only tastes good at 3am), and rat city in the park.

- Doing touristy things with Meghan H.  Keeping her secrets.  Taking naps in her room all the time...AND WATCHING THE SUICIDE GIRLS DVD TOGETHER!!!!! HAHAHAHAH!!! Video vixen photo shoots and other things no one else will ever see.  

- Tattoos with Liz M.

- Baking and bike rides with Sara W.

- And last but not least, Bamboozle with Liz M. and Sarah.  Sarah came down to New York for it.  We ventured to Jersey.  We got beat up in pits, started bottle wars, got terrible sun burns, nose bleeds, injuries galore, and what not.  We counted the number of black people there (17 out of 30,000...and that's counting Liz).  Too many hilarious moments to recount or even begin to describe.  All I have to say is ""That's in tents!""




Oh, sophomore year.  How so awesome?"

"event","so, as i said in my last entry, i was bound to get sick.  i was sick all last week with the flu.  it was awful, and i had to miss work and take sick days which i did not want to do.  blah.

but i rallied for the weekend.  aka i rallied for brand new in new hampshire.  word of advice: don't drive long distances while hopped up on cold meds.  i spaced out and took a wrong exit and got us lost for a while.  eventually made it to unh.  the crowd was weird.  a mix of brand new fans and unh students that just wanted to get drunk and start fights in the crowd.  also, everywhere sarah and i went there were couples making out in front of us.  i flipped off some couple and told them they were disgusting.  they left soon after that.  haha.  

brand new was great, as always.  it was interesting to hear the new stuff live for the first time.  i was really happy that they played jesus.  that song is so beautiful.  the new song they played was really good as well.  the next record should be awesome.  

drove home in the pouring rain.  it sucked. it was foggy too, so i could barely see anything.  sarah was surprisingly calm throughout my drive of terror.  thank god people aren't really on the road late at night...i definitely drifted across a few lanes more than once.  

saw watchmen the other day with mikey.  i really liked it, even though there was some pretty important stuff changed/left out.  i think it worked well the way they did it.  if they tried to do the vagina squid in the film, i don't think it would translate well.  haha oh well.

back at work again.  yesterday went by quickly at least.  i am so tired and today has dragged on forever.  thankfully, i get to leave in a few minutes. yay!"

"event","taste of chaos was fun.  the first few bands weren't really my thing, but it was still fun.

four year strong brought in the biggest crowd.  people went nuts.  there were cops and firefighters there doing crowd control....i mean, really? 

sadly, when thursday came on like half of the crowd left.  it was all the young kids that left.  they weren't there for thursday at their best.  thursday was so good.  it was like being young again.  i loved it.  they announced at one point that they were doing full collapse front to back at the providence show.  but i just found out that that show is cancelled.  if was still on i'd probably try to go.  full collapse is such a great album.

anyway.  the rest of the weekend was pretty chill.  i started feeling crappy yesterday, and it still hasn't let up today.  at least we have a snow day so i don't have to take a sick day.  hopefully, i'm not getting the flu."

"event","the past few days have been really great.  thursday was paper and ridiculousness with matt and ann, which is always fun.  they are my favorite people in the world.  friday was awesome getting back in touch with old friends.

saturday brought band practice, though we were missing murray.  he is currently sick and recovering.  regardless, we had a great practice as a trio.  then matt, ann and i went over to downtown concord and had a really nice dinner at helen's.  i absolutely love helen's.  it is so cute.  it's like an old fashioned diner but without all of the filth.  then, we all headed back to the apartment and i read some more of my amazing book.  then, we called some people and found out there was a party at shannon's place.  so we rounded up the troops and all carpooled over.  the party definitely had a strange dynamic, and i didn't really know many people there.  i ended up hanging out with mikey for most of the night.  even though the vibe of the party was a bit awkward, people started up a pretty ridiculous round of karaoke.  drunken karaoke.  which i found hilarious because i did not have one drink that night.  

yesterday was a fun day as well.  had a hard time getting up...it sucked.  got picked up by mikey and we headed out to townsend so he could take pictures at the grist mill.  it was really warm out so i decided to wear flats...BAD IDEA!  warm weather = melting snow = puddles and MUD EVERYWHERE!  mikey had a fun time laughing at me after mud got inside my shoes and caked to the bottom of my feet.  after the grist mill, we ended up driving around to random places and hanging out along 2A.  got lunch, mikey made fun of me some more because i barely could finish half of my wrap...whatever.  headed to lexington and got candy, mikey made fun of me even more for buying ""old lady candy"" (charleston chews are awesome, ok?).  eventually got back home, where i found that matt and ann had abandoned our dinner plans.  oh well, i hung out in the bathroom read my book while washing/soaking my muddy and cold feet.  matt and ann got home later, and we all fell asleep while watching flight of the conchords.  we are amazing. 

now, i am at work and drinking a digusting mix of hot cocoa and black coffee.  wonderful."

getting up this morning was surprisingly easier than i thought it would be.  apparently being out all night and barely sleeping suits me.  i was also hyped up on caffeine at the time though, so that probably had some sort of effect.

therapy tonight. then hanging out with ali and julie.  it should prove to be really fun.  though i have no clue what i want to talk about in therapy...none at all.  blah.

-mario kart for nintendo ds
-books! 
-the most ridiculously gorgeous winter coat.  my mom even took off all of the button and sewed on vintage military buttons from the 60's.  it's long, trench coat style.  so pretty.

i'm probably forgetting some other small things...but overall it was a great haul.  i had a lot of fun buying stuff for people this year.  i went a little overboard with my spending, but it was worth it to see everyone's happy faces when they opened their gifts.

I should move here!""  

Anyway...the real point of this post was that James totally slipped and announced that The Get Up Kids are doing a reunion tour in Spring 2009!!!!  He was all, ""I'm gonna get in so much shit for saying this.....but we're totally touring...""

SO EXCITED! That pretty much made my life.  You have no idea.

Also, my brother made the best comment about Leathermouth ever.

Matt: ""Um...why do these girls like the singer?""
Marya: ""'Cause he's from My Chemical Romance.  And he's totally pretty...no lie.""
Matt: ""Really?  I just think he looks chubby.  But I guess it makes sense that you would think he's attractive since you like fat guys.""

AHAHAHAHAHA.  It's sad, but true."

YOU'RE AN ASSHOLE AND I HATE YOU!  i put up with your shitty attitude because you are cool for brief moments of time, which you then shatter by talking shit about bands i like or things i'm excited about.  ssooooo glad i'm leaving this shit hole of a city. 

annyyywaayy.  finals are approaching.  holy shit, this is the last time i will ever have to take finals at nyu and potentially for the rest of my life (if i don't end up at law school in the future).  i have to be an adult now.  i'm definitely not ready for it..like..at all.  

can't i just marry some hotass dude in a famous band and live off his money?  and have awesome sex all the time?  and release my own album because of my semi-fame?  seriously, god, make this happen for me.  that's all i ask of you."

"event","I met Chris Carrabba on the subway going back to my apartment from Brooklyn.  It was kind of hilarious.

I had gotten on the C in Greenpoint after hanging out with a friend, and was by myself.  At night, I always have my iPod on so I can ignore rude comments or questions asked by strange men.  I try to tune out as much as possible and look tough (haha...I give people dirty looks so they don't sit next to me).  After a few stops, a bunch of people got on the car.  Immediately, I could feel that someone was staring at me.  At first, I didn't want to look cause it's just better to ignore people, but I couldn't help it.  So, I looked up and saw this kind of short, attractive guy staring at my arm (aka my tattoo).  Then, he noticed that I caught him looking and we had this really intense eye contact for a minute or so.  I thought he looked familiar, but I could place it.  Finally, I got up to move towards the doors to get off at my stop, and I ended up standing right next to him.  When I got a close up look, it finally dawned on my who he was.  As the train was coming to a stop, he looked over at me and said ""I like your tattoos.""  I replied, ""Thanks.  I'm sorry for asking, but this will bug me all night if I don't: Are you Chris Carrabba?""  He smiled a bit awkwardly, and quietly said yes.  Then, we both said goodnight and went separate ways out of the street exit.  The whole walk home, I couldn't stop laughing about it.  All I could think was, 'I used to be so in love with you when I was 14, but now I kind of think you're a tool!'  

Anyways, I saw Lauren on my way back and told her of my awkward encounter.  I am officially her hero.  

Oh, New York, why do you do these strange things to me?"

"event","So Christmas this year was pretty amazing.  It was an emotional one.  My Babci gave my brother and I her most prized posessions basically.  Those things included Navaho jewelry that my grandpa got in the 40s, a gold ring (for me) given to her by her best friend, and her first engagement ring (the one from the guy she was engaged to before my grandpa...) went to my mother.  We all told stories and cried a lot.  This fall has been hard on the whole family.  We've all had a lot of personal drama on our own, and then the combination of all of it was a bit overwhelming.  Everyone has some sort of mental/physical issue going on.  Mine are mostly emotional, aside from being extremely sick through all of november and december.  I think my emotional stress is actually what made me physically ill.  But things are a bit better, even if my life is really confusing right now...

For new years, here is my resolution: I will finally get over him.  I will let myself fall in love for the first time ever...no matter how much it hurts, or how much I wish I had control over everything."

"event","So my life is insane right now.  School is okay, but hella stressful.  So many papers, projects, and midterms.  Kill me.  Or better yet, shut down NYU so I don't have to deal with this crap anymore.  Whatever...I'm graduating this year anyway.  Meh.

So Sarah came to visit me and it was amazing!!!  We basically shopped all around Manhattan and Brooklyn like all weekend, and had a really ridiculous photo shoot in Central Park.  Haha, we're awesome and you love us.  Ps - Candy cigarettes are the shit.  I need to go to Dylan's Candy Bar more often.

I've definitely been in a manic period the past two weeks.  I can't describe the feeling other than that I don't feel connected to my body...like my head is missing.  All the stress and being sick and running around is getting to me.  I need to calm down...and maybe take many peoples' advice and go see a therapist.  Being told you're probably bipolar and doing nothing about it for 4 years can't be healthy.  

Buuuttttt, on a good note: CMJ = AMAZING!!! Woooo!  NYU did something good in my life and gives my major free badges every year!

Here is a list/review of everything I saw:

Jesse & Vin from Brand New acoustic set: Fantastic!  They didn't play Jesus, which was sad but they pulled out Moshi Moshi!  They hadn't played it in forever and Vin kept messing up.  They also compared Vin's high note in the song to the ""John Nolan wail.""  Hilarious.  Oh, and some kid yelled ""Fuck TBS!"" during the show and Jesse was like ""Is that kid from '99? I think he came here in his time machine.""  

The Meat Puppets:  Hot, sweaty grunge.  The drummer looked like Kevin Spacey.  Weird old men dancing = heartsssss.

Mates of State: Adorable.  She's pregnant again.  Played mostly new stuff which was pretty awesome.  I was a bit sad they didn't pull out any of Solo Project, but oh well.

The Narrator:  Friends from Chicago.  Completely wasted.  Throwing beer.  Dancing their pants off.  Having to set up their mics after every song cuz some drunk dude would knock them over.  All and all....jfkdl;ajfd SO GOOD!

The Color Fred:  Fuck TBS!  Haha.  Oh, Fred.  I love all of your lovely songs about how you hated being in TBS and can now go home to your family and be a dad.  Adorable and totally emo, but in a good way.  Word to former Outsmarting Simon members.  

Leathermouth: Fuck shit up!  Haha just kidding.  The crowd was all girls...which was...weird?  I dunno.  I'm not used to that many girls at a hardcore show, but it is Frank from My Chem, soooo...  Oh well.  The band was really good.  Definitely the least sloppy of all the CMJ acts I saw.  Haha.  Plus, I felt more at home in the crowd there then I have here in New York for a while.  

New Amsterdams: Only saw a few songs.  Matt Pryor = Love.  His son was on stage playing with instruments and had huge headphones on.  jdkls;afjd SO CUTE!

Saves the Day: Acoustic style with Chris and Dave.  They played Take Our Cars Now, so I can die happy now.  Basically, I will always love everything that Saves the Day is, was, and will ever be.  (Oh and Chris saying ""Sank you!"" and ""Tanks!"" after every single song made my life.)

And that is all!  CMJ is over and I can actually sleep and get work done!  jfdk;afd

Back to reality."

sometimes i wish i took more chances.  i wish i wasn't so guarded.  i've ruined some relations with people this year that could have been really great, and i have no one to blame but myself.  i push people away so i won't get hurt, but then i just regret not having tried.  i seriously need to stop being so indecisive and make a goddamn choice.  i need to trust people more.  not a lot, but just more than i do now.  i could never give anyone full trust, other than family and few exceptions.  

i have a lot of great things going on with me right now, but i can't help but not care.  it's rather disgusting actually.  things are finally looking up, and i just don't give a shit.

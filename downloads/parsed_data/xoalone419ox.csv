"event","Soo.. I have been repeatedly yelled at for reviving my Journal and updating it only once, and since The Race is on that means I will not see the likes of Chris for another four hours therefore I have nothing to do. It may seem like my journal isn't important but that's only because, well it's not entirley that important. But it's mostly just because procrastination is my calling and with that as my main focus for every day I don't really get 'normal' things done that I should so how could I possibly make room for the Journal? ..Understandable? ehh But I am going to try try try and remind myself.. forgetful-ness that's a problem too! Are my excuses overloading yet? Okay so anyway.. the last few 10 or so days..
My Dad is on VACA at Scroon Lake, and of course I am not in the company of my many drunk uncles and himself in No-where'svil and my sister is in MASS because, well life loves her soo much more than me =]P soo I am staying at 'Anne's' because I just didn't really feel like being held up with my mother.
Speaking of Anne she has been kind of MIA lately.. but whatev. There will most likely be ruinion soon.. I'm hoping.
And now speaking of ruiniting... I officially start my Sophmore year as well about 75% [if any] of the people who read this on the sixth. boo.. But who knows maybe there will be lots to talk about with the new school year, and however there could be no time but try try try I will =]. I feel very unprepared, like literally. I got some supplies but with no list.. I wasn't really sure on what to do and I havn't really gone clothes shopping which is truely sad I might go on Tuesday which I HATE because I deff. didn't want to do it the day before school again but of course, that's what I 'm gonna do.
I had a little medical scare this past like week, but it wasn't as worse as thought and infact it was basically what I thought all along even though the doctor told me I was probobly wrong. Things are better now.. I just dont ever want to have to do that again, it was kinda scary.
I am gonna also try and finish that blog tonight I will most likely post it both here and on Myspace. I have been working on that forverrr, ever since I stole it from Anne, haha. I really wanna get it done though.

So that's about it I guess.. obviously might be another post later and soon I am taking a trip to McyD's with my babbby : D. I love hearattacks for dinner.

Wow, it's been quite awhile hasnt it? Soo.. Chris decided to revive his Journal so naturally i was told to do the same. But now he is mad because mine is prettier. =]P Life is sooo hard sometimes when you have an ugly ugly Journal. haha, anywayz summer is almost gone which means so is my life. That is quite depressing if i do say so myself. It is also quite depressing that i am at my sisters house and the AIM keeps fucking up and everyone is YELLING at me which is really not that necessary. Gah, im so bored. Tomarrow i am getting my navel piercing.. yesssss. && i am hopeing to get my hair done before school so yeah im pretty much gonna rock the house.=]P

Once on a yellow piece of paper with green lines
she wrote a poem
And she called it ""Rex""
because that was the name of her dog
And that's what it was all about
And her teacher gave her an A
and a gold star
And her mother hung it on the kitchen door
and read it to her aunts
That was the year
her sister and him got together
And her mother and father kissed a lot
And a boy from school sent her a 
Valentine signed with a row of X's
and she had to ask her mother what the X's meant
And her father always tucked her in at night
And was always there to do it

Once on a white piece of paper with blue lines
she wrote a poem
And she called it ""Autumn""
because that was the name of the season
And that's what it was all about
And her teacher gave her an A
and asked her to write more clearly
And her mother never hung it on the kitchen door
because of its new paint
That was the year her sister started smoking
and thought she could hide it from her
And the boy at school laughed
when she asked him to go see Santa Claus
And the kids told her why
her mother and father kissed a lot
And her father never tucked her into bed at night
And her father got mad 
when she cried for him to do it

Once on a paper torn from her notebook
she wrote a poem
And she called it ""Innocence: A Question""
because that was the question about herself
that nobody would answer
And her teacher gave her an A
and a strange steady look
And her mother never hung it on the kitchen door
because she never showed her
That was the year her nephew was born
with tiny tonails and no hair
And she caught her sister
alone, in the house, with boys
because he was in jail
And her mother and father never kissed
or even talked
And the boy in school
wore too much cologne
That made her cough when she kissed him
but she kissed him anyway
because that was the thing to do
And at three A.M she tucked herself into bed
because her father wasnt there to do it

That's why on the back of a brown paper bag
she tried another poem
And she called it ""Absolutely Nothing""
because that's what it was really all about
And she gave herself an A
and a slash on each damned wrist
And she hung it on the bathroom door
because this time she didn't think
she could reach the kitchen

.. renewed it for moi :)



life is kinda sucking.
but he is the only thing that matters.






if im gonna go down
i'll do it in style
you wont hear me surrender
you wont hear me confess
because you've left me with nothing
but i've worked with less

Especially the last 4 ones which have been <b> AMAZING! </b> Thanx to Christopher aka <b><font size=""3"">THE LOVE OF MY LIFE!!!!!!!</font></b> But that is always what seems to happen in the school months I never remember anything about school up until Christmas because it seems like those months just fly right by. But after Christmas is when i associate the things thta happened with that school year. Whenever i remember anything about the school year it never has anything to do with those months unless i try. Wow i dont think i am making about any sence right now... o well. But yea i dont think i will be forgetting anything about these months this year ... they were incredible. 
And Christmas is going to kick <b><font size=""3"">so much</font></b> fucking ass this year!!!!! Wow like you have no clue... i am going to finish my shopping todayyyyy! And omg i am getting like 'the bestest most amazing incredible gift in the world.' and i 'wont believe it, it is so amazing.' So yea pretty pumped about that one. 
Uhhhh i gave my Dad my X-mas list... [ didnt give my mom one.. she actually knows who i am so she doesnt need me to tell her what i like ] and yea i want like nothing for Christmas this year haha. I really only wanted like 2 things and that was to get my tounge peirced (no i dont suck cock STFU!!) and my hair done. My dad said he would make an appointment for my hair but i have to wait till next year for my tounge *tear* i dont know why... he gave me some really stupid ass excuse.. i think he thinks i am too young. Even though i got my belly button peirced at like 11 lol. And BTW i am getting that done again... but not till im 16 i think so it doesnt get fucked up again like it has the last 3 times. god what does a girl have to do around here to get a belly ring to stay in?! :p

"event","Yo,

 This past week has been busy yet uneventful at the same time, know what i mean.. ? I only had 2 days of school because Tuesday was election day and Friday was Veterans Day which we got off but i had to go to a stupid-ass parade that i was deprived of any food of substance and it was freezing so needless to say i was just about ready to take out some pedestrians with my flag because i was not in a very jolly mood. Then Wednsday I went down to NYC with a whole group of like 20 people from English and sculpter class. hmm... people worth mentioning are :: Samantha , Kevin , Amanda , Feona , Jackie ..and i think thats about it for people from English. 
OMG it was so awesome we went to the Metropalitan Meuseam of Art and it was georgous and then we saw Hairspray... ooo the greatest. Like it was just awesome the whole expierence of going to see a Broadway play and it was just soo awesome, and funny, ... and Kevin got smacked in the face. Poor fuzzy :p. Even though i was mostly sick for that day i still had an amazing time... i cant wait to do something like that again. 
But other than that this week has been mostly uneventful. I have to spend like the whole day doing homework because i need to catch up on like 3 days worth so that should be a blast and a half. 
This morning / Last night an eskimo sold me pants... that was fun ;)And there is 3, oh yes i said 3 days till Chris and I's 3 month... hmm 3 days 3 months.. look at that. Ooo i am just so happy i could punch you in the face. No, im just kidding, i would prolly hug you, because i am hApPy! Things are really mostly going good and i am just so thankful for that, i just hope things dont get too good... cuz we all know what happens when any amount of joy is brought into Kims life.. yea so hopefully no eskimos will be moving back to Alaska or anything like that.
Oh, and sence when did the unspoken rule come into effect that i have to update my journal before Chris updates his.. i mean really, wat is up wit dat?! If you think this is unjust as i do i welcome a protest! ....anytime now.. anyone?

"event","You are priviliaged to be reading my first entry on my new computer that ..(gasp!) works!... and (double gasp!) doesnt suck! As i see the livejournal world has gotten along perfectly fine without me for however many days its been sence ive had a working computer....(i had stopped counting at 4568521308437 days of death). Hmmmm so whats been goin on, School still sux, although its tolerable, DrAmA is overrated so people general just need to grow up i mean seriously its only the end of october and i have already been plotted against, lied to more times than i could even count, been 'hated' by a best friend...its like destruction is attracted to the center of my life. Uh, even with all the shit in and outside of school i have never been happier in all my freakin' life! Although i was banned from Chris' current household because unknowingly my welfare has been indangered it still hasnt really affected us. Things are just..... wow, no word even does the situation justice because how i feel about it, and us, and him is just indescribable. I am infatuated with sooo much love *sigh* so life is pretty good. Its funny though cuz like life could be going to shit and it prolly wouldnt phase me with thde state i am in.. but its not so thats an extra bonus i guess ;). There is just about 17 (count 'em 17!) days till our 3 month which is very cool if i do say so myself because well yea it just is, you dont really have to understand because i dont really understand so just go with it lol. Ok guess i should stop rambling about that topic 0:), anywhooos.. Holloween is in like a few days I have to march in the parade in my costume ([SuPeRgIrL] -- you betta reconize! lmao) then after im still not quite sure what im doing.. although i know what i prefer to do. Well not much else to say i guess - oo! i got a cell phone *dances in a circle* although everyone who reads this (or lack there of)prolly knows that i just wanted to add it in anyway. *301 - 0050* call me and entertain me because we all know i wont be entertained. And I got a new puppy! (once again prolly already known) her name is Lady Jasmine 
Elizabeth and she is a pure bread Beagle. I know, be jealous ;). Hmmm but i think thats about it for my welcome back to the actual world of the internet. I will wrap up my entry with this ::


<b> I think you know what im getting at </b>
I find it so upsetting that
The memories that you select
You keep the bad but the good you just forget

And even though im angry i can still say
<i>I cant believe i let this happen....</i>
And all this time i never thought
That all we had would be all for not

<b>No, I dont hate you
Dont wanna fight you
Know, I'll always love you
But right now i just dont like you</b>

<i> You took this too far </i>

Make your decision and dont you dare think twice
Go with your insticnts along with some bad advice
This didnt turn out the way i thought it would at all
You blame me, but really <b> this is all your fault </b>

I tried to move you
But you just wouldnt budge
You tried to hold my hand
Wouldnt you rather hold your grudge?
<b>I think you know what im getting at...
<i>YOU</i> SAID GOODBYE AND I JUST DONT WANT YOU REGRETTING THAT!</b>

.. and we all know who thats for ;) ..







**And it's that feeling I get everytime his face comes into view. The way my body <i> tingles </i> when he touches my skin. It's the way he loves me. <b> It's just him. </b> Anyone else would be completly wrong. He is my little peice of <i> heaven </i>, my place in the stars.**




_- ~ Why is it, that at the touch of your hand i feel no pain?
_____And your voice can cure even the slightest hint of sadness?
_____Why is it, that when you kiss me all my fears go away?
_____And every moment i am with you is perfect?
_____Why is it, that when i thought i could never love before...
_____You make me love a thousand times more ? ~ -_

^^yea, that one, all me^^ *blush* 0:)

Sooo nothing much has gone on in the past however long its been sence i have updated. Death is in two, yes i said TWO days! and i am bracing myself for a long, painful year. even though i will get to see anyone i am dreading High School and i dont feel like dealing with drama this year... i think i pulled more than my fair share of that last year. in fact i dealt with so much drama last year i think the only fair thing to do is to relieve me of drama for the rest of my school career. but ya know... life just is never that easy. and the whole fact that fate hates me... yeaa so i dont think that, that one small favor will be granted to me. i just bought my bookbag today and i am sooo color corodinated go me! i am getting the rest of my clothes tomarrow with my mommy and thats that. wooow i have nothing to say haha. uh... yea TOM??? i only know one Tom and he is a much better person than you will ever be and he happens to like me as well so i dont believe you... but that was a nice try though ;) . so how bout you say who you acctually are... because then you wouldnt have to look like such an ass lieing and such. or you can just keep things the way they are with your whole dissapearing act, cuz i happen to like it that way. well i guess that i have run out of things to ramble on about i dont know when the next time i update this will be... but hopefully it will be soon.

"event","OOOOO, the concert was AWESOME!!! Omg, yea, totally had the most fun i have had... all summer!? .. possibly.. most likely! Well yea so Avrl's openeing acts were Gavin DeGraw (booo!) and *Butch Walker* (..drools) So yea we all didnt know who Butch Walker was.. we thought he was like some hick country singer.. so we hated him before we even were at the concert. And then before he came on to play the video for the song 'mixtape' came on the big screen and i was like i know this song!! and there was a boy in the video and he had an emo boy hair cut and i was like oooo <i> i love him! </i> and so was everyone else lol. So then at the end it said Butch Walker and me n Sam are like if thats him we will die! 
And then he came out on stage AND IT WAS HIM!! And he had his emo hair cut and tight pants!!! <b> |[ !!! i heart emo boys in tight pants !!! ]| </b> So yea he was AWESOME. And he had really good music. So after he got off we ran to the FYE booth to get his autograph but the line was like 5 miles long. So we had Sam con her way into the line so we could get in and it worked! And then like 5 people behind us they cut the line off and said that no more people could get his autograph and we were like yesSsSsSs!!! So then we get up to right before you go into that lil maze-thing they make with the metal blockers and the guard stops lettin people through and we were flipping out. And im like are we getting his autograph and the guard goes no but your first in line for Gavin (who was already playing by the way) and im like WTF!!! we dont want fuckin gay-ass Gavins autograph we want Butch's!! and the guard is like im sorry... So yea then we got outta line and went back to our seats and had to litsen to Gavin but Shay touched his hand so that was kool. Then Avril came on and it was AMAZING.. ooooo it was sooo good! We were rocking out like nobodys business! haha. So close to the end she covered 'All The Small Things' and then like 5 min later she came back and was playing the drums and BUTCH WAS ON STAGE AND HE WAS SINGING ME N SAMS SONG!!!! So yea then we realized it was fate so we decided to share him hehe. Then for her last song she played 'Complicated' and it was over and we were sad.. but then we were happy because it was such an awesome night! Ahhh i has sooo much fun! Well that was my day yesterday ... oo maybe i can get my daddy to bring me to get the Butch CD today.. idk. Well i am soppose to be getting dressed and cleaning my room right now so i can go to Chris's ..but when we made plans to do that i was trying to get the computer to work then when we got off the phone it started to work.. and it was just really bad timing on the cmputers part.. so its not my fault, really. ;)

"event","Woah.... a lot has gone on recently... and my journal has been in the crossfire. it would be kind of exciting if it wasnt all a bunch of bullshit. so yea i am updating to catch up and reply to all the recent events. 

Yeaaaa so to the stalker/psyco freak/asshole/jealous commenter -- i have not updated because my internet explorer wasnt working not because i was 'afraid'. i mean really.. how gay is that?! Ok, also sence when was i apart of the club that couldnt keep a relationship.. i was not even aware of this club. do we have jackets?! i dont know how i got endited into this club because i have done nothing that shows i cannot keep a relationship.. so i dont know how your fucked up mind warped itself to that point but.. once again your off. i mean really if your going to insult me (or chris for that matter) at least give us shit that is true, i mean c'mon dyke and fag?! first off its un-original and its weak, second off we all know thats not true. it is clear your lacking creativity and intelligence so i dont understand why you continue this.. really your just humiliating yourself and showing how worthless your life really is by checking up on our journals every hour by the hour to see what 1st grade remark you can try on us next. seriously, your pethetic. 

ok, anyways back to things of any importance, um this week has been... mostly un-eventful lol. Marching band a lot. and the last day of summer drill was reallllllly fun! and i got to find out SAM IS COMEING TO THE AVRIL CONCERT ON SUNDAY!!!!! which i am still exstatic about.. if anyone was wondering. wow, i think i might die without her!! <33333 i mean we talk on the phone and everything, but its not the same, sooo i cant wait to see her! uh i went to phils party tonight that was kinda entertaining lol, im glad i went. hmmmm.. why dont i ever have partys? yea, tomarrow i am possibly getting an outfit for AVRIL! hehe wow i am so excited. if not i will get it on sunday, thanx to my wonderful procrastination skills. ooo and i got the Dashboard Confessional CD, which i am <b> in love with </b> !!! but i gt one of the old ones (hint* entry title *hint) b/c the new one was too expensive :'(. but hopefully i will get it soon. well i guess thats it cuz not much has happened but i will deff update if not before sunday then right after... cuz ya know i am going to have something to talk about.. we all know how things like this go ;). so i am off to read Chris's new entry ...... eww aim just dissapered on me :(

Ok, now that im done with that .. hmmm i went to the movies with Chris on Saturday ... movie sucked but i had fun, i always do. And Chris gave me a Care Bear he won for me at the Great Escape resulting from a not-so-selfless gesture, but i still love it anyway. Then today/yesterday (sence it is technically monday now) i did nothing except watch Summer Slam which was pretty entertaining even though it was one of the suckiest pay-per-views i ever saw. then at like 11 i walked to Annes, where i happen to be now. Tomarrow, well, i am soppose to hang out with Chris, but i also kinda sorta have plans with Kevin and i have to go to my moms soooo i guess i will just have to roll with it lol. Uh, i am trying to fix my myspace because it is utterly gay so i hope i get that done. Well thats all until the next update i guess ... make sure you check back ;)

"event","Riiight soo today i bummed around Mirandas house and then i went to the mall like a bum and then i walked home. Eventfull yep... thats what i thought. Past few days... well nothing really sucky happened so thats a plus. Actually it was a few good days hehe ;) Uh... marching band is kinda stressful but i still love it except for the fact that Brokke wont be back until after Summer drill and so that kinda sux.. but i will get over it. Yea lately people have like no faith in me whatsoever .. no one that really matters but its just like what goes on with me personally is none of anyone elses buisness unless i choose to include them in it so when people think they can judge me based on past events it like is kinda ironic to me because usually the people who are judging have no right to be saying anything remotly negative about me because they have their own bridges to burn but whatever it is actually kinda amusing to me but like yeaaa.. so thats that. I just hate judgemental people ya know, they have no reason to think these thngs about me, their not in my head i wouldnt expect them to understand, they dont know what the fuck i have been through. So poeple should just keep their lil side comments to themsleves and if they dont have the commen desency to do that at least say it to my face.

"event","Well, life is just full of surprises isnt it? Yea... i hate dirtbags. But anywayzzz today.. well today i pretty much did nothing. I hung out with April for a lil while and then i came home and was denied the right to any justice in my life because my father is a difficult evil dictator. O but i did talk to Sam today... it was for like 2.5 seconds but i am grateful for that 2.5 seconds. I hope she is still going to Orientation on Wendsday ... its mostly like neccessary for school but there is a good chance her mom wont let her... i miss her so0o0o. i still have to give her, her birthday present 2! Well tomarrow Marching Band starts up again... im such a loser cuz im kinda excited haha. Thats about it i guess .. check back of course.

*** O, and to the pethetic excuse for a human being who keeps commenting on Chris's journal i think your wasting precious air for everyone else. I mean really is your life that sad and pethetic that you spend your days like that.. i bet it took you all day to come up with those remarks. And on top of it all you decide to remain a 'secret' douche isntead of acctaully saving what any remaining dignity you had left. Well I DONT CARE WHO YOU ARE if you think people arent waiting for you at night with carnivorick weasles, your dead wrong. Even if you are the person you might be ...i will personally show you how much you should regret being the asshole you are.

"event","Wow... yea that pretty much sums it up.. just fucking wow. Well 2 days ago I went to Shaygna`s birthday party... that was pretty kool. Sam was kinda ehhh but it still was fun. Yesterday... well yesterday included :: lies, fear, psyco's, tears, cops, Miranda's house being searched, more tears, screaming, accusations, almost losing 2 very large parts of my life, seriously i never thought i was going to stop crying, groundation, killer fathers, a lot of stupid ass questions, and all we did was go mini-golfing and then bowling. Funny how life works out isnt it?! No, i didnt think so either. Summer is almost over so all i can say is what a way to start off the new year. So anyway the rest of this week should be intresting ... i wonder how long until Sam see's the light of day. I miss her already :(

Yea so to amuse myself for like the 16 hours i was online like last night I went through Chris's entire journal... cuz i was just that bored. Does anyone wanna make me some poptarts....?! That would be SOO awesome... im not hungry but its the thought that counts ;). Yea i am not hungry which is strange because i had like 3 bites of ice cream yesterday and i havnt eatin sence sooo i think im  going crazy.

"event","Well, its been alomost 2 weeks sence i have updated this thing but i gotta say not much has gone on. Wow thats sad, i aint got a damn thing to write about haha. Slept over Mirandas on Friday... and that was just peachy. Got hit in the face with a baseball, o yea that hurts. I started flipping out cuz it hit inside my mouth and I was yellin at Miranda tellin her how I was gonna have a hillbilly smile. Anne was sopposed to be with us but her Dad is a douche grrr! Me and Anne have been getting a lot of heat sence the concert cuz we have kind of like dedicated our lives to Green Day and besides the radio (rarely) thats ALL we litsen to. You think im exagerating but im not I have 4 cds in my player right now.. there all Green Day. So yea me and Anne like breath, eat, and sleep Green Day. Were pissing people off, its kinda funny haha. But its really fun to have someone as into somethin as you are and me and Anne have really gotten close because of it and I am so greatful for that because she is such an awesome person and I would die without her haha. Also sence everyone like hates us for it, its kinda like our own thing... its just really awesome except when people are bitching about it. I dont see whats wrong with im not hurting anyone and the only time I REALLY talk about Green Day alot is when Anne is with me and then were just talkin to eachother not other people. Whatever, I love Green Day to death you all can kiss my ass! hehe :) ..Well anyways im thinkin about startin like a blog on 'my space' or somethin cuz i just think it would be kool and i could share all my shit i have saved on my computer cuz i have some awesome things on here! Dont worry it wont all be about Green Day but i will prolly have a section for Billie cuz he is the bestest person alive!     Awww...   
...ok anyway back in reality, hmm, might make a new sn cuz i am soo bored haha. Well i guess thats it. 
I WILL update soon trust me lol.

"event","Well i tried to update yesterday but my computer sux ass and kept kickin me off so im juss gonna post the same as i would have yesterday because im lazy and dont feel like changin it lol. (just to avoid any further confusion)


Yesterday ---


Today was my birthday!!!!! (juss thought i would start off with that lol) It was a really nice day and i had lots o' fun lol. Well to start off i ended up wakin up like 9 times after 5 in the morning cuz me n miranda didnt go to sleep till like 1 and we were on the floor so i was rolling around and finally like at 8 i decided to take the couch instead. So when i woke up for good around 10 miranda was already up like she usually is and then she made me breakfast :) ! So yea then around 1 sam came down and we hung out with kevin then me n miranda went home for a lil then kevin called again (after sam had already showed up again after that and left) and we went to burger king and sam showed up AGAIN lol (on purpose). So after that the 3 of us hung out at my house until my mom came and got me n miranda and kevin had to go home. So we picked up sam and went on a shopping spree with my birthday money. So yea that was pretty much my day. Cant wait for go karting on saturday its gonna be a blast!! 





Today nuthin much happened but well see how it goes. Should update soon!

"event","~Fire burns up the pain
Eats away the memories
Faster, faster little girl
Oceans falling from your eyes
Faster, run now, little girl
DOES THIS COME AS A SURPRISE?



~There is no hole in a heart than one made by two who are one, yet worlds apart. There is no pain as great as seeing the one you love hurt like earth, when it does not rain. 
There are no tears as big like the ones that fall to the pillow before a lonely nights sleep.
There is no sacrafice as a great like one for love when its selfless and unassuming. There is no love as strong as the love that endures the pain of a broken heart. There is no emotion so genuine as that of laughter when it is seen is a persons eyes. There is no sensation so revealing as that of touch, especially when it touches a soul.
There is no war as a war faught inside oneself.



~My head wrote love letters.
I wore my heart on my sleeve,
it shattered against the sidewalk.
I put myself together,
and i still remember.
Scared of who i was before.



~Swallowed in this darkness, now will drown.
The ocean isnt pretty anymore.
With the stars she's quickly falling down,
when she wakes her body hits the floor.
She wonders if wings can really fly,
cuz everytime she tries she falls away.
She's not the one whos face the mirror sees.
And deep inside nothing is what it seems.
But in her eyes this broken figure stands.
She wipes away the blackend tears she cried.
And shows her scars of beauty in his hands.



~I think i may never get that picture in the magazine, but i am somebodys. Or else why would I be here



~You know how to pick at the string,
that vibrates my trust.
Im no angel, those wings were ripped off
a long time ago.
I refuse to wake up with eyes,
filled with the sorrows of yesterday.
I've given up, on shattered dreams
and lifeless wings.
Sailing on tears - between us and the ocean.



~Just a quick reminder, I've always been nearby.
I've heard your silent screams,
and all your empty sighs.
You're always in my head, i know the air you breathe.
Theres not a single tear I've missed.
Please, see the scars i took for you.
And let me hold close that broken part of you.
I know your hands are fragile;
I've held them a thousand times.
I've felt your fists of hate with your secret crimes.
Please stop and see me now,
know i will never leave.
See my arms that reach for you.
Let me whisper my words of love to see you through.
Oh, dont you know? I ache so much more;
And i could take the place of those lies that you adore.



~I wonder if you let him love you because you thought someone else did not.



~Inside of me there is
A heart broken and torn to many times,
Trying to find the true meaning of love,
A soul tired and shattered,
Almost too weak to try again,
FEAR
Not knowing how to let go










Some of my newest favorites ^^^ I love those


Ok well i guess i havnt updated in awhile sence my last update was around easter. Well not really much to talk about to much has happened in this like, month i guess to go into much detail. Todays was really intresting though, not gonna say anything except WHEN A SHOE IS CAUGHT ON A FENCE IT IS REALLY HARD TO GET DOWN! Well anyway this isnt really an update i guess just wanted eveyone who checks this to know i was alive... plus chris updated his so that motivated my lazy ass to update lol.





P.S
5 DAYS UNTIL MY BIRTHDAY!!!! :D

"event","Well yesterday was just a blast and a half. Sam slept over for the first time ..ever! And on her first time it was very interesting lol. Well first we went shopping which was an expierence in itself and then when we got back to my house Kevin called. We ended up hanging out with him, Kyrsten, Mike, Zack, Sean, Jess, Brittany, and maybe like one or two other ppl i didnt know. When we started hangin out it was at like 8 and so we were just foolin around in front of Lansings school playground. Well low and behold a whole group of like 4 or 5 preppy guys start waling up the hill and course they start somethin. So after me and Sm had been talkin trash for a lil we went and got Phil. After we had started gettin into another big thing with them before we know it the cops show up. Well at the time it was kinda scary but nothin really happened so now it seems hilarious lol. So after that we went back to Kevins and it ended up juss being Kevin, me, Sam, Mike, and Phil. Then we watched the ""Superman"" cop (the same one that had talked to us before) get his car stuck in the mud as he tried to drive through west end. We went home around 10 and when it was time to go Kevin gave Sammy a really cute easter present. Then today after me and Sam went to the animal shelter we hung out in West End for like 2 hours. Kevin was kinda refuged up in his house lol. So for the rest of today I dont know what Im gonna do Sam went home (tear) and I think Im going to go to Mikes party if everything works out there.

"event","Urg! Monday I have to go back to school nd i just really dont want to. I also have to write my english paper which is a pain in the ass. Well today I went to see Hitch with my Dad and Sam. At the end me n Sam cried lol. People keep telling me it was not sad but apperntly I felt the need for tears. Then came home and me n Chris hung out and watched The Notebook. I cried like 3 times during the movie, and trust me there was a DEFFINITE need for tears there. Me and Kevin also had a much needed talk, I kinda have mixed feelings about that 1 :/. There is also bad news seeing as Anne might not be able to come woth me to Greenday but hopefully we get that all setlled out cuz I would hate for that to happen. Tomarrow I dopnt really know what is goin on I am gona try to see if I can go tanning but that prolly wont happen because well.. it just prolly wont lol. Oh yea and today after he left my house Chris almost got hit in a car crash... just thought I would add that in there lol. Nothin much more to say might update tomarrow, might not... you'll just have to check back and find out ;)

"event","Yesterday Me and Miranda went to Sam's house. O boy that was an adventure in itself lmfao. Somehow we got to fighting over a bouncy ball and then Miranda and Sam teamed up and Miranda came after me with 2 hairbrushes (which I took captive and used against her lol) and Sam... well she got a 4 foot plastic pole and almost broke my knuckle lol. After that we played 'volleyball' Me and Sam kicked ass together lol. When me and Miranda went back to my house my mom took us to get my straightener!!!! We were soppose to sleep over April's but that did not happen so Miranda went home. Today I finished straightening my hair (it took like 3 1/2 hours last night lol) I love my hair so much more straight hehe I am so proud of myself. Anne has presented a problem with tanning because she apparenlty walked to the place and used the wrong kind of lotion which made her brake out in like a rash kind of thing and her mom said she can never go again and well she was our ride lol. Hope my mom will bring us.

So today I am goin over to Thomas's (AHAHHAHA) house with Phil and Erica and I am very exited lol. I will be sure to post about this one ;). Tomarrow I dont think I have any plans besides to try and go tanning and dance class from 6:30 - 8 so anyone wanna do sumthin? Havnt hung out with Chris in awhile... hmm *ponders*

"event","Ok well yesterday I slept over Mirandas and that was a very intersting expeierence as always lol. Got like 2 hours of sleep and we had breakfast at 5 am and it was grilled cheese! Now you know you want some of that lol. Then up until like 2 we half slept on her couch watching t.v movies lol. Then after much scamming and convincing Me, Miranda, and Anne went tanning! My FIRST time hehe. Of course had some tramatic moments but those are not for sharing. It was so awesome cant wait to go again, but Miranda and Anne make it extra special ;) lol! If I dont go again tomarrow I am 'sneaking' over to Sams so she dont have to be 'alone' lol. That should be fun as well. Cant wait for the rest of tonight always a blast with MY MANDERS!!! haha she hates that. Thats about it... nothin has really happened sence i started this thing again lol i got such bad timing.

"event","Well the party was great. It was at Diamond Billards which was kool cuz i got to learn to play pool (for the 4th time) lol. Me n Sam played video games for like the first half before learning pool.. mostly i kicked her ass lol j.k she got in a few good wins ;) Me, Sam, and Shawna also were having a tickle fight which resulted in Sam locking herself in a bathroom stall so that was interesting and then Shawna gave me a piggy-bag ride hehe. Shelby taught me how to play pool and i suck so its all goood. I got Kevin the Linkin Park/Jay-Z CD and he really liked it so that was awesome, the packaging was a skull and cross-bones bag which i had a few issues with lol. Overall i had a good time.... ands that about it for today lol

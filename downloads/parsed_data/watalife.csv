I have to type this in CS cause IE is being gay.
Christmas was cool. I got this big purple matalic pillow n a small pink squishy one :D!!!! I got the SP CD....it has a CD n a DVD side wich sucks cause now i have two sides i have to worry about scrathing. :(. My brother got GTASA. IT ROCKS!!! I'll tell u the plot.....

U are this dude named CJ (or Carl :/) n you came to San Andreas from Liberty City because ur mama got killed buy an enemy gang (shes not in the gang her children are) so you come back for the funeral n shit. But there are these cops that would always bust u when u lived in the hood. So they arrest u for the fun of it n take all ur money. so ur broke. when u get home u find ur bro n ur sis. but the gang members dont really appriciate u. u have to do missions to earn respect.....thats pretty much it. cept now u can ride bikes!!!!! in the other 2 u couldnt. n u get to go to the gym n work out. it rocks real bad. lol. but they say a lot of swears. like in the first mission Ryder ( one of the gang members) goes ""Keep up u mother fucker!!"" n they say it constantly. but hey they live in da hood so......we havn't unlocked the dildo yet :( lol!!


well now its time for the funny moment of the day. The following is a very funny experiance me and tara had at my house :DS (this is probably y no one wants to come over my house or have my brother babysit them )

My mom has just asked my brother to help my sittter with her homework. my sistter wont cooroperate.

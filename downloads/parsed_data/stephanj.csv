"event","Hey all.  Not to much going on here.  Just woke up bout half hour or so ago.  I signed off AIM for the first time in 3 days and 22 hours today.  I installed a firewall and it had to restart the computer.  Oh well, I needed to resign on anyway, so I can have two sn's on at once now :-D.  Anyway.  Not to much has happened since the last update.  We ate at the Stone Bar last night.  Some of the best food I have ever had.  I got Beer Batter Shrimp with Rasberry Horsheradish sauce for an appetizer, and Sautead (sp?) Crab Cakes with Romalaude sauce as a main course.  It all was insanely good.  And when I got the strawberry cheesecake, it was all decorated fancy and made really nice looking.  I was impressed :-D.  Got home around 11.30 almost 12 prolly.  I stayed up pretty late, did some stuff on the comp.  Chat room with Uno, Nikki, and Dave.  Dave and I were bringin memories of old convos we had.  Good time, Good times.  Oh yeah, yesterday the cable guy came, and now we have digital cable in the upstairs living room.  We only had it on the downstairs before.  Ahhh, tech tv on the upstairs popasan chair.  Or the Foof couch.  Not sure what I'll do today.  Maybe work on the programming stuff some more.  I only have a month to write that program for my stepdad =-o.  It wont take me long though.  Dave and I were tryin to figure out a good Halo 2 clan name last night.  Its either gonna be One Red Dot {.:-ORD-:.} or MIJB's {M.I.J.B.} <--(mofo's :-D).  Not sure wat well pick yet.  For right were MIJB's for life.  I guess thats all for now :-(.  Not much more else to talk about.  Guess I'll update tommorow.

I'm gonna have to put some of the videos up to, because I was almost in tears watching some of them.  Hysterical.  I didn't realize how high my voice really does go up, especially when I get balltapped, lmao.  I saw 'Day after Tommorow'  yesterday while the rents saw the new Harry Potter (I can proudly say I already saw it :-D).  Day after Tommorow kicked some sweet ghetto booty.  We went over to the old house yesterday to get the rest of the computer junk in the basement.  I pulled out one of the Apple IICs we had.  Its setup in my room now :-D.

<p>So awesome.  Gonna do some oldschool programming on that POS.  I found a program I wrote in 5th grade.  It asks for your name, and then prints on the screen ""Name, you smell like Manure!!!"".  Ahh, the maturity level of a 5th grader.  Gotta love it.  Just cleaned up my room, cause I'm such a good son.  Not really sure what I'm gonna do today.  Joe and Ange better hurry back from NC.  I'm getting bored.  guess there ain't much more I can put, I might update tonight.

Started it up and EVERYTHING worked.  The Video drivers installed perfect, no prob with audio (cept Winamp, thats being gay), Internet loaded right up.  I already got bout 30 songs back on here, along with WMP 9, Quicktime, XBConnect, AIM, Opera, and itunes, all working perfectly.  Doesnt happen often.  Anyway, I'm a little bored.  Not sure wat time my parents are gonna be home, probably not till later, so if anyone wants to come over and have a party, its cool.  Yeah, then I would shot.  Just downloaded Itunes with Quicktime today.  Its got all these online radio stations.  Surprisingly, they stream smooth as hell.  Double Click and they instantly start playin.  I don't know about the delay of actual playing, but who gives a shitzle.  Well, I guess thats it for now.

The DiBellas left for NC today, gone for like a week, so I got nothing to do next week, tell me if someone wants to hook-up and do something.  I'm prolly gonna format my hard drive today since my computer is a worthless hump of crap at the moment.  That means I won't be on today for the most part.  I don't really think I have that much else to say.  If everything goes smoothly, I should be up an running by 3, but thats if I can get everything working (the format goes well, Windows 2000 goes smoothly).

I really REALLY should get a new computer, but whatever.  This one runs, its got AIM, and the net.  Im happy enough :-D.  Besides, I built it, so its got some sentimental value (even though I'll prolly build the next one too, and make it look a lot trippier, YEAH!).  Pretty funny convo with Andrea on the phone last night.  The best was this.  We were just talking, and then stopped, so I figured the next thing she said, I would yell shutup as fast as I could.  So its quite, and then all the sudden, Andrea goes SHUTUP and without thinking i yelled it right back.  Quite hysterical.  Oh, and I'm talking to dave the retard, check this out:

"event","Just wokeup not to long ago.  Going with my mom to an auction at 10, got nothing else to do.  Just got back from Texas on Monday.  Joe and I spent 12 days there.  Kicked so much ass, no one even knows.  We didn't do a huge variety of things, but what we did, we did a lot.  Most people would go on vacation and would want to go out and do stuff.  What did we do?  Put in a good 4-5 hours (much more on some days) of System Link Halo, then about an hour of the pool everyday.  We did some other stuff too.  We saw Chronicles of Riddick, kick ass movie right there; ate at hooters (awesome wings, holy crap); went ice skating in an enormous mall (it had all these designer stores, girls would prolly love it, i thought it sucked for the most part :-D).  I ate meat for everymeal, drink bout a gallon of milk everyday.  Hmm, what else, I ripped my pants completely open playing DDR at a party, oops.  If anyone cares bout the Halo games (which really was a majority of the trip) the teams were one of these usually:

- Me and Dave v.s. Dan and Joe
- Me and Dan v.s. Dave and Joe (pwnage in l8r games)
- Me Dave Gija v.s. Joe Dave Shady (<<Longest halo game I ever played, 3 1/2 hour Invasion CTF, dan had 220 kills!)

It seemed that me and dan were the best team.  At first we got our asses handed to us, but once we coordinated ourselves a lil better, the 2 on 2 Chill Out TS's were ours :-D.  Also, I have to admit I was rocking the Casba with shotguns no shields.  I got so many double and triple kills, but my highlights were my first killtacular (which ended up being a double killtacular), and then my regular killtacular.  I was very pleased.

Anyway, geek in my got a lil caried away.  Yesterday i basically just sat on the comp all day.  I played some Gran Turismo 3 with my stepdads new Force Feedback Pro racing wheel. Very fun.  I played some connect with Dave and Dan last night.  Most of the day I just read up on some xbox mod stuff.  I also broke up with my girlfriend, but I really don't want to get into that.  I guess I'll update tonight bout what exciting things went on in my life today.

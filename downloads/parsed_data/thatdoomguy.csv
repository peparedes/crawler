"event","We leave sometime Saturday to head to the condo in NC.  It's going to rule - it's right on the beach, it's only a half hour from Myrtle Beach, it has a private pool, and it's in an uncrowded area.  This is our first real vacation since Disney 2 years ago and I'm excited.  My brother and Steph are going with us, and sometime during the trip we're visiting my mom.  I have to figure that out still, since she's at the tippy top of NC and where we're going is way at the bottom.
I originally requested Sunday off from work so we could leave then.  My boss called me a few days ago and asked if I wanted Saturday off too.  Sweet deal.  So I only work tomorrow.
Nearly a week on the beach.  I need it, I really do.  I've been pretty stressed the past few months with work, bills, school, etc., etc...


Memorial Day was pretty chill.  We headed down to see some of Annie's family and pick up the condo keys.  After that we took the lovely drive through the Pine Barrens to visit my family.  We had a small cookout and then walked the Ocean Gate boardwalk with my brother and Mr. Dawe.  Afterward was Dairy Queen black cherry vanilla goodness.


The site is 95% complete.  All the places pages are done; just have to make up random crap like the links page.


I'm still not over Archie choosing Veronica over Betty.  That's one of maybe three instances where I'd pick the blonde over the brunette.  Veronica's a prissy richy bitch.  Betty's the good natured, down-to-earth, plain, pure, girl-next-door type.
Why do I care this much about comics I haven't read in like 20 years?  I just think this decision brings the wrong message to kids, I guess.
Bah, I still think he could've pulled off a menage a trois.
There's a good message, kiddies.  Can't pick?  Bang 'em both.
Utilitarianism, my friends.  The greatest good for the greatest amount.
Or something.


Anyway, off to find geocaches and site-worthy places to add to the trip itinerary.  You can bet your ass South of the Border will be appearing in the near future.  That place is the epitome of tourist trap."

I'm embarrassed to admit tonight was the first time I ever saw Bambi. Up until today, I thought Bambi was a girl. How many strippers and porn stars are named Bambi? I thought my conclusion was logical.
...anyway, I thought the movie was ultimately pointless. What's the plot? A year in the life of a deer. You get the full circle, circle of life nonsense. There's really no plot or point. His mom dies, his deadbeat dad comes in once in a while, and other animals say stupid shit.
The supporting characters serve no purpose. Thumper teaches him some things and is just there to be annoying really. Flower is in the movie maybe 2 minutes total. When the 3 reunite, it's for maybe a minute until they all ditch each other to get their dicks wet.
Heh, sounds like my group of post-high school friends.
...anyway, is it me or did Flower either get a sex change or turn straight? Flower sounded like a girl and was flirting hardcore with Bambi when they were kids.
*bats eyes* ""He can call me a flower if he wants to. I don't mind."" *flirty holding-your-feet-kinda-roll-thing*
And...her name is...Flower. Come on.
Then we get to adult Flower, and what-the-fuck-that's-a-guy's-voice! What the hell happened to the flirty little skunk batting his/her eyes at Bambi? Either s/he hit puberty or flew to Thailand to get injected with testosterone. I thought Disney fucked up and put the wrong skunk in that scene. Surely that female skunk that shows up in the adult part is Flower, right?
Right?
No?
Oh...alright then. Not confusing at all. Just gonna act like the bromance never happened.
One way or another, Flower bats for the other team now.

Way back in early October we went on a mini vacation to New England, visiting 9 places total.

To start off, we went to a ghost town in southern New Hampshire, <b><a href=""http://www.stuofdoom.com/monson.html"" target=""_blank""> Monson</b></a>:

<img src=""http://www.stuofdoom.com/monson3.jpg"">


We camped out in Maine overnight, then spent all day there.  We happened to be at the campground run by the owners of the <b><a href=""http://www.stuofdoom.com/desert.html"" target=""_blank""> Desert of Maine</b></a>:

<img src=""http://www.stuofdoom.com/desert4.jpg"">


Down the road were 2 roadside oddities.  First we came across the <b><a href=""http://www.stuofdoom.com/fbi.html"" target=""_blank""> Freeport Big Indian</b></a>:

<img src=""http://www.stuofdoom.com/eartha3.jpg"">


We then headed to <b><a href=""http://www.stuofdoom.com/narrows.html"" target=""_blank"">The Narrows Observatory</b></a>:

<img src=""http://www.stuofdoom.com/narrows9.jpg"">

"event","After a few weeks of constant homesickness, I finally paid the old OC a visit Monday-Wednesday.  It was nice seeing everyone for the first time since August (still can't believe it's been that long already) and doing all the stuff I do whenever I come down.  It was not nice, however, to see even more stuff (including Good Luck Farm) demolished and even more unnecessary clone stores and strip malls being built on every square inch of free space.  Every time I go back down, the place dies a little more.  One day, the area's going to completely lose its identity and be nothing more than a wasteland of chain store sprawl.  And it's spreading.


As of Tuesday, I've been with Annie for 5 years.  I can't believe it's been that long already.


School is getting old really fast.  Only 2 weeks in and I'm hating this ""learning team"" nonsense.  If I knew we had to do group projects for online classes, I probably would have not gone back.  First off, I don't do group stuff.  I work on all my stuff alone, always have.  Forcing me into a group is not going to make me a squeaky clean, ready-to-make-an-educational-video-on-teamwork kind of guy; it's going to make me crabbier and even more of a hermit.  Secondly, group work is bad enough, but group work over the internet?  That's just a recipe for disaster.  Finally, why the hell do I have to do group work for one of the most solitary of professions there is?
I hate relying on others.  I hate knowing part of my grade is at stake if some idiot turns in their part late or just doesn't do their work.  I hate my cocky ""team leader"" who I suspect was the lone male cheerleader at some point in high school.  I hate that I'm being whined at for not participating in group discussion when there's nothing due group-wise for another 2 weeks.
I would much rather write a 2500 word paper alone than do a 500 word section and have to clumsily piece it together like a poorly made Voltron with four other people who I'm likely never going to actually meet.


I came to a lovely revelation Monday night - life would be much more exciting if it had mini games built in.
""You're going to bed!  Spin the wheel to see what your prize for the night is!""
""Flip over 2 matching cards and get free overtime!""

Man that would rule."

"event","For the first time in my life, I saw snow before Halloween.  We got about half a foot on Tuesday and then a bit more early Wednesday.  I didn't even get time to rake the leaves yet, man.

School started up for me on Tuesday.  Nobody bothered telling me that my first course was going to be yet another pointless business class - which ultimately is a ""lol Powerpoint"" class that does nothing but repeat over and over to be professional in professional settings.  No, really?  I hate not knowing what courses I have until the day before.  I just wish there were more options.
On the plus side, they were kind enough to accept my math credits.  Initially they were going to force me to take college algebra, but I guess that 94 in statistics changed their minds.  If I can find sigma or theta, or if I can use a t- or z-score chart, I can damn well find x.
So the first class started Tuesday.  I had my entire first week's homework done by Wednesday afternoon.  If I can keep up that pace, this won't be as bad as I thought.
I don't think it's sunk in yet that I'm finally a junior.  Only took 6 years or so.

Last Halloween I was in court with my seller.  For this year's, I'll be doing my weekend/delinquent/camping thing.  One of these years I'll actually be able to do something for the holiday.

I'm thinking of going down to the old OC either this upcoming week or the next.  Depends on homework, money, and whether or not I feel like driving nearly 3 hours after driving around all weekend.  I've been pretty homesick for the past week, and I haven't been down there since the end of August, so I think it's about time.  I'll be down for Thanksgiving too, but I don't feel like waiting that long.

When I moved up here, I was worried my site updates were going to lag.  Now I have the opposite problem; I did a count and I have 16 places in queue.  All the stuff from our camping trip, the New England trip, and just things I've found here & there need to be posted.
And I'm sleepy.  All the time."

Yay, I start back up the academic life today.  Finally a college junior.  I'm not looking forward to classwork again at all, but at least it gives me something to do instead of sitting around wishing that I had something to do, which I've been doing a lot lately.
Funny how the day I head back all my loan companies send me mail informing me that my deferment period is over.  I don't think so!
Back to balancing book stuff & class stuff.  Gonna get burned out from sitting in front of the computer too much again.  But at least this time around I don't work in front of one.


Rock Band is very fun.


I think another Jersey visit is about due."

"event","We've been doing quite a bit of hiking at work, which isn't a bad thing at all, just that I wish we had some time to recuperate.  Maybe make it every other week or something.  Of course, it doesn't help that I'm hiking in between as well.  We hiked on the AT 2 weeks back, then I walked all over New England.  This past weekend was 15 miles or so.  Then today I went caching up in Mountaintop.  Granted, it was only 2 miles or so, but it was all uphill.  Oh well, beats sitting in a cubicle.  Plus I found ruins.

To blow off some steam the other night, I did some nighttime caching.  This particular cache was Halloween themed and had pumpkins and skeletons attached to the trees.  To find the path, you have to go at night and look for cateye reflectors on the trees.
Along the way, I saw something small and black up ahead of me.  With the flashlight already half dead, I figured it was a skunk.  Getting closer, I noticed its ass was aiming at me.  Now if you're on a trail at night and a skunk's ass is pointing right for you, you know trouble's going down.  I began to back off when I noticed it had no white on it.  Upon closer examination, I also saw the thing was spiky.  It was growling lowly; skunks do this hiss/snort thing.  Turns out it was a porcupine, somewhat curled in a ball and with its quivers outstretched.  So damn cute......and stabby.  And wouldn't you know it, it was the one time I didn't have my camera on me.

The tree that's been slowly leaning toward my house is no more.  Doc came over and chainsawed that sucker down, along with another one that was snapped in half.  There's one more dead one up on the hill a bit, but it's no threat to anything.  I'll get it eventually.

I'm seriously contemplating looking into what it takes to adopt, but I have no idea where to start looking.

Ever so slowly working on the book.  I think this week I've written a whopping 200 words or so.

School starts back up on the 28th.  Not looking forward to it.  Sucks that I have a solid 2 years to go.

I forgot to mention last time that I drank Moxie and lived.  Next time you're in Maine, pick yourself up a bottle and see how long you can last.  I still can't believe the stuff at one time was the top-selling soda in the country."

"event","So last weekend at work, we hiked all day Saturday - from 10 AM til some time after 4.  Not sure how many miles we covered, but we did come across some fun spots along the Appalachian Trail, including the aptly named ""Knife's Edge.""  Then, because it could, it rained on us both nights.


As usual, New England was fun but too brief - we left 5 AM Monday morning and came back midnight on Thursday.  It'll be some time before I upload pics, so for now a brief summation will have to suffice, dear reader.
First up was a ghost town in southern New Hampshire - not too far from America's Stonehenge, actually.  Not overly interesting, but alright.
We then headed to Maine.  I'd only been to Maine once before, and that was way back when I was looking for colleges in my junior year.  I still wonder how much better off I'd be had I gone to Machias.
We camped at the Desert of Maine, and next morning we got to tour the desert for free.  We saw some silly sights in town, like the 50' Indian and the one-millionth scale earth, and then we headed up the coast a bit.  There we went up a 420' tall observatory and explored an old fort - first time I went somewhere that actually encouraged visitors to bring flashlights.  There was also some stupid ""cursed"" tomb nearby.  We ended up camping out in the White Mountains of NH that night.
Next morning we backtracked a bit and headed to the ""World Traveler Sign.""  We passed several towns that had some sort of relevance to The Dark Tower, like Gilead, Stoneham, and Lovell.  Then we headed to Vermont to see the flavor graveyard at Ben & Jerry's factory.
During all this silliness, I found 12 geocaches, bringing my total up to 600.
Damn.  I've found 600 geocaches.  Sad thing is I know people who are well past that number.  I envy them.


Damn McDonald's and their Monopoly.  In 3 days I've eaten McDonald's 4 times, always looking for that elusive Boardwalk - or any piece that will complete a set really.  Does anyone really win?  The cups and tray sheets say they do, but who knows anyone who's actually won anything other than a free small soda or fry?  I always think those people labeled ""last year's winners"" are really from stock photos.


School starts in a bit over 2 weeks.  Not looking forward to it.  To be honest, I'm not even sure why I'm going back.  I'm not sure of a lot lately.  Bah, I'm too moody.  I probably should be on meds.

My jaw dropped when I saw ""like new"" was the reason why it was ended.  I've seen that used and have used it myself countless times.  Never once did I see anything saying it was against the rules.  And I had no option to take the words out.  If I knew they weren't allowed and I had the chance to edit the listing, I would have.  Better yet, if this was such a big deal, they could have done it themselves.  But nah, fuck it.  Just flatout end it.  Plus they get to keep the listing fee.  I call bullshit.

And this was my response.

<b>I find it ridiculous and absurd that I, a long time member (9 years now) am being threatened with suspension and whatever else over 2 little words.  ""Search and Browse Manipulation"" is an asinine and just utterly ridiculous claim.  ""Like new"" is a description and I don't see how it is manipulating anything.  Perhaps it may be a nuisance to a small group of people looking for new items, but that's their own fault for looking for new stuff on an auction site.

I was not intending to manipulate anything and felt I was describing the item's condition.  Perhaps if this were better spelled out in the disclaimer, this wouldn't be a problem.  Perhaps if the words ""like new"" were anywhere to be found on the Search and Browse Manipulation page, this wouldn't be a problem.  Perhaps if eBay actually enforced this nearly invisible and seemingly make-pretend rule and made it more noticeable, this wouldn't be a problem.  To me, it appears this is just another way for eBay to swindle fees out of us.  I'm expecting my 35 cent listing fee back for this auction and am not sure if I will continue selling in the future.  I don't appreciate having my auction promptly ended and losing bids instead of having the option to remove 2 small words from the title.  Being a long time member, I feel that small of a gesture could have been given to me.  Is this how eBay treats long time members?

If this was such a big concern of eBay's, then the 7539 items currently having ""like new"" in the title would not be allowed to be on auction.  I am now aware this small and seemingly harmless term is utterly destructive to the online auction world and have learned the error of my ways.  Now what about those other 7539?

Thank you for your understanding.</b>



So yeah, don't use ""like new"" in your description; some jackass looking for new shit on eBay (as stupid as that sounds) might report you."

Then today I chopped firewood & weeded the backyard.  I ache.


My ferrets discovered this week that knocking over their dig box is much more fun than playing in it.


We both finally got level 75, the highest, in FFXI last night.  I must say our level of dorkdom has also increased as well, because we celebrated with Kahlua mudslides and a banana cigar.

"event","Dakota ""the evil bitey dog"" will be put down sometime next week.  He holds the world record for biting people at this point, I think.  As long as I've wanted for this to happen, I find myself feeling bad that it actually is now.  Even though it has to be done in this case (and is long overdue, IMHO), it's terrible when something loses its life.
Even when that something is an asshole of a dog who mauls people on a somewhat regular basis.
Again, I could say a whole lot more about this situation, but I don't want to lose the other half of my family.

I sort of made a compromise with myself.  I put school off for a bit, but not for as long as I originally planned.  I pushed the start date back from Sept. 9 to Oct. 28.  This way I can get a good portion of the book done and go on my mini vacation.

Speaking of mini vacation, work and money permitting, I leave a month from today.  Where to, we're not sure yet.  Possibly Maine.  Or the Thousand Islands.

Oh, I updated my site a few days ago.  Nobody probably cares.  I don't.

"event","Since it was a holiday weekend, we had less than half the amount of kids we usually do.  And we still managed to break 2 of them.  On Friday night, one had an intense panic attack and simply would not stop crying.  It was so bad we sent him to the hospital and he left for the weekend.
The next day, we went on a hike along the Appalachian Trail.  A good half hour or so into the trail, a kid twisted his ankle.  We first had him use us as crutches, but he quickly started whining that his good leg was getting tired.  So we took turns carrying him.  Then he began crying his arms were going numb.  I love how these are the alleged tough kids, gang members, criminals, etc., but throw them into a real life situation like this and they are complete babies.  
I twisted my ankle a shitload of times when I was little.  And there weren't 3 staff members there to help me out; I was always by myself.  Know what I did?  Hopped or crawled home.


Over the weekend I also found out Dakota attacked yet again; this would be his 15th time I believe.  Supposedly something's finally happening about it this time.  There's a lot I could say about this but I'm not going to bother.  Nobody, as usual, listened to me the entire time, and it took them 5+ years to act.

"event","I spent Monday through Wednesday down in the ol' OC.  What was originally just a run to get a couch and queen bed became 3 days of fun, trials, tribulations, and many reminders of why I miss and do not miss living at the Jersey Shore.

Monday wasn't all that interesting til night; other than finding a few caches and shooting a video of the ""Spanish Mansion"" not much was going on.  Later on, Dawe & I went to Panda Buffet then chilled at Ocean Gate.  Afterward we went to The Pub and I bought him and my brother a drink.  Last time I was in that building I was about 4.

Tuesday was one of the best days I've had in a long time.  My brother and I cached in Forked River and LBI, and somewhere between all that we went to Sonic.  I also went to see the lighthouse for the first time in a long time and hiked the trail nearby.
Later on I went to Seaside with Lizz and Daria and it was easily one of the most memorable times I've had there.  And because one night wasn't enough, we went to another Chinese buffet.  We then walked the Ocean Gate boardwalk (2 nights in a row for me, huzzah), and at the very end, this guy was watching porn on his big screen TV.  We were commentating for about 15 minutes or so until we noticed a silhouette looking out at us, and then the house went dark.  Seriously, if your back door is facing the boardwalk, why would you not have blinds or something?

On Wednesday I had lunch with Mama Nummie at the Indian buffet.  Haven't been there in a long time.  Then at long last, I got the couch and bed I came all this way to get.

So overall it was a very good trip - a lot more fun and productive than I was originally expecting.  I found 10 geocaches, 2 being first-to-finds, and saw a lot of people.  For about 3 days, life was just like how it used to be.  I was just a shore boy again.

There were downs too, of course.  Traffic, the insane amount of cops, the general nasty attitude of people, the high prices, the fact that the whole area is badly overcrowded, the astoundingly high number of idiots who drive Hummers, the taxes, even more strip malls being put up, every square inch of open space gradually being eaten, etc., etc.  Then there's the whole drama factor I won't even get into; that's something I do not miss in the slightest.  If people could only be more productive with their time.  I think they're upset I've made something of myself and they've yet to do so, honestly.  But I digress.

<a href=""http://graphjam.com/2008/08/24/song-chart-memes-people-who-drive-hummers/""><img class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-4850"" src=""http://graphjam.wordpress.com/files/2008/08/151.png"" alt=""song chart memes"" /></a><br />more <a href=""http://graphjam.com"">graph humor and song chart memes</a>


I miss my old stomping grounds badly, but I really don't know if I'd go back if I had the option.  I think for now going back once a month or two is plenty enough.


So yeah, the house finally has a couch.

Sucks I was only home one day this week though.  As the broken record skips, ""I can't believe I have to leave for work tomorrow already.""

"event","The cable was out for 2 days.  We've had random long-lasting outages since we moved up here, so I decided it was time to have the cable company come out.  Well, 5 minutes after showing up, I'm back online.  Turns out the filter on the utility pole was bad.  Huzzah, internets.


I'm finally on the last <u>Dark Tower</u> book.


I forget if I mentioned I'm doing more internets school for my bachelor's starting the 9th.


This was the busiest week I've had in a long time, and it was much needed.  On Monday Annie & I attempted to find the ghost town of Rausch Gap.  We drove about an hour away to find out that the road leading to it is unpossible in our car or just about any other.  It takes a lot to make me turn around from a bad road too.  Ultimately, the only way we could find to the town was a 3 mile long bike trail.  I'll have to go back in the fall with my bike, but at least I know where to go now.  Still sucks I went an hour out of my way and didn't reach my goal, but that's how it goes sometimes.  Took me years to find Hollow Field and Union Clay Works.

Liz came up Monday night and the next day we made the trek to Bucks County to see a number of things.  The Van Sant covered bridge, reputedly one of the most haunted and one of the original ""crybaby bridges"" is just a few minutes away from New Hope & Washington's Crossing.  I needed new pics of the graves at the Crossing, so I figured I'd check out this bridge too.  After hitting both those up, we walked around New Hope for 2 hours or so.  I used to love that place, but despite this being my first trip there in 2-3 years, I find I'm still less and less interested in it.

On Wednesday we attempted to find the mine fires in Carbondale, which was greatly hindered by lack of internets.  We found a small industrial park in the town and found this huge abandoned factory.  This would be the highlight of the trip, as we would later find out the mine fires have little to no surface evidence that they are burning.  No smoke.  No cracked ground.  For a split second, we got a whiff of that nauseating mine fire smell while hiking down a trail, but we never did find its source.  The most I saw from the one fire was the heat rising from a rock pile.  I was disappointed with the fires obviously, but the factory made the hour drive north worth it.


I'm going down to Jersey next week for a few days.  I can't believe it's been over 2 months since I've been there.  So far I have nothing planned other than geocaching.  I'll probably go to Seaside one night, since I haven't been there in quite some time.


I thought I had something interesting to write about, but it doesn't seem that way.


I can't believe I leave for work again already.  Seems I say that every Friday now.  At least this week went by quickly because I was actually doing stuff instead of sleeping and unlocking achievements."

According to PA, I never graduated high school.  Until this little hiccup is corrected, I can't go back to college.

Since the past 2 months of my life have been dreadfully boring at best, I've been looking for anything I can do to pass the time.  Exercising sucked so I sort of quit that for a month.  I picked it back up yesterday, and while doing so, I remembered I have a bike.  You know, that thing collecting dust in my shed that I haven't touched in like 2 years?  Yeah, that bike.  Unsurprisingly, both tires were flat.  Inflating them with my cheap air pump was a workout in itself.
So I rode around the development while exploring some of the side roads by the lake.  Now, northeastern Pennsylvania's terrain is much different than that of coastal New Jersey.  I've known this for a while, but I never exactly biked it before.  True, half the ride was a fun trip downhill....then I had to come back.  Needless to say, I collapsed on the living room floor when I got back in.

Last night the wife and I had a fun lil' 2 person party.  Cap'n, Jack, a honey berry cigar, and video games.  I had her make a 360 account so now we can both be achievement fags together.
Both Grindhouse movies were damn weird.  I'm sorry I missed them in the theater.

I can't believe I have to leave for work today already.  It seems every Thursday I say ""I can't believe I have to go to work tomorrow already"".  The weekend goes by rather quickly; I just hate driving 400+ miles every time.  That's part of the reason I haven't been back to Jersey yet; I'm damn tired of driving.  Considering I sit on my ass bored from Monday til Thursday, the week seems to fly by too.
I can't believe I've been at this job longer than I was at the newspaper; that job felt like an eternity and I was only there like 6 weeks.

"event","My book was the #2 NJ book this morning on Amazon.  The average time a book is in publication is 9 months.  Glad to see I not only survived that but am still going somewhat strong.


I've been jonesing for Penn State for months.  The one campus is 10 minutes away and they offer psychology.  No-brainer, right?

Oh, there's just one catch - in order to continue, or in this case, even begin their bachelors program, I need to have 30 credits from them, effectively knocking me back into associates territory.  Meaning the whole last year of my schooling would be tossed out the window.  Meaning essentially I'd have to get 2 degrees for the same thing.  I know not all of my credits would transfer, that's just how it goes, but christ, having to redo a whole year?  I'm already 6 years behind what I should be.  Why would I knock myself back even further?  Trying to get ahead here, not return to sophomore year a 2nd time.

I already lost credits transferring from Monmouth to OCC, and again from OCC to Phoenix.  Usually it was a small amount, but it adds up.  I have enough credits to just about be done with my junior year, and officially I haven't even started it.  Losing 30 more is just asinine.

So at this point, I'm considering just getting a bachelors through Phoenix.  Expensive as hell, but about the same as Penn State would be.  Or I'm just going to start doing certification things through the community college, just for the sake of learning.  If I'm up for any grants, this will be practically free.
Or, plain and simple, I'm taking a break for a while and focusing on my books.  I've been balancing college, writing, and buying/maintaining a house for nearly 2 years and frankly I could use a breather."

Although if I want this printed sometime soon, I need to get it done.
If anyone feels like doing some PA traveling with me, let me know.  Part of the reason I've been dragging is because I don't want to go alone, which is very unlike me.

I really need to head over to Penn State and see if I'm going there for the next 2 years or not.  I have less than a month to figure that all out.

Work is making me more and more battle-hardened; I almost have to laugh at how I felt my first week now.  I punished 4 kids this weekend, more than all my previous weeks combined.  Annie says it's cute that I'm ""mean"" now.  I'm not mean; I'm just not a noob anymore.

I got about $100 from my auctions.  I can't figure out how to divide it, so I'm just going to put $50 extra toward my 2 credit cards that I really want to kill - Best Buy and Firestone.  Firestone's not too bad but unnecessary; Best Buy is a bloated mess that needs to die.

For the first time in months, my book was actually ranked on Amazon today.  It was briefly the #6 NJ book then quickly plummeted.  Oh well.  At least it's still in print.

If I'm going to NY Faire this year, it can only be on Labor Day.  Honestly I'm not sure I even want to go.  I think I'd rather check out the PA Faire finally.

I applied to Penn State on Thursday.  Haven't heard back.  Still waiting for my degree too.  If none of the ""big"" schools get back to me quickly, I may just go through with that photography certification at the community college.  It may not be the most lucrative thing, but I decided it would be more for me than anything work-wise.  I'm entitled to learn just for the sake of learning, am I not?

I visited Mr. Wielgosz yesterday and played Gears of War with him for like 10 hours.  Afterward I took the wifey to see Dark Knight.  I thought it was a bit too long, but otherwise I liked it a lot.  Up until this one, I thought this current series of films was a prequel to the other ones.  Guess not.  I was also very impressed with the theater in Wilkes-Barre.  Now if the rest of downtown would follow suit.
I also found out a mine fire has been burning nearly 100 years not too far from my house, so I stopped to investigate.  My pictures didn't come out so great, but I did shoot a 10 second video of smoke coming out of a crack in the ground.

I had quite the Jerseyana weekend.  We decided somewhat last minute to go to Wildwood.  Sonic was, of course, our first stop.  A whopping 6 of us crammed into Dawe's truck; good thing Maria & Andrew are less than an hour away from Wildwood.  I was hoping to see this Voodoo Tree I keep hearing about, but time and company prevented this.  Gotta wait til next year I suppose.
Lots of Polish water ice.  Lots of boardwalk fries.  Lots of clogged arteries.  Annie won me a Flame Duck.  My brother called Andrew a midget.  Dawe took that Hot Sauce Challenge thing.  We thought he was convulsing during it; turns out the stuff makes people hiccup.  After dropping everyone off, etc., my beau and I walked Ocean Gate, both of us being somewhat tipsy after a stop at Anchor Inn.  Half-drunk and 1:30 AM are great conditions in which to geocache.
On Sunday we went to pick up Deb and head to Berlin; last time I was there was the day I got married.  It's embarrassing to admit, but I had Rita's Italian Ice for the first time.  Since it was Father's Day, we visited our Da's grave.  Then we saw her family for a bit and made the long, boring trek back home.  NE Extension is blander than Rt. 70.

I felt very, very out of place being at a country club.  Good food though.  I was getting very anxious with all the people there, but a lil' Cap'n & Coke helped fix that, if only for a brief time.

We spent the weekend at Maria & Andrew's.  We were supposed to go to Wildwood but Mother Nature was on the rag, so we wound up just hanging out, playing Rock Band & Brawl, and going to a buffet with my brother.  Relaxing day.  Oh, and we drove all the way up to Waretown just to go to Sonic.
On Sunday I had a quesadilla for breakfast because breakfast food sucks.  Then the wifey and I went to Ocean City for the day.  I love that boardwalk.  I was happy to see Atlantic Books carrying my book.
TLC Polish Water Ice and KB Kettle Corn always make this trip worthwhile.  And unlike Wildwood, Ocean City's water ice stands don't have that annoying voice-over playing over and over.
Why am I calling it water ice?  It's Italian ice.  Water ice doesn't even make sense.  Damn 856ers and 609ers.  Italian ice, not water ice.  Sub, not hoagie.  Sprinkles, not jimmies.  Just because you're south of the Mason-Dixon doesn't mean you have to talk like it.  Noobs.
Drove up to my aunt's to pick up some stuff and headed home.  That woman loves to pawn things off on me.

I came home to find out my site was down.  A few days later I got this poorly, poorly written email from the host saying some of their servers short-circuited and caught fire.  Awesome.  They begged for me to not leave them.  At least I think that's what it says.  Maybe I'll post the letter later.

So far I've spent $118 on this damn counseling job and I don't even start til the 9th.  $10 for the child abuse clearance, $40 for the FBI crap, and $68 for a physical and TB shot.  I get $50 back from the agency for my physical, but come on.
In an interesting turn of events, largely orchestrated by yours truly, Annie will be replacing me at the newspaper.  I may stay on for a little while as part time if they so see fit.

Thanks to my brother, my ringtone is now ""Do a barrel roll.""

4 weeks to a degree."

Other than no noticeable Friends Only option, I dig it.<br /><br /><br />I am now the proud new owner of Dawe's old 360.  Obtaining it, however, has utterly obliterated any chance of paying down my Best Buy credit card any time in the near future.  I picked up Bio Shock, Guitar Hero 2 &amp; 3, Oblivion, and Fable.  I got some $5 Xbox game, Malice, but it's not compatible with 360.  So I guess I have a coaster.<br />GH3 is way better on 360 than Wii.  Bio Shock is the only shooter since Golden Eye I've had any interest in.  Fable is OK so far.  I haven't started Oblivion yet, but this one kid said it's like RPG crack, so I'm afraid.  I downloaded the original TMNT arcade game tonight too.  Took about 20 minutes to beat.<br />I think Rock Band may be my next big purchase.<br />I suppose somewhere in there I'll blow the dust off God of War 2 &amp; Twilight Princess.<br /><br /><br />In about 2 months from now, conditions permitting, I will have my associate's in psychology.<br /><br /><br />Iron Man was the first movie we saw in the theater since Pirates 3 I believe.  I liked it.  Cloverfield was next on our Netflix list so we saw that this weekend.  Other than leaving just about every question unanswered (which is kind of how the whole 1st-person perspective thing is supposed to work), I liked it.<br /><br /><br />More and more birds are coming to the feeder.  We now have brown-headed cowbirds, and they're huge compared to the rest.  They're also quite bland.<br /><br /><br />After some consideration, I've decided to pursue the counseling job.  Money and time-permitting, I will be a counselor sometime in June.  I have to pay for all sorts of background checks beforehand, and because our lil' stimulus payment didn't come when it was supposed to, money's not so great at the moment.  I'll feel bad leaving the newspaper so soon, but I really don't like it and have no desire to do the making ads/Quark/Photoshop/dealing with menstrual realtors crap anymore.  I can't stand sitting in front of a computer for 8 hours a day and constantly having to redo ads because a realtor changed their mind last minute.  4+ years was enough.  I'm done.<br />It will be nice doing something that's somewhat related to my interests and has the potential to NOT be a dead-end job.  Camping?  Hiking?  Helping others with their problems?  Not burning my eyes out in front of a monitor all day?  I'm in.<br />The only drawback about this job is not having a weekend anymore.  But I will have off Monday through Thursday, giving me plenty of time to start working on my other books and go to a real college.<br /></div>"

"event","Started my new job on Monday.  It's very similar to what I was doing with the Home Shopper, but we use Macs instead of PC and the programs are a little more involved.  We also don't proof at all, and just about everything is copy & paste.  I'm glad I'm not mindlessly typing anymore, but there are other aspects that are much harder than Home Shopper was.
Oddly, one of the guys at this job used to work at Showcase, well before my time though.

Working downtown has some nice advantages.  Quizno's is just across the Square.  Barnes & Noble is around the corner.  There are other shops I haven't been in yet, such as the indy video game & music stores.  One huge disadvantage is parking; I can either pay to park in the nearby garages or I get to park several blocks away from my building.  All the spots at the building are already designated, so any newcomers get tossed out to the wastelands.  In the ghetto lot as I call it is an abandoned restaurant where 2 people were apparently shot not too long ago.  I love that that's where we're supposed to be parking and walking to and from at night.


I want to start gardening but really don't know what to do about deer.  So in other approaches in hippifying my place, I bought a bird feeder last week.  The hummingbird feeder is also back out, but I haven't seen any yet.  We also bought a clothesline, though I have yet to put that out.  I'm interested in seeing how using the dryer less will impact the electric bill.  Plus now all the neighbors can gaze at my awesome pirate smiley boxers.
The birdfeeder was doing well for the first few days, and I was surprised at just how many began showing up only 2 days after putting it out.  I've seen sparrows, finches, chickadees, and one of my favorites, titmouses (titmice?).  Lol, titmouse.  There are a few more I haven't identified yet.
But last night or this morning something knocked the top off and ate everything.

<img src=""http://www.stuofdoom.com/doomedfeeder.jpg"">

Initially I thought a squirrel somehow jumped up and caught on, but after further investigation, I discovered this on the ground by the feeder:

<img src=""http://www.stuofdoom.com/antler.jpg"">

I came home and put the feeder as high as it can go.  I doubt it's high enough so I'll have to figure out something else.  Some birds were actually a few feet away from me, watching and waiting for their food.


The final from hell met its end on Sunday.  Another class down.  At the end of this week, yet another class will have met its end.  Next week I start my final class, unless financial aid screws up and pushes it back another week."

This past week during one of my temp jobs, I came across another ordained minister.  He's done weddings, baptisms, etc. for his friends, which got me to thinking, why shouldn't I?

I haven't done anything yet and am still reading up on how to go about it, but if anyone is interested in such services, let me know.  I admit I'm new and really have no idea what I'm doing just yet.

I am non-denominational, of course.  Legally, I can do just about anything minus circumcision, and I don't think I'd want to do that even if I could.

So yeah, if there's an interest, I may go ahead with this.  I've already had one request for a baptism.  If you want to get married, be blessed/baptized, or whatever else, I may be your man.  Everything is negotiable.
For now I'd rather stick to private or small groups until I'm not a noob anymore."

1 year ago today I was in Maryland getting married.  Man, this past year went by fast.  Despite all the ups and downs of buying a house, moving, etc., I think we're doing pretty well.  I wish we could do something nice for the anniversary but that doesn't seem to be in the cards.  A nice dinner out would do fine if we had a bit more money this week.  Hopefully I can figure something out.

My unemployment was short-lived; luckily it lasted only 3 days.  I was worried because it initially took me 5 or 6 months to find a job up here.  I started another temp job on Thursday through a different agency; at about this point Kelly can go scratch.  I absolutely loathe the job, but I'll take it for now.  Now I just have to figure out what to do about my unemployment claim; literally 2 minutes after I filed over the phone, the agency called me to tell me I was starting a new assignment the next day.  Funny how that works.

We finally filed our taxes yesterday, and we're getting a decent chunk back, decent enough to be caught up on everything and still have a good amount left over.  Perhaps a trip to the Thousand Islands is in the near future afterall.

Got some much needed yard work done last weekend and during the week.  First time I've done any since November probably.  Just don't have the time.

As far as I know, there is at least 1 camping trip being planned for spring.  I have a few ideas in mind.

Perhaps the Dark Ages are near an end.  We shall see.
However, a bunch of good stuff just happened.  That usually means something nasty's just around the corner..."

"event","I donated plasma today - well, sold is more like it.  What an interesting experience.  Unlike just giving blood, the machine separates the red cells from plasma and actually puts the cells back in your body.
I thought it was gonna be a quick in & out & here's your 30 bucks, but no.  Since it was my first time, I first had to watch some video about plasma.  Then I had to read over papers about AIDS and take the easiest test in the world about how transmitting AIDS through plasma is bad.  Then came the initial blood test.  Then came the paperwork.  Then came the physical.  2 hours after arriving, I was finally able to start the donation.
The process took about an hour, and it took 9 or 10 cycles to get the amount needed.  I did very well...until the end.  Literally seconds before the machine stopped I felt a way I can't even describe.  It wasn't exactly nausea or dizziness; I don't know what it was.  Apparently I looked bad because 3 nurses ran over and put damp cloths on my face and neck.  They said I was pretty pale.  Maybe 5 minutes later I was fine.  I don't know if I was passing out or what, but it's a feeling I'll never forget - and one I don't want to repeat.
I don't know if I'll go back or not.  I'll get $40 next time so I'm considering going one last time.  I'm just afraid to have that happen again.

Oh, and did you know if you have gay sex once, just once ever, it is recommended you never donate plasma?"

I probably could've fought it, but I wasn't overly happy there and knew the end was near anyway.    I did all the work handed to me and learned just about everything there was to learn.  Not good enough.  I'm not saying I was completely blame-free, but Mr. Snitch was just as bad, and at times worse, than I was.  Sad part was, I thought we were friends.  Too bad he's the department's Golden Boy and angelic in the eyes of management, so no matter what I'd be a liar.  What pisses me off is that nobody ever confronted me and asked my side.  Silly me, temps don't have opinions.
I need to do something else anyway; been slaving over printers for 5 years now.
So whatever, I can't work there anymore.  At least I've earned everything I have, something Mr. Snitch can't say for a goddamn thing he owns.  I could rip a few other people from there apart but don't have the energy or drive to.  No need.  I've probably accomplished more in my life than any of them have or ever will, so they can enjoy each other's company in their sad little microcosm, thinking they ruined my life by offing me from some shitty job.

What have I said time and time again, kiddies?  If you've been following me for any length of time, you know karma is a bitch and those who do me wrong get hit exceptionally hard.  I don't know why, but <i>ka</i> seems to have taken a liking to me.  Lovely part is I don't have to lift a finger.

Out of all this I've made one of the most unique and influential friends I've ever had who has (I hope) never judged me and was not afraid to be himself.  That alone makes the drama and deceit I've dealt with at this place worth it.

Saturday was one of the best days in recent memory.  There were a bunch of geocaches that popped up in Toms River and Brick in my absence, many of which were in parks I used to go to when I was little.  First up was Deer Hollow, a park I used to bike to when I lived off Vaughn.  Sadly, there's still next to nothing there; it's mostly just open space.  That's nice and all, but what are the kids supposed to play on?
Next up was Skyview.  I used to play football there my freshman year.  My first really big crush was started there as well.  In my senior year, my obsession at the time and I skipped class and went to Skyview to go on the seesaw.  Now, they've ripped up all the playground stuff and replaced it all with benches.  Why?
2 caches were hidden off Maine Street in Silverton; I lived down the road for 4 years.  After getting the caches, I passed by my old house.  It looks a lot nicer now; I'm glad the current owner took better care of it than my family did.
I discovered a park in Brick that I didn't even know existed.  That's why I love caching; it takes you to all sorts of places you had no idea about, sometimes even in your own town.

Sunday was a fun romp in the Pines.  First, I found some substantial ruins off Mt. Misery Road; still trying to find out just what they were.  Then we headed back to Buckingham for some high quality photos for my next potential book.  There was a fire there not too long ago, hopefully a controlled burning.  After that we headed to Annie's family's, where I proceeded to destroy her cousins in Brawl.


Great weekend.  Found a new place, got photos of another, found 7 caches, and revisted my childhood.
Too bad reality fucked me in the ass this morning when I opened up my email and found out my job contract's been canceled.  That position I applied for back in, I don't know, November was it?  Not only was it filled, but they're kicking my temp ass out; my last day is Friday.  So much for promising me at least 6 months of work.  I could say more about it but what's the point.
At this point I really think I just want to move back to NJ.  Not back to the Toms River area though.  I should've looked more thoroughly in the Cumberland/Salem/Camden area before I wasted this past year of my life on mortgages, lawsuits, and risking my credit."

I came down to the old OC on Saturday, and Mr. Dawe took us to Anchor Inn.  I missed that place.  Since my signing was in Sweetwater, we stayed at Maria & Andrew's for the night.  I convinced Andrew to go with me to attempt to get Brawl at the midnight release.  The nearest Gamestop was the Porno Mall (named so because it at one time had BJ's, Dick's, and Seaman's in it) in Hamilton.  There was a line out the door, of course, but it moved quickly.  After about 5 minutes, I had a copy of Brawl in my hands.

Sunday was the Lines on the Pines event, which was both a great and bad day.  Long story short, nobody told me I was supposed to supply my own books.  I was the only author with an empty booth.  I didn't even go to my booth very often; I was just kinda hanging out.  I did meet a ton of people from both South Jersey geocaching and the Pine Barrens site though.
And I was simply in the Pine Barrens, right on the Mullica.  I really, really missed it.  That alone was worth looking like an idiot.  If there was anything affordable at all in the area I'd surely move.

A group has asked me to do some YouTube videos for them.  I'm flattered but at the same time totally nervous.  I'm probably horrible in front of a camera, and the thought of any random punk being able to leave smartass comments is also something else I worry about.  It's also the reason I haven't put any of my exploring videos up yet.
This does, however, somewhat tie in with another idea I've been tossing around lately.


My last signing is tomorrow.  I feel like I've reached the end of my road as far as the book's concerned.


I saved myself $340 yesterday.
The other day a rock got kicked up into my windshield.  I didn't realize until the next day that it made a small crack.  We all know such cracks spread if not dealt with.  I called a few places about repairing it.  All said it was too large (bigger than a quarter).  The one guy and I got into a bit of an argument about molding, and then he started whining about the price of gas and how he's tired of ""them"" making him drive around everywhere to see whether or not he can fix windshields.  Ok there, buddy.
Safelite said if it's smaller than a dollar bill they can do it.  Trouble is, the soonest I could get them to come out was Tuesday, meaning there was a span of 5 days for this thing to grow - meaning that repair was probably not an option.  Just about every place offered to replace the windshield for $350.  And my useful as ever insurance company pointed out that my deductible is $500.  Why should I pay for something that's not my fault?  Not to mention I don't have $350 to piss away on a windshield because of a crappy lil' 4 inch or so crack.
So after stressing out and making myself sick, I found something online about windshield repair kits.  Being skeptical but desperate I picked one up on the way home from work for $10 - Fix-A-Windshield.  Long story short, the crack is barely visible now and hasn't spread. At the time I figured I was going to either save $340 or waste $10, and I'm glad I took the chance.  I actually fixed something.  And saved a whole lotta money too.  Now I just have to figure out what to say to the insurance company.  ""Oh you can close that claim now.  I fixed it myself.""


Thankfully, work did not suck this week.


Oh, it's 3 AM.

Face book, google+ and life have put LJ on the back burner. 
Not sweatin' it.

What I am sweating a tiny bit is this camel theme on my journal. WTH?

Many moons ago, I sat here and literally designed my own lay out. It was by hour and by chance that it worked. I took code, HTML code, and number by number designed my LJ color theme. I found something I liked, I looked at the code and I put it in. some things got screwed up so I backed out. Some things changed either because i entered the wrong code or accidently put two codes together and I got pinstripes. It was grey on grey with some blue slate. I loved it, I've had it for years. Then one day somebody's name was on it, somebody lay claim to my design. I was indignant for about 5 minutes and then i didn't care. I still had it on my page. 
Now it's gone and i have camels on caramel colored sand heading east. I can't change it. I found my style and the silly oaf who took it, but I can't apply it.

The camels clash with my icon."

I was curious about a predatory snail that eats slugs, and prefers decomposing material to live plants. When I searched Decollate Snail, and ad came up, &quot;Buy Decollate Snails!&quot; Then I read that earthworms are on there diet. They are native to Egypt and Israel. Why would anybody buy a predator, native to another continent? Don't people realize what this would do to ecosystems? How can this be legal? This is the Starling story all over again."

"event","I've been working the damages area the last few days. We have literally thrown away, into the trash, at least a thousand pounds of dog food (plus other items), each day. I realize we are a new warehouse and still making contacts, but it kills me to do this. 
If you know of a non-profit animal rescue, boarder, breeder, helper, groomer, whatever, please have them contact Petsmart DC41 at 775-352-4990 or 775-352-5772 and ask for the DC Services Supervisor regarding donations.
The perfect non-profit would take ALL offered donations including wild bird, parrot and small birds, fish and aquarium, reptile, cat litter, LARGE DOG FOOD, pond, CAT LITTER, small animal bedding, toys, treats and cat food. 
Large dog food, and cat litter are the heaviest bags, and they damage the easiest, thus we have more of these items. Typically cat food comes in a smaller, more manageable bags, and doesn't damage as easily. We have two feline rescues who show up like clock work, so cat food is hard to come by.
I don't recommend a car with an open trunk. This kind of nonprofit wastes our time. Bring a horse trailer, flat bed, semi truck and we'll load it with a fork lift. We are the only DC on the far west coast, so Sacramento, the Bay Area and all points north and south can come here with an I9 and take donations. They must get set up with us as a non-profit, but we don't care who you are or how many animals you help. We give Nutro to the sheriff's department, and what they don't use they give to seniors with dogs.
Please come take this food and help starving animals and broke pet parents. I don't want to throw anymore away."

"event","My sister feeds her horses grass hay because they get little exercise and don't need the fattening alfalfa hay or grain.
I try and imagine what it would be like to live on grass hay and the nearest I can come is brown rice. Only brown rice unless a little dust blows into it, then it's dust flavored brown rice.
The horses are OK with this.
To me, horses have achieved a higher level of consciousness to be OK with grass hay. 
They do have options, hold out for alfalfa hay and grain. 
Refuse to eat until another meal is presented to them.
Their total options are like, 5 different flavors or textures.
How many option do we humans have? A million? A billion?
I decided today, that if I had to eat one thing for the rest of my life, I think it would be navel oranges. 
I can eat Carmel until I'm sick, but a navel orange gives me so much pleasure. The smell of the peel to choking on the juice as it squirts down my throat. I even enjoy scraping the white pulp off the peel, with my teeth.
I love them.

"event","The family is also informally known as the nightshade or potato family. The family includes the Datura or Jimson weed, eggplant, mandrake, deadly nightshade or belladonna, capsicum (paprika, chili pepper), potato, tobacco, tomato, and petunia.

The Solanaceae family is characteristically ethnobotanical, that is, extensively utilized by humans. It is an important source of food, spice and medicine. However, Solanaceae species are often rich in alkaloids that can range in their toxicity to humans and animals from mildly irritating to fatal in small quantities.

The Solanaceae are known for possessing a diverse range of alkaloids. As far as humans are concerned, these alkaloids can be desirable, toxic, or both, though they presumably evolved because they reduce the tendency of animals to eat the plants.

Capsaicin is structurally unrelated to nicotine or the tropanes, and is found in the genus Capsicum, which includes chili peppers such as Tabasco peppers and habaneros. The compound is not appreciably toxic to animals. However, it stimulates specific pain receptors in most mammals, those which sense heat, in the oral mucosa as well as many other epithelial tissues. This causes a sensation of burning not unlike an actual heat or chemical burn. It is used in high concentration as a deterrent in pepper sprays, and sought after for many culinary dishes for its ""spiciness"".
(wikipedia - solanaceae)

We have discovered a
potential link with an apparent relationship between
nightshades and arthritis. The link suggests that
plants in the drug family Solanaceae (or nightshades)
are an important causative factor in arthritis in
sensitive people.
A hypersensitivity or auto-
intoxification response may occur from the build
up of cholinesterase inhibiting glycoalkaloids and
steroids from the consumption (or use of) plants
or substances within the Solanaceae food group
such as potato, tomato (unripe), aubergine, tobacco,
peppers, caffeine and some pesticides and this may
give rise to symptoms of inflammation, muscle
spasms, pain and stiffness. The article adds that
osteo-arthritis could be a result of the long-term
consumption and/or use of the Solanaceae, and that
dietary adjustments to eliminate these factors have
shown a positive improvement in the symptoms
of arthritis. The Home Treatment Programme
advocates the elimination of tomato, tomato juice
and coffee from the diet.

I'm so tired of watching your TV ads showing disabled veterans from the Iraq war.
Or their Mothers.

The truth is, maybe we belong in Iraq, maybe we don't. I don't know.
I do know Iraq has NOTHING to do with the attack on the US on 9/11/2001.
None of the Terrorists who attacked this country were from Iraq, financed by Iraq, had family in Iraq, or cared about Iraq.

Your ad is a lie.

Your ad is what George Bush would like us to believe.

The Iraq war started because George Jr cleaned up George Sr's mess. That is all.

"event","I watched the national news last night.
They are a bit confused.
The fire is very near Angora Lake and Fallen Leaf Lake.
If you watched ABC new last night, you might believe that 50% of Lake Tahoe, the east/south east side has burned.
That lake they showed is the small Fallen Leaf Lake.
The total fire is about 3 square miles, south of Lake Tahoe, just south west of the Y.
It's due west of the tiny Tahoe airport.
The fire is entirely in California, 5 miles from the Casinos in Nevada.
Personal opinions:
Fire happens naturally, this was not natural.
The lake handles ash.
Clear cutting personal property will save you home, but this is not what Tahoe is about. Move to Tahoe, deal with the fire danger. You might lose your home to a fire that is moving at 100 acres an hour, this is the chance you take when you left the asphalt jungle.
Cutting trees to improve your view, or put in a drive way or patio, is not OK.
There were 1000 buildings in that 3 square mile fire area. That is crazy for a national forest. Only 200 buildings burned. That's awesome.
I don't think any of them should be allowed to rebuild.
Buy another Tahoe home that is up for sale.
I don't think there should be one more home built, one more buoy anchored, or any more boat docks built. 
They complain that Tahoe is getting cloudy, but they allow more people to move in to the basin.
It's crazy.

Correction:
Tahoe Keys is south (and nearly on fire).
Kings Beach is the flat spot on the north side."

My neighbor is an Asshat.

I don't think he can be nice to his dog, ever.
His dog has many bad habits taught to him buy his masters.
Barking loudly, sharply and endlessly until he's fed, being one of them.

The neighbor yells, too.
He never talks, he cusses and yells.
When he mows his weeds he screams, ""MOVE!"" at the dog.

He's from Texas and flys the Texas State flag.
I want to ask him why he doesn't return to Texas, and soon.

I have had to endure his barking dog for more than two years now.
The other day he looked over the fence and said in a very loud voice, ""Excuse me Miss"", (Don't ever call me Miss) ""You have flooded my flower garden"".
I said, ""Not anymore"", and he replied, ""It's ruined"". Sure Dude, it's only ruined because you never water it. I watered with a Rainbird that slightly cleared the fence for 4 hours (I fell asleep). I'm sure the look of moist soil convinced him his flower bed was ruined.

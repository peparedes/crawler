"event","i have so much tosay but not enough patience to say it all.

quickquick summary - posies been sold, frankie and polly are at stud and heidi bought me a chihauhau which has broken its leg and is at the vets now. oh yeah - and heidis got a new cuntface of a boyfriend.

he doesnt do owt bad he isnt mean or tells me or off anything but i just hate his fucking guts. its just him, nothing he does, its just fucking HIM! he's so uncultured and course and common and it DISGUSTS ME - and hes a fucking homophobe - he really deserves to die soon.

its so hard to explain why he gets to me so much, its tiny little things all the fucking time that no one else wud understand but i want to kill him and everyone else - im just getting these huge huge rage fits, like i did when was like 14/15 and suicidal and just i feel like i'm going psychotic, like over the edge, i can sit in a room on my own and cant get any peace or quiet it seems so loud in my head, its like, i feel so lonely, but i can't get any peace - its like my brain is spinning round and round and my bodies being torn in all directions and the only way to stop that is taking pills, prescription stuff, but i'm not allowed them so when I find them I can't help but take load sof them, im not attention seaking or ussulkign like my mum thinks, im doing it so im a nicer person and i dont shout at everyone - cant she see how unhappy i am? what do i have to do string her fucking dog up to the washing line and pull its guts out till she notices?

but noooooooooooooooooooo she wont careeeeeeeeee shes nice and happy with her cuntfeature boyfriend why would what little old i think matter

she takes him everywhere, instead of me.

its like, now she has him, im not needed anymore, its like having a best friend whos gone on holiday so u get a new bestfriend but as soon as the old bestfriend is back u dont give too shits about the new bestfriend no molre.

i rthink even menace the jackrussel feels the same, i keep finding him under my feet on the computer or in my bed (sofa) in the morning, when usually he's always in heidis room - but now shes got lover boy she dont need any of us.

course the childtren dont seem to mind, dickshit takes oban out to the workshop to play with cars and teaches the other ones fighting moves (?!)

i feel like ive got so much more to say but i cant sya it

its like theres so much running round in my mind i cant blank it and its sending me crazy and i just want to hurt sometihng"

"event","Sorry haven't got round to writing in here for ages because I've like not been able to muster up the enthusiasm, see I should tell you I'm having all the tick off box characteristics of depression yet I have no reason to be depressed, so I've analysed and realised this;

(Hard to explain as well and I'm tired as fuck and it'll all come out wrong)

When I was at school, if I felt like everyone didn't love me and come to my beck and call and really care what I had to say I would get really down like properly not just sulking I would go into cutting and everything, just for not being absolute centre of attention absolutely all of the time. 
But then comes the twist I don't like being centre of attention all the time, I like people to be my groupies, yet me not have to work for it and not be interesting all the time so really I felt like people should love me and worship me constantly and show it constantly and if they didn't it all brainwashed me and escalated in my brain to the world hating me and not caring about me etc - Really really sad when you write it down like that but that's exactly how I work. So I overdosed and left, hah.

Anyway the problem seems to be now that my mum has a new boyfriend, and yeah he's alright and she's really happy etc but it's like - now Heidi doesn't give all her attention to me (This is why I hate Oban so much because I always think she's paying him more attention and I make her life hell for it and I know I do but I can't help it, that's just how I work, everything just blows up in my mind and I don't know maybe I'm just slightly crazy). 
Yeah so it's like now all of a sudden just because I'm not the absolute goddess all the time in my family, I have huge rage fits, absolute apathy and lack of goals in everything, especially horses which is like AREYOUSMOKINSOMETHINGMATE! And most strange of all I'm getting like realllllly huge urges to go and take some pills, not to overdose, but to get off my face and float around like I used to do at school. But I can't find them for shit and I don't get ANY time alone it's like - I can't even find a room to wank in anymore - that sort of situation. The children are everywhere and they always have their friends round and this fucking stalker boy who works for my mums boyfriend like stays here from morning till midnight pestering the fuck out of me and he doesn't understand what the fuck Asexual means, no fucker seems to now adays, I fucking hate men.

See rage fits, gotta calm downnnn.

But WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH ME why do I have this fucking unrealistic urge to be here there and everywhere and when I'm not I want to die, what the fuck IS THAT, I belong in the fucking O.C I tell you... it sounds that way don't it, fucking wank shafting arses, ARG."

So anyway I had an idea... you know they do rip off porn version films like ""Shavings Ryans Privates"" - Aii well my idea IS a film about this bad girl twin and a cloned good girl twin (so really not twins but clones but fuck off, if you've seen the movie you'll know what I mean) so it'll be Twincest right and it shall be called... Replicunt!!

Angry Souls arent always<br>angry, but they cannot easily forgive and hold<br>grudges. You probably often get in fights with<br>your friends and family, and its difficult for<br>you to understand. When someone makes a<br>mistake, you dont let go easily and hold on to<br>those memories. Your very stubborn and your<br>rage is known to everyone. Though you never<br>actually mean it, you can say mean things in a<br>fight and go over board. Many people are<br>sometimes intimidated by your anger. But you<br>have many redeeming qualities and those are<br>that you are quite intelligent and smart. You<br>would make a good businesswoman or lawyer<br>because you know how to prove your point. You<br>cherish the ones around you, and appreciate<br>life, even though you can complain or throw a<br>tantrum now and then. The good things is, you<br>keep your emotions very outspoken, and are<br>normally a very happy person because all your<br>rage is let on the outside. Anger is simply a<br>state, but you, yourself as a person, are<br>great.

<P>Ok I knew I didn't much like other horsey people before but I realised why&nbsp;I have respect for some and the others I just laugh at even if I am friends with you, I do no doubt laugh at you when your not looking :) And don't go asking me if you're one of them, you probably are, it's nothing personal, I'm just a stuck up bitch.<BR><BR>There are many many reasons why I do or don't laugh at you, I'll try and think of some...

<LI>If you're from a non horsey family, I don't think, aww poor you, I think, hah townie cunts.</LI>
<LI>If you have a horsey family I think you have more commitment, if you don't I think your wannabes and laugh.</LI>
<LI>If your not from a horsey family but have a horsey job and your OWN horse I like you.</LI>
<LI>If you are on a livery yard,&nbsp;I laugh.</LI>
<LI>If you WORK at a livery yard and act like the horses there are your OWN I fucking despise you.</LI>
<LI>If you live in a town, I laugh.</LI>
<LI>If you ride your horse once/twice a week - Youre not commited you suck. Hah</LI>

<LI>I hate people who use horses like machines.</LI>
<LI>I hate people who can only get their pony on the bit, put it on a stranger and they have no idea.</LI>

I was so gutted when I realised it wasn't real!

~enter dream~
We (family) went to the ponies field and it so happened that Riyah, Frankie and Polly had all had twin foalies!! So that's like 6 babies running around and we didn't know whos was whos LOL But they were all colour co-ordinated to we put the matching ones together and waited for the mummies to step forward. 
~exit dream~

Oh god it was good.

On an even better note, Frankie kicked Oban today :D (Sadly I was at home being ill so missed it)

I love my Frankie ~huggles~"

Was actually pretty easy, just sort of had a few people anchoring his head down while I squirted dopey paste shit in his mouth as fast as I could. He didn't mind too much, caramel flavoured - UmUmmyummyscrummy. So then we tidied him up ya know, cut a bottom layer out of his mane cos we're lazy and he's hairy, pulled the rest, pulled out half his forelock cos it was down to his friggin nose, chopped off all face whiskers, really chopped off a <EM>lot</EM> of beard growth all around his face and neck etc, chopped off half his tail shaved the other half off (ya know what&nbsp;I meannn) and now he looks like a SHP again not a wicked welsh boy!</P>
<P>Hurrah!</P>"

"event","Guesss whatttt? I had a little premonition today :-o !! LOL
Here's the story;

Today we were traveling to the stables but first we were going to go to the Tack Shop and pick up a hacking jacket for Aaron. Anyway on the way I smelled something burning, probably from outside. And it set me on this really strange train of thought which started off the ponies being stuck inside their boxes while the barn was on fire, but this then honed onto Frankie (no more fire anymore) being all strung up and trapped and suffocating because there was rope round her neck etc. Anyway I had one can only be described as a mini seizure, pure dread, like when you've been smoking pot and you get reallllly fucking badly paranoid and it feels like your muscles are spazzaming and your bodies gone rigid and you can't move? I'm sure that happens to other people. Anyway that happened to me while in the car so I threw a little fit and made mother go to the ponies first.

And as soon as we got to the barn I went over to see Frankie and guess what, she had both her feet through her haynet just sort of.. Dangling around standing on her back legs, and the poor thing was all sweated up and whinnying. Luckily she isn't thick enough to make a real big fuss about it but she was dancing about and I was panicking because I could see her little legs snapping, big phobia of mine always has been, pony getting legs caught in stuff.

So anyway I cut the bastard bailer twine that didn't fucking snap and massaged Frankies legs better, they were pretty warm and slightly swolen but no rope burns or lasting damage, thank fuck!

I didn't realise till I was feeding her that I'd seen an extreme case of what had happened earlier on and then I thought - Duuuudeee LOL

See Frankie loves me, she speaks to me in my head.. Hah I'm so fucking gonna start telling people I hear my horses voice in my head. Oh yesssss."

Notice the leanings towards names with 'Time' in them - That's because Frankies name is Hammonds About Time and the pattern follows with all her siblings lol..."

<P>Holy mother of shit you'll never guess what the fuck what?!</P>
<P>You know this fat little kid came to see&nbsp;Frankie the other day (ok you don't I was too distraught to write about it) yeah well she prodded Frankie, she like went to stroke her but she kept prodding her like accidentally because Frankies all delicate and yeah, stupid bitch don't prod my pony! And when Frankie wouldn't go in an outline because the girl wasn't pushing her on at all she starting fucking SAWING at her mouth! You cunt!</P>
<P>So anyway they did like her and I did like them other than those incidents ^ But they rang today and decided the child was too big (read fat) for her and I was like WAHAY and Heidi was like - OH FUCKIT we'll keep her and we're breeding from her</P>
<P>LIKE HOLY FUCKING CRAP ON A FUCKING HAPPY LITTLE STICK OF PISS </P>
<P>Could I BE any happier??????????????????????????</P>"

"event","Hahaha prepare for the rantings of a maniac.

I'm pretty sure I might die soon. Soon being next 5 years but that's very soon on the outlook of things.

I'm starting to wind down like old people do. It's freaky.

I'm not too bothered about it, I just hope it isn't too drawn out ya know? If it is it'll be out with the shot gun and a nice little note saying it's the kindest way. They'll understand, I would if it were someone else. What's it called euthanasia (but spelt right) that's the one - it's legit.

I keep getting all this weird misplaced guilt for stupid shit I never usually care about (like bombings and war and homeless and retards etc :P) I think like I'm subconsciously cleaning my act up so I go to a nice place when I die. And fuck it I don't even know if I believe in an afterworld so that's silly but there's this quote from somewhere goes like.. ""I don't believe in god but I'm afraid of him"" applies well in this situation.

Also, everytime I'm like having fun with friends or family etc I feel really guilty that I'm leading them on and making them have greater upset when I die cos I made them enjoy me too much (hah dodgy) and it'll be harder to let go and I empathise way too fucking much with things and I'm more upset about my family and friends being upset than just being gone.

There I'm done"

"event","<em>Pretty Good
By:  Charles Osgood


There once was a pretty good student,
           Who sat in a pretty good class
And was taught by a pretty good teacher,
           Who always let pretty good pass.
He wasn't terrific at reading,
           He wasn't a whiz-bang at math;
But for him education was leading
           Straight down a pretty good path.
He didn't find school too exciting,
           But he wanted to do pretty well,
And he did have some trouble with writing
           And nobody taught him to spell.
When doing arithmetic problems
           Pretty good was regarded as fine.
Five plus five needn't always add up to be ten,
           A pretty good answer was nine.
The pretty good class that he sat in
           Was part of a pretty good school,
And the student was not an exception,
           On the contrary, he was the rule.
The pretty good school that he went to
            Was in a pretty good town.
And nobody seemed to notice
            He could not tell a verb from a noun.
The pretty good student in fact was
            Part of a pretty good mob.
And the first time he knew what he lacked was
            When he looked for a pretty good job.
It was then, when he sought a position,
            He discovered that life could be tough,
And he soon had a sneaky suspicion
            Pretty good might not be good enough.
The pretty good town in our story
            Was part of a pretty good state,
Which had pretty good aspirations,
             And prayed for a pretty good fate.
There once was a pretty good nation,
             Pretty proud of the greatness it had,
Which learned much too late
             If you want to be great,
Pretty good is, in fact, pretty bad.</EM>"

"event","well,
things finally came to a head today

today was tmsca state
and 
i left the house at 7
got to utsa at 7:20 
only to realise
i left the tickets at home.

so 
back home (by 7:40)
and back to utsa at 8

yep, interesting day today.

number sense test was hard
i got to proof the back 
coach from lubbock proofed the front

clark decided to attend
a first (in a while)
and good to see them there.
let them get a taste of
klein, lubbock, and la joya!

didn't get to proctor math
but i got to proof math
and i did
as long as i could

got to call larry white
to ask for his clarification
on a few things
and got it
threw out #19
on his recommendation
(more on that later.)

but eventually
i finished the math test
so
i volunteered to clear calcs
for the science test
(are you sensing a pattern here?)

after this
and went to the grading room
and graded calculator 
yeah, ten whole tests.

got to verify number sense
under a time crunch
since the coach was the third grader
i got to grade 24 tests in 30 minutes
and verify data entry 

graded math for a while
(hey, i'll grade multiple choice any day)
graded a 308 junior test
and
got to verify and triple grade calculator o.0
24 tests in 30 minutes 0.o

then
called my wife to check up on her...

<HR>

on tuesday
my wife took a home pregnancy test
because she's been feeling...awkward
and it came positive.

being the ever trusting soul she is
she bought two others
(from two different manufacturers)
and both came back positive.

i set up a ob/gyn appointment 
on april 5th 
because apparently
you can't do these things
on a whim.

so we've been hoping
thinking happy thoughts
and
waiting...

<HR>

i find out
my wife is bleeding and cramping.
so
i leave tmsca
(that's why i wasn't there)
and drove like a bat outta hell
to get home
and take her to the emergency room.

and mrs. swaney was our triage nurse
(small world, eh?)

wait wait wait
because
apparently the life of my unborn child 
is not important to anyone else
except for me and my wife.

yes, 
i thought nasty thoughts
waited for anyone to look at me wrong
so i could pound a bloody pulp
and at the same time
just wanted to pick up my wife
and hold her 
and never let her go.

a desire for anger
and
a desire to hold and console
ever fleeting
changing and switching
from one to the other
at a hearbeat
one to the other.

came in and
more wait wait wait
apparently
today was the day for auto accidents
several people came in
on body boards.

dr came in
and mentioned
bleeding and cramping
was normal
but
we'll do a ultrasound
to check
if it's a tubal pregnancy
or if it's nonviable
but there's definitely a pregnancy involved.

more wait wait wait
apparently
for a pregnant woman
they don't just ultrasound the belly
*wince*
and she had a catheter
so they could fill her bladder
so thing could be seen better.

more wait wait wait
and.
and..
and...

the baby is 6 weeks 6 days old
we should be expecting in november
she says early, i say mid
but
we'll take that.

yeah,
i'm gonna be a daddy!

WOOT!"

my uncle is
no better
no worse
than saturday 
when i saw him
on a ventilator
pneumonia
of the lungs
brain infection
one eye
rolled back
closed
the other eye
panicked
staring straight ahead
as if
he sees his
destination
but isn't ready for
a journey
mouth moving
but
no sound coming
out
tubes in his
throat
nose
arm 
leg 
groin
urine as
red as port
in the foley
by his feet
skin taut
and pale
tattoos 
no longer blue
but black
on his 
legs
arms
fingers
hair
matted
from lack
of maintenance
and
the doctors
want
to 
slow 
the 
ventilator
down
to
see
if
he
can
breathe
on
his
own 
mouth moving
words forming
but
no sound coming out
no sound can come out
because
there's a tube
beside his 
voicebox
and
tears are
falling 
down his face
a tall man
a strong man
in my youth
built a motorcycle
from spare parts
(not like a kit
but
with a welder's torch
he built the frame)
i 
rememeber
the smell
when he
worked out
in the yard
or the garage
i'd smell him
and
he smelled
of strength
and a hard days work
that musky smell
that most women
go ""ewww"" over
but i thought
it was neat
now
all i smell
is the antiseptic
hospital smell
and
the smell
of the fibers 
on the mask
i have to wear
to visit him
to keep him
from catching my germs
to keep me
from catching 
his tuberculosis
or whatever
other
diseases in him
visiting hours
only for
one hour at a time
four times a day
rest of the time
he's alone
strapped to the bed
so
he doesn't remove
his breathing tube
or his feeding tube
or his foley tube
or any other tube
wretched
no human should
have to face
this
no human should
have to face this

no human should
have to face this

sorry
about that
my uncle
is dying.

my uncle
has lived a hard life
but
he was a surrogate father
when my father left me

my uncle ran with
a biker gang
did drugs,
hard drugs
decided to clean up
and
got beat in the head
before he could testify
with a baseball bat
outside a bar.

i've only held
human brains once
but they were his.

he never was 
quite the same
a droop on his face
a unsteadyness in his step
and he went
from 200 lbs
to 160 lbs
to 118 lbs
(his weight now)

pitiful on
a 6'2"" frame

he cut his hair
last year
had shoulder length hair
same color as mine
bluer than blue eyes
scruffy beard
(he could never grow a beard)

he is
the last brother
of my mother
and 
since my grandparents
have died
over the past four years
the only tenuous strand
between my mother 
and the void of being alone

my wife feels
this void
because she doesn't have
the insulation of
parents
she is at the top of 
her family tree
but she has
five siblings

my mother has
just this one
then 
she'll be alone
and 
there will be 
no branches near her
just below her.

so,
if i'm out
this week or the next
you know why.

-=-=-

got to see
my baby brother's
new baby last saturday
brian joseph potter, jr.

huge baby
for being
about a week old
he's big!

watched
latin kings of comedy
with my wife
(who's hispanic)
and his girlfriend
(who's hispanic)
and
it was more fun
watching the ladies
than watching the comics.
their faces
told the whole story.

it's true!
tantaran!
(accent on the last a)
wait for me!
right now right now?
chingasos!

i had an 
anglo childhood
but
all my friends
were hispanic.
my parent's friends
were hispanic.
my father and grandfather
spoke fluent spanish.
my mother knew quite a bit,
and so
i was exposed
to a bit of this
but
i'm still white bread.

-=-=-

sorry for the depressing stuff
but
that's what's on my mind.

when i left you last
we had just left kerrville
on our way to san antone
so yeah
we get to school about 12:20
(just narrowly avoiding 
the predicted time of 12:30)

i unleash the herd on unsuspecting parents
call my wife
and she picks me up ~1:10
i get home about 1:20.

upload some file
(you might have seen it)
then
off to bed with me.

but
wife decides
to talk to me
and i say un-huh and yeah a lot
i think 
it was two
when i finally don't remember anything.

got woke up at 10
wife thought
i wouldn't want to sleep the day away
why wouldn't i?
i mean
i only got eight hours sleep
in the past 
(carry the one)
52 hours
why wouldn't i want to sleep the day away
so
i'll be off in a bit.

wife had the day
planned out
off to stevenson to
finish some crap
then to the mall
i thought
just to get my sunglasses and
get our glasses adjusted

but no,
first
she doesn't have neough clothes
even though
she has the bedroom closet
and i have
a spare bedroom closet.
she needs more
five shirts
two sweaters
oohhhh-kay!

then we go
to get my sunglasses
and get our glasses fixed
and buy some hard cases for them as well

then
i figure
hey, sam goody has a sale
i can get some good cd's
and got

The Cream of Clapton
All Time Greatest Hits by Lynyrd Skynyrd
The Spirit of Radio by Rush

normally $16.99 to $19.99
but for me
three for $25.
cool!

then 
she's thirsty
so i get her a fruit smoothy
and she has to sit down and drink it
s l o w l y . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 
(yeah, that long)
then she's hungry 
and wants a pretzel
and, oh yeah, 
can you get me something to drink?

then
""ooh, let's look at yankee candle...""

thirty minutes later
back to dillards
because they have jewelry 75% off
but
ooh - shiny metal and leather
off to the purses

i sit in shoes at about 5:20
mall closes at 6:00
she gets me at 6:15.

didn't nod off but i got close.

then
ooh, we need to go to the bank atm.
can you get the money?

then
ooh we need to fill up the tank
because the tank is at
3/4 full.
can you get the gas?

then
ooh we need to go to walgreens
because i need a pecan chewie
can you get it for me.

home about seven
and she says
what are we doing for dinner.

if i didn't know better
i'd swear she was eating for two.

ate my pizza
she ate hers
and i've been checking up on the world since.

that takes us to now.

such is life
guess who's back on day one?
ah, sweet life.

this is just a tribute.

(started at 11:45ish friday evening)

yeah, i can't sleep in a 
strange bed
but
i can lie down in one
i can rest in one 
i can get some relaxation 
in one
not like having to sit in a 
chair
all night
outside my room
with nothing to do
because
i can't trust students
to stay in their rooms

yeah, i'm a fool
because
i didn't bring
a roll of masking tape
but
the front desk
is a bunch of cheap bastards
for not having
ANY
tape
it's a freaking hotel
for crissake!
no tape whatsoever?
what did you put up those
""POOL CLOSED
BECAUSE WE DIDN'T THINK AHEAD
AND ACCIDENTALLY DROPPED
SOME CEILING TILES IN THE POOL
WHEN WE REPLACED THEM""
signs?

no tape.
no elevator
do you know how
fun
it is to 
climb
up
stairs
when your
knees are 
bone on bone
and you just
played ddr and
did other things
to tire out your 
math team kids so
they'd go to bed at
a decent hour instead
of staying up all night
(like they usually do anyways)

so
yeah
up and down
down and up
and no one 
has a clue about
what time 10:30 is

so it's like
uuhhhhh!
i have no idea
where my other roommates are

so
instead of
spending the night
just
<EM>occasionally</EM>
looking at the students
i get to spend it in the
HOLIDOME(tm)
(basically an indoor pool
with some other amenities
like video games
and a 8' x 8' putt putt golf course)

sitting all alone
(because i scared off
everyone who'd talk to me)

waiting for maybe 3:00
(or for all the lights
to go off and stay off for a while
at least until
i'm reasonably sure
everyone is asleep)

then i can go in
(careful not to disturb mike)
and get some 
(like an hour)
down time before i grade
(for eight hours)
then get to travel home
(another eight hours)
<EM>then</EM>
get some sleep
(that is, unless 
my wife wants to talk to me
like she did after bridgeport
until 2:30 AM)

so that's my life
i suck at DDR
(although i finished the level
it was all ""D""'s)

i suck at pool
(although i almost made the eight
at the break
and forced ashley/jackie
to knock it in!)

i suck at 
driving a truck
(but really,
who uses that skill)

i suck at 
driving a motorcycle
(but, hey
what bike would support me
certainly
not the ones in the arcade :/ )

i suck at 
packing
(since i remembered a change of clothes
but forgot
A FREAKING ROLL OF TAPE!!!!!!1112 )

so i
got to call my wife
in the 
HOLIDOME (tm)
in front of 
everyone and their dog
and she decides 
NOW
that she wants to be lovey dovey
and say i love you
and kiss kiss
and all that mushy stuff
I WANT WHEN I'M HOME WITH HER
AND SHE WON'T GIVE ME THE TIME OF DAY!!!!!!!!1111111one

at least
i found my ""good"" battery
for my laptop
(the one that has
maybe twenty minutes of juice)
passed mike to get it
(he's still on the phone heh)

rambling on
i know 
but 
i've got to spend the time
somehow
and since i type at like
the speed of light
(as a student noted last year)
i get my ideas down
about
as fast
as they come in my head
(misstyped that as ass!)

strangely appropriate

the video games here
are quiet
but the stuffed animal claw
(oooh the claaaaaw!)
makes this
knock-knock-knock noise
every five minutes
which distracts the $#!7 out of me
when it goes off
and 
my laptop is 
TOO CHEEP
to watch the movie
that ashley brought me
(suicide girls,
i think it has that girl
that played gogo yabari
from kill bill 1,
at least i remember reading that.)

did i mention
the hotel is 
cheap as F*CK!

i mean
i sure know how to pick them
ceiling tiles
dropping in the pool
paint peeling off
of just about everything
torn carpeting in the lobby
(the freaking lobby?
i mean
that's the first thing
a shriner sees
when the come in drunk
and i tripped on it
making my knees feel
ever
so
much
FREAKING
better!)

so, yeah
and yet it's better
than the one 
three and two years ago
when
there were
freaking wall units
above the door
(i swear
there were probably 
radiators there, too)
and reefer madness, too.

mind rambling
because
there's nothing to do
but type here

so 

this is not 
the longest lj in the world
no,
this is a tribute... :)

hey, there's a workout room
i could, like
do a stationary bike
(the only exercise
apart from swimming
(thanks ceiling tiles!)
that really doesn't hurt
my knees)
(ooh, nested parenthesis)
but
I GOTTA STAY UP 
AND WATCH MY 
UNTRUSTWORTHY
STUDENTS!

stephanie and susan
decided
to go get a 
rollaway bed
after lock-in
because
god forbid
they should share a bed
like everyone else

when did math team get so
ELITIST?
everywhere i go
""this place is crap""
""why do we go to sucky places""
""they only give medals""

talking to random
earlier
saying
math team is the largest
it's ever been
and that
it's good
and it's bad

see
we used to have 
team unity
and now
we have cliques

if you're on math team
you have
four or five people
that you get along with
that you enjoy spending
time with
and the rest
you tolerate
(or in the case of a 
select few
you just don't kill when i'm around)

it probably shouldn't be more
than twenty
i mean
lubbock has about that many
klein has about that many
azle has about ten
bridgeport has about ten
and they bring home state championships

i suck as a math team coach
because
i don't make my team practice
worse
i don't make them
WANT
to practice.

i'm not sure how eli will do
on tomorrow's test
but i'm concerned

this might be 
the first year
the o.c.
goes home
with no scholarships
(let's see if l leave this in the lj entry!)
(heh i did!)

this is not 
the longest lj in the world
noo-oo-ooh
this is a tribute.

another thing
i hate
about hotels
is the $1.25
sodas
i mean
come on
you're already charging
$.50 for local calls
(and no internet access 
except for dialup
and i'm a cheap bastard
so no internet
which is why
this sucka gets backdated!)
so
yeah 
screw the
caffinated!

more beeping
from the games
at least
some lights are going out
looks like
my plan worked
(not my plan
to be in a bed tonight
but my plan to
tire out
the math team
at the bowling alley
where 
no one actually bowled!)

heh

billiards -- yeah
ddr -- hell yeah
other assorted video games -- yeah
$2.49 pretzels, 

well,

yeah. 

:/

why the F*CK
is everything
sooooooo
EX-FREAKING-SPENSIVE!

i mean
this is midland
part of the 
permian basin
they drill for oil here
they process oil here

(eli: i think the word is refine, mr. p.)

they <EM>refine</EM> oil here
and yet
it's $1.79/gal
for the cheap stuff

it's more expensive
than in sa
(except for that
mainland road gas station
wtf $1.97 for regular unleaded
just two days ago!
can you say SCAAAAAAA-REEEEWWWWWW'd?

loud giggles
sounds like girls
there must be
another group
of girls here
because
they are much too young to be my girls
and
i saw a bunch of
tennish or twelvish looking
girls
(one almost summersaulted into me
earlier this evening)

our bus driver
is no mr. torres
but he's pretty cool

bobby hill
no,
not that bobby hill 
not 
son of
""propane and propane accessories""
but
a pretty nice
older gentleman
who
doesn't mind
half the crew
leaving out the back door
(you know,
only in case of emergency exit!)

this is not
the longest lj in the world
noooooooooo-ooh
this is a tribute!

the car game
is squealing at me
i mean
the truck game 
i played 
didn't squeal this much
but
it's going
eeerrrrrrch!
eerrrrrrrrch!
(is that houw you spell it?
i'm horrible at speeling you know!)

mike just 
turned out the light
so i guess
he's in for the night
(nighty-night mike.)

ash and dan's light
appears to be out as well
(but not the others.)

curse you powerpuff girls!!!!!!!!!!11111111eno

and why the 
(not gonna say it
not gonna say it
not gonna say it...)

F*CK!
is the deck wet
i mean
the tiles fell 
yesterday
and it's still wet

well
i know this
b/c 
i'm wearing socks
because
i've worn shoes for 
just
too
long 
today
and my feet hurt quite a bit.
(oh, yeah,
and my knees, too
did i mention that
bone on bone y'know.)

in case you were wondering 
the games here are

""TOP SPEED""
(a racing car game
you know, steering wheel and all
well
okay 
not all, the gearshift is missing
so there's just this
hole)

""SUPER STREET FIGHTER""
(yeah, that old
i remember
when the original SF came out.
i'm really dating myself
(not like anyone else would...) )

""SOUL EDGE""
(apparently
hicks get hostile 
here in m-town!)

(can i call it m-town?)

and the clicking ""SKILL CRANE"" game
where the claw
(ooooooh!  the claaaaaw!)
dives 
DEEP
into a bunch 
of thirty cent stuffed aminals
(yeah, i meant that)
and pretends to grab one
(big sign that says
DO NOT TILT
and the letters are tilted
how ironic!)

and a snack machine
that looks full
and flashes where
the dollar bills go
but
the light aren't on.

12:30
brief pee break
had to go
empty 
and
get a refill
so
got another diet coke
(#3 on my vigil)
and 
the dallas morning news
hopefully it'll be
more exciting than
the m-town local press
all 52 pages of it.

and check'd the rooms
in this order
236 - light on
(john, york, and adrian)
235 - on
(nick, ryan, nathan)
233 - off (yay!)
(justin, guy, don)
230 - off
(mike and me)
215 - off
(dan and ash)
204 - on
(elias, oliver, anthony, henry)
203 - on
(random, greg, james, kevin)
103 - off (i'd hope so)
(bobby hill)
112 - off (yay!)
(karen, stephanie, jackie, susan)

oooh
oliver
pisses me off
so
it's like
he does stuff 
intentionally
to piss me off
oooooh!

i lock people in
and
of course, i have no tape
so
my chaps
watch the doors
whilst i check the other rooms
and i'm on the bottom
checking in the girls
when
i hear him
yelling and mocking
daniel and me
so
i go up stairs
pound on the door
(i'm such a hater)
and chew him a new 455

i'm NOT
taking him
to la joya in march
i'm sorry
but
he's just too much
trouble
and i know
you guys voted
to keep him on
but
ooooooh!

zathrus is holding up
fairly well
i mean
there's no power plug
at the
HOLIDOME (tm)
so
i have to rely on
his less than illustrious
battery life

okay,
there are plugs, 
but not near the tables
and
i don't feel 
like moving a table,
since the
HOLIDOME (tm)
is technically
CLOSED (tm)
after 10PM
so i'm here
ILLEGALLY (tm)

this is not
the longest lj in the world
noooooooo-ooooooo-oooooh
this is a tribute.

strange
the people you see
in a hotel
HOLIDOME (tm)
at 12:30 at night
(12:30 in the morning you idiot.)
okay,
12:30 in the morning
a woman
who looks like a bag lady
but 
she has a 
container of ice
and 
she's eating it
not just
sucking on a cube
but
like
i've watcher take
two handfuls
and crunch crunch crunch
and omg
she just got more!
(or
she's putting some back
eewwwwwwww!)
and now
she's walking back to her room.

heh
all the chaps 
are asleep

well, at least
i think mike is
unless
he's chatting on the phone
with whomever
he was chatting with before
some female type i hope
but not one female type i fear)

and
a case can be made 
for dan and ash
being asleep
because
i know
ashley didn't sleep 
last night
and not much sleep on the bus
either
(and i imagine
daniel keeps similar hours)

so
they might just be asleep.

possibly.

i enjoyed playing pool
with ashley and jackie
except for
when ashley would take a shot
and i'd have to turn around
to keep from 
staring
down the front of her tank.
since
frankly dear
you do wear revealing clothing
and
i don't think
i'm the one that 
you want to reveal to. :/

""everyone wants to sleep with me""
i think that's what it says.
of course
it has a teddy bear on it
so it's supposed to be cute
but
there's nothing like
innuendo
(in your what?)
innuendo
(what?)
(end0)
to keep a mind just 
sleightly 
(yeah i know)
off guard.

and another
off topic comment
i'm an uncle again
yeah,
my brother's more fertile
than i am
(actually 
it's his wife that's fertile
i mean
you could say it's not his
but
could you say it's not hers
i mean
it sprang from her
not fully clothed like athena
but 
yeah
you know

he's a junior
brian joseph potter junior

FREAKOUT!
there's a bird in here
it just 
walked
(okay, hopped)
past me on the 
faux deck
(just some sea green painted two-by-fours)
and is behind me now
i think it wants to eat my brain.
(good luck with that
i think i lost it a while ago.
i'm just on stream of consciousness here.)

back to my brother
i mean
he doesn't take care of
his daughter
who lives in michigan
and he sees
like every summer
(but that's it)
and she stays with
nah-nuh

*TWEET*

but
yeah
i mean
we've been trying

*TWEET*

for a child for a while
(okay
not really trying
not lately
but that's a topic for 
another lj entry)

and he just
keeps
popping them out
(okay
he's not popping them out
he's doing something 
but not popping out children.)

and he's got a pair
boy and girl
i want 
a boy and girl
my wife wants

*TWEET*

two boys and two girls
because
she misses her mother
and doesn't have a close sibling
to share that loss with
and she doesn't want our children
to share that loss.

her mother died
when she was 74
and my wife was 34.

her mother died
when she was 90
and she was 60.

my mother-in-law
never stopped missing her mom
i can understand that
i even saw
her crying a few times
and i imagine 
that's why

and i can understand
my wife
will miss her mother
forever
i have no problem with that

this is not 
the longest lj in the world
noooooooooooo,
this is a tribute.

damn flashing soul edge game
it keeps flashing every once in a while
like every two minutes
and it's in my 
peripheral vision so 
i can't help 
but see it
since
i'm keeping an eye on 
the rooms
(which seem a bit darker than before
perhaps
they're just watching tv
in the dark
or maybe
...they're conspiring behind my back... )

there's videotape of me
ddring
so
for the sake
of your children
having to grow up with blind parents
DO NOT WATCH IT
no matter what
people tell you
i mean 
when there's
ONE FREAKING ARROW on the screen
who missed that?

...potter.

*TWEET*

all the rooms here
have 
full-on-patio-door-sized-windows
next to the front door
so
you can see what's going on
if the curtains
are even
sleightly
agape
(that's uh-gaip, not uh-gah-pay)
so
that's what i'm refering to
when i say
that people are still up
that 
i can see their lights.
(12:50)
heh daniel and ashley are coming.

-=-=-

(3:30)
well
finally got rid of ashley & daniel
felt like
i was keeping them up
felt like
they were obligated to be with me
and i didn't like it

i like you guys
a lot
but 
i don't want people 
spending time with me
b/c you feel sorry for me
thanks for the company though
i appreciate it.

went walking about
walked them to their room
and
only one light still on.
one last holdout -- 304
worrisome, since it's the one
three seniors are in
so
hope they get enough sleep
to get some 
cash
money
yo!
<s>tomorrow</S>today.

had fun 
chatting with
the common-law couple
told them 
my life story
(probably bored them
to tears
but they're too nice
to mention anything)

self deprecating comments
not trying to get
complements
but just
stating things as they are.

and discussion
about gender equity
and racial equity
all very civil
well
as civil
as three nerds can be
(while not trying to wake
everyone else up)

shhhhhhhhhhh!

it's very quiet
at 3 am.
no one is around
but 
the local rent-a-cop
that came by
a couple of times
but never really harassed us
guess
i look like an adult
(hah!)

yeah, i'm a big crybaby
so what.
(and i mean that both ways it can be taken.)

""yeah
room 112 is close
to the other rooms""
so saith
the front desk clerk

it's down a freaking hallway
i can't even see it 
without straining my neck
hence the walkabouts

whilst walking with 
ash and dan
saw a nice room
perfectly set up
could have put the girls in here
centrally located
on the same floor as everyone else
but nnooooooooooooo!
they have to be
tucked 
in a back corner
that's hidden
from the rest of the freaking hotel!

haven't gone in
to bother mike
figured
someone should get some sleep
for the long busride
and he's already done his time
with all the graveyards.

this is not
the longest lj in the world
oooohhhhhh no.
this is a tribute.

we'll see how things go
tomorrow
how well i can grade
since 
i've been up 24 hours now.
i'll crash for a bit
on the bus
like my usual 20 minutes or so
not really a sleep
just kind of a power nap

cellphone is not working well
so
i can't view the internet that way
and
i'll be damned
if i'll pay 
50<s>c</S> to make
a freaking local call
(isn't that what payphones are for)

on diet coke #5
still got my dallas morning news
unread
but so much fuller
than the m-town gazette
(wanted to put two z's in there.)

so
i think i'll stop this shenanigans
and describe the trip up here...

first
nisd can't cut a check
to save their lives
i only had the request in
three weeks ago
(that's three school weeks, not calendar)
but
they say
""oh
we didn't know
you <em>needed it</EM> needed it.
we could have had it for you
at three on thursday
so you wouldn't have to come in friday""

grrr.

so
jennings offers to get the check
for me
and i offer to cover his 1st period
algebra 2 regulars

friday comes

<B>first period</B>

i get to school
and
mrs j is tending to
sick child
at the doctors
so jennings
is getting her sub stuff ready
and his sub stuff
(for me)
ready

kids are taking 
the taks test
but
with all the ag crap
somepeople are
just starting
others have had 
three days
and need to turn it in
still others
skip his class
(you know, first period
it happens)
so they're in the middle

so 
it's a hodgepodge
everyone at different places
jennings makes a new seating chard
one girl refuses to sit there
and leaves.

o.0

leaves.

o.0

so, yeah, truant.
i put it down
act like nothing's happened.

she comes back in five minutes later
and says
i want my report card
and i say
no
you're not here
remember
you're truant
remember
and she's like
it's mine
and i'm like
no
it's mr. j's 
until he gives it to you
and since i'm 
acting-mr-j
not until i give it to you
will you sit in your seat
and she says no
and i say okay.
(yeah, now i'm really sounding like a twelve-year-old-girl. :/ )

seniors 
in the back
don't have to take it
so
they're playing guitar

""dave's beginnings
ooohoooohooooh!""

(five points if you can name 
where that comes from!)

so it's like
let me play
a few chords
of my favorite song
let's go through
the green day catalogue
let's play random chords
but
they were nice
really quiet
just
pling pling pling
nothing hard
no
strum strum strum
like acoustics can go
not disturbing
considering
most students i know
study/take quizzes/take tests
with headphones so loud
i can hear them
(yeah, even when they're at home :) )
(that last parenthesis was for daniel!)

jennings comes through
with the check
just in time
so 
yay jennings
he's coming through this week
think 
he feels sorry 
for not doing as much this year
so he's making up for lost time.

<B>second period.</B>

get to my room
my sub looks 
cool and relaxed
because
potter's classes are the $#!7
you know
three in one
six in another
nineteen in the last
but wait
half are here with me
nerdy quiet types!

so we all socialize
and wait
for ten o'clock
to board the bus
and at 9:30
i get a call
you're busdriver's here

so we wait
until 9:45 
and caravan en-masse to the bus

of course
i tell people 
to be there at 10 
so they get their stuff at 10
we leave at 10:10

on the road again

right when we hit boerne
the clouds disappeared
clear sailing
all the way to midland
but
altogether too much sun
wish i had my 
prescription sunglasses
they broke the lenses
and i said
don't call until 
ALL FOUR ARE READY
and they called saying
ALL FOUR ARE READY
so i get there
and they say
HEY ONLY THREE ARE READY
and i'm like 
WTF
and they're like
DO YOU WANT THEM OR NOT
and i'm like
HEY I'M F*CKING BLIND 
OK I'LL TAKE THEM

so i'm still waiting

<B>fredericksburg</B>

in san antonio
they have these
""bordertown"" type restaurants.
you know,
half taco bell
half kfc
(because kentucky (tm) is trademarked!)

here
they have combo taco bell/pizza hut
so
everyone wants pizza
but
everyone gets taco bell
o.0

a few hours later
jackie tells me
she left her purse there.
-.-

<B>menard.</B>

i've made this trip
dozens of times
when i lived in lubbock
and my family lived in sa
so
i know 
all the cool places to stop
and eat
and pee
and crap
(not that type of crap!)

so i tell 
the busdriver
stop at the texaco super s
because
back then
(back in the day
you know 
1999
it was a texaco super s)

but now
it's a super s
and our bus driver is 
sleightly
hard of hearing
so he passes it
and i'm like
no, here
and he pulls into
an exxon
but
it's just
gas & restrooms
and 
the girls rr doesn't have
a door
o.o
(or so i heard)
so just the stall door
protecting your business
from nerdy hormone-dripping-d00dz

and
you can't buy candy/chips/soda
b/c
there's no ""inside""

oh well

<B>san angelo</B>

we stop in san angelo
at the right spot
even though
this name has changed, too.
was a circle k
don't remember what it is now
but
everyone went inside
i finally get to call
the kerrville tb/ph
and they have her purse
so 
we'll have to stop there
when we go back.

<B>midland</B>

wtf
when the bus stops
why does everyone 
get off
like 
i'm NOT going to say something
like i do
EVERY TIME WE STOP!

and
IT TAKES TIME TO GET 
ROOM KEYS
ESPECIALLY IF YOU WANT
TWO KEYS FOR EACH ROOM!

so
i get them
people check in
people wait for the busdriver
clamoring to leave at 6:45
when i said
i'd let you have until seven

yeah,
they're on time
when ddr is on the line

peeps have to have priorities, right?

(aside...
i just reached 
the character limit
for notepad
in win98
so

this is not
the longest lj in the world
nooooooooooo ooooooooh   ooooooooooh!
this is a tribute!

end aside...)

<B>AMF bowling lanes</B>

everyting in midland has
funky acronyms.
AMF, WTF
(that's west texas frontier,
not what teh f*ck!)

so, yeah
they have
one 
ddr machine
and 
it's old and decrepit
and 
apparently
people in midland
aren't as into ddr
as 
people at the o.c.
because 
people came by
to watch the kids
play this
and marveled
and stood there 
awestruck
like this was some
footloose town
and elias was kevin bacon.

yeah
i got on the ddr machine
but
there's no proof
no matter
what videos may show up
or
what pictures may appear.
so
you never saw this!

elias got his initials on
mike got his initials on
so
it was pretty good

played jackie and ashley 
in pool
and 
almost sunk the
eight on the break
(i mentioned that before)
and won
because they later
had no choice to sink the eight
because the 2 and 7 were touching it
and the eight was just
h
a 
n
g
i
n
g
on the lip of the cup

so it was fun.

<B>meanwhile back at the hotel...</B>

get back about 9:30
people play
pingpong
miniature golf
stare at the pool
(it's closed, remember)

such is life
until the
HOLIDOME (tm)
closes at 10
and everyone
gets kicked out

wtf?

who kicks people
out of 
what essentially is
the lobby of a hotel?

weird.

so 
people are in rooms
until 10:30
i start going around
checking rooms

and people 
have no concept of 
time

lock people in rooms
and they try to come out
even at 2:30
303
decided to take the chain off their door
turned on, then off their light
then pulled the curtain
me, ashley, and daniel
waved back at them
and the curtain slammed shut
(well
as much
as cloth can slam)

so i've run
full circle
it's 4:10
and the train is coming by
and what's on my mind 
is from my cousin vinny
when he is woken up by the train
and asks the deskclerk about
if the train coming by
is out of the ordinary
and he says
yeah,
it normally comes 
earlier.

i'm gonna
lay down for a while.
so
bye!

this is not 
the longest lj in the world
no oh oh
this is a tribute!

-=-=-

on the road again

yep,
on the road
back to san antone
and we did
about
what i expected
us to do

elias ended up
getting the scholarship
and yeah,
i was wrong to doubt you
but 
i was basing it on
the amount of work 
that you put into it.

tried to go
to the back of 
the bus
but a big
NOOOOO!
came back
so i decided
i'll stay in the front
let you guys have the back
and have some ""you"" time.

and
of course
wer'er lating in embarking 
on the road again
i mean
we go to this contest
first because it's WTF
(West-Texas Frontier, thankyewverrymuch!)
and second
because of
cash money yo!

elias got some
and would have gotten more
if he had gotten
one question
right instead of wrong.
oh well
just one question behind
the student he beat last time

i don't mind
grading
number sense
or mathematics
or science
or computer science

but i
hate
despise
oooh evil!
grading
calculator applications

i mean
you have to check
the sign
the numbers
the decimal place
the ""timestentoteh""
and the exponent
and <em>it's</EM> sign.

it's like
checking
six things in one
freaking hard
and 
coaches love
ribbing you
""uh,
i think
you made a mistake here""
and you gotta
regrade that question
and if you <em>were</EM> wrong
you gotta 
change the score
and initial by your new score
to show you approve of the change.

calculator is so
subtle
i mean
numbers can be
so confusing
and misleading
(like centimeter long ""decimal"" points.
sorry i thougt
it looked like a one...)
the math/sci/compsci
are so easy
block capital letters
number sense is eas
if it looks funny
IT'S WRONG!!!!!!!!!!!

just entering
garden city
funny name 
for a town that
really is in the 
middle of nowhere
(or are we
in the middle 
of knowwhere?)

our route:
midland
to garden city
to sterling city
to san angelo
to eden
to menard
to junction
to kerrville
(to get a purse)
to boerne
to san antonio

that's our journey
described in 
little jaunts 
from twenty-five to forty mile increments

know why?
well
that's about how far
settlers could travel 
in one day 
from a town
so
they'd ""settle"" in
for the night
and
these ""settle""ments
became these towns

if yuo think about it
every road you travel
is broken up by towns
(albeit some small)
twenty-five to forty miles apart
like
san antonio to austin?
san antonio
to new braunfels
to san marcos
to austin

easy, huh?

soooooooooooooooo happy
i got to get 
some ibuprofen 
when i got to the whataburger
i mean
you never heard such whining
people
complaining
about where we were eating
even though
i mean
where were we
SUPPOSED 
to eat?

no restaurants 
for miles and miles
so
we eat there.
deer and elk heads
mounted on the walls
a stuffed bobct
poised to strike
it's prey, a lonely jackrabbit.

you know, west texas. :)

so i get
a chicken finger basket
and
the fries that it came with
was WAAAAAAAAAY
too salty.
i mean
it burned my mouth 
it was that salted.

oh well.

-=-=-

mebbe
i didn't go to you
because
i perceived that 
you wanted me to
i went
because 
i wanted to go
because
i wanted to leave
because
i got tired
of being by myself
i wanted to go go go
somewhere 
far aways
someewhere 
near and nestling
somewhere
closer to your heart.

-=-=-

sorry about that
i lost some
coherency
and my mind warbled
i'll try to keep that from happening...

and 
what's up with
the pickiness of
math team
i know
when you want something
you want something
but
remember
m-town 
is a hick town
it doesn't even have
100k people there
so, yeah,
we want a place
that has chinese
and a pizza hut
and...
and..
and.

and yet
all i hear is
complaints
about the
combo taco bell/pizza hut
we were at in kerrville
so
can't win ever
so why try
hence whataburger.

the complaints
are really getting to me
""this hotel is trashy!""
""are we really eating here""

did no one teach you tact?

is that my job?

this is not
the longest lj in the world
no-oh-oooh
this is just a tribute...

minor catastrophe
this morning
didn't get everyone on the bus
until 8:20
everyone but
daniel and ashley
o.0
apparently
they went to bed
at fivish
had a wake-up call
at sevenish
and went back to sleep

the 
HOLIDOME (tm)
has light
S T R E A M I N G
in the room
so it's bright
and 
they come in
sheepishly
to the bus
and we are off.

there
(lee high school)

<BLOCKQUOTE><Q>Mr. Potter, why'd they copy from us?</Q></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P ALIGN=""RIGHT"">-Greg</P>

so 
we get there
and 
all we see
are elementary school
and middle school students
no high school students to be found
i mean
wtf
this is supposed to be
a high school meet as well
but
none to be seen.

so
we get signed in
i find a table
(actually a pair of tables)
only to find
math team prefer to 
S T A N D

okay 
so i give up my table
to some seven year olds
(okay, they just seemed that young
when they
SQUEALED
as only seven-year-olds can.

and i go to grade

it's not fun
believe me
i have my own papers
to grade
i really don't need 
to go
out of my way
hundreds of miles
to grade
hundreds of papers
so people can get
pieces of metal and cloth
that say wtf on them
(west-texas frontier)

but i do it
because
i believe in the program
i believe that it helps the students
i believe they get something out of it
(and not just out of classes on friday
and out of the house for the weekend.)

so
students test test test
i grade grade grade
and we all
wait wait wait
whilst they talk about making copies
not <EM>actually</EM> making copies,
but talk about making copies
how many copies to make?
single or double sided?
will dark green ink
(raises hand)
show up on a copy?

not very efficient
and i'd like to think
my kids know how to run
an efficient contest.

so
yeah.
heh.

on the road again

but nathan
forgot his lunch bag
at the hotel

lunch bag?

lunch bag!

so we HAVE to go back and get it.

so we stop 
and he gets off
and he gets back on after ten minutes.
and then 

on the road again

looking for a place
to get dinner
never ask 21 math team students
where they want to go for dinner
b/c 
you'll get 22 answers.

we go looking
for an enclave of restaurants
you know,
like in sa
where restaurants
tend to 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cluster
together
but
apparently
there's some kind of law in midland
that
a.)  restaurants can't be 
anywhere near 
an intersection of two roads
and
b.) restaurants can't be
within one mile of each other.

so
take business 20
to interstate 20
to the whataburger
the aforementioned one
with elkheads and crap

i get some 
(much needed)
ibuprofen
for my knees and caffiene headache

then

on the road again

so here we are
7:15 pm on sat
just typing away in the dark
relegated to the front of the bus
because
the back of the bus busy bodies bellowed ""NOOOOOOO!""

k,
i'll stay.

more later.

this is not
the longest lj in the world
no,
this is a tribute...

(7:57, san angelo)

you know 
i remember a time
when things were a lot more 
fun 
around here
when good was ""good"" and ""evil"" was evil.
before things got so...
fuzzy

hey,
i was once a golden boy like you
and i was summoned to the halls of power
in the heavenly court
and i dined with the deities
who looked upon me
with favor
for my talents,
and my creativity

and we sat
beneath the palms
in the warm afternoons
and drank the wine,
with fitzgerald and huxley

and they palmed the biting phrase
from tongues hot with blood
and drained their pens of bitter ink
vainly reaching for the bottle
full of empty edens,
branded specially
for the ones
who came with
great expectations
to the perfumed halls of allah

for their time in the sun.

and we were stoking the fires
and oiling up the machinery
until the guys found out
we had ideas of our own

and the world was rocked
and the earth was shaken
and there was no more room 
in the garden of allah.

today
i made an appearance downtown

i am an expert witness 
because i say i am

and i said
""gentlemen,
(and i use that word loosely)
i will testify for you

""i'm a gun for hire
i'm a saint
i'm a liar
because
there are no facts
there is no truth

""just data to be manipulated.

""i can get any result
you like,
what's it worth to ya?

""because
there is no wrong
there is no right
and i sleep very well at night

""no shame
no solution
no remorse
no retribution

""just people selling
t-shirts.

""just opportunities
to participate 
in the pathetic little circus

""and winning, winning, winning...""

MAN
i love that song!

it's just so...
(no adjective is sufficient here...)
(i mean it...)

so
lonely stretch of 87 
between san angelo and eden
waiting 
for the inevitable
dairy queen stop
(texas's stop sign)

and 
i think i'll enjoy it

(9:15)

trying
struggling
to find a comfortable position
where my head isn't pounding
against the glass when reclined
as the bus shakes down 83.

very upset
i mean
dairy queen said
they didn't close
until 9
yet at 8:45
""we're closed,
so you'll need to go away""

excuse us lepers
yeah, we're nerds
but
are we really that bad
for buisness
i mean
here we are
bringing 24 students 
on a bus
students
with no dessert
and wanting
ice cream
(despite the fiftyish temps)

and you say no
because you're lazy
because
there's nothing <EM>else</EM> to do
in eden 
than pull the wool
over guests eyes

ash asked
if something was wrong
so i lied
i didn't want to 
tell her
i felt unwelcome 
in teh back of teh bus.
i didn't want
a pity invite
as i know she'd do
so
i just said 
i was pissed about dairy queen
and she bought it.

it's okay,
i mean
you guys need
time by yourselves.

besides
you wouldn't want me 
back there anyway
i'm in one 
of my ""girly"" moods
as someone once described it.

-.- 
(at dairy queen, not you.)

so
got me a payday
(the peanut & caramel bar)
(is it care-uh-mel
or car-muhl?
i don't believe shaq,
but i want to know.)
and a ddp.

driving down 83
(the vietnam veterans highway)
and 
on the way up
we saw
a dead deer
on the side of the road
where'd it'd been hit
by a travelling car
and 
now i'm worrying 
about 
us hitting one
i mean
what happens
if a school bus hit one.

wonderful thoughts
luckily for me
the highway is only 53 miles long.

perhaps it's like vietnam...

already saw two deer
standing on the side of the road
staring at us as we drove past.

eerie.

hope you fools get to read this...

t h i s   i s   n o t
the longest lj in the world
nope, 
this is a tribute...

(10:00)

just remembered 
a funny conversation
with daniel last night
about how the heart symbol
looks weird to me

i've always mentioned that
it looks like
male genetalia.

<3

take a look at it
and guess
which is the franks and
which are the beans.

meaningless things
that float through
my minds eye
when it's all too dark
and people
are busy beeping
and playing with gameboys
and
telling their dark secrets.

""I CAST MAGIC MISSLE AT...THE DARKNESS!!!""

heh
love that video.

now on i-10
just left junction
on the way to
kerrville
(and jackie's purse
wonder
what's gonna be there
when we get there
or rather
what's not gonna be there

apparently
she left
all 
of her money
in her purse.

worst case scenario is
they don't have their purse
but i called
and they do

their drive-through
is open until midnight
(or later
think outside the bun
BOOOOOONNNNNGGGGGGG!)

so we'll get it there
worst case scenario now is
that it's empty
or in tatters
or reeks of 
sleightly used refried beans
(ewwwww!)

kerrville 47
san antonio 113

it's nice
to see a city marker sign
that lists your hometown

that is of course
if you like where you live
(which i do)

i'm amazed
at how zathrus
is holding up.
he's at 56% batt life
so 
kewl kewl kewl!

everyone's chatting
and 
eerie glow from potter's seat
like
he's giving birth
to some
glow-in-the-dark
rectangular beast

funny that
i'm reclining
and my legs are in
the stirrup position
with the travel tub lid
supporting zathrus
(you know,
can't go infertile
due to laptop heeeeeat!

heeeeeat

like agador
says in the birdcage
one of me and my wife's 
favorite movies
but
i think
robin williams
looks
creepily like my dad in that movie.

want to picture my dad?
picture robin williams in the birdcage
but
with a large nose

did i ever mention
that a large nose is
a distinctive trait
of my family?

for many generations,
really

and somehow
i didn't get it
makes me wonder, though
do i carry recessive genes
for the schnozz?

hmm....
the things you think of
when you don't want to be social.
hmmmm.......

-=-=-

just saw
the old segovia road exit
and it reminds me
of the last time
i was in kerrville
(prior to this time)
and when i was on this
part of i-10.

my wife and i got married
(yeah, i know, surprising)
and she was going to move in 
with me
in my apartment
in lubbock

so 
we packed her stuff
in a u-haul truck
and 
my brother and i
got ready
to drive up to lubbock

now, 
trucks like this
have a regulator
so you can't really 
drive faster than 55
and my wife can be
a speed demon
so we left
a full two hours 
before she did.

trucks like this
also guzzle gas
so we had to refeul in 
...
kerrville,
but
when we stopped the engine
and put in gas,
the engine wouldn't restart.

out comes the
kerrville u-haul man
to come fix our truck 
which he does in about thirty minutes.

we're back on the highway
driving to junction
where we take 87 to go to lubbock.

we hear clunk
and the truck goes
from 50 to 10.

we look in the rear mirror
and
see our
t r a n s m i s s i o n
littering the highway

so,
we pull over.

now, this is 1996
and cell phones were
nowhere near as 
prolific as they are now.

and
we're just outside segovia
which
is not really a town
but just a sign and a dot on the map

so 
i get to hitchhike to junction 
about ten miles away
whilst my brother
keeps the truck company until
i can get u-haul guy to 
""fix""
the truck again.

main reason for
hiking to junction is this:
we always stopped for gas there
and i knew that my wife would stop there
so if she saw me
she'd know
we had trouble but we're allright
so i spent the next
F O U R H O U R S
going between phone and curb
looking for my wife exiting i-10
and turning onto 87.

unbenownst to me
my wife left 
and
passed us while we were in kerrville
envisioning 
catching up with us
and 
as each mile rolled by
and she hadn't caught up
she drove faster
determined to catch up
faster and faster
made it to lubbock
in five and a half hours.

my poor brother
has finally found mr. u-haul guy
who's brought a truck
(and sincere apologies)
and helps my brother
unload and reload the truck 
on the shoulder of i-10.

i'm stuck in junction
vainly looking for my wife
calling my mother-in-law
but she's not there...

my wife is in lubbock
trying to get into my apartment
but
i'm not there
i have the keys
and i haven't put her name on the lease.

my brother comes by
after two hours of 
loading and unloading
in the august afternoon sun
and picks me up

we drive to san angelo
to gas up again
and i call my mother-in-law
who says
she convinced the manager
to let her into the apartment

and i get the coldest shoulder
of our brief marriage
when i call.

anyway
to make a short story long
we get to lubbock at midnight
and
to make matters more fun
the truck is due at 8 am
or we get to pay for an extra day rental

ah, fun!

this is not
the longest lj in the world
noooooo-oooh
this is a tribute.

hope my chaps
in teh back
are keeping an eye
on a certain pair
to make sure
we don't bring back 
an extra azn.

o.0

10:45 right now
still miles from kerrville
miles more from san antone

ah, these bus rides are
so much fun

oh, wait
they aren't if 
you have no one to talk to
mike's asleep
(and in the back of the bus,
along with 
the ash and dan show
and cash-money-yo!-dude

so 
:/
boredom.

hence you get these stories.
in what is not the longest lj in the world
no, this is a tribute.

zathrus is tired
(31 %)
so this might be the end
but if it's not
you'll know

on the home stretch
got jackie's purse
seems
they found it 
right after we left
and put it safe in the safe
so
everything seems to be in order.

and hey
you can tell
we're getting near
san antonio
because
the soupy mix is back.

when we left
it was soupy/hazy/misty/ugly
and was clear outside of boerne
and now
we're coming up on boerne
and it's soupy/hazy/misty/ugly.

who'dafigured?

would it be
too 
much
to
ask
for the weather to be
just nice enough
to get to sa without complications?

i wrote 
midnight-thirty
on the permission forms
so it looks like
we'll be on time
(yay!)
of course, i put 2004 on them
so technically
we're a year late
(boo!)

kudos to you
if you read this far
if my stream of
con-shuhs-ness
didn't detract
or distract
or just make you say 
""screw this potter!
i don't need to know
this much anyway.""

yeah,
i got bored,
and decided to 
pour my 
heart
and
soul
into this
that's why they call it a journal, neh?

or did i miss something.

anyway
prolly too long to comment on.
but if you get the urge
i'll respond with
any clarifications
understandings
misgivings
concessions
or any other things
that may be required, needed, or craved.

"event","I lost a friend today.

I first met him at a math competition (strangely enough.)  He was the coach at Marshall, and I was at my first year at O'Connor.  It was civil enough, O'Connor was still a second year school, with a fledgling program, and Marshall was the king of the block, one of the top teams in mathematics and computer science.

I saw him again at UTSA.  He was working on his Ph.D. and teaching computer science courses, and still stopped in to talk.  He even covered a couple of classes when Cathy Key couldn't make it.  He was a wonderful teacher and friend.

Mike Maltrud was 35.

He passed away today from a heart attack.

This guy weighs less than half what I do, and it's a big shock.

This is a guy who is physically fit; he even was running on a track today.  That's where he passed away.

It's amazing how the loss of one person can put so much into realization, so much into focus.

Not that anyone cares, but I've been over 400 lbs for quite a while.  I got down to 379 last year, but neglect of my routine (along with the passing of my mother-in-law and subsequent dealing with my wife's depression) has put priorities in different spots.

I have been working on it.  People at O'Connor will tell you I've been eating healthier (and the fight for my unused croutons have been quite hilarious) but the fact is, I'm still a fat person.

He died of a heart attack.  It makes me wonder what my heart looks like.

Anyway, I know those of you at UTSA knew him quite a bit, so I'm sorry for your loss, too.  He was a wonderful, insightful teacher.

Sorry for violating silent Thursday.

"event","my wedding ring
used to be too big,
but i liked it that way.
it was a reminder
that being married was tough.

i remember the day
my wife and i went
to pick out our wedding rings.
two matching bands
perfect in their smoothness.

every day
my wife would ask me
""why don't you get it resized
you'll lose your ring
if you don't get it resized.""

but

if i got it resized,
then
i wouldn't remember 
how much effort it took
to keep it on;
a daily reminder of 
my love for her.

besides

it would have to be 
cut open
in order for it to get
smaller,
and some gold would be
removed,
and wouldn't that mean
our love could be broken
or some small bit was removed?
the perfect smoothness
would be forever marred.

so my ring was like this
for years,
each day an effort
to keep it on my finger.

then one day
my wife took my ring,
to get it cleaned 
she said,
to get it polished
she said,
but she had an ulterior motive.

i got it back
and
it was smaller
snugger
and 
there was this small
line
where the ring had been cut
where the gold had been removed
to make the ring 
snugger and smaller.

so now
i have a ring
but
i don't think about it
as much
because there's no real
effort
to keep it on.
i don't think about it
as much,

except
this one part
where the ring had been cut
where the gold had been removed
that chaffes;
it is this part
that reminds me
of what happened to my ring.

i was having conversation with my wife earlier tonight about grade inflation.  seems that she has a parent upset with her, because her class average is 79.

my thought - well, average is c, c is 75 to 79, so if you have a class average that is average, then you're doing something right.

the conversation switches to failure throughout higher education.  in high school, failing means an f.  in college, however, failure really is a d - a d in a course won't fulfill prerequisites, you can't have a d in your major or minor, a d won't transfer, etc.

in graduate school, failure is a c.

that's right - in graduate school, average is failing.  it can't count toward your degree, you must take it again, and if your gpa falls below 3.0, you go into probation.

(daniel's remembering the learning to think at mit book right now. :)

kinda makes sense.  do you really want a ""c"" doctor performing an operation on you?  do you want a ""c"" lawyer defending you on charges?  do you really want a ""c"" business student being president of the untied states?

(misspeelling intentional above)

(so was the obvious jab.)

i often comment about how i failed freshmen english twice and was 189th in my class, and how that doesn't really matter in the real world.

to be honest, after you get into college, your high school gpa doesn't really matter.

to be further honest, after you get a job, your college gpa doesn't really matter.

we tend to put a lot of emphasis on the grades we get when we're in the course, and to be honest, they don't matter much afterwards.

i always tried to reflect this in the advanced courses i taught (daniel and elias will attest to that.)  getting an a in my course didn't really mean you know the materials - people who got b's and c's often knew the material just as well.  people who got a's in my class might even be worse programmers.

not sure what i'm really trying to say, except don't sweat the small stuff (and unless it kills someone, literally, everything is small stuff.)

toodles.

"event","well,

after all my whining and moaning, everything turned out well

we only had one catastrophe.

the coffee maker.

essentially, the old coffee maker would brew, but the heating element wouldn't heat the coffee, so i had to wait for a math-team member with a car (thanks karen) to arrive so i could send them to the store to buy a coffee maker.  they did so, but it used a different filter size than the older one.

no problem, right.  i'm mr. potter, so i can fix anything.  this is just like apollo 13, except i've got more than a rocketship full of stuff to adapt.

well, the coffee maker didn't like my first filter (using my 1337 origami skillz to fold the old filter to fit the new filter resevoir,) belching coffee grounds out the sides and into the pot.

plan two didn't work, either (using paper towels as an impromptu filter) -- same result (coffee grounds on the floor and in the pot.

plan three was the charm - brew in the first pot, heat on the second pot.

anyway, if anyone had #4 filters, that's apparently what i need.  need to remember that come january 22nd, when i do this all again (again?) (again!)

cash flow in (so far) - $1022 & change.  of course, northside schools transfer money interdepartmentally, so it takes forever.  we'll get the money around december.

at least i don't have to worry about the background goings-on of a contest for two-and-one-half months.

props go to:
Elias - for ensuring a working J-K corridor, and filling in as a proctor, and his 1338 announcing skillz.

Henry - ditto

Random - for managing the cafeteria.  i think i used up all his minutes on his cell plan asking him what grade joe blow from podunk high school was in, since he didn't put it on his test.

Karen - for mad driving skeeziez, and the ability to discern the best deal for an impromptu coffee maker buy ($10.74, incl. tax.  way to go!)

everyone else who came through with what they said they were going to do.
slops go to:
Guy - who can't follow basic directions, even if they're numbered.  (come on, when the cokes are on a rolling chair going from my lab to the cafeteria, you need to lift the front end up when you get close to a bump, so the sodas don't fall) -- they only fell three times on the way to the cafeteria.

Oliver - for being his normal obnoxious self.  he does more antirecruiting (persuading math team members to not participate) than i do recruiting.

band director - who plans an impromptu practice and takes half my math team away with him. wtf?

oaf - for being a whiny girley man.  for real, i need to know that 
   a.  math team kids wait until the last minute
   b.  they pull it off at the last minute
       (they have lots of last-minute practice from their  classes)

Ashlee Simpson - hey - if you're going to be on <A HREF=""http://www.gh0.st/DAI/Ashley_Simpson_busted_on_SNL.avi"">SNL</A>, the L stands for ""live"", so learn to sing, damnit!

"event","okay, less than nine hours until I have to get to school for the contest, and today's been a real winner.

8:53 - got home from dinner with wife.  things are getting better, but i'm still stressing.

6:24 - left to make some copies, to find wife sitting on the J-building steps, fuming.  apparently she's been sitting there for 20 minutes, knocking, waiting for me  my cell phone ran out of juice hours ago (damn concrete walls in my lab don't let a signal through) so we vent at each other while i tidy up some things.

4:45 - call from woodfill, she asks if there's anytning i need for tomorrow, but i'm almost ready, so i say no but can you get some red pens from gann?  she calls back saying you need to call her, and gives me the extenion.  i call, and it's not hi, not hello, not this is me, but hello mr. potter.  you know when your parents call you by your full name you're in trouble?  well, teachers will call other teachers by their formal when they are upset.

seems that no one got my email from wednesday saying that i'll be using these four rooms, and anyone who has problems should contact me.  since i never got any  emails, i assumed no problems.  turned out no one got them -- they never got sent  -- e-mail at school was buggy that day, and they got lost in the void, and they have so much materials out that they are stressing in securing it all.  so, i goes to the k building to ask other teachers (not the affected ones, who are wigging out and stressing due to the five-minute notice, and am able to secure four other rooms, so i let them know i don't need their rooms.

oh, yeah, pruitt says had a student to attend to, so she couldn't come.

3:07 - really upset that i didn't get observed, especially since my class went really well.  my most troublesome class ended up performing wonderfully, and it's a shame she missed it.  i'll have to orchestrate another winning performance (locally called the dog-and-pony-show) next time.

2:06 - stressing about my upcoming observation.  teachers are only observed once a year the year they are observed (usually a three year cycle) and it determines my official performance standing, so i'm a bit leery.  seventh is usually my roughest class, as they've just came out of lunch, or they have sports immediately after.

also, a bit upset about the (more) cancellations of people who can't come saturday.  come on, people.  i only gave you the dates for this the FIRST WEEK OF SCHOOL, AT OUR ORGANIZATION MEETING, AND SAID ""THIS DATE IS SACROSANCT -- DON""T PLAN ANYTHING ON THESE DATES!!!!!IF YOU HAVE TO TAKE ACT, FIND ANOTHER DAY!!!!""  no one listens to zathrus.

1:15 - bit more pleasant period than fourth, but i still worry.  my seventh period has a will of it's own, and loves to push my buttons.  maybe having an ap in the classroom will calm discipline.  plus, it'll be all over.

12:22 - oh my god, my (usually) best behaved class just made me go through a minefield, constantly redirecting their attention.  one exchange went like this.

--please stop passing notes.
--it's not a note.
--is it a piece of paper with writing on it.
--well, it's a drawing, it's not printing or anything.
--if it's not a note, what would you call it.
--a note.
--please stop passing notes.

that was AFTER forty minutes of constant ""please be quiet"" ""can i have your attention"" and other such meaningless drivel to them.  they got held after class as well.  i can only imagine what's going to happen seventh when i get observed.

10:11 - mr potter?
-- yeah?
-- i think i put the plate on the wrong trophy
-- so, what should you do to fix it.
-- it won't come off
-- okay...

after finagling for fifteen minutes with a pair of needle-nose pliers, the student's finally get the marble bases exchanged, and you can't really tell.  not a very good start so far.  thankfully, the rest of the plates are put on without incident.

9:19 - mr. potter?
-- yeah?
-- does it matter how we put the stickers on?
-- what do you mean?
-- well, if the lamp sticker is upside down, does that really matter
-- yes, it does.  the lamp should be right-side up.
-- oh.

it's going to be one of those days, i can tell already.  and this is one of the students who will be here all day.

with help like this...

8:40 - mr. potter? 
-- yes.
-- this is mrs. oberpriller in the office.  you have a package, but they need a po number to release it.
-- okay, it's in my mailbox.
-- could you come down and get it?
-- well, i have a class.
-- they say they won't be able to give it to you if they don't have it.

so merrily i go to the office to take a piece of paper out of my box, and read it to someone so they can give me my trophy parts.  lovely fun.

-=-=-

so, that's what a snowball looks like rolling backwards.  if tomorrow goes without a hitch (and with five people, including proctors for four rooms, it just might not.)  i'll be happy.

"event","contest less than 60 hours away, and i'm stressing.

it's one of those things, a million things need to get done...

and i only trust myself to get them done right.

i know i should trust others 

i have people willing to work for me, 

but i need to ensure that they're done right.

the only person you trust is yourself.

the only one who can do thing the right way is you.

because only you know what you want done

and the way you want it done.

i'll get about six hours sleep in the next two days

and i'll be bitchy

and crabby

and bite the heads off a few people

(most of them deserve it)

but not all

so if i do,

please understand

it's who i am

i never said i was the worlds greatest teacher

i just aspire to be

i need to think i can be

that i make a difference

that i'm not ""just a hater"" and ""don't understand""

maybe that's why i'm such a pushover

or a fool

i'm sure thats what everyone thinks of me

look at the fool

what a fool

(a big fat old balding fool)

ask ron popeil for the spray-on hair for that icon

but

i feel like rambling

like some <A HREF=""http://www.yhchang.com/"">young hae chang</A> production

and

sorry for the lack of bunnies in my response, mike and eli.

<A HREF=""http://www.angryalien.com/0704/alienbunnies.html"">try here instead</A>

you know the feeling

that you have an immense project to do

and no time to do it

(alright,

(you have all the time in the world,

(you don't have the energy to do it

(you don't have the will to do it

(you don't have the strength to do it

(and no one cares.)

BTW

bandaid hurts

like heck

when it's ripped off the wound

i'm a hairy sob

s.o.b.

you know what i meant.

and it's not healing right

apparently,

i'm allergic to stitches,

my body rejected them by not healing

and now i have a wide open wound on my hand

it's been here for almost a month

and shows no sign of going 

(home

(to visit it's children

(in woundland)

i'm ranting,

but it's my journal, so 

(in the immortal words of hunter)

stfoodles.

yeah, i know i spelt that wrong

i don't care.

try not checking your mail for a week

you get a nasty note from the postmaster

telling you

you have to come down to get your mail

and furthermore,

they won't give you new mail until you get your old mail.

and they'll start returning to sender until you come down.

so all my mail is in a building farther from my house

than school is.

(and school is in helotes.)

the boonies.

and sometimes i wonder

is there anything

really 

worth getting in the mail?

(cthulhu was ups, not usps, wonder if there was a lawsuit about that.)

the brown ups truck

that used to give my dog seizures when it drove past

(not sure if it's the same truck, with a problem that caused doggie seizures,

(or just a problem with ford econoline trucks that deliver brown packages

(brown packages, delivering brown packages.

(and they won't deliver to po boxes.)

so i'm mailless, sleepless,

and apparently without the will to hit the update journal button..."

"event","halloween is about two weeks away, and the yards here are really well decorated.    perhaps a bit too soon, considering the ultra-conservative neighborhood.

some people actually understand the significance of a harvest celebration, so you get the wonderful jack o'lanterns, harvest wreaths, purple and orange christmas lights, and pippi-longstocking-scarecrows-in-lederhosen.

some people use motion sensors.

as a person who walks for excercise at 5 in the morning, let me assure you that halloween decorations, while obviously fake, are still, at times, scary (as their intent)

but motion sensors, come on, man!

first one was just up my block, a seven-foot-tall, fully articulated scythe-wielding draped-in-black, angel of death.  I was shocked for a minute when i first saw it (about a house away), but you can imagine my surprise when while walking past, the scythe actually came down.  well, let me assure you, that's not the best thing to see, walking around at five in the morning.

shudder

next instance was a few streets down, walking past some bushes, when suddenly, someone played the <EM>Snarling Growling Rottweilers</EM> smash single, ""GROWL, SNARL, BARK BARK BARK"", and it wasn't even the remix version.  having snarling barking dog sounds from just the other side of a bush, in a neighborhood where dogs (large dogs) tend to roam freely, as if their dog owners were NRA ^H ^H DA members, well, let's just say more check-your-underwear fun times.

finally, walking back up my street (but not the side that has mr. grim reaper)  a house has trees with police/coroner's tape around what appears to be their dirty laundry stuffed with newspapers.

until that pile of dirty laundry sits up.

well, they say exercise is good for the heart.

i'll be sure to pick up my heart on my way to work.  i'm sure it's in the street somewhere..."

"event","can someone explain this for me?

wife doesn't want to go to the football game, and to alleviate tension, i say well, let's not go to the game.

to which she says, well, what would you like to do.

i keep saying let's go home, (what she wanted to do in the first place, mind you) but she keeps asking what would you like to do.

finally after about fifteen minutes of pestering me about this, i say i'd like to go to the football game

so she turns the truck around (me + one hand + driving = bad stomach for wifeypoo)

off to the game, and the silent treatment begins.  it ends at about 8 minutes into the first quarter, when she asks me, why can't i make up my mind?

apparently my ""waffling"" about wanting to go to the game had frustrated her, made her mad.

of course the only reason we were at the game is because her pestering me about it for about fifteen minutes.

i try to remind her of this.

more silent treatment.

this time, into ten minutes left in the half, she says ""start all over?""  so we do.

she sends me for nachos.

btw. farris stadium sucks (or is it the marshall band boosters, taking a good thirty minutes to service the people in front of me so i could get my nachos.

insert closed parenthesis here.  -ten points. )

and what's up with this ""nachos only"" line?  i can't get a soda without missing the rest of the game waiting in the adjacent line?

of course, teacher's can't make a scene, so i'm in the other line.

come back up, two (soggy) nachos, two diet cokes, and thirty seconds left in the half.

o'connor won btw.  38-21.  defense wins championships.  

bastards would never come to a math meet."

fridays are supposed to be the easiest day of the week, casual fridays, meaningless, boring fridays.  nothing gets done on fridays.  of course, these are the most hectic days of all for me.  just running about, finding the lab open, finding people playing games on the computers, waiting to get in trouble.  it's like no one remembers the trouble i got into last year.

what's up with that?

guess i must not be the popular teacher i thought i was.

getting better at driving a truck one-handed though.  as long as i don't get into any accidents no one will care.

"event","this morning i was at chuck e. cheese.
and i kept finding quarters all over the ground, under machines. 
and there was a machine where you could press a button and quarters would come out.
and even though it was stealing and i felt bad for it i kept doing it because i wanted them so bad.
so i played that thing where you get stuffed animals out of the machine with the claw that never works.
and i got a mickey mouse doll that was blue and not like mickey mouse at all.
and then i played this other game and won cotton candy.
grapefruit flavored cotton candy.
i asked the lady if i could have a different flavor. 
she didn't let me. she wasn't very good at her job.
and i thought it was gonna be gross, but it was really good.
and then i woke up.
and i thought about the day, and i thought about the dream and then i had the best feeling i've had in the last 24 hours.
it was so strange."

it's just that i've grown to be <i>so</i> insecure, that i can't really be myself anymore. and that kills me. 

oh well. 

i'll grow out of it i'm sure.

i cried for awhile tonight because someone said something mean to me in jest, but still it's something i'm very insecure about. so it really got to me. it was like taking the two knives that bother me the most, and stabbing them straight into the chest. ha. oh well.

well i've really learned to calm the heck down, and stop worrying about everything so much. to trust God more. to love more. that it's not about works, it's about Jesus. those are just a few. I also learned that being humble is where God wants me. i didn't just hear it this time, i finallyfinallyfinally learned it. i learned to keep my mouth shut more when i want to say something that would not be good. the list goes on. i'm continually learning because that's how screwed up i am. heh.

most listened to cds of the year?
probably norah jones-come away with me
fiona apple-tidal
i listened to other cd's alot, but i listened to those two cds more than anyone should ever listen to one cd. 

favorite pieces of clothing that you wore alot?
the jeans that i bought from wal-mart. they were on sale for five dollars. so i bought four pairs of the samexact pair.
the thrift store suit pants.
all my black t-s.
button down shirts.

worst thing that happened?
umm...hmmm.....probably when sarah got her fingers smashed in the garage door/when the lightning hit the house. those were some scary times.

random fond memories?
going to dbc with jennifer all the time in the summer after she spent the night on saturdays and we watched movies on the foldout couch.
getting to know all the infirmians better.
joining this new church
hehe emailing with matt lucas back in the day.
nights spent at jessie and mike's house.
breaking away from the steve thing. what a relief. <3 to him still though. man we liked eachother so much. it wasn't the right thing though. it's good we never went out.
dancing with sarah/laura/marina.
my sixteenth party night and taking sarah murray home the next day.
learning things. oh how i love learning. seriously. spiritual things.
going to dbc with shelly.
when spazaustin spent the night at our heezee and me and him stayed up talking. wait was that this year?
the sweatsuit party.
the pedro show with the josh's (whom i love like whoa) and shelly (whom i also love like whoa).
times with becca+mark+just everyone else i've hung out with. 
seeing eight mile, yes. hehe.
shmunks for you
so many more. must stop now.

things i'm looking forward to this year: 
****if God wills it all of course****
driving
probably getting my first job
turning seventeen, although all i want in life is to stay sixteen.
hopefully getting a significant other. hehe.
seeing where the church goes.
getting to know some church people better.
maturing.in.Jesus

"event","alright so yes.
this morning i awoke at 7:40 after going to sleep at like 1:45 lastnight.
i got up at 8 something. 
threw on some clothes, and some hair spray. and did a couple things. 
then i went to church.
and i saw little jonah. 
annnd i sang. we played. and lots of people commented on my voice. and people really liked us. and this guy that plays in malls asked us if we wanted to go around with him and play at malls. hehe.
i had to fight my flesh alot while i was up there. so i did it for Jesus. because if it weren't for Him, i wouldn't have even been up there. it's totally for Jesus.
theeeeeeen the pastor's daughter (breanna, 11) wanted us to come to her house and play with her, so we did. and her little brother (joe joe, 8). oh they're SOOOO cute. i love them. we made a tent with sheets in their living room and went in it and made a ""club"" of which you can't be in the tent unless you had the official ""club card"" hehehehe. 
and i ate sushi (joy had some) with salmon in it. it made me wanna puke. ewww i hate fish. i'm an idiot for trying it. yuck.
and breanna pretended like we were at a resteraunt and she was the waitress/cook and made up a menu of the food they had and asked what we wanted. it was cute. and she put classical music on in the background and made me chili (from a can) and made sarah breaded chicken (leftovers). and told me to pretend like the chili was italian food and asked me how the italian food was. hehehehe. cute.
anyway, we left there and as we went outside we saw paul and chad (drane) nextdoor. man it was weird. i looked over at them and noticed their shoes from far away and thought ""oh they have the reeboks"" and then we almost left without noticing, but paul saw us and all of us were like squinting to make sure that we had the right people and he's like ""is it the sisters??"" hahahaha. so we talked for a minute then left to go to wal-mart to pick something up and see daniel.  well joy locked her keys in the car so daniel got them out without a problem (because he's that cool) and then we came home. i napped. did the dishes, and i have to go clean up the puppy's room in a minute. 
seeing chad and paul made me wanna call up becky and cindy.
yup. 
anyway, that was my day in a nutshell.
who else made tents when they were little? i know i did. it was the best thing, ever.
love.
lydia
ps
my friends trailor partly burned down today. everything in the room burned up except for the unharmed bible. wow right? God's so good. I'm so encouraged/refreshed.
oh pss!
today i love that family more than ever! the mother and me get along like whooooa, and the dad is cool and the girl is cool and the boys are so cool.

"event","i had an awfully weird dream this morning.
i was at this big concert for the scene here, but there were all kinds of different rooms, and it was more like an auditorium. 
i had the puppy in her box with me. mikey exinfirmity was there. he put his arm around me like a side hug to hug me and i did the same to him and we stayed that way until we got to this room where all our infirmity friends were, and the evelynn kids too, and other people. it was a play. like one where people just saw their lines and said them. they didn't hear them before. they just did it. sarah keane was there and she did a line and i looked down at her and me and her were like ""what???"" because it didn't really make sense, and she did it wrong. and then they said I had a line, and i was like where are the lines???? and they said it was on a monitor in a room that i could see, and i couldn't find them, so i got up and went into a little room where they were supposed to be, and i kept looking and everyone was waiting for me to say my line.

I'm looking for baby names. not that i'm expecting or anything, just to know, ya know. when i get married, of course. although the moms i work with in the nursery asked if i had any kids. hahahaha. well she didn't know how old i was yet.

and i know it seems like i'm always falling down.
but it does not matter to me, although it seems like it should.
it's because i know i'm understood when i hear Him say.. 
""rest in Me little david, and dry all your tears, you can lay down your armor and have no fear, cuz i'm always here when you're tired of running, and I'm all the strength that you need""
it's uphill both ways, tomorrow i swear i won't act this way.
and i know, it seems like that is what i always say.

i know i want to be like Jesus, but it seems so very far away.
when will i learn to obey.

"event","ok. well here are some interesting (and true) stories. they're all true. i promise.

ok, so yesterday me and my momma went out together. we went to the thrift shop. well on the way home we're just going along our merry way and the road came to a dead end. we couldn't figure out why (it's the way we usually go home). so do we turn around and go another way? no, i just jump out of the car, remove the orange cones that are blocking our way and after she goes through put them back in place and then run in the car and we are on our way. haha. i thought that was great.

so today's stories are much more interesting..

i'm in wal-mart with my dad and my sister. i figured that today i wouldn't do anything with my hair, because i'm just going to wal-mart and a pawn shop. well we're in the mens section of wal-mart looking for some pants for sarah, and this guy comes up to the rack we're at. i could tell he was wantin' to get fresh with me, and so i was kinda weirded out. well like right away he starts talking to us. so he asks us how far away grapevine is, and my dad was talking to him about so the guy starts to say how he's trying to get used to texas. he just moved here, and his band is playing a show soon. he says he's in slipknot. his name is ""corey"". he's the lead singer. he talks foreeeeeeeeeeever and tells us all kinds of stories about when they played places, and why he doesn't have long hair anymore, and what his mask is made of that he plays with, and his new house is the big a** house across from cha cha's. and he just keeps telling us so much stuff. so i was veryyy skeptical of him the whole time. he said he's about to play a show with Korn and some other bands (i can't remember who) and he said he could probably give echocast the hookups to get big, and he said that he could get us backstage passes and tickets to the show they're about to play with Korn, and we could ""party with them and see how they're all really like"". and then he gave us his number 817-975-63**. it was weird. he asked us our ages and blah blah blah and he said he's not a teenager (which i could easily gather, he looks in his late twenties or mid twenties). so yeah, dad and sarah are lookin' at some pants and he goes ""is that your dad"" and i said yeah, and he said ""you know you're really cute...you're gorgeous, i gotta give you a hug."" so he gives me a side hug, WHICH i don't understand, because if he's such a creep then if i were him i'd give me a REAL hug, because if he's creepy he's gonna want boob action, and what's so great about a side hug? so he must be a PSYCHO. BECAUSE, like about three months ago he went into joy's work and he told us all the same stuff he told her. and he hit on joy too, and he told us today that he thought joy was flirting with him, so he was surprised that she had a boyfriend. so yeah, we finnnnnally stopped talking to him. so we get home and sarah calls joy at work to tell her about it (because he remembered joy) and joy said that he went into her work today, but not when she was there (her boss told her that he did). so that kind of creeps me out. i mean, he went into her work and then just HAPPENS to walk up to us in wal-mart the same day (probably the same hour). and he had no idea who we were. if he's a stalker, i wonder how he knew what me, sarah and dad looked like. so i've come to two conclusions..
either
(a)he IS a crazy stalker and he's trying to get in good with the family. or
(b) hotness runs in our family. hahaha.

so yes, it was very freakin' strange. pray for joy and mine and sarah's safety.

so yes...more weirdness..

me dad and sarah go get in the car and we get to a stoplight and we're just sitting there waiting for the light to turn red, and dad said ""that car just got in a wreck!"" and he points behind us, and i looked back and this really nice red car had rolled over once and landed on it's side and i saw it going back and forth, and i saw the smoke. and i got scared and then i saw a guy go help him and call the police and stuff, but the weird thing was that the car almost hit us, but it didn't. God's really watching over us. that makes me so happy. then on our way home we saw the ambulance and fire truck that was going to the accident.

yeah, it's all so weird..

weird day. 

very very weird day.

uhm, well yeah and i carried a huuuge tv upstairs all by myself. i'm such a haus. hahahah.

love(<3)

hahahahaha. i just called joy and i was talking to her about it and telling her to be careful, and she said that he came into her work and since she wasn't there he started hitting on her coworker, danielle. hahaha. he just wants to have sex."

""Silence They won't see The fire you have lit inside of me They look up to the stars And wonder where you might be They look up without realizing That they're standing right there in the palm of your hand I can't explain or understand I just love You It's common knowledge That you've been dead for a while It's well known that the cross is only a burden With pains and trials But then again how come my shoes are so light How come I can walk for miles And still just love You So I think I'll stay Caught up in a silent prayer I believe in silence Our hearts speak the same word So why don't we just walk along The shoreline with a silent song Cause I believe in Silence Our hearts speak the same word We have to prove That our love is real over and over again But let them think what they want I know it will never end Because I know where it began And my heart still heart still pounds twice as fast Whenever you walk by Cause I still love you So I think I'll stay...""

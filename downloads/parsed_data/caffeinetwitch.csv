I personally recommend giving money to Portland-based <a href=""http://www.mercycorps.org/home/"">Mercy Corps</a>, partly because they're non-religious, partly because they're one of the few outfits that's been helping Iraqi civilians for at least over a year (at least one of the few I heard about), partly because they're local, but mostly because they keep sending me mail requesting money and I want to help <a href=""http://www.affoundation.org/"">save the forests.</a> Give and maybe you'll help me keep a tree alive.

"event","I want to thank <lj user=""autumnfalling""> and his friends (soon to be my friends as well once the serum takes hold) for coming with me to <a href=""http://www.mercyground.com/"">Faith and the Muse.</a> It was a fairly strange evening overall, and they weathered the weirdness with aplomb.

<lj-cut text=""More concert musings here."">
After a dinner at Fujin's which prepares the Best. Chinese Food. Evar., we went to the venue, <a href=""http://sabalasmttabor.com/sabalas-main.htm"">Sabala's... or Mt. Tabor Theater... or...</a> well, it's hard to know what to call the place. I was amused to note that Sabawhatsit now hosts Klingon Karaoke, the primary draw of the now-defunct Bodacious Classics, my previous home-away-from-home. I don't know the history of the building, but I'm guessing it used to be a small movie theater. The main room was a great space: high ceilings, raised stage, and good visibility from pretty much anywhere in the room. The venue's very punk/rockabilly in atmosphere, so much so that it felt somewhat faked. (I wonder who you hire to give your floor that right amount of stickiness.) Still, whenever you exited the bar area the painting of Johnny Cash was <a href=""http://www.ooze.com/finger/assets/images/jcash.jpg"">ready to greet you</a>, a very welcoming touch. And the bathroom didn't smell terrible despite the ambience of decay and bad aim.

Too bad the staff wasn't faked. The bartender was pleasant but very, very slow. A couple of other employees were bussing tables, futzing with screens, and apparently resenting the patrons. I'm not sure if the Sabawhatever staff's to blame for the sound issues, but... well, I'll get to that in a moment.

I don't know exactly what time things happened; they happened <b>very</b> late, that's all I know. ""Synchronicity Frequency"", the billed opening act, took the stage and had a sound check... then left. Then Damon, the keyboardist from <a href=""http://www.writteninashes.com/"">Written in Ashes</a>, went up and did a second sound check; this baffled me until the unbilled opening opening act, Written in Ashes, took the stage Written's a local band that I've seen before and happen to like; they're not breaking any new ground but they give solid, danceable darkity music. They played a short set, left, and passed the torch to ""Synchro..""  oh, Hell, I don't want to type all that again. A guy with a Trent Reznor jones. He 00ntzed and sang his distorted songs and did not answer the overriding question: what the FUCK is taking so long?

When Faith and the Muse finally took the stage (half-past-midnight? Not sure), After wrangling with the sound guy, William Faith and his Really Big Hair mentioned that a flat tire caused the delay. My crap detector went off, especially since Monica Richards was around long before Written performed. In any case, the mood was sour when the lights went down... and the first murky song started. The sound was bad, very bad, and didn't get fixed until the third or fourth song.

Much as I'd like to keep pointing fingers, I have to say that I was disappointed with FatM's performance. Sound issues aside, they chose to stick with a rock and roll groove that felt like Siouxsie in the mid-80's. Now, they weren't <b>bad</b> at it, but their world/Celtic/Folk sound is a draw for me; there were brief forays here and there but they were far too fleeting for my tastes. After the long, long wait I didn't want to hear music that stayed in safe territory. 

Once 1:30am hit I was done. I was tired, zoning, and finding very little reason to remain at the show. I felt terrible about leaving <lj user=""autumnfalling""> by himself (you better have made it home OK), but he wanted to stick around and I didn't want to nod off at the wheel. Dammit, I feel old."

"event","Regarding <a href=""http://www.uc.edu/gothicparis/bios/simon.html"">Simon De Montfort</a>, military leader for the Albigenisan Crusade in the Languedoc region of France, an anonymous chronicler wrote as a ""eulogy"":

<CITE>Those who can read may learn from his epitaph that he is a saint and martyr; that he is bound to rise again to share the heritage, to flourish in the state of unparalleled felicity, to wear a crown and have his place in the Kingdom. But for my part I have heard tell that the matter must stand thus: if one may seek Christ Jesus in the world by killing men and shedding blood; by the destruction of human souls; by compounding murder and hearkening to preserve counsel; by setting the torch to great fires [...]  by winning lands through violence, and working for the triumph of vain pride; by fostering evil and snuffing out good; by slaughtering women and slitting children's throats -- why yes, then he must needs wear a crown and shine resplendent in heaven.</CITE>

I don't know how apocryphal the story is, but apparently this exchange occured during the assault (massacre, if you like) at Beziers: 

""'How will we know who to kill?' a knight was later said to have asked... The cynical reply was 'Slay them all -- God will recognize His own.'""

I'm also hunting for the song ""It's Up To You"" by Steinski and Mass Media. (DJ Steinski, perhaps -- I'm not positive). I found it on vinyl for about $300; both conditions bugged me. I'm happy to pay, but not $50 a minute, and I don't have a turntable.

<a href=""http://www.swarthmore.edu/SocSci/tburke1/"">His journal is here,</a> and

<a href=""http://www.swarthmore.edu/SocSci/tburke1/Road%20to%20Victory.pdf""> 'The Road to Victory', an essay in PDF format, is here.</a>

I'm not in complete agreement with his possible solutions, perhaps because I disagree on his assessment of how strong the federal government really is. I agree that there's a perception of ""strong regimes of governmental regulation of business,"" for instance, but my somewhat glib response is that, in some cases, the regulations aren't strong enough. I believe that this country's government is obligated to frequently protect the minority from the will of the majority -- one of the reasons I support the Electoral College. Concessions are always painful, but I feel that the line between my desired USA and the USA that prevailed on Tuesday is too blurry already. Progressives/liberals/pinko commies/whatever-we-are need to understand the fears, hopes, and desires of the other side and address them, certainly, but I'd rather find a way to present the merits of liberal points to the other point-of-view in a convincing fashion rather than weaken our own convictions.

Anyhow, I hope you find his work a good read."

"event","Hi! Some of you may remember me. You probably saw a few of my posts here, or perhaps RPed with me online once upon a time. I believe it's safe to say I've returned to virtual reality after a long immersion period in reality that doesn't involve URL addresses...

I would recap my entire week, except that such a recap would be 1) boring and 2) probably full of lies, since my crappy memory is liable to fill in the gaps with things that are far more entertaining than actually occured. I'd <i>like</i> to think my new band ""Unhappy Teriyaki"" got signed before we even put out our first demo CD, but I suspect that's a creation of my underslept imagination since, last I checked, I can muddle through ""Peter Gunn"" on the bass only if I keep my eyes on my fret hand. I think my past does include a Pride Parade, grooming a bunch of cats, a fantastic Moroccan dinner, some hours of web site design, visiting various people, and a show that was the culmination of an all-girl rock-and-roll camp (a show that showed exactly how false the ""Unhappy Teryaki"" memory is). 

Oh, yes, I got the Eddie Izzard tickets. Hoo-rah!"

"event","...show the gun."" An old adage attributed to Alfred Hitchcock. Someone should have reminded the writer of <I>Identity</I> of the master's words.

<lj-cut text=""Review of Identity is just a click away!"">
All right, not a full review. This had the potential to be an excellent movie, up there with with <I>The Others</I> and <I>Memento</I> as one of those Mysteries With a Twist Ending. I'm a fan of those when they're done well. 

The plot, in brief: A freak rainstorm in Nevada strands several people in a run-down hotel, each individual bringing the other, directly or indirectly, to their accomidations. There's a Hooker With a Dream who packed up and left Vegas, a Satre-reading limo driver and his failing actress ward, a mom-dad-son trio, a young couple who Got Married Far Too Soon, a scatterbrained cop and his prisoner, and the skeezy hotel manager. After a decent amount of buildup the characters start getting murdered -- or simply dying in some cases -- and the survivors start trying to riddle out whodunit. Room keys found by the bodies indicate that some sort of countdown's taking place a la ""Ten Little Indians"" (or ""And Then There Were None"", if you prefer). Almost every character has a secret that changes our perspective about who they really are. Some of the secrets are minor and some are quite important. Just as things are coming to a head, the script reveals A Twist. 

Unfortunately, the writer of <I>Identity</I> decided that one twist wasn't good enough and reached for two. I won't tell you what the twists were; if you really want to know, contact me privately. The first twist was fine, in my opinion. Some people might find it a stretch, but I felt it worked. It actually justified the movie to me. I'm not particularly good at seeing ""whodunit"" or ""oh lord, it's Keyser Soze"" or anything like that. I saw this ""whodunit"" here a mile away, though, and so the first twist kept me engaged rather than easing back in my seat and looking smug. Then the second one came along, and try as I might I couldn't find the twist justified given the past hour and a half of movie viewing. I had /no/ clue this was coming. It was as if Dame Christie had popped a werewolf into the last ten pages of an Hercule Poirot novel. OK, that actually might be kind of cool, but you see my point.

My advice is to see this movie. Once you get to a scene where you see a truck driving through an orange grove, turn off the DVD or get up and leave the theater. You will have seen all that /should/ have been in this movie."

"event","Thursday evening was not a good omen for the rest of the weekend. <lj user=""badseedshalo""> and I were going to go to <A HREF=""http://www.theprids.com/index2.html"">The Prids'</A> CD release party (they're semi-friends of badseed), but we were both feeling achy and tired for no explainable reason. Fortunately, the presumed cold/flu/alien birthing never transpired, so everything's been good since then. :)

<lj-cut text=""Vacuum sealed for your protection."">
Friday was, on the surface, a fairly placid day. Unbeknownst to Angelique, I was trying to make secret arrangements at Bodacious Classics for her birthday dinner and for the Saturday party. The former included angel-themed songs and flowers, the latter included a female dwarf stripper in clownface. We (the friend who thought of this and I) weren't able to arrange for the stripper, which is, in retrospect, the reason that I'm able to type these words this evening.

The dinner went quite well; the staff of BC's were gracious and attentive and had decorated our table with balloons and folded-napkin roses. From there we went to the <A HREF=""http://www.voltaire.net/"">Voltaire</A> show at <A HREF=""http://www.wyth.net/"">Studio 111</a>, thanks to the ticket-procurement powers of <lj user=""blackchurch"">. I wasn't real thrilled with the venue; it's a photography studio and has a nice, big space in the basement, but the acommodations were pretty meager. More chairs and less concrete would have been nice. The show didn't start for what seemed like a very long time, which was also irksome, but we managed to chat away the weeks. (As we were leaving BC's someone -- I think it was <lj user=""nubbytwiglet"">, and even if it wasn't I'll blame her because I just met her that evening and she's otherwise <b>extremely</b> nice -- thought it'd be cute for us to each have a balloon to take to the concert. It <b>was</b> cute for about, oh, thirty seconds, then I just felt like a moron.)

Opening for Voltaire were The Xploding Boys, a Cure cover band. The first few songs had several sound board problems, but soon the issues were fixed and people swayed along to ""Love Song"" and ""Just Like Heaven"". <lj user=""badseedshalo""> and I are split on whether the lead singer was really trying to channel Robert Smith or was just parodying him. He <b>did</b> sound a lot like him in either case.

Then Voltaire took the stage. He has this presence about him as if he's waiting for someone to figure out he doesn't actually belong up there and he's just going to milk the moment for all it's worth. No band, just him, his guitar, and a lot of humor. My personal highlights were his (possibly impromptu?) song about German industrial bands (leading to the title of this entry), ruminations on career opportunities for ravers (hint: he thought of this while his plane was taxiing towards the airport gate, and glowsticks play a part), a Star Trek song (""USS Make Sh*t Up""), and a cover of ""Science Fiction/Double Feature"". Oh, and ""The Vampire Club"" had me giggling like a leetle gurl. LARP memories...

Saturday was quite mellow up until the evening of the party. Not much to report, really. Well, all right, there were the leg-humping-as-handshake incidents, a successful supply of margaritas (mantra of the evening: ""The margaritas were great! I had two, and then I {insert embarrassing incident here}""), and of course the formal announcement of our engagement. I think one person was actually surprised. 

Today has been mostly dedicated to recovering, getting caught up on MUSH events, and a bit of shopping. <lj user=""badseedshalo""> passed me a link to a Flash version of <a href=""http://www.langleycreations.com/pitfall/"">Pitfall!</a> and, once again, I giggle... then fall quiet as I contemplate how old I am.

Time to go eat and perhaps kill the dogs in the car next door -- or reverse the order of actions and save a trip. They're probably very nice dogs, but they bark at passers-by, which sets our dogs off, which causes the car-dogs to keep barking, all leading to an endless canine feedback loop where eardrums rupture. Aie."

"event","So, you're driving around Portland, squinting through the ubiquitious rain, looking for a place to grab a sandwich and perhaps a beer. Or three. You get to 26th and Powell, and see a Burgerville. No, you fool, look behind you. Yes, the other place there. It's named ""Bodacious Classics"" and, dammit, it looks like a strip club, but (and?) you decide that's the place to stop. You get out of your car and head towards the (basement) door, expecting to see naked women (men?) gyrating for your pleasure. Sorry, bucko. You will get, however, depending on the night you wander in: Klingon Kareoke, singing stormtroopers (of the ""these aren't the droids we're looking for"" kind -- I demurred to join the group as a little Wookie, although I may give them an Endor warble sometime), or Starfleet Admiral Ralph spinning the best of Bobby Darin. 

Run, do not walk, to this place. They desperately need your money, for one thing, but for others they have a Naboo fighter dangling from the ceiling, various Star Trek collectibles (a signed Nimoy picture! I swoon!), and various Strieberesque Greys lurking in the corners. They have good food, strong drinks, and the staff is happy to tell you about their theories regarding the Nazca lines and the alien sightings that surrounded the birth of their children."

"event","I make no promises for coherency. I just wanted to post for those who feared that I was slain and buried beneath our dirt crawlspace (romantic as such a notion may be).

Over the past couple of days I've experienced more cat-love than I thought possible. We went to the <A HREF=""http://kittydream.org/"">House of Dreams</A> in order to find a playmate for Jinx. He is obviously lonely and needing a friend, and the House of Dreams have several felines in dire need of a loving home. (Well, all right, not exactly dire... they treat their wards with much love, but seek to find good homes for them.) We also visited another girl currently in foster care, and right now I think she's probably the one best suited to our bizzare situation. I feel that <b>I</b> was adopted by <A HREF=""http://kittydream.org/cat_html/magic_01.html"">Magic</A>, however, who kept following me around and insisting that I carry him whenever feasible. 

I've been neglecting my MUSHly duties recently because I couldn't really dredge up the mood to play, and also because we've been running around like lunatics. I've gotten a lot done in the past several days in the ""organizing"" department, but I'm looking forward to tomorrow, when I should have a long stretch of time to dedicate to my various online incarnations.

<lj user=""badseedshalo""> and I had an excellent dinner with <lj user=""illusionaltzu"">. Extremely good Indian food and conversation flowed freely while small dogs ran amok -- with a great deal of encouragement from me. We left the evening a bit earlier than desired to go meet a friend for a previously scheduled appointment at a club; unfortunately the friend cancelled, although we had a fine time nonetheless. Still, I hope for another, longer dinner engagement with <lj user=""illusionaltzu"">, preferably one where I'm not called upon to cook. Unless everyone likes microwave pizza, of course. 

I'm going to try and shed these boots and head to bed. Goodnight, everyone!"

"event","Today started with a trip to the vet; Sydney's been limping for a few days now despite not showing any signs of pain; squeezing and moving his legs around produced quizzical looks and little else. As is typical whenever my children have problems, the vet couldn't figure out what was going on either, and one pain medication perscription later we were on our way. The rest of the day was spent doing household things, and then <lj user=""badseedshalo""> and I went to see <A HREF=""http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/SpiritedAway-1116064/"">Spirited Away</A>. As we walked towards the theater we grew uneasy when we noticed that Spirited Away wasn't listed on the marquee. We wandered inside anyhow, and it turned out we were a day early for the anime feature. Since we didn't have any good alternatives (besides the concert next door, which we weren't dressed for judging by the people queued up) we decided to see <A HREF=""http://www.bowlingforcolumbine.com/"">Bowling for Columbine</A> instead. (For reviews, check out the ones on <A HREF=""http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/BowlingforColumbine-1117183/reviews.php"">Rotten Tomatoes.</A>)

<lj-cut text=""Wow."">
Michael Moore poses the question, ""What is it about Amercians that makes us shoot each other?"" Unsurprisingly, Moore doesn't come up with any pat sound-bite answer, although Marilyn Manson, interviewed because several people decided to blame the Columbine murders on his music, provided a pretty good response: ""a campaign of fear and consumption."" This leads to the question, ""So, why are Americans so afraid?"" Moore does a fantastic job mulling over this question, dwelling on the climate of fear fostered by the media, government, racism, and poverty.

Moore's statistical argument is a bit spotty in places: for example, he makes a big point comparing the number of gun deaths in different countries, but doesn't provide a per-capita ratio. (Still, it's pretty safe to assume that the ratios are disproportinate.) He discusses racism a lot, but doesn't touch on the violence within the urban African-American community and doesn't discuss the ties between poverty and race. These are pretty minor oversights in the context of the film, however. 

Given the backdrop of the current assault on Iraq Moore's juxtaposition of the bombing in Kosovo with the shootings at Columbine are particularly moving. Given my current apoplexy about the American government pretending to talk to us without actually saying <A HREF=""#footnote"">anything</A><sup>*</sup>, the interview with Charlton Heston at the end was maddening to me. 

Moore occasionally veers from his own argument. For example, he compares the availability of guns in the USA to Canada and determines that they're perhaps even more prevalent in Canada. Then he takes a couple of the shooting victims from Columbine to K-Mart headquarters to protest how easy it was for the shooters to purchase ammuntion from the Littleton K-Mart (as he speaks to some PR person he points at a scar on the torso of one young man, noting that inside the boy rests a 7-cent K-Mart bullet). It didn't seem contradictory to me, though: first, it really underscored the complexity of the problem, and second, I really had to wonder about how vital it was to our 2nd Amendment freedoms that a person can go to K-Mart and purchase several hundreds of rounds of ammunition without even showing ID. 

The movie grabbed me by the brain and shook vigorously. I strongly recommend it.
<HR>
<A NAME=""footnote"">* I was listening to a press briefing given by Ari Fleisher about a week ago. A reporter asked which other countries had provided troops for the coalition assault on Iraq. This seems like a very simple question, but Mr. Fleisher went on at length about how many different ways countries can provide aid to a military force... and never answered the question. I'm used to such evasiveness (although I'm growing increasingly angry at how blatant it is), but what appalled me was that <b>no one</b> called him to task for it. I'm surprised anyone bothers to show to these briefings."

"event","<lj user=""badseedshalo""> and I went to see Dreamcatcher last night. I'm glad it was a free sneak preview... 

<lj-cut text=""Prattlings about the movie here -- no spoilers."">
I have no idea if it was a decent movie or not, because I was so irritated by the deviations from the book that I couldn't just enjoy the movie as presented. I know that you <b>have</b> to make changes for the purposes of exposition (third-person omniscent doesn't fly real well in the film medium) as well as length, but some of the alterations/ommisions seemed completely arbitrary. I suspect that the writers had a few drafts that were pretty close to the book before realizing that the movie'd have to be another hour long for anything to make sense. It's possible they even began filming with this script; the latter half of the movie had strange plot-jumps, indicating to me that some scenes remained on the cutting-room floor. Rather than do some clever edits and dialogue insertions, however, they decided to veer off in a direction that'd fit more readily into the alloted time.

In unrelated news, I just found Malcolm's meds online for $28 dollars for 100 tablets. I've been paying $100 through a different online pharmacy up until now; at a regular drugstore they cost $200. I think that's about one-<b>seventh</b> of the cost. Now, this is a drug that's perscribed for both humans and pets (Selegiline), and the $28 price came from a pet-specific site <A HREF=""http://www.petcarerx.com"">(PetCareRX.com)</A> -- but it's the exact same drug. Folks, I urge you to shop online for your meds whenever you can, and pretend that you're a canine if it'll help."

Portland, Oregon grew from a collection of townships that were unrelated except by their proximity to each other. While the city purports to have numbered avenues running north to south (the numbers increasing as one moves eastward) and named streets running east to west (named after no apparent convention), the reality is far more sinister. The attempt to connect the disparate towns into a cohesive whole was mediocre (at best). Therefore, when a PC attempts to drive around Portland, roll 1d20 per 3"" of travel:

"event","<lj user=""badseedshalo""> and I went to New Orleans last week to visit her family and to enjoy Mardi Gras. It was one of the best and one of the worst vacations I've been on in a long time. I'll try and present a balanced report, but since this is me I'm apt to really emphasize the negative. (Somewhat related aside: I'm disappointed to see that curmudgeon.com is taken -- I may see about getting curmudgeon.net.)
<lj-cut text=""Tales from the Big Uneasy"">
We flew out of Portland on Friday, February 28th. We went with America West, which is good for cheap fares, small people, and those who don't eat. The first leg of the trip was mostly uneventful (except for a portion that <lj user=""badseedshalo""> already covered, so I won't go into that), although I will mention the speedbumps on the New Orleans runway are a nice safety feature. We arrived late at our hotel, somewhere around 11:30pm, and after a quick jaunt to Denny's we promptly passed out. 

<lj user=""badseedshalo"">'s parents picked us up the next morning and we went straight to the parades. Now, I've never been to New Orleans and I've never really paid much attention to Mardi Gras, so I had no idea what to expect. In case you're like me, let me explain a few things:
<UL>
<LI>There are parades for several days before Fat Tuesday. I think they're all considered 'fat' down there, so there's Lundi Gras, Samedi Gras, and so forth.
<LI>There are lots of different parades going on all over the place, and only a handful actually go into the French Quarter.
<LI>Most tourists wind up crammed in the French Quarter while the locals stay on the periphery. The tourists tend to drink a lot while the locals tend to eat a lot.
</UL>
We watched the Iris and Tucks krewes and I became a bead junkie, hopping around and waving for a throw to come my way. I expect I looked like I had a live carp stuffed inside my boxers. I should mention here that I generally don't like crowds. Over the years I've moved from a low-grade demophobia to occasional anxiety to mere discomfort. Also, I'm cynical about most throngs gathered together to agressively have a good time; people (including myself) tend to focus on the annoyances of dealing with other people. I was therefore surprised at how enjoyable the whole thing was. People were, on the whole, cheerful, polite, and intent on just having fun. I wound up with sore fingertips from ill-caught beads but I was happy nonetheless. Then over the hills and through the woods to grandmother's house we went, stopping just long enough to get some takeout daquiris and for me to lose my debit VISA card -- my sole source of money on the trip, barring checks. Out-of-state checks. Out of state checks have more value as toilet paper than as promisory notes. Fortunately <lj user=""badseedshalo""> had just received her tax return, so our money issues were minor. That's what we thought, anyhow...

The next few days were spent socializing with family, watching parades, and getting bruised by beads. Monday evening was extremely rainy and chilly and a couple of krewes cancelled or postponed; only the desperate or deranged would willingly submit to the weather just to see a bunch of floats. Obviously, we shivered our way out to see the Proteus and Orpheus krewes. Orpheus has Harry Connick Jr. as it's mascot/patron/figurehead, and I got to watch him roll by... talking all the while into his cellphone. (Several people in the crowd catcalled, ""Can you hear me now, Harry? Good!"") I found the Proteus floats far more interesting. Their theme this year was ""Mythical Creatures,"" and I enjoyed the displays of werewolves and mermaids. They even had a Mithras float, and while I never really thought of Mithras as a 'creature' per se I took several pictures of the display mostly for <lj user=""amberspyglass"">'s amusement. The next day was Mardi Gras, but we were so exhausted that we didn't stay through the day's parades. 

After a day and a half of rest <lj user=""badseedshalo""> and I left Grandmother's for the French Quarter. We stayed at the Queen and Cresent, which is a nice place unless you need the staff's assistance for anything. On the whole they tend to be cooly polite, but -- well, I'm jumping ahead of myself.

Riding on my checks and <lj user=""badseedshalo"">'s bank account, we ate, drank, and shopped our way around Thursday evening, went to bed, then tried to do it again on Friday. That's when we found out we couldn't get to <lj user=""badseedshalo"">'s money anymore. Several automatic withdrawls had tapped the funds. After an hour or so of wrangling with various financial instutions, I managed to get a meager amount of cash from a check-cashing place and we were off again, albeit a bit more frugal this day. By the end of the day we were practically broke again, but we had a shuttle arranged to the airport and a fairly early flight to Portland where (I thought) several plastic cards awaited my return.

5:40 am, Saturday: After loading our luggage onto the shuttle, the driver notified us that we owed him $16. We explained to him that we didn't, since the shuttle cost nothing according to Hotels.com and, despite that, we had grudgingly coughed up the $4 dollars the hotel charged us for shuttle passes. Turns out that wasn't true: the $4 was simply to <b>reserve</b> seating on the shuttle. A long, bitter, and ultimately hostile debate ensued between the desk clerk and I about this, but the lady was unmoved: ""You should remember to always have a few dollars handy"" was the most help I could get out of her. Perhaps sensing that I was about to commit murder, the driver, silent and stoic up to this point, finally offered to pay our fare in return for a personal check from me. I nearly wept in gratitude.

We made it from New Orleans to Phoenix without incident and boarded our plane to Portland, looking forward to finally eating once we got home. As we backed away from the gate, there was an unobtrusive, but distinct, <b>THWUMP</b> noise from one side of the plane. Now, I'm a somewhat nervy flyer, and I make it a point to ignore any sound a plane makes so I don't start craning my neck to see if one of the engines decided to land ahead of schedule or if William Shatner's crouched on the wing and shredding the flaps. Once I realized everyone <i>else</i> was peering out the right-side windows, though, I decided to pay attention. It turns out that the plane to our right was backing away from the gate in synchronization with our own plane, and the wingtips had gracefully smacked into each other. After a 15 minute wait, a solicitation from our flight crew for the newly-opened position of ground-crew wingwalker, and several bags of pretzels, we rolled back to the gate and deplaned. 

To compensate for the fuck-up, the airline offered us -- nothing. (Well, yes, they wrangled a later flight for everyone, but apart from that, not a bit.) I politely asked several America West staff for a couple of meal vouchers, explaining our cashless plight, but since the delay was not longer than four hours, we only got well-shined teeth displayed in ""fuck off"" smiles from the personnel. In despair, <lj user=""badseedshalo""> pooled our change to see if we could at least buy a muffin from one of the food stands. (This was an airport, so of course we couldn't. You have to take out a loan to afford most airport food.) Then, another act of kindness: one of the other people stuck waiting for the second Portland plane just handed us a $20, stating only that we had to make the same kind of gesture when it was our turn to help someone in need -- a very ""Pay It Forward"" moment. Lady, wherever you are, thank you, and we definitely will. 

Upon our return to our house, we found:

<b>1)</b> A house crammed with my wordly belongings (the movers had come in my absence and <lj user=""blackchurch""> had generously helped guide their work),
<b>2)</b> A closed pet boarder's, so that my dogs were trapped until Monday, 
<b>3)</b> No debit/credit cards to help resolve item 2 above, and
<b>4)</b> The realization that the next day was Sunday and thus nothing could be done until Monday.

As of this time almost all the problems have been resolved, but I was a little stressy wreck the past few days. I'm finally calmed down. Going through the horde of collected beads helped cheer my mood, and <lj user=""irissong"">'s aid in moving crap around yesterday was MUCH appreciated."

I've noticed that a lot of my friends have been having various traumas, and I want to give a big, communal hug right here. If I've seemed callous when I've spoken to you online or on the phone it was simply my ignorance of what's been going on in your life. Forgive.

I was going to write a long travelogue about my trip across the country, but procrastination and laziness have worn away the memories and the urge. Also, the trip was pretty damn boring. Some random thoughts:
<UL>
<LI> Every state west of West Virginia appears to have a town called 'Meridian' off of the highway. I need to check a map to see if I was driving along some major longitude line -- or ley line -- or Clive Barker sequel.
<li> There really <b>are</b> tumbleweeds. They like flinging themselves in front of cars in fits of despair, then clutching the undercarriage of your car until your wheels can't touch the road anymore. They're also prickly and hard to fit in an overstuffed trunk. (<lj user=""badseedshalo""> and I think they'll look good spraypainted silver, though.)
<li> High winds + scores of semis + Wyoming = Good basis for a video game.
<li> Abandoned Stuckey's restaurants are creepy at 6:30am.
<li> They don't have mists in the midwest; they have miasmas.
<li> Western Nebraska is almost, but not quite, lethally boring to observe. (The 'So Dull It'll Kill Ya' award still goes to eastern Kansas.)
<li> Conversely, eastern Oregon is absolutely beautiful, although it'll make you feel very, very small. It's the closest thing I've ever encountered to Douglas' Adams ""Total Perspective Vortex."" Not that I've encountered this fictional contraption either, but... all right, you get the gist.
<li> Everyone (besides me) at the Snowville, Utah service stop has no concept of their body's relation to surrounding objects. They will walk into you, stop in doorways, and shove you with their elbows, apparently oblivious that they're not wandering, say, eastern Kansas.

"event","I've been trying to rid myself of a large green couch for a couple of months now. I tried to sell it at first, but after failing there I tried to donate it. Weirdly enough, no charities seemed to want it. They either wouldn't return my calls, or request that I have two other pieces of furniture for them to cart off, or they'd cheerfully inform me that the next pickup date was sometime after the sun was scheduled to become a red giant, consuming both the charity and the couch in question. I'd try to wheedle them with clever arguments (""Er, it's a nice couch and it's free""), but they were intractable. In despair, I finally called a hauling company to just take the couch away, possibly to the dump, possibly to Guam. 

<lj-cut text=""The couch would not give in so easily."">
After a delay of two hours, the hauler showed up. I opened the door to find a grizzled beard with eyes grinning at me (I could tell it was grinning because the eyes were squinted in a way that didn't appear to be assessing my throat). The beard introduced itself -- himself -- as ""Bob."" I asked Bob where the other hauler was, and he told me he was working solo that night. 

I felt guilty about this because in the two hours I'd waited I decided to also rid myself of a microwave so old it was probably a macrowave and an orange chair. It was a nice chair, one that Alistair Cooke might've felt comfortable in, but orange. Vibrant orange. A grab-your-eyeballs-and-throttle-them orange. There was also the fact that the couch was not something any human could move by themselves, so I offered to help out. I hefted the microwave, groaned, and waddled out to the truck.

I'm not exactly sure how the microwave wound up falling on my right ring finger, but I suspect the couch played Cassius during the previous evening, whispering treason into the microwave's ear. I set it down and it rolled (mind you, this is your typical boxy microwave, not a spheroid Ikea one) on my finger. Bob sensed my distress, possibly because I was swearing very loudly, and asked if I was OK. ""No, I think I've broken my finger and I can't really see straight at the moment,"" was the proper response. However, I thought of the Couch That Would Not Go Away and replied, ""Oh, I'm fine. I probably just need some ice on my finger later.""  

Bob handled the orange chair admirably and then we went to tackle the couch. Bob wisely suggested that we remove the cushions and he discovered a flashlight buried beneath. ""Don't wanna lose that,"" he chuckled -- and he was right. After a few moments of pain as I heaved with my injured hand, together we got the couch out the sliding glass doors, past the backyard gate, and into the truck without incident.  (There was a few harrowing moments where it seemed the couch wouldn't get out the glass doors; perhaps it had battened on my pain. We squeezed it through, however.) I thanked Bob, overpaid him (I didn't have the correct change), and sent my couch to its doom.  Satisfied, I went back inside and, after a brief check of the online world, let the dogs out into the backyard to make room for dinner. 

Somewhere, on a truck bound for oblivion, I'm sure the couch chuckled. A few knowing glances passed between it and its traveling companions, too. 

I then went into the kitchen, got ice for my finger, and set about mixing food, adding medication, and realizing that I spend more time preparing the critters' meals than I do my own. The process was prolonged because of my wounded finger, but after a while I set the food down and went back to let Malcolm and Sydney back inside.

Remember that backyard gate? I sure as Hell didn't. It was standing wide open, yawning into blackness... which had consumed my dogs. I did remember that flashlight, though. I wonder which order of angels Bob belongs to that he thought to rescue it from the bowels of the couch. 

Flashlight in hand, I sprinted out into the woods behind my house, shouting ""Malcolm"" and ""Sydney"" until I got hoarse. (I smoke so it's pretty easy for me to get hoarse). Never mind that Malcolm is as deaf as a cinderblock, and never mind that Sydney has only a passing interest in responding to his name: I shouted like a madman. After a few terrified minutes stumbling around I saw something small and furry patrolling my road, something that resolved itself into Sydney. He seemed baffled by my worry: ""What? I'm neighborhood watch tonight."" I got him back into the house (although, spying a woman walking a dog, Sydney put up a struggle since it was his duty to question the suspect canine) and then I went after Malcolm.

Malcolm is old, deaf and slightly blind. The only sense that seems to be functioning fully is his sense of smell, and so he sniffs everything that he happens to find. Find a spot where a chipmunk peed and he'll sniff that place for hours, trying to catch every nuance of the chipmunk's sex, health, and astrological houses. This is a Good Thing, because I found him not three doors down from mine, sniffing around at the back door of a neighbor. The neighbor owns dogs as well, and I suspect Malcolm was thinking, ""OK, I want to go back in now, and I smell dogs here, and I'm a dog, but I don't smell like this... oh, Saturn rising, how interesting."" He was a bit truculent when I interrupted his evening novella, but was mollified when he found there was food waiting for him.

I hope an incinerator awaits that damn couch.

All arrived safely and left safely, although the departure was marred by the news of the shuttle explosion. I shoved that aside rather than sour the last few hours of our visit. I figure I'll start processing the news over the next few hours.

I'm awaiting ASG's quote report mostly because I <b>think</b> we both had our witty moments, but I was too tipsy by the end of the night to recall much. I do know we were both disappointed in the DJ's musical selections, but there was an occasional bright moment (they played a Skinny Puppy song!). There was also art on the walls; I found seeing paintings of Mickey Mouse both refreshing and surreal while surrounded by people wearing metal studs. 

This morning we took lunch at the ""James Joyce Pub"", which eventually led to my semi-anti-intellectual griping about Joyce. ASG took it well. The service was excellent as was the food -- I highly recommend this place for a leisurely lunch. Even if you secretly grumble, ""What the fuck is 'riverrun'?""

It wasn't lurking when I bought it nor when I installed the new roll of tape in the gun (although there was a faint, whispery chuckling as I pulled off the sixth aborted starter strip, split down into a thin ribbon useful only for packaging hamster-sized boxes). The ninth time I contended with wad of tape worthy of becoming a roadside attraction in a fallow cornfield, the roll whizzing like a roulette wheel as it spewed out a stream onto the floor, my pants, the dogs, everything except the box I was trying to seal... that is when the tape gun started lurking. I took a few quizzes, hoping that the tape demon would grow dormant in the interim.

"event","<lj user='amberspyglass'> and I had a long phone conversation the other night -- that was abruptly cut by a bad cell and a worse cell phone battery. We talked about things MUSHy as we normally do, the conversation ranging from players' (mis)conceptions of settings and how that affects games to tales of really twinky players. During the discussion amberspyglass announced, ""I <i>hate</i> ICA=ICC!"" (Translated for the non-gamey who might be reading this for some unfathomable reason: In Character Actions = In Character Consequences."") I was shocked to hear this -- until I learned ASG's reasons.

<lj-cut text='...which are mostly glossed over here in lieu of my ramblings.'>
ASG's experience with ICA=ICC seemed to be that players used the equation as an excuse to have their PCs do something horrid to another PC. For example, let's say Thrudd the barbarian has a loathing for the color red: Winnie has no idea about Thrudd's bullish psychosis.

  Winnie sashays to the bar and waves her new red scarf at Thrudd. ""I just purchased this,"" she crows. ""Isn't it lovely?""
  Thrudd balls a fist, then hurls a frighteningly fast right hook at Winnie's jaw.

This is <b>not</b> an example of ICA=ICC. Winnie's ""action"" (daring to wear something red) does <b>not</b> justify the consequential fist. Now, assuming Winnie's player just runs with the scene and takes the swat, and then Bob the bartender, rising to Winnie's defense, tries to break a bottle over Thrudd's head, <b>that</b> would be an example of ICA=ICC -- Thrudd threw a punch, so he opened himself up to people trying to beat the tar out of him. If Thrudd's player doesn't consent to Thrudd taking a bottle to his noggin... well, most places have a @toad command.

ICA = ICC is meant to protect players and staff from people who do nasty things (spray paint a police car, invade Paraguay, try to poison the archbishop) then try to weasel out of any punishment by claiming they don't consent to the repercussions. To my mind there's also an implication of ""equal and opposite"" reaction; if my PC tries to slap your PC, I shouldn't gripe when your PC slaps mine. I probably have a good complaint when your PC devours my soul as retaliation for a slap, though. If my PC walks into a bank and lets go with a spray of automatic weapons fire on the hapless NPCs in the background then staff has a right to have the NPC police hunt me down. Etc, etc.

Taking an action that may have a consequence wanders into the realm of ""consent,"" which is whole 'nuther issue completely... although I want to mention that certain characters open themselves up to antagonistic actions more than others. If I play a troll in a setting where it's stated, ""The majority of the elven populace shun trolls, viewing them as objects of derision at best,"" then I should expect elven PCs to act nastily towards my PC just as a matter of course. If I play an important PC -- a vampire Prince on a WoD MUSH, for example -- I should expect pretenders to the throne to try and discredit the PC, undermine him, and possibly assault him directly. Conversely, a character's relative social standing (power?) will affect consequences as well. If a peasant and a king are both in a room and one of them says to the other, ""Ye Gods, you stink like a pile of pig dung,"" the consequences should depend on who's doing the speaking. 

It's sad that the very people ICA=ICC was made to protect us from are using it as justification for IC antagonism. That's not the intent of the rule, and anyone who claims otherwise needs to really think about what they consider fair and fun.

"event","I read the review of <I>Rules to Live By</I> on <A HREF=""http://www.rpg.net"">rpg.net</A> after purchasing the game. 
I felt the reviewer's own personal biases really skewed his review, so I decided to write my own. I may post a revised version of this on <A HREF=http://www.rpg.net"">rpg.net</A>. I might not. I might dye my dogs taupe. Who can say?

<lj-cut text=""For a long review, click me!"">
RtLB is a shoddy-looking product, at least on the inside (the cover's not bad). The artwork is just awful in most cases and the layout is often muddled. This is not a slick-looking Mind's Eye Theatre book. It's also 8 1/2 x 11 sized, so it's not easy to keep it unobtrusive when you're IC. This leads me on a tangent about LARP systems in general...

Why create a LARP system? The reviewer mentions that the RtLB system is very close to GURPS (and it is) -- so why not just use GURPS, or FUDGE, or regular old WW tabletop instead of MET? Is the medium so different that it warrants a completely separate system? I think so (although I am very tempted to create a LARP system based off of FUDGE after reading this book). 

Presuming that you want a system for your LARP at all, the medium demands a system that is as invisible as possible. You <i>could</i> LARP using, oh, Chaosium's tabletop Call of Cthulhu rules, but I think the dice rolls and character-sheet consultation would really intrude on the flow of play. (People argue that such things intrude on tabletop games as well, and that may be true, but I feel that most tabletop games can have a level of OOC-ness (such as describing what your character is doing, for example) that isn't as acceptable in a LARP).

RtLB has a very simple task resolution system, boiling down to: attribute + ability vs. target number. All the numbers are kept small, ranging from 1 to 10, so that the math should be fairly painless. You lose granularity this way, which (to my mind) is a shame, but the simplicity helps keep the system invisible.

Then things get weird.

RtLB uses a randomizing element. I like this. I like randomizing elements in RPGs. (I know: ""He likes rolling dice, he likes a character sheet; I bet he prefers 8-tracks."") However, the randomizing element is a six-sided die stuck in one of those plastic toy containers you can get from a supermarket gumball machine. They spend a sidebar defending the decision, but I wasn't convinced. I'm not condemning dice because they'll cause a break in the flow of the game, but because:

1) It's an OOC object that people have to lug around, and

2) Trying to run a fifteen-character combat using dice with people scattered across a 20 by 20 area would be a nightmare. (I've run such scenes and they're nightmarish with rock-paper-scissors, too, but at least you can see that someone chose 'paper' from across a parking lot).

The game <i>does</i> offer a diceless system called ""Finger Flings."" It's like Rock-Paper-Scissors, but not quite. It looks quick and simple, and I can't see why they didn't use this as the main system and the dice as the optional system. The Finger Flinging is about half as ""granular"" as the dice system, true, but it seems like a suitable tradeoff.

Not as bad, but still irksome, is the ""star"" system. You're supposed to put little sticky stars on you to show how much damage you've taken. It's a quick way to see how battered someone appears, but the game implies you should do this after each hit, slowing game play down even more. You also better have a name badge to receive the stars; I can't believe the writers are serious when they suggest you can stick the stars on your clothing. In ten minutes it'll look like the characters shoe-soles all suffered bastinado.

A big rulebook, little clattery dice, and star-sticky-breaks: not good for keeping the system invisible.

There are several other elements to the system that irk me to one degree or another:

1) PC attributes are STR, IQ, DEX, and WIL (although the authors encourage you to make up others as desired). In combat, people go in order of their <i>WIL</i> stat. ""Yes, he's a geriatric wizard, but he's got <i>astounding</i> reflexes..."" 

2) You have one pool of points to spread across attributes, abilities, and background stats (Weath, Advantages, and so forth). I prefer to have each ""stat category"" have its own pool of points, a la White Wolf. Adding attributes requires that you 
increase this overall point pool rather than just an Attribute point pool.

3) Attributes count more than Abilities when attempting a task. I'm of the mindset that practice beats raw talent most of the time, so this seems backwards to me. The system <i>appears</i> to give Attributes the same weight as abilities in the ""Attribute + Ability vs. target number"" equasion, but the sample ""Doctor"" character sheet has an IQ attribute of 7 and a First Aid skill of 2 (the sheet has no skill above 2). The rules state that 5 should be the maximum value for a starting PC's skills, whereas 7 is the (human) maximum for Attributes. Also, given the One Big Point Pool mentioned previously, the system really favors people who maximize their Attributes, purchasing small values in a variety of skills. 

4) A fist is just as lethal as a knife in the short term. If I punch the average character ten times they will die. To kill the same character with a knife, I'd have to stab them -- ten times. To be fair, I have to mention that if I punch the same character eight times then walk away they'd be alive (if feeling awful) after ten minutes, whereas if I stabbed them eight times they'd be dead after ten minutes. 

So, what's <i>good</i> about this game?

I think the system is very easy for gamers to learn, and probably quick for non-gamers as well. The skill list is comprehensive, and the GM-related information is solid if not stellar. I've only skimmed the supernatural supplement, but I think this game, even without modification, is quicker and more sensible than MET. (I keep comparing it to MET because I'm familiar with the MET system and it's the only other system I know that's LARP-specific and includes a randomizing element). I'd be happy to use this system without modification for a one-to-three day Convention game (although I would eschew the dice system in favor of the Finger-Fling system). For a longer campaign-style game I'd modify it heavily or simply use it as a jumping-off point for designing my own system. 

If you enjoy LARPs and would like to venture outside of the MET standard, I'd recommend this product if only to get your own game-design juices flowing. If you have no interest in LARP, or prefer to stick to systemless games, then steer clear. If you prefer systemless, though, I have to wonder why you'd bother even purchasing a LARP system in the first place.</lj-cut>"

"event","I threatened to review a few RPGs in my last missive, but I now realize that most everything's been thoroughly covered on rpg.net... all right, all right, I'm just too damn lazy to write up my own reviews. Still, I'll give my brief impressions (brief for me, anyhow) of most of the games and write at length about <I>Rules to Live By</I> in a separate post, since I feel the book didn't get adequate coverage on rpg.net. 

<lj-cut text=""Ramblings about Everlasting"">
<B>Everlasting: The Book of the Unliving</b>

A WoD setting that isn't WoD -- hasn't been metaplotted or detailed ad nauseum, in other words. And it has ghouls! Real flesh-eating ghouls! As PCs! I'm delighted. The book needs some severe editing, even more that the standard RPG text requires. I like the setting; it's detailed without getting too overwrought, although there are probably four more vampire types than are really necessary. The system appears simple and sensible, nothing to brag about, and I'm tempted to just toss it and adapt the game to some other system. The Tarot card resolution system is all right -- I like the idea of using the major arcana as plot-affecting devices along the lines of Torg cards or Whimsy cards. A major flaw is that the book keeps alluding to rules contained in the unpublished book <I>Codex of Immortality.</I> Since VESI has now folded it's unlikely that this book will ever actually appear, leaving chunks of the system missing. These missing components could have been fleshed out on the many pages dedicated to grandiose tripe about ""legend making"" and ""lucid dreaming."" Now, I accept that role-playing can be a moving and artistic experience that exceeds ""I kill the mind flayer -- pass the pretzels,"" but I really get put off by such pretentious defensiveness. Write essays about the transcendent nature of good role-playing if you want, but don't use them as filler in a game.

I'm definitely willing to use the setting when I want my ""All Things Dark and Dreadful"" dose.</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Prattling about the Apocalypse"">
<B>Apocalypse</B>

I really can't comment on this since I haven't really delved into it, but the setting leaves me tepid. I purchased this as a rules supplement for CORPS rather than as a separate game anyhow, and from that standpoint it looks like it has some plunderable ideas.</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Pontifications on De Profundis"">
<B>De Profundis</B>

This book should have irritated me. I'm not a fan of systemless games, and this book has two of them (arguably three). At first glance the author appears to take his subject matter way too seriously (see my thoughts about Everlasting above). After the first five pages, though, I found myself really enjoying this book, and once my life settles down I plan on trying the letter-writing portion of the game. Some people had problems with the writing style, but I'm inclined to go easy on it considering that it was translated into English. 

There are two obvious games within the book. The first is the ""letter-writing"" game, where you take the role of a character that gets involved with some shadowy mystery. You write IC letters to other characters discussing your situation, seeking advice and perhaps getting referred to other characters. Eventually you will suffer some ghastly demise -- and then, presumably, take on your next character. The book provides an address for you to register your character so that you can find other characters that mesh with your concept (I don't have the book in front of me at the moment, so I can't quite remember exactly how you're supposed to find a fellow correspondent through this service). Unfortunately the address is managed by Hogshead Press, and according to their website they're leaving the RPG business, so I'm not sure what's going to happen with the ""pen pal"" list.

The second game is called ""Psychodrama"" (hmmm), which amounts to people sitting around without a GM and just creating a scene with the intent of scaring the bejeezus out of each other. I was reminded of old radio dramas and ""Puppetland"" from the example provided. This portion of the book takes only three pages (albeit in rather small type), but that's all it really needs -- and honestly it probably needs about half that space. It sounds interesting, although I'd have to overcome my self-consciousness for this sort of thing. 

The third section of the book (which actually comes between the two sections mentioned above) talks about getting into a headspace suitable for scaring yourself -- or getting ideas for scaring other people. I figure when people ask authors, ""where do you get your ideas from,"" tossing this section at the questioner would be a fitting response.</lj-cut>"

"event","I spent my Sunday driving around Fairfax, Virginia. I was feeling restless after my visit with <lj user=""badseedshalo""> several time zones away and just couldn't face a day thrashing around my house. Perhaps I wanted to give Northern Virginia a last good look before moving; I'm not sure. In any case, I wound up bobbling between three places: Borders Books, The Game Parlor, and a cyber cafe, with a few excursions for food in between.

I picked up ""The Golden Compass"" from Borders based on <lj user=""amberspyglass"">'s recommendation. I've only read about thirty pages of it thus far, but I'm enjoying it a lot. I tried to purchase something by Tim Powers on my second Borders trip, but alas, the store was closed. 

I spent several hours skulking through the aisles of The Game Parlor (hereafter referred to as ""Dweeb Paradise""). I have no idea how this place manages to stay in business -- probably through CCGs. They have items on the shelves that I know were there when Reagan was president, and probably haven't been touched by anything besides a feather duster since 1992. They have computer games on 5 1/4"" diskettes (""MS DOS <b>or</b> Windows!""), for crying out loud.

I had a maddening sense that Dweeb Paradise <b>was</B> organized, but I failed to discern <b>how</b> it was organized. It certainly wasn't by product type, since board games, comic books, miniatures, and RPGs commingled wantonly on the shelves. It wasn't by genre, nor by publisher (although I am pleased to report that White Wolf had its own section, creating a gravity well that kept the other products from drifting off into the parking lot). There was some underlying scheme, though, rustling just beyond the boundaries of comprehension. I suspect that minions of Yog Sothoth stock the shelves.

I haven't looked at RPGs in a very long time and the sheer volume of new material shocked me. <I>Engel</I>? <I>Demon: The Fallen</I>? <I>The Quintessential Chandler</I>? I drifted about with mouth agape. Eventually, based on another <lj user=""amberspyglass""> recommendation (I will eventually become her greatest creation), I tried to find Nobilis, but it turns out that was one item Dweeb Paradise didn't have. They did have the LARP rules, however. 

DP also had a copy of <I>The Collectors</I> from Rogue Publishing, written by a semi-acquaintance of mine. Run, do not walk, to get this product. I'm not just shilling for the fellow because he might read this, but because <I>The Collectors</I> is damn good. My only complaint with the published version is that some of the humorous asides in the game's original draft were cut. If you don't believe my biased opinion, check out the reviews on <A HREF=""http://www.rpg.net"">rpg.net</A>.

I eventually purchased <I>Rules To Live By</I> (a set of generic LARP rules), <I>De Profundis</I> (sort-of a PBM game, sort-of a rumination on strange head spaces), and <I>Apocalypse</I> (A CORPS setting). I will give knee-jerk reviews of these products in my next installment, along with my thoughts on <I>Everlasting: The Book of the Unliving</I>, my reading material on my long Saturday flight. 

There's not much to tell about the cyber cafe, except that staccato bursts of ""FUCK!"" served as the background music: most of the other patrons were 16-year-olds playing some multi-player shoot-em-up. The cafe didn't serve coffee either. Perhaps that's why everyone was shouting ""FUCK!""

Oh, lookie, more snow!"

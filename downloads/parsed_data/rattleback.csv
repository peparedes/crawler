<b>I recall one time I did a bag check on a man from Detroit, once the auto-making capital of the world. Having been informed by the x-ray operator that there was a bottle of water in the bag, I pulled it out and quickly sensed that something was slightly off. Then, I realized what it was: there was an enormous dildo rubber-banded to it. I then had an epiphany, spreading over me like a sunrise, beautiful and exhilarating: <em>he wanted me to have to deal with the dildo</em>. He did it on purpose. In rubber-banding that dildo to the water bottle he knew we would target, he seemed to say:</b>

<p><i><b>&ldquo;Yes, I have a dildo, federal officer. Even after the horrors of
9/11, I am still alive; full of vitality, love, sex and, later tonight,
that large dildo rubber-banded to the water you are about to confiscate
from me. That bottle of water, bought with hard-earned American dollars
to relinquish my bodily fluids, so as to make me strong and keep the
wheels of commerce of this great nation turning. In taking my water, I
want you, federal officer, to know that the terrorists have won, and
that you are complicit. I want you to see my dildo. To hold it in your
hand; to know that I, as well as my fellow passengers and countrymen,
are strong and resilient.</b></i></p><i><b>That we, the people of this great nation, can, and will, snap back, like that rubber band.&rdquo;</b></i>

"event","I was going to fry chicken tonight in some of the surplus bacon grease<lj user=""principaltogar""/>&nbsp;'s food paradigm shift has generated, but Whole&nbsp; Foods had fresh whole wheat tortillas, so I tried out a recent notion.<br /><br /> I filmed a cookie sheet with some of the aforementioned grease, dashed some seasoned salt on it, then put chicken thighs on the sheet skin-up, then put everything into a cold oven set to 450F, with the timer set for forty minutes. When the oven hit four-fifty, I sprinkled some more seasoning on top of the chicken, then ignored it until the timer went off. I broke loose the thighs and the <em>fond</em> with a spatula, put the cookie sheet on an incline, and left the thighs and salvaged crusty goodness to rest and drain about five minutes. <br /><br />Come time to eat, for each tortilla I took one thigh, removed and reserved the skin, and raked the meat off the bone. the meat went on the tortilla, followed by salsa, topped with the skin and a ration of pan goo. My Vision was for <em>salsa verde</em>, but my Vision turned out to be rubbish, or maybe the salsa was. Anyway, garlic-chile Cholula hot sauce turned out to be a better choice.<br /><br />Nom.

For one  thing, it risks making a holiday out of The Day America Got Its Ass  Kicked.

At some point America needs to stop  picking the national scab. If we&rsquo;re going to have ceremonies every year,  hold the big ones in Shanksville, and remind ourselves that it was <em>only </em>ordinary  people who behaved with distinction that day. Politicians who wish to  appear at the ceremony will be allowed to read from a prepared script  reading, in its entirety, &quot;Sorry.&quot; </strong> <br /><br />The prospect of tenth-anniversary observances fills me with horror.&nbsp; If we've got to have an institutionalized observance, the current way we're doing it makes us cogs in the perpetual-grievance machine that powers terrorism in the first place.

But as cost cutting and short term earnings fixation became more pervasive, average time of employment shortened greatly. And with that came a major shift in behavior: it made less and less sense for employers to hire talented people with good general competence and character and train them. They&rsquo;d be unlikely to recoup the cost of the investment. Instead, companies started more and more to seek staff, in that horrid corporate cliche, who could hit the ground running. For instance, headhunters would increasingly be tasked to find someone who was doing exactly the same job at a competitor firm. This tendency goes all the way down the food chain; for instance, I&rsquo;m told it&rsquo;s impossible to become a bartender in NYC unless you have at least two years of bartending experience.</strong>"

"event","I stocked us up pretty well Friday (DC Disaster Hint: shop at the tienda, the clientele is less panicky than the Whole Foods crowd.) so it's been pretty much a matter of sitting still and reading.  I've gotten through the second edition of John Guilmartin's <i>Gunpowder and Galleys</i>, which was even better than the 1974 original, a formative book for me when I encountered it in college.    <br /><br />Today's project was to turn a couple of pounds of flap meat that needed cooking into chile with black beans and roasted garlic.  I started by roasting a couple heads of garlic and dicing a good-sized onion - both left over from the Thanksgiving dinner I didn't make on account of the flood - then cutting up the beef and browning it in small batches in lard.  Once the beef was done, I sauteed the onions in the drippings and let them cool, then pureed them in the food processor.  The beef went into the pressure cooker with a tomato base made with two cups of water (should have been three, I think), a 1.5oz tub of More Than Gourmet demiglace, and a 5oz can of tomato paste; a half-hour under pressure reduced the meat to shreds.&nbsp; I added the pureed onion, a 2.5oz bottle of chile powder, two 15oz cans of black beans, and squished the garlic in, then mixed everything and simmered for a half-hour while farting around with the seasonings until I was happy: I ended up adding cumin, oregano, and various sorts of Hot Stuff, plus the juice of one and a half limes at the end to make it brighter.&nbsp;     <br /><br />There were fewer leftovers to put away than I'd figured on, which I take for a sign of success."

"event","Salami and egg salad:

--Boil three jumbo eggs.  There are many incredibly fussy egg-boiling algorithms, but throwing eggs into a disproportionate amount of cold water (about 1.5 gal/dozen), bringing them just to the boil, covering and switching off the heat, then ignoring them for a half-hour seems to involve the fewest moving parts.

--Dice the eggs, preferably in one of those piano-wire thingies.

--Dice 4oz salami.

--Combine the diced eggs and diced salami.  Add whopping great amounts of fresh black pepper if your salami isn't peppered already.

--Food-process the above all to the bejeezus.  Apply the way you would yer normal egg salad, except for the feeding-to-vegetarians part."

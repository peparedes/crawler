Basically I haven't been up to shit really. I'm going to a rockabilly show at Jugheads in Phoenix tonight to see some band I've never even heard of, but it'll be cool to get out and see a show since I haven't been to one since I saw Social D back in November. I finally got an X-Box, woohoo, now I get to see what I've been missing since I bought Halo as well. Good shit. Last two movies I saw were Starsky and Hutch (funny shit, do it...do it...) and 50 First Dates which I also thought was pretty damn good, although it was a little sad at the end (yeah I know I'm a big softie). This weekend I'm gonna go see Dawn of the Dead even though Kay doesn't want to. She works anyway all weekend, so I'll check it out. Also Saturday I'm playing softball for the Edward Jones 1st Annual Tempe Data Center Softball Tournament. Starting at catcher and hitting 5th, wish me luck! I was considering posting some more naughty pics in a community or two, but they never seem to elicit much of a reaction aside from the occasional comments from gay guys, lol. Who knows, I'm feeling frisky as always, so I might just hafta do it. Anyways, I'll add more later hopefully. Cheers..."

"event","If I see one more article talking about how much of a ""genius"" some club DJ is, I'm gonna go ballistic! I'm sure it takes a whole lot of talent to sample someone else's music and take credit for it, but try playing an instrument and actually write your own music, and see how much of a genius these guys really are. Yeesh..."

"event","There are some things I'd like to write about but for the life of me I cannot remember what they are. Only a month or so before I head to Cairns/Port Douglas for holidays - returning, as I candidly put it, to the place of my downfall (literally - when I fell in the Daintree and broke my leg back in June '05). While convalescing then, this blog became a bit of a lifesaver as I was able to fill hours of boredom with blog entries that showed me the value of keeping a journal.

Unfortunately, things of late have been rather busy that I have not had much opportunity or motivation to continue this blog.

It's a quiet night tonight. Mac is off at his sister's for dinner, and I'm just taking things easy with a glass of wine and a bit of reflection. Quiet times that have become a bit of a rare commodity since I acquired a housemate. Funny, that with a housemate, I have this feeling that my time should be spent in conversation with Mac, or at least interacting with him, so much so that I do miss the ""my time"" or the ""quiet times"".

Today, I picked up the Sigma f1.4 30mm lens. That's really all I'll write about it.

I have also been very remiss with the gym/swim thing over the last 2-3 weeks, the upshot of which is further weight gain which I am not happy about. Not happy Jan. Not happy at all. I'm finding it difficult, the the increased social activity and also cooking for two (on my cooking nights) to keep to a low-calorie diet. And Mac getting Magnum ice-creams obviously does not help. :-)

Things feel a bit flat. There are plenty of things happening but none of them _feel_ consequential, if you know what I mean. I feel as if I'm just filling time with things to occupy my mind but which have no value in the long term. I'm trying to understand the cause of this feeling, why I think this way. Photography, exhibitions, travel have all become part of this ""filling time"" sensation. I wonder what's around the corner?

Life feels good now, but also so pointless. It borders on hedonism and I feel as if I am ignoring key values to which I had clung only two or so years ago.

In Perth today -- I had driven in after work to pick up the lens -- I noticed a number of people begging. A middle aged man in a t-shirt and trackie dacks asked for money to buy cigarettes. A fairly well-dressed bearded man with a back pack and tatts sat in a corner with a sign asking for money. He did not engage with passers by. A short, middle-aged bloke was selling The Big Issue outside a store (I bought an issue). An old woman, with bedraggled, oily hair sat on a portable chair outside the same store, begging, but she said nothing to passers by. Just had a MacDonald's paper cup at her feet. A bunch of young men and women - whom I first mistook for the emo crowd - hung at the bus stand just outside Wesley Church; I think they are homeless young people. I'm not sure what to make of this. In groups or individually, they occupy unbreachable spaces. Even with the guy from whom I bought The Big Issue: I wished him a good weekend. What fucking crap! The notion of a good weekend only makes sense if you're working; it's based on the assumption that after a week of hard work, the worker has some time off to enjoy -- an experience which does not apply to the Big Issue vendor. I felt like an absolute twat after I said that, so I nodded, embarrassed, and waved as I walked off."

"event","How long since my last blog post? I've let this poor wee fella fester on the roadside while I went on my merry way through life.

It's been a tiring day today: perhaps a combination of heat (can you believe it hit 30C today - and it's April/Autumn) and having to come home and cook a meal. I'm not almost through a glass of cab shiraz (Baldivis Estate) and feeling&nbsp;a bit calmer, a bit more mellow. Rather than try and catch up with events that have happened since my last blog entry, I'll just write about what's happening now.

Tomorrow night's the Launch of this year's Site Unseen Exhibition - at the Town Hall, and I'm looking forward to just having a great time. Feisty gave me a free tix to the event, and invited me over to the after party at her place, so I intend to get merry, especially seeing as it's the long Easter weekend. Now, I know it's not generally the practice to conduct such inappropriate revelry on such a solemn occasion as Good Friday and Easter, but I think I will be excused a little if I enjoyed myself, as I have been tired of late and doing my hardest to keep abreast (afloat?) despite the housemate issues that have been occurring recently.

I also conducted a photo shoot for my In-camera Exposure project on the Sunday just past - what an experience it was. In case you didn't know the project involves photographing other photographers in the nude, with their camera/s to explore the connection that photographers have with their camera equipment. Sunday was Blondie's shoot - I've only met her about 2-3 times and was myself surprised when she contacted me wanting to model for the project. It all went remarkably well - she found the experience empowering and liberating, and I found that I was able to switch off and focus on the job as a photography, and learned a lot more about myself and my capacity as a photographer. All in all, a very positive experience for both model and photographer.

On the home-front, Mr Mac's on/off again thing with Katie is a bit wearying on me. I try to be the supportive friend and housemate but I fear that it is beginning to wear a little thin on me, if only because my capacity for empathy is perhaps slowly dwindling. I also find myself idly resenting the fact that I seem to be pulling the bulk of the weight at home -- not a problem if I were living single, but with the housemate, I seem to be doing most of the cooking, cleaning, washing etc. ie the duties of the 'responsible adult'. I'm trying very hard to be detached and 'Zen' about it - ie. give without expecting anything in return, receive without feeling obligated - but I sometimes feel that my housemate is so caught up in his own affairs, in his own problems, that he fails to, or is unable to, engage with the requirements of a shared household. Or perhaps he just doesn't share my attitude towards keeping things to a reasonable standard of neatness and cleanliness. For instance, he removes things from shelves and does not put them back.

Ah, enough griping. I'm sure I'll be looking back on this one day and having a quiet snigger at how petty I am now.

Onto more changes: my Canadian friend, D, is now married and will be relocating to England from Winniped (hi D!). The news of the wedding came as a surprise as there were no indications in the years of email exchanges we conducted since... 2002. But I'm happy for her as it means that she has finally found a place outside of Winnipeg (!) to settle, and being located in the UK puts so many places in Europe within a couple of hours' reach.

I've also booked a flight to Cairns in June - will spend 2 weeks there (well, in Port Douglas and the Tablelands). After my disasterous last trip, I'm definitely going to take things a bit more carefully there - and will make this more a relaxing holiday than a run around and do everything trip. I plan on hiring a car and doing a drive - at the very least around the waterfalls in the Tablelands, and then up to Port Douglas, Mosman and the Daintree. Hopefully, all will go well this time.

Well, glass of wine is almost gone, and so endeth this post."

"event","It's the eve of Chinese New Year and I'm just about to wrap up the house cleaning. It's been a frenetic day - off to Cottesloe Beach to photograph the Rottnest Channel Swim this morning only to find that it was cancelled due to rough conditions. But that didn't stop a few people from braving the ocean to do a mini-swim around the Pylon, so I stayed around and photographed them. The images can be <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/sengster/sets/72157594539971745/"">viewed here</a>.<br /><br />Mr Mac is having a snooze, having just returned from work, while I've just placed new bulbs in the 70s style chandeliars so that there will be light tomorrow morning when we welcome in the New Year. Tonight's dinner with the extended family - but I've already gorged myself with terrible, terrible snack food, including Melaka kueh and a Magnum almond encrusted chocolate ice-cream (329 calories!). God only knows how I'm going to shed these cals!<br /><br />I've organised a small Chinese New Year lunch tomorrow with Mac and a few friends - I'm not cooking and will be relying on take away from Chin's Noodle House.

"event","I feel like writing tonight so I'm just going to let the words come.

Firstly, for the last two weeks,&nbsp;I have been feeling very restless, yet unable to pinpoint the source of this restless energy. It feels as if there is fog in my head, and around me, and I am unable to think, see or feel my way in anything resembling the right direction. So, I have been wandering aimlessly, fruitlessly, as though lost and without a map or an inkling of where I am or where I'm heading. Some would think this a feeling of tremendous liberation, but it weighs heavily on my conscience. I feel a change in mindset coming and I don't want to acknowledge it, nor do I want it to occur. I do not want these thoughts disrupting my placid happiness, the stability of my being at this point in time. I've been feeling jittery, anxious, dwelling on negative sentiments of late and I want out of this frame of mind. I want out!

I joined the photowalkers on a photo walk around Mosman Park yesterday. Today, the photowalking group is so full of praise and excitement yet, for me, the photowalk yesterday was uninteresting and underwhelming. Again, it could merely be my uninterested, disconnected state of mind but I felt completely detached from the experience, almost resenting it. I beat a hasty retreat after an hour or so.

Today was Owen's big party for turning 1 and again, I felt withdrawn and detached from the proceedings. Instead, I busied myself with getting the food and drinks ready, and carrying Owen around, and not really connecting with the other guests. Pete wasn't there, neither were Art or Gosh, and I don't associate well (read: play well) with most of the other people there. I know that I'm usually outgoing and quite social but just didn't feel like I wanted to get into any conversations there.

I think I'm starting to resent the company of others. I'm not sure why, or what's triggered it, but the thought of yakking with strangers or folk I don't know too well bores the feck out of me. It's this ridiculous mood I'm in and I'm not sure how to get out of it. I wish I knew what occasioned it - at least then I'll be able to work my way through it.

I resent the fact that I spend so much time on photography, yet I'm continuously drawn to taking photographs and wanting to talk about photographs.
I resent the many social gigs and meets that I have had to attend, yet I'm drawn to the social nature of these gatherings.
I resent having to bite my tongue and appear jovial when dealing with Mr Mac, yet I've grown to enjoy&nbsp;his company and friendship.

Is it a case of my now resenting what I had previously enjoyed? What I previously loved doing? And if this is the case, then I fear a change is coming, and it's a change I do not approve or value. I'm too focused on insecurities - anxieties about failure, about under-performance are more often in my thoughts these days than feelings of well-being and compassion. Something plagues places in my mind that I cannot reach with my thoughts. It dwells and gnaws from deep within.

I need to rise above this miasma, this grey, grey shroud&nbsp; that blankets my thinking.

But I do not know how.

Sometimes, I wonder if this is just an 'off period' - a mild blue period, or depressive episode (am I depressed?), a product of chemical imbalances within my brain - and if it is, perhaps it will pass and I will just need to weather it. But this is just a thought and I know that I have been feeling like this for a while now. While it's not been as bad as in the past, I thought I was done with such feelings since 2003 when there was one such occurrence. Perhaps I'm wrong.

Think happy shiny thoughts.
Think happy shiny thoughts!!!"

"event","<p>I'm on a biorhythmic low at the moment - feeling very unenergetic, unmotivated and just flat. At least I'm aware of this, so that I can manage my emotions and reactions when things happen which may not be of a very positive nature.<br /><br />I decided tonight that I would go and watch <em>Happy Feet</em> as I had intended lo those many weeks ago. Visually, it is highly arresting and impressive - I have never seen any landscape rendered to naturally, yet also so dramatically, as the way the Antarctic setting is rendered in this film. The storyline itself was, for me, luke warm; even the characterisation was fairly full. Perhaps I'm just not a penguin person -&nbsp;I was rather underwhelmed by <em>March of the Penguin</em> and <em>Happy Feet</em> reprises certain themes from the documentary, though with a Disney-esque glow about it. :-)<br /><br />I've also been thinking of exhibition ideas. Thusly:<br /><br />1. <strong>Sons of Beaches</strong>: I think this will be&nbsp;a go-er -- an exhibition that&nbsp;presents a revisioning of&nbsp;the iconic Australian&nbsp;surf lifesaver and the life saving tradition which, while giving a nod to its macho past, also explores ways in which these 'gladiators of the surf' can be represented photographically in ways which are part-documentary and part-art. I'm thinking of interspersing images of the lifesavers themselves with images of club houses (the older style ones), watch towers and of beaches, to add a more solid idea of context to the images -- so that they are not just viewed as action shots. I was also thinking of including archival images or footage - which I will need to source from Surf Life Saving WA, and of offering 50% of the profit from sales to SLSWA.<br /><br />2. <strong>Chaos and Drama</strong> (working title): a selection of my 'travel photos' from my trip to Greece, which examines and explores the tension between traditional travel photography, where the photographer is always the outsider, looking in at the exotic 'other', and my need, as a photographer, to connect with a space or community in order to photograph it, which is at odds with the tradition of travel photography that celebrate the uniqueness (the 'otherness' or foreignness) of communities and environments, as evidenced in the colour inserts within travel guidebooks such as the Lonely Planet. The selection will include postcard-esque shots (such as the long exposure landscapes), holiday snapshots, as well as my more documentary images taken where I felt a strong connection with a place.<br /><br />3. <strong>subUrbia</strong> (working title): I've recently become fascinated by monumentalistic constructions found within suburbia, for example, take-away outlets and petrol stations which stand, like modern shrines, in the centre of vast car parks. I'm going to try and photograph these establishments in medium format (with the TLR) and see what happens. Initially, I thought about posing people in front of these buildings but the more I think about it, the more I believe that the photographs should focus solely on the monolithic nature of these buildings.</p>"

"event","<p>I've been having work dreams, clearly an indication that some aspect of work is bearing some weight in my mind. Dream #1 had me accepting another position elsewhere but then realising that I didn't want the new position and wanted to stay where I was. Dream #2 had me sleeping in till 11.30am due to over-exhaustion (not work-related) and then waking up to wonder how I would explain it to the people at work. They're not particularly unpleasant dreams, but neither are they pleasant ones. Thing is, these dreams are about work in general, not just an aspect of work eg. a task or project. I wonder if I'm working through my attitude in general towards work in my sub-conscious.<br /><br />I felt very flat yesterday and didn't want to do much when I got home from work, so I played Jade Empire again on the Xbox for a couple of hours, then went to bed. Mr Mac wanted to go on a dusk photoshoot but I just felt like vegeing out on the couch and doing nothing too intellectually taxing. Then, I got a headache due to motion sickness from playing the game... :-( Oh, and I ended up having to cook again last night as Mac didn't feel like cooking. But at least he did all the washing up - even if it meant my having to clean up the washed dishes as he had stacked the clean dishes all in the dirty sink (!).&nbsp;<br /><br />I've actually been feeling very flat since the weekend... I can't seem to be enthused about things, consumed in this strange ennui as I am.<br /><br /><em>Heroes</em> debuts on the TV tonight - I'm looking forward to it. I'm actually just looking forward to watching more television these days given that the ratings period has just kicked back in. Bad huh?</p>"

"event","<p>This year, I'm going to make an effort to photograph the start of the Rottnest Channel Swim. For those not in the know, this is the ultimate Open Water Swim in WA - with competitors swimming the 19 or so kilometres from Perth (Cottesloe) to Rottnest. The swim begins at about 5 am'ish, I believe, and teams head into the water in groups. Hopefully, this will let me build on the images in my 'Sons of Beaches' photography project.</p><p>Australia Day has come and gone and it was a scorcher of a weekend - temps in high 30s and low 40s C, with searingly hot easterlies. I'm surprised that my lawn survivied the heatwave. I went to the Freo Aust Day fireworks with Pazza aka Scott aka P.du.V from Flickr/PIP and met up with Noobs, Antz and Atrei too. The fireworks display was a small affair but there was a great buzz around the fishing boat harbour and nary a nasty moment - so a good time was had by all. Down at Bather's Beach after the fireworks, crowds gathered to watch the lightning show as thunderclouds moved in. However, apart from a few sprinkles, there wasn't much rain despite all the celestial fanfare.</p><p>I've started lunchtime swims at Cottesloe Beach with the guys from work, complementing the morning swim/gym sessions. Unfortunately, I don't seem to be cutting down the daily consumption of cals (due to the lack of flavour in low-cal food and my need for flavour in my food :-) ) - so the weight has stayed pretty steady which is a bit disappointing. Plus stopping for a tall choc chip java frappe en route to work isn't doing the cal count any favours idea.</p><p>I must admit to finding journal style blogging at this point in time to be rather turgid. I was discussing this with D via email and mentioned that perhaps the drop in blogging activity can be attributed to the fact that I now have a housemate to whom I can vent at the end of the day. But I think that's only half of it. I'm also busier these days, which means less time to reflect on things which I have previously found time on which to reflect. I know that I feel as if I have lost an aspect of my thinking which has been valuable to me in terms of grounding me in the way I want to relate to this world. Perhaps I have now internalised these values and no longer need to be explicit about them.</p><p>Who knows?<br /></p>"

I was going to say that I hope this will be&nbsp;a year free of suffering for humanity - instead, I'll say that I hope this is the year in which humanity's conscience is raised to such a level that we begin acting, as a group, against agents and agencies who would seek to profit by creating suffering, whether directly or indirectly. I hope this is the year in which we realise and actualise our capacity to be agents of change for the betterment of all people and all&nbsp;sentient beings,&nbsp;and of the environment. I hope this is the year in which we forsake capital, greed and power, and turn instead to compassion, kindness and generosity. I hope this year finds us working against our own propensities towards prejudice, judgmentalism, parochialism, ignorance, avoidance and single-mindedness. I hope this is the year in which&nbsp;we become more human and more humane&nbsp;as a people.&nbsp;I hope all of this because I sometimes think that we may not get many more chances at it.

We had a semi-impromptu NYE party last night - only organised on Saturday. Present were Guy Mac, Sckwish, Shem and Jazz, Matt and Sharon, Terri and Stephan, and myself. It was a very laid back affair and most enjoyable because of it - though I think there was a small issue towards the end as Matt and Sharon had not worked out who was driving home and both had been drinking. Oo-er! :-)

Today's the last day of my holidays and I feel rested (if still slightly woozy from last night) - it feels as if I have had a good, restful holiday, and that I have achieved a number of things I have set out to achieve."

Shem and Jazz were going to organise&nbsp;a NYE thing for a group of us photographers, so I had told TS that, in all probability, I wouldn't be going to his NYE party at his place (I've been to his NYE parties over the last 3 or so years and was looking forward to something a wee bit different this year). But it looks like S and J have yet to get things going (I'm writing this on the eve before NYE!) so it may be back to the Sinagras for NYE this year. I'm catching up with S+J for dim sum at lunch today so would be interesting to hear if they have anything planned for NYE.

I made a road trip with Nath to Goomaling to photograph Yalmunging Rock and its surrounds. Spent the night at XTK and A's place, and had a good play with baby Ash who is too cute for words. He's a very amiable, interactive and happy baby which, I think, is a relfection of the quiet, confident calm that comes from his parents. They are two of the most gentle and grounded people I know, and it was almost a breath of fresh air to be in their company after the recent roller-coaster ride of living with GuyMac and his women troubles. :-)

I'm going to try and get some errands done today, namely drop off roll-up poster to Fitzgeralds (what GM was supposed to have done weeks ago), and I'd also like to spend some time browsing in Border's Bookstore. As I was 'complaining' to Nath during our road-trip, I've never had the opportunity to just browse and relax because the two times I've been there in the past have been with people (aka GM) who aren't into books so I felt constrained in the amount of time I could spend there.

On the homefront, AAH has finally left M&amp;D's place - M found her a unit a couple of suburbs away and spent much of yesterday helping her move.&nbsp;I was over for dinner last night and was listening to her speak to M as M was packing up some leftovers for her to have for lunch or dinner the next day: she was so demanding (""Put in more chilli"", ""That's enough pork"") that I was on the verge of firmly asking her to stop speaking to M that way and to show some respect and gratitude for what M and D have done in the last month since she broke up with her husband, moved out and went crazy. But I bit my tongue. She's been decidely very uncommunicative towards me as she knows I dislike her being there and have been trying to convince M and D to get her to move out so that she will cease having that awful influence on them. No doubt she will continue to be as demanding as she hasn't moved that far away but at least she is not in their house 24/7. I can't forgive her for the stresses that she put M&amp;D through in the last few weeks."

"event","... or when next I say that I will photograph a wedding <em>pro bono</em>.<br /><br />Did Roberto and Sarah's wedding yesterday with Nathan. I wasn't feeling up to it, what with Sunday being such a warm and humid day and my feeling very tired due to a series of late nights and very early mornings. I remember being sprawled on the couch telling GuyMac that I resented having to do this wedding as it took out the bulk of my Sunday weekend day. Fast forward 10 hours and I was a mess. I had spent 5 hours doing the shoot both&nbsp; of the groom's preparation at Rob's home, then of the ceremony at St Michael the Archangel in West Leederville, and was severely dehydrated at the end of it (why I left my water bottle at home, I don't know). Then, I was going to the folks' for dinner but Sarah convinced me otherwise as they had arranged places at a table for both Nathan and I at the reception. So it became a late night, filled with too much photography and pressure to perform (during which the batteries in my flash and camera decided to die - despite my having diligently charged them the day before), and I was very, very tired when I chugged into the driiveway at about 11pm.<br /><br />GuyMac found the whole shindig to be quite upsetting because it celebrated the union of his ex's sister and one of his friends, and there were feelings of discontent and disappointment that his own relationship did not work out. He imbibed a little too much and got a wee bit merry, which in his case, meant going from being ""overpoweringly social and blunt"" to being ""overpoweringly social and exposing himself in public"". Dear, oh dear! :-) I must admit that I egged him on, thinking that he wouldn't do it, and when he fumbled with his zipper, I thought it was all for a joke when OUT it came, waggling about like one of the sand worms from Dune (only smaller :-) ). No doubt, I will probably get into a heap of shit for writing this (or calling it 'small') if GM reads this. :-) But drunk people are funny. Funny! Oh, and interestingly, the bridesmaids at the wedding wore dresses with extremely plunging necklines and rather risque hem lines. I wonder who chose their dresses?<br /><br />Oh yeah, and a copper stopped me and issued me an infringement on Friday night as I was rushing in to Freo to rendezvous with Flickrite All Is Revealed (Oli). Apparently, if the lights are amber, you are meant to stop -- not just go through an amber set of lights. Ok, fair enough. But why is it that I will see other drivers run through red lights without a care in a world (!) and when I do so when the lights turn amber, I get pinged by the cop? Whatever happened to karma? Anyway, feeling as if some part of the universe was consipring against me, I caught up with Oli and his mate Pete and chatted for a bit. They came to the Xmas show at the PCP (which was decidedly low key) and then we segued to the Northbridge Hotel later that night for a wee drink. The Northbridge is not a bad spot - seemed quite family oriented with a dad and kids playing snooker. What these kids were doing up at around 10.30pm is anyone's guess... but I suppose it was a Saturday night."

"event","It's occurred to me that&nbsp;I have been neglecting this blog. It's not because I've turned my back on blogging - it's more a case of life becoming increasingly busy. Tonight's the first night in a long while where I have time to myself; hence, I've returned to blogging.<br /><br />The From Pixel to Print exhibition opening was a riot. Things rapidly became very busy and the gallery was chockers. I get confused in a crowd - a case of over-stimulation and fractured attention, but I recall being very pumped and excited on the night. I had chats with total strangers, talking about photography and this and that. Brendan and Nathan made a few sales and even Mr Mac sold his <em>Joy</em> photograph. No sales for me, alas, and while it is slightly disappointing, I've always affirmed that the exhibition's the thing to achieve and any sales would be a value-add or bonus.<br /><br />Because the exhibition, the onset of daylight saving (it was still twilit when I drove home from the APs at 8.45 pm tonight) and various social and work commitments (lovely work Xmas dinner last night at the Star Anise), I haven't maintained regular sleeping hours, and hence have been feeling rather flat. Today was a shocker at work - after last night's work Xmas dinner, I wasn't feeling 100% today and found myself struggling with the usual ego-related issues which in normal circumstances would not have caused a problem at all. :-(<br /><br />Mr Mac has started 'going out' with Shutter77. Sort of. They're going out - he's keen but she wants to take things slow and keep things casual for the nonce. I think this confuses him. Poor man. I've also had to bail Mac out on a car loan which has put a severe dent in my savings. He says he will pay me back in installments and I have helped him set up EFT transfer from his bank account to mine to make sure that the $$$ is put through.<br /><br />There has been a bit of upset on the family front - AAH has separated from JS after 15+ years of marriage. From what I understand, there has been some domestic violence in the past, which came to a climax last weekend, and the police were called. She's now with the APs and I don't know where he is. I just hope the APs will be ok through this - I guess in some respects, it was bound to happen and it's just taken 15 years. I worry a bit because JS is a mite unstable and I'm concerned he may get up to something untoward as a means of getting back at her.<br /><br />H and A's wedding went without a hitch and I must say that it was a very impressive day. I was very proud of the heartfelt speeches that both gave - particularly H who thanked the APs for their sacrifices. For long, I had thought that she was too young to realise why we moved to Australia and what the folks had to give up, and her recent actions (since she hooked up with A) didn't give me much confidence in her ability to value her family, but all my doubts were put to rest by the beautifully emotional speech she gave. I was almost moved to tears. But I was also the 'family photographer', so I had to go on and get the job done.<br /><br />My expenditure on camera gear has been phenomenal in the last month - thus reflected in a horrifying manner in my credit card bill for November. I almost fell out of my chair when I saw how much I had racked up on the old c-card! :-o I think I'll go easy from now on (he says, after having told Camera Electronic that he's going to get the battery grip!).<br /><br />This weekend: Lucey's exhibition on Friday night; lunch with Shem and Jazz at the PCP on Saturday; sitting at the PCP with Nath and Mr Mac on Sunday, followed by the closing party at 6pm. Will be busy, but socially fun!<br /><br /><br />"

"event","The last week has been most 'interesting' in the Chinese proverbial sense (ie. ""May you live in interesting times...""). I've been flat out trying to manage work, visiting relatives (who are here for HSB and A's wedding) and the exhibition, which opens tonight.

So - the exhibition. It opens tonight and I'm looking forward to it. More so in regards to meeting some of the others from PIP and to finally see the photographs being viewed (consumed?) by an audience. The lead-up to tonight has been stressful. Mostly. I very nearly lost it with Dozone on Sunday night when we had gathered at the PCP gallery so that Justin could walk us through some ideas for hanging the works in a cohesive way. In typical ""I'm an overbearing prick and I will bowl you over with my useless and unsubstantiated expertise"", Dozone took control of the reins and buzzed about the place offering suggestions and basically getting in the way of Justin doing his work and the others from working with him to make sure that their photographs were properly exhibited. I felt as if I was in 'damage control' trying to reduce the impact of Dozone's interference. For a guy who has done sweet FA for the exhibition, he certainly wants to have a lot of say - even to the extent of wanting to give the Opening Night speech. @!$!%#^@!!!!

Anyway, I'm going to have a good time tonight, regardless of Dozone's behaviour - it's not going to ruin the opening for me or the others. It's time to shine and schmooze, I think.

Because of exhibition preparation commitments, I have been unable to go to the pool or gym since Saturday, so I'm feeling very bloated and puny at the moment. I'll go for a swim this morning as I'd like to get some exercise before tonight, or I'll be zzzzz'ing before the exhibition opening night is part way through. I dropped in at Tony's last night to pick up the eskies for tonight's opening, and he's been flat out too - with work, dealing with m-i-l, and Jen's taken ill again with a sore neck, a legacy of the accident from last year. It seems that things are always happening for T and co, and not all of it good."

"event","So, it's HSB's wedding day today and the schedule promises to be chockers. I'm going to have to pick M up at 9 and then make our merry way to the church. The rellies descended upon us on Thursday (well, three of them) and I knocked off work early yesterday (thanks to pulling extra hours on Thursday) to take them to Freo. The experience was... err... muted. M wants me to take them out again tomorrow but at the moment, I'm not to keen. Why? Because I am so feckin' tired.

Woke up this morning with a head cold and feeling rather flu'ish. I suspect that I have been on the go all week and the body is telling me to slow down. It's also been a week of a few home truths being mentioned to Mr Mac about his contribution (or lack thereof) to the housemate dynamics and general support of a functioning household. At least he seems to have taken my comments on board... and started clearing the boxes up yesterday; but there are still boxes, and things that used to be in boxes are now on the dining table.

It's also Jazzy's 30th birthday party tonight, which I'll miss due to being at A and HSB's wedding reception. I'll get GM to drop my gift off to Jazz on my behalf.

Ok, better get on to it. A busy, busy day calls!"

"event","10 minutes before quitting time so I thought I'd pen&nbsp;a few lines in this rather neglected blog. Poor bloggy blog.

Well, it's starting&nbsp;to sound&nbsp; like a broken record but geeze have I been busy. Hence the neglecting of the blog. Guy Mac had his 31st birthday on Sunday (5th Nov) - started with a cooked BBQ breakfast (my attempt at keeping him at home as his friends were going to drop by at 9am to surprise him - which they did), followed by lunch at the Belgian Beer Cafe (where this rather overweight female major domo wouldn't let us move the tables and chairs to form a larger table and was quite rude about it), then watching 'Cars' and having a few drinks at home. The drinks proved to be too much for Mr Mac (as he had had 2.6 litres of full strength beer, followed by a bourbon and coke, then a white wine) who had to beat a hasty retreat to the toilet while he snoozed on the couch. I found him lying next to the bowl looking very sorry for himself. Ha ha. Oh, and there was also a trouser dropping incident before hand when a rather merry Mr Mac dropped his dacks in front of Stephan and Terri - dear oh dear indeed.

Work has been a bit snore-inducing lately, so I have found my mind wandering to more interesting prospects such as the upcoming exhibition. My prints are all done - most are at Frameography for mounting and matting, and I will be picking up the last large print from Fitzgerald's today. I hope the others are also getting their prints etc. organised - it's been a mild source of frustration by the inaction or lack of participation coming from some parts of the exhibition camp. Or maybe I just like playing the martyr.

Well, this Saturday's THE day. 36 years old on that day. Ulp. How can I be so old and yet feel so unprepared to face it? I'm having dinner and drinks at the Como. At least I can pretend to be all grown up due to having a birthday gathering at a pub!"

"event","It's been a while. I guess with things being as busy as they are, I have had not had much chance to be reflective and journalistic. :-) The hayfever has hit me hard this morning - I feel drained, my chest feels very tight, sandpaper in my eyes... I am considering taking the day off sick but I know I won't. At least I think I won't.<br /><br />I've picked up the prints for the exhibition and boy am I pleased with them - particularly the hugh 30x40 prints. I'm going to get one more 30x40 print done for the exhibition simply because I've fallen in love with that format. Unfurling them the first time at Fitzgeralds and seeing the colours and the intensity of the B&amp;Ws spread large was breathtaking.<br /><br />It's Mac's b'day this Sunday - 5th Nov - and we're going to the Belgian for lunch and to partake of some Belgian Beer. I am looking forward to it, though I have to be careful of my ballooning weight issue. 94kg yesterday on the scales. Very scary and upsetting. I've since changed memberships to the Riverton Leisureplex, which is a better facility than the LRC but I do miss the smaller, community feel of the LRC (where almost everybody knew your name :-) ).<br /><br />It's my b'day next Saturday - 11th - and I've opted to have a night out with dinner and drinks at the Como instead of having somethng here (due to the huge amount of preparation and cleaning up after that is required when you host a bbq at your house). It effing freaks me out to think that I will turn 36 then. That is _so old_. It's the age where men already have teenage children, have been twice divorced, have been married for 10 years, are keeping mistresses on the side, are juggling&nbsp;several mortgages and debts that include&nbsp;a boat and&nbsp;a holiday home, are wickedly successful and on the top of the corporate ladder, have taken up kite-surfing or other extreme sports, drive fast cars, date fast women in red slip dresses, are losing their hair etc etc. And all I have to show for turning 36 is a house, a cat and a housemate and a certain level of smug contentment derived from having lost my ambition a few years ago. Thing is, I'm not even sure if that's a good thing. Perhaps I should be having that fast car, should be scuba diving or kite-surfing, and that other mortgage. I mean, I'm on the 40 side of my 30s after all. I should become more responsible.<br /><br />Mac seems to have settled in well here - he officially separated from KT two Sundays ago but contacted her yesterday to find out if there was still a chance they could get together. Her answer was 'no' and he was a bit upset by it. But things like that, in time, will resolve.<br /><br />Mac, Pete and I went to watch <em>Children of Men</em> yesterday. The vision of the near future it presents is realistic and awfully bleak. What impressed me the most was how fully realised this setting was in the film - the level of detail in which Alfonso Cuaron (<em>Y Tu Mama Tambien</em> and <em>HP and the Prisoner of Azkaban</em>) has infused in this futuristic setting made it seem so authentic and familiar. The one take action sequence at the end, as Theo (played by Clive Owen) weaves his way through a skirmish between the British armed forces and the Resistance, dodging bullets and mortars was powerfully jarring and nerve-wracking. So many memorable scenes play out quietly in this film - the concentration-camp like conditions of the refugee camps, the birth of Kia's daughter, the way people die when they are shot... I was quite shaken by the awful, awesome visuality (if there is such a word) of it all. And the worst thing is that this 'vision of the future' that the film presents, is a logical extension of our present, if we continue with our policies and actions that are fuelled by xenophobia and paranoia, if our governments continue to use fear to manage and maintain the status quo in the population, if we continue to allow such governments to be elected and re-elected because we are so focused on our own well-being by excluding an awareness of greater humanity. Perhaps we do deserve&nbsp;to become extinct, if we have become so inward looking.<br /><br />Oh, the&nbsp;kitty cat is outside my window - he wants to come in."

"event","I seem to have contracted a throat bug. That and my hayfever = unpleasantness. Ugh. So, I am having a sick day at home today and will try and catch up with preparing the photos for printing for the exhibition.

Mr Mac cooked dinner last night and I was most impressed with the spinach ravioli and chicken and bacon parcels. Also wine. Sweet, sweet unwooded chardonnay, chilled. Hmm.. maybe that was the cause of my ailment? I think Mac is going to bring the doggies this weekend. Which should make for an interesting event. I hope the kitty will make friends with the doggies.

I've been grappling with my ego lately, trying hard to keep it under check so that I do not get angry and frustrated by events and incidents that challenge my autonomy and independence, and continue striving to be ego-less. What a difficult and terrible journey.

It's odd but I thought I would want to hang on to the feeling/sentiments of the Greek trip for much longer and would pine for it, but now, I pretty much don't care. It feels as if it's something that has happened, was fun while it lasted, but now on to the next thing. Is this jadedness or maturity? You decide! Perhaps the trip just wasn't significant enough for me as a bit of a self-growth episode?

Oh, how we navel gaze when we feel unwell.

"event","Well, the week just gone has to be one of the longest working week I've endured. I suspect it has much to do with making the physical and mental shifts back to a 9-5, 5 days a week schedule. I shouldn't complain given that Mr Mac pulls longer hours, works on Saturday, and has longer travelling time to and from work.

All seems to be settling well in the house-mate household. At present, I am very much enjoying having Guy Mac here and was myself surprised by how easily I have made the transition from single living to living with a house mate. I've even started enjoying cooking again - goes with having an audience I suspect (such a egoist, me!).

The Minolta SRT-101 that Pete gave me is finally operational. I purchased a battery and ISO400 Sensia film, installed them and after a bit of fiddling and head-scratching (I had inadvertently set the self-timer which prevented the film advance lever from functioning), it's now working. Took a self-portrait today and I intend to use it tomorrow, along with the EOS300 SLR, also loaded with slide film (not sure which as it came with the film pre-loaded when I bought it from Guy Mac). I'm also thinking of upgrading my DSLR to either the Nikon D200 or the Canon 5D - my decision is not yet made as I'll need to work out the overall costs of each upgrade. Dave A is interested in buying my 350D so I've lent it to him to test out and see if he'd like to buy it.

Tonight is dinner at Shem and Jazzy's, and tomorrow will be breakfast in Freo, followed by a hopefully lazy Sunday.

I feel buzzed again!"

"event","My first weekend back in Perth has come and gone. Time flies when you're back in the 'real world' (as opposed to that strange time-warping bubble one inhabits when one is travelling overseas).

The weekend was pretty packed - packed being the operative term as I helped Guy Mac pack his things and move them over to my place. He officially 'moved in' as my house mate yesterday, after multiple trips between his old place and mine, ably assisted by his mates Roberto and Stephan. On a personal level, I'm glad to have a house mate once more and had forgotten how enjoyable it is to have someone to talk to in the evening and in the morning; just having company to break the silences and tedium (which I don't mind, but having company is more fun). At the moment, there is a comfortable mess in my place (comfortable as in: it's messy but still looks comfortable) with boxes, clothes baskets, plastic bags and the like strewn around the family room and thereabouts. I told Mac that he could use my 'studio' as his computer area if he wanted to as it was a bit of a wasted space, but he may well just set up his desk in his room. I joked that he could then 'WinTools' in private. :-) Ahem.

Also caught up with Jacqui, and went for family dinner at Ramon's at Willow Ponds on Saturday night for HSB's b'day. The place was quite nice; the food very ordinary. The 'crab spaghetti' I had was very bland and one could hardly taste the crab. Perhaps my tastebuds have been spoiled by rich Greek/Cretan food?

When I close my eyes and think hard, I can visualise specific scenes as I saw them in my trip in Greece. Simple, mundane scenes eg. crossing the road in Iraklio, just before the old Venetian arsenal. It is wonderful to be able to do that."

"event","Well, back from Greece and back to work, and fighting off one of the worst cases of jet lag I've experienced (which is surpassed only by the awful bug I contracted when I arrived in London back in '02). What surprised me most was that I faithfully kept a travel journal of my 3+ weeks in Greece. I won't include the details here, but it will be a treasured memento of my time there. I even managed to get 4 photos up on my Flickr account tonight.

Now, on to some updates. Firstly, it looks like I am getting a housemate. Whilst I was away travelling through Greece, Guy Mac, who must have undergone a truly awful year this year (annus horriblis), split from his fiancee/partner. The upshot is that he will be moving in here as a lodger/housemate. And down the track, he will bring the two daschunds over (currently they are at his folks in Albany) - I wonder (and worry somewhat) about how the kitty will deal with two daschunds but that is a bridge we will cross when it happens. We spoke about it and I told Mac that it may be an idea for him to move in first, test the waters and if it all feels ok, then he can bring the dogs over. Just in case it doesn't work out as living at my place puts him a long distance from his work (40-50 mins drive). Anyway, it looks like Guy Mac's move will be in a few gradual phases - he brought over some of his stuff tonight, and will bring more this weekend.

Secondly, another photographer mate, Sckwish, has split from his partner. It must be a season for splits. Funny how these things happen while you're away. The 3+ weeks felt like 2 months or more (wondrous) which is why it doesn't feel so odd to me that so many dramatic things have happened in so short a time as it feels as though more time has passed since I left Perth for Greece.

I'm going to take it easy this weekend and try to shake off this jet lag. I turned down an offer to do a photo shoot for the Chihuahua Association of WA at tomorrow's Royal Show dog show as I think it may be nice to sleep in (I doubt I'll go to the pool tomorrow either). It's also HSB's b'day dinner this weekend, so will be nice to catch up. And lunch with Jac and Dave on Sunday for Jac's 29th b'day.

I'm also thinking of having a dinner over here next weekend and trying out a few Cretan recipes. Any excuse to put on the cheesy Greek bouzouki music and to crack open the bottle of Ouzo I purchased from Brettos in the Plaka!"

Steve Irwin, the much vaunted 'Crocodile Hunter' himself died at the pointed end of a sting ray's tail earlier this week while snorkelling off the Low Islaes in North Queensland; and Peter Brock lost his life yesterday when the car he was driving in the Targa Rally, here in Gidgegannup in Perth, crashed into a tree. Two iconic Australian figures gone while doing that for which they are most renowned. Rest in peace, fellas.<br /><br />I woke up this morning with the realisation that I had yet to pack my shorts and bathers (!). Well, that was soon rectified. Now, it is off to the pool for a swim (and to assuage the guilt felt from yesterday's excess consumption of calories), then Owen's Christening today - which will be good (though more calories at the Christening Luncheon), and then family time until I head to the airport. I felt good about this trip for the first time this morning as I thought about wandering the Plaka, perhaps taking a trip to Cape Sounian...<br /><br />Well, this will probably be it for the nonce.

"event","Got on the scales today prior to my Greek trip. 92.6kg. Not happy Jan! I have been very remiss in my weight-watching over the last month - way too much socialising with the photography gang means that I don't keep as close an eye on what I eat or drink. And last night's gathering at Fibber McGee's with the Irish sausages and mash... ugh.. and let's not talk about today.<br /><br />I'm about 97% packed. Just the usual toiletries etc. that need to be organised and I should be set. All in all, I'd say less than 12 kgs in the backpack. Pleased as punch. Hopefully, I haven't forgotten anything. Hopefully, all that walking and trekking I'll do in Greece will help me shed the pounds.<br /><br />I must admit that I'm a wee bit nervous about this trip - been a while since I did such a long trip and I find that the nerves are dampening my enthusiasm somewhat. I hope things will change once I'm at the airport and it seems more a reality. At the moment, I am surrounded by too many trappings of my life here in Perth, and feel a small sense of sadness at leaving them if only for a few weeks.<br /><br />On a different note, my photo - <em>Belmont Light</em> - has been selected for exhibition in the City of Belmont's sister city in Japan. A place called Adatchi if I recall correctly. It's a pretty ordinary piece which was why it surprised me when I got the call yesterday telling me it's been selected. I'm still stoked, though.<br /><br />Well, that's it for now, from Perth. I'm going to keep a travel diary during this trip and will transfer them here when I get back. Until then... Andio!"

"event","<p>This trip to Greece, which seemed like a pipe dream but weeks ago, is less than a week away - and I'm nervous as all get out! I have the nagging feeling that I have yet to sort everything out for the trip -- and I haven't, and my first task is to sort out a checklist of the details that need to be actioned/purchased/obtained for this trip. There's still packing to be done too... Argh! I think I will definitely take the Friday off work to make sure I have everything sorted out for this trip. But this is a much-needed trip as, lately, I've felt as if things are feeling too much of a rigmarole - so this change will help me get my mind off work and the usual day-to-day stuff. And when I'm back, I shall be in a better frame of mind for work and for handling.., the garden! :-)<br /><br />This has been a pretty full-on weekend though. So much for winding down before my trip. Spent most of yesterday out with Guy Mac - we went to GG's exhibition at UWA, then Mac wanted to get a red filter so we wandered around the camera stores in Perth a bit, had lunch, went to Hillarys in the afternoon for an evening 'shoot. I picked up my entries for the City fo Belmont Art Awards - where Veronica recognised me again (what wonderful people they have staffing that exhibition). This morning, I covered the last winter swim for the Trigg Blue Hole Club; there was an after-swim presentation and Brian Carthew gave a speech, part of which acknowledged me as the ""accidental photographer"". Nice! They even set the photos taken on a slideshow streamed through the TV sets in the surf club common room.<br /><br />My entry in the City of Melville Art Awards did not sell. I've put the photo up at the APs place - when looking at it again, I think that the colours are a little muddy. I must confess that I entertained some hope that the photograph might have sold. I guess we all do.<br /><br />This week will be focused on getting the smaller, more detailed tasks completed in preparation for the trip. Fun!</p>"

"event","It appears that I have had the blogger's block. Or rather, I've had a very busy week and weekend. This weekend has seen me away from home for more than 24 hours. Seriously! I left home yesterday at about 9am to drop off my entry for the Melvile City Art Awards... and I've only returned home today circa 1.30pm. But this should be the last of the crazy weekends and I should settle back into some semblance of normalcy this week.&nbsp;I hope.

What's happened in the last week. The most upsetting thing that has occured is that Mac lost his job after only 1 week in the new position. It was very sudden and abrupt, and a clear indication of what&nbsp;a bastard employer Vivid-Design is, especially given how taken he was with the job. He called me on Monday after work, which I first thought was just a social, catch-up call, until I heard his voice quavering on the other end of the phone. He was very upset, so I drove up to his place and stayed with him until Kt came back from work. On Wednesday, I spent the day with Mac helping him finish a freelance project so that he could get paid for it - and hence have some income to cover the next few weeks. I've asked him to consider free-lancing for the time being, until he builds up enough experience and familiarity with the application and processes that can make him more efficient as a designer/developer. We finished the site on Wednesday (I took the day off work to help him out), and we talked about a road map forward to cover the next month or so. I think it should be ok. There is quite a bit of potential in the work that he has lined up as a free lancer and we talked about ways of marketing himself to get continued work from his existing clients.

Also dropped off my entries to the Belmont City Art awards on Thursday night - at Belmont Shopping Centre. That was a weird place - never have I felt so much a fish out of water. There's a certain element in Belmont that hinted at violence -- not sure if it's something I imagined, but I didn't feel very comfortable walking around the mall. I also got my framed print back - what a beauty it is and I really hope it sells at the Melville Art Awards Exhibition. I've also decided to put in for the Red Lens competition - and sent three images for printing at Fitzgerald's on Saturday.

Spent most of Saturday hanging with Mac and Nath - going to the PCP and Breadbox to check out the photography exhibitions there, and felt quite heartened by what we saw. Had dinner at S and J's last night - it was good fun; Oz and T were invited too, and it all started to get a bit overwhelming - Oz has this very overpowering way of communication that tends to make me want to switch off. It's difficult to put my finger on it, but I think it's a combination of the way he takes over a conversation, or makes points or statements that sound like demands. I ended up sleeping over in the spare room at S and J's as I was dog-tired, and had a fitful night's sleep.

Today was pretty much spent covering&nbsp;the Blue Holes Club swim at Trigg Beach, and then doing a 'shoot there with S and J, followed by Lunch at the Trigg Island Cafe on the beach front. Largest plate of grilled calamari I have ever had. Then it was home to do a few paltry chores - the clothes are washed; the dishes aren't; I still need to clear the mess from the dining table from when I prepared the final bits for the Under H20 exhibition at the LRC.

Speaking of which, the Under H20 portraits are up and despite my initial reservations about their going up in the noticeboard area, I think they work well. I believe a few PIPpers will drop in to have a look. I know that Oz and T already have.

That pretty much brings us to the present. Tomorrow evening's the opening ceremony/presentation of the Belmont City Art Awards at Belmont SC. Then I'll have to get the prints for Red Lens posted to Charles Sturt University... then it's pretty much over and I can focus on getting organised for Greece. Sometimes, it feels like I'm on the last leg of my journey to chuck the Ring of Power into Mt Doom... and that I will soon emerge uttering, like Frodo: ""It's gone. It's done.""

Phew."

"event","Census night tonight - it made for quite an interesting exercise. I'd forgotten that we had completed a census back in 2001 - also with the option of having the details released in 99 years. Interesting development - I have now listed myself as 'Buddhist' in this census.<br /><br />Well, Guy's having fun in his new job - and I'm glad for him. I received the following SMS from him at about 10.30 am yesterday:<br /><br />""I cannot express my happiness at the moment. It's like I'm in a dream job.""<br /><br />Good for you, Mr. Mac.<br /><br />I prepared a print for the Melville Art comp - brought it on CD to Fitzgerald's today to be printed with Ultrachrome. Fitzgerald's has come onboard as a major sponsor for our exhibition (<a href=""http://www.frompixeltoprint.com"">www.frompixeltoprint.com</a>) with a 50% discount on all printing. Yay.<br /><br />I feel a lot better since Sunday when I was in a foul, foul mood and feeling very frustrated because none of the mounting of the prints for the LRC exhibition was going well. Speaking of which, I still need to speak with Bernadette at the centre to set up an area for the exhibition. Not sure if I want to have a low-key launch -- feels a bit tacky to do it.&nbsp; I'll still need to think about contacting he community papers about it... running a bit short on time. :-)<br /><br />I booked my 3 nights accommodation in Athens at the Student and Travellers' Inn, within the Plaka. It's a dorm but I figure it should be ok as I'll be sleeping mostly on the first night, and then will be out and about on the next couple of days.<br /><br />That's about it for now."

"event","It's been quiet of late in this blog. I've been busy.

A quick catch-up.

1. Guy and I went to the Liquid Images exhibition at Pt Heathcote on Saturday. It was, again, heartening to realise that the work we see hanging on the walls was easily within our achievement.

2. The guys and I are planning a photography exhibition. Thus far, it seems that I'm doing most of the driving (a trifle disappointing as I thought there would be more enthusiasm from them) but it's still early days and I know that ppl like Shem and Nath are busy at the moment. We're still trying to formalise&nbsp; a concept plan for the exhibition.

3. Went to Shem and Jazz's for dinner last night -- Shem made great roast lamb rubs on the rack, with roast vegs that were absolutely ""to die for"".

4. I printed out 8x12s of three photographs for entry in the Royal Show photography competition. Spent today mounting them... I think they look ok, but we'll see how they go. I'll have to post them tomorrow for them to make it in by Wednesday (procrastinating, the thief of time!).

I'll write more later. There's an interesting report on 60 Minutes about the guy who traded his way from a red paper clip to a house."

"event","Israel has gone mad. It is attacking Lebanon - Beirut to be exact; attacking another sovereign nation and ignoring the urging of the UN and other nations to desist. Typically, Australia, the UK&nbsp;and the US are very quiet about the affair - our tacit support of Israel's unconscionable actions is sickening. Even the news feeds on TV downplay this gross incursion of diplomacy and human rights. Israel claims that it has no choice but to attack Hisbollah installations, as two of its soldiers have been captured by Hisbollah, but the reality of it is that Israel has targetted civilian communities (how else can you explain the gross number of civilian casualties?). Worse of all, front page news on The West today wasn't about this act of gross and outright terrorism by Israel, nor of the human tragedy that it has caused. No: instead, we are treated to a front page article on how this conflict will raise the price of fuel to $1.70 a litre in a few weeks. Our national apathy is gut churningly awful. It makes me want to run out and slap some sense into people: stop thinking about yourself and the preservation of your comfortable lifestyle for once, for fuck's sakes!<br /><br />On another note, I went to the <em>Murmurs</em> photography exhibition at the Freo Arts Centre with Guy Mac, Nath and Suz. There was a real variety of photographs of Paris taken by Australian photographers; after this, we hung around Freo - went for gelati, then a beer at Rosie's. All in all, an enjoyable day out with the trio. I had done a photo shoot at Burswood Park in the morning with Guy, which was ok (not the best location as there was somewhat of a sameness in the landscape). It looks like Nathan and I will be photographing Rob and Sarah's (Guy's sister and brother in law to be) wedding in November. Nathan swore that he wouldn't do it unless I was going to be photographer too - I think having two photogs will make things less stressful.<br /><br />Oh, and I am definitely Greece-bound: have booked my flight to Athens - departing on 9th Sept, arriving 10th Sept in Athens. About 3 days in Athens, then flying to Iraklio (Heraklion) in Crete. Thus far, my plans are: Perth - Athens - Crete - Amoragos - Santorini - Athens - Perth, all in 3 weeks."

"event","<p>It started raining last night.</p>
<p>I'd left the clothes on the line - overnight.</p>
<p>Never mind. Hopefully, it'll fine up again today and the clothes will get an opportunity to dry.</p>
<p>Lately, I've been thinking about what's important to me -- those things that I most value and without which I would be very lost. And I realised that when it comes down to the crunch, things like photography don't matter at all. I could happily go on without it. My feeling restless about my 'art', my feeling a bit flat and uncreative -- in the long run, these measure up to nil as far as importance goes.<br /><br />I caught up with Andy-wan on Friday night and enjoyed listening to him telling me about his experiences in the US during his 3 weeks holiday there. In that, I realised that what I would like to do is to gradually get to know a new place by spending about a week there - as I had sort of done with Naxos back in '02. I think I will buy a Lonely Planet Guide to Greece to start me on my planning my trip there. </p>"

"event","Ok, that's it. I'm going to take a small break from photography. I just can't get excited about it at the moment.

Having said that, the PIP meet at Little Creatures yesterday was fantastic. 20 people. Lots of socialising. Loved almost every moment of it. I felt completely stimulated by the interaction. Now, I know I'm generally a quiet person and ""me time"" is important, but, wow, it was fantastic.

A funny day at work. Well, not funny, really. More run of the mill. For some odd reason, the phones kept ringing at lunchtime with interests and prospects. Hm...&nbsp;

GuyMac went for his Vivid Design interview today. I chatted to him this evening and he said it went ok. Fingers crossed, it will work out.

I like writing these short sentences.

Tomorrow, I'm photographing the lawyers and their team at KSR. Should be fun. Wish I could be more enthused about it, but the pressure to perform is a tad scary. Well, we'll see how it goes.

Oh yeah, I am backing up my computer. Who would've thought it would take so long. I may have to leave the PC on overnight until the backup is complete. Geeze.

I've been thinking a bit more about my issue now. Not as much. I have no effing idea how to resolve it. I don't think there is a way to solve it. I think it's just a case of not doing anything and seeing what happens, which isn't an easy thing.

Still haven't decided if I should see the allergist though. I called the health insurance fund today to find out if I'd be covered but the strange guy at the other end of the 'phone told me that I would only be covered if I were hospitalised, and that a visit to an allergist should be covered by Medicare. I wonder if Medicare would cover consultations with allergy specialists or if they would deep this as being a flippant thing in comparison to, say, life-threatening injuries.&nbsp;

I still can't decide if I should go to Greece. I've started thinking that perhaps I should just head down south in September for a couple of weeks - get all the way to Denmark maybe. What do you think? For some odd reason, escaping to another country just doesn't hold the same appeal.

Should I go to Greece?

Call 11602 if you think I should.
Call 11603 if you think I shouldn't.

Ok, outta here."

"event","I'm feeling a bit down because about 1 hour ago, I got a call from GuyMac who told me that he's just lost his job. They decided not to continue with his employment at the end of his 3 month probation. Guy said that he has never failed in anything in the past before and this feels as if he's failed. What do you do? What can you do? I feel a bit helpless at the moment. Don't know why I get affected like that by things that happen to other people.

Not like there's anything I can do to change the situation.

I hope he does well in the interview on Monday.

Why can't my luck rub off on my friends?

Share the luck,

Share the well being."

"event","I can't believe that I'm still sick. It's been almost a week, given that I've traced the onset of this cold to since last Thursday. Big sigh.

Wasn't firing on all cylinders at work yesterday. In fact, just after lunch, it was a struggle to keep up. I gave up and just did mundane, mindless work. I'll go in today but it my condition doesn't improve, I'm going to take half a days sickie.

I'm not sure what more I can do save capitulate and get the prescribed antibiotics, which even the GP recommended against.

Let me list my ailments:

- lethargy
- slight headache
- cold
- sore throat
- unpleasant expectoration
- drowsiness
- hot/cold flushes
- cold extremities

If this ain't the flu, I don't know what is!!!!!"

"event","I had a dream last night. I was somewhere with Dave and Jac and Dave asked Jac to go to the coast to get some ice-cream. I decided to follow her. As we went down the slope that ran by the cliff side to the coast, I noticed that the light that fell on Jac's face turned her eyes a crystalline blue. So, I asked if she would pose for a photo. I took the shot, zooming in to frame her incredibly icy eyes, and noticed that the shutter closed with an odd clunk. When I previewed the image, I noticed that it was actually a wider shot than the closer frame that I had used via the zoom. Later, I wasn't able to take any more photos with the camera and I heard a rattling sound coming from within. I removed the lens, to discover that the mirror had come off. Panicking, I tried to slip it back in, being very careful not to touch the sensor; but the bloody thing began to crumble in my fingers. Before I knew, it the interior of my camera had turned into something of the consistency of wet sand.

By this stage, Jac had hurried off to get the ice-cream leaving me stumbling down the steps to the beach with the broken camera. I knew it was still under warranty and I could send it to be fixed, but the thought of being without my cam for weeks on end was quite distressing. Then, up the steps came two women I knew in the dream (but not in real life) -- I tried explaining my predicament to them, and they were sympathetic. By this stage, I was almost beside myself with distress at the state of my camera.

Then, I woke up and realised, with tremendous relief, that it was only a dream.

I wonder what part of my subconscious was working overtime with this dream. :-o"

"event","I'll be taking another sickie today. Feeling very unwell. 2 sickies in a row and after a weekend to boot. How can I live with myself?? :-o<br /><br />But, the reality is that my nose and throat are clogged up and I feel drowsy most times, so it's definitely the 'flu. On the plus side, I don't have a fever, for which I am most thankful.<br /><br />I went to get some Codral from the local pharmacy yesterday, and found out that due to recent changes in legislation, all pharmacists are now keeping a register of purchases of medication with pseudo-ephadrine, which meant them committing my contact details and driver's licence number to a database. Then, when I went to the Post Office to send the disposable cam to the next fotomodachi, I discovered that all non-document packages sent overseas needed to have the sender's personal details committed to a database, because of new anti-terrorism legislation. Twice in one day, I've had to provide my contact and personal details for entry into a database. If this isn't cause for concern, I don't know what is. How did the government manage to put through legislation where our information has suddenly become so easily collectible? Whatever happened to right to privacy? No doubt, there are arguments that could be put forward to back up this kind of data collection eg. preventing abuse of over-the-counter medication, but it was certainly a very odd experience to have to render my personal information over to a database twice in one morning! It was enough to get me thinking along slightly paranoid lines.<br /><br />Also watched&nbsp;3 eps of Season 2 of BSG yesterday - was good, but I kept drifting to sleep as I had the heater on and was curled up on the couch. Today, I think I will get a couple of new release DVDs and watch them eg. <em>The Constant Gardener</em> which I have been meaning to watch for some time.<br /><br />On the plus side, my landscape photographs in FlickR seem to be getting some air time - a handful of them have made Explore, and one shot of waves caught in long exposure crashing against rocks seems to have amassed nearly 900 views. It is quite ironic as landscape isn't really my thing as far as photography goes, though I'm starting to really enjoy the dawn and evening jaunts, and getting excited when I realise that I have caught the right moment, be it light or motion.<br /><br />Ok, enough for today. Back to your scheduled programming."

"event","After the evening shoot at Mettam's Pool with Nath and GuyMac (who is now the proud owner of a Nikon D70s), I went to see baby Ashley Kingston with Dave and Jac. It's amazing to see how comfortable Xtie is with the baby - having had Saf, I think she's more confident and at ease with bringing up baby. It was funny to hear her talk about Anthony's early uneasiness with handling the baby as Ashley is his first. I got to cradle baby Kingston in my arms - he slept for most of it until he woke after making a deposit in his nappy, while still in my arms (!) He's surprisingly heavy for a little feller, and looks remarkably like a cross between Anthony and the Laughing Buddha.

It's also good to see GuyMac so happy with his new D70s. The sunset at Mettam's was breath-taking and the image of Guy perched on the rocks, silhouetted against a fiery red sky will remain in my memory for a long while. Of course, I also have a couple of photographs of that but being there and seeing that magnificent sky blazing in all that colour is really a once-off. Reminds me of that time I was at Naxos, and I walked up to the Portara and sat there looking at the sunset behind the outer islands. No words can describe the elation. I think Guy expressed it best when he raised his arms and whooped out loud.

The kind of sunset that grabs hold of you body and soul.

I have a fair few jobs to do around the house today - clean the bathrooms, vacuum the carpets, tidy things up. I think once I get the place into some kind of order, I will begin feeling a bit more settled after the hectic last couple of weeks.

I also need to reconnect with Matt and Michelle - to see if they are able to come to dinner next Saturday."

"event","Work today wasn't too bad, despite my having a head cold. Admittedly, I was almost nodding off as I drove there - having a head cold makes me drowsy.<br /><br />At work today, I had a nice Skype chat with my mate, Guy Mac, who said some nice things about me, that made my day. Thanks Mr Mac.<br /><br />It is so cold tonight. I had the heater on while I caught up with the current episode of <em>Lost</em> - then I decided to come here and go online. And it's so cold. Definitely a night for the electric blanket.<br /><br />I was going to get some ISO800 film to do underwater portraits tomorrow but would you believe that none of the photo-processing stores in and around Cottesloe's main strip stocked it? So, I will just spend the weekend planning how to approach more formal underwater portraiture."

"event","In the last hour, I have been feeling progressively ill. I'm shivering and no amount of jumpers will stop the chill. My nose is now completely blocked and my eyes feel as if they're about to dribble out of my sockets. My ears are freezing. I have no feeling in my toes. I don't want to go to work, but I have to or I'll feel bad. I don't know why."

"event","It appears that I have caught a mild cold. Well, that's a self-diagnosis anyway: my nose is blocked, throat is sore and I feel as though there is a mild build up of pressure in my head.

The people I hang out with in the PIP FlickR group are an interesting bunch. There is a very strong distinction in the culture within the group, between the urbane urbanites -&nbsp;those in more comfortable circumstances financially and career-wise, who typify all that is chic about inner-city living - and the country boys from Albany, who are in transition, lifestyle and career-wise, and who must deal with the more pressing urgencies of work, partners, budgets and so on. Personally, I prefer hanging out with the latter, perhaps because they are quieter and their outlook in life more closely reflects mine. What impresses me also is their&nbsp;terrific commitment&nbsp;to their partners; they speak of their partners with a great deal of openess, respect&nbsp;and affection. They are closer to my age (in their early 30s) and are probably going through the same life decisions that I went through at that age too. The urbanites are a more mixedgroup age-wise (at 35, I'm the eldest; the younger members are around 21-24), and I think this is what fuels the hedonism that permeates the group culture. There are also a couple of strong personalities in this group which, coupled with solid finances and the greater feeling of freedom and autonomy that comes with it, certainly gives this group a bit more buzz that can be both attractive and exhausting.

I started taking underwater portraits on Wednesday, after receiving my Vivitar Cruise Cam (underwater point and shoot camera) on Tuesday. It was a real challenge to frame the shots underwater, and about 50% of the shots went to waste. I was also a little disappointed in the lack of clarity, though this may be due to my being unused to having to position myself at least 1.5 metres away from the subject. Still, it occassioned much hilarity amongst the early morning swimmers, particularly Liz and the 2 Pams, though they were sporting enough to pose for a few shots. Terry also posed for a couple of shots, and I wanted to get one of Italia, but she must have drifted out partly out of frame. I'm going to think more carefully about how I should take photographs under water and will try and organise a more 'formal' series of underwater portraits next week. I'm going to use Kodak 800 film though as I suspect that the lack of clarity from the first 'shoot was due to film slowness (Kodak 400).

This weekend promises to be interesting and enjoyable - what with Xtie, Anthony, Safe and Ashley down from Goomaling (I'll be visiting tomorrow night), and 2 'shoots - one at sunset at Mettam's Pool, the other a late afternoon shoot at Fremantle Harbour. I'll have to fit in cleaning the house in between. And also possible catching up with Matt and Michelle - at the very least, a phone call to see if they are able to come over for a BBQ on Saturday next week."

"event","Long weekend... wherefore art thou long weekend?

How can three days fly by so quickly and unceremoniously?

Still, it was a chock full weekend - I took time to enjoy 'me time' now that AM and family have flown back to Malaysia. I was supposed to have a bbq on Saturday night for Tony and family, but Tony called on Friday to say that Jen had been admitted for surgery due to some damage to her shoulder and tendons from the accident. They've only just discovered the damage as her specialist called for an MRI scan during her last check up. She's back home now but her right arm is in a sling.

Went on a dawn shoot with GuyMac on Sunday morning - we decided to head to Mettam's Pool in North Perth. It was cold, but I enjoyed being outdoors in the early hours this time, though I must have still been half-asleep as I had a couple of near misses while driving there. I had a couple of good shots, but still think that the photographs look a bit flat. Poor Guy must think that I'm a bad driver! Guy wore glasses on Sunday - I didn't even know that he usually wore contacts; turned out that he was born with cataracts and had his lens removed when he was 11, so has always worn very powerful glasses and/or contacts since.

Cocktail at the Bisluk's on Sunday night. Had a Singapore Sling, which was very nice (and sweet), followed by margheritas courtesy of Scroop, and a few other concoctions, one of which include absinthe and a chocolate block (!), and another which Brendan made. I think I got quite merry that night. A couple of Shem's workmates from WestNet came but for some reason I didn't talk much with them - now feel a bit bad about it as I usually make a point to speak with people. Perhaps I was just feeling a bit flat that evening until the alcohol kicked in, and by then, I was pretty much yammering away with Brendan and Dannielle.

I think I'm getting a bit addicted to the Perth FlickR socials. :-)

Today, Tony came with the trailer and we went to pick up the clothes rack from Jac and Dave's. It's now in the guest room and looks mighty fine - it's a good contraption, as it has a rail for you to hang your clothes as well as racks for t-shirts, towels etc. Tony helped me clear the patio area of the stuff we moved there to clear the garage for Gil's digging machine (did I mention I had about $1500 worth of drainage work done to the backyard???? Sigh...), then we picked the oranges from the tree - about 3 bags full. Who'd have thought one little tree could yield so many oranges?

I also caught up with eps of &lt;i&gt;Lost&lt;/i&gt; from the last couple of weeks&nbsp;- couldn't watch them due to the rellies visiting and occupying most of my time.

And, as I fear that this entry is becoming very prosaic, I thought I'd finish with the following: Secrets are very difficult to keep."

"event","Urgh. 2 kilos gained in less than a week. :-( A consequence of too much eating out and a family dinner almost every night since AM, UD and E arrived in Perth. After tomorrow, it'll have to be a lean and mean diet again.

In other news:
- My mate, Guy Mac, cut his hand badly while cutting bones up for his dogs. Sliced into his knuckles and cut into his tendons. He said that his tendons were visible. Yuck. He spent&nbsp;6 hours in emergency at Charlie Gairdner Hospital waiting for it to be seen to.
- I took UD and E to Rottnest yesterday. All in all, we rode for about 10 kilometres. Even though we were only 4 hours on the island, I was so tired at the end of it. And it was very cold. I had three layers on and was still shivering. E and UD seemed unaffected by the cold.
- Interestingly, AM is very protective of UD and E. I understand about E as he is their only child and I think she is protective of UD since his health scare a couple of years back.
- Other places I took the visiting rellies: Caversham Wildlife Park, Whiteman Park and Mundaring Weir.
- I won the bid on the Vivitar Cruise underwater camera, so I'll have to start kicking this underwater project into gear soon.
- 2 more days until the long weekend.
- Cocktails at Shem and Jazz's this weekend.
- Having the Sinagras over for a BBQ - will have&nbsp;to make this Saturday as the cocktail has been shifted to Sunday.

That's about it for now. Ciao!"

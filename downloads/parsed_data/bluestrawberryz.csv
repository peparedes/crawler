HOLD YOU DOWN:::

Now you been holding me down mm 
For such a long time now 
From back then to now in my story 
Straight from the hood 
You've always been there for me 

And you had my back when they 
Back when everybody said I wasn't anything 
It was you that kept me holding on 
No matter what was going on 
So whatever you need I got you yaa 

 
Reminiscing that 6 train from way back 
Now it's skyblue Phantoms and stretch Maybacks 
For sweepin them floors in them Bronx apartments 
Mira esta que ta on the red carpet 
When Pun died you was the first to call me 
I never told you 
But you was there for me 
Whatever you need, I be there for you 
Crack, I got ya back, for real, true story 

 
Now my loyalty will always be 
With you if you just promise me 
That you'll stay real just like you are 
Cuz baby you don't have to change no... 

You dont know how much you mean to me 
Whenever your down you know that you can lean on me 
No matter the situation, boy I'm gon' hold you down 

You dont know how much you mean to me 
Whenever your down you know that you can lean on me 
No matter the situation, girl I'm gon' hold you down 


Yo, 2005, Rakim and Jodey Withley 
Watch me paint a picture so perfect 
Quite possibly 
The realest frechest from BX to Southbeach 
I'mma always hold you down, girl 
You can count on me 

 
So remember this whenever I call 
We go back too far, we been through it all 
Even though, we haven't spoken so long 
Ain't nothing change, not a damn thing baby 



Now my loyalty will always be 
With you if you just promise me 
That you'll stay real just like you are 
Cuz baby you don't have to change no... 


You dont know how much you mean to me 
Whenever your down you know that you can lean on me 
No matter the situation, boy I'm gon' hold you down 

You dont know how much you mean to me 
Whenever your down you know that you can lean on me 
No matter the situation, girl I'm gon' hold you down 


Like green is to autum somethings must stay
This industry 
Yeah my father made me this way 
Get between me and J-Lo 
I simply stay 
you better off sweepin leaves on a windy day 

 
So I don't care about the situation 
I'ma ride for you 
If there's a complication 
Cuz everytime you had my back and all 
When we were young 
And now you're Joey Crack and all 


Now my loyalty will always be 
With you if you just promise me 
That you'll stay real just like you are 
Cuz baby you don't have to change because... 


You dont know how much you mean to me 
Whenever your down you know that you can lean on me 
No matter the situation, boy I'm gon' hold you down 

You dont know how much you mean to me 
Whenever your down you know that you can lean on me 
No matter the situation, girl I'm gon' hold you down 


You dont know how much you mean to me 
Whenever your down you know that you can lean on me 
No matter the situation, I'm gon' hold you down 

You dont know how much you mean to me 
Whenever your down you know that you can lean on me 
No matter the situation, 'Im gon' hold you down"

Still leaving the house you built for us all and your favorite car with the top down and your bmw hat on in the middle of december, working your ass off fourteen hours a day to get us all everything we needed in life and trying to get everything we ever wanted- you did a great job. Always taking the hardest things in life and handling them for everyone you knew. It will all be a big fish ending, I kind of felt like this was going to happen as soon as I saw that movie. Everyone will be there, everyone I know it. Mom and I decided to keep you in the house, we figured you always wanted to be close to the place you always loved so much. I'll do my best at everything I do, and you'll see, you'll see me - I'll be something and try to do everything you have done and would have done if you could. I'll miss you dad.

I've suspected for some time now that my girlfriend has been having an affair. The usual signs. Phone rings, I answer, someone hangs up. She started going out 'with the girls' a lot recently although when I ask which girls it is always ""Just some friends from work, you don't know them"". I always look out for her taxi coming home but she always walks down the drive although I can hear a car setting off. As if she has got out of the car round the corner. Why? Is it not a taxi? I once picked her mobile up just to see what time it was and she went beserk and screamed that I should never touch her phone again and why was I checking up on her.

Anyway, I have never approached the subject with my g/f. I think deep down I just didn't want to know the truth but last night she went out again and I decided to check on her. I decided I was going to hide behind my car which would give me a view of the whole street so I could see which car she gets out of. It was whilst crouched behind my car that I noticed rust around my rear wheel arch.

Should I take it into a body repair shop or should I buy some stuff from the local auto shop and try to repair it myself?

"event","I'm on the ferry on my way home now, its noon. I had a really nice weekend and I'm now putting off all the work I should still be doing for classes tommorow. Tommorows also my birthday , I don't really need any specific celebration this weekend was more than enough for me.

Friday I came home and Devin picked me up at Port Jefferson Ferry and we drove back to her house. After a few hours we left for McDonalds because I have been deprived. At her house I found out I lost 10 pounds since the summer, kinda the reversed freshman 15, so I'm 170lbs. now yay. I probably gained it all back from this weekend. We met up with a bunch of people in town and it was really nice to see everyone. Later some people went to a movie and we just layed around in the car. She fell asleep eventually and I went on a nice drive. Ran into Acid Greg outside of Rosa's around midnight maybe, I love that kid. A few minutes later the motherfucker I had been trying to call all day, Greg Halbart showed up with Nurya. We had some pizza and  then greg helped me get Devin home cause she had work tommorow and was really tierd. I then stayed with Acid Greg and we went a bunch of places but ended up at pizza again around 2:30, where Loren called me after his movie and Andrew, Loren, and me walked to 7-11 from town and bought a bunch of corrona and smerdoff 40's and 24's. It was cold outside so Acid Greg gave me his mexican blanket which was awsome. We drank real fast in the parking lot and then Andrew had to go home at 4 so he called a cab. Loren and me then walked to Mill Dam park on the harbor over there and drank a lot more. By the time we stood up around 4:30 we were drunk as hell. Wandered down the street stumbling laughing our asses off at old times and all the stupid shit we did, walking down Sean's street. He heard us and all of a sudden shows up outside his house with a bunch of Henekins and we go for a walk to the Southdown Church. We sat around in the parking lot there untill like 5:30 ish and then walked back towards Loren's and Sean's. There were so many times when we stopped cause drunk Loren passed out in the middle of the road, so me and sean would each choose a side and take a leak preventing traffic and all cause they'll stop for us, ha. Loren and me got back to his house around 6:20 and completly passed out in his room it was pretty funny. Woke up like noon and Frankie came by, soon after that Greg Halbart came by to pick me up and we went to Long Island Motor works to find out what the deal was with my car and my options, labor charges ect. Turns out we'll be putting the engine in together without their help but Greg, Josh, and me can use the shop to get our acts together and finish the project as fast as possible. I can't wait. Later in the day I played botchie ball? with Devin's dad, sister, and two relatives. It was pretty funny wasnt as boring as I expected it to be. Devin and me then ate at European  Republic and went to the hotel we made reservations with in Holbrook. It was a nice room, we kicked it there untill like 8:00, took a shower, and went out to find a resturaunt to eat at. Found a nice enough place, ate, then found our way back to the hotel room and whatever yea. Fun night got like no sleep damnit. Came to life out of bed around 10, showered quickly, and then drove to Port Jeff so I could catch the 12 ferry. Got there an hour early and had lunch at this little nice place that I also forgot the name of, went to the dog store there then got onto the ferry. I really enjoyed my weekend and I know I'll be back in just five days."

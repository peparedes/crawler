It's just another day in the life of Shane....

I'm glad I remembered this livejoural of mine, it's a way to keep up with ya'll...and to just vent a lil!

My weekend went great.  I got asked on a date by this wonderful guy from Warrensburg...and spent a lot of healthy roomate time.
My roomate is my ""soulmate""; we'll prolly never be together, yet he's the ONE person for me.  I've realized that love may never come my way as a relationship...yet I still have people who truely love me.

I'm waiting on a phone call about a new job.  If I'm hired by the corporation I interviewed with here in KC... I'll be the assistant to the Administrator of the Developement Division of the Missouri Repertory Theatre.... It will be good money and a step forward for me.  If any of you say any type of prayers to any god (or goddesses)... please say one for me today, and this week.

I head home Friday for the holiday and my B'day.  I can't believe I'm gonna be 22 on December 21st.  I'm getting old (kinda like Alicia.... just kidding... hehehehe).

Well I should get to work and look productive...
Everyone should email me and keep in touch!

not cause I have moved to Kansas City, not cause I prolly won't see much of you anymore... just cause I am lonely and I dont much feel at home anywhere anymore...

if I could just leave, and be gone and no more... if it were as simple as some pills or just falling alseep and not waking up ever again, i think I would do it.  i wouldn't even care if I ended up in hell... if there is one...

the only thing that keeps me alive really is my mother and Dan.... and thinking that someday something good will come of this life....

but I am soo sleepy....and maybe if I just laid down I wouldn't have to wake up again.

there's soo much around me but I am soo alone.  I hate myself every day for the past two years of my life.... and yet I still long for love, but I refuse to ever give my heart away like I did to that fucker!
He doesn't even feel remorse.
Should I?

I wish I had someone.... someone that I really cared for... that I could open up to and that would open up for me... but I have to quit thinking that will ever happen or even exists...

I just want to get fucked!  that would make me happy....but then I have the fear of getting something...and that shallow empty feeling always is there afterwards..

I guess I just needed to write and get it off my chest.  I guess I am crazy....its good I can hide this side of me from the world....it's good I don't answer myself when I ask myself questions... at least I know I am stil somewhat sane...

I'm bored with myself now..."

I wish I were, it would be soo much easier to explain my emotioins and why I can not get over him...

I want to lock him in a room and make him kiss me, I want to make love one last time, I want him to hold me and look longingly into my eyes and tell me he is truely over me....  Then I will know I am crazy.  Then I will get over and past him.

How can you even THINK about moving in with someone after only knowing them for like 3 months???
Jason and I had known eachother like 6 months (which is like 3 years in the gay community) before we even started discussing us going to the same school.

THIS IS NOT FAIR...and I am going to cry and whine and pout damnit!  DAMNIT!

My whole gut aches...my head hurts....I can't sleep again at night.

What can I do, what should I do???

What happens if they move in together and they work out...  I will have really lost him, and I will have to move on.  I am soo scared!  I am scared I will never find what Jason and I had in another person.  I am scared that noone will love and appreciate me again.  I am scared to admit that Jason and I didn't work out...

If we could have just talked...  I think if we could just talk now.  But will he listen?  Will he care?  Does he even know what love is???

Anyhow... I know better than to start my day out like this... I should stop worrying about it I suppose...

Someone help me!  What should I say to him?  Should I even say anything.... I truly want a second chance...  but I know how his mind works, and I don't know if he will give it to me!  I don't want to come between he and John....

Maybe it has been seeing you these last few days, being able to touch you, see your smile, talk...  perhaps I am just crazy...  Each day gets harder as I think it should be getting easier.

I can't say that I am jealous, I can't even say that I want to be your bf anymore.  What I can admit is that I love you, with all my heart.  It's soo hard to stand outside the fire.  It's soo hard to see you and not want to reach out and hold you.

I have been thinking about therapy lately.  I have friends that go to the counselor on campus....I hope one of them can help me to move past you...

I was doing soo well, thought I was even happy... until you told me the news tonight.  Of course, it is my own fault cause I dug it out of you...  I guess I just can't believe that you no longer want me, even though you have been dating John for several months now.  But I just can't believe that the two of you might be moving in together this summer....  In the back of my mind, I guess I had a small chance left, but now I feel all hope is gone!  

Maybe I am crazy...  I just felt that lately you might have been showing that you still did care, but now I realize that John is what is on your mind.  

I want to scream and plead and beg for you to come back sometimes... I hurt soo bad right now... you just gave up on us.....  we lived together and then you just gave up.  Are you sure you should even be thinking about John moving in with you?
It is not my business....  I just hope you think it through...

Well, I am glad you will never read this.  I wish we could actually have conversations and talk like this...

I pray for you every night Jason Paul....

I will always be here for you,

First... C, I thought I had a new morning job, so that is why I have not been in class...I hope you will forgive me.  I, however, did not get the job...soo I will see you Friday morning at 9am with Dr. Wink! (ps, I HAVE been reading, soo you don't have to kick me in the bootay!)

Second...Yay for Shane!  I have a date this weekend.  His name is Sean.  We are going on a double date with Jason (yea I do realize I am going on a ""date"" with my ex and his new bf and the guy I potentially like...is that wrong???).

Third...This semester Rocks!  Other than I have to read like EVERY FREAKING DAY...and sometimes like 10 or more chapters, everything esle is cool.
I especailly enjoy my African American History class...and my Conflict Resolution class.  

Fourth (and finaly) Looking for an APARTMENT...  Craig Koppa and I will be moving in together (as friends!!!! ONLY) in March.  I hate searching for a new place.  Anyone know of nice apts in town?  I am thinking Chapel Ridge, I guess they go on your monthly Income.  Craigy poo and I would like to find a townhouse or something nice like that too.  I am very excited about getting out of my lease....cause I am willing to spend up to about $250 (or a little over) a month for a nice place....and I still will be saving about $100 from what I am paying right now in rent...

Well, I guess that catches you all up ehh?

"event","OK, in my last journal entry I in NO WAY meant to hurt anyone...
soo pelase accept my apology.

I can't begin to explain how the last few days have been for me.  Aside from thinking I was getting Jason back and sadly finding out that I was reading much, TOO MUCH into his compliments and friendliness...I also had a dear friend (and someone I only recently realized I love MORE than a friend) attempt suicide!
The last entry was not only because I wanted others to hear it...but because I needed to hear it MYSELF...often I write what I need to hear soo I can read it and take my own advice.

I have been feeling soo sad and lonely right now.  I have been sleeping on the couch almost every night, it's hard to face a lonely bed.  Most of this stems from the realization that Jason will and can no longer be mine.  I have known this for a long time...but have never fully accepted it; I knew he would come back to me.  Soo now that he has a new bf it has gotten harder though...I see soo many things between them that used to be between us.
Jason and I had one of our talks last night..the kind where I break down and cry uncontrollably and he just sits there and talks to me.....
Anyhow, he told me that if I didn't know that he loved me and that nothing has changed since the time we were going out except for the fact that we can't always get along....then I was crazy.  He explained to me that he is just not a touchy feely guy and does not express love in the same way...but that I should recognize and know that he does love me and does care.  He is ALWAYS checking up on me and loves to come over for dinner and watch TV.  See...all this time when I thought he didn't love me or care for me anymore...and was just trying to make me happy....he actually did miss me and care for me, he just couldn't be my lover anymore...
Soo, yes I still feel a little crazy (almost pyshcotic) over loosing him....but I have gained one of the best friends that I think I will ever have...

Soo today world, I am moving on.  NO need to shed another tear of regret....NO need to think about the past, except to smile at the good things that we shared.... NO need to burden him with my recovery; it's coming, slowly but surely.  I can feel myself getting happier every day.  There are a few guys I am talking to...and I have all my friends to keep me company.  I know that as I continue to date my heart will find love and companionship in others and not need to depend on a lost love!

Soo.... I am again sorry for being soo rude...  I just needed to say those things a few days ago.  If anyone is lonely or hurting, don't hesitate to come over or call (this means ALL OF YOU... Al, Nessa, Sara....etc).
I don't care what time of day, in fact, if you all wanted to have a slumber party or something...or to just get away for a night...I always sleep better when I have friends around me!

I love you all soo much, you will never know!
You have let me whine about Jason since I met you all.  You have put up with my flaming and tempor, my retardedness and my need to constantly talk....For that I cheerish you all.

Soo tomorrow starts another day.  Today is my last day as the ""old"" Shane, tomorrow....It's time to get myself motivated again!


Class are going swell...I skipped a few the last few days just soo I could have some time alone.  But this semester I am not going to get in the habit of not attending classes....if I am bummed out I am gonna call some of you to come over and just hang out!  That way I can get it out of my system and go to sleep with a clear mind!

OK, soo this entry has been WAY too long and I am sure NO ONE is even gonna finish it!
Soo I will leave for now...."

yea, I say it all the time...but this time it is for real!

His name is Sean, he is 20 and from Independence.  My friends Kristina and Tiffany set me up with him.  He is Tiffany's best friend from back home.  Anyhow, we met and seemed to hit it off right from the bat, however, neither of us wanted to let on...so we treated eachother like total crap.  Eventually we started to flirt a little and talk nicely to eachother...and by the end of the night on Sunday we were swapping spit.

The exciting part is...he is still a ""butt-virgin"".  This is very nice becuase I won't feel the need or pressure to have sex.  Neither of us want to be tied down...but we want something more than Dating.
Yay!  I am soo excited.  He is gonna come visit me in a few weeks....we have been emailing every day.  And the even more exciting news....HE IS MOVING HERE FOR SCHOOL NEXT YEAR!
Yay for me again!

OK, write more later!"

"event","OK, soo you all will hate me for this one...but I don't hate myself


I cleaned my apt and did all the dishes last night soo Jason could come over and watch the Matthew Shepard movie while I was at class...
Now, I knew he would have his new bf John with him....but I don't think I fully had a grip on how that would affect me.

The first time I walked into my apt to see John snuggling up next to Jason, I almost fell to the floor.  It was like I could have cried, passed out, and thrown up all in one action.

Soo, what did I do...I DRANK...and I drank A LOT!
....But I did open up and get to talk to John and Jason both.

This is pathetic also, but I am very happy for Jason.  John is butcher than I...but he is still effeminite!  He and Jason have the same sick sense of humor that I could never understand...and they both like cars....plus John really seems to respect and love Jason.
It was almost refreshing to see Jason happy, now I know I don't have to be the one to make him smile....but it still hurts to think that I can't be the one, ya know?
The thing that hurt the most was seeing them bond...I realized I am not that person that has the inside jokes now...and not the one Jason looks at or touches when he wants to make a point or tell a story....and what really  hurt is how the both of them laughed at me when I was acting a bit to girly (but I was nervous...and didn't know how else to talk or act, you all understand).

Soo I went out with friends and drownded my sorrows in BIG FISH BOWLS of beer...it made me feel good..and I even met a wonderful,gay,black man at 707 (whom is NOT single)....but I drank soo much I woke up 30 min late for work today...however, Barb is soo cool and very understanding.

He loves me though, I know he does.  If he didn't love me and care about me he would have turned me down when I offered my apt for them to watch MTV...he would not have stuck around and talk to me...he would not have smiled at me and just been jason when I needed him to be.
I can't stop thinking that someone else is cuddling with him at night though...I helped him move in some this last weekend...and when I saw his bed (the bed we made love on and had our first kiss on and the bed we slept in the night he proposed to me) I just cried and cried...he almost held me....Almost!

Well, I have a date this Friday...as you can all tell (and I know it also) I am not ready for it.  I would not call it rebound, I just need to know that there is another guy out there, someplace, who cares for me and is attracted to me while I am attracted to him.
Matthew is from KU.  He is not the type of guy that I ususally find attractive.  He is about my stature but has the most beautiful eyes.  He just broke up with his bf about a month ago...Soo we have both agreed not to be Rebounds of our lost loves...but we have also both agreed not to get too serious too soon...and just have fun cuddling and sharing time!
Niether of us want sex (which is cool) cause niether of us can get over being with our exes....but I have asked him to spend the night soo I have someone to cuddle with.
***Do you realize how lonely I am at night...especially now that I know jason is cuddling next to someone else....for soo many months I fell asleep next to a nice warm body with my hand on a hairy little belly....someday that will be replaced, someday!

I am wrighting this because I feel lost and lonely on the inside...
Usually I shut off and stay away from all of you...this does not mean I want hords of people showing up at my house...but a phone call or a short message would be nice!
I think I am strong....and I know that I should be, but I have to go at my own pace and learn to get on with things.

Priority #1 is school this semester...
I know I will have Jason on my mind a LOT...but at the same time....I am not gonna let him get me down!

Just a foreshadowing... March 11th is fast approaching, it will be here before we know it!  That is the day that Jason proposed to me...
I really would like to have dinner and a movie that night!  NO DRINKING!  But I wanna take lots of pictures of my friends and ""family"" here...soo I know I am loved and appreciated!

I love all of you...I know I say that and it sounds shallow...but you have made me feel like a friend, brother, and more...

I think it was the ice blue eyes that caught my attention first...but it was the smile and deffinition in his face that caused me to fall in love.  Of course, love it fleeting....and sometimes we do not find out the consequences until we have completed the hand that has been dealt before us.

I no longer believe in love at first sight.  It was all a fairy tale.  The prince swept me off my feet, he loved me for who I was, and then he turned into the evil witch and took my heart from my chest with his bare hands and squeezed the life and love from the vessel that brought such hope to a lonely soul!

Soo another year has come and passed...another lesson learned.  Maybe I should have listened to the voices which spoke in resounding tone, ""It will never work out!""
But with the passing of another year, and the learning of a lesson...finally I can close the chapter that has taken, what seems an eternity to write, I can close this chapter of my life with Jason.

Jason will be leaving at Semester.  He will be trying to get an apt in town.  I don't know if I am happy or sad....I don't even know if I care to have feelings for him, or about the situation right now.
I am stubborn and I am sad and hurt...but I refuse to let him, or this moment in my life ever get me down again.

Last night was the Climax, the ending, the final battle (if you will) for Jason and myself.
He wouldn't even give me Fuken rent money!  
He will be gone as soon as he finds an apt!

I can actually feel the emotions that fluttered through my body that night.  I can still feel the chill in the air and the smell of the fire burning in the chimney nextdoor.  I can hear his voice and see his smile...and I still get the sunken feeling in my chest everytime I think of that night.

What an amazing emotion love is....it can tear you up while you are feeling speacial all at the same time.


Two and a half years ago I met him.  I had seen him several times as we sat in class....loving him every time I laid eyes upon his face.  That all teeth smile, the smile of a winner; the laugh of a king; and the body of an angel....all wrapped into one, intelligent, perfect man.
Two and a half years ago I met the one man I knew would be in my life forever....I met my dearest friend.

Lately with the break-up and the situation I have allowed myself to become involved in with my ex living on my couch and trying to thrive in a new town....I have begun to think of this dear friend.  I had lost contact with him....never thought I would see him again, or know him the way I did.  But as luck would have it, God smiled on me when I was feeling the lowest.

Dan Melton...or for those who know him well...Dan, who is gay...Was the love of my life while attending Kansas State University my freshman year.
We had met shortly after I came out....and although I was in love with this god of a man...our relationship strived on being open, yet private, realistic, yet imaginative, and a relationship only the best of friends could ever share!
I don't even know how to describe our relationship...as Dan would say, ""You are my soulmate, Shane, even if we are never romantic...no other man could replace the feelings I have for you.""  Soo as you can see...when I recently heard from Dan...you can just imagine the emotions that came flooding through my body!

Dan and I expressed our love and admiration for one another on a chilly night those many months ago.  I had been debating whether I should confess my feelings for him or not....and he had known it all the time, yet was not ready for a serious relationship.
When I told him we both cried.  Dan did not want to break my heart....however, I had to understand that He was not ready...and that he had bigger plans for both of us...
Dan left after that first year to persue a career adn education in KC.  Dan has helped start numerous GBLTQ groups, organizations, magazines, etc in KC.  Although he plays on a different field that me right now....I have never felt lesser than he, and he has never let me feel anything less than beautiful and smart.

Dan has asked me to come visit him Next Friday....and I am extremely excited, and very scared.
It's not that I have even ever found Dan ""sexually"" attractive....it's just that he is my everything.  My best friend, someone to care for, someone I share common interests with, and the one person who has ALWAYS understood me.  Soo...I know I am only going to see him as a friend....but in my heart, I feel that I can't loose this boy.

Dan, who is gay....
Sometimes, there are people whom you love more than life it's self.  You are the one I love.  Even if we never jepordize our friendship to give love a chance...noone will ever replace the feelings for you I have in my heart.
I wish you knew or could feel how much I love you...thank you for those feelings...and thank you for being my everything!

It's amazing...

I could actually laugh and cry right now...I could be sad, yet happy in the same instance.
I believe I will close for now...and bask in the feelings that are surronding my soul at this very moment................"

Cause I was on fucken gay.com again....
It is like the devil or something....
I should not let it get me depressed, but it does.

And to add to the problems, I found out the boy I was crushen out is like a lunatic and a user...

Well fuck me, just fuck me.  It sucks....I had to be blessed with ""big bones""...and not inbetween my legs...and for some reason I feel like I have to act like a big sissy fag...

Well that is not me!
I am tired of feeling like I have to be a big fake!
I am just Shane, I like bois, and I act like ME!


I am soo lonely girls....
I love Jason to death, we don't fight anymore, but I need him gone....
I think I can make it another semester though.

I want to meet a boy in this town.  Just someone to go out with and do things with...is that too much to ask?

I need to get back into the groove of school.
I am taking more classes next semester....and spreading them out all over the day and night.
That way I can be at school the whole day, and take my mind off things.

I am taking a weight lifting class...and gonna swim afterwards...I am hoping that if I start looking better, I won't be soo depressed when I am alone all the time!

I don't want you all getting mushy on me....I hate that shit.
I need you as friends, but I close off and push people away when they want to be all helpy.
don't ask me why....I know this is a cry for help...but I just need you all to be there for me, when I come to you.
I will see you all tomorrow and Sunday....

Dani and Sara...
I will bring some Soda or something.....


I don't wanna stop typing.
I know that nothing made sense....but I feel a bit better!
I am gonna start writting again.
I need to...it makes me sane
It clears out my mind


I want my mom...
I wish I had her closer....I wish that I was still at KSU...I wish I still had Jason....
I wish I were really stable!

I wish I were not such a whiner.
I just want to be smart and professional
I have never gotten to be a kid!
I want to just be me
I am tired of being gay....I just want to like bois!

OMG...
That fuken ASG talk board really pissed me off...did you all read it?
Someone must die!

Ok...soo sue me if I don't believe in the WORD HOMOPHOBIA....
but there is something OBVIOSLY WRONG with this campus!


Well jason is fucken screaming at me to give him teh fuken computer back...like he doesn't have all weekend to do his shit.

I wish I had someplace to go....
Noone can call me cause the computer is on....
and Jason hates it when random people show up.

I am gonna go cry now...I feel like I could cry for a long time....but I know that I won't...I never can let myself cry.

I have those 4 Sublimes left...I might go drink by myself in my room....

C is over at Dusti's...she lives right next door...I would go over there...but I don't want to impose!

I will be better once I sleep!"

Went to Lawrence this weekend to visit my boi Toddy!  He is like my best friend.  We met at school last year in Manhattan...now he is in Lawrence and I am in Emporia.

I didn't realize Lawrence was soo close...I plan on going there more often.

Well I mainly shopped and ate all weekend.  Toddy and I spent money, money, money we don't have this weekend....but my by is in a little over a month, soo I did some early B'day shopping.
I got 2 lovely turtle neck, wool sweaters at abercrombie and two long sleeve shirts there also.
WOO WOO...I am not even gonna tell you how much that cost my credit card!

I kinda had a very informal date with a boy...woo woo...I watched Toy Story 2, very good....and I got to watch a HOT porn...and that was about all my weekend consisted of.

Last night I didn't come to PRIDE since I was talking to a friend.

I met this boy, named Derek, online..and we have been chatting for a while.  Last night we talked on yahoo and actually heard eachother's voices for the first time.
He is soo adorable.  Origionally from Salina, he is 18 and now lives in INDEPENDENCE, KS.  That is the only sucky part...it is about 2 hours from here...and I really don't wanna travel again.
We are gonna continue to talk, and I am going to visit him over the Thanksgiving Holiday and go dancing at the new gay bar in Salina!
It just makes me feel good that someone finds me attractive...

GO LOOK AT THIS BOY'S PICTURE...
http://www.facelink.com/ShaneAlan
He is the bottom picture, DEREK!

Well, I feel like detaching myself again this week.  Gonna do laundry tonight and then study, study, study.....
I can't decide whether or not to drop my Spanish class...if I do, I can't apply for any of the AIDS Quild scholarships....but if I don't drop it, I am gonna have a shittah GPA...

Oh well...I have written a book...gonna go now..

Allright folks...I seriously think you can all live a few days without seeing SHANE!

I went out this evening with a few theatre friends (I am not saying who or where...cause Christine and Kennedy will end up finding out where I go when I want to get away)....and when I get home, jason tells me they have been calling the house all night...they left like 5 messages...I swear...all within like an hour..
then he tells me they came over and knocked on the door for like 30 minutes...
he said he didn't want to answer, cause they scare him!
Damn...if noone answers..don't fucken keep knocken.
I guess it pissed my neighbors off also!
Shit
God Damn...get lives....I hardly know any of you...
I would like to get to know you all better....but I need some fucken space...my whole life is not being gay...
I HAVE other friends....
When I want to go to Manhattan to see my other friends for a weekend...am I gonna have to take my friends from Emporia with me...just soo they know I am safe and not lost!?!


anyhow...
I guess they tried my cell phone a few times (which is even long distance...WOW..fucken WOW...that is all I have to say)...but I had it and it was turned off...the ringer any way!


I love everyone...just sometimes...I like to get away...
I needed to do some homework and I needed to rest this weekend...

I hope you all can understand!

I will see you all tomorrow at the PRIDE meeting...

I hope there are no hard feelings...I am just feeling stocked OKAY?!?

Jason and I had a good night this evening....
I blew off everything today!
the parade with UAC, the Game, a dance and a party, even Project Safe...without evening telling Kennedy or Christine.
Jason and I watched movies and then talked.
I can honestly say...I am over wanting Jason back romantically...
I am sad our relationship didn't work out...
but he is the ONLY PERSON who understands me.
He does not TALK BEHIND MY BACK and he does not judge me.
We still argue and fight...but we are just like brothers in that since....
I am happy now...I feel like I have had a release of tension and a revelation....
I no longer have a lover...but I have a friend who will always be by my side!

Here's the story:

I walked into my Spanish class today and it was really hot...
soo I went to open a window...I got the window open and began to open the screen....
When the window feel down on my fingers....
I thought they were broken.
It took two other guys to open the window and get my fingers out...
I was soo shocked that I walked to the health center where I almost passed out!
The nurses made me lay down and ice my fingers for nearly an hour.
My index and ring finger on my left hand are really bruised and may loose the nails on each....On my Right hand my index finger kinda got dislocated...but I am double jointed soo it popped back into place...and I am feeling fine now...

OUCH...DAMN VENTANAS.....

Send flowers and cards if you want

ON the good side of my day...
I have good grades...with the exception of Spanish.

A- in Modern World Civ.
A- in Theatre Appreciation
B- in Analysis of Fine Arts
B- in Lifetime Fitness
F- in Spanish.....
-----Does anyone know Spanish... I have 2 more test and an oral left...If I get A's and B's the rest of the semester...I can get a C in this damn class... I need help if anyone knows Spanish...PLEASE let me KNOW!

I figure that Jason and I can just wait out our lease and then find a two bedroom apt through campus or some place else in Emporia for cheaper or about the same I am paying now for my 1 bedroom apt.

Ok soo I was like 10 min. late for work this morning....and as I was walking in, who do I happen to come upon....Barb the wonder secretary. 
She is like late every day, she has to pick up one of our elderly, crippled professors (I think it is time for ESU to invest in some new profs), and the one day that I am late....she like wigs out.

I guess the professors have to answer the phone when we are 10 min late, and they don't like that. Like it is that fucking hard to answer a phone when a student is 10 freaking min late for work. 
AAAARRRGHH

Anyhow....
Then I start to run copies for one professor....and this other professor runs in during her class and demands that I stop what I am donig and run her 10 copies as fast as I can....soo I am running off a copy already of about 200....and I can't just stop for this other damn professor.
I go down to the Debate room to use the copier there...which by the way is on the Dept's Budget...and I get griped out by Glen Strickland for doing my job....I guess he doesn't like us to use that copying machine becuase it is for DEBATE primarily...

I got some balls and talked to Jason the other night.  We decided that he will leave by the end of semester....soo that was good.  I need some space to heal.  He has also been sleeping on the couch now.  It feels good to actually go to bed alone....I know, I am suprised that I said that also...but it is good to know that I am starting to heal!

Well...now he is talking about still staying together....  And C has offered me her other room in her apt...and my mom thinks I should just stay where I am at.  I don't know what to do!
Jason has been sweet the last couple days...and if he doesn't mind sleeping on the couch and all...then it would be fine if we stick the year out and get an apt together next year...but I don't know.
I hate to put him out on his own...especially if he has to travel from Winfield to school every other day....but I don't want to make C mad if I don't move in....
I guess I will just give it a month and see what the decision is....

I am soo confused!


ALSO...
I NEED a boi!  just someone that I can hang out with when I am with all you darn lesbians...
I like Matty alot...but as you all know, I don't think we are the right guys for eachother....

We still live together and share the same bed...but we almost can't even stand to be around eachother anymore!!!

Soo am I over him you ask???  NO...NOT at ALL.
However, I am just really  lonely....
Soo what did I do last night???  I think I may have fallen for another guy....

His name is Mathew (those who are reading this know who I am talking about).  I call him Matty....

Well I have thought Matty is cute since the first time we met.  He just recently has come out...and he is kinda silly...and not the type of guy I usually go after...but OH WELL.  I need to broden my horizons I guess...

Last night after the panel... A bunch of us went to Ken and Chris's house...and Matty and I, well...kinda got close...
We didn't kiss or anything...we just held hands and kinda flirted and caressed eachother....
It was soo sweet!  I think I really like him....
I know he just wants to date and all....and I am totally cool with that.
I am not ready for another relationship....but Jason crushed my heart....and this is not rebound...but Matty will be there to replace the love that I am missing right now...

Well...I hope this all turns out well... I am gonna see him tonight...and I plan on giving more time to building an even better friendship with him!

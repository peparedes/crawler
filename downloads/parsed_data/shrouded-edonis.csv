"event","My sincerest appologies. I know that I am a bit out of date with this thing, and now that some things have wound down (unfortunatly), I'll try to do better at updating. I wasn't aware some people actually read this. This time in my life have been a bit different than normal. The way I would describe it is controlled chaos and change. There is a lot of personal meaning to that. Being the very open person that I am, I shall elaborate. There are times when I feel I am too open and shouldn't say all that I let out about me personally, oh well-life is too short for regrets. Lately i've been able to see my life from a different point of view, in a different way that I never could before. Seeing what I was really doing, and what was really happening to me has causing me to initiate a huge capaign of change within and around myself. I've cleaned myself up. Never will I do anything more than caffeine. If I want a rush I'll get it from adrenaline and pushing the envelopes of life and love ([safe] sex included). I'm starting to push my physical limits, something I've never done before. I'm working on getting into the best shape of my life. I'm opening up more to life and people. I'm still myself, just a better, more attractive, more charismatic version. I'm also planning for the future. When you really take a true few minutes to think about it, you'll realize how close college (if you plan to go) and adult-hood is in your life. Overall, I'm taking better care of myself. Theres even more to that, but its on a deep personal level.

   I finally got to see Elaina today. I didn't get to see her Friday or Saturday. This girl is amazing. How to even begin to describe her. I'm a little in awe of what this girl can do, and sometimes she doesn't even realize it. I sincerely hope to be with her for the longest time. We can just sit together and talka bout anything, no matter what and just click on whatever the subject may be. The relationship we have is so real. Theres so much more to what we have, and this great girl-but for now enough is said."

"event","I've had way too much to drink, its soo hard to type correctly. I'm drunk to hide my pain (R.I.P. angel Bethany), but I do feel I've delt with it quite well when I was sober-which is not right now. Watching the 25th hour (a movie) drunk is quite a different experience. Word. Joy to you all, I have to go throw uo from drinking too much, and I'm part IRISH. I've had a bit too much. Lates. I love you all, you have no idea."

"event","I went to Bethany's funeral yesterday on the 24th of December, only hours before Christmas eve, it impacted me how fucked up that is. I almost cried a few times when something someone said would bring back a memory I had with her. My ride was going to take me to the cemetary after the funeral, but he got a call and had to go, so he dropped me off at home instead. I rushed into my house and got my bike out. I rode to the cemetary in a suit. I don't know why I did it. I guess out of respect, but it sucked. I couldn't feel my hands when I arrived, and traffic was hella heavy. It touched me though how people I hadn't talked to in years came up to me and told me to be carful and stay safe. She left something in everyone who knew her, I can attest to that personally. Its Christmas day, I got a lot of stuff-some odd things I might add. I can't stop thinking of Bethany, I'm better about it now, its not such a sad thing. Its more like remembering our good times together. I want to see my beautiful Elaina, I miss her so much. Hallo to both Ashes."

"event","I was supposed to get up at 6 A.M., but who does that on Christmas break when you don't have to? I had to get ready to leave around 10:30 a.m. because my parents wanted me to go to the open house where they work (SED [software engineering directorate] on Redstone Arsenal). I slept in till 9:40, if felt too good to get up, twas quite a challenge. I managed to get up, take a shower, and ""be presentable"" in time to go, but I didn't eat breakfast. I toured SED, snacked on all the food that was layed out by various employees. I speant a majority of my time their messing around on the ADSI (air defense systems integrator). Its a 30 million dollar system that my father works on, oddly hes the only person in the south-east of the U.S. that deals with the system. I can't describe with words the type of stuff I was doing, plus I found out afterwards that much of what I was doing was classified. I prefer to stay alive so i'll just say it was quite entertaining. I had two cups of black coffee at SED, and when we left we went to Barnes and Noble to get a cappacuino (sp?) at Starbucks. I was feeling good, thanx to the large doses of caffeine. Right as I was leaving I got to see Ashley B. for a minute, shes a friend and past g/f, theres more to that, but thats on the d/l. 

    Tonight is the visitation for Amanda Costellow, and I don't have a fucking ride, I WON'T GET TO MAKE IT!!!!!!!!! Thats really fucking pissing me off, I feel really bad about not getting to make the visitation, I need a fucking car. The whole thing, its so surreal. Wednesday of the last week of school, Bethany came up to me and gave me this huge hug she always does when she got to see me. She looked into my eyes and gave me that great smile she always had. She told me how she missed getting to see me and how we should get togeather more to chill and just do whatever. I can still remember that day so well. I'm really going to miss her, I never got to see her that much lately, ever since Star moved away I saw less of her-but we still got to meet up every once in a while. The fact that they both died, burned to death in that car accident, so close to Christmas, its a bit munch to handle. My beautiful girlfriend Leyna isn't taking this very well right now. I broke the news to her yesterday, she hadn't heard about it. She broke down and cried. Its tough not only going through things like this, but seeing how hard it is for everyone else to go through this too. 

Live every single day of your life like it is your last, tomorrow is not guaranteed."

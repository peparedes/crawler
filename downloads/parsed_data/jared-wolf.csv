"event","So, Anna Marie decided to come home.

<lj-cut text=""Home"">

And I got to look around the house where we will be staying for a while. I keep thinking I want to keep staying there. Not that it mattered muchh to me before, the whole deal for a house. One bedroom apartment, room for my computer and a place to sleep. Maybe a small kitchen to cook in. That was all. Now, with Merideth.. Odd how I stepped in to the house, walked through the rooms and thought of family. But not quite like the family I already have, I was thinking of Mom, Dad and Anna.. getting close to Christmas and I could 'see' all four of us gathered around the tree. The talks we had. The eyeing of the presents. I remember coming home from school and walk straight in to the kitchen where Mom would be cooking or pass the living room where Dad would sit and watch the news. I stood in the hallway and I could swear I heard the short steps of a small Anna Marie, when she was sneaking around to try to have water and such for her tea parties in her room, even if Mom told her no water in there. 
Now I see me and Merideth, Anna Marie, Trinity. I walk through this house and I feel home, even after just a few days, our scents are in there and I can smell Meri on the sheets. On the towels. In the kitchen I smell her tea and orange juice. Little things, but it makes it home. 

Anna Marie came in on the late flight last night, I was happy to see her. Even more so when she asked for a hug. I was a little stunned, I still am. She is... I know Donna said she's been improving a lot, staying back in Augusta. I guess I just had a hard time believing it but here she is, closer to her old self then I ever thought I'd see her. Conscious or not, she seeks my protection and I have no words for how that makes me feel. I am glad she decided to come home. I want her to get to know Merideth better. To get to know Trinity, too. And there is Meri's grandparents and all. Wonder if Anna Marie is not actually trying to be there for me, too. 

I think I can manage to get the Dojo done for Christmas, hopefully Merideth wont notice. Would make a great extra gift for the Holidays. And I still have to do some Christmas shopping. Gah, I hate that. I think I'll ask Daine if she can't help me. She should be back, too. I need to call her, see how her visit went. I miss her, too. And she left so quickly after her test, I didn't get to really tell her how proud I am of her. I'll make up for that, I guess.

I've talked a little bit with Zane, he seems to be taking things a little calmer and better. That is, until this shit happens with Jolene. I don't know what to say or do. What can I do to prevent an attack like that, to my Lupa. Or for that matter, my Ulfric. I feel helpless and useless, I don't even want to be near them in case they notice. I instead find myself killing bags at the Mansion. I am so glad Anna came, she gives me the perfect reason to seem just fine. I am Skoll. And suddenly I can't do my job. So back  to the punching bags."

<lj-cut text=""Bigger plate, please!"">

Okay, so Merideth has moved us in to one of the houses in the Presidio, since her Grandparents and Uncle? is coming. And I have to be on my best behavior, because apparently I am snatching the last good batch of Harris DNA. Of which reminds me, how the HELL do I respond to any questions about me and Meri having babies? I sure hope she tells them what has happened with her, then again, she hasn't seen them for years and I guess it's a little odd. By the sound of how she speaks of them though, I think she'll be able to tell them. If not, I'll just be a good 'ole boy who has a good running business. On a note on that, Radisson is hauling in some mula! Damn, best investment I ever did. Anyway.. I am careful to not let on to Meri, but really, meeting the 'inlaws' so to speak is making me a little nervous. I don't know why, not like I am comitting a huge sin or treat her bad. I guess because they are older I just.. ungh. 
It'll be fun though to stay in a house, just me and Merideth. Oh, and Trinity, if she wants to. With her Hyena. White picket fence and 9 to 5 job... dreamer? Me? Hah!

Restaurant is getting the overhaul it needs, I am very pleased. Looks like I can open after the New Year sets in. The Dojo will be done before that, which is good for Meri. 
Anna Marie is staying in Augusta for the Holidays, Donna says she'll bring her back over here after the New Year. And she is doing good. Donna says she crossed a barrier coming out here and is changing more and more each day, for the better. She is even singing, now. She sounds very happy when I talk to her on the phone, it feels great to know she is taking these huge leaps now. 

Apparently we are now officially free of chaperones and such, HF is down baby! Course, there are still some out there, specifically at least one of the women who shot at Scott. Damn. 
Took Merideth out to Julius Castle for dinner, to celebrate. And by God, she wore a dress. She spent almost TWO HOURS in the bathroom and bedroom, getting ready. That was the first shocker, then the second was when she came out wearing this green dress.. and the third when she had make up on. Wow.. I mean just.. Wow. I always thought her beautiful, but the stunner I took out to dinner.. I could hardly keep my eyes off of her, let alone my hands. I think when it comes time to see her in a wedding dress, my heart might just stop completely. How does she still do this to me.. 
Then Keahi and his talk about wine and fairies.. and Full Moon and lovers. I am not even able to put down exactly what this was all about. But I do know that Keahi needs this favor and as a almost friend, I'll do it.. and Merideth agreed easily too. Only problem we have is.. its Full Moon.. And the whole night, we have to watch over this wine. I need to sort that out a little better, I think. 
And spend some time with Keahi, always cool to hang with him.

This morning I had the best talk ever, with Faith. Did I mention she is one hot.. anyway. Yeah. She is great, I can see how everyone wants to talk to her and has nothing but nice things to say. I definitely enjoy her company. I am curious about her abilities and such, I want to follow when she learns. That would be cool. The things she brought up though has me a little worried, but I think it will work out in the end.

Wonder when Daine will be back. I miss her. Hope she has fun and things are going good back home. I would not be surprised if her family just accepts it as it is. 
Nahele's testing is soon. This will be interesting, to say the least. 
Ok, I am off to check on the restaurant."

<lj-cut text=""Happenings of burrito wolf"">

Well, I know that I've been noticed walking out without an escort. So far, so good, no big deal but I better be careful so none of the cubs notice, nor any of the rankings. 

Damn earthquake set my plans back by at least a month, I think. What a mess. At least it seems most will be covered and unlike some, my building stands. And we are all alive. 
I need to get out of my funk, apparently. Not paying too much attention to what is happening Pack wise, worried about Anna-Marie who left to see Donna. Talking to Donna she said  things were okay, that Anna only needed some time back to where she feels more at home. 

Merideth had an argument with Zane, I know all about it and I'm placed in the middle. Seeing both sides, it's hard and I am glad neither one of them would ever ask me to take sides. I just hope Zane knows that Merideth's temper is quick to come but she does not mean half of what is said. Even what she says is not exactly what people hear either so.. After reassuring here  things would be fine, I sought out Zane and found the man very tightly bound. Shit. I've been neglecting him too and I feel like an ass. But we got some things out and it seems Jolene will help too. As much as he insists he needs to help her, what he might find out is that allowing her to help him, will help her. And it's better for the pack, too. 
Merideth told me about the meeting with Jolene and the ranked, we are now easing some of Zane's burdens. And it's about bloody time.

I didn't go to the meeting, Merideth's birthday present completely exhausted me. God, that woman. She is getting better and much braver in her play, giving me something to keep up to these days. I've never had a better gift in my life, I can say that for sure. And she enjoyed it too. Enjoyed what it did to me and I think only gave her more confidence in knowing what only she can do to me. 

I offered Zane my services in any way he need it, including being temporary Eros if need be. He is worried though that Merideth will be upset, but I don't think Zane has noticed the connection me and Merideth have. She knows where she has me and though I only want her, I can do the job needed for the Pack and Cubs, without having to worry about her. It feels good to know she is that confident in us, now. 

And in mentioning that... Scott knows, now. My ass is still tingling from the birthday spankings and.. other things. Yeah, I think this has been  the best birthday ever. Grace's present is going to be so much fun, too. I'll have to give her a challenge, and soon. 

My to do list:

Talk to Daine. Talk to Keahi. Love on Merideth. Dance with Eden. Get to know Brigid. More Capoeira with Faith. Love on Merideth, plan escape route in case the family doesn't like me. Love on Merideth some more. 
Have a talk with Zane. Gah. I think I have to get going on this shit. At least I got to enjoy my birthday. A year older and I feel better now that I ever have. Cool."

<lj-cut text=""Sugar babies"">

I want sugar babies or sugar daddies. Lots of them. Sit down and watch one of Merideth's movies and see if I can get a sugar high. On my next to do list, loacte some damn sugar babies!

Merideth's nightmares has gotten better. Less frequent. She's becomnig very relaxed these days and it affects me as much as I affect her. Nice. I don't think I want to see what happens if either one of us get really upset. 

Met Detective Madsaen MacKeough, she wanted a more detailed statement about the shooting at the hospital. I had such a hard time not just staring at her, it was the oddest thing. Except she wears leathers out in public, it's uncanny how she and Merideth are alike. Merideth misses her job, I wonder if I can convince her to go back to it. That, or I need to get this restaurant done quicker so she can work on her Dojo. Content, but restless. 

Scott pointed out she's come a far way since he first met her and from when she was first a cub. I can easily see her being one of the worse cubs there were, but considering her background and all, it's not really a surprise. I would imagine it would be easier for her now then back then. 

I've been having these little chats with Keahi. I think I need to call him and set a hangout time with the X-box and stuff. Wonder if he cheats... 

I know Merideth knows about my little trips to the outside on my own, lets hope everyone doesn't notice. I'm just a little fed up with having to go out in groups and all. I think David's suggestion is looking better and better each day and the idea of the Firsters turning themselves in is... rewarding. I need to see that happen. 

I think I'll go check on people. Make myself available for Pack fun and closeness. Just waiting on the restaurant to finish now. Hopefully, we'll have no issues with HF at the grand opening."

<lj-cut text=""A few things"">

Merideth is like a new person, almost. The relief she got from her church is exactly why I like the fact that she goes. And she has to eat humble pie since Scott was right again. Big surprise there? Nah.

Talked to Scott... I can't change certain things about my life, nor things that has already happened. But I do wish for him to have what I have found with Merideth. Scott also made sure  that I did I what I needed to do with Bo, rather then let David do it. I was right, David didn't much like it but he let me anyway. Bo? Not even giving him a second thought at this point.

Halloween party was interesting. Merideth did indeed wear a dress, though not quite as I expected. It was a great costume though. And I really wanted to grab Scott and push him up against the walll and.. well anyway.
Daine's costume was.. develish, certainly drew some attention. Then Mara.. Oy. Yeah, no touching the feathers of the peacock there, Jared.
There was a bunch of nice costumes, Elissa was a great Kali. 
Merideth found that indeed I was not wearing anything under the kilt. There is something oddly disturbing about having a zombie slide their hand up your skirt. 

Life goes on. Now to deal with the Firsters."

<lj-cut text=""I see no end"">

Napa Valley is beautiful. Peaceful. I enjoyed the full day I got with Daine there, we got closer and I know she's ready. 
Trip got cut short. Called Scott since I couldn't get hold of Merideth. Found out  that Jackson is dead and Madison was hurt. Firsters, no doubt. I hauled ass and got a rental, on the drive back I told Daine what had happened. She.. is sad. I am sorry that these things happen to her, and to watch her keep calling Bo and not getting answer? I don't like it. Hopefully, it will work out. 

As soon as we got back, I went and told Scott we were back, then I went to look for Merideth. She was not at Samovar, nor at the Mansion. My only option was that she was at Mass, it was after all Sunday. And true enough, there she was. I never thought I'd see her so defeated in my life. I don't know what to do, I am not God, I can't give her the faith or belief she needs in human kind. Firsters, us, others of our kind... there are monsters everywhere. But Merideth believes in life. And here we are, life taken away from us, threatened... and she can't stand by and watch as we take our revenge on what is being done to us. I understand her. I respect her view and I can even agree with it. But there is that part of me that will not feel a thing to kill whoever killed Jackson and hurt Madison. And an innocent bystander, who will now be one of us. I killed that part of myself the day I killed my parents monsters. I'd do it again. I will do it again. Does it make me a monster? Can you be a monster when you fight back for your survival? No. There are too many sides of the coin. What is fair to the family  that loses a member? What is fair to a father losing a son or a son losing a father? What would justify the wrong made to a woman, raped and left for dead? Jail? Death sentence by someone elses hand? 
I don't know what to tell Merideth. I don't know if she can stay with me, when she sees  the darkness in me. 

I need to meet with Zane, Jolene and Scott. As soon as possible, or else Merideth might do something... I find my heart being  torn in ten different directions. God help me. Are you listening?"

<lj-cut text=""Usual ramblings"">

The Hunt went great, as expected. It was nice to see Trinity recognized as an adult and even better is how she could now see how everyone else also cares. She is getting there, and  I know it means a lot to Merideth. Now, if I could only get back through to Daine. She's pretty much closed up and I am not even sure if anyone has noticed. If it was Zane, I'd kick the shit out of her but she's not and I don't know what I can do. Guess I should just go find and her and just hold her, if she lets me. I miss her. I don't want her to think that we had a fight and can't talk anymore. 

Woke up at the grounds with Trinity and Scott. Oh, of course Merideth... It was nice. Went back to the apartments, showered up and... Well, Jolene dropped by. I really need to spend some time with her at some point. I know she can take care of herself and all that, as much as Zane, but I want her to know she's my Lupa and I am also her Skoll. I know Zane considers Jolene his equal, and smart man he is.. I would sure as hell not argue with her. Nor with Merideth, really. I know how viscious women can be. Besides, they usually let us wear the pants anyway. Like Merideth. I know I can't help but do my dominance bit on her, and I don't mean just me... I mean my wolf.. And she accepts it, easily. I get to wear the pants. But only when she lets me. How odd is that.. Just thinking about that makes me go... urrh? 
Anyway. She plans on introducing Zane to her parents and stuff. A sister. Not sure how big her family is, but she wants to add Zane to it and I am happy for them. And  I know he'll say yes, because I've not seen him (or heard him) as happy before. Odd, that. We both have to come here to find our mates. Oh, well. 
I am so doing Zane's Bachelor party. 

Merideth showed me the wedding cake she's picked out. She says she has her church booked and all. Seems like a lot of work,  this whole wedding thing. I am glad she's taking care of most of it! Just let me pay for it, that way I sort of feel useful. Besides, I have to get my own suit.. which.. I think I'll ask Scott to help me. Merideth is working on looking the best for me when she walks down that aisle, I guess I should try to look presentable when I wait at the end of it. 
So, now I need a best man and two groomsmen or something. Urh? I want to ask Zane... but I wonder if he is not going to be the one to give Merideth away? I need to check on that. If he is, I will ask Scott to be my best man. After all, he /is/ the best. I would ask David to be one of my groomsmen but.. well.. that would be tacky, I think. Maybe I'll talk to him and see what he'd think. I have another idea too but maybe I'd be pushing the limit with that one.. I could check.

I stayed out of the apartment most of the day on Wednesday and Thursday. Went to The Hole in the Wall with Daine, Grace, Seth and Merideth though. Nice place. Sort of scoped it out a little for the prank planned. Should not be too hard to drop something in there. Let's hope the Rodere is as humorous about it as we were about them invading the Mansion. 

Merideth is talking about maybe trying to infiltrate the Firsters. It's been on my mind for a while now, we need to do it but I don't want her to go. I know she has to, if she already has a foot in sort of, but I don't have to like it. Scares me that she'd place herself with these people. Scares me that I might lose her. I'm not sure how sane Zaney could keep me if something happened to her, and that is even more scary. Maybe I should make a note for Zane to just kill me if something happens. Better then me going nuts and killing everything in sight, right? 
Just something that can't get out of my head. It... I don't know. Even Merideth is noticing I think, that I am fading a little. Did some Tai-Chi with her yesterday and I just couldn't get it to settle. Maybe it's just cold feet or something. Only one that I was ever involved with for a greater length of time was Donna and that wasn't even a relationship really. Best friends. Lovers. Nothing more or less. After Chicago I was just being.. young, chasing skirts and all that. Then my parents and Anna happened and it killed something in me, the want and need for someone that would be a mate. And here I am, marrying someone because I can't even imagine my life without her. I've heard of and I've seen, true mates. I don't want to think about it. 

I'm taking Daine with me to Napa. Just because. Right now, I have to drop Jack off. He said he needed a ride to Denny's or Chinatown when I ran in to him on my very early bird work out. 
I'm going to go look for Daine or leave her a message. Talk to Zane. Talk to Merideth. Just this weekend, I want to go with Daine. Maybe Anna if she wants to, though I think maybe she feels safer here. We'll see."

<lj-cut text=""Why?"">

I'm looking at a pile of paperwork here. And I feel accomplished. I've been here in San Francisco almost three months and here I am, owner of a new dump. I call it a dump because that's what I'll name it, maybe. But my plans are slowly working out. Got a call from Bob from Bee's too. Business is running good. Thank God, since I am wondering what I am doing with all my money. And money makes the world spin around, especially when I am thinking wedding, education and new places to open. 

Radisson is doing great, like I should be surprised about that? I've had so many meetings with Mr. Halder by now, I should know that the old geezer does know what he is doing. Even if it is old fashioned to my sense. Donna would so kick my ass if she knew I was that picky on it though. She of all people would know how much I like traditions. 

Speaking of Donna, she can't wait to meet Merideth. Scary, since she probably knows more about her, or what I feel about her, then anyone except maybe Anna Marie and Zane. Who else was I supposed to talk to, when I got here, then her and Anna Marie. Zane was too busy, but I am guessing he already knows. Not like I didn't get enough crap from him for not staying with anyone for more then a week. Jaded. 

There's a couple of new wolves in the area, someone from Grace's past. Which apparently set off another angst attack or something. Really, I have to wonder if I'll ever meet Grace. The real one. Wonder if she's anything like Faith? If she is, damn... I can see the line of men at the door and down the street. 

Daine. I love her more then I could ever express, she's a great person and I love working with her. I love talking with her. And I love being able to be there for her. But damn is she not fighting the fact that she's changed. I know she's changed, I've seen a big difference since arriving here at the same time. Not sure if it's that she's fighting it though.. could be just because she can't let go. Doesn't help that you are an adult and get treated like a kid sometimes. I understand and I forgive her easily. I just hope she knows I am proud of her and that I'll always be there for her. Just like Mara will be. And that girl is something else, too. Shit, think we could hit it off as good friends. I think I will pursue that, I like her humor. Besides, every man should have at least a good girl that is nothing but a friend. Donna is too far away sometimes.

Anna Marie. She gave me a great idea for a Halloween costume. We have been talking, she's been finding me when no one is around. Wonder how she does that. But, it's been great. Nothing like laying my head in her lap and just talking. She is also pleased I think, that I asked Merideth to marry me. School is going ok for her, which is good. Now, I hope she takes up on this girl's night out to hunt, it could do her a lot of good. She's coming back to me, slowly, but she is coming back.

So, I went with Scott to help him with this banquet thing at the hospital. We did agree that he should have someone with him and I never did mind spending time with him. There is no way they would know me as a lycanthrope. I've not been hiding but I also know they never had reason to look at me closer. So I know they were after Scott, which scared me. I did what I had to do, and it hurt like hell, but God... Had something happened to Scott, I am not sure what I'd do. Probably turn back to the monster I was when my parents got killed.

Now this is what I mean by saying, I don't think anyone knows me. Except Zane. He knows exactly what I can do and how little it takes from me to do it. I'm not surprised he is letting everyone think I can be such a friendly and outgoing guy, which of course I am, but still. There is that one part of me, after dealing with my parents killers and Anna's rapists... And I am still trying to find out if Merideth would even have a clue. 
And then what will I do? Will she accept it or would it scare her away? I don't know. I wish I wasn't two different people, though one will always be stored away as needed. 

I've taken some time to go talk with Keahi, of all people. And I find I enjoy our conversations. Surprises me how easily we get along, though our views are so different. Never thought I'd actually consider a Vampire a friend. But that is what he is becoming, sort of. Maybe it's just that he is a more openly a monster then I am myself. I don't know. I do know that I will be talking more with him, just to hang out. It's not that I don't love the Pack and everyone in it, but as always, I find that one thing outside that keeps life interesting. 

I am making a note of trying to not get shot again, stabbed, gutted or sliced up in any way. As much as I love what Madison does, I just don't think I want her touching me like that again. Fine, so I am constantly eyeing the sweets of life, like Grace, Faith, Mara... others. But she does that whole healing thing and gets me like I don't want her to. I think next time I'll just suffer. 
Nothing personal towards Madison, I like her. I can see why David loves her, and I also know Merideth still does. 

I have to talk to Zane about Donna visiting, maybe she could help Madison a little bit with her Eranthe position if she needs it. Not like Donna doesn't have the experience to help. Also need to mention to Zane that Keahi wouldn't mind me as some sort of ambassador or someshit. Which again surprises me that I like the idea. Want to know more. 

Ok, almost time to go. Lupanar. Quality time with Merideth before. We need it."

I love the pink on Zane. I need to put my head together with Mara more often. And speaking of Mara.. I wonder if she knows just how great she can be when she relaxes. Good looks AND sense of humor. Boys, watch out. I find I wont mind hanging around her at all. We might be trouble, like pink fuzzy bunny trouble or glue on the toilet seat trouble. Bad bad. 

I was going to wait until after Thanksgiving. At least. Nevermind I had already bought the ring and was still sort of cooking up a plan on how to do it. Out the window. Like I should be surprised? I'm not... but still, it's sort of... wow. No date set, which is fine really. I just wanted her to know, wanted her family to know, I really am serious about her. Even so, I find that the only one I really don't have to prove anything to is her. She just *knows*. My soulmate. Half the time I don't even need to say a thing, she already seem to knows. 

Spent a fortune on a car. Well, okay, it was a good deal Daine got and she really deserved the car. Wonder if she is not feeling a little wilder though. I should keep an eye on her, maybe make a point of going out with her more then letting Karen constantly follow her. I don't think she'd feel so 'looked after' if I went with her. I think it's time for sisters. Spend some time with both Daine and Anna Marie. 

So this whole HF thing has me worried. I offered Scott to hang with him when he needed to go out. Not only because it's not safe, but also because I miss the guy. It's been hectic for him, and for myself, so spending some time with him does not hurt at all. Madison will be better off staying with the rest of us in Samovar until we can get this all sorted out. Grace.. Well. Hopefully Zane has a plan for her. Trinity is not a problem, really, if she can just get past the whole deal of 'I am being watched again, I am the weak one and need to be placed somewhere safe'. Why does she keep thinking she's that hard to care about? Sometimes people just do! 

Got in some time with Zane, too. That is what I call quality time, boy... If not for all the years we've known each other, I'd be scared. I knew he'd stop but damn, I'll have to wait a week or two before offering myself up as a live punch bag. I hope it helped him. Now, maybe we'll be able to talk again. 
Thank God Madison came. I really did not need anyone to see this and she took care of it. And can I just say.. WOW. I swear, that is the BEST and the worse healing I've ever experienced in my life. David better hold on to that girl, she's something else. Thank God Merideth found me and knows how this work, it could have turned so awkward. Then again, it sort of did, when the two looked at each other. So now I just have to find a way for Madison and Merideth to talk again. I think I'll lock them up in a room and sit at the door until they give in. If they think they are stubborn, they have not seen nothing yet. They NEED to talk. Kiss and make up. Well, not exactly. They need to be fine with each other.

So, Grace is with Kai. Which of course, pisses me off. I don't care how much power or magic tricks this boy has up his sleeve, and I really don't care that he is the big brother of a pack member. The boy has NO respect, far too much arrogance and there is NOTHING pack about him. Maybe I should suggest to Zane that us boys go camping. Zane, me, David, Scott and Kai. Would that not be fun. 

I talked to Jocelyn. She is... bored, it seems. I have to agree with Keahi, Solomon probably did save her by taking her as a regular dinner plate. But still, he seems to be controlling her more then he needs to. She is doing alright so far, it seems. Scared of leaving this one thing she has in case she can't find it again. Wonder what Zane will say about that. She is the kind of person that HAS to be addicted to something, and the more dangerous it is, the better. I feel sorry for the girl, still... Vivian also told me she had something else for me, so I have to see her again. Which will not be so bad, as I enjoy her company very much. 

Donna says she wants to come visit sometime. Maybe after Christmas. I think I'll have everything running at a normal schedule by then, with restaurant and all that. Merideth is taking at least parts of the upstairs of the restaurant for her Dojo. I'm sure we'll find a use for the rest of it. And I might have convinced her to wear a dress for me sometime. And I also managed to trigger something I just don't know how to handle, right now. I am mad and there's nothing I can do about it. It's already too late. Just thinking about it now makes me mad enough that I could...."

"event","So finally, I think I have decided.

<lj-cut text=""Click me!"">

One of these places that Daine had me look at really appealed to me. I think I'll go for that one. Actually, I already told them that I wanted it so now just for the papers to go through. I started the paperpush for all the permits I need for this place, so while it's being set up the way I want it, papers should be slowly coming through. Good thing I already got a head start while in Arizona, at least I know what they are looking for as far as serving permits, food permits blah blah blah... 
The building is pretty damn cool, serves just my purpose. It's a huge warehouse type deal, so big open space inside. Which is great for long tables and a stage, coat room and all that. Even has a second story, where I wonder if I should just make in to small apartment or maybe just let Merideth have it for whatever she'd like. And now to fess up a shitload of money for Daine's bonus. 

Went out with Merideth and Trinity, too. Merideth gave the Shadow to Trinity, excellent choice of person to give it to. She is mastering the riding a motorcycle pretty well, too. We went up to  the Lupanar, driving lessons and all. I fell asleep in the truck and the two went out and got a huge buck. Well, Trinity did most of the work I heard. 
Got back home and tried to move some more stuff from Meri's old place to mine, got a little distracted. Will take forever for this bite to heal, and when I walk it rubs against the other thigh. So, I betcha it'll even leave a scar. Nice teeth, though.. rrr.. hrm. 

I heard Grace and Keahi broke up. That is.. odd. I haven't talked to Grace, other then the package that suddenly appeared. Of which, I also checked with Hawke and all. Jolene was the one who brought it in. So, I suppose it is safe but still.. Had us all worried. Can't be from her, though. Must be playing delivery girl or something.. 
Anyway. Back to Grace and Keahi. Yeah.. I'm pretty damn sure this is tearing Keahi apart. I mean, the way he talked about her to me, sounded like there could not possibly be anything that could break them apart. Not sure how Grace is taking it, either. I should talk to her. If she wants to, that is. 

I am wondering if Anna is avoiding me. I mentioned that we had to go do something for Zane, since then she's just been avoiding me. Or I have bad timing. I need to pin her down. 
On another note, Zane should be fully rested or properly broke down by his mate now, I can face him. Let's hope he got rest. More energy to beat the shit out of me. 

Cookies! Want! Daine is spoiling me, so is Anna when she gets started on cookies. And Donna sent some, too. I miss her. I haven't talked as much to her as I used to. In fact, ever since Anna got here I've been a bad boy. I'll send her some flowers and sit down and talk to her for a couple of hours."

<lj-cut text=""Summary"">

She liked the ring. Thank God. I was wondering if I was moving too fast... I mean, it all feels right and I didn't want to pressure her. I didn't ask her to marry me, but it was close. Why didn't I? Heh, I guess because where I am sure that I want to spend the rest of my life with this woman, and can hope that she wants the same.. ok, I know she wants to.. I am not sure if anyone else understand us at all. I know there's no one else for me, she's it.

So, Aubrey got kidnapped by this freak. I could only watch as everyone, Zane, Jolene, Scott, Merideth and David, packed up to go find her. Its something comforting about knowing how quickly things snapped together as soon as they found she was gone. Everyone knew what they needed to do, it got done and voila, they were ready to get her. Though disappointed I had to stay here, I guess I understand why.. but still... 
I'll have to talk to Zane. After he gets his rest. Maybe he'll hurt me bad, but what the hell right... 

Daine has pretty much managed to pull off the agreement we made, so now I'll have to give her the bonus so she can get that car. She'll look good in it, and damn if she does not deserve it after all the work she's done. I'm proud of her. She even won her Challenge. Close call, but she did it anyway. She just needs the regular practice and she'll be a dangerous opponent to anyone. 

I've talked some with Keahi. I decided that I could just ask him straight out rather then go behind his back, about this Solomon Black. So basically, Solomon saved Jocelyn from herself. She's what they call a 'freak'. Someone who is sort of addicted to being bit and all that crap, and where she should only be fed from once every two weeks, she did it like once a week or something. I still don't get the whole deal with Vampires but I am learning and Keahi is letting me learn. Gotta respect the man for that. 
Vivian did give me some information but nothing I could really use. Was a great time with her though, she's charming. 

Merideth said she wanted to move in with me, now. Wonder if she'll be cooking more. I don't know, but it seems to me she's become much calmer these days. Although her temper is still there, she also seem to think through things now and I think she might surprise a few people with it. I am proud of her. 

The task Daine just relayed to me from Zane has me really.. unsettled. I need to talk to him before I explode."

<lj-cut text=""Reasons to why?"">
So, Lupanar was great. It as awesome to hear the words the Ulfric spoke and I think at that moment, everyone might have understood why I followed him here. The Pack seemed so together, and it makes you feel good. There is a bond there, building each day to become stronger. And I hunted. I fed. Then we all, or most of us, woke up together. And then of course, things will change. Daine came and cried on my shoulder, very hurt. I had to have Merideth chase after Madison, and I watched David walk away. 

I am ending up the bad guy, for loving Merideth and it's becoming increasingly frustrating to know that people seem to think blame has to be put on *someone*.
And I am that someone. I'll take that. Not like I am being taken seriously around here anyway, so why not. 

I need to talk to Zane. Ever since I got here, we have not sat down once to talk. Not once. And I am supposed to protect the man. I am not saying just from bodily harm, David is great at that. Which is why I am so glad I have David at my side, too. He can do that stuff well, it seems. We do our share, and I know mine is to protect Zane in other ways then just physical. But, does Zane know that? I don't think so. He is bulldozing on, drinking his gatorade and doing his thing. While not letting *me* at least know, what the hell is going on. Yeah, I need to talk to him. He has changed some and I need to know why. 

So I heard Trinity passed her test, like I even doubted that. She's a good woman, that one. I enjoy being around her very much.
Daine has improved immensly, too. She'll be something to watch out for, when she hits adulthood for sure. I am very proud, I hope everything works out for her. If not, I will be there to make sure she tries again. And again. She thinks she bugs me, but I love it. I love her, she has become such a natural part of my family, I don't know how else to describe it. She's my sister, and I am glad she considers me her brother. And she promised to fire chatterbox or eat her. Gotta love that. So I will give her that bonus she wants, though I'll have to be careful about how generous I am getting with her. AND Anna.. the two of them will make me broke before I know it. Ok, maybe not. But I can pretend anyway, to be saving my pennies. 

Got something for Merideth. Hope she likes it or I am screwed. I think I must have lost my mind..."

<lj-cut text=""Happenings"">

So I  got to speak with Faith. Did I mention she is gorgeous? Anyway, she is. So is Grace. And it still don't hurt to *look*. She said she'd speak to Hariel for me, I hope that goes well. 
Had dinner with Vivian and David. It was interesting to watch the two, really. I can't remember the last time I had such an interaction with Anna. Though, chances are we can have them again now. She's... better. I could hug her briefly before she became too scared. She made cookies. She and Daine. I think Anna and Daine can become good friends. I hope so, if not, that is okay too. I know Anna has a lot to work through. And so does Daine, different situations. I am proud of them both, though. 

Anyway, back to dinner. Yeah, David got called away so it eneded up with me and Vivian. She is a charming woman, really. I am sure David is just the same, when he is not all closed up and wound up like a ball of yarn. I do hope I get to know David better, as we work together more. If he is as charming as Vivian, I will probably have a blast around him. And I always wanted a brother. Not hoping too much, though, considering everything.

I finished dinner and went back to the apartments, figured I'd drop by and tell Scott about the progress of my tasks. And there was Madison. She looked... aweful. Scratches and bruises.. but Scott said it was nothing to worry about. Course, I just couldn't ask Madison between the screaming and the pounding on my chest. She socked me a good one, I was sure I was going to lose some teeth. And then she just kept going... the physical pain was of course just that, pain. Though had she kept going, she could have broked my bones and smoshed my heart and lungs. I just.. couldn't get myself to stop her. She screamed at me, that it was all my fault and I know it's true. I didn't know what to say or do, really. How could I possibly explain to someone, who's just lost this person, that I didn't mean to? 
Sure, my intentions was not to steal Merideth away. Even Merideth knows that. But there is that *thing* between me and Merideth that we could not ignore. Bittersweet. I am sorry I hurt Madison and David. But I am glad I have Merideth. She has quickly become my best friend, lover and companion. And it sometimes scares me, to have such a close connection  to someone. I want to know when she lost her first tooth, when she found how to ride a bicycle. What she felt the first time she shot a gun. Everything. And we can spend hours just talking about stuff like that. And hours doing something else.. wonder if Zane is getting annoyed yet?

So, all beaten up, I went home and just went to sleep, I needed to heal and I didn't want to bother to shift. Still sore the day after. Merideth has been sneaking in to my apartment after Trinity falls asleep. It's been nice. Had breakfast with Zane, Faith, Grace and Kel.. Ryan. Heh, he changed his name. I like it. Fits him.
So, met this Kai person. Rubbed me the wrong way immeadiatly. Trying to greet Zane as an equal? You have got to have some balls, for that. Usually I let Zane do what he wants to, and I know very well he can take care of himself. But, I felt it was needed for Kai to understand that yeah, Zane does have a Skoll and Hati and sure, you can try that again if you don't appreciate your life. I don't care if he's Nahele's brother or not. If he is who he says he is, then he should have known better. My two cents. I am keeping an eye on this Guest. 

Also went to Fuigi's, about that rumor that was floating around about a guy with wolf eyes beat up a waiter there. Odd that they'd recognize it as wolf, but that was the rumor so we checked on it. Or I did.. . Talked to the staff and all and they described Bo. I've only seen him a couple of times, but I am pretty sure it was him, so now I have to talk with him. And from the earlier displays, it might just end up being a talk with my fists. I hate that. But, it's got to be done. Can't have our Pack run around and draw attention to ourselves like that, really. 

So, for other news. I met with Keahi at his request. And he apologised for offending me. Whudda thunk it, a vampire that can apologise. Guess the world is not flat anymore. I appreciated the gesture and I told him as much. We'll see how it goes from here. He is not half as arrogant in private as around others. Then again, he has a position that need that kind of behaviour. Glad it ain't me.

Wanted to spend some time with Merideth, she had a headache. Scott took care of it before I could get there, and Daine was in a bouncy mood. She feels.. more capeable, these days. Which only feeds her confidence. It's good to see that. Merideth only had a little bit of time before her evening classes. At least she didn't have time to poke at me with the nerf bat. Got to hear about Trinity and David. Wondering what that could have been about, to have David actually accept a challenge from a pup. And I bet Zane had to make an example of either both or one of them. Which only means... another piece of Zane needs mending. I wonder if anyone realizes that, yet? I'll get to him, maybe today. We haven't had a talk in a long time."

<lj-cut text=""Notes and ramblings"">

I have a moment to make notes for my chores. Really, that is what is on my mind. Not. 
I love her. God, how the hell did that happen anyway? How the hell did she manage to get under my skin like that, and so quickly. Yet I find, every second spent together the more I do. It's not just that she is HOT, she is smart, funny.. ok, stopping  there since it would take at least fourteen pages to mention everything I like about her. Mushy son of a bitch. 

Chores. Yeah.... 

Daine finally broke out of her seclusion, last night, to come see me. I was wondering if I had to go break down her door and grab her by the scruff, which I am sure she would have hated. I think maybe she is dealing with her issues, but she has yet to say anything to me. I am sure it has to do with the fact that Anna is here now, and she feels she can't really tell me what is going on. I have to catch her alone, for a while. Maybe take her out. Yeah, we got interruped, as I was about to pour my heart out to her. Only Daine and Anna, would ever know what I feel. Before I could tell Daine though... Merideth came. 
I just wanted to wrap myself around her and wipe away all the hurt in her eyes. 
We had hot chocolate and talked, Daine revealed some things and I'll have to talk to her. I really do. 
Spent the rest of the night holding Merideth, talking with her and just... being. Its so beyond lust, what we have, it's almost frightening. 
It was nice, to wake up with her there. But we agreed that we are not moving from where we are right now, it's too soon and we'll just take it a step at a time. 
Scott came by and gave me something to do with the Pack. It's the first time, since I was asked to join them in the retrieving of Merideth from Chicago, I've been given a task for the Pack. It makes me feel good, needed. 
So now, I have to arrange a meeting with Vivian. (Done)
Arrange a meeting with Faith. 
Talk to some of the Pack members, try to find out who caused that trouble in the restaurant. 
See if I can come up with something on this Solomon figure. 
Why or how I ended up with the task of mingling with the Vampires, I don't know. But, I suppose since I have not shown real hostility towards them, I could be a good choice. If I can just keep my thoughts to myself, anyway. 

I can still smell her. On my lips. On my skin. The mark she gave me is gone, already. Okay, I have a job to do. Hop to it. Coffee in the penthouse, first. 

Wonder if Zane and Jolene will complain. Ceiling padding. Next on my list at some point."

<lj-cut text=""Incoherent thoughts"">

I think Anna Marie is the only one who knows just how hard I fell for Merideth. I wanted to talk to Zane, but, he has enough on his plate so.. Besides, she was already involved. I could be a friend and that is what I honestly tried to be, but our joking around and all just went a little too far. 
I was right out avoiding her. Well, avoiding being alone with her, anyway. It was hard to stay away, at least with others around it was easier to just goof around. Never would turn out to be more. 
And somehow, still, we ended up in same rooms, alone and.... So many times I had to find an excuse to leave, to just pretend the playing around didn't affect me at all. 

Until last night. Figured I'd get the whole assessment thing out of the way, went over to see her and found her with Elissa. Which was good. So, we got a couple of questions away and overwith. Only a couple. I am still not sure what happened, I think me and Elissa was goofing off and Merideth sorta joined it and ended up on the floor. Her teasing, I just couldn't take it anymore. I gladly let Elissa leave so I could tell Merideth a piece of my mind. Sure, I know I have only my self to blame, playing a long with her but I doubted she knew what it did to me. Until yesterday. And I honestly did not think that she'd be feeling the same way. 

I want to take all the fault for this, but I suppose I can't. There is... something, between us, I can't even describe it. And I don't know how or why it happened, I just know... it happened. 
She could not ask me to leave, and I could not leave, so I kissed her. I didn't really think, I just.. did. And in comes Scott. Wonderful timing. When I saw that guilt in Merideth's eyes, I just turned and wanted to leave. I was so ready to beat the crap out of myself, for putting her in a position like that. And Scott made me stay, to talk to her. Maybe he sees it. He said to not throw a good thing away. I don't know. I would walk away from it, if Merideth wanted me to. 

Instead, I know she is about to tell David and Madison she can't be with them, anymore. And I am the reason for that and one part of me is happy. One part sad. And I don't know which one to give in to. All I know is, I am trying to give her the space she needs to do what she has to. Whatever it might end up to be, at the very end. I will always be here for her, friend or whatever else...

Grace told Zane today, that she was interested in someone. And it was obvious it was me. I still hadn't talked to her, so I asked if we could. She mentioned Merideth right off the bat, startling me since I didn't think anyone but Scott and Anna Marie would know. Not that it made a difference, I would not have been able to give her the attention she deserved, due to her husband and all. Sometimes, I think Mom and Dad just gave me too much morals, other times... I don't know. She took it well, I think. I like her, a lot. Wouldn't want things to change between us.

I need to get out of this apartment, it's driving me nuts to know Merideth might be talking with David and Madison, and I can't do anything for either one of them. I feel like such an ass... Maybe I should go find Anna Marie... at least I know she can listen to me ramble. And I want  to tell her everything. I need to tell *someone*."

Got up, put on the suit and prepared to do battle with the old geezers. I love these meetings, I really do. At least my day started out okay. I think I managed to tell Trinity, in my own odd way, that I like her. She is a charming woman, I hope she knows that. Also got to tickle me Kelsey, that I'll have to do again. He is very ticklish. Much more fun then tickle me Elmo. And not so red. 
Left a message for Grace to maybe have lunch, she came as I was headed out and let me know she'd meet me later.
Argued with Merideth and Scott about the whole dress business. Not happening. Nope. 

Had lunch with Grace, had a few laughs. She is very funny, I like it. Made me an offer I am so willing to jump all over now, but still. Think we need to talk. Seriously.
Hell, why am I sitting here. I am off to work out. Hah.

So, got my work out. And wouldn't you know it, Merideth manages to pin me for 1001 questions. Some of them I had to sort of ponder why she'd want to know, but hey. 
Back to my topic, when I first sat my ass down to type this. Yeah, I think I did it. Color me green now.

Old geezers are hard to convince about marketing on the Internet. Boys, you have a HOTEL CHAIN. What is t he issue here? Yes, good old fashioned ways of business is fun for like five seconds. You all drink nothing good in these board meetings anymore. What's this, fuzzy water? What the hell happened to coffee? Soda? And no, I am NOT looking at ya'll oddly for getting yourself your Crown Royal at exactly 1 minute past noon. 
Oh what the hell. Got what I wanted. Now, I still might have to plan that trip to Italy. Better bring it up to Zane. I could take a few with me, some could us a vacation. Let's all take turns, why not. 

Maybe I should just let Zane and Jolene go to Venice. I'm sure they could use  that break. Oh! Gotta call Zane. Like, now. Then call Anna Marie.

Tomorrow another day. Tonight? I think I'll go up to the roof and just look.
Haven't done that since I came here."

Got my workout, did some business. Had Lara speak in tongues with my computers. What a funny girl she is, really. Talks  to them like anyone would plants. And note for the record, she doesn't stutter half as much as she used to, and never to the computers. Note to self, don't challenge her in Doom. Network is up, don't let Zane surf on the computers. Spam blockers and viruses makes for a grumpy Ulfric when he can't reach his favorite X-rated site. Muhahaha. 

It was time for lunch and I went to the penthouse. I need to re-stock the penthouse now, and also my own kitchen. At least get a coffee maker and some water bottles.
Merideth and Grace had been shopping. I am surprised they didn't need a dump truck for all they bought. Oh, and Grace bought Merideth a dress. Like THAT will ever be worn but I can dream about it, can't I?
Grace is like a bouncy puppy these days, I love it. Think I'll take her out for lunch or something. Daytime. No intrusions from husband. And just a friendly lunch. Yeah.

I've not been so out of balance in two years. I turn around and there is Anna Marie. In the door. Of the Penthouse. Here in San Francisco. She said my name, talked to me and even touched me. God I was so scared to touch her, I thought she might disappear or something. Then I find she is a wolf. One whole year now, and no one told me. No one told me she was coming either, though apparently Donna called Zane and Zane told Scott, Merideth.. I am sure David knew, too. Top dogs and all. 
I'll have to talk with Zane about this, though, I really don't have to. He knows what happened, every little detail of it. 
It was arranged for Anna to sleep with Merideth until she can get some furniture in to her own apartment. I am still in shock. I went and checked on her last night, to see her actually sleeping across the hall. I've missed her. I am so proud of her. And I still don't know what to say or do. 

Nerf battle. I am fucked. I am NOT wearing a dress unless Merideth is, and how the fuck did I get suckered in to that anyway? I need to stay away from Merideth, she's a bad influence. 

On another note. Talk to Trinity. Go for another session of nutcracking, as thanks for her support. She does not know how much she does for some people, I think. Not just me, this time, but around that Ranch. The animals, the people who end up there. I hope we can get this in to her head, that she is something else, important part of the Pack. 

Anna Marie.. I just realized she knows *everything*. More then I can type here and more then I can tell anyone else. I wonder if I should just get her a phone and start talking to her again like that, to see if she'll answer me easier then. I'm so not a shrink, but it could work?

I have a sister again. Although not all of her, she is back in my life and I am grateful. I need to have Daine meet her.

<lj-cut text=""Ramblings of burrito wolf"">

Got to check out Merideth's Shadow. Wow, that baby is *sweet*! Has close to no mileage on it, just needs a tune up, maybe check those sparks again. Pipes. Small details that could take hours, which in turn can be so rewarding. I want to buy a bike, now. But I know I can't. I just bought a damn truck, no more personal luxury, Jared. But I can dream, yesyes. Maybe next year, we'll see how Radisson goes. If it does well, I am getting a bike. Yepp. 
So, Merideth let me ride the Shadow and didn't seem to mind too much my speed demon kicking in. Got to some park or somesuch and switched. It was wicked, she got some confidence after a while and it was... like a high, though I've never been high it has to be something like it. Made it back to the park, I had to go sniffing. It felt... good, to be so close to the trees again. Merideth was hungry, so we took a hunt. Caught a rabbit. Or, she did, anyway. We relaxed for a while, licking our chops and just enjoying *being*. Wish we could do it again, but I doubt it.

Grace seems to be doing better, that makes me glad. A very different person, and again, no lookin', lickin' or gropin', Jared! Ok, so I can look. And I will look, damn  it all, can't hurt no one. As much as I enjoyed the night with Scott... I feel like a friggin celibate munk right about now. Not that I see that change anytime soon. You and your fucking stupid ass morals, thank God no one knows. 

David finally approached me, though again it was not a Challenge for position. Skoll and Hati is equals, like brothers, and I can very easily start thinking of him as one. He just has issues with dominance, almost of any kind. I am sure there is a bad past there. If he had a gun, he'd easily shoot me. As it was, I am the more experienced one in hand to hand. He gave in and I could have forced my dominance on him, but I didn't. Simply because, he *is* my equal in so many other ways. I'll probably never let him submit to me, nor dominate me. It's odd, but I think this is the best thing for us. Course, that leads to other things that I just don't even want to think about anymore. 

Good thing we didn't get too bad, since we had New Moon Court to go to. What a show that was. I am still puzzling  that out and really, I *have* to be more diplomatic. Hothead appearing again, after years of calm meditation. I tell you what though, that Court was some bullshit. I mean, sure I understand that it's their way and all that. I can respect that. But don't mean I can like that. I'll behave, if Zane has me go again, because I know he'll ask me for just that reason. That I can behave and do my job as his Skoll. Personally, I'll prolly have to beat the shit out of something when the whole thing is done. 

Donna has been odd on the phone lately, but that is really nothing new. She says that Anna Marie has made some changes, she speaks up for herself now much more then before. But, she still wont say a word on the phone. I know she's there though, because she always hands the phone back to Donna when I am done telling her of all the happenings around here. Just a simple hello or goodbye.. it's all I ask. 
Instead I find myself pouring my love on to Daine, and she accepts it. I've not had the chance to talk much with Kelsey, but I'd probably pour just as much love on him too. 
They can't replace Anna Marie, I know that. But at least they give me hope and make me move on. I feel I can actually help and do something, that my presence is wanted. 
I need to go to Augusta..."

<lj-cut text=""TMI Read at your own peril"">
Monday:
I had a nice talk with Daine, who has now replaced Brad. Course, she don't know squat about investing or anything of the sort, but at least she can keep up with my appointments, phone calls and all that. And, she helped me buy furniture for my apartment. 
She is a funny woman, Daine. I like her. After the day of shopping, I realize that she is much like Anna Marie.. or actually, as Anna Marie once was. I called  there after shopping and spoke with Donna. She says Anna Marie is having conversations now, with Irene. Which, I should be very grateful for. If I had the time, I'd go and see how she is doing, myself. As much as I like this City, I also miss the freedom of the wild up in Maine. Oh, well. So, Daine pretty much jumped right in to her new job. Which is just what I needed. Now I need to transfer some other things on her shoulder, like meeting with that chatter box broker I have. She'll do better, if not, she can eat her. I'll give her access to my business account, makes things so much easier. Besides, its the small one. 
Came back to the apartments. Then had to run after Kelsey, since he was about to feed a newly awakened vampire. Oh what a nice bit of info that was, really. Kept my mouth shut though, which probably surprised Zane. Course, I never got  to get inside and watch over Kelsey, instead I get called back home. Grace was there, so I suppose everything was cool. 
Ran in to Merideth in the stairs, we went for a walk and talked. And I think I'll just have to start watching myself around her.
Oh, and there are were-owls. Or at least one. Whudda thunk that one up? I missed it though, sadly.

Tuesday:
Went and gave Merideth her moving in present, she looked at me like she wanted to throw the box out the window. But, guess she was pleasantly surprised when she found what was inside. Good. Trinity was there and they were talking about passing Eros' tests. Yay, perfect subject...  not. So I decided to fish at Trinity about the farm and all and before you know it, we are out there, petting these gigantic horses. And Trinity was a completely different person. I am not talking about flipping a damn coin, either, I am talking from a silver dollar to a $100 bill, difference. She was a joy to be around, even if she got me on the horse. Called Zane and asked him if he had seen her like this, and of course he had. That man can make me feel like a school boy, I swear to God. But, it's Zane and I don't mind. He said he's become Trinity's Eros, to which I am relieved to hear. She deserves the best and though I know where Zane's personal tasts are maybe a little different, he'll do what is right by her. 
I had to run off, since my nuts after that fun trip, was playing king of the hill with my tonsils at that point. No way I was about to let Merideth see me curl up and smack the ground in pain. God, I am so not having kids, apparently.
Later that evening, I ran in  to Merideth, Madison and Kellan in the penthouse. They had chicken and Madison looked like she'd been painted a permanent red. I could not help it, I had to pitch in on the teasing, I hope she was not offended by it. She's a sweet woman, I like her too, though I'd like to get to know her more. Both Madison and Kellan took off after a while, which left me with Merideth. 
I don't know if its a good thing or bad. The more I talk to her, the more I find I like her. And I even answered some of her questions about family, that night. She knows I have a sister, I don't think many does. At least, not here, less Zane told someone. But she backed off when she realized its a touchy subject. She shared some of her background too, though. Which was nice of her. She was falling asleep, since I was massaging her... and if she had not mentioned she was sleepy, I would have probably made an excuse and ran for it anyway. I don't think I should be left alone with her at all. 

Wednesday:
Loooooong ass day, to say the least. Spent most of the day arranging my stuff in my apartment, found I need to get some clothes badly and also some scented candles. That paint smell is driving me batty. 
But, I got most of my stuff done and also managed to conduct business while at it. Now I just have to ask if Lara would be interested in hooking my network up and stuff like that. Yeah, I can do it myself, half assed, but since I'll be having some sensitive info there, might as well let her make it as safe as possible. Called Merideth early in the evening, checking on her Shadow. She said it would be in soon, and sure enough, it is here! Will be fun to check it out. Went to get her, then saw her sweet ride. Drool. Nice wheels indeed. And she got her tattoo. Looked awesome, almost tempting enough to have one myself.. that is, until she said 3 hours of silver needle poking. How about.. hell no. Nothing I want on my body that deserves that kind of dedication. Got so much in to chatting, and Zane came up too, that we forgot time. It was time to heal Grace. So, a couple of Vampires a witch and clusters of wolves later, we attacked the living room and all ended up on the floor. 
Keiran, I think his name was? Yeah, he seems to know what he is doing. Give a little goosieboosie there and woohoo, we all perk up. Seriously, it seems like he knew what he was doing with Grace. Thank God, since I think she is a wonderful person thus far, but needs peace. Don't we all though?
On a more thoughtful note, should not have eaten those burritos. Damn, that shit can burn a hole through the back end of my jeans. Oh, well. We survived it. And  there are more sessions as such, in the future. Without the burrito break. 

Its now Thursday morning and I need to see if I can convince Daine to speak with the broker. Have a look around at what she has to offer. I need to get my plans approved and all that shit still, this restaurant is a few weeks away still. If not months. Good thing I got in to the Radisson deal. Covered now. Shitty thing is, I might have to go to Italy. Hmm. I'll have to talk with Zane about that. Should not be more then a week, anyway though. Hopefully, it can be later and I can bring Daine. As it is now, no way I can bring a pup with me. Sad, that. 
Off to work, now."

"event","A moment of quiet, a moment of peace. I didn't think I'd see it this soon. Yeah, I know it wont last, but I can at least enjoy it for now. 
<lj-cut>
I am currenly tapping away next to Daine, who has moved in to the Samovar Apartments. She's done a great job at her apartment, quite homey if not for the smell of paint. She seems much more relaxed, too. She asked me if I could teach her meditaion, a way to connect with her wolf and perhaps her temper. Boy, had she asked like six years ago I would have laughed. I am glad she asked and I am glad she seem to trust me. After what happened to her, I should not expect that much trust... I feel a brotherly love for her, and seeing her tonight actually made me feel proud. Proud she has come such a long way in such a short time. I hope she keeps it up. And I am grateful she let me offer, and she took the offer, for me to stay here with her tonight. I hope my presence while she sleeps might chase some nightmares away...

It's not just her I feel relaxed around these days. Scott made me dinner, we had a date without a movie. But he made up for the lack of that, he even made breakfast. A man could get spoiled with that. I feel our friendship will be a good one. A good man to have as a friend.

Merideth... What a change, after the fist fight was done. I just LOVE the way she is now more relaxed around me, I can like her sense of humor and everything. I think we are already getting along fine, which is... It feels good. I need to tell her, if I can stay serious around her for like five minutes, that I appreciate her trust and respect in me. It's not something I think she gives lightly. 

Oh, poor Trinity, by the way. I wonder if she has NEVER had a man in her life? I do not mean to make her feel uncomfortable, but wow... a more skittish wolf I think I have yet to see. I betcha if I suddenly decided to just let out a small bark, she'd jump out of her skin and run for the hills. 
I should talk more with her, ask her about these horses. Would be cool to learn more, and even better if this is something she can be relaxed about, as a conversation topic.

So, all I have seen of Nahele is people trying to force feed him. Good luck boy, hopefully you can open your mouth to voice your opinion every now and then. 
Elissa.. quick mouth and quick wit. Will be interesting. 

And Mara.. egads. When you think you can get a light tone going, she disappears in a whiff of ice particles. Ah well, I gave it a shot. Suppose she knows where to find me should she be interested in getting to know me. 

David. I think I talked to *David*, and I can probably like him quite well when he is... not so angry and out there. Hope he gets his deal together, he seems to be a good man indeed. I know he will probably challenge me at the next Lupanar meet. I am not sure how I feel about that, I'd not have a problem with just David.. But with how he can channel the munin? Who am I supposed to either be submissive to or dominate? Not that I give a shit about it, if he is stronger, he is stronger... But I doubt I can accept it if he channels the munin. And I am NOT letting him become Skoll at this point. He needs to get his shit together before he can even think about proctecting Zane. I would rather die, then let someone who can sometimes seem unstable, be Skoll to the Ulfric. Or Geri... but I believe Merideth might be able to get through to him on that one. 
The leadership of this Pack HAS to be stable and united. Hope David sees that and waits until he is more... secure, in himself. 

Met very briefly with Jolene. Wowsa, Zane. Dude you go. She is like.. hell, I almost wanted to belly crawl when I saw her. Yeah, think I need some time to get to know her at some point. Right now, I am more then happy to stay out of her path and let Zane take care of it. And I know he has GOTTA love it. Zane, I love you man, but you are one sick puppy. But I wont tell. 

Ok, I better get some sleep. Daine is already tossing a little in her sleep here."

"event","Got up early yesterday, did some meditation though it didn't seem to work too well...
<lj-cut>

I'm impressed. I mean, really impressed. Merideth knows what the hell she is doing, except being the expert paranoid of the campus. I think she's got by far more in depth knowledge of her styles though, as opposed to me who really is a brawler. I know some Capoeira, thanks to Zane. The rest is just stuff I have been working on through the years but really I only use what I can master. Merideth? Skills. Only advantage I will ever have on her is that I am bigger, know enough to be well enough rounded on all edges, perhaps a little more experience when it comes to Challenges and my wolf. She can and probably will, become a strong Alpha in time. Course, it means she's gotta be more focused on that part of herself, let it become more of a natural thing for her. 

She did me good, though. I got the work-out I wanted, she seemed to be able to get rid of some anger issues, who the hell cares about cracked nuts and broken knees, right? Ok, so I do. I better work on protecting that knee. Oh, and she knows Tai Chi, which is AWESOME. I really need to get that art down pat, I love it. Perhaps the only thing I'd actually keep doing on a regular basis aside from working out.

So, she is Geri. She will be a fine Geri, too. Got a good head on her shoulders, even as quick tempered as she might seem, a good head. Pretty head. And boy will she consider capping me in the nuts again if she finds I have an interest. That or David. Ouch. Nah, best stay neutral old boy, you live longer that way. 

Trinity is a case and a half, but I am sure everyone knows that. Guess I'll have to work on her, and all the pups really. They need this support and I guess I can start somewhere. I really need to say some things to her, but I think it would probably be best suited in private. No need to bring it up in front of everyone else, I suppose. 
Daine? I knew she was stubborn the moment I laid eyes on her, boy will she be a handful if not approached in the right way. Interesting young woman, though. Will be nice to get to know her. If I can. I hope to get a break from Challenges for a while, maybe if everyone hears about the duking out of Merideth and Jared, I am cut some slack. That would be nice. 

Mmmm... Mara. What an eye candy! Seems pretty damn unapproachable though, guess I'll at least try to make friends with her. Busy bee, like me. Guess she has a life outside the Pack. Go!! Yay! 
Which reminds me, either I will have to work harder on Brad being my assistant here, or I'll have to eat him. What a bright man but GOD how dumb. At least he cleared some time for me to be able to plunk around on the laptop a while. No bonus though.

Guess I will settle in at the new apartments, since Zane is planning on making his home there. I like the place, though I also quickly fell in love with the Mansion. Nice place. So, 7th floor. Wonder if I'll be under Zane or Scott. Somehow, I hope it's Scott. I know Zane. No sleep to be had if his Lupa is home. So I can now empty out my truck and buy furniture. Bah, sometimes a wife really does sound tempting, ya know.

So now, next step is to get my broker to get me a list of available properties to begin the work on my restaurant here. Get Radisson to accept my proposal. Keep my position as Skoll. Stay alive another day. 
I am slowly becoming a part of the Pack, the Family. It feels better now, when I walk in to the room. Time to work on that structure Zane so much likes, of course, I agree with him. So does Scott it seems. This could definitely become a very strong Pack with structure in place, everyone will have their tasks. Everyone is needed and have a place. 

Damn, it's good I don't ramble this much when in meetings and what have you. I am sure I'd make quite the impression. Ah, there is my trusty Brad, to ask me something completely off the wall again. I think I'll fire him. Or eat him. I think I am taking the rest of the day off to spend it with my new Family. Screw this."

"event","I figured I'd update myself before going all whuffie for the night. Yeah, I have to shift since well, that one nice hit Grace got it really did a number on me. Which is fine all in itself, anyone watching might think there's not much to me. Good. Since at that point there wasn't. I should have known better then to underestimate her, I guess when she once showed somewhat of a submission I took it and voila, bad knee.

<lj-cut>
And then we have Kelsey. He actually Challenged me and it hurt. I was really mad, it's been a while since that kind of hurt poked at me but hey, it's Kelsey. It wasn't a Challenge. It was Kelsey needing to blow off some steam and well, I was a handy target. I love this kid, I can say that truly and honestly. I took the steam he blew off and then I left him with Daine (who was pissed I tell ya what.. interesting) and the others. 

Spent most of the day on the phone, making sure that I could get in on the Radisson deal. Then called Bee and made sure things were fine there. I need an office, badly. And yeah, I closed out Pack for a while doing my NORMAL HUMAN thing, I worked. 
Course.. Merideth and Scott helped me pull out of that trap. We went to the new apartments and had a look. I like one of the apartments on 7th floor. I need the space, I need an office and all that. Not sure if I should make dibs yet, though. 

Talked to Zane and Merideth. She wants Geri. She can have it. The Pack trusts her, she should have it. I will take Skoll, because Zane trusts me. Me and Merideth will still have it out, which is why I am shifting. I need to heal that knee up.  
Oh and just for your information, Jared, Merideth DOES NOT NEED AN EROS! 
That was some reaction, that suggestion caused. I would apologise to her but shit, I have no idea what I am apologising for so hey. 

I did mention that me and Scott will be working out fine, right? Yeah... At least he seems to be a friend of mine, and not because he has to be or he has to accept me. I think simply because we can get a long. 

Grace came last night, only had a few words with her before I was pulled in to Zane's throne room for a chat with him and Merideth. When I came out, she was gone. Kelsey apologised to me and I made sure he knew that it was okay. Faith was there. Rrrrrrrr... well it can't hurt to LOOK now can it? Shit, I'd stare at Merideth too if I wasn't sure she'd remove my eyeballs.
No worries... Jared will be celibate for now. Bloody hell. Getting a serious case of blue b.... alright, I will maybe backspace and remove that all together. Or just leave it as a reminder."

"event","So it was good to be.. home. Called Donna as soon as I could, she is relieved to know I live and mighty impressed I escaped with not a scratch. She knows there's a few in Decker's Pack that wouldn't mind a piece of me. Nyah nyah! Ok, feel better now.
<lj-cut>
Seems like someone left the Pack a gift, while everyone was out for the Full Moon. Funny! At least someone in this City has a sense of humor, I can live with that. It's still been a little odd being back, I mean, here I am trying to consider this home and well... though accepted as Pack now, I still don't feel like home.

Getting there. 

Grace challenged me. Guess she is not as submissive as she seems, huh. Zane watched and I know I'll not hear the end of it, she almost dislocated my damn knee. This is what I get for understimating her, well deserved indeed. But I proved my point, she submitted. My wolf was ready to make it complete, but Zane not in public. Shit was that a hard pill to swallow.. and its been a while since I've felt that from my wolf. Maybe because I am tense still, I know there has to be more challenges coming and this time I will not be so ill prepared.
I'll catch up with Grace later, though of course... I have got to be a dumbass to even pursue it, she's married to a vampire for Pete's sake. Maybe I'll be able to behave. Shit.

I need to talk to Zane. Badly.

So Scott finally declared himself Freki. I say finally because from what I understand, he should and could have done so earlier. I doubt anyone would consider challenging him, the man really *cares* for the Pack and it seems he is accepting Zane, finally. If he does not like what Zane does, he need only to declare himself Fenrir, he is at a position where he can do that. 
Shit, I am not going  to challenge him. Although I think I might be able to, there is no way in hell I'd want his position right now. I have enough with trying to adjust to the Pack, I don't need to make the same waves Zane did when he got here. Which is why Zane is Zane, catch my drift? 

If Zane asks me to be his Skoll, I will take it. Simply because he is like my big brother and I'd die for him without hesitation. If he asked me to be Eros, shit I'd do that. 

But for now... I need to resume my martial arts training and work out, if I am going to face more challenges. And to top all of this off, I still have to get in touch with my broker and investment partners. I think I can schedule a meeting with the Raddisson Hotel Corp this week sometime. I definitely think I can get in on the global expansion, it would be a good investment. 

I need to make a list of the Pack members, see what I am dealing with. Didn't think I'd actually sound like Zane, typing that, but hell.. the man taught me more then self defense. 

Hehehe, Rex is such a good tag for him. I wonder if I get blingbling."

"event","So here I am, on the Jet on my way back... home. Yeah, guess it's home, now. Not a scratch on me. Everyone else is sleeping or just to hurt to talk, which is fine with me. I have not a scratch on me, which is quite impressive. At least it left me capeable to take care of the others, as much as I could anyway. 
I feel I should kick my own ass... I knew about this place but it just didn't trigger my mind until we finally got there. What a fucking dumbass, I could have done so much more I think. 
We did it though. We came. We saw. We kicked ass and left.
And Martin watched. I wonder if he recognized me. That would suck, since he knows where Donna is. And with Donna, Anna Marie. I better talk to Donna and see what she thinks.

As we are here on the jet, Scott is actually touching me and accepting my presence. I guess we are getting somewhere. Now, to see what the rest of the pack says.

Merideth is a spitfire, let me tell you. Interesting woman, to say the least. Even as sluggish as the drugs made her, I am pretty damn sure she's a strong Alpha. Something to either watch or respect, we will see. 

Even with Scott, David and Jackson... I have a sense of dread to come back home. Though not close to either one of them, at least they seem to accept me somewhat as pack.. but, how about the rest? Am I pushing too much? I think I will.. chill. Take a step away from them and do what I need to do to get settled. I'll talk to Zane. I'm taking a nap. Floor looks good."

"event","You know the saying, having ants in your pants? Oh yeah, many ants. I feel the brush of the moon and this is the first time I'll not be able to join in a hunt. I mean, a regular hunt with my packmates... Hunting something completely different now.
<lj-cut>
Sitting on a jet, somewhere in the sky. Everyone has gone about their business, though I did meet Jackson. Quiet man. But, I have no choice but to trust him. I don't know why I keep thinking he would be an excellent Bolverk, maybe something about how quiet he is. 

Scott and David... I know I will trust them. David is.. quite different from how I saw him at first. Then again, channeling the munin like he does, probably take a little bit to see the difference between him and whoever. Lewis, I think his name was, yeah. But from what Scott says, Lewis only want the best for the pack, and David, so I put a lot of faith in that.

Hmm. I can still smell the spices from Scott's hands. Nice. I think we have reached an agreement. As far as Pack business goes, we are both very careful about each other. He knows I will fight my way up to Skoll or Geri, might even go for Freki... But I don't want that, I think. Someone who has been in the pack longer should be there, to help Zane. Me, I'd be content with being his Skoll or Hati.. or even as Scott suggested, maybe Eros. Would Donna not have a kick out of that. 
Oh, and me and Scott? Personally, I can see us becoming quite close. Perhaps a little too manly the both of us to have anything past a close friendship, which I will take any day. But he is not unreasonable and has a very good head on his shoulders, I don't think I'd challenge him if he was to become Freki or Geri. He is just what Zane needs. 

So I listened in when they talked about Madison. Yepp, definitely a thing there between David and Madison. Where Merideth fits in, I would only assume to the other side of David. I think they might underestimate her, but who am I to make such a call. They are right, I don't know her... though we had a nice talk before we left. She will do what needs to be done, whatever reactions she might have after or before, she will not hesitate to do her duties to the pack as both wolf and Eranthe. But, again that is just my humble opinion. (I admit it, my opinions are rarely humble)

Again, I say... What is UP with the females of this Pack and the Vampires? Alright, Grace and Faith. Indeed tied to some Vampires. Average Joe-Jared must behave. Aubrey is feeding a Lee and.. whatever else. Awesome. Trinity wishes to be one of those hopefuls, sliding up next to Faith spot with Hariel. Whooopie. And then there is Madison, who is Keahi's Pomme. 
I give up. Really, I do. On another note on that, we are not required to feed them, it's a choice. I like that. I like that a lot. Nothing personal against them and all, but when I can meet their gaze and all... takes some of the fun out of the whole deal really. 

Getting antsy again. We are trying to hack out a plan. And this piece of shit laptop is threatening to shut down on me, I forgot to charge the sucker. Damn. 
Well, here's to hoping to survive Chicago, AGAIN. I need some peanuts. Wonder how Daine is doing on her first shift. Is it odd of me to say I miss Kelsey. I like that kid. Paternal, me? Hell, Donna would crack up. Stupid laptop, stop beeping at me."

Scott asked me if Zane had told me about going to Chicago. Checked my messages, there was none. So, I can only assume that Zane asked Scott to ask me to go. Of which, of course I will. I shouldn't even bother unpacking the truck for a few weeks, who knows what might come out of this. Gods I hope she is alright, I don't know Merideth but I know she is important to the Pack. With everything else, as small as it is, I don't think Zane or the Pack needs more stress right now.

On another note, I think I might have gotten somewhere with some of the Pack. Of course, just before I leave and all.. maybe they are just being nice to a man that might just die for them in Chicago.
Met Faith, Grace's sister. Both very beautiful women, definitely stirrings of interest... until *SLAP* No touchytouchy! They are married and engaged to vampires. What the hell, can't a regular Joe get a sliver of a change around here? Ah, well.
Mara.. she is a nut to crack. Not that I want to push her, I like her... curious about her past, though, but I can wait. Probably someone I'd have at my back if I ever gained her trust.
Scott. From what I can gather, he is gay. Wow. It's like they say, why the handsome men? Answer: Because guys goes for looks too?
I learned a few things about him, and he learned a few things about me. We have a long way  to go, but I think I will like Scott a lot. Let's hope it will be mutual.
Madison confuses the snot out of me, yet she doesn't. She is from what I understand, a healer and Eranthe. Damn shy Eranthe but that could be exactly why she is the Eranthe. I know Donna was pretty damn subtle, too... So, she is Alpha, I know that.. but damn is she withdrawn or shy or submissive? I know she is worried about Merideth and definitely David. A three way there, I sense? And if it is a three way, shit I wouldn't want to be in her shoes. Talk about feeling like an outsider. I offered my sympathy and help, but really... I am leaving as well so what good am I?

Oh my God, Kelsey... I don't think anyone has managed to get under my skin like he just did. He has no idea how close to home he got, with his single whisper to my ear and then he actually touched me. Is it possible to feel instant love, proctectivness and pride in someone? Cause I have no other way of explaining it. I will lay down my life for this kid, and I have known him shy of 48 hours. I could barely hold my tears back, and as I knew it was Kelsey... God I wish Anna Marie could do the same. I wait for that day... Until that happens, I have Kelsey. By what he did, how he is and what he said... I know I can wait for Anna Marie. It will be worth it.

I wonder if I can steal a couple of Zane's cookies and take them on the plane. I'd be far enough away he could not beat the tail off of me if I did, and maybe he'd forget about  the whole deal when we bring Merideth back? If he told Rita, I'd get a good earlicking by phone though. Oh the choices.
Now, I gotta make some calls and make sure my affairs are in order, then I am packing my puny little backpack and laptop. Next confession will be on the plane, I am sure.
Shit, things happen fast around here. Note to self, take time to get your thoughts together, Jared. And stop ogling Grace and Faith, less you wish to meet an unfortunate run in with the undead. Go for the ones you know wont cause you untimely death! At least, stay neutral for now. Yeah, I know I'm talking to myself. Donna would be so proud. Shit, gotta get ready for the flight."

"event","So yesterday, after leaving Daine in Mara's capeable paws, I went back out to walk. I needed to walk. Daine reminded me of the fact that I have not even tried to talk to Anna Marie. I am such an ass, I feel like an ass... shit.
I called Donna and asked how she is doing. She still wont let anyone but Donna and Irene touch her. Only reason she lets Irene touch her is because she is the new Eranthe, Donna claims she is getting too old. Bullshit. Anyway, I think Donna has settled for taking care of Anna Marie. She still will not talk to me. It hurts. Finally got Donna back on the phone after I told Anna Marie, or I assume she would listen, anyway, about everything that has happened in my life so far since I last spoke with her. 

Donna said she'd hang up on me again, if I did not get why she hung up the first time. So here I was, hanging at the corner of an unknown street, trying to explain to this woman why she hung up on me. No wonder I'm not married, one moment I think I have the puzzle solved, the next. VROOM. Like an airplane over my head, just the whiff of jet-fuel left to make me ponder.

I did apparently manage to tell her what she wanted to hear, though, and I have thought about it ever since. Can't possibly be looking good, that an old friend of Zane's is suddenly showing up, just as he became Ulfric. I am trying to look at it from the other end, here, and I would probably raise hell if I was in their shoes. Shit. I'm surprised no one has challenged it, yet. And of course, Donna had to point out that since she knows me, she probably knows how I just wandered in there, expecting instant trust and friendship *because* of the fact that I know Zane. And I did. I hate it when she is right and she's not even here. 
(Send flowers to Donna and thank her)
So. Here I am, in a new Pack, even if I know the Ulfric, it's a new Pack. Three times is a charm? I don't think I want to leave, this time. But I am not going to fuck this up by assuming I will easily slide in with everyone. I've done this before and I will have to do it again... Even if Zane did offer me to be his second, third, Skoll... whichever. I have to say no. I can not let it be handed to me, I have to earn my own respect and trust from the Pack. I have to know them. 

Shit, there is too much going on in my head, right now. I need to go work out or something. Maybe I can convince Zane to teach me more of that dancing martial art stuff. At least it makes you sweat. 
I need to make friends. I know I have Zane but he has enough on his plate. Damn I am not thinking straight. Get some tea. Go work out. Yeah. Good."

"event","Got a good nights sleep. Not bad, considering I slept in a room full of strangers, but nonetheless... felt good. Went out really early  to have breakfast and make some calls. Davis' says they found Daine's car, which by the time they got to it was completely stripped. Big surprise there. No other news on that end.. 

So, I mentioned my first few hours with Donna. She said to slap myself in the face and think, then she hung up on me. Boy, if anyone can make me feel like a 13-year old caught with his hands down his shorts.. and over the phone. Damn.

So I went to Denny's, met a hot chick. Yeah, yeah... Daine came, too. So I had great company, even if Daine was like strung like a string, pluck here and there and it could break. But, overall... the Pack has done great already, making her not feel like an outsider. Unlike me, of course. 

Finally made it back to the Penthouse, after having a jolly good time talking about my ideas for the new restaurant. I think it will work good, here. Now to check on my other investments, too. I am glad I bought this laptop, really I am. 
So anyway, ran in to Grace again, and Scott. Grace actually greeted me, which was nice. Course, she seemed out of sorts when I first met her.. like many in the Pack. Now that I know Decker has gone done a big boo boo, I see why. Great timing, Jared. Absolutely awesome. Oh, and there was a Vampire. Apparently he is Grace's husband. Owch. To each their... that is not right. Whatever rocks your boat, I guess. 
They disappeared soon enough, so did Scott. Which left me with Daine and having to explain what happened to her. I had her call her sponsor, of which I must say, was an excellent choice by Zane. Mara... Did not talk much with her, but I have no doubt she'll be an excellent sponsor for Daine.
The whole thing reminded me to call home, again. At least Daine has not pushed anyone away, yet. Good."

"event","Man, I am tired. But I finally made it to San Francisco! Did I mention I just love these new wheels I decided to buy? Uh huh, yes I do, much much. Since Zane was busy when I hit the City limit, I called Grace. Nice voice and clear directions. Impressive, since most of the women I know could not tell me the way to my ass without saying a whole lot of things that has nothing to do with it. Yepp, I am sure you know what I mean. Hah.
Anyway, found where they all hung out and Zane introduced me to his inner clique, as he called it. Scott, Grace, Madison, David and.. I think David's pshychic half? Or, color me pink if that was not the munin or somesuch. Interesting bunch, especially David. When he is all there, I think I like how he thinks. Ah, guess time will tell. And talk about timing for me  to come there, I should have a gold star or something. 

Oh,yeah. Finally met Daine, too. Guess we need to sit and talk, apparently she doesn't know much about what happened to her. I am so relieved they got to her before something happened, at least on that they are quite swift. Awesome. 
Met this kid, too. Kelsey. Scared as if someone has been kicking him a few times. Very young. 
Decided to crash in the penthouse, since everyone else did. I can't wait to meet Zane's Lupa, either. She's got to be something else. 
Anyway, I better get some sleep now. Long day tomorrow. I think I will refrain from calling my realtor until I am sure I have the time to deal with it. For now, I'll just place myself within Zane's hand. Good to know that he at least has one he can trust, though it seems to me the pack has adjusted alright to him being Ulfric. Not that that surprises me. 

Oh yeah. Bed. Or mattress, whichever. It will be better then sleeping in the truck."

"event","So I decided to buy a car and take the drive to San Francisco, the bus is too uncomfortable and with all the shit I am dragging with me... Rita said she'd take care of my house, I told her the pack can use it. As well as the getaway in Maine, course, they will have to go through Donna to get to that one anyway. Just finished packing up my things, got everything to fit in the brand new Avalance outside... All I need to do now is go bid my farewells to everyone and leave my keys with Rita. I dropped by the Bee yesterday, it's already looking good. 

On a totally different note. Got a message from this Daine, she made it to San Francisco. Good. Hopefully Zane got my message and is taking care of it, not that I worried. One of the things I admire Zane for, is his way of dealing with new pups and such things. Yeah, getting out of here now. Putting the laptop in the truck."

"event","Finally! I tell you, since you are my new and trusted laptop, that its been *tense* since Zane left. One would think that Godfrey would chill just a little bit, right? Naaaw. Like I'd want to take his place, anyway. Zane has too much respect for the man, and I have too much respect for Zane. I am by far too young to be taking over anything. Sheesh.
So, anyway. Finally got someone to run the Bee's Nest for me, I'll only need to come back here perhaps a couple of times a year. Realtor in San Francisco is hopeful on a place, as well. So, I finally got hold of Zane and told him I am coming over. Wonder how this will be taken over there. Hopefully, they will accept me and I can gain their trust. Zane sounds like he needs a break and I'd love to give that to him. 

On another note. I had a call from a Daine Waynes, after I got a call from Donna. Christ, I hope she'll be alright until I can get to the City. From what I understand, she hasn't even shifted yet. I better give Zane a heads up, damn..."

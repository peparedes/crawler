There were hundreds of crosses planted into the grass on the main walkway. Of course there could have been more, if there had been more room. Not even considering the thousands of innocent Iraqi citizens who've died. <br /><br />Thank you, George Fuck-Up Bush, for starting a war that hasn't changed a single thing besides affecting millions of people in heart-breaking ways.</div>"

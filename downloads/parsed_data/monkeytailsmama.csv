Adam is in Iraq now. he wants to come home, i dont belame him, i want him home too! i've decided that im not going to move in with him untill he his divorced. it just doesnt feel right if we live together and hes married to my sister. once hes divorced ill feel ALOT better about living with him! i told him in an email about it, so hopefully that will get him to get his butt moving on serving her. i know hes in Iraq and things are very hard for him to do but when hes home he can start doing something to end this retarted thing they started!!! well im not feelin good so im headed to bed!! nighty"

"event","well i've been very odd lately and i'd love to know whats wrong with me. it could just be stress (about whats im not sure), it could be because i havent heard from adam yet, it could be numerous of things. im always tired, but can never sleep, yet when i do actually sleep i either have a bad dream, someone calls or texts me, the baby wakes me upp, or i just dont get a good nights sleep. all i ever want to do is stay in and lay on the couch. i sit at the computer alot too. i do play with anthony but while im laying on the couch. i just dont feel like myself. i feel like a part of me is missing and i dont understand how. yea i know adam is in Iraq, but i thought i kept a good enough distance from him so that i wouldnt get heart broken. i guess i didnt. i love to spend money that i dont have. well i do but i really cant afford to keep spending all this money with the bills i got. i only have a few but they are all expensive bills. i dunno. i hope i get better soon before i ruin my life and get too fat and all that shit. i gotta go. lees"

"event","its driving me insane that adam has not called yet! i understand hes actually in the war now but damn it, fucking call and let us know your there and everything is OK!!! even if its just one second, like ring ring (lisa) ""hello?"" (adam)""im fine ill call you when i have more time"" and thats it! i'd fucking hate it and have something to say about it but atleast i'd know hes alright. ya know?? 
so i talked to melissa lastnight. shes supposedly bipolar, and shes finally going to one of those wierdo docs. i dont think shes bipolar but i do think shes crazy. lol. i basically told her lastnight that i want things to be cool between us and im not asking for her to accept me and adam nor am i asking for permission, but im asking that we'll be able to sit in the same room/place, and be able to talk like sisters. she agreed, lets see how long this lasts. im already babysitting for her. unbelieveable. its ok tho i dont spend much time with AJ. hes walking all over the place and falls every two seconds and cries and i laugh at him. lol. i think its so funny when babies start walking, they fall SOOOO much!! hehe. i know i was like that once but i didnt see it, nor do i remember it. and i think i would have laughed at myself!! 
so before i move to florida me and tays are gonna get a tattoo, matching ones im guessing. i dont know if im gonna put mine where she wants to put hers but when we go do it we'll figure it out. well i must go cuz AJ is cranking it. ttyl ~lees~"

"event","so adams got to be in Iraq now, probably already on missions. i havent talked to him in 3 days and im really worried. i know hes probably fine but to hear his voice would make it alot better. i go online hopeing that he'll pop on for even a minute, but nothing, i hang on to my cell like its an actual part of me, waiting for him to call, and i get nothing. everytime it rings the normal ring my heart starts racing, and usually its tinx. lol. i dont know why her ringer ID hasent been coming on. all i know is that i miss him. i want him home so badly. lastnight i had a ""bad dream"". it was horrible. i woke up crying it felt that real. i got a call from mah and she told me that his flight didnt make it to Iraq. so i wasent thinking that she ment it went down, so i asked questions and she was crying and i was like why are you crying and she goes do you realize what im trying to tell you? and she was almost screaming at me. i was like no, no hes not. i hung up the phone and next thing i know i was talking to someone who was with his unit and i said to her how do you know he is dead, did you find him? and shes like well we are 90% sure, since it is under water. so i was screaming and crying at her and telling her to let me find him and that hes all i got and then i woke up! thank you anthony! it was one of those dreams that i kept trying to wake up from but i couldnt. it felt so real. i woke up not only crying but shaking. i NEED a phone call from him. its driving me insane. i cant do this. i can not move on with my life as normal with him over there. it was different when he was just training but now im scared. scared for him, scared for us, scared for myself. i wish that he'd come home after a few months of being over there for good! anyways im gonna go do something with my pathetic self. later. lisa
i love you adam with everything i have....."

"event","so the party went pretty good if only anthony would have gone to sleep. i really think something is going on with missy and john. hes a good guy tho, so good for her. the funny part is that missy and adam got married, john was the best man and i was the maid of honor. how ironic, huh? everything in my body is killing me!! i dont even feel like i over worked things to make them hurt they just hurt, and pretty friggen bad too. lastnight was the first night since adam left that i slept. i went to bed a lil bit after 11 took me a lil while to fall asleep, then the baby woke me up at like 3am and i was up after that. that sucked. i probably would have slept the whole night if he stayed asleep. then thoughts went through my head about adam, and him going to Iraq. and thoughts about if im doing the right thing about waiting for him, just the same old things. i musta fell back asleep since ant woke me up at 8!! oh well. maybe it will get better for me. i hope. well i have to get ready for work, byis..Lees"

Strangers making the most of the dark
Two by two their bodies become one

I see you through the smokey air
Can't you feel the weight of my stare
You're so close but still a world away
What i'm dying to say, is that

I'm crazy for you
Touch me once and you'll know it's true
I never wanted anyone like this
It's all brand new, you'll feel it in my kiss

I'm crazy for you, crazy for you

Trying hard to control my heart
I walk over to where you are
Eye to eye we need no words at all

Slowly now we begin to move
Every breath i'm deeper into you
Soon we two are standing still in time
If you read my mind, you'll see

its been 2 days since adam left. i've been so depressed. i dont know how the hell i am gonna go on with my life knowing hes over there fighting and me not knowing if hes ok. atleast while he was in training i had more confidence that he was gonna be ok and i'd see him again. right now i dont have much. is that bad? shouldnt i have confidence that ill see him again? melissa is making everything even worse on me. she wont stop her shit. i want to kill her so fucking bad. i have never been pissed off longer then probably my longest was like an hour, and here i am like 24hrs later and still pissed off at her. WTF! why is she belaming me? yea im with him but that doesnt mean i have control over him. which i do have some sort of control over him but i DONT use it, only on his smoking and drinking. but thats to better our relationship. if i smoked and he wanted me to stop i'd hope he'd use all the power hes got to get me to quit if he didnt like it. im sure he still smokes here and there. im not dumb. but hes doing so good. he wont smoke infront of me. im not sure if thats a good thing or bad thing. its kinda hiding it from me, but i know if i ask him he'll tell me if he is or not. but anyways yea im not gonna use my ""control"" or ""power"" on him to make him see his son. thats something missy needs to get to him about. not me! i have my own problems with my sons father not seeing him. if i cant force mark then theres no way i can force adam. hes his own person, hes going to do what he wants when he wants and thats the bottom line!! just like me. im gonna stay with adam weather my family likes it or not. i dont fucking care what they think. well i do care but i love him and he makes me so fucking happy, why would i want to give it up? i really do see us having an awesome life together once we are on our own. im gonna work my ass off and make as much money as i can for the next yr and when he gets back we are gonna roll in the dough and live it up. as long as he doesnt spend his money stupidly and same goes for me! i mean i will be sending for my nieces and nephews and of course tay and uncle joey, and i also want to hit cali to see rozie. thats a hugh ticket bill. well im off to bed. wish me luck for tomorrow at dads/johns party! since melissa is gonna be there and who knows if shes gonna start her shit or not. hopefully for johns sake she doesnt. actually for her sake cuz ill kill her!! anyways night night!!

PLEASE LET HIM COME HOME SAFE!!! john was saying something about hoping they only go for a 6 month deployment, but mah said no, they are gonna be gone for a yr. adam told me today in the car that its no longer then a yr but could be less. he doesnt know yet. when i was leaving him at the airport he looked at me and grabbed my hand and said im gonna marry you someday. if he treats me the way he treated me on this leave theres not a doubt in my mind, i will marry him. i dont even want to get married! but im telling you, he made me feel like i was worth something in this life, something no guy has ever did. i love him so much, my love is so strong for him. i gotta go.....Lees"

the other night while i was laying in bed, i looked at adam and he was sleeping. i watched him for a lil bit as i had thoughts racing through my head like usual. if he didnt marry my sister i'd love to marry him. i know im against marrige, but no guy has ever made me feel like i was special. i dont want to lose that. i know i dont have to marry him to keep it though and that makes things so much easier. but if the day ever comes that we decide to, i wouldnt want it with anyone else. the reason im so against it with him is because of missy. i dont want to let him know that tho. well i must go. lisa"

(funny thing is that i used to go there too!!) then we went back to the hotel and OMG do i love that hotel! we had a balcony and was able to look out at the water, see the bridge, and the boat called something i cant remember. it was so peaceful. i slept til like 10 am, havent done that since i was 19. went shopping this morning. awesome time with adam. hes so good to me and i have no idea why. but its not a bad thing. i like it ALOT! hes in conn. right now and im missing him so bad. i dont know what im gonna do when hes gone for the yr. good thing is that he gets leave in 6months. so that will be awesome. hes gonna come down to florida for part of his leave so we can be together!! im gonna do something special for him next leave. im already planning it. its probably going to take the whole 6 months to get planned. he deserves so much. hes such a good guy. im so friggen relaxed right now. i SO needed lastnight. i really wish we had more time. the weekend would have been awesome. i dont think i woulda wanted to come back to the life i lead right here. cuz right now im so wishing i had the life i had lastnight EVERYNIGHT. and it was only one night! lol. its one night ill NEVER forget. thats one night that will stay with me forever. thanks adam, and thanks tays for taking ant.   i love you guys!!!!

BUT they dont have our soldiers! my little monkey is SO cranky. i wanna shoot myself in the head! how did lisa die? a bullet, IN THE HEAD!lol. realistic but still funny. so lastnight i was laying there and all of a sudden i hear something that sounded like metal bending in all the wrong ways. scraping and CRASH! yup. ""Wheres my shoes?"" anyways on 37 there was a crash. but i wasent sure if it really was because when i was looking out my window i couldnt see anything and no one was slowing down. untill i seen one car stop and back up. then i knew it was a crash. so i threw my sneakers on, cuz you know we love car accidents, and went out to look. by the time i got there ambulance's were there and cops and hazard trucks and fire trucks were on the way. i couldnt really see anything cuz everything was surrounding the car. so since i couldnt see the excitment i went back home and back to bed. i still wonder what the fuck happend. this thing was fucking LOUD! but no one on my street came out! which i think is SO odd. it was 12am, but still, something that loud that woke me up? the apartments are closer then me so someone should have came out. oh well. guess thats why i like dane cook. im one of those people that say ""fuck the shoes! im going out bare foot!""

NEVER! i dont understand how carol could support something so fucking sick, but shes sick herself so...i guess that would explain it. sometimes i wish i never went with mark but i do have to say that i did have a great time while it lasted. i may still love him but i know it will never work out between us. hopefully things will work out with me and adam, better then me and mark. im hoping to achieve everything i never achieved in a relationship, with adam. i gotta go.

YUCKY!! i dont know what to do about something i got myself into. i talked to jeff one night and i told him i'd call him the next day, and he said ok well if you do call then i know. (meaning that he'd have a chance with me). well i didnt call him. but then melissa called me and asked me why i didnt call scotty yet and blah blah blah, so i hung up on her and called him just so i didnt have to hear it. well then i got really bored lastnight and called him up. well he texted me a lil while ago and asked me how my day was and i texted him back. he said he'd call if he gets the chance (hes working). heres my problem, i think he thinks hes got a chance. the thing is that i do like him. BUT! i love adam, and im still not over mark! big hugh fucking problem! adam comes home in, well im not gonna count today since its basically over, 8 more days! so im gonna have adam, and im gonna have jeff calling me. my cousin is gonna be pissed at me when adam comes home. for one, ill be spending time with adam, and probably not talking to jeff, for two adam....need i say more? we all know what happend when he found out last time. o gezz. i dont understand why guys like me. theres nothing good about me. i play with guys heads and mess them all up and drop them. i've always been like this. thats why i've had so many bfs. i get sick of one guy and move to the next. the only guy i never got sick of was mark! (im not sick of adam either, but i mean past bfs). i dunno what im gonna do. i've been thinking of stopping things with adam, untill he comes home for good. i still want to talk to him while hes over seas and i still want to be with him when he comes home, i just dont want the commitment. i feel tied down and i dont like it. i hope he understands. i love him so much and dont want to lose him. i want to be with HIM! i dont want to hurt him, so i think this will be a good thing?? i still have questions about it. and i still have time to think about it, but the only way ill be able to feel confident on my decision is to talk to adam about it, face to face. its too easy to hang up a phone and never talk to me again, which is not what i want. atleast him face to face with me, he will know that i really do care about him and love him and respect him. atleast i hope. well im off im gonna watch some tv, and hope that adam calls me tonight!

WTF!!! its 11:17 right now and my fucking mother just called my house!! wtf is wrong with her?? anthony has only been sick for the last three fucking days, lets call the house and WAKE HIM UP!! fucking idiot! then she makes me wake him up cuz she ""needs to talk to him"". keep in mind that was slurred cuz once again shes fucking drunk. i cant move to florida with them! i cant fucking do it! i need to do everything and anything i can to keep my ass here untill adam comes home and we get our own place. omg! then she wonders why i cant stand talking to her! anyways im off cuz now im in a pissed off mood! nighty"

I mean yea uncle joey shouldnt have left tays name out, but i understand that he probably got nervous. hes still in love with tay, its written all over his face, so i can see where it would come from. tays got all the right in the world to be upset about him leaving her out, but the way she acted was kinda fucked. 17 isnt really underage for joe!! and thats where i see the jealousy in her. its not that hes dating or anything i see it as she still has it in her head that he is hers and she can run his life. but she cant anymore. i woulda rather talked to her about this rather then write it in here cuz i know shes gonna read this and get mad, but i had to get it out. and shes got no reason to get mad at me anyways, cuz im not saying anything that i wouldnt say to her face. anyways, off that subject, they made the people at the resturant sing to me!! i had the baby on my lap so i made it a big deal for him!

HE CALLED!! so i told him about it, and hes like wow, know whats weird, i sleep on my stomach. so i guess from now on im going to have to force myself to sleep on my stomach so he calls me EVERYNIGHT!!! i told him about anthony getting stuck between the fridge and the wall, he laughed. i was like yea i made him stay there untill i took a picture, he laughed even harder! SO HA TAY! im not that bad of a person!! everyone else laughs at it except you, wait, U EVEN LAUGHED!! so stop saying all that nasty shAt! i was just happy to talk to him longer then 5 mins. i got a sore throat this morning, i really hope i dont have mono. that would just suck. well im out, tty, lees!"

"event","i've been thinking alot about me and adam. i love him, im just not sure exactly how much i love him. maybe im just scared cuz i know its getting closer to him going overseas. i dont want to lose him! I havent really talked to him in like a month, or so it feels. not sure exactly how long its been. just feels like forever. i miss him SOOOOO FRUCKING MUCH!! i obviously love him alot, but why am i so scared to let myself? part of the reason i know is because i've been hurt so much in the past, and another thing is that my family dont like him. i just wish they could accept this. maybe that would make it a little easier on me. im still hiding him! i dont want to hide him. i just want to be with him. i dont know what to do anymore...."

"event","sounded like a good subject to me! i dont have much to say tonight. just the usual i miss my soldier, and i cant fucking wait for him to come home!! all i want to do is talk to him for longer then 10 mins. i want him back in georgia!! i talked to him every friggen night and got to talk to him online! now i get basically nothing. i really dont even feel like i have a boyfriend which is probably why i looked to pick up a guy the other night. thanks tay for being there!! one way is very lucky that i have her to keep me in line!! i probably woulda took or went home with one of those guys. that woulda ended me and one way and then i'd regret my bday and going to get drunk, and i'd be more miserable then i already am. i have that stupid CCRI testing tomorrow. icky!! so im off to bed so ill have some sorta chance to stay up during it! lots of luvs, Lee~~"

"event","i had a very bad day yesterday having a hangover and all, i went to bed hoping that my soldier would call me and HE DID!!! I LOVE HIM SSSSSSSSOOOOOOOOO MUCH!!! we didnt get to talk much cuz they got ""attacked"". at first one way just stayed on the phone with me and hey i wasent going to argue! then he HAD to go. it sucked! i went back to bed, pretty happy even tho we got to talk for 5 mins. a lil bit later he called AGAIN!! YAY! we didnt stay on the phone long, like usual. it was SO nice to hear his voice. he kinda sounded pissed off lastnight. he told me he was just tired which thats what it coulda been but he really sounded PISSED! i cant wait untill im able to actually talk to him. lastnight was great even tho total i talked to him for maybe less then 10 mins. i want longer damn it. for now, ill take whatever i can get. even if he calls and says he loves me and hangs up. (i hope he never does that tho, that will make my mind think BAD things) 22 more days to go then i'll be able to see him! i cant wait! and my tays gets to meet feley, YAY!! things with them are going perty nifty! thats so friggen cool. adam really likes feley so im taking it as feley must be a good guy. then again, adam thought collins was a good guy, and we all know what happend with that. but this is alot different. im so happy for tay. even tho i get jealous that shes able to talk to feley more then i can talk to one way. ::sighs:: its ok tho. they need to get to know eachother, and all that fun new relationship shAt. thats the thing that sucks with me and adam since we've ""been together"" we havent been together. so our relationship is gonna be new untill hes home for good! as so will tays and keiths!! well im outta here. have to go do my work clothes, horray for me i get to go deal with nasty ass target today. luvs~Lees~"

"event","i really dont know what to do. im so depressed lately! i havent talked to adam in a few days, last i've even heard from him was the IM he left me saying it was a bad day. what the hell was that supposed to mean? it coulda ment anything. i know how busy he is, and know he cant always be there when i want him to, but its very hard to live with! i've never had to deal with anything like this before. when i wanted to talk to my man all i had to do was call, and i cant call him. i never get to see him, it just sucks. sometimes i just wish that i never told him how i felt cuz then maybe i wouldnt feel like this. atleast if i didnt tell him i wouldnt know how he felt and i'd probably be fine?? i just miss him so much. im gonna go nutts when he goes over seas. i get to see him for a week in 27 days, but i want to see him NOW! i dont want him to go!! am i being selfish? i just dont think im going to last while hes over there. its hard on me now, im stressed out, im gaining weight that i've never had before, i always have headaches (thinking its stress related), im only happy (or atleast pretending to be) when im with tay, or around people. when im alone, i just want to sit here and cry. im wicked depressed!!! i knew what i was getting myself into when i started this but i really didnt think it would be like this. i dunno. im going to bed. nighty. ~lees~

P.S. Im very happy for you tay, just make sure your ready to deal with this shit that im going through. (although it might be easier for you since you dont love keith) (YET) i really hope things work you for you guys!!! i luvs ya tayslor!!"

"event","this day was pretty good, i do have to say. finally feley called tays! she was so happy! im wicked happy for her! she needs to move on with her life, and get over my cousin, although i cant say she ever will. i still love mark, and if she feels the same way about hen then shes gonna be just like me. i love mark but im not IN love with him anymore. i can say i hate him all i want but if he was to die i know id cry. come on i loved the kid since i was little, and my feeling were so strong that its gonna take alot of time for me to get totally over him. anyways off that subject, i still havent heard from adam, which sucks! i miss him! i wish he'd call me. it doesnt matter the time, even if im asleep!! i just want to hear his voice and know that hes ok. even if he calls for 2 mins, i mean ill be upset that i couldnt talk to him but not as upset as i am when he doesnt call. i know he cant call every single day but its hard to love someone and hardly get to talk to him. its hard enough that i cant see him at all never mind not being able to talk to him. well im off to bed. when im sleeping i feel alot better!! nighty ya'll!  BTW, YANKS WON AGAIN!! 4-3 thanks to my jeter! HELLS YES!! tomorrow, 1:05pm, they play the sux again! i get out of work at 1, so ill only miss a little bit of it!! YAY!!

"event","AAAAHHHH!! i fucking missed him online! and from the looks of it hes not going to be able to call me tonight! the thing thats got me like this is that he said its a bad day there. WTF does that mean? is he ok? did someone get hurt? i just want to talk to him to know that hes alright. im waiting right by the phone, but no call. it sucks! im online, waiting, hoping that he will come on, but it doesnt look like its going to happen. damn it! things never go the way i want them to. i guess thats part of my life that i have to deal with. 
on another note, justin (one ways bro) has been acting VERY weird! hes all like, i dont even know how to explain it. he says hes not depressed but he seems to be. i know that his father is over seas and that its tough but he chooses not to talk to him. he wont write his father letters, or anything. hes 16yrs old and he worries me. im not sure exactly what im so worried about, cuz i dont believe he will do anything to hurt himself. but when you dont believe sometimes thats when it happends. im not gonna stress it out tho. im stressed out enough! too much! i wish i wasent this stressed out. sometimes i dont think clearly and just want to give up everything that i've worked for and everything that im trying so ahrd to achieve. (as in adam, and my dreams) i want to fly a plane so badly! i want to model off clothes, even the ugly looking things that i'd never wear! i want to give my son the life he deserves. i wish i had him later on in life, when my life was already settled in. i dont regret him at all, just wish things were different. anyways im off byi. ~lee~"

"event","i wish there was an easy way out of everything. if only just one time i could be happy for a whole day. what i would do to be happy for a whole day!! im good at pretending to be happy when really im missing something. my last entry tells what im missing. i miss adam. he makes me feel so good. on the days that i dont get to talk to him im all down and yucky, and moody! i feel so down today. especially since one way hasent called. i know he cant call everyday but im not used to being in love and never having that person around. never knowing what hes doing, how he is, anything! i HATE it! i just want him with me! thats all i want, but i guess thats too much to ask right now. i've promised myself not to get in this too deep cuz if anything was to happen to him im gonna be wreaked! (one more promise i didnt keep. i love him so much! i never thought i'd love again after mark, but im greatful that i kept my head up, i have to thank my son for that! if it wasent for that little boy i'd be lying in a ditch somewhere cuz when me and mark broke up i thought it was the end of the world. now that im with adam, and he treats me so good, i look back at what i had with mark, and nothing compares to this. yes i was in love with mark and i truly believe he was in love with me, but we grew apart as alot of couples do. i hope that doesnt happen to me and adam. anyways im off to bed gotta get up early tomorrow, got work, yuck! peace and hair grease! ~lee~

"event","today was interesting. that fucking little girl that marks dating or fucking or whatever they have going on, IMed me and started a bunch of shit. obviously she has no idea who shes fucking with. she put my son in the middle of it!! i want this girl DEAD!! i fucking hate her with everything i have! first of all she has NO room to talk, so i dont know why she even bothers to open her mouth. she must think im scared of her or something, but just wait till danyal gets a hold of her on monday!! yay! im not scared of no fucking 15yr old. i'd still fight her even if i didnt think i had a chance just to prove that i wasent scared, the only reason im not fighting her, well theres a lil more then one, but the main one is i will not go to jail for her. shes not worth it, mark can go to jail as much as he wants for her, but me, nope! my other reasons involve my son and are obvious reasons. but im not gonna stress on it, shes nothing to me, shes gonna get whats coming to her and thats the end of it!
on another note, Henry came over!! im so happy that me and him are getting along again! hes going to get me a job with him at the Y! i cant wait till i leave target! but it depends on my hrs at the Y, cuz i want to have two jobs and if i can have a morning job from like 8-12 that would be good, then i'd go to work at the y from 2-6!! found out Feleys name today! its keith. i really hope that good comes out of this with him and tay. that would be awesome. he sent tay pics of him. hes a cute kid. i would allow her to date him, i think. i dont really know him but adam said hes a good guy. now she needs to get her butt moving and send him some pics of her! she says shes ugly but i dont think so at all! im pretty confident that if she sent him pics of her and they start talking somethings gonna spark. i dont know why i got this confidence, maybe cuz i want to see her happy, but im hoping what i feel is true. i told her i'd take a pic with her so she could send it but she said that she doesnt want to go against me (not in those exact words cuz i dont remember the exact words but..)she says im better looking then her but i really dont think so. she needs more self confidence. see its like this, i think im fat and no one else does, i dont think im all that pretty but alot of people do, so im really not one to talk about self confidence cuz i dont have much of my own. so i feel her on that one. i wish she'd see that she is pretty tho. well anyways maybe ill talk her into sending her hs pic, i think she looks good in it. wish me luck! shes got to send him something!! lol, wish me luck!! peace and hair grease ~lee~"

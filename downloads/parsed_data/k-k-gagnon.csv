<P>i'm amazed at the ease at which i got my license, no wonder we have so many car accidents and so many crazy people on the roads. all you have to do is a three point turn and back straight. i hadn't done a single three point turn until my driving test. </P>

"event","<P>Its so hard to know that everything I'm watching is changing, gradually. And when I look at everyone elses lives, and see their change I don't know how they cope with it, how do people continue with the knowledge of everything not being secure.&nbsp; I know that in two years my sister will not be living with me, and we will spend six months away from each other-there will be an entire ocean in between us, and I know that in two years I will be going to college, and expecting the same great things I have seen Stephanie experience. But I know that I will be let down, because the college experiences that I will be expecting have already happened. The people that I was around most of middle school and high school, the people that you're suppose to be with during these&nbsp;college experiences &nbsp;have already been there and done that. </P>
<P>I guess that I am finally realizing that I'm about to take the biggest step of life&nbsp;that I have ever taken.</P>
<P>And ' I've got this feeling that there is something that I missed ', when I was growing up with Stephanie and Ryan and&nbsp;Adam. I feel like there was that space in time when I was suppose to find my Ryan and my Adam, but I didn't because I was with the Ryan and Adam that I knew, the three of them leaving for college just wasn't something that I grasped.</P>
<P>Big Step.</P>
<P>' I can do most anything '. I can find this in people my age, I can find genuine openess, genuine happiness. </P>
<P>This is the strong part of being strong.</P>
<P>' This could be the very moment I realize that I am alive, all these places feel like home '</P>

I have practiced my spanish speaking skills, with the help of my dad's employees, gotten so close to my sister I can't even think about the fact that she has less than 60 days left before school, and my biggest accomplishment, with the help of my Mom's best friend Mary, is understanding that 'the only two things that your parents can give you, are wings to fly off and explore the world,and roots, to stay grounded and centered.'

and then I thought about how awesome it is going to be when i get married and i can have sex when ever i want.

and then i thought about my knees, and my hips.
i have knees like an 82year old man.
and hips like my grandmothers before she got surgery.

what if the first some i have sex my knee blows out. 
or my hip snaps and im stuck in the same position for a few hours. 

To my future husband, or dream man that comes along before marriage:

I apoligize for having bad bones, its part of my diesease and I feel bad that your sex will not always be amazing."

"event","Your Birthdate: April 27 
Your birth on the 27th day of the month (9 energy) adds a tone of selflessness and humanitarianism to your life path. 
Certainly, you are one who can work very well with people, but at the same time you need a good bit of time to be by yourself to rest and meditate. 
There is a very humanistic and philanthropic approach in most of things that you do. 

This birthday helps you be broadminded, tolerant, generous and very cooperative. 
You are the type of person who uses persuasion rather than force to achieve your ends.
You tend to be very sensitive to others' needs and feelings, and you able to give much in the way of friendship without expecting a lot in return."

i wonder if your away message was to me, and if it was that makes me happy.
and i think about you alot, not because i want to do it again but because i worry that the only love you will ever accept is the love you get from a girlfriend. and i don't want you to be lost when you need someone but youre to afraid to call. 

and today while i was looking for lg's phone number, i was afraid i had erased it after a smartass comment. 
and then i looked under sir william cosby, and let me just say, i have never been more happy to see that name."

"event","but im learning to deal with it. 
because at the end of the day, 
when i have to put you to bed,
i ask myslef why i even came down to check on you.

you're always in the same state. 

and when i make plans with you, 
and your friends call,
the friends that feed you along with this crap,
i ask myself why i did this.

and then i remeber.

the times you're not like this
are the times i love you most
and when you are not around them
its obvious to everyone 
that you are better than that.
                               you are better than them.

i just wish that i could help you
because in some odd way you have never been more
beautiful
more lucky
or more full of love
and life.

but i know that if i keep trying to help you
if i keep repeating my steps
                              i am stuck in the exact same place you are
and after three years of this relationship with you
listening to you complain
and guilt me into everything
and string me along

im ready to take different steps
and do my thing
and i know that if i am lucky
and if you are meant to go futher than this
someday 
someone
besides me
will notice, and take it in to thought.

and that would be the most amazing day of my life.
because i miss you more than i miss the things that you took away from me."

<P>im so excited.</P>
<P>i can start moving in this thursday. </P>
<P>yesterday my dad and mom and i went to lowes and picked out paint sploches. and i think im leaning towards the orange-brownish-blue side more that the yellow-white-blue side. i'm going to have to call jamie on this one, she is really good at these things. </P>
<P>anyways i got some pies to make, and i have to trim the patio before everyone gets here. </P>
<P>have a great memorial day. </P>

And I'm really happy.
Sure I may have a biology project due in three hours, and I still have to make note cards for three more chapters in c&e, and my self-portrait in art is looking pretty shabby-but I got it.
I got the life.
I got the family.
And once again I got the slap in the face that my friends really do like me-enought to call at 10 and invite me to breakfast-so I need to chill.
Because I got lots a things that most people don't."

"event","Sometimes when I'm at school and I'm with boys that I've had classes with for years I just want to kiss them, not because of a crush but just to see how good a kisser they are. 
That's what I though about all day today after exams-there were two boys in my biology class, and one in geometry class.
What can I say I'm a lipwhore, I think about kissing alot.
And if I were to kiss a boy and he were a terrible kisser and then I saw him with a girlfriend a few months later and I wouldn't be able to feel bad for her b/c of how horrible a kisser he is-b/c maybe she would like his kisses-I hope she would.
It's just another example of how I think you can't look at a couple and feel bad for the boy because the girl is annoying or has bad breath, or vice versa, because maybe he dosent think she is annoying or maybe he likes her bad breath.
Maybe Britney Spears influenced my thoughts today-she and kevin kissed on t.v. and I would have been realy excited but the camera was horrible and my dad was sitting beside me.
I hope everyone that has a boyfriend or a girlfriend likes there kisses."

And then I realize that they're friends with everyone and there is a part of me that stops myself then.

I've been in <FONT color=#ff0000>love</FONT> with Easter sense I was a little girl, I think it was because of the cool cakes my <FONT color=#ffcc33>GG </FONT>made in the shapes of bunnies and eggs and pound cakes with green coconut and jelly-bellies on top. Anyway, sense my <FONT color=#ffcc33>GG </FONT>isn't here anymore I make the cakes and we celebrate with cousins and family friends. It's awesome, totally non-traditonal. We have food from all over the world and sense I'm the youngest kid we do have easter egg hunts, we pass a big bowl of eggs around and everyone picks and opens them together. Well this year it was a bit more adulty than i thought. I&nbsp; got a <FONT color=#3333ff>condom</FONT> and <FONT color=#3366ff>ky gell.</FONT><FONT color=#993399> which makes me wonder: what happened to the <FONT color=#ffcc00>eggs</FONT>? and the <FONT color=#66ff99>easter dresses</FONT>? and getting all&nbsp;dressed up for the <FONT color=#ff6666>family pictures</FONT>? and the&nbsp; <FONT color=#cc66cc>games </FONT>we used to paly? <FONT color=#000000>and will i get a condom and ky for easter for the rest of my life</FONT>?</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#993399>ugh. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#993399>Oh! Good news, I'm moving! </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#993399>Well, I hope everyone had a <FONT color=#ff6666>great easter</FONT>. <FONT color=#3333ff>God bless</FONT>. And have a<FONT color=#009900> safe spring break</FONT>.</FONT></P>"

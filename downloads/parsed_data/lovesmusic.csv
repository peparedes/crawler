That's my busy schedule. Recital attendance all depends on if there are recitals, and we need 10 per semester on whatever days they are offered, so basically I don't have class on Fridays. :) Lunch is a scramble on Tuesdays and Thursdays, but it works out. 

Now I need to go finish getting ready, because today Mason is playing Hofstra and the game's on ESPN! We're rehearsing at 2:30, doing a pregame show thing at 3:00, and the game starts at 4:00. I'm really excited! GO MASON! The Pep Band recently got about a dozen new songs, which include Pump It, Funky Town, Brickhouse, and other awesome ones. I play tenor sax in it, and it's great to play some fun music and have some time away from Bb clarinet. Playing in clarinet quartet does the same thing, I play bass clarinet in it and it's something new and refreshing.

After the game, Amber and I are making dinner for us and Staisy: chicken parmigiana and spaghetti! Then we're watching a movie and I probably should do a bit of homework. Tomorrow, I'm not going to Flutopia because it's Amber's birthday and we're going to Cafe Mozart in DC for dessert with a bunch of her friends, which should be a fun time. :)

Bye!"

"event","Yesterday was by birthday, and it was a really fun day. My classes weren't too bad at all, and I ended at 4:15ish. Then I called my mom, dad, and Jocelyn to talk before going with my suitemate Katherine to a pre-game Hoops Night for sophomores and juniors, which was basically free pizza and drinks before the men's basketball game vs Delaware. Then I watched the game, and Mason won 89-59. Woot! It was awesome, there were a bunch of great plays like 2 alley-oops and a span where we must have hit about 5 three-pointers in a row. 

After the game, a bunch of people came over to my apartment and we had a cake. We all just talked about random stuff, but it was a lot of fun to laugh and just chill with my friends. Around 12:30 AM everyone left to end the birthday celebration. All in all, it was a great day.

Right now, I'm writing this while not paying attention to my MSOM 302 professor take spend 5 minutes per powerpoint slide. Information systems seems interesting, but we've had 4 classes, and were just getting out of the introduction and into chapter one! The syllabus said we should be on Chapter 3. Talk about boring. I did English homework last class, and now just surfing the net and writing this. Hehe.

After Information Systems, I have a clarinet lesson, then wind symphony. In wind symphony, though there were no auditions, we had new people from my studio join the clarinet section, so we had to redistribute parts. Now I'm playing first part! Yay! Other music news, I finally got with it and joined Pep Band. I'll be playing in the game on Saturday. At 8 PM tonight, I have my first clarinet quartet rehearsal! I'm really excited, I'm playing bass clarinet for this piece, and Dr. Jones is preparing a forty-minute program for us when we audition at a competition at VMEA next fall. Its with Rob, Tony, and Libby, which are all pretty cool people.

In other random news, I renewed my domain in December, and haven't done a thing with it. I think next year I'm gonna not renew, and just use here as my main blog. I was reluctantly to let it go this time because I really like having a domain to do graphic stuff with. I realized that if end up missing a blog on an actual domain, I can make a subdomain on my photo gallery domain. That would be a lot better than keeping two domains that each only get a minimal amount of usage.

Okay, I think I'll pay a little bit attention to class now. Til next time!"

"event","Hello,

Yesterday, I found the Holiday Wishes Community, and think it's so great! Here is my <a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/holiday_wishes/488239.html"">wishlist</a>. Already I've got a bunch of wishes granted, and I've done a few myself. 

I've determined that I really should start writing in here more often. I get really busy, but when I do blog I remember how good it feels to write what's on my mind. My website is clearly lacking as well, and I need to decide if it's worth keeping it. We'll see.

I go home on Wednesday for Thanksgiving Break! I'm so excited to see my family, sisters and dogs! Plus, I'll get to me the new addition to the family, Ayla Paige, my first cousin's new baby born I think the first week in November. Another reason I can't wait to go home is to get out of this apartment. It is seriously driving me batty.

But, all 6 of us girls living together finally did something we should have done in the very first week of school - have a meeting! Lately, it's been awful, no one is cleaning, and there's a lot of pent up frustration and anger between a lot of us. I've had my share of issues with Staisy. Basically, rooming together was the worst idea. We've gone from really close friends, to friends, to roommates who don't talk to each other anymore. It's sad, but I'm not that concerned because I feel (and this is supported by other friends) that Staisy has changed a lot. I thought she was really serious about doing well in her major, in music and her classes, but her priorities have changed a lot. She's not person I became friends with, and that's upsetting. Part of solving the apartment problem is I'm switching with Katherine who's another suitemate. Now Amber and I, the quiet ones who actually care about getting sleep and doing work in quiet, can be together and Katherine and Staisy can be loud together instead of spreading it throughout the entire apartment. We aired everything out last night, and came up with a cleaning schedule so everything's getting back to being okay now.

My lesson today with Dr. Jones aggravated me on all levels. He is pretty unreasonable when it comes to certain things. I admit, I could have tried to get an accompanist for my recital and jury a bit sooner, but I did my best with the craziness of my schedule. I have 2 lessons left after Thanksgiving Break, one of them is for the scale jury, and one is to hear my with my accompanist. But, we ran into problems because my accompanist cannot come during my lesson time. So, if Dr. Jones comes to our Wednesday rehearsal, that means he's technically coming to one more lesson than he has to. And it was this huge issue that I was trying to sort out, until Dr. Jones says things like ""there's always people that wait til the last minute to this sort out with an accompanist"", or, ""it's better when all of this is worked out in advanced"" very condescendingly, in other words saying it was my fault that we were running into this problem.

And what it really comes down to is that Dr. Jones wants to hear us with our accompanists, but isn't willing to be flexible and spend an additional one hour than he normally would have, because he isn't getting paid for it. He said ""if everyone does what you want to do I'd be down 600 dollars"" and I responded to him ""well, would you like me to pay you out of pocket for the extra lesson?"". To that he replied no, but I was this close to getting fed up with everything always seeming to be my fault when it comes to these things. We're all to blame, I couldn't find an accompanist soon enough, my accompanist is an adjunct professor with a 2 year old son who can't be at GMU all the time, and Dr. J is adjunct who can't be here all the time either. And the thing is, Dr. Jones would already be coming to GMU for masterclass, and we'd rehearse right before it. I'm not wasting him a trip, just an hour of his time that <i>he</i> wants to use so he can hear me play! Ugh, it's a huge mess, and I hate when all of a sudden he puts the blame all on himself instead of trying to reach a compromise (oh, no...it's <i>my</i> fault for being an adjunct professor and not being able to be hear all the time, yada yada yada). 

I'm seriously considering writing a type-written letter to submit with the required teacher evaluation that we have to fill out in order to get our jury grades. That way, I can take the time sort out my thoughts and not put bogus positive things on my form so I can get my grade and leave. It's the first time I've really been aggravated with Dr. Jones in a while, but stuff like this where I was being made to feel like crap, I'm just not going to take anymore. I've worked my ass off this semester, and the whole accompanist deal is the damn school's problem, because no pianist wants to fricken do it. 

Phew, end of my rant. I should be going, I've spent a lot of my time today on livejournal, reading peoples wishes, etc. and have music history and theory to study for. Bye!"

"event","I don't blog much here or at my own site much anymore, but I've decided to keep the trend of posting once every couple months for my own amusement (as well as give me an excuse to change my layout...) I like it now, the colors are bright and fun and am using a new icon from such_stuff icons of Hugh Laurie/House. This Tuesday Season 3 starts! Yay! I'm very excited because the Season 2 finale was awesome and I'm interested to see the directions in which all the characters go in. Plus, I'm kind of warming up to House/Cameron (even though Stacey was only on for a couple episodes, I absolutely love Stacey/House, so it's taken a while) so I'm look forward to that too. In other  TV related news, Season 2 of Grey's Anatomy comes out on DVD September 12, which I will definitely be getting because there are many episodes from that season that I missed or want to watch over again. Extremely excited for that show to start too.

First week of classes is done here at GMU, and now we have a long weekend because of Labor Day. I have a bunch of reading to do for various classes, so that should keep me busy. Plus, I'm borrowing my friend/roomie Staisy's Will and Grace DVD sets, because that show is so amazing and I honestly don't know why I never watched it when it was on the air! Cleaning also needs to be done today, I already did dishes and picked up the living room area - still have the bathroom and my own room. (I'm beginning to find that out of the six of us rooming together, Amber, Staisy and I are the cleaners - that's all I'll say or I'll start writing this huge long post that I don't really need to get into). I want to get things somewhat clean so I can take pictures and put them in my gallery, then email the link to my mom so she can see what all of us did with the place. 

My apartment does rock though. It's one campus, close to the music building, we have a living area, kitchenette, bathroom, and double bedrooms that are rectangular and they way they're set up, make you feel like you have your own space from your roomie. My roomies are nice, though we do need to have a meeting on some things like noise and cleaning. But that's pretty much it!

I think before I get to babbling too much about school, TV, or roomies, I'm gonna go watch some Will & Grace episodes!"

"event","Wow, I've really been neglecting livejournal. It's mainly because I don't post in my site blog too often, so when I post there I don't want to repeat myself in here. Though, I don't think I'll stop using this just because I can post in the open and post stuff that's completely private, which I can't do on my site. I should be getting ready now, but I'm being lazy. And I'm trying out this firefox extension that lets me post to my blogs just by opening up firefox and clicking a button. And since I'm on the web a lot of the time, it's alot easier than having to login to my blogs or go to a different page. I'm always looking for things to make my blogging easier. 

Eventually I think I'm gonna change the look of my livejournal again, though I'm pretty content on how it looks. I envy the people who can understand how to make their own layouts using livejournal. I also should open up Adobe Photoshop CS and try it out...Jocelyn got it for me and I need to see if my PS 7 brushes will work in it...if not, I'm screwed, lol. Maybe I'll make my own icon from the pictures I took at the Bahamas, which I need to get on my computer and put into my gallery anyway. If you're bored, my gallery is <a href=""http://lifeinslowmotion.net"">here</a>.

Now I have a half an hour to get ready...better get going!<title>Untitled</title>"

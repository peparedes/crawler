"event","So it's carnival...and I am packing to go home.  What!?!?!?! I kinda wish my birthday weekend wasn't interrupted by this Renee Flemming concert. So...a lot has been going on lately-the three shows are finally finished.  But now I'm way behind in everything else, and I have no motivation or want to do any more work for the rest of the year.  Life seems to be just verry stagnant lately. I sort of feel like I'm just going through motions of things, and never really want to do anything.  I'm off to the airport in an hour or so...so this entry is short. But I was just reading Emily's live journal and realized that I have not updated mine in FOREVER.  And I actually could care less...but this is kinda theraputical.  Ok, the rambling session is now over."

"event","So I could not sleep a wink last night-because of Melanie YELLING things out in her sleep(!, jk) and me thinking too much.  I woke up every ten minutes. Dance was tough since I am so beat, but you know what?  I like going.  Even though I am sick and tired, I still like going. But one thing about dance that I don't like...I am sick of Buddy bitching at us about not being aggressive.  If there are some of us that are not, tell them. Don't yell at the whole class.  I find it to be innappropriate and a pain.  But...I still love Buddy :) 

So Morgan and I talked about life after dance for a while, and I realized how great it is to have friends that you can relate to.  And ones that understand and want to hear about your ups AND downs.  Thank god for people like her!-there are many of you out there :)  

On another note...me, Em, Morgan and Les are going to goodwill today.  Hopefully when we leave we will be stocked with items that make us into HOT MAMMAS.  Yay for gross old ugly clothes!!!!"

"event","So here are some lyrics that I heard today that are very beautiful.


Before I gaze at you again
I'll need a time for tears
Before I gaze at you again
Let hours turn to years
I have so much forgetting to do
Before I try to gaze again at you

Stay away until you cross my mind barely once a day
Stay away until I wake and find I can smile and say

That I shall gaze at you again
Without a blush or qualm
My eyes will shine like new again
My manner poised and calm
Stay far away, My love, far away
Till I forget I gazed at you today.


It's ""Before I Gaze at You Again"" from Camelot. MMMM. 

Ok so besides that, all I have been doing lately is rehearsing.  It is getting annoying and tiring-because I get all ADD and cannot just sit and watch and not talk when I am sitting off stage for hours. On another note...spring break is in 10 days.  10 DAYS!!!!!!  I cannot believe it. I have dreams about it I am so excited!!!!   Ok yinz...hit me up on my cell these days.  I love you all :)"

"event","So today was a beautiful day in Pittsburgh.  It actually was one of the few days that I enjoy it...so that is very good!  It was so nice, that I was walking around with no coat and smiling everywhere I walked.  I looked like an idiot, but I did not care!  I looked like the happy ice cream girl-muahaha. ;)  

So tap was pissing me off today. I can only sort of do pick ups normally, and since I was so freaking sore, I could not do them AT ALL. But actually, I do not care. Yeah I just decided, I don't care!  But as far as regular dance goes...I hate waking up in the morning, and I get nervous every time we have to go across the floor...but I like it.  I know I look like a fool doing everything because I am so big, but again...I do not care.  I do most of it right, and have fun doing it.  But I am also pissed about the rods in my back-I never knew how many limitations they would cause me when I had them put in.  I mean, of course I did not have a choice-it was either get them, or DIE!!!! So I got them..but they just suck ass. And my right upper back randomly feels like there's fire on it because of the surgery.  Ah! 

Ummm...I cannot wait to get out of here for spring break.  I feel like I am under water all the time with work and rehearsals.  There is always something going on, and most of the time I do not want to do it.  I can't wait to just have that 8 hour drive home by myself to just listen to music and chill out. And then I can see my mommy for a whole week!!!!!!!  Going away to school really made me appreciate her.  She is now my favorite person and my best friend-sad and sappy...but you gotta love family :)  Plus, she is in grad school for counseling so she is like my therapist and I love it.  She lets me know when I am being ridiculous and what not.  PS-the current situation...I am NOT being anything of the sort-I am completely right and will deal with it as I am now-by cutting it out for now.

So I know this entry is really random and a bit rambly...but I am just in that kind of a mood!  I have to go get copies of my headshots taken tomorrow-ugh, I hate going to kinko's and making copies because I look Mexican in the copies-but I do what I have to do I guess!  Oh, and here are some lyrics to the song that I am listening to right now...and I am obsessed.  I have been since last semester but I just ""rediscovered"" it.
  
how stupid could I be
a simpleton could see
that you're no good for me
but you're the only one I see

love has made me a fool
it set me on fire and watched as I floundered
unable to speak
except to cry out and wait for your answer
but you come around in your time
speaking of fabulous places
create an oasis
dries up as soon as you're gone
you leave me here burning
in this desert without you

everything changes
everything falls apart
can't stop to feel myself losing control
but deep in my senses I know


MMMMM...Sarah McLachlan's ""Stupid.""  Her new album is so amazing-if you don't have it, you are missing out.  Ok I am off to bed since it is too late for this girl who has 830 dance.  But before I got....Elise, I do not want to be the Indian Chief from Peter Pan!!!! You'd better change that now!!!! :)"

"event","Ok so tonight Leslie and I were going to be social and show our faces at THE most happening party of the night-the Lunar Gala thingy.  Mind you it is 1230 when we decide to go, but we still did. So we get dolled up, and drive over.  We park in a pay lot, and stroll over to the club to find many police officers looking quite angry.  Then there are many ""oranges"" looking really mad and pissed off and they start yelling at the cops and asking questions.  So Les and I listen in for a while, and find that the party is closed and NOBODY is allowed in.  It was probably the funniest thing ever.  Some girl was spazzing out and yelling and swearing, and some homeless looking guy got arrested.  Les, the little devil, tried to see if we could sneak in...but cops were rampant.  SO before we got arrested, we payed 8 million dollars for parking our car for 5 minutes, and headed out.  All in all, it was the BIGGEST waste of our time.  However, it was hysterical to hang out with Les. When that girl wants to act drunk..boy, can she!(No I do not want to go ice skating on the soccer field!!!!) 

So I had the most ghetto night ever. I hope I painted a good picture for you :) It is 2 am. I have church in a few hours.  Goodnight."

"event","So if you are single...you can look at a day like today two ways.  You can look at it as a lonely sucky day, or as one where you pity those who DO have a significant other.  BECAUSE they have to spend the WHOLE day with them while you get to go party and get wasted.  By the way, thank you to Jeanice for the idea-it is incredible.

I went to see ""Love Actually"" last night.  It was my second time, and I have to admit it was cuter than ever.  Not to mention that my husband, Hugh, was in it. But you know...watching that movie also made me realize what I am missing out on. It will happen sometime I hope.  But for now, I must go spend my life at recitals!!!! Happy Valentine's Day everyone!!!!!! Hope you have fun :)"

"event","Ok, so have I ever mentioned that I hate lying more than anything else in the world?  And yes, I DO consider keeping things from me lying.  So, if you do not want to piss me off, or hurt me, DON'T LIE.  Especially when I KNOW you are lying.  That's even worse.  

On another note, dance was carazy today.  Buddy kept making us do the same exercises, OVER and OVER if somebody was not doing it right.  So therefore, we spent 8 million hours doing the same damn thing. But...I liked it. I had fun-I kinda like dance.  

PS-I am still really mad about the lying thing.  What is so hard about telling the truth?  And if you are close friends with someone, shouldn't they be able to tell you things that are important to them?  And even the little everyday things, shouldn't they be able to tell you those, too?  Is that really so much to ask? That your close friends share things with you? I mean, even the woman that works at the CK's Pretzel place shares more about her life with me than some people I know(not mentioning names)...""If I'm is a hoongrih, I's a gonna eat me's a sumptin!""  It makes me feel like shit.  And so does being lied to. Get the point?

To those of you who this journal entry might scare...I am just really angry right now, I am not normally this horrible :)"

"event","THE SECRET LIFE OF THE DICHOTOMY

<i>Our exclusive report as we follow this division into two strongly contested groups, classes, opinions etc, this problem in which there is a clear split or difference of opinion, around down and into the studio.</i>

-New emo and old emo never really come face to face, but they're an opposition, not a progression.


""antidisestablishmentarianism""       ""disestablishmentarianism""

-Something ol' Dichotomy's been working on.  Classic yet modest: infamy vs. obscurity, extremism vs. restraint, the hype vs. reality.


hawks         doves

-Notice that plurality adds a whole new meaning to this piece.  Self-referential, of course: here, Dichotomy [far lower left] is having the time of its life at an American costume party.


walking      talking

-Ah, you might say, as we thought but not aloud: these aren't opposites.  In fact, you can even do them at the same time.  But Dichotomy brought us around to its point of view.  Consider that two people who are walking and talking are forced to synchronise their states of being to such an extent that their activity is commingled and dependent.  The two states are no longer in an active relationship between disparate conditions as they are merged.  Consider simultaneous equations from your high school days.  Either the lines intersect, or they never meet, or they are the same line.  In the second case, the concepts cannot be analysed relative to each other; similarly in the third case.  But in the first, they oppose.  Same with walking and talking.  Dichotomy has a tenacious grip.

you want to save the world             you want a list of more new things

-Says it all, really.

Thank you, D."

<i>to the tune of Jonie Mitchell's 'Both Sides'</i>

I like the way you don't look back
To see me standing on the stairs
Watching you down the road,

Or on wrongs I once did to you
That used to streak my face at nights.
Now, in my dreams, your frequency is merrier,
Your presence generous, as your actions have been.

These are the stories that you tell:
The facts, only half-unpacked, and crafted
As if my knowledge would complete them; 
Fictions performed in full, with song and dance
And riddles whose solution is designed
To prove their maker master.

I am illogical, inconsistent, impulsive
Yet what you like in me
Is how you make sense to me.

Now and forever
And I see
Over your shoulder lie only the great.
The march of science and the quirks of fate."

"event","So, with an instinctive-but-questioning grasp of reality, the child or young one cottons on to this danger.  In the in-between places, people can be displaced.  She doesn't know that word.  What she knows is re-placed.  

She waits outside the changing rooms for her mother to pull through the danger and come out smiling and unscathed, exactly the same person as before, and quite unknowing.  

How can she be innocent of the danger, how can she not know?

But this isn't something you are told.  It isn't even whispered at.  It is simply a secret that people find out, each alone.  When people have numbers and orders and records, it is possible to get lost in the structure, without the official papers and figures, and then your only choice is to steal someone else's place.

There is no way of getting back, not unless you're more cunning than anyone can survive to be.

II.

The child waits outside the cubicle.  She imagines another woman secretly entering and forcing her mother out into placelessness.  She could even be an Indian woman, the child thinks seriously, because the displaced have an indeterminable means of trading skills to the depths of deception.  You can make yourself look Eastern or white if you choose, it's only half difficult.

The mother opens the door, clothes draped over her arm.  The child takes the other arm and leads her back through the mall.

""Mummy,"" she says, ""Don't use telephone boxes.  Don't use lifts.  Don't use rooms without any windows.""

The mother looks down at the girl, sadly.  ""No dear,"" she says.  ""I won't."""

"event","So the one looks at the other.  He leans in a little on the round vinyl chair, spreads his hands in an open fan, and says, ""So the vampire and the werewolf meet in a bar...""

""Should that be a joke?"" replies the other.  He has white hair, streaked with black as if someone took charcoal and dragged it down from the top of his head on all sides.  

""Should it be?"" the first one mimics.  His eyes are alight and alive.

They don't laugh."

"event","On the story.

One day, two young men got into a car.  Leon was driving.  Amos leaned his head out of the window as they backed down the driveway, then checked the side mirror and glanced around as they started down the road.  A chronic back-seat driver, but a silent one.  Leon noticed, and didn't notice at the same time, because he'd seen Amos do it so many times before.  

""Let's have some music,"" he said, reaching for the back seat at the first intersection.

""No,"" said Amos, ""wait until we get on the highway.""  

""Okay,"" said Leon, and headed through the shops, seeing with half an eye the thinning rush of office workers finishing their morning tea breaks.  They might be in Taupo by the end of the day.  They could find somewhere to crash with Leon's heavy metal friends."

"event","Ironically, my first public post is the threads of a story held together by apples.  Perhaps the next one will be about pixies.  And, again, maybe not.

This one begins when two young men get into a car and drive out of town.  It's about the one young man's girlfriend (who lives in another city).  The young man has heard some confusing things about what she's up to.  Along the way they make a couple of stops, but this isn't either a road story or the kind of story where trouble piles on trouble and that propels the plot.  The other young man has a friend for whom he makes a detour; the friend has a snotty younger brother. There is an Apple computer and possibly some Beatles music.  

Also an attempt to fulfil the conditions of Sam's Suburbs writing challenge."

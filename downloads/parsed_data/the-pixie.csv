"event","<p>I've had a cold now going on a week.  It's so frustrating because I feel that I've kicked the majority of it, but I'm still coughing and feeling pretty fatigued.  It look everything out of me to walk the dog tonight.  I want to get out and do things, I just don't feel like I have the energy to do so.  Hopefully I can kick it before the weekend.  Bear is supposed to be coming down this weekend so we can get our taxes done.  The Ren Faire is going on this weekend as well and it's pet weekend, so I figured we would drag Daryl out to that...oh yeah, and we'll possibly bring Buttercup and Leia with us as well. :)  </p><p><span style=""font-size: x-small;""><i>Posted via <a href=""http://m.livejournal.com/ipad/link"">LiveJournal app for iPad</a>.</i></span></p>"

"event","<p>Wow, it's been forever since I've used my LiveJournal account.  But then, this last year I haven't felt much like posting.  I have felt lost over the last year; however I feel like my cocoon is finally starting to become less restrictive and hopefully this 42nd year since my birth will be one filled with the answers of ""life, the universe, and everything"".  I had someone yesterday tell me that this is the year that *I* am the answer to these things.  In a way, I think that they were right, because my life and the perception on it is based upon all my actions and reactions.  </p><p>So, how was my birthday yesterday?  Considering I was by myself, it actually was one heck of a good day filled with a lot of love.  I couldn't have felt more like people were thinking about me.  The day started off with me getting up and opening cards and presents.  Aunt Patty had sent a card.  Mom and Dad sent a very touching card along with some money to go do something with.  Barbara had sent a card, telling me she missed me, and sending 2 presents that contained a steamer, socks, and a tea pot that used flowering tea.  Bonnie, Milo, and Daniel sent a turtle statue that lights up at night.  It's currently sitting in my garden and I think about them every night when I go outside to walk the cat around the pool.  David, Linda, Gabe, Kai, Maki, and Teddy gave me boots which have flowers all around them.  I immediately put these on with my tri-fecta pink socks and sported them all day.    I had ordered flowers for my parents for the day and had also ordered myself flowers.  I had told the florists to surprise me and he brought a beautiful bouquet of stargazer lillies, red roses, and mums around 10:00.  At 11:00, there was a box placed on my front door.  Amazon had delivered a present from Buttercup.  It was a TARDIS Yatzee game.  Something I had requested on Amazon.  I also had a few boxes delivered at noon, that being a doctor who themed gift I had gotten myself and a spoon bracelet (I had tried to anticipate how the day was going to be, and I figured that if at all else, I was going to have a few things I purchased to unwrap on my birthday).  </p><p>Noon came quickly.  I had contractors over to look at the repairs that were needed to my ceilings due to water damage last year.  Amazingly, the said they would honor the quote they gave last year when they fixed my roof (yeah!).  As I was talking to them, the door bell rang.  Daryl was standing there with a box of Gigi's cupcakes and a small present.  I talked with him for a small bit and then went inside.  Finished up my conversations with the contractor and gave him a check.  Then went upstairs with the goodies.  I opened the present to find a beautiful butterfly pin.  I pinned it onto my shirt and wore it for the rest of the day. </p><p>Around 5:00 pm, the doorbell rang again.  UPS man this time.  He was delivering presents from Bear, who sent me some note cards and pepermint oil. Finally at 6:00 pm, the doorbell rang the final time.  This time it was the Fedex men who was gracing my door.  He left a dozen roses, all colors, from my co-workers, along with a small teddy bear and chocolates. </p><p>As all of this was going on during the day, I was constantly being pinged on my phone with updates from Facebook of people wishing me a happy birthday.  I had also receive a telephone call from my mother; my little brother and sister-in-law singing happy birthday; and Mike Burger wanting to give me a personal reach out on my birthday.  </p><p>Overall, I really couldn't have asked for a better birthday.  Even though I was alone, I really didn't feel alone.  I felt the love of everyone reaching out and wanting to make sure that my birthday was an extra special one.  I couldn't have asked for more on my birthday. </p><p><span style=""font-size: x-small;""><i>Posted via <a href=""http://m.livejournal.com/ipad/link"">LiveJournal app for iPad</a>.</i></span></p>"

"event","I've been silent for a few weeks..  There has been a lot going on, and it has been swirling in my head.. Bear's last day at work was on Friday..  He had his exit interview and they told him that the documentation he would need to sign would come today.. It did.. Blah, blah, blah, won't sue us, blah, blah, blah, will get your benefit package then...  The one thing that stinks is that in the past they told him that if he got re-employeed that he would get to keep his benefit package.. They're not doing that with this cut.  If you get re-employeed you have to refund the benefit package minus the # of weeks you were unemployeed.  So, it's basically like a paid vacation that you have to write a super large check back to the company if they re-employee you..  

On a good note, my last patient to enroll into my clinical trial happened last Friday.. Yeah!  Means we're gearing up to finish up the trial and look at the data to see if the compound does what we think it does.. Always an exciting time..

On a crappy note, I had my final review today.. Was a great review, however I was informed that I probably would be moved into the ""larger pool"" of people when our reorg happens next year..  Means that I'm going to have to fight to establish myself again and also fight possible for a job (it was mentioned today that I should hold off on coming back to Indy because I may need to interview in person next month with the groups :( )... I'm just praying we're both not unemployeed at the same time..  

On a good front.. I got an unexpected present last week.. Good friends sent a fruit bouquet.. They said they were worried about me and though I needed a little cheer. :)  I love my friends..  Also, Xmas presents are all bought and I'm in the process of wrapping now for the family so I can get them sent off in the next few days..  Once that is done, need to focus on our Xmas cards and then we're pretty much set for Xmas.."

"event","Got my paper statement from Wells Fargo.. They've removed the principle line off the statement.  Thus, now it just says ""Added payment"".  Which means, even though I've * it and underlined the extra funds are suppose to go towards principle, I'm sure they're inadequate billing department is going to credit it towards interest.  I know that the extra principle I sent in to them last week (they should have received my the check around Wed/Thur of last week) is still not showing against my loan.  Thus, my expectations is that they're batch processing the checks on possibly a specific day of the week (or every 2 weeks) in order to ensure they can collect as much interest off the loans as possible.  

Again, I just want to say that Wells Fargo is one of the most greedy banks I've run across.  I will never do banking with them again once I can get my loans out from under them."

"event","We had a nice weekend.. Halloween went well and then Bear's b'day was yesterday.  His mom hadn't been feeling good all weekend..  Had something going on GI wise which was causing her to be in a lot of pain.  We weren't sure if it was gas, stool, or something else.  Anyway, she ended up vomiting the day after she got her and said she was doing better, however her energy levels weren't really up.  

For Bear's b'day, we started it off w/opening the cards he had gotten.  He had received my b'day present from him a few weeks ago.  It was a new computer, and it was already hooked up and running.. So, nothing on the table from me.. That felt a bit odd.  He had a card from his mom and one from Aunt Patty.  Then one of our friends sent him a ""Got Kilt"" t'shirt to go along with his utility kilt.  He's debating wearing it tomorrow when we go see Blackmore's Nights in Orlando.  

After he finished opening his cards, we all piled in and went to Epcot.  We didn't purchase tickets for his parents, for someone said that there may be a military discount.  We got there and found out that Bear's dad qaulified, getting a 5 day pass which was good to all of the parks.  Unfortunately, it was just the actual people who were in the military who got the pass, so his mom had to pay full price, however all total it was less than what she was expecting to pay. 

It was Epcot's food and wine festival, so we walked around the world showcase looking at the differnet stands.  It was still pretty early in the day and the sun was starting to beat down..  Bear's parents didn't really partake in any of the foods and Bear seemed a bit off as well as we strolled.  The sun was hot and beating down on us..  Got up to 85 degrees yesterday.  Once we got around the showcase, we decided to go check out some things inside for a while..  While we were inside, we tried our hand at the Segway.  I was amazed at how easy it was to utilize one.  Speed is obtained by leaning on the platform either forward or backward..  It was very easy to use.  

After staying indoors until around 3:30 or so, the day started cooling off, so we ventured back out again.. This time, we watched some of the shows which were being put on at the World Showcase.  We saw acrobats in China, a small play in the English showcase, and some amazing drummers in the Japanese showcase.  We ate at the Chinese restaurant, and Bear got a card (in Chinese) and b'day cake from them as well.  We finally decided to head out around 7:30 pm because we had an hour and 20 minute drive and everyone still needed to get up early today. 

Bear's parents made it home today safe and sound."

"event","We weren't really sure what tyep of Halloween it was going to be this year.  One of our neighboros had said they wanted to do a block party, however we never saw them after they mentioned this, so the block party idea died..  Bear's parents came in on Friday, however his mom wasn't feeling good and didn't start feeling back to normal until around end of day yesterday..  So, she didn't get a chance to help supervise the Halloween decorations.  Anyway, we never put up decorations until day of Halloween because of all the electronics we have..  We also figure it's kinda magical to see a house transformed into a spooky place for one night only, and when you drive by it the next day it's completely back to normal..  For lil' kids, they want to know if they dreamt the whole thing. :D

So, I got up around 8:30 or so yesterday and went down and talked w/Bear's parents.. I had to go wake Bear up around 10:00.. I figured we needed him to get up so we could start getting things ready..  We hadn't gotten the decorations down from the attic and we hadn't carved pumkins yet.. After Bear woke up, it was time to go get the decorations..  We brought the mummy down and all our goodies..  We had forgotten we had picked up a few things last year after Halloween... We had a new black light, spider webs. amd some small bags.  It took us almost 3 hours (includig 2 trips to Lowes) to get everything in order.  We had a box that was sound activated which caused anything plugged into it to go on and off w/the rhythem of the sounds.  We spotlighted the mummy, which was light activated, and then Bear put out a speaker w/spooky music. The light was going on and off w/the sound of the spooky music causing the Mummy to moan and groan.. It was fantastic.  Of course, the bubble maker was put out along with the smoke machine as well.. And we had sevearl smaller things which were scattered on the tables.  Overall, I think it was a pretty good set-up this year..

The first Trick-or-Treaters came exactly at 6:00 pm when the treating was schedued to begin.  We had a long pause between the first ones and he second group that came, and started to worry a bit that we may have purchased too much candy around 7:15 or so when we had only had around 15 kids..  Then the goulies started to come out..  Some of the kids told Bear that they remembered us from last year and brought their friends..  We had one kid who was too scared to approach the house at all and ran when Bear went out to try to give him candy..  My favorite part through were the young  kids who danced around the front yard trying to catch the bubbles from the bubble machine.. :D  You could really see how pure joy flowing through them..  We started tear down around 9:00 and had 4 more teens who pulled up and we told them to take whatever was left over..  Overall there were 73 kids who stopped at our house and 1 who ran past it. :)  I think we went through 4 or 5 bags of candy..  It was a really joyful Halloween.  

As for today, it's Bear's b'day.. He's out right now taking Goob to the kennel..  When he gets back, we'll all be going to Disney for the day because he has free admission on his b'day.  We're going to be going to the Food and Wine Festival at Epcot.. Should be a lot of fun."

Paperwork is signed and already in the mail.  And this morning I got an e-mail from Wells Fargo telling me that I *really* do need to stop paper statements and go with an on-line method with them.. That e-mail is now deleted, and I'm trying to figure out how Wells Fargo processes their checks they receive.. Whether it's nightly or weekly..  And I'm also trying to figure out the best way to pay down this loan w/them getting the least amount of interst.

"event","The weekend was a good..  I took Friday off, trying to burn off some of the vacation I still have for the year.. I originally was going to lie on the couch and read, however it's so hard for me to sit when I have things staring me in the face that need to be done..  

The whole house is slowly getting painted..priming over the cheap paint that use to be the old owner and being re-painted with a paint that we know won't rub off when the dog pounces up against it.  As I saw on the couch, I had the walls behind the couch staring at me..  Ugh. I knew I had the paint in the garage..  So, I trudge out to the garage to go find it.. Of course, the garage had become a rats nest of cans, boxes, tools, and vairous other stuff... So, I came to the conclusion that the garage needed to be straightened..  I spent several hours, hoping back and forth from the garage into the living room, for it was extreamly hot in the garage..  I parked my car outside, and by the time I was through, the car easily fit back into the garage w/no fear of tumbling boxes..  AND I found the paint I orignally went out to get.. 

So, up went the tape on the celing and the floor boards..  Down went the painters cloth and on went the latex gloves (yes, I am messey and know it).. And before I knew it, walls were being primed..  The primer took a little longer than I expected, so I started the real painting the next day. It took the majority of the day to paint, for I ended up needing 4 coats to coat evenly.  

Sunday was a laid back day.. We had some free zoo passes which were given to us when we volunteered at the zoo.. We decided to go shoot some photos.. We spent several hours going though it, enjoying the beautiful fall weathe.. And then we went over the Gulf to the Sunken Gardens, which is a small historical oasis in the middle of town..  I think we got some good photos there as well.  When we finally did get back home, Bear put in my new electical plugs, and the tape was pulled down..

I have to admit, I really do like the change in the living room.. Makes it feel very comfortable. :)"

"event","Well, I've decided I'm never doing business with Wells Fargo again.  They're not customer service orientated and are only out to make as much money as they can for themselves.. Let me get to the meat of the matter..

With one of my loans through them, I had been making extra principle payments on it via the web.  Wells Fargo has now dropped the ability for a person to make a principle payment over the web to their loan.  They said that the button that allows you to make a principle payment with (mind you, it's a radio button on a form that was NOT discontinue..only the radio button was taken off the form) was causing over 50% of the payment fraud happening at their bank.  Now then, my thoughts are that if this is the case, you have damn bad programmers.. Or good programmers who were funneling the principle payments into their own off-country bank account.. Either way, removing this functionality is NOT customer service oriented!  By removing the button, you're allowing the bank to make more money, for if you pay towards your loan electroincally, you have to place it towards the whole payment, which means that the extra money you're putting on the laon will go towards the interest on the loan instead of the principle.    

IF a customer want to make a principle payment through Wells Fargo, you have to either send a check, go to one of their banks to place the money on your loan, or set up a bank account with them to transfer the money out of that bank account (and even then, you're only allowed 2 transfers per month).  WTF?  In this day and age where you're worried about electronic transfer fraud, you want me to send a check through the mail where there's more chance of mail fraud?  Or set up a bank account with your sorry <explitive> bank so you can use my money for your own affairs?  Grrrrr...

I asked to have my electronic transfer dis-engaged becaused of the exchange I had with their customer service (more than likely outsourced to India by the ""pleasant"" way they told me to go screw myself).  I was told that they could not electronically unhook my bank account at the time I requested it.  That I had to fill out some paperwork and send it back in to them to show I no longer wanted to have my account hooked up.  ARG!!!  And, of course, they reminded me that I needed to keep in mind that it will take 10 business days for it to be unhooked once they receive my notice.  I must keep this in mind because if I don't time things right they may take 2 payments our of my account (one for the check and one for the transfer) or they may not get a check that month and thus will scar my credit report.. 

Needless to say, Wells Fargo has completely and totally lost all of my business.  I'm looking now on how to re-finance my home loan with another company so they can no longer get any more money from that one.  Unfortuantely, the loan mentioend above I feel that I'm screwed on due to the devaluation of my home...  There's no way I can get out from under their power on this one until home prices come back in several years. :(  Here's hoping to hitting the lottery..."

"event","I came down with a cold on Monday night. I think that was the last time this week I had a decent nights sleep.  Unfortunately when I get sick I get super sensitive..and so any lil' noise will wake me.  Kind of like tonight...I got to bed at midnight and a bird started signing outside our window at 3:00 am and didn't stop until 5:30. ARG!  So, needless to say, I haven't had much sleep and I'm irritable...and since this is the week before the first patient is to be entered into my trial, there's a flurry of activity going on at work so I can't take the time off to rest. ARG!  Top it all off, we have a window guy coming out today to give us estimates on our windows and I was silly enough to confirm the appointment..Which brings me to my rant..

Both Bear and I grew up in households where our mothers stayed at home and raised us while our fathers worked.  This meant that they took care of the household and I'll admit that both Bear and I have laxed cleaning standards compared to them because we never really did chores.  Thus, household cleaning doesn't rank up in priority when other things come up.  We figure we can get around to it when we can get around to it...I don't think that the house is horrible, however I'll admit that there is dust on things and papers and books lying around.  Anyway, when old friends come over, I try not to care about how the house looks..  When parents come over, I try to clean a little more than usual.  And when a complete stranger comes over?  Well, this is where I have an issue...I shouldn't care since I don't know them, however most people relate the cleanliness of a house not to the man, but to the woman of the house.  Thus, the cleaness is an impression to them on me... not my hubby, for most people relate men with working and thus not cleaning, so the impression of the house all falls on my shoulders, even though I work 60+ hours a week.  I know Bear thinks I'm crazy for I got into these cleaning fits when a complete stranger comes over...I'm usually puttering around picking up books that have remained in one place for over 3 weeks, or wiping down trash cans while he sits on the couch and watches TV.  I don't normally want to subject him to my insecuries, so I just continue to clean without a word.. Besides that, with my personality type it is difficult for me to ask for help... So he sits there shaking his head as I putter (willing to clean if I ask him to do so, but I have to tell him specifically what needs to be done)..

Forward to last night.. I've been running a fever for the last few days and the house is even more crazy than usual because I've been immediately going to the bedroom and resting when I haven't been at work..  Like a mad woman, I confirm the appointment with this guy and now I am obligated (in my mind) to make a good first impression on him.  ARG!  So, I'm sweating up a storm as I'm trying to do basic cleaning activities.  Bear's sitting on the couch working and watching TV as I'm coughing in the kitchen while I try to sweep the floor.  I break down at one point, sitting on the floor, pissed off at myself for being such a silly goose, yet that drive is still there to get the freakin' housework done.  I wish I knew where this drive came from so I could sqash it...  I finally ask Bear if he could ""take care of the dining room table seats"".. He says sure and just sits there..  Pisses me off even more.. So I verify with him that he understands waht ""taking care of the seats mean"" (i.e. brushing them to get any cat hair off them since the cats like to sit on them).  He looks at me blankly as I inform him.  He then pops up and takes care of it... However he is doing other things and thus needs to be project managed.  I just didn't have the strength to do it.  So, after asking him to clean one more chair, I continue on with cleaning until I feel that the house is acceptable to influcent a total stranger's first impression of who I am.

I so hate pre-conceived ideas. :("

"event","I absolutely love when you can take your birthday off and make it a three day weekend. :)  

Bear took Buttercup into Camp Bow Wow early Thursday morning.  Checked in on her a few times during the day on the webcam and she was romping around with the other dogs having a good ol' time.  Unofrtunately, I didn't get everything done that I wanted to before the day was through, so I threw my clothes into a backpack as soon as 5:00 hit, grabbed my laptop, and I worked off-line on the way there.  I *thought* I had finished everything up about 10 minutes before getting there, then realized I forgot to approve purchases for the copyright group. Arg!  Then realized I couldn't approve purchases without being on-line because I didn't copy a version of the database to my laptop.  Double Arg!  Oh well, just meant I would be on-line a little longer than I originally wanted to when we got to the hotel.  Anyway, Bear and I were both hungry, so we stopped at Downtown Disney to eat.  It was strange seeing ""Pleasure Island"" open but none of the bars open.  Really sad too because we *love* the adventurer's club.  My understanding is that they're going to be changing everything over into shops and/or restaurants over the coming years.  But, we walked past it all and then settled for the Portobello Restaurant.  There was a 35 minute wait, so we walked a while before coming back.  Dinner was good, however not as memorable as the last time we ate there (we had this roasted garlic which was scrumtious last time!).  After dinner we went to the Carribean Resort and checked in.  The individual that helped us was from Columbia and was named Jesus.  He wished me a happy birthday and gave me a birthday pin which he scribbled my name on.  Needless to say, we joked about the devine birthday greeting I received (and before someone gets on me, ""yes I do know it's pronounced with an H in Pureto Rico where he's from).

Room was clean and filled with Disney references like normal.  I jumped on the bed and spent and hour finishing up the work from the day.  Bear made sure my present in a red box was very prominently displayed, staring at me throughout the night. He so knowns how to keep a pixie's curiousity up. 

I woke up on my birthday in my sweetie's arms.  It's the way I so love waking up. :)  After rubbing the sleep out of my eyes my sweetie grabbed the present and placed it in front of me.  I ripped into it and started laughing.  It's a Cannon D50, exactly like the one I gave him at Christmas except with a slightly better lens (this one goes from 17-300, whereas the one I got him for Christmas went from 27-210).  He said that I had been commenting on how much better his was compared to my old Cannon D10, so he wanted me to have one for my own.  He's so thoughful. :)  We finished up prepping for the day, Bear placed my new camera into my backpack, and then we headed for the Magic Kingdom.  

I had come to Disney back on my 35th birthday, so I knew they tried to make you feel special.  Back then, they had different buttons for each park and we went to each park to get the button.  They changed their practice though, so now you're wearing just one button which has your name on it and everyone wishes you a personal happy birthday greeting.  Again, it's so surreal having people you don't know wishing you a greeting by name all day long. :)  This year is also Disney's year of celebration, so they are giving away free tickets or other special gifts if you already have a ticket.  We decided to go with the free ticket avenue for me this time around, however we found out later you could get a free fastpast to all the rides if you picked one of the other options.  So, we might do that for Bear's b'day in November. :)  

As always, it's always a blast going to Disney.  We explored new places today we didn't realize were there.  We saw the barber actually *HAD* 2 real barbers who would give you a haircut.  There were two kids getting one at the time, otherwise I would have thrown Bear into the seat. :)  We also found a place where you could take photos w/a bunch of cardboard cut-outs of Disney characters.  Perfect place to play with my new camera. 

My goal today was to try to go to as many rids as possible that I hadn't been on in forever.  For the most part we succeeded.  The park wasn't *too* crowded, so we were able to breeze in and out of most rides in less than 20 minutes.  We had a couple of rides, like the Peter Pan Adventure and Splash Mountain, which took upwards to 40 minutes to get out of.  Again, not bad times with all things considering.  We made reservations and ate at one of the restaurnts in the park at noon and supposable ""the boss"" made sure they put confettii nad streamers on our table before we got there to help us celebrate. :)  Besides eating, we got off pretty cheap this year in the park.  The only thing Bear bought for me was a set of pins while we were in the park of the Muppets wearing Micky ears.  we stayed until the fireworks display, which closed down the park at around 8:30, then took the bus to downtown Disney to go get something to eat.  We decided to eat at the House of Blues.  I was still wearing my button and they waitress wished me a happy birthday.  She was incredibly pleasant and nice throughout the night.  At the very end of the night, she brought us some cake w/a candle.  The table next to us was getting up ready to leave, then they stopped and stood around my table and sang happy birthday, referring to my pin when it got to my the name part. :D  After dinner we then caught the bus back to the hotel.  It was a truely happy and wonderful birthday. 

Saturday we woke up and it so felt like a Sunday.  We paked everything up and went to breakfast at the hotel, where Bear bought me a Micky straw to sip my orange juice with.  We decided to eat outside for it was suppose to get up into the low 80's today, and it felt like it was mid-70's in the morning.  The wildlife around the area was abundant and staring at us the whole time as we ate.  However, we knew better than to feed the wildlife, so we didn't. 

After breakfast we set off towards Orlando.  There was a traveling exhibit on the Muppets happening at the History Center.  We got there around 10 am and were really excited. Unfortunately, they told us that under no circumstances could we take phots in the exhibit. :(  They did tell us to stick around until 3:00 because ""A Better World: Living in Harmony"" was going to be shown.  So, we headed up to the area and there was Kermit welcoming us inside.  They had him under lock and key at the front enterance.  Going inside, we saw a lot of Henson's storyboards, drawings, and concept art.  They were also showing commercials he had designed.  And there were muppets and props, of course.  We saw the Mah Na, Mah Na's who were there, Stadler and Waldorf's balcony, and props from the Dark Crystal, such as Kira's dress.  At the very end of the exhibit, there was a small gift shop.  There were some books there that I thought might be beneficial to own once we start volunteering at the Children's hospital.  The books were on making puppets.  There was also a Kermit photo prop, which I've had on my wish list for years.  We decided to forego getting anything right now and do it after the 3:00 pm show. 

We got done early and went out to eat and then strolled around the park nearby.  There was a wedding of two women going on at the time.  Very beautiful...It was at the park under an arch.  Both women were wearing wedding gowns and we came across the wedding ceremony when they were about ready to walk down the aisle with their fathers (they were in two different places in the park so they couldn't see each other).  We unfortunately couldn't watch the festivities for too long because we wanted to get back by 3:00 and only had around 20 minutes to scoot.  

Got back in time for the talk and were stopped by the woodchip pile.  We got up to the desk to show them our ticket however the museum stopped us and told us there was an additional charge for the talk. Jim mentioned that we would pay, however we weren't informed of this up front.  The museum said they would give us a special 2 for 1 ticket price.  The talk was great.  They showed several National Wildlife Federation clips that Jim Henson created, a less well known episode about the rainforest, and finally several episodes of Fraggle Rock.  During this, Mokey (played by Kathryn Mullen) appeared at the podium and spoke for several moments about her spa that she opened up after Fraggle Rock. Finally, it wrapped up with questions, and Heather Henson was there to field a few questions from individuals.  She was trying to lure us all back next week when they'll have ""a singalong to the Muppet Movie w/Heather Henson"".  Sounds like it will be a blast. 

After the talk was over, we went downstairs to go buy a few things from the Henson Museum shop.  Unforutnately they were already closed for the day.  Bear spoke with someone about this since they said in the talk it was going to be open and the museum opened up the shop for us.  We purchased the 2 books and the Kermit posable figure.

Finished up the day driving back to Indy and then crashing in bed.  Overall a really great weekend thus far...However this is the first time I've had a birthday on the same weekend as daylight savings time kicking in.. Bear's still sound asleep at 10:30. Arg!"

"event","After planting my flowers and plants, we went out to the Ren Faire yesterday.  I love it, for during the first 3 weeks you can bring 4 cans and get a buy one/get one ticket.  So, I grabbed  6 cans (always better to give more, right?) and away we headed.  

The first portion of the day was good.  It had rained earlier in the day and the temprature was cooler than normal, however anytime the sun shone it got warm.  So, we saw a few shows, ate a little, and then the next front came in.  Sun went behind the clouds and it got cold (for Florida).  Performers were warming themselves with hand warmers and dawning as many cloaks as they could.  We stuck around for a little while longer, but decided to head back home around 4:00.  

After coming home, I made cookies and watched movies all night."

"event","Have still been feeling blue the last few days..  Friday was pretty much a wash.. Was so down at times I couldn't function.  I ended up taking several hours off in order to sleep.  Spent a few hours working with my stained glass and listening to meditation tapes, and then went to bed early.  

Woke up yesterday feeling a little better, however still a little down.  Bear had us pre-scheduled for a geocaching event, so I got ready for that.  It was an event which was put on by the Tampa Adventurers Club (TAG), and it indicated that geocaching experience or a GPS was not needed.  We took Goober with us to get her out of the house.  She was a lil' hyper to begin with, however she settled down once she was on the trails. 

There were around 30 people who came and the organizers split us up into 3 different groups of around 10. Our group was pleasant enough and everyone chit chatted while we were on the trail.  The group realized that Goob liked to be the ""lead slead dog"" fairly early on in the game and allowed her to be up front a good portion of the time.  I knew we had a lot of newbies but I didn't realize until we got close to the first cache just how inexperienced these individuals were (including the person who was heading our group).  One person thought the GPS was suppose to lead them *RIGHT* to the cache. Over 1/2 the group didn't have GPSs or it was their first time using a GPS if they did have one.  Bear spotted the old overgrown frontage road right off but the group insisted they wanted to get closer to the trail we were on.  We ended up having to loop back to get back to the south road because there wasn't another way in we could find.  Once we got to the cache, I saw it straight off but held back to allow them to find it..  It didn't take *too* long, however one person wanted to take an old turtle shell that was nearby, sign it, and place it into the cache.  We had to inform them that organic material should *NEVER* be placed into a cache container (otherwise it will attract animals to the container and they'll rip into it).  There was an armadillo living in the tree next to the cache.  That was pretty cool.  

Second cache we came to took a long while to get to, so it gave us more time to talk.  We were having problems finding the cache.  The cache was placed in a small hole in the ground, covered w/fake moss, and then covered w/leaves.  My GPS was pointing me to the wrong side of the road.  Bear finally found it and everyone laughed when they say it.  We set off to the third cache and the majority of the group started proclaiming they had to get home.  So, we lead them to the parking lot.  The lead didn't even ask us why we went there and took off for another cache w/o the rest of the group.  Everyone left but Bear, myself, Goob, and Sean.  We decided to go get one more cache, which was on a different side of the river than what the lead though.  We got to the cache spot and it took around 10 minutes to find it. This one too was stuck in a large hole and covered w/braches and leaves.  I suppose this is the way they hide them in Floriday.  In Indiana a lot of them are placed in trees (fallen or living) w/logs placed on top of them.  Finished up the day hiking next to the river.  We went across the suspension bridge that was there and got some good shots of the river.  

Once we got home, I told Bear we needed to go to ""Pinch a Penny"" to get a robot for our pool.  Our pool guy bailed out on us (we hadn't seen him in 3 weeks), so we decided to fire him and try the pool cleaning business ourselves.  Took in a sample of water and after the chemical analysis they thought it was in pretty good shape, considering it hadn't been serviced in 3 weeks. Told us to wait off on the robot because they were going to have a huge sale at the beginning of pool season ""next month"".  I think we can hold off until then.  

Also went to Lowes.  I bought a lemon bush a few weeks ago and haven't had the peet moss or fertilizer available to plant it.  Wanted to get that because the tree was looking fairly wilted in it's pot (I've been watering, but I think the soil in the pot is spent).  So, we picked up the moss, some soil, and a bunch of flowers.  Our bulbs are starting to come up, however we don't have any flowers yet.  We got several Lilly's and a ground orchid.  So, plans for the day is to get those planted.  

Finally, we went to see a movie last night.  Saw Push.  It was long at times, but I didn't think it was that bad of a movie.  Bear, on the other hand, slept through the majority of the movie.  I'm not sure if this is due to all the physical activity of the day or if he really just couldn't get into it.  Either way, I think I'll be seeing the sequel myself.  

Plans for the day is I'm planning on getting my plants and flowers planeted.  We might try to get to the Ren Faire as well.  Plans for the week include going to a training class on Tuesday so we can start volunteering at Hands on Tampa (organization which posts ""advertisements"" on other organizations that need help).  And then we'll be heading to Orlando for my birthday.  Spending the day at the Magic Kingdom and seeing Robin Williams that night.  Should be a fun night."

"event","I've been having a lot of ups and down this week.  My father went into the hospital on Saturday.  His kidneys had failued due to a massive infection.  This is the first near death experience we've had in my neuclear family, and it was incredibly frighting.  When I heard about this I immediately wanted to be with my family to help them, but my family is similar to me.  They are bullheaded and feel they can get through anything without help from others.  Thus they told all of us who were out of town to stay put.  I have obeyed their wishes, however it's been torturous not being there for them during this time and whenever I ask if there is anything I can do to help out, I am told not to worry about it.  

Anyway, we've been getting updates from my lil' brother who lives in the same city.  The updates have been spuratic, however I've sat next to enough friends in hospitals that I know what it's like...the number one thing on your mind is their health.  Of course, not having a support network here doesn't help at all with my emotional state.  The only person I have to talk to is my husband, and he jokingly told me this week that I'm ""a bad child"" for not going to see my dad in the hospital.  Needless to say, this cut to the bone and has thrown me into a deep depression.  It so sucks not being needed when you feel like you should be... 

On a positive front, the little information I'm getting appears my father is getting better.  Although he probably will not have full functioning of both kidneys, they're hopeful that he's not going to be on dialysis by the time it is over with.

I really miss my family right now..."

"event","Weekend has been a fairly nice one thus far.  Friday night was a stay-in type of night.  We figured that with it being Valentine's day weekend that there were going to be a lot of people out, so we decided to stay in.  We pulled out Munchkin Quest to try to learn it.  I think it will ultimately be a fun game, but there are a lot of rules you got to remember.  Took us close to 4 hours to get the first game done, so we went to sleep close to 1 in the morning.  Blah!

As for yesterday, was a good day.  I had cancelled one of my credit cards about 6 months ago because I was sick to the way they were playing with their rates/terms.  I dislike not having 2 because sometimes places will only take Visa and you may have a Master Card and vice versa.  So, I got on-line early in the morning and searched for the best fixed rate credit card and found one at a little over 7 percent an applied for it.  

Then came time for lawn work. We've periodically cleaning our street gutters of the hundres of thousands of leaves, but had not done much with our actual lawn.  We decided to get the street swept out again and get some of the leaves in the lawn raked out.  Lawn it looked better (however we still have a lot to go), and we're now up to around 16 large 25 gallon of bags of leaves that need to be disposed of.  Unfortunately our recycle lawn waste happens on Saturday morning, so we're going to have to wait a week to get rid of them. 

After lawn care, we then went to the state fair.  I'm still getting use to the state fair here.  There are a lot more unusual animals here, such as we saw Lamas, bears, and cougars on top seeing some far animals (however there are as many farm animals here as in Indiana).  Also, their specialty this year that all the tv stations were talking about was....chocolate covered bacon.  BLAH!  The fair almost reminds me a bit of a mixture of Conner's Prairie and State Fair.  There's a section where a small village is set up and you can watch as individuals showed you how they use to live back in the 1800's...this includes one of the former governers old childhood homes which still is standing on the site (including outhouse).  You can also drink anything from hard liquor to beer in the main section of the fair.  And, there were 2 different ""freak shows"" going on, including one where one of the original Wizard of Oz Munchkins was playing with fire.  Goodness knows that the fair is made to satisfy your inner child, and thus we did.  We ate all the stuff you're not suppose to eat as an adult, watched a portion of the National Elvis Impersonator's Contest be performed (what an odd feeling it was to look out across the crowd and see all those Elvis impersonators scattered throughout it!), and Bear played a few games.  Of course, I had to leave w/my monster bag of cotton candy. :D

So, weekend has been pretty good.  Not sure what we're going to do today, however I do know I need to get to the store. :)"

"event","The weekend was already a great one, however we thought we would top it off by going to see one of my favorite old movies with one of my favorite actors.  I saw a few weeks ago that the Tampa Theater, which is considered a national historical landmark, was showing Harvey.  We've never been there before, so we weren't sure what to expect.  We were overwhelmed when we got there.  This movie theater is one of the most ornate theaters I've ever seen..  The closest thing that may touch it is the Indiana Roof Ballroom, with similiar types of stars sparkling in the ceiling roof and a similar old rustic town feel to the wall facade.  The theater was built back in the days when going to a movie was a true night out, something special to be remembered.  We decided to sit up in the balcony, enjoying our popcorn, when all of a sudden we heard a wurlitzer.. Now this, this sound was the sound we remembered from the Paramount.  It caused me goosebumps as we listened and the wurlitzer popped out of the stage in front of the movie screen.  You could tell that the wurlitzer player was enjoying himself, and he got a huge round of applaudes as he slowly descended back into the stage at the end of his songs.  

After the pre-show was through, the lights went dim and the movie started and the red velvet curtains were pulled back from the movie screen.  You could tell this was being shown an reels, which was great. :)  I found out after the fact that Bear had never seen Harvey all the way through.  This was a classic way to go see it, in the theater as it was meant to be seen.  The movie was great as always, and Bear said he really loved it.  As the closing credits started, the wurlitzer popped back out of the stage.  We listened to the first song and then I went to the bathroom while Bear went downstairs to check out the wurlitzer up close and personal.  When I got there, the wurlitzer player turned around and asked if a specific woman was in the house.  She was and let him know.  He proudly asked her if she needed to hear ""it"" so she could get some tonight.  She said, ""yes, please"", and he swung aruond stating that because of him many a woman were wooed (of course, he stated it in much more colorful language).  He then proceeded to play ""Music of the Night"".  You could tell she was in absolute heaven listening to him, and her husband had a huge grin. :)  

After the movie, we proceeded home, but not without a quick pit stop.  We had been talking about going back to <a href=""http://www.got-tea.com/contact.html"">Got Tea</a> for a little while but just hadn't made it back.  This is a really cool lil' hole in the wall restaurant which specializes in <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_tea"">Boba tea</a>.  Neither Bear or I have ever been big tea drinkers, but depending upon the drink you get there it may or may not taste like tea.  Bear got a chocolate slushy  w/pearls in it and I had the Taro Milk Tea w/pearls.  Mmmmm...  

We finished up the night with me putting on my stilts and going out for a walk w/Goob.  This was the first time I went out in the daylight, and of course we met a lot of people.  Bear and I are convienced that I'm now known as that ""crazy cat lady on stilts"". :)

With such a great weekend, it's goin to be difficult getting back to a normal work week tomorrow."

"event","It's been a really great weekend thus far and it's going to just continue until tonight. :)

We started the weekend off by going to the Roaring 20's Pizza and Pipes in Ellington, Florida.  Now, taken on it's own merrit, the experience Friday night was wondreful.  We walked in to see the Wultzer playing, the place was packed, and everyone seemed happy that was listening.  Had I not known that it was a different owner, I would have swore that the owner of the Mighty Paramount Music Palace Wultzer had packed up everything and moved the place down to Florida, for the way you ordered your food was exactly the same and they had similiar long tables that required you to ""get to know"" your neighbor while you ate.  After we ordered (believe it or not, I think the food was a tad better than the Palace), we went to find a seat to bask in the ambiance.  I think that for anyone who had never been to the Palace, they wouldn't have thought twice about this, but because we had the direct comparison still without our heads it was hard not to make the comparisons (which I'm sure will slowly fad as we go there more often).  As the Wultzer came up for the next set, Bear and I both felt like there was something missing.  The music wasn't quite as loud as the Paramount, maybe the accompany the older crowd that frequented the place.  Also, the Wultzer didn't feel like it was center stage like it did at the Paramount.  There was another stage they had built right next to it w/plywood on the dance floor (thus eliminating the dance floor).  Bands were brought in on Friday night to play there.  I'm sure that this is to help during these times of hardship, trying to bring younger people in.  And, I told Bear and I felt like I was in an old high school auditorium with the way the building was built....No hard wood and carpet like I remembered from the Paramount, but in a rectangular building with vinal tiles. And, THERE WERE NO BUBBLES!  Apparently the one thing they forgot to ship was the bubble machine. :(  

Believe it or not, the organist who are playing are the same ones who played in Indinapolis.  They're just as good as before, exciting people with the train whistles as they get read to play the Chattanouga Choo Choo, or the theme from Phantom of the Opera.  We talked with Dwight in-between one of this sets and he became reflective stating that ""those were the days"" and ""there was just something magical"" about the old Paramount.  

We enjoyed his last set of the night, which he started off with the ""Stripper"", and we slow danced in back of the theater with another slower song.  Overall, it was a great night which we enjoyed, however it did make us a bit nostolgic. :)

As for yesterday, Bear forgot about Gasparilla, our pirate festival, and signed up for a ""glamor photography"" course.  So, he headed out bright and early to go learn about lighting and take photos of a woman in ligere, while I headout out to downtown to get photos of the festival.  Still not sure why yet, but the invasion was almost an hour and a half late.  Bear later told me that low tide was so low that you could almost walk across the Bay in some points.  So, the going theory right now is that they couldn't get the ships into the Bay.  As always, it's a massive party which attracts hundreds of thousands of people.  I payed the extra money to get across the street to get good photos of the invasion and get a bleecher seat fo the parade.  Unfortunately the seat I got was lousy.  Up in a corner next to a tree, so I didn't get any beads during the parade (it's worse than Mari Gras with the beads, however I think they scaled back a litle this year because the trees weren't dripping with beads like they were last year).  The parade was late because of the late invasion, however it was blast though and I got some amusing pictures.  As I was walking down the bleechers, a group of young Asian girls who were in the front row, strung with beads, stopped me, said ""You can't go home without any beads.  Happy Gasparilla Day"" and placed beads around my neck.  I almost cried becuase it was such a sweet gesture.  

When I got home Bear showed me his photos.  He took some really nice ones and it sounds like he learned a lot about lighting.  So, I imagine he'll be soliciting friends to allow him to take photos soon to keep in practice. :)

As for today, we did sleep in.  I need to go get ready to go out, for we're going to the Tampa Theater.  It's a historic theater downtown (supposably it too has a Wultzer) and it's playing Harvey! :D  I've read that it's a beautiful theater, and I can't wait to go see Jimmy Stewart at such a venue. :)"

"event","Almost forgot!  Even though we had an incredibly cold week here (at least for Florida weather.. We actually had a few nights where it was below freezing), last week we had a warm weekend and thus we decided to do a couple things around the house.  We got the grout on the floors in the bathroom sealed and the 5 or so tiles which we had to take up in the kitchen/hallway for various different reasons, we got those tiles laid (we still need to seal them sometime.  While that was all drying, we decided to work in the garage for a little bit.  We haven't really had good use of our garage since we moved in because there's no storage space there.  We have plans to one day put up shelves in there (since we can't have a shead in our yard), but that is another project.  

So, we have been moving stuff into the attic when we can and the attic is almost full at this point.  Next we squared out a space to put Bear's large tool chest, which was an easy task to do.  The next step was to get bike hooks and hang the bikes from the ceiling.  We had picked up hooks several weeks ago and it was time to get them hung.  So, we pulled everything out of one side of the garage to give us access to the support beams and screwed them in.  We then threw away a lot of boxes and put the right side of the garage back in order.  We're to a point now where we can actually walk around on the right side of my car!  Yeah! 

Unfortunately, I think the left side of the garage is going to be a little more difficult.  I *think* we've come to the conclusion that we need to get rid of the pool table, but it's now a matter of figuring out where we can sell it at.  Once we get that figured out and have a small garage sell to sell our old dog carrier and some bamboo fences we have, I think we can get our garage completely in order.  :D"

"event","We finally made the decision last week that it was time to retire our couches.  We have been talking about it for almost 2 years now..our couches are 16 years old and in dire need of a rest from our household.  We have been looking for a couch with ""toshability"", basically a couch which was comfortable to not only sit on but also comfortable when you stretch out on it for a noon day nap on the weekends.  We hadn't really had much luck. 

Last weekend we headed out to Ashley's because Bear had found some couches on-line he wanted to see from there.  We asked about the couches and were told they had one line but not another.  We sat on the one line and it was *aweful*!  Not comfortable at all.. But, we were there so we thought we would check out the other couches on the floor.  After sitting on another 15 or so, we found it!  Bear wasn't real hip on the color, sage, however he said he thought he could deal with it because it was comfortable..  So, we bought the couch. Yeah!  

Couch was delivered on Friday, and it amused me how the furniture store truck too so incredible long to not only unload the couch and loveseat, but also to leave the house.  Bear and I figured that they do it as free advertising for themselves (since their logo is all over the truck), in addition to doing it because most people like to have people envious about them getting new furniture.  Personally, I couldn't give a darn, and I just wanted them to unload the furniture quickly and be gone so I could get back to work. 

Anyway, the new furniture looks great.  I kept telling Bear that it's funny having ""grown-up"" looking furniture in our living room.. and it's so big that Buttercup looks like a pup when she's sleeping on it. :)  As for the other couch and loveseat, Bear's going to call DAV to see if they would be interested in picking it up.  It is worn, however Bear has said that for someone who doesn't have anything, it's at least a place to sit..  So, I hope that it goes to a good family somewhere..

As for today, it's been a great day.  We went out geocaching today and saw *TWO* Armadillos up close and personal while we were caching!  One was digging up alligator eggs and eating them...So, we didn't stick around to see the angry mother alligator!  Got 6 caches today, and it felt *SO* good to be out hiking in the woods!  Took Buttercup along with us and she was a *Great* puppy today.  She didn't try jerking or pulling when people walked by.  We're going to take her out to the St. Petersburg Farmer's Market here soon since she appears to be doing so great out in public. :D

Tomorrow will hopefully be a great day as well..  I'm looking forward to getting our trim up in the bathroom and finally getting the toilet put back in!  Yeah!  I'm so easily satisfied! :D"

"event","So, we picked Powerstar up on Sunday.  I had decided that one of my new things with guest would be that I would hand them a few travel books about Tampa and let them decide one day what they would like to do.  This basically allows the guest a chance to get to know Tampa a bit better and possibly take us somwhere that we wouldn't have taken them otherwise.  Today was that day for Powerstar. 

Bear and I discussed things to do on Sunday in case Powerstar couldn't make a decision.  We figured that if he did it would be he would want to go to the casinos.  I am slightly allergic to smoke (turns my stomach, causes headaches and in some cases makes me vomit when I've been in it to long), so Bear and I decided that if this decision was made that I would send him along w/Powerstar to the casinos at night.  

Powerstar had been looking through the books and the only thing that popped out at him that he really wanted to go see was the Pier in St. Petersburg (or as he likes to call it, the inverted pyrimid).  We had already done that the previous day, so that was now out.  Not liking to disappoint and almost on que, he told us that he wanted to go gamble at the Hard Rock (he found some coupons that gave newbies a $20 free card to be used in one slot machine) and see dolphins.  We had already had a few things in mind for the day and one of them was St. John's Pass.  We checked the book quickly to verify that they had dolphin cruises there and then away we went...

I was somewhat hoping that Powerstar might be interested in going to Hasam's Bookstore in St. Petersburg.  We found some information on it and it is the largest new/used bookstore in Florida.  Has over 300,000 gems waiting for customers.  Unfotunately, he said he was already in the middle of 2 trilogies and he wasn't interested in getting another book right now.  He said we could go for me, but that wasn't the point of the day, so we bypassed it.  

St. John's Pass is a tourist attraction 100% through-and-through.  It's a boardwalk type attraction on the water.  There's ice cream every 3rd shop and t-shirts galore.  There's also a lot of sight seeing cruises that take off from there.  We paid parking (we learned there was a parking garage after we dumped a load of change into the meter.. DOH!) and then headed over to the boardwalk.  We immediately saw a dolphin cruise in front of us as soon as we entered and so we purchsed tickets in the small shop nearby. While we were there, Powerstar purchased a Pirate ""Do-Rag"" and put it on.  We went out and ate and then boarded the ship.  The dolphin seeing was a little light, we saw the pods of dolphins at the very begining of the cruise, but they got right up to the boat.  Even saw a baby. :)  Got some great photos and learned a lot about dolphins, including that they do not migrate, the females stay w/their mom for life and the males take off after a year, and they have 88 teeths (44 on top and 44 on bottom).  We set off to look for more dolphins after a while, however didn't see any more.  We were taken near the bird santuaries though to look at the birds and learned some history about the area and found out about who lived/lives in some of the million dollar mansions on the bay.  Was very facinating.  

By the time we got off the boat, it was some time for ice cream and to tour the shops a bit.  We looked at the shop and then decided to go get dinner closer to our house in Tampa.  We ate at Tiajuana Flats for dinner, playing Montey Python Flux (great game!) after we ate in the restaurant.  Finally it was time to drop me off.  Powerstar met Goober (she was a total spaz when she saw him...), and then they headed off to the Hard Rock Casino (Bear came out ahead on their money.. Yeah!).

As for Monday, it wasn't a good day for Powerstar.  He wasn't feeling well.  We picked him up from his hotel and then took him down to the aquarium.  He wasn't doing well at all in the aquarium.  We then went to Channelside, not realizing that they don't really open up until 4:00 pm.  We found Bennigan's open and had a sub-par lunch there.  We checked out the movies and had missed all the movies.  We then got in the car and were showing him around Tampa a bit, but he was having issues all as we were driving.  We stopped for some medicine for him and then decided to take him over to the mall to see a movie.  We unfortunately got there when there wasn't much to see, so we went to go see ""The Spirit"".  I think he slept through a good portion of it.  After the movie, it was time to get him back to the airport, so we headed over there and then walked him to the tram before heading on home. 

So, overall it was a good visit, however I do worry about him and his health.."

"event","One of our best friends from Indy, Powerstar, was able to come down this weekend due to it being an extended for him.  He worked until 3:00 pm on Friday then hoped on a plane to Tampa at 5:00 to getting here around 7:00.  The attendence upgraded him to first class in order to allow a man and son to sit together in coach.  Sweet!  :)

He got off the flight wearing his heavy jacket since tempratures in Indy were in the mid-30's.  What a differences in tempratures for him, for it was probably in the high to mid 60's when he got off the plane.  

We wisked him away to his hotel (he's allergic to cats and dogs and we have both) which was across the street from Busch Gardens (it's about 15 minutes away from our house) and got him checked in prior to heading over to Ybor.  Ybor is one of the cultural high points of the city of Tampa.  It has somewhat a Jeckyl and Hyde type of personality as well from what we've seen.  Many festivals happen there, they have their Saturday market down there, cultural art shows...however late at night it becomes party central and it appears that anything goes there.  We got there around 8:00 when it was still fairly quiet and walked around trying to find a restaurant.  Powerstar homed in on the one that had the huge sign about ""Devil Crab Cakes"", so we decided to go there.  Was a cute restaurant and there was so much food we had to get a to-go box of the pasta for our Goober.  Waitress was sassy and they sat us right in the window so we could people watch.  As the night continued on and we talked, we saw the creatures of the night start to appear..  Powerstar made comment about all the girls in baby doll dresses (and how baby doll dresses have been out of season for years now).  Apparently I was way out of place because I was the only girl in jeans on the street by the time we started walking the streets.  The evangelist was on one street corner w/his signs indicating that Jeasus was coming and the Athiest was at the opposite corner with a sign indicating that he wasn't coming and was handing out literature about how the bible is full of inconsistencies and is fiction.  We stopped and were talking in Cetral Ybor.  Bear pointed out a mannequin, who was quite ""perky"", indicating I should get the clothes on it.  Powerstar's reaction was priceless.  He apparently focused first on the waist belt which was nice, scanned downwards, was saying something about, ""Yeah Ting, it's a nice form and.."" (caught sight of the perkiness here) ""Oh my Freakin' God!""  We had a homeless person ask us as well if we could spare some cash for food.  I reached into my pocket and pulled out the only money I had, a dollar.  I was holding it but hadn't even thought about it, but Bear made mention that we could give the guy our pasta.. It dawned upon me at that moment that he did say he was hungry and here I was holding food.. So, I gladly gave it to him (it was enough for a good meal).  He asked where he could get a fork and we told him he might be able to go into one of the restaurants and get a to-go fork.  We saw him walk off into a restaurant to go ask for one.  We walked and talked for another block or two before decided to get home.  In the car, Bear made mention about the anything goes atmosphere of the area... He was trying to give an example and asked Powerstar if he knew what ""hookas"" was.. Powerstar said, ""I don't know.. Is it plural for hookers?  Such as, look at those two hookas on the street corner there?""  This became our catch word of the weekend. :)  

So, yesterday came and I had the day somewhat planned out.  We wanted to give Powerstar the ability to sleep in since we knew he only gets a chance to do so on weekends (he's normally up by 4:30 every morning for work).  We picked him up close to 11:00 (I had to go take Goober to the kennel since we knew we wanted to try to catch sunset that night and would be away from the house too long).  We were all wearing shorts because the forecast was for 78 degrees today.  

We headed over to St. Petersburg for the Saturday market.  I am growing extreamly fond of St. Petersburg the longer we live here.. It's a beautiful lil' community and feels so family friendly.  Every weekend during the fall/winter/spring months they have a Saturday market.  It's a beautiful market, filled with just about anything you can think of.  There's always a lot of fruit/vegetable vendors, artist, and craftsmen there.  Practically every vendor allows samples if they are selling food.  It's a great way to spend a morning.  We perused through the vendors and I became fixated on one of the vendors, who makes these beautiful pieces of jewlery out of old silverware.  I couldn't stay away and had to go back after we got through the market.  I purchased a piece for $20, which use to be the handles of some old forks that were from 1935.  It's beautiful! :)  

Daryl and I walked a lil' ways and Bear went to go get the car so that he could take us over to the Pier.  This is one of St. Petersburg's biggest attractions.  It's a small mall at the end of a pier w/an aquarium on the 3rd floor, and restaurants on the 4th and 5th floor.  We went up to Coconuts on the open air balcony and ate lunch.  We just sat outside and soaked up the sunshine.. It felt so god. :)  And Powerstar said that it was one of the best grouper sandwiches he's had in a *LONG* time.  

After lunch the next attraction was going over the Suncoast Highway.  It's the longest and highest bridge in the bay area.  You can actually drive the biggest cruise ships under this bridge with a lot of room to spare.  The bridge allows you to get a great view of the bay waters.  We knew going into it that Powerstar was afraid of heights, but he wanted to go over the bridge anyway.  He told us after we got over it that it wasn't so bad and he loved the views.  Yeah! :)  

Next stop of the night was a drive...  I wanted to get to Pier 60 on Clearwater for the sunset celebration.  Every night they hold a celebration there.  There's vendors on the dock and artist and street performers at the base of the dock.  We watched a juggler/fire eater perform, saw a guy dressed up as Captain Jack taking photos w/visitors, looked through the artist booths, and then finally got up the pier to start looking through the vendor's booths.  We had to giggle because the same artist I bought my bracelet from earlier in the day was now set up at the Pier. What a life! :)  We got to the end of the pier in time to see the pirate ship sailing below the sunset.  Very cool. :)  And we got some fantastic photos of the sunset as well.  When the sun was below the horizon but the sky was still filled with the firy aftermath, we headed off the pier and onto the massive white sand beach.  We were so close we had to get our toes wet at least once that day.  So Powerstar and I stripped off our shoes and socks and went and walked in the surf for a while.  We headed back to the car when the sky was dark and the full moon was shining down upon us.  It was a beautiful night. :)

Finally we finished the night going to a place in Clearwater called the Thirsty Marlin grill.  We knew Powerstar loved seafood and this hit the spot for him.  It had a very friendly atmosphere and the food was good.  

The night ended with Powerstar having a homework assignment.  I gave him a bunch of books and told him to look through them and see what he wanted to to today.  I thought about this idea recently and like it... we can show people around without an issue, but there is so much stuff to do around here that it's hard to know what is optimal for everyone.  By allowing visitors to look through the books and tell us what they want to do for a day, we make sure we're fulfilling their expectations of the area.  I know he said he wanted to go to the casinos tomorrow, so we'll probably do that late in the day since there is smoking there (I'm slightly allergic to smoke and prefer to shower immediately after being in a smoke infilled room so I'm not sick afterwards).  Other than that, I don't know what is going to be in store today yet.."

"event","I know it's been a few days since New Year's Eve/Day, however we've been traveling so I haven't had a chance to report on the happenings...

We got started late, however I convienced Bear I needed to get the floor thinset prior to going to the festivities..  I knew that if we didn't get it cemented in that day that it would be *WEEKS* before we would be able to get it completed.  Within a few hours, we had the tiles set and drying...Of course, it is without saying that the pixie was covered head-to-toe in thinset while Bear stayed out of her way by handing her tiles and cleaning up after her. :)

We took Goober to Camp Bow Wow earlier in the morning, which was a *fantastic* idea.. Kept her busy during the day (they put her in a cage w/all the other pups to go romp around with) and outta our hair while we were busy w/this project.  

After thinsetting the tiles, we cleaned up and headed out to St. Petersburg.  Bear had enough sense to get us a hotel out there near the festivities.  I have to say that First Night was a *blast*.  It was completely geared towards family fun...  It's set in about a 5X5 block radius from the waterside, with stations somewhat spread out... There were dance lessons, music concerts, puppet shows, and a lot of other things..  You had to buy a button to get into some of the things, but other things appeared to be free (the buttons weren't bad.. Only $10 a button for adults, which is cheaper than a night out a/the movies anymore).  The free things, the people announced about the importance of buying the buttons to allow for them to be able to come back the next year..  Anyway, we saw a few moments of a organist playing in a church, sat in on a story teller, saw the HMS Bounty (which was used in the movie ""Mutany on the Bounty""), and then were *UNDER* the first set of fireworks when they went off when we were on the Pier (we didn't know where they were suppose to go off at..then we knew where to be for the next 4 displays..there were one per hour for 5 hours that night).  We walked off the Pier and got to the nearby park, where there were some *awesome* events going on.  There were shadowpuppets being displayed on the side of a building, a *MASSIVE* drum circle (I would say easily 100 drums were there), a concerts, and a Money to Burn display.  This last one was fun because they had fake $20 bills.  You wrote your wish or something you wish would disappear and then took it over to the campfire and burned it on a stake.  After partaking in a little fun, we strolled to see the (gl)ice skating and many bouncy displays they had.  We unfortuantely had not eaten yet and decided to eat at one of the many restaurants on the bay.. This was our mistake... The place we ate at (a local Grill) was SLOW, expensive, and the food was terrible..  We missed 2 of the fireworks displays becuase of them.. :P  

When we were finally set free, we walked down a few blocks to the haunted house, only to find out that you had to get a number to be in the tour group and they had already passed out all the number for the night (it was nearing 11:00 at this point)..  We walked back to the main festivities and partook in watching the kids making huge bubbles at the bubble station and ran through the luminary maze.. We got a chuckle at the end because there was a calendar of events flapping the air, discussing ""fishy"" ideas associated with this being the year of the fish.  One of the calendar ideas had to do with geocaching and we knew the person putting it on. :D  

After finishing up these activities, we went back and watched the drum circle for a long while.  The energy there was amazing...  And then we broke at around 11:45 to go find a seat on the bay to watch the final firework display that usered in the new year.. It was spectacular!  And to top it off, the live band was playing in the background during it. :)

So, with it being a family friendly thing, at midnight, it shut down..  Of course, the bars in town were still open, but we decided to head to the hotel.

Next morning, we picked up Goober and then came home to pop out all the spacers from the tile work we did the day before. We didn't want them to get cemented in the tiles while we were gone.  We packed up all our stuff then and headed to Bear's parent's house in S.Carolina for 4 days..

Had a really nice time there.. Started the night off w/them giving us a few Xmas gifts..  I got a device which will give me the weight of my suitcase, a fairy cork topper, a book on 1 tank trips for Tampa (there's some good stuff in there), and a 1000 threadcout sheet set (comfy!).  We also got some new photos of Bear's niece and nephew.  

The next day, we headed out to see a model train exhibit, just to be disappointed because they only worked from 5-8.  We spoke to a rocket scientist who was wanting to get in as well, that was great.. He worked on the Apollo missions and had seen every launch..  After bidding ado, we went to get something to eat.  Started off at one restaurant, but the service was s-l-o-w and we left (and I left my purse..DOH!).  Bear's mom was amazed at how calm I was when I realized I might have left my purse, but Bear and his dad went back to get it after we sat down at the second restaurant we went to, Red Robin.  We went back to the house to meet up with Bear's cousin's who swung by from Indiana for a few hours after dinner.  That was a pleasant visit, and Goober was an excellent pup.. After the first 5 minutes, she was like an angel. :)  

Final day we were in S.Carolina we went to go see Bedtime Story.  That was actually disappointing.. Very predictable and all the good parts were shown in commercials.  

As for the trip back, it was long.  We left on Sunday at 10:00 am and got back at 8:30 pm because of an accident and then had to do some clean-up work of the house (and it's still a disaster area)...  Good thing is the floor is looking good, now I just need to get in there and grout it.

As for the first day of work in 2009.. It sucked.. Was on-line until 11:30 last night because of all the things that had to be done afte the holidays. :P"

"event","So, if anyone ever had any doubt about it, I'll admit to it.. The pixie is a messy painter.. Not messy on the wall, but I ultimately end up wearing at least 1/2 of the paint..  So, Bear worked yesterday and this morning on getting the walls preped for me..  I knew that the wall was going to drink the primer, but it did so more than I was expecting..  Three coats of primer later and we're ready to fix any places which look somewhat awkward and then prime those spots..  But, this is a tomorrow job..

Bathroom is all cleaned up at this point, but I didn't want to wash out the brushes and dispose of the pans because I know I'll be priming the touch up spots tomorrow.. So, tip for anyone who ever had to put up their stuff for the night, use plastic wrap to wrap up all your brushes and your pans..  They won't dry out and will be ready for you to use tomorrow (which is what I've done)..  

Other than that, been a quiet day.. Been watching Columbo all day. In between the coats of paints drying.  Yeah! :D"

"event","Last several day have been marvelous.  I'm soloving staying home w/o going into my office.  Haven't set foot in there in over a week and I feel fantastic! :D

As for what we've been doing the last couple of days... I've been working w/my stilts everyday and getting decent at them.  I'm to the point where I'm walking on my own.  Still having a heck of a time finding my center of balance on them while standing still.  With them being curved, I want to fall forward when I'm still.  I know, it will come with practice.  

Bear's been working on the bathroom.. Yeah!! :D  he did the patch work on the walls and sanded down the patches.  I'm in charge of getting in there today and doing the painting.  I'm a little behind on my schedule because I didn't touch the bathroom in 2 days.  Felt kinda nice. 

I've also been working on a cousin's step page.  Bear moved her database over to a different database which caused the Coldfusion code to barf.  The problem being that it's been so long since we touched the code that I think the company turned off the debugger on the server.  There are general ""oh yeah, your code isn't working"" statements but not the line number.  Come to find out that the new database didn't like LEFT JOIN clauses in the code.  ARG!  Anyway, got that fixed yesterday and am messing around with the formatting now.  Should have it up and working before we leave for South Carolina. 

Friday night was a bunch of giggles.  Bear wanted to go to St. Petersburg to a photo scavenger hunt to play w/his new camera.  Met a bunch of people and were sent around an 8 block radius to take as many pictures of ~150 things as possible.  He had some ""bonus"" items which required interaction with people or you doing stuff..  I got to climb up 4 and 10 feet into this beautiful tree to get a picture taken and dance w/a stranger.  Bear interacted w/a homeless man (gave him a pocket full of change) to get his picture, and we got a jewerly making individual some more exposure by taking his photo w/his sign. :)  The people really seemed to enjoy getting into it.  We didn't do the more crazy things like as people to moon us for a photo, or ask a 70+ woman to have Bear give her a piggy pack ride.  Anyway, it was fun and we'll probably go out with this group again.  I finsiehd off the night by looking for things to do while Powerstar was in town.  Unfortunately, it's somewhat an off week, being the week right after New Years..  One more week and we would be taking him to the pirate festival (http://www.gasparillapiratefest.com/), but the week he's coming down everyone seems to be preparing.  So, we'll just cruise the cost while he's here..  

While I was making that decision, I also booked us for our New Year's Eve activities.  Was looking around for something fun and not necessarily drinking related.  Decided to get tickets for St. Petersburg First Nights (http://www.firstnightstpete.com/).  Activities start at 5:00 and there's fireworks every hour starting at 8:00.  Was told there were a lot of activities and it's more of a family friendly party atmosphere.  So, I'm looking forward to that.  

Yesterday I started taking down the Christmas tree.  I have maybe around 20% of the ornaments off.. I was watching tv at the same time and wasn't getting into the activity.  Bear came down to show me information on the Great Urban Race in Tampa Bay (http://www.greaturbanrace.com/).  It looks like it will be a fun activity.  We don't know Tampa *THAT* well, but they say we can have a friend standby to look things up on the Internet (and Bear has his Blackberry).  So, we're now booked for that as well.  

Night ended with us going to the movies.  We went to go see Twilight since it's down to not too many theaters.  We thought we had waited long enough that all the craziness would have ceased...We were wrong.  We had an idea something was up when we went through the doors and there was a ""spin the wheel"" game going on and a prize drawing to a convention out in Orlando (vampires, werewolfs, and Harry Potter convention).  I got a sticker w/the wheel, however Bear got the grand prize of the soundtrack and 2 stuffed animals (a lion and a lamb).  So, he handed them over to me and I had some friends sitting in my lap during the movie.  When we got into the theater, it wans't crowded at all..And as the movie time came closer, it filled up *completely* of pre- and teenage girls.  Bear made mention of how if he was a teen he would be there just to be with the girls.  It's been a *LONG* time since we've seen a movie w/this many girls.  And this was the first time we've done it w/photo cell phone technology.  Even though it states that you can't have your phone on, they were taking photos left and right of the main character w/their phones.  And the gasping!  Oh my...every time they did an eye shot of the main character there was gasping..  The producers nailed their audience completely.  By the end the girls were just swooning out of the theater, calling each other ""sheep"" and ""lil' lambs"" (line refernece in the movie).  Needless to say, it was an experience...  I don't think we'll be going to the convention, for I'm sure it's going to be overrun w/teenage girls..."

"event","As our world becomes faster pace I believe that the art of gratitude has become lost.  I remember as a child, one of my grade school teachers stressed the importance of not only saying thank you when someone does the smallest thing for you (such as holding open a door or giving you a piece of their candy bar), but she also stressed the importance of writing thank you notes to show you cared about larger acts that were done (such as receiving a gift or help).  The act of writing the thank you note showed that you were truly gracious that the person actually took the time out of their lives to think about you and care about your needs.  I use to always have a stack of cards next to me when I was younger and use to send letters out all of the time.  I would send thank you cards via mail.  I remember how joyous an event it was to get something in the mail.  I couldn't wait to see what jem of knowledge may be inside the letter, be it a thank you or a bit of knowledge of how people were doing.  The note was a truely personal event because it was directed at me and not at anyone else.  

As the information superhighway has proceeded to become larger, I believe people have become more callous about the way they interact with one another, which ultimately affects the way they show gratitude.  People post blanket information and statements without it directed at any one individual.  I admit that my skin had thickened up as well as I have learned to do the same.  Ultimately when it comes to gratitude I have learned to send only a text message of ""thanks"", a quick e-mail of gratitude, or (the worse) not sending anything at all (thinking that the person knows that I am thankful)..  

As I read the ""Last Lecturer"" book, one of the points that he stresses is the importance of providing hand written thank you notes to people.  This lesson cracked my slowly hardening exterior, for it reinformed the previously instilled lessons from my childhood.. It made me remember the joy of receiving *REAL* mail and that someone was grateful enough, even for a moment, just to take the time out to say thank you in a meaninful way.  I don't know if I can get back to my old ways, but I think I need to have a stack of thank you cards laying around the house again to allow the possibility of old habits being renewed."

"event","With it being the week of Christmas, you would think that we would be in a state of holiday cheer and cooking and baking preparing for Christmas.  Instead, we're still busily working on getting the bathroom remodel done.  Where are we at right now?  It seems like that darn wallpaper keeps turning up everywhere.  Anytime I pull anything off it's there... Including behind the baseboards and the medicine cabinet (which was recessed into the wall).  I *think* I have it all about gone.  I pulled the baseboards off yesterday (we need to replace them because they didn't go all the way around the bathroom and now that we have a cabinet on legs people will see missing baseboard behind it if we don't do something about it.  I also took up all the ceramic tile last week except the 3 pieces in the doorway.  I wanted to give something to Bear to do and I didn't want to have to contend with trying to figure out how we were going to score them and cut them while they were laid down (we need 1/2 of them since 1/2 is inside the hallway and the other half is in the bathroom).  Anyway, Bear tried to score them and broke them.  So, we're taking them up as well and relaying those tiles (thank godness we had extra in the garage).  

Then last night I washed down the cement slab and dried it.  We have some chunks that came out of it while I was trying to smooth the floor down w/the chisel, so I need to level it either today or tomorrow.  Also at this point, I'm steaming the old cruddy paint off of the door frame and I'll be paining it w/good primer (primer that won't come off when you wash it like the old stuff).  

As for materials, we now have a medicine cabinet for the bathroom that will match the style of the bathroom.  We also bought the faucet, the primer for the walls, the new light switches and the tile for the floor.  Still need to buy the paint for the walls, the grout, and thinset.  Besides that, I thought we're just about through w/purchasing stuff.  Yeah! :)"

"event","Well, I've been on vacation now for 2 days and I've worked something like 12 hours in the last 2 days..  People just don't understand that when I'm on vacation I'm on vacation. :(  Anyway, in-between doing the work I've been working on my bathroom as well.  I've gotten a good 98% of the wallpaper off and cannot do the rest until the sink is out of the bathroom.  I've also removed the medicine cabinet that was in the bathroom, disassembled the water lines, taken off the new faucet that we put in last year, and took out a portion of the drain pipe..  I took out these massively long screws in 2 places and had to ask Bear to take care of a third because my hand was getting tired of twisting back and forth.. Come to find out that the third screw was stripped and wasn't coming out of the wall.. ARG!  So, started then on the spikets and main drain pipe..  They GLUED the plastic drain pipe onto the main valve again. ARG!  This is the second one we've foudn like that.  I'm starting to wonder now if this was the way things were done by construction crews back in the early 80's..  The first one I thought was due to the home owner, but 2 is starting to be too much of a coincidence.. I need to check the other 2 sinks and see if they're the same...  Anyway, tomorrow I need to put my mind to it and try to figure how I'm going to get that darn sick out... The sink had a whole cut in it fo the drain pipe and then the pipe was glued on after the sink was put in.  There's not a clear-cut way to get the sink out w/the pipe holding it in place.  So, I might be rumaging through my saws tomorrow trying to find out something that I can be destructive with. :D  I so feel for poor Bear.  He never knows what he's going to be coming home to when I'm on vacation. :)  

Anyway, Bear wants to call a plumber to put the main pipe in the *right* way after we expose the main drain pipe.  I'm tempted that if I do that I'm going to have the plumber do all of the ones that are on the wrong way.. We'll see..

Hope everyone is staying warm.."

"event","There are times that I miss my old house in Indianapolis.  With it being built in the 1960's, it was a sturdy house that was built with a pride in workmanship.  This house?  We're working on improving it, however it's going to be a slow battle.  The builders did things which identified they were more interested in getting the house up as quickly as possible, and the previous owner didn't worry about quality at all with any of his projects.. Which leads me to my current project..

Since I have some time off for the holidays I thought I would tackle our ugly downstairs bathroom.  The previous owner painted over the wallpaper with white paint and then used a gold paint and a sponge to make some type of pattern on it.  Also, the sink is a pretty ugly sink.  So, my original thought was that I would take down the wallpaper and replace the sink.  As with all home improvement projects, they're never as easy as you think they are going to be.  My original intention was to start the project next week, since I thought I had 3 weeks to complete it but would only need a few days.  Anyway, we found this week that I have less time, so I started prepping the room today..  Mirror came off the wall, towel holder is down, light switches are down..  There was a small rip in the wallpaper, so I pulled on it.. What did I find? The walls were never prepped w/primer.. ARG!  So, this means I can't use my steamer on the wallpaper.  If I do, there's a possibility of causing damage to the wallboard.  So, I'm going to have to use my fingernails and a wet rag to get it off.. Also means I will have to fix some wall joints that weren't done properly and prime the wall with more than likely 2 coats of primer before painting (2 coats).  

Next issue, we bought a sink.. A really beautiful one on legs, so you'll see the floor below it.  I was looking at the sink today and realized they tiled *around* the sink. This means we're going to have to break up the tile in the bathroom and retile in there as well..

So, my lil' remodel that I was hoping would only last 2 days is going to last a lot longer.. I'm giving it the full vacation time I have..  Will keep you all updated as I progress.."

"event","Although we had some set-backs with Thanksgiving, it ended up being an enjoyable one this year.  The original plan was that everyone was going to congregate at my older brother's house in NM and meet his new girlfriend. What happened was quite a bit different..  My younger brother wasn't able to make it because he had to work Black Friday for the first time in his life.  My mom originally was going to fly to ALQ alone due to my Dad not enjoying flying anymore, however they talked a few weeks ago and decided they would both drive it instead.  They set out at the beginning of the week and when they got down to TN they had to turn back because my father became ill during the drive.  Then, my sister's flight schedule and mine didn't match up at all.  I decided that I was going to spend the week in NM, and the best tickets I could find were from Sunday to Friday.  My sister had to work and thus couldn't come out until Wednesday and would leave Sunday.  Thus, Bear and I got to visit with her for only about a day and a half..  And to top the week off, Bear ended up getting sick and spent the good majority of time in the hotel..    

Despite all the hijinks, I got to spend some good quality time with my brother and his kids, and his girlfriend and her 19 year old son are sweethearts.  We got out one day while his girlfriend and son were working and we hiked a trail full of petroglyphs. We also got to go cheer his girlfriend on at her soccer game.  As for Thanksgiving itself, my brother and his girlfriend cooked for us all day long and there were more than enough vegeatrian dishes to go around with the Turkey.  It was great food with a Southwestren flair.  After dinner we sat around my older brother's computer (w/a big screen monitor) and surfed the net watching YouTube videos.  On Friday, we had a 1:20 flight, which gave us enough time to meet my sister and his husband, my brother, and my nephew for breakfast.  Afterwards we ran down to the local science museum to see the ""age of computer"" exhibit, which was quite amusing because we all had memories of they various different computers and programs they highlighted in the exhibit.  

As for the flight back, it was ok.  The first leg was non-eventful, and the sencond leg was frustrating.  A person who was scared of flying was sitting it back of me.  He had taken a valium before getting on the plane, was drinking, and chewing tobacco.  The people next to him were chatting w/him during the whole flight about unappropriate topics.  Bear and I were just glad we had our headphones and iPods with us to drown out the conversations and vomitting that was going on."

"event","I'm back in Indy again this week...and it feels...different.  I feel like the strings attaching me here are slowly being clipped away.. Previously normal activities such as driving down a specific street, which use to seem like an automatic process, are turning into more of a manual task..  My attention is becoming more focused as I become aware of the growth and changes of the town... Roads have been demolished, a new stadium built that I'll never set foot in, the airport where I had my first plane flight closed..  I have to file away the changes for the next visit and allow my memories to vanish of the town I use to live in..  

Friends who once seemed so integrated into my life now have to be conscienciously re-installed during the visits...E-mails and prompts on social networks to see if there's interest in getting together lead to telephone calls..  There are wonderfully warm welcomes as we see each other again, however meetings seem all too fleeting as we exchange major details from the last several months... Fond memories are generated, however the meetings are much different than the late nights filled with laughter and glee that we once experienced...

The weather, which use to give rise to the seasons and was a powerful force in determining the outcome of events, is now viewed as an annoyance as time ticks away during a visit.. 

My sweetheart's heart, which beats inside my chest, yearns to be reunited with each passing minute..  Sleepless night lead to thoughts of being in my sweetie's arms again..  Dinner's alone bring about thoughts of walks hand-in-hand on the beach with my love..  There is a realization that my heart right now is with my husband in Tampa... and home is where the heart is, no matter where that may be..."

Well im sorry you had to put family first once in your life. she didnt even take off when i went into the hospital. then she yells that if i dont get out of her sight she is going to hit me. then she keeps yelling and i cant go anywhere. i just feel like such a rotten person right now that nothing i do is right."

Today i was waiting outside for laetetia by your english class and she walks out with mandy and jaquline and they both glare at me and walk away. WTF? it seems laetetia dosent have to much time for me anymore with school and her other friends and her boyfriend. Mandy i dont know whats up her ass i decided to read her xanga today and got totaly pissed off by some things she menchioned about me. if i remmber correctly she did come to my 16th birthday party over the summer and wrote this to me: Thanks for being such a great friend to me. I hpe your 16th year of life is all that you want it to be wish on stars and touch the sky! never stop shooting for the best! and never forget that i'm proud to call you my friend! love,always Mandy. but then i read her her journal around homecomming she got invited to olvie garden with us (not by me but i wouldnt have cared if she came or not) and she said she would have gone but i was going i think her words were Tracy will be there ick. im just very depressed right now i wanna go crawl in a corner. I know i shouldnt let her get to me. But its laetetia to like i felt she wanted to go with Mandy and jaquline and but instead had to stay with me. well from now on ill make the dission for her and not wait anymore.

"event","well i official have no group to fall back on.

meaning ever since i was little i always have had a tight group of friends ones that i could count on and we were held like glue. Now i just have semi friends i mean Rachel is still really close to me but she is going off to college next year and im really afraid of that. Laetetia is still a good friend but she is so overwhelmed with school she dosent really notice me much. Tracey and i are getting to be good friends at least i think we are

Sam and michelle are to much of...how do i put it without sounding mean they are to much of......sluts? not like its a bad thing but all they care about is guys and i am just sick of hearing how guys love them and fawn all over them its bullshit someone needs to wake them upside their head and tell them to get a life.

my tight group last year fell apart because all they care about is school now. 

I find myself sitting alone in the mornings cause Laetetia is doing homework machelle and sam are off flirting with guys and im just there all by myself until crissie comes. Then i feel like she is only sitting with me cause no one else is. oh i dont know im just in a very crappy mood tonight.

I want to talk to rachel about this but then i have to admit i am afraid when she goes of to college cause she is sooooooooooooo happy about it and im not ready to let her go. I mean i have everyone telling me indirectly that friendships dont last forever and i dont want to lose her. I mean she'll go off to college we'll e-mail for awhile but then she will get busy with her new life her new friends and ill still be stuck in highschool. 

i dont want to be alone

I forget where this was a topic but it was about basing your self worth on if you have a boyfriend/girlfriend and it hit me i do that. I have very low slef worth and i think that if i have a boyfriend it will get better cause i know someone wants to be with me for me and dosent care how i look i know its wrong to think i need a guy but i cant help it its easy to say that you dont need one when u have tons of guys admiring you"

Mostly worked all weekend today was the best day tho made 70 bucks in tips:) Found out tiffany is defiatly quiting and 2 people have applied for a b-day hostess job cat and this other girl who i dont know. i really hope cat gets it. i know i can depend on her i just have trouble trusting new people.

Hung out with rach a bit today she picked me up from work and we went to go get some school supplies. 

thinking about homecomming today i dont think ill go this year. last year was such a disaster and i think it will be boring with just having girls there i mean why pay 15bucks and pay like a 100 for a dress when i can just hang out with them at my house and rent some movies for like 5bucks. i dont think homecomming is worth it without a guy"

"event","Tonight was back to school night. my mom came as useaul cause my dad couldnt really give a dam about my school but anyway she came and met all my teachers and that was fine

well on the way home she had asked me about something she heard in my geo class (he menchiond that we has HW and about 8-% of the class finished it) i said i didnt start it cause i was working on my class work the whole time. Then unexpecdly i start getting bitched at about now doing my homework in class! i explained to her that i working the whole time and being very accurate on my work and she still yelled at me. saying this is all what i said last year which i never did. last year i would have just rushed through everything.

If that wasnt enough she started in on my about my Job. Now she is the one that encourged me to take it but now she is like u cant do this blahblahblah and i have just started that job so i dont really want to ask for a lot of things right off the back and she was yelling at me for that.

I just feel like laying on my bed and crying right now its not turning into such a great year for me."

I started school today which really sucked monkey balls. My first period teacher reminds me of a ex boyfriend and it really isnt good cause everytime i look at him i feel like gaging

my science teacher is a real dork. The suspender wearing tape on glasses kind of guy.

my geography teacher seems like he is going to throw things a lot. <reminds self never to dose in his class>

my all time fav teacher today was my creative writting teacher. he is soooo funny. and he is full of personal stories he talked a lot about his wife and his little boy just started kindergarden today. We were asked to come up with the most creative word in english and of course most of the classes were like crazy,pshico but we finally got on the word ""is"" and decided that is the most creative word. 

i baby sat tonight which was ok they were tired from there first day of school so they watched TV most of the time. it was an easy 10bucks for me. 

the girl that trained me for my job said she was leaving but now i heard that she changed her mind and then changed her mind again and now she dosent know what she is doing. I hope she decideds to take that other job because caitlyn applied for her positon and i really want her to get it because we dont see eachother much over the school year. 

well i am off to go make phone calls to my other friends to see how there first day of school went

The last few days every time i want to get online my computer has to freeze 5 or 6 times before it will let me get online then i only can go to a few websites GRRRRRRRR

Rachel went to a Funral today. I feel so bad for her she has had a rough year dealing with things but she is very stronge and i really look up to her. 

Also today Laetetia got her wisdom teeth removed. Me and my mom went to the doller store and 5 below to get her some ballons and things to play with then we went and visted her. she looked really funny you know in the little rascals when the guy was trying to get out of going to the pool so he could have his girl over for lunch so he faked a tooth ach and had that bandage around his cheecks tied up on his head? well thats kinda like what she had i wish i had brough a camra.

My mom decided she wanted to have a mother daughter dinner tonight before i get back into the throws of school(or hell) so we went to olive garden but on the way there a duck was in the middle of the road and we swirved to avoid hitting it the person behind us swirved to but the duck had stoped and it went right under the wheel of the car. Me and my mom started crying. When are people going to relise manassas is over crowded and we are killing are wildlife. Like the lake on ballsford they are cleaning it but they have been for like all summer now and the ducks are ending up at sinclare elementry and thoes are pretty well trafic roads by there. But does our city care? no we just keep building appartment complexes."

someone out there for everyone in the world, why does it feel like I
can't find anyone to call my own??? If someone has a girlfriend that
doesn't live by him and you are in ""love"" with him and they make you
feel so happy every time you see him and he flirts with you why can't
he just give you a chance and go out with you??? My heart is broken
because my love loves another. every single person in my school thinks
that we are going out by he has some one else. So I am left behind
picking up the broken pieces of my heart waiting in the shadows till he
realizes that I'm there for him.</span></font><br>"

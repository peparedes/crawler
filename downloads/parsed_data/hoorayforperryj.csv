"event","<lj-cut text=""a pretty tight survey from ms. molly weeks, the high queen of awesome""><b>1.You can press a button that will make any one person explode. Who would you blow up?</b>
The President.  The Vice President.  Osama bin Laden.  Saddam Hussein.  Tom Cruise.  The Leader of Iran.  Robert Ehrlich.  Any one of those would be super.

<b>2. You can flip a switch that will wipe any band or musical artist out of existence. Which one will it be?</b>
Gwen Stefani's solo career.  Celine Dion.  ""My Humps.""  American Idol.  

<b>3. Who would you really like to just punch in the face?</b>
A lot of the people I (used to) consider friends, unfortunately.  The guys listed for #1.  Terrell Owens.  John Gilchrist.  Johnny Damon.  Bobby Gilligan...sure it was sixth grade, but I always hated that fucker.  I hold grudges.  

<b>4. What is your favorite cheese?</b>
Melted on things.

<b>5. You can only have one kind of sandwich. Every sandwich ingredient known to humankind is at your immediate disposal.What kind of sandwich would you have and what would be on it?</b>
A grilled chicken breast with crab and lobster on it, melted cheese, some Italian spices, lettuce, tomato, and green peppers.  Unless that would taste like ass, in which case remove the lobster and/or the melted cheese and/or the spices.

<b>6. You have the opportunity to sleep with the movie-celebrity of your choice. We are talking no-strings-attached sex and it can only happen once (they will never call you back). Who is it?</b>
Jennifer Aniston.  Keira Knightley.  Evangeline Lilly (Kate from Lost).  Elizabeth Hurley.

<b>7. You have the opportunity to sleep with the music-celebrity of your choice. Same rules as above. Who is it?</b>
Faith Hill.  Shania Twain.  Kelly Clarkson.  Britney Spears.  Debbie Gibson after her teenage years.  (Interestingly enough, I don't really like any of their music.  Except ""Since U Been Gone,"" that shit's just good ol' fashioned girl rock and I ADMIT THAT I LIKE IT RIGHT HERE AND NOW!

<b>8. Now that you've slept with two different people in a row, you seem to be having an excellent day because you just came across a hundred-dollar bill on the sidewalk. Holy shit, a hundred bucks! How are you gonna spend it?</b>
New fairly nice and small digital camera.  A new printer.  A new damn computer.  A boatload of CDs and some DVDs and probably some Marvel comic books.

<b>9. You just got a free plane ticket to anywhere. You have to depart right now. Where are you gonna go?
London or Israel, I'd say.</b>

<b>10. Upon arrival to the aforementioned location, you get off the plane and discover another hundred-dollar bill. Shit! Now that you are in the new location, where are you gonna go to spend that?</b>
Hmmm, in London probably in a book store near Parliament or from the Tate Gallery *drools, smacks self for dorkiness* and in Israel probably an antique or homemade crafts store.

<b>11. An angel appears out of Heaven and offers you a lifetime supply of the alcoholic beverage of your choice. ""Be brand-specific"" it says. Man! What are you gonna say about that? Even if you don't drink booze there's something you can figure out... so what's it gonna be?</b>
Haha, who knows?  I haven't really had all that much to drink.  I don't even know rum.  I kind of like Miller High-Life though, of the very few beers and alcohols I've had.

<b>12. Rufus appears out of nowhere with a time-traveling phone booth. You can go anytime in the PAST. What time are you traveling to and what are you going to do when you get there?</b>
1939.  I'm gonna punch Hitler in the back of a head with brass knuckles.  But oh no, I'm not done!  Then I'm going to Ancient Egypt.  I'm gonna lay low there and watch how they made all that stuff, then I'll free the slaves and give the evil pharoah a superwedgie (provided he has some semblance of undergarments). THEN I'll go figure out what Stonehenge is REALLY all about.  THEN I'll go BACK TO THE FUTURE and kick Tom Cruise in the balls.  Once during the Oprah show.  Once again when he insulted Brooke Shields and the entire illness of depression.  Once more when he cheated on Nicole Kidman with Penelope Cruz.  Once more when he divorced said Australian hottie.  Once more when he decided to do Mission Impossible: III.  AND THEN ONCE MORE when he was with Matt Lauer.  I got yo back Lauer, you tight wit me.  Then I might smack Katie Holmes three times, just because she's REALLY NOT PAYING ATTENTION.

<b>13. You discover a beautiful island upon which you may build your own society. You make the rules. What is the first rule you put into place?</b>
Don't be a fuckwhore or a douchebag.  *Please note: fuckwhores have no relation to whores or those who fuck.*

<b>14. You have been given the opportunity to create the half-hour TV show of your own design. What is it called and what's the premise?</b>
If any of you have seen Jimmy Leathers drunk, which I'm guessing is a big fat NO, you'd understand why he should have a show just for him.  Also, my life could use a sitcom of sorts.  Tons of drama, lots of laughs, plenty of awkward, and a smattering of love for the more sensitive.  It'd be, tight, fo sho.  AT LEAST get me a theme song AND emotional music for important scenes.

<b>15. What is your favorite expletive?</b>
1) Fuck.  2) Bollux.  3) Douchebag.

<b>16. One night you wake up because you heard a noise. You turn on the light to find that you are surrounded by MUMMIES. The mummies aren't really doing anything, they're just standing around your bed. What do you do?</b>
Go back to bed, clearly I'm dreaming.  Wake up again, fucking scream, possibly wet myself, then attack.  I'd probably grab the closest thing to me, which would probably be a battery charger or a lint roller.  Hopefully I'll have the presence of mind to not choose the pillows.  I'm taking those toilet papered weirdos DOWN TO CHINATOWN.

<b>17. Your house is on fire, holy shit! You have just enough time to run in there and grab ONE inanimate object. Don't worry, your loved ones and pets have already made it out safely. So what's the one thing you're going to save from that blazing inferno?</b>
I donno, my CDs?  My art?  Pictures?  I don't know, that's tough.

<b>18. The Angel Of Death has descended upon you. Fortunately, the Angel Of Death is pretty cool and in a good mood, and it offers you a half-hour to do whatever you want before you bite it. Whatcha gonna do in that half-hour?</b>
Instantly I think of the question about girls I could sleep with sans consequences.  However, the more intelligent thing to do would be hang out with my TRUE friends and my close family.

<b>19. You accidentally eat some radioactive vegetables. They were good, and what's even cooler is that they endow you with the super-power of your choice! What's it gonna be?</b>
You know few people seem to pick super-strength.  Normally I would think of invisibility or flying first, but really, super-strength would be fucking awesome.  I would throw cars a lot, I think.  And if I had super speed too, I would throw a cow but then race over to catch it.  I don't know why, but I've always wondered about throwing cows.

<b>20. You can re-live any point of time in your life. The time-span can only be a half-hour, though. What half-hour of your past would you like to experience again?</b>
ugh, talk about sentimentality.  Anyway, the answer is Jenni.

<b>21. You can erase any horrible experience from your past. What will it be?</b>
7th grade.  That was a bad fucking year.  But I would need to keep the lessons learned.

<b>22. You got kicked out of the country for being a time-traveling heathen who sleeps with celebrities and has super-powers. But check out this cool shit... you can move to anywhere else in the world!</b>
I kind of like it here, to be honest.  Maybe Boston or San Fran?  Paris?  But those are just places I've been, I can't really say I'd want to live anywhere I haven't had the chance to check out first.  Although, MARS would be interesting.

<b>23. This question still counts, even for those of you who are under age. Check it out. You have been eternally banned from every single bar in the world except for ONE. Which one is it gonna be?</b>
Fuck if I know, never been to a single one.

<b>24. Hopefully you didn't mention this in the super-powers question.... If you did, then we'll just expand on that. Check it out... Suddenly, you have gained the ability to FLOAT!!! Whose house are you going to float to first, and be like ""Dude check it out I can fucking FLOAT!!""</b>
I bet my Aunt Judy would get a kick out of it.  I wouldn't show my sisters, they'd make fun of me and they'd make it seem lame.  

<b>25. The constant absorption of magical moonbeams mixed with the radioactive vegetables you consumed earlier have given you the ability to resurrect the dead famous-person of your choice. So which late celebrity will you bring back to life?</b>
No question at all.  Phil Hartman.

<b>26. The Celestial Gates Of Beyond have opened, much to your surprise because you didn't think such a thing existed. Death appears. As it turns out, Death is actually a pretty cool entity, and happens to be in a fantastic mood. Death offers to return the friend/family-member/person/etc. of your choice to the living world. Who will you bring back?</b>
Robin.  She was 31 and I was 15.  I will never ever get over it.  Also, I'd like to meet my mom's parents. They shaped the family dynamic for my entire family.</lj-cut>"

now i live with sam jason and joe and tom is here a lot.
those four figured i already had plans for some reason so without asking me they decided to move in together next year.

and hey the faux paz, who had been talking about how awesome it would be to get a house together, up and decided that wouldn't work out and made other plans...without telling me

so i have nowhere to live

my option appears to be: find three roommates quickly so i can move into a four single bedroom apartment...

umm, where should I find these magical roommates?
well i've got one, sam's friend jeremy who i haven't seen or talked to in more than a year.  he should be fun.

the rest of the faux paz don't really need help from me to live somewhere else.

FUCK I HATE MY LIFE WHY AM I ALWAYS A FUCKING OUTCAST.  FUCK FUCK FUCK I COULD NOT BE ANY MORE ANNOYED AND PISSED OFF.  


I'm not going to let this fucking shit ruin my valentine's day
I haven't had a valentine's day in four years

"event","got nostalgic

picked out my favorite photos that I own all time and put 'em here
http://photobucket.com/albums/f299/perryisacoolcat/

also got my art online
http://www.wam.umd.edu/~pgorelik/Website

all in all, life is a ok

my classes are really good and even interesting a lot of the time
I designed a logo for a fake art museum owned by Bill Gates
I welded pieces of steel to each other
I read lots about art history in American, AFrica, and Europe

I love the Faux Paz more than they'll ever know

and i'm turning twenty-one soon, that's tight

and because she'll never see this, i don't have trouble saying Mindy Levine makes me feel great and she's a wonderful wonderful woman

too bad i lack the correct amount of chemicals and hormones in my brain to express this stuff correctly, but whatever, shit happens.  

Love life, kids, it's God's greatest gift.  Although, I don't necessarily believe in God, but it's a lot easier to say ""God"" than explain other shit.  Belief in God, believe it or not, is just plain easier, if only for semantics.

have a good one pallies"

Ok that's not me at all, but man, what a great story!  I was actually scheduled, but I think my mom and I forgot.  Like 1 in the afternoon or summat.  Story: My aunt had her son on her birthday, and I was going to be born on the same day as well...except then it would have been a 5 AM C-Section and my mother wasn't having that, so I was born the day after.
<br><br>

<br><br>
30. SAY A NUMBER FROM ONE TO A HUNDRED:
38.  That's kind of stupid.  *thinks about it for the rest of the night*
<br><br>

Sorry, I promise to be normal now.
<br><br>

Go inside.  And, that kind of works for raining rain, too.  But after that, I'd apologize to God.
<br><br>
46. DO YOU BELIEVE THAT MYSPACE IS THE DEVIL IN DISGUISE?
That's funny coming from a livejournal quiz.  If anything was the Devil, it'd probably be the internet.  Or, just the Devil.  Was one of his/her powers to become stuff?  I just though he/she made deals with people for their souls, you know, the whole temptation stuff.  Speaking of which, I'd sell my soul for a Maryland Men's Basketball National Championship.  You listening, Beelzy?  
<br><br>
47. WHAT IS YOU FAVORITE ANIMAL?
A dog, I guess.  Though, to be honest, I really like humans.  You can have sex with 'em!  *Sheep applaud*
<br><br>
48. WHAT'S YOUR FAVORITE SPORT AND YOUR FAVORITE PLAYER FROM THAT TEAM?
Technically, a sport is not a team.  I don't like Juan Dixon from the Basketball.  But anyhoo, my favorite sport is College Basketball.  My favorite team is...oh I don't know...let's go with Maryland.  And my favorite player...well I'm not too sold on anyone except Chris McCray, so I'll just go ahead and go with Juan Dixon.  I miss you, Juany!  Come back for grad school!
<br><br>
49. WHAT IS GOOD AND WHAT IS EVIL?
GOOD=Clinton.  EVIL=Bush
<br><br>
50. WHO IS YOUR FAVORITE PERSON?
My family, when they choose to be people.  I'm also a big fan of that Maegan character, and that Addie girl I hear so much about those days.  And all those other people my mother secretly pays to be my friends.  Haha, Addie and Maegan got SCREWED outta some cash!  *whimpers*
<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

SHE DOESN'T!  NO ONE KNEW THIS WAS GOING TO HAPPEN AND SHE DIDN'T GIVE ME A FUCKING CAR AND NOW MY WHOLE FUCKING LIFE HAS JUST GONE DOWN THE FUCKING SHITTER.  I AM NOT EVEN BEING DRAMATIC.  I AM A FUCKING JEW ANYWAY EVERYONE EXPECTS ME TO LOVE MY MONEY WELL I'M GOING TO FUCKING MISS IT NOW.  THIS DOESN'T AFFECT ANYONE AS MUCH AS IT AFFECTS ME AND I'M FUCKING SCREWED.</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""explanation, i guess"">so dearest fucking mother says you should save money for travelling

so i finally decide to apply to study abroad

i got my hopes up.  why shouldn't it work out?  it's an art history trip (practically) and i'm a straight A art history student!!!!!

so (after foreshadowing) i didn't get selected.

good, no need to spend the money

except i fucked up my car.  my parents blame me.  i'm out $1500.  no play this winter, got to work.  (ps: i get $5.60 an hour at the job I LOVE.  better quit in order to get actual money...)

and my parents feel it absolutely essential to make sure i feel like shit about it, so they got pissed off and yelled at me for two straight days, right before thanksgiving, which hopefully i won't need to go home for, because who wants to deal with that shit on their break?

I sobbed in front of my friends for a half hour and my parents wouldn't even be nice.  my dad told me to ""get myself together"" and ""stop whining, it's not becoming.""  who the fuck does that?  where the fuck did these people come from?

don't get me wrong, i love them.  this doesn't change.  and as depressed i am right now, because not even my pills can help me now, i'm a wreck, this is a bad fucking time to get diagnosed with all the neuroses as you can fit in a person.

<h1>this Next shit is personal, don't read unless you really know me.  seriously, I'm not kidding.  but if you care, read on, i have no problem with people knowing my life.</h1></lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""this shit is personal, don't read unless you really know me.  seriously, I'm not kidding."">I was just starting to get my faith in God back.  My cousin suffered and died and her alcoholic abusive husband took my favorite nieces to south carolina so my family and I can suffer.  I'm not even kidding, he did it vindictively, it's a fact.  So I stopped believing in God.  I truly did.  Why would God do this to me?  Why?  What did Robin or I or my family do?  Maybe he really does favor the Christians.  They don't seem to get fucked up as much as we do, at least not the last few centuries.  I realize they weren't always the most popular humans on the Earth...  But anyway, I believed in God.  I loved God.  And he was supposed to protect me and my family as long as we loved him.  We were alive and kind of healthy, and that evens out because we certainly weren't the best Jews in the world.  But this?  Robin dead at 31?  My life savings gone?  Depression?  Anxiety?  ADD?  Possible bipolar?  My sisters' depression?  No girlfriend?  No romance?  None for my sisters?  My parents depressed?  My dad in a shitty job?

I mean, you can fucking take this stuff for a while.  Because I don't believe in suicide at all.  LIfe is a fucking privledge and I LOVE it.  But I swear to God I can't take it anymore.  God just isn't there for me.  He's not there.  I can't find him.</lj-cut>"

"event","Soooooo last time I wrote stuff in here I was pissed off.

Sure enough, that happens often.

HOWEVER

I feel that it is rarely warranted.  It seems unlikely that people are REALLY out to spite me as often as I think they are.  I have this little mental blip in my head that when unfortunate things occur I get very angry quickly and it blurs rational thought.  Plus, I'm very paranoid.  Insanely so, in fact.

HOWEVER

None of that matters now.  Becuase two hours with one person can completely change your day week month year.    I couldn't sleep for a while last night.  Sure I was tired, but when you sleep, you can't experience emotion.  And when my only emotion is absolute glee, I shan't waste it with mere sleep.  

<h1>I AM THE HAPPIEST I HAVE BEEN IN FOUR YEARS</h1>

Take a second to think about what has happened in the world and your life in the last four years.  Since September 2001.  

All in all, I'm in a good mood.



And Addie is HIGHlarious.  I heart her a lot and I really wish she will dress like a drunk/dumbass aviator more often.  SO HOTT ALL THE TIME.  My other thought about the wonder of HONK! is that if I hear another pun concerning ducks or feathers or cats or fur I might very well swallow a bottle of aspirin.  But I did really like the show.  I was really really impressed with how funny it was and how beautiful the voices of my friends, the Sutters, are.  How did I not realize this before?  Je ne sais pas.  C'est incroyable.  (Monsieur Incroyable!...Superladies are always trying to get you to tell them your secret identity.  They think it'll strengthen the relationship...HEEEE!)

And I like football.  And Thundercats.  And X-Men.  And Star Wars.  And I'm a nerd.  And Photoshop homework.  And HOUSE with Hugh Laurie on Fox.


Splaflagglemoof!"

Anyone want to actually be my friend?  It's cheap and easy!  I think I'll have applications!

Possible questions:  Will you make me feel like shit?  Will you alienate me all the time?  Will you make me constantly think about being forced to move out?

"event","I did Macbeth with my drama camp kids this summer.  It was a LOT of stress because I didn't know how it would come out but it's my favorite Shakespeare play so I really wanted to do it.  And now an accomplished actress, singer, and teacher has told me it was good!  Should I stop being an art major RIGHT NOW???  No, no I should not.  In two weeks I get to pour molten aluminum into a mold.  My life is really close to being pretty sweeeet.  However, there are somethings in my head that cancel out some goodness, but hopefully either the things in my head will go away or the people who make my head bad will go away.  Hmm, vagueness is annoying, yet rewarding.


Perry-
 
I was wondering where I could get a copy of the script you used for macbeth or if you wrote it- could I get a copy from you?  I thought it was really funny and wanted to use it to supplement class for my 8th graders.  If you can tell me where to get it or email it to me, I would really appreciate it.  Give me a call if you have any questions or objections.  I want to start the unit on Macbeth soon, so I appreciate you getting back to me.  Thanks a lot.  Really.
 
Sincerely,
A.K. Brink  (I directed jr. & sr. conservatory with Kathryn :)"

"event","I preface tonight's entry with a phrase that of the people who understand, only Kate Contel will read:

""I never thought I'd do it, but I did!""

At the time I was talking about smoking pot, but also drinking alcohol...

I never thought I'd drink alcohol.

BUT I DID!

For those of you that know me this is a BIG DEAL, for I had previously sworn it off as a bad thing since it changes the way you think and act.  Blah blah blah my cousin is an alcoholic blah blah blah no one cares, but in truth I had sworn it off for the majority of my natural life.

But then I realized, it is absolutely silly to remain in anger.  

I can't continue to blame Jamie for Robin's death.  I want to, OH God do I want to, but I cannot.  I must learn to release my anger.

And therefore, I have learned to accept alcohol with a large smattering of responsibility.

And then I just fucken let loose.

One beer and five shots of Vodka probably doesn't sound like much to you guys, but to me it's huge.

And I am a happy silly drunk!!!  Finding out I'm not an angry or depressed drunk really made my night.  But I am also extremely easy to coerce into saying things I may later regret.  Oh well, the truth comes out when you're drunk, so better late than never.

I love you all and I love the Faux Paz more than anything else I've ever dreamed to love.  Well, not more than Meredith or Maegan or Addie or Laura or Beth or my family, or life in general, but a whole heck full of love, I swear it!

all in all i'm excited to start the year.

faux paz will be bangin' as usual, and auditions are really soon, so that's also exciting.

i wish i had more time to talk to those i miss
they probably don't realize i miss them

perry, if you read this, call your dentist, because you KNOW you're going to forget, you silly, absent-minded little nerd.  *grabs memo pad, writes down ""call dentist""*

two months ago it was thursday and i totally knew that the next day i had to go to the dentist at 1:15.
the dentist secretary called and i said, ""Oh I know, 1:15 tomorrow.""
FRiday morning I thought how cool it was to not have anything to do during the day.
Friday night, I said, ""Shit!  I forgot!  Wow, that's amazing!""

Yup, I'm that cool."

"event","Man, ""Rescue Me"" is a great show.  Reasons why:

Theme song is ""C'mon C'mon"" by The Von Bondies.

Denis Leary.

The characters are real.  Flawed.  Not entirely likeable.  But realistic.

For some strange reason, they get away with saying ""shit"" and numerous other bad words.

They created the word ""twunt"" as a nicer name for women then other slurs.

Jesus was on the show, in full Passion regalia, and he said he hates dealing with Mary Magdalene's bullshit.  Nearly verbatim.

Denis Leary.

Tuesday nights at ten pm on FX.  Check it out!

I love FX.  It has the best shows and reruns of Buffy.  WOOT!  And action movies with behind the scenes footage!


TNT, aka Law and Order channel, also rules.  ""Into the West"" is tres bien and I like reruns of ER, Judging Amy, Angel, and Law and Order.




Oh TV, you are my truest friend."

work starts tomorrow

wiz rehearsals start tomorrow

I mean today since it's 12:06 AM

Perry J. Gorelik suddenly equals Mr. No Life

But I like work and I like The Wiz so all shall be well, je pense.

I like comic book superheros and The Fantastic Four make me happy inside.

I found my mezzuzah necklace that I got from my parents for my Bar Mitzvah.  It's solid gold.  I had been wearing it non-stop until I lost it sometime junior year of high school.  Turns out I didn't lose it at a Cross Country banquet as I had thought.  It was under my laundry hamper in my bathroom, which--until it broke--was impossible to remove from the bathroom.  

So far this summer I have made $500 mulching, stripping wallpaper, cleaning, and buying things for my mother.  Correction:  I haven't really net grossed $500, because my mom just owed me money for stuff I bought for her, i.e. mulch.  But soon I will be depositing around that sum of moolah, and happiness for that.

Confidence is slowly becoming my friend again because I don't have teachers presently who indirectly make it go away.  Or....it's just coming back and I'm the shit boo yah boo yah.

"event","A - Age you lost your virginity? Should I make a prediction...?
B - Band listening to right now? Well none at this exact moment, but I'm digging some Jack Johnson.
C - Dream car? 2001 Pontiac Firebird, in red.  It will be my midlife crisis buy.
D - Daddy's name? Ivan Zalman Gorelik.  You can't make up names that weird.  Very fitting for my Poppa.
E - Easiest person to make laugh? Annie Powell.  If you know her, you understand.  But... only Arik knows her.  And he doesn't remember people well.  So it's safe to say none of you know her.  But she's a doll, really!  A gem!
F - Food you miss most? Lamb chops.....?  I don't really miss food.  OH NO WAIT.  I MISS BIG BUCKETS OF COOKIE DOUGH.  *drools*  Did I really just call Annie a gem?
G - Any encounters with ghosts? Ghost of Christmas Present.  What a fucker.
H - Person most hated at the moment? Tom Cruise, without a doubt.  But man, he's a good actor, but given the chance, I would END HIM.
I - Interesting unknown fact about yourself? I have seven--make that eight--nipples.  Ok ok, just kidding, the normal three.  But I used to play drumset and I do musical theatre despite a persistent heterosexuality.
J - The first letter of the last person who broke your heart? Going back to eighth grade, we'll go with B.  For Beth.  Shit, she'll never read this, what do I care if I write her name?
K - Kissing with eyes opened or closed? I have kissed two men since the last time I had a meaningful kiss with a woman.  *Raises shotgun, points at temple, prays.......*
L - Last time you did LSD? Man, I would LOVE to do some lesbian samba dancers.  (That took me only thirty seconds to come up with, so a pat on the back is in order, I think.)
M - Most memorable moment you can think of in a minute? Arik's house.  Meh, it'll do.
N - Nicknames? My extended family call me Fuzz because of my hair.  It's an old nickname but a good one.  My high school cross country team called me Ned, because I looked like a guy's swimming coach, despite me not being black, dreadlocked, or physically fit.  They also tried Jewbacca until the other Jew, David, came in with lots of overgrown facial hair.  Since some douche asked me if Perry was short for Perrald (Harry and Harold) my friends have taken to calling me Perrald, which is very acceptable for me.
O - Whats the most valued possession? My Raphael Palmeiro bobble-head.  You're the man, Raffy!
P - Poison of choice? Stabbing.
Q - The last quote you heard: ""Frankly my dear, I don't give a damn.""  AFI's Top 100 Quotes thing.
R - What are you allergic to? Dust, pollen, and the outdoors.
S - Song you sang last? A lot of whistling, primarily to the theme song of Coach.  Also, ""How does Sam, suddenly appear...""
T - Time you woke up? 8:53, because Sam the damn jerk called me and woke me up seven minutes early.  
V - Vegetable you hate most? Sprouts.  Is that a vegetable?
W - What are you the most afraid of? Failure.
X - X-rated love life? Yes, please.
Y - Year you were born? 1985.  
Z - Zodiac sign? Pisces."

"event","1) Total number of books own: Unlike you WACkers, I counted.  Two hundred and seven (207) books are in my room, presently.  But you should probably add 1-48 in the Goosebumps series by R.L. Stine, three others by Stine, about twenty or so Star Wars fiction novels, and probably fifteen miscellaneous books that are all in storage.  Which brings my total to (shit, not math!) 293 books.  I don't know if that's a lot or not, but I keep adding  The tough part is reading them all, and some of them suck, but I'll try to read all that I can.  Oh wait, 297.  

2) The last book I bought: Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, The Bourne Identity, The Merchant of Venice, and the Count of Monte Cristo.  I think they were all bought at the same time, and by bought, I mean on Mall Night, every Friday in the Gorelik home, my parents and I go to the Columbia Mall to eat unhealthy food and look at books we want and if I beg hard enough, my beautiful sap of a father will buy me things.  I'm a poor college student!  My parents should just be happy I still know how to read!  (Arik: Note the word ""still.""  Haha, I just imagined Arik going, ""Do you have three settings?  LIAR!"" Oh I miss Mitch Hedberg.  And yesterday I laminated the Mitch Hedberg papers that I stole from his performance at UMCP.  There's nothing interesting on them, just how to set up the chairs and Mitch's name.  I heart laminating stuff!

3)The last book I read: Currently in the middle of Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy and The Amazing Adventures of Cavalier and Clay.  I honestly cannot remember the last book I finished.  I think I finished The ABCs of Architecture for my architorture class.  The last book I'm sure I finished was Seabiscuit, that was last year.

4)Five books that mean a lot to me:

1. Mila 18 by Leon Uris.  Often quoted by me as my favorite book.  I think that's mostly true.  It's about the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising in 1943.  It's this weird type of historical fiction that Leon Uris writes. They are fiction, but he does SO MUCH research that his novels could be used as textbooks.  In Hebrew school all your fed is hatred for the Nazis and all the terrible things that have happened to the Jews since long before Christ appeared.  Right or wrong, as a practicing Jew in my childhood this book was HUGE for me.  It feeds that hatred in a healthy way.  It let me live through the characters' victories in great detail over villainous Nazis.  In reality and in the book, the Jews of Warsaw were routed and removed in time, but finally Jews fought back, which is something seen oh so rarely in history.  Also in this vein is Exodus by Leon Uris, a story that uses a smuggling of Jewish children from containment camps on Cyprus to the preborn Israel as a means to explain the last one hundred years of Israel's birth and battle with neighboring Arabs.  

2. To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee.  It's soo good!  I can't really fathom how well Lee captures the mind of a child, but the book captures really important issues and has a great ending that, although predictable, was nonetheless very very cool.

3. The Century by Peter Jennings.  It's like a photojournalist and journalist expression of the United States of America in the 20th Century.  I can't remember it very well, or find it in my house, but it was pretty sweet.   

4. The Phantom Tollbooth by Norton Juster.  It's really silly and weird, but I like it a lot.  Nice happy childhood feelings.  

5. Chuck Close by John Guare.  A biography of one of my favorite painters.  He had a freak stroke-type thing that left him paralyzed from the neck down.  Yet his determination to paint allowed him to find a way to continue by putting a paintbrush in his mouth.  And his paintings actually improved and became more impressive.  

Wow, I just kind of wasted the whole morning.  OH well.  :D"

"event","I finally got into my design course.  It took three and a half weeks.  

Quick recap:

Perry didn't want to submit a portfolio because it was too early.

Perry's advisor said to do it, it would get Perry's name out.

Perry submits his portfolio to the Design program.

Two weeks later, Perry reads an email saying he made it in!  How awesome and unexpected!  Good feelings.

Next email tells Perry a mistake was made and he WAS NOT ACCEPTED.

Perry's advisor tells him to talk to Jim Thorpe, the Design head.

Jim Thorpe says ""Don't worry about it, you're in.""  Slightly happy feeling.

Perry tries to register for the class and is denied.

Perry calls the Art Department.  They promise to fix it.

Jim Thorpe calls Perry and tells him he needs to come by and show the portfolio again.  ANGRY FEELINGS.

Jim Thorpe tells Perry he's in, again.

Perry tries to register, again.  He is denied again.

Perry talks to Jim Thorpe.  Apparently Jim Thorpe cannot let me in the class.  Perry has to talk to the professor, Fabio Fabiano.

Perry hunts Fabio Fabiano (yes, that's his real name) down and Fabio Fabiano (can't stop saying it, it just rolls off the tongue) writes down on a piece of paper that Perry should be allowed in.

Perry gives the paper to the Art Department.

Perry's in!




It took three and a half weeks and a whole fucking dumptruck of minutes I'll never get back, wasting my time with Jim ""The Incompetent Fuck"" Thorpe.

But it's over!"

I kind of already knew all that.

I was wrong about my roommate.

I'm still not signed up for all the right classes, but the Head of the Department looked at my portfolio and said I'm in.  So, jerkweed, why won't you lift the registration block already?  ARGHaflaggle.

I AM going to take Steel next year though.  TIGHT!

Annie's going to cut my hair.  Trim it.  Yay for free experiments.

Perhaps double my pills will help me concentrate better?  We shall see.

Made my best drawing so far this year in copying a Welliver landscape.  I really think it's the first landscape I've ever done.  Really interesting.

Big concert May 13.  Please please come!

Three of my pieces are on exhibit in College Park.  None of you will have a chance to see it most likely but...I guess...I thought you should know...?

I love Suzy.  I miss all my highschooling friends and I cannot WAIT for this summer to see them again.

I'm quite stressed right now but that's ok because it's nearing the end of semester and it's to be expected.  But seriously, Chinese is sucking my soul through my nostrils.  I told my mother this and she laughed.  NOT a laughing matter.  Chinese is kicking my ass and waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh bitch and moan.

Hanging out with Maegan and Addie two weeks ago was incredible.  They probably don't realize it but it was wonderful and exactly what I wanted and needed.

"event","I'm going to kill everyone in the art department for trying to destroy my self-esteem and majorly fucking with my future.

If they deny me design classes for a SECOND FUCKING TIME after LETTING ME IN FIRST I will contact every newspaper in the area.  This is the most unprofessional bullshit I have ever seen in my life and they will pay tenfold for fucking me over.

To be concluded when I meet with the department head again Tuesday morning for him to ""go through my portfolio, I think everything will be fine.""

If you wanted to check my motherfucking portfolio first why did you let me in the class in the fucking first place?

What I think happened:
Department Head: So I need to lift the block on Perry Gorelik's registration so he can take ARTT350.
Stupid Bitch Who Fucked Me Over in the First Place: OH yeah, I remember, I told him he was in the program in one email and then in another I told him I made a mistake and he is denied.
Department Head: OH shit, I just told him he could take these classes!
Stupid Bitch Who Fucked Me Over in the First Place: Just call him and tell him you need to see his portfolio and explain to him he's just not good enough.
Department Head: Oh yeah, that's a good idea.  

And the Stupid Bitch (although I'm not sure if I have the right woman) looks and grimaces JUST LIKE CYNTHIA STEPHENS.  The bitch haunts me whereever I go, I guess.

Motherfucker I am so tired of this bullshit.  Definitely considering transferring to UMBC because they know how to treat people and they're smarter and have better facilities anyway.  Why oh why did I pick this dumbfuck school?  

Suck my dick you fucking turtle piece of shit.  AHHHHHHHHHHHHH!


PS: I may not be as fed up as it looks, but it sure is fun to curse, baby."

Things Happening!

Emotions!


Yeah.....no stupid drama in my life, and I am so happy about that.



anyway i just had spring break and I was sick the whole time.  first doctor is not my real doctor, but my real doctor is probably a douche so this idiot would do.  except he wouldn't and he didn't fix anything so i tried to make another appointment but they didn't have room so i said fuck it and went to the school hospital and they fixed me although I still have trouble every morning hearing out of my right ear.  i'm ubercongested around my ear and that's kind of gross.  My fake doctor at Maryland was like, ""I'm giving you Dran-o to get that shit out of your head.""  Nice and literal.  Awesomely enough this did not make my break suck.  ON the contrary, it made it so I could do anything, which I have happily discovered to be one of my favorite pasttimes: not doing things.  Doing stuff is soooo overrated.  Accomplishing nothing?  Kind of cool!  I can't do it all the time, but occaisionally during the school year it's a godsend.

I went to see Macbeth with coolio Brittany whom I had not known well prior.  Twas much fun in my opinion, so it was a good way to end the break.  Arik's hair is funny.  And because I can, I try to name his brothers and sisters:  Avram, Adam, David, Jeremy, Sara, Rachel, Emily, Jen, Sharon...fuck I'm missing one or two.  Yes, indeed that is a lot of siblings.  He's a special little boy.  HEY!  I just remembered my thoughts when I first met him at orientation. ""Hm, he seems like a dork kind of...well he's in front of me so I guess I'll say hi and introduce myself.  I bet he's Jewish.""  And I can say that without feeling bad because I'm 80% sure that's the exact thing he thought to himself when he met me.

I have a SHIT LOAD Of work to do so I'm going to get to painting and studying.  Peace out, lovers.

PS: I never actually say ""peace out lovers.""  I tried to say it just now.  It sounds stupid.

PSS:  Woot."

I AM COOL

umm the Marines called me this morning.  (AT NINE THIRTY.  Is there no end to their evil?)  How about a sum up of the conversation?

<b>Recruiter:</b>  Hi, Perry!  How are you?
<b>Perry:</b>  Sick.  *hacking phlegmy cough*
<b>Recruiter:</b>  Oh, *lies* I'm sorry about that.  I was wondering what you were up to since you graduated...*looks at file*...Oakland Mills High School.
<b>Perry:</b>  University of Maryland.
<b>Recruiter:</b>  Oh ok, cool.  What are you studying?
<b>Perry:</b>  Art history and art studio.
<b>Recruiter:</b> OH uh...*thinks to himself, ""Oh great, another stupid wussy bitch.  Quick, think of a way to salvage this!""*...what are you planning on doing with that?
<b>Perry:</b>  Graphic design.
<b>Recruiter:</b> * puzzled* So um, what do you want to do...with that?
<b>Perry:</b>  *sigh* Um, go into computer graphics, marketing, business, stuff like that.
Recruiter:  *thinks, ""Ahh, computers!  The Marine Corp has computers!  That's my in!  Muahahahaha!""*  Well uh...Perry...*reads* have you ever considered what the Marines can do for you, perhaps paying for school or-
<b>Perry:</b>  NO.
<b>Recruiter:</b>  GREAT!  Well in case you ever wanted to come our way, seeing as how our President cares more about giving us money than the mental or physical health of his own uberbangable but incredibly dumb and slutty and without a plausible future in any form of money making business daughters, let me see if you're eligbile...
<b>Perry:</b>  Umm-
<b>Recruiter:</b>  You do any sports in high school?
<b>Perry:</b>  Cross country.
<b>Recruiter:</b>  (fucking pussy) I mean uh...GREAT!  So have you um, had any physical problems?
<b>Perry:</b>  Weak joints.  [I forgot to mention diagnosed with ADD, anxiety, depression, seasonal asthma, outside allergies, bad knees, pregnancy, etc.]
<b>Recruiter:</b>  Oh ok, so that's like...what exactly?
<b>Perry:</b>  My shoulder pops out a lot.
<b>Recruiter:</b>  *thinks, ""Great, another ten minutes of my life I won't get back.""* OH MAN, I'm so sorry, that kind of makes you uneligible.
<b>Perry:</b>  *thinks, ""about fucking time they realized that*
<b>Recruiter:</b>  Well, I hope you feel better, and good luck at <b>UMBC.</b>  


HOPEFULLY THEY'LL NEVER CALL ME BACK EVER AGAIN!!!!!  YAY!!!  FINALLY THE MILITARY HAS REALIZED I AM ABOUT AS USEFUL TO THEM AS A DUMPTRUCK FULL 70-PAGE THESIS PAPERS ON MILITARY ETHICS IN WARTIME!

oh wait

ummm, yeah


so, in conclusion, I am a brittle, delicate, little cakeboy and it's about damn time the military got wise of this.  How ""Art History and Art Studio"" did not clue them in on this in the first place is beyond me.  

I'm sick, but everyone have a great spring break!  OR, enjoy class...SUCKAS!"

1 minute ago: Was filling out this same damn survey, the browser shut down, stupid work computer.  I didn't mean it!  Don't shut down!  Don't shut down!  
1 day ago: Perry engaged in a battle with the University of Maryland Library System...it was a draw.  WE SHALL MEET AGAIN, COPY MACHINES!!
1 week ago: I was happy because I MADE A CD WOOTWOOTWOOTWOOTWOOTWOOTWOOT you are jealousXalot (shut UP Maegan I can't make original thoughts)....  OHH in honor of Amy, true story, last Friday night I watched FIVE hours of Buffy off of Tivo and finished the fifth season and uh, yeah there was a tear or two, no lie.
1 month ago: February 9th....ummmmm...I slept and....ate....things.
1 year ago: I was best buddies with MURGHAN AH LURVE YOO MURGHAN LOVELOVELOVE*pop*
5 minutes ago: thefacebook.com was eating my soul, and I LIKED IT.
5 days ago: March 4.  ummm.  Friday?  I went home to see my doggy and mommy and sisters and daddy and celebrate my birthday with wonderful Garlic Bread and got PRESENTS that may or may not include a fifty dollar book about Marvel Comics......I AM TOO COOL FOR.....THINGS!!!
5 weeks ago: I rejected Amy.  Oh no wait, no I didn't.  AMY, WHY ARE YOU SADDED???  Perry=out of loop
5 months ago: no clue
5 years ago: hold on...2004, 2003, 2002, 2001, 2000 ok I'm there.  Ummmm I wasn't dating Jen anymore.  I didn't hate her either because we made friendly again at the Pajama dance.  And I wasn't dating Jenni because that didn't start til her birthday which is...May 22, if my memory serves me well.  So I uh, went to King's Dominion, maybe?  I uh, was falling asleep every afternoon while trying to read biology textbook.  I HATE YOU, BIO TEXTBOOK.  A POX ON YOUR HOUSE.
I am: busybusybusybusySTALLING
I am not: making enough money this semester, boo-urns
I hurt: above my tooth because i was chewing on a pen and it slipped and OWSERS look its lots of pain
I love: CAPITAL LETTERS
I hate: longing for that which seems farthest away.  NEEDING that which I don't have.  Being unable to stop thinking about these facts.
I fear: The Co-Op.  IT SMELLS BAD with all the healthy food and lack of meat or milk.  SCARY.
I hope: Natalie Portman or a smart hott chick will fall in love with me.  DO IT NOW.
I hear: Good song!  ""That's the Way We Get By"" by Spoon on YahooMusic Launchcast personal radio station.
I crave: blargafiggle, no comment
I regret: a great deal.  I especially regret that all my stories that made me who I am, that people like Meredith love and remember me by, now seem depressing to everyone I've gotten to know this year.  Now I bring them down and I no longer wish to tell my stories.  My life is to fucking depressing, apparently, for the rest of humanity.  Fuck that shit.  (Editores note: this might do better under I HATE.)
I cry: for Michael Jackson.  So much talent, man!  Uch, it makes me sad.
I care: about true friends and close family (Aunt Judy) and PUPPYKINS.  What I would do now for my black clothes to be covered in fur...
I always: try to be happy!  it's hard!
I believe: in a thing called LOVE!  BOO YAH!
I long: Well, no actually, I short.  Sad state of affairs.
I feel alone: well uh, right now I AM alone.  Except for the group of thirtysomething knitters in the room next to me.  I want to know what's so damn funny over there.  They should knit me a hat!  YOU SHOULD KNIT ME A HAT!  ahemmaegangetoffyourassquitschoolandmakemeahatahem.
I listen: to fucking awesome music.  and my friends, whenever possible.  at least I think so.
I hide: from awkward situations, haha.  If I see someone I don't feel like talking to, I go the other way, no lie.  Sometimes I feign ignorance, ""OHHH, I totally didn't see you there!""  Life's easier when people think I'm unobservant as all hell.
I drive: my friends to the breaking point, as it seems in my head.
I sing: A SOLO!!!!!!!  ""Colorblind"" by Counting Crows now comes in the KEY OF PERRY G
I dance: all the damn time, i get so bored, just gotta bust a move
I write: Chinese characters, aka Hanzi, all the damn time and that class is HIZZARD
I breathe: (I want to say something funny, but uh, I got nothing)
I play: Teagames.com and it steals my soul, but I LIKE IT.  And Minesweeper, woot!
I miss: Grace Pattison, more than she'll ever know.  And Lainifer.  
I search: for my gloves and hat and shoes, like every morning.  and my car in big parking lots.
I learn: That two winter hats are better than one.  FUCK YOU, WIND!  MUAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!
I feel: tie red
I know: how to say ""I drive to the subway station and take the green line to Ronald Raegan National Airport."" in Mandarin Chinese
I say: usually whatever comes into my head, good or bad
I succeed: at keeping a 3.4
I fail: at getting As in my art studio classes :C
I dream: about having a puppy when i'm all growned up and I shall call him Squishy and he shall be my squishy.  Or I'll call him Spartacus.  Or Agamamnon.  But ain't no way he'll be Rover or Toto.
I wonder: how late I'll be up tonight doing architorture homework
I want: a million dollars
I have: four pounds of acrylic paint in my backpack right now
I give: money to good causes instead of blood, which makes me feel good, because I do not like people taking my flesh.
I fell: for my friend, and now there is no friendship basically, unfortunateness
I fight: with my dad.  He has a big belly, I can't help it, it just asks to be punched.  I think he likes it, I think it makes him feel young.  Course I also don't think he can't feel anything he's go so much dad fat.
I wait: for Natalie Portman to come to her senses (though I probably wait in vain)
I need: to dance!  Woot!  DANCE dance DANCE dance DANCE!!!  Jump and skip and run and YELL and Bjork is scaring the shit out of me right now and I need to get back to my dorm to do my homework and drink coke woot!  Night all!

"event","So I haven't updated since Winter Break.  Really I don't care to, but since Suzy told me to like a month ago, I guess I will do so.

Perry got a job at the Art and Learning Center.  He takes registrations for noncredit classes on painting, drawing, cooking, and lots and lots of dancing.  He processes credit card transactions and keeps the classrooms clean...somewhat.  The people who work there are mostly Jewish, and mostly Lesbian.  My bosses are awesome.  But I have yet to get a paycheck.  Quite boourns.

I'm taking painting and drawing 2.  It's tough, and quite often I am pissed off about not creating something I can be proud of.  I constantly fight with myself about making myself enjoy that which I love.  It's tough, but I'm getting better.  I'm really really working hard on becoming a better artist.  But, when I get really aggravated, I get upset and feel like I should just drop that major anyway.  I still have art history...  I don't know.  I'm not taking any art history classes, and I don't like it.  I couldn't get in one.  It really pisses me off how class subscription occurs at this university.  It sucks so bad, I don't really see how I can take Chinese next year.  And I love the challenge and art of that language.  But, I really need to you know...do my major stuff.  School bites, generally.

So um, I'm twenty now.  Weird.  But really, it's no different in anyway.  Sorry, nineteen year olds.  You've nothing to look forward to, at least until 21.  Ha, like that matters for me...

I made a cd with my A Capella Group.  The University of Maryland Faux Paz (you pronounce the last z).  I'm REALLY excited for it.  I'm vocal percussing on four of ten tracks.  It's crazy, literally insane.  

I'm bored with this.  Enjoy!"

"event","My mom is kind of really really really annoying right now.  Doesn't seem to understand that I may not want to get up early during my winter break.  I'd say she's being a bitch, but really she's not.  She can be occaisionally, but I know that I have it better than so many, I just can't bring myself to say she's worse than she is.  Love is what I have and receive, and that's what counts more than any petty emotion I feel when she pisses me off.

I've been working a lot over the break.  I want so badly to earn enough money to go on a vacation.  But I can't just get any job.  I can't work retail.  CompUSA was hell.  Trying to get me to sell stuff to people, when they don't want it, I don't want to give it to them because it's a shit offer, and all I want to do is send them home quickly.  AND MY BOSS WAS LUMBERGH FROM OFFICE SPACE, I KID YOU NOT.  I don't want to do that shit again.  If you're reading this pray for me, cross your fingers, sleep in your pajamas inside out, and say ""rabbit rabbit"" so I may in fact get this job I'm going for.  PS: pray also that I fucking remember to call him back.  And my therapist.  And my dentist.  Remembering shit is so hard!  For instance, taking my pills.  I went two weeks straight!  Then I missed two out of four days.  It's soo damn hard!  I don't know why.  I just kind of fail at life in that respect.

On one of my pill bottles it has a warning label that reads like this:
<b><h3>DO NOT DRINK</b></h3>
Alcoholic Beverages
<h5>when taking this medication</h5>

In reading this I was quite confused.  
First thought: ""If I can't drink, how do I swallow the pill?  Oh wait, there's more.""  
Second thought: ""Is this actually propoganda for anti-alcohol?  Oh wait there's more.""  
Third thought: ""Is this going to make me drowsy?  Eh who gives a damn.""

On second thought (or fourth) that wasn't really an interesting thing to say.  But sadly, you read it anyway.  Kinda sucks to be you then.  Hm.

I'm taking five classes this semester.  One is one credit and has yet to have a scheduled time, despite the fact that school starts in less then a week.  I believe it's just me talking to my teacher, affectionately called Tanya.  I have no idea what this ""class"" will entail, but considering I've been under her tutelage for two years now and I'm supposed to have finished my painting for her soon, I bet that might come up in casual conversation.  Then I'm taking Chinese, which is SIX credits.  Yeah, there's some work involved in that, but weird work.  Then painting and drawing, three credits each.  And finally a class on Architecture, Power, and Public Policy.  So in looking down my textbook list, I saw this: no books listed, no books listed, no books listed, no books listed...........Two books on architecture.  
That's it, just TWO BOOKS!  Forty bucks later I'm done book shopping.  Sam's girlfriend spent like $650!  Unless that's someone else entirely, I can't remember.  But wow!  But don't worry kids, I'll get my comeuppance.  Drawing pads, charcoal, charcoal pencils, pastel charcoals, pastels, erasers, drawing pencils, markers, color pencils, stiff papers, glossy papers, watercolor paints, acrylic paints, oil paints, brushes, canvases, etc.....that don't come cheap by any stretch of the imagination.  But still, only two books really makes me happy.  Because I don't like reading much.  Well, I'm really weird about reading.  I really only want to read Classic Novels.  Shakespeare.  1984.  The Giver.  I don't know why, but I feel like if those books are the ""classics"" then I can only better myself by reading them.  There's no guarantee I'll like them, but yet I don't mind reading them at all.  And honestly, I don't read much.  I just can't sit still for very long and read, unless I have to, like when waiting in line or something.  ADD is kind of annoying like that.  

I updated, aren't you proud?"

"event","1. What did you do in 2004 that you'd never done before?
hang out with drunks... and enjoy myself 

2. Did you keep your New Years resolutions, and will you make more for next year?
fuck if i know

3. Did anyone close to you give birth?
Yeah, my cousin Lois.  Stephen, age 3, has a little sister now, Rachel.  Very Jewish names.

4. Did anyone close to you die?
my dog, almost.

5. What countries did you visit?
REALLY SORE SUBJECT, SO FUCKING PISSED.  although I never really planned for it this year, just next.

6. What would you like to have in 2005 that you lacked in 2004?
the same thing I'll never get...

7. What date from 2004 will remain etched upon your memory and why?
My first concert with the Faux Paz.  Err, donno the date of that.  Like three weeks ago.  No wait, November 19th.  That IS three weeks ago.  Score.

8. What was your biggest achievement of the year?
we'll see when my grades come out

9. What was your biggest failure?
social life

10. Did you suffer illness or injury?
I was sick like three times for no reason, it was uberannoying.

11. What was the best thing you bought?
I don't buy things.  So the books I bought my dad for his birthday.  They had numerous pictures drawn by a famous caricaturist.  I can't remember the dude's name at the moment.  OH no wait!  Al Hirschfeldt, although the spelling is suspect.  He's awesome.

12. Whose behavior merited celebration?
The only thing coming to mind is Julia Hejl.  I donno why, I guess she just makes me happy.  Guess that's why I married her....... :D

13. Whose behavior made you appalled and depressed?
Wasn't too thrilled with the guy that hit my dog and fled the scene.  The piece of cardboard next to me and my hammer can attest to that.

14. Where did most of your money go?
I DO NOT FUCKING KNOW!!!  Probably hanging out with people, movies in D.C. and the like.  Defenitely worth it, if so, but still, where's all my MONEY????

15. What did you get really, really, really excited about?
I think the Orioles game where we beat the Yankees at home, had ALL my Easton Hall kids there, and the Os scored six against two different pitchers.  I think the final was 14-8.

16. What song will always remind you of 2004?
Wow Jen, way to like, know the answer perfectly.  I shall try to use her template.  (Five seconds later)  Yeah no way, I can't remember a song for each season, so uh, here's what comes to mind:  Jimmy Eat World, Coldplay, Dexter Freebish, Ben Folds, and Jason Mraz.

17. Compared to this time last year, are you happier or sadder? At the moment, I feel sadder.  But that's probably because of my final tomorrow morning and me leaving my pills at home.  I think on the whole I'm happier.
ii. thinner or fatter? Perry = tub o' lard
iii. richer or poorer? AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!

18. What do you wish you'd done more of?
Reading for leisure (another good answer, Jen, well done.)  I also wish I stopped forgetting about ten-page papers due two days later.  (I only did it once, but wow, bad news bears)  OHH, let's not forget exercising.  I went to the gym ONCE all year.  See above comment concerning lard.

19. What do you wish you'd done less of?
Planning, failing, planning, failing, planning, NOTHING HAPPENING

20. How will you be spending Christmas?
Same way every year.  Chinese Food and a movie, where I will apparently NOT see Jen working at the movie theater.  (At first I typed ""theater"" like ""theatre,"" but I thought that looked pretentious.  Aren't inner monologues fun?)  And a message to the Gentiles:  STAY THE HELL HOME.  IT'S ""JEWS' DAY OUT.""

22. Did you fall in love in 2004?
I don't fall, I plummet.

23. How many one night stands?
guess

24. What was your favorite TV program(s)?
Sportscenter, ER, Buffy during the summer, and sports in general.

25. Do you hate anyone now that you didn't hate this time last year?
Maybe I hate less people, that would be fun.

26. What was the best book you read?
Seabiscuit.

27. What was your greatest musical discovery?
Coldplay.  I love 'em.  And presently, as in just this week, Jay and the Americans. 

28. What did you want and [receive]?
The Yankees to NOT win the World Series.  The Orioles to come in third place and be competitive.  How about the Wizards, eh?  11-6, WOOT!  OH WAIT!  Best thing ever.  I made it into the Faux Paz!!!  They probably made a big mistake musically by letting me in, despite me going PMPF PAH PMPF PAH in a twisted form of vocal percussion, but it's too late now for them to throw me out so MUAHAHAHAHAHA!  Also happy sounding, I received several wonderful and beautiful relationships with wonderful and beautiful people in which most of them do not have Livejournal so will never ever know I said this.  Except my wife.  Oh yeah, uhhh, I'm married.  Hahahaha!  Whodathunk?

29. What did you want and not get?
Terps Football to be good.  Redskins to be good.  Terp Basketball to win tough games (so far).  AND SOME ASS.  I DID NOT GET ASS.  (Probably because I keep referring to stuff as ASS like a big douchebag.)  ((PS: it's not that type of marriage.))

30. What was your favorite film of this year?
Hands down, Garden State.  Close seconds = I <3 Huckabees, Kill Bill 2

31. What did you do on your birthday?
OH GOD, was that Hooters?  Lemme just tell any men who will ever read this:  The Hooters in Washington D.C. is FALSE ADVERTISING.  And some stupid fucking cop yelled at me on my birthday!  (Thanks to Erin, for telling said cop that it was my birthday, so he could make yet ANOTHER assanine comment.)

32. What one thing would have made your year more satisfying?
God, if you don't know by now...

33. How would you describe your personal fashion concept in 2004?
Errr, slowly developing one!  I have tight shirts from the Gap!  (Interesting fashion note: the other day, I split my fucking pants right down the crotch.  See above notes about me being a fatass.)

34. What kept you sane?
Nearly every time, Meredith Brenner.  Most of my friends in general, but especially the lovely Ms. Brenner.

35. Which celebrity did you fancy the most?
Natalie Portman, I remained loyal.

36. What political issue stirred you the most?
War, and medicare policy, although I don't understand it.

37. Who did you miss?
Since you're the ones who read this, Jen, Julia Michelaieaowghorgh8icz, Allison, etc.  I really ought to hang out with you guys more.  Haven't seen you in like a million years.

38. Who was the best new person you met?
Hands down, Maggie Crenshaw.  Too bad she'll never read this, MUAHAHAHAHA.  You know what?  I've never typed nor said ""Hands down"" in my life.  Interesting.

39. Tell us a valuable life lesson you learned in 2004.
Errr, ummm, jeans can be fashionable?  Nice shoes are a good thing?  A belt is very important?  Extra large Terp shirts that I got for free are not a plus?  

40. Quote a song lyric that sums up your year.  

(This is just a lyric I discovered this year, and it rocks, and it ALWAYS has significance to me)
I never said ""Thank You"" for that.  
Now I'll never have a chance.  
May angels lead you in.  
Hear You Me my friends.  
On sleepless roads the sleepless go, may angels lead you in."

<b>So what does all that mean?
I'll let a guy explain</b>

nowa terp (9:52:48 PM): you must be cool...
nowa terp (9:52:52 PM): your in faux paz

<b>I COULD NOT BE A HAPPIER PERSON RIGHT NOW!</b>
Faux Paz is an a capella group here on campus and I auditioned for them and made it!  First I auditioned for PandemoniUM because Meredith wanted me to do it with her and that wasn't too big of a deal.  I made call backs, so did she, but neither of us made it.  I think Panda did a bad job anyway, the call back stuff was really confusing, I don't know how else I could have done.
Anyway, the group I really wanted to see if I could join was Faux Paz.  I had seen them twice last year and I was convinced they were the best.  Still am.  I absolutely love them and now I AM THEM.  I still can't believe it.  Unfortunately, the only auditioned boys this semester, so Meredith did not get a chance to prove to them her skillz.  She woulda made it, no doubt, but whatcha gonna do?  I wish I could have it both ways, but no one can.  I LOVE YOU, MER!  I sang well.  Well enough to make call-backs.  But the other guys were vocal music majors or theatre school alums, I just didn't think I would stand a chance.  Luckily for the Faux call-backs I only had to learn two parts to their song instead of three, so I could keep track much easier.  Still, I could not for the life of me match pitch.  I was just so confused.  They kept switching who was on my part with me in order to help me but by then I was a lost cause.  I left KNOWING I didn't make it, and turned my mind toward absolutely fucking up my voice at the football game.  I was upset because I felt that I absolutely nailed the song (Ben Folds Five - Army).  They had sung it a few years ago, too, so they even sang along!  They even had me come in after I was done to resing it, this time in a key lower, and I was still good.  So I was just uberconfused.  

Then the phone call.  I had my phone with me all the time.  Well, it was on the window sill so I could get the best reception.  Midnight rolls around and NO CALL.  I was upset, AGAIN, because Panda never actually called me.  They lost my number and emailed me the next morning.  :C.  Finally I get hungry, get my soup and head to the lounge when Jason comes out saying, ""Perry, your phone's ringing!""  I flipped out, dropped my stuff, screamed some obscenity and ran passed him to the room.  He had my phone with him...  Another obscenity shouted.  Pick up the phone finally and I can hardly hear what she's saying.  I hear, ""Hold on."" and then it's just some random song.  I was like, ""Did they put me on hold?  They fucking have a song when they put me on hold?  Wow!""  So finally I walk to the lounge near the window when I hear, ""Do you know what this means?""  
""Ummm, no, I didn't hear a word.""  
""We sang to you!  You're a Faux!""  
""Are you shitting me?""  
""No!""
""....ummm, sing it again!""
""(to the Flintstones theme song) You are, our newest member, in the Faux Paz family!  something something something END something And now we hope you'll be our friend!!!""

How cute is THAT????  I walked out of the lounge calmly.  Opened my door.  Saw people in my room doing homework, and I fucken screamed ""I MADE IT!"" at the top of my lungs.  I couldn't believe it.  
It's just like, you see these practical professionals perform and you automatically assume you don't have a chance.  Why bother?  So I didn't.  Mer asked me to join Mock so I thought wtf why not?  It was a wonderful year with Mockapella and I'm very very sad to leave them, but I have to.  I have to try something different, just to see if I can do it.  I love Mock.  I love the people in Mock.  I love the songs we sang.  I love it.  But after Friday night at the All-Nighter (for which I have to sing a NEW SOLO, that's nuts), I am an ex-member.  That's really sad for me.  But I remain optimistic.  They were happy for me for the most part and that made me feel sooo much better.  I'll be glad to help them in anyway I can for the rest of their existence, no matter how much the other groups on campus shit on them.  

But now, I am a happy happy man!

Meredith is awesome, and here's why:
I got pissed at her for something silly, well I wasn't really pissed, I was just messing around.  So I told her she's off my buddy list and I pressed the invisible button that makes everyone think I got offline.  She kept talking to me however.  She FUCKING KNEW I hadn't gotten offline!
The next day, I find myself writing the line, ""Isn't that ironic?""  So I think, ha, I'll be cute and write, ""Don't you think?""  Meredith replies, ""Isn't it ironic, yeah I really do think.""  The best part is that she thought she was being cute by responding with alanis morrissette lyrics.  We both had the same exact idea.  We're fuckin psychic.  A mental link.  It's freakin scary.  We know each other better than the other knows themself.  I call her out for stuff all the time.  If she tells me she said something mean to a person who deserved it, I'll know she just thought it and acted polite as usual.  If I tell her I'm busy working, she'll know I put up a random away message and went to play Goldeneye on Arik's N64.  But she'll pretend that I tricked her, because she knows she's smarter than me and it makes me feel good to think I can trick her.  Wait now I'm confused as to what the hell I'm talking about because there were too many damn pronouns in that sentence.  Hmmm.  

Much love to everyone!
Goodnight!"

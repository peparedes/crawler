http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070201/ap_on_re_us/suspicious_devices

Some marketing company put Lite-Brite type things all over Boston depicting characters from Aqua Teen Hunger Force... and Homeland Security had to come take them down because people thought they were bombs. The poor guy who put the light things out got arrested. Ohh I love America.

Other exciting news: I met a goon yesterday! My sister got into USC! I witnessed a major car accident this morning (fortunately I was not involved this time)! ANDDDD sorority recruitment begins tomorrow! Yay!"

"event","Ok guys. Right now I am so so SOOOO excited because I had the most exciting day ever and I literally cannot wait to tell everyone on livejournal all about it.

<lj-cut text=""long, exciting,  super detailed  version"">Today the weather in Boston was BEAUTIFUL.....so I decided to go for a run outside instead of in the gym. (I loooooove running outside). Anyway, I ran the same loop I always do, which is like 3 miles, and I was almost finished with my run (literally I was a block away from home) when there was this crosswalk, in front of a freeway exit and the cars have a stop sign. So I get to this crosswalk and I stop and look, and there's a car slowing down to stop at the stop sign. Because when you have a stop sign behind a crosswalk and there are zillions of pedestrians out, you stop.... duh. So then I happily start walking across the crosswalk. But instead of stopping, the guy suddenly speeds up and goes right through the stop sign and I GOT HIT BY A CAR!!!!!

Now when I say I was hit by a ""car"", I'm using the word very liberally. Really a more accurate description would be ""gigantic van"". To give you an idea.... when I got hit, I was eye-to-eye with the <i>grill</i> of this thing. And I'm 5'4""!! So this was not like being hit by a little sports car, this was like being hit by a giant moving metal wall. According to witnesses, I was thrown about 8 feet and landed on my head. (It would have been kind of fun, actually, if it weren't for the fact that I thought I was about to die).

So guess what happened next!!! Ok, I probably kinda spoiled the surprise because I'm writing a livejournal post right now so obviously you can tell I didn't die or go into a coma or anything. But after getting hit by a car, being thrown 8 feet, and landing on my head on the concrete, I just kinda got up and was like, ""oh wow, my head hurts"" and went to go sit on the curb.

Then a lot of people came over to help me and everyone was asking me my name and if I was ok and telling me it wasn't my fault and all this stuff. And then a whole bunch of police cars came, and then an ambulence came, and they strapped me into the little bed thingy and put a neck brace on me and I GOT TO RIDE IN AN AMBULENCE!!!! It was the coolest thing ever. When you're inside it, you barely hear the sirens at all, it's crazy. I don't know how they soundproof it so well. Also, this awesome lady was running behind me and saw the whole thing happen and described it all to the police, so then I invited her to come with me in the ambulence. I chatted with her and the ambulence people the whole time we were driving to the ER and one of the ambulence guys was like, ""wow are you sure you're okay? Whats 1,002 times 47?? Ha, ha, just kidding, don't answer that"". But I said, ""Dude... I go to MIT.... it's 47,094"". Hahahahaha I am so awesome.

Anyway, we got to the hospital and they took me to the actual ER, like where the really important people go. Like, people could have totally been dying in the room next to me (actually, I could hear those heart monitor beeping things everywhere, and I heard one of them go flat for a long time so somebody might have seriously died). That freaked me out a little but it was also kind of an exciting adventure. My new friend who had been jogging behind me stayed with me, and we talked for a really long time and she is really, really, really awesome. Also, it turns out she works at JPMorgan and when she found out I'm a management major at MIT, <b>she said she could probably get me an internship at JPMorgan</b>. YES YOU READ CORRECTLY. I get hit by a car, and then what happens? Oh, right, I get my dream internship offered to me. God I love my life. And she gave me her number and said to call her if I need anything at all, so I called her right away afterwards to thank her and we're probably going out for coffee sometime soon because we had so much fun talking in the ER.

Well, they finally made my new friend leave because they had to check out my entire body to make sure I didn't have a broken neck or anything (I had been strapped down and wearing a neck brace for like an hour at this point). They were amazed because they said my neck and my back were totally fine, and I had a bump on my head but it wasn't a concussion. They also had to check to see if I was bleeding internally, and guess how they did that? WITH AN ULTRASOUND!!!!!! So I got to have an ultrasound done and I could see my heart beating and all my internal organs and everything, and it was one of the coolest things I've ever seen in my life.

Then I spent another long period of time sitting around in my hospital bed, but the doctors were all really cool and I think they liked me because I was so cheerful and friendly to them despite having just been hit by a car. So all the doctors kept coming into my room to say hi to me, and one doctor came in with one of those machines that breathes for you when you're unconscious, and she said ""don't worry--this isn't for you!"" Except I had no idea what the thing was, so I asked her to show me, and she spent like 10 minutes showing me what it is and how it works. It was so awesome!!! She was like, ""It's so nice to have an ER patient who can talk to me and be in a good mood--all of mine are always unconscious!"" Also, some other doctors came in and showed me how the blood pressure things work, and it was all so exciting. I feel like I know so much about medical equipment now!! Everyone kept asking me what I was in for and when I said I was hit by a car, they would look so shocked and say they've never seen anyone in such good condition after being hit by a car. Plus some of the doctors were young, attractive men so it was fun hanging out with them :)

I also had a bruise on my hip, my elbow, and my knee, and 3 minor cuts on my hand so then I had to go get x-rays done. In the end, they decided only to x-ray my hand because everything else seemed ok. But nothing was broken, and the cuts were small enough that I didn't even need stitches so they let me go. Well, actually, they let me go use their computers for facebook so I could get my friend's number to have her come pick me up (since I was running I didn't have my phone, ID, or any money on me!).

Anyway, I'm super glad I'm not dead, and I'm even more glad that I have NO injuries. I SERIOUSLY could have died, and instead I have a couple of bruises, cuts, and a bump on my head. And NOT EVEN A CONCUSSION.... after flying 8 feet and landing on my head, I do not even have a concussion. I'm not even on any medication except Tylenol...they prescribed Valium but I really don't think I'm gonna have any need for it. They also told me not to be alone for the next 24 hours just in case I somehow get worse, so if you live in Boston and want to hang out with me tonight, feel free to come visit :)

</lj-cut>
But just to recap in case you are too lazy to read my entire post--I was hit by a giant van, thrown 8 feet, and landed on my head on the concrete... and here is the full list of my injuries:
-Bump on my head (NOT a concussion)
-Bruised knee, hip, and elbow (NO broken bones)
-3 cuts on my left hand (NO stitches)

I. AM. AWESOME.

I feel like I'm going to die soon in some really boring, unexciting way because I've miraculously survived waaayyyy too many near-death experiences..... I should TOTALLY be dead by now."

Here's a cool idea: sign up for the Gallon Challenge at your dorm!! As one of our friends put it, ""I know 400-pound guys who can't do this...and you're, like, 40-pound girls, what are you thinking?!""

So of course my roommate Katie and I signed up just to prove everyone wrong. COOL IDEA.

Look how confident we were before we started.
<img src=http://img294.imageshack.us/img294/9271/library10843am.jpg>

Jason (left) was confident too, but he was ultimately able to down the whole gallon. Unlike us girls.
<img src=http://img473.imageshack.us/img473/9441/library10945xr.jpg>

This may just become my new facebook picture soon:
<img src=http://img280.imageshack.us/img280/6780/straightoutofthejug7du.jpg>

This guy had the right idea.
<img src=http://img384.imageshack.us/img384/7508/library10872sn.jpg>

After like 15 minutes we were like ""OH GOD MAKE IT STOP.""
<img src=http://img400.imageshack.us/img400/1953/library11009ur.jpg>

Our friend Lindsay and our 3rd roommate, Kaitlyn. Look how happy they are. They don't have to drink a whole gallon of milk.
<img src=http://img280.imageshack.us/img280/8792/thavetodrinkmilk6gr.jpg>

Our buddy Jason finished the gallon. He celebrated for about 30 seconds before he puked the whole gallon back up.
<img src=http://img195.imageshack.us/img195/3941/jasontriumphs0vj.jpg>

And there you go. Proof that girls can (almost) drink like men. Except that Katie and I both quit after like 1/3 of a gallon. Sorry about the lack of disgusting milk-barfing pictures, but I don't like yucky stuff.

In other news, I'm spending Thanksgiving with my roommate Kaitlyn who lives in Boston, and then we're road-tripping down to New York to go shopping and see Fiddler on the Roof on Broadway and hang out with our other roommate Katie. I'm really stoked even though I miss everybody back home. Boston's great, but it's just.......not Portland. I come home for Christmas in a month though! A longer/more emo friends-only post will probably be coming soon, if I ever find time to write a real update.</lj-cut>"

"event","Last friday i was driving to casey's and I heard the Vitamin C song on the radio and I started to cry. I don't think i'll miss high school though. I'm so ready to move on.

Anyway, i decided to be like everyone else on my friends page and make a list of memories from the past 4 years, so here you go: <lj-cut text=""list"">

<h3>FRESHMAN YEAR:</h3>
<b>** Annie Get Your Gun</b>, and Bridget and Briana's song ""there's no business like ho business""
<b>** Anna!!!</b> We met freshman year and became inseparable. We were both cheerleaders and we coordinated our outfits, read the same books (including the dictionary haha), bought the same violin case, and spent all our free time stalking ""Yoshi"" and ""Darth Vader"". hahahhahaha.
<b>** McFakeHair!!!</b> How could anyone forget our sweaty, toupee-wearing, perverted ex-orchestra teacher, who was later fired and sent to prison as one of the world's leading child pornographers...
<b>** Shawn Martin</b>, aka Madonna, complete with boobs, a tube top, and a miniskirt.
<b>** Nicole Overturf</b>, aka Romeo, complete with a sock stuffed down her pants.

<h3>SOPHOMORE YEAR:</h3>
<b>** Breaking my toe</b> on my exercise machine. My mom sewed pink leopard-print fabric onto my crutches to make me feel better.
<b>** ""the mine game""</b> It was a game Anna and Casey and I made up, whenever someone said ""mine"" they had to drop and do 10 push-ups immediately--during math class, in the hall at lunch, outside the castle at Disneyland... 
<b>** My stalker</b>. I don't think I'd ever talked to him before, but he knew my whole schedule, bought me a dozen long-stemmed red roses on my birthday, and tried to follow me home from school like 3 times.
<b>** Drivers Ed!!</b> Rosanne and I showed Mr Talley how to flirt with boys at coffee shops to score free stuff. And I sort of fell asleep at the wheel and almost drove off a cliff on Mt Hood.
<b>** Ryan Perry</b> telling me every day that he loved me. until senior year when I finally went out with him and, well, i'm not talking about that anymore.

<h3>JUNIOR YEAR:</h3>
<b>** All-state</b>. Yeah, the hilton...nathan...and that is all.
<b>** the Black Market of Chapter Questions</b>. Usually 90% of our college us history class turned in the exact same assignment.
<b>** College Bio,</b> when I was lying on the table and Chris Moser paid Nick Cannucci a dollar to push me into the garbage can. And going ""to the library"" every day with chris, nick, and casey. AKA going out for lunch and playing tennis.
<b>** Jack!!</b> My friends thought he was the weirdest guy ever, and he was. On our second date he bought me a CD and a necklace and said ""All my past relationships have been like practice tests to me, and you're the final exam."" 
<b>** getting asked to 3 proms.</b> Damn it feels good to be a gangsta.

<h3>SENIOR YEAR:</h3>
<b>** summer!!!</b> Carnegie Hall, the PYP tour, and living on my own in New York City while I took classes at Columbia. And riding in an $80,000 Mercedes with a complete stranger...
<b>** Election 2004.</b> Holy shit, I have never hated so many people in my life. I had heated arguments about gay marriage like daily. And I think I cried when bush won. Ugh...but I'm still vying for OBAMA 2008!!!
<b>** The worst day ever</b>. My mom found my livejournal and learned I had sex, drank, smoked, snuck out, got in a stranger's car in new york, etc. :( :(
<b>** The best day ever</b>. When I was dating Brian and we went to saturday market and NW 23rd and powells and then he took me to my pyp concert and carried my viola and kissed me goodbye even though people were watching. I couldn't stop smiling for like a week afterwards!
<b>** my birthday</b>...thanks for the condoms, girls. haha I still haven't lived that down. actually, heather and rachel and I turned them into water balloons.
<b>** All-St8 & All-NW</b>. Like when Travis tried to jump out of my car while i was driving 20 mph. And Kenny my bff!!! ohhhh myyy daaarrrrlin.... i hunger for yoouuuuuuuur touch... :) And Tricia & i almost got kicked out. hehe good times!!
<b>** my speeding ticket</b>. I should have remembered to look at my ""speed thingy"".
<b>** WHEN I GOT THE FUCK INTO MIT!!!!!!!!!</b> Ok I changed my mind, that was actually the best day of my life.</lj-cut>


And now here are some pictures from the past week. I never bring a camera anywhere, so most of these are just what I bummed off of other people, which is mostly the reason it took me so long to post this. <lj-cut text=""pictures"">

Also my weekend was great. i was supposed to be grounded but i got to see brian friday and sunday night anyway, and fortunately we were at my house instead of his the night liam and alex and dan were planning to break in and surprise us, hahaha.

saturday i spent the day at a dorkestra festival at MHCC with my All-NW partners in crime, trishypoo and arianne!!! we went to starbucks, and played frisbee, and i even met that bass player everybody thought was hot last year. saturday night was casey's party but i couldnt go since i was grounded :(.

"event","i was so bored i decided to watch the news, and the craziest thing happened.

first they showed a picture of this superhot 21-year-old guy named Patrick Kiblets. then the news guy said that Patrick Kiblets died in a drunk driving accident in lake oswego. so i was like ""that sucks. damn drunk drivers.""

then they showed a picture of the drunk driver, who had been arrested for second-degree manslaughter, and i gaped at the tv and yelled ""OH MY GOD"" until my sister came running in to see what was wrong.

the drunk driver, cory noel sause, was the student teacher for my law class.

THAT'S RIGHT, MY LAW CLASS. oh, the irony."

"event","It's your ole' pal Craig here. Back for another session of random rantings and such..or not. Anyhow, so there really hasn't been too much going on. Steph and I are still together. How that girl has put up with me this long and not murdered me..I swear I don't know. Honeslty, she's been like the most amazing thing that's happened to me in a long time. If it wasn't for her,I'd still be lost in the emptiness that was me back then. But anyhow, I'm back at McDonald's...again. It's horrible, but I'm hoping to get a phone call about a job at St. Luke's sometime in the next week or so..keep you fingers crossed. In the meantime, I've been checking newspaper ads and such..we'll see what happens. A couple of weeks ago I ran into Jess Cruz, who I haven't seen in ages. Anyhow, of course she had to bring up the past...and all the painful memories that come with it. Sometimes I wish we could shut the door on out pasts and not have to relive the hurt everytime someone brings it up, but no such luck. And naturally, the only memories she brings up are the ones that hurt the most..thanks Jess. You don't see me bringing up all her ex girlfriends,but anyhow, we talked about getting together sometime and playing since she still plays bass and I feel comfortable enough with my skill on the guitar to actually get together with someone and try and create some music. Right now I'm sitting at mom's house listening to some songs off the new Disturbed album, so far I'm liking it. Mom wanted me to go grocery shopping...right...the trauma from the Fashion Bug excursion combined with my loathing for grocery stores just set off all the warning signals that it wouldn't be in my best interest to go. Anyhow, that's about it for now. Just a hi to all the people I don't talk to as often as I used to. And to those that this applies, I'm sorry for anything I did that I shouldn't have and for all the things I did that I shouldn't have. Lately, I've been thinking about my past and how I've done some really uncool things. Thankfully, I'm not the same person I was then, so I know better now. I just wish there were some way I could make up for those things, so apologizing is the best thing I can do. I'm still amazed how songs seem to relate to how we feel, or what we've been through. So, here's another one. Oh one more thing, check out the prettiness that is my new and improved journal, done and created entirely by yours truly..I'm so proud of me. Normally when it comes to HTML, I'm a blithering idiot, but not this time. This time I have prevailed!!! Mwahahaha


You walk on like a woman in suffering
Won't even bother now to tell me why
You come alone 
Letting all of us savor the moment
Leaving me broken another time
You come on like a bloodstained hurricane
Leave me alone
Let me be this time
You carry on like a holy man pushing redemption
I don't want to mention the reason I know

That I am stricken and can't let you go
When the heart is cold 
There's no hope
And we know
That I am crippled by all that you've done
Into the abyss will I run

You don't know what your power has done to me
I want to know if I'll heal inside
I can't go on 
With a holocaust about to happen
Seeing you laughing another time
You'll never know how your face has haunted me
My very soul has to bleed this time
Another hole in the wall of my inner defenses
Leaving me breathless
The reason I know

That I am stricken and can't let you go
When the heart is cold
There's no hope
And we know
That I am crippled by all that you've done
Into the abyss will I run

Into the abyss will I run

You walk on like a woman in suffering
Won't even bother now to tell me why
You come alone
Letting all of us savor the moment

Leave me alone
Let me be this time
You carry on like a holy man pushing redemption
I don't want to mention

Into the abyss will I run

I can't let you go

Yes I am stricken and can't let you go...

"event","Yeah so it's definitely been like 45 years since I've updated this thing. SO much has happened. I spent a couple of weeks on overnight maintenance at work cleaning floors and bathrooms and shit. It was alright, very peaceful and stress-free. Now I've been promoted to a position where I am in charge of the team that unloads trucks. Definitely not stress-free, but it pays better and if I can pull it off, it'll look good when I want to advance again.

So Steph spent the night last night for the first time. It felt so good to have her be the last face I saw before I fell asleep and the first that I saw in the morning. The only problem is that it definitely has the potential to become habit forming though I'm not too sure that it will happen often.

I've definitely fallen in love with her..there's no denying that..not that I would want to. I promised myself that after Abby and Sarah I was done and that I wouldn't do it again, but, with Steph it just feels so good and I'm happier than I've been in quite a while.

Well not too much else new, I'm off to bed..goodnight all."

Repeating in my head...insecurities
Repeating in my head...dividends

It's not your fault
The well of thought and trust has run dry
Don't be afraid to let go
Don't be afraid to start over when it's over
Let go
Let go of feelings
Let go of compromise
Hollow trunk for shelter
So dark and cold inside
I always seem to find myself alone 
Jaded shell of being
Porous as a stone

Calloused...rigid...empty...because of you

Let go of trusting
Lost thought for family
Let go of living
No more concerns of demise
I never seem to find rhythm for life's harmony
Contorted
Twisted 
Broken
Without a reason

Calloused...rigid...empty...because of you

It's all me
All you are 
Without me
There's nothing else...there's no one
Brainwash all you are
Without me
You're by yourself...there's no one

Hope is out of season
Lost sight no hint of light
Get busy living 
Or get busy dying

Calloused...rigid...empty...because of you

It's all me

Without me
There's nothing else...there's no one
Brainwash all you are

You won't be all that you are without me 
You're nothing
You're no one

Terrified 
Petrified

Nothing you're no one
Do you care because I don't
Nothing you're no one, 
Nobody carse so just go
Nothing you're no one 
By yourself all alone

It's all me

To start the week off, I got the new Mudvayne album, Lost And Found, very very bad ass. I've always loved how some bands can mature and you can really see it in their lyrics and feel it in the music itself.

Tuesday night my Aunt Jean died. She overdosed on some drug, I'm not sure which, but it doesn't really matter. She destroyed herself over the years, fought addiction for most of her life. Now, her battle is over and she can rest peacefully at last. I know I'll be finem I have my friends and more importantly, I have Steph. My mom is the one I worry about, she's been taking it kind of hard. She's one of the strongest women I  know, so I know she'll pull through.

And now on the brighter side of things. Steph and I just keep getting closer and closer. We took things kind of slow at first, but since we've become ""official"", things have moved pretty quickly. I'm not complaining, I haven't been this happy in such a long time, I'm just worried about how she sees it. I don't want things to move too fast and scare her away hehe. She surprised me yesterday by coming by after work while I was asleep. I woke up with her sitting on me, again proving that I can in fact wake up in a good mood. It is possible mwahahahaha.

It's kind of weird thought, when I was with Sarah and I would tell her I love her, I always meant it, but in some way, I never really felt it. But, with Steph, it's not like that. I look in her eyes and tell her I love her, and that is all I can feel. I don't quite know how to describe it.

Well, I'm off to call her now. Take care kiddies."

But all it takes is being thrown back into some all-too-familiar situation and all those old, disgustingly familiar feelings come back to haunt me. And I can't stop them...God, how I wish I could. Just lock them away in some forgotten dungeon and let them collect mold and such.

I mean...I'm happy..genuinely happy. Happier than I've been in a long time. But, how do I blind myself to things I don't want to see, things I don't want to know about? If any of you know how, please tell me. I used to be able to hide any feeling of any type, at any given point in time, but lately I haven't been able to. I've just been opening my mouth or cracking my knuckles and letting it all out. Maybe it's better that way. I don't know..."

Shadows Fall was alright, Slipknot played a love song..I give up on them..but Lamb Of God was kick-ass from the second they go on stage. I ended up going with Kyle and his friend Mark who's a pretty cool kid. We all share the same sense of humor so the car ride there and back was interesting, as you might imagine. Anyhow, if any of you are into some sick fucking metal, pick up Ashes Of The Wake by Lamb Of God...if you haven't already.

Alright so here comes the fun part. Stephanie tried to bribe me into going to the Warped Tour by telling me Atreyu was going. Silly Steph..she didn't have to bribe me. Anyhow, for shits and giggles, Kyle looked up the line-up for the Warped Tour and we found Avenged Sevenfold and Bleeding Through as well..so it ought to be fun. But, I told her I'd go if she went with me to Ozzfest since I am so going (IN FLAMES BABY!!!), so now I'll spend a day listening to her music and she can spend a day listening to mine mwahahahaha."

BOTTLED

I really don't have anything to say
Just pass me by
Don't ask me the same questions
Just deny I'm there

Like the time around me
This room is filled with nothing
Feel awkward in a place with many
Leave this space to me

I channel the pain through this
The paper, the pen, your eyes
Stare into what's next..it frightens me
No control..no reward
I'm in circles again

Still and breathless
I don't care what's behind
To you I look for energy
To catch my breath again

The world looks old to me
Tonight I drink myself sober
Soon this could be over
Take a picture of the pale

I channel the pain through this
The paper, the pen, your eyes
Stare into what's next..it frightens me
No control..no reward
I'm in circles again

New morning knocking
Feels just like always
Pen down my regrets
I reach to you again..."

I've had so many thought flooding my mind lately. I don't know what they mean or what to do about them. Why does it seem as though I'm not meant to have the things I truly want, when so many others seem so happy? I've done my time, my part. What the fuck do they want from me? Heh..whoever THEY are. Actually, I'm glad everyone is so happy and content with their lives and current situations, some of them actually deserve it...unlike me..or so it appears.

"event","Right, so I know I haven't updated this thing in a while, but today's been a rather eventful day.

I'm sitting around playing Fable on XBox, when there's a knock on the door. I get up and open it, and it's Diane (building superintendent) and Lisa (one of the lesbians next door). I say hello and they proceed to ask me if I would like a cat. Now mind you, Diane had already told me that pets weren't allowed. When I mentioned that to her, she said...and I quote...""I'm not even standing here right now.""

Anywho, apparently this cat has been living outside and they've been feeding him all along. He belongs to some people that live a street over, but now he seems to have injured his neck somehow and the owners want nothing to do with him. He's a full grown adult cat, good weight, in good shape, so I know he isn't some random stray. But since they want nothing to do with the little fella, Diane and Lisa asked me to take him in. With the cold, the snow, and the wound on his neck...HOW COULD I SAY NO?!?!?!

So, now I'd like you all to join me in welcoming Cole..(my choice for the name)..into my little corner of madness I call my world. It's going to take some adjusting for the two of us, but he seems to be pretty comfy right now. I'm glad they asked me, since I've wanted a cat since I moved in here. Some of the women that live here have hooked me up with a litter box, a carrier for when I bring him to the vet tomorrow to be checked out, food, dishes, toys, catnip, and money toward the vet bill. So here's to being a pseudo-family with me and Cole..hehehehe."

I lost you
You were my god 
Thought what do I do now
You were never there for me 
Never there to carry me
Twenty-five years looking back that time is gone 
It was you I believed in
Look what you've done to me 
Realize what you've done to me

I can't see going on 
In this darkness I'm blind 
Beneath my cradle the bough has broke
I exorcise my loss 
Your lie 
The punishment

It takes time 
To try to mend the wounds of all the suffering
What do I do now?
All I'm asking from you

I'll get by myself

A piece of shit like you
Look at me now 
You left me so fuck you

Everybody leaves me
Everybody's gone
Watch my father leave me
There's nobody left
Feels like I've never been loved
Everybody leaves me
Never gave a shit about me
Everybody's gone
I'll rot in my head alone

I don't give a fuck about you
Go the fuck away 

Fake being
Inside of my heart you are the liar
Innocence displaced
Been left

Here I stand now and I'm alone
With no one to comfort me
One set of footprints in the sand
No one to take my hand 
I'll walk through as long as I need
I'll drift through my life though I'm alone
Outgrown the cradle that once housed me
And I've found that all I need is me

Found I've never needed you to push through
All the shit that stacks up inside of my life
Endless plight that circulates through my body
I'll keep stumbling, beating, pummeling
Teething on the rind and renounce my being

I can't see going on.

I can't see
I'm so tired
Of trying to mend the wounds of all my suffering

If time heals all wounds
Then why am I still bleeding
I thought for sure by now
That I could stand on my own
But the ticking minutes bearing down on me
Bend me at the knee
And now it's the other side of three am
And there's no laughter 
On the other end of the phone
It's the other end of the candle
And I've burnt my fingers for the last time
If I could take those minutes
Spin them back for a bit
Watch everything come back
Knowing that I would only lose it again
You can't change the past
What's done is done
But you can learn from it 
You can learn and try not to make the same mistakes
Or like me
You can sit here..oh look three thirty five
And hope that those minutes will wind themselves back
And I can try again, only this time...
I'll do it right..."

Gutted like a pig
All you want is the world to bleed
Someone somewhere stole your desire 
The pain akin 
To being punched in the throat
And stabbed in the chest 

You would rather bleed 
Than be without her 
Gone are the tender whispers dancing in your ears 
Replaced with lackluster memories you cry
Your screams play in your empty room 

It's so hard to see when your eyes are rolling 
In the back of your head 
It's even harder to speak when everything you say 
Just comes out wrong 

Your bed swallows you whole 
As the days bleed together
Torment on the lips 
Of a loved one
And if you try hard enough
You can almost taste her
Feel her pass and you scream
OH GOD WHY ME!! 

You would rather bleed 
Than be without her 
Gone are the tender whispers dancing in your ears 
Replaced with lackluster memories you cry

In the back of your head 
It's even harder to speak when everything you say 
Just comes out wrong

Yeah, they'll be others once I think hard enough. But that's one. If anyone's ever had their heart truly shattered, that's pretty much how it feels. Take care my lovelies."

I wish that you would just leave
'Cause your presence still lingers here

When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears

But you still have
All of me

Why?
Sometimes this beauty is choking me
But at least it's your hands on my throat
Your lashes brush against my cheek
Coupled with your breath on my neck
The world around you falls away
And I will still be there
I know my words are like daggers
But they cut me too
Oh...and I'm sorry for all the fucked up this I said
I didn't mean it
And I never realized that I can be what I hate
Let's be happy with what we have
Enjoy the beauty in these days
Sometimes we'll laugh
Sometimes we'll scream
No one said caring was easy
I know there were times 
When emotions felt like pulling teeth
Sometimes I felt so soulless
I couldn't even look at me
It's pathetic to hate who you are
And it feels like hell to change
But I'll be damned if I push you away
I remember when my dreams were dying
And I damned, I damned the sun to pieces
I carved hateful thoughts into my chest
And then you took my hand
And nothing felt the same.


So yeah, I'm getting a cell phone tomorrow...yayness. Contact with the outside world is a beautiful thing. Perhaps now I won't have to do only work and sleep...maybe now the Shady Donkey gets to have a life. And yes Amanda, I will call you don't worry, you are the COOLEST!!!"

So there is minimal happiness for a fleeting moment. I don't want to alarm anyone, which is probably the reason for my semi-seclusion.

No matter how hard I tell myself that I don't belong there anymore, I still want to be the one to carry her when she's feeling weak. Ah well...I guess such is my lot in life.

We were one in words
You finished my sentence

It pushes me aside

Your presence kept me floating
Far from depths where secrets lie
Maybe in another lifetime

Held my breath

Am I depressed? Maybe slightly, but nothing to concern myself or any to concern themselves over. I just can't believe I've let myself slip into this mode of always being down. WHAT HAPPENED TO ME?!?!

""Nothing was supposed to hurt like this.""

This pain, constantly gnawing at the very core of me. I don't know when it started, or how it started for that matter, but it's there. And I swear, I felt it moving in the entertainment center and bedroom set, so I think it's pretty much here to stay.

""I am the one who chose my path.""

The decisions I've made have led me down a road that I swore I would never walk again. I've let the anger take control again. For the second time in my life, I'm slowly becoming content with not being as nice as I once was.

And here's a final thought for all of you, my little cud-chewers:

I used to be golden
A savior in time of sorrow
But then the turning came
And I kissed the sun goodbye
Don't you get it?
It's always darker in my eyes
The screams of my brothers egging me on"

If that wasn't love 
Then what the fuck was I thinking?
I would bear my soul 
Just to bask in your grace and your beauty

In this perfection 
I lament her beauty
Her voice a sour note 
In this bitter serenade

Your strength inspires all of my days
I would carry any load

And your strength is my backbone
When I feel every bone break

How could I know one kiss

Constructed my desire
Perfected my hatred
Now I'm driven to be

And burned bridges down
That lead back to people like you
So full of malice
So full of scorn
You tried your best to crush my spirit
You tried to steal my soul
You pushed my back against the wall

I will not be broken, I am the one

Makeup smeared in her eyes. 
Each sob's a reason to say goodbye.
Sometimes when you're holding on, you'll never see the light.

Gazed upon dead lovers eyes. 
She never looked so good,

These days are closing in
The end has become apparent
We're only here for so long
Will anyone remember my name
When time has washed away the dust of our ashes?
When my head rests in a velvet lined casket?

What's out there?
What is my eternal fate?
It only just recently hit me
That this life is just a state
Mortality fading
Like the innocence of love
I'm scared to death of what's to become

Of my immortal soul 
Of this eternal flame
Will you remember?
Will your heart sing with pain?

Who calls out my name?
Who can tell me what happens
When my eyes close for the last time?
Does it all simply end 
In a blanket of darkness?
What of my soul, what of my soul?

All those things you couldn't say
You should have said
All those I love you's lost
Weighed more like lead on your chest

My immortal soul 
Of this eternal flame
Will you remember?
Will your heart sing with pain?

Who calls out my name?
Who can tell me what happens
When my eyes close for the last time?
Does it all simply end 
In a blanket of darkness?
What of my soul, what of my soul?

What if I could take back all those misspent days?
Every second of anger, I would wash my sins away

There..much better. 

So anyhow, Dereka's been talking to her father and he wants me to go back to work for him. If I do, two things will happen:

1) I will have to leave Wal-Mart. I like it there. I'm getting along with the people I work with and I've made some good friends there.

2) In order to work with Dennis again, I'll have to move back to Kentucky, since, well...that's where he lives.

As I've said before it feels like there isn't anything left for me here. Maybe another start is just what I need.
Dereka has already offered to let me stay there with her and her family until I can get a place of my own.

On the other hand, leaving here means I'll have to leave behind a lot of people that I'd rather not walk away from.
I've done too much walking away...it's starting to eat away at me.

I'm gonna be 25 in a month...ho-ly shit!! That's about how I feel about it..hehehehe. I'm supposed to be hanging out with Lisa at some point in time..if both of us ever have the same night off, though it doesn't seem like that ever happens.

Then this afternoon, after I woke up, I got a phone call around 3:00. It was Danielle again. We went out for dinner at Pizza Slut..stuffed crustedy goodness. We went back to my place and Kyle came by for a little while. We took turns jamming on the guitar, as we often do, and he eventually went back home. Now Danielle and I are sitting in the comp. lab of UMass and here I am typing. 

I don't know what to do about my current situation at home. I'm comfortable there, but it's starting to feel like there's nothing here for me anymore. I don't know what to do with myself half the time. I work and work and work, but that only prolongs the lost feeling for so long. Then I come home in the morning, shower, and sleep....same routine everyday. It seems that routine behavior is the only thing that comforts me now. 

I'm thinking I should just spend my life alone, that way things won't turn out the way they have, whether it be by my doing or not. Then I won't have to worry about balancing my friends and my loved ones. It'll just be me doing things the way I want to. Being good to my friends, hanging out and just having a good time. 

The only problem is, that is only good for so long. Eventually I need to have that closeness. Someone to hold and feel like everything is going to be okay. There's a great line in a Killswitch Engage song called ""Rose Of Sharyn"" that goes, ""What would I give to be home? That smile..the face of love."" In the end, isn't that what life is all about, forever searching for that one that you can come home to everyday and just know that everything is okay. Some of us find it, and some of us don't.

I'm through crying out for help now, I know I've said it before, but this time...I'm done. I'm not going to get through this with anyone but myself. I know that now. Yeah me and Sarah had our ups and downs, but still I'm entitled to miss her to some extent...aren't I?

It really doesn't matter because now she's with Adam..and no matter what, if I get any wind that he's hurting her in the same ways again..his blood will be on my hands..I swear this on my father's soul.

Speaking of dear old Dad, I got a call from my brother Kyle this morning. Apparently, a girl called our aunt this morning claiming that she could potentially be our father's daughter. So, once again, it appears I may have another sibling that I didn't know about. She'll be coming by here in about three hours. She's already expressed interest in a blood test, and I've agreed to do it. It's either me or Kyle and he's terrified of needles. I'm doing this for two reasons. One: This girl could be my sister and her seven year old son could be my nephew. Two: Whether she is or isn't, this girl deserves and has the right to know. So if I have to get some of my blood taken away to give all of us some closure on this...so be it."

For some reason, it always seems to feel better when the person on the other end is doing better, even if it means they're spending more time with someone that is a potential harm to them. But don't worry Craig, you're not supposed to. It isn't right of you to worry about any one person in particular, everytime you do people just pass it off as you being your usual self. And I can't help but wonder how when a relationship goes bad, one person can move on so easily when they supposedly ""loved"" the other. Ah well...just another of those question that has plagued mankind since the dawn of time. I can't write anymore..no more songs..no more poems..the thought of picking up a pencil and paper seems to cripple me with fear everytime. My only comfort is my guitar, my pack of butts, and the thought that at any given point in time, there is always a box cutter at my disposal. The scary part is, I've felt like this for quite some time now. The thought of cutting has always been there, I've just been too busy trying to be strong for everyone else, that I haven't entertained that particular thought. But now, I only have to be strong for myself. I can't cry out for help..it'll only go unanswered. Thus is the shithole I have condemned myself too. 

But I will continue to cry out for help, maybe someone out there will know what it takes to get me on the road I was on back then..back when everything seemed to fit like a movie..when Sprite and Shock Tarts were all it took to make someone smile..where are you Meeyan?

Those are the thoughts that have been on my mind the past couple of days. Why is it I always seem to come back to the memories of those days..of footballs and Willow? Is it some kind of message that I'm supposed to piece together? But weren't those days long gone? 

Christ, I'm so lost...."

On top of that, she stole my guitar and my amp..AND ACTUALLY THOUGHT SHE'D GET AWAY WITH IT!!!!. Anyhow, I told my friend Dan about it, he got all pissed and aimed his car toward Fall River. I knocked on her door, she came downstairs and...well she was either going to give me my stuff or face the police...plain and simple. I'm tired of people trying to get the better of me, and me having to see the look of utter and total defeat when I one-up them. Anyhow..if anyone wants to talk, leave a comment, or find me on AIM.

"event","I miss my father. I don't know why, but it gets stronger and stronger each day. I wonder about how different my life would be today if he hadn't died all those years ago. But in the same breath, I think about how I wouldn't have met the people I have, and I wouldn't be the same Craig that we all know and love. Here's a little song that, for some reason, picks me up when I think of him.

Give me your hand
Blood is spilled and men will follow
Infernal man
Punishment too great to bear

Raise you head
And taste the courage
Fall from grace
Unholy night

I've come here to kill you
Won't leave until you've died
Murder born of vengeance
I close my brother's eyes
Tonight

Give me your hand
Blood is spilled and men will follow
Infernal man
Punishment too great to bear

Raise you head
And taste the courage
Fall from grace
Unholy night

I've come here to kill you
Won't leave until you've died
Murder born of vengeance
I close my brother's eyes
Tonight

Its cold tonight as the clouds turn grey
And from my hands to my brothers grave
You took his side 
You took his gift
Feel the power of a fallen man 
Crestfallen man...

Far away in this land I must go
Out of the sight of the One
A punishment sent from his hand
A hardship no one should know
Now go out of the sight of the One
Away in this land you must go

Where has he gone? 
What have you done?
A voice commands from high above this earth
From the soil his blood cries out to me
Murder, liar, vengeance, deceit

Far away in this land I must go
Out of the sight of the one
A punishment sent from his hand
A hardship that no one should know
Now go out of the sight of the one"

I'm 24 and I've accomplished maybe 5% of what I wanted to by now. So much for making the right choices. I heard this song that for a while made me think of someone in my life..when all along it truly defines how I feel about myself..so yeah in the end it is about someone in my life.

So feast my little pig droppings...

Why can't you ever back down?
Why can't you just shut your face?
Oh God the feelings I feel
Would get me thrown in a cage

You're the one that's always screaming at me
I'm the one that keeps your life so carefree
What the fuck more do you want me to be?
Why must you do this to me?

Run away
I can't stay
Lead the way
Make them pay

Counting on me
Always hoping I'll be
There for all of you problems
In turn, you're never there for me
You suck the life out of me
You hate everything you see
I can't take this anymore
I always stay when I should leave

You see the pain in my face
While you keep putting me down
Inside the rage starts to build
You push me I won't go down

You're the one that's always screaming at me
I'm the one that keeps your life so carefree
What the fuck more do you want me to be?

You suck the life out of me
You hate everything you see
I can't take this anymore
I always stay when I should leave

Could it really be the day, today? 
Does this really make the problems go away? 
I'm going to hurt just not this time

RIGHT NOW!!
I've taken all I can now
RIGHT NOW!!
You've torn us all apart
RIGHT NOW!!
There's nothing you can do to stop me
RIGHT NOW!!

Counting on me
Always hoping I'll be

Come back to me, this is unconceivable
Breaking apart the ones you love
Hate runs deep for what you've done to us
Left alone through suicide...suicide

I just want to die
Take away my life
Lay by your side
Please

Look at my face you pierce with a blank stare
No dream could prepare a heart for a lifeless friend.
He's gone. Nothing will take back time.
I need him back, but nothing will take back time.

I can see just fine with you in my life
There by my side as it starts to fade
I know this can't be right 
Stuck in a dream
A nightmare full of sorrow
Nightmare full of pain

I look back and see the twisted road
Best friends and despair took its toll
Take away

You can't be replaced
I'm left alone with you
In spirit and the words
You wrote to me

Sorrow, sank deep inside my blood
All the ones around me I cared for
And most of all I loved
But I can't see myself that way
Please don't forget me
Or cry while I'm away"

Don't mourn for me, you're not the one to place the blame
As bottles called my name, I won't see you tonight

So far away, I'm gone. Please don't follow me tonight.
And while I'm gone, everything will be alright.

"event","And here we are again. Spinning complacently in the darkness, as I so often put it. It's amazing how ineptitude and apparent lack of sufficency can hinder your entire life. I'm an empty shell of what I once was. And it's due solely to the one thing that has always been a constant in my inevitable downfall...McDonald's. It's gotten to the point where walking into that building makes me want to physically vomit. I avoid it whenever possible..to think, at one point I actually enjoyed going there. And yet I'm trapped there, nobody else will give me a chance. I'll never find another job...bwah. And so, I push myself..on and on, hoping one day something will get me out of that depressing shit-hole. 

I can't keep her happy....just one more thing to add onto the pile of fuck-ups in my life. She wants to leave, I can see it in her eyes and hear it in her voice. Not leave me...but leave New Bedford...but I can't...not until I'm out of that fucking place. But something tells me she's going to go back home..and I'll be alone again. Once again, only seeing her on weekends...boy this looks like a familiar road. Maybe that's what is intended for me..miserable weeks..content weekends. I wanted so much more for myself..and those around.

I'm sorry I've let you all down....
Please forgive me...

There's a game life plays
Makes you think you're everything 
They ever said you were
I'd like to take some time
Clear away everything I've planned

Was it life I betrayed
For the shape that I'm in?
It's not hard to fail
It's not easy to win
Did I drink too much?
Can I disappear?
And there's nothing that's left but wasted years
There's nothing left but wasted years...

If I could change my life
Be a simple kind of man
Try to do the best I can
If I could take the time
I'd derail every path I could
And I'm about to die
Won't you clear a way for me?
Give me strength to fly away

Was it life I betrayed
For the shape that I'm in?
It's not hard to fail
It's not easy to win

There's nothing left but wasted years...
Oh those wasted years..."

SNOWBLIND

Powder covers all I see
Blankets of white threaten to slowly choke the world
I close my eyes
Hoping to blind myself from the melted torrent
It overwhelms
It saturates 
Flooding and drowning ALL!!

Now is the winter of my pain
Now is the winter of my shame
Snowblind to what I've become
Snowblind to what you've done
DONE TO ME!!

Hail conquers all there is
Beats the silence into a frail submissiveness
I've sewn my ears
Deaf to the cries of the snowbound masses
I am gone
There's nothing here
Shoveled under snow and LIME!!

There isn't enough time to regale you all with what's been going on so as always, I'll just throw in some lyrics to express how I'm feeling about my current position in life.

Live in my head for just one day
I see myself and look away
The road is showing now on my face
Soon I'll disappear with..
I'll disappear without a fucking trace

Faces that I've seen turn old and gray
I've lost too many friends along the way
Memories I never thought would fade
They fade and blow away

I wish that I could disappear
Unzip my skin and leave it here
So I could be no one again
And never let nobody
I'd let nobody in

Faces that I've seen turn old and gray
I've lost too many friends along the way
Memories I never thought would fade
The fade and blow away

So now the walls are closing in
Because in life you sink or swim
Sometimes these shoes don't feel right in my head
Feel like a book that can't be
A book that can't be read

Faces that I've seen turn old and gray
I've lost too many friends along the way
Memories I've never thought would fade
The fade and blow away
-""Fade"" by Staind
--------------------------------------------------------

I woke up today
Didn't feel like I had slept at all
Just another restless night
Such a reckless life
I wish that I could take it slow
Live it simple day by day
But theres always something new
SOMETHING IN THE WAY

I'd like to change the hands of time
Start over 
Someone hit rewind
Break ground and build a new design
Start over 
Leave this all behind

Thumbing through the paper
It's the same old black and white
One man gets to live
And a dozen have to die
The reality that we create
We cross the lines we love to hate
Something we see everyday
BUT WE ALWAYS CHOOSE TO LOOK AWAY

I'd like to change the hands of time
Start over 
Someone hit rewind
Break ground and build a new design
Start over 
Leave this all behind

The times have changed
But we're still the same
The cycle just repeats itself
It goes on and on

Creeping down the boulevard
Among the walking dead
They're numb to nearly everything
ACCCEPTING WHAT THEY'RE FED

I'd like to change the hands of time
Start over 
Someone hit rewind
Break ground and build a new design
Start over 
Leave this all behind

The times have changed
But were still the same
The cycle just repeats itself
It goes on and on
-""New Design"" by Motograter
--------------------------------------------------------

So you think the area's gray 
But it continues each day 
A bad example of the attitude you portray 
And try try though you might might
You should be burdened with strife 
Can't find a single reason
I could live with you in my life
So i continue to pray hope  
And hope that you'll go away 
A bad addiction to a home wrecking thing who plays 

With my heart and that's the bottom line 
I feel so empty 

Chorus:
WHAT CAN YOU GIVE I CAN'T GET MYSELF 
That's right
And what part of my life can you fix
I can't fix my damn self 

Oh god I'm losing patience each day 
I've put myself in harm's way 
Can't seem to justify none of the shit you say 
Can't find another way out 
There's nothing left but pure doubt 
I'm on the verge of pulling all my hair straight out 
So if you listen to me 
Not to the powers that be 
We're not supposed to be together 
Can't you see 

Indecision is the bottom line 
I feel so empty now 

[Chorus]

I'm gonna show you now 
That's right you're getting out 
I've said it many times but this time 
I have figured out 
Just how i'm moving on 
It's taken way too long 
Inside I know i'll feel much better 
When you're really gone 

[Chorus]
-""Reliance"" by Flaw
--------------------------------------------------------

There must be something you can recommend
I've lost my faith in man again
So sick of trying to pretend
Same pain over and over again
How much longer do you think we'll stand
So little left here to live for
By the time my life is at it's end
I'll want it back

Chorus:
One more time
Let me try one more time
Live my life one more time

We never seem ready for this...
We never seem ready for this...

It keeps on..it keeps on...

It keeps on haunting me day after day
Am I going about the right way?
Which truths to pass and with which truths to stay
It's all so hard...I'm just so afraid
Had about as much as I can take
So little left here to live for
By the time my life is at it's end
I'll want it back

(Chorus)

I need a chance to live my life one more time
Give me a chance to live my life one more time
I want a chance to live my life one more time
Give me a chance to live just one more time...

It's not your fault. I can't even say it's my fault. These seeds were planted long before you and I...long before I even found the light that I see when I catch you looking at me when I'm not expecting it. I am the product of a negligent society. A ""God"" that took people from me long before they should have gone.

Leaving me with this fear of abandonment....

Horror
Is the pain that I feel
Are you inside of me?
OR DO I REFLECT YOU?
Am I a copy?
A clone?
Or am I my own person?
I'M NOT LIKE YOU

Since you took your life, mine has not been whole

So there I stood, a scolded child
The reasons never questioned, my pain's been filed
Inside this place that makes me feel
I learned life is unfair and that is very real

Then you came right in, tearing out my soul
How could all this loss, be your only goal
I'm left standing here, desperate in the cold
Since you took your life, mine has not been whole

While you try to overcome the lesson
Making most of those questions that just
Keeps me guessing
I'm looking longer, harder, further than I ever have
Solitude is breaking me down, you always seemed glad
To put me down and stick me in that little pit
Personal growth as a child that mattered not a bit
Then I became the person that you hated most
Disrespecting the father, son and holy ghost
A small example of what the things you've done to me
Have changed in my life and changed the things
I'll never be
I'll never be

Then you came right in, tearing out my soul
How could all this loss, be your only goal
I'm left standing here, desperate in the cold
Since you took your life, mine has not been whole

I went to sleep for two-three hours because of a headache I got in fourth hour today at school when Luis punched my in the jaw four times (""on accident""). I was surprised I didn't do anything about it; we're accquaintances who don't talk to each other, we just play, and that happened to be the game of the day. Pow. Anyways, as I was sleeping, it started raining. I was sweaty and hot when I looked around and saw people screaming to get the furniture out of the rain, and saw it was my sister, Hanna, and Mom, frantically running outside with gusts of wind and rain and thunder, and instantly I had a strong sense of responsibility. I lay my head down again and watched. Hehehe. Now it's just cloudy, but it's nice. I always like cloudy. Why does it never rain while school's on? I love school rain."

Camcorder, couple t-shirts and some pants, <em>am</em> going to Poland (it would cost more to not go), and I haven't checked my grades, and I am comfortable with the fact that I have no idea how terrible they are because then I can always deny it somehow. My primary target is English, which, by Friday, I hope to have that stupid essay done that I just neglected after getting all the sources I needed way too late, as well as major studying of some new words, and work on the Finals project we're getting for that class (something on To Kill a Mockingbird). Next year, no H/IB clases; just an advanced math class in Algebra 3-4. I hope I get the same English teacherso that I could do my math in there. See her reaction. Or not. Whatever. Next year will be different. Also, I got a job. Sorta. That trip to Daniel's house yesterday to hand some shirts Bruno ordered from my mom over resulted in the discovery of Daniel's reading <em>Mein Kampf</em>, his new X-box 360, and a one-day job at 7:00 am Saturday morning to whenever the hell. I'm CASHING that bitch. If I bank it, my dear sweet parents get to tell me when I can and when I can't use it. I'm estimating around a $40-$55 paycheck. Over the summer (I will return from Poland by June 16) I might work for Bruno again, three days a week (or more, depending on urgency), and will make something like $120-$220 in a week (although the highest paycheck I've gotten in a week with Bruno, and for very little work, was $196 after taking away money from our lunch breaks). Don't let it fool you. I'm not rich. I get nothing I want, and when I try to make fun with something that isn't mine (camcorder) I get in some deep shit somehow. Lonely, lonely life. Meh. After this summer stuff, I'll try for a job at Target near 7th st and Bell, and if that fails, Starbucks (or Belfiore, whatever pays more, although it'd be cooler to work at Belfiore). After I get a first paycheck I'll decide on what percentage goes to savings (I was thinking ten of fifteen percent, since right now I'm still really a kid, and I won't have the freedom to spend money on what I want later--I'll have rent and billing responsibilities). Ah... Plans. They never work out, but I like to make them anyway. Goodnight"

"event","&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  <u>Heh. What a</u> boring and uninteresting day that was. I stayed home until late 3rd period 'cause in English I had a first draft due for a book I got just last night. It was Catch-22 by Joseph Heller, and I happened to give my copy as a birthday present 'cause I thought I'd be done with it. (But I found out I wasn't, and for two weeks I constantly reminded Hanna, my dear sweet sister, to bring it to me, but Ben brought it for me last night after his job interview.) This gave me very little time to do anything at all, and I was forced to use it as an excuse to skip some o' school. I would have actually found a way to stay home all day today, but I wanted to 'cause that's the only place I've got any real friends (and most of which aren't real friends, but just accquaintances). Things have been looking up lately. I reasoned that, since sadness is a lower state of emotion than the state you are usually in, and since my emotional state is sad by default, I wasn't actually sad, I was just being the way I always am. Which is also depressing 'cause it makes me think of what I'd be like when I'm ""actually"" sad. My parents love me, and they decided to purchase a weapon to replace the Unmentionable Whore I ironically mentioned earlier. Dad's gonna pay most of it 'cause he doesn't do shit for this family anymore, and never did beforehand. It's funny how he seems so full of knowledge and yet he's done nothing smart and everything stupid. We didn't ask him to make breakfast, or ask him to invent a better way to get people to vote in elections; we asked him to be a dad, and he fucked it up, and he still fucks it up, and I feel bad enough for him to be a son. ...Though not the one he wants. I assume he'll pay for most of it because he knows all of this and because he knows I know all of this, but then all I've written here is that I dislike my dad and that I'm pumping something out of his wallet shamelessly. Other events such as Mom getting sick and Hanna holding a yard sale tomorrow lead me to believe that Saturday will n ot only be melancholy and boring, but also exciting and a better chance to find something to do with absolutely nothing.

My life is as melancholy as any other's, and sometimes more. I'm never happy. I <em>am</em> a liar, in truth--I smile for the occasion, and I act for the occasion, but only appropriately so.

I sure didn't, but I still feel obligated to share minimal details about my life with someone (""no one""). Basically (or rather, ""that's exactly it"") I just saw two movies this weekend; Scary Movie 4 with Daniel and a cool guy named T.J., as well as Mike at AMC 30 in Deer Valley 'round 9:45pm. We bought tickets for the 9:15, but we found out it was in a shit theater and that just thirty minutes later they would be playing it in one of the bigger Colossus screens. Notable part of that film is thye Million Dollar Baby skit. The next day I saw Thank You for Smoking with my sister, Hanna, and Ben, and then Mike and his mom decided to join in for some reason at AMC 18 at Desert Ridge. Notable part is... any part where the characters talk. Heh. And then Easter was just a quasi-social event. Not much there, y'know? Just... eat and talk.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  <u>All right, now,</u> my life isn't all that static, but then I have one argument that I'm very sure is good; I'd get out more if I had a cell phone. Not that I need one, it's just way more convenient for me to keep in touch with my friends with, but alas, no phone for moi. To me, I can come home from school, watch TV, go to sleep, check my e-mails and doodle, read, the occasional walk-and-hang-out-by-myself,-thinking, and playing this and that on the computer. If I'm lucky, I can get out of the house with some pals or go grocery shopping with Mom (although it's not exactly the portrait of ""fun stuff to do,"" it's still fun to load up the cart with fives stacks of energy drink packages when she's not looking over at CostCo)(interesting fact: I live inside of CostCo). As for the walk thing, it's usually at night, just because it's so quiet and the darkness (even though the bridge is lit up in three places)(they fixed a streetlamp next to it; I wanna break it now 'cause I hate that much light in a place where I feel like... feeling... stuff) is so nice. The bridge is at 20th St. and Greenway Pkwy.

I like to pace it and, while doing that, trace my hands along the dusty old rings that make up the sides of the bridge. Watch the sun set from there, leaning over the side and seeing how fast time goes by around me. I doubt someone else does anything like that over there. You (""someone"" (""no one"")) might look at this and think there's nothing special about it. Well there isn't. It's just my place to go when I need a moment, or an hour, or a good part of the night."

Instead, I read news articles and then played a game for a while, but that got boring, and by then it was 3:50-ish am. Today we were tested in Mathematics and English with a booklet that replaced the SAT (standard achievement test), the Terra Nova. It was totally boring and monotonous, reading, reading, and answering five questions or fewer about a passage, combining sentences and choosing the correct form of a sentence by looking at the tense of the verb. The math was easy. What I didn't ge<img src=""http://img51.imageshack.us/my.php?image=kjwpsfm9s1hu.jpg"" alt="""" />t I knew anyway, so I could give a great guess. Sad that that's our standard. They dumbed it down more this year. After four hours of sitting in a classroom, we got to get up and walk around for lunch, and then start classes again at nineteen minutes each. Yay.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  <u>I gotta say</u> the only interesting class was Art, sixth period, because everyone in all the other classes were pretty bummed out for whatever reason. It's not like it was hard for anyone (except those who don't speak English at least demi-fluently). The only thing that bothered me, besides the lack of sleep (to the point where I had to keep blinking because of my blurry vision during the testing), was that some dumbasses just sat around and threw paper airplanes instead of even looking at the test, and not even bubbling answers in to get some right. There's lazy and there's stupid. At least now I know the AIMS next year will be way easier.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  <u>After school I</u> spoke with Daniel. We discussed some stuff (as uninspiring as airsoft is to some people, it's just a darn hobby that we're obsessed with for the moment) and also eventually a replacement gun in case Daniel's should break. I offered my beretta to him for spare parts should his break (assuming he'd buy the same make). He said he'd take my magazine and that would put us even with the $32.50 I owe him, and then he'd buy the thigh holster for $20 (although I think I'll just give it to him or get $15 instead. I'm too nice a guy). The beretta he's getting is silver except for the plates on the grip.<br />http://img51.imageshack.us/my.php?image=kjwpsfm9s1hu.jpg<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; <u>He's still deciding,</u> but I told him a black barrel would look nice with it (the guns from KJ come with a plastic orange barrel--ugly), and I called JungleToy to see if they had both the gun, any package deals, and the barrels. They had all. Dan wants to go on Thursday or Friday after his eBay auction sells so he'd have a little more money to buy some extras with the pistol (when he rewards himself, he rewards well). Lucky guy, Daniel is. He's got a job with his dad on weekends; about fifty to a hundred (rarely) bucks a week, almost, unless Bruno's really needing some help that day. Later after that I slept until 9:00-ish pm and just hung around after a snack until now. Been writing for twenty minutes now and I need to put up that beretta pic that (since now you're reading it... in THE FUTURE) you saw earlier. Fuck it, actually. I'll just post the link 'cause the image shit isn't working. Anyways, time for sleep."

So a very good deal. The brand was, in full, KJ Works M92 All-Metal Airsoft Beretta, Super Real Gun Series (Asians and their super products). Betty was a very good pistol; one of the best in the world of airsoft M92 replicas, until... until today. I called JungleToy today to check on Betty, my airsoft beretta, and the man on the other line told me, ""it's unfixable."" My immediate thoughts flickered and I laughed my ass off. The guy, Paul, seemed kinda worried, but I said it was fine. That bitch finally popped her cherry. Goddamned whore. And I'm truly happy. Dramatically so. The money spent on airsoft was spent so long ago that it's almost nothing to me now, except a memory of trading a few pieces of paper for the greatest damage-inflicting piece of joy I'd ever had the honor of firing into my friends faces. My only hope now is saving up for a new beretta, or, more than likely, a more powerful electric airsoft rifle, perhaps the same one Daniel has (AK-47). There's a picture of&nbsp;his ""baby""&nbsp;on his MySpace (<a href=""mailto:BSaDK3000@Cox.net"">BSaDK3000@Cox.net</a>).

Like an M96 with comfortable pistol grip. That's estimated at... eight months from now? The AK-47 (or other), a month from now. Wish me luck. I wish you guys luck at whatever there is to wish you luck for.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Also, as another</u> announcement, I never got that bow done.

I planned doing this before, I'm sure, but I thought someone whipping out a bottle full of cold coffee in the middle of the day was not only funny as not sleeping most of the night, but also trouble if the bottle did what it was designed to do in a sort of ferninst manner and exploded in my backpack. I also gotta dress up and brush my teeth, eat something (or else the caffeine will make my stomache crawl up to my throat), and kick everything on the floor into my closet so some guy can come in here and measure the window for replacement without any of the trouble of seeing that a teenage boy lives here. So off I go."

That sums up all this Spring Break week for me. I'd say it more drained my life juice than pumped it up, but that's just because I'm... me. I'm conteneted with the idea of coming home every day now and cleaning this shithouse up because there's nothing more I can do in life for now. Who knows. When the summer comes, life will be interesting. When summer ends, life will be a steady stream of oxymoronic teachers and, hopefully, a working school locker. I'll apply at Belfiore when I turn sixteen. It's a place right where I live, bakery and deli and restaurant. Expensive and lucrative is to the restaurant, Italian and checkered red and white tables is to the bakery and deli. The place has some good history with me and the people who used to be my friends. For now I'm making money off of whatever I can, and having fun cutting plants, replanting plants, doing laundry and digging up dog shit and standing in one spot with a hose for half an hour. I love it. I don't know how long I will, but I do now."

Failed to mention that. Finally got Betty and dropped her off at Jungle Toy, where it's guaranteed to be fixed in just a few days to a week. Selling my PS2 on eBay ($100 reserve, so I get to decide if I wanna sell it or not if it's below that) and FInal Fantasy XI and Rise of Whatever expansion package ($25 reserve). Daniel's selling them for me. He came over for a while today and we had fun playing Call of Duty and making fun of Mike and laughing at his my-dick-is-bigger-than-yours attempts to thwart us and our awesome use of words and politically-incorrectness. My PS2 and FFXI+Whatever being sold is just one step to my next airsoft riffle. I thought of getting a snipper riffle, but then everyone has fully-automatic bad-ass guns, which would kill me and my heavy one-shot, bolt-action piece of metal. AK-47 it is. So goodnight, everyone, whoever you are. Except you stalkers and pedos. I hate you. :D"

Last night must have been the worst night of my life because nothing ever happens to me. I never get sick. And I didn't get sick, but something was wrong with me and it's... gone. So I'm stoked. Airsoft game today. Unfortunately Betty's still at Softair Depot. More on that as I finish this next part; Daniel Klus and Mike Derlatka and <em>maybe</em> Mike Ammar (Dan's best bud) are over at Kyle's, a guy's house where twelve or more people meet to airsoft every few weeks. Daniel's battery wasn't working, so he went to Softair Depot to ask them if they could hoook it up to a smartcharger to get it done in two hours instead of six. I called just to see how they were doing, but they hadn't played a single game yet, mainly because another Mike (damn these Mikes), whom everyone loves and looks&nbsp; up to (even me) hadn't arrived yet. Dan said when he goes to pick up his battery he'd tell me if my gun's been cracked open yet. If not, I'm taking it out of there and taking it to Jungle Toy, where Daniel, after trying to upgrade his AK-74, broke it into individual pieces, and broke his spring, had it repaired. Mike D. also got his M4A1 repaired there, as a special service, because his brand of airsoft guns (ICS) is all-metal and all-shit, and JT doesn't work on that brand. I can trust them to do it in a few days, while at Softair Depot... seven weeks and waiting. Wish more girls played the sport, though, instead of screaming, crying, scratching, or storming. Evey game some guy's sitting it out and talking on his cellphone to his raging girlfriend. I'm not a cynical guy, or I try not to be, and so I don't assume it's either person's fault. I'm just suggesting it'd be fun to shoot at guys for a while for some people without killing them, but rather hurting them.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>I got a</u> joke that Johna, my sister Alex's girlfriend told me.

"event","&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp; <u>I killed a</u> bird today. Lately a hobby of mine and my friends has been airsoft, a sport a lot like painball, only with modelled guns and 6mm plastic BBs. Daniel Klus had brought his AK-74 over when I invited him and another friend of mine, Mike Derlatka, to show it off (he'd just bought it, and upgraded it, too, three times more than allowed for a paintball match; 450fps). We took turns shooting each other, except Mike, who is too pussy to do anything remotely dangerous, but never feels guilty trying to play the ""my-dick's-bigger-than-yours"" game. Afterwards we fired around for fun, shooting old flourescent bulbs and making them explode, cactuses. We got to animals, and I meant it just as a shoot-and-miss sorta game, and even though we'd hit birds before, they never moved or had anything broken. I hit a bird, and its wing was split in two. Daniel, Mike and I watched it try to fly off the roof and slide into the cement. Mike said he looked pretty beat up. I said he would die. Daniel agreed, and said bugs or another animal might get to it in a few days. Mike said we should kill it. I took the gun and... well. It was amazing is all I can say. No blood, no fluffed up feathers. From so close up, nothing flew through the bird and nothing bounced off. All those plastic white balls of death stayed inside of it, ten per second, and it didn't die. It lumbered into some bushes. Mike looked the other way, and Daniel took the gun from me, adjusted the rate of fire, and finished it off after three more seconds.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  <u>But that's not</u> all that bad... It was a small event, and mostly an accident, because even though we were shooting at stuff, we didn't mean to injure or hurt them. I guess that's a dumb idea, but it's how I saw it then. Beforehand I was woken up around 12:30 pm by Mom going to take grandma to the ER. I was kinda non-plussed, but she'd been hurting for a long time, and I thought that she'd feel better in a hospital, and went to sleep after they left. I was planning on sleeping all day, anyway, because the previous day sucked because the plans were fucked. Daniel was dragged to work at 5:00 am by his dad,&nbsp; and that's hard, I know, because I work alongside him and Bruno over summer vacations. At least he got paid for that. Mark didn't answer his phone, and Mike decided to go by hisself when I told him I'd rather go with the whole gang or hang around with Hanna and Ben at home, my sibling and sibling-in-law. I made those two kids food and some stuff to drink, and mixed a bit of spiced rum with peach iced tea (weird combo) and watched TV and talked to 'em. Watched the 40-Year-Old Virgin, finally, and went to sleep after LiveJournal erased yesterday's entry somehow. Today, though, after getting up at 1:30 pm, I showered, ate, played the Godfather, and hung out with Hanna dn Ben again when they dropped in. They watched ""Everything is Illuminated"" and I invited Mike over, then Daniel after I let the kid play the Godfather 'cause he's... kinda a GTA game fan, and he wanted to see why it reminded him of ""I'm making you an offer you can't refuse."" I wanted to laugh my ass of at him, but I didn't. Dan and his buddies and I have got this mutual agreement where we can't play games with each other unless we get shot by our own shit first. I went prone from around fifty feet (prone is laying down) and aimed his Kalashnikov right at where I'd imagine the concave between his ribs would be. He has a nice red crater there now. He shot me, too, between the right of my chest and my arm, and left no mark, so I let him shoot me again and he got me on the left side of my chest. We shot out old flourescent lights that propped the trash can lid up so the exploded stuff wouldn't fly everywhere, and etc. After the aforementioned incident, we played the Godfather s'more, and were going to play ""hide-and-go-shoot,"" but Mike's mom came. Shortly after, Daniel drove home, too. Then I decided to work on some artsy stuff and now I'm writing this journal. Interesting day, huh? At least it's been an overall good one. Gramma's fine now. They just want her to stay at the hospital one night. Mom's lookin' good, and Hanna and Ben got their stomachs full, as they like to when they come over. :D Freeloading, crazy-in-love, let's-get-married-now-before-we-can-really-support-ourselves kids. They make me laugh, but Hanna can piss me off easy, and Ben's too cautious, but their whole predicament is kinda cute. Until tomorrow, au revoir."

I'm planning on making a bow and a bunch of arrows. Amazing how much of a bitch it is to make those arrows. If anyone happens to be interested I can make a little guide with pictures and stuff. To make a basic bow, though, you just soak it in water for a couple days and then bend it between the spokes of a fence; the kind of fence you usually see around pools. After a couple days when it's dry, soak it again and bend it more, and repeat until you get whatever bendiness you want (there's a certain amount you should bend for every length so that 1) you can pull it far without breaking it and 2) bent enough so that you /can/ pull it). Then you just cut or sand down the tops and bottoms of the bow with two slitswhere the string will go (it's also a bitch to taut that thing, unless you have help--then you'll get it perfect). Arrows are mainly concentration, and you can get the wood from pretty much any small hobby shop. They might be a tad long, but you can cut them easily. The hard part is the feathers, which I don't want to talk about right now or else I'd make myself feel sad again. And then there's AIRSOFT.

It was camo day in school today, and someone actually came in with a guilly suit, which is basically a cloak with a ton of brown or green strips of plastic that help you sink into the ground if you're lying prone. I picked one of those off as he was walking by. I learned that tomorrow in French we're getting doughnuts 'cause we kicked another classes ass at some verb conjugation quiz. From English I took the long way to Science for the sake of taking the long way to Science because I didn't feel like sitting down for a whole other hour and not have some standing up fit in there somewhere. Also, during English we had a Socratic Seminar in which we discussed the minor characters, namely Jerry and Ms. Pross, and their importance in <u>A Tale of Two Cities</u>. I said Dickens seemed to like to use them to, first, make them interesting by giving them lively traits, and second, as a way to throw questions to the audience in a less obvious way than he would using a main character, asking aloud ""why is my spaghetti missing?"" or something along those lines. I also wanted to say that the minor characters, who were activists in the (French) Revolution, seemed to be richer than the peasants, and that this seemed pretty common in heroic novels, but just as I started saying it, someone called ""time."" We get ten minutes to say shit. In Geometry I couldn't find my assignment sheet, which didn't matter much because I didn't do last night's homework, or the night before's, but I'll make it up for tomorrow. Also turned in extra credit work which got me to 118% in that class, causing Mom come in here, ruffle my hair, and kiss me. My God, what an amazing thing, this A.

I went to sleep after I got home for two hours from 3:30 pm, and when I woke up it was to order pizza and chicken 'cause Mom decided to have my sister, Hanna, come over. That and we have a fridge full of food, but, like I like to say, nothing to eat.

Makes me want to go to sleep, but if I do that I'll feel even worse because I wouldn't have been able to do all the stuff I'd be able to think of that I'd be able to have done earlier when I woke up. Seriously, I almost wish I could take Betty out on Brian, a guy who used to be my friend until I realized what an immature fuckhead he was three years ago. The reason I wanted to pull her out on him was because if I did get provoked enough to fight he'd go run for his pump shotgun, and even though that could probably get under my skin, it won't hurt me. I know this dude. Just a stressful day 'cause everyone feels like picking on me, even if it's just for fun; doesn't feel that way because by the time I got to some friends I was already pissed. I checked the mirror for my eye today, too. It looks like my left eyes is lazy and as if I was sleep-deprived on one side. I also found I'd forgotten to do half my Geometry homework, and realized how I'd already lost some potential credit in English just for not finishing reading through some chapters of Tale of Two Cities, by Charles Dickins. Not a good day at all. I also got to moping because I haven't had my CD player for a while, and I get cranky without music. I'd sing, but I'm self-concious. I also couldn't find my belt this morning, so I had to walk around all day pulling my pants up, until I got two safety pins that sorta helped by strapping them to my boxers (thank God for elastic) and pulling them up as high as I could without injuring my family heirlooms. That didn't help much either, and was a nuissance, too. *Sigh* Nope, not a good day at all.
   There is some hope. Ben might take me to Borders bookstore so I can get a little something-something, and he'll buy me a new CD player (hopefully <-- see? Hopefulness). I promised to give him the best Fettuccini Alfredo of his life (already made last evening) and to pay most of the sum back in a few days. Or never pay him back. Hehe. As self-involved this entry sounds, I have to say, it's some damn good venting mechanism here. I haven't had a day this bad since Saturday night, which is a pretty long time. I got too used to the good.

   No Borders visit today. No fun, no good... nothing. Today's the kind of day you want to end, but you keep thinking something good or interesting will happen. It won't. The most interesting thing that'll happen to me today is getting something to munch on and going to the red bridge I always used to have to cross on my way to my elementary school, Aire Libre. Last I went there was around 12:00 AM over the weekend, and it was nice to just watch the cars go by, with their own little self-important business affairs where all they had to do was get to some other place. I could see the clouds and the wind blew hard and it was fucking freezing. The best part was seeing the lowest, whitest clouds flying over Lookout mountain and the hills way North past my high school. I'd been out for about two hours before I came home. Without a watch to know what time it was, it seemed longer, but I liked it... I got to think... And I do that a lot. I've come to the conclusion that I won't be able to do anything about anything until I have a car... then I could drive to some dark place, some mountain, and lay down on the hood and watch the sky.

   I started drinking since the New Year. I figured I might as well, for whatever reason. I drink once or twice a week, either fun or, usually, when I'm having a terrible time with my family. I don't plan to drink for that anymore--even if I barely have a glass, I think it's gonna turn into a pretty bad habit. Well, not anymore. Now it /won't/ turn into a pretty bad habit. But it /would/. Now my anti-drug is Neopets. Haven't seen it in, like, two years. Even that has its downsides. Pet + Wheel of Misfortune = x_x Fucking disease."

All that really ahppened was a grudge with a certain member of my family, a the realization that Betty Beretty (<a href=""http://imageshack.us""><img src=""http://img96.imageshack.us/img96/4448/pict00141gw.jpg"" border=""0"" width=""1600"" alt=""Image Hosted by ImageShack.us"" /></a>) will probably not be repaired in time for Spring Break and the many opporunities it presents to shoot my friends. I was considering renaming her to ""Vendetty"" 'cause, well, she hurts when you get shot close up, and that's what I do to the people I dislike. I got shot with her at point blank once. A small, plastic BB travelling at 335 feet-per-second into my chest. Well, not in. But it almost got stuck in there. Hehe. Yes, many people have felt the wrath of Betty. Like Jason, my cousin-in-law, who picked up a one-cock-per-shot shotgun and fired at me and Daniel while we were having a six-shot duel. Lots of hyphens there. Anyway, I shot Jason out of surprise and he had no goggles on. Luckily I missed his eye by a centimeter and he got a nice crater with a red senter on his brow. From twenty feet away. Hehe. *Sigh* And then there's my resolution to do well in school this quarter, As and Bs only, which is going well thus far. Also got some drawings I'll edit in Macromedia Flash 8 and Photoshop CS. I also slept a long time during the day; five hours maybe. Now it's time to sleep again, so I say, goodnight."

"event","Today was lame. I decided to have a GTA fest and played San Andreas throughout the day on and off, switching between that and trying (minimal key-wordiness on that word) to get someone to take me somewhere, somehow. Eventually Dad called and we spoke for a few minutes planning to go tomorrow to buy some clothes for me and get me a haircut. You know, my hair's all I've got going for me, and it isn't even going. Just like the fact that it's longer than most kids' hair these days, but it looks like shit. I saw V for Vendetta, too, with my sister, Hanna, and her husband, Ben, and my mom. It was a good movie because a lot of it involved symbolism and whoever wrote the original comic (if the script for the movie wasn't much modified) must have been a very good writer. Besides that, today, I had a headache and slept between 4:30 and 6:00 pm. I've been thinking a lot lately, and it doesn't make me feel right, because thinking a lot is a lot like being spying on someone. The more you look, the more you find out. The more I think, the more I come to realization. I've realized my life is boring and that it's going nowhere and that I've pretty much failed two of my classes this quarter; I realize that I'm sleeping enough and that I'm being an idiot most of the day; I realize I do so little though I can do so much more. I wish I had more friends than the only two I really have (and yet, they aren't my friends, either). I wish my family was cleaner and I wish I got along better, wish I could talk to people without stuttering or mumbling, wish I wasn't overweight and wish I was better at everything I did. But then what the fuck would be the point of living? Death erases someone's problems, but not the problems of the people that knew them. People who have everything might as well be dead, while the people who definitely could need some help wish they would die. The world's fucked up, but maybe I can help someone out, help myself out. Maybe I can find someone worth living for, right? I'm bound to. I just have to find a way to let them know that. That's what I keep thinking, among things nowadays. Next quarter starts on Monday. It's almost 5:00 am Sunday morning. I'll be up in two more hours to get myself awake enough to go around town with Dad and maybe get something else to do before I'm forced into a church for a few hours in the evening."

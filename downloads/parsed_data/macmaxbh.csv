"event","<p>Over the past week, especially on April 1st, as I sorted through my RSS feeds I found a couple of nice links (both written and video) I wanted to highlight, in no particular order.</p><ul>
<li><a href=""http://blog.patrickrothfuss.com/2011/04/photo-contest-ii-the-return/"">Patrick Rothfuss' Photo Contest II</a>--Patrick Rothfuss, author of the awesome <em>The Name of the Wind</em> and <em>The Wise Man's Fear</em> (if you are at all interested in the fantasy genre, you should read his books) had a photo contest back in 2008 with paperback copies of NOTW. This post announces a new contest and links back to the old ones (there are some fantastic photos there, I love the angry baby). The blog is generally highly recommended.</li>
<li>[afd] <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wM0eBoJowOw"">ALL CAPS Band: New Album Announcement</a>--All Caps is a techno nerdy spin-off band from two wizard rockers. Their new album announcement (released yesterday) I find pretty hilarious. For those who don't know ALL CAPS, their two most famous songs are <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWJ69j0Qpm8"">World of Warcraft Ruined My Life</a> and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_51Hs56wW4"">Don't Unplug Me</a>. Watch them. :) </li>
<li>Google is awesome #1: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blB_X38YSxQ&amp;feature=player_embedded"">This job is very tempting</a>, I might have to switch away from Microsoft. </li>
<li>Google is evil #1: <a href=""http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/11_15/b4223041200216.htm"">Do Not Anger the Alpha Android</a>--reports Google's crackdown on their ""open"" Android platform. I am a happy iPhone 4 user (although my next phone could be a Windows Phone, depending on the market) and always knew the platform was controlled by Apple; which I find much less objectionable than Google claiming their platform was open, ridiculing Apple, and now trying to lock down their ecosystem.</li>
<li><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVypcaLbL-M"">NextUp Submission: Jason Munday</a>--Jason Munday is a member of the Ministry of Magic (my favorite wizard rock group) and does his own music (called ""Skyway Flyer""). This post has a short song he wrote about Mario and clips of his other music videos, most of which I really like.</li>
<li>On the slightly more serious side, a great presentation called <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=X0sG6rpvq3Y"">Zombies, Cyborgs, and International Relations</a> which makes the case that focusing on the zombie apocalypse just distracts us from the time when cyborgs will take over the world. Pretty fantastic. Linked to from Ezra Klein, a political/economic blogger who I've enjoyed adding to my bloglist. </li>
<li>[afd] <a href=""http://www.tor.com/stories/2011/04/the-shadow-war-of-the-night-dragons-book-one-the-dead-city-excerpt"">The Shadow War of the Night Dragons, Book One: The Dead City (Excerpt)</a>: The first portion of John Scalzi (a sci-fi author)'s new Epic Fantasy series. Patrick Rothfuss, stand aside!</li>
<li>Google is awesome #2"" <a href=""http://www.ted.com/talks/sebastian_thrun_google_s_driverless_car.html"">TED video: Google's driverless car</a>--I want one! Will be on the lookout for them when I go to California.</li>
<li><a href=""http://arstechnica.com/science/news/2011/04/photoessay-images-from-first-orbits.ars"">Photoessay: Images from first planetary orbits</a>--great article and great images about the first images captured of the planets in our solar system. Ars Technica consistently turns out the highest caliber technology and science news; I'm extremely impressed.</li>
<li><a href=""http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2011/03/29/the-problem-with-microsoft/"">The Problem with Microsoft</a>--interesting analysis on a Fortune tech blog about Microsoft, Balmer, and Windows. Not sure I could say anything to prove or disprove any of the statements, but it might be useful to keep in mind as I join Microsoft's workforce in August.</li>

I was going through and clearing out all the items on my desktop (and archived-desktop folder) and went through a whole bunch of links from 2008 onwards. There are a couple of gems I wanted to highlight here in the hopes others might find them interesting and I'll remember them for the future:

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://blogs.msdn.com/b/jensenh/archive/2008/03/12/table-of-contents.aspx"">An Office User Interface Blog: Table Contents</a>--Jensen Harris wrote a remarkable series of blog posts on the design of the Office 2007 user interface and on the feedback process. Very, very interesting (and you don't have to read all of them; I didn't until a couple of days ago). </li>
<li><a href=""http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2009/01/top-25-most-dangerous-programming-mistakes.html"">Top 25 most Dangerous Programming Mistakes</a>--a list from Coding Horror, actually ganked from SANS, about the top 25 security issues code, especially web-based code, can have. Very interesting list to keep in mind while coding (or testing). </li>
<li><a href=""http://ejohn.org/blog/a-web-developers-responsibility/"">A Web Developer's Responsibility</a>--a detailed post by John Resig on reporting web browser bugs; which I found very interesting and is something I will really try to do at Hotmail. </li>
</ul>

Hope all you readers are doing well. It's exam time here at UNC. :)"

"event","And now, in a shameless rip-off of <a href=""http://daringfireball.net"">Daring Fireball</a>'s <a href=""http://daringfireball.net/linked/"">Linked List</a>, I present to my faithful blog readers a list of articles I found interesting over the past couple of weeks (some of which I believe are actually stolen directly from the aforementioned Linked List):

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/02/23/we-pretend-we-are-christians/"">We Pretend We Are Christians</a>--an very interesting blog post/reader email on the Freakonomics blog talking about a family in Texas who pretend to be Christians so they're not ostracized from their communities. It made me think about some of the failings of American equality and of the pressure and desire of ""fitting in"", and generally of the difference between the majority of Americans, who seem to be lip-service Christians, and several of my friends, who truly believe in the Christian faith and how much it shapes their lives, and my own agnostic atheist beliefs. (Reading in my history textbook about how similar Christianity is to the earlier ""mystery religions"" that swept the Western World and how it adopted the customs of pagan religions adds another dimension to the debate). My personal hope (and goal, perhaps) is that I'm not one of those forces that pressure others around me to conform to whatever norm I'm spouting and lets others state their beliefs as they are, even if they're different from mine. </li>
<li><a href=""http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/02/26/hey-waiter-just-how-much-extra-do-you-really-expect/"">Hey, Waiter! Just How Much Extra Do You Really Expect?</a>--an blog post/rant, also from the New Yorker, about tipping. I think wait staff should be paid a decent wage (and treated as a serious employment) and a base tip should be included in prices basically because that's how they do it in France and from my perspective at least it seems to work quite well. Even as an American I'm often unsure how much to tip (I generally do something around 15%, rounding to make the totals seem nice). I once got yelled at for (not completely intentionally) giving an <10% tip. </li>
<li><a href=""http://arstechnica.com/business/news/2010/03/why-ad-blocking-is-devastating-to-the-sites-you-love.ars"">Why Ad Blocking is devastating to the sites you love</a>--I thought it was an interesting article, especially since I haven't ad-blocked for years (I used to use <a href=""http://www.culater.net/software/PithHelmet/PithHelmet.php"">PithHelmet</a> with Safari). I believe there were enough times my ad-blocker blocked part of the page I actually wanted that I just turned it off, an inability to block Google suggested sites, and the fact it would break with every Safari update which was also rather obnoxious. Apart from Flash ads liking to chew up CPU cycles and crash at regular intervals (affecting nothing else), I'm not really bothered by ads. Perhaps the issue is skewed by the fact that I have paid subscriptions to several of the major sites I view (<a href=""http://arstechnica.com/subscriptions/"">Ars Technica</a>, <a href=""http://daringfireball.net/members/"">Daring Fireball</a>, <a href=""http://slashdot.org/subscribe.pl"">Slashdot</a>, <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/manage/account/"">LiveJournal</a>) so I see fewer ads / see the value in supporting sites I find valuable. </li>
<li><a href=""http://www.browserchoice.eu"">Browser Ballot</a>--the Microsoft Browser Ballot was in the news recently (such as the fact that its randomization was not <a href=""http://www.robweir.com/blog/2010/02/microsoft-random-browser-ballot.html"">actually random</a>), and perhaps you might find it interesting to actually see the ballot and read how browser makers sum up their browser into one sentence. Also interesting: the ballot contains twelve browsers. I definitely didn't know there were twelve, I could have told you half of them at the most (although I know <a href=""http://www.omnigroup.com/products/omniweb/"">a</a> <a href=""http://caminobrowser.org/"">couple</a> <a href=""http://www.konqueror.org/"">non</a>-<a href=""http://projects.gnome.org/epiphany/"">Windows</a> ones left off the Windows ballot).</li>
<li>Two blog posts by David Pogue on various features of Windows Live (<a href=""http://pogue.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/03/04/a-closer-look-at-windows-live/"">Skydrive</a> and <a href=""http://pogue.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/03/11/microsofts-free-sync-service/"">Windows Live Sync</a>). As a future intern working for Windows Live Communications, I approve of Windows Live features being publicized, and as someone who may bring <a href=""http://www.microsoft.com/liveatedu"">Live@Edu/a> to UNC, I think these features could be useful to UNC students. Also, I didn't actually know what Windows Live Sync actually was (I thought it was a mobile contact sync thing, but it is basically more like <a href=""https://www.dropbox.com/"">Dropbox</a>, a folder sync and sharing tool, although <a href=""https://www.mesh.com/welcome/default.aspx"">Live Mesh</a> is actually even more like Dropbox with cloud storage options). Hmm, I think I need to look at the Live tools more in depth. </li>
<li><a href=""http://yro.slashdot.org/story/10/03/05/1455212/Vivek-Kundra-On-US-Government-Inefficiency"">(Federal CIO) Vivek Kundra On US Government Inefficiency</a>--Slashdot discussion which intersects government inefficiency, bureaucracy , libertarianism, private sector inefficiency, health insurance, etc. which I found pretty interesting.</li>
<li><a href=""http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2010/03/just-dont-claim-i-said-this-was-true.html"">""Markets are efficient if and only if P = NP""</a>--'nuff said. </li>
<li><a href=""http://www.quirksmode.org/politics/"">Dutch politics -- a primer for foreigners</a>--a good and thorough explanation of the Dutch political system, of the different parties, of the recent happenings. Interesting to me. </li>
<li><a href=""http://nimbledesign.com/post/441423115/the-path-of-most-resistance"">The Path of Most Resistance</a>--a blog post linked on Daring Fireball on a couple of short topics (tech support, Macs, search engine, design). One of the more interesting things: Time and again he sees that non-techies just don't understand file systems. They just seem like a labyrinth. I think I agree, and I truly believe that special-purpose computing devices like the iPad are the future for the grand majority of computer users (they don't want to do maintenance on their computers, they just want them to work without being messed with). </li>

Hopefully I should post more things soon that aren't just links; but my track record is pretty bad when it comes to that."

"event","Wizard Rock videos on Youtube makes everything better. Too bad I'm probably not going to Sonorous this weekend. There better be wizard rock in California this summer, is all I'm gonna say. (Oh, and HTML5 Youtube FTW. Less Flash == much more happy and responsive computer)

But seriously, life is pretty crazy, y'all. Some highlights of my next week:

I have 8am Physics mechanics. I have discovered I really don't care very much how the world works. I think this bad mood has a lot to do with the first exam coming on Wednesday and a lab report due on Thursday and an assignment due on Friday. But I've had it for a while. Did a bit of studying today; I derived all the basic constant acceleration kinematics equations. Fun.

CS Club Student Body President forum on Tuesday. Hopefully will be enlightening both for us and for the candidates. Prepared and graded platforms this afternoon. 

ResNET monthly meeting on Wednesday. Will be doing a presentation on IT at UNC news. Made a presentation on SEP 11, Virtual Labs, VPN, student email outsourcing, and the MS student fee; submitted it to the management team for suggestions and comments. 

Also with ResNET, decided to apply for SRCC, am interviewing on Thursday. 

Grandfather's birthday celebration on Thursday. Hmm, does he want presents/cards?

Weekly research meeting on Wednesday. Am finally working on creating an H.264 parsing tool (""H264Katana""); still working on parsing the slice header. It's nice to check in code. Probably am not progressing as fast as KMP would like; in fact, need to send him another email with a question, he's not parsing something in NAL Units that I need in the header.

Also: Other classes (Empire and Diplomacy; still waiting on the professor to email out the assignment for Tuesday while somebody wants to borrow the book we're reading because he doesn't have a copy; Internet Architecture and Performance, which hasn't heated up yet, Personal History of Computing on Fridays which I may still drop due to its non-zero workload, ACM programming practice which I/my team worked on today). Tech and Web office hours. My first CAPCOM meeting. A Lenovo roadmap presentation on Friday. 

Yay. Oh my life, never a dull moment."

"event","Yesterday, I was offered a paid summer internship as a SDET (Software Development Engineer in Test; a tester) with the <a href=""http://www.windowslive.com/Explore"">Windows Live</a> Communications team (who run <a href=""http://mail.live.com/"">Hotmail</a>, <a href=""http://download.live.com/messenger"">Messenger</a>, <a href=""http://calendar.live.com/"">Calendar</a>, and other services) which is based in Mountain View, California on Microsoft's Silicon Valley Campus. (Yes, the campus is a couple of blocks down from Google's headquarters; I'm actually sitting on a Google beanbag right now in the airport advertising <a href=""http://www.freeholidaywifi.com/"">their free wifi</a>, which I am using to write this message).

I was sent an email two weeks ago that I was selected for second-round interviews, Microsoft arranged my flights from RDU; I left early Thursday morning, had four 45-minute interviews in a row yesterday morning (and then they gave me the news about an hour later), and as I mentioned above, I'm flying back now.

It's all pretty exciting--the people I met at Microsoft were all very nice, smart, and doing cool stuff. Five years ago, I thought of Microsoft more as the evil empire, and now I'm really excited about doing an internship with them this summer. Interesting how things change...

I'll be getting more details, be able to pick a starting time for my 12-week internship, and can sign all the official paperwork sometime soon. It's all still a bit crazy for me."

"event","So, fellow readers, I beg of you to offer me advice on my course schedule for next semester.

Abbreviated Background: Next semester I'm working for <a href=""http://resnet.unc.edu"">ResNET</a>, serving as co-chair of the Technology and Web Services committee of the <a href=""http://www.unc.edu/studgov/"">Executive Branch of Student Government</a>; and plan to start a research project (of which Noura has convinced me to do for academic credit, as less would be unfair to my professor and would make things too stressful for me). 

Considering all this, and the fact that two of my classes are COMP 530 (Operating Systems) and COMP 550 (Algorithms and Analysis), both considered to be rather difficult, it makes sense that I take no more than two other academic courses (meaning I'd be taking 4 academic courses + research for credit = 5 courses, my standard courseload). Right now, I'm signed up for three courses, and am deciding which one to drop (unless you'd like to convince me I shouldn't.) Your advice would be greatly appreciated.

The contenders are: STOR 435 (Introduction to Probability)
+ required by my major. going to have to take it eventually
+ I've done a bit of requirement-avoiding; the responsible thing to do is take this
- I'm least interested in this course [edit: of the three. Probably could still be interesting, I don't know <b>too</b> much about it, but it is a required course which is why I signed up for it (while I was waitlisted for 455).]

STOR 455 (Statistical Methods I)
+ it bills itself as the beginning of a two semester introduction to higher-level statistics and on to applying statistics properly. I've been interested in taking statistics courses (and one with a more rigorous foundation than pushing calculator buttons) since I took AP Statistics in sophomore year of high school. I wanted to take this.
+ the teacher was very communicative when I emailed him to get into the course (it filled up)
~ currently <i>doesn't</i> count for my interdisciplinary requirement for CS. 435, 445, yes, but not 455. I might ask about that; it may be too 'applied' for the CS department. 
~ offered only in the fall since it's the start of a two semester course
- taking this <i>does</i> mean that I still have to take STOR 435. 
- part of the reason I might want to stay is because I emailed the professor and talked to him; that shouldn't necessarily be a reason

FREN 300 (grammar review)
+ with the teacher I've already taken French with and I like
+ opens up the entire French major courses to me; the last low-level French course
+ it'd help me keep my French 
+ It's a breath of liberal arts in my math/CS-heavy schedule
+ one of my friends from Dutch class should be in the class
- ANOTHER language course? I have credit for NINE. The CS major requires frakkin' three. Get over yourself.
- I can take this anytime. 
- I'm not necessarily <i>planning</i> to take courses in the French major. 

I also am currently in the honors junior colloquium on 'medicine and society'. planning on dropping it because:
- conflicts with ResNET meetings. 
- I don't need more on my plate and the Honors program is dumb
- don't know next to anything about it, I'm not sure I'm particularly interested in the class, I'm not a medical person. Politics, perhaps. 
- one credit hour course. really. 
but,
+ it would help me keep in the Honors program
+ perhaps this should be my liberal arts flavor?

People I trust have suggested I drop each of the three (well, four. but the last doesn't count, just put in in case you want to argue I should keep it). Please measure in, even if you did before.

Thank you, I really appreciate it.

[edited to say: This really is a somewhat trivial choice. All of these courses (well, not colloquium but whatever) will come again. It's just that I see them as pretty evenly balanced but the pros and cons weight different priorities in my life. I could also take all three and drop one later, but part of that is just delaying the decision.]"

"event","I will be one of the two co-chairs for the Executive Branch of UNC Student Government's Technology and Web Services (commonly abbreviated Tech and Web) committee. I'll be working with my fellow committee member from this year, Andrew Phillips. 

(Yay for long and official-sounding titles!)

I just updated the website and added a nice redirect link.

http://www.unc.edu/studgov/techandweb

I'm excited; it should be a great experience and hopefully not too much more work then what I did this year. The transition meeting is this afternoon.

It was my birthday on Friday. I had a good low-key but enjoyable birthday. My parents got me an iPod Touch so I can check my email and generally do computer-related things without lugging my computer around--my dad's iPod Touch was useful when I had it for a while and now we both have our own. The App Store has exploded in the past 9 months or so, when I checked back then I could actually look through every single app. 

Debating whether to by LogMeIn Ignition so I can access my computer from my phone. Probably, it's just expensive for an iPod app ($30), but I guess cheap for a normal app, which it basically is."

"event","I suck at updating this. Not that this bears repeating. I've been using Twitter somewhat frequently as an announcement/micro-blogging platform; but those two goals are at odds (if I want something announced, I can't micro-blog when I feel like it).

So here are some cool links I've been discovering over the past few days. 

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://blog.wired.com/wiredscience/2009/04/newtonai.html"">Computer Program Self-Discovers Laws of Physics</a> is the Wired summary to the full article, which is <a href=""http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/reprint/324/5923/81.pdf"">here</a>. It's basically a computer program that uses genetic algorithms to find non-trivial invariants in collected experimental data--it starts off with random equations, then figures out which ones are ""least wrong"" and tweaks them, making them more and more accurate, while also being encouraged to minimize the terms in its invariant result. The result? Science laws. It's really damn cool, especially since we can collect data a lot faster and lot better then we can actually analyze it. </li>
<li><a href=""http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnigraphsketcher"">OmniGraphSketcher</a> is a new Mac app that basically allows you to make graphs. It's not just a point grapher, you can create curves by dragging, you can highlight areas between curves, it's a much more visual way of looking at graphs--something you'd find in an econ textbook rather than in a science lab report. It's pretty awesome, though, I used a couple of its features to help me do a presentation for my ACM class. </li>
<li><a href=""http://universityrelations.unc.edu/campaigns/2009/04champions/ad.pdf"">This UNC ad is pretty awesome.</a>. I personally find that the ability of a person to throw a ball through a cloth basket does not actually excite me at all and certainly does not represent the academic institution that the person may be associated with. However, I also got a little bitter at all the really smart people who get scholarships, just because I was a bit bitter that NCSSM administration never cared about me because I didn't win any prestigious scholarships for the school, that was all they cared about academically, and I didn't get robertson and am way too unathletic to get morehead-cain, but I think I do a lot of really awesome stuff.  <br / >Frankly, I should stop bitching. UNC is paying me to go to school here (with my combination of merit scholarships and ResNET) That's pretty awesome and probably something that very few people have, and frankly, I should get over this whole low-self-esteem thing. Like now. <br />
Also, I know one of the students who got the Rhodes (she's in my Dutch class) and she's actually really nice and awesome, and all these people probably are too. :) </li>
<li><a href=""http://www.bostonreview.net/BRwebonly/cohen2.php"">Always At the After Party (A Liberal on Libertarians)</a>--I think I agree with what was said in this article. A quote from it has been up on my Safari tabs since the first week of February (as I say below, tabs in Safari open for waaay too long) but I never read the whole thing until now. I really don't want to start more political debates versus libertarianism--I did that <a href=""http://www.new.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=83976488474&ref=mf"">here</a> already. However, one quote really spoke to me, so I'll quote it again here:
<blockquote>
We think that politics is more than an unfortunate necessity required by our inability to live together without killing each other. We think it is, can be anyway, an arena in which we work out and pursue, sometimes with notable success, large and constructive purposes. </blockquote>
I have faith in government. Not blind faith, but faith that government can be and is a good force in people's lives. It's not perfect, as it is made up of men and men are definitely fallible, but it is definitely not despicable. </li>
<li><a href=""http://truecostofcredit.com/"">The True Cost of Credit</a> lets you know what the processing fees are whenever you use your credit or debit card. Very interesting. </li>
<li><a href=""http://csswizardry.com/web-design+/"">Web Design+</a>, a neat list of how to do various things in web development using standards-compliant code. Seems like a good reference.
</ul>
 
I have way too many tabs open in Safari. They serve as reminders of things I want to read or reply to/ bookmarks / whatever, but they need to be sorted through and closed. If Safari didn't have a ""Restore all tabs from last session"", then crashes / accidental shutdowns / etc would be horribly difficult. Working on that now and things are already a lot better!

I went on an upgrade spree yesterday / this morning. Updating open source software is fun 'cause there's a lot of updates, always, and I like updating things, intrinsically. However, <a href=""http://www.finkproject.org"">fink</a> update-all ran into a snag because of a circular dependency with libtool2 and libtool14, but I think it's all been worked out by installing a couple of things once at a time (thus, the tools that need libtool2 can install, the tools that need libtool14 can install, and the two can remove each other's libtool first)."

Partial failure of www.unc.edu cluster

Partial failure of www.unc.edu cluster
ID: 11260

A single node in our www.unc.edu cluster got into a very unstable state and stopped responding to HTTP(S) requests. This triggered our load balancer to automatically remove it from the pool and redirecting customers to good servers. We're rebooting the host at this time and it should be back online soon. A handful of users may have noticed some sluggishness before they were redirected to good servers.

WIN for the load balancer! I'm glad it automatically removed the server from the pool once it realized it wasn't working correctly. This is how technology is supposed to work. :)

In other news, I was very productive this weekend. If only I understood my differential equations class (if only I had a better teacher?) then everything would be near-perfect, except for that econ midterm on thursday I haven't started studying for.

I am also in a good mood because my COMP 431 due Wednesday assignment works! Now all I have to do is re-comment it and I'm good to go. My COMP 426 assignment due tomorrow was done yesterday, I actually did my Dutch reading tonight instead of putting it off, and I did all the diff.eq. homework I was able to understand (thank you, wikipedia, for explaining the basic concepts behind eigenvalues and eigenvectors very well). I was productive, and I saw my family today and hung out with friends yesterday. 

Not perfect, but I'll take it."

"event","I apparently have issues with this whole ""using LiveJournal regularly"" thing. I do want to use LJ more frequently in shorter bursts instead of very infrequently in long bursts. 

So, things of interest in no particular order:
<ul>
<li>I'm currently up in McLean, Virginia (outside of Washington DC) staying with my grandmother for a week. I've been doing this for a couple of years, and it's a good tradition--I don't see my grandmother very often, and spending some low-key time with her is nicer than the crazy high-tension Thanksgivings when we all got together (which don't even happen anymore</li>
<li>My cousin (who lives next to my grandmother) is having her Bat Mitzvah this weekend, so the family will be assembling this weekend up here and celebrating--I just got a bit of a head start on the visit.</li>
<li>I took the train up--it's pretty convenient for me, since there's a train station right in Cary which'll take me up to Alexandria in a mere six hours. Dirt cheap now (about $35 one-way). You have to have a physical ticket mailed to you in the mail, which is ridiculous, and there's normal power plugs for each seat in the train, which is great. Due to construction, the only train left at 6:15am. Fun times. </li>
<li>Instead of sleeping like any sane person on the train, I instead took this opportunity to catch up on some podcasts, in particular, the <a href=""http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/4pod/20080530"">Dungeons & Dragons Penny Arcade / PvP podcast series</a>, where the authors of the comics Penny Arcade and PvP come together (one for the first time) to play DnD, and you can hear their game-playing session in a series of podcasts (and a second set, airing now, with Wil Wheaton added in the mix). This is my first real experience to DnD, which is something I've always wanted to do but have never really been able to. <b>If anyone knows of local DMs / local game stores or whatnot please tell me, 'cause I'm interested in a game</b>.</li>
<li>Spring break was supposed to be my time to catch up on everything as well as recover from my crazy life at school. Those two goals are somewhat at odds with each other. What have I done so far? Done all my family's taxes, started looking into the investments my grandparents gave me when I was boring (there's some spare money that snuck out of portfolios which I want to reinvest), traveled up to DC, did some homework, am slowly working on closing all my Safari tabs (current count: 30, down from 50), am choosing next semester's courses (see below). Still need to do lots more homework, reply to a bajillion emails, etc.</li>
<li>Saw <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1068646/"">Entre les murs (The Class)</a>, the new French film. Won the Palme d'Or (first French film in 21 years to do so) at Cannes, already nominated for ""Best Foreign Film"" at next year's Oscars, and a really good film about a teacher of kids in a racially-mixed Paris middle school. Semi-autobiographical, based on a book (the main character, the teacher, is the writer of the book), the other kids and teachers are actual kids and teachers. </li>
<li>While it is totally awesome that my grandmother has wireless internet, her Verizon DSL modem + wireless router is pretty bad. Its built-in DNS server is pretty screwed up, and prevented me from doing my 431 DNS-sniffing assignment easily because it just flat out ignores NS and MX DNS requests and has set this lovely ""domain_not_set.invalid"" search domain automatically for me which screws with external DNS requests. The rest of the router isn't particularly better--it only does WEP encryption wirelessly, and frankly, the Internet acts a little funky but I don't want to try upgrading firmware and messing with DNS in case something horribly breaks. </li>
<li>I do like my job with ResNET a lot--I really truly helping people with their computers. I've also helped out a few of the OAs, RAs, and the CD, and I keep the printer well-stocked, so as a result the Cobb Housing staff likes me too, which is great. I do my job well and offer useful suggestions, so ResNET management likes me. Good situation all around.</li>
</ul>

Seems like a good list for right now. I really should post these as I think of them and not in long lists, but I'm working on it. 

I use <a href=""http://twitter.com/macmaxbh"">twitter</a>, linked with my facebook status, as a mini-blogging / announcement platform (which you can also see on my <a href=""http://www.unc.edu/~macmaxbh/"">website</a>, which is newly redesigned with better colors!). 

So, my current tentative / hopeful schedule for next semester:
COMP 530 Operating Systems (MWF 2:00-3:15, Jeffay, 4 credit hours)
COMP 550 Algorithm Analysis (TR 11:00-12:15pm, Lin, 3 credit hours)
HNRS 325 Dunlevie Honors Junior Colloquium (W 6:30-9:00pm, Kendall, 1 credit hour)
<del>PHYS 116 Mechanics (TR 8:00-9:15am + lab + recitation TBD, Karwowski, 4 credit hours)</del> (has turned back into ""staff"", and told I couldn't get into it anyway by Maggie)
Possibly replaced with: MATH 547 Linear Algebra for Applications (MWF 9:00-9:50am Adalsteinsson)
FREN 300 Review Grammar and Composition (<del>MWF 9:00-9:50am Jarausch or</del> (if I take 547) TR 12:30-1:45pm Noblitt, 3 credit hours)

At first I was looking at a fifth course, but it conflicts with OS, and then I was wondering ""should I really only take four real courses""? Frankly, I've always taken five but OS is going to be killer, Algorithms will be hard but great, and Mechanics will probably be hard/time-consuming but great, so I think I can keep myself busy, and I'll still have 15 credit hours. :)

I finally sprung for PickAProf because I was trying to determine whether any of the Math teachers are any good. If the teachers for MATH 547 (Rozansky, Adalsteinsson), MATH 566 (Mitran), STOR 435 (Ji) or STOR 455 (Sen) are particuarly good, let me know and I might switch out French. Karwowski is supposed to be really good, so I'll stop putting off Physics."

<li>BOOK SALE!!!! I'm going in just about half an hour to the fourth day of the annual Wake County Public Library Booksale. Let me just quote from their <a href=""http://www.wakegov.com/libraries/events/booksale/booksale.htm"">website</a>: ""More than 300,000 books will be available for sale in the largest sale of its kind in the Southeast."". THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND BOOKS! FOR REALLY CHEAP! It's one of the most amazing things in the world, and is where a lot of my (and my family's) book collection came from. I HIGHLY recommend going if you're in the area (today: $2 hardback, 50 cents paperback, tomorrow $5 box and $2 bag), and if not, stick it on your calendar for next year. :) [edit: Actually, I'm not sure I've been to it in several years. I frankly don't know why, probably exam or homework concerns, but I am totally going this year. :) ]
</li>

<li>I've had <a href=""http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/27650743/"">this link</a> open for a while (thanks <lj user=""yuki_no_oukami"">!), and think it's one of the best defenses of gay marriage I have ever read, from Keith Olbermann (the MSNBC anchor). If you haven't already read it, it's pretty powerful stuff. The <a href=""http://wilwheaton.typepad.com/wwdnbackup/2008/11/californians-vo.html"">YouTube videos</a> Wil Wheaton posted on WWdN are also quite good. Frankly, I feel like this election (specifically: Obama, the black man*, winning the election by a landside**, yet gay marriage was outlawed by constitutional amendment in what I think as the most liberal state in the nation) shows that black/white racism has ceased to be the great civil rights issue in America. (Am I saying racism doesn't exist? No. etc. etc.) and I think that torch has passed to gay rights. Frankly, looking at Prop 8 etc. etc., I don't know if this will be my generation's issue, because I frankly don't know if America as a whole can handle gays anytime soon. This makes me very sad. </li>
</ul>


* Really people, he's half African and half Kansas-ian. I have doubts about him being ""African-American"" (especially culturally), which is a very different thing from being an American with a directly African parent. Don't get me wrong, I think it's a great step forward, but I frankly think he's not an example of an African-American becoming president, he's an example of a black man becoming president. Perhaps I'm just arguing semantics here or just have no idea what I'm talking about, as a totally Caucasian person.

** Frankly people: I don't care what you say, 53% to 46% is only a 7% difference. For elections, this is very decisive, but a freaking 58 million people voted for McCain. That's not a ""landslide"" victory for Obama, a whole lotta people in this nation voted for McCain."

Isn't that horrible?

<a href=""http://www.betalogue.com/2008/11/13/adobe-cs4-installer/"">This</a> is a blog post about Adobe's horrible Mac installer. This is an excellent example of things that Mac users care about (at least to some extent) which other people probably think is totally crazy. One of the things I hated about the Zimbra Mac Client was a HORRIBLE JAVA INSTALLER WHICH TOTALLY EMULATED A WINDOWS INSTALLER AND WAS THE MOST DISGUSTING THING I HAVE EVER SEEN ON MY MAC AND INSTALLED ZIMBRA IN MY HOME DIRECTORY WHICH IS TOTALLY OFF LIMITS TO APPS!

Okay, I'm better now. You all must think I'm crazy.

I am way too busy and should be doing homework now. Also I was really angry today regarding incompetent management of the UNC passport drive (not the government, the government was totally efficient. the university, specifically, university photo's role). I am not going to detail because I've already ranted at two or three people about this and I now have better things to do with my life."

"event","So here are random news snippets and thoughts I've had over the past few weeks. It's getting quite long! I am majorly neglecting this place. 

<ul>
<li>It snowed a bit today! As someone who has not seen snow in a while (who lives in the South), it was very exciting. Sadly, the ground is too warm and it melted away.</li>
<li>I went to a Wizard Rock concert last night at <a href=""http://camelot-treasures.com/"">Camelot Treasures</a>. It was a lot of fun and we got to hear The Remus Lupins (aka the Wizard Rock Heart-Throb Alex Carpenter) who came from California! He had some good music, and seemed surprised at how excited we were and how we knew every single one of the <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/blibberinghumdingers"">Blibbering Humdingers</a> and <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/hawthornandholly"">Hawthorn and Holly</a>'s songs (the local wizard rock bands). I was the only male in the audience (besides Bryson) for the majority of the performance, which is a bit bizarre (I do things like French + wizard rock which are 'female-heavy' but also things like CS + Dutch which are 'male-heavy.) I still want <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/ministryofmagicmusic"">The Ministry of Magic</a> to come down (they're my favorite wizard rock band), but they probably won't.</li>
<li>Had a midterm today in my COMP 411 class which I probably didn't study ""enough"" for. I think I still did well, but probably not as good as my first midterm (which I actually got a perfect score (!!) on). The first question (which asked about whether the given addition of twos complement numbers would cause an overflow) threw me for a loop because I kept thinking about the numbers as floating-point and not twos-complement numbers. For example: <tt>0x8000000</tt> is the most negative number you can represent in twos complement (-2^31), which if you add negative numbers to it will definitely overflow, while <tt>0x80000000</tt> in floating-point is actually ""negative zero"", which you can obviously add negative numbers to it without it overflowing. My brain took a couple of tries to sort that all out but I think I did. I really like that class and am sad it's ending soon.</li>
<li>I got my hair cut! It is now shorter (a standard male haircut location wise, with the hair itself longer than a standard male haircut). To compare, <a href=""http://www.new.facebook.com/photo.php?pid=30146063&l=1e6fd&id=1403850054"">here</a> is a photo of me before the haircut and <a href=""http://www.new.facebook.com/photo.php?pid=30146064&l=388e0&id=1403850054"">here</a> is a photo I just took. I realized after getting my hair cut that my inner self-image of myself I think always has hair of more this length. One of my classmates said ""You don't have mad scientist hair anymore!"" and I think that describes my old hair pretty accurately. :)</li>
<li><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Gridlock-Economy-Ownership-Markets-Innovation/dp/0465029167/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1227042549&sr=8-1"">The Gridlock Economy</a> is a very good book, the best non-fiction book I've read in a very long time. It's basically about the ""tragedy of the anticommons"". For those who do not know economics, the ""tragedy of the commons"" is basically that if nobody owns a given resource then there's a tendency for that resource to be overused--e.g. overgrazed land (the town commons where everyone would let their sheep graze), overfished water (if nobody owns the water, everyone'll try to fish as much as they can). The classic econ answer to a ""tragedy of the commons"" problem is ""privatize the resource or institute government control"", but this book points out that you can go too far with private ownership. If a resource has too many owners, then it will be <b>underused</b>, to take an example, medical patents. If a drug you want to create would involve several patented structures / would need to be tested using patented structures, you have to reach agreements with EVERY SINGLE ONE of the patent holders to bring the drug to market, which is prohibitively expensive, even if all the patent holders are agreeable, easily known, and easily accessible. One of my favorite stories in the book was how Congress solved the problem of passenger air traffic. </li>
<li>I have now full administrator privileges on the (Executive Branch of) <a href=""http://studentorgs.unc.edu/studgov/"">Student Government website</a>. Basically, I offered to fix some broken links for him, and Mac, the current webmaster (a senior CS major and a fellow ACMer), wants me to take up the mantle of webmaster (or ""Chief Information Officer"") when he graduates. I've been tinkering around with the site, fixing the aforementioned links, changing a few minor features, updating pages, cleaning up some rather disgusting HTML (Microsoft Word-generated HTML should be shot, by the way), getting the pages to XHTML and CSS validate. For an example of the horrible HTML, look <a href=""http://www.unc.edu/~macmaxbh/oldexternalappointments.html"">here</a>. Note not just the HORRIBLE word HTML, but the fact that the ""first"" list is actually a SERIES of ONE ITEM BULLETED LISTS, instead of one list with multiple bullets, and how <em>worse of all</em> the second list is NOT ACTUALLY A LIST AT ALL, but a UNICODE BULLET SYMBOL and then the bullet text. The fixed (and condensed page) is <a href=""http://studentorgs.unc.edu/studgov/index.php/external-appts"">here</a>--note the bulleted list, just like the one being used in this blog post! This has been fun and has been taking up some of my spare time but I don't mind. </li>
<li>Thanksgiving is coming up! I am making arrangements with friends now to make sure I see them over break, especially if they are just visiting for Thanksgiving.</li>
<li>AAAH EXAMS ARE ALMOST HERE?!!?! Also, all my exams are on the last two days and need to be moved.</li>
<li>ARG I HAVE FINAL ASSIGNMENTS! I have (as of now): a comp 416 assignment (worth 3x all our other assignments. Doesn't look too tough, fortantely), a Dutch paper (which I can do, just need to set aside the time), and a final paper for my English class (five to seven pages! I know that's short in the realm of REAL HUMANITIES classes, but it'll be the longest paper I've ever written. I need to start on it so I can write it gradually and revise it!). Guess what I'll be doing over Thanksgiving when not seeing family + friends?</li>
<li>I like my classes and am sad to see most of them end! Maybe not MATH 381, but I find the material somewhat interesting, it's the class itself I don't like. I really like my computer hardware / organization class (COMP 411), my sci-fi class (ENGL 146), the web programming class (COMP 416) is interesting and useful with a very good teacher (we learned AJAX yesterday! I was waiting all semester for that...), and Dutch is a fun class, just not such a fun experience when trying to read books in Dutch or assemble coherent and grammatically correct sentences. </li>
<li>Next semester's classes are also very cool, as you can see on my <a href=""http://www.unc.edu/~macmaxbh/2009_spring.html"">schedule</a>. I'm excited about internet services and protocols (learn how the INTERNET actually works in detail!), more web programming (Java servlets! Server side stuff! Crazy!), and to a lesser extent honors differential equations (should be interesting, giving the math department here another shot, and I need it to take Numerical Analysis which I want to take again!), honors macroecon (the teacher is apparently REALLY good and everything happening now should be great fodder for class discussion), and Dutch (last semester, which is a little sad! perhaps I will be able to assemble coherent sentences? We will be doing a one-semester overview of Dutch literature, which seems very neat). </li>
<li> I really like being on the Student Technology Advisory Board and on the Technology and Web Services committee of Student Government--besides that I like talking about tech stuff, I can talk about tech stuff that actually directly will affect me and other students at UNC! In STAB, I can ask ITS (our IT services) 'why are things done like this?' and I'll get an answer, and they ask us what students would think of their new ideas. In both committees, we get to find out about what's coming to UNC tech-wise in the future and help influence its development. In Tech and Web, we support students (for example, with their new Joomla! websites for their student organizations) while also attempting to lobby for changes we'd like to see (better email, more use of SLICE, etc). This stuff is way cool, and I love it! </li>
<li>Related to that, this is basically why I am reluctant to study abroad. Frankly, there are so many cool things to do at UNC and so many cool things to be involved with that I'm not going to get them all done anyway, and if I left I'd have to give up some of them and I'd lose some opportunities to do things like be on these committees, be in ResNET, etc. etc. I know it'd be an awesome experience for me, but still, I'd have to give up a lot.</li>
<li>I Geek-A-Thonned this weekend (well, it was a mini-geek-a-thon). It was fun, I was able to take the bus there (Triangle Transit goes from UNC / South Road to 2/3 a mile from Kramden) and meet some new people and see some old ones. Mainly, though, there were new people who I didn't know and I was doing final testing, which (despite being new to me) wasn't exactly what I wanted. It was still neat. Got my thumb gashed by accident (oddly enough!)</li>
<li>I hope I am not an arrogant person, especially / including academically. This was going to become a whole other LJ post, but it gets condensed into this little list item.</li>
<li> I've been doing quite a bit of personal computer consulting at Carolina Meadows (my grandparent's retirement community), which is fun and actually surprisingly lucrative (since I get paid actual money!) on Fridays. This is mainly fun, and hopefully I am useful to people and not overcharging etc. etc. (I think I am, and I am not, respectively, I'm just not used to semi-constant demand and actually being paid). I probably should start recording all the money I get so I can pay taxes on it, make it a bit more official. </li>
<li>I upgraded the old iBook of the Carolina Meadows Mac Club (which is basically on permanent loan on me, since the club doesn't need it as their new presenter brings her own laptop and the person who primarily bought and used it is actually dead now) by maxing out the RAM (from 128mb to 1.128 GB), adding an AirPort card, and upgrading the OS (from OS X 10.3 to 10.4, which is the newest it can handle). I'm considering using it as my more 'portable' laptop, since it's lighter, more expendable, and decently powered for my uses with the upgrades. I used it to study for my COMP 411 test (above) on the way to the wizard rock concert (also above). </li>
<li> I'm considering buying a netbook (or more specifically, an <a href=""http://www.laptop.org/en/"">OLPC</a> XO-1 through the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/xo"">buy one get one program</a>) that I can carry around with me, take notes on, surf the web, etc. A person I know through STAB (see above) has an OLPC laptop which I am borrowing to try it out. </li>
</ul>

That's all I can think of right now. That's a lot of typing. :)

"event","Hello, faithful readers. I bring you news from the World of Max. 

My cell phone is in the process of breaking. I've had a Sony Ericsson Z520a phone once I accidentally washed my first cell phone (a very basic LG model) in the beginning of my junior year (just about three years ago). My Z520a was replaced several times throughout my time in high school due to the fact that it kept breaking (and the replacement phone I got shipped quickly became defective) but for the past two years I've had excellent luck with my phone--it's been dropped more times then I can count and stuffed into my pants pocket daily, and until now it's worked perfectly. But as of a few days ago, the main screen seems to have been damaged--sometimes when I open the phone it just displays as a blank white screen, other times it displays my screen at an ""offset"", which causes it to flicker rapidly like a bad TV signal, sometimes it works perfectly (especially if I don't open it all the way). The outer screen works, which makes the phone perfectly functional for receiving calls.

I decided, after talking to my parents, it was time for a new phone. I am extremely satisfied with my phone--its interface is decent, its Bluetooth connection (more rare in those days) allows me to sync my contacts and calendars through Apple's iSync software and transfer ringtones and pictures back and forth, and my phone did not try to be anything other then a phone. My phone is quad-band, meaning that I can use it in Europe, and was eventually unlocked, meaning I can put European SIM cards in it and get European phone numbers instead of paying AT&T outrageous rates.

I then started to look on AT&T's website for a new phone. These were my major criteria:

a) Must be a quad-band phone, as I will most likely use this abroad.
b) Must be able to sync with my computer via iSync, which basically requires that it have an uncrippled Bluetooth implementation and built-in support in iSync or a plug-in written that'll play it.
c) Must NOT have a keyboard. I want a phone, not a device to write text messages and emails. 

The above criteria, especially the second, were surprisingly hard to meet. I made a list of the phones meeting criteria a and c, then checked the phones for iSync support on a series of four websites (the official Apple website, three iSync plugin websites). What I discovered was that all LG phones and Samsung phones were out of the running--none of them can be synced with iSync. (Technically, a few Samsung models can be synced, but no ""A"" model phones, which are all the AT&T phones), and newer Motorola phones were spotty. 

I picked out the phones that seemed to meet my criteria--the Nokia 6085, the Nokia 6555, the Sony Ericsson W580i, the Sony Ericsson z750a, the MotoRAZR v3xx, and the MotoRAZR2 v9 Mahogany. (Note: yes, I'm a Mac fanboi, but the iPhone's required data plan is way too expensive, and I'm using my dad's iPod Touch here, and with the university's omnipresent wireless it's an excellent substitute)

Reading through the CNET reviews for the phones, I found myself pretty unimpressed with the phones. The 6085 seemed extremely basic and there were many complaints on Amazon about it, the 6555 apparently has next-to-nil battery life, the W580i focuses on being a music player (my iPod plays my music much better, thankyouverymuch), the z750a seems less functional then my current phone, and I was unimpressed by the MotoRAZR. The V9 Mahogany was okay, but expensive. There are only unofficial plug-ins to get it to work with iSync, and I'm a bit skeptical of the ""slider"" design.

So I tried a different tact--looking on CNET's site for their highest-rating phones, then seeing if they were available, and I stumbled upon the Nokia N95, an unlocked phone basically imported from Europe/Asia, where their phones are much more impressive. Since I want to remain with AT&T, a GSM network, I could buy an unlocked phone and put in my AT&T SIM card, instead of being stuck only with AT&T branded phones. The main disadvantage of this process, besides not getting all my support from AT&T, is that AT&T's phones are subsidized since I'd need to sign a new two-year agreement with them, so bascially unlocked phones are really expensive. The N95 has everything I'd ever want in a phone as well as a good camera, GPS, Wi-Fi access and media player, and costs just around five hundred dollars, if not more. I just want a *phone* that can work around the world and can connect to my computer--is that too much to ask? (Apparently if you ask Sony Ericsson, the answer is no. They make walkman-phones and still camera-phones and stylish-phones, but there's no replacement for my z520a).

I then surfed around on Amazon's cell phone store, in their selection of unlocked phones. Sorting by both ""high reviews"" and ""best-selling"" turned up another phone, the Nokia E51. As I looked more and more at the Nokia E51, it seemed like a good choice. It definitely has a lot of features--quad band, unlocked, Bluetooth, iSync, 2 MP camera, MP3/video player, expandable memory, and most interestingly Wi-Fi, but it's still very clearly a phone and not a phone-still camera or a phone-iPod or a Blackberry, like most of the other phones I was looking at. The reviews are extremely positive, and for a unlocked phone with that many features, it's pretty cheap (costs $260 at Amazon, which is after a 33% discount). The more I looked at the E51, the more I liked it. It has Wi-Fi, meaning that I can actually surf the web on my phone without paying through the nose to AT&T, and I could even download VoIP software so I can call via Skype / Wi-Fi, in cases when I don't have cell phone reception or internationally, where Skype is cheaper, and it seems like a solid, full-featured phone.

I wanted to show my findings to my dad and ask him for advice, but he hasn't been answering his cell phone. Thinking about it a bit more, I realize that the phone still is quite expensive (a holiday present, perhaps?), and that if I had to choose another phone, the Nokia 6085 would probably be it--it's a solid phone with the features I wanted, and it's free after signing a new contract (and we're not planning to move from AT&T anytime soon, everyone else in my family is on contract with them after getting new phones). 

Perhaps I'm putting too much emphasis into those reviews and thinking of them too negatively, and perhaps having an expensive phone is a bad idea (in case I drop it and break it). Time will see, and I'm sure my dad will give me some good advice. Advice from you faithful readers is also welcome!

[edit: After discussing with my dad, I bought the E51 from Amazon. It's in the mail...]"

"event","Word, so I want to write about lots stuff, but right now you just get this note about my computers:

I have acquired two six-year-old iMacs (400mhz G3s). I am trying to figure out a use for them. 

My old PowerBook's battery seems to have given up the ghost and refuses to charge at all. Reading online, it sounds like it went into a ""deep discharge"" state because I left it uncharged for this whole summer and I need to buy a new one if I want to use the machine without keeping the power plug in, which can be difficult due to the bent nature of the case around the power plug. That's $129. Might be worth it for a pretty nice PowerBook. I'm considering adding an El Gato TV tuner stick and make it into a faux-TiVo, a foldable TV, since I get free cable in my dorm room. That costs $150, or $100 if I get the older model. There's also the chance my power adapter is not-fully-connected or somewhat screwed up, so I should try other power adapters first. Or try the battery in another PowerBook (if I had one), or reset the power management unit.

I upgraded the memory on my MacBook Pro to 4GB, its max. Yay!

I also have gotten (on loan) an old iBook (12"", it's tiny). I thought ""iBook, decent computer, could use it as a note-taking device since it's much lighter then my MacBook Pro, although I should probably just lend it to my sister's boyfriend since he's without a computer that's not totally depressing"". 

So it's the original model of an iBook G4. It has a grand total of 128MB of RAM (built-in). And no wireless card.

The second part threw me for a loop--a <i>laptop</i>. Without a wireless card. Like a somewhat recent one, too (from 2004). 

I can add a wireless card (b/g) for $49, and stick in another GB of RAM for another $40. With those two additions, it'd actually be a decent computer, if a bit slow, but nice and tiny. I'll probably do that.

But a LAPTOP. Without a wireless card. I mean really, people? 

I got some money today by helping an old lady connect to the Internet--she moved to my grandparent's retirement home and had to reconfigure her DSL. She didn't know the password on the account so I had to call AT&T support and get it reset. I probably could have asked her for more money, but frankly, I'd do this sorta stuff for free--I don't really feel like I need payment, and I already raised my rates slightly from what I used to change. I'm sure it's half or a tenth of what people in the business actually charge. 

I bought a mini-DVI to VGA adapter cable for my dad, and a copy of Final Cut Express that actually is a Universal binary and doesn't give spurious error messages when launched on an Intel Mac. Yay?"

"event","I am officially IN Tyler Curtain's ENGL 146 (Fantasy / Sci-Fi / Utopia)!

I was waiting on the wait list since registration quite a few months ago (#7, which dropped to #5 after a while), then on Friday I got sent a form email from the registrar giving basic policies, and mentioning something about wait lists being purged at some point. I had been on studentcentral earlier that day or so and I was #3, then went back after the form email and noticed they had dropped the whole wait-list. So of course I immeditely add myself back on the wait-list (for some reason they just dropped everyone but didn't actually disable the list itself), and I was #1. I checked again today and I AM IN THE CLASS! Oh snap... :)


This was the major piece of uncertainty that I've had regarding next semester, and now it's gone."

"event","I have posts written from France that all I need to do is post, but due to summer I've been lazy and haven't posted them yet. I also have a long list of interesting weblinks I discovered while catching up from the summer I want to share and have carefully bookmarked on delicious, a list of things I still haven't read on instapaper, a really messy room, lots of things to reply to on Facebook, and of course dealing with school. 

But in making this post, I am at least starting to deal with things. I have accomplished minor things:

a) Today I put away a lot of my clothes, which involved sorting things and deciding I really don't need my old socks and underwear anymore. I still need to sort through my shirts, which are excessive.

b) I began cataloging all the books in my room before I left, which also involved putting ones I'm never going to read (again or at all) in a box to be donated. I hope I can finish this before I go.

c) I bought my dad a new computer. Related to this: He got a free iPod Touch due to the education promotion, which he says he'll give to me because I can use it at school. The iPod is actually a very neat little device, I've already downloaded quite a few apps for it (including buying Cro-Mag Rally, and I'm planning on buying Enigmo as well. Pangea makes good games). Also related to this: All my family's computers are getting RAM upgrades, because we're upgrading the RAM in his new computer (buying directly through Apple is bad because they gouge the price) and we already promised my mom more RAM. Thus, my Macbook Pro is now humming along on 4GB, as is my mom's computer, and my dad's computer (when it comes), and I have the 2GB from my computer to put in my sister's MacBook, because her machine (the first generation of Macbook with the Intel Core Duo chip) can only handle 2GB. Basically, all our machines will be maxed out with RAM.

d) I bought new shoes today, which I should have done before I left for France. I hate buying shoes, because they never feel right and I want to get THE right shoe, which doesn't exist, probably. I'm used to really really loose shoes, so tight shoes feel uncomfortable to me but are probably much better for my feet. My new pair of shoes is white, a change for me.

e) I've replied to a few things on Facebook, and read through many many things on the Internet to get to this point, then successfully managed to file them all away on Delicious and Instapaper instead of having sixty browser tabs open all the time.

f) I've read fun books from the library. Reading for fun is a remarkably...fun... thing. I'm catching up on new Star Wars books, re-read a few Patricia C Wrede books, read an Angel book, and am now reading the Dresden Files series, which is actually quite good. Odd story, I started reading them due to a few recommendations I saw online, and then when I went to the beach with my whole family I found my sister and Bryson were actually reading the same book in the same series at the same time as me, completely independently. Very bizarre, in a cool way.

g) I've met up with a few people over break, although I also need to contact a few more. Hanging out with friends is fun but somewhat hard to plan (requires taking social initiative), which is why it was extremely nice of Noura to be extremely forceful and arrange many events together. I managed to catch Brendan before he left, which was extremely fun, since we rarely get to hang out and catch up nowadays. 

Okay, so posts which should be coming in the near future:
a) Which D&D Character are You? (this post was originally the intro to that but ballooned into this)
b) How is France? Addendum
c) Europe / American comparisons (probably incomplete, but better than nothing)
d) Review of TV shows I watched last year and greatly enjoyed.
e) What I've been spending my money on this summer and why it's all awesome"

by Josh Shaffer, Staff Writer
RALEIGH-In a bizarre election-night turn, Stan Morse won the Democratic primary for state House District 40 despite endorsing, campaigning for and voting for his opponent.
A recruiter and consultant to the printing industry, Morse took 54.2 percent of the vote to Sam Hart Brewer's 45.8 percent. This happened despite Morse submitting a concession speech a day before the election and spending Tuesday outside a Raleigh polling place encouraging voters to pick Brewer.

<blockquote>
Kritiek

It is equally important or even more so to be able to offer criticism in an acceptable manner. Bear in mind that the Dutch are quite direct and will voice their criticism quite openly. Don't take it personally or think that they are being rude.

<b>Dat lijkt me geen goed idee.</b>
I don't think that's a good idea.

<b>Dat is onzin!</b>
That is nonsense!

<b> Dat lijkt nergens op.</b>
That looks terrible.

<b> Je lijkt wel zwanger in die jurk.</b>
You look pregnant in that dress.

<b> Je hebt wel veel komma's in je tekst.</b>
You do have quite a lot of commas in your text.

<b>Je komt altijd te laat!</b>
You're always late!

(there's another section, about how to give criticism with suggestions to make them seem less horrible, but I don't feel like typing it. Also, it's not as funny)

"event","I read ""<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month"">The Mythical Man-Month</a>"" today, a pretty famous series of essays written in 1975 on software engineering by Fred Brooks, who <a href=""http://www.cs.unc.edu/People/Faculty/Bios/brooks.html"">founded the School of Computer Science here at UNC</a> and <a href=""http://www.cs.unc.edu/~brooks/"">still can be found here</a>! (I didn't realize that until just a minute ago!)
[edit: In fact, the new computer science addition / building is called the Frederick P. Brooks Jr. Computer Science building, which is very neat. Thanks to Ben + Hedlund for telling me this]

I read the 1975 version--parts of it are a bit archaic, but the core ideas are still just as viable now as they were over thirty years ago. 

The direct reason I decided to read this book now is due to its inclusion on a <a href=""http://www.bookpool.com/ct/101"">list</a> of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua_Bloch"">Joshua Bloch</a>'s favorite books. Joshua Bloch is quickly becoming a slight role model of mine--he led the development of many features of Java, including the Collections API, things I use every time I write a program. His book ""Effective Java"", a textbook for my current computer-science course, is chock-full of useful tidbits in writing Java programs useful to intermediate and advanced programmers (unlike many ""how-to"" books). 

The core idea of this book is Brooks's Law: <i>Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later</i>. Throughout the book, Brooks explains how to correctly structure software projects.

There's a section called ""The Joys of the Craft"" which perfectly describes why I love programming, in better detail then I've ever managed to do so, which I quote below (found on <a href=""http://www.davar.net/PROGRAM/EXTRACTS/CRAFTJOY.HTM"">this</a> website. I do hope I'm not being a copyright infringer):
<blockquote>
The  Joys  of  the  Craft

Frederic Brooks, Jr.
Why is programming fun?  What delights may its practitioner expect as his reward?

First is the sheer joy of making things.  As the child delights in his mud pie, so the adult enjoys building things, especially things of his own design.  I think this delight must be an image of God's delight in making things, a delight shown in the distinctness and newness of each leaf and each snowflake.

Second is the pleasure of making things that are useful to other people.  Deep within, we want others to use our work and to find it helpful.  In this respect the programming system is not essentially different from the child's first clay pencil holder ""for Daddy's office.""

Third is the fascination of fashioning complex puzzle-like objects of interlocking moving parts and watching them work in subtle cycles, playing out the consequences of principles built in from the beginning.  The programmed computer has all the fascination of the pinball machine or the jukebox mechanism, carried to the ultimate.

Fourth is the joy of always learning, which springs from the nonrepeating nature of the task.  In one way or another the problem is ever new, and its solver learns something: sometimes practical, sometimes theoretical, and sometimes both.

Finally, there is the delight of working in such a tractable medium.  The programmer, like the poet, works only slightly removed from pure thought-stuff.  He builds his castles in the air, from air, creating by exertion of the imagination.  Few media of creation are so flexible, so easy to polish and rework, so readily capable of realizing grand conceptual structures.  (As we shall see later, this very tractability has its own problems.)

Yet the program construct, unlike the poet's words, is real in the sense that it moves and works, producing visible outputs separate from the construct itself.  It prints results, draws pictures, produces sounds, moves arms.  The magic of myth and legend has come true in our time.  One types the correct incantation on a keyboard, and a display screen comes to life, showing things that never were nor could be.

Programming then is fun because it gratifies creative longings built deep within us and delights sensibilities we have in common with all men.
</blockquote>

Amazing words, and incredibly true.

[edit: For fairness, yes, there is also the <a href=""http://www.davar.net/PROGRAM/EXTRACTS/CRAFTWOE.HTM"">Woes of the Craft</a> for those things that programming doesn't do as well, but I was being positive in this post, okay? Here's a bit of balance, though.]"

"event","So everyone in my in my network (for math/cs people read ""graph"") first year seminar is doing an independent study that relates to networks in some manner.

My idea was to study the UNC computer network--see how it's set up, if there are weak points, etc. ITS is currently deciding how much information on the networks here are public and what they can give me, but they did give me a link to their main page:
http://its.unc.edu/netcomm/index.php
which has a lot of neat stuff on it (mostly ONYEN-protected, which means sorry non-UNC students).

Two interesting links so far are:
https://control-center.unc.edu/network/wireless_report.html
This lists every single wireless access point on campus and tells how much data it's transferred, how many users have connected to it, and how many simulataneous users it's had in the past 24 hours. For example, I know that there's a wireless access point in Odum Village that transferred 74798.85 MB yesterday (that's 73 GB!). The next-highest WAP is one that served about 10GB, also in Odum Village. (a sidenote: apparently Odum Village is ONLY served by wireless, there is no Ethernet, unlike the rest of campus, which is one reason why their bandwidth numbers are so high)

https://cacti.unc.edu/ 
gives an overview of how the UNC network is set up (and it's amazing how tiny a portion of the graph ResNET, or all the dorms, are. Perhaps it's not to scale, but still...) and gives you access to lots of cool links.

Also, I learned that UNC has a 600Mb/sec link to the ""commodity internet"" (read internet), which is 75MB/sec, pretty speedy.

Also, on that site there's a blocklist that you can search, which shows everyone who's currently locked out of the UNC network, which is interesting (also mostly incomprehensible due to a lack of explanation)."

4) Applied math vs abstract math vs computer science

"event","My computer broke again (the brand-spanking new internal hard drive installed last month is failing. Or perhaps it's just the drive connection, which is what I'm hoping since the new drive failing seems quite odd) on Tuesday.

This made my thanksgiving vacation a lot less happy then it could have been.

Tomorrow morning my computer is going in for repair and I'm testing to make sure I have my backup, which is a manner in which there is some doubt. If I don't, I may try some more last-ditch repair efforts before I turn in the computer.

There are eight days of class left. All my classes have decided this is a good time for
a) final projects
b) final exams (before finals, of course)
c) final papers

This makes me sad.

Thanksgiving was a strange mix of good and bad. Lots of good, some craziness.

I need to buy presents for everyone, especially my relatives who celebrate Hanukkah (which starts in a week. my presents will be late, but they're always late, so...)."

"event","So I am running Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard, which is exciting. Details are probably forthcoming.

However, this is a screenshot of my desktop. It's actually really lovely, I think--the transparent menubar and the 3d dock are actually really well-done, in my opinion. I know a lot of people hate them, but to me it actually looks really nice. Do you agree?

I am quite excited. The following things are being shipped to me:

Mac OS X 10.5, Leopard (5-user family pack edition), which will arrive tomorrow!

The book ""Head First Design Patterns"" on object-oriented design patterns, which I feel like I should definitely learn as we are starting to a bunch of design in my computer science class, because I really like Head First books, and because the copy at NC State's library system will probably be checked out for the next year (it's out with six hold requests on it). Also, I bought it for $15 (including shipping), instead of the $45 it retails for. 

The poster which goes with the book Head First Design Patterns. Again cheap.

A poster detailing Java's class structures and the relationships between them. Droolworthy, and again very cheap. Where I'll put it I have no idea.

Finally, a book (at about a 90% discount) on ""The Best Software Writing"", a collection of software engineering essays that are wonderfully written. I sometimes read the editor's blog, and one of the people in the collection (I believe) is someone who's post on nerds greatly impressed me (which I will discuss later). 

So I ordered all but Leopard today, and my grand total was just under three dollars, because I had quite a bit of Amazon gift certificate credit which I used. 

I like when things are being shipped to me. 

I still need to buy several Java books (one for class next semester and whatnot), but four things today is enough for me. :)

(note: There's a bug in the ""delivered by"" for all the amazon orders, that's the ""ship"" date, not the ""deliver"" date. Leopard really will arrive tomorrow, the rest probably during Thanksgiving. :))"

Halloween is tonight. I'm planning on checking out Franklin, but I dunno how long I'll stay. Depends on whether I'm with people.

I'm trying out a new livejournal post widget; it seems nice so far. :)

I posted a link on my facebook to the intro video from mac os x leopard. it's very awesome, you should watch it. yes, you, even if you're not a Mac user. The link is:
http://media.arstechnica.com/video/leopard-intro.mov
The Ars Technica review of Leopard is amazing. If you're a Mac person, you NEED to read it. 

I just discovered the eye-fi SD Card at http://eye.fi , which looks really awesome. It's just like a memory card that you put in your camera (you don't need a special camera as long as it takes SD cards); except it has a wireless chip inside itself and will actually upload your photos to your computer / your favorite photo-sharing website when your camera is within range of a wireless signal; you don't have to do *anything*. Isn't that incredible? It could be used as a spy gadget, as a time-saver, as a live-event-coverage unit, automatic-photo-backup system, anything. It blows my mind."

More Old Kingdom Books to come, other news
 
I will be writing two more novels set in the Old Kingdom and Ancelstierre. They will be published by Allen & Unwin in Australia and by HarperCollins US and HarperCollins UK.
 
The first, probably out in 2010, will be Clariel: The Lost Abhorsen, which is the story of the young woman who eventually became Chlorr of the Mask. It takes place about 320 years before the events in Sabriel. The second is untitled, and is a sequel of sorts to Abhorsen, taking place several years later. It should be out in 2011. Both 2010 and 2011 seem like a long way away but no doubt will sneak up on me horribly when I least expect it. Sometimes I think time is a practitioner of the secret Welsh martial art of Llap-Goch.
 
Before those two Old Kingdom books I have to finish The Keys to the Kingdom (I'm nearly done with Superior Saturday, so just Lord Sunday after that) and there will also be a standalone science fiction novel, called A Confusion of Princes, which should be out in 2009.

This makes me extremely happy!"

"event","My dorm room is now wired.

This weekend I bought a five-port switch (eg: Ethernet switch, like a hub but better. basically, you get extra ports to plug Ethernet into), and used it to enhance my dorm room's wired connectivity. There are now Ethernet cords permanently next to the TV (when I plug in my computer to show YouTube movies), next to the couch (so I can lounge and surf at the same time), and two both me and my roommate's desks (because his Ethernet plug is behind the couch and routinely gets scrunched, he was worried it would kill the cord eventually). I'm debating whether to switch out the TV spot for a second spot on my desk, so I can plug my iMac in 24/7. 

Speaking of the couch, there's now an extension cord next to the couch (the outlets are also behind the couch and if anything gets plugged in, again, it's not healthy for the plug) using a special ""low-profile"" plug so that it doesn't get damaged by being behind the couch. 

What this means in practice is that I can now plug in my iPod / computer when I'm sitting on the couch to both power and Internet instead of relying on the somewhat fickle wireless (for my laptop) and the increasingly dead battery (for my iPod). 

Oh, and there's now a lamp next to my couch so that we now have plenty of light for reading on it. Very exciting.

And I feel very accomplished."

"event","So earlier this week the hard drive in my computer began failing. I carefully backed up all the files on my computers and got it repaired (now that's a whole other story, one that's not important right now). I have my computer back with a brand-new hard drive, and I went to start the restore from my backup. ""No Snapshots available"" said my backup program. I checked the backup file--instead of being about a hundred gigabytes, it was forty kilobytes. That means everything was gone. I checked the log file of my backup program from the ""date modified"" time of my backup file (three days ago). Yep, my backup program had automatically launched, cheerfully deleted my backup to do a ""recycle backup"", then I had come along and hit ""cancel"" on the backup since I already had a backup that I didn't want to change (at that point I think I hadn't turned in my computer yet for a repair, but the drive was definitely going).

To be a bit fair, I had set my computer to automatically recycle backups after a certain period of time had elapsed several years ago, and the system I was running was created several years ago as a copy of that old system. But still, letting the program automatically launch and cheerfully delete all my files strikes me as just wrong. 

So all my files are gone. Well, the school work from this year I saved elsewhere, my music is on my iPod, recent email is on email servers, but besides that it's all gone. All of my files--email from over ten years ago, files from my childhood, photos I've taken, it's just gone. Or, it's in byte form in the free space of my external hard drive, encoded in a proprietary Retrospect format, I assume.

This is a great opportunity. An opportunity to start anew from a hard drive always filled with clutter from years past, a new opportunity to reform my computer into precisely what I want it to, without lots of useless addons slowing it down. It's a good thing, something I wanted to do. But with all my old files saved, and right now.

So the way I've written it here makes it sound like I did something stupid. Of course I want to blame the software, but perhaps it is my fault (actually, it's probably nobody's fault! just a crazy coincidence that I couldn't have forseen and couldn't have planned for, and could easily not have happened!)

*sigh*

To all the homework I have to do"

moviesmoviesmovies!
the darjeeling limited was beautiful and everything i was hoping for. 
and the easy analysis: letting go of baggage is liberating.
the hard analysis: adrian brody. aka i would jump his bones. 

i had this dream a couple months ago. Actually it was terrifying, but not afterward, because it was silly. I was taking a pregnancy test, but on one side the stick was a toothbrush. and on the other side it was a pencil--the other half of the test was written.&nbsp; The trailer for Juno (http://www.foxsearchlight.com/juno/) reminded me. 

I am Alice in Wonderland for Halloween, and Super Nintendo, or maybe Supersized, when I am trying to be something super.

i thought that was pretty funny. especially gaymenistan. and youdon'tunderstandistan."

"event","so identity is confusing, yeah? 
today was the second time i've been interviewed here about being raised Baha'i for a friend's class. and while it was interesting to have a totally judgement-free space in which to talk about everything that meant, and it was one of the most candid discussions I've ever had... i don't know...
as soon as i got back to my computer there was a request.

For another interview. 

and this time it wasn't even for a religious studies class; the requirements were only that it be about someone with an interesting or unique quality. 

and it begs the question

what am i but a diversity statistic? 

(and then i thought...and realized that I am lots of things, so don't worry about that part)

but really, i don't know...this whole situation has got me....kafluffled and a bit upset...though still mainly happy

(the true irony is that i end up saying things like... 'Baha'is believe', and 'they think', and not 'to me' or 'i think'... and now that i've accepted that its never been what was really true to me, I can finally talk to people about it, and isn't that really one of those little things that is exactly why people are kind of funny&nbsp; and beautiful?)

but otherwise, things are nice. my latest project is going to explore light and rythym in http://www.koyaanisqatsi.org/ , and have a living machine (which is a fancy architect name for poop farm)

most important, on monday www.architectureforhumanity.com changed my life."

"event","I HAD to leave studio because there are certain trashbags who throw their political shit ALL over the place and will one day just end up designing horrible pretentious corporate architecture for companies that kill and cook baby chincillas. Thats ok, though, cause I'll just be chilling in the garden of my casita being beaten at dominos by an old Puerto Rican man smoking a pipe in a striped shirt. We will talk sustainability and green roofs, and when the douche finally realizes what a trash bag he really is, I'll just say ""hey, this is Miguel, have some dominoes and a fresh tomato."" And he will change forever. 
But before I left, I did manage to draw a picture of John Wayne saying ""Hello Sugar"" as thanks to Brad (aka thorn ""yeah, I'm pretty metal"") for letting me borrow his markers (which are prismacolors, but are still magic no matter what ANYONE says. 
I am coming home this weekend because if I don't I'm pretty sure I'll freak out permanently. Apparently my brother has aquired a drum set for his band Swoosh which is now my room. I'm excited to play with it."

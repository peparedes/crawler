"event","Why is it easier to hate than it is to love someone?
Are we conditioned in that way...
How can you hate someone before even loving them?
If there wasn't hate there before the love then is it probable or justified or even possible to hate?
Both have the same number of letters but when conveyed, but have a disproportionate level of feelings/hurt
There's always a yin to a yang they say
That thin swiveling, but ever-so distinct line between light and dark, love and hate...
How come whenever someone refers to love and hate...love always come first verbally and written?
Is that a sign as far as order goes?
But then again is there any order in this world (pun intended)
Love is as much a game as hate is
Think of it as Jeopardy 
Where you risk all that is dear to you 
No matter the odds
No matter the chances
You just go through all the symptoms of the risk
Your life plays before you
You have just jumped off a cliff
Plummeting into a world of unknown, of blackness
Where there can be something fluffy that can stop and cradle your fall
Or plummet into what you think is a never-ending abyss, but in reality you land on a spike
Piercing your heart and soul
Maybe I am exaggerating and maybe I'm not
But then you... 
Undergo sweaty palms
Nauseousness
Anxiety
Butterflies in your stomach
Quavering hands
God there is nothing like that feeling
Your luck can go either way
Work to your benefit 
Or not
Either way you put yourself out there
No turning back
Try not to get burned because if you do you can either learn to love or learn to hate
Which sometimes leads to the feeling: Hate to Love or the equivalent: Love to Hate
But keep in mind:
""It is better to have played the game and lost, than to have never played the game at all"" -The Vizion"

Like fire, you have a hot<br>temper and you can be warm and loving as well<br>and angry and wild. It all really comes down to<br>what you are feeling. You have a lot of close<br>friends who you are very protective over, and<br>with your temper probably some enemies too. You<br>are not Miss Popular in school since you are<br>your own person and don't want to be forced<br>into behaving this or that way. You are the<br>untamed wild horse, the kind that everyone<br>wants to catch. But you don't want to be tied<br>down for the moment and just keep going with<br>your little crushes. Your will is strong and if<br>you set your mind to do something, you will<br>most likely succeed. But beware, your friends<br>may not always accept your mood-swinging<br>behaviour. Even if you don't mean to be mean,<br>they can still feel hurt. You just need to<br>start thinking some things through before you<br>do them, and not always jump in with so much<br>courage. One day you may be hurt because of<br>that, but then again, your element isn't fire<br>if you start to analyse situations before you<br>act.

"event","No does not mean yes... 
Why confuse the two?
Yes is expressed in a different word in all languages
Si=Spanish and Italian
Ja=Dutch and German
Sim=Portuguese
Oui=French
Iae=Greek
Then there is the word no...
No is no as no is no 
The word is universal in all languages
So it was not a communication barrier
Maybe it was my kindness
Perhaps it was taken for weakness
I was not playing coy or begging on me knees to treat me as he did 
But I was approached as if I were welcoming it with a big banner, music, and balloons
Is it because I am a girl?
Do I appear that vulnerable to men and seem as though I need that hard rock by my side known as a ""MAN""?
Does having a man define me?
I am not a siamese twin that needs another being to sustain my existence being attached by vital organs
I am and can be separated as I did not come into this world from my mother's womb with my first intent to find a manly figure in my life...
Was it my personality or body language?
Did I send signals that said anything but what I intended for...NO...
Hmmmm I wonder why...why...why...???
Why did he lick his lips like I was something to eat?
Reminded me of the coyote in the desert waiting for the right moment to pounce the roadrunner as he was famished
He first raped me with the eyes
With every look I saw an article of clothing was being removed right then and there
My shoes...
My socks...
My pants...
My underwear...
My shirt...
(God No...)
My bra...

It's as if he was tearing not only my clothes away but my every being 
Until he reached my soul that bared all and was left so naked and helpless
A feeling of dread, hatred, and fear consumed me
Paralyzed me from head to toe
Each body part losing it's motor function 
One by one becoming immobile
Might as well have grabbed a rag drenched in chloroform and snatched me from behind
A quicker way to lose consciousness
But no it was the slower route
All I can think of is how much I appeared as a doe in headlights 
Not knowing what to do, where to turn, where to go...just completely dumbfounded
Bug-eyed staring at the headlights
Almost as mesmerized by the stream of lights as a moth would be
Pins and needles, pins and needles, pins and needles,
I'm falling...
Different levels of consciousness
Colors blending making different shadings and nuances of its original color
Falling...
Falling...
Falling...
Succumbing to the quicksand beneath me
Sinking into the depths of the earth

Suddenly I am yanked by my wrist back into reality 
The realm of hell
He beckons me closer
I don't want to go
But I am so weak
What did he slip in my drink?
Why am I tripping?
Why am I seeing things?
What's going on?!

I move involuntarily
Dammit!
Suddenly someone talks to him and he is looking another way
My only chance...
Access denied - caught

Kissing, touching, playing, groping to no end 
Unwelcomed, unappreciated, and unreal
Not again!
I refuse to let my white flag go up in surrender...because that's just not me
I decide to fight, but to no avail as what I think are hard hits are barely anything resembling blows
I have to get out of here
Run 
As far and as long as I can
What was I thinking going out with this kid last night?
He loses track of me for a second
I stagger away as fast as I can
Yes!
I never thought I would say this, but it felt damn good to get lost!
I order a coffee...something with caffeine to keep from losing myself.
It bought me sometime
Enough to escape

To think that if the word 'No' was heeded to, nothing would have happened
'No' does not mean 'yes'
Girls can never be too careful 
No matter their stature
Size
Muscle build
Speed
No one in this world is invincible
No one..."

"event","Today we salute you, Mr. Stressed Out College Student During Exam Week. As you sit in your lonely cubicle in the library, doped up on Starbucks & Aderol, you think to yourself, am I ever going to need to know this stuff in life? The distractions are tempting and you have suddenly diagnosed yourself with ADD along with advanced delusionary schizophrenia with involuntary narcissistic rage, Summer break is just days away, and your Prozac prescription will be in tomorrow.  So crack open an ice cold Bud Light after that last exam,  because for most of us, summer will be spent in rehab.

Damn right...there is nothing like school
Promises of an education, but really is there such thing?
I slowly, but surely believe that my IQ is declining...
I do strongly believe and advocate that, yes, all we needed to learn we learned in kindergarten
I mean seriously what's the point.
Sure logarithms are cool and the Greek alphabet is hot and fun to look at when tripping, but what the hell do we need it for?
It's not gonna help us cook or appreciate things for what they really are.
Knowledge is evil and once learned one can never go back....the ultimate point of no return
Da Da Dummmmm
But hey I guess someone has got to do it.
I need a drink....damn...that stuff...that gloriously fucked up liquid can get you in a world of trouble...
Especially when a Po-Po pulls your drunken behind over shining that godforsaken flashlight into your eyes blinding you
I still believe to this day the Po-Pos intent is too get you blinded so when he makes you walk that straight line your screwed for life
Then he slams you against that car so passionately to the point of being turned on...
Damn was that his baton or his (WhOa NoW;)
Spread 'em and of course I would be the consenting one...great role play and telling him a little lower...there that's the spot
Lol lemme stop before I scare some people
Hmmm but I am a creepy person, but not as of yet hit petaphile creepy 
Well whatcha gonna do, but take it like a man...bend ova and touch your toes, BiAtCh!!!"

But harder to wipe a stupid look off your face
So I decide instead of my lazy ass making breakfast why not go to Dunkin Donuts...(yay?)
I go
Wait in line in the drive-thru until it was my turn...

Lady:  Good morning...how can I help you?
Me:  Hi and good morning, can I get a sausage,egg, and cheese croissant and a large coffee?
Lady: Ok, a sausage, egg, and cheese croissant with two coffees?
Me: No, No, No...a sausage, egg, and cheese croissant with a large coffee.
Lady: Oh sorry (crackling sound that drive-thru answerings make) a sausage, egg, and cheese croissant with two small coffees, extra sugar
Me: No, No, No (grinding teeth now)...a-sau-sage, egg, and cheesssseee croi-sant with a largggggee cofffffeeee.
Lady: More crackling and then an embarrased and very rushed apology followed by...Please drive up to the window

With my luck I do not get the girl that waited on my and this poor lady has four small coffees, two regular and two with extra sugar, two sausage, egg, and cheese croissants, and two large coffees.
I glare and gasp at what sits in front of me and that is supposedly mine
Then I see the girl...I knew it had to be her...that waited on me...a voice so perfect for the appearance of this girl...
Ugh! Ugh! Ugh!
Why me?!
Was it the crackling, was it ignorance, was it a communication barrier...wtf?!?!
But then I thought to myself compose yourself because this world is filled with crackling ignorance and communication barriers....the heart of the USA
Hmmmm...I forced myself to smile and begged to differ that all those items were mine to be ringing up
Then the lady with such audacity gives me a dirty look
I decided to let it go because look at the many Po-Pos with their big boy toolbelts or weaponbelts cast an authoritative look...
Them bitches don't scare me, but jail sure as hell does
Damn I should have been a cop...all the donuts you can eat
Hmmm...donuuuttttsss as Homer drools....
Screw the pigs and screw Dunkin Donuts...
Too much crackling ignorance and communication barriers
S.O.S
If the world is full of it though what happens to the few and proud that aren't
Lord knows...maybe one day we will jump that bandwagon to hell with the rest of them...
One day..."

"event","Dancing shimmering light reflecting off the water
Cascading, foamy waves crashing onto the land
A plethora of constellations
Toothpicks maintaining the weight of the pier so unwavering that it is admirable
Spotlights providing a landmark for those who can get lost in its beauty
Something one cannot capture in a bottle 
Much like jarring a snowflake in New York and attempting to bring it to south Florida
Marooned solitude
Opaque darkness and quietness
Deserted signs from those who ventured the interminable distance called the beach 

TEMP.   Swim near a LIFEGUARD   TIDE
AIR 70  80                      HIGH 4:23pm
WATER 73                        LOW 10:10am
            Bathing Condition
                   OK
DATE: 5-2

Signs of all life, but that of a human
Shantily clad lifeguard towers
Lighthouse much like a revolving sprinkler head
But instead of spurting water, it spurts long streams of light 
For the unguided bringing them safely home
Treading without destination 
Just for the simple pleasure of feeling the sand 
Penetrating every crevice and wrinkle of one's foot
Meteored beach resembling the face of the moon
Each meteor telling a story of its history 
Such as a small boy
Digging the sand, the earth, as if he were an archaeologist
Uncovering truths of the past
Mulling over every artifact that he may find
Gently caressing its texture with a pensive and knowing look
So naive, but yet so profound
Nothing like the innocence that an untainted child can possess
Upturned beach chairs that have an air of being used and under-appreciated
Only to serve as the subservient
The underdog
The only solid matter between that of the human body and the grainy beach sand
A person's stature incomparable and disproportionate to that of the grand beach
So much so that if beach had a desire to,
It can engulf that one being and turn them into nothingness
Wispy clouds impersonating that of God's fingers
Stroking the heavens
Blessing the night with his majestic gesture
Stars beaming such light of purity 
Signs of a parallel universe to this three-dimensional world
Stars personifying mystical and ever-so deep eyes
Aged over trillion of years
Filled with wisdom unattainable by the Average Joe
Also Known As Man...
Winds capturing voices of the past
That only one with a sixth sense can feel the presence of 
The wind pushing one one way and the current the other 
Almost as if it were a natural, internal conflict
The War of Nature
Hurried whisperings alluding to the beach's greatness 
Beckoning to discover its treasures
Something that a hurried person would be too busy to pay attention to and won't even think twice of
The ocean is its own DJ 
Mixing the world of water with the world of land 
Knowing everything that is real and laying it down in the coolest way possible
Introducing land and water as if they were two strangers 
As is they were old school buddies that just found each other 
And sustain's each other's existence
Rekindling something that they once had...
Truth - something that lacks in this world
It's the indescribable, but so reliable truth...
An aspect of the beach that is originated and never duplicated."

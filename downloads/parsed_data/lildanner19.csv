Everyday there are ups and downs, sometimes more downs than ups haha but still....haha whatever...rollercoasters... anyway, im really glad i have met the people that I have. Thanks to all the worst people i've ever met..haha..no offense, but you've helped me realize the kind of person that i will never want to be, or ever be around,or associate myself with. AND...thanks to all the wonderful people that i have met that make me realize that life and relationships dont have to be so hard....ever. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have learned in some respects to stand up for myself..hahah sometimes...but i am gonna start standing up for myself more and not listening to people that aren't worth my time( I'm sure they are worth other peoples time, but certainly not mine). :)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anway, i'ts amazing when I meet great people, how great i feel. haha Why don't i just surround myself with these people all the time? I dont know....It's tough getting away from the people i used to be so close with when i first came to school. But I have to because im dying and withering away over here. I feel like such a bad person all the time. Instead of focusing on the good things that i have, all my attention is taken away by the thoughts of these <b>stupid</b> people. By people, i mean person, and by stupid, i mean ridiculously stupid. :) That's mean, but so very true :)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Anyway, im just venting, and im not going to proofread, haha im too lazy and i want a nap really bad.<br /><br /><br /><br />P.s Im so happy right now! aaaahh!!! i miss you babe..thanks for all your support! You have no idea how much it means to me and how much you mean to me!

Maybe one will magically appear before my eyes.......nope..nothing...maybe if i use my conducting baton as a wand, and say a little ""I wish i had a car.."" spell, one will appear...NOPE! nothing again!..damnit...oh well..i guess ill just have to live without one.

Tonight will be fun i think...there is a class council dinner,bonding thing at 6. Apparently the lady cooking is an AWESOME cook ...so im excited to eat a homemade meal! im looking forward to that..but for right now, im gonna go eat some halloween candy and take a shower!!"

Okay so just about 2 minutes ago I thought i lost my keys, but came to the realization that i left them here the whole time because i was in such a rush to get to my class and FORGOT them! o my goodness.. Anyway, I also wanted to give blood today but i couldnt because it was 6 15 when i got there and they said it was gonna be an hour wait until i was able to give blood...they close at 7:00 so they told me to come back in december which sucks but i guess ill have to wait! Today has been crazy...

Friday night we tried to have a party with just the two of us hehe he drank and got drunk and i am a bad drinker and didnt feel good after the first fn drink.. but thats a good thing i guess....maybe...no i lied.. i ruined it haha! oh well, then on saturday we just chilled at the house and we watched a secret garden(""Im not sour"" :/ hehe chad) which i had never seen before but i loved, and we hung out with Claire who is a funny girl. Then we watched Only You, and Snow fn White which was hysterical, lol the witch was a beast and the little dwarfs were scary as hell! aaah! oh.. so anyways, on sunday we woke up and Chad pretended to rake the garden in his boots hahah, and then we decided to go for an adventure in the woods! it was awesome! We climbed up a stream in the woods and it was beautiful! it was a great day to go hiking! That was great Chad ...good times! :). Then we had to go back to school, so it all ended.. waaaaaaah.  But it was a good weekend and Chad's town is so cute and little and pretty and i want it! Alright, that about sums everything up! bye for now!"

"event","So today has been quite a weird day.  To begin, this morning i lost my favorite hat in the whole wide f'ing world. Let me explain and maybe you can help me find it! haha.  Okay well i had it this morning when i ate breakfast with Chad, and then as we were leaving im like ""SHIT I REALLY DONT FEEL WELL""..yea thats right.. i didnt feel well and it was quite hot, but since i hadnt showered i kept it on. :)  Anywho so after Chad and I sadly departed, i scuttled back to davis and went immediately to the bathrooms. I really just needed to wash off my face and put my hair up.  So, anyways, in order to put my hair up i had to take off my hat.  So i took off my precious hat and put it somewhere obviously.  On the floor or on the sink or whatever. I went back to my room not remembering that i had left my hat in the bathroom, and took a half hour nap before my next class.  When i woke up, i searched everywhere for my hat, and i couldnt find it.  I went back into the bathroom and searched high and low, in the toilets, in the showers, and on the floors, but i could not find a single thing!  So i went back to my  room and swore. Not only because i lost my hat, but because i had to go to class with greasy ass hair that i could not cover up any longer! GOSH!  So anyways, that is my depressing story, and if you read this, please keep on the look out for my hat.  It is beige and looks fuzzy and its really cute....:(.  MORAL OF THE STORY= Don't leave your hats in bathrooms because you WILL LOSE THEM!! Katie gave me a hat to borrow for now so that i can continue to go to world music every other day without taking a shower! Thanks Koots! Love ya! Alright well i got to go look for my hat! If you see anyone wearing it, or see one that looks like it, Rip it off their heads and run away!"

I personally think we are wicked good dancers.. and outside the d.c... i mean come on.. that is highly classic! :) muah! love you! Can't wait for our sleepover on saturday either...woo..good times!
  So anywho.. this morning was kinda crappy...I retook my piano quiz for the SECOND time, and Galina is still not happy.  She just doesnt give me a chance, or anyone.  I was nervous and i made one little mistake(i hit the wrong note)in the middle of it and she told me i wasnt ready and needed to take it next time... what the hell!? i was ready for it, but i made one stupid mistake! that doesnt mean im not ready, it justs means im not a professional pianist like her who can sight read and play perfectly! I was sight reading it as best I could, I can't practice for a piece ive never looked at, obviously there are going to be mistakes!! This is piano two, not freaking ""Becoming Chopin"".  I dont know.. piano one was just so much easier,and i feel the gap between the two is huge! im just stressed about it I guess...its kinda comical though BECAUSE its ridiculous....He.....He
  So this whole rooming situation has been quite stressful too! miscommunications and doubts and farts, I feel really bad am Im sorry if it didnt work out for some of us, but i hope things work out for you too and you find a great rooming situation!

Koots and i had a great time together too as always, it's a good time!  Even though i lost every game hahah it was great! Actually, the last game was forfeited so they decided that since i sucked and didnt win any rounds, they would let me have that one.  Wow! hahah so i guess i won one....:) Anywho, I got lots of good pics too so that is fun! I def have to go more often with them! yay! so im gonna leave here because there are oodles and noodles waiting for me to eat! BYE BYE!! :)"

AND we even got the noises down. UGH UGH UGH!! maybe we are too good at those noises.. hehe...anyway, the moral is we are so good and we should go there more often.  Maybe next time we can play for more than a minute without getting tired. haha.. well maybe that was just me :) We have to go to the park more often too!
Anywho, school is going pretty good and everyone is happy, and koots has a great boyfriend and im glad they are with each other.. koots definitely deserves it!  Oh and im going bowling tomorrow with a bunch of peeps and im excited about that too so we will see how i do.  I still bowl between my legs... so maybe i should have someone teach me the right way so i dont make a fool out of myself hahaha which is the case most of the time!!
 
Alright BYE BYE!! :)"

We've always been the best of friends.
No secrets and no demands, but suddenly from somewhere
out of the blue, I see a different light around you.
One thing I haven't told you, I just want to hold you
and never let go.
I need to know

How do I get there from here? how do I make you see?
how do I tell you what my heart's been telling me?
Lost in your loving arms, is where I wanna be.
You know I love you, how do I get there?

You probably think I've lost my mind, taking this chance
crossing that line. I promise to be truer than true.
Dreamin' every night with my arms around you.
I can't wait any longer. This feeling's getting stronger.
Help me find a way

The shortest distance between to points is a
straight line, but
I'll climb any mountain that you want me to climb
the perfect combination is your heart and mine
Darlin' won't you give me sign?

I do not even know what it spurred from: Jury songs, classes, finals, papers, messy rooms, disagreements with friends, my period, upcoming concerts.. .i mean im pretty sure these wouldnt cause to much stress........................Okay that was a joke... Ha....Ha
   So today, i had a great voice lesson with Mr. Lentz.. i mean it couldnt have gone any better.. he is totally like my idol of life right now! But after voice lesson i had another practice with my pianist for my juries and i just had a complete emotional breakdown.  I started CRYING IN THE MIDDLE OF MY SONGS! i couldnt even continue... it was so embarassing... good first impression.  Anyways, Mr. Lentz was so awesome and was hugging me and telling me it was okay.. aww i love him!!!  So then the rest of the day was depressing all the same.  Every time i saw someone walk by i wanted to cry.. i cried like 43,345 times to day.. more like 3 but that is still a lot..and then i went to salvation army to get a costume for the a capella concert and seeing all the poor people there made me even more depressed. ugh what a crappy day.
  I think i will wrap up in my blankies with a peppermint patty and watch home alone..........Oh and chad came over and helped me and cuddled with me :).. and kooty always helps me :).. i love them!

  So i went to see Tao Chang, the pianist tonight in Dever, and let me say, i think i am going to propose to him soon! He is an incredible piano player and i couldnt believe myself when i saw him.  He was definitely the best musician and performist ever!! WOW! Katie and i left speechless, it was just the best thing i have ever seen.  I feel bad for the people who didnt go because it WAS AMAZING and it WAS FREE! what more could you want? sex? Nah.. its not good enough!  I mean i liked it so much that by the end of the night i had fallen in love with the mullet that he had, and that is saying a lot!  I mean i cant wait to get his cd, he is definitely my newest idol! wow! Im so happy im a music major right now!  Im so happy Kooty went with me too! We sat there the whole time in complete shock! Noone talked, and basically i couldnt breathe the whole time because it was so good!
Anyway, we got to meet him after and that was awesome too! I wanted to rape him...so i did......no i lied i didnt. But it was close, Katie had to hold me back... no i lied again she didnt have to do that.  Well anywho we met him and it was great!  Mr. Bonacci then told him that we were the two most committed freshman music students and then i realized that i could die Happy! haha it was just a great experience!
 Then i went to brown bag bingo and everything went to hell because i didnt win everything.. no jk i dont care! it was fun...and oh can i say i love the tree outside the library with all the lights.. awww its gonna be CHRISTMAS SOON YAY!

So yea.. all in all it was a good Thanksgiving...There was a Party at my house which was kinda cool.. i got to see all my friends.. well they were mostly my sisters friends but still it was fun!
  Okay so i got my boob checked out... and *sighs* no breast cancer.  Ive never had a breast exam done before.. lol it sounds crazy that i even got one but i was stressing over the lump i thought was the size of Africa when really my doctor was like there is no Africa Kelly ... just a pea size lump that is umm.... nothing.. and then he said i had a fibrous boob which is weird, i dont even know what that is actually.. maybe i should ask him... i never did like that boob that much.................anywho so that went well!
  Oh and i am so nervous about my jury! My songs are kinda hard and the accompianament(?) is so fucked ....its not tonal at all.  Oh well.. i love not being able to sing, therefore creating anxiety in my body, thus furthering the psychological problems that exist in my body anyways, and even more causing irritation in my left boob.  *SIGH*...but anyways.. I HOPE I DO OKAY.. i mean i have time.. my jury isnt until the 20 of december.. hehe o well im just pre-nervous.

   So anywho chris and i got in a car accident last night.  It was awful, some lady went to take a right into some restaurant and didnt see us in the other lane and we hit the side of her car after swerving off onto the curb and missing a fire hydron by like 4 inches(You are a good swerver chris.. Did you take swerving lessons?) Anyways everyone was okay and the lady and her two kids were okay as well which is the most important thing i guess.  After exchanging all their information, chris and i left and realized two minutes after that he didnt have his cellphone.  We looked everywhere in his car and couldnt find it, so we went back to where the accident was to find it in little bity pieces everywhere on the road.  It was a splendid night. Chris' car isnt damaged that bad though, his mirror is completely smashed in and the side of his car has some dents and scratches but it really isnt that bad.  I think the worst thing for him is going to be telling his parents who already think the accident was his fault even though it clearly wasnt at all.  His parents are crazy...but i hope everything goes okay in the end with chris and his parents because he had such a bad day and he doesnt need the rest of his weekend to be bad.  But anyways im A okay and im celebrating my mom and Alyssa's birthday today!!!!!

I think i have cried already like six times seriously... its awful.. i cant handle it its so graphic.  The worst part of the movie is after the guys die in warfare, their families get telegrams telling them that their son or husband or whatever has died.  OMG!! its awful.. i dont even know what i would do if i was ever alive during that time.  The sad music playing just makes everything so much more sad.  ugh...

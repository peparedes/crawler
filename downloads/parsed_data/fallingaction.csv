Made meatloaf from scratch tonight.  Will find out in a little while if I've managed to poison myself.  So far, so good, though!

Notice that I made myself purchase vegetables to go with this bread-and-meat-laden dish.

Unfortunately, no roommates are home to enjoy the home-cooked meal, but c'est la vie.

Funny thing - when I put the first bite in my mouth, my mind instantly reverted back to thinking that I'd purchased this loaf pre-made.  A good sign, no?  Well, if any of you are hankering for meatloaf (this one is all-beef), please feel free to come by.  There's more than enough at the moment.  I could also make you a meatloaf sandwich, with ketchup, sliced tomato, mayonnaise and all.

This is probably the first meal that I made pretty much everything from scratch.  The beans were frozen, but whatever.  Previous dinners have involved making my own tomato sauce but using frozen or dried pastas.  Hopefully this means that I will continue on the path of teaching myself how to cook.  Still can't really cut anything with knives (weird phobia with knives), but I'm trying to get over that."

In moving all my CDs to a proper bookcase and (so far) leaving them all unsorted has caused me to listen to a lot of CDs I haven't picked up in ages.  I'm trying to resist connecting my iPod to the computer as that's all I've been doing at work.  I get tired of that same cycle of songs, so it's good to play these old albums again.  Like hugging old stuffed animals you'd stored in the back of your closet.

Drinking beer seems to have become more commonplace.  Never did it back home as I never bothered buying it, didn't like drinking alone, and didn't actually like beer.  Now I buy it, knowing that my roommates will help to drink it, and the idea has become implanted that having a beer from time to time isn't so bad.  Having a bit of whisky every night seems to be a sign of something worse, somehow, thus the beer.

Still getting accustomed to living with friends.  Whenever I normally have friends visit, I feel compelled to keep them occupied at all times.  But in living with friends, I'm finding that I have a hard time balancing the time I need to spend by myself versus wanting to play the role of the social friend.  Hopefully, this, along with a few other habits showing their faces, will settle itself in time.

Okay, I should give this drawing another go.  Talk to you all soon."

"event","I just got off the phone with my mother and realized that I miss my family more than I thought I would.  It's been just about two weeks since I picked up most of my belongings and transferred them to my new apartment.

The conversation with my mother was very brief, probably no more than 3 minutes long, but it was surprisingly comforting to hear her voice.  I asked if she would like to go see the new exhibit at the local museum but, of course, with her thrifty ways, she says she'd rather we go in a few weeks when they have a ""free admission"" day.

I've always appreciated her sense of humor.  After the first greeting, I asked what her plans were for tomorrow.  ""Why?"" she responded, ""Did you want to help us watch the laundromat tomorrow while your father and I go out?""

There seems to be a strange phenomenon occurring in these first few weeks - I seem to have even less time than before to do all the things I need to do.  Perhaps it's because I have to think about dinner and chores, which often require time for shopping and washing dishes and such.  It shouldn't be sucking up so much time, especially with my work commute being up to 40 minutes shorter each way, but alas, that's how it is.

I haven't really had a proper night's rest since I've moved in.  I mean, it's been good hanging out with the roommates and friends and everything, but it's not really letting me settle into the whole situation.  Everything still feels very new.  Perhaps it's because the cabinets are still mostly empty, and there isn't much food in the fridge.  I still have belongings in my old room back home, and we go for days without any mail sometimes.

Anyway, a friend of mine told me the other night, ""It sounds like you're really happy, Nancy.""  I guess I am.  It's all very exciting in what seems to be a very silly way.  I suppose it's just because it's long overdue."

""NPR is not the same thing is PBR""

I admit it: I've turned into that person who mentions NPR over and over again.  Is it because it's one of my last channels for entertainment, news, and trivial information wrapped into one?  Almost certainly yes.

These NPR fans... I'd always eyed them with a slight stink-eye, imagining them sitting back easily, their hands clasped slightly above their sweatered bellies, laughing fully and lengthily as droll voices on their antique-style radios discussed the follies of the American government.

A few hairs always prick up at the back of my neck when I feel the compulsion to mention the most recent item I'd heard on NPR.

""Have you heard the name of the woman who won the 'worst name ever' contest?""
""Yeah, I heard about Twitter on the radio the other day.""
""There's a fantastic joke they told about McCain on 'Wait, Wait, Don't Tell Me' this past weekend.""

I listen to NPR at work to keep myself awa-, er, alert as I haven't had much time to get new music.  One of my staples is ""This American Life"" and they replayed a fantastic episode recently.

Give it a listen for free here:

Woke up to a phone call from my mother asking if I'd taken my games home with me.

""Like my DS?""
""No, your other black game.""

The Playstation 2's gone.  Along with a good number of games.  Can't figure out why the person who broke into the laundromat only took the PS2 and about half of the games.  I think they also took a bunch of Gamecube games as well (but not the Gamecube), which are <i>really</i> not going to bring much in monetary return.  Some games were lined up ready to go in small bags, but those weren't taken.  Unopened DVD sets also not taken (though I'm thinking sadly now that they probably did take my Aeon Flux collection).

Eh.  I can't think too much on it.  Will just have to go through what's still around later and maybe make a list of what was taken...  Don't know if that will do me any good, but it might be useful later if I want to repurchase stuff and can't remember if it was actually stolen or not.

So really, this means that if you've let me borrow something of your's, DVD or game, let me know.  I'll see if it's still around.  Otherwise, you're going to get a replacement copy.

Knowing that the memory cards are gone also stings.  Reminds me of

when Marge threatens to delete all of Bart's saved games.

I'm stupid. (Especially since I just typed ""stupid"" as ""studip."")

I just bought myself the limited-edition <i>In Rainbows</i> discbox that I posted about a few weeks/months ago - gift to myself for finishing a drawing and charging too much for it - and now I want the stupid ""do-it-yourself"" package stores everywhere will be selling in two weeks.

Kristeen Young supported Morrissey last night by dressing up like a cute lil' Valentine bouquet.  You can't tell from this photo, but she's wearing a golden bikini top (couldn't see the bottoms) under that dress.  Eat your hearts out, Star Wars fans.

Notice he is wearing a blue shirt here.  He was also wearing a blue shirt at the Paramount show, but it was a little harder to tell, as you can see from my documentation back then:

Just a trim.  Also, I've been getting easily overheated lately.  The August weather has arrived, and pretty soon, I'll be folding up the cuffs of my jeans again.

In other news, Olivia and I have come up with the title for our upcoming September show:
<center><i>in the time it takes</i></center>

I might hate it later, but it's too late now!  So far, it's holding up, so I'm pleased.

<b>Also</b>  A conversation involving two of the haircutting people included comments like, ""Your hair is very difficult to cut"" and ""I remember her; she has very coarse hair, doesn't she?"""

<lj user=""juanstrosity""> and I stopped by the not-so-local Kwik-E-Mart before hopping over to the Simpsons Movie.  Even with all the hype and such, I was happy to find that I wasn't at all disappointed.

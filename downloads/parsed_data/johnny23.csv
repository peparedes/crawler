"event","So my most recent project has been editing a 30 minute short film titled ""Homerun.""  It has been on hiatus for the last month or so while the audio boys compose the score for it.  Then I get to jump back in, insert the audio, do some touching up on some of the scenes/titles, and bam.  I'm done and I have a movie to throw on my resume.  I'm also in the early stages of shooting a video for a friend of mine's band, and i was going though my notes, trying to think of some cool things to do for it and i remembered back to a conversation I had when i first started work on homerun, and how the director said it would be cool to get the final output on DVD, and we were trying to think of places that we could outsource to for DVD authoring.  Then it hit me.  ""Holy Shit! I'll have my studio built by the time I get back to work on Homerun! I can do the authoring myself!"" And that made me very happy.  For reasons other than it will probably be an extra $200 at least in my pocket.It is one more thing i can use to sell myself.  For whatever reason, maybe it is the sudden release of nicotine from my patch, maybe it is because i am tired and exicted and all sorts of crazy ideas are running through my head thanks to exhaustion and my body being all screwed up from whatever the hell type of cancer that is 10 times worse than i would probably get from smoking this patch is giving me.  But i feel hopeful, which is a big change from the last couple of days, especially last night and earlier today.  HOORAY FOR BEING MANIC!"

And i ordered my NTSC monitor that i really shouldn't have because i really can't afford it, but my studio is pretty much done, which is good.  I can't wait until next week when the real building begins.  I am excited about that.  What i am not looking forward to is finding more clients, or a real job in my field.  the internship i had lined up is going to fall apart, and mn sucks for work in the winter, not that it is that huge of a market in the first place, but i should be able to find work.  it's just that not having really any experience that is going to hurt me, and i have to find an internship in the meantime, and apparently that just can't be done in mn, so i am probably going to have to take out another loan and go out to la and do some damn internship and be away from my family for 3-4 months.  i wish i had a better way to market myself other than ""dur, i can edit video real purty dur."" but the fact it, i don't know what the hell i'm doing as far as looking for/getting work.  it fucking sucks, and i am not going to either a) work a bullshit retail job, b) work at a bullshit hotel job, c) wait tables, or d) bartend for the rest of my fucking life.

I keep telling myself it is going to be worth it, and it is by far, but shit...it is so fucking borning without smoking to fill in the gaps.  And now as i approach the end of day 1, i am starting to feel the need.  But i am doing good, doing good.  i only stole a total of three drags all day from Kara.  10 days i'll have my computer though.  10 days my studio will be almost entirely complete.  i just need to find an NTSC monitor that is good and cheap, and something or another else..oh yeah, a dealie for analog capture, but that isn't priority right now.  the monitor is.  not the other thing.  unless it is like $20 or some shit, which it isn't.

Some fucking drunk fratboys were just outside of the hotel screaming and yelling and being morons for like 5 minutes, and one of them pissed on the goddamn tree we have out there.  So I called the cops.  I feel really bad about that, because I hate calling the cops.  I never do that, because, well I don't really like cops.  Not that I think they are bad people, I think they have a very important job, but I am just scared that I am going to wind up getting busted for something or another, even though I have done nothing wrong.  This probably goes back to my days as a very drug addled teenager, but it's still there.  So I called the cops on the loud motherfuckers that pissed on my tree.  They were gone by the time the cops got here (not too far gone because I could stillo hear them and they had to be over a block away) and they wound up hasseling a couple that came by later and were just standing infront of the hotel.  Wrong place, wrong time for them, but the cops let them go fortuantly.I feel bad."

"event","So we went to see Vanilla Sky tonight.  It's one of those movies that just makes you want to rape Cameron Crowe with gardening tools while forcing him to eat all of the ""Previously Viewed Only $9.99"" copy of Almost Famous that they have at Blockbuster.  

I gotta admit, I liked this movie a *lot* for the most part.  It was easy enough to figure out, but it was still a total mindfuck, which was great.

Lots of problems in the last 40 minutes of it though.  I don't know if my favorite moment was the lame expository dialogue telling what happened (my problem isn't so much with wrapping it up like that as it was Tom Cruise not coming to the solution on his own, and how he came to be there), or Tom Cruise running through a building yelling ""TECH SUPPORT!""

It was just an ultra lame MTV ending.  Especially the tech support part which just made me want to scream ""WELCOM TO TEH INFARMACHION AGE! YUO = FAGORT! LOL!""  It was like Cameron Crow had himself written into a hole, needed to find a good way to get out and give Tom Cruise his redemption/solution, and instead of taking the obvious way out (good way), he asked Steven Spielberg for help on how to end it (bad way).  

And Spielberg, ooooh boy I just had to go and get started on this fucker. THANKS FOR BUTCHERING WHAT SHOULD HAVE DIED WITH KUBRICK YOU BASTARD! There were litteraly four different endings in that movie (I'm on about AI now, suckers). It kept going and going and going and going.  After that long though it became an endurance challenge.  In retrospect, i do wish i walked out after the first end point, which was a total downer and i liked it, but nooooooooo the next point, worse but you could still kind of get out kind of ok.  still not happy.  then it just turns into typical speilbergo children's fucking fantasy bullshit and gets lame lame lame lame.  

But i grow tired of this.  I go to sleep now."

"event","Back in the day, I used to hate wearing anything other than a t shirt and jeans, with a smart and stylish jacket.  Substance over style was my mantra.

What a load of bullshit.  

I mean, not completely, it is possible to have one without the other, but I think going for substance over style causes one to fall short of truly achieving substance.  Substance after all is the entire package, not just one part over another.  

Which brings me to Mod.  

I have always liked mod stuff.  The music, the fashion, the scooters.  But I could never get the look right to where I was happy with it.  Maybe because I can't pull off a mop top.  It might have been because of those couple of years when I was really fat.  

But I'm not fat anymore, and for the last few years I have successfully been pulling off the mod look, to finally fit in with all the other wierd personality quirks and obsession with the 60s I have.  

That is what brought me to the realization that substance over style is bullshit.  

See, the second mod movement that started in the mid to late 70s, during the height of the punk movement, wasn't about making any particular social statements, wasn't about anything other than authenticity.  The music had to sound like the original mod 60s pop, and the clothes had to look like the original mod clothing, taking a lot from Italian fashion.  Hence the Vespas.  And also like fashion, it can only last for so long, which is why in the early 80s it gave away to Two Tone and Ska.  Which I personally don't care for at all, but that is another issue all together.

I have enough of a social conscience and awareness of the world around me that I can focus on fashion and not become a total vacant shit.  But in giving in to the whole neo-mod philosophy, it isn't enough to simply dress like a mod.  You have to stay in touch with fashion, keep up on the trends, etc.  Which I can't afford, but that's okay.  I figure I still have at least another year before the whole Strokes thing blows over and I have to find something new.  But who knows.  Maybe I'll just stick with the mod/beatnick college professor look because damnit, I like it."

I haven't touched this for days and i am only doing so now because i'll fell like a total loser if i don't.  People will be able to see, not only how boring i am, but how lazy i am.

I have been on an archers of loaf and beatles kick for the last week.  I have finally begun to switch from beatles to archers as of today.  mainly listening to vGOAT, but also switching to Ickey Mettle.  Tomorrow i think i will have to break out Vee Vee though.  Ahh Archers...how i miss you.

"event","I am so happy.  The Steelers are just slaughtering Baltimore 20-3.  Makes me feel really good.  I hate Baltimore.  I hate them oh so much.  

But what I hate more than Baltimore is how stupid my mother-in-law is.  Seriously, someone should slap her upside her goddamn stupid head.  She is in the middle of going through her *fourth* divorce.  Fourth.  Number four.  And it is really a bunch of bullshit.  Not that her current marriage was the best, but it was certainly the best that she has been able to/probably will ever have.  So she goes out and has an affair with this scumbag redneck hick guy for over a year, lying about it the entire time, even to her own daughter that asked her point blank about it.  Then two months later she comes clean, but not completely clean.  She says that this guy decided he didn't want to have anything to do with her because she has so much baggage and is in the middle of this divorce and everything.  Total lie.  She has still been seeing him even though she decided to try and ""work things out"" with her husband, which was also a total lie.  

Her whole thing is ""i haven't ever had my own life, i've always been in relationships and i need time to figure out who i am and blah blah blah blah blah.""  Yeah, great fucking way to do that, Nancy by going out and hooking up with some scumbag before you're not even divorced.  (fun side note, every divorce she has had, she has had the next guy she was going to marry lined up).  I don't know, maybe it is just me but i don't think it takes a rocket scientist to see that if what you want is time for yourself, getting into a relationship might not be the best way to do it.  

Goddamnit Baltimore scored. 20-10.  

And another thing, you're 50 years old, NOT, I repeat NOT 18.  Think about the concequences of your actions and try to be a bit fucking responsible for yourself, and maybe think about the effect it has on your family for once.  Oh, another thing, every divorce she has gone through she pawned her kids off on relatives so she could go out and ""have time for herself"" while she fucked around with her new guy.  When my wife started college, did you give a shit about how she was doing?  No.  Then why do you think she should give a shit now when you call to tell her how you did that semester now that you are back in school?  And my little brother-in-law, he is just a fucking inconvience to her.  She can't even by his love properly.  He was staying with us a couple of weeks ago when he had a 3 day weekend (he lives with his dad, husband #2 btw), she decided that she should take him out one afternoon and buy him some comic books, then she bitches at him for how much it costed. And until this year, she was getting child support for him that he never saw dime one of, even though he was living with his dad.  It was part of a deal she struck since the courts wouldn't give him custody.  

Goddamn, if it was up to me she would lose Grandma privledges so fast.  But Kara won't let me completely do that, but my little girl doesn't need to be exposed to Nancy's insanity any more than my wife should be.  And i will never let Molly be around this new guy assuming Nancy sticks with her M.O. and hooks up with him.  But apparently he has a girlfriend, so who knows what is up with that.  Congratulations, Nancy! You sure know how to pick 'em!"

so i was over on isca tonight, and i got into a conversation with a muslim
about religion.  When i would ask more philosophical questions about islam and
how their belief in god works (i.e. he said something along the lines of with
christianity you pray to jesus, the son and not the god itself, and in islam
you don't need a go between; it is just you and god, and basically islam is
jsut believe in god, and do well.  i asked, then why should god care if you
believe or not, wouldn't your actions and deeds be more important than the
actual belief?  if there was a god, and you did good things, but did not
believe, why should that matter to god if you were doing good?
his reply was ""you see, tackling those philosophical questions is not really a
muslim's job.  you should just believe in God and do well.""

i have never, ever heard a good answer for that question from any religion. 
xians especially get really defensive about it.  i'm not trying to attack any
beliefs here, i am trying to understand why the have this belief in god.  i am
not trying to convert anyone to athiesm, and i am not going to change my
beliefs.  i just want to know what is so important about believing in god.  why
should god care if you are a catholic and you masturbate 50 times a day?  why
should god care if you're a jew and you go out and eat a hamsteak wrapped in
bacon?  it doesn't make any sense.  arrgh.  why would god if he cares for his
creation so much, have his church promote a policy of poverty among its devout
(ok back to the xian stuff again, but that is the religion i know the most
about and therefore have the most problems with)?

anyway, the muslim guy was nice enough.  you can tell when people have this
""i'm so sorry you don't have god"" tone though.  My day care provider asked me
the other day when i went to pick my daughter up if i believed in god, which
took me by suprise.  I just flatly said ""Uh? Oh, no. Noooo."" to which she
replied ""oh that's too bad."" i mean she respects that i don't believe and
doesn't like try to shove the love of jesus down my throat and into my heart,
but why is it too bad?  i don't do ""Bad"" things.  I have a strong sense of
right and wrong and justice and injustice.  I lead what i consider to be a good
life, and i am true to myself and my beliefs without infringing on others. 
what is so bad about that?

But this new manager lady.  Goddamnit, she is here for 2 days and she somehow manages to fry the TV.  And tonight of all nights i forgot to bring any DVDs to watch on my computer, so i am stuck.  At work.  All night.  Bored.  With nothing to watch.  

I might actually have to work on re-writing my screenplay.  

I have been watching episodes of Sealab 2021 that i downloaded at home with my amazing broadband abilities (maybe the thrill of having a cable modem hasn't worn off yet after all).  But now I am about to start the last episode I have, and i am dreading what will happen once i reach the end of those 12 glorious minutes.  

But tonight I go outside for a smoke and some guy comes over and buys a cigarette off of me and starts talking about all this shit.  It made me remember why i love the night shift:  There is nothing to do except make sure the place doesn't burn down, and the people you do occasionally wind up dealing with are doped up or drunk or something and that makes for wacky adventure fun times.  He talked to me about nothing for like 15 minutes, rambling on about strippers and some fucking duplex or something.  He was so fucked up I couldn't understand a word he was saying.  Good times.  The last guy that came by and did that gave me $50 to drive him downtown."

I have been on a big Beatles kick the last couple of days.  Just listening to Rubber Soul mostly.  My wife was in Barnes and Nobles the other day and said she saw a new John Lennon biography that had a picture of him on the cover that looked just like me.  It must have been the mid to late 70s John Lennon when he was really doing the drugs because I don't have the potato head like the 60s Lennon.  I like the Beatles.  

It snowed a lto last night too, and that sucks because I didn't put the van in teh garage because I would have had to dust it off last night when it was really cold, and fuck that!

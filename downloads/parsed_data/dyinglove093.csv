what it was like
to believe in some one.
to know, tomorrow
will never be a lie.
-
i continue to wonder if
i ever truly loved or
if i forgot
how. when
i was a child
but then again, who
is there to teach?
-
on the days
where the rain
is falling, drowning
the roads
and you don't know 
which direction to go
i'll show you the star
north is the direction
of home
but this heart keeps stalling
holding me back
again
and again
and i've lost the sound
of your voice
this time.
-
and i think, just maybe
along the way
you tossed this heart
but kept the key
in memory of me
and
sun will rise, and sun will set
but in the end
you may forget
and you'll watch winters
first snow
alone
and i hope you know
we were lovers once
lost and lonely
on this hollowed ground.
|
but i haven't forgotten,
i just used to know.."

"event","So I got two tattoos, symmetrical tribal designs on each front lower hip,
and my belly button pierced on all four sides.
I also gauged my ears from 18 to 2 in one night, 
and pierced my cartiledge again on the same side that I had before.
I'm highly contemplating piercing the other side soon.

But my tattoos and belly button are pretty badass, not gonna lie..
I'll post pictures when I can, if I care enough to.

My birthday is in two weeks. August 3rd.
And I don't really even care. It's weird.
But it's pointless to care.

I should be buying my car in the beginning of August,
as well as finally getting my liscence.

I start school on August 14th;
will be attending monday-thursday from 8am-12pm,
and will be graduating this fall.

Shortly after, I will be moving back to Oregon,
and getting my own apartment some where in Portland this winter.

I will be quitting my job at the end of the month,
if my boss doesn't give me management position,
or at least a dollar raise. It's just not worth it any more.

I yelled at my father last night for the first time in my life.
Things haven't been going too well at home.

I have a doctors appointment next wednesday,
and will be going back on my anti-depressants.

This is my life. Nothing more, nothing less.
And it's pointless to care any more."

So I'm coming to Oregon on Christmas,
and leaving for Arizona on the 7th of January.

&& I basically have no where to stay,
so if any one wants to help out, it'd be appreciated<3

But let's make plans now, cause I won't have a phone up there.

So I realized that I haven't updated this in a while. 
I thought I might give that a try.

I stayed home from school today. I missed my bus, && didn't want to walk, because I was hung over. *shrugs* what can ya do?

So I still have a 4.0, or at least close to it, last time I checked. The school just now got my transcipt from West Linn. I'll be starting community service soon, so that I can have early release next year. Sixty hours = 1/2 credit. I have to do this huge packet && one page essay for every 60 hours I do. I need to do 240 hours total to earn two credits. Good thing I have a while to do this. It will be worth it though, next year.I will only have three classes a semester, most of which will be electives any ways. I can honestly say, that I will be coasting my way through the rest of highschool.

I caught a scorpian yesterday. It was in our bath tub. It's pretty big, actually -- a few inches long. It's bigger than any Jeff, my parents, or I have found before. We put him in an empty spaghetti sauce jar, and put two inches of rubbing alcohol in it to kill him. After a couple hours, we poured it out in to a bowl, with a folded paper towel layed down to absorb the alcohol. After about five minutes, he started moving again. Those little bastards are fucking hard to kill, && will kick your ass if you let it. We put him back in the jar, with more rubbing alcohol, && let it set over night. I'm pretty sure he's dead now, lol.

I've been in a weird state of mind for a long time now. Some could say I have gone back to the way I was before I moved to Arizona, but it's different some how. I don't know how, but my depression seems to have grown to a deeper level, way beyond how I was before. Any how, I've become really irritable with people here lately. And I'm really sick of getting hurt. Oh, I gave Jessie back his two shirts yesterday, that I've had for god only knows how long. He said he wants to keep my necklace, && he doesn't want to give it back. I don't think he wants to keep it for the sake that it's mine, it's just a cool necklace.. But what ever, I really don't care. I'm coming to find that I don't even love him any more. He's changed too much since he got back from PA. He's the same person, but I hardly know him any more. His loss.

I've come to find out that you get to thinking differently after some one close to you has died. Very differently. I don't know how to explain it, but not a day goes by that I don't think about it.

I find my self ignoring my mother for different purposes than usual. I haven't responded to any e-mails, and I haven't called her, even though I know that she needs me. I feel bad, but I can't bring my self to talk to her, because that means facing reality, and facing all the <b>shit</b> going on in Oregon. I hate it.

Idk what else to talk about. Um, I'm trying to get a job. I was going to work at Sonic, but they're taking too long. I'm going to try to get a hostess/waitress job at the Elephant Bar with Mikele. To those of you in OR, it's a pretty nice restaurant, so I'm thinking it will make more money than some place like Sonic or DQ. Plus it's a job that I can get promoted in and I think it will look better on my resume. If that doesn't work out- my father is going to try to pull some strings && get me a job at Texas Roadhouse. Should be good. If not, I have other options. I can work with Kaiti, at her new job, or theres a few pizza places that are hiring. If I worked at DQ I'd have to get a clear plug for my nose so it doesn't close up. Piercings are ""unacceptable"" there. I don't want to do that, plus I want more piercings, so I don't think I'd do that. I'm hoping to get my lip pierced after getting a 4.0 boths semesters. I'm hoping it'll happen. My dad has an attitude like it's going to be a possibilty. So, yay. I wish I was 18 so I could work at best buy. They make <b>really</b> good money.

Um, blah blah blah.. blah blah blah.. blah blah blah. Idk what else, so bye."

They pulled life-support.
She'll be dead within 24 hours.

I'll update.

Life sucks.
Call me emo, I don't care.
[Jeff]

So, Jessie && I are through.
I can't do it any more.
Friday night I told him I love him,
&& I [we] decided we're through.
He's moving to PA when he graduates
[this year]
&& then he is going in to the military.
[[Though Kaiti says she's not letting him leave.]]
That being said, all that's left to say is
<b>I miss my best friend</b>...

Well, I have a lot of friends here now.
&& a few enemies.
And though it's better than West Linn,
Cactus High School is NOT fabulous.

Homecoming is in two weeks.
I'm thinking about going,
since I haven't been to a dance in AZ yet.
But I kind of don't want to.
So if some one asks me, I'll go.
If some one doesn't, I won't.
But Britteny wants to go with me,
so maybe I'll go.

School is good.
[Those of you in Oregon,
I've been in school
for over a month now.]
And, well, I have a 4.0
Yes, Kaitlyn Smith, the screw up in life
is acheiving all A's.
SO FUCK ALL YOU THAT DOUBT[ed] ME!

I miss some things in Oregon.
I miss some people in Oregon.
I'm thinking about moving back.
Maybe for Senior year?
What do you all think?
&& uh, who can I live with?

I don't talk to my mother.
Which I like.
She doesn't even know I have a phone.
[muawahaha]
Um, my mother moved out of West Linn.
[She sent me an e-mail]

Things with my father are.. not good?
I don't talk to my Step-mom like I used to.
I miss them, && it's hard.

I'm [probably] going to start working at Sonic.
Those of you in Arizona, come visit me,
&& tip me, <b>duh</b>.

Any questions?
I'd be happy to answer.
&& Sorry if I missed any thing.
But, like I said, I'll answer questions.

<strike>if I told you I <i><b>love</b></i> you</strike>,
<u>what would you say?</u>

running through my mind
constantly
these thoughts
I can't bring myself to speak
because I can't let you hear it
I can't add every thing that I'm dying to say
to your list of worries in life

but I close my eyes at night
hoping and thinking you'll come tap on my window
waking me up from my dreams about you
so we can create another memory
like so many that are locked away in my heart
forever
so many memories that are fading with the hands of time
but so many that I will <b>never</b> f o r g e t
you were all that I wanted
all that I'll possibly ever want
and in this moment in time
all I can think of is your voice
and the beautiful things you used to whisper in my ear
the feeling of your warm breath on my cheek
laying together
me holding you close
you holding me close
the feeling indescribable
as if unreal, or made-up
and at that point in my life
I was happy
genuinly, truly, happy
a feeling I can't recall before you
ever
you gave that to me
I thank you for the knowledge
the experience
the trust
the memories
the feelings
the bliss
the shame
the pain
&& the heart ache

still I think back to that summer day in June
our last <b>real</b> kiss
a kiss with such passion and enthralling feelings behind it
your eyes so intensified and captivating
I can still feel your lips on mine if I try
still breathing you in
needing you like oxygen
those moments burned in my memory
of you && I
and some times
when I was with you
I'd close my eyes
take a deep breath
and no one would be around us any more
I was lost in a world you showed me
a world we discovered together

and the lust
remember wanting to feel you inside me
feel our souls joined as one
connected in a way so deep
so meaningful
and so completely && utterly gone
<strike>forever?</strike>


s h o w  - m e -  h o p e


If you gave me some thing to wait for
I'd wait forever for you
but forever seems like such a long time
to wait for nothing

so break my heart
or tell me you never will
but don't leave it empty any more

Sorry guys.
He decided he's still not ready for a relationship, because of his fucking ex Brook! :( ugh, well they were together for 3 years, and when they broke up [recently] it took a lot out of him. He decided he wasn't ready and thought it was better to wait. But he's mad at himself because he said that he cares a lot about me and likes me a lot and has never been happier blah blah blah but just is confused.

<font color=red>It has a heart on the outside, saying ""Believe In Yourself.""
Then on the inside, it says ""..I do.""
Pissed me off so fucking bad.
If any of you actually knew the things she used to say to me, or the things she'd do, you'd understand it.
But, I can remember specific times when she would say how stupid I was for thinking I could accomplish some thing.

These are what are staying with us for the weekend.
We have two little sugar gliders.
They're my smom's boss'.
We're taking care of them while he's out of town..

"event","And you saw the hatred seep from her eyes,
as she watched disdain drip from your lips..
you had never screamed so loud
than in that moment you spoke of  nothing
[the silence causing her to go deaf]
and we held our breath
as she walked away
and you stayed..
and with out speaking a word
you watched her leave you behind

SHITTY! >:o"

"event","I was looking back on some old e-mails, convos, and LJ entries today. I don't even see how I held on so long to you. Yea, I'm over you, n' it sorta makes me laugh. You were never the best friend you said you were. I always exagerated your good qualities. Always made it sound like you were so much better than you really were. I always made it sound like you treated me sooo much better than you really did, when in reality, you treated me pretty bad most of the time, and left me in tears.

I had a conversation with my smom yesterday, about her ex husband. And how, he was never a good person, and treated her badly, but yet she married him and had two kids with him. I asked what it was that made her do that, and she brought up a point we had made a while back. It was about how some times we get caught up in guys that aren't exactly the best people, and we feel obligated to make them a better person. Also, how the <i>few times they treat us well</i>, pulls us in <b>deeper</b>, and we stick around, hoping and wishing to get another opportunity like that. We <i>ignore the bad</i> things, and let the <i>good things shine</i> through. But in the end, you realize that it's <b>not worth it.</b> It's not worth getting hurt so many times, just to get one moment of joy.

I'm sorry, but I'm glad I stopped when I did."

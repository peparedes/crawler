Can't believe it. This has passed way too quickly. I'm not sure if that's good or not so good. I've saved up a good amount of money, enough to send some to Maggie every now and then. I probably could go somewhere else if I wanted to. I could probably go get a real job, drive my own car, live in a high-rise somewhere and pretend none of this ever happened. I don't think I'm really ready to leave, though. 

Believe it or not, something's telling me to stay, despite all the bad shit that's gone down here. And I mean, really bad shit. But this is life, you know? Doesn't matter where I am, it's gonna catch up to me eventually. I don't know what I want to do with myself anymore. I don't know where I'm going to be in six months, much less five or ten years.

It's kind of corny but the people here are just different. I mean, they laugh, cry, fuck and fight just like everyone else, but I almost think it's just the fact that they're down and out, and they know it. They don't pretend to be any better than they are, because everyone else is just like them. Maybe I'm codependent or something (you know, because I need something else to add to the list) but they just come in here, this unassuming little bar, with all the weight of fucking New York on their shoulders and you know... it feels good to try and make their day a little better. 

Some people stitch them back together when they get cut, some people clean their teeth, some cut their hair. I pour their booze and get to know about their kids and their busted business deals and their wrecked cars and call me crazy, 'cause I think that's just as important. I think I finally understand the way this place works.

Then again, maybe I'm wrong. Guess we'll have to wait and see... I've got customers."

Fucking goddamn bastard raped me. Fucking raped me. Tells me he wants me to be a fucking whore and then rapes me like I was asking for it. Like I fucking <i>wanted</i> it.

What gave him the right, huh? Who gave him the fucking <i>right</i>? 

I'm going to hunt him down, and I'm going to fucking kill him. As soon as I get my sanity back. He's dead. He's fucking dead. That motherfucker is gonna die, and I'm going to pull the trigger. I'll shoot him in the stomach, make him fucking suffer. I'll make him fucking beg for me to kill him. See how he fucking likes it.

"event","God, where to begin?

So much time has passed, it's insane. Really, really insane.

Two months. 

Holy shit.

And I actually have more than one pair of clothes now. Which is good.

It's been interesting. I actually surprised myself a bit-- sure, I'm no [insert famous bartender's name here], but I'm actually pretty competent. Billy was right. Anyone who wants a fancy-ass drink can damn well make it themself.

I've met more people to add to my list.

There's Johnny, first off. Thought the guy was your typical tough-customer at first, but we got to talking and I think I really like the guy. I mean, he's an ex-priest, which doesn't really seem to fit him at first glance (well, maybe the ex part). But once you talk to him, you can kinda see how it fits. Anyway, he's not with his church anymore, and we got to talking, and I guess he's building this community center down here. Which is really, really cool. I know there's lots of people who would appreciate that. I mean, everyone down here's so jaded and shit, and Johnny's probably jaded enough for an entire third-world country, but he's got big ideas. This place could use a little... less pessimism, I guess. Yeah. He's pretty damn cool. I'll have to see about helping him out sometime. That, or just hanging out and drinking. He seems to like that well enough.

And then there's Liv. Hot mama. I mean, I've seen some beautiful girls, but she's just... wow. Even in a grease-stained yellow waitress uniform and with a bruise on her face, she's fucking sex-on-very-long-legs. (And I have to say, she hid the bruise very well. If I hadn't been completely checking her out, I don't think I would have noticed. Makes you wonder...) Kind of an unconventional meeting, but I guess it's a good thing I'm a bit of a klutz, or she wouldn't have had to pick up any beer bottles. S'also a good thing I was off-duty, or I don't think I would have been able to pull off sitting around and chatting with her.

I do that a lot, I'm noticing. Hope Billy doesn't mind. S'good for repeat business, so I hear.

Anyway, Liv seems to think that the Dusk needs a bit of feminization. Or live music, one or the other. I have a feeling I know which Billy will like better. I hope she stops by again on my shift: she's funny as hell, and did I mention the 'sex-on-very-long-legs' factor? Damn, I love tall girls.

I've talked to Elijah more, too. We had one hell of a strange conversation, and it's pretty much been confirmed that we're 100% certified, as Billy might say. But he's cool, and it's nice to have a guy my age about. A couple of the waitresses are nice, but after their shift, they're outta here. Same with the other bartenders. So it's cool to have someone to chill with on occasion. 

And yeah, we went and fed ducks. <i>Ducks</i>. As in, quack quack. What'll I think of next? 

I haven't seen Tobey around much lately. Okay, correction, I <i>have</i> seen him a few times, but we haven't talked in weeks. At least. Probably avoiding me, fucking prick. The funny part is that if I ever mentioned it, he'd probably say something along the lines of, ""What makes you think you're so important that I'd actually go out of my way to avoid you?""

Gotta love it. Rat bastard. I'm giving him warm whiskey next time. 

Actually, now that I think of it, Liv mentioned him when we were talking. I wonder if he deals to her. I mean, I'm no expert, but she doesn't look like a pill popper. Then again, you never know around here. 

I think I'm just pissed that I haven't talked to him, and Liv sort of acted as if there was something wrong with him. It was strange. 

...I think I'm such a girl. Excuse me while I go find some balls."

"event","Talked to Maggie today. She's always had a way of prying things out of me, and... I kinda ended up telling her everything. And I really mean everything. I'm pretty sure she didn't really want to hear my mini-gush about Tobey, but at least I have a confirmation that I've transformed into a deprived, depraved Catholic school girl.*

<small>*I think it's even scarier to realize that, when it comes right down to it, if I thought dressing up in a blouse, plaid skirt and knee-high socks would turn Tobey on, I'd probably pretty much do it. Which, if you consider how long I've known the guy, makes it evident that a) I am clingy beyond belief, b) I am a glutton for punishment, c) I have <i>very</i> odd (see also: improbable and unfathomable) choice in ...um, people, d) that I need my medication, e) I need a lot of it and I need it <b>now</b> and f) I desperately need to get laid.</small>  

Anyway, we talked a lot, probably racked up a hell of a long-distance bill. Mags wants me to come back and live with her. She's just with the kids now, Grandma Carmen died in her sleep four days after I left, which is amazing to me, because I honestly can't fathom how she managed to survive for so long by herself after Grandpa Hank died back... God, I must have been thirteen when he passed away. And I mean, take Billy. His parents died when he was a kid, and his sister died not too long ago. So many people just... die... 

I told her I can't go back with her, because I can't do that to her anymore. I mean, having to drive me to therapy and the pills and me not being able to work because of the depression and the withdrawals and me losing my temper around her kids (God, I love them to death, I hate myself for it) and then pretty much slitting my wrists in her tub and... 

I can't do that to her ever again. One day, it'll be her living with me, and she won't need her shitty $500-a-month child support because I'll take care of all three of them. And I'll have money and a nice car and we'll be normal and not suicidal and not involved in drugs and shit like that. It'll be nice.

But until then I'm going to have to keep talking with her and I'll have to not tell her where I am because she'll come and try to make me leave. I wish I could make her understand why things are okay right now. She doesn't really realize that it would just make things bad again. Maggie always thought she could just, save the world and everyone in it. I always liked her for that, I never told her. Maybe I should have. But she takes it really personal when she can't do anything about something that's wrong or, you know, to help someone. 

After Mom and Dad died, we both went to therapy. Sometimes together, sometimes not. But I saw her, she was so brave, she took it all head-on. She had me to worry about and her ex-husband and her kids and then Dad and Mom. I wish she didn't think she had to always be so brave for me. I know she wanted to cry a lot more than she did, and I wish she'd give me a chance to be strong for her too, you know? I can't ever repay her for what she did for me, but I can at least try.

But I have to show her that. I can't tell her. You just don't talk about that stuff. I don't know why.

You just don't."

"event","I'm not sure exactly how it happened, but I suddenly have somewhere to live and a job. Tobey (more on him later) doesn't seem to like him much, but Billy is fucking heaven-sent, as far as I'm concerned. If I ever have kids, I'm naming my firstborn after him. Or something. So yeah, this is good. Place to sleep, food if I need it (and hey, let's be frank here, I don't really need much), a bathroom... hey, did I mention I got a shower? And a shave? Mind-boggling, I know. 

Not quite sure what I'm going to be doing as far as work goes. I'm no good at making drinks (and believe me, I've tried) but I might get to wipe tables or stand behind the counter and look pretty. I guess I'll have to wait and see. I'm just thankful I even have something to do besides sit around and have people throw pennies at me. (Apparently I look like a fountain of some sort. How this came to be, I can't say.)

Also have a pretty-much busted arm at the moment. I was sure it was broken, but I'll just have to trust Tobey's doctor, I guess. The pain meds are wearing off, so that's a lot of fun. My back and shoulders are pretty sore, but I think I got off easy for being mauled with a crowbar. 

Speaking of which, that's how I ran into Tobey. Scared off the assholes who decided to mug me. (Okay, do I <i>look</i> like the kind of guy that's loaded? Not really.) Took me to a doctor friend of his, got me hooked up with this sling and everything. We got to talking, and I think he's actually a decent guy, despite being a drug dealer. I mean, it's gotta suck to know that there's so many people out there that don't even know you, but hate you all the same. But I guess he's gotta keep up a reputation. Call me an optimist, but I think he's really a very different person from who he acts like he is. I think being in New York does that to you. You have to change to survive. (Hell, it's amazing I've lasted this long.) But he seems genuinely nice sometimes, like he's got all the best parts of him stuffed away and doesn't allow them to show very often. He should smile more. (This has been Dr. Gyllenhaal, ladies and gents. I'll be here all week, no worries.)

And I'll admit, the guy's kind of scary at times, but he's <b>damn</b> hot. And pretty good at outwitting me, to boot. (I.e. Making me spill my guts about not minding that he sleeps with guys, etc, etc) He's fucking slippery. So, yeah... I want to see him again, but at the same time I'm not sure I could keep my mouth in check. He somehow activates the inner, giggly fifteen-year-old girl inside me that I never knew I had. I'm sort of apprehensive about seeing him again: since he hangs out around the bar a lot, it'll probably be sooner rather than later. I've never bitten my nails before, but I think I just might have to start.

Also met another interesting character-- Elijah. Ran into him (literally) when I left my room this morning. He's a little guy, but it felt like a ton of bricks hit me. Strange, that. Maybe I need to eat more. Anyway, we got to talking, apparently Billy's let him rent a room before, but he was all out the night I came, so he let Eljiah sleep on his couch (Now I feel kinda guilty, he probably needed the room just as much as I did.) Anyway, apparently he's been out here since he was fifteen, which I just can't get my head around. He's such a nice, funny guy, I wish he could see it. He thinks he's not worth shit because he's a whore, and I don't think he'd believe me if I tried to convince him otherwise because he thinks I'm just an optimistic guy with my decency still intact. But I don't get it, I just don't understand it. I can't imagine all the shit he's been through, everything that's happened to him to make him think that about himself. I don't think he should allow what he does to define him, but he's been out here so long... I think he's just resigned himself to it. I can tell he hates it, but I don't know what to say to him. We're the same age, but I'm just a naive little kid compared to him... he seems way too young, but at the same time, very very old...

Man. Life is just strange, sometimes. It seems like shitty things just happen to the most undeserving people. Nothing's what it seems here. I wonder if this is what it feels like to grow up. I've always been so sheltered, and then after Mom and Dad died... everything just fell apart. I didn't know how to deal with it. I still don't. I'm just lucky that I didn't take them often enough to become dependent on my meds. And that I'm used to not eating much-- sick as it may seem, it's served me well out here. 

I really should call Maggie."

"event","I've been thinking about my options. I've had a lot of time to do that, lately. I don't think that's really a good thing. Anyhow, I managed to scrap together some newspaper and a pen (three guesses which was harder to find, and the first two don't count.) So I made myself a list. Pardon the cartoons, it's hard finding blank space in a newspaper.

<u><b>Things I Can Do</b></u>

-be a druggie
-be a drug dealer
-be a whore 
-be a random homeless bum
-beg for money
-be a groupie
-be a raver
-go back to Maggie
-get back on my medication
-get shot
-get mugged
-get raped (and die of AIDS, unless something else kills me first)
-get beat up
-commit suicide
-get a job flipping burgers
-become a super hero
-win the lottery
-get a shower
-get a room
-or at least a nicer bench
-make some <strike>philinthr</strike> philanthropic millionaire take pity on me and give me cash
-get laid. with a <b><u>girl</u></b>

Being a druggie is out cause I don't have money. Being a drug dealer is also out because, again, I don't have money. Not to mention I'm way too naive and stuff and I don't think I could kill somebody, directly or not. The way things are going, I might have to. At least prison has beds. I think. Anyway, I don't want to be a whore. I mean, like, yeah, I've liked guys before <i>like that</i> but I wouldn't want to actually... yeah. Besides, I can't even take my pills without putting them in yogurt or applesauce or something. How the hell would I give a blowjob? Eurgh, let's not talk about that. Okay, let's see... I'm already a random homeless bum. I haven't gotten to the point of begging for cash, but I may as well start. Don't know where I'd find a Sharpie though.

I could be a groupie, but again with the not-wanting-to-fuck-my-way-through-life. I don't know how to dance, and I don't think I'm neon enough to be a raver. Though I probably smell like one by now. I already tried living with Maggie and it didn't work too well. For her, that is. I obviously can't get back on my medication, as I don't have any money and my month's supply is gone. Don't know when I'll see it again. I could get shot, but sounds kinda painful and if an incompetent moron does it, I'll probably have a slow and agonizing death. Whee.

I've already gotten mugged, so no worries there. I hope that guy is better at being Jake Gyllenhaal than I was. I don't want to get raped, because that's disgusting. And AIDS is a slow killer. No to that one. I'm sure if I stick around long enough, I'll get beat up, so I've got that covered. I could commit suicide, but I can't think of a cheap way to do it painlessly. Besides, Maggie would be pissed. I'll come back to that one. I could get a job flipping burgers, if only I had enough money to get into my storage container and get some nice clothes and shave. I've still got a razor in my pocket, but this whole using-a-puddle thing is kinda degrading. 

I'm never going to be a super hero. I'm never going to win the lottery either. I'll just turn into my dad. Plus, winning the lottery takes money. 

I could convince someone to give me a shower, but I think at this point I'm looking kinda scary. Maybe someone will offer one, just to get rid of the stench. Not that I'm going to let anyone close enough to notice. A room requires money. I don't really want to try and get a nicer bench. Scratch that. I <b>do</b> want a nicer bench, I just don't feel like fighting anyone for it. Most of the other guys out here are a lot bigger than me. I'm not a short guy, but they're at least four of me across. I think it'd be wise to just stay put. 

I'm really getting fed up with all the people that walk by, though. They either ignore you, or give you pitying looks. One woman tried to give me a five a few days ago. I turned her down, and she just looked at me like she knew I was new. Maybe she knew that in a week or two, I'd be gladly taking anything I could get. She's probably right. I still have my pride intact, but who knows how long <i>that's</i> gonna last.

Anyway, back to the list. I'm sure a philanthropic millionaire would have better things to do than hang around and befriend me. Again, with the smell. And the lack of shaving. And there's no way I'm going to get laid like this. So, the revised list.

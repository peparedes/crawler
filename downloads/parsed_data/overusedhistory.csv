"event","so, i read in the new that there are fricking exploding toads in germany!!!
they bloat up then spew their guts all over, 
scientists dont know why, they think its birds that peck a hole in all these little bastards to eat their liver. 
the toads then use their defence mechanism and since they have no liver and a hole in them, they basically blow themselves up.
its probably the cooliest thing ive ever read thats true.
see, germany is the best. fuck, thats awesome."

only thing was my back hurt from standing so much lately, but who cares about back problems
shit there was so expensive, i bought my friends a poster each with a set of pins each plus some for myself... $30! and shirts were $25!!! this shit is supposed to be cheap at shows... jeez. so michelle, im sorry i didnt really get you anything cool, you will have to settle for a poster and pins :(


cigarettes are terrible for your health, actually not really,the only lumps in my chest are my nipples. scary thing though, i better not be liking them, i had 4 yesterday, which is bad enough for me. im going to quit on those things, cigars are still sweet though cause they are obviously for the cool people, and all that other jazz is alright with me too.

well the first few days i just sat here on my ass. so nothing to say there. after that i visited westmount for a few days and just hung out with people. then i had the soccer GAME OF MY LIFE. i was having heart attacks in net every 3 seconds it was so tense. i hate that when im keeper. we tied the top team 3-3 and i got the best player hat (yes our team actually has one, its a flaming red hard hat too). oh and i went took the bus downtown to eat lunch with my dad :). peters drive in :):):). then i went to quinns party, it was fun. and sunday i went paintballing with my friends from masters. i didnt get hit that much, and i hit a girl right inbetween the eyes on the mask. and during the free-for-all which also was tense i got hit a bunch on my leg then when i was walking back my friend shot me 2 extra times. but i got him back later. so it was a blast. 

tuesday now, the new hopesfall cd came out. i got it. first day, im such a keener. its really good, even though it sounds nothing like their old stuff. 
but i creamed my pants when i heard it. yes, its amazing.

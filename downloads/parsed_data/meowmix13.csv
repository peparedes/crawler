"event","*****John and his roommates are fine.*****

Their apartment burned down and John lost everything.  I Love NY Pizza in Greensboro is hosting a benefit for them - it's Wed and Thurs (as in today and tomorrow).  There will be donation jars and all of the tips made for those two days will be donated.

This is an ideal opportunity for you to clean out your house, since we're all way too lazy to have yardsales but we all keep shit for the day that we get off of our butts and do it.  John needs everything, from the big stuff (like a bed, dresser, couch, etc.) to the little stuff (flatware, a washcloth, soap, etc.).  I'm quite sure John would appreciate music and comics and the like, too - but I want to make sure he can keep his ass covered and food in his belly.

If you want to donate anything less used and extremely useful, may I suggest gift certificates to department stores and grocery stores.  Lord knows I would rather shop at small shops than big stores, but without the Target and WalMart gift certificates that D and I recieved after our fire, we would never have been able to buy all of the basics.

*This next bit is unnecessary to read unless you want donation ideas.*  The best advice I can give is just to look around at all of the crap you lug from apartment to apartment that you've had forever, so you don't even think about having to replace it.  EXCELLENT EXAMPLES of items that we needed and never really put much thought in to: pillow, toothbrush and toothpaste, blanket, one freaking set of a spoon, knife, and fork, a washcloth and towel, a bar of soap, a bottle of painkiller (<--sheesh, I meant Tylenol, or something!), a table and chair of any sort, a plate, *TOILET PAPER*, a dish rag, an alarm clock, laundry and dish detergent, an ashtray, a phone with phone cord, *CLOTHING*, a lamp, a notebook and pen - the list is evil and long - trying to recollect just what you need to live a rudimentary apartment life gets darn expensive and that doesn't even get in to tools, school supplies, and the like.  Ugg.  Gift certificates are really the jam, though.  That way, he won't end up with 10 microwave ovens and no underwear.

If you have stuff for John and/or his roommates - just contact one of the guys, Paul, me or Russ.

I don't figure I should put their contact info on the net, but mine is:

Beth
cell 919.523.2384
email ecstephenson@comcast.net

If you call and I can't answer, just leave a message and I'll get back to you.  PLEASE leave a number if you leave a message - I still don't have all of my numbers back after our fire.

Love to all and please thank whomever you thank that John and the guys weren't hurt and that belongings are replaceable.

For any of you who give a poo:

I'm in MD now - just above DC and, thankfully, a very short drive from Springfield and Baltimore.  I miss the hell out of San Antonio - it was heaven, musically.  I will be in Raleigh for the weekends, hopefully.  Dad is very sick with cancer and I want to visit him as much as possible.

David is doing very well and graduated phase one of his AIT as the honor graduate; could it have been any other way?  He seems happy except that we both hate the traffic here.  We wanted to be close to the city and we're paying for it now - in more ways that one.

"event","So, my late February visit has been re-scheduled.  I had to drive up here last night to get here today to rescue the insane dog.  I just drove through six states, 23 hours straight, over 1400 miles, to pick up a dog who is currently growling at me and showing me his teeth.  *sigh*

He was supposed to fly down yesterday and mom and dad took him to the airport to ship him to me.  He was fine until they left and when the baggage handlers tried to move his crate, he went crazy and started thrashing around and trying to attack.  He ended up tearing up his gums, nose, and paws on the mesh door of the crate and sprayed blood everywhere.  They decided that the blood was a health hazard and that he's not allowed to fly Delta anymore.  Double *sigh;* I wanted those sky miles.  :)

Mom and dad went and got him back and I had to drive the bumble bee up here to get him.  I'll be in town for a few days and I will be at Legends tomorrow, if anyone wants to hang out again before I leave for more than a week.  (This town really won't let go of you, will it?!?)

Depressingly, I'm missing The Toasters tomorrow night in San An, BUT, I just got happy news that makes me feel better about having to miss one of my favorite ska bands - Assemblage 23, backandtotheleft, and CTRL will be playing 16 April!  w00t!  Have I mentioned that I LOVE the music in Texas?  

Getting to see bands in the oldest dancehall in TX (Gruene Hall, in New Brunfels) is truly amazing.  Seeing carvings on old wooden tables - where Joe proclaimed his love for Bessie BEFORE MY FATHER WAS EVEN BORN IN 1939 - was just fantastic - I can't even describe what this place is like.  You have to see it to believe it.  The music there is so alive and the crowds mix so well and the metal; I can't even begin to tell you - it's just amazing.  And I don't feel old there!  Here, there are so many college kids, I feel like an antique when I'm at a show - there, it is VERY common to see people in their 40's and 50's at all of the shows - regardless of genre!  There are grandparents with their grandchildren - I may have mentioned this before, at the first show we went to - heavy rockabilly - darn near psychobilly - there were an old woman and her husband DANCING TOGETHER, RIGHT IN FRONT, WITH HIS WALKER BETWEEN THEM!!!!  Everyone loves music there - you should come visit and experience it.  I'm nearly teary-eyes just thinking about how influential music has been in my life and how it is for so many people there.  I miss the 80's in Raleigh.  I wish you people new to town or too young to remember could have experienced it.  Everything was so alive.  

See you tomorrow night!

Beth, the TEXAN - heh :)

My belongings arrived today.  Everything I own, in boxes, all over this tiny, hotel room sized apartment is rather frightening to see.  I got out the CD's, set up the stereo and the XM radio, and last, the computer.  I have what I need.

It's cold here - every day it rains.  This is not what I expected from the weather gods.

I've met nice people already but I've been stupid busy and I haven't had time to do much yet.  I have seen music, though.  The music here is incredible.  All of the bands I wished would come to Raleigh are regulars here.  One of the best places I've found to see these marvels is a family hamburger joint.  So odd.

Soulfly, GWAR, The Toasters, Concombre Zombie, Danzig, Cattle Decapitation, and Nile are the upcoming must see shows for the month.  There are tons of others I'll be fitting in as well.  I wouldn't say I'm in music heaven, but I'm so much closer than I was in NC.

David now weighs 20+ pounds more than I do.  Alarming, huh?

Oh, yeah, I had to leave the truck and the car at home, so we bought a BRIGHT YELLOW Dodge Neon.  It has a spoiler and a sport kit and these shiny, shiny rims.  Pictures soon - it's worth it.  :)  f33r my ricer!!!!  w00t!"

Most people take your laid-back attitude, blazing wit and subtle sexiness and stick you in ""friend."" But some see your extreme hotness for what it is and latch on. This means you have a few members of your target sex in the bank at all times -- I call this ""money in the sex bank"" -- but you're too sensitive and thoughtful to exploit them. More than once. 

You are so rational and deliberate in an argument that it can frustrate and exhaust your partner. Your fights can take forever, but your press on with them until they are completely resolved and both you and your partner are satisfied. If your partner is weak of will, s/he may just give in -- be wary of this! An emotional or passive-aggressive outburst later will hurt and horrify you. 

It is *critically important* that you are able to respect your partner. The moment you lose respect for him/her, you lose everything. 

When you make friends, you make them for life -- you can go without speaking to a friend for years and pick up right where you left off. You are completely faithful, both physically and emotionally. You are the second best (to XPIG) parent of any type.

[What were your three favorite bands?] - DK, Dead Milkmen, Bauhaus

[What was your favorite outfit?] - jump boots, camo pants, band shirt, flannel, collar.  Some things never change.  That's either really good or really sad - I'm not sure which.

[What was up with your hair?] - mohawk - usually blue or green, that year.  I think - I can't really remember too clearly.

[Who were your best friends?] - time kind of blends here, too - that year was: David Matthews, Paul Avery, Jobanana, Jeff Miller, Barbie Blankenship, Trevor Cox, Little Don, Big Don, heh - we were family - too many to name.

[What did you do after school?] - work, sleep, things I would rather not mention, but most of you know, homework

[Where did you work?] - The Record Exchange at Mission Valley (when it was still cool :) )

[Did you take the bus?] - To Cary, yes.  To Wake Op, went with Paul.

[Who did you have a crush on?] - Don't think I did - too much of that stuff I don't want to tell about.  Kind of kills that part of you, you know?  Dated Jeff Miller then and Jason Brown (Earthworm) <-- that may have been later - hell, I can't remember anymore.

[Did you fight with your parents?] - every time I spoke to them

[Who did you have a CELEBRITY crush on?] - No idea - some musician, I'm sure.

[Did you smoke cigarettes?] - yes - Camel Lights *shudder*

[Did you lug all of your books around in your backpack all day because you were too nervous to find your locker?] - No - I used the heck out of my locker at Cary.  We didn't have them at Wake Op.

[Did you have a 'clique'?] - band and freaks, I guess.  I got along with everyone but the rednecks - didn't really have a set clique.

[Did you have ""The Max"" like Zach Kelly and Slater?] - I have no idea what The Max is.

[Admit it, were you popular?] - yes, but the younger kids were afraid of me at the start of every year.  lol

[Who did you want to be just like?] - no one *in particular*.  I wanted to be just like everyone who doesn't want to be like everyone else.

[What did you want to be when you grew up?] - An independent record store owner - just like now.  Wow - I really haven't changed in a few ways - that's probably really bad, huh?

[Where did you think you'd be at the age you are now?] - six feet under - I'm still shocked that I lived through that time in my life.  So many of us died."

"event","I don't even know what I want to say here - OK - this is a good intro: 

this year is starting off as a giant, steaming, pile of poo.  Complete, with flies.

***Do you ever find yourself in situations where you NEED to talk about what's going on but the idea of verbalizing what's in your head makes you want to vomit?***

If so, do you have a solution you could let me in on?  

I guess this is really what LJ is for, for me - as an e-journal, anyway.  I get to tell my friends what's going on in my head but I don't actually have to go through the torture of actual conversation about unholy crap.  Heh - does that make me weak?  I don't so much care if it does and I just don't think I could bear the trauma at this time.

My goodness, I would do many, many bad and shameful things for a drink right now (and probably after I had it, but for entirely different reasons - which is precisely why I don't have a farking drink right now - *sigh*).  I still have to wait 'til the 13th or 14th at midnight - I'll have to check with Russ and see which day I made that god-awful promise last month.  If I had had an *inkling* of an idea of the events that were to come, I would never have made that deal.  (Here, commences the listing of painful thoughts:)  <--I just LOVE (please, make note of the sarcastic inflection in my mind) the way the colon and the closing parentheses make a happy smiley face.  Yea.  

The Big Ten, in order of current (obsessive, unhealthy, nightmare inducing) worry:

1.  Don died.  My friend.  One of my boys; more family than family.  He's saved my life, he's shed blood for me, he's taken care of me for years and he's let me take care of him.  (That won't mean anything to anyone on here with one exception and I love you the same way, lady.)  He's been with me through most of my worst and best times.  I couldn't even go to the wake - I can't stand the idea of Don not being in the world.  I'm starting to feel insane just thinking about it.  I can't fathom it.  Do you have any friends you are so bonded to that you can go one day or one year without seeing them and it feels like nothing is any different when you are together again?  He is one of very few people in my life I have that connection with and I don't want to talk about this anymore - I can't deal with it yet.
2.  Kenneth - I *so* can't talk about that yet.
3.  Mom and Dad both had surgeries
4.  The anniversaries of the deaths of my Grandfather and my nephew - the circumstances - unbearable - can't deal with this either.
5.  David and I have no clue what's going on and now he's gone again for another six months.  (Whatever happens with our marriage, he's still my confidant and I, his - this is separation is kicking our asses)  No roommate, no husband, friends dwindling - lonely - my god, this is personal.  If I post this, I'll be surprised.  Still, I purge.
6.  The new year celebrations, where I stood *with water* and watched people drink away all of the garbage in their lives - oh, the seething hatred of drunken morons fills me, or maybe it's just jealousy.
7.  More friends stepping out of my life because I'm ""different now.""  Fucking am I?!?  I think everyone else is *seeing* me differently - I sure as hell don't feel any different, with the exceptions of disappointment in those ""friends"" and an unrelenting stomach ache.
8.  My bank account is getting frightening - I have to find a roommate, pronto - getting to the point where I'm worrying about it constantly.  How is it that, as a student, I had way more money than I have now?  Egad.  Trying to call on lent money is a fucking joke as well, but I knew that getting into any and all of those old situations.  Just thought I would give them a try.
9.  My vitamin levels are all screwed up and something is going wrong in my abdomen - it hurts, fairly intensely, almost constantly and I've kept down maybe - you know what?  Too personal - just feel honored that I let you in to my life this much, if you're still reading and if you give a damn.  That's something I *DO NOT* talk about (and I'm ***really*** not interested in starting now) but I feel the need to say it.  The surgeon wants to reverse my surgery and I'll move to Mexico and hide out before I'll let them take this away from me.  I am *not* going through that hell again.

OK - I'm not listing any more.  This has backfired and is making me feel worse.  I just re-read this garbage and I'm going to post it anyway.  I think.  Maybe.

The rest can be fairly well stated in saying that there are a boatload of people who think they know me, and don't *in the least.*  Conversely, there are a boatload of people I felt like I knew fairly well, and - well, I didn't.  Surprise.  :I

Ugg.

Final happy thoughts?  Let's see:

1.  Jackson is not currently biting or growling at anyone
2.  With no roommate and no one living directly above my bedroom, I can listen to what I want, when I want.  :)  This is cause for great celebration.  Currently, I am blasting Juvenile's ""Back That Azz Up.""  This masterpiece followed Run DMC's ""It's Tricky,"" and precedes KMFDM and Pig's ""Find It, Fuck It, Forget It.""  I can't wait for that gem to begin. :D <-- (no sarcasm here.) 
3.  I can talk, free, to other AT&T, Cingular, and SunCom wireless users - let me know who you are, people.  We have free talking to do.
4.  I'm not dead yet and, if you made it thorough this morass, neither are you.  Yet.  Be joyful about this, please.

w00t.

Camping was very different than I expected but I had a great time.  We just couldn't find a real camping spot at the beach.  We were set up with water, electricity, a bathroom with showers about 30 feet away, and giant RV's on either side.  Not so much camping, it was just a really poopy hotel room, basically.  It was, however, very fun and I can't wait to go to the mountains next.  Roo, this time, we'll actually rough it and we'll get to go hiking.  Oh, and by the way - nipple, baby - I never meant to hurt you.

I had my ears re-pierced at an 8, and immediately stretched to a 6 for these BEAUTIFUL sterling hooks I had to buy.  They hurt but they're worth it - just beautiful.

By the way - Legends is very, very different sober - I now remember why I didn't go there for all the years I wasn't drinking at all.  I love siting in the corner having great conversations but it really is easier to do at someone's house or at the coffee shop.  Yelling over the music makes it a little more difficult for those of us who are losing our hearing.  Seeing D drunkenly headbanging to Ministry made it all worthwhile, though.  :)"

"event","So, I skipped the club because I drink too much and exhaustion was kicking my ass.  Good choice - I spent the night cleaning, dozing, and hanging out with D and Jackson.  Much better :)  

Drunken playfulness is fun but it's fairly new in my life (or new after a 10 year hiatus) and I think I'm doing too much at once.  I'm now getting to the point that I'm finding out surprises about what I did the night before and that probably means that my ""fun"" break should be coming to a close.  The tsk-tsk-tsking of people behind my back has been amusing, though.  Reminds me of why being a teen is such a difficult time in life and why I don't let many people be actually privy to my thoughts.  I haven't been too bad but I've shocked myself three times so I guess I should be drawing this time to a close - guess I'll give myself a few more weeks to live like a dope and go back to the real world.  :)

Speaking of the real world (and how to successfully avoid it), I've made the final decision about my doctoral program.  Against the advice of D, I've chosen to complete my degree accumulation from NCSU.  I will work toward a PhD in school psychology (and I will SO make people call me Dr. Stephenson).  This program is usually completed in five years so all in all, I'll have been in school every year since 1978; that will be 31 years of education plus work experience from the age of 14.  I'll still only be qualified to work in a gas station and to mold the minds of children.  I love this country!  My life goals are to learn everything I can possibly pack into my grey rugae before I die and to disseminate the pickings to kid-lets everywhere, to be President (OK, Senator will do), and to try to be a decent, kind person.  So far, I'm fucking up the decency but I'm still going strong on the crenellation flooding; next job will be working on the accruing of fundage to prove my fairness and worth to represent the masses.  lol - again, I love this country.

Been spending lots of time with Chris lately - he's one of the nicest people I've ever met.  He's made nothing but good impressions on everyone, as far as I can tell.  He's very different than I am and that usually results in not so close friendships for me but he seems to be an exception to the rule.  His perspective is often very refreshing.  Between Chris, Mike, and Bart, being willing to stay with me occasionally, I hopefully will be able to make it through David's extended absence without *entirely* losing my mind.  Thank goodness for close friends and family.

By the way, Ben, I miss you bunches.  Please, let's go to O'Malley's and cap off my binge drinking the right way.

Enough.  I'm tired.

Love to the deserving,

David doesn't get home for two more hours - I'm alone and playing on the computer - doing nothing that matters is a wonderful thing, occasionally.  Maybe I'll go play some games - Onimusha and Tetris are calling me.

I love going to the club and living like I shouldn't.  I need to stop going there and drinking - it's killing my liver and I know it - the old organs don't have forever but it's so much fun and it sure as hell beats sitting as home, waiting for D to come in.  Dancing is great exercise if nothing else.

I love my friends and I am very thankful for my caretakers - thanks again for not letting me do anything I would regret - tonight was wonderful and I had an amazing time.  The club may not be fun in quite a few ways but overall, I have enjoyed my time back there.

David leaves next month - I'm going to have some serious loneliness issues to deal with - I've been with him constantly, just about, for 6 years.

Anyway - serious business - Jen wants to come back to Raleighwood.  We are taking up donations for her to get back down here.  I don't think she needs a ton of money - just enough for gas and the like, I believe.

OK - back to silliness - I got to see Ben and Baby's Arm David last night - that was a blast - they haven't changed much - still beating the crap put of each other and telling lewd stories about the other's mother.  Very amusing - hopefully I'll be getting to see more of them both.

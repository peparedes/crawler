"event","Sunday really sucked, because I had my first hangover.  I had a headache, and vomited about 4 times, not including the one time I vomited the night before.  So I ended up sleeping most of Sunday, which really helped, but the day still sucked, and at the moment, when I think about alcohol, I want vomit."

"event","So, I just acquired a few new games for my PS2, and they are Star Ocean 3: till the end of time, Final Fantsy 5, Final Fantasy 6, and Lord of the Rings: The Third Age.  Right now I am currently playing Star Ocean 3, and I must say that it is awesome.  while I am talking about video games, Jake showed my the tech demo for the redone Final Fantasy 7 coming out, or hopefully coming out, for the PS3, and I must say that after watching it, I truely wanted to have an orgasm right then and their.  When it comes out, I think that their never be a game that will even come close to being as god like as FF7, because not only will it have an excellent storyline, but it will have orgamsiuc graphics to boot.  So the I am going to get the PS3, even if it is $500, or so I heard, for the purpose of playing FF7."

Verse 1

Damn it feels good to be a gangsta
A real gangsta-ass nigga plays his cards right
A real gangsta-ass nigga never runs his fuckin mouth
Cuz real gangsta-ass niggas don't start fights
And niggas always gotta high cap
Showin' all his boys how he shot em
But real gangsta-ass niggas don't flex much
Cuz real gangsta-ass niggas know they got em
And everythings cool in the mind of a gangsta
Cuz gangsta-ass niggas think deep
Up three-sixty-five a year 24/7
Cuz real gangsta ass niggas don't sleep

And all I gotta say to you
Wannabe, gonnabe, cocksuckin', pussy-eatin' prankstas
Cuz when the fry dies down what the fuck you gonna do
Damn it feels good to be a gangsta

Verse 2

Damn it feels good to be a gangsta
Feedin' the poor and hepin out wit they bills
Although I was born in Jamaica
Now I'm in the US makin' deals
Damn it feels good to be a gangsta
I mean one that you don't really know
Ridin' around town in a drop-top Benz
Hittin' switches in my black six-fo'
Now gangsta-ass niggas come in all shapes and colors
Some got killed in the past
But this gangtsa here is a smart one
Started living for the lord and I'll last

Now all I gotta say to you
Wannabe, gonnabe, pussy-eatin' cocksuckin' prankstas
When the ship jumps off what the fuck you gonna do
Damn it feels good to be a gangsta

Verse 3

Damn it feels good to be a gangsta
A real gangta-ass nigga knows the play
Real gangsta-ass niggas get the flyest of the bitches


Click to learn more...
CLICK ABOVE TO VISIT OUR SPONSORS

Ask that gangsta-ass nigga Little Jake
Now bitches look at gangsta-ass niggas like a stop sign
And play the role of Little Miss Sweet
But catch the bitch all alone get the digit take her out
and then dump-hittin' the ass with the meat
Cuz gangsta-ass niggas be the gang playas
And everythings quiet in the clique
A gangsta-ass nigga pulls the trigger
And his partners in the posse ain't tellin' off shit
Real gangsta-ass niggas don't talk much
All ya hear is the black from the gun blast
And real gangsta-ass niggas don't run for shit
Cuz real gangsta-ass niggas can't run fast
Now when you in the free world talkin' shit do the shit
Hit the pen and let the mothafuckas shank ya
But niggas like myself kick back and peep game
Cuz damn it feels good to be a gangsta

Verse 4

And now, a word from the President!
Damn it feels good to be a gangsta
Gettin voted into the White House
Everything lookin good to the people of the world
But the Mafia family is my boss
So every now and then I owe a favor gettin' down
like lettin' a big drug shipment through
And send 'em to the poor community
So we can bust you know who
So voters of the world keep supportin' me
And I promise to take you very far
Other leaders better not upset me
Or I'll send a million troops to die at war
To all you Republicans, that helped me win
I sincerely like to thank you
Cuz now I got the world swingin' from my nuts
And damn it feels good to be a gangsta"

Atleast, that's what people<br>think. Even if you don't care that much for<br>your victims, you still have the ability to<br>care and to generally feel. It is not lost,<br>just a little forgotten. In crowds you tend to<br>not get to noticed, and dress in black or other<br>discrete colours. You don't being in the<br>spotlight and wish people would just leave you<br>alone. But once you do get close to someone you<br>have a hard time letting go and get real down<br>if you loose him/her.<br><br><b>Main weapon:</b> Sniper<br><b>Quote:</b> ""The walls we build around<br>us to keep out the sadness also keep out the<br>joy"" -Jim Rohn<br><b>Facial expression:</b> Narrowed eyes</p>

"event","I have some great quotes for you people to read.  The first one is from Oscar Wilde
""Self-denial is the shining sore on the leprous body of Christianity.""

And, the second one is from Albert Einstein
""Only two things are infinite, the universe and human stupidity, and I'm not sure about the former.""

These two quotes are so very true, and in my opinion they, in a way, are related, because Christians, or least the highly devout Christians, are stupid.  But, that is only my opinion."

The wretched King Minos has decided your fate. His tale wraps around his body 6 times.
The sweet light no longer strikes against your eyes. Your shade has been banished to... the Sixth Level of Hell - The City of Dis!

Sixth Level of Hell - The City of Dis

You approach Satan's wretched city where you behold a wide plain surrounded by iron walls. Before you are fields full of distress and torment terrible. Burning tombs are littered about the landscape. Inside these flaming sepulchers suffer the heretics, failing to believe in God and the afterlife, who make themselves audible by doleful sighs. You will join the wicked that lie here, and will be offered no respite. The three infernal Furies stained with blood, with limbs of women and hair of serpents, dwell in this circle of Hell.

that makes me happy."

"event","Time to update my journal.  I haven't updated it in a while, so I figured I might as well do it, or someone I know will get on my case about it.  I was in Florida last week, specifically Orlando.  It was a great trip, except for that fact that it rained on us everyday except the last day.  Last Thursday, I had a rendezvous with Captain Morgan and Bacardi.  That was a great night, and no I did not have a hang over the next morning or vomit.  Let see, I had about a quarter of a bottle of Captain Morgan, and a bottle and a half of Bacardi.  The only bad part about the trip was the bus ride.  36 hours on a bus is not fun, especially if you are trying to sleep.  The that I enjoyed the most about the trip was when we went this place called the Medieval Times for dinner.  There we where lords and ladies and were seated in a stadium, where we had dinner, which we ate like they did in the Medieval times, while watching a jousting tournament.  That was an awesome night also.  So yeah, thats about all I can think to type about.  KE KE KE KE!"

"event","I would just like to make this clear about myself, and this is also in response to the James's lj about Sony incorporating the ability to order pizza online while playing Everquest 2.  I have given up all hope on humanity, its just going down the shitter.  We dont seem to realize that tearing down rainforests is actually a bad thing. 
  I know that this makes me sound like a cold hearted bastard, but I didn't the Tsunami disaster.  I thought it was their own fault for living in that part of the world, and that their was more then enough people living there
  I also view humanity as the aliens from Independence Day, because all we are doing is sucking up the resources of this planet, killing it, and when it dies, we will just move on to another planet, and the process will start all over.  So, I think we are just a plague on this world."

The whole time we were playing, I just wanted to get the hell out of there.  Dungeons and Dragons this morning was awesome.  You cannot go wrong with a chaotic neutral party.  God that was so much fun.  We need to keep that campaign alive.  I thought we were goona die trying to kill that Captain.  I was waiting for someone to make a terrible roll.  
But, nobody did and we killed him and it was all good.  So.....ke ke ke ke!"

I've always known that life sucks, but i just had to say.  Other than that, in FF10, I fought Biran and Yenke Ronso, with just Kimahri today. Jake, you were wrong about that battle being hard, I thought it was more of just a pain in the ass, and it took way to long.  But going up Mount Gagazet, that I f***in hated.  And thats it for my rant for today."

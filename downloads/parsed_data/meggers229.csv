"event","You Know You're From Illinois When... 
You know if someone is from southern, middle or northern Illinois as soon as they open their mouth. 

When you say ""the city"" - you mean Chicago. 

You think ethanol makes your truck ""run a lot better."" 

You know what's knee-high by the Fourth of July. Stores don't have bags; they have sacks. 

All the festivals across the state are named after a fruit, vegetable, grain, or animal. 

You think of the major four food groups as beef, pork, soddie, and Jell-O salad with marshmallows. 

You know what ""cow tipping"" and ""snipe hunting"" is. 

You spent a good deal of your high school nights hanging out at DQ. 

""Vacation"" means going to Six Flags. 

You don't pronounce the ""S"" in Illinois like the rest of the world. 

Whenever anyone mentions going out for steak, the first place you think of is Ponderosa. 

You know more than one person with a septic tank. 

You pronounce the invisible ""R"" in the word wash. 

Down south to you means Kentucky 

You have no problem spelling or pronouncing ""Des Plaines"" 

You think Chicago is a completely different state from Illinois. 

You know the answer to the question, ""Is this Heaven?"" 

You know where all the Yoders live 

Detassling was your first job 

You've ever been on a ""Geode Hunt"" 

Your idea of a really great tenderloin is when the meat is twice as big as the bun and accompanied only by ketchup and a dill pickle slice 

You learn your pickup will run without a muffler 

When asked how your trip was to any foreign, exotic place, you say, ""It was different."" 

You consider being called a ""Pork Queen"" an honor 

People from other states love to hear you say ""Illinois"" and other words with ""Os"" in them. 

Your dream vacation is a trip to Rock Home Gardens 

You drink ""pop."" 

You actually get these jokes and pass them on to other friends from Illinois."

"event","1. Take your LJ username and replace each letter with the corresponding number (A=1, B=2, etc...). If your name contains numbers, you'll need to convert them to letters first before you can convert to numbers.

2. Add all of the numbers together to create a kind of super number. 

3. Make a note of the first digit of this number, then add the digits of the number together. 

4. Find the post of this number in your LJ. If you don't have that many posts, add the digits together again. Keep doing so until the number is smaller than your pathetic number of posts. 

5. Take the digit you noted in step 3, and count that many words into the post. 

6. Use the resulting word in a Google Image Search, and select a picture from the first page. Post the results for us all to see!

"event","ive heard this song on the radio a few times now and i found myself oddly attracted to it.  i was surprised to find out it was by britney...i guess it grew on me a bit.

<i>Notice me 
Take my hand 
Why are we 
Strangers when 
Our love is strong 
Why carry on without me? 

Everytime I try to fly 
I fall without my wings 
I feel so small 
I guess I need you baby 
And everytime I see you in my dreams 
I see your face, you're haunting me 
I guess I need you baby 

I make believe 
That you are here 
It's the only way 
I see clear 
What have I done 
You seem to move on easy 

Everytime I try to fly 
I fall without my wings 
I feel so small 
I guess I need you baby 
Everytime I see you in my dreams 
I see your face, you're haunting me 
I guess I need you baby 

I may have made it rain 
Please forgive me 
My weakness caused you pain 
And this song is my sorry 

At night I pray 
That soon your face 
Will fade away 

Everytime I try to fly 
I fall without my wings 
I feel so small 
I guess I need you baby 
And everytime I see you in my dreams 
I see your face, you're haunting me 
I guess I need you baby</i>"

thank you pete for laughing at me when i have no idea why:)

today after 1215, i am officially done with my sophomore year. the past two years have gone by so fast, almost as if its a dream and i just woke up.  im excited its over, but just yesterday it hit me...im sad that ill have to be away from so many great people over the summer. there was a time last nite, where just for a moment, i was filled with sadness. thats so unlike me...but it made me realize that i have made good friends with some people here, and although the next few months may bring us to different places in our lives, i hope each of them will still have room for me. :) youre <b>all</b> amazing; thank you for all the memories.

Nobody knows there
Nobody shows where</lj-cut>

in other news....this has been one <lj-cut text=""crazy"">Come my lady
Come come my lady
You're my butterfly
Sugar baby

Come my lady
Come come my lady
You're my butterfly
Sugar baby

Such a sexy, sexy pretty little thing
Fierce nipple pierce you got me sprung with your tongue ring
And I ain't gonna lie cause your loving gets me high
So to keep you by my side, there's nothing that I won't try
Butterflies in her eyes and the looks to kill
Time is passing I'm asking could this be real?
Cause I can't sleep, I can't hold still
The only thing I really know is she got sex appeal

I can feel, too much is never enough
You're always there to lift me up when these times get rough
I was lost, now I'm found
Ever since you've been around
You're the women that I want
So yo I'm putting it down

Come my lady
Come come my lady
You're my butterfly
Sugar baby

Come my lady
Yo my pretty baby
I'll make your legs shake
You make me go crazy

Come my lady
Come come my lady
You're my butterfly
Sugar baby

Come my lady
Yo my pretty baby
I'll make your legs shake
You make me go crazy

I don't deserve you
Unless it's some kind of hidden message
To show me life is precious
Then I guess it's true
But to tell truth I really never knew till I met you
See I was lost and confused
Twisted and used up
Knew a better life existed but thought that I missed it

My lifestyle's wild, I was living like a wild child
Trapped on a short leash paroled the police files
So yo what's happening now? 
I see the sun breaking in through dark clouds 
And a vision of you, standing out in a crowd

Come my lady
Come come my lady
You're my butterfly
Sugar baby

Come my lady
Yo my pretty baby
I'll make your legs shake
You make me go crazy

Come my lady
Come come my lady
You're my butterfly
Sugar baby

Come my lady
Yo my pretty baby
I'll make your legs shake
You make me go crazy

Hey sugar momma, come and dance with me
The smartest thing you ever did was take a chance with me
Whatever tickles your fancy
Girl it's me and you like Sid and Nancy
So sexy, almost evil
Talkin' about butterflies in my head
I used to think that happy endings were only in the books I read
But you made me feel alive when I was almost dead

You filled that empty space with the love I used to chase
And as far as I can see it don't get better than this
So butterfly here is a song and it's sealed with a kiss 
And a thank you miss

Come my lady
Come come my lady
You're my butterfly
Sugar baby

Come my lady
Yo my pretty baby
I'll make your legs shake
You make me go crazy

Come my lady
Come come my lady
You're my butterfly
Sugar baby

Come my lady
Yo my pretty baby
I'll make your legs shake
You make me go crazy

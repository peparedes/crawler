"event","<marquee>Happy new year</marquee>
My new year was exciting. Went out last night. Didnt really drink. I was being good..haha. I was probably the only one who didn't. Had to watch my little cousin today. Then hung out with karen. Watched Family Guy. Thats all I do. Either that or go to Local concerts. There is alot of good conerts around here, its a pretty big city. I love living in the city. It is so full of things to do. You are rarely bored.
But lately i've been getting tired of the city. Seeing the same things over and over again. Oh well I usually have something to do, if not I'll find something.
Happy New year..yay

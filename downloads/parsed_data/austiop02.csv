Since last update I have finished my time at AMDA, glad it's over but now I am back in Fairhope figuring out what the hell to do with my life. Why didn't I stay in NYC??? I know right, well it's called money and I didn't have a job nor did I have an apartment, so I came back to help my parents out in the financial department.  I haven't found a job here yet, although I did see where Home Depot is hiring, and I could possibly be working alongside a future olympic athlete, but the chances are highly unlikely in Daphne, AL.  Anyway, so yeah I'm back here and don't know where to go from here. I am however auditioning for UT this coming weekend so thats cool. 

I think I am gonna move to LA in the fall if school doesnt work out for me. Sound good? I have really been wanting to do that so we shall see...

Anyway, im off."

So what is new in my life? Not toooo much. Went home for labor day weekend, was a very nice break. Weather change here in ny has sucked ass, I think I am now getting sick as my throat begins to get more scratchy every minute, woohoo!  I am seeing Sigur Ros tm which I am incredibly excited about.  There was a really bad murder a block from me: some boyfriend came into a nail salon, shot and killed his girlfriend and killed himself, nice eh?  There were people standing outside the place like all day, i say, get a life.  Annnnd yeah, I dunno what else is really new. School is of course kicking my arse and I can't wait for it to be over and begin 4th semester already.  VPS (Voice and Speech) is so ridiculous this semester and it is stressing me out for stupid reasons.  I guess I will go now and memorize a good ole monologue by Christopher Fry!!"

So yeah, that was surely interesting, and now I have his number so I kinda wanna call him, hehe.

Well classes are going well, very very busy this semester but that's good.  I like my group, no divas or anything, mainly laid back people which is nice.  I got my solo song which is from Light in the Piazza. I don't think Im gonna do it though, b/c the score hasn't been released yet, so maybe my teacher can find the music! Speaking of that show, I finally saw it. Amazing, amazing, amazing. Everryone needs to see it, it's what all broadway shows should be.  I also got my duet assigned, it's from some crazy ass cult film called ""King of Hearts.""  I am excited about it though, and my partner.

So what else is new........

I have a date! His name is Chris and we met this past weekend at a party. He's really cute and reeeeeeal nice, so let's hope it works out.  I would really like to finally find a freakin bf for once in my life. hehe.

I started classes monday with a whole new group. I felt like I was back in 1st semester, not knowing anyone and all.  My new classes are good and I like my teachers, minus being scared of Pearson!, but oh how there's soooo much work.  Already I have been studying non-stop this week and if this is only the first week then I might just die all other weeks.

My group's good though, many hispanics.  I am starting to feel comfortable with all of them so that's good.

I don't know what to do on July 4th, hmmmmmmmmmmmm. And I wanna see War of the Worlds real bad for some reason, although Tom Cruise annoys the heeeeeeeeellll out of me.

saturday: didn't do much during the day, just hung out, it was rainy. Saw Amityville Horror, really scary and surprisngly good. Went to eat at Cafe Lola afterwards, mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.

I went to Central park saturday and just walked around with my friend Kendra, I also took cool pictures and I wish I could post them but I don't know how to, DOES ANYONE KNOW? I think I asked this before but i forgot how to do it.  I also watched the movie ""Dancer in the Dark,""  and omg, what an amazing movie. I loved the music in it and Bjork was a great actress which suprised me. I recommend everyone see it, now!

So this week will be a busy one, but a good one I think. Tomorrow I have to go to this Art Exhibit in which Puccini will have this opera. I was excited, but now it's jsut stressing me out, of course. I think I will be glad I went though.  I also am seeing Georgia Ann on friday most likely! I am so excited, im gonna go to Philly to see her bc of some school trip, it will be fun.

I got to my first class just at the nick of time, god I'm good, I had to do my scene in acting--I totally blew!! well I didn't blow, it was my scene Partner who blew the big one. I got bored a little and thought the teacher was going to yell at me! But he didn't, whew..falling asleep in sight singing was pretty funny you COULD say, alright alright, yeah it was funny (lol) I had a dream that I was a rat in the subway and some guy threw a french fry at me to eat..I woke up squeeking and sucking on my yellow pencil--the whole class laughed at me, but it wasn't that ""haha nerd!!"" sort of laugh, it was that ""haha you're cool and funny"" sort of laugh. Yes!! So then I went home, and my dear room mate locked me in the Closet!! I couldn't think I was so scared and mad. Errr! C'est La Vie! lol! Here I am, I'm proud to be who I am, bye everybody!!

"event","Well, 2nd semester starts tomorrow. I guess Im ready for it, but I feel kinda unprepared. I had a good break though, minus the ""gay"" gangster, being stalked, and getting a ticket for feeding a french fry to a rat. Sounds interesting huh?

Anyway, I am gonna try my hardest this new term, and i shall succeed!!

I don't really know what else to say, nothing too exciting going on right now. its snowing and some of the snow is coming into my room right now, always nice.

Oh yeah, and why is it that guys are so stupid?"

I am doing really well. I just moved into my new apartment with Spencer and Michael. Ok, at first I was so scared i would hate it so much, but I love my new apartment now. We got it cleaned and it looks so comfty and cool. Plus theres so much room. 

Good ole V-day is tomorrow and I fuckin hate it. every year its the same thing, I'm always hating it. I guess i wouldnt if I had someone, but still, i think its really pointless.

but anyway, I am gonna go now and read or listen to music. Out!"

"event","So Demos (finals for you non-AMDA people) started today.  I had acting and individual voice today. Both went really well and I was barely nervous so thats good. I just really want to get them all over with, but I am so glad I only have one make up class tomorrow and it's at freakin 4:30 biotches!

Tonight me, Shannon, and Jenna decided to go down to the West Village to just walk around and get some coffee. I have to say this is my favorite part of Manhattan so far. I loved it. It was really unique and old and really inspired me in an odd way. It was so nice to get coffee at this cool cafe and just talk and get my mind off of school shit. I really wanted to write and read after tonight. Also maybe smoke a fag while at it...."

"event","Highlights of my day:

1. Having my stupid ass scene partner ""tell"" on me at the end of class. Funny thing is she didn't know i was standing there when she did this. How old are we again?
2. Seeing Kelly Ripa, even though she annoys the fuck out of me. 
3. Getting the Thrills album

And yeah, random, but oh well.

I have come to realize i need to not care about boys and finding a boyfriend and all that shit.  So far its working well, but who knows....

Finals are coming up this week and the next. I can't wait for them to be over with and I can move into my new apartment. yay!"

"event","Wow, i haven't updated in a real long time it seems. Well lets recap on whats new shall we.....

I have less than 2 weeks until this semester is finally over, and thank god. I can;t wait to begin the next semester and start new again with new classes and especially new dance classes, and hopefully i wont be in level 1.  I also can;t wait to move into my new huge apartment, well big not huge, where i will have my own kitchen and all. Ahhhhh, how nice.

So nyc also got hit by a huge blizzard this past weekend and we got like over 2 feet of snow. It was crazy and i never have experienced anything like that before. But it was so nice to go play in central park and all.

I feel like I have grown so much over this past year, even less than this past year. I just was thinking about it the other day. I mean i am living in NYC pretty much on my own, its a huge step i never thought i could take, but im doing it and loving it. Ok ill shutup now.

Anyway, goodnight, gots to get up early for yoga!"

The only thing that is so annoying is not having a guy to be with, a.k.a. a boyfriend. I have yet to find anyone. Zach proved to be an unreliable choice, but whatever, life will go on.

I am going to bed now and I am glad, i get to sleep until 9:30. And it's friday!"

"event","<P>So I thought I could get a new cell phone, but no. Why, you ask? Because after spending 2 hours trying to figure out which one to get, how much to spend and what features I want, I realized, I already have a nice phone, even though its old and doesnt have a camera and is all scratched up, but each scratch is a memory and why ditch a phone who has treated me so well over the years? besides it still has the little nail polish heart we added back in the day. Change is not for me and I am not up for change, and so I will not be a sell out and will keep my old AT&amp;T cellular, which really is a rarity. </P>

"event","People I dont even know bother me. I dont know how, but I look at them and just want to like shut them up. I met this girl today at training and she was just so smiley and enthusiastic and excited and I should be happy that shes happy but Im annoyed by her. I wonder if she ever has a bad day. Or stops smiling her goofy smile. I just know by the end of the thing I wanted to talk to someone not so smiley and in love with life. And thats weird I think, why should she bother me? She wasn't mean to me nor did anything to offend me, she was just there... smiling and so... happy. And Im not saying im not happy or that I don't smile, it just really bothered me that nothing would bring her down. And the same thing happened in orgo, there was this one girl who just loved it, and would laugh at all the professors jokes and was so ecstatic to be in class that her presence just annoyed me, and Im sure she was a very nice person if I got to know her, but her optimism just grossed me out.

"event","<P>I'm weak in the knees. </P>
<P>And I missed the OC. That makes me sad. Real sad. I knew I wouldn't be able to see it live cuz we ended up leaving later than I expected because I have a zillion and one things and an itty bitty car and cuz we stopped to get pizza cuz i was weak in the knees. And so I knew I wouldnt be able to see it, so I called home and asked my sister to tape it. And she agreed. And when we returned, there was still like half an hour left. But I didnt watch it. Because my sister said it was taping. But no. So I didnt watch any of it. And wicky said it was a good one. A really good one. Who would've known a 16 year old is incapable of putting it on channel five and pressing the big red button. And so I missed the OC. And that makes me sad. </P>
<P>And I miss my former orange haired roomate. And my my size friend. And watching the OC with wicky poo (who was always able to find the big red button when I couldn't make the date). And i miss the ho bag. And its only been&nbsp;a few&nbsp;hours. </P>
<P>And my eyes are still broken.&nbsp;They're never going to get fixed. First no contacts. Then&nbsp;contacts&nbsp;24/7. Then only&nbsp;sleep in contacts and glasses during the day (which didnt work out cuz the contacts burn when&nbsp;I put them in).&nbsp;And&nbsp;now I'm supposed to see a corneologist.&nbsp;</P>
<P>My grandma looked at my hair and asked me what I did to it. She said I ruined my hair and its going to turn white now cuz dye strips your hair's color. My mom said it matched my shirt (which is orange). Which is really weird cuz my mom saw me after I first dyed it. </P>
<P>Some people here don't really have their heads screwed on completely. And that bothers me because I'm not always a patient person. </P>

I hate your

I think it will

and i dont know why.




I decided to eat less junk food, cuz i found that thats like all i eat and i eat when im not even really hungry. But today doesnt count cuz i ate a lot of not good for me stuff.

I think i just took it all for granted cuz like I eat crap and ive never really been obese, but thats not like good for me, whats to say that i wont have my arteries all clogged up from all the junk I eat and have a heart attack at like 30? And apparently its in my family from both sides so thats all the more reason. 

And so is diabetes, which is great cuz i eat like a bag of chocolate a day cuz im addicted. And I really think i am cuz I have like withdrawl headaches. I dont think id be able to ever really stop eating chocolate. I tried to go one day without it over break, and I really couldnt do it.

I initially wanted to cut out the junk food, but i realized thats not going to happen, sometimes I just crave it. We'll see how long this lasts."

"event","why cant people ever be on time? Is it that hard to look at a watch and
say hmm its 8 50, i have to be somewhere at 9... maybe i should leave
now... I understand the occasional delay, but some people are always late
everywhere. Maybe you should tell people that by 9 you reall mean 9 30.

Maybe its a cultural thing for me that people need to come late but thats
a pain in the ass and tardy people are entirely selfish. They come when
it's appropriate for them, with no regard to other people and their
schedules. Hi, we have better things to do than sitting around waiting for
you. I feel like i should tell people to show up for things earlier than
they have to cuz only then will they be on time.

This isnt directed at anyone, so dont get offended, ive realized that im
always on time while no one else is, and im sick of it. Should i start
coming late to things just cuz everyone else is? No, you all should be
more punctual. If something starts at 4, be there at 4 not 4 30 or
whenever is convenient for you. 

Im not saying Im the most punctual person ever, there are times when I will be late, and an occasional tardiness isn't horrible, but its people who are always late and think its okay that bother me."

and im very fickle... the more i get to know ppl the more i like find flaws in them... not to say i dont like them anymore, but that i find that theyre not like who i want them to be... which isnt always a bad thing.

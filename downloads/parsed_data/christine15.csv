And there is not enough time to tell you what has been going on but,
Michelle and I turn 21 this Wednesday.

I really have never been more exited and ready for anything in my life. Truly ready.
Ready to be older and to be more mature.
I need a turning point soon. And i think this might be the start."

"event","Michelle and I have been going to church on a regular basis since after Christmas break. Every Sunday and Wednesday. The reason is because I hit rock bottom, literally. And there was no way out. God was my only choice.  He gave me an outlet and he has changed my life in so many unbelievable ways.

So today Michelle and I were working out and Tina this girl that goes to church religiously at the worship service on campus on Wednesday came up to us and was talking to us.

Guess what she said to us....
She told Michelle and I that she has heard alot of people talking about us. Good talk she said. So we asked her what was said and she said that people were talking about how beautiful Michelle and I are on the outside. And how we were not only beautiful on the outside but when we talked, the words we spoke were beautiful. We were beautiful on the inside and outside she said. 

My heart has never smiled so big.

""Love like you've never been hurt, sing like no one's listening, dance like nobody's watching, and live like it's heaven on earth."" 
And that's exactly what I'm doing. Living for Him. Living for my happiness."

I finaly got closure yesterday on this one situation.
It wasn't exactly what I wanted but I expected it.
I just needed to find out.
And I did.
I'm not going to lie, it hurts.
But now I can start to deal with the facts not just the theories.
I still don't know all the things I wanted to know.

I just can't believe that one person would lie so much.
Their lying was selfish.
But for them, I think it was natural.
They not only lied but cheated and manipulated me.
All for their own benefit.
Fucker.
I know I am better than that, I deserve better.


On a lighter note:
I am so excited to start school.
To start over in a way.
To be on my own.
To meet new people.
I can't wait to see how my running will turn out.
Basically, I am exited about my life right now.
I am satisfied with the things I have and even with the things I don't have.
The last few weeks have been rough but it has made me much stronger.
I am able to be me and stand up for myself.
I am happy with who I am and who I am becoming.
It has taken a while to be happy with who I am.
Now, I have no regrets."

"event","The investigation is at a standstill. The police are no longer cooperating with me and seem to be more concerned with their own personal agendas than catching a wanted criminal wanted for several counts of murder. Even if this person isn't 'human', I believe they should still be judged and sentenced, it's the only way justice will ever be served. <br /><br />Unrelated to the case, Halloween is approaching. Watari, do you think I am too old to go trick-or-treating? <strike>I haven't decided on a costume yet. I contemplated going as a marshmallow but such a costume would restrict my ability to move too much so my trick-or-treating would be impared.</strike>"

"event","The police department in New Sanctum haven't been particularly effective in upholding the law lately and violent crime has been increasing for some time now, though I believe the government was attempting to keep that quiet. Little good it will do them now. 

My observations of the present situation have so far produced very little, but I believe that the existence of demons at this moment in time is highly plausible if not logical, it makes sense to me that there are beings with far greater power than humanity and at this moment in time I find myself questioning whether we as human beings really have the moral high ground over these creatures. 

I feel it's best not to think about it.

It doesn't seem as though my investigations are leading me anywhere, people are still dying and justice is not being served but there are far too many incidents to devote my entire attention to and right now it feels like I am fighting a losing battle.

I hate losing.

Hermione, if you learn anything about these 'Wraiths' please let me know, it is very important."

"event","I am beginning to question Watari's judgement on this whole 'going out and socializing' business. The chance of something peculiar happening whenever I leave the hotel has risen to 99.5% after previous events. There are a number of things I have seen in the past month that has made me question the way I currently view the world, until recently I had never believed that Ghosts or Poltergiests even existed though logically it is plausible that they would on some level. Unfortunately whilst this discovery is interesting it doesn't help me deduce what has been happening in the city lately. <strike>Nor who Kira is and where he could be right now.</strike><br /><br />With my predictions at 99.5% that something will happen if I leave the safety of my hotel room again, it is highly likely I will find out more information if I start to ask around, though this course of action is risky for several reasons and it is more likely that it will just raise further questions, but so far these strange events are the only leads I have.<br /><br />...Watari, you promised me chocolate cake for all this 'going out and socializing' business. Where is it?"

"event","Watari was quite worried when I returned to the hotel with minor electrical burns, I didn't want to tell him what happened because I know that would make him worry and feel unnecessary guilt since he encouraged me to go outside more often.

Hei, that was quite painful and savage. It wasn't nice.

Recording events for the online community to see still seems like a big security risk to me, so i'm not going to risk entering important information since there is a 23.8% chance that someone will hack this journal and use the data to their advantage."

"event","People have been reporting strange occurances ever since that day when it rained, admissions into hospital have sharply increased and it appears that so has the demand for over-the-counter drugs such as aspirin and weak sleeping pills. <br /><br />Theoretically speaking, I believe that this could be linked with <i>Kira</i>. He has already demonstrated that he has the ability to control certain factors before death, but could he have the power to control nature as well? I must admit, this theory doesn't seem very plausible, 5% at the most, but I can't dismiss it either as it could very well lead me straight to <i>Kira</i>.<br /><br />Then there is the theory that this is something entirely unrelated to <i>Kira.</i> Currently this theory stands at a 95% probability, but I need to learn more about this strange rain and what caused it before I can continue working on this theory. To do that, I need to find some people who have been afflicted. In a city like this, it shouldn't be too difficult."

"event","I am beginning to think I am rather out of touch with the rest of the population, perhaps Watari's comments about spending all this time cooped up in a dreary hotel room with my computer damaging my social skills are true, that or I just happen to keep running into some rather strange people, like Sakura.&nbsp;Not that they aren't nice, but they act suspiciously, I get the feeling I may have already bumped into Kira already without even knowing it. But even though the odds are stacked up against me, i'll beat him at this game and pick him out of the crowd so I can bring him to justice."

"event","<p>Television is known for decieving people in order to get more ratings, in a sense that is what makes it such a useful form of media for the police to use when they are reporting on new or existing criminals, but monsters rampaging throughout the city? I'm afraid I really must see this with my own eyes. <strike>Besides, we're out of cake :(</strike></p>"

"event","So this is one one of those <em>Live Journal</em> things I have been hearing so much about. It is rather interesting to know that I could be communicating with anyone across the whole of New Sanctum without ever having to leave my hotel room, I probably should have looked into something like this sooner, but the security of most blogging websites had always been rather questionable.&nbsp; <br /><br />This could be quite a useful tool, if used in the correct manner, i'll have to look into what other features this site has to offer (though, I do have to wonder what FRANK is and why he keeps saying 'BAAAAH'). Is it some kind of hidden message or just internet speak I am unfamiliar with?"

"event","Shes stuck behinde his beautiful eyes,his ever loveing smile.Night by night day by day she loves him more each day.He cheats and lies,she stays and cries how much more can she take?She never would have thought his love for her was fake.Slowly but surely his secret life she uncovers.He secretly FUCKED to girls under the covers.He lies and say his love for her has not been tanted,that he has not touched ,looked ,kissed another girl.Boy did her life take a twirl!Her life,love filled with happiness,is now completely filled with darkness.He comes crawling back on his hands and knees,begging her to take him back please!She looks into his beautiful eyes as a tear rolls down her cheak.Her heart beats,then skips a beat with every deep breath she takes.Getting ready and prepared to say,that her love for him will never stay!

tell me what you think,i just wrote it.

um,dont know whats going on but havent seen my bestfriend in a long long time.thinks she's mad at me?but who knows cause she neveer picks up her phone when i call her.but i still love her,and miss her alot!

last night whent to the galleria!
we were chased by security guards`and got kicked out the movies it was soo funny!had alot of fun.but some sad moments.almost lost someone,but relized we had something to good to give up.and i overreact to some things!

you always wish your relationship will be the perfect one.but no  relations are.everyone fights,but in the end you relize how much that person means to you,and the dumbest fight means nothing.
love

really mean it.
Mess around with other females and
bring home unwanted diseases.
She cries and cries her emotions are
at a total low.
She tries to leave you, but her heart
is saying, ""NO!""
Now with AIDS, sad, 2 kids, dumb
but in love.
You continuing to do her wrong, and
again her heart is crushed.
She's not takin the pain this time, not
again.
She calls her thugged out bro. and his 
crazy a$$ friends!
The next day in tears, cryin her heart
out, but happy.
Because the person on T.V. dead is her
baby's daddy!

The Feel

Love can be expressed through
many feelings and emotions.
This feel cannot be forced, or 
gained with trick potions.
Love can be the greatest feeling
in the world.
Love can also be the destruction
of your world.
Love has a number of positive 
and negative effects.
Relationship, depression, 
foolishness or even a ""PECK!""
I don't know why this feeling is
like this w/ me.
But i know this is a feeling that 
overpower me!!!!!!!!!!

Good & Bad
Beautiful like flowers or a shot from 
a NBA star.
The love i have for you is by highest 
the far.

Pretty, outstanding, loving, and great 
is what you are to me.
Being with you forever is my destiny, 
that i'm destined to achieve.

Not understanding the magnitude of 
the feel of my emotions. 
So y do i even tell?
You don't feel the same way, you don't 
care,  or love me, so go to hell!!


I know my words sound harsh, but 
this is the way i feel.
I wasn't meant to be your Jack an 
you were meant to be Jill! 
Bonnie and Clyde, Ride or Die!

I wrote this poem thinking of 
happiness, and a good feeling, 
knowing there will not an ""us!""

Close to me you're like my sister, 
Close to me you're like my brother 
You are the only one my everything and for you this song I sing

Yes, I pray that you do love me too 

I said you're all that I'm thinking of.....baby 

Said, I promise to never fall in love with a stranger, 
You're all I'm thinking of, I praise the Lord above, 
For sending me your love, I cherish every hug, 
I really love you 

And all my life, baby, baby, I've prayed for someone like you,

Yes, I pray that you do, love me 

You're all that I ever known, when you smile, on my face, all I see is a glow.
You turned my life around, you picked me up when I was down, 
You're all that I ever known, when you smile on your face all I see is a glow,
You picked me up when I was down 
You're all that I ever known, when you smile on your face all I see is a glow,
You picked me up when I was down and I hope that you feel the same way too, 
Yes I pray that you do love me too

I TALKED TO MY BESTEST FRIEND LAST NIGHT!AND IM SOO GLAD.HES IN TEXAS RIGHT NOW AND I MISS HIM SO MUCH.I WISH I COULD FLY THERE AND SEE HIM,BUT I CANT.AND THAT SUXS!MY JAMALIE,I LOVE YOU.


When I am with you, I feel no pain
No sorrow and suffering, No fear and shame
When we are together, I get butterflies inside
From being nervous yet excited, I'm completely satisfied
We are ""attached at the hip"", as some may say
I can not imagine living without you for a day
Holding your hand brings peace in my life
I forget about all my struggles and strife
When we are apart, my heart, it aches
I feel pain like no other, as my tears awake
I feel passion inside, burning for you
My hand feels lonely, my mind is blue
I long to feel you touch my skin
Long to hear your voice once again 
I miss you like crazy when we aren't together
I look forward to the day we will be together forever<33

I FEEL SOOOO HAPPY!!!!!(FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A LONG TIME)

I want Maks to teach me how to dance...and I want him an Willa to be an item, because that would be so cute!

In more personal news, I cannot wait to go home, even though I'm not sure where I'll be sleeping!  Both of my dad's sisters and their husbands are in town for my Granny's 90th birthday party on Friday!  I can't wait to just be with my parents and Chris, though, and be slow and in my element.

I started the heel [maybe, perhaps, although it really doesn't look right yet] on the first sock that I'm knitting.  It's pretty intimidating but fun.

Thanks to my gorgeous friends for the lovely spring-time flowers they sent last week [?] / a few weeks ago [?]; what a wonderful thing to wake up to!  Not the fat scary flower-delivery man, but the huge aromatic flush of buds that are still in my family room.  I think they need water.

Thanks to my newly-bearded [?] Crunchy friend Will for the terrific note he sent to me!  It was so thoughtful and really made my day!  BJ, I immediately wrote back, but didn't get the chance to actually send my reply until Saturday, just FYI.

My terrific boyfriend came home on Wednesday for spring break, and he's home until the end of the week!  I am so glad!  Already we have spent almost no time apart [save for sleeping time and today when he fixed his car], and it's been so wonderful!  Probably the best part was that he took me to a pet store yesterday and we got to play with the sweetest puppy in the world!  [2 month old, female, light beige cocker spaniel...I named her Lady]  I was so glad they had the playrooms, and we spent about 30 minutes watching her run around like crazy and biting anything she could get her teeth on.  She peed on me, too.  It was great!  Afterwards, my leg didn't even hurt, which brings the conclusion that I need a puppy to love!

My first visit with Dr. Whiting, the neurosurgeon that is going to do the spinal cord stimulator implant is March 14th.  I can't wait.  Then, it'll be 1-3 weeks until I can have the operation and start recovering and physical therapy-ing!  Hooray!"

<B><U>Giving Seattle the Needle</U></B>   <I>by Rick Reilly [of Sports Illustrated, 2/6/2006]</I>

-Okay, Seattle, grab a grande, skinny, no-foam, half-caf Espresso Macchiato and let me explain why the Pittsburgh Steelers are going to grind you up like a Sumatra blend in SuperBowl XL.
-You suck at sports.
-You always have.  You make nice motherboards, but you're dweebier than Frasier Crane's wine club.  You've had the big three pro sports for 30 years now -- almost 40 for the NBA -- and you have one lousy championship to show for it.  <I>Uno</I>.  The 1978 Seattle SuperSonics.  My God, you people have fewer parades than Venice.
-What's amazing is, you do college sports even worse.  In the 70 years that a mythical national championship has been awarded in college football, the University of Washington has one half of one title: in 1991 (with Miami).  Zippo in basketball, baseball, track or field.  OK, the Huskies are good at crew (three women's titles, one men's).  Wonderful.  Somewhere, three salmon cheer.
-Your most famous athlete is a horse, Seattle Slew.  Your most famous athletic moment was Bo Jackson's turing the Boz's chest into a welcome mat on <I>Monday Night Football</I>.  Your greatest contribution to sports was the Wave, the fan-participation stunt that screams to the world, ""We have no idea what the score is!""
-And do you know why you stink, Seattle? Because...

1. You're too damn nice.

-Look at your Seahawks.  Your MVP halfback, Shaun Alexander, teaches kids chess.  Your scariest player is named Pork Chop.  My God, last week, you offered <I>valet parking service</I> to reporters at Seahawks headquarters.  (Seattle fans: If you see valet parking at Detroit's Ford Field this week, they're trying to steal your car.)
-Nearly every five-dollar-steak-tough athlete who comes to Seattle leaves -- Gary Payton and Randy Johnson for instance.  Consider Seattle's two favorite athletes -- Steve Largent and Fred Couples.  Those guys wouldn't complain if somebody extinguished a Cohiba in their ears.  Your sportswriters are more forgiving than Hillary Clinton.  If they covered Jeffrey Dahmer, they'd refer to him as ""a people person.""
-You Seattle fans don't just accept mediocrity.  You crave it.  You support your boys come hell or low water.  You show up at the rate of three million a year for the Mariners, who never fail to let you down.  Even the stadium sounds cuddly: Safeco Field.  You pack the house for the underachieving SuperSonics, led by the NBA's nicest loser, Ray Allen.  Your Seahawks went 21 years without a playoff win, and the fans didn't so much as clear their throats.  Everybody just goes, ""Well, that was fun.  Let's kayak!""  Hey, you can't spell Seattle without <I>settle</I>.
-The whole town is 100% June Cleaver.  I once walked into a Nordstrom, the Seattle-based department store, and sheepishly asked if I could bring back a shirt I'd bought a month before in another town.  The clerk said, ""Sir, this is Nordstrom.  You could wear it for 10 years, throw up on it and roll down a mountain in it and we'd take it back.""  Ask that at Neiman Marcus and they call security.
-It ain't happening.  Walruses don't do triple Salchows, and Seattle teams don't win titles.

2. You're too damn geeky.

-Your owner, Microsoft cofounder Paul Allen, looks like the kid in high school who always got taped to the goalposts.  If Allen wins, will he call all his friends from band camp?  Throw his slide rule into the air?  Plot his joy on a scatter chart?
-Look, your average Seahawks fan drives a Prius.  Your average Steelers fan drives a Ford Excursion, which has Priuses in its tire treads.  Seahawks fans own poodles.  Steelers fans eat them.

3. You're too damn wet.

-Seattle is a great place if you happen to be mold.  It just rained 27 straight days and it wasn't even a record.  Seattle is basically a lot of guys waiting for a bus with rain starting to seep into their socks.  Most kids are seven years old before they realize the ubrella is not an extension of the right arm.  No wonder most great athletes leave.  Ken Griffy Jr. left, basically saying, ""I want my kid to be able to play outside once in a while.""
-In short, you people are too damn peaceful and happy in your Emerald City.  You ever know anybody from Pittsburgh?  You want this SuperBowl.  Pittsburgh <I>needs</I> it.  You're going to get smoked like a platter of smelt.
-(But do you mind if we come live there?)</lj-cut>

I thought it essential to advertise <a href>Ben Roethlisburger's blog</a> on here...my favorite part is the pictures of him at the Civic/Mellon Arena when WWE came through because he and Max Starks went together [and I think Max Starks may just have one of the cutest personalities on the Steelers]!"

Yesterday I went through a football withdrawal...a Sunday just isn't a Sunday without a Steelers game, I think.  That's the toughest and worst part about going to SuperBowl EXTRA-LARRRRGE, that yesterday there was nothing to watch on TV until the 11:00 news.  

But I guess it's OK because I finished <I>Sherlock Holmes</I>, started and finished <I>The 10 People You Meet in Heaven</I>, AND I pulled some Steelers stuff from the back of my closet...literally!

I found my 1995 Conference Champions t-shirt, from the team that went to [and lost, thanks Neil O'Donnell] the last Steelers' SuperBowl [XXX].  It's the t-shirt that I took with me to Saint Vincent College at the Steelers' training camp the summer before 7th grade.  I just want to document the signatures on that holy shirt...

Bill Cowher, Coach, [92-present]

Josh Miller, #4, P, [96-03] -- twice!  oops!  I was a boy-crazy 12-year-old and he was a super-cute pro football player!

Chris Oldham, #24, CB, [95-99]

Carnell Lake, #37, SS, [89-98] -- I tracked him down outside of the cafeteria, running after him in his Speedo sandals, after I hunted down Coach Cowher

Carlos Emmons, #51, LB, [96-99] -- perhaps known from his gun? knife? fight before the preseason of 1996

John Jackson, #65, [88-97] -- practice team, perhaps? can't find anything on him

Jim Sweeney, #66, C/G, [96-99]

Will Wolford, #77, G/T, [96-98]

Charles Johnson, #81, WR, [94-98]

I showed it to Chris and he was pretty excited/impressed.  The bad part is that I can't find the photo album from my disposable camera, with which I took an entire roll of pictures, including one of Greg Lloyd passing by everyone!  I wanted his autograph probably the most, as he was my FAVORITE player and I was wearing his jersey, but he's also a bad-ass, so a picture is about as close as I was gonna get.  Haha, that was a great father-daughter outing and a great memory!

PLUS, I forgot to write, that my aunt & her boyfriend [who is the CEO of the Nat'l Epileptic Foundation, I think] sent me a copy of <I>Epilepsy USA</I> in the mail.  Alan Faneca was on the cover [he is an epileptic, I learned, since he was 15], and IT WAS SIGNED BY OUR PRO-BOWL O-LINEMAN!!!!  Holy crap, it was so exciting.  OK, that's it!  I promise!

</lj-cut>


WOOT, GO STEELERS!"

"event","Well last night I tried to actually do something to figure out what is going on in you, my dear friends', lives, so I read my friends' page.  [And sorry for all the retroactive comments, Will, but yours were the only entries I didn't feel bashful or awkward about commenting so past the READ-BY date.]

I found that after I read all of your great, witty, emotional, intelligent, etc., etc., etc., entries I got pretty depressed.  [I would like to preface this statement by noting that it is NOT meant to offend any of you, it is just a reflection of my current life and that I am supremely jealous!]  I was depressed because I can remember when normal things made me worried; when things like classes, homework, and trying to find a job stressed me out; when the alternating good and bad of being at Bucknell and the people who live there actually mattered to me.  

I was depressed because the new worries and stressors in my life tend more to whether I will ever walk again, what am I going to do with a permanent/pacemaker-like implant inside of my body for the rest of my life, or what happens if this spinal cord stimulator -- this ABSOLUTELY last resort trial -- DOESN'T work?

I was depressed because so many of you are looking forward to your last semester at Bucknell, finding a way OUT, creating your new life, and walking on your own path.  

I was depressed because I get to stick around for another glorious year in Lewisburg IF I can get healthy again, I will be nearly all alone once [the majority of those who are seniors] my friends graduate and move on, and in addition to MORE undergraduate school I have MONTHS of physical therapy ahead of me to look forward to.

I was depressed because you all are living blissfully normal lives, while I'm stuck on the couch for my THIRD semester of college, waiting for doctors to put electronic devices into the cushioning of my ass and hooking them up into my spine.

The biggest difference is, however, that I try to greet every day with respect, admiration, and love...the thrill of being alive [even through the pain] sometimes squeezes so strong on my heart during my nightly prayer of thanks that I can't simply relay it in words or thoughts but rather in tears...I've adapted a <I>joie de vivre</I> that I can neither satiate nor be misplaced by sitting on the couch.

Please, my friends, I hope for all of you to see the beauty in the common life, in the dark stormclouds that beget the virgin snow, in the people you choose to surround yourself with, the warmth of your own body and your fragile health.  I know that it can sometimes be unavoidable, but don't spend your life worrying, nervous, or sad; go out and greet your friends with the same vigor, PROCRASTINATE your work to do something fabulous like taking a walk in a thunderstorm or sleeping on the quad, and don't be affraid of laughing at yourself [and especially at others!].

I'm sorry that I have to give up reading your entries for another period of time, but I DON'T forget to pray for your health and happiness.  Please try to make a difference by starting with yourself: Is it so hard to ask for the glass to be half-full?  Laugh daily...and maybe one time when you do, you will think of me."

I have been trying to avoid this, but I am too frustrated not to anymore.

That doesn't make sense.

I am in pain again.  Fuck.  Fuck fuck fuck.  This time it's in my ankle, which I sprained by jogging on it funny at a gas station on Tuesday on my way home from Mercyhurst.  But once it existed in my ankle, my knee started to hurt again, too.  But, gee, I can't put on my knee brace because one fourth of it goes AROUND MY ANKLE.  However, I can't wear my boot for the ankle because it'd be too much stress ON MY KNEE!  And now, from limping all over my Gateway, the BURSITIS in my HIP has started to flame up.

FUCK!!!!

I have no idea what to do.  I don't want to use the crutches again, that's such bullshit.

<lj-cut text=""motherfucker..."">
So in searching for some relief to the pain on the RSD Hope website, I came across this:

""At home, Dorthy logged on to her computer to learn all she could. Everything she discovered convinced her that Allison did have RSD, a little-known and often misdiagnosed neurological condition that causes nerves to misfire and send constant pain signals to the brain.

Through organizations like the Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy Syndrome Association, Dorthy learned that RSD often follows a minor injury. The disease is not fatal, but it is considered the worst of any chronic pain disorder.

There is no cure. Treated early, usually with medication and nerve blocks, remission is possible. Without proper treatment, RSD renders most patients disabled. There is no single test to diagnose RSD. Most doctors never have encountered it, and many are skeptical that it even exists.""

That hits home so much.  Fuck.  My leg temperatures are definitely different, Monica just confirmed it.  I'm sick of nothing helping.  UGH!</lj-cut>"

"event","After spewing so much animosity towards Bucknell so far this semester, something happened today that made me realize just how much I do love it in actuality...

...two of the phys plant and/or support staff guys who work near the Trax/Roberts parking lot area very much of the time [at least they did for the past 2 years when I lived there] were driving past me [walking on the road, near Hunt] in a pickup.  Both of them gave me full-arm-extension, out-of-the-window waves, and it made my day that they still remember me.  It also makes me glad that I waited until I didn't live in Trax to quit smoking because that was such an awesome feeling.

Now if only the student population at Bucknell would catch up to the employee population in terms of friendliness we'd have it made."

"event","I feel like I have lost my faith, almost...that's how integral politics have been to my life for the past 3.5 years.  I don't know whether it's the inefficiency intrinsically bred into the system, or the black-and-white of the political parties; you aren't either right or wrong, just or immoral, Democrat or Republican, conservative or liberal, culturally relative or universally accepted.

Why do I have to go through this all now?  Is it because of DC?  Will I ever be able to watch a movie without being distracted by the factualness of the American political system's portrayal?  How do I know that there are absolutely no answers to any of my questions right now?

I feel like I don't have the energy to really figure myself out internally to be able to fully express this junction I'm [not] exploring.  I can't take a stance on any issue anymore because I see the benefits of both sides of argument; this also allows for me to see the GLARING FLAWS as well.  I am in theoretical no-man's-land, which makes me glad that at least I am not a philosophy major: my life would be collapsing around me even more if that were the case.

Why is it that as soon as the one area of my life that has thus far eluded me comes together, all the rest of me falls apart?  Why can't I have it all work out at once?  It almost makes me want to have things back to how I was used to them...

<I>almost</I>.  I would never willingly give that up."

"event","I love being back at Bucknell a whoooole lot.  Gateway Sweet-Ass is just about as sweet-ass as it could ever be...Roser 2 all together is even better.  What a fun, wild, and interesting year we're going to have!

There is a huge motherfucking spider that lives outside of my bedroom window.  Tonight I watched it attack and coccoon some poor trapped bug; that was pretty sweet.  When it is daylight, however, s/he does not sit on the web.  I really would feel much more comfortable if I knew where s/he went during the daytime.  This makes me think of Mike's spider friends from last year.

I am frustrated because no matter where I am anymore I end up missing people from somewhere else...last semester all I ever did was ""see"" people from Bucknell"" all over DC, and now so many people look like Washingtonians to me it's ridiculous.  Last night I had a great long talk with Brynnie on the phone catching up.  I need to send her birthday present pronto.

Being back on campus is making it more difficult for me to maintain my non-smoking ways.  I quit on the 11th of July, the physical need has long been dealt with; all that is left is the feeling of having a cigarette in my hand while walking across campus still seems so much more natural to me.  Plus, I am bored out of my mind and the only thing to do now is eat rather than smoke.  Help help help help.

Keeping a committed, invested, amazing relationship long-distance is so much more difficult than I remember it being.  There's a big ol' chunk of me missing all of the time, it seems."

I've only been at work for an hour and already I am tired of being here.  And working 'til 9 p.m. is making this day pass very slowly.  I think this will be a 4-cuppa java day.  I be's hoping that the idea of a 13-hour day is worse than the actual day.

<lj-cut text=""KAYAKING & COMPANY PICNIC YESTERDAY"">
We had 11 people for 'yakking yesterday morning...although Annie dropped out and Scotty & Wilson & Jeannie slept in, we had Lang & me, Hickey & Cooter, Saxton & Mrs. Saxtonburg, Brandon & Ashley [groan!], and Joey, Jordan, and Ricky.  It was an awesome turnout, and those kids are so cool sometimes!!!!  Hickey was nice enough to bring a cooler of my leftover Rolling Rock from the night before, from which I promptly stuck as many bottles in my shorts pockets & stuffed my bikini top with them [the remainder are in my trunk].

The Saltsburg River & Trail guy is always SO STONED!  It was 9 a.m. when we got there and he was already pretty blitzed, I can't believe how he keeps up with all the ganga he smokes!  But I guess it makes for him not caring that two people are taking half a case of beer onto the river while accompanied by about 6 minors.  Go us...Hickey and I are alcoholics!

After about 5 paddle strokes Ashley started to complain, asking how much longer we'd be on the river.  Ugh.  [Allegedly, the only reason Brandon brought her was so that no one at the company picnic would be like ""oh, KAYAKING!"" and she didn't know about it...durrr.]  And her complaining put Brandon in a pissy mood as usual, so I put as many paddle-lengths between them and me as possible [which wasn't very hard to do].

But, other than that, I LOVE that group.  As usual, we just floated down the river laughing the whole way.  It took us about 3-3 1/2 hours which is longer than usual, but we stopped for a VERY long time at the rope swing.  It was so awesome and scary and fun...I went from <I>almost</I> as high as Jordan & Ricky were jumping from even after I fell off.  [The first time was fun, I didn't jump from very high as I was pretty nervous, but the second time I went a lot further up the hillside.  I guess I didn't have a good handle on the rope as, right at the bottom of my vector, my hands let go and I flew into the water at top speed.  I was surprised that I didn't hit anything since it was so shallow, but I entered at an angle, so I guess that was in my favor.  Everyone else thought I'd be dead & were really looking forward to telling my parents/their bosses about my tragic demise.  But the next time I jumped from higher and had a better rope hold...it was glorious!]

Lang & I decided that Cooter is probably the nicest, sweetest, most level-headed kid ever.  We were doing imitations of him all day yesterday, and he just went with it and even expanded on them...""I'm comin', little buddy!""  ""Don't worry, Johhhhn, I'll catch you!""

B & Ash were miserable as usual, even afterwards at the company picnic...ugh.  Oh well, we're all just sick of Brandon putting himself through hell because he's afraid to be alone.  Stupid sap.

The picnic was great, though sparsely-attended.  I don't know why people are beginning to refuse our company, but it looks really bad & ungrateful to your company managers who go through all of this effort for no one to show up.  I was surprisingly lucky in that I won a raffle AND half of a 50/50...I haven't won anything since 6th grade lucky plate!  We didn't have enough people to play a real game of baseball and most of us were so hungry that we ate ourselves into stomach aches...haha, we so totally rule.

So that's the life of a young Langston Subaru employee; we freaking rule!  I hope nobody read that whole thing because, dude, how boring!</lj-cut>"

Nicoderm CQ is giving me <lj-cut text=""weird ass dreams..."">

It's so strange because I don't remember having dreamt at all at night for about the past year until being in Florida.  Then, since starting ""the patch"" on Monday, I have had very strange dreams, the most recent being:

I was working at the dealership in it's old location [it hasn't been there for almost 4 years now], and Cathy [my non-parental boss] came up and said I had a package.  I got really excited because I thought it might be the Neighborhoodies order I am expecting [which is true], but it turned out to be a bunch of Subaru stickers and Langston business cards and license plates.

Wasted Face and Fasano were in town [?!] and I had plans with them for 9 p.m., which I told my dad; he said that I couldn't go because I had a physical therapy appointment at 9 o'clock that night [again ?!].  I got really mad because my leg wasn't even being a problem [another truism] and threw the disappointing package of Subie propaganda into the air and it fell pell mell all over the dingy old showroom.  After calling my orthopedist and cancelling my appointment, I stormed out the door.

Once outside I was out by my home-base Metro station in DC; there was a HUGE picket/demonstration/movement happening with people shouting and carrying signs [like I saw in Dupont Circle the one day last semester].  I tried to ask the people what the gathering was in response to because I really wanted to join it, but no one was willing to tell me.  

Catty-corner from where I was [in a field that doesn't really exist], the Shady Side Academy field hockey team was practicing the same re-entry/turn-over drill over and over and over again.  The only people I really recognized were Nikki Barraff [playing right midi of all positions; she used to play forward], Ally Shogan [center midi], Sarah Bidula [left forward], and Lindsay Tannenholtz [at right forward].  They kept hitting the ball into play from the right sideline and doing their passing/shooting thing, but somehow all of the balls found their way back out of play on the same part of the formation; they were all coming to rest next to the person on my left, standing watching the protest as well.  This person was ignoring their presense, and I wanted so badly to reach over and throw them back [Shady Side field hockey players are always losing their balls, usually because of the cross country team] or ask him [her?] to please throw them back across the street, but I couldn't do either.</lj-cut>

The rest of the dream I don't really remember, just that it came and went as I drifted in and out of sleep.  I woke up feeling unrested and really frustrated.  My dad just came into work and I was yawning and he gave me some shit [playfully] about being out late last night [I got home from Lang's at 12], but <I>really</I> it's because I slept so restlessly.  Haha, at least that's my story for him.

I hate dreaming because I never could get that psychoanalytical reasoning of them; comments re: how screwed up my mind is are more than welcome!  Tonight I'm taking off my nicotine patch BEFORE bed!"

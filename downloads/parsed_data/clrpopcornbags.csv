"event","Its amazing, the bond that me and my sisters have.  I know that everyone has a special bond with their siblings(and if you have siblings and you don't have that bond, you're really missing out) but this is something different.  It can't be described.  Being a triplet has its ups and downs, but I wouldn't have it any other way.  I always forget that other people didn't grow up with two other people always by your side, and to be honest, I can't even really remember a time when we were younger that we weren't together.  It was like your best friend always being there.  We shared everything, toys, clothes, etc.  Its too mind-blowing to try to think of my childhood without 2 other people my exact same age.  

WhileI'm at i, I hsoudl include my brother.  Best big brother triplets could ask for.  My parents did such a good job raising us, that instead ogf him hating us because we got all the attention,(an old lady passed my mom once on the street while she was pushing us in our 3 person stroller and handed my mom a 20 and said god bless, I don't knwo how you do it) he was so proud of us and always helped feed us and play with us.  There are so many videos of him playing with us and giving us rides on the sled around the yard as Jill falls off the back.  He truly was the best we could have ever asked for.

We used to share a room. and Jill had the bed by the door.  As we all know, I have a fear of the dark, so I would always switch beds with her. (mine was inthe far corner) Eventually we got buk beds and Jill was on the top while i ws on the bottom, and I still remember one night Jill tried to kill me.  Somehow during the night she got her foot underneath the railing and lifted it up and it fell off the bed.  Well of course my head is at her feet and right next to the window.  The bar fell down and broke he window.  Yet, somehow, I slept through the whole thing.  I woke up in the morning to a bar in my face.  Months later my dad's side of the family was over and someone slammed the door to our room and the rest of the glass just shattered.  As I look back on it, its hilarious, but really scaryy at the time.  

I'll be teh firstto admit that we never always got along.  I was responsible for Jill getting stiched in her head because I threw a pool stick at her.  I remember one day we beat each other with empty milk gallon jugs my dad was keeping for some reason or another.  We usd to bite each other so as punishment my dad would squirt mustard in our mouths, henace the reason none of us eat mustard.  But I hate everyithn that I ever did with ill intentions toward them.  And I know I'll never get it back, but I don't have to like what I did.  Oh and Jill, sorry about the time that I feel asleep in bed while you were talking to me from the top bunk.

My favorite (not really) day wit Ivy was  the day I made her pass out.  We were play fighting in the kitchen and somehow I got her in a head hold kind of thing, and she was like, I'm getting dizzy, so I let go and she fell to the floor against the fridge.  The she looks up and goes how did I get here?  It was priceless.  My friend Sarah was over, I think we scarred her that day.

We gotto a point where it became fun fighting, something we did, and still do, to pass the time when we're bored.  My favorit passtime I must say.  Ivy and I play it mainly cuz Jill used to get mad too quickly. but pretty much we just annoy the shit out of each other untill one snaps.  Always a good time.  

I never thought I would miss them as much as a do when I went to college.  My thoughts were finally, after 18 years, I can be my own person, and not be known as the Stelzners, or The Stelzner Triplets.  Needless to say, it wasn't as great as I tought it would be.  Its liek I'm alay missing something.  I feel sad if I don't talk to them every day.  

There's just too much to put into words, but I miss them a lot.  You guys are really my biggest influences in life.  Thanks."

"event","Omg haven't updated in ages.  So I was helping Jen with her music theory homework, and I was playing the piano, and I realized hoe much I missed playing that, and music in general.  I'm seriously considering joining the normal band thing and play oboe again.  But listening to the piano made me think of my old piano teacher, Mrs. Lawrence.  I don't even know if she's still alive.  But when I played a note, I could picture her living room/dining room, and the smell of her house.  She was the sweetest lady ever.  How do we lose touch with people like that?  

Roomate's tryingto get me to go to Calico Jacks.

Thinking of changing my major to history.  Its where my passion lies.  But I don't know what to do with it.  I could go to DC and work in the Smithsonian or the National Archives or the like.  I dunno.  I've just always loved it. I want to be that person that yo usee that can pulled facts out of his ass like no one's business.  Facts that no one else even really cares about but would be totally awsome to know.  A whole collection of useless shit.  Unless I became involved in a Davinci Code/Rule of Four/National Treasure like adventure.  :)

Went shopping today and bought a big ring that makes it look like I'm engaged(dont comment on that).  It makes me feel special.  I'd put it up here but I don't understand that stuff.  

Missin DLC and not too pleased about sweating to death on my way to class, but I'm glad I'm back."

"event","Ok guys, one of my favorite songs.  Ostertag, this kinda goes out to you cuz it makes me think of you everytime I hear it.

(This is sung by a Japanese lady so that's why the grammar horrible.  Don't yell at me.)


You think ruv sam thing as getting along?
Sometime ruv is right where you hating most.

The more you ruv someone, the more you want to kill them
The more you ruv someone, the more he make you cry
Though you are right for making peace with them and loving, that why you love so strong you like to see him die!
The more you ruv someone, the more he make you crazy
The more you ruv someone, the more you wishing him dead!
Sometimes you look at him and only see fat and lazy
And wanting baseball bat for hitting him on his head
Love (Love) and hate (and hate), they like two brothers, who go on a date (who go on  a what?)
Where one of them goes, other one follows
You be finding love, he also bring sorow
The more you ruv someone, the more you want to kill them
Loving and klling fit like hand in glove
So if a someone you are wanting so to kill him
You go and find him 
And  you get him
And you no kill them
Cuz chances good he is you love.
 

Haha, ok that makes me laugh.





David I swear to have those stupid things out by next Wednesday.



This is wierd for me.  My life actually seems to be going really well.  I have a job that's paying me $15.96/ hr.  Therefore, I actually have money, for which those of you ith me in school last semester understand how great this is (aka my phone call to sister Jill about my pickle and cracker sandwiches).  Or any college kid for that matter.  I'm getting a car (tomorrow!!!!!) that's practically brand new for next to nothing.  Having a car means I can get a job in Orlando, so that's more money.  Work, aside from pay, is fun.  At least the people I work for are.  Can't wait til I can ork with someone who wants to nap in the mornings again, though.  I'm getting stuff together to move into my apartment, with my life partner Jen, which is goign to be sooo much fun.  Hit up the amll yesterday and it seems as though everytihng is on sale, so that made me happy.  However, my boss heard me say I was going to the Victoria's Secret Semi-Annual sale, and goes old on lemme get a visual.   Kinda disturbing but oh well.  Did I mention I'm getting a  car?  It seems too good to be true.  Oh wait, I remember, Still haven't gotten rid of crazy boy.  Don't yell.  Why do I have this feeling that David's prediction is going to come true?  Oh well, not going to let it get me down right now."

Got roommate assignments for Boardwalk.  No guys but the one girl seems cool (Fatass and I stalked her on facebook).  Dunno about that last girl though, she's not on facebook.  

Lots of funny stories to tell from work, but can't think right now.  (haha, I had a fan club on Friday, it was hialrious)

So car.  Only problem is its a manual, so dad finally has to teach me that.  But I can live with that.  So yes Ostertag, that means you won't have to drag my sorry ass everywhere.

I SWEAR I'm getting those stupi hings out, I'm just lazy as Hell, if you haven't already figured that out.  

Wow my entries get worse and worse."

1. Reply with your name and I will write something about you.
2. I will then tell what song/movie reminds me of you.
3. If I were to apply an o'clock to you, it would be...
4. I will try to name a single word that best describes you.
5. I'll tell you the most memorable moment I've had with you.
6. I will tell you what animal you remind me of.
7. I'll then tell you something that I've always wondered about you.
8. Put this in your journal.

Work started on Tuesday, so I'm lacking in sleep right now.  Haven't slept in 48 hours, but thats ok cuz I went to see Star Wars!!!!  Soooo worth pulling an all nighter!!!!  

I miss Mark form work so much.  We always have so much fun and get paid to do nothing.  Today we got to our town, Glassport, around 8:30 and proptly took a nap til 9:15.  We were supposed to get up at 9, but overslept.  (yes were sleeping on the job) So we were so unenthusiastic to work and almost got nothing done, then ended upi with 99 poles, the same as yesterday, so we figure that we can work from about 9 to 12, get something to eat (like Primantis, mmm I miss that) and go back to work at about 1:40, then leave to go back to the main building at 2:20.  God I love my job.  Sexual innuendos goin everywhere all day and catching up with friends.  Priceless.  What's sad it that the other group thats there is working almost non stop and they do only a little better than us.

Ok the Ivy countdown is almost up, gtg.  Lots of love!!!!!"

For those of you that don't understand that, I'm talking about my white 93 Dodge Caravan that is fixed!!!!!!  I'm so excited right now and its the only thing that's keeping me up this early.  

Why Affirmative Action you ask?  Well, my sister Ivy decided she wanted to name it the Black Beast, but of course its white.  So when people would ask us why the Black Beast, we said because of affirmative action, and the name just stuck.  

On another note, Penn State was a bust.  This is going to be harder than I thought, because apparantly he's not ready to give up yet.  Oh well, I can't let it get to me.

BBQ at Marty's tonight!!!!  Woo and hoo, going to be some fun times!!!

"event","Haha, fun time tonight.  My friend Marc was really in the mood for Taco Bell, so we drive by at 11:45 and its closed, even though they're not supposed to close until 12.  So Marc is pissed and sits outside the drive thru window for about 5 minutes til this lady comes over and goes, ""We're CLOOOOOOOOSED!!!!!""  So Marc, being the in the closet man that he is (not the other guy, and much better Marc) drives over to Wendy's, orders food, starts complaining to Wendy's about Taco Bell, and the shutthe window in his face.  So then he drives back to Taco Bell, waves to the lady inside, and site on the curb outsid and eats his burger.  oh Marc I lvoe you, so overdramatic about everything.  :)  

Other than that I've just been cleaning and bother the family some more, because I know they've missed it sooo much.

went to a physical today.  Let me tell you, I love old doctors feeling my breasts and then giving pee tests.  Highlight of my day.  Woo and Hoo."

"event","Ok, first of all two more things I miss about PA.  First, holding your breath through a tunnel and 2) the St. John's Church stairs that are on either side of the road.  What's funny about this is that the road it crosses the PA Turnpike, therefore meaning that there is a big cement barrier in the way.  Yet, they never remove them, its kinda neat.  

Random side note, my sister Jill said she doesn't think she van give blood because you have to weigh over 110 and shes not sure if she passes that......I hate skinny people......

Today I passed a cemetery on my way home from DC and I think there was the most amount of people I have ever seen in a cemetery at one time, all visiting the graves of mothers who have passed away.  It just hit me that at some point, that's going to be me.  This goes out to anyone out there who had to do this for Mother's Day, or Father's Day since we're on it.  




When I dream, on my own
I'm alone but I'm ain't lonely
For a dreamer night's the only time of day




So DC was interesting.  Got to see my fatass again, last time til August.  :(   Way too much family time, but now its backt to the Burgh and sharing a room with my sister who is a Nazi and making me clean and unpack.  grrr.  I kinda deserve it though, I was following her around the house about a half a step behind her, and she kept freaking out on me, and yelling at me.  heehee, its so much fun to annoy her, I can't believe I forgot how entertaining it can be.  well im off to bed, night."

"event","So I'm home in the Burgh.  Its been good so far, so weird to see everything again.  The roads being shitty, PA licence plate everywhere, mountains again..its the little things, ya know?  Like the faucet in the bathroom, I turned it without a second thought, but did a double take when it wasn't what I've grown accustomed to.  Family's great, missed them terribly, and JILL'S WEARING MAKEUP AND CONTACTS!!!! I swear I almost had a heart attack.  My room is almost unrecognizable as my brother and sister in law have been living in there.  But, I can't be mad, Nate just cracked my back.  :)  My parent somehow fit a double bed in Ivy's room, so I get the pleasure of sharing a room with e all summer.  Oh well, if I can handle Fatass, I can handle anything.

Ya know, its wierd.  We all have friends that we claim to know, and yet on a 2 hour plane ride, I heard more about this little old lady's life than I'm almost positive i know about some people I call close friends.  Why is it that everyone feels the need to tell their story during a plane ride?  Maybe its because no one knows what will happen to them when they step onto that plane, so on the off chance that you don't survive, someone can sit there and say, ya know, I only knew them for an hour, but they led a good life.  You find out so many things about a person when you just sit down and talk with them.  Like Clair, who's friends live in Corapolis, Pa, so she's visiting them.  And her one girlfriend who was just admitted to a nursing home.  And how she had colon cancer, and was bedridden for almost a year, so she's trying to get out and around to see everybody.  I think I liked her so much because she reminded me of my nana.  I just love the atmosphere on a plane ride, everyone saying where they're going and where they've been.  Its an experience.

No I don't even know you, but I sure as hell would like to, if you'd give me the chance."

So party at Peter's last night was a lot of fun, I'm going to miss you guys soo much over the summer!!  

I don;t want to go home at all.  Yes, I want to see my family and friends and miss them terribly, but after about 2 weeks, I'll be ready to come back to O-Town.  I just know that so many things are going to be different, and I don't really want to be a part of it.  I don't think that a lot of my friends from high school have changed and matured as much as I have this past year, and I don't want to go home and be thrown back into that drama again.  It will be so much fun to see them and hang out again, but at the same time, there will be this feeling of distance.  Plus, no one to party with back home. :(  At that rate, I'll be as much as a lightweight as Ostertag is now.  ;-)  However, I am excited to go to DC and see my favorite guy there, Kenneth!!!!!  Don't let me down, Ken.  ;-)

How wonderful life is, now you're in the world.

So many things to say, yet no words to say them."

"event","Oh so excited, I'm FINALLY done with my paper.  Note to self (so i said to myself,'self, blah blah blah.  sorry nostalgia of Miss Manina, please tell me you remember her Jill and Andy), stop waiting til the last minute for things.  Also, taking shots and trying to write an 8 page paper, NOT a good idea.  Now I just have to go to her (duck face) at 2:40, and keep my fingers crossed.  Ok, I'mm too sick of typing to put an actual post up, so you'll just have to wait her Heather's next bout of wisdom.  :)"

Wow, I'm so bored right now.  I am trying to do anything but my English paper.  Have I mentioned I don't want to do it? At this point, I'm so close to paying someone to do it.  Any offers????


Rhode Island.  Neither a road or and island. Discuss.
I tihnk that this person named Rhode (gender questionable) found this place, but thought it was an island.  Therefore it became Rhode's Island.  The problem with that was that people would go around saying they went to Rhode's Island, and everyone thought they were saying Road's I Land On.  Very confusing time, it was. Finally, they decided on just making it Rhode Island, never imagining that years later there would be this controversy.  


May it be
An evening star
Shines down upon you
May it be 
When darkness falls
Your heart will be true
You walk a lonely road
Oh how far you are from home


A dream is a wish your heart makes, when you're fast asleep
In dreams you will lose your heartache
Whatever you wish for, you keep
Have faith in your dream and someday
Your rainbow will come smiling through
No matter how your heart is grieving
If you keep on believing
The dream that you wish will come true

Yesterday, all my troubles seem so far away
Now it looks as though they're here to stay
Oh I believe in yesterday
Suddenly, I'm not half the man I used to be
Theres a shadow hanging over me
Oh Yesterday came suddenly
<b> Yesterday - Beatles</b> dave

I woke up it was seven, I waited til eleven
Just to figure out that no one would call
I tihnk I've got a lot of friends but I don't hear from them
What's another night alone
When you're spending everyday on your own and here it goes
I'm just a kid and life is a nightmare
I'm just a kd, I know that its not fair
And nobody  cares cuz I'm alone and the world is having more fun
Than me
Tonight


Always assuming the worst
But you're going on nonetheless
And there's nothing to cushion your heart



I'm havin trouble tryin to sleep
I'm countin sheep but runnin out
As time ticks by, still I try
<b>Brain Stew</b> dave

You're sweet just like the sun but what happens when the sun goes away
The night reminds me of when you went away
I dont care, I dont care
Mind is pacing heart is racing contemplating things that I lack
And though you left me by myself do I want you back?
Will you stay or will you walk, will you let go?
Leave me alone?
I'm giving you one more chance
To make thing last


I swear i have ADD.  Enjoy.  You can guess what these are or just take the advice they offer, I don't really care.  lalalalalalalala lalal lal lal lal la ll lalal lalla ll lalaalalalalal llalalaalalaalalaalaalaalalalalalala"

"event","So if you don't know who my title is talking about, its my Comp 2 teacher,and she's a bitch.  I'm sorry, but I hate this class with a passion.  Why did I take the class with her again?  I'm an idiot.  12 page paper due by Friday, and I'm so screwed for it.  Now apparantly, our final project is due Wed.  So nice that she tells us these things in advance.  'owrihgdfkm,j;oitrhjgiaughj340q6u3eirjdfkvz.fvbhe;kfjzd;sedfjbghoeighfjdsl;giutjfd  That's how my brain feels right now. Oh, and I rolled out of bed today at the last minute hoping to go to my first class then go back to sleep, but noooo, she decides at 10 last night to change her mind and have class today, so here I am wasting valuable napping time.  Ok, I think that's the end of my rant.


On a happier note, retreat this weekend was a lot of fun!!!  Thanks to Jen for getting everything together, we really do appreciate it!  Good times, but nothing really to put down, other than nyham nyham nyham nyham nyham!!!!!  lol  

Yesterday was long.  Got back from retreat, then David and I went to the batting cages, came back, showered (yet my hair still smeels like campfire), then off to the APhiO elections meeting.  Kudos to Jackie for bringing food!!!!  Left for softball game, but even though we lost it was a blast.  The guys on that team are so much fun, and I guarantee that no other team had as much fun as we did, unless you like the whole winning games thing.  Sorry I couldn't get the Spiderman move down.  Elections lasted til about 930, at which point I felt kinda sick from not eating.  So we went to eat and didn't get back home til around midnight.  Still soo tired from retreat, but that's ok.  Oh wait, no its not, I got jipped out of my nap today.  Damnit.

Ok, off to find my friends for lunch!!

My back really hurts, who wants to give Heather a massage!!!!!"

"event","so have you ever really sat down and thought about it?  if the world were to embrace clear popcorn bags, everyone would be a little bit happier.  no more burnt popcorn!!  im telling you, this is it.  i could be rich, too.  oh well, just a thought.

yes, so i finally cracked and got a live journal.  i blame david for that.  just what i need, one more thing to take up my time.  at least now i have somewhere to vent all my thoughts as i sit in my dorm by myself with no tv.  :(  what a sad life, and with only jen as a friend.  i swear to god if i wake up 30 years from now and jens face is still the first thing i see im jumping off a cliff.  you may laugh now, but remember this.  

what we do in life echoes in eternity........how loud will your echo be?"

"event","k well friday was pretty good. I hate math now because im not sitting next to morgan anymore. Instead im sitting next to some guy who smells like shit and needs to use deoderant. Anyways after school i hung at TL for a little and then got a ride home with a guy on the boy tennis team. He dropped brooke lauren and nichole off at brookes house and dropped me and morgan off at my house. I packed and got ready for mudfootball and then we walked to brookes. When we got there dom was gone cuz he got grounded and so he had to go home so we all got ready and took pictures and then walked down to the feild. the guys were being annoying and left so instead we played with alex zach and morgan f. It was fun cuz we just talked each other till we were all muddy and then it started to pour and we were all SO cold. After taking a shower and getting in our pjs zach came over to brookes house and we hung out for a little then nichole (good luck at ur tournament lol) and zach left and we watched cinderella story but we all fell asleep in the middle. Now im still in my pjs and tired so ill write in this later.

Im so happy we have a ski week! i need the rest but im not feeling it yet..

"event","Haven't updated my journal in a while! ok well friday i went to the freshman girls game and that was fun because we won and then me,lauren, nichole, brooke, morgan and Dom went to the Varisty game and that was intense butwe lost:(. Saterday i had a tennis match at 8 in the morning in Oakland and as i got there....i found out it was delayed till 10:30 so i was mad. I played my first match and won and then i had another match at 12:30 and lost. Then got ready and went to MOrgans to decorate her house for Lauren's suprise party. Then me, mo, nichole, and brooke walked to Nicholes house and stayed there for a little and then picked up lauren and went to Coldstones so that every1 else could go to mrogans. We walked around 4th street and it was relli fun and then passed my some homeless by starbucks. This is how the scence went:

Homeless: Hello Beautiful Ladies
Me, Brooke and NIchole ignore him and walk into starbucks
Lauren and MOrgan: HEY!
Then we all go sit down on the coaches and we are talking about how freaky the homeless was and then he comes in and is walking towards us so i get freaked out so i get up and sit on brooke and he goes ""Omg u left a seat for me thank u, u know im a model, i mean look at me..actually im a model trainer like a train u know choochoo
Lauren: Noo!! (laughing hysterically)
WE all move next to some family with a relli hott guy! and the homeless is talking to himself and keeps looking over at us. Then he leaves and decides to sit right outside the window starring at us. Then NIchole's mom came lol. We went to morgans and tried to get lauren to go into the family room but she wouldn't she kept saying stuff like LETS GO skinny dipping! Then every1 suprised her and we hung out till about 2 in the morning and then every1 went home except for me, morgan, lauren, nichole, and brooke. We stayed up till abot 3:30ish and we relli wanted a boyfriend or at least some1 to cuddle with:( Alright well tomorrow is valentines day and i want a valentine:( k well ttyl

"event","Wow its been a long time since ive updated this journal. Im not very good at this:( Well this week was relli annoying. My geometry teacher called my mom and told her i was rude to her so my mom got mad and grounded me and sed she was taking me to my dads at 3:00 on Friday so i told her she shouldn't because my dad would pick me up later on from San Rafael. Then she called me at about 7:30 when i was at chillies and got all mad and hung up on me. So ya then my dad picked me up and this morning i had tennis from 9-12 and then i went to my dads for literally about 15 min. and then went to pick up my tennis coach and went to oakland for my tennis tournament. I won my first match 7-5, 6-4 and then i got into the semi-finals and in the semi-finals i won 6-0, 6-3, so basically today was pact with tennis so im exhausted! and tomorrow guess whts happening at 9 in the morning....FINALS TENNIS MATCH..yippie ..not!!! ugg im getting sort of sick of this whole thing and on top of that my parents who are divorced are giving me a VERY hard time using me as a messanger and its relli relli annoying...those of u whose parents are divorced would understand. So ya im relli tired right now and i have to read like 21372198478 chapters of to kill a mockingbird..FUN...ya so ill try and write in this tomorrow but as i said before im not good at this whole thing...

"event","Hey ok well i haven't updated this for a while! Today was an okay day...i dont know why but i was in a realli bad mood 4th period math. Maybe it was because Ms. Brown kept moving morgan and we couldn't talk:( And i felt bad cuz it was me mostly doing the takling and got moved...like always. Then came 5th period which was realy fun actually. We had to guide our partner around the school and they had to have there eyes closed. Then after that activity Mr. Digiralamo decided to play a little game for us to understand ""TRUST"". In that activity you have to stand on the table and fall backwards and the whole class has to put their arms up to catch you. Well after about 4 kids went, Mr. Digiralamo decided it was his turn. Sadly no one caught him and he fell to the floor. I wasn't laughing at the time being because i didn't wanna be mean but now everytime i think about it i start cracking up. O ya and about falling, today In science i was leaning backwards in my chair and it fell so i landed on my butt. It hurt real bad and on top of that some people were laughing:( very embarrassing but thank god i didn't hit my head. Ya so now im kinda bored and i couldn't go to the game because i had a ride there but not back. See Dom sed hed give me a ride back but i didn't want him to go just because i was going so we decided not to go. By the way thanks shira and amanda for offereing me a ride....I love you guys to death lol my baby dino and shira babe! lol ya well i gots to get back to hw and being bored so ttyl

      By the way this is by far the longest entry ive ever written!!


 o YA P.S. i put these rhinestones on my Ipod mini and it looks so much better now. Theres a baby pink heart right in the middle of the turning wheel so it looks RELLI cute. Everyone who's in my 7th period class will see it tomorrow...ok im done now

Under 12: You are a kid at heart. You still have an optimistic life view - and you look at the world with awe.

13-19: You are a teenager at heart. You question authority and are still trying to find your place in this world.

20-29: You are a twentysomething at heart. You feel excited about what's to come... love, work, and new experiences.

30-39: You are a thirtysomething at heart. You've had a taste of success and true love, but you want more!

40+: You are a mature adult. You've been through most of the ups and downs of life already. Now you get to sit back and relax.

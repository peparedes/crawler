"event","i woke up before dawn this morning anticipating a meteor shower of 
spectacular caliber, but was sadly disappointed by shameless 4:00am haze(?) 
and humidity(!?). i counted five over the course of an hour and then reluctantly 
surrendered my patience. 

i once saw the leonids a few novembers ago and counted one hundred 
shooting stars over the course of a few minutes. they're not overrated. just saying.

today was devoted to paying a long visit to the hospital. thinking back, 
i've had very little experience with hospitals and with death for that matter. 

you see, i can only learn so much from six feet under. in fact most of my 
time in the waiting room  was spent doing people magazine crossword puzzles 
and making awkward small talk with my relatives. i wanted to be more comforting 
and appropriate but the words just wouldn't come easily enough. oh melancholy.

speaking of comfort, i finally found a proper tea kettle to take along with me when 
the fall semester begins. it's quite fetching, all handsome and glass. it is my new boyfriend.

i also scored a free ceramic teapot and some loose-leaf tea samples. <a href=""http://www.adagio.com"">adagio</a> is where it's at."

and sorting my losses.

first of all: justin (<lj user=""utterness"">) and kim (<lj user=""wheeeee"">) 
visited last week and there are no sufficient words to describe how much i miss 
them and how beautiful they both are. it's horribly unfair that they do not live 
closer for i feel that they might just be the loves of my life.

second of all: my home computer was just struck by lightning. or something. it refuses
to come on at all so i can only assume that i've lost yet another hard drive since i
still don't back anything up. it's a vice, i suppose. what luck that i have this laptop.

in the mean time i am braving this thunderstorm with coffee, biscotti, and 
<i>a very long engagement</i>. films such as this one make me realize that eventually 
i'd like to replace all of the cynicism in my life with romance. i'm not joking either.

"event","it's a typical friday night and the domestic gods and i are having a smoldering soiree. in a meager attempt to make my life more exotic i am drinking red wine, eating black cherries, and pushing my broom around to hot latin lounge music.

if only this broomstick were someone's hand, i could take it and we'd samba.
only i don't know how and lack the grace that dancing requires.
see i know this because i took a tango class once a few years ago and ended up leaving early because it was impossible not to step on everyone's feet.
oh damn it all.

five things that i'm feeling lately:

un.) <b>radar magazine</b>
- i picked up the premiere issue on a whim in the supermarket a few weeks ago.
it's one of the only magazines i've ever read cover to cover. check it out if you're
into pop culture, politics, fashion, and smart writing.

deux.) <b>green tea ice cream</b>
- anything green tea, really.

trois.) <b>celibacy</b>
-  because boys are lame (and there are none in the general area.)

quatre.) <b><a href=""http://www.americanapparelstore.com/"">american apparel</a></b>
- come autumn i plan on rebuilding my wardrobe and this is where i'd like to start.

cinq.) <b><a href=""http://www.demeterfragrance.com/default.aspx"">demeter fragrances</a></b>
- i haven't bought anything from here yet but i'm intrigued by all of it.

oh and i've decided that this is the last summer i'm spending at home.
hopefully a year from now i'll have an internship out-of-state.
will anyone be offering someplace i could crash for a few months?"

has been an endless source of pain and punishment lately?

i did not finish it in eleventh grade and from my current pace
it looks like i will be going two for two.

economics exam number two is tomorrow. 
i might as well just go ahead and slit my throat

<b>ennui</b> - n.

- listlessness and dissatisfaction resulting from 
  lack of interest; boredom

- a feeling of weariness and disgust; dullness and languor 
  of spirits, arising from satiety or want of interest; tedium.


with each shade of gray comes diminishing consolation.

foggy and yawn-ish. the hair on the left side of my head is matted flat 
and pushed up against the side, thus producing a sexy i-just-slept-on-my-
left-side-and-now-my-head-looks-uneven-woosh effect.

i also just realized what a luxury it is to take two hour naps
right in the middle of the day. oh privileges.

for some reason i woke up and wanted nothing but cranberry almond crunch cereal.
i think it is odd that i am willing to eat cereal at any time of the day and
substitute it for any meal. or dessert even. hmm maybe it is not so odd?

the weekend begins now and i do not have any plans that do not involve reading
or studying. sometimes i feel like i am moving too fast here at college and
my life is one big maelstrom of never ending excitement. i am sure most
people could not even begin to keep up. i am being serious. no really.

god i need a hobby.

exhibit A 
yesterday i got a package from a cute boy. just BECAUSE.

exhibit B
a cute girl has offered to send me a package as well. just BECAUSE.

exhibit C
i've fallen so far behind in reading my book
that last night i e-mailed my professor and told her i was sick and
wouldn't be able to make it to class today. however i am not.
oh the procrastination isn't anything new. just the ease i had in brushing all
of the consequences away with a sorry excuse.

exhibit D
the weird flux in livejournal comments.

exhibit E
the increasing number of high school friends that <i>know</i> about me.
two have asked me in the past three days. and it isn't a big deal.

so i'm left to ponder if this week has just been particularly good
or one gigantic conspiracy to throw me off.

"event","I haven't posted in a long time, but I figured this might be worth pointing out.

My business is part of this ""Empire Zone"" thing, which provides tax benefits to businesses. It's pretty much the only thing the state has done that's really helped us out - personally (since we're an S-corp) and business wise: we don't have to pay NYS sales tax, which is a really big help for a company that buys as much stuff locally as we do.

We just got word that NYS is going to 're-certify' Empire Zone businesses, which means that we're almost certainly going to lose our certification. That's bad.

What's REALLY bad, though, is that when you lose your certification, you lose it RETROACTIVELY for the last year. So we will now owe taxes for all the stuff we bought, and 're-owe' all the other tax breaks, that we got since January 1, 2008.

Since they told us this AFTER the tax deadline, we now have to pay to do all our taxes - business and personal - again.

And they have informed us that they don't know WHEN they will tell us about the re-certification, so we don't know when we CAN file our taxes again.

Also, when they DO deny our certification and charge us retroactively for the 'business help' they generously gave us, they will also charge us INTEREST on that amount for the time they spent deciding what to do.

Let's hear it for business-friendly New York State!"

"event","I've seen some sappy posts about earth day, which was apparently yesterday. It hardly matters. Not to put too fine a point on it, but talking about fluorescent lights won't save the fucking planet.

Extravagant hyperbole, and a preternatural ability among 'environmentalists' to focus on the least important aspects of ecology, rather than the glaring, jump-in-your-face ones, and a 'flavor of the month' approach to the whole shebang (Remember the '80s, when it was pollution? Remember the '90s, when it was deforestation? And now it's carbon!) has resulted in a formerly environmentalist David deciding that the whole mess is pointless, because environmentalists are, in fact, actively causing the destruction they seek to prevent by diverting resources from the real issues.

If the best thing that environmentalists can do for the world is to make it illegal for me to buy incandescent light bulbs, I'm not going to be part of it. I will joyfully continue running six computers 24/7 and joyfully continue using big, power-gobbling CRT monitors.

If you want to save the world, invest in nuclear power. End of story. Power is absolutely EVERYTHING for the planet; every problem and solution, from global warming to world hunger, is directly related to power. Solve power, and you solve the everything, because you can do anything with enough power.

And the only ways to practically solve power in the near term are geothermal and nuclear power. And geothermal is out until we get quite a bit further along in materials research.

Anything else is feel-good whitewash - or worse, active sabotage of the only real method we have to substantially reduce greenhouse emissions and pollution.

So, if you want me to get excited about 'the earth' again, start focusing on something that will solve the problem rather than stroke your ego into thinking your compost pile is defeating global warming. You can come and get me - I'll be in my office, with the heat and the A/C on at the same time."

"event","So, Radiohead's doing this remix contest thing (with no prize, hah). They uploaded the 'stems' - the individual tracks - from ""Nude"" and are having people remix it. Even though the latest Radiohead album sounds precisely like every other Radiohead album, I figured it's worth supporting guys who are ditching the majors.

At any rate, it turns out that their terms and conditions say you turn over all rights for your remix to Warner and XL Recordings, as well as giving sole credit to Radiohead. Fuck that shit! So, I sent an email to XL saying, basically, Fuck that shit! And lo, they responded. I ended up getting into a discussion with the XL person, and she was nice enough and open-minded enough that I decided to do it anyway.

Naturally, I'm doing it my way, which means it's hardly a remix at all - I just grabbed the stems, chopped about 15 seconds worth of samples, and wrote the track without even listening to the original. There's nothing at all Radioheady about it, aside from the pained, incoherent voice samples.

I've decided that I will indeed take credit for it - because Radiohead sure as hell didn't write it. And I'll put it on my web site. And if somebody decides they want to sue me, I'll milk the publicity for everything it's worth, and capitulate in the end, thus ruining Radiohead's reputation for progressive indieness. Muahah. Or something.

"event","Mark did this. Now I'm doing it. If you respond here by midnight asking to be asked questions, I'll come up with some for you (or, to add a twist, delegate someone else to do so) and you have to post the questions and answers in your LJ.


1. Why aren't you a race car driver?

I didn't realize early enough.

2. Aside from your wife, who's the most remarkable person you've ever met?

Two people. Inside my family, my father; it's difficult to describe what makes him so in a small space, but a representative anecdote is that he was designing a device to measure aerosolized adenosine in the breath (to detect heart attacks) and, in the process, ended up doing novel research in the field of chemistry. He started getting questions from research chemists involved in the project addressed to ""Michael Wiernicki, PhD"" because everybody assumed he had a PhD in chemistry from his work. Really he'd only started learning about it a few months before.

Outside my family, Dave Kaemmer, the president and one of the founders of <a href=""http://www.iracing.com"">iRacing</a>. His company is making driving simulation software, and he's largely responsible for making driving simulation on the PC a reality, and a respectable one, in the late '90s. But more than that, the sheer raw intelligence and creativity in him is palpable. He's one of the only people I've met who makes me feel slow.


3. What music would you absolutely have to have with you on the proverbial desert island? (Assume small-capacity, solar-powered iPod.)

A bunch of Haydn, Mozart, Bach, etc. Ideally a lot of *good* chamber music.
Nine Inch Nails.
Pretty much any mix Armin Van Buuren has done (he's a Dutch DJ who spins progressive trance).

4. ""Torchwood"" or ""Battlestar Galactica""?

I haven't watched BSG in two years and I've never seen Torchwood. I actually haven't watch scripted series TV at all in about two years.

5. If the president of the RIAA and the chairman of the MPAA were both drowning and you only had time to dispatch one of them, what would you use to fashion a makeshift harpoon?

In the time it would take to kill one, I could probably save both; they're probably tough bastards. Killing them would put me at risk and they'd be replaced anyway. Saving them would put them in my debt, force them to communicate with me, which would allow me to learn something about them, and generate press I could use to communicate my views to a wider audience."

"event","It was the day after Christmas. Marlo and I, hardy and crazy souls we are, decided to venture from our Brooklyn apartment into Manhattan - not to shop, mind you; we're crazy but not stupid - but just to watch other people go nuts trying to return stuff.

So we're walking around Manhattan, and of course she wants to go to the, well - for the sake of lawsuit avoidance, let's call it the Build-a-Boar Workshop, where you can stuff your own cutesy-wootsy boar to be your best friend for ever and ever. This store is all the rage among the tween set. Marlo is, in some ways, like a 12-year-old, and this is one of them.

But: It's the day after Christmas, and all the brilliant parents who got their kids gift certificates to Build-a-Boar forgot that they would HAVE TO go in the next day to build their boars - HAVE TO HAVE TO MOM WE HAVE TO PLEASE??

This means that about 10% of the population of New York City is at the Build-a-Boar Workshop, and lest the store run afoul of maximum occupancy regulations, there's security outside the store, and a huge line of hopeless-looking parents and bouncy children outside. It was like a Miami dance club, except the bouncers were throwing out anyone over 14.

It appeared that we were doomed to failure. But! I have learned never to underestimate the love of my life.

*Next* to Build-a-Boar Workshop is the 'My Occasional Friends' workshop, which is run by the same theming-mad-scientists who concocted the Build-A-Boar Workshop.

And Marlo, ever vigilant, recalled that there is a passageway between the two stores. Few people, however, were at My Occasional Friends, because building boars is much more popular. It was nearly vacant, and security was nowhere to be seen.

As such, we entered the store unhindered, strolled through the passageway, and - voila! - we were in the heretofore verboten Build-a-Bear workshop. Success, and onward to racks of tiny boar outfits!

So, in short, Marlo:

a: Found a security mechanism designed to prevent entry to a closed area

b: Identified a security flaw

c: Exploited the flaw to enter the closed area via a back door

My wife, the hax0r: I love her more every day. And consider this story well when next you bring your offspring to a Build-a-Boar workshop. If this is what their physical security is like, imagine their credit card database..."

Victim of attempted murder, Bruce Willis lived free and very nearly died hard. As it turns out, however, he was unbreakable. And while he lacked the sixth sense necessary to stay out of striking distance of our cat, Bruce chowed down on a breakfast of champions after surviving the night. He's nobody's fool: Death doesn't become him, and his armageddon will have to wait. Cuter than twelve monkeys, he who once was a perfect stranger is now clearly the alpha dog. Only the last full measure will tell if he goes back over the hedge or stays within our four rooms, but until then he'll definitely be treated to the whole nine yards.

Enjoy your stay, Mr. Willis. Your future is in your extremely tiny paws.

A few weeks ago, I decided that I wasn't listening to my stereo system downstairs in my office very much, and I wanted to set up a better home theater sound system. My amp downstairs has 5.1, S/PDIF, etc, so I figured I'd bring it upstairs and set up the home theater. While I was at that, I figured I'd bring my good 12"" speakers up and use them as the mains upstairs.

It was a hit to not have music downstairs, but I figured it was worth the compromise.

After a while I started missing the music, and while I had some random speakers Neil wasn't using and said weren't very good, I still had no amp.

Well, I was cleaning my office, and remembered I'd hidden away my old amplifier - a Harman/Kardon 330c from back in the <i>day</i>. It was covered with stickers, from when I was a jackass, filthy, and generally in sad shape.

I spent this evening cleaning it off, rubbing my fingers raw with GooGone. It was pretty unlikely the poor thing would even work.

It works.

The crappy speakers? Must be Neil had them hooked to a bad amp, because the speakers are awesome. If anything, they're better the newer ones.

And the old, dusty, stickered-up amplifier, that's been through the wars? It's a Harman/Kardon. It sounds completely fantastic, probably close on to my good friend's new Marantz. The thing is alive, not just functional, but <i>alive</i> with the sound it makes. (Not that the Marantz isn't awesome, too, Dave! :) )

And my compromise, where I figured I'd get a better system upstairs in exchange for the lack of a system downstairs? Well, I have a better system downstairs now too. All I did was want it. And this happens repeatedly, assuredly, in every aspect of my life.

I hope it doesn't sound like I'm gloating. I have to tell people because I think it can happen to everybody. This doesn't happen to me because I somehow deserve it more.

I can only thing of two things that might separate me from others: That the things I want, I want with utter passion, and that there has never been any doubt in my mind that I can achieve <i>anything.</i>

I don't think it's ever been conceivable to me that my life is limited. It's just never occurred to me.

So, the paramount thing is this: <i>Want everything with every fibre of your being, until even when you aren't aware of it you direct your actions to your purpose, and believe with every cell in your body and shred of self in your soul that you will achieve what you desire.</i> Doing so, you will make it so. Everyone, <i>every single one of you</i> still living and breathing - you can do this for yourselves."

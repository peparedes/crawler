I often take literal meanings to heart, many days bygone, I have emerged. 


much needed silence from what I spouted easily on-line, to help the self to unwind

sense of self clouded by who could hear my thoughts, lovingly uttering such caring words

found relevance in any fleeting bit of encouragement, or sweetness sent as understanding

blessed by those who grabbed my face, spoke while staring into my eyes, calmly when I cried

pain came as arms twisted behind me were pulled up nice and tight, firm grasp, body and mind

stripped bare before those I face day to day, reflections in the mirror only truths, unrepentant

opened wide to be judge by peers, and even those not of my kind, face lifted always in defiance

here in lies the ultimate in self aware ~ still I am defiant ~ control eludes me if this remains"

packing for the house, we move in Thursday, work on Friday, and all of our stuff moves Saturday
glee utter glee, wide smiles don't fade away. a picket fence in need of heads to top it sweetly.
reason to become more acquainted with the local ranges, feels good to know we'll hold ourselves safely, in our own Sanctuary.

there is summer's end restlessness, and we are dealing well, steering ourselves clear from easy paths of succumbing, allowing our energy to build in various directions, to feel is best, facing the world, eyes peeled wide. and we are open. accepting. even inviting. there is a new force coming from us, and we are careful with the insights we are experiencing.

we Rock, not as we have of late, there is new direction. Lumpy's growth and faith in what He stands for is amazing to watch unfolding, threatening to consume Him, He is careful, always He finds the balance in what He allows to surround Him, though pushing through what He fears, to hear what He truly is, inspires me once again.

our boundaries have been tested, the belief they did not exist is gone, and with it comes enlightenment. my Mother still believes we live without ethics, or moral. those closer have found out differently, the hard way, and are no more.

the girlie side is accessible, it heals others and myself in turn. my guard is up, the ability to protect returns, coursing through me without an inkling of doubt, it just is. I promised no physical violence, unless defense was needed. the lesson will be better taught if applied first mentally...what comes from that will come from that."

both gone.
no connection between them,
only me.
relief, then saddened, my own emotions,
had no impact as it was post mort-em.
one gone in fear of confinement.
one freed from relationships not meant to continue.
I almost feel icky attributing their lives unto this connection,
but their choices, were followed with the same actions,
creating a vortex within my family,
all the same,
in the end,
it is finally over,
for them both.

bastard, definitively,
life and death a pussy
coward at heart,
holding another's life hostage
alas the beatings will stop
strung himself above,
still looking down,
she lay crumpled at his feet,
broken and bloodied by his hands,
he swung smugly,
knowing they would come for him,
finally he got away.
she morns the lose,
cries in agony,
still wishing
she could save him,
could change him,
even bring him back,
she would.
enduring the physical pain,
was nothing compared to loosing him this way.
she believes she failed him,
though she gave him everything,
beyond what he deserved.
he gave her nothing,
only the continued heartache,
for her life it will remain,
the last gift,
deepest pain. 

one lost soul,
he saw a different world,
traveled the globe,
never connected as he wished,
longed for the love he felt was missed.
kept close unto only himself,
the truths to how he hurt,
souls agony,
never knowing we all feel as deeply.
his smile, wide and cheeky,
as tall as he was.
memories of his mosh pit moments
found high somewhere in American Rock n Roll culture.
his returning as a Man,
full of promise for the future,
learning from us again,
this time it was better agriculture,
he took knowledge back to his home land,
and belief he would change the landscape.
there came a time when it hurt so profoundly.
never knowing we all hurt this deeply,
he slipped away,
and it went unknown,
how betrayed his inner world became,
he found escape,
hanging,
out."

    					<div>The favorite child of Zeus, Athena sprung fully grown out of her father's head. There's some confusion about how all this came about but the short version and accepted story is that when Zeus first wife became pregnant Zeus swallowed her. In her captured state she began to make a robe and helmet for her soon to be born daughter. The hammering of the helmet caused Zeus great pain in the form of a migraine headache. His son Hephaestus ran to his father and cracked open his skull and from it emerged Athena, fully grown and wearing her new armor. Having been born of gods and infused with Zeus's power a second time made Athena one of the most powerful gods on Earth proving that it's not just a mans place on the battlefield. In acts of war, women are equal if not more cruel and it's thanks to her that we all recognize this. (Or did for a while) Her followers built the city of Athens for her and she's been receiving nods of recognition ever since. Her following has dwindled in recent centuries because people don't often bring wisdom into battle with them. Preferring instead the more ""in your face"" approach of Mars. However those who want to actually win a war and bring back some living troops might want to start sending a few prayers her way and build a temple or two. Her followers believe in Wisdom, War and Equality</div><p><a href=""http://www.helloquizzy.com/tests/the-ohmigod-test"">Take The Ohmigod Test</a> at <a href=""http://www.helloquizzy.com/""><b style=""color:#131313""><span style=""color:#ac000c"">H</span>ello<span style=""color:#ac000c"">Q</span>uizzy</b></a></p>

Pisces (Feb 19 - Mar 20)

It may feel as if there's movement just outside of your reach. Someone in your life is changing and you cannot stop the process, even if it worries you. Exercising control over something within your sphere of influence may be more about showing off your power than doing anything of real significance. Instead of wasting your mind power on trivial matters, save your energy for when you need it later on in the week.

I think this was in my mind's eye yesterdays myspace quote
""trivialis gad, trier treowth, cor, valere"" 
it's pinkked meaning ~ trivial impulses, try truth, heart, be strong

I can maintain for the next 3 months, I Will maintain and not use my voice to berate and harass the current management team, knowing they will probably be gone before my 3 months is up. searching for a place now, has humbled me, the perfect places I find are snatched up by the next day, and I know when our time comes, the place we are meant to inhabit will be available, and within reach. it will be, and so I do believe. though I know nothing comes from doing nothing, so I begin the fun of calling and setting up appointments with lovely property management teams who believe so admiringly that their ghetto, crack infested hovels are just perfect for a sweet couple like Lumpy and me. I smile back brightly and just let them know, No, and I won't even bring Lumpy to tell them No, so let's move onto your next perfect, ideal, charming place that you can see us in...and so the searching has begun...this time I vow to unpack all of our boxes in the dining room before we move, and simply part company with emotional attachments that do not serve us anymore...if it does not have a resting place in our new home, it will not travel to clutter that space, the un-cluttering has also begun, I feel for the moment, like the grown-up I have claimed to have become.

with all the general chaos of a band, compounded by the red tape of a singer in the Army, COUNTERSTEP is on a semi hold for about 9 months atleast regarding playing live shows, they are still preparing for a studio stint, which is much needed for their souls. it leaves us the evenings to become more available to support our friends bands throughout the summer months. even though I don't have an official day off until August 31st, our calendar is filling up! 

strange things remain ~ I'm attempting to conjour up the energy to apply at a pharmacy 5 miles from my parents monday-friday, if it all works out I'll be moving back to butte county during the week and coming home to Sac friday nights to continue in Dixon on the weekends. 7 days a week in a pharmacy would be great for my spirit! 

the worry of placing myself back in my own way, remains only a flutter in my mind.
I have actually felt great about my choices to remain free of self~destruction, it amazes only me.

"event","got my state check, and it's burning my soul, easy solution ~ just go to a show! inner turmoil of a Warriors spiritual versus physical desires. every part of my being would have already blown it on wasting away. though somehow I have found the way to combat my own drowning in the wanting by allowing the spirit to gain the upper hand regarding my wants. 

there is a show tomorrow night, over priced, at a place I do despise ~ the whiskey to pepsi ratio is never right at the Boardwalk, the grown ups must stay in their pen, the sound guy is hard of hearing and does not appreciate the beauty of METAL, not to mention the way they treat the TALENT who is willing to play their club. I will admit I've had some of my best experience with Rock N Roll since age 15 at this very club, may that be the reason I feel so deeply about a place? so why am I cashing my check and paying to get all my close ROCKIN FRIENDS to hang out in a place we all hate together? because we'll be there supporting a Yuba City band ZERO GROUND! These guys are awesome and deserve all the support I can unleash! They play first and we will be there in force to support them! Of course after they play we will all be taking our drunken debauchery right outta that crappy club, to head over to The Y and support more great music where the drinks are stiff, the door is cheap, the bartender remembers me and the owner will play drums with his METAL band while we ENJOY spending our hard earned cash at his fine establishment. I really don't have a problem with spending money anywhere to see the bands I love. I do revel in the ability to also show the local promoters and clubs that it is the fans who create and maintain their lifestyle, because of the lifestyle we choose to live. it's good to have the federal government kick me back my cash right when I feel like making a point in my own scene.

 I find also a growing in the desire to rid myself of my cash in this manner, for the greater good, for my friends who seriously need a night out, for supporting music I adore (yep adore!) for choosing to feed my own soul, for denying my physical desire and realizing I can"

"event","the Lady I call *B* would pull my hair, look right into my eyes, and simply ask ""Where is the respect? and familiarity? Who the fuck IS *B*?"" She calls me Critter or THE Crash Test Dummy and I  have earned both names rightly over our many years together and apart. Belinda will always hold a place in my heart, as I remain in hers. One of the few people who give me bobbles and beads not to see my tits butt to laugh hysterically at me while I uncontrollably play with my new shiny toy! The struggles she faces maybe hers to face, butt she knows I may just show up, in the wee hours, playing Aqua's Barbie song and whisk her away for whatever then comes up. Her easy smile and sweet laugh still ring true in my heart. I wish you well my darling as you face the next peaces of this life.

the WIVES, I call them Bitches, because they are! Catty and willful they bring with them the turbulence and stress. I am always glad to see them at shows. Hoping they have finally found the peace to enjoy their Man's artistic release, and are the showing their support. I realize my relationships with them are superficial, and often one sided from my own stand point. Though I find solace in the fact that they are still reaching out and trying to share music with their partners. mayhap I have had some influence on what they believe we are all really doing there. The reason I cherish my time with them is simple. I do see how they react while their other half is playing, it's mind blowing to see their eyes light up and the corners of their lips curl into a smile. When they let themselves really enjoy the show it makes me giddy. I truly learn that we are all so different from these wonderful ladies. that no matter what brought us together for that time, we share the moment. 

excerpt from The Pinkk Mind chapter the Ladies who teach me

rather dismal can be one's own outlook to the world. it takes the view of others to really show us what is along our path. be it how they view us or how we in turn look out, there is always a variation in the view. some will come, some will go, only we remain the same. it becomes our task to unravel the mystery of what we took from each relationship, then we must determine how we grow. the influence I have on another is true. even the impact I did not intend to have on another, remains throughout their life, and mine. all of these Ladies have left their sometimes unintentional mark on me. I thank them for helping me grow in this life"

"event","I do see myself in peaces of the ultimate jigsaw. there are distinct faces to my unleashing. the drinking causes the flirt to be allowed, unabashed. simply I lie to lesbians, mayhap to straight girls too. not abut the feelings they bring out in me, they get me soooooo hot, butt Lumpy reaps the rewards. there have been a few in the right position I was willing to, the circumstances did not permit full contact and they eventually were pushed away. those who enjoy *drunk Christy* miss her when *sober Christy* stays all night. the problem lies in how they are allowed to see me, I finally glimpsed the difference this weekend...so much I saw this weekend...friday night into sunday brought about so much facing the changes. friday night was complete unleashed allowed unto myself...happiness and love of my friends poured forth. there were those from work I finally get to spend time with because we no longer work in the same place, also those who know both Christy's and prefer to just spend time with me, and then the beauty full strangers who became friends based on their love of the scene closest to my heart...the band wife who I groped before I realized who she was because she was smiling and that's just absurd coming from her...the glowing pregnant woman I freak danced with until I realized I did not know her, many blushes from my drunkenness for sure! there are definately 2 of me at shows, my obvious enthusiasm and freedom allowed while drunk friday night, I saw myself so reserved and controlled while enjoying the same show the next night, the major change was the lack of liquor I consumed. not really surprised, not even wondering why I behave so differently. it is the sense of releasing my self on nights I drink, allowing me to enjoy it all freely...almost like when truely allowing the release of the lash only when closing my eyes, to free only me.

Friday brought about a rather sad realization also...my night to admit I meddled and tried to make things happen to fix it with them, and Him. It was only fixed for me, the finality of it all took my breathe from me. Choosing it was not important enough was proof we are not important enough, and said all that need be said by not coming to say a single word. alas I felt the chain break free from me, the cold steel slipped away and in it's place was the warmth of understanding, all that really matters to me is what I have and who I know I am.  

Funny is those who know me free even in sobriety would never choose drunk Christy over sober Christy"

"event","such a crazy week, for so many I know...but I will only comment on how it has touched my own weaknesses.

strained communications between my pinchy rubia and myself, from so long ago the pain healed over the wounds and we moved on, and on, and on. though myspace allows the occasional nicety of catching up. I miss her hugs and the warm laughter at my goofyness, meant only to cause her giggles. the years have given her everything she wanted, and her child is the truest form to getting it right. I have invited her, me hopes with all my heart she appears on the 12th, atleast for hugs.

those at work are dealing with my changing path in varying heartache and glee. I will still work for the company but no longer in my store, I am moving to the Sac. State campus, and look forward to it's challenging atmosphere, I thrive in chaos and the Hive has never been called less. more money and hours to start, and at the end of October a new title with some extra cash again. my lack of patience shows in my accepting this job move, butt it doesn't end my search for a job in a pharmacy, only strengthens my resolve to continue the search and find what is right for me.

lunch with M & D was different. it was nice to hold them in my arms again. I invited them on the 12th also, I do hope they show, and all goes well.

Monday signifies October finally arriving, the start of new and turbulant chapters in our lives. I seek a release to my pride as a barrier in our lives. Can I release it while watching from the sidelines of His life returning to His control, it is again my hope. I gather strength and determination close to my heart, knowing the challenges will become apparant quickly from this point, I stand ready to protect if needed, yet to allow my own guard down enough for Him to fight through whatever He chooses to battle this coming year. I know He will conquer His dreams as only He can. I will fight along side of Him, instead of ahead of Him, no longer keeping the demons at bay, now slaying them together. seeing Him alas as the mighty Warrior He has always been.

amazing what I see now that I'm willing to open my eyes and look around us, instead of striking it all down with my eyes sealed tightly shut."

"event","is there ever a good time to deal with death? rhetorical, no need to include the peanut gallery response of just trying too ease away the pain. alas the pain has been reclaimed, the momentary anger has washed itself away yet again. My Burn was healing and at times a bit distracting, or so it seemed. in reality I'm rather guarded about the whole experience, it's safer for others that way.

integrity ~ 1 completeness 2 unimpaired condition; soundness 3 honesty, sincerity etc.

this word was used to describe something I was doing in my personal life, will it still apply to what I intend to do henceforth? I have hope I am being sincere still. the question is in honesty, to the one I care most for. I honestly believe I am doing right by Him, by doing this behind His back. I do it soundly in a loud and crowded place. I forsee the completeness that could come from this, though I can also view a disasterous outcome from my need to fix things. Will is strong and I know His is also... worrying does nothing since I have already put it into motion, now I Will stand strong next to Him and know what happens is whats meant to be.

regarding death as applied to the dead:
I can move passed the part of no longer having them in my daily life. I have cried, screamed, dreamed, cried some more, for them, to them, and with them. it is true they are gone from my physical touch, though the imprint they left on my heart remains forever with me.

regarding death as applied to the living:
Only I can find a way to resurrect those I choose to believe were buried to soon. some relationships must be within the realm of still within reach, or they would have completely destroyed all bridges of reconnection already. paths back into those we have cut away generally come from a reason. or mayhap I am a greedy bitch, just trying to justify my own decisions of late."

"event","every effort becomes rather poignant. there is twisted bliss in an uneasy time. the awakening is still streaming through my veins. my mind never as fast as the heart strings pulley, weighted from what is to come. vast experience never quite within the needed realm. wholehearted is my determination. where to go from here? what space ours remains? what place mine to fill? leaps ahead are basins wide and growth to fear is know where to hide. In the solace of the sunrise I whispered lovingly to mine own mind, the fears, the dreams, even that of which I do not speak, was given the voice a chance to breath. truth from hugs, and bitten not so deep, both set in motion sweet relief to admitting what I want is within reach. I seek, I seek, I seek release ~ I need, I need, I need to believe ~ I wish, I wish, I wish for this ~ I am, I am, I am willing and able ~ I give, I give, I give myself to you, completely."

time to express my sadness regarding an unexpected trip to the Sleep Train, yes I should have been preparing for the playa, butt I inverted the thought into ~ seeing Slayer & Marilyn Manson was a great way to prepare my heart for playa life, eh whatever works it was a surprise gift from Lumpy, and Carl so we went and I was excited to see such Monsters in my musical heart actually playing together! Slayer was everything that is speed metal Rock Gods personified. I sat in wonder, trying to understand how they have continued to conquer so awesomely what shredding really means. I give their technical crew mad props as well. I happen to love the twisted use of lighting not just a person, butt an entire band in putrid green light for a whole song without wavering and giving into their own technical knowledge that you shouldn't throw green on people. it was great! they seemed to play forever Tuesday night I had made the right choice for sure, dude! as for the sadness, it came in the form of Marilyn Manson. what a crock of steaming shit. no stage show and a really bad technical set, I have never been the girl to yell sell out, and bullshit at a show,  butt I was moved to do just that half way thru the crap. I guess I did have an expectation for MM atleast amuse me, if not able to offend me, where the hell did the entertainment value of it all go? it was my call, the guys would have all left after Slayer, butt they held out with me, until I gave up and decide we could bail. the ticket price was worth it because Slayer was righteous. butt now I wonder if I'll take the chance on Manson anymore....oh well it's time to finish packing and git her done for playa fun ~ 2 days 2 days only 2 fucking days away"

"event","the bathroom was huge, and twas also a cage for the snake. a very beauty full snake, bright red with yellow diamonds upon it's back. I understand it's pattern, even where the image came from, the unknown is always from the known. the vivid remnants are it's speed, and force with which it decided to attack me. grabbing thru the cobwebs to retain the parts I am at a loss to explain...I entered willingly, it scurried into the corner, I could hear it gliding, then woosh ~ the long wall betwixt door and toilet came down, replaced with a solid plate of light blue glass looking out into the front room where they all sat in varying slumped positions, most were rocking numbly in their rocking chairs, He strummed idly on His acoustic, that goofy smile plastered to the lips, such a clown. as I took the deepest breath I've ever felt, it was time to walk, one foot raised, my eyes found the toilet it seemed at least a mile away, I screamed as it's fangs barely grazed as if to taste me ~ ""what the hell the snake attacked me"" no change, they just rocked out there, and strange I did not turn to retreat, planted the bitten foot and raised the left continued on still watching the toilet bowl gleaming so far away, yet I was getting closer, and still they rocked. I heard the sliding skin as it did a huge lap across the floor felt it glide past my feet and the from the corner of my eye I saw it leap away from me towards the gleaming bowl, it turned as it reached the toilet and as it came back my way it's jaw unhinged, the fangs were glistening with it's venomous juices, I did not scream, I turned my neck up almost lovingly, I could see them rocking nonchallantly, and I squueezed my eyes shut tight so I would not see then I felt the lick upon my cheek I opened my eyes groggily as Lemmy girl plopped her furry belly onto my head and continued to lick my salty tears from my cheek. that fuckin cat doesn't even like me, butt I snuggled down with her love and thought about the strangness I had just dreamed, not really to concerned with what it means, just happy to be petting the beast I house who came to me while lost within my dreams. then she left and I got up still in desperate need of that morning pee.

diddly diddly doo, beee bop beeedoo and a scittly scittly scram ma lamma lamma lamma diddly doo de rah rah rah ripply ripply rah rah diddly do 

there isn't much unknown in fear, it may take on a new face comparatively to what has been seen, that does not change bold face behind fears masked claims

I go today to visit with the folks, pick up the EZ up and any other physical needs for the Burn, tomorrow I will start accumulating the fun things I seek..
I'm finally allowing the excitement to take hold, things are appearing in the living room, marked, going. Lumpy laughs at me trying to not show my happiness, I know He does not begrudge me the trip, butt since He is not joining me on the playa I am trying not to float away before I leave. it is strange to wrap my head around the Burn without all of the usual necessary planning and ordered chaotic expectedness of being a part of a theme camp. I know part of me will miss TOA on the playa, admittedly many parts of me have missed TOA in the real world. finally a bit of a break through allowed aloud. this year I camp with veterans who dwell in providing the experience to others who have never ventured atop the silky playa. of 15, there are going to be 9 new hearts to enjoy our time within the Man's Burning embrace. I go as guide and watchful heart to those who may become overwhelmed. I go seeking my own idealized hope I will remain true to the path I chose, I once again set along the path of testing my own will, facing a heated world of desires laced with unholy things I desire, the path is mine only to hold at bay what I choose is mine own way. maybe today I will tempt my fate again with one more visit into my favorite den, to help renew my own reserve that I will make it out alive, as I thrive in choices to not destroy my own life. 

enough crap has been spewed, to dance thru this day, it's time again to dance

We were spoiled at GWAR, covered in blood & cum juices of grotesque fun ~ all for the price of $20. seeing Suicidal Tendencies was the added bonus of watching a trainwreck as it happens. In alot of ways we have healed from within music's painful awareness. I have 2 favorite songs by Counter Step (neither are on their cd) Beef Jerky (Lumpy's song) and Next 2 You (the Fuck You song) Both touch me deeply and in very different ways. Beef Jerky is a heavy riffin' thick song that showcases my ole man's talents on guitar. most don't know the story behind Beef Jerky and when they ask they probably don't get the truth anyway, it's too much to explain to adrunk in a crowded bar. plus killing the one who must die almost seems self explanatory and why the fuck isn't there anything in the song about beef jerky? what the fuck does it all mean? Next 2 You holds true to it's nature all you gotta remember is Fuck You Fuck You"

"event","the first hug was timid, formal, and given out of respect. 2 hours later the hugs were true, and given with absolute warmth. that said even more than the words we exchanged. I love M, and D, as much today as when our friendship was strong. I am not sure what will become of our friendship now, butt I know my heart has once again opened to them. the doors to His heart remain locked tight. I wrestle with how to change this, I wrestle with Him physically to change this. maybe M is right in understanding this will take time.

Other truths have surfaced, I believe He grows stronger into His own. He is granting Himself peace by letting go of His hatred for another soul at this moment in life. that could be why He will not let go at this time, with them. In truth He holds my love and praise at bay regarding LRC. Butt HOT DAMN I'm floored by what He plans to take on. He has given it a timetable, and voice which makes it become even more real into this time and space. I swear there is no greater joy than watching Him fully fill His destiny with all it's inconvenient feelings. He is AMAZING! I am in awe of His unpredictable nature, and the depth which He forges into what must be, He must be able to create. I am the luckiest lady, to belong to Him completely. to watch as He conquers what others believe will never be, does remind me it is necessary not only possible."

"event","I have lost my mischievious knack for surprises, I think my own excitement makes me transparent. Lumpy thinks as I get older I just become easier to read, me thinks he's known me to frigging long. 

Work is not fun, or exciting, it has become trivial and bothersome, I am just bitching from the rut. It's time to flourish within the madness. I seek the answers from a far away home.

This year it is about the warmth and realizing I can follow my own path of shiny, or blinky, fuzzy, and distracted. I know how I will go, with those I kinda know, but mostly I go alone, to find something that is just for mine mind. Wondering if it is from self distruction, and wounded heart or mayhaps from growth within my own healing.

They have reached out and made contact, I responded in my way, and of course it might not have had the same effect. It rattled this house, it was a hard week to say the least. His anger has not died, me hopes the surfacing lets Him farther through it. There is a simplicity to our existence together. For me you will not hurt Him, I lick my wounds just fine, and can whip your ass myself. For Him it is the same, you do not hurt me if ever expecting His reprieve, I've found it just doesn't come easily. There is a grotesque love in strength from our duality."

"event","so much has gone, we face moving on, smiling through tears, we've had too many beers. there is quiet excitement, and sad truths we have had to deal with, it is all part of this life, we embrace it. I have hidden from some, it makes my escape seem easier to not view myself through their minds eye, and yet I can hold myself accountable from their point of view within my own heart. the peaces I gave up last year only haunt me from my dreams, the sweet longing to taste may never leave me, I digest my own needs and ingest the simple breath to remain alive, unlike those around me of late.

I struggle with my own accomplishments, transcend into encouragement of those I can reach without allowing the alien out of it's gates. I no longer shed a tear for what I was, who they were, and where it could have went, I accept how it has become this day. that does not mean I give up the battle, only that I have regrouped within the trenches, waging on as is the honorable way. 

There is joy that my pharmacy technician program has ended, and the hunt may now become intensified for my place within the field. Graduation, Certification, where stepping stones to Registration which came through on July 19th. Now I can find a job within California. Though becoming certified opens doors anywhere amid all 50 beauty full states, and everyone can see my Carney heart traveling if the right oppurtunity arises. The next few years will be about repairing our financial status, paying off school, the debts we accumulated along the way, and enjoying giving back to those who surrounded us in times of need.

Lumpy's strength throughout my misery of late, has brought us somehow closer. Watching Him grow again has healed some of my resentments towards the universe in general. His heart still hardens unto others, yet His wisdom in accepting His own demons encourages my belief He will ride through the pains one day. I only wish Him further growth and happiness along the way. Watching as He finds the strength to face bands loss, and pushing it on swearing it must continue is a freedom He had lacked for so long. I revel in His strength to remain true through the muck, knowing His dreams remain alive in His soul.

blah, blah, blah
I finally have a computer at home again. I can no longer get into my tribe account old email account set up problems so my email info, livejournal and myspace are my techie links to others cyberwise. my new car hates as most of my cars always have, who knows when that will be operating again. butt the early morning rides to work give us more time to spend together right now. work sucks, butt it's why I went back to school so I am processing that the changes are coming our way.

I can only hope the way is the one in which I follow along though distracted by the scenery along the path may make me sometimes wonder if it is right."

"event","How do you express the love you have for another before their gone? You hug them tight when their close, and you remind them every chance you get, that they matter. the tears haven't passed and I know they may not anytime soon. not really sure how to even express how much you've meant to me all these years, somehow I am sure you knew. our bond was fated a telltale summer night in June, it feels like so long ago, we giggled and smoked laughing until the sun rose again. it never mattered to either one of us what others spoke of just what kind of relationship we had. you were and will always remain my brother, a true friend, and a reminder to my heart that we can only be who we really are. I thank you for the acceptance and your direct approach to being a part of my life as long as you could. I will remember to laugh at myself, and that I do have that strange mystic power over the souls of men such as yourself, along with the honesty to admit Yep I too am part CARNEY! the rambling spirit you kept alive is still proof to your freedom being complete unto your soul.

I don't have the ability to change others minds, some have been set free since you have, others will remain entrapped in what they still believe you should have been. My promises to you have not been fulfilled because you have been set free, they remain a part of us as long as I remain to keep them. I will ride the tilt a whirl, play a game *winning some silly stuffed beast* drink an overpriced beer for it's cold refreshing value, and buy a trinket along our midway this year, of course I'll look for him and hug him tight with no retribution felt because it matters not from this point forth the change came Saturday and I know you found the sweet escape into peace alas.

Our last hug we did well and for that I have no regrets. You always felt just how much we loved you, and I've always known how much we mattered to you. I'll smile bravely every time I miss you and again I thank you for the love we've shared. Only I could have stopped Dad from molesting those mannequins at the sex shoppe and only your Dad would attempt to molest them just to get my undivided attention. *I love ya Brother you will never be forgotten*"

"event","peacefull and wearing my favorite outfit ~ anyone who knows me can guess what I'm wearing hehehehee found some release at the show last Saturday, it was much needed. Exstatic over the new video for Counterstep's Brace For Impact eventually it will be viewable by the general public & I'll learn how to post it everywhere in cyber hell *jumpin' up & down doin' a little dance* ok I'm back :>)

Tonight we get to enjoy some East Coast sounds from Clutch's new album I am blessed THANKS Carl your the best! I don't even have to drive into the city so I'm blessed again. The drive into Crockett last weekend wasn't that bad the drive out brought about some anxiety butt I drove through it, gabbing about the show & remembering to keep my eyes focused on the road. Silly that how I relax along a roadtrip can also bring on panic attacks when cruising over the bridges. Guess ya gotta have something to bring on the panic oh well such is life.

Fell into another loop of mindness misery thought it wouldn't be so easy to climb from the muck butt decided to yell fuck you to those who violated me. haven't replaced the car yet probably sometime next month, hope it will be better for me in the end. theory of escaping the ghetto we call home only brings about the migraine, no insurance means no pain killers so instead just easier to yell fuck you to the place we live. 

enjoying the rebuilding of my family relationships, Mother seems to even need me a bit now, Father not as angry with his dear ole daughter, guess the age has mellowed the old fart after all. Dear Dad Larry does not make me cry at all these days, if I feel about him at all, I smile sweetly as I yell fuck you into the wind just for him. Little brother and I have come to exchange birthday presents through the mail with the occasional pleasantry of a phone call to wish each other well. as for the siblings of unnecessary to even build rivalry the fuck you would be wasted as their own misery surrounds them.

building up new walls not to insilate myself only to climb higher into the sky as I stand proud to yell fuck you, fuck you and of course fuck you too wide smile acrossed my lips, proof I mean it whole heartedly

me thinks I'm horny and when Lumpy gets here I think I might just yell Fuck Me"

giggling at the truth ain't nothing in life that fucking bad at all. We are well I can tell I think I'm in my grumpy moon right now. Oppoortunities are knocking, I accepted a promotion at my current job (padding the old resume I am :>) Me thinks I'm just itchin' for a show ~ thank the bejesus, next Saturday the old man's band plays at Toot's in Crockett. I'm not even afeared of that crazy ass new bridge that I get the pleasure of driving over twice! woohoo sometimes I can tell I'm getting better, in my head. Accepting positions I dreaded has been calming, broken open some passive aggressive tendencies and allowed my self to claim responsibility unfortunately for some they must accept their roles to be reviewed, questioned almost constantly butt hey they will grow and perhaps be better off from it as have I.

Smitten with myspace and beyond it's reach is strong. most recently have returned to the nook of warmth with some I pined over for so many years, now I realeyes ain't none of us changed a bit, still the oddball deranged walking tall as insane, though lovingly remembered why we claimed so passionately our paths time to have once estranged. fire burns hot if placing oneself within it's flames. Heart felt loves are placed farther away not shelved for another day, only allowed themselves to define how we play. as I get to lost in the dreams before I can awake unwilling to stand and take my rightful place.

I do not dream of finding those who have most recently allowed my tears to flow, again a needed release, somehow what they stole from me should prove to be something gained. perhaps when again I can sleep I will see them and allow their torturous due to come freely me thinks I will the rage released....and then comes self confrontation as to...why must I seek the rage...when is the time I prey redeemed...where stems this need...who do I really believe me to be...what do I grant myself to see...ahh butt there is no point to bother with the worrying

"event","passing of time, alone, does not quench some thirsts. belief in who I am, Will be does not change the rush can still be felt. I darken my eyes rarely, the lids not wanting to fall forward into the deep sleep. I have caught up on nothing, or so it seems ~ the illusion, the great illusion, is myst defying. awaiting the next step as I bite my finger nails again to the quick.

Reality Check ~ we are surviving this part yet we always find the strength to continue. In an honest reminder we both willingly waste the bit of money we accumulate. I would not allow his music to go if not His choice and thankfully He could not persuade Himself to end one as another began again. My Monkey Love is now stuck between His bass in Counterstep & His guitar in Minds Under Matter (M.U.M) I am spoiled by the fact He is so talented in His art once more. Both groups bring Him something equally challenging & give Him different comforts to continue His evolution. I still long for the day He will choose to also sing those old songs, yet a part of me has been finally quieted in the asking of them. mayhap I am learning something or other with age.

Self Awareness ~ I have very little patience even now. the waiting is unnerving, some answers have come and some have not started being questioned yet. alas I have finished school, extern and taken my national certification exam (passed it!) the game of waiting is atleast 3 months more for state certification & then glorious hunt for the job can begin. I was very Lucky to extern at Kaiser, it motivated my thinking to focus on hospital work which should keep me busy enough to remain challenged.

quiet optimism, a flowing sense of allowed above the normal justified. 

passed unto acceptance of released, awkward may be the grin as at last can come again. without remorse for things I have done, or even left to be still, there would never have been understanding to what I have now found buried in the underground known as Me. 

terrors of ""love"" and the wickedness of what it should allow us to give another soul, or in truth strip from us both can overwhelm and under mind the ""good"" we believe is our own intention. still the spin flipped onto it's head grants only of course another view to enjoy. 

money matters as a daily existence of course, yet my belief it does not pave our path only ease the choice we strive for right. existence of silence may have granted the most richness I have experienced in my life thus far. I released peaces long ago, and from them know, choice to believe in right from wrong has freed me. my own naivety is not absurd enough to believe that I could pass up the monetary value that could provide for our lifetime or even just for a time, and yet against most difficulties we faced through this part of life We still did not. proof of ""right"" has not manifested in I told ya so's and look what we accomplished, and yet so much has been given back tenfold unto us, remarkably, i see, fait accompli gifted unto me.

I realize I create situations where I will be abandoned, leaving me with being right, which is a WRONG way to allow a relationship to build. Most adventures in my life have been about the trip we were on, not the people I tripped with. My association of an experience is generally jaded by what we did, not who and why I did it with them. At this point in my life I am finding the experiences more worthwhile as I seem to really believe I should be doing them with those I am with. I feel as if they are having an impact on me as individuals, and I can see why these people WANT me to participate in this stage of their lives. I feel more connected to those we spend actual time with, which allows a deeper connection to be understood regarding those not seen daily in my life.

"event","The past few weeks are gone, in a blur they passed into what's coming. I find strength from within, though it is others support that has shown me how. The next step is to apply the growth, and find my way to show others along my path. My dreams are filled with delightful spirits, Warriors, Mother Natural and the spirit of the Bear. The goats who chased me hungrily have again vanished from my dreams. Every so often they return to interrupt my daydreams as a vague reminder they are mine and will always linger with me. They are not scary in daylight as I am not asleep, and afraid they will actually eat me. Though their reminder means more in the bright of day. I can see them clearly for the purpose they serve when I am being less than aware, they are there.

My distracted yet needed absence from being on-line has served me very well. The tunnel vision and anti-social behavior are becoming easier to handle and work through. I am finally applying my worth into the adult world. My news has been withheld dependent on getting into my program, until now. I start a Pharmacy Technician program May 8th and will be graduating exactly one month before my 30th birthday. Yes, me in a pharmacy Yes, me playing as a team member, with drugs for others. I am very excited. I am more excited than scared. My program is designed to pass not fail so I know applying myself will mean I too will pass.

P.S the final joke ...

"event","Finding myself pissed off and hurt over not moving by myself to Oregon ~ was just selfishness, and warm. I have an issue with control, only when I'm not the one in control. Figments of my own reality made it easier to give way to an escapism dream. Stress and uncomfortableness are common when working towards a goal. Who would strive for happiness if it was so easy to attain? I would not, I thrive in challenge. There is no real point within this post. I promised I would find my way to a computer and share with Hope. My writing has been only in my diary for the last month, because I am a pussy and I won't share my hurt here. Many things have changed so quickly I have trouble understanding, and yet realize I need not try. We have signed a lease for the next year and a half, so remain Cali kids while we grow. From 28 to 29 I do realize it is time to admit to growing up even when it hurts the *most*. My own pain can only give way to growth if I allow it. I Will. somehow.

as for the final joke: all your meat/helmet needs we can fill for ya!

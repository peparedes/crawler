I've been up and down for you 
But I just can't get any relief 
I've swallowed my pride for you 
I've lived and lied for you 
But you still make me feel like a thief 

You got me stealin' your love away 
'Cause you never give it 
Peeling the years away 
And we can't relive it 
I make you laugh 
And you make me cry 
I believe it's time for me to fly 

You said we'd work it out 
You said that you had no doubt 
That deep down we were really in love 
Oh, but I'm tired of holding on 
To a feeling I know is gone 
I do believe that I've had enough 

I've had enough of the falseness 
Of a worn out relation 
Enough of the jealousy 
And the intoleration 
I make you laugh 
And you make me cry 
I believe it's time for me to fly 

{Refrain} Time for me to fly 
Oh, I've got to set myself free 
Time for me to fly 
And that's just how it's got to be 
I know it hurts to say goodbye 
But it's time for me to fly"

"event","Just a couple of quotes from one of my classes that I found interesting:


""But I am told that love is stronger than walls, and in this, lies my only hope. So beat down those walls with your firm but gentle hands, for the person/child in me is very sensitive and can't grow behind walls. So don't give up. I need you""

Leo Buscaglia


""Perhaps love is the process of my leading you gently back to yourself.""

Not sure who wrote that, may have been my Professor."

"event","I did it, I did it, I did it!!!!!  I finally have my Bachelors degree. It doesn't seem real, it hasn't really sunk in yet. It has been a long (way longer than 4 years) road to get here. It would have been easy for me to give up, but I didn't, and no one is prouder of myself for that than me.

My goal is to get my Masters degree, and I almost had decided to quit here and just get a job. It is a struggle to be a ""professional"" student, and it sucks not having any health insurance, but I would not have been happy with myself had I quit. I set a goal for myself, and I will reach that goal, come hell or high water. 

I have become to realize what a strong person I am. I can do anything I set my mind to. It feels good. It feels really good. I am my own destiny.. I am responsible for my successes and failures. I get very frustrated with people who like to blame others for their unhappiness, or people who whine because something is missing in their life. If you dont like your life, THEN CHANGE IT!! Get off of you ass and do something about it!! 

I also want to thank a special Daddy who has come into my life. I feel very lucky that you have chosen to take me on this journey. I have already learned so much about myself, and have realized that when I am free to be me, I am a pretty cool person. I really like myself. Most importantly, I am having a BLAST!!

"event","Well, its been a busy couple of months. I did my internship at the DOC, 240 hrs, and made a friend out of the deal. Hopefully i will have my Bachelors degree very soon, as i am done with all of my classes.. YAY!!!!!!! It's been a long, long road to get to this point, and it's not over yet. I start my Masters degree next month.

My daughter came to visit me. She is so beautiful and i am very proud of her. We had a blast!

I am dating a Dom now. Not going to say to much about it because i am not sure where it will lead. We are still in the early stages and getting to know each other, but... I am having fun, and thats what counts. 

So life is pretty good right now..not perfect, but good."

Every now and then I get a little bit lonely 
and you're never coming round 
Turn around 
Every now and then I get a little bit tired of listening to the sound 
of my tears 
Turn around 
Every now and then I get a little bit nervous that the best of all the 
years've gone by 
Turn around 
Every now and then I get a little bit terrified and then 
I see the look in your eyes 
Turn around, bright eyes 
Every now and then I fall apart 
Turn around, bright eyes 
Every now and then I fall apart 

Turn around 
Every now and then I get a little bit restless and I dream 
of something wild 
Turn around 
Every now and then I get a little bit helpless and I'm lying 
like a child in your arms 
Turn around 
Every now and then I get a little bit angry and I know I've got 
to get out and cry

And if you'll only hold me tight 
We'll be holding on forever 
And we'll only be making it right 
'Cause we'll never be wrong 
Together we can take it to the end of the line 
Your love is like a shadow on me all of the time

I'm always in the dark 
We're living in a powder keg 
And giving off sparks 
I really need you tonight 
Forever's gonna start tonight 
Forever's gonna start tonight 

Once upon a time I was falling in love 
But now I'm only falling apart 
There's nothing I can do 
A total eclipse of the heart 

Once upon a time there was light in my life 
But now there's only love in the dark 
Nothing I can say 
A total eclipse of the heart

"event","I'm so tired of being here 
Suppressed by all my childish fears 
And if you have to leave 
I wish that you would just leave 
'Cause your presence still lingers here 
And it won't leave me alone 

These wounds won't seem to heal 
This pain is just too real 
There's just too much that time cannot erase 

When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears 
When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears 
And I held your hand through all of these years 
But you still have 
All of me 

You used to captivate me 
By your resonating life 
Now I'm bound by the life you've left behind 
Your face it haunts 
My once pleasant dreams 
Your voice it chased away 
All the sanity in me 

I've tried so hard to tell myself that you're gone 
But though you're still with me 
I've been alone all along"

"event","I have been so busy with school. Never have I had this much work piled up on me. I guess being a senior, they expect more out of me.. yay me..lol. But I will be graduating this summer and start my Masters degree in the fall. So at least there is a light at the end of the tunnel. And when i finally do get my grad degree, i will be eligible for AARP.. woohoo, senior discount for coffee at McDonalds. LOL, No, I won't be that old, but old enough. 

A friend of mine in OKC messaged me last night and gave me some very interesting news.. I'm gonna keep it to myself but lets just say it put a little hitch in my giddy-up.. It put things in perspective for me.

I am looking forward to summer now.. i got the itch. Lounging out by the pool with a good book, feeling the warm sun on my body. The summer car shows, can't wait for that. My daughter will be here this summer, and i know she will want to go to Frontier City. She loves amusement parks and riding all the rides. I don't do the scary rides so I'm gonna have to find someone to go with us who will ride the scary rides with her.

Well, time to get back to writing my papers.. ughhh.

"event","I did something today that I knew I needed to do.. I went to Lake Carl Blackwell in Stillwater. In August of 1944, my grandparents, and my mom and her siser, went to Stillwater to see my grandmothers sister. While they were there they went boating out at the lake. A swell came and sank the boat. No one knew how to swim and there were only 2 life jackets, which were given to my mom and her sister. Everyone else drowned. My mom was 6 yrs old, and she almost died too. They had to give her CPR to revive her. It took the rest of the day to recover the rest of the bodies. They had to bring in rescuers from OKC to help. It was said to be the lake's first drowning tragedy. 
I have a copy of the original newpaper article and it stated about where on the lake it happened. So I went there today, and stood on the bank, and looked out over the lake, where the accident happened. The lake was so calm and it was so quiet standing there. It was very cold and there was a light breeze.  It was hard to imagine that under that water was the boat that my mom and grandparents were on so long ago. I tried to visualize what happened, but I couldn't. I tried to imagine the horror my mom felt seeing her parents drown, but I couldn't. I tried to imagine what was going through my grandparents' mind, knowing that their death was saving their children, but I couldn't.  All I could do was just stand there, and look out over the lake, so calm and quiet, and wonder.

"event","Well, concerning the drama from last year again. I am making one final step. and that is to come clean to anyone I have lied to. I know it may stir up some shit, but I need to do this. I was asked to lie to people under the context that they were treating someone I cared about, bad. I now find out that is not the case, and I feel it only right to apologize to these people. I just have to rememebr that it is not me causing the drama. It is the person who lied and asked me to lie who is the troublemaker. I am only bringing it to light. I too said bad things about people based on what I was told, and I apologize for that as well. I am planning on coming back to DP sometime in the near future and although people will think what they want about me, I will know I have done what I needed to make things as right as they can
 be.

So now I am done with it, it is behind me. Everyone that I cared about from then is back in my life in some form, and thats what really matters. i have talked to each of them and got things sorted out. As someone pointed out to me, ""Karma is a bitch, and the Karma train backed up and dealt some justice"".. Ohh to have been a fly on the wall....

"event","Well, a few things have changed recently. One being I am no longer with my Dom, but we are still great friends, and still play when we get a chance, and i think the world of Him.

The second thing is that I have reconnected with some people. I went through alot of drama last year, partly my fault.. i did make alot of mistakes. Most of it, however, was someone else's doing. It's a shame really, that someone would waste their life on deceiving others.
Life is a learning experience and I have learned alot in the last year.

I am a dominant man. I am just that. 
I am not dominant because of any 
superiority on my part. Not because I 
feel I am more intelligent, or wiser. 
I am not dominant because of the strength 
or mass of my body. I am not, nor would 
I want to be dominant with all women. 
Yet to you, I am Master. 

I am your Master only after earning your trust 
and I embrace your submissiveness. 
I have looked into your heart and mind and 
clearly see your desires and passions. 
You have thrown away your fears and 
inhibitions. You tell me of the needs of your 
heart and body. You have given me total 
access to your soul, and I accept the responsibility
and honor. 

You are a woman. You are not weak or 
inferior because of it. You are a treasure 
to be cherished. We are not equal. I have 
the strength of body and mind and the 
instinctive need to protect, possess, defend 
and provide for you. You are a woman 
and instinctively stronger of will and heart. 
Your belief in me gives me courage and 
direction. Your strength disperses my doubt. 
Your needs and desires encourage and give 
purpose to my efforts. 

We are not equal. We are halves of a whole. 
We compliment each other and make each 
other complete. My desire to dominate you 
is instinctive. It is not to degrade you nor is 
it degrading to you because you are secure 
in being totally feminine. We each recognize 
and accept our worth, and our need for 
someone to trust and fulfill our needs. 

You are sure, strong and proud in your 
womanhood. You do not submit as 
acceptance of inferiority, but from strength 
and passion. You expect a man to stand 
strong and be a man. You desire and 
flourish in the strength and control of a man. 
In return you present control of your body, 
unqualified trust and honesty, and the 
faithfulness of your heart. You submit because 
I have earned your trust. Because I have 
opened my heart and soul to you. Because I 
have listened to your words with my ears 
and heart and have learned to anticipate your 
needs and emotions. And because I have 
proven worthy in your eyes, you have given 
me the only true treasure of life; 
you have given me dominance over you. 

What you give is not abnormal, but pure, 
natural and the rarest gift a woman could 
give a man. You have given me complete 
and unshakable assurance of your 
commitment to me. Your submissiveness 
is a magnificent gift and sacred responsibility. 
I accept this from you with humility and joy. 
I understand the rarity and purity of this gift. 
I recognize it is your body and soul, your 
heart and mind. I dominate you only 
because you have allowed it. I dominate only 
because you have allowed me to and when 
I see your body kneel before me, in my 
mind and heart you are raised above 
all other woman, and all the treasures of 
the earth. What you give freely can not 
in reality be bought."

""I look forward confidently to the day when all who work for a living will be one with no thought to their separateness as Negroes, Jews, Italians or any other distinctions. This will be the day when we bring into full realization the American dream -- a dream yet unfulfilled. A dream of equality of opportunity, of privilege and property widely distributed; a dream of a land where men will not take necessities from the many to give luxuries to the few; a dream of a land where men will not argue that the color of a man's skin determines the content of his character; a dream of a nation where all our gifts and resources are held not for ourselves alone, but as instruments of service for the rest of humanity; the dream of a country where every man will respect the dignity and worth of the human personality."""

"event","Again, i was randomly reading profile's on collarme, and came across this..


The Dominant's Creed
  Above all else he cherishes his submissive, in the
 knowledge that the gift she gives him is the greatest of all.
 He is demanding and  takes full advantage of the power
 given to him, but knows how to share the pleasure that
 comes from that precious gift.
 
 He is in control of himself first and foremost, so that he
 may control others. As a stern and demanding Dominant,
 he can cause his sub to cry real tears.  As the consummate
 lover, he will then kiss the tears away, without ever
 stepping out of character.
 
 In times of trouble, a Dominant will leave the roles behind,
 to be a supportive friend and partner, never forgetting that
 this is still a loving relationship between two caring
 individuals. He is quick to understand the differences
 between fantasy and reality.  He would never ask a
 submissive to put him before her career, or family, just to
 satisfy his own pleasure.
 

 To win his submissive's mind, body and soul, he knows he
 must first win her trust. He will show his submissive
 humor, kindness, and warmth. He must also show her that
 his guidance and tutoring is knowledgeable and deserving
 of her attention, that this is a man she can learn from, and
 trust his direction.
 

 He is romantic enough to be protective and chivalrous. 
 When called upon, he will fight for his ladies' honor.  He
 proves to her that he is someone she can lean on, and
 depend on.
 

 He is old-fashioned enough to be a bit of a chauvinist, yet
 modern enough to respect his woman.  Quick to point out
 the differences between them, he also knows there is no
 inferiority in those differences.
 

 When it comes time to teach his submissive her lessons of
 obedience, he is a strong and unyielding professor. He will
 accept no flaw, nothing less than perfection from his
 student.  Never does he use discipline without good reason.
 When he does, it is always with a knowledgeable and
 careful hand.
 

 He is a careful guide, with safety always his main concern. 
 He knows how to use pain to extend the bounds of
 pleasure.  He is a mentor who can bring her to the edges of
 her envelope, and gently show her the inner courage to
 reach new heights.
 

 He is always open to communication and discussion,
 always ready to hear her wants and needs. He is patient,
 taking the time to learn her limits, and knowing that as her
 trust of him grows, so will they.
 

 He never has to demand ritual behavior by her. She
 responds to him out the want of pleasing him.  Compliance
 comes from the wanting to please, not the fear of
 punishment. He understands the fragile nature of mind and
 body, and never violates the trust given to him.
 

 He is secure enough to laugh at himself and the absurdities
 of life.  Courageous enough to accept assistance. Open
 minded enough to learn new things. Strong enough to
 grow. His tools are mind, body, spirit and soul with a little
 help from rope, paddle and blindfold. He understands that
 each partner gains most from pleasuring the other."

"event","I had a pretty hot scene on New Years Eve. I knew I would probably get to play, but I didn't think I would get into it as much as I did. I was uncomfortable at first, not knowing hardly anyone at the party. There were alot of people packed into the hotel room. I was standing, facing a door, with my hands restrained above me, and i had my shirt and bra off. It started off with a flogging, which was very nice. I was able to tune most of the noise out, and was getting into it. I was actually wanting more pain than i got.Everytime He hit me hard with the flogger i kept hoping He would do it again.. i was thinking ""more, more"". Even the stingy floggers, which I don't normally like, I wanted more of. Then came the knife play. I felt it on my back, it was very nice. But then, He came up close behind me, pulled my chin back with his hand, and started running the knife from my chest up to my throat. It was awesome.. the combination of feeling Him close behind me, feeling His breath in my ear, and holding my chin back... words can't describe it. I started feeling very lightheaded and extremely relaxed. All my muscles just loosened up. I think that was the first time that I really gave up all control mentally. I just let it happen. I trusted Him completely and was willing to go wherever He took me. 
I wished it would have lasted longer but we were short on time, it was almost midnight so we had to stop."

                               Understanding what Submissive means

                                         author unknown 



To understand the power of submission, one must first understand what being a submissive means, where it comes from and how it is expressed.

True submission is something that comes from deep within a person and is an essential part of their nature. It is something expressed from the soul and as such, it goes much deeper than the mere physical/sexual act of offering oneself to a Master for pleasure. A person can behave in a submissive manner but this is not the same as being ""a submissive"". 

To offer oneself completely and utterly to another, to surrender all choice and ""power"" requires an exceptional inner strength. High self esteem and a knowledge that in order to relinquish power to another as well as understanding that one must possess that inner power is essential.

Embracing and expressing my submissive nature has given me the most powerful opportunities to find the deepest levels of trust, power and the intimacy that can only arise from the bond of a Master and sub. It is the ultimate expression of balance, the archetypal opposition of yin (the receptive principal) and yang (the active principle). Both sides being perfectly equal, yet forming a perfect whole. 

As a submissive, my goals are to come before my Master as an empty chalice to be filled.....or a blank canvas to be painted....formless clay waiting to be molded. Thru this exchange, i know that i will become more than i was before....the Master takes the raw material, or the blank canvas or the raw gemstone and brings out the inner lustre. In this experience, what many misinterpret is that they assume the Master imposes his will upon the sub and she becomes whatever he wants her to be. i would disagree....to me, the Master brings out the qualities of submission in a more pronounced way. Rather than being told to ""act"" in a submissive way, it is the submissive's role to remove veil after veil until who she becomes is the perfect reflection of devoted service and in serving her Master, she finds an inner joy and balance that comes from knowing that with each veil removed, each boundary crossed, she becomes MORE of who she already is. 

When i feel, hear and see my Master's pride in me, i know that i am elevated and adored above all women. i have truly given the Gift of my soul to him and in that exchange he becomes as bound to me as i am to him. That is the beauty of submission to me. There is a dynamic that exists where the more my Master asks of me, the more i am able to give, and then the deeper our bond becomes. It grows exponentially. The perfect yin/yang of the Master being the active principle in the TAKING and the submissive being the receptive in the GIVING.
My submission is expressed in many ways: on a physical, mental, emotional and spiritual level. Without all of these levels, again, it becomes merely a physical act. There is a sacredness to submission as well for me. Like prayer or other acts of devotion, it is living my life with an intention and focus that always strives for the highest, purest expression. Putting the relationship first...always searching within for ways to please and offer more of myself than i think i can. It is this going beyond and pushing limits that becomes the most important reward of submission for me...the place of empowerment and self knowledge and the resulting inner strength/transformation. It is also dancing with the inner Shadowself...the parts of me that are about fear and being taken on the journey by someone (the Master) who will be there to catch you so you never really fall. The most special part of submission for me is level of intimacy and soul connection with another. Each veil that is removed, each boundary crossed, each lash accepted and begged for, each time of being taken to the outermost regions of letting go of control.....all of this is the glue that binds the Master and sub completely to one another. To become completely naked and vulnerable on every level, then give more than i think i can and see the pride, love and devotion in my Master's eyes is the greatest Gift imaginable."

"event","Here's what happened. We all went to this underground club. It was me and David, A Dom/switch couple and another guy.( I am leaving names out for privacy reasons) We sat around for a while and drank and talked. David said he would be back, and I was buzzed by then, so I don't know actually how long he was gone. Then the fem switch comes up to me with cuffs and a chain in her hand, and says "" I have been directed to do this"".. i am pretty shocked, forgot exactly what i said but I put my wrists out. She puts the cuffs on my wrists and then connects them with a chain. I look at the other Dom and he is standing behind her with a straight face. I have no idea what is going on or what is gonna happen. My mind is just going 100mph. So then she pulls on the chain and says ""Come with me"".. So here I am being led away by her, and I look around and the few people that were didn't seem to notice too much. I am led up a set of stairs to this room. There He stood, and I am sure i was smiling from ear to ear. I look around and see that He has his floggers out. He was standng there, with a slight smile on His face, looking so damn sexy. I knew now what was going on. He knew that I had been wanting to scene for a while, but it just never seemed to happen, and no fault of His. He had gone out of his way to set this up for me. At that moment i just wanted to wrap my arms around Him and hug Him, but I maintained..lol..besides I couldn't have anyway because i was cuffed and chained. I won't go in to exactly what happened but it was awesome. I needed that. Everytime I think about it, it brings a smile to my face. 
Thankyou David, for making me feel very special.


I had to deal with a bit of drama when I got home that night. Not what I wanted to deal with after such an awesome evening, but that's life I guess.. take the good with the bad.

Introspective and reflective, you think about everything and anything.
You are a soft-hearted daydreamer. You long for your ideal life.
You love silence and solitude. Everyday life is usually too chaotic for you.

Given enough time alone, it's easy for you to find inner peace.
You tend to be spiritual, having found your own meaning of life.
Wise and patient, you can help people through difficult times.

At your worst, you brood and sulk. Your negative thoughts can trap you.
You are reserved and withdrawn. This makes it hard to connect to others.
You tend to over think small things, making decisions difficult.</font></td></tr></table><div align=""center""><a href=""http://www.blogthings.com/whattempermentareyouquiz/"">What Temperment Are You?</a></div>"

so i'm like ""cool"", now i can get a 100 on my final and bring my final grade up to an A.. so she gives us the 33 questions, i go home, write the questions and answers on note cards and memorize every single one.. i go to class early and meet a few other students and we study together.. i think there is no way i'm not going to make a 100. 
so the time comes, we get the tests and i am writing like crazy, i know all of the answers.. but then there are 3 questions on there that she did not give us.. so i say something.. she admits that she did not give us these questions and kinda has his ""tough luck"" attitude.. so i sit there racking my brain trying to figure out the answers.. and i am getting madder and madder.. finally i give up and turn it in.. the to top it off on the way home one of the other students call me to let me know she knew the answers to them.. which just made it worse.. b/c my only hope was that no one would know the answers so she would cut us some slack, but not now.. and this girl works for DOC so of course she's gonna know the answers. 
i will still probably get and A, and end up with a B in the class, but i'm not happy. its the principal of it.. tell me what to fucking study. i am not a mind reader, and my college education is not a joke. and i don't enjoy being tricked or lied to.."

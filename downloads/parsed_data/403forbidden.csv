"event","we (the fam) went to Bar Italia last night.  they had the trout again!  i had been craving it... a whole trout (sans head), lightly-breaded and perfectly pan-seared, accompanied by lemons, warm barley salad, and some carrots and asparagus.  the fish was delicious, but the barley salad was completely devoid of flavour, even with the addition of lemon and salt.  and i think last time, they served the barley inside the fish, which was a nice effect.

little bro brought leftover baked goods from his tea party, so after dinner, we acquired milk from the Cartel and sat out front eating Ina Garten's <a href=""http://www.foodnetwork.com/food/recipes/recipe/0,,FOOD_9936_32314,00.html?rsrc=search"" target=""_new"">outrageous brownies</a>.

when we got back into the car, b made me take a bite of one of the lemon bars.  of course, he had a bite, too.  when i dropped him off, he left me with more brownies, two lemon bars (less two bites), a currant scone, and some shortbread cookies.

i bought some milk on my way home.  smart move.

about 5 minutes after arriving home, i ate the rest of that lemon bar with a glass of milk.  about an hour later, i made (frozen) waffle fries with shallot salt and malt vinegar.  and about an hour after that, i had peanut butter on white bread.  speaking of white bread, the only reason i bought it was for grilled cheese, like the one i had for ""breakfast"" yesterday.  i think i had 4 mini chocolate cupcakes and milk for ""lunch,"" and a red bartlett pear to tide me over until dinner.

pms, anyone?"

we had a brief discussion in which i basically told him he's cool and he expressed annoyance at the catchword and title of my class, on the grounds that it's too neutral, too passive.  i didn't know it at the time, but he also slipped in one of his schticks about efficiency, that it ""essentially means playing a piano with a two-by-four.&#8221;

enter my prejudice problem.  this guy is really smart and working on some important ideas on an entirely new level.  but here i sit assuming, even after a relatively normal exchange with him, that he's some kind of &#252;ber hippy tree-hugger who wouldn't deign to sit down and have a real conversation with me, a troglodyte engineer who takes a class called ""sustainability,"" eats meat and dairy, drives an ""efficient"" car, and lives in a regular old stand-alone, energy-consumptive house.

it just shows to go me that however comfortable and happy i think i am with myself, there's still a small self-loathing part of me.  bah.

PADERBORN, GERMANY - Overzealous zookeeper Friedrich Riesfeldt fed his constipated elephant Stefan 22 doses of animal laxative and more than a bushel of berries, figs and prunes before the plugged-up pachyderm finally let fly-and suffocated the keeper under 200 pounds of poop. Investigators say ill-fated Friedrich, 46, was attempting to give the ailing elephant an olive-oil enema when the relieved beast unloaded on him like a dump truck full of mud. 

""The sheer force of the elephant's unexpected defecation knocked Mr. Riesfeldt to the ground, where he struck his head on a rock and lay unconscious as the elephant continued to evacuate his bowels on top of him,"" said flabbergasted Paderborn police detective Erik Dern. ""With no one there to help him, he lay under all that dung for at least an hour before a watchman came along, and during that time he suffocated. It seems to be just one of those freak accidents that happen sometimes -- a billion-to-one shot, at least."" 

The heartbreaking tale of constipation and tragedy began April 23 when the conscientious zookeeper noticed that his prize, 8,000-pound African elephant didn't seem to be producing his usual poop aplenty. ""Friedrich had actually been concerned for several days because he knew that severe constipation can kill an elephant,"" assistant zookeeper Kurt Herrman recalled. ""He told me he was going to stay late that Thursday night to treat Stefan with laxatives and possibly give him an enema. I offered to help, but he sent me on home, saying he had everything under control."" 

Two hours later, horrified night watchman Walter Pleuger found Friedrich lying lifeless under a mound of muck, his body visible only from the knees down. ""I had never really thought about it before,"" Det. Dern said. ""But obviously, giving an elephant an enema can be a very dangerous activity and not something that should be attempted alone."" </lj-cut>"

now i'm feeling odd from the fioricet i had to take this morning and probably the trazodone as well.  yes, yes, these things are toxic, but they aren't my problem.

my problem is bacon, cheese, french fries, et al.  there is nothing intrinsically wrong with any of these foods, except when they are used inappropriately (just like any other drug)."

so, they are offering this new, smaller cable box.  all that is required is to bring your old box in and exchange it.  so, that's what i did - on monday.  of course, i didn't hook it up until thursday when i actually had the time.  well, when i got it going, the ""on demand"" feature and hence the ""skinemax whenever i feel like it"" wasn't working.  then last night, when i was right at the end of <em> Me and You and Everyone We Know</em> (i think it was the end; i still haven't seen it), the channel decided to cease to be authorised, as did all the other channels.  i've called the cable company four times now and the third time i thought it was taken care of.  well, this last guy said they can't do what they need to do over the phone and finally explained that this is their new policy and someone has to come out to my house to verify the serial number on the box - on monday.

why couldn't the lazy-ass women at the office down the street have taken care of whatever necessary authorisation or registration when i exchanged the boxes?  did i just answer my own question?"

i was really looking forward to going out to the farm with alice, but she's upset about the way her mother treats (disregards) the horses.  she doesn't want to be face-to-face with it, since it might push her over the edge in her fragile state.  i really hope she starts to get stronger soon.  living in that raw emotional state is no fun at all.

"event","<strong>geek</strong>
&#8211;noun
1.	a peculiar or otherwise dislikable person, esp. one who is perceived to be overly intellectual.
2.	a computer expert or enthusiast (a term of pride as self-reference, but often considered offensive when used by outsiders.)
3.	a carnival performer who performs sensationally morbid or disgusting acts, as biting off the head of a live chicken.

<strong>nerd</strong>  
&#8211;noun
1.	a stupid, irritating, ineffectual, or unattractive person.
2.	an intelligent but single-minded person obsessed with a nonsocial hobby or pursuit: a computer nerd.

<strong>dork</strong>
&#8211;noun
1.	a stupid or ridiculous person; jerk; nerd.

<lj-cut text=""i'll be the first to admit..."">i'll be the first to admit that i'm a total geek (nerd, dork...?).  but sometimes something inside me resists and i find myself denouncing certain aspects of geekdom.  where is my geek pride?

one of my most common victims is D&D.  i know logically that there's nothing wrong with RPG's.  i've even been known to play MORPG's (uh... SecondLife?).  i'm often embarrassed (nay, ashamed?) to admit that i participate in this kind of activity and i've actually called someone a ""geek"" (with disdain) for copping to paying WoW.   is there some line in the sand here?

the main people in my life are not at all geeky, which makes my activities seem odd, leaving me feeling alienated.  it's not that my friends and family are cool, necessarily, but they're not geeks.  for instance, i have one friend who didn't have an email address until about a year ago.  now, a savvy person might point out that i'm in engineering school, which directly suggests that i'm surrounded by geeks. 

i spend most of my weekday time with engineering geeks.  but i haven't gotten close to them, really, and i don't know why.  every once in a while, i step back and notice myself and my behaviour when i'm studying (hanging out) in the ""attic"" with my cohorts  (fellow geeks).  it's like a fix - my geek fix.  if i feel so comfortable with these people, why don't i spend more time with them?  

well, geeks do uncool things like play D&D and go to ""conventions.""  i make fun of ""conventions.""  of course, i've never actually attended one.  all i know is what i see on the SciFi network and the Discovery Channel.  oh, and what i hear from the discerning ""cool"" people.  

why this constant nagging to be ""cool?""  i've convinced myself over the years that there are such things as ""cool nerds,"" of which i am one.  oxymoron schmoxymoron.  i don't think you have to be a complete bumbling, drooling, pasty wuss to be a geek.  certainly, the geeks i spend my time with are somewhat ""cool,"" aren't they?

i was just thinking; if i went to a ""convention,"" would i be the coolest person there?  in all modesty, whenever i've been to such events (FLOG, for instance), this has been the case.  but you know what?  being ""cool"" at geeky events is about the most isolating state, even more so than being geeky at cool events because when the geeks are together, they have so much more fun than the cool people do any day.

one note of caution, though: geek conventions and activities are highly addictive.  i can say from experience that non-social and virtually-social geektivities can be difficult to keep in balance with daily life.

i think it's time i made some real geek friends.  <font size=""1"">but, what if they don't like me?  </font></lj-cut>"

diane and nicole were telling me that in april, they're doing an office-wide detox and they gave me a form to fill out if i'd like to participate.  i think it would be a good idea, but it would cost a few hundred dollars, which i do not currently have.  i've never been able to do a real detox - the headache at the end of the first day always gets me.  this one is supposed to last 13 days!  but diane said that she feels good, now that the first few days are over.  perhaps if i could interest my mom, she'd pay for it...

my structural design exam last night was painful.  i felt cramped because we didn't have enough room to spread out all our books and papers and things.  the exam was not that long, except that i have trouble reading his questions - during an exam, i do not want to read an entire page of all-caps text.  i should have scanned through and underlined the important words.  so what ended up happening is i had to go back and correct myself after realising that i did the wrong reactions.  

then he gave us some ambiguous information for the tension/compression analysis of the column, and i had to sit there and reason out which K to use for which one.  then i thought, ""oh crap, i guess i have to check for elastic and inelastic buckling on both axes!,"" since K<sub>y</sub> is unnecessary for yielding and fracture in tension. but i still don't know if that's right and i decided to be safe rather than sorry.  

i ended up with less than 30 minutes for the last  part, for which my brain got caught on finding the moment on the beam.  so freakin simple.  then my brain couldn't decide what nominal moment and shear capacities are, thanks to prof using different terminology than the ""steel bible.""  of course, i used all kinds of messy square root equations for L<sub>b</sub> > L<sub>r</sub>, only to find out that igor used a lovely shortcut, which may or may not have been right.

i was mentally and physically sore after that.

of course, the boys wanted to discuss it whilst standing in the parking lot and after a few minutes, i felt compelled to yell, ""break it up and go home!"""

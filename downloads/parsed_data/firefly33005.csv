i had little hw today which is happy, just calc, english draft, and russian.  but if i don't do the russian it doesn't matter.  i love that course.

today i went on a walk around my neighborhood barefoot and it was really fun, i ought to do it more often.

oh, by the way, i have decided to start making the majority of my posts ""friends only"" so if you read this and aren't my friend yet, speak up."

"event","holy goodness the DA musical was AMAZING.  i was blown away.  lizzy's voice was sooo beautiful and scott was so amazing.  the two almost made me cry.  and pat as a frog brought me great amusement.  beth was good and so was erin and of course drew.  joe was amazing.  he did such a great job as a cat and has a pretty awesome voice.  gahhh i can't decide who was the best.....everyone was so good!  lizzy, joe, or scott, maybe drew?  i dunno.  and everyone else was good too.  i was impressed by DeeDee as she's a freshman.  alex and the other ducklings were also good.  and i'm amazed at will ramsey's ability to come on stage dressed like that and not crack a smile or appear to feel awkward.  that musical will probably be the highlight of my weekend.  it's the highlight so far at any rate.
after the play i had a lot on my mind for some reason and was thinking a lot.  and when i think i pace.  and i walk fast when i pace.  so i basically paced around my room from 10:00-12:00 straight so i'm very proud of myself because that's a lot of excersize.  yay for me, finally doing something semi-productive.  although i wish my thoughts had some reality to them that would be swell.
babysitting tonight from 6 till 10 which means we'll probably play tag for two hours.  joy.  i hope it goes better babysitting these kids this time than it did last time.
a fair amount of hw left, i better start that.  byebye"

"event","Science Olympiad was completely awesome.  i had soooo much fun.  so first was mission possible.  we had one touch (which is a deduction) for the first time in like 10 runs, but it was OK because we got first place!!!  then for forensics, tyler wasn't there so erin subbed for him.  it was fun working with erin, and we selected the right person for committing the crime but got confused about who he was (we thought he was vicky's father rather than vicky's brothers soccer coach) and were off on our reasoning because of that.  and then remote sensing was supposed to be about mars but it ended up being about sea coasts and cameras, just like alex predicted.  we didn't know what half the questions were asking and had to look up like every other word.  we also made up a lot of answers and when they called five minutes left, we had barely started the second page and were just like ""umm...a latitude and longitude...how about 123 and 44"".  our favorite answer was when they asked explain what caused the water near the shore in this particular photo to be dark blue other than the fact it was deeper.  so we said that it was becuase of bacteria feeding off of the rich minerals from the lava.  we laughed during the entire thing, it was great.  we ended up getting 2nd, which we thought was halarious too.  actually, the majority of the events we didn't study for we got in the top three. the scrambler was built a week ago and it got first.  no one studied dynamic planet and we got 2nd.  our robot and our bottle rocket placed for the first time ever, but that was only because they offered 1st through 8th place.  we got third in regionals as a team, and are going to the state tournament on april 8th!!!  i also saw katie's friend jeremy there, which was fun, and got to say hi to the duke schoolers.

my grandma flew in with my aunt on saturday because she's been really sick.  she was going to be living with us indefinately and starting dialisis at duke, but then she decided she wasn't ready to start dialisis and flew back with my aunt yesterday.  it's completely rediculous how none of them can make a decision.  now my mom's convinced we'll never see grandma again.  i don't know what to think.

i'm still sick and it's really bugging me.  i need to get better.  i have a ton of hw, so i better return to that, byebye"

strategic planning was awesome.  i still need to find out what happened though, stupid SAT for making me miss the last session.  i met this guy who owns an international, multi-million dollar company for jerseys.  kinda exciting.  and i got to see sam, who is one of the coolest people ever.

"event","in english we are studying emily dickinson.  it actually isn't that horrible.  i like her a bit, but it gets sorta dull after a bit, considering we don't ever talk about the poems.  in small doses though its fun.  here are my two favorites thus far (as they are completely random):

I'm nobody! Who are you?
Are you nobody, too?
Then there's a pair of us--don't tell!
They'd banish us, you know.

How dreary to be somebody!
How public, like a frog
To tell your name the livelong day
To an admiring bog!

i like the first four lines better than the second stanza.  ok here's the second one:

Apparently with no surprise
To any happy Flower
The Frost beheads it as its play
In accidental power

yayyyy random.  well, not much else to say.  this week is going very slowly.

i really really like the song Virtigo by Jump, Little Children.  a lot."

my dad just got back from minnessota.  he got a job option there.  i told him that if he takes the job, i absolutely refuse to visit him during breaks, he'll have to come to college to visit me.  i really hope he doesn't take the job.  minnesotta's so cold and it'll kill my rainod (sp?) inflicted fingers beligerently (hehe SAT vocab)

the SAT course is very dull (hehe...ponderous).  actually, that's a bit of an understatement.  except for kt and david in the course.  and the really adorable dog puppy thing.  it was so cute!  and hyperactive.  i hope this course gets me into a good college because i'll be sad otherwise.

kensey's flinstone analogy also made me happy :)

i was just looking at the stanford course catalogue.  holy goodness.  i only looked at the african-american studies, environmental science, and political science.  all the topics i thought were interesting in the first were in the polysci.  holy goodness polysci has the most amazing courses!!!!!  i want to take them NOW.  there's ngo's and social groups in developing/third-world countries, the history of nuclear weapons, chinese politics, history of modern conflicts, reestablishment studies in post-war areas, public opinion and US policy, the studies of literature and public opinion, documentaries on human rights issues and humanitarian issues, the history of democracy, early political philosophy, modern political philosophy, and soooooooooooooooo much more!  i wanted to take them ALL.  i want to be in college....why can't i be there so i can take those now?
speaking of college, erin and camey find out about duke soon.... :) i hope they get in, i'm sure they will

i'm exhausted and off to bed. too much studying this weekend
i'm excited about college though.  next i'll finish stanford's courses, see duke's courses, then see others too.  i'm excited already."

i'm so jealous of seniors.  all they do is talk about ahhh i want to get into college so i won't have to work any more....or at least the ones at my school do.  and then other seniors discuss desires to go backpacking :)  both choices sound fantabulous

we had free donuts and hot chocolate today.  i had a donut.  they are so yummy....we'd tried them in exec on tuesday to make sure they were safe to sell, and i had three because they were really quite good.  i love donuts and food that's bad for you.  i also love my ipod because it works now.  and i like emails because they have brought happy things recently.  me and david have decided that kensey, lily, and victoria must come up here during winter break (hint hint if you read this).  we've also discovered that we might be in the same SAT prep class...yippie.  not for the SAT, but for having friends in SAT prep class to break the boredom.  alright off to read or something like that"

i'm upset because my parents won't let me visit east to see if i'd like to go there next year.  they won't hear of me switching schools.

one last thing that made my life was this quote from my madrichim (that's hebrew for teacher's assistants) handbook that they gave us to aide us in being assistant teachers for sunday school (it was on pg 50 of the Madrikhim Handbook by rabbi samuel joseph, just so i'm not accused of improper citation):
""Every time you enter a classroom you will be working with a group of children, each of whom is very uniqy (and if it is a Jewish school, all of whom are above average""

kensey, i'll give it to you, that bob dylan movie was very good.

""It's a liver!

and today me and maddy and margaret and patrick hung out and saw Corpse Bride which was beyond amazing and i want to see it again!  and when we weren't doing that we were in the apple store playing with webcams and admiring the nano ipods.  i think they should pay us for playing with the webcams because we were like demonstrating and getting people interested.  ok, so we scared them away, but you could tell they were interested and would probably come back later.  if they have a sale jump in those, they should give us some percent of the revenue, lol.  yay for the fun conversations on the ichat there.  at eight maddy, you know where. lol.

I'd like to see you out one night
Dressed up like a rock-n-roll star
Straight out of some strange magazine
Then I know I'd love you
But if I see you out somewhere
You might think THAT I don't care
'Cause I love my guitar
I love my guitar
I'd like to see you out one night
Dressed up like a race car driver
You'd push the engine all the way
Then I know I'd love you
But if I see you out somewhere
You might think that I don't care


See the couple, coffee shop
Beatniks beating out beebop
Rainy day, skies are grey
But the couple feeling gay
Boy is laughing at her joke
Girl, embarrassed, takes a smoke
She should quit, yes she knows
But she's happy as she blows
Down the cafe, through the bar
Pass the hippies and the jars
Of the bean that they drink
Everyday, every week
They should quit, coffee's bad
Makes you crazy, fucking mad
But they say in defense:
(With a pause for suspense)
""It's the stuff of the gods
Sexy smart hot rods!
Roller coaster! Hurricanes!
Super-sonic jet planes!""
They should quit, yes they know
But where the hell would they go?
They're like me, in a bind...
Don't you see?
Love ain't blind


She likes the photograph
The one of you and Simone
Out in the rain on a Sunday morning
She likes to take it out
Only when she's feeling down
And then she says ""Can you hear it raining?""
She wants to know does everyone feel this way
When it rains in the summertime
She wants to know does everyone feel this way
When you're sure that he's gone forever
When it rains in Asia
It makes her feel this way
California
London, Bombay
When it rains In Asia

too tired right now.  got to talk to maddy today which was happy and she showed me this site with hands that people had really painted and they were amazing.  they had like painted a cheeta and an eagle and stuff on their hands.  it was really cool.  can't remember url though, accidently closed the conversation.

i watched lilo and stitch with the kids.  i'd never seen it before, it was really cute.  then we played on the swing-set and mason decided to be George of the Jungle on his one-string swing thing.  it was cute.  and he's like a rabbit...his dinner was a quarter of a bag of baby carrots...no joke.  and then we started watching Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, and then Emma fell asleep at 10:00 on the coach (coach...couch??? spelling???) and so me and mason played candyland until his parents came home.  twas so fun!  i love them.

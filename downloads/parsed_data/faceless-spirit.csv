~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This spring ""break"" was way too short. It's already Tuesday. School tomorrow v__v.

Me and Ian have found a hobby. We went to Nomohegan park a few times this weekend. Sunday night we collected 290 of those disks from the field by the skeet shooting range. We washed them and stakced them in a box. Last night we went back in the rain and collected 52 more. We're planning on making something out of them. We're not sure exactly what yet. Most likely a castle or something. 

Got some really nice photos while at the parks this weekend. Pictures? yes.

"event","I've decided to right an entry similar to <a href=""www.livejournal.com/users/tonihime"">Tonihime's</a> and write a brief summary of my year. Just for the hell of it. Because I'm bored.

2003 basically started off as shit. The New Year's party at Keith and Kristi's was terrible and the next day started off with being in trouble with mother. I spent most of my time in Linden with Jeannette, Eric, Pancake, Sean, Potato and others. Soon, I stopped being with them as often and there was a short period of time that I spent with a certain asshole football player from school. Until I met Ian. We talked for a while until he finally asked me to be his girlfriend in March. I promised him I would stop smoking and doing drugs. I did for the most part. There were times here and there when I would have a cigarette. There were even problems with my drug use.

Summer ended and another year at ALJ started. Being a junior turned out to be a lot easier than I thought it would be. Harassment from the football players had stopped because I generally got out of the 'goth' thing when I stopped hanging out in Linden. There are still some times when I dress a <b>little</b> 'out there' but I just wear what I am comfortable in. My grades are much better than last year and there are less major fights with people at school. I've grown apart from some friends[Toni, Jackie, Nikki, and others] but still talk to the ones I see the most[Danny, Jeannette, Meg, Christina, Amanda] and they help me through everything I need help with. I don't know what I would do without them.

New Year's was much less hectic and a lot more enjoyable this year. No drugs, drinking or annoying the neighbors. Just me, Ian and the tv. Being sober and spending the night laying next to the person I love is <b>much</b> better than being high and spending the night laughing at other people passing out and trying to think of an excuse to tell my mother so I wouldn't get in trouble. 

Hopefully 2004 will be as good as most of 2003 was. I know as long as I still have my friends, my health and love, it will be. 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Happy New Year everyone!!"

Don took the blame for it [thanks a lot] but later Qualshie found out <i>I</i> was the one who made them and I got harped on for it. Only for the fact that there was a picture of the female reproduction system on it. She said it wasn't appropiate. Come on. We learned about that shit in middle school. I think high school students are mature enough to not be offended by it. And everyone agrees with me. My grandmother flipped out. As soon as she came into the house...'stop embarassing me in front of my co-workers! I'm sick of you getting into trouble!'. Excuse me, but I did <i>not</i> get in any sort of trouble. I was warned. 

So for now, no flyers in the school. But I think enough people saw them and there will be more kids attending the shows.

We were all the way up front up until 40 Below Summer. During 40BS, I kept getting smashed against the guardrail and [just my luck] all the crowdsurfers came my way. So the Peacekeeping kept standing in front of me and I had to keept ducking down so I didn't get hit. At one point, my arm got caught between some girls legs and my arm was bent backwarks over the guardrail. I started crying but stopped right away. I was fine. I kept getting kicked in the head a lot and I couldn't breath or anything so the Peacekeeper pulled me over the rail so I could get out. My knees are all black and blue from hitting the rail and my arm, back and knees hurt bad [especially my left knee]. But the first half of their set was awesome. I'm really glad I skipped the pits and stayed in the front. 

Me and Ian stood in the front on the second floor for Ill Nino. They were fucking awesome. Again, it was the first time I actually <b>watched</b> them. Their new cd comes out in 4 days. I'll have to get that a long with the new 40BS.

"event","ON TAX CUTS:
George Bush: ""The tax relief is for everyone who pays income taxes...Americans will keep, this year, an average of almost $1,000 more of their own money.""
The Truth: Nearly half of all taxpayers get less than $100. And 31% of all taxpayers get nothing at all. 

ON JOBS:
George Bush: ""Our first goal is...an economy that grows fast enough to employ every man and woman who seeks a job.""
The Truth: Bush is the first President since Hoover to preside over an economy that has lost jobs, not created them - more than 2.9 million since 2001. 

ON THE ENVIRONMENT:
George Bush: ""[My] Clear Skies legislation...mandates a 70% cut in air pollution from power plants over the next 15 years.""
The Truth: The Bush plan will allow more than 100,000 additional premature deaths by 2020 than alternative legislation developed by the Environmental Protection Agency. The plan does not regulate carbon emissions and allows far more sulfur and mercury emissions. 

ON EDUCATION:
George Bush: ""[W]e achieved historic education reform - which must now be carried out in every school and in every classroom.""
The Truth: Bush cut $8 billion from the promised funds for education."

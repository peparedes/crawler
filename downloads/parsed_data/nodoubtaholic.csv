Yeah - I never got any of that shit back.
I forgot to mention my story about meeting Gwen.  But that's another post.  
I'm posting this one because I need to vent about something.  I've been happily floating along with Joe now for almost 2 years.  Patrick has been nearly nonexistant in my brain for the last year, for the first time since I've known him.  He really tried to reconcile things, but I'm not going to drop everything just because he finally decided to make an effort.  Anyway, this is also not my original intention to post.
Joe and I.  Everything's been fine, in fact it's been really good for awhile now.  Recently though, I've been kind of developing a crush on someone that I play WoW with.  And I feel horribly excited and guilty at the same time.  I know there's nothing for me to feel guilty about, seeing as it's just some junk feelings I'm carrying around with me.  But I can't shake them.  And they seem to be growing out of my control.  If Joe were to find out the things running through my head lately, he would be devestated.  But the fact is, I don't connect with Joe in a certain way I've been craving lately.  So, I naturally found someone else to do the job.  I don't think he knows I have a crush on him, and if he does, well I don't know.  I'm not even sure how he feels about me.  Ok before I get ahead of myself, I want to examine this here.  Set aside all the guilt and everything associated with the situation at this moment and just talk about how I feel.
Why am I attracted to him?  He's smart, he's hilarious, he gets my more intellectual side and appreciates it.  He's a grammar freak.  He has leadership qualities (which basically translates into power - which has obviously always been a turn on for me).  I know he's going to be successful in life because of the way he carries himself and makes decisions.  He's considerably younger than me, which is also somewhat exciting for some reason.  He's still very... virginal.  And I find that attractive as well.  He pretends to be all put together, but is actually very vulnerable and chooses to share it with only a select few.  
Playing WoW puts me, as a girl, in contact with a LOT of guys.  Out of an entire guild (let's say 100 people) there are usually only about 3-4 girls.  WoW is a video game.  Video games = nerds in general.  So, nerdy girl starved guys + a small fraction of actual girls = Flirt Fest.  Yes, I do indulge in some flirtation, even with Joe around.  He doesn't seem to mind, because my flirting is generally largely based upon insults.  Some guys get a little overboard and have a hard time recognizing boundaries with the girls they play with.  This guy I've developed a crush on, regardless of his feelings (unless I'm misreading the situation which is entirely possible), does not go over the top like everyone else does.  He respects my relationship and doesn't put me in awkward positions.  This, is attractive to me.  If he does in fact have a crush on me, then he has been very good at not putting me in harm's way with Joe about it.  I don't know how he could NOT know of my feelings at this point.  I'm having trouble not just blurting it out.  It's a (very) guilty pleasure.  I just don't want it to overtake my feelings for Joe.  Joe and I have a great relationship, though it is lackluster in the passion department as of late.  I'm just not feeling any excitement.  We're in a comfort zone.  Which is fine, I'm just not in the mood for it.  I'm concerned about his age and mine and the effect it could have in the near future on the ideas of commitment and things of that nature.  I'm not sure I want some gigantic commitment.  I want to be monogamous, but I feel like I've had many many opportunities in the last few months that I've turned away, because I'm with Joe.  Which is good, I just am getting that second thought thing.. doubting my decisions.. wondering wether or not I've made the right ones.  Do I want comfort and longevity?  Or do I want passion and excitement?  Can I have both somehow?  Is that even possible in my current situation?  
I dunno.
Funny thing is - he's from PA too.  Wtf."

So.
This has been one of the most stressful weeks I've had in a very very long time.  I still can't believe some of the stuff that's been happening.  I was living with my dad last year.  Von moved out, and I eventually moved out.  I couldn't handle living with my dad alone, he's disgusting and I didn't want to be his mommy,  running around cleaning up after him and telling him how to dress.  That's what he needs.  But I need a dad.  Anyway, we kind of lost touch and didn't communicate much for the last 6 months or so.  I was going through a lot with issues with that house we were living in and the upkeep of it.  My dad didn't do anything and generally would walk around in his underwear all the time.  I have a dog and I'm not always there to take care of him.  I was relying on him to help me with that.  Unfortunately as the summer got warmer, he developed a flea problem.  No big deal, give him a bath.  The situation would begin to get out of hand again when I would leave the house, either to go to work or friend's houses, or Joe's.  It got to the point where I could not sit in my own room without a flea jumping on me.  I was having nightmares about bugs.  I fogged the house, I bathed my dog literally every day.  My dad did not even NOTICE this problem we were having.  To make the story short, I moved out a few months later.  In my mind, that was the final straw.  
So now I'm living with Cara.  Ladeedadeedoo.  Time flies by, I have left a lot of important things still at my dad's house.  about 3/4 of my LAMB stuff, other random collectible type things that I don't actually need to function, but mean a LOT to me.  I keep intending to go pick them up, but the idea of dealing with my dad continues to stop me.  Eventually I know something is wrong because I keep hearing through my brother he's having trouble paying for things, and he wants to move.  Oh well, he'll let me know when I need to get my stuff.  Last weekend, a box of random stuff from the house was dropped off at Joe's house.  He calls me and asks me what's going on, and I have no idea.  Joe is actually related to the landlady of the house, but just barely.  So he calls around trying to find why a box of my stuff got put in his driveway.  Evidently that was the last of the stuff from the house and the rest had all been sent to who knows where.  Goodwill, friends, family.  MY LAMB STUFF WAS PUT IN GOODWILL.  My throat proceeds to close up, and my stomach rises up to my eyeballs.  I am immediately hysterical.  I have spent so much time and effort collecting some of these things that have just been taken to the DUMP so to speak, all because my dad is an asshole who got evicted and neglected to let his family know.  My camera is gone, my posters are gone, most of my LAMB collection is gone, including my first season shirts I was so so proud of.  Including the outfit I wore to meet Gwen, all the stuff that means a whole hell of a lot to me.  This seems incredibly petty to an outsider.  To me, it was nearly the end of the world.  
So, Joe and I went to Goodwill to see if we could track anything down.  They would not let us look through their backroom.  So I had to leave them with descriiptions of things in hopes they would find them.  Somehow, I don't think I'm getting any of it back. 
It makes me sick.
I came very close to literally being sick that day.
Then tonight, I check my myspace and find a message from Patrick.  He is apparantly intending to come out here and surprise/bombard me.  And I'm really really really having mixed feelings about it.  I'm not at all sure of how I would react to seeing him right now.  And things are going really well with Joe and I don't want to fuck that up.  I don't know how Joe would handle it if that actually happened."

i should be in bed right now.
this christmas was so disappointing.  i hid from christmas this year.  i slept all day.  didn't want to do anything.  i was supposed to go up north to visit the parts of my family who do give a crap about christmas, but the weather decided otherwise.  it sucked, but at the same time.. i didn't want to go because i didn't want to be asked the same question again and not have an answer.  yes i'm still in my gay job, yes i still haven't done anything about furthering my life.  oh well.  deal with it.  fuck off.
meanwhile, my brother is in gay land.  my dad is offiically off his rocker, and my mom is... well my mom.  i feel like i can't have any kind of normality in my life because my family is so screwed up.  i barely talk to any of them.  my dad drives me nuts, my mom drives me nuts, and now.. it makes me really really upset to even consider, but my own brother drives me nuts.  everytime i talk to him, he immediately launches into his latest drama, or whatever is going on with him.  no one ever stops and asks about how i'm doing.  probably because i shove everyone off as soon as they go there.  but then again, no one offers their help either.  it's like, what the fuck do i have to do to get someone to get inolved with what's going on with ME?  if i ever want to do anything with any of them, it's like it has to be on their terms.. or it doesn't happen.  i'm just frustrated i suppose.
and my brother.  i dunno.  it's really depressing at the moment.  he and i were so close.  he's replaced me at this point.  and i have trouble keeping up with him and his web of.. lies.  usually i have to run around after him sweeping his messes up and making sure he's not exposing himself.  and i'm sick of it.  i can't ever hang out with JUST him.  he always has to be with someone else.  i'm missing that connection.  i need a connection.
joe is great, but the connection just isn't quite there.  i don't know if that will ever change.  but i can't talk with him on quite the same level.  
blah."

so everything went fine last week.  i got to PA alright, i destressed once i was there.  though it took me about a day.  i felt kind of bad because i was feeling UBER bitchy when i got there..  i was still feeling the stress from the previous 24 hours, and he had his friend with him.  i don't think i was being very friendly.  but i was in a bad mood and didnt want to deal with anyone.  i was holding some emotions in that i didnt' feel like sharing with random people.  i was really depressed while i was there too because of what had happened with my dad.  and money issues.  he was being all weird because he was really broke, and i was having to pay for things.  he felt really bad about it.  i totally didn't care, but it was bothering me that he kept bringing up that he felt so horrible.  
i'm still being bothered though by somethings that happened while i was up there.  he has a lot of girly friends.  some of them i don't care about, but some of them bother me.  he has quite an attatchment to a few, which makes me feel inadequate.  i don't want to say much to him about it because i don't want to go changing his routines.  so he has this one friend, who i had..issues with before.  i read something on his myspace some time before i went up their that freaked me out.  it became obvious to me that they had feelings for each other at some point.  i was kind of pissed that he hadn't let me know since we were talking again, etc.  so, the first time i was up there she called and messaged him nonstop, and viceversa.  i was fine with it.. until i got home and my mind started going crazy because i was away from him etc etc.  so i ended up having these really messed up dreams about them that really upset me.  i told him about it.. things were fine, end of story.  i didnt hear about her for a long time after that.   until recently.  before i went up there, i called him really late.. like 2am or something.  he's at her house watching a movie.   this dissappointed me greatly.  i said nothing about it..  
so fast forward to my last trip up there.  we go to the bars one night.. big woop.   we're sitting thereblahblah.. and he sees her she's there.  ""oh fucking great"" i think to myself.  so i finally get to see her.   he goes to talk to her.  the insecurity sets in.. she's so much prettier than me.  hatred is bubbling in my veins watching them.  they flirt like retarded children.  and it pisses me off.  whatever.. i dont care.  i didnt say anything, i didn't want to.  it's my problem, right?  i'm probably just over reacting..  because the situation makes everything messy and complicated.  so i decide to not think about it.. whatever.
a couple days later, he flips out and loses his thumb ring.  which was made by her that he doesnt leave the house without leaving.  this in itself makes me extremely uncomfortable.  his reaction to losing it really freaked me out.  he flipped out looking for it and couldn't stop thinking about it.  he broke his key to get in his car flipping out looking for it.  we had to walk a mile or so to the dealership to get a new one.  he found it in his car.  he was fine.   while he was flipping out, i ignored him, because the situation greatly irritated me.  i told him, it wasn't that big of a deal.. it's just a peice of metal.  he responded with.. but she gave it to me.. she's my homie.  or some bullshit.  i just glared at him and continued ignoring him.
it has not been spoken of since.   but it's still bothering the shit out of me.   that whole situation is.   i don't really want to confront him about it, but i feel it may be inevitable if my mind doesnt stop going crazy.
on a happier note: i'm finally getting an HL camera!  WOOO!  :D"

this is insane.
i'm taking a last minute flight to PA, ASAP.   my dad, brother, and i, were supposed to drive out there this week.  but my dad is a compulsive gambler.   i should've known, should've expected it.  he's fucked up so many things in my life because of his problem.  i had to work 10 days in a row leading up to the day we were supposed to leave (today).  so i had no time to do anything.  i was already behind.  but dad was supposed to come over and help me with stuff.. but he kept bailing on me.  today rolls around, we were supposed to leave early this morning.   apparantly my dad doesn't even have a hotel booked.  
i feel like he's stranded me, i already took a week off from my work.  i can't drive up there, because my tags are expired.. we were supposed to do that yesterday.  didn't happen.
so i've been really upset all day.  i called my mom and she told me she would make sure i got down there.
thank god for moms.  i can just stay with patrick and not deal with it.   he is on break so we'll have all kinds of time together.
i love my mom right now.
i never thought she would help me with this situation."

i'm ultra excited because i'm getting a bunch of new lamb soon.  patrick bought me some lamb shoes.. i bought me some lamb shoes..  and i'm getting a hoody and a bunch of shirts!   it's my birthday coming up so i figured i'd treat myself.  as soon as i get everything i'm going to take picutres of everything i have and go nuts with it.  happy!
patrick and i are doing lovely as always.  i feel bad for constantly posting such negative stuff about him in here.  i'm always venting in here about something.  oh well..  no big deal.

this whole thing is starting to really bother me and get on my nerves.  i need to talk to him about it but i don't even know where to begin.   it sounds so trivial and stupid.  but it's seriously affecting me.
i shouldn't feel this way.

someone needs to tell me to stop overreacting.  i just can't deal with things sometimes.  it's obviously a side effect of the situation.  but it's like..  i can't even get into it.  
it just makes me sick.
i don't want to question him.  but i can't tell how to take things because the distance gets in the way.  
here he is constantly telling me he loves me.. but i question it because i'm always so suspicious.  i guess i can't let go of the past.   it's like i expect to get screwed over somehow.  so i look for it.  
i just can't figure out if it's something i need to change, or him.
i dont want to make him change anything.
i guess i'm a jealous person.  or something.
but that doesnt make any sense.

sometimes i fear moving up there.  i don't want the drama he somehow manages to get himself involved in to spill over into our relationship.   i dont' want all the retarded girls he hangs out with, to get their grubby little hands on us.  he doesnt realize what crazy jealous girls can do if given a motive.
i don't want to have a sad ending with him.

why doesnt he come here and see me?   i guess i should stop being so QUIET.
i just don't think he has any idea, hidden under the tranquil surface, i'm insane.
i keep trying to hold on to the memories, and they're slipping away.  i need to make more."

i really don't want to be back here in this mindset.  it's like i'm looking for reasons.  it's like my mind went there once and now i'm fucked.  i guess i just keep getting irritated at his naivety.  i dont know the situations he talks about, only what he tells me, and my mind generally goes to the worst places.
it's just frustrating that every night our conversations are punctuated with various different girly friends interfering by his choice.  maybe i am insane and crazy and i should rethink things.  which i'd like to think is the case.  but i'm having issues shaking it at the moment.  maybe i'm feeling insecure lately.  or maybe i just miss him and i'm losing grasp of things as a result of the extended absences.  i feel that i should address them here and now with myself before they boil over into ridiculousness.
i don't like this.  when i think of him usually happy thoughts are attatched.  but i'm forgetting the happy thoughts and being overtaken by these weird insane jealous nightmares.  
it just irritates me that he never questions a <i>girl</i> and her motives for his attention.  he's an attention whore's goldmine.  he has a save the world complex and i can already see how stupid manipulate girls/women can play with him with that.  over victimization on the part of a female also severely irritates me, and the fact that most of his friends have these issues worries me.  maybe he's just attracted to that.  but then that leads me to think, well i'm the queen of it all, so i must be his leading victim.  which further lowers my self esteem.  the irritating part is that i know it's bullshit thinking.
add on top of this my paranoia about how i'm being perceived by these various girls.  does he talk about us?  are they even aware that he's involved?  does he just throw himself out there?   should i even be asking these questions?
i trust him.  but sometimes he makes me question that.
and i <i>definetely</i> don't trust manipulative overly victimized girls."

i'm irritated again.
i always find something to be upset or irritated about.  and then i write it off within a time span of about half an hour because of the situation.   i only hope this vicious cycle does not follow me.
i'm also irritated today because i had a dream about chris last night.   it was irritating and annoying.   
i dont want to deal with my brother today.  i'm not in the mood to put on the boxing gloves.
why are all of his friends flirty girls?
and why does it bother me?
why does it bother me that half of his friends probably think horrible things about the two of us because he probably never talks about me and then i show up and then i leave and he goes back to hanging out with all of his girly friends.
i guess it would look kind of funny to me too.
which is i guess why it continues to bother me.
his friends obviously don't take the situation seriously because one of them thinks he's interested in his girlfriend.  
i fucking hate this bullshit.

just read that tom and mieke are expecting their first child!   exciting!  :)    i went to the gwen show on nov. 14 in st. paul.  it was amazing.  i didnt get 2nd row like i had originally intended because of stupid stupid annoying situations that kept happening.  so i got 7th.  still pretty cool.    though if it would've been 2nd, i could've got on stage for hollaback girl.   which makes me mad!   but oh well!    here's a link to my pictures from the show.. <a href=""http://photobucket.com/albums/1003/nodoubtaholic/gwen-stpaul-11-14/"" target=""_blank"">clicky</a>   there's over 100 there.  some of them turned out awful.. but some of them turned out pretty good.  my digital camera is really old.
i dont have much else to say.   i'm not really in the mood to update.   but i felt like it because i was sick of seeing the previous entry."

i'm so stressed about everything right now.
i miss patrick.  i feel constantly...jealous, about the whole situation.  meeting the people he talks about finally was nice.  but once again i'm caught in this trap of insecurity.  mostly because something was suggested to me.   my mind takes it and goes insane.  my imagination runs off before logic even kicks in.  it's irritating as fuck.  i dont want to be one of those miserable girlfriends who guards and controls her boyfriend like he's some kind of object.  i trust him.  i just don't trust other girls.   i get jealous of the fact that he even cares about someone else of the opposite sex.  
i just have a bad feeling and i don't like it.
the only thing i don't like about him, is this saving everyone complex he has.  i fear that someday in the far off future we, or any family we start, could fall apart.  because he'd be off saving everyone else.
i guess a lot of it has to do with chris.   god i fucking hate that i even went out with him..  i always knew he was fucking around with other people behind my back.  but i purposely chose to close my eyes to it.  i couldn't handle it.  sometimes i see fleeting memories of certain situations from him, and it gets me all wound up.
i'm just insane.
i have to get out there so my mind can stop wandering and worrying and cooking up these extravagent bullshit..things.  it's just bullshit.
related subject, my last excursion up there to visit was absolutely mind alteringly awesome.  coming home, going back to work, going back to how we have to deal with the situation really fucking sucks.  i'm having a hard time with it.   i guess that's the bottom line."

 my brother is coming home for good on friday.  it was a sudden decision.. but it had been building up to this for quite some time.  
it's funny how when i'm finally used to being here by myself, into my own routines, etc..  he's coming home.  
i also had a horrible conversation with my mom the other night in which she indirectly implied that i caused him to fail.  both not true.  he hasn't failed, and nor did i cause anything of the sort.  but the suggestion got me all bent out of shape.  i was upset with myself for letting her get to me like that.  i ended up crying myself to sleep.
anyway..  i can't wait till he comes home!  and THEN i get to go see patrick on tuesday!   this is going to be awesome.
i dont really know why i'm posting.   i'm just in the mood i guess.
could be the small amount of alcohol i had at cara's house.  we watched south park and mallrats.  it was fun."

so i had a funky dream last night.  gerard way from my chemical romance was trying to have sex with me.  i kept refusing saying, ""what about patrick??""  i think we made out or something and i suddenly started flipping out remembering patrick.  it was weird.  so then i get up..with the weirdness still in my head.. and i read my chemical romance fanfic all day long.  i don't know why.  but the stuff i read was really pretty decent.. i sat and read for like 6 hours.  seriously.  there were like 40 some chapters to this huge ass story.  involving gerard.  i dont' really have a crush on him or anything.. that dream just kind of weirded me out and i kind of stumbled upon it and kept reading.  anyway, the point is, it made me super duper want patrick.  because it was such a romance novel type thing.  not like graphic sex.. a few lovemaking scenes here and there, but it was a sweet story.  and it made me think of him and look forward to all the things we'll be doing next week.  and how we've ended up together.  and how neither of us can seem to escape it.  all of the things i want to do to him, with him...share with him.  i want to share my life with him.  and the fact that it's staring the both of us in the face is so incredibly relieving and scary all at the same time.  i look forward to it so much.   the story i was reading was just.. so perfect.  and it made me further realize how lucky i am, to have what i have with him.  lots of people search and never find it.
maybe i'm just crazy.

i'm pissed.  i was going to get 2nd row gwen tickets.  my dad gave me 500 bucks to splurge. i had found some for 275 each.  the same day my mom asked to borrow 300.   so i let her.  not like i really couldn't.  i would've never heard the end of it..   she's paying me back on friday.   checked the tickets today they went up to fucking 300 something a peice.

so i was watching <a href=""http://boss.streamos.com/real/virg001/ima_robot/video/st/montage_pt_1_300.ram?siteid=artistsite0504"" target=""_blank"">this</a>, and reminiscing about how i was so so so obsessed with ima robot's cd. i still am, but it's not as fresh now i've listened to it a thousand times.   but this song, scream specifically, no matter where i was, what i was doing, i always thought of patrick.  and watching that vid of them, the same feeling came over me that used to come over me with this song.  and it made me so thankful that i have him now.  and we're at where we're at.  it's so amazing.  he will always be ""the best love i've ever had""...  i just can't believe we've made it this far now.  i keep thinking about now and where i was at a year ago.  how lost i was then.   
something i dont think he understands about me, is that everything i'm obsessive over, everything i get crazy about, links to him in some way.  which is essentially why i love it so much.  i dont know if he'll ever get that.    but that's ok.   
i fucking love this song and i really miss ima robot.
i'm not sure what the point of this was..  i havent really been in much of a livejournal mood lately.  though my burns healed.  you can't see anything now."

today was a weird, bad day.
i go to work, things are going good.. i'm in a good mood..   frying a breaded chicken sandwich.  i go to get the tongs and get the chicken out of the fryer.  not quite done yet.  put the chicken back in the fryer, careful not to splash.  suddenly the tongs spring open sending scalding grease every which way.  the only exposed portions of my body are my face neck and arms.  immediately i run to the sink thinking, oh great, gotta get this shit off of me before it really burns.  cold rag.. get it off.  i run to the bathroom to check the damage,  thinking..  hopefully it's not too bad.   i get to the mirror.  holy shit fuck in hell.  my face looks insane.  vivid red burns all over. i look like a leper.  around my lips, right by my eye (thank god not in my eye), all over my chin, and the worst of it on my neck.  i immediately try to calm myself down, as it's now starting to really hurt.  my first thought was, oh god how do i fix this so it's not permanent.   i go out of the bathroom, and show allan.  allan yells for carol.  everyone's looking at me in shock.  carol gives me neosporin and i run to the bathroom to lather it on.   allan calls the ER. carol comes in the bathroom to check it out.   she asks if i should go to the ER.  i ask her what can they really do?  she agrees..   ER says to keep it cool with ice water..  lots of neosporin, maybe some aleve to ease the pain if it's bad.  should be fine in a few days.  carol sends me home.  
i go home and freak out.  patrick calms me down, i watch harry potter with cold rags all over my face and fall asleep.  i wake up at 5pm.  i immediately run to the bathroom to see what it looks like now.  no more red!  thank god.  it's not so bad.
pathetic.
i guess i'm off tomorrow too.  
for a fleeting second, i believed i might have scars on my face for the rest of my life.  kind of scary."

i forgot to say that my mom brought me back some lamb pants.  :D   200 bucks.  she brought me back the football flood pants, in white.   they didnt have any other colors in my size.  i love the heart and the low belt.   they look awesome on me.  i can wear it with one of my first season shirts, and my leapard print pumps.. so hot.  
i'm so broke right now it's not even funny.
thank you stupid car.  380something dollars to get them to fix whatever problem the check engine light came on for.  i have an extended warranty, and apparantly the problem wasn't covered.  such bullshit.
very irritating.   i bet i can con my mom into buying me more lamb stuff when the fall line comes out though!  ooohh  awesomelyness.
i'm also getting excited about goblet of fire.  this movie looks like it's actually going to possible do the book justice.  PoA was kind of crappy as far as changing things from the book.  i think they might just redeem themselves with this one.
anyway, i dont know what the point of this was.   i'm weird."

i spilled the beans last night.  exact reaction i was expecting.  i'm just crazy.  it did make me feel better in a way.  but in some ways i still feel the same.  hopefully i'll get over it.  i'm just sick of this same situation.  i'm done with it.  i want to move.  i want to not have to travel all day long just to see him.  
on a totally different subject.  dana and i haven't spoke since harry potter came out.  she pissed me off that night because she was getting drunk in the bookstore.  it was ridiculous and childish.  i was almost embarassed to be seen with her.  i had to borrow 20 from her to get the book because i had no cash.  i should've just written a check or something.  but the 20 dollar thing turned into this big deal with her and now we haven't been speaking.  after i borrowed the money she suddenly turned into some kind of psycho.  which i know was because she needed 20 to buy either booze or drugs.  so she started talking shit about me behind my back to von.  i told her i was going to pay her back the next day, and i stayed up all night reading.. of course.  so i got up really late, she tried to call while i was sleeping and flipped out because i didnt answer the phone.  at that point i had to go to work, so i couldn't go to the bank and get her money.  i offered to write her a check but she didnt want that.  so whatever, i paid her back the next day.  she thinks that i dont keep my word, and i'm a liar now because i didnt pay her back the next day, and i didn't answer the phone.  at that point i was like.. ok this is getting to be like my mom's drama and i dont need anymore of it.  she started talking shit about me to von calling me names, i called her and asked her what was up, she acted like nothing was wrong.  i asked her why she's not saying these things to me instead of von.  we argued, i told her to go to rehab.   haven't heard from her since.  that was over a month ago.  von talks to her.  apparantly she thinks i hate her.   whatever.  i should call her.  but i'm too lazy.   she doesnt listen.  she talks herself into circles and it gets really frustrating to watch.  
yeah i'm just ranting now.
i think i'm going to take a nap.  none of that made any sense i'm sure."

yeah.. i'm over it.  i'm just prettymuch insane.
i felt better after he called me last night and his mom and brother were there and i could hear them and i felt like i was back at his house.  and his mom brought a framed picture of us for him.  which makes me happy on many levels.  
i need to get back into shape.  i downloaded pilates.. for your abs.  i can tell it works.  i'm going to TRY to do it every day.  i have to get school done.  I HAVE TO.  i don't know what my problem is.   it's the only thing keeping me back.  and it's stupid.

i had another bad dream.  this one was worse than the last. i suppose i should ask him about it then?  it's starting to take over my subconcious.  things just add up weird to me.. or something.   or maybe it's just jealousy plain and simple.   i'm not really sure.  either way, i need some soothing words.  and i'm sure his response will be, in this order, shock, confusion, and reassurance.  
i just start thinking about it and it drives me crazy.
probably also has a lot to do with chris and how he treated me.  sadly.  he kind of marred my trust.  not saying i don't trust him, i just feel..  wrong, at the moment.  i definetely trust him.  i don't trust girls though.  especially crazy ones.  
one bad thing about me, always has been my nature, i act so unaware/oblivious all of the time to things.  because i find out more information that way.  it creates this comfort level with someone because they don't think i'm listening, but i am.  always.  
truth be told, i guess i'm a sneaky little bitch. 
i just hate this feeling of dread.   i hate weird dreams that wake you up and fill you with dread that haunts you for the rest of the day.  as if whatever happened in your dream, actually happened.  you know it didnt, but it makes you start questioning and doubting things you hadn't really thought about.
all of this actually, should be blamed on his myspace.  theres this entry that keeps flashing in my mind, it has for the last month, ever since i stumbled upon it.  what irks me even more is that it's an entry just after we started talking again.   maybe that shouldn't mean anything, but i can't shake it.  
if i don't address it soon, something retarded and bad is going to happen.  like i'm going to blow up for no reason or something.   i almost did the other night on the phone with him.  he mentions her name, my mind starts going millions of miles an hour. his first day back and he's already spent hours with her. 
I'M BEING RIDICULOUS and i know it.
i just can't get rid of it.
why do i not say anything?  because i'm afraid of upsetting the balance.  and i know he won't forget it.  and it could change things, and i hate change, because change has almost always been traumatic and hard for me.
i need to work on my communication.  these insane awful dreams have to stop.
this is reducing me to a heaping pile of low self esteem."

just finished harry potter number 6 last night.
very shocking events.    that's all i'll say just in case, so i don't spoil anything for anyone who may come across this.
..
i still can't get over it though.
anyway, i thought i'd be literally pouring my heart out about my trip to see pat. but i don't want to.  because when i do that in here it's what i do to dump off a feeling i'd like to move on from.  i don't want to move on from the feeling so i'm keeping it within.  
i go back in a little more than a week.   the 27th.  
something i'd like to examine though, was the goodbye and traveling back.  that was difficult.  the time was perfect for reflection and such.. but still, sad.  luckily i had a seat to myself.  i kept my sunglasses on and my face almost pressed to the window for half the flight.  i remember thinking as we took off, and we were getting higher and further away from the ground and the city, not to cry, though i was.  and telling him in my mind not to, as if i were telepathic or something.  saying goodbye to the landscape, as if it belonged to him or was apart of him.  i knew he was down there somewhere probably driving home.  later on i found he stayed and watched my plane take off.   i listened to hawthorne heights, for some reason it was the only thing that would comfort me.  which seemed weird to me, but lyrically it was speaking to me at that moment.  specifically the song 'transition'.  
i didn't realize how apparant it would be.  there's no doubt in my mind at this point that we will probably live happily ever after.  i just didnt think it would be this obvious.  i never knew what it felt like for things to come so naturally.  my last joke of a relationship was such a fake.  everything was forced and wrong.  like trying to put the last piece in a jigsaw puzzle and it being obviously not the right peice.   this experience has been exactly the opposite.  i feel i fit perfectly.  it just feels right.  no fear.  which was always something i cherished most..  all my life my relationships with nearly everyone have been riddled with fear.  
he is very much the center of all the worlds i create in my head.  
i command everyone to read harry potter and the half blood prince."

von's home. i'm in a really weird akward mood.  i read something that made me feel.. weird.   and weird.  and it's irking me and haunting me and driving me crazizy...  but i won't go into detail because i'm too lazy to get it all unraveled at the moment.  
just remind me.. when i see a link he posts.. not to go getting all curious.  just leave it alone.  it just ruins things.  and makes me feel all full of doubt.  and i shouldn't do that, because it's ridiculous.

i dont know what the fuck is up with my mom.  as soon as i got home from visiting pat she sits me down and tells me about how she thinks she might be interested in someone.  and proceeds to quiz me on relationships/love.  WTF?  my mom?!  my mom has been desire-less for as long as i can remember.  she hasnt even whispered the idea of someone else since my dad.  and now suddenly it's staring me in the face.  it's kind of creepy.  i'm glad it's happening now and not when i was younger.  i would not have been able to handle it then.  so now she's all giddy and acting like a little high school girl.  and i'm like.. jesus mom..  i'm the one whose supposed to be like this.. not you!  
the guy she's 'dating' i guess now..  weird..  is someone we've known for a long time actually.  he just started ""studying"" with people from my mom's religion and is close to being baptized.  
it pains me to say that as much as my mom has been through she's still retardedly stupid and naive about some things.  like love.  she didnt know the kind of emotions she is feeling even existed.  i always figured she was just extremely jaded from the life she's led.. but i guess i was wrong.  
in the end this is turning into a good thing with me because she understands where i'm coming from now.
she needs to be careful though..
maybe this is some new cry for attention from her.   i god i hope not.  she always manages to turn things that have nothing to do with her into revolving around her.  hopefully this isnt another attempt.  it seems fairly genuine.  but i need to investigate further."

where do i even begin?
what an amazing week.  AMAZING.  being with him was even more wonderful than i could have ever imagined.  i think i was in a state of retarded contentment the whole time i was there.  everything had(has) some kind of euphoric glow.  maybe it was the jet lag.  maybe it was just the fact that i am so ridiculously in love with him.  i have no doubts, absolutely no doubts in my mind at this point that we will be together for a very very long time.  if not foreveeeer.  and that makes me very happy.  i want his family to be mine.  
i feel like something is finally going right in my life.  something is finally where i want it to be.  it makes me so happy i could burst.
he let me keep my favorite of his shirts. it smells like him.  it's yummy.  they say it's some subconcious thing with women that you have to be attracted to a man's smell to be really attracted.  well i can definetely attest to that.  
i also didnt know i would enjoy giving pleasure so much.  it felt so good to finally be able to communicate with him with my body.  it felt so comfortable with him.  i've never felt more comfortable as myself before.
i have to go to sleep.. but i will be adding more about this delicious experience later."

should i bring prescription percocet?  i'm always scared to death i will get another kidney stone attack or something... but i'm afraid to bring it on my luggage.. even if it's checked luggage... since it's a 'narcotic..'    dammit. 
still havent told mom..  i guess dad and i decided to wait until she's done with the assembly this weekend.  otherwise she's gonna go off blabbering to her friends about it..getting their opinions about it.. and probably scheming.  i'm afraid of what her reaction will be.   it's either gonna go one way or the other.  i'm lucky my dad has my back.  and von.  thank jesus.
oh i also need to get new headphones for my cd player.   i'm gonna have a lot of travel time to kill..  i should also bring Harry.. something to occupy my brain so i dont get too anxious and start worrying about stupid things.   but i still can't figure out what to wear while traveling.  anything devoid of metal is good.. i forgot to not wear my belt when going to mexico last and got stopped for the security love.  i usually get past it.. but unfortunately at my airport if you even so much as set off the metal detector they stop you and pull you aside to pat you down and sit you in a chair.  then they get to feel you up.  fortunately it has to be a female and they are usually ridiculously nice about it.  the last lady turned it into somewhat of a joke.   
airports don't really make me nervous at all.  i infact love airports and the idea of travel.  i'm super excited to get to finally travel alone.  i'm glad i've had 'training' in coming back and forth from mexico so many times.  this is going to be like a breeze compared to some of the crap i've dealt with at airports..  like triple connections.   rushing around..  this will be easy since i have like 3 hours inbetween the first and second flight.  i can get a bite to eat and relax and not rush around trying to find the gate.  
i love international travel.  when we went cancun we went through atlanta.  i really liked that airport because of the international gates all lined up next to one another.  our gate was at the very end of the terminal so we walked past 10 or so gates.  all having different nationalities.   japan, germany, france, mexico, you name it.  each clustered together at each gate.   very interesting to see and hear so many different cultures and languages at once.  
it's also a weird feeling being a minority in other countries.  in mexico people treat you very well because americans are considered so much higher class..  they perceieve us as rich.  which compared to them we are.  very.  it's also interesting to note though, that mexico's culture seems to be a lot more content.  i believe that most enjoy the way they live.. they're so much more laid back.  material things mean a lot less to them.  they don't make what they posess an equivalent to who they are, or how successful they are. which is a main reason i always enjoy mexico so much.
i should shutup i got off on a tangent.
back to overpacking my probably too large luggage.  :)
i should make my list like i usually do."

yesterday my dad calls me up and says ""lets barbeque!""  so i went and picked him up and we went to the grocery store and went home and did it.  it was fun.  relaxing.. etc.  it was very nice.  i miss doing stuff like that.  it felt good.  talked to dad about ideas for plans for the future.  how i'm going to do things financially down the road.. etc.  my dad is so cool sometimes.  we talked about telling mom about me going to see pat.  he's taking me to the airport.   and pickingme up i think.  i need to give him all the info..  but yeah.  had a good time showing him some new music stuff.   we went and bought von's ticket today for when he comes home.  went to best buy, and borders..  got a new cd, the hawthorne heights one, which is awesome by the way.  
just had a good day off with dad.
that's it i guess.
i'm in one of those BLAHBLAHBLAH moods.   like i'm just spitting out the information.  OH WELL.   
16 fucking days.
holy meatballs.
i fell asleep last night dreaming about it.   OOH  it's gonna be so awesome.
oh yeah i went to my work and talked to cara for awhile about sex stuff.  we were talking about porn.. and sex toys.  found out we both have similar sex toys.  HAHA.  funnyness.  but it's so fucked up how if any of the guys at my work knew this side of me.. this dirty side of me.. their whole perception of me would change.  i would then be slutty to them.  it's so stupid. guys can be over the top sexual.. but when a girl even talks about watching a porn it gets taken way out of hand.  like OMG YOU WATCH PORN!!..  usually they think you're awesome.. and then they lose respect.
it's fucked up."

awwwwwwwwww i miss this night:
<img src=""http://www.imarobot.com/ontheroad/20040304-Lawrence/IMG_02.jpg"">
i'm in the red.  von is behind me in orange looking extremely uncomfortable.  i hope i get to see ima robot again at the bottleneck specifically.  i was having way too much fun to be allowed.  alex was vibing off me.   it was excellent.    i was his ""new girl"" that night.  (as specified in black jettas.. he sang the line to me and pointed me out.)
oh man did that start the biggest crush in the history of me.  
..
i want several tattoos.  ima robot being one of them.  the tiny circle robot emblem (like their cd) somewhere.  my ""i dream of ebert"" saying somewhere very very miniscule.  and my no doubt tatts.    and i've always wanted in very cursivey type writing somewhere also fairly small 'sweetpea'.  that's my favorite pet name.  the only person that can call me that is pat though.  any time anyone else tries it it sucks.  so i dunno.
what was the point of this you ask?
just to make you jealous.
i like alex's tattoos.  they're very primal."

i guess i'm just a silly sally.  he told me he read my previous entry and i should quit stressing.  so i quit stressing.
saw star wars with cara will shelby and cara's sister.  shelby and cara smoked a joint in my presence before we left so i kind of got a contact high..  which was weird.   but star wars was really good.  i was pleasantly surprised.   so we went back to cara's house afterwards and watched the incredibles which was really pretty good.  and they kept smoking so i was getting a contact high again.  while watching the incredibles. so i was a tiny bit giggly.  i didnt end up getting home until 5 in the morning.  mom was having a cat.. but she's okay today.  i think she understands that i'm freaking 20 now.. she should let off a little.. it's not like i do that all the time or anything.
so anyway.. i'm just not gonna worry about things.  i think i'm gonna watch the battle of shaker heights now.   
i can't believe this is all happening to me now.   pat and i are finally at this really good place.    i love him.  nothing's gonna stand in the way of it this time.   i can feel it."

this is an embarassing but very vital problem.  being female entails a certain visitor.  who i think may be visiting during my visit with pat.  which is really really really pissing me off.  all i can do is hope that it will wait.. or come early.   or that it won't matter.   i'm sure it won't.. it will just be an irritation.   i felt like crying when it happened.. i dont want to tell him right now..  or yet.  anyway.   OH this is not cool.   it didnt come on schedule this month..  which fucked everything up.  if it comes on schedule next month it will be almost the exact days i'm there.

^^ i have those undies.   har har.   i love gwen's mole above her belly button.  
i can't wait to be in his arms.  there's no doubt in my mind i will be so comfortable.  i can't wait to kiss him.  and have HIM kissing me on my neck.  finally.
i wonder what he's gonna do when he sees me.  i'm trying to decide if i should be akward..  or if i should just let it all out and be a spazz and like JUMP on him.   he claims he is going to kiss me..     should i bring him a present? hmmm..     i will feel stupid if i do.. and he doesn't.  well no i won't.   i just don't want to make him feel stupid.  he's gonna be all showing me off..  hooray!   
crazyness all over!

weird day so far.  got up and finally drove all the way out to kansas to close the refinancing thing on my car.  it's now totally in my name.  and the payments went down, the percentage went down.. i'll have it paid off sooner now.  thank god.  the percentage before was outrageous.  but i have good credit now.  ha ha!  :)  
so that girl i ran into at that party last weekend called me at like 9 this morning, i didnt pick up cuz i was half asleep..  but it's kinda cool.
i went and played with mason, my nephew, since he was good at school today.  and it's really freakin hot outside..  we were playing frisbee.. andi hadn't eaten all day.  yeah i'm stuipid.  so we've been playing for like 20 minutes..  and i'm startingto feel woozy so i have to stop.   slowly i start to feel really light headed.  i almost fainted.  my hearing was going bye bye, i couldn't see hardly..   everything was white.  it looked like some kind of crazy video or something.. cuz it was all distorted and funky too...   so i sat down in my car..  more like stumbled over.  and cranked up the air in my car.  started feeling better.  told dana i was sorry.. i'm lame and should have ate before i came.  so then i drove to taco bell.. and my face was SOo red.  kind of embarassing.  but oh well.   
so now i've eaten and i'm sooo tired.    i'm gonna take a bath i think.    mmm.."

now i'm back with pat, i forgot the way he made me feel.  i realize now how i took that for granted.  he has always made me feel so good about myself.  everything about myself.. i i feel like i'm queen, because i'm queen of his world.  i was going through a stage of such bad self image/self esteem for awhile there.  but he always makes me realize that yes i am pretty (or has he says ""you're not pretty stupid, you're gorgeous"")..  yes i can probably have any guy i want..  but i want him.   i always have.

so monday night everyone from my work decides to finally take will out for his birthday that was last month.  so it ends up being me, will, allan, cara, and shelby.  so allan and shelby keep drinking the pitchers of beer.  in about 3 hours they go through 10 pitchers.  cara decides to join in, by the time the nights over they go through about 15 pitchers of beer.  they are all so drunk.  will and i are laughing our asses off.  we obviously turned into the designated drivers for the night.  shelby was being ridiculous though.  he was getting a litte out of hand.  i guess he has the biggest crush on me ever (which by the way he's 28..).  but it was ok because i everyone has my back about it.  it was just a lot of little things from him, like it's my turn to bowl and yells really loud that i have the best ass ever.   that was a little annoying.  i turned around and gave him the finger.  but that made me laugh so hard because it was so ridiculous and made me feel really self concious because i knew that everyone was looking at my ass.  i'm just glad i didn't have to drive him home.  i drove cara and allan home.  it was funny.  stopped and got them taco bell.  they were so silly.
cara wants to camp out in her parents back yard.  her mom wants us to and said she'd buy all the booze.  
woo.. this summer looks like it's gonna be fun.  i'm finally gonna see patrick, and i'm gonna party with my friends.  better do it now if i want to leave at the end of the summer.  i reminded cara of that last night and she was like ""shutup i dont wanna hear it..""  and got all sad.  it was cute."

it's official.   i bought tickets.  i'm going to see him.  in less than a month.  it is SO amazing how quickly things can change.   von is coming home for vacation in july.  and everything so far is falling into place.  
aside from that, i went to a bitchin party over the weekend.  john threw a house party.  there were 3 bands (local).  i had such a blast.  we were dancing like spazzoids to one of the bands (wolf economy) and everyone was looking at us like we were crazy.  there were like 100 people there.  i saw austin again.  freaked me out a little.   i walked past him as i was going into the house to go to the bathroom.  we looked at each other and it wasfunny the look on his face as he realized who i was.  he was like ""hey!""  kind of cool about it and i totally gave him the cold shoulder.  heh kind of literally actually.   i punched him really fucking hard on the arm and was like ""i didnt think i'd see YOU here!""  and i kept walking to the bathroom.  i think he thought i was gonna stop and talk to him.   so then i came back out and we (john and me and couple of his other friends) spazzed to wolf economy.  all the while he was totally doing the same thing he did at borders.  i shot him a few teaser smiles and that was it.  suddenly i looked up and he was gone.   oh well!   
so then i saw a chick i met when i was with chris.  talked to her a little.. she told me he's insane and i should be glad to be rid of him.  he's an alcoholic according to her.  so i dunno.. it sounds like he's totally gone off the deep end.  OH WELL!!  not my problem.  hooray!   so glad it's not my problem.   and i really hope that she doesnt tell him she talked to me and he gets this bright idea to suddenly call me or something.  that would not be cool.
ogmomgomgogmogm i can't believe i'm going to see PATRICK.
so yeah!  awesomely awesome party at john's house.  hot dogs will from now on be referred to as 'splittin bitches'."

last sunday - the shit finally hit the fan.
after i had the conversation with patrick as stated below, i saved that conversation on my computer.  (i still am not sure why, that's kind of unusual for me..)   i go to work the next day, and find out at work that my mom found the conversation.  that conversation contained like some of the worst stuff she could possibly see about patrick, my views on the whole jw thing... so so many things. so  for awhile i thought i was seriously being kicked out of my house, and all kinds of crazy shit.  i was freaked the fuck out.  to say the least. i left work early, and went and picked up my dad so that i could go home and at least have a mediator.  i wasn't sure if my shit was gonna be all over the house, or what.  luckily i had a lot of people helping me out in calming her down about it.   so by the time i talked to her, she was at least fairly rational.    she took away the internet, and i just now finally talked her back into giving it back.
i would say a whole lot more about that whole thing, but i don't know right now i'm not really in the mood.  according to the new 'rules' for the internet, i have to be off by 2.  and that time is quicky approaching.
i just can't begin to explain how weird it was sitting at my kitchen table talking to my mom and dad about patrick.  not that i didnt expect it to eventually happen, just not in that fashion.  i just wasn't expecting it.   it's a difficult thing to defend, i don't feel i should have to.  there's nothing really to 'defend'.   it is what it is.  period.   i certainly can't change it.  it's just a huge relief not having to hide it anymore.  but at the same time that was also my protection from my mom's prying eyes.  she knows how to make you crazy with things.  and she's already starting to try.  trying (and failing miserably) at planting seeds of doubt."

just had a VERY interesting conversation with patrick.  i dont understand myself sometimes.  i revisited some memories and thoughts that i haven't even touched in over a year.  which led me to a few realizations about things.  i hadn't realized how screwed up i still am from my childhood and how i was raised as a JW.  how that still spills over into other areas of my life.  subconciously there are things that are still embedded, ways of thought, i need to change.  so i was a little riled up.  then we got to talking about eternal sunshine of the spotless mind.  which is my favorite movie ever.  (it finally knocked the virgin suicides out of the top spot)..  and how he finally watched it.  he immediately told me about how it reminded him of someone else.  which was, i admit, a let down.  which made me think more about how i feel like i've failed myself and everyone else.  if i had finished school and not fucked around and went to college maybe none of that shit would've happened and she wouldn't have claimed part of his heart.  or psyche anyway.  and then i started talking about von.  which is a really touchy subject for me right now for some reason.  i've never had to deal with this void before.  i've never had to deal with being truely alone.  and then i began to delve into the area of being the identity of 'von's sister'.  which is so so so easy for me to slip into that role.  i enjoy it to some extent, but it's still a torturous existence.  how i've never really actually thought about what i'm going to do with myself.  i'm so used to slipping into someone else's shadow.  now that von is gone i have nowhere to hide.  i have unfortunately sacrificed some of myself to not get in the way of his dreams.  all the while never even bothering to delve into my own desires.
pat is such a strong motivation for me, and such a.. i dunno.. a source of strength.  i dont think he really understands that, but it has always been the case.
and i have to go to work at 10.  and it's fugging 5 am.  fuck me.

on a side note: it's always interesting to me how gwen's life, or her music, seems to parallel with me.  what you waiting for.. the lyrics of that song..   ""what an amazing time, what a family, how did the years go by? now it's only me.  like an echo petal you're repeating yourself, you know it all by heart why are you standing in one place? what you waiting for? take a chance you stupid ho!""

so after that adventure came february.  which was boring.  my birthday was boring and depressing.  i went to lazer tag by myself.  hung out with john, he works there now.  it was stupid to say the least.  but at the time i was considering john.  we kind of indirectly talked about going out.  we talked about how he doesn't want to be in any kind of serious relationship right now.  and i agreed.  that conversation was the only interesting thing that happened.
after that came march, in which my mom and i went to mexico.  my mom won a trip with her company to puerta vallarta all expenese paid.  so we were excited, but my mom thought it would be stupid if we went to mexico and didn't try to figure out how to meet up with von.  so we had it all worked out..  we went to puerta vallarta for 3 days and mexico city for 3 days.  the puerta vallarta trip was with a TON of my mom's work people.  who have all known me since i was little.  so it's like being with a ton of people that you know really well in mexico.  it was a blast!  the only people my age were christine, she works with my mom, christine's friend amanda, and mike.  mike was the son of a guy in accounting, or something of that nature, who works right with the president of the company my mom works for.  the president was there too.  he was cool.  i ended up totally developing a crush on mike.  i didn't move on it.. but i know something probably would've happened if i'd been there the full trip instead of leaving for mexico city.  we spent so much time together.  it was cool though.  totally friends level.  but i knew there was some underlying 'chemistry' or what not. 
so i will try to remember what exactly happened though my memory is a bit blurred from so much drinking.  which is crazy as i've never really heavily drank before that.  the first day was pretty uneventful.  the next day i got really drunk.  early in the day i had a double shot of tequila, for social reasons.  i then tried to boogie board.. totally brutal that was.  don't do that and be drunk.  it was really really fun though.  stacy (cool chick whos known me for awhile) said i looked like demi moore coming out of the water with my boogie board.  after that episode i had sand literally embedded in my scalp for a few days.  after that everyone went into the town and we went and had dinner at this cool resteraunt.  my mom has issues walking, she had polio as a child.  so she didnt want to walk the whole way.  mike (who at this point i didnt know very well at all) decided to take a taxi with her to be nice.. so i went along as well.  the taxi driver spoke literally no english.  luckily i know a little bit, so did mike.  the driver wanted to figure out how the hell we knew each other.  were we brother and sister? no.. friends? yes..   is she your girlfriend?  mike didn't know the word for girlfriend so i answered.. he asked him if he thought i was cute.  he was like yeah..  i laughed.  so we waited when we got there and talked.  what do you know he and i end up sitting next to each other.  so my tequila had wore off.. but not fully.. and i ended up having a huge ass margarita.  drank it all.  i ate coconut shrimp (this was before i eliminated seafood from my diet)..it was really freaking good.  had a great time.  found out from amanda who knows of chris that he tried to pick a fight with some guy at a party she was at.  i laughed and felt so good that was behind me.  so we left there and went back to the resort it was everyone sitting around on the beach drinking.  i kept getting margaritas.  then i was drinking jack and coke.  thats what mike was drinking so he kept giving me extra of his.  i think i had 3 or 4 of those.  plus margaritas.  then the they stopped serving everything except beer.  i was really drunk at this point.  i remember specifically not being able to feel my face.  so i had a beer.  i started feeling really sick so i ran out to the lawn chairs littering the beach and proceeded to totally lose all of that shrimp. on the sand.  i buried it when i was done.  i know i puked at least 5 times that night after that.  i thought it was funny.  everyone was like.. ""you shouldn't have switched over to beer""..  i was drunk and didnt care and didnt know.   so they kicked us all out of the area we were sitting and so we all sat on the beach.  i was laying down half passed out, mike didn't want me to pass out.. so he kept tickling my feet.  i was gonna puke again, he stuck his handout as if to help me.. i was like ""you want me to puke on your hand??"".. hehe..  so he helped me up and asked if i wanted him to go get water.  i said yes and puked some more.  he ran away yelling something like, i'll get you water.. but only for you!  only for you!..  i was like ha! he does like me! so he came back with the water.  i felt much better.  everyone started leaving.  (by everyone i mean 6 or 7 of us)  slowly it turned into just me and mike on the beach chair thingys.  we decided we were going to sleep there.  so we slept there.  we were both totally gone.  i remember waking up every now and then and staring at him with my unfocused vision.  i woke him up at like 8 the seagulls woke me up.. it was light out and people were starting to come out to go swimming.  i was still really drunk and so was he.  i told him the seagulls woke me up.  there were ton of them out by the ocean so i decided to go run and chase them.  so i did.  all while yelling ""seagulls!""..   it was really silly and i didnt realize how silly it was until later when i was sober.  so then we both left and i went to bed.  my mom was already up and didnt even ask a question.  probably afraid to.  i slept til about noon.  i got up and felt better but i was still drunk.  i tried to play volleyball that day but i couldn't even serve the ball.  it was pathetic.   
the next day we went whale watching which was incredible.  we saw three or four.  and a ton of dolphins.  it was just me my mom, christine, and amanda.  i hated that part of it.  i hate hanging out with girls.  it sucks.  lets talk about what color we're going to paint our nails.  AHHHHH..  so we got back and i immediately found mike.  we sat at the bar and i had about 3 mudslides.  we talked for maybe 2 hours and then left to go change for the big dinner with everyone that night.   so we all had dinner.  this was my last night so we all stayed up a little while.  it ended up being me and mike again on the beach on the same chairs.  except we werent so drunk this time.  we stayed up talking really late again.  we talked about EVERYthing.  i found it so so easy to talk to him.  which was why i was attracted to him.  he was from minneapolis.  he had an extremely strong northern accent.  we shared the same interests and ideas about things.  it was awesome.  he was 21.  he walked me back to my room.  i got out of the elevator, and the last thing i said to him as the elevator doors were shutting was ""i guess i'll see you another place, another time..""   we both looked at each other with those unfocused drunk stares.  it was so funny.  and then i never saw him again.  i'm sure i will seeing as he's connected to my mom's work.  but who knows.  he was cool.  
so then we went to mexico city to visit von.  which was quite an experience.  von and i went to six flags one day.. it was fun.  mexico city is insane crazy.  so busy.  there were like 5 lane streets.  usually only 2 or 3 feet inbetween cars.  crazy crazy.  i got to meet a lot of cool people there that von knows now.  
so yeah..  thats kind of a run down of things in mexico.  i actually like the fact that i got that drunk there.  that was the coolest place to get drunk.  right by the ocean with a bunch of cool people.  i doubt i'll do that very often, but at least i know my limits and what it feels like."

so anyway, a month went by.. really fast.  next thing i know it's like the end of january.. i'm contemplating the idea of turning 20.  it's depressing me majorly.  i felt totally rejected and i sincerly felt i was going to probably die alone because no one gets anything about me.  i know that's a really stupid thought, but i was depressed.  
so one night i went to borders, as i often do, just bored, alone.  trying to get used to the idea of being alone, totally.  my brother was (and still is) gone.  he lives in mexico now.  we used to be attatched at the hip, so i'm totally new at this alone thing.  which i didn't realize would open up a whole new door.  so this really cute guy is totally gawking at me everywhere i go.  he keeps following me and putting himself in places where he can make eyes at me.  i'm totally wtf'd out..excited too, but weirded out.  for once someone i found attractive actually found me attractive.  so i walked past him at one point, he smiled at me.. so i smiled back.  i didn't think anything would happen.  but about 5 minutes later i'm looking at cd's, and here he comes.  'can i ask you a question?' he asks.  i'm like 'ok'.  'do you have a boyfriend?'.  'nope'.  'cool..do you wanna hang out?'..i'm like..'sure!'.. so i follow him over to his friend he introduces himself and his friend.  he asks how old i am.. he tells me he's 16, he'll be 17 in a couple months.. (ok now it's even more exciting because this is ILLEGAL!) in my head i'm like.. ok it's cool.. it's not like we're going to have sex or anything (don't worry we definetely didn't do that..).  so we go outside and it's freezing.  and i'm just giddy.  by the way he was like your total cliche typical hardcore kid.  nosering, windswept hair, hoodie, etc..  so i'm like.. ugh let's drive this sucks.  so he's like ok!  so we get in his friends suv, and it's me and him in the back.  and we just sit there talking for awhile.  listening to his music (he's all psycho about senses fail..)  we get out and dance in the parking lot.  it was fun.  i exclaim i need a drink.  they point to the beer in the front seat.. i'm like..nooo guys.  so we drive to mcdonalds and go through the drive through they buy my stupid dr. pepper.  he keeps touching me, tickling me etc..  i was surprisingly comfortable physically with him. so we've been hanging out for half an hour now and he scoots real close to me and asks me in a whisper in my ear if he can ask me something.. i'm like.. well yeah go ahead stupid. he's like 'you promise you won't hit me or slap me or something?'   so i promised.. he's all ""can i kiss you?"" whispered in my ear.  i totally melted.   i told him that was really sweet.  so he kissed me on the cheek.  i was all.. aww.  he kept smelling me because i smell like cotton candy.  he kept kissing me on my face.. he went for my neck.. which by the way extremely turns me on.  i was feeling really weird with that because that usually gets me really hot and bothered, and his friend was driving.  so i pushed him away and was like ""ok no.. don't do that.. just don't..  too much..""  so then he finally kissed me on the lips but he tried to french me.. which by the way I HAVE NO IDEA how to do that.  so i totally pulled away and laughed and told him i'd never been properly kissed.  my last boyfriend was a dick and wouldn't kiss me on the face.  so then he's trying to get me to let him teach me.  at that point it's like 8 50.. they have to be home at 9 (yeah don't forget he's 16.. oh jesus i'm bad.)  so he's like.. come on real quick.. i'm feeling really stupid about it at that point.  not to mention self concious about my breath and stupid things like that because my mouth was REALLY dry from nerves.  i told him i wanted to but i didn't want to at the same time.  so he said it was ok.. i didnt have to.  at that point we were almost at my car.  i had only gotten his friends number.  so we said goodbye really fast, he hugged me, told me he hoped he would see me at a show that was coming up.  and i should call.  so i got in my car and he got in his and we left.  
i was totally freaking out.  that was exactly the shock treatment i needed.  i felt totally stupid about my feelings before that.. things were going to be fine.. things can happen and change so quickly.  so quit pouting.  i felt cute again.
i called the next day and left my number.  i called a few times after that and talked to the other guy, but i still haven't ever heard back from him.  oh well.
it was an adventure."

i think i should start where i left off.  i feel like i have no closure on some stuff that has happened since i quit writing in here.  my computer died and i just got a new one thank god.  which would explain my sudden reappearance.
so, chris broke up with me in december.  which by the way, i've never heard from him since. (i hope to god it stays that way..).  i then proceeded to have a really SHITTY christmas.  christmas is usually an extremely depressing time for me anyway, but that's another story.  just after we broke up my computer totally fucked up.  so i had absolutely no internet.  which was horrible might i add.    
in hindsight, that was the most idiotic mistake i've ever made..  how awful i felt with chris.  like all the time.  and i was just so excited at the prospect of something NEW that i overlooked it.  that was an extremely unhealthy relationship.  and i learned a few things about myself that i need to change.  the fact that i'm a total enabler.  everything's ok!  it's ok!.  even if it's not.  it was always ok.  i probably was that way too though because i didnt care enough to put in the effort to make it better because in the back of my mind i knew it wasn't going to last anyway.  
ok this wasn't the point of this entry to analyze that shitty relationship so i'm going to stop now, i already have that issue resolved in my mind.  although i want to add one more point of comparison between chris and pat..  which by the way is retarded as pat wins hands down in every catagory, but it's an interesting observation i thought i should point out for later reference.  chris was constantly trying to be someone, anyone, but himself.  he was in fear of everyone, he had MAJOR issues with letting people get close to him.  and then you have pat.  who is like, totally in your face opposite.  he understands so much more about everything.  fucking what the hell was i thinking?  thinking i could find ANY satisfaction with chris..   pat is totally unafraid of letting people, or at least me, see his vulnerabilities.  which makes him so much stronger.  it's a breath of fresh air for me.  that's for sure.  being with someone who doesn't want to be who they are, totally fucking sucks.  don't ever do it."

i'm so relieved.
i think that pat and i might actually work out now.  i always had major doubts because of the situation..  but it's different now for some reason.  or maybe it's just me.  or maybe now we're supposed 'adults' now..   i don't know.   but it feels good.
his reaction when we talked again for the first time in so long was pleasantly surprising.  i honestly didn't know what to expect.. i wasn't sure if he'd be totally over it or the opposite.  and i guess it was the opposite.  which has been the same for me for quite awhile.  on a daily basis i would think and wonder about him.  i've had a lot of adventures in the past few months.. and i always found myself going back to him in my head at the end of the day.  i was beginning to think i was probably crazy and should just forget about it, it's doubtful he still thinks about me.  but i was wrong.  and i'm glad i was wrong.
it's weird.. because i know i've changed a lot in the past year...  well not changed so much as grown up.  so being where i'm at with him, i feel like we're in a whole new place.  i don't know if he recognizes this, i don't think so, but it's something that i'm aware of with myself.  i'm surprising myself."

i went vegetarian in january.  i'm trying to work my way to vegan.  but these are some of my reasons why:
heart disease begins in childhood.
a vegan diet reverses heart disease.
eating meat and dairy products makes you fat
you shouldn't have to lie to your kids about the food you eat.
in every package of chicken, there's a little poop.
meat is filthy and bloody.
it isn't fair.
no living creature want's to see her family slaughtered.
eating meat and dairy causes impotence.
you wouldn't eat your dog.
mad cow disease is in the us.
it's violence you can stop.
 no one should have to kill for a living.
it takes a small person to beat a defenseless animal, and an even smaller person to eat one.
no animal deserves to die for your tastebuds.
the grain used to feed animals could be used to feed hungry people.
more than half of all water used in the u.s. is uesd to raise animals for food.
they're defenseless.
when animals feel pain, they scream too.
they don't want to die.
they feel fear.
no matter how you slice it, it's still flesh.
commerce is no excuse for murder.
even prisons aren't this crowded.
this is not what wings are for.
everyone wants to be free.
might doesn't make right.


i just like to remind myself.  maybe this will make someone else think."

hooray!  i got dumped!
it's the story of my life.   
should've seen it coming.  the king of schlock and schmooze he was.  
it's too bad too.. things started out so sweetly.  now i haven't heard from him since we broke up, almost a month ago.  crazy.   not even a call during the holidays.  kind of shocking actually.
i'm beginning to wonder wether or not i will die alone.  pat was the closest, yet farthest, thing i've had.  i don't know what to do.  
is it weird that we never kissed, yet he got me off, yet wouldn't let me see him naked, OR touch him?    maybe he's gay.    i dunno.
von's coming home for vacation on the 15th.   
john's coming back within the week.  i've missed john, sincerely.  maybe i should go out with him."

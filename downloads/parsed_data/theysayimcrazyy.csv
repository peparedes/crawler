wow i never really thought about it until now... like so much has happened to me this past year...Ive grown a lot and Ive dont a lot of stupid shit...my parents even got more harsh on me...potts died...winter formal '04 haha... and so much shit...


im so excited that im turning 16....only 2 years and im out...well at least i hope...im hoping my parents will let go by then! :-)

god knows i love them to death and longer, but im suffocating... you can't have your cake and it eat too lol
i miss my mawmaw a lot...nobody understands how close i was to her i was always her 'little girl'... and now im cryingg...


god im such a pussy lmaoo






...and now i feel lonely cause i haven't liked someone in at least a year...i dont know what the hells wrong with me...i guess something jsut tells me to not like anyone cause i'll eventually end up getting hurt just like the last assholee that i liked...


i havent been singing as much as i should...its just cause there is nothing to sing for...i sing for myself, and only myself...and maybe my friends...but like i never find out about any competitions and/or anything of that sort...i just sing...i am probly never ever gonna get to record in my life, even if i could pay for it...it wouldnt make a difference


i havent written in a long time too...i should cause i get these urges to write and the words just flow out like a freaking river...


i really need to make good grades this next year... not just for colleges, but for myself and my parents...

im gonna straighten up a lot this next year...i need to, i fucked around too much...not as much as other people but they always get away with it...i don't...



i know this is gonna be gay cause people read this, but this is MY journal and i can say w/e i want in it...but god i just wanna say how much i love music...it puts me in these moods...like its my get away and its like a therapy and gets me away from everything.....i think i might wanna be a song writer when i get older, too...


i havent prayed since school ended...i knoww its horrible...but, it seems like things get better when i dont pray to Jesus and that's the truth...

















But you can't jump the track, we're like cars on a cable,
And life's like an hourglass, glued to the table
No one can find the rewind button girl
so cradle your head in your hands
Sing it if you understand.
and breathe, just breathe"

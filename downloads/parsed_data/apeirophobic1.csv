"event","i think ive come to realize that the things that make you grow quickly are often the things that make you look like a real idiot.&nbsp; i realized a&nbsp;lot of things this weekend, and i hurt a lot of people on the way.&nbsp; even though i can never get some of those things back, i still came out ahead.&nbsp; i need to work on my stress management.&nbsp; i realized bottling it up isnt the way to go unless you want to end up by yourself.&nbsp; i was so anti drama... i would avoid it and try to forget about it.&nbsp; i found out that eventually that turns you into the drama.&nbsp; i found out that people are going to believe the worst in you even if theyre your best friend.&nbsp; i realized that even though people pretend to care they dont, and the can still do a damn good job of pretending.&nbsp; i also learned that the people that you think dont care really do and they can surprise you.&nbsp; like after you scream at them and put them through hell theyre still concerned enough to take care of you until 5 in the morning.&nbsp; i learned that really family is not replaceable by friends, and that real family will answer their phones at 6 in the morning to listen to you cry.&nbsp; nothing can replace that.&nbsp; i learned that self respect is easily lost and not easily returned.&nbsp; i now know that people have thier own hidden agendas, and they dont care that it could hurt you in the end.&nbsp; i was lucky for the fact that i didnt end up getting hurt by what happened, but i still realized it nonetheless.&nbsp; i learned that i should drink when im upset.&nbsp; i learned that if you want something you cant settle for only part of it.. its all or nothing.&nbsp; i havent been able to really get that through in my actions, but maybe writing it down will help.&nbsp; i learned that everybody has limits, and four nights in a row was about 3 nights passed mine.&nbsp; your friends will never cease to amaze you, whether it be good or bad.&nbsp; i found that i need to stand up for what i want instead of trying to make other people happy all the time.&nbsp; that builds up too.&nbsp; ive gained the ability to tell people to fuck off, which is a major step for me.&nbsp; now i just need to work on saying it without actually saying ""fuck off."" but ill just take that a little at a time.&nbsp; i realized that true friends are going to wait out your phases and be there for you when you realize you went down the wrong path.&nbsp; i realized i depend a lot on my girls, and that we've all grown a lot since the dorms.&nbsp; theyre amazing.&nbsp; i realize that sometimes you have to let the things you want most go.&nbsp; no matter how much you want it, if its unattainable, youre never going&nbsp;to be satisfied.&nbsp; and that sucks a lot.&nbsp; more than i ever knew.&nbsp; theres so much more that i want to get out but i dont know how at the moment.. i still need to marinate on it.... sorry none of this made sense, or that i didnt even attempt to put it in a logical order..."

"event","Dim just in one of those moods... today i was driving, and those of you who know me best know that i think&nbsp; a lot when i drive.&nbsp; i really wish that i could read peoples thoughts.&nbsp; i feel like the biggest bother to a lot of people, so i want to back off, but im not much of an alone type person any more.&nbsp; i cant be okay by myself.&nbsp; so i know that it would probably hurt to hear what people are thinking, but at least id know.&nbsp; and i could react.&nbsp; i could protect myself.&nbsp; im getting to the point where ive worried so much about making other people happy that now its almost too late for me.&nbsp; im entirely happy with things right now, but the way ive brought it on means that i could lose it all in a second.&nbsp; its almost inevitable;&nbsp; but im going to be blind sided by it.&nbsp; im afraid that when i go to china with no contact back here for three weeks that ill be forgotten by a few people.&nbsp; i just have to keep telling myself that those are the people who didnt mean much in my life anyway.&nbsp; i could never forget someone after three weeks, but most people leave an impact on me whether its good or bad.. and i cant just get rid of that.&nbsp; i hate to think that ive made myself so disposable, but thats what ive set up for myself.&nbsp; i guess i screwed myself over in that respect.&nbsp; i really have no clue what im saying or if it makes sense.. im just trying to make sense of everything in my head.&nbsp; i guess it helped though.. i figured out what is bothering me.&nbsp; i really do feel disposable..&nbsp;

on another note, i have a chance to change that.&nbsp; but im too big of a wuss that i dont know if im going to be able to.. i have about 1 hour and 20 minutes to get it done on tuesday.. will i be able to???&nbsp; my roommate said i might as well.. shes right too.&nbsp; well see :-)

i dont know what else to put right now..."

"event","<p>I just spent my spring break in Waveland and Bay St. Louis Mississippi helping out with Katrina relief, which was pretty much ground zero for the storm. </p>
<p>It was amazing. The first morning when I woke up and saw the debris, I was like wow, this is bad. We went on a tour of the towns and I can't even begin to explain what I saw. Over the next two days the scenery became normal-- chairs in trees, foundations with no homes, cars that had been smashed almost beyond recognition. And that surprised me a lot. I couldn't understand why already that had just become the norm. I realized on Thursday that it was because I didn't truly understand what had happened. I was looking at everything like I did on the t.v. at home. Someone had made the comment that to people in the north Katrina was kind of like a dream. It never really happened. And that was true- that's exactly what I had felt before going down there. I had the opportunity to go out with some of the people in my group to do work for a group called Citizens in Action. They were making cases for people who had been denied demolition from FEMA-- that means that FEMA went and took a picture of the house and based on that one shot decided that the house wasn't destroyed enough to be demplished by the government. They would have to pay for it. So we went out to some of these houses and took some shots, and two of the guys were taking notes to make these cases. I visited a house where it looked like someone parked a house in another houses front yard. It had been taken off the foundation and swept away, stopped by the other house that was standing there. There were children's shoes scattered in the front yard. Toys were everywhere. The clothes were still in the closets. What used to be pictures were on the ground, the ink almost entirely gone. Furniture was all over the place, smashed. There was mold all over everything. The children's shoes and clothes and toys and coloring books really got to me. I think that's when I finally understood how bad this actually was. How many innocent people it hurt. You can't understand it by watching the stories on t.v..&nbsp;<br /><br />I heard another story from a man named Ray that I was working with. He said his friend owned 26 horses, and when he had gotten back, only 2 had survived. He said that the horses were in the barns, and that one had tried to escape as the water level rose. It got stuck in the rafters trying to get out of the door, and it drowned. When he had gotten back, the horse was still stuck up there. I heard stories about cows being stuck in trees. A woman I worked with told me that they had lived in tents right after the storm, and she had her daughter and 9 month old granchild with her. Rats were attracted to the smell of the milk, and they would get inside the tent. These rats were the size of dogs. Now almost everone is living in FEMA trailors, which are incredibly small. They are horribly built and have a tendancy to mold. A woman is living in a three person trailor with her 6 children.&nbsp;<br /><br />FEMA is getting this positive rep up here, but down there it's a completely different story. They aren't doing what they said they'd do. I mean, they're helping, but no where near what they told these people. The insurance companies are insane. Even those who had hurricane insurance are being denied because the companies claim that it was flooding that ruined the house, or that it was wind. It's incredible what those companies are doing. I can't believe how hard they are. You meet everyone and wonder why this happened to them. They are amazing people. And they can't even get the help that they paid for.<br /><br />None of the religious statues were broken during the hurricane. You'd drive around and see the Virgin Mary standing there, unharmed...&nbsp;<br /><br />I was watching the Food Network today, as I usually do, and Emeril was doing a show about the affect of Katrina on Mew Orleans, and he did a bit about Mississippi. For the first time, I actually cried when I watched a show about Katrina. It didn't affect me before, but now it does. I couldn't help but cry a little. It's no longer like a dream to me, like it never really happened. It's real in every way. I've heard peoples stories. I've cleaned up the debris, replanted trees, and helped out a dry cleaners that was overwhelmed because people don't have washers and dryers (I have a new appreciation for what goes on behind the scenes&nbsp;at the&nbsp;dry cleaners). I've seen the houses. It's very real. <br /><br />I thought of Bob a lot because I know he could helpt down there. He loves building&nbsp;things, and there is so much opportunity down there right now. You can volunteer and make so many connections. I also thought about Cyndi.&nbsp;Ray was rebuilding his son's restaurant, and they had to set up the kitchen and everything. Once again, you can volunteer down there and make so many connections.&nbsp;Everyone I worked with was so incredibly grateful, and they expressed it every chance they got.&nbsp;One of our guys&nbsp;was waved through the line at the pizza joint just because the manager knew what he was doing. They need help from so many&nbsp;different areas; anyone could go down to help and find themself&nbsp;hooked. I didn't want to leave. They're so desperate for workers because of the psycho unemployment that the government is giving-- people make as much staying home now as they did&nbsp;working&nbsp;before the storm, so there's no incentive to get a job. Cyndi&nbsp;could easily find a job as a chef. And it's only an hour away from&nbsp;New Orleans. That&nbsp;spells out opportunity... <br />&nbsp;<br />I rode my first horse when I was down there :-) Ray owned a couple, and he let Audrey and I ride for a while. It took off at one point and I got freaked out beyond belief, but I think it's something I could get used to. I even stood up on the saddle! I loved it. And I got to spend a lot of time with one of my future brothers. And I spent a lot of time with on of my brothers and learned soooo much about him. Mwahaha. He got us lost for a little while on our way back home, and we ended up driving to the Jim Beam plant. Pure coincidence. How amazing is that?? I also got to hear him sing karaoke. A little bit of Shaniah's ""Man I Feel Like a Woman."" So amazing... And I got to go to Bourbon St. in New Orleans. Now THAT was amazing. I think... I don't really remember. *wink wink* One of the guys I was with made the singer at the Sing Sing sing to me, and he said ""Wanna feel my guitar, baby? It's hard.."" I think my face was beyond bright red. So I rode my first horse, went to my first American bar, and ate at Sonic for the first time. I used to only get Cherry Vanilla Cokes because my ex got me hooked... Now I'm hooked again but I don't have anywhere to get them :-( I've never spent so much effort looking for a Chili's. I never knew that a certain someone knew the dance to Bye Bye Bye... haha...&nbsp;<br /><br />I learned so much this week about myself, about my brothers, and about what really happened. It was incredible. I can't even explain it. When it came time to leave, I didn't want to go. I wanted to stay and keep helping in any way I could. I fell in love with Waveland and Bay St. Louis. I can't wait to go back. I wouldn't trade this experience for the world. </p>"

I missed Sunday so I decided to make it up yesterday by running 6 instead of my usual 3. I started off the week fresh, but now I'm even more exhausted than I was last week and it's only Tuesday.<br />I think I'm missing the drama gene in my body. It seems like people make bigger deals out of things that I don't think anything about. I get sick of them coming up to me being like what's this all about when there's no THIS to begin with.

"event","<P><FONT color=#999999>ive been thinking way too much again, but for some reason im still not in my funk. in light of recent events, i think sometimes i dont have the ability to understand the full consequences of my actions-- the impacts on others. i now realize that something that i have done may not be something that other people would want to do, and that has some serious consequences. i think i have become hardened after what i found out last semester, and it rationalizes my actions. i dont feel remorse, and i dont feel regret, but maybe i should. i dont think i know how in this case. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#999999>i have also realized that we all react differently to certain situations. what seems like a normal reaction for one person can be the most unnatural resonse for somebody else. the only thing we can do it support each other in their thoughts/reactions/feelings and hope that we can learn to grasp the good from everything that comes our way. sorry, that was random. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#999999>in other news cyndi stopped by with shelby and we put her in her pink popped collar polo! she walked sideways for a little bit and seemed kind of frightened, but then she got used to it. she also chased her tail for a good little while and chased the flashlight beam on the floor like CRAZY. that dogs QUICK. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#999999>i made homemade beef and noodles. i accidentally forgot i changed the salt from sprinkle thingy to pout thingy, so it got a little salty, but its still wonderful. its good to know im getting a based for my future when i cant eat dorm food with the tera-squad any more. why is it that my grandma, my mom, my sister, and all of their friends know how to cook EVERYTHING, and i dont? i got shafted. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#999999>this is the first night that i havent done my homework... uh oh. hopefully not forshadowing the rest of my semester. </P>

"event","<P><FONT color=#3366ff>Okay guys, im officially out of my funk! It lasted a looooong time. Like from the beginning of christmas break until last week. But its finally over.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#3366ff>Im studious again. I did all of my homework thats dues tomorrow AND read for my accounting class that isnt even until tuesday. im so good. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#3366ff>this past week was crazy... not with school, but with my social life. i drank too much, first off. this is the second time ive drank on a school night that i can remember. last night ended with a puking session too. i had mean words with one of my best friends, and it made me really sad. i dont know what id do without her, but i was just cranky and she was in my path. plus i got my foot smashed by some drunk dude right before it. that didnt help. theres a big bruise :-(&nbsp; i started hanging out with a couple new people. CRAZY for me. i dont usually jump out of my comfort zone on my own will. i think thats what brought me out of the funk though. i just needed to change it up a lil bit. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#3366ff>so after that.. i came to realize that people look at me as a huge partier. my dad always asks me if i want a beer, or if i want some wine. other people here look at me like im a crazy wild party girl. and im so NOT. it happens on rare occasions. this past weekend was very rare. i havent been like that in a long time, and i wont again. it was just time to get it out of my system. but i need to change the way i talk because i do talk like i drink every day of my life. half the time when i go out TO drink i dont even end up doin it. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#3366ff>ive also come to realize that i now have a huge group of people looking out for me, which i love. back to the party talk-- someone even brought me a coat when i was getting rid of some alcohol outside. and they took my keys even though i was extremely forcefully persistent about driving my car home. and when i needed help on my stats homework people actually sat down and looked at it with me. the amazing catherine was the first to figure it out! anyway, my point is that i love this new support system/social circle/ all that stuff. </FONT></P>

"event","<P>i cant wait to not be sick any more. there are two absolute worst parts. 1) rubbing your nose raw with kleenex until it bleeds and gets all dried out and 2) not being able to sing. i was driving home from indy a little bit ago, and i just didnt sound pretty. one time my friend told me that singing didnt always have to be prefect-- thats not what its about. its about having fun and expressing yourself. i think she was a crazy bitch, because i like sounding pretty. and right now i dont. </P>
<P>is it possible to know you could be very happy with someone but not want to be with them at the same time? i know i could be very happy with someone. but i also know that im not ready. i want someone around, but i dont want something so intense. I JUST WANT TO HAVE FUN right now. i think i want a steady date guy. thats all.. nothing serious, nothing binding. but i also want to be beautiful again. whenever id go out with the girls last semester, the guys would always check them out and theyd flirt. they're ""hot"" and i was always jealous because i wanted to be hot... but all i ever got was ""beautiful."" beautiful doesnt find a guy to flirt with at a party. but then all of the sudden this semester i got the first ""youre hot"" (he must have been f-in crazy i decided) ive ever heard in my life. and i liked it. but it also made me realize that i miss beautiful. theres so much more that goes along with it. its more than the way you appear. i want to be beautiful again, but i lost something over the course of this year. i think ive had to deal with too much. </P>
<P>i feel disgusted. and i feel disgusting. and i know its not my fault, and i dont even know if IT is really there. i dont know if IT exists anywhere but in my head. but i still think about it every day. it still makes me cry almost every day. i try to keep myself busy, but sometimes my thoughts wander and i cant help it. i think i sing in the car to keep my mind busy. ive had my whole life to deal with it, but i never knew. i still dont. i dont know that i ever will. but i dont think i can be beautiful any more. </P>
<P>random thoughts because i cant put anything else together right now...</P>
<UL>
<LI>i love my sister.</LI>
<LI>i miss not wondering.</LI>
<LI>i miss being beautiful.</LI>
<LI>i wish love worked like it does in the movies.</LI>
<LI>i wish guys worked like they did in the movies.</LI>
<LI>i wish i could be the object of affection and have a guy spill his heart to me like they do in the movies ;-)</LI>
<LI>i dont know what i would do without penny.</LI>
<LI>i miss being in love but i wouldnt be ready for it if it hit me in the face.</LI>
<LI>i miss not forcing myself to laugh.</LI>
<LI>even though it doesnt mean anything since i havent started my major yet, being a junior freaks me out. A LOT. how could this happen so soon?</LI>
<LI>im sick of fretting about money even though i have plenty.</LI>
<LI>im sick of people criticizing me because i have that money.</LI>
<LI>im sick of people criticizing me because i worry about the money that i spend. </LI>
<LI>i miss having a pet. i miss squire and lily tremendously.</LI>
<LI>i'm happy for scott, who's already made an awesome life for himself fresh out of college. </LI>
<LI>i love the food network.</LI>
<LI>i get easily addicted to shows like americas next top model and wife swap. </LI></UL>
<P>i had a good weekend, if you discount the fact that i abandoned all of my self respect and rules and morals. okay not all, just one. but i cant even explain how disappointed i am in myself. but i had a gilmore girls marathon with jackie and penn. we painted our toes too. it was about the most perfect friday night ever. :-) then ""you know who"" came to town. we went through the car wash, went to the mall, and had blizzards at DQ. watched some tv. today, more tv and cheeseburger in paradise. those burgers are flippin HUGE. those portion sizes are ridiculous. and i finally bought drain-o! months after the necessity arose... then i headed to indy and had dinner with the sco-tizzle. caught up on each others lives, watched jersey girl (haha) and headed home, where i couldnt sing. boo. the gilmore girls marathon, even though i only lasted&nbsp;four or five shows, was the major highlight. i love my girls, and i was glad it didnt involve gettin prettified and dancing, drinking, etc. we wore pj's and painted toes. YAY!</P>
<P>okay so im glad that got a little more lighthearted than it was in the beginning. i hope you all understand that im not crazy, psycho, depressed, whatever. im normal. ive got worries, but its all good. im all good. because I LOVE ME. and no, im not drunk either. i just took a lesson from a good friend.</P>
<P>i saw a singer on tv today named todd a.... any ideas on what the last name is? i really liked the sound... id like to find out. </P>"

<P><FONT color=#cc66cc>i managed to run every day! it felt really good, since i kind of quit over the entire rest of break. its amazing how quickly you lose muscle.. yikes. but im back on the right track! i also met some strawberry farmers when we were eating dinner at a local pizza place. they were in town for a strawberry convention: a day of meetings, a field trip day where they traveled around GA to all the strawberry farms, and then more meetings. did you know there were over 170 different kinds of strawberries?! but how random that we met them... i love the sponteneity of savannah. its crazy, but i feel at home when im out there. not like in muncie, where everything is set and dry. you never know WHATS going to happen when youre there, and ive missed those 3 months that i lived there ever since i left. im pretty sure that ill live there for real some day...</FONT></P>

"event","<P>i finally have a little bit of time to sit at the computer!!!</P>
<P>okay, so when i was at my grandparents i had PLENTY of time to sit at a computer, but i never see my family, so i decided not to go there. but the past week really has been eventful..</P>
<P>on my way to grand rapids i found out the true meaning of lake effect snow... it was all rainy outside for the first 2 hours, so i really didnt think much of it by that point, but then in the course of like 2 seconds it started snowing and BAM-- ice. and we were on the highway which is marked 70 mph, so of course i was going 80. so i hit the ice going 80. needless to say my car did a circle and a half. my sister and i could have sworn there were a billion cars around us before it happened, but then all of the sudden there was NOBODY. so i was lucky and just spun over empty road. the whole time i was thinking DONT GO IN THE DITCH DONT GO IN THE DITCH! and miraculously i didnt go in the ditch. people say you always think of your life before you potentially get seriously injured, but that was all i could think. im glad i didnt die... i would hate for that to have been my last thought. but i dont want to do any more 80 mph car ice skating any time soon. i kept driving after that and within the next quarter mile 5 other cars all were off the road. the dummies apparently didnt know to turn into the cirlce.. but this one car actually slammed into the other side of the ditch. i felt pretty bad for all these people because it was christmas morning and they were all waiting for tow trucks... </P>
<P>my grandparents house wasnt too eventful, but i got to see my little cousins whove gotten SO big. robby is an emerging comedian... or not. he might actually just be a little crazy. for example: why did the strawberry eat the strawberry pie? to save the strawberries! why did the ice cream scream? because he was getting eaten... by the ice cream!!! yeah. hes 7, so i think its okay... </P>
<P>while we were there i found out some bad news. i found out that my moms been in the emergency room for a heart problem where it speeds up really fast to where you can actually see her heart beating in her chest and then she goes comatose-- she get out of her chair or move or anything... she wore a heart monitor all day yesterday... but it pisses me off because SHE STILL HASNT TOLD ME ABOUT IT. its been 7 weeks since this started happening. 7 WEEKS. i found out from my stepdad when my sister and i went for a walk monday evening. she talked to cyndi on their drive home, so she knows. and dan told my mom that he told me, so she knows that i know. she just wont talk to me about it. </P>
<P>then i went to visit my ladies in goshen. tera has the CUTEST puppy of all time. besides maybe shelby sue, but it may be a tie. i got to spend the evening with katie, whos leaving for austria soon! omg im so jealous... i do have china coming up though. then penn and i went shopping... i spent waaaaaaay more money than i should have, but i havent really done any excess spending since the very beginning of the semester, so i kinda did need some new clothes. bye bye $350. </P>
<P>and i saw the beautiful catherine. and the flappy video. hahahaha! shes lucky i like her, or id make fun of her a lot more about it. and one of her cats is scary... im glad mine are friendly. that one so didnt want to go to the vet...</P>
<P>so i got back thursday afternoon and headed (where else) to the gym. and i got to have dinner with dan! and jamie was our server, and she got me even more excited about china because shes been there and was telling me about it. YAY. then adam came up. we went to walk the line. EXCELLENT movie. and johnnys so studly... the night ended with me being a big dumb girl, nothing about him, just me in general. ive had a few hard things going on lately and i finally couldnt stand it any more and dumped it all on him. it took like 2 minutes, but it was good to have someone else know... besides cyndi because i think she knows everything. shes cool like that. but anyway, i may seem more like a crazy girl, but at least he knows whats up with me and maybe that ""it"" is not his fault ;-) haha. i saw king kong today with the rents. people kept telling me it was way too long and boring, but i liked it. it didnt seem like 3 hours to me, and i dont think i was ever bored. her juggling was so fake though. and the ape size wasnt always on the same scale. that kind of bothered me. </P>
<P>that was my exciting week... im glad i got to see all of my friends and my sister :-) they make my world go round!</P>"

"event","<P>another good day i suppose. i did way too many loads of laundry, as i always do. for some reason, ill never learn that if i do my laundry as i go instead of waiting until theres nothing left to wear, it would be sooo much simpler. </P>
<P>i saw lauren for the first time today since high school! we were just lazy and watched a movie, but still. shes one of the sweetest people ever :-) hopefully next semester well get to hang out more...</P>
<P>i have to get up at 6am tomorrow for the family christmas. ill be driving by 7... yikes. hopefully the next few days will slide by smoothly. my grandma and i have a lot of conflicting opinions... ha. and then i get to see all my girls! i dont now how long ill be gone, but i know i wont be missed in muncie. theres no one IN muncie. </P>
<P>i tried to burn a christmas cd for tomorrow mornings drive, but i forgot to clean the back of it, so half of the songs went on and the other half didnt. and that was my last blank cd. what a bummer. </P>
<P>on top of that i have a sore throat. luckily nothing major-- i have the best immune system in the world (knock on wood) and i havent really been sick in years (knock on wood again). so far this sore throat really doesnt count as sick. its just a little bit uncomfortable. good thing im tough... </P>
<P>have you ever listened to a song and been like WHOA thats so my life right now? ive been doing that a lot lately. i think ive got so much going on and so many conflicting thoughts in my head that everything applies to me.&nbsp; ugh i dont like it. </P>
<P>im freakin out because i wont be working out for like a week. i think i have so issues... haha. maybe itll be good for me...? is that possible? </P>
<P>ive only been up for 13 hours and im EXHAUSTED. i wish my last load of laudry would dry so that i could go to bed. boo laundry :-(</P>

arent i just the most interesting person ever?"

"event","<P>i just did 8 hours of baking. everything looks great, but man... im TIRED. its ridiculous. i never want to see sugar again. i hope my family likes it. </P>
<P>an ex called me today (why is it always the ex's and never people i want to hear from?), and even though im single, i didnt pick up. more improvment for me :-) im no longer relying on other people to make me feel needed? valuable? important? i dont know the right word, but its a good feeling. </P>
<P>i wish someone was there to back up my decision about my current situation. i cant wait for everyone to be in muncie so that i can talk to people again. i miss everyone! and i feel like i suck a lot right now. and that im a big fat retard for dismissing something that blatantly stared me in the face with dumb excuses. they say love is blind, but im pretty sure like is even blinder. i suck.</P>
<P>on the up-side, i CANT WAIT to see all of my girls! we're going sledding! and ill get to spend a couple days with them testosterone free, which is always awesome. and then i get to see catherine, so you all should be jealous... i get to visit the most amazing friends ever!</P>
<P>i cant believe its christmas eve.. the season hasnt completely hit me yet. and i cant believe tomorrow is christmas. oh my!</P>

"event","<P>i dont know why i started this up really. probably because my sister told me that i had to. and sometimes i think its good to just sit down and write... feel free to talk back to me. </P>
<P>this semester has been a really trying time for me. ive learned a lot about relationships; not just boyfriends, but friends and family too. the whole semester started off with a breakup, but i think it was good because i did something for me and reevaluated what i needed. and it worked almost the entire semester, but now i have to reevaluate again. i know we all have to make sacrifices for the people we hold close to our hearts, but there has to be a limit. i can only give so much, and even though my heart is telling me to keep giving and keep giving because maybe things will change, my head knows that other people arent so self sacrificing. i also tried to be a user, but it only lasted about a day and then&nbsp;i never wanted to do it again. </P>
<P>and then there are the people who seem self sacrificing, but it turns out that theyre just using you. yeah i got caught up with one of those people this semester. im actually putting a couple people under here because i dont really know how to classify them. and from them i realized that you cant expect someone to be your boyfriend if you treat them as one and give them no reason to be anything more because you already give them everything. i started reading 'hes just not that into you' and i have to admit that it makes more sense to me than anything about men ever before. RELATIONSHIPS ARE SUPPOSED TO MAKE YOU HAPPY, NOT SAD. its so obvious, but why the hell doesnt anyone ever think of it? if everythings so full of tears and disappointment, why would you put yourself through it? theres someone out there who's going to make you feel like the most beautiful person in the world, and theyre going to want to spend time with you and talk to you. that person is going to make you HAPPIER not sad. they&nbsp;wont make you question yourself or their intentions. you wont have to wonder what they really want from you or whether hes the one you should be with right now. i still havent quite come to terms with the realization, but im working on it. it kind of hurts.&nbsp;you think you find someone great, and they may be amazing, but there are certain things that you just&nbsp;shouldnt compromise. back to people being users... dont believe someone just because of their actions or kind eyes. if theyre good, theyll be able to prove it to you without trying. dont&nbsp;fall victim to&nbsp;the assholes. and if you do, dont pay attention to it in the end because they arent worth giving a second thought to. luckily my friends helped me out with that one, and they all think&nbsp;hes a fuckin asshole too. i love my friends :-)&nbsp;</P>
<P>i learned this semester that drunken conversations can lead to the best relationships ever. things have never been better with my sister. i know theres still potential for development, but right now i love it. and the boozin made me very open, and it was one of the scariest conversations in my entire life that haunts me every day, but she knows and i know and we'll make it through. we're gonna be okay. i just wish i KNEW. but i cant ask. i might never get over it. im in a hard spot and the only way to get out is to risk my entire childhood. thank you to my sister because&nbsp;shes dealt with this for so much longer without me,&nbsp;and to friend that ive started to wish was my sister because she listened to me for a looong time even though there was nothing she could do... it means a lot. </P>
<P>cyndi and i had our christmas yesterday! even better than the presents i got to spend the evening with her and go shopping and all that... i love it! i found the puppy ive been looking for all of my life... too bad her 3 pound butt was worth $600. maybe when i grow up and become rich.. im jealous of cyndis puppy, but if i had that little chi-a-rat shed be jealous of me. hehe :-) but i did get the cutest unders and pj bottoms and hot chocolate bubble bath from bath and body works, which combines my two biggest loves: hot chocolate and steaming hot candlelit baths... *sigh*</P>
<P>i suppose im done for now... </P>"

<i>""And The Dragon seperated the virtuous from<br>the sinful.  He tore his eyes from his sockets<br>and used them to peer into the souls of those<br>on trial to make a judgement.  He knew that<br>with endless knowledge came endless<br>responsibility.""</i>

Some examples of the Dragon Form are Athena<br>(Greek), St. Peter (Christian), and Surya<br>(Indian).
The Dragon is associated with the concept of<br>intelligence, the number 5, and the element of<br>wood.
His sign is the crescent moon.

As a member of Form 5, you are an intelligent and<br>wise individual.  You weigh options by looking<br>at how logical they are and you know that while<br>there may not always be a right or wrong<br>choice, there is always a logical one.  People<br>may say you are too indecisive, but it's only<br>because you want to do what's right.  Dragons<br>are the best friends to have because they're<br>willing to learn.

Anyhow,  I said I was an assistant Underwriter.  I've found the past few weeks that it is much like being a lawyer in terms of scum.  It really isn't though, rest assured.

  So far I've gotten them with ""Art of Noise"" (Paranomia), ""Tommy James and the Shondels"" (Crimson and Clover).  I plan on Duran Duran, Adam Ant, Murrey Head (One night in Bankock), Love and Rockets, Berlin, Visage, ""Krush Groove"" soundtrack, Eddie Grant ""Electric Avenue"".

What kinda of self-riteous, ego-manical asshole would actually worry about becomeing 19?  It seemed old at the time.  I can't imagine.  
This too, will seem like a waste of time.  After this all birthdays will pass like undigested corn.  Which is fine.  My 21st was great, my 22nd was aweful, my 23 was my first in Cali.  I got a drumstick from a Ratt cover band and some asshole used my birthday as an excuse to find out if he was gay (we spent it at RAGE on Santa Monica blvd).  His wife was out of town and he wanted to have sex with a guy to make sure he should leave her (I ended up slamming tequila with my friend Jacki).  My 24th was great...Max, Bob and I went to Medievil Times (my knight won!).  We'll see about good 'ol number 25. So far it's been great. Max bought me an amp for my bass since I coudn't afford one for the past few years.  That is better than you can imagine...plus he took me out to Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles...excellant!  I work of course...what person doesn't (except my mum...her b-day is on July 4th).

"event","I've come to the conclusion this morning that I love California.  I love California and I love LA on a Saturday.  I never would have imagined I'd say that.  Growing up I had no notion of ever coming here.  When I first moved here I found myself astonished at the fact I really took to it(LA), but then wasn't so sure.
About 11pm last night I was doing my usual Friday night ritual.  On my computer, drinking.  I was ""talking"" to my friend Matt via IM.  He suggested I come over.  Usually I really don't like to think about having to drive down to Hollywood, but I said, fuck it and went.  I had a really great time.  I got up around 9am (just crashed their folks...no funny business).  Anyway, I was driving and realized how much I love driving around Hollywood when it's still asleep (nothing opens till noon it seems).  I love being that close to my friends, I love the smells and streets and the limitless amount of things to do and see. I realized I do still dream of having a Hollywood bungalow, like Jim Morrison I guess. I miss it, I really do.  That is, until I got on the freeway to drive home and clipped along at a steady pace of 5 miles an hour.  Forget it.  I still love California.  
  Yes, Hollywood is a place of broken dreams, some of them mine.  By my own choice and design however, not the city's fault.  I'm still awe struck by it.  It's something I thought had worn off, but it still pumps hard in my viens."

So, I went up to Palomar Mt. to volunteer at the restaurant there.  The yoga center has their retreats up there and the ""devotees"" live up there and run the store and restaurant on top of the mountain.  It may be the most beautiful place I've seen in a long while.
As for the work it was great.  Good, hard work in the kitchen.  I felt accomplished.
When I got back I spent some incredible time with Max.  We had a good talk.  That is to say, well...I don't really want to explain it.  I just feel alot better about the whole situation.

"event","I moved to LA about 2 years ago.  In that time I've been through all the cliche bullshit that goes along with it (especially in the film industry).  It's all like you'd think...parties with free coke, seeing a dead body on Sunset, backstabbing, ""nice"" people telling you they are going to help you out but don't, mindless conversations about fashion with dim-witted twits (my main objective is bring down Fred Segal as you might know).  What the fucking purpose?  So you can be involved in some piece of shit film that's going to not only amount to nothing, but cost your more for participating in. I'm not speaking of your college project films mind you.  But at the same token, I am, also, speaking of ""independant"" pictures (some, not all)as well.  
 I guess my reason in saying anything at all (I generally don't aire anything on the LJ) is that I went out with Max (my ex that you may see on my backdated entries) and my old roomate (after I lost my apartment...thank, again, to the film industry).  I was celebrating the fact that I got a promotion.  
  I've been looking back on my entries.  I see days that my relationship was intact, I see my layoff, I see me losing my apartment, a break in, and the end of a very important realtionship. Everything happens for a damn good reason and there should be no regrets.  In turn, you realize who your comrads are.  It makes me realize that, I've followed my dream...it didn't turn out, but there are many new avenues. That's not a cop out. 
  My intention is not to bring down anyone, quite the opposite.  I guess my point is that the friends I have now have been there since college or longer and I really appreciate them.  I've been feeling quite sorry for myself, but for no damn reason.
  Just take one moment and think of the quality of your interpersonal realtionships and what they mean to you.  
  Everything seems rather empty, but there is so much more I wish to say.  Anyway, good luck to you."

Been keeping very busy though and it's giving me a damn good outlook.  I hung out with <lj user=""cuchulainn"">,  <lj user=""jenniferlwhite"">, and <lj user=""zenithberwyn""> last night.  Made me feel extrodinarily better.  Fantastic people they are.  
The yoga helps as well.  I HIGHLY recommend this.

Tonight I'm going to help a friend out with something that sounds particularly intersting.  I shall report on it later.  
I do need to get my own place though and that's on my back.  I really can't handle sleeping in the same room with my ex (especially when he never came home last night).  It turned out it wasn't what I thought, but I didn't sleep, literally, 1 minute all night.

I have kinda alot on my mind lately...mostly due to my ""relationship"".  Don't really want to talk about it though, other then the fact it's going/gone down the tubes (I guess).  I can't really even think about that right now.  That's when the job comes in handy...always busy.  Although today I was on hold on the phone for a while and that was pretty much the end of my stable mood for the day.
This is kinda interesting to me.  I really didn't know how to handle my feelings.  I mean, I wanted to get away, but you can't.  I just had this awful, I guess...emptiness and this strange feeling in the middle of my stomach (solar plexus for those of you that know that sort of thing.  Everything was just numb.  I wasn't crying but tears were streaming from my eyes.  I just wished for something to give me some kind of solitude.  The point is I had this dream...
the jist of the dream is that there was this boy (no one I know, but very vivid). So I was sitting there sharing quick glances, he came over and started talking to me.  After a while, he put his head on my neck.  No kissing or anything like that, but the feeling was one I had forgotten.  The feeling of someone you really like finally making the first move, and innocent move.  Just that gushing (to sound like a damn 15 yr old).  Everytime I had a dream about anyone else other then my boyfriend nothing happened , if the slightest thing happened in my dream I would feel extremely guilty and stop it.  This time I didn't...although it ended there...innocent.  It left me with this great feeling though that I could carry for the rest of the day (until I was put on hold at work that is).

I never thought it would get this serious.  I have this awful fear I will never be able to get a job again.  This is absurd.
I'll never be able to listen to ""California Dreamin'"" the same way again.
Here is a picture of one of my favorite movies of all time.  I first saw this movie in about 1986 and it inspired me to choose my career path.  Nuts to it!

"event","It has taken me about 2 hours to finally get to my damn live journal.  What is going on with it lately?  I can never get signed on or go to any part of it...oh...nevermind...I'm going to lose my ""happy zone"".
Today was the first time I've felt balanced in a very long time.  I made some excellent salmon with soy and honey glaze to top it off.  I don't know...I had this feeling that I had to get back in touch with something.  I'm not going to go into how I did it, but I feel very good right now.  There are, of course, extenuating cirucmstances around me...but for the moment I feel good.  I listened to 154, by Wire and that helped alot.  Highly recommend.
Well, still no job, no prospect of job or money...and well...poo on those I sent my resume to."

"event","""Organ"" (Kei Fujiwara, 1996) is the film of the day.  Good gore, athough about as disjointed as ""Tetsuo"", Fujiwara's more famous film.  If giving a recommendation in the genre...just see ""Evil Dead Trap"" (Toshiharu Ikeda, 1988)."

"event","So it's Friday night...the day I look forward to seeing my boyfriend and, low and behold, he would rather ""relax"" today.  Meaning...he doesn't want to see me today.  I'm not even going to comment on that.  I'm just leaving it at that. I've already gone through that whole scenario when he told me, and I don't wish to think about it again.
Instead, I went out and bought myself a big giant steak and alot of beer and, damn it, I'm going to indulge.
Yeah...that was the plan.  What turns out is that I am watching the Charlie Brown Thanksgiving Special.  
Point one:  Peppermint Patty is bitching because she invited herself to dinner and has the balls, which we all know she has, to complain about the food!  
Point two:  Charlie Brown talks kinda slow,like he has a closed head injury.  I guess I missed the, ""Don't skate near the thin ice, Charlie Brown"" special.
The main point: That bitch that's always pulling the ball away from Charlie tells him at the beginning of the episode, ""Isn't it funny, Charlie Brown, how traditions fade"".  Well, it sure is.  I wish I could be with my family this Thanksgiving, but hell...like they say, traditions fade...as do alot of things lately apparently."

"event","The big event of the day was discovering the new Target and cooperate mecca that has opened up in wonderful Burbank...complete with Krispy Kreme.  The wheels on my cart rolled smooth and with precision down the spacious aisle.  Whoo-who!  
On the job front, AppleOne is not coming through.  Just as I suspected.  Perhaps I'll pack up and invest in one of those worm farms that seem so popular these days.  Yes, they exist...I've been to one.  
The film for today is, ""Franz Kafka's It's a Wonderful Life and Other Strange Tales"".  I'm not sure what I think...must not be too great as I'm opting to write in the journal instead of paying attention.  God Bless Netflix.
This is probably old news, but there is a very intriguing theory about Sesame Street Bert.  Apparently he's evil.  I'm not giving a link to the website because there is pornographic material on it. With my luck some 10 yr. old is going to read this, go to the link, and tell their parents were they found it.  Thus, causing problems for me.  Yeah...I'm paranoid.
Simpson's time now."

"event","Today I left Max's home and I'm back in good 'ol Burbank.  I was staying with him while I was unemployed (seeing as he lives 50 miles away...I thought I'd spend as much time as I could with him).  Anyway...I got sent back home, more of a mutual agreement really.  As it turns out I have about a month before I lose my apartment and have to live with him.  (He wants as much time by himself to prepare for my extended stay...not as bad as it sounds).  
Solution:  I went to AppleOne (temp agency) today as a last ditch effort to keep my apartment and save my boyfriend the apparent terror of living with me.  If anyone knows anything of this place please respond.  They seem a tad sketchy to me.  I did not have to pay them though, so it's all the same to me...no harm done.  
I've been watching ""The Simpson's"" all day as to keep me balanced.  That may make sense to a small few.
Watched, ""Phantom of the Paradise"" yesterday.  I highly recommend it if you are into that sort of thing.  Wacked out musicals of yore.  
I am looking forward to seeing, The Fall at the Knitting Factory. 
Thinking alot about the fact that I've always been afraid of plane crashes and how much they cut me to the core and disturbed me.  I never thought I'd not be surprised and indifferent by one and hope to god it wasn't another attack.  Nice.  I feel like I'm losing my soul."

So, I'm unemployed, hungover, and may fall over at anytime.  Abruptly ending this entry. I guess I should get to it instead of skirting the issue...
I played Nintendo for the first time in about 11 years last night.  That I guess was something.  Today I will try to get some points for iwon.com  There, now give me money for plugging your damnedable website!"

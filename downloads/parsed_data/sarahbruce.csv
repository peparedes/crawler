"event","No sleep again last night.
Sheesh, I really need to fix my sleeping pattern.
I tried,and tried,and tried some more. I literally layed there for hours. NOTHING.
Oh well, I suppose its nice to be up before 7.
Beautiful sunrise, birds coming out to greet the new day, snow glistening with the first appearance of the days sunlight.
I suppose I can survive off of a little coffee boost for a bit, until I inevitably fall asleep on the couch later.
The only thing that ruins that image of said above is our half-broken fence from all of the storms we've gotten this past winter. And our half dead tree that was pulvarized by the storms as well.
I'm guessing that I'll be helping alot with the renovations. The list is ever-growing.

Spring is the absolute best time of year. No more snow, no more sad trees with no leaves to blow around, no more gross brown grass. Sadly, our spring hasn't quite come yet. It's pretty odd, usually by this time we dont get any more snow storms. I suppose that weather is always changing, its truly unpredictable.

My aunt Nanette called last night, with a friendly invite to her place and also bad news. My aunt Phyllis is in the hospital, and all I know so far is she is Anemic and she had to get a blood transfusion. She has lost over 40 pounds, and she wasnt a huge lady to start with. This weekend I plan on going to see her. My mother though, I'm not so sure will even bother. She's got this weird thing that she wont visit someone in the hospital. Last person she ever visited was my grandfather..about 5 years ago. I think part of it had to do with him losing his memory, and not remembering mom everytime she went in to visit.

Word also got through my family that I am going through some tough times and that I quit my job. Wow, word travels fast in the family! ( my aunt Karen called last week and asked how I was.. I'm guessing thats how the grapevine started.)
Even so, I'm glad that they are concerned. I told Nanette not too worry, that things are slowly coming together for me. Even though I felt like what I was saying was somewhat decieving, I truly am trying my best. School is my No.1 concern right now.

That's all for now!"

"event","&nbsp;ive been waiting for so long to find someone. i feel like all my life consists of is worried thoughts.
i feel as if im drowning in&nbsp;a worry pool. thats what i'll call it.
the worry pool makes me think of my past, and my future, both at the same time.
i think of where ive travelled, where i'll travel to next, who i'll be with next, how much ill get payed...
the worry pool consists of my every thought, and every word that i speak.
i see some people, and their so happy.
i wonder what ever happened to my happiness. i wonder if it will ever come back.
i have my moments of happiness, especially around friends.
but when im alone, all i can think of is bad things. bad memories, how much of pricks some old friends have become...
im afraid of my own well-being. im tired of fighting myself for some peace in my life.

my pathetic, useless life.

the worry pool is turning into a whirlpool, as i slowly lose my sanity.
around and around i spin, JUST holding on to who i think i am.
i think i am a good person, but i really dont know.

nobody really appreciates things anymore it seems, whether its an offering of a friendship or a date to the movies.
nobody gives a shit anymore, so why bother trying?
im not here to impress anyone, obviously.
i just want to know why friendship isnt as important as anything else in this world.
too many people get used for their things, or used for a fuck.

and people who are together these days worry too much of where their partner is, if their off fucking someone else. or if their partner is going to break up with them soon.

what happened to love?

maybe most us mistake love with lust.
or just plain hornyness.


i realize ive gotten off the subject, which is why i'll end this here...
is their any REAL point to life?"

i never thought this day would come so fast.


leaving my last exam, i had so many different feelings, it was almost unbearable.
i had fear, happiness,sadness,scared and full of anxiety, all wrapped into one complete feeling.

all thats left of high school for me now is prom,graduation,and going to pick up my report card. then thats it for me.

im sick of him. im sick of the shit i have to put up with.
i havent seen him out of school for more than 15 minutes in a month.
he ignores me. he doesnt care.
maybe after being each others prom date, nothing more will come out of it.
maybe this is why i hate dating guys so much, and i steered clear of them for 3 years.
im sick of your fucking bullshit. intead of getting stoned and partying every weekend, maybe you could try and fucking pay attention to me. i care. i did care more a few weeks ago. my feelings are slowly deteriorating for you.
its so nice of you to come to eastern passage and not even call on me, but call on somebody else. AFTER no bothering for a month.
what the hell is wrong with you?
you are so self-centered. why did you even bother with me in the first place if your not gonna bother with me now.
am i that awful, that i dont deserve love, and affection?


fuck highschool. fuck you.
i just want someone to love, and to love me in return. i didnt think it would be so hard to find again."

Being really skinny makes you no more wonderful than another person.
Loving someone, and getting love in return seem to be two opposite things.
Gay, Bi, Straight, none of that should matter,
throw your labels out the window.
theirs no use for them here.
someday i will own a house that will welcome any color, and sexuality, any religion.
respect will go all around.
i will show my love for the world. i wont litter.I will take long walks, or bike rides, go to the ocean and think. i will talk to myself and nobody else.I will wait for an answer...even though their isnt one now, maybe someday my concience will answer all of my life questions..
will any one see me? will everyone stop expecting me to be perfect, and ALWAYS giving? will i ever get anything back in return? love? another love? a rekindling with a current partner? this new one, to realize how i feel?
will i get in a fight with girlfriends and boyfriends ive had in the past?
can i make peace with every single person i've harmed in my life..?
will i stop being so expecting of friendships,perfect relationships, perfect lovers..
no fights?
im sick of being this person who will only look at the dark side of things.
i lose people because i stick it in my mind. I dont stop thinking about it until its already happened. i obsess and obsess..and that person ive never wished to become, i will.
if you say ""don't"" ""won't"" ""shouldn't"".. all the negatives to yourself, i believe you will have a craving, or an unknown excuse to become that.
love is the most wonderful feeling in the world. and with love comes happiness. and with love comes feeling complete. and with love, you will feel comfortable
and
with love..you see yourself anxious
with love.. you feel full
with,,love.. you feel obsessed.you feel worried. you cant get them out of your head!
and, with broken hearts, which comes after love, you feel dead inside
you find it impossible to find someone as good as what you thought you had
you find yourself being torn into peices. it takes forever to get on your feet again.
maybe love isnt the most wonderful feeling in the world.
but thats life. right?
maybe.
to conclude,
 i will most of all respect myself.because i feel that i dont see myself anymore. even my own reflection seems to be someone else.
but until then, i will keep my thoughts in my mind, and written on this lj.
although its not as private as  sometimes wish it was...
thats alright. a couple of people can see my thoughts. its not the end of the world."

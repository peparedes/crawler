FUUUUUCK i hope u get over it sooner then later. i hope this doesnt last a year like last time."

"event","the scars from m wisdome teeth still catch left overs for me to pick at later. here we seem to be doing great then why when we were making love did i do it again. why when everything seems so real do i have to second guess it. why am i even wondering these things? im ust putting it out of my head for now but i know it will become an issue down the road. again, and again. there has been some changes latly. changes that arnt bad. i wont say the r good but i dont think they are bad a least. i often wonder when am i guna finally fuck this all up? i think, i hope it happens later then sooner because this is something that ide actually like to last. but would it be easier to just end it asap. to help ease the heartache so i dont dig my hold too deep to get out of again. im having a hell of a time getting out of the hole i dug w the last one. maybe i wont dig a hole this time. maybe i will become a farmer instead and gow crops. grw little holes to plant plants in. maybe i can actually be comphortable with myself enough to share me with someone else. maybe not. i will say, i love playing with her kid. all these people my age arearound or have always been around little kids. i dont have any little neice or nephews, any little sisters or brothers. ive never really been around little people enought to talk about it except sometimes when me n katie would watch her neice and nephew and i always enjoyed that. but i like it so much because i feel like i get to act like myself and not get looked at stupid for it. jessica always looked at me stupid when i would act goofy or tried to have fun. it got old. quick. it will be okay cami. i am making her take it extremely slow. something i have never done. although it seems like she wants to do more and more everyday and i want to but it can wait. if this is soposto be then we have all the time in the world. 

nto a diffrent topic, i cant wait till jessica moves out. i cant wait to have peace in my life and not have to worry what is going to happen everytime i hear the front door open. i hate feeling scared. not scared for my life, just scared of not knowing what is gunna come next with her. i really do hope this is all going to be over soon. she says shes goig to be out before the first. god i hope so. i feel as soon as all this is over and she is out of my life then i will be able to go back to school, get a part time job and complete it. complete school w.o. dropping out again. i know i need to do this. it will be good for my brain and my pockes. i want to be smarter, i really do. it is hard though, to find the time to learn things. i gues that is a sorry excuse. because i do feel pretty sorry but i want to learn. i dont want to be sorry anymore. for anything really. i have always said sorry, my whole life. my mom would just want to hear im sorry, when i did something bad. and if i said sorry it seemed like it was okay, cuz that is all she wanteed to hear. but sorry is just a word. i never really was sure if i ment it or not. most of the time i really thought i did mean it. but i went and did whatever it was again. and again. and now, im sorry for that. what a viscious cycle. i want to learn how to spell. haha"

Alize.. thats cool and all. wel i just first say the situation w ur leaves. but first a personal opinon/thought. Maybe she is that damn retarted. Neway she said she was washing clothes and when she put them in the dryer it stunk so bad she had to spray something n my bro was in the living room. so she tells me n i go in my pocket and the bag is in there, kind open and i feel the weed its kinda damp. it was tied in my pocket n came out open. so i got it now. iono. i dont care what u do w alize. tho it was my idea, i kinda dont think she would not so much try to talk to neone like that. but then again... i am good at bein wrong. im tryin to figure out what i want to say or think about u doin this i guess kinda cuz i dont wanna be the one to tell u to do it. so im not tellin u to do what ur gunna do if ur gunna do it. hahaha. i just want her out of my life. i feel really bad, but i want nothing more then for that to happen. I tried to let her down nicely, all this craziness happned. so i guess if its gunna end theres no way for it to happen then ugly. or however it happens. Ya know, i dont think i quite know how to save myself from misery. What does she mean? Ha... 

I threw one of thoes plastic balls w the lid that 25 cent machines have stuff in, in the closet bout an hr ago. Joe is still in there playing with it. I need to clean the kitty poop. 
I love my boy. I wanna take my boy and go.    Farrrrrr Awayyyyy......... oh i think 3000 was too many miles last time but maybe i can just start with 60 or sometin little. Just not redy to be away..... tho its so miserable, there must be something worth it if ive not gone, yet again. I wont leave untill im ready next time. till i have complete confirmation that all hope is lost. im am so off topicing. I hope my brother comes home late again cuz im smokin. He told me that he got laid this morn afteri had to kick him 5 times to wake up n take me to work. To me, that is funny because he is sooo not the type, he doesnt do stuff like that. He gets his bittle black heart broken. They might be black and little but they can still be broken.  Ya he was actin all goofy bout it. It was pretty amusing. Isaid ""you didnt pay for it did you"" haha and it took him a min to figure out what i ment. poor dood. I believe he might just be more emo then me, just better at hiding it. Hm iono. pushups r good. I think that i covered the first convo but if there are any questions u can ask. Just sayn, dunno if that matters. lol i feel like i should shut up now.

I mean, i was so chill about my clothes and stuff being thrown all over my room, all my computer and gadhets plugedup into it being un plugged, i cleaned everything all up this morning when i got home after gettin 2 hrs of sleep last night. just like ugh but not in a bad mood about it. shes loco, so w.e. but then i go to have a beer with my chicken salad dinner. and they are alll gone. and all she has to say for herself is that i drink her stuff. AKA One sparks that was in the fridge that she madea hiuge deal about me paying her back her 2.50 or w.e. cuz i drank that. and aka the bottles of vodka that r always in the freezer for her becasue i buy them. I buy myself a bottle of capt to have and she has her vodka. i drink a littel bit of it sometimes. but i baught it. just liek i baught that beer that she took fromt he fridge. not even a few, cuz i wouldnt care if she drank a few but she took my beer somewhere and gave it to other people becasu ei know she doesnt drink no damn beer. none the less 8 of them. there is no way she would ever drink 8 beers to herself. if anything annoying and childish shes done, her taking my beer pisses me off. all the other shit is just like w.e. but dan now im pissed, but i cant let herknow that because then she will have satisfaction.

Half of its missing, who knows whn ill get the rest of my clothes back. Im just ugh with it. All of it. Your not going to ever get a reaction out of me. Just give up already. I feel so damnbad at the same time though. All she wants is for me to love her. And i just cant. Its not there. I am really sorry you know, really really sorry. but me being with u just becasue you want me to isnt going to make anything better. You handle your emotions in ways that make me not want anything to do with you. At all, not even as a friend. But i still feel bad.  suppose i should have thought things through before i went making things as serious as you wanted them to be with me not knowing if its what i wanted but went and did it anyways. I went about it all in the wrong ways as well. And i am so sorry. from the bottom of my heart. Unfortuanally acting out the way you do, doesnt fix anything but actually makes it worse. Man. Im glad i met you non the less. But with all do respect, I want you out of my life. N thats about the jist of it. 

my brother is here for two weeks! Hes gunna be staying with me since my dad is in San Diego and his bitch is taking over the house. Its pretty cool, I wont be able to smoke my bong for a couple weeks though. Damn, lol. Maybe he will make me go to the gym tho. hmm. I doubt it. haha cuz Im that lazy. Hes soooo skinny now. I gave him his old pants back that ive had for a looooong time that he was way to fat for so i wore them and they fit me and now im to fat for them and they fit him again! haha This should be cool tho. Hopefully She will behave herself. unlike yesterday. 
just imagine this. we go to brekfast int he morn, bro calls, ya u can stay with me. ok so she says she is gunna behave not even two hours later i leave the house to get a random text later saying something along the lines of you andyour friends want to call me crazy bitch ill be a crazy bitch. mind you when i left we were fine. then that randomly and i had JUST asked her to behave so she trashes my room rite before my brother is about to be here. Real cool!

I do belive it is slightly retarted similar to her owner. Oh man the otehr day i told jessica that i seriously thouhgt she may have some kind of down syndrome and we might want to go get some answers. and she almost thought about it for a second and then got mad. haha i dunno sometimes i Really wonder. REALLY. i dont know how to define that or symptons or w.e. for something. but it isnt normal. she isnt normal. Ne way imnot trying to be mean but am a little concerned actually. Like not being able to function with society like a normal human being dissasatflickajsjhttion. ) wow i think im ready to get back to the guy that changed my oil now. I was the only customer in this huge ass lot and the building being half the size. Out comes this tinly little asin man. Ha cant really understand too well and am thinking this is kind of uncomphortable with seeing a nail salon owner try to be a mechanic. ha but then i say well seems cool and they are the onew that make imports like the honda n shit. This story really isnt that great. He just changed my oil it cost 30 bucks and Oh I did get actually REallY more excited then i should have that i got a sticker in the corner of the window with ma B-day on it. I even said it out loud to myself. giggled im sure. but that man looked liked more then a (one of thoes people that do nails, I dont not know there title) but a slick business man... man what am i talking about. what are you talking about/> you know what im talking about. hush. I give up i realied how retarted i sound but this is really the kind of thoughts in my head when i saw this guy. i suspected this may be more then a maintenance center. Slick lookin man. But im probly just bein stupid. but i dont no too much more to talk about. I want to hang my picturesd abouve my desk. sell anyways thats it. im not really mad. I was high earlier too. Ill just explaine myself later privatly.  If i could be a little bit smarter sometimes i think I would matter. But i dont know when that is going to happen. Or if it ever will. I think i will jsut enjoy life, appreciate my job, and have fun. mo money, mo problems. Thats what i keep hearin in the back of my head. u dont want it. it is pointless and dangerous. Its too deep. fuck wy is she home so early."

There she was sitting next to me as we were stopped at a stop light. Love at first sight could be a way to descrbe what i felt. Her music was loud and she was just singing away while she played with the charm that was around the golden necklace around her neck. She was so into it, she didnt even notice me admiring how damn cute and adorable she was. The light turned green and i tried to keep next to her so i could watch and just admire what a great soul she probly is. We drove for no longer then two miles. I was in love. Soon i saw her blinker to turn left and i knew what we had was over. She turned left and i kept driving towards my empty house. I just wispered, I hope you have a good day. I wonder if it we her bday to. She was just beautiful.I could have yelled something across the vehicles. All of our windows were down. I just kept quiet and admired though. Ide ruin such a soul as that. As if i knew her. So i just watched and when came time, let her go. For thoes brief 2 mnutes of my life today.  I was in love."

Seriously i dont have time for Anything at all. and the only reason i have some time now is becasue i missed two days of math class so i dropped it becsaue i would have failed if i didnt. And now this computer class is so retarted. I dont know why there is a teacher if all we do is sit there and do shit in our books. i thought a teacher was soposto teach. she didnt teach shit. just like 3 hrs worth of work and then turn it in. what kind of teaching is that. ugh. im starting to second guess this school thing. like i am really not redy for it. I stil want to have fun and people always askin me to do stuff. I want to go do things but i have school. Im barely gettin by and i feel stressed about it constantly. And then i have this crappy lving situation. I shoulda just got my own place. For real. and payed all these bills by myself. i hate having to rely on someone to give me money to pay the bills. Fucking fuck. I know shes not gong to have the money to pay the shit she needs to pay. im so fucked. I dont need this shit on my credit. ghayyyy. fuck i need to quit fucking myself.  dont know how. Then also this chick wont stop asking me if i want to make it work. if i want to be back with her. I dont know how many diffrent times i can explaine this. I dont want to be ina relatonship. But it also sucks becasue i have an addiction to girls. I want them all the time. damn you females. well i thought i wasnt gunna bitch but there it all goes just spewing out. At least i have a wiiiiiii that i probly wont have much time to play once this 5 weks is up. Im gunna play as much as i can! woo i wish i had people to play with me.

I guess im not good enough for them anymore. I dont know. Sometimes the only thing i want in the whole world is a hug from you. No one else. I just want to go hang out with you and make you hug me. But i doubt that will ever happen again. So it seems. Im just a friend, n not even a good enough friend who gets hugs. i guess i understand.i was gunna get high and write in here but i dont even feel like it. its been pretty depressing having this place to myself the past couple days. i keep crying and shit. so i had to go get my computer today so i could at least get some sort of feeling out. i swear i never intentionally stand you up. it just got late yest and today i was waiting on you, while u were waiting on me. i still eel like shit for that becasue i know that i let you down. Whenever u give me the opportunity to come see you again i am there. I promise. okay so im smokin. and i think i have bronchidis maybe becasue i dont have a fever anmore but my ches really hurts bad and i cough all the time. its so freekin annoying. ya how is smoking makin it better? iono. i need a decongestant. the white stripes do NOT need to be singing walking with a ghost. ugh. ya know. imnot realy to fond of hearing other people sing other peopls songs. I hate it when i hear someone elses song before i hear there song. uz then it just kind of makin it hard for my head. uh... ya... its 11:11 im high. Im doing three websites at once. woo. this si so exciting. i havnt een online high in a wile i wish my computer was biger haha. i could probly get lost in this thing.. okay but i will be back. theres not a fucking thing. just Nothing. This chicks got it rite. I just wanna feel a thing, feel a thing. uh ingrid michaelson ur cool with me. ijust wanna be okay, be okay, be okay, be okay today. wel that song made me fel temp okay. thanks. its hard to think that that many people will actually be effective. if effective.. uhh effected. affected? ugh w.e. i dont see why it woulc be that many though. And how long will it take for them to be okay. The dreams are worse. so i feel like ive seen so many fucked up things. So for you to see one more, it wouldnt be that much of a dissapointment. god if it doesnt ever happen then please let some sort of accident happen. I wonder if i could smoke myself insane and convice myself some other way. I just cant find anything worthwile. Nope. Someone Amaze me, please. ha ok im amused"

I dont even have pride for my country but the individuals you meet and how diffrent everyone is but can still work together effectivly on one goal is just... i guess its not that amazing but i just fucking hate myself sometimes for not staying in long enough to see more then i could have. oh. akward. i have tears in my eyes and my dad just walked in. ugh. dry your face. Im such a bitch. I feel like im still in the army sometimes and she is my 1sgt always trying to tell me what im doing wrong and what to do and what no to do. slapping my hand and telling me no like a fucking kid. Shes actually drove me to bash my head in the door enough to split open my forehead and make it bleed. Thats the insanity, that she makes me feel, that i was talking about. I havnt felt like i actually wanted to drive myself off a bridge since fuckin w/ tiffani.

"event","Its like things are going so good but i still feel so confused inside. even with things working out the way they are. things are good but why do i still feel like this then? i wonder if it will ever go away. i try to find a place that i belong but no matter who i meet or where i go it never seems to be just rite, like i know i am soposto be there. the wrid thing is i have been having alot of fuckin dejavu latly when im with jesica. that is soposto mean ur going in the rite direction. but then why do i still feel the way i do? i dont understand and i dont know if it will ever go away or if i will just learn to live with hollowness. milk sounds good."

"event","i sooo feel like crying. i thought i was going to cry but i held it in when i was sayin bye bye to my mom. i want to go visit her soon. i forgot how much i missed her untill i saw her and hung out with her. and i love my mom so much. it sucks that she lives in MD and not VA anmore. i cant just go to hewr house and eat dinner when i feel like it. shes great. she made lasagna and then we cooked it here in the oven and she made cookies and they were good. snickerdoodles are the shit. i am really really grateful that i have a good mom and that i got to see her. So... I got high.... yesterday with katie... and wow. umm well it felt really good. but im not going to do it again till i geta job but u know i wish i could put the things i was thinking about into words becasue i felt like i was okay and i understood alot more things better then i have been. such as you and i. and i go over your words in my head at least a million times a day and when i was high i was thinking about them again. and well they pretty much just made since. i was like... woa... im a psycho. and i use that word rite now as if i understnad it for the first time. but these are all just words to me. its the actions that show the truth. i guess we will se but if i fuck up again i wouldnt blame you this time for not talking to me eer again but please. not yet. im not hopeless yet. I hope you had a fantastic christmas and im sorry if i rined any of it."

"event","I'm sorry for myself latly. guess its just holiday season, its kinda depressing to me. Im not goin to see my mom though cuz this morn i found out she was on her way here. so im happy about that. Always enjoy seen my mommy. my dad just left today so she wont be here for chrismas. he went to be with his bitch wife. i been pretty stressed over not having a job or unemployment because my paperwork still hasnt come in. i hate the fucking army. but i wont keep talkin bout stuff because its no excuse at all. sometimes i really do think things would be so much easier if i wasnt here. if i was just a ball of energy floating into the atmosphere. but it wont happen. that would be too easy. but i mean things have also been good as well. i enjoy being able to see the people i care about face to face again. Jessica and i have been doin well despite all her freakng out on me. she makes me feel good about myself and not so worthless and i def do the same for her i think so we are in that way good for eachother. im gunna keep my fingers crossed and hope for the best when this new years comes. i suppose any kind of stupid internal bs i am dealing with i need to get over it for the new years so i can have a good relationship with my gf, friends, and family. so im tryn n hopin for the best. sorry, and i love you."

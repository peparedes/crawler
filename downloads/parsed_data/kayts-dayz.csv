"event","ok maybe this is spurred on by the fact that i wake up every morning at 6:15 and am perhaps not quite accustomed to the routine yet (even though the semester's halfway over.. good, kate.)

1) i read in People yesterday that ian ziering (the guy that played steve sanders on 90210 and is currently on dancing with the stars) is 43 years old. does that make ANYONE ELSE feel OLD????? holy shit. i STILL watch that show. 

2) maybe i just don't get today's trends in pop culture videos, but in justin timberlake's ""what goes around"" video.. the scene in the pool--is scarlett johannson trying to drown herself? i never understood it. i still don't.

ok.. upcoming events:
relay for life!!! 4/13-4/14
west side story 4/15

hmmp. i guess thats about it for now. trying to plan a trip to chicago for saturday the 21st. we'll be taking the amtrak around 9 and taking the train back in around 7. i will keep you updated because there are people i REALLY wanna see in chicago. but i don't want to get your hopes up yet until plans are finally decided.

can't really think of anything else. not going home for easter this weekend. i went home, technically, last weekend, and my mom said there really wasn't a point to come home this weekend because we wouldn't really get any family time. which is understandable. so i might go to church with lisa on sunday then out to brunch.

i got invited to a wedding that i had no idea i was going to get invited to. my PARENTS were even invited. hell, my whole family was. this.. i don't know. i don't think i'm going to go. but i suppose i have an obligation because who else is supposed to crash the wedding? (just kidding, btw)

cki induction was on tuesday! which means yours truly is now done holding an office FOREVER. kinda sad.. but i can't really devote much more time to the position or the club. i'll only be here for another semester afterall. 

btw.. bought the good charlotte cd on friday and i absolutely love it. still listening to it. i think i spent 3 hours yesterday listening to it while working on a paper. even though it took me 30 minutes to write the paper.

and on that note, it's 7:20 and i usually leave for math at 7:10 so i can read the entire vidette (school paper) before class. whoops.

toodles!"

"event","that was my feet. they hurt. *cries* man.. they never hurt this much at honeywell. i suppose though at honeywell i only had to stand 4 hours a day instead of 8. my legs are starting to hurt a little bit too.. but that's only because i'm walking like 25 million times more a day than i did the entire month i was home. that's good. i'm expecting to see leg muscles sometime in the near future.

work was LONG today. it was the first day of my period and MAJOR crampage. combine that with working for 8 hours. yeah. it doesn't work. you wanna know what else doesn't work? thank you ZANE for putting me on dessert duty all day. he must have known i was on my period because why else would he PUNISH me by making me work with every flavor of eli's cheesecake EVER made. grr. it was fun. and i got to eat the little pieces that didn't make it on the plate. or that came off when i pulled them off. 

*sigh* work goes sooo slow.. and even though most days i have more time in my apartment to myself to do whatever, it goes SOOOO slow. gar. luckily though i have some things to look forward to this week!

-going grocery shopping tomorrow night and gonna get chocolate and alcohol. damn right. well i'll get more.. like watermelon or something, but the former are definitely high on kate's list of priorities.
-working extra hours on saturday. 9-3. it won't be horrible. it's not a full day, at least! tomorrow at work i'm signing up for working downstairs. even though they'll need me more upstairs. but i'd rather work downstairs-the people are much much more fun :)
-my parents are coming on sunday!!!!!! that means groceries, shopping, free dinner, free drinks, and maybe a movie or too :)
-i got a letter from the dean of the school of communication congratulating me for being a genius. or not. but they did say they were proud of me. :D yay for dean's list status. hit me if i say that too much, but i'm very proud of myself :D

i'm going CRAZY. i have no chocolate. no chocolate.. ANYWHERE. ahhhhhh. the bitch is on a mission. I NEED CHOCOLATE. 

bacardi couldn't hurt, either..

i went to bed last night at 10. what a lame-o. 

hmm.. any more random thoughts?

oh yeah. so it's band of america weekend/week? at isu. if i have to see another person in a blue polo shirt thinking they're a hot shit high schooler, i'm going to hit them in the head with a cello case. i'm sure i could find a cello case from one of the skinny gangly insecure children who are 1/4 the size of their instrument case. (i can insult those kids because i used to be skinny gangly and insecure). woot. but yeah. i think they annoy me more than preview students.

BAND CAMP!!!!! AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH.

"event","Bush, GOP Approval Ratings Hit New Lows   
Just 36 Percent of the Public Approves of the President's Job Performance
By RON FOURNIER, AP
 
WASHINGTON (April 7) - President Bush's approval ratings hit a series of new lows in an AP-Ipsos poll that also shows Republicans surrendering their advantage on national security -- grim election-year news for a party struggling to stay in power.

Democratic leaders predicted they will seize control of one or both chambers of Congress in November. Republicans said they feared the worst unless the political landscape quickly changes.

Just 36 percent of the public approves of Bush's job performance, his lowest-ever rating in AP-Ipsos polling. By contrast, the president's job approval rating was 47 percent among likely voters just before Election Day 2004 and a whopping 64 percent among registered voters in October 2002.

By comparison, Presidents Bill Clinton and Ronald Reagan had public approval in the mid 60s at this stage of their second terms in office, while Dwight Eisenhower was close to 60 percent, according to Gallup polls. Richard Nixon, who was increasingly tangled up in the Watergate scandal, was in the high 20s in early 1974.

As bad as Bush's numbers may be, Congress' are worse.

Just 30 percent of the public approves of the GOP-led Congress' job performance, and Republicans seem to be shouldering the blame.

""These numbers are scary. We've lost every advantage we've ever had,"" GOP pollster Tony Fabrizio said. ""The good news is Democrats don't have much of a plan. The bad news is they may not need one.""

There is more at stake than the careers of GOP lawmakers. A Democratic-led Congress could bury the last vestiges of Bush's legislative agenda and subject the administration to high-profile investigations of the Iraq war, the CIA leak case, warrantless eavesdropping and other matters
   
In the past two congressional elections, Republicans gained seats on the strength of Bush's popularity and a perception among voters that the GOP was stronger on national security than Democrats.

Those advantages are gone, according to a survey of 1,003 adults conducted this week for The Associated Press by Ipsos, an international polling firm.

-- Only 40 percent of the public approves of Bush's performance on foreign policy and the war on terror, another low-water mark for his presidency. That's down 9 points from a year ago. Just before the 2002 election, 64 percent of registered voters backed Bush on terror and foreign policy.

-- Just 35 percent of the public approves of Bush's handling of Iraq, his lowest in AP-Ipsos polling.

""He's in over his head,"" said Diane Heller, 65, a Pleasant Valley, N.Y., real estate broker and independent voter.

By a 49-33 margin, the public favors Democrats over Republicans when asked which party should control Congress.

That 16-point Democratic advantage is the largest the party has enjoyed in AP-Ipsos polling.
  
   
On an issue the GOP has dominated for decades, Republicans are now locked in a tie with Democrats -- 41 percent each -- on the question of which party people trust to protect the country. Democrats made their biggest national security gains among young men, according to the AP-Ipsos poll, which had a 3 percentage point margin of error.

The public gives Democrats a slight edge on what party would best handle Iraq, a reversal from Election Day 2004.

""We're in an exceptionally challenging electoral environment,"" said Rep. Tom Cole of Oklahoma, a former GOP strategist. ""We start off on a battlefield today that is tilted in their direction, and that's when you have to use the advantages you have.""

Those include the presidential ""bully pulpit"" and the ""structural, tactical advantages"" built into the system, Cole said.

One of those advantages is a political map that is gerrymandered to put House incumbents in relatively safe districts, meaning Democrats have relatively few opportunities to pick up the 15 seats they need to gain control.

"event","ok so maybe it hasn't been that long, maybe it's only been like a week or something. anywho not much has happened since i last updated.. i had a GREAT time in chicago, and annamarie and i were surrounded by gentlemen (time to blush, guys)hehe so yeah it was really nice and fun, and i can't wait to go back there, provided we have a reason to. there's a play coming up at the end of march/beginning of april... i think. if i don't have anything going on here, i'd like to go to that. much thanks to warrens for taking us! the drives there and back were fun, too, even though everyone slept on the way back. except for annamarie. she had pills. yay pills. there's always a good time for pills. pills=happiness.

i'm excited! :) today i signed up for the sophomore shadow program which pairs you up with any business in decorah and you basically walk around, seeing what they do. you can sign up for as many fields as you want and i signed up for journalism and public relations. so yeah, i'm hyped! we get notified at the beginning of april to see when we actually go and job shadow. but i am really excited. yay! well sorry guys that this is so short. i have to get going. blah. i hate friday afternoons. today's sucks more than usual though. i have two classes back to back, THEN a meeting with my poetry prof. i'm having an uber hard time analyzing a 35 line poem in 3 pages, so i have to meet with him to see what i should cut, what i should include.. he was nice though in that he gave me an extension- the paper can be 4 pages, now. but i have 4 pages already AND i skipped a stanza and quite possibly the most important stanza in the poem. why am i even calling it a poem. it's a song. sheesh. i'm analyzing and explicating ""eleanor rigby"" by the beatles. here are the lyrics in case anyone wants to analyze them on their own time!

"event","great song to listen to, huh ('it wasn't enough') especially when i have a quiz tomorrow (a really hard quiz... it's in english language.. i know it doesn't seem hard, but trust me, it is.. oh well i should just keep thinking that it will help me be a better communicator and help me in any business transactions/negotiations i should pursue in the future. kate is thinking long term! yay!) and a test on friday. the test shouldn't be too bad (intro to management). see.. judging by my classes this semester you almost couldn't tell that i'm a communications major.. but.. i have intro to poetry (which will help me be more analytical in my thinking), intro to eng lang (which will help me become potentially a more persuasive speaker and skills) and intro to management (which i think will help me the most.. i'm considering taking on a management minor.. this class teaches me A LOT about interpersonal skills in the workplace. this is going to come in soooo handy if i decide to go into public relations or human resources). so yeah. well then there's politics. but this is a class that i've always wanted to take to become more politically knowledgeable (and we do learn a lot, actually) so that's my one irrelevant course, if you will. so listening to the words 'i gave it all i can.. it wasn't enough..'  yeah really makes you think A on this quiz and test, right?

last night was fun. i talked to michael for a while on aim. poor guy. he wants some social contact. he says he starts having philosophical conversations with his wall. i told him that the next time i was home, we're gonna hang out and we're gonna get him out there and get him pumped up. he's taking a sign language course and he taught me how to say 'whore'.. actually.. he might have signed it to me. in which case, he's gonna get yelled at hehe but it's all in love, after all. for those of you who don't know michael, he's my neighbor. known him for my entire life, he's like my brother. only he's older. he's at highland in an accounting major, but highland screwed him over, so this is his third year there (he's a year older than me), he will be transferring to niu next year. i kinda admire him b/c he's paid for his entire education by himself AND his books. he's had a nearly full time job at k-mart for the longest time. i watched fahrenheit 9/11 with him, for the first time hehe good movie. anyway, so yeah that was fun. he insulted me so then i said 'ok that's it.. now you have to watch idol with me tomorrow night' so he typed out 'ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh' for a grand total of like 5 minutes. so we might commentate on that show tonight, unless we can find another reality tv show to commentate on, but i really really wanna see who goes home tonight. they're sending home 2 guys and 2 girls. that's the most they've ever gotten rid of on one show. i tell ya.. times are changing.

for the life of me, i could not sleep last night. i got into bed around 11:30 and the neighbors were so f-ing loud. goll. they had guys in their room until like 2am and they were loud, laughing and watching a movie or something. so that sucked. it took me over 2 hours to get to sleep. then i started to feel sick, so i was very restless.. tossing and turning.. there's a lot on my mind right now, actually. the neighbors got up around 9;30 and started talking AGAIN, so i got very little sleep and i'm pissed off b/c this is my catch up on sleep day. whatever. i'm gonna see if i can actually get to bed earlier tonight. i have a 7am wake up tomorrow morning so i'm gonna need the sleep. stupid politics. wait.. didn't i say i liked that class? oh yeah...

ok, just wanted to update i guess. i'm looking forward to this weekend-yay!! chicago will be fun. i was thinking that after we get into freeport on saturday afternoon we can head over to k-mart and see michael and then drive over to arby's to see dann. i'll check with annamarie, we can do whatever she wants. if not we'll just hang out at my house till the warrens pick us up. i should probably talk to them again and double check on the times. just so everything is set in stone or what not. annamarie and i love watching idol but for the past couple nights she's had to miss it (which is ok), and she wanted to know what was going on on the show, so here's a link to a recap of last night's episode. one girl was EXTREMELY nervous and shaking, while other ones were ok, but didn't have any range. the one stand out last night was carrie. she sounds way too country though, so i don't know what the judges are gonna do about that. anyway, here's the link: all you non-idol fans are welcome to check it out as well ;)

I didn't go because I 1-had no idea that he was coming.. and 2-had no idea who he was. Well, now I do. And the other morning as I was getting ready for class, I turned on vh1 and saw this video. After seeing it every morning for about the past 3 days, I decided to download the song. It's really pretty--here are the lyrics!

Howie Day ""Collide""

The dawn is breaking
A light shining through
You're barely waking
And I'm tangled up in you
Yeah

I'm open, you're closed
Where I follow, you'll go
I worry I won't see your face
Light up again

Even the best fall down sometimes
Even the wrong words seem to rhyme
Out of the doubt that fills my mind
I somehow find
You and I collide

I'm quiet you know
You make a first impression
I've found I'm scared to know I'm always on your mind

Even the best fall down sometimes
Even the stars refuse to shine
Out of the back you fall in time
I somehow find
You and I collide

Even the best fall down sometimes
Even the wrong words seem to ryhme
Out of the doubt that fills your mind
You finally find
You and I collide

You finally find
You and I collide
You finally find
You and I collide"

"event","did i even say that right? you would think that since i took about 6 years of french.. that i would remember little trivial facts like that. aie aie aie. well maybe i'm doomed. oh well. i won't need french anymore, though it still remains one of my favorite languages. it's so romantic and sophisticated! (we actually just learned that in my french revolution class, too. hehe how it was the language of the aristocracy and the enlightenment). i'm actually surprised that i'm learning this much from a j-term course. regular semester courses.. well.. you go a lot slower in them. since we're learning 10 years of history in 3.5 weeks we have to go a lot faster. i don't know.. it's just interesting, at the pace we're going, that, though there are a lot of lecture notes and a LOT of material, i find the pace enjoyable b/c i feel like i'm learning more. i had the opportunity to stay home for j-term and get a job back home to earn money for books, but i told my parents that i wanted to come here for j-term, b/c i felt that if i didn't, i would be cheating myself out of learning. am i the only student that feels that way? i mean, some students around here go to class half-awake, if they even show up at all, and they don't really care about what they learn. this isn't high school.. i mean.. most of what we learn in college we'll have to apply to our careers one day and we should take advantage of every possibility to learn. *steps off my soapbox* did i just say that? wow.. i am such a geek. anyway.. so we had the test today...

i actually did quite well on the id's i thought. i identified the constitution of the clergy, the assembly of notables, assignats, um.. i can't think of the other two. oops. oh.. abbe sieyes was another one, i think that's it. then i was thrown off course with the essays b/c i thought he was going to pick 5, and we got to choose any 2.. but there were only 3 essays and i didn't know a whole lot of information about 2 of the 3, but i did the best i could. i actually think i did quite well and i'm hoping for an A.. a B+ at worst. anything below that and i'll probably cry. no joke. this proves once again that i am a dork. we also got our first papers back today and i got a 44/50. ehhhh. my goal was a 45, so i almost met my goal, but i thought i'd get an A. it ended up being a B+. i don't understand it. this sure as heck ain't high school, i know that for a fact now, b/c i'd get A's on every paper in high school (i'm not trying to brag).. i kinda like the idea of working harder to achieve an A.. it produces a challenge that wasn't necessarily there in high school.

so now that the test is over, i can relax the rest of the day. though, knowing me, i'm going to read about the terror, in one of my books, b/c we started talking about it today in class after the test. then i might take a nap b/c i got no sleep last night.. again. i don't know why, but i haven't had a good sleep since christmas break. it's so exhausting. i've had dark circles under my eyes for like ever. bah. ok i don't know how i write these entries firmly intent on writing about one topic, then i end up talking about like 10 different topics. ooh! here's another one to add to the bunch. make this number 11...

i got an im from  nellie while i was at class, and she said that they'd love to have me visit them next friday. so we're gonna hang out, i assume, maybe do dinner somewhere, talk. not really sure what the exact plans are, b/c my appt will be over by like 12 at the latest and i know that they have classes, but not sure when, so i'm not sure what's gonna happen. to sound businesslike and mature.. ""we're still in talks"". is that even a phrase? eh. well it sounded businesslike and mature. it was worth a try. 

ok i'm not sure what's getting into me but i'm like random. completely random. maybe it's from boredom. i don't know yet... i'll let you know when i figure it out."

"event","sorry--i had to update about this..

so i'm watching american idol and they introduce this woman who has the ""heart to be an idol"". she travelled to washington (where she auditioned) and she was telling the camera how much she wanted to be there.. that she didn't have enough money to stay there, so she looked at what she had left to sell.. she had her wedding and engagement ring...and her karoake machine with cd's. she had to weigh between the two.. which one she would miss the most. SHE SOLD HER WEDDING RINGS!!! i can't believe this. my jaw dropped.. and it is still dropped. she's an ok singer.. she made it through the next round.. but she brought her husband and daughter w her to the audition.. i wonder if her husband knows that his declarations of love were sold for $200 at a pawn shop....

i'm telling ya right now.. when i get married, i won't sell my wedding rings for ANYTHING! apparently a karoake machine is more important than her husband? i don't quite get that...  the rings are symbols of love, and promises/vows. maybe she views it differently.

wow. i am a romantic sap."

Thank you for your interest in the Department of Communication.  I have 
scheduled an appointment for you with Dr. Penny Long on Friday, January 28 
at 11:00 a.m.
Her office is located in Fell Hall, Room 442. We look forward to meeting 
with you and discussing your options at ISU.

dkj


WOOHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! ok maybe i'm getting too excited over this, b/c it is just an appointment with a member of the faculty... but i have this feeling that things are finally going to start happening. isu will provide me with things that luther doesn't give me.. opportunities.. experience.. CIRCLE K?? HELLO?! lol sorry. i'm just really excited :)  not to mention, the fact that i go home in like 8 days..  you know.. for a 4-5 day break, i have a lot of stuff planned. i don't know how i'm gonna fit all of it AND doing an abnormally large pile of laundry, in. oh well :D maybe my mom will do it *puppy eyes*

here's what all i'm doing over break (it's quite sad that i'm already planning it.. but hey)
-friday going to isu (maybe visiting/staying with anne nellie or lisa-haven't contacted them yet since i just got the above e-mail like 10 min)maybe spending the night.. i'm not sure. either with one of those three, or my parents, who are going down to isu with me and staying the night as well
-saturday and sunday-- i'm trying to go down and visit annamarie at this time. her and i have talked about it like once, lol, a couple days ago and it might work out. it will be fun. i'll leave like sunday afternoon or something. i had a blast the last time i was there!
-hang out with dann somewhere in there, and see kenny's family lol i called dann today and his dad picked up and we were talking, and he said he missed seeing me, so i'm gonna go over there and visit w them while i'm home, maybe watch some csi, who knows, it shall be fun.
-monday.. um.. maybe lunch with my grandma?
-tuesday.. come back here! *sob*  hopefully to my new room though... in miller... with my friends...

ok well i'm severely hyper and haven't eaten yet. i picked up marty's around 4:30, but then went over to the library where we're ""not supposed"" to eat. my original plan was to indeed eat my bagel. i figure that i sit on the lowest level in the back of the room.. nobody can possibly see me. well on the way from the union (where marty's is) to the library, my bagel froze solid. i kid you not. so i spent all the time in the library (all the time that i wasn't studying like a maniac, of course *cough cough*) thawing it out. right now it actually feels soft enough to eat! so i'm gonna quick eat that, then turn on idol.. which starts in 5 minutes.. eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeep! the first episodes are the best b/c they show all of the bad auditions, hehe. ok well i'm a dork."

"event","(is that how you spell it?) i don't know. ok, so i just thought i'd take a quick little break to update :) i'm listening to a very inspirational song (i think) and wanted to share some lyrics. i'm sort of just sitting here right now.. bah. i've gone through about 100 pages of text, skimming and highlighting facts that co-relate rather well to the notes and the things we have to learn for our test tomorrow. but i have confidence. a break won't kill me :D i had a fun time watching my soaps today-i actually highlighted while watching them, so i killed two birds w one stone (woohoo!) i'm not saying this to rub it in anyone's faces, lol, but i'm kinda glad that i only have one class until february 2nd when i come back. we have a paper, a map quiz, and a test all next week, but it's worth it, b/c after that test i'll get to see my parents and then have a 4 or 5 day break. yay!! might go to isu and meet with some communications professors, i'm not sure yet though, i still have to contact them (oops). i straightened my hair too. it looks like crap. that's what i get for mistakenly assuming that it is really easy to straighten permed hair. bah. oh right.. i was gonna share lyrics huh.. how do i get off on these tangents???  anyway.. to set up these lyrics, this is one of my favorite skillet songs. those of you who aren't familiar with skillet.. they're a christian rock band. some might say they aren't entirely christian b/c of the whole rock aspect, but i think that they are. emily has been listening to their music for such a long time, and recently went to see them in concert, like saturday i think it was. anyway, here's the song:

Love is all around you now
So take a hold
Hidden in our words
It sometimes ain't enough
Don't suffocate day after day
It's building up
Cause when you're feeling weak
You know I'm strong enough

Just one more day
One more day

Oh, let the world crash
Love can take it
Oh, let the world come crashing down
Oh, let the world crash
Love can take it
Love can take a little
Love can give a little more

Love is indestructible
So take a hold
Sometimes hard to find
A reason good enough
I'll stand beside you
Never leave through it all
And faith will bring a way
To the impossible

Just one more day
One more day

Oh, let the world crash
Love can take it
Oh, let the world come crashing down
Oh, let the world crash
Love can take it
Love can take a little
Love can give a little more

You can find me
You can find me
You can find me anywhere
Take a look over your shoulder
I'll be standing there
Standing there

Love is all around you now
So take a hold
And faith will bring a way
To the impossible

Just one more day
(You can find me, You can find me)
One more day
(You can find me anywhere) [2x]

Let the world crash
Love can take it
Oh, let the world come crashing down
Oh, let the world crash
Love can take it
Love can take a little
Love can take a little
Love can take a little
Love can give a little more
A little more

Take a little more
Take a little more

ok, so i know that it can be interpreted in a religious sense, but personally.. whenever i feel sad about anything, i always listen to this and feel loved. that may sound kinda hokey (sp?) but it just reminds me of how powerful love is, and it gives me faith.

alright guys.. time for a little more studying, then dinner... then MORE studying.. (argh.) but wait.. i will be saved from my notes and textbooks--american idol starts at 7pm and it goes till 9. wooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooohooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo    ok i'm quite hyper, i shall leave."

"event","this is quite the ironic subject for this entry, considering maximilien robespierre, a hero of the revolution, and later the Terror, attemped suicide by shooting himself in the jaw. though he later died on the guillotine, the impact of the shot left him semi-conscious. 

i am completely fascinated with this documentary. call me a nerd, but some of these history channel programs are actually quite good. in 2 hours, it has gone from Louis XVI, to the Terror, something that I didn't think they would be able to do, considering we've been in class for over 2 weeks and the King hasn't even been executed yet. I'm like giddy over here! I feel like such a nut. Everything was so easy to follow--like I could understand every event, and even played them out in my head, along a little timeline, going along with everything that i have learned in class. i started to piece things together, and some questions that i have had, particularly about how the aristocratic resurgence fed fire to the revolution, is now becoming clear. shoot. bring this exam on! but alas.. i only have to wait another day to kick major butt and feel that slight sense of satisfaction. wednesday is the big exam day, and while i've never been really frightened about exams, this one is leaving me shaking in my slippers a little bit. we have to identify (including answering the infamous 5 W questions) 5 terms/events/people, worth 8 points each. he gave us maybe 30 on the study guide, yet on the exam he will give us 8 and we'll have 5 to choose from, so that won't be bad. then we have to write two essays, which shouldn't be too bad, nor should they be very long.. considering we only have the first part of class (50 minutes) to complete it. I LOVE THIS! sorry-i'm having temporary delays as i watch the show while i type. i never even realized that Robespierre was this hated. he was the one that always spoke against violence and was always for a constitutional monarchy. then later, during the terror, he would make up lists of traitors against the country of France and decided that they should die by the guillotine. he turned from a passive orator, to a more aggressive fan of violence. i love the re-enactments too!!! i'm squealing now... further convinced that i am an even bigger nut than i previously thought. earlier today my prof said that if the promos for this film were any indication of the quality of the documentary, that he would be disappointed. i was insulted! i was like 'shoot!' b/c i saw promos for it last night, while watching another program, and i was all excited to watch it! oooh sniff it's almost done. the music, the visuals, the re-enactors.. everything totally fits. this is why i love history, man. well not just history, but historical documentaries. 'for liberty, equality, fraternity.. for revolution'. OMG! i need to go do something, like just start cheering. am i a nut? be honest, leave comments about this if you wish, lol.

well i think i might stay up and chat for a little bit, but maybe not b/c i'm starting to get a little sleepy (the excitement from that film was just too much for me, you know). i might lay in bed and read some more of anna karenina until Leno, then maybe stay up for Conan's monologue (if i can) and then fall asleep. i got like absolutely no sleep last night, and i'm still trying to figure out how that came to be, b/c i went to bed at like 11, and that is the earliest that i've been to bed since september. well, goodnight to all who read this, and welcome back to those of you (which is pretty much everyone) who will be starting their classes tomorrow--i wish you all luck :)"

right now i'm watching passions (yay!) i love this soap opera. annamarie and i have discussed it before, that we watch it b/c sometimes the acting is so bad, and we hate every character save 2. oh poop.. commercial break.

between commercial breaks, i've been reading 'the french revolution and napoleonic era'. sounds like a mouthful, huh? well, lucky for me, it's even HARDER to read. gah. the class is going ok, i guess. i have to write a paper this weekend, but before that i have to finish reading these 4 chapters. then next week we have a test on wednesday, which shouldn't be horrible.. i hope. we also had a map quiz today which i feel i got a 100 on. (i hope). i'm such a dork. i worry about so many things. anyway..

so yeah i'm kinda bored right now. i'm just sitting here watching tv, and occassionally reading. this weekend i am going to do something unprecedented.. i am going to go out! (you can all pick your jaws up off the ground now) friday night i'm gonna go have supper at marty's with rachel and some of her miller friends, then gonna go see 'mean girls' in olin 102, for sac films, then go back to miller and either play card games or watch movies. also next week american idol starts, and i'm gonna go over and watch it in rachel's room on tuesday night. rachel is a friend of mine from last year, who lived on my floor, and now her and all of my other floor mates from last year are living in miller, too. i need to e-mail barb post head of res life, and ask her to find a new room for me for next semester. she did already, but some of them were for j-term only, so i'm going to ask for a more updated list. it's probably best for em and i to not live together. we're going to different colleges next year (i hope). i got my application and transcript into isu and everything dealing with that college is taken care of, and next month i'm gonna go home on like a thursday night and go up and visit the campus for a weekend. lisa's room mate is moving out next semester so i'm thinking that i can stay with her. it was really fun the last time i went and visited. so i'm looking forward to getting all of the isu stuff worked out, and having an actual visit day. i don't know what to do about uwwhitewater. it did appeal to me at first, when i went and visited annamarie there, but the one thing that i have come to not like about it (after a lot of thinking) is that it is a major suitcase college. i am choosing to go to a new school because i want to jump in to so many activities.. activities that luther doesn't have.. namely circle k. luther has a service sorority, but i don't wanna be a part of it. i want to be social next year, at whatever school i go to, and i really want to join like a couple clubs and organizations. i don't want to feel like i've wasted the first two years of my college career, but i feel like i have. i don't like feeling that way. i like put all my focus and attention on my homework and studies, and grades and all that stuff.. and i know other people do the same, but they still find a balance.. like they have time to be social. i havent quite reached that balance though i hope i do sometime. it is so nice to be at home lol b/c i'm always out doing something. and then i come back here, where i spend 75% of the year.. and am not social. lol in my ideal world, i would be back in high school.. only there would be dorms and everything, and all my friends would live on the same floor and i could go from room to room, doing something every night, watching a movie, stuff like that. i don't feel like i can do that here. maybe it's b/c i live on a freshman floor. and a lot of them like skip classes, and have sex, drink, are REALLY loud. goll. lol i don't like categorizing or judging groups of people.. but some freshman on this floor are like that. it's driving me insane and provokes my position of a recluse in my own room.

ok these are just random thought-lets. i think i will go back to watching passions now, maybe read some more later."

"event","yeah i know it's been a couple days. i know that everyone likes reading about my life, so i decided to cater to your whims.. happy reading!

anywho.. i watched the people's choice awards last night, and was very happy with several of the awards. marge (lead female on csi) won for favorite dramatic tv actress, csi won for best dramatic tv show. and yes.. i have been getting into csi, so i was happy.. but not surprised.. that they won. i look in the paper to see the results like the top 5 tv shows watched in any given week, and csi is always at the top. that show is a freaking masterpiece. ok.. i will go on..

two awards made me jump out of my seat and cheer. yes, cheer. nobody was in the room, thus nobody would have been able to see my somewhat embarrassing show of emotions. the first award was best film (i think).. i can't remember who it was between, but michael moore's fahrenheit 9/11 won. i was ecstatic. yes, i was a kerry fan as some of you know, and a couple weeks before the election, i had watched this movie for the first time, with my neighbor, while i was back home one weekend. i really and honestly liked the movie. i have never really been into documentaries before, but this one pulled me in. i liked the feeling that it gave me. and i was very proud of michael moore. i also know that some of you (including my whole mother's side of the family.. who would burn me in effigy simply by saying that i was a kerry fan) do not approve of this man, and that is fine. differences of opinion are what makes this world go round. they're what makes it unique. i, however, was very happy that he won and i thought that he deserved it.

the next award made me even happier, b/c the winner was (and is) my absolute favorite actor of all time: mel gibson. i am probably the only person in the world who has not seen passion of the christ yet, though i really want to see it and eagerly anticipate the day when i can rent it. i didn't have to see it, to understand the impact that that movie had on all who had seen it. i have heard stories from everyone of my friends who have seen that movie. heard how they were so overcome with emotion.. with praise.. realizing everything that god has done for them, and everything that he went through to die for our sins. it seems that that movie singlehandedly had the power to even provoke people to reaffirm their love for christ, which was amazing. anyway.. the second award was best dramatic film and i am very glad that it won. mel gibson got a standing ovation, and it almost looked like he was about to cry as he made his way up to the podium, seeing the outpouring of praise and emotion that this audience had for his movie. he had made the comment, as he was accepting the award, that this award.. and more particularly, this movie.. has been the most important thing that he has ever been a part of. it only makes me want to see the movie more, and experience the film that won this award.

right now i am watching days of our lives, then have a map quiz to study for, for a map test on wednesday. hallelujah. btw.. today was our first day with a professor in class. he was hilarious!! he is so funny. he was telling us stories about how he has been accused of destroying the very spirit of luther, with his attacks on paideia (the freshman common history/english course), simply by suggesting ways that the course could improve. he made several jokes and then later made the comment that 'leno gets paid big bucks and sometimes his jokes flop more than mine'. he said at the beginning of the class, that if us students expect good jokes, we chose the wrong j-term course. there's other good news on that front: the book that we need in order to write our first paper (due this friday) is in, but there won't be enough copies for everyone. even if there were enough copies, the paper requires us to read the whole entire book. and 4 days isn't enough to read two full books (we already have to read a complete one. i have about 30 pages left), so we do not know if there will even be two papers in this course like originally planned. which is fine with me. heck.. we already have a map quiz, and a test next monday.. i think we can do without a paper, huh? 

well i plan on relaxing for the rest of the day, maybe either taking a nap or throwing in some more reading. i am determined to get this book done!! if anyone wants to talk, shoot me an e-mail and i'll reply later when i complete my random e-mail checks. have a good day, everyone :)"

"event","ok, normally i don't like to diss people (least of all, myself) but i am a hermit here. all i can say is thank god that my parents will be here on the 17th/18th!! They are going to drive up (they both get the day off... i think), and give me the car, and then we're gonna hang out for a bit. normally kids (well.. especially college students) don't like to hang out with their parents, let alone even acknowledge the fact that they exist for reasons other than the parental bank, but i really really enjoyed hanging out with them over christmas. my mom is like the coolest adult i know. and my dad does a great ken doll impression. don't ask. plus he has really nice hair. even though it's gray. but hey.. gray hair, when spiked, has the potential to look just as good, as blonde hair.

i find myself just sitting here and reminscing of the break. i always do that this time of the year.. and i guess i always get a little gloomy this time of year. part of this has to do with the fact that i want to be at home (still) and hang out with my friends, who all (or a majority of them) go back to their respective colleges on the 18th. i had a lot of fun over break and got to see a lot of people that i wanted to see.. unfortunately it was cut short. luther has the tendency to do that. 

i haven't been too excited to be back. not since i found out that the j-term class i'm in requires two papers, along with two map quizzes, and two exams. i may sound rather lazy, but the class that i took last year was different. i liked it. it was called 'stories of place and time' and it was an english class. we got to read a lot of stories (which i read with relish... and in like 5 minutes, but that's beside the point) and then we got to write papers on them analyzing certain things. when students hear the word 'paper' they run and hide, whimpering along the way. i like papers where you can analyze things but i have probably already stated that.. lol it's not that i don't like doing work.. i just wanted more of a break over j-term. one class a day seems like enough of a break, but i'm trying to do all of this reading when i don't even know what i'm supposed to read. on top of that, it's kinda hard to understand. ack. who would have thought the french revolution would have been so difficult to understand? especially when i wrote a 10+ pg paper on it a couple weeks ago..  hmm. i ponder this. he gave us a calendar telling us when our exams papers and tests are. but no assignment schedule. the only thing i know is that we have to have four chapters read in one book, and a whole other book read (over 200 pages) by the 14th. he said our lectures don't really correlate with the reading. how great?! normally i read everything i am supposed to read and assume that the lectures will answer any questions that i have. aye aye aye (is that the right spelling? who knows). i wouldn't be stressing out about it so much, except for the fact that i was (and still am) overly-ecstatic about my grades for this past semester (straight A's...but b/c we're a private school, it's a 3.85 gpa, 3.3 cumulative. 3.3 doesn't seem so great, and it would be a heck of a lot better if it weren't for that C in calc. dang class. oh well. the only thing that i need to do is keep it above a 3.0 and i can keep my scholarship), and will vow to do anything to protect it. i feel like a maternal figure towards it. hmm.

i don't really have anything to do the rest of the day. i already have 3 chapters read in one book, and 5 chapters done in the other book (the one that we have to have done-there's 15 chapters in this). i found out recently that we have to have the other book read and completed before the final exam, which is jan 27th. we also have ANOTHER book (which isn't even in the bookstore yet) and we have to have that sucker read by i am not sure when. it was originally the topic of our first paper.. but b/c the book isn't in yet (and even when it gets in, they are unsure of whether or not there will be enough copies for everyone) so the due date for the first paper is moved. yay! two 3-5 pg papers.. shouldn't be that bad at all. i might catch up a little and read more of the 15 chapter book, but i don't have the motivation to do it, especially b/c it isn't due for another 2 or 3 weeks. so currently i am watching abc family, rejoicing in the fact that 7th heaven is on. this ain't just any special 7th heaven--it's like the third episode. they're doing the whole beginning thing, showing every episode from the beginning. which is great... for me. the first episode i watched was the one where matt got caught with pot, but it wasn't his. he still had his long hair, so it must be in first or second season. it was in 7th grade, and i have been watching every monday night, ever since :D mainly with my mom, but now that i'm out of the house, i watch it by myself. 

got kinda exciting news yesterday!! my friend rachel invited me to go to two concerts this year. one is in may in des moines.. i think..  it has audio adrenaline, toby mac, casting crowns, um.. cutlass.. i think. i can't think of who else. the other one is a huge christian rock concert in july (i think)  i say 'i think' way too many times, huh. it's the sonshine festival. i am not sure who has heard of it. i think it is in minnesota. but that's cool :) and if i don't have to work, then i will go to it.

well i'm gonna get going--i might go on yahoo or sign on aol and play canasta for a bit. hehe i can still use america on-line here. woohoo. anyway i'll talk to ya'll later. i have a cheese bagel that i need to finish eating. 

*btw.. please forgive me if my entry titles have nothing to do with the content of the entry. i go off on sooooooooo many tangents sometimes..."

WELL GUESS WHO'S J-TERM CLASS JUST GOT CANCELLED?!

yep!

MINE.

I am sooooo upset. I was signed up for american autobiography, which i was REALLY REALLY looking forward to taking. It was going to be a class where we could read and analyze books. This sucks. it also started at 12:30 pm ;) So for a whole month, I would be able to sleep in until 11:45 and have a class, then come back and not have to do anything for the rest of the day besides homework. Well this just sucks. Being that it's so late in the game, yours truly does not have very many options left for a j-term class. I have a psych class, a class on the french revolution and.. i think that's it-those are the two that i'm interested in taking. yeah. one small thing. 

they both start at 9am.

9am.

9AM.

argh.

i need to sign up for another class before tomorrow. great.

"event","doesn't everyone else just HATE this week? it's like the most horrible week in the world. however.. what IS fun, is watching the freshmen freak out about their finals. that part is funny. i enjoy it. :D

so i had my first final today. it was sociology, so that automatically means that the questions were a little vague. nah. we had multiple choice questions, then fill in the blank, then four short essay questions. i kicked butt on the fill in the blank, and the essay questions, but i really don't like the way that he sets up the multiple choice... we have to circle all that apply. and he doesn't put in obviously wrong choices, like my anth professor does. every answer for every question was credible. doesn't that suck?! argh. anyway, i got done by like 2:15. woohoo for hour long finals!!

the good thing about the soc final is that he gave us an extra credit option, due this friday :D originally i was going to write it when i'm back home on friday afternoon, and then send it to him via e-mail. but i wanted to do something productive today, so i wrote it in like 30 minutes. the assignment was that we had to write a 3 pg double spaced paper about what sociology is, what it means in our lives, and how taking the class helped change our outlook on society. it was fairly easy to write and i think it was a thoughtful, reflective piece. something funny about it was that it is due at approximately 11:59pm on Friday evening. it was humorous because when everyone showed up for the final today, he explained it, and a student said.. 'so what time would it be due? like 11:59?'... to which everyone laughed. i didn't think that he would actually have that as the due time. at the end of the e-mail,he put ""it was an honor and a privilege being your teacher"". i thought that was the sweetest thing! let me tell you a little about my professor: he is young, has an ADORABLE 4 year old boy named benjamin, who he brought to class when we discussed how society applies genders to certain toys (barbies=girls, gi joe=boys), and we got to ask ben about his favorite toys, books. it was awesome! another interesting fact about brett (he wants us to call him that) was that he shaved his head bald and went as dick cheney for halloween. here are some quotes to showcase this prof in all his glory (some of them might be a little extreme, i apologize before-hand, but i laughed so hard when he said them):

""Pretty soon, you're in jail"" --Brett, on how if you skip his class, your whole life crumbles

""I guess Janet Jackson's boob was somewhat of an issue"" --when discussing current events

""Anyone want this hat? You'll look like Radar from MASH! "" --when walking into class, and finding a really nifty hat

""Think hot sexual experiences with strangers"" --when showing us how the media today makes us feel better if we are inadequate about something

""They're selling 'getting it on'""--how media ""sells"" things to our culture

""Your vagina should smell like a summer's breeze""--hidden message in body spray commercials

""My vulva should smell like flowers""--what the media tells us

""You could try to sell it to a freshman... see if it works""--on persuading us upperclassmen to sell our property (aka dorm room)

""Abortion, in this election, is not a moral issue--it's whether you think the government should have a role in it or not""--his BEST quote, if you ask me. this was said on election day and I agree with him 100%!!!!! [Sorry, grandma..  don't be upset at me for sharing that view. Actually.. my whole mom's side of the family would be upset about that. oops. besides being strict catholics, they are also STRICT republicans. i made the ""mistake"" of telling them, over thanksgiving, that I saw Michael Moore speak. I've never seen anyone's faces get so white..  the whole table grew quiet. sheesh. I had a cool experience, and I wanted to talk about it. Guess I can't!]

ok those were the only ones I could find by looking through my notes :) happy reading!  they seemed a lot funnier when he said them at 8am when everyone was dead tired.."

I know i know.. i'm not consistent at all *hangs head*  Who gives a crap about consistency when it's finals time, anyway?! lol today is the last day of classes at Luther and i'm PUMPED. The only thing i have to get through now is my class at 12:30. i have to turn in my huge research paper, end notes, works cited, title page, etc, then give a presentation about it. we're supposed to just come up with things to say off the top of our heads, but if you know me, you know that i cannot in any way shape or form give a presentation without having something to read off of. soooo yeah. i just got done printing out about a 3 pg little mini report. think that will be 5 minutes? i sure hope so!! when i give presentations i tend to read really really fast.

so this weekend will be heck! (well.. another word, but) I have my sociology final on monday afternoon and we just got the review sheet e-mailed to us yesterday and it's a doozie. i almost cried. well, maybe that's a bit dramatic. wow. a guy from my history class just walked in here (the library) and sat down across from me and asked me if i was finishing up my paper. i said yes to make him feel better, b/c he obviously doesn't have it done. hmm. what was i going to say. oh yes, as if the 10 pager wasn't enough, i have another paper (6-9 single spaced, 12-18 doube spaced) due Wednesday. Like i said in an earlier post, it takes the place of the final so that part is nice. i'm really not looking forward to writing it though. i guess i could wait until tomorrow, but i really don't want to. 

tomorrow will be fun :) rachel called me earlier this week and yelled at me for not being on aim all the time like last year. well.. jokingly yelled. so her and i are gonna eat lunch tomorrow and then go see a movie. it's something that she does before finals, so i thought i would partake in it as well. before i come back and spend the rest of my weekend as a living slug, attempting to focus study and remember everything on the sociology review sheet. wish me luck! have a good weekend everyone and don't let finals get you down! (even though they get me down A LOT. yes-i am a hypocrite. but a cute one ;))

oh yeah!! we rearranged the room yesterday. that involved me switching beds and emily totally taking apart the other two beds in the room and then getting upset which involved her putting them back together. it's semi-clean now though the carpet needs vacuuming. when i come back from christmas i'm gonna start putting pictures and such up on the wall :) I'm kinda excited-it might look nice. 

ok well time for me to leave. wish me luck on the presentation! :D"

8:00  Sociology (woohoo! second to last day of classes! i wonder if he'll give us our review sheet for the final. he promised them tuesday and today, but so far they haven't come. we have our final on monday *chews fingernails nervously* we have one grade in that class so far.. like we've only done one thing that has been graded--and that's been the first test. i got a 91 on it :D yay! but it was out of 91 points, instead of 100. i wish he would have gone for the 100 scale. anyway. wow look at how much i'm typing)

8:50  Breakfast (MMMMM they have cream of wheat tomorrow, i think.. plus my ever popular hot chocolate ;) even though i didn't make it, i just drink it.)

9:15-10:30  Study my butt off in Koren, before the anthropology test at 10:30. no sweat--that test should be easy.

11:30  Hopefully be out of there by now and head over to the caf for lunch.

12:30  Library to print off some papers, and organize my portfolio AGAIN.

1-2:30 Bum around :D Yay for bumming

2:30-4  More bumming :D

4:00  Head over to Olin for Effective Writing (usually the class runs from 2:30-4:20, but tomorrow is optional, only if you need another paper revised. i'm done revising all of them, so i don't need help. i do, however, have to turn in the portfolio tomorrow. those who attend class tomorrow get to turn it in on friday. those lucky dogs. oh yeah, during this time I also have to fill out a class evaluation *snore*)

4:15  Brave the walk from Olin to Marty's to pick up a tuna bagel, skim milk and m and m cookie. yummers.

4:30  Back here to eat and start organizing my 10 pg research paper which i turn in on Friday. Also, work on my 5 minute presentation, which i give about my paper, on Friday. 

5:30  Kick back and rejoice!!! One more day of classes!! 

So yeah. That's pretty much my day tomorrow. Fun, huh ;) You all wish you had my schedule. hehe  ok well i'm off now, to hang out and NOT think about papers. have a good rest of your night, everyone :)"

"event","wow. so memorable! my first day and already like 10 comments.. including one highly amusing comment from my mother. thanks, mom if you read this. that was funny and it helped contribute to making my day. on the other hand.. here's something that DIDN'T make my day.

anthropology class. don't get me wrong... it's fun and great, etc. you learn a lot, opens your minds up to many different cultures. and then the test comes.. *plays jaws music*. for a college exam, they are really easy. i studied my butt off for the first test and when the test day came i was so nervous, for some reason. i'm kate. i worry. once i saw the exam on my desk, all my fears floated away as warm fuzzies began to fill my heart. the hallelujah chorus also began playing when i saw the first question was 'define cultural relativism'. i about cried, i was so happy. that test went on successfully (96%), as well as the second test (94%). and this third one (which won't be a doozy, by any means.. trust me) is on thursday. i feel no motivation whatsoever. [if anyone else feels a certain lack of motivation, let me know.. we should form a union]. so i have no motivation to study for this test.. even though i've been studying for it since friday. what kind of student am i?? i'm getting to the point where i can almost feel my eyes bugging out of my head and my head start spinning at the mere mention of this test. i've read over the material and notes like 25 times and i'm going out of my mind. for an amusing time, come see me. and if you give me a quarter i will try my best to make my head spin. don't ask me where that came from. perhaps it was the skim milk talking. yes, the same milk that i consumed about 8 hours ago. mmmm milk!!! didn't we just have a miniature 'comment war' on milk and how great it was? we should have a whole entire day dedicated to milk. bring forth the cows!!! *starts laughing insanely* oh and look at that... it's wednesday. one more day until anthropology!! *feels eyes grow somewhat bigger*   ok please forgive me for the complexity and randomness that is this journal entry. not all of my entries will be like this... just the 3am ones ;)  on that note, i'm looking forward to sleeping in until 10:30 (at least!!) this morning. yum. sleep. it's what's for dinner. ooh i came up with this cute saying last night:

""bah. i'm a sheep. [sidenotes: i'm a sheep sounds like i'm asleep]. i'm asleep. get it?.. bah?""  if anyone didn't think that was funny, you suck. if you did think that was funny.. more power to you."

"event","So I'm back from effective writing, then a little marty's trip. *shows you my m and m cookie, milk, and cheese bagel meal* mmm. I was contemplating eating first and then updating, but I felt this incredible force telling me to update...  perhaps it's the voices of society. there are some days when i just want to tell that voice to shut up.

class went alright. two hours of nothing but revising papers in our workshop groups. at times it seems a little tedious, but seeing as how our final final FINAL portfolio is due on thursday (or friday, depending on when you want to turn it in), i suppose they are necessary. i was with michelle and garrett, two people that i worked with last group session. they intimidate the heck out of me. especially when we're in revising situations where they both have to critique my work. it's not that i doubt my ability to write a well thought out and thesis driven paper, but i always get nervous as they read my papers. garrett is a senior, HIGHLY intelligent, and an english major, so he knows every single thing about writing, under the sun. great. michelle is a sophomore, i think, but she is on chips, the school newspaper. she, also, is an english major. wow. i am surrounded by great writers. it is kind of an awesome environment. we actually got through 4 papers this time, instead of three, like last group. so this worked out well, we went a lot faster. i love reading papers that require a deep and thoughtful analysis of a poem or article. one of the essays that we had to write back in october (it was SOO far back, huh?) dealt with this women writer who grew up during the time where women were discouraged from writing poetry and literature. each of her poems that she wrote, involves some sort of general parallel to her life. especially her characters. reading the poems as she moves slowly from discouragement to the literary freedom is awesome. maybe i'm too studious and book-wormy about this? perhaps not, but i love reading very insightful pieces of work. garrett's paper that he wrote on this essay, was that kind of work. the way that he analyzed, it seems, every line of the poem, somehow all tying it to the author's life. this was mind-blowing. many times, i have prided myself on my somewhat amazing (sometimes i think so) abilities to analyze literary genres. perhaps i skipped over some of the lines that garrett mentioned in his paper because as i was reading his insights, they dawned on me and made me think 'why didn't i write that?! that is so obvious... she clearly expressed it in line so-and-so'. it was a symbolic representation of why i love writing. it provided more substance to the encouragement that my writing prof gave to me, during last portfolio review session. she is pushing me to become an english major, stating ""i will recruit you yet!"" I remember returning to my room after that meeting, practically skipping with glee. Many of you probably doubt that i'm a communications major partly because i am not so animated in person--much more animated over the computer or through writing/visuals. But sometimes all it takes is a compliment from someone, anyone-it doesn't matter who, to really make you feel good and to think about things. :) this went off on somewhat of a tangent, but i am known to do that from time to time. oopsies. so all in all, i had epiphanies in both the text that we were reviewing in our workshops, and also the reasons why i want to work in the communications/english area. [side-note: if anyone hears anything about an internship involving either of the aforementioned fields, within a 75 mile radius of freeport--please let me know!!]  

ok, le rambling est fini, pour aujourd-hui... peut-etre...

did i mention i have a cookie?! I AM UNBELIEVABLY WIRED....and probably scaring several people..

"event","Hey!!

Well, I did it. I decided to jump on the live journal bandwagon. Hmm. When have I ever been a conformist? Allow me to tell you--since January 1, 1985, approximately.

Is my name not ghetto?! It's awesome. I know. You are all jealous. Well, maybe not. Maybe I should start spelling my name 'kayt'...  something tells me that won't go over well.

so yeah, this is my first post! Yay. i'm kind of excited. however, this will be a short first post because i head over to olin (effective writing) in about 15 min. But I will keep you entertained until then. I promise.

For those of you who know me, you are all probably wondering where I have been.. considering 'messenger services' is my middle name-it would be strange that I would not be on. Yeah. Well something happened. Something called research papers *runs really quickly and hides behind a tree, in fear, trying to escape them*. I tried to escape them. Really I did. Who would have guessed a 10 pg Anthropology research paper would be required? Certainly not me. So for the past couple of days I have been attempting to whip up some gusto and actually start this paper, which is due next Wednesday. Over all it's not so bad-I've sent out surveys and have done a lot of research so the paper won't be that hard to type up. It has to be 6-9 pgs single spaced, or 12-18 pgs double spaced. I'm going for the whole saving paper route and converting to single spacing for this paper. 

Finals week is upon us. Well.. some of us. Some others I know don't have to experience this anguish until next week. I am not so proudly part of that group. I have four classes, but only two finals. That part makes me happy. Very happy. The two classes that I don't have finals in are Anthropology and Effective Writing. For Anth-we show up next Wednesday for about an hour and turn in/discuss our research papers. It's actually very interesting and I'm learning a lot about college students, as well as the perception of time in several different cultures. Thursday is my other non-final day. Well, I have two ""finals"" that day, but one of them (effective writing) we have to critique a peer's writing portfolio. That is at least 40 sheets of paper. minimum. that we have to read through. in one hour. can someone say 'scream'?! I like to be very detailed and helpful in my critiques, and thus tend to take longer than others in reading through them and analyzing, attempting to understand what they say. So wish me luck! My other two finals, Sociology and Historical Methods, won't be horrible, either. We recently got our finals review for Methods and it doesn't look too shabby. Did I mention that I have a 10 pg paper in that class due on Friday? Fun times. You would think we wouldn't have to take a final. But Prof Cole is old and near retirement. He wants to go out with a bang. That bang being piling the work up on his students. Some bang.

Ok, everyone! I still need to get ready a bit (b/c i have to look FABULOUS for class), which is two hours long (meh). I will try and find time to update later :) Have a good day, everyone!

Remember always the wise words of Bono: ""Hello, hello... hola.. may I please go vertigo.. it's everything I wish i didn't know... except you gave me something i can feel"". Does anyone catch some sort of symbolic meaning in those words? Feel free to analyze! Also.. feel free to comment! And if you like what you read and wish to read more, let me know--this diary will be going 'friends only' in a couple days' time, so let me know if you want to be included."

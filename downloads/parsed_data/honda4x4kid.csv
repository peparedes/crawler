"event","Well i have 3 more days till i go to SC baby. I am not realy that excited but i know once i get down there for my dad's surprize Birthday/Fathers day party and when we go to Disney the on our way back go up the coast and see the ocean i will have had a great time. but make no mistake, when we get back from the beaches and the summer sun i will be ready to go up north and buckle down on Rody's farm. Thats what I am really excited for, i dont even think i told danni. For any body out there keeping tract of our little fight, SHE says lets just forget about and go back to how we were before YOU came back from up north. I dont recall doing anything or saying anything that upset her after i went camping memorial day weekend. Maybe she thinks were ok but i know better and i have got all summer to get over what ever it is about her that is killing me. Or maybe i wont get over it but by next year i will have a solution to this never ending problem. ANYWAYS, i am going to go to the store now because i need a new deck of cards cause i lost the 10 of spades in the one i have now and i cant find it anywhere and you can't play Euchre with out that card very well, trust me i have tried by substituting a different card. Every one seemed to be very distracted by it lol, but gotta go bye. Maybe i will go back on while i am in SC!!!!!!!"

"event","Ok so its about 2 months since i put anything in here. Its 95 degrees outside right now and last saturday we opened our pool which is a relief compared to the hot hot hot weather. Thursay I have dress rehersal for dance and Friday @ 7:00 @ CHS is my recital. In about a week, i am going to South Carolina to see family and have my dad's surprise brithday party then we are going to Florida to Disney world for about a week then just driving back along to coast and staying at some hotels along the ocean. I am So exicted because after that we come home for a week and then spend the rest of the summer up north at my farm. I decided i would get a job up there so I am going to work @ Rody's Farm because they have a shortage of kids working cause Mcdonalds pay 3$ more for flipping burgers and at the farm its manual labor. So everybody who knows me, next year when you see me, i am going to look alot different beacuse of working out everyday at the farm but i am realy excited because i also get to see Dustin and stuff like that so HORRAY!!!! Oh yea me and dannie are sorta in a fight because she and Shauna (who is like her new best friend) are completely ignoring me so i decided hey i dont need that crap so i really dont talk to her either plus why should i she doesnt worry about anyone except herself and she lost all her really good friends because of it and i am just one of the casualities along the way i guess. But that doesn't matter because tomarrow is my last day of school for the rest of the year and this summer is going to be soooo great."

"event","DRAMA and GIRLS, why do those two words go so well together? I don't know but they do and its always drama about something really dumb like oh your boyfriend is just using you, or oh i dont believe you and i hate you. HOW FUCKING GAY!!!!!!!! Thats what i have to say. If you can't take the heat, stay out of the fireplace, pretty simple actually. ( i think its really if you can't take the heat stay out of the kitchen oh well)"

"event","Hey dannie i got a live journal. I actually have no idea what its for but here i am writing in it!!! I just thought i'd tel ya and say hey so hey, jk. Oh yea so i have a question for EVERYBODY. Should i get a job this summer or go up north? Now before you answer, heres the thing. I love my farm (which is up north). It is practically where i live, where i plan to live when i get a house. I can't go more than a month with out ging up there and everything that is a part of me is there. Its funny because i am adopted and of my 4 other siblings, i am the only one who loves this place. My sisters and brother really dont care that much, unless there is a major party or something. But i can go up there and just ride around the woods on my quad and be happy. There really isnt much to do up there either so its like going to the middle of no where, but i LOVE it more that words sometimes. Now on ther other hand, i could use the money. Danni, you want to go to chicago but i cant let you go by yourself, now can I? And i do want to go to Mexico or where-ever you guys are going next spring break. But i dont see how i could possibly not be up north for July. I have done it for at least 6 years now. Its a habit. I just dont know what to do and anybody who has a valid opinion, please feel free to say something!!!"

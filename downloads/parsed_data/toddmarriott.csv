"event","so yes, recently i ventured in to london. Some sort of business trip, signing lots of paper!

on our first night in the city, my probably most hated, most disapointing (even for a band i dont like) records ever...

the klaxons - myths of near future! i think that is the correct title.

a young woman, placed it on her stereo. proclaiming that i was rather good. i obviously payed as much attention detail as possible, as in a way i wanted it to be awful!
considering the amount of attention and press + lots of hype this band has all around them, it should of been better even for my ears... but it wasnt.

i dont see how bands can feel comfortable putting their first 4 or so singles on the album, with little to change to any of the music. and then to top it off a cover song!
WOOOOOOOOOW!
probably the best thing about a debut...................

i guess there big so no one cares for this."

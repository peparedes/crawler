"event","so this is my good deed for the day......

i was workin at subway (like always) and this old man comes in every Sunday and buys subs for him and his wife and hes like 75 years old.  so it took him at least ten minutes to reach the door then another 20 minutes to reach the counter to tell us his order.  but hes sooo cute with his little cane and how he takes little baby steps.  so he gets his subs and he walking out the door but its like really slippery cuz of the ice and on the way out he went like ten times even slower so i ran outside and i helped him and he was like tugging on my sweatershirt and chattering away to me.  but i was out there for like 20 minutes and of course i didn't put a coat on so yeah im prolly gonna get sick now.  but he made it to his little cute mini van safely so thats all that matters.  and then he gave me a cute little hug! : )"

"event","yeah so it definitely doesn't feel like a saturday... im all screwed up with my days right now.  but anyways last night i ended up going to leaf and bean with christina and i tried this new coffee thing and it was DISGUSTING so i went back up and got a vanilla chai latte (of course).  So I pretty much spent $7 on one good cup of tea- what a disappointment.  Then, we came back here and watched Uptown Girls-which was so cute and we ate this double fudge brownie black forest torte thing my mom made.  It was heavenly.  

So today I am going to the mall with shannon to spend more money and to eat more food and then I hafta work from 4-8:30.  yay.  well im out for now."

"event","OK so I officially love our new superintendent.  Wow- who the heck was Dr. Dadey??  The man of the year is obviously Mr. Stein.  

So anyways I couldn't fall asleep last night so I ended up watching ""double back-to-back"" episodes of Full House and The Cosby Show on nick at night.  I am such a fanatic for classic television, its crazy.  So yeah now I am figuring out what to do the rest of the day since I have no track meet or school to occupy my day!  everyone enjoy the 5 day weekend!"

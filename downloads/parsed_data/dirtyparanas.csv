cleaning today. I put the kind of dishwashing liquid I was supposed to in the dishwasher but yet it leaked all over the floor. Bubbles and water. Dogs like to shit, a lot. I hate cleaning it up. My eyes are burning and itching from these fucking chemicals. 
I miss my Twink E. I can't wait until I get to go and see her.
I can't wait to go to Washington to see her."

"event","Well, things aren't going to go anywhere with Casey and I. I know this now. Now come the trouble of getting over her and just trying to be her friend. That's going to be so hard. I came to this conclusion when I finally talked to her today and she started talking about some other chick. And she didn't ask me about it when I told her how it's hard for me to talk to her about my feelings now. It's just different and
I have to realize that. You know?
I met this really awesome kick ass chick online. Her name is Jessica. But she lives so far away. She's gonna be great to talk to and be friends with though. 
I miss my Mercedes. I'm gonna try to go and see her on Saturday. I'm gonna try to see Linda on Friday as well. I haven't really talked to her much lately. I wanna see her before she leaves for basic training."

"event","So Casey and I have been hanging out A LOT more lately. She finally broke up with that dumb ass girl who treated her like shit. We spend all of our time together either at school or at
my house. But yet, she just wants to be friends now. I asked her out on a date a couple of weeks ago and she said yes and she was sooo excited and then like 4 days later she said that she just wants to be friends. So, I don't know what's up with that. 
Mercedes is gone and I miss her so much. I want her to come back. I talk to her everyday but it's not the same. The only person I hang out with now is Casey. 
Crystal, Andrea's girlfriend, hates me. Which is news to me cuz she can be nice to my face but she hates me? Fake ass bitch. Oh well cuz I don't hang out with Andrea or talk to her anymore anyway.
My car is broken so for now I am driving my mom's car. Which I'm not complaining about. 
I'm going to Washington in November to see my Twink E. For those of you who don't know, that's Amanda"

"event","Why is it that when you want something SO bad you can't have it? I like this girl so much. I do everything I can for her. I treat her so incredibly good. The way we act around each other we might as well be together. But she has this girl who treats her like shit
and she hasn't gotten away from it. That's all she's ever known. We
talk everyday and we see each other all the time. I have so many feelings for her but I can't get close to her. We have become such great friends and she thinks it will ruin things if we get together. But she doesn't realize that it could be 10x better than it is now. And the way she talks sometimes it's as if she wants it too. She even said that she knows what she wants and knows that I can give her what she needs out of a relationship. How hard is that
finding out that the person you want KNOWS they want to be with you
but they aren't? I am taking a photography class at the college and
she said that the only reason she took that class was to surprise me. She said that she had no interest in photography. Wouldn't that
make you think she likes me? Yeah me too. I don't know what to do.
I spent last weekend in San Diego with Crystal, Andrea, and Mercedes. It was my birthday on Sunday. Woohoo. I'm 19. Mercedes is
leaving on the 28th of this month to move to Oceanside. We were supposed to move together at the end of this semester and then she decided to quit school and move already. I'm going to miss her."

   Amber will be missed. I love you girl so much! 

   I moved home a couple of days ago. I've loved living on my own for the past 11 months. I'm not used to being at home with my parents all of the time and having to be told what to do. But, I need to go to school and I didn't the whole year I was gone. And I know that if I didn't move home I wouldn't go to school still. So, yeah. Case made. 
   My birthday is in 23 days. Mercedes's birthday is in 4 days. I am getting her a Michelle Rodriguez poster from online. She is IN LOVE with her. It's going to be an awesome thing to give her. 
   Trinity graduated from college today. I'm so fucking proud of her. I love her so much! She's awesome. She is coming home to visit
next week. I really want to see her but I don't know if I'll be able to because that's the week my brother, J.R., and his wife are coming to visit in San Diego. Decisions decisions."

"event","I don't remember the last time I wrote but I know it wasn't long ago because it talked about Mercedes in it. Well, everything that happened with Mercedes really sucked cuz her ex-girlfriend, Dawn, is back in town and she's leaving again in a couple of weeks. Mercedes also likes one of Crystal's friends, Sheena. That sucked when I found out but I'm cool with it as long as Mercedes and I can still be friends. I'm getting really tired of all this Ridgecrest bullshit drama. So, I decided I was going to leave and move to Florida for about 6 months. I was going to live with my cousin Vanessa. Well, it turns out that there is no room there and the only way I could live in Florida is if my cousin Cece got a place and I moved in with her or with one of my aunts. My aunts is out of the question. Hell fucking no. I would consider my cousin Cece but she can't hold down a job, and she likes to have 40 year old men as boyfriends. Yeah, she's only 18. So, Amanda and I are thinking about moving to Bakersfield. Miranda
wants me to do that because she doesn't have anyone there and has no one to talk to except for her boyfriend. So, that is still an option. I would reconsider staying here but Andrea is adament on moving out in August even if I do stay here and I don't want to live with my parents again. She said that she wants to be on her own but she'll let John and Amanda live with her and Crystal so that defeated that reason of her wanting to move out. So, she changed it to she doesn't want to
live with me anymore. So, either way I'm fucked. My mom is pissed off that I want to move to Florida. Not so much that she'll miss me but she doesn't want me mooching off of my family. I don't do that here except when I need help with bills. Not like she didn't do that shit for my brothers and they live in Florida. So, I don't know what the hell is going on with anything anymore. All I know is that I want to get the
fuck out of Ridgecrest. I'm cool with being just friends with Mercedes until she calls me or something and I get all giddy like a school girl. It's cool though. We'll see what happens. I am going to find another job so that I can save money and get the fuck out of here as soon as possible. If I get another
job I'll more than likely quit the one at U-HAUL. I'm not going to just quit without having another job like I did when I was working at Del Taco. Oh well. That's all the fucking drama for now."

"event","So, my best friend as you all know is Andrea. She met this chick, Crystal, and for the past few days they've been all over each other.
Andrea doesn't act the same way towards me. I was messing around and grabbed her pants on her butt on the top and pulled her backwards and she yelled at me to not fucking touch her. We've always fucked around like that. Or, if I'm fucking around with Crystal she'll get all pissed off and tell me to leave her girlfriend alone. She can't even sit next to me because she wants to
sit next to her girlfriend. It's like I haven't even been in her life for the past two fucking years. And then she got all pissed off
at me last night when I wouldn't tell her something that happened yesterday and she got all butt hurt saying that she's supposed to be
my best friend and I should tell her everything. I guess I should tell the whole story. 
  I was talking to this chick, Mercedes, for Andrea and then it turned out that Mercedes was having feelings for me. Well, I wasn't planning on being with a girl or even having feelings for a girl. Until she told me that. So, when she told Andrea that she didn't think that anything could happen Andrea got all butt hurt cuz she felt that it was because Mercedes liked me. She didn't know it at the time. When she found out that Merceded liked me she flipped out and kept saying that I wasn't her best friend and that I fucked her over and that she hoped I died and yada yada yada. Then that same night we all hung out and that's when she got all up on Crystal. Crystal is Mercedes's best friend. So, now she says I'm supposed to be her best friend. Kind of contradictory. Right now Mercedes and I are in a kind of weird place. We both got kind of weird after the whole feeling thing and she didn't know how she felt anymore. So, hopefully it can change again cuz I still like her. But, being her friend is fine by me if that's what she wants and needs right now. But, one day I hope it changes. 
  Amanda is supposed to move back probably August 3rd. We don't know
for sure yet because if it's on a weekend I may have to work. This weekend coming up I have to go to San Diego for a baby shower for my sister-in-law Diane. She's having another girl. I was hoping for a boy but ... oh well."

  John wanted to get back together. He wanted me to give him a ""second chance."" But, I told him no. I can't trust him so I don't want to be with him right now. Sometimes he does stupid shit and I think that I don't want to be with him. Then he does something nice and he makes up for it. Like yesterday, he gave me a rose and he wrote me a letter with it. It was really cute. And then last night I
found something in one of his notebooks *I wasn't snooping, he was sitting with me while I looked at it* and I thought ""what a fucking bastard, I don't want to be with him."" Oh well. Guys are dumb."

Stringer, is in Iraq. I work at U-Haul part time. John and I broke up. Guys are stupid. Andrea's cat, Jack, ran away. We found him and then about 3 weeks after we found him we went to San Diego for 3 days. When we got back he was dead in our bathroom. He had blood coming out of his mouth so Kim thinks he had internal bleeding from getting
hit by a car or something. So, naturally, Andrea got a new kitty and
since she's gone it's my job to take care of him. Great. Andrea has a new ""kind of"" girlfriend. The only thing is she lives in New York.

"event","So, what's the news? Let's see. I had a temporary job for 5 days that ended Saturday. I was washing dishes at Carriage Inn. It wouldn't have been so bad except that standing up for 8 hours doesn't do great things to your feet. Still 7 dollars an hour was worth it seeing as out minimum wage is 6.75. It also sucked because I'm not used to getting up at 6:30 in the morning and for five straight days I had to work 7:00 - 3:00. This morning I woke up at 8:00. I went to bed at 11:00 last night. I haven't done that since I graduated last June! John still hasn't gotten a job and I don't think he's looking. He really needs to find one though. I don't know what's going on between us. I had softball practice yesterday. 2 hours of fielding balls and hitting. It was great except that I'm sore now from not throwing in about 9 months. Andrea had her surgery last Thursday. Her mom had surgery Saturday and my mother has a hysterectomy on Wednesday. Great fun for all of us I'm sure. I really need to get back to school and do something with my life. I'm not content being like everyone else in my family and not doing anything. None of my brothers went to college but they 
all make good money. In fact, only like 2 people our of my entire family, cousins and all have gone to college. I have like 60 cousins
on my mom's side and only like 2 went to college. I'm this family's only hope! I lost my Jorja (my cat). She ran away and one day we went to the pound to see if she was there and as soon as I walked in she went crazy and started meowing for her momma! Goddamn, that makes me sound like one of those crazy cat ladies. My cousin, Kevin, is in Qatar right now for the war. Pray for him."

I got my ears pierced again the other day. They are sore right now. I don't know what's going on with that guy. I've always been the type of person to jump from one relationship to the next because I've always needed that kind of attention. Well, after getting out of a 16 month relationship I just want to take it slow and talk and then gradually move on. It's weird though because we were watching a
movie the other day and I wanted to hold his hand or cuddle or something but I knew that I shouldn't so I willed myself not to. I just talked to him and he invited me to go and see a band tonight. I
said sure and he said ""okay, then it's a date."" And I was thinking ""woah, what's a date?."" The person who I was in that long relationship with still lives with me and is still in love with me so I invited them and my other roommate tonight as well. I'd feel bad, I don't know though. I applied to this place called Sneak-A-Peek. For those of you who can't figure it out, it's a porn shop. I wouldn't mind working at one but how would I tell my parents? about 95% of my relatives are deeply religious and how would they view me while I'm working in a porn shop? I don't know thought. I want the job but also I don't. It's steady hours. Good pay. Better than what I'm doing at Del Taco right now. But I guess we'll see.

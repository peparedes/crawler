"event","I just had an awesome weekend!  Or rather, awesome past 3 days.  To some people it might seem ho-hum and mundane but to me it was oodles of fun (except the part where laundro went down.  That wasn't cool).  :D

<u>Friday</u>
I went shopping with my mom and my brother in the morning and had lunch at the mall.  It felt so nice because I hadn't gone malling on a Friday morning with mumsy in several weeks since I'd been working the past few Fridays in a row.  I got the newest issue of Cosmo Girl with miss Keira Knightley and a new magnetic photo album for my postcards at Wal-mart.  Then came the fun part: MAC HOPPING, squee!!! :D  I got the new Turquatic e/s from 'turquatic' and the Dazzleray pigment from the 'she shines' collection, SO pretty!  Oooo, and I picked up the leaflet/foldout poster for the new upcoming 'patternmaker' collection, everything is so purty!  I don't think I'll be buying anything from this one, but it's nice to look at nevertheless.

Then after lunch, I came home to a PILE of mail, DOUBLE SQUEE!!!  Friday was a super-dee-duper mail day. :D  I got my lovely GST cheque, a letter from Viv (I'll write back soon!), two sets of postcards from my girlies on laundro, and my PROUSER SWAP PACKAGE FROM TIFF OMFG THANK YOU x A MILLION!  Inside was some more postcards, a bunch of lippies, and 2 B&BW body sprays.  It was like Christmas in July, ahhh.

Friday night = Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest, woot!  Me, Ems, her sister, and her sister's friend went to see it and it was great fun (we bumped into Elly while waiting in line, yo!).  I'm not going to spoil it for anyone but it was definitely funny and more humourous than the first and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  Ems cannot dump peas for beans, haha.  Oh, and I think I ate too much popcorn :\

<u>Saturday</u>
I took advantage of my day off at home to get my crafting on.  I have way too much embroidery thread so I wanted to use it all up by making a bunch of double-diamond friendship bracelet keychains (it uses up more thread and in my imo, it's prettier than the others).  I chose 4 colours that looked nice together: cappuccino brown, cream, red, and pink.  I started threading and continued on for the rest of the afternoon.  Midway I took a closer look at it and thought, 'hey, these colours really work'.  It kinda looked like a strawberries and cream waffle cone.   Then the lightbulb went on.  The colours reminded me so much of icecream (!!)  So I thought, 'omg, I can make a bunch of these with icecream-inspired colour combinations!!'  And so here I am with an exciting new craft project on my hands for the rest of the summer, heehee.  It's kooky and nerdy where and when and how ideas come, lol.

And then at night I watched The Lake House.  Seriously, my summer movie agenda is now complete :D  I had only wanted to see Pirates and this one and now I have and I'm happy.  I am so watching this movie again (heck, I'll probably buy it.  Or at least rent it) when it comes out on dvd.  Sandra Bullock + Keanu Reeves = meant to be.  I wish they'd have babies together in real life.  That'd be swell.

<u>Sunday</u>
I went to work.  Nothing new here.  BLUE JAYS KICKED BUTT TODAY!  Oh yeah and so did Italy, heh.  I am now looking forward to buying new thread colours for my new project, putting my new postcards into the *new* photo album, and buying lip smackers on ebay *note to paypal: hurry up with my transfer please*.

Sidenote: I am very weirded out by people who imitate me.  Especially if this person is pretty much a stranger whom I only know by face.  And especially if this person is a boy.  I had no idea being nice and pleasant was such a rare commodity these days, so much so that I'd be called on it by said boy imitator.  Maybe it's just my voice :\"

I cannot remember the last time I had this much fun.  I look hot and sweaty and gross (which I actually was at the time) but it was so worth it.  Greg and I hit up downtown last wednesday and I had the best time EVER.  We got an early start to the day, hopping onto the bus at 10:30.  We hit Eaton Centre to grab something to eat, took a detour to Lush (woot!), walked along Yonge all the while popping in and out of stores and ta-da, got to our destination for the day: Bloor!!  I don't know any guy who would have the patience to shop with me much less OFFER to take me shopping; even some of my girlfriends wouldn't bother.  Shopping was heavenly.  So was my iced cap from Timmy's.  I came home with:

x. 2 new Lush soaps (Cherry Tree Lane and Rock Star)
x. MAC pigment in 'Golden Olive'.  I finally got the chance to go to a freakin' freestanding store to get me my piggies!
x. Candied citrus lip balm and mango body butter from The Body Shop
x. 2 Simpsons comic books (I was the only girl in the comic book/anime store.  wtf??)

I saw the cutest t-shirt at boathouse (it had eggo waffles on it), but they didn't have my size.  And I saw the cutest book ever in one of the bookshop windows: <i>The Mr. Men and Little Miss Treasury</i> !!!!  I was wtfing all over the place.  Hardcover with all the characters from the books on the cover.  I wanted it so bad but I passed it up.  I am an idiot.


<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v148/soda_fountain19/Laundro%20pics/DSCN0268.jpg"" />

And here's another sweaty picture of me, hurray.  AND I took the train for the very first time that day!  Yeah, I know, it sounds pathetic but coming from a person who's never taken a train before, it's exciting.  The train ride home was nice.  I was in fits of laughter because of the guy sitting across from me was sleeping and rolling his head back and forth doing the boomerang and I couldn't stop laughing because it was so funny.  It also didn't help that Greg kept looking over at me just waiting for me to burst out laughing.  Which I did :\ 

This summer has been awesome.  With the exception of my hellish enrolment experience yet again this summer (I'm really not surprised, my school is just the pits when it comes to this), it's been really good.  I don't know what it is about the age of 20.  It must be magical or something.  For those who've known me for quite some time, you know the deal with my strict parents who never let me do anything.  The summmer after I graduated from high school doesn't count because I think my mom felt bad that I wouldn't be seeing much of my friends anymore so she let me have my fun.  But last year was just the most awful.  I would constantly get into arguments with her about going out and doing things on my own.  Frankly, last summer sucked monkey balls.  In comparison, this summer has been smooth-sailing.  Not one peep from my mother.  Not one argument or disagreement.  I say to her, 'I'm going out with this person on this day and we're going here.  I'll be back at this time' and she'll simply say, 'okay, be careful, have fun'.  It's always been me fighting and challenging them whenever and wherever possible.  I have never felt this free.

And even though the big boss at work (ie. store manager) is a foolish idiot, the balance between work and play is so much better this summer.  I'm not working 5-6 days a week anymore.  True, I may not be getting as many hours, but it's so much better to just go in 2-3 times a week for 8 hours at a time instead of going in 4-5 times a week for a bunch of piddly 4 or 5 hour shifts.  I'm getting enough work so that I'm still making sufficent money AND getting enough time for myself.  I've been so much more productive this summer, cleaning out and reorganizing my room and just enjoying my time off.  In many ways I still feel overwhelmed what with having to keep in touch with friends, trying to squeeze people in wherever possible, laundro, art projects...but it's the good kind of overwhelming.  I have so much energy and I always feel pumped up, not sluggish like the way I felt during the school year.  Summer has done me so much good and I'm just...happy.

I worked last thursday and friday and just chilled over the long weekend.  Burned some new music that I can't get enough of and, get this, counted and laid out my ENTIRE bonne bell LIP SMACKER COLLECTION.  Yes, that's right folks, behold Debra's insane collection of lip smackers, all 234 of them:

P.S.  Happy Belated Birthday, Lisa!  Birthday hugs and best wishes to you *heart*"

"event","MISS DEB IS BACK FROM THE DEAD, HURRAY!! :D

<b>SCHOOL</b>: DOUBLE HURRAY because it's OVER!!!  *does happy dance*  Well, it's been over for over a week now, but it feels so amazing!!!  EEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!  I get my 4 glorious months all to myself without having to pull my hair out over essays, readings, tests, exams, and all the other shit that comes along with it.  I had my last exam on the 28th and returned my evil books last thursday.  The only other times I will ever have to think about school over the summer is to enroll in next year's classes and check my grades from this year.  I hope I'll get straight B's this year.  I already know I got a B in linguistics.  I don't think I did well enough in anything else to get an A this year yet I don't think I did badly enough in anything to get a C.  LOL, in high school you strive for straight A's and in university you just want B's ;)

<b>FRIENDS</b>: Me wants to see everyone!  Viv: MI3 & Main st. Unionville??  Sally: Downtown?  Whatever, we'll figure out something.  Ems: dessert.  Heh.  That's all we need, lol.  Lindsay: Pacific?  We'll also figure out something.  Jen: you and I are SO hooking up when you come home in August! ;)  Kat: do you want to meet up sometime?  It'll be so cool with hang out with you!  EVERYONE ELSE: Drag me out because I'd love to see you as well :D  
I want to go to STC, Wonderland, downtown, wherever this summer.  I miss everyone.

<b>BOYS & LOVE</b>:  Nothing new here.  Keep scrolling.  Haha, j/k.  This is all I have to say: I love sexy hunkilicious men I see on tv (namely an interior decorater, an actor, a hair stylist, and a runway model.  I love the artsy, creative types.  They're so fucking sexy.)  Everyone around me keeps asking me if I have a boyfriend.  The ladies at work.  My grandmother.  Even my dentist (!!)  And I give them the same answer every week/month they ask: nope. And then they ask me why.  I don't have an answer.  It's just not my time right now.  I had my boyfriends and I'm glad I don't have them anymore.  I'm a firm believer in fate and if it's going to happen, it'll come to me at the right time, I just have to be patient.  It is not easy though.  I see all these wonderful yummy men on tv and I say to myself, 'why the hell can't I find a nice one like that??  All the good ones are either taken or gay, that's why'.  Patience pays off though, right?  I'd rather wait another year or however long it's going to take to find my prince then to hook up with some fuckwad now.  Like my hairdresser always says: never settle for a bunch of weeds.  

<b>UPCOMING PLANS</b>: 
1) Cleaning up the rest of my room.  It's insane how much junk I have.  I filled up a garbage bag within three days :\  And I filled up another garbage bag full of clothes for salvation army as well.  It feels so much fresher though.
2) Tomorrow I'm going downtown with my family and I'm going to shop till I drop at EC!!!!! :D  YAY!!  
3) And next week I will be a puddle of jelly after working 35 hours in 4 days over Mother's Day weekend.  God help me.
4) Daddy will be teaching me how to write chinese (and read, obviously) again over the summer, one word per day, hurray!  I haven't done this since I was 6 years old.  I can use my old flash cards, hee.  (let's see if we actually stick to this schedule)
5) Getting my driver's license (the written part anyway).  I have to wait until my brother finishes school though.

<b>WORK</b>: read #3 above.

<b>RETAIL THERAPY</b>: 
1) MAC IS MY CRACK!  I love this stuff to bits :D  I can't wait to get my hands on some of the new Sundressing collection.  I've pretty much picked out the stuff that I want: Gold dusk pigment, In Living Pink e/s, Relaxing e/s, Summer Neutral e/s, and maybe Glamoursun l/g.

2) I'm so happy because I picked up a few new clothing pieces last week that I absolutely LOVE: cutesy white short-sleeved blouse with waist tie and a wicked cool short, green striped blazer.  I cleared out so much old clothes that I finally had some breathing space in my closet and it's finally starting to reflect more 'me' now instead of me at the age of 15 :\  And I'm a total sucker for accessories and jewelry; it's even more important to me than clothes.  I know I have enough but I can't help myself.  I almost literally whimpered as I walked out H&M empty-handed today because I saw all these pieces that I loved.  I knew I'd be going downtown tomorrow with a certain amount I could spend and I didn't want to blow it all before I even got there.
 
<b>TV</b>:
1) I love Deal or No Deal and Amazing Race.  That is all.
2) I want Chris and Taylor to be the last two standing on American Idol.  If I were to really choose, I'd have to pick Taylor even though I like Chris as well and he's a hot piece of man.
3) Kendall is supposedly going to lose her baby and get crushed under a construction site on AMC.  WTF. O_O  And I'm so mad they didn't win anything at the Emmys .  Levin Rambin was a total shoe-in for younger actress yet she didn't win.  AWARDS SHOWS BITE.
4) F.R.I.E.N.D.S. reruns are awesomeness.  They make me laugh.  Why is it that I always like things after the fact?
5) Full House on DVD also kicks butt, weee!  I bought season 3 about a month ago, I think and now I want to go out and buy 1 & 2.  I can't wait until 4 comes out.  I also want SBTB, Sailor Moon, Power Rangers (original 5 ONLY), and Simpsons.

<b>COMPUTER FUN</b>:
1) Laundro rules.  Nuff said.
2) I love paypal.  I just ordered 5 more lip balms on mylipstuff.com.
3) ebay kicks butt as well.  It has helped me expand the care bear family and the hello kitty notebook collection, YAY!

<b>ME</b>:  I cannot wait to dig into my Nancy Drews.  I was only able to read one over Christmas and I have 5 or 6 waiting for me.  And I cannot wait to start crafting again.  I have so much beads and so many ideas.  Making another scrapbook would be fun too but I don't know what to do it on.  I've made a personal one and a cosmetic one.  Hmm, I'll think about it.

"event","For the first time in months, I finally feel calm and at peace.  I know the feeling won't last (with exams coming up in a month, I'm sure to be stressed out again) but it's SO nice out today and it's so nice and mild and breezy that it just makes me feel exhilerated.  It's amazing what fresh air will do for you.  I finished the 3 presentations/debates that I had scheduled for school this week (the last one I finished this morning) and it feels so good.  For the next 2 weeks I'll just be quitely working on 2 research essays and one final assignment for my history class, which is definitely a refreshing change of pace.  

I figured since I didn't have any urgent homework or studying to do I'd take the bus to the Promenade mall to eat lunch and for a little mall browsing.  I love doing things on my own and just doing my thing without a care in the world.  And for over an hour I was able to shut my brain off and just aimlessly walk around the mall and to sit peacefully on a bus.  I don't what it is about today, with the weather and my little mall trip I just feel...really good. :)  I wasn't able to find any more Dessert Treats stuff at their Claire's (BOO) but I did manage to pick up a Jello lip smacker, a lip balm duo set (maple syrup and pancakes), a long pink stone necklace, and the current issue of People magazine with Britney Spears on the cover (YAY!).  I'm so excited because I'll be going shopping with Lindsay tomorrow and I've already mentally picked out a few things that I want:
x. strawberry body butter and coconut body butter from the body shop
x. a mac eyeshadow and mac lustreglass from the new culturebloom collection (which shades yet I'm not sure)
x. possibly another calgon lotion or body mist, I'm not sure
and a few other random things.  I'm excited because I haven't seen this girl since the summer and it'll be so good to hang out again, if only for a few hours.

And yesterday I bumped into a few people at school which I never seem to do anymore.  I bumped into Spencer yesterday and I ate lunch with him (I haven't seen this dude since the last day of high school) and I bumped into an old friend of mine from elementary school, whom I had law class with last year.  It was so good to see him again.  I lost touch with him for a bit after 2nd year and also b/c I lost my msn and couldn't find any of his contact info.  I miss my old friends so much and to see him was really nice.  It's just an unexplainable feeling knowing that you have friends that you've known since you were a little kid and they genuinely like you for you.  Today is just a very warm and fuzzy day.  The laundro loves thread totally made me happy too, I feel blessed knowing I've made such good friends and that these girls just seem to <i>know</i> me without even having met me.  *HUGS* all around :D

And I don't know whether I should think of paypal as a sin or a blessing.  I'd prefer the latter.  There's just so much awesome stuff on ebay and paypal just makes it sooo easy.  I have, like, 10 items in my watch list :\  Not to mention how much easier it is now to place orders on multiple lip balm sites.  Oh well.

Other than shopping stuff and school stuff, things are pretty much the same on all other fronts.  My brother and I are planning on getting our driver's license together once he turns 16 in March (yay for him but pathetic for me) and he and I are just looking forward to the new season of the Amazing Race which is scheduled to air next Tuesday, YAY!!  I think that's all I can handle right now.  There's so much to think about and to plan for the next year.  I need to figure out what courses I'm taking for my senior year, what I'm doing to do once I graduate, what I want to do this summer...gah, it's too much to think about at once."

"event","<b>WORST. VALENTINE'S DAY. EVER.</b> 

I had worked 3 of the past 4 days not including yesterday and of course everything was on hyperspazzm because of valentine's day.  Boxes and boxes of roses to clean, flowers to unpack, flowers to wrap, and hours on my feet.  Just like last year.  Exactly what I was expecting and exactly what I was prepared for.  Tiring, but fun.  Yesterday ended up being the worst valentine's day I could've asked for.  I was all excited to go to work knowing it would be beyond busy and that it'd be fun.  I was so wrong.  My manager sent me over to work on my own at the individual wrapping table.  Don't get me wrong, it's nice not having 5 or 6 people bumping into you and to have your own working space.  But they changed the location of the table so practically no one could see me, I had to sit on the concrete by the window if I wanted to rest my back and feet, and it honestly pulls a number on your back after bending over 5+ hours wrapping flowers for people.  Maybe I took it a little too personally b/c I worked the same table last year and I was hoping someone else would've been given the job this year.  But no, I was the lucky one who got pushed over to the side.

To make things worse, one of the managers got on my case.  Since none of the customers could see me (some fuckwad thought it'd be a good idea to put the table in no-man's land), I was standing around with not much to do save for the few customers that did happen to see me, for the first 2 hours.  She decides to bitch at me and tell me to get off my ass and to GET customers over from the flower dept to my table.  Why the fuck is it my responsibility to chase down customers?  People are supposed to come to ME if they want their stuff wrapped.  It's not my fucking fault ppl can't see me or my table and it's not my fucking fault my lovely co-workers don't tell them there's another girl available for them.  I've been working my fucking ass off for 20+ hours over the course of 3 days without even taking so much as a lunch or dinner break and that's the thanks that I get?  GO TO FUCKING HELL.

And to make things even more worse, NONE of my co-workers except one asked me if I was okay and if I needed help and NONE of them offered to switch places with me during the day.  So I was stuck at my stupid table for 8+ hours.  Of course, no one wants to work at the stupid table by themselves so let's stick Debra there and let's stay here at the flower dept. where everyone else is.  Only one of the ladies and one of the girls bothered to check up on me and to ask me what I wanted for dinner so I wouldn't fucking starve to death.

As it was, I was tired and numb and frustrated and angry by the end of the night.  As I was getting into my dad's car, a block of ice twice the size of my head decided to fall off the roof of the store and onto my head.  I thought my head was going to split open and I was surprised to find that blood wasn't pouring out when I went to touch it.  I went home sobbing from the pain on my head and from the frustration and stress from the day.  I just sat in the car and cried the whole way home because I was so miserable and so tired.  The only thing that half-cheered me up were the packages from laundro waiting for me on my dinner table and the chocolate cake waiting for me in the fridge and knowing I'd made enough money to blow on something nice for myself.  It was a god awful day and the worst valentine's day ever."

And yes, I'll update everyone about the secret love of my life (or as Manda likes to call him, 'flower boy', haha).  It wasn't anything exciting though.  All I can say right now is that yes, he's gone now but I managed to profess my love for him on his last day at work because I too was at work and by professing my love I mean hyperventilating and blushing profusely in his presence and coyly looking elsewhere as I told him how cute I thought he was and feeling like a dingdong.  That's it for now."

"event","Alright, here's my long-awaited Christmas LJ entry.  Be prepared and get comfy now, because it's going to be long :)

This Christmas break was amazing.  That's the only word that can describe it.  I hoped for so much this Christmas, it was everything I wanted it to be.  Fun, head-spinning, busy, and just...great.  I had something planned for every single day and each day was fulfilling in its own way.  I was so sad last Christmas and I wished so much that the next one would be better and it was.

I got off of school and finished my last exam on the 14th.  So what did I do until the following Monday?  I worked.  I worked on the thursday, the friday, and the sunday.  THEN came Christmas week.  FUN week!!  The week that I had been looking forward to for a long time (well, it felt that way anyway).  I worked the Monday, the Tuesday, and the Friday.  If you haven't already noticed, DEBRA IS A WORKAHOLIC.  I take after my dad :\  You'd think most people wouldn't want to work so much, that they'd want to chill and relax and go out and party.  Nope, I like to work my butt off until my feet ache.  Call me greedy, but I thrive on making money. ;)  And I enjoy my job.  And I enjoy looking at the boy who works in the wine rack very much.  He is HOT.  I want him.  I've been crushing on him for gods-knows-how-long.  Unfortunately, he has a girlfriend :(  I told one of the ladies that I work with that week that I like him but alas he is seeing someone and her response?  ""TAKE HIM!""  I was appalled.  Really, I was.  (...)  

I love the ladies/girls that I work with.  There are a special few that just make me feel special and they let me know it each and every time I see them.  They treat me like I'm one of their own daughters and it's just nice to know there are people out there who genuinely like me for me and who appreciate me and know how hard I work.

Between all that work was more pure fun.  Me and Ems took a trip down to Eaton Centre on the Wednesday and we had a blast!  I was so so excited about going since really, I'd never really shopped there before and I was DYING to finally see and shop in Sephora.  That day did NOT disappoint :D  I'm so glad I had Ems with me to humour me while I roamed aisle after aisle in Sephora just gawking at all the wonderful stuff I could buy.  So long story short, here's what I came home with:

x. 2 necklaces from AE (on sale, woot!)
x. Hello Kitty memo pad, Hello Kitty makeup pouch, Chococat spiral journal
x. Britney Spears 'B in the Mix' remix CD
x. 2 Sephora sweet indulgences body souffles in coconut nectar and marshmallow fluff
x. Hard Candy '10 years of gloss' lip gloss pot (SO pretty with the jeweled heart!)
x. Rosebud strawberry lip balm tin
x. Philosophy cinnamon buns lip shine

I think there was more, but I can't remember.  Sephora is heaven on earth. I'm already starting to save up money for my next trip there :)

Then came the Thursday: Vivien's party.  If only I had a camcord to videotape me cooking, then I could show my mom and say, 'see?  I CAN cook'.  Sort of.  Anyway, the point is, the party was fun.  I cooked meatballs.  And I learned numerous things about my friends that night.  Greg knows how to cook O_O.  And he downed 3 Smirnoff ices that night.  Joyce thinks Adam from Maroon 5 sings like someone is squeezing his balls (Matt: 'A flat!' Joyce: no you idiot, A sharp!).  Andiboo has never peeled an orange in his life, hence why we ended up with a demented orange.  And Sally is jealous of my sexy blue satin sephora bag.  It was a fun night ;)

Then came Christmas eve at my grandparents'.  I stuffed myself silly with food and played poker with my brother, uncle, and cousins.  WOOT!  Pictures to come later after I develop the roll.  That's all for now :)"

"event","I made a conscious decision last week to see if I could go vegetarian for a week, starting today.  I always wondered if I could pull it off and what it'd be like to not eat any meat for a week (or even for the rest of my life).  Getting food at school is a piece of cake, but eating dinner is going be quite the pickle :\  I mentioned it to my mom and she thought I was being silly.  I don't think she took me seriously.  Oh well, if she cooks any meat this week I just won't eat it?  

Foods that I love that I'll have to give up if I go vegetarian:

x. chicken mcnuggets and grilled chicken
x. shrimp, lobster, and fish fillets
x. sausage
x. a hamburger once in a blue moon 

Foods that I love that I won't have to give up:

x. ice cream
x. CHEESE
x. pasta, noodles
x. chocolate
x. potatoes and my other lovely starches (bread)
x. veggie fried rice
x. mushrooms and broccoli and pickles
x. scrambled eggs
x. JUICE

I'm doing a good job so far.  I brought my breakfast with me to school: apple juice, apple crumble granola bar (these are so good!), and cheese sandwich.  YAY :D

Holiday prettiness is starting to get to me.  So many pretty, nice things that I want (and yes, lip gloss related, heh).
x. MAC holiday lipgelee set
x. Lancome Juicy Tube holiday set
x. bonne bell stuffs (too many to list)
x. Philosophy 'a few good men' stuff that I haven't shut up about.
I couldn't resist yesterday and I bought myself 2 of the bonne bell sets during my break at work.  They're pretty ^_^

Oh Oh, and I'm EXCITED because I'm finally getting my digi cam next week!!!

Not so hot: I have exams starting again in 2 weeks *cry*.

10 Reasons Why Gay Marriage is Wrong 


01) Being gay is not natural. Real Americans always reject unnatural things like eyeglasses, polyester, and air conditioning. 

02) Gay marriage will encourage people to be gay, in the same way that hanging around tall people will make you tall. 

03) Legalizing gay marriage will open the door to all kinds of crazy behavior. People may even wish to marry their pets because a dog has legal standing and can sign a marriage contract. 

04) Straight marriage has been around a long time and hasn't changed at all; women are still property, blacks still can't marry whites, and divorce is still illegal. 

05) Straight marriage will be less meaningful if gay marriage were allowed; the sanctity of Britany Spears' 55-hour just-for-fun marriage would be destroyed. 

06) Straight marriages are valid because they produce children. Gay couples, infertile couples, and old people shouldn't be allowed to marry because our orphanages aren't full yet, and the world needs more children. 

07) Obviously gay parents will raise gay children, since straight parents only raise straight children. 

08) Gay marriage is not supported by religion. In a theocracy like ours, the values of one religion are imposed on the entire country. That's why we have only one religion in America. 

09) Children can never succeed without a male and a female role model at home. That's why we as a society expressly forbid single parents to raise children. 

10) Gay marriage will change the foundation of society; we could never adapt to new social norms. Just like we haven't adapted to cars, the service-sector economy, or longer life spans. 


Please feel free to post if you also feel that love is what makes a marriage, not gender

I love whoever wrote this and made up this list.  The sarcasm and irony is genius.  It's wonderful to know there are kind and open-minded people in this world :)"

"event","I should have posted this yesterday, but Tuesdays are always way too busy.  Eddie Guerrero died over the past weekend.  Only a true wrestling fan would understand this, but I was shocked and dumbfounded when I heard the news from my brother monday night.  Watching raw on monday was so sad, <i>I</i> ended up in tears from watching the wrestlers break down like that.  It doesn't even seem real.  Why is it that it ALWAYS takes a death to remind us of how fragile life is?  That it can be snatched away from us in a split second?  WHY?  And why is it that our lives are so fucking busy that we can't even keep in touch with the people who really matter to us?  Why do we let these people drift away from us?  Is it because we don't like these people anymore, or simply because we're too goddamn fucking lazy to do anything about it?  I hate that I haven't been a good friend lately to certain people and I hate that certain people who I've tried to be good to have still neglected me.  This is nice, I'm not even making any sense.

Step One
- Make a post (public, friendslocked, filtered...whatever you're comfortable with) to your LJ. The post should contain your list of 10 holiday wishes. The wishes can be anything at all, from simple and fun (""I'd love a Snape/Hermione icon that's just for me"") to medium (""I wish for _____ on DVD"") to really big (""All I want for Christmas is a new car/computer/house/TV."") The important thing is, make sure these wishes are things you really, truly want.

- If you wish for real possible things, make sure you include some sort of contact info in your post, whether it's your address or just your email address where Santa (or one of his elves) could get in touch with you.

- Also, make sure you post some version of these guidelines in your LJ, so that the holiday joy will spread.

Step Two
- Surf around your friendslist (or friendsfriends, or just random journals) to see who has posted their list.

And now here's the important part:

- If you see a wish you can grant, and it's in your heart to do so, make someone's wish come true. Sometimes someone's trash is another's treasure, and if you have a leather jacket you don't want or a gift certificate you won't use--or even know where you could get someone's dream purebred Basset Hound for free--do it.

You needn't spend money on these wishes unless you want to. The point isn't to put people out, it's to provide everyone a chance to be someone else's holiday elf--to spread the joy. Gifts can be made anonymously or not--it's your call.

There are no rules with this project, no guarantees, and no strings attached. Just...wish, and it might come true. Give, and you might receive. And you'll have the joy of knowing you made someone's holiday special.

So maybe it wasn't the most comfortable feeling having my hair whip me in the face and my ears feeling frostbitten because of the wind, but nonetheless I got the job done :D  I finished my mom's christmas present, but I changed my mind and got her stuff I didn't plan on getting her initially.  I got her 2 CDs (a Phil Collins one and a Lionel Ritchie one) and one of those pretty crystal bracelets.  It's sitting peacefully in my backpack right now :)  

And I want to get a visor for my brother to go with the poker set...and a toy cigar...just for laughs, heehee.

And what did I get for lil' ole me today?  Lip gloss.  DUH.  Heehee.  I got 3 L'oreal CJs and a 2005 Bonne Bell Holiday party pack (8 smackers)!!!  I HAD FUN.

I hope I'll get my x-mas work schedule soon.  I want to see how much I'm working and how I can start planning fun stuff around it.  It's not going to be easy though :\  I still have an exam on the 14th of December and I have a take-home exam for my history class due the week I get back, I think.  And I gave my manager A LOT of days and shifts to work with...so hopefully I'll still have some time to plan fun stuff around all that.

And school is a meanie.  It makes you happy one minute and makes you want to cry the next.  I did supremely well on my linguistics quiz (I'd hope so, it was online and open book), but I didn't do as hot on my social change exam.  I mean, the mark was okay and all but I wanted to cry when I first looked at the mark because I thought I'd done much better than that.  But considering how much everyone else in the class is bitching about their unfair marks and how the other TA apparently failed half his class...I think I should consider myself lucky. :\

You are attracted to those who are unbridled, untrammeled, and free.

In love, you feel the most alive when things are straight-forward, and you're told that you're loved.

You'd like to your lover to think you are optimistic and happy.

You would be forced to break up with someone who was emotional, moody, and difficult to please.

Your ideal relationship is open. Both of you can talk about everything... no secrets.

Your risk of cheating is high. You can't resist desire and lust.

I handed in my last midterm on Wednesday (my take-home exam), finished my online quiz the first hour it was made available Thursday night, and I SHOPPED TILL I DROPPED ON FRIDAY!!!  Friday was so much fun.  Me and mom hit the mall for some major splurging.  It felt SO GOOD to let loose after those wretched midterms.  Anyway, I came home with:

x. 2 magazines (J-14 and Seventeen).  I shamefully bought J-14 just for 2 pages.  Don't give me that look.  You know you've done it yourself once or twice so don't act all high and mighty with me *sticks tongue out to no one in particular*
x. a new Caboodles makeup case.  This one is so pretty.  It's got pink psychedelic swirls all over it.
x. 3 packs of stickers (1 winnie the pooh, 1 precious moments, and 1 sheet of shiny butterflies)
x. an x-mas card for Ems
x. 2 LABELLO LIP BALMS!!!!  I am a freak.  Lip balms that cost $1.64 make me squeal.  Cherry and Orange.  I was so freakin' excited when I stumbled on the orange one omg omg.
x. a Hello Kitty poster.  I can't wait to stick this on my wall!
x. 3 sweaters (1 beige, 1 baby blue, and 1 pink).

The mall is my utopia *faints* <3

AND I started my x-mas shopping yesterday.  I bought my brother's present yesterday morning and I seriously cannot wait to see the look on his face x-mas morning when he opens it.  He and I love love love card games and he's really into the poker and blackjack stuff.  So I got him a poker set!  The whole deal.  The silver case, the chips, the cards, the dealer button, whatever.  Heehee, me and mom sneaked out of the house to get it and dad helped me hide it.  Total group effort.  I am so excited.  Eeee!  I'm considering getting him a visor too, just for laughs, heh.

And mom so doesn't know this, but I'm getting part of her present this thursday.  I usually get to school by at least 8:30 but since I don't have class until 12:30, I'm planning on hopping on the go bus to the mall, buying what I need to buy, and hopping back in time for class.  Now most ppl would probably think I'm insane.  Why not just buy it at the mall with a friend when she's not there?  Answer: she'll obviously see it if she comes to pick me up.  DUH.  This way I can conveniently hide it in my backpack and she'll never be the wiser, heehee.  And you also might be thinking, why are you wasting money on bus tickets back and forth?  Answer:  I have my lovely 10-ride ticket and since I only normally take the bus once a week, I can hop on and off the bus to my heart's content.  So HA.  I'm planning on getting her Phil Collins' greatest hits love songs compilation and probably something cool from Second Cup since she's a coffee nut (or bean, heehee), and probably a MAC lipstick if I can find the right shade.

My dad's a pickle though.  He doesn't particularly like anything or want anything.  I mean, he does, but those things are so out of my range and so not my place to get anyway (I'm not even 1/10th as technologically savvy as he is and I don't have that kind of money, bleh.)  Maybe I'll surprise him with a bag of cheesies.  He likes those.

And what to get for little ole me?  3 words: Bonne Bell & Sephora.  ;)  Oh, and I still want Simpsons Monopoly.  So make that 5 words. :)"

In other news, my school <i>is</i> seriously effed up.  I'm going to have to wake up at 6am tomorrow morning to get on the computer.  Why?  To check the school website to see if I have to go to school.  Why?  Because the TAs will probably go on strike.  Yes, that's right, my school is going on strike again (remember that horrific one that happened several years ago and lasted for almost 3 months and caused a lot of ruckus and chaos?  Yeah...) and classes won't be in session even though it's technically not the entire faculty going on strike.  If school's on, cool.  If they go on strike for just a week, that's okay too.  But any more than that and we are so fucked up."

<P>Work: I have more hours!!&nbsp; I now work every sunday 10-5 as was planned in the beginning, but now I also work every other Friday from 12-8, and the *occasional* extra friday or saturday.&nbsp; YAY!&nbsp; I know it means I have to cram more studying into the rest of the week, but this is the only way I can get my hours and I mean, I need the money.&nbsp; The books for school made my bank account cry and beg for mercy. :\</P>

<P>Boys:&nbsp; Boys are stupid.&nbsp; Why do I always get the stupid, lame, spineless ones??&nbsp; I used to think of him as the love of my life, with nothing but fond memories.&nbsp; I now think of him as a disappointment, who has no sense of time, no sense of responsibility, and absolutely NO respect for me and our so-called friendship.&nbsp; In the back of my mind I always thought he was my true love, that we were ""meant to be"".&nbsp; He blew it for good and for real this time.&nbsp; It was a harsh wake-up call and I know I needed it, but no one will EVER understand how much this actually hurt me.&nbsp; I don't ever want to see or speak to him ever again.</P>

"event","I hope everyone had a terrific weekend because I sure did :)  And guess what my weekend consisted of?  <b>SHOPPING</b>.  Surprise, surprise.  It was so pretty this weekend (with the exception of today, where I was left trembling at the computer while hail stones pelted the window beside me O_O ), so I decided to celebrate the prettiness in style.  My family and I went to Vaughan Mills on Friday and I have to say, I was mighty impressed.  Now I know a mall is just a mall, but when it's a brand spanking <b>NEW</b> mall, it's always exciting.  I swear, it took us 4 hours to make <b>ONE</b> round of the damn thing because we kept popping into every other store.  There's so much to look at, and I SO want to try the cute little restaurants there!  And I realized something on my shopping expedition: <b>I AM A JEWELRY/ACCESSORY WHORE</b>.  I kinda knew that and I know you all know that, but I never realized how much I leaned in that direction.  Everytime I go into a clothing store, I walk to the jewelry and accessory racks without so much as a glance at the actual clothes o_O  You could kinda tell by the stuff I bought:

x. a rhinestone kitty necklace
x. 2 sets of braclets from Bluenotes and a pink tee
x. a peacock-blue purse that I am absolutely in love with (the biggest steal EVER)

The tee doesn't really count because my mom bought it :\  

And then on Saturday, I added 2 new members to the Carebear family: Share Bear and Harmony Bear.  They're so cute and they're both purple. :)

I can't believe it's already August.  July just seemed to whiz right by.  As much as I hate to say and admit this, I'm just a *little* excited about going back to school.  Not to say that I don't love summer, but well...this summer just wasn't what I thought it would be.  The only really good thing I can think of that happened this summer is that I worked a lot in May and June and I saved up so much money from it.  I mean, I enjoyed getting together with my friends the few times that I did, but for some reason...it just doesn't feel ENOUGH.  I guess it's because almost everytime I went out, I got an earful from my mom and I'm just sick of it now.  It's hard to explain unless you're in my shoes, but I just want MORE.  More time with my friends, more time doing things completely on my own, and just more out of life.  I feel as if this summer has been sucked dry.  It's not enough for me to just stay home with my mom and my brother all the time.  I want to go out and DO THINGS, really enjoy myself.  My mom just doesn't understand.  She thinks it'll always be ""me and mommy forever"".  Well, it isn't and it won't be.  I let go of mommy's hand the day I started kindergarten, but it's almost like she's in complete denial that I'll be 20 in less than a month and that things just can't be the same anymore.

Which is why, in a way, I'm looking forward to the school year.  I truly want to enjoy myself this year.  The past 2 years have just been a piece of shit.  The 1st year I was too hung up and confused over a person who didn't even deserve to be hung up over, and the 2nd year was plagued by family freaking deaths left and right.  Even though I'm bummed that I won't be able to see my best friend as much this coming year, I have a feeling that it won't affect a thing and that it'll just make the friendship even stronger. :)  I love you to pieces, Ems.

And to end off, here's a snippet for all you crazy 'Friends' fanatics.  Instead of Raymond, they're showing Friends at 6:30.

Joey: *bends over*  ""Ahhh!""
Chandler: *whispers to Phoebe*  ""What's wrong with him?""
Phoebe: *whispers back* ""Oh, um, it's sympathy pain.  You see, at first I thought it was sweet, but now I just think he's trying to steal my thunder.""

MUAHAHAHAHA :D

A hug goes out to the first person who guesses correctly the episode in which this snippet comes from *this should be easy as pie!*"

And that's going to end today because it's too beautiful outside to feel like crap and it doesn't feel nice feeling like crap for long anyway.  I've been able to calm down some and I feel much better now; I even feel like hugging a tree, heehee.

ANYWAY, over the weekend a mysterious cat started living in the garden centre at work O_O  I wasn't working on saturday but one of the girls called me and told me that a lady found this cat meowing underneath the car parked beside her in the parking lot.  She brought the cat to our garden centre and it's been ""living"" there ever since.  One of the guys at work gave the kitty some food and water and the kitty has been peacefully sitting down, lying down, and roaming around for almost 2 days now.  It's so puzzling because although we know the kitty is a house cat (he's way too friendly and tame to be a stray) we don't have a clue where he came from or how or why he's staying with us.  I was very apprehensive at first because I'm allergic to cats but I was actually okay yesterday.  Probably because I was with the cat outdoors and the air can circulate much better that way.  But there's still no way in hell I'm petting him (I'd rather not have rashes and hives all over my arms and face).  And the funny part was that we all thought that ""he"" was a ""she"" because the kitty's on the chubby side and we thought the kitty was pregnant (oops). >_<  And another funny thing is that he's afraid of shopping carts.  Everytime he hears a shopping cart approach he runs away and hides underneath the register, lol.

AND I'm so happy because my manager slashed off 2 of my shifts in these next 2 weeks!!! :D Now some people might get upset over something like this (less shifts = less money) but I'm actually WELCOMING this.  As it was originally planned out I was scheduled to work 6 shifts this week but now I'm working just 5!  6 shifts in one week is just too much, ya know?  I'm so excited because then I can have an extra few days to have fun and maybe plan a few outings with people.  YAY!!

And I went to the Promenade (sp?) Mall over the weekend and I found the cutest pair of pink and white converse sneakers.  I'm dying to get a pair and the pair I found was so cute because it had cute little patches and stuff on the side, but they only had them in kid sizes :(  But I stopped by First Markham to pick up dinner and I saw some more in pink, green, and blue.  They probably cost a fortune though :\  And at the same store they had this cool green and yellow Paul Frank beach bag in the window display.  It's such a pretty bag, but I don't know when or how I'd use it; I don't go to the beach :(  

Over the past week I was able to add 3 more Baby-Sitters Club books to my collection (#6, 7, 63), an new addition to the Care Bear family (Secret Bear) and 2 new lip glosses: Bonne Bell Lip Sparkler in 'Cotton Candy Clouds' and Bonne Bell Lip Lites in 'Cherry Bonbon'.  Yay!

And I had a really nice talk with one of the ladies at work.  I told her about my school and career situation fiasco and she felt so bad for me.  But she told me to stay strong and to not let it get to me or bother me or mess up my life.  After I graduate, I'm taking my parents advice and her advice and I've decided that I will MOST DEFINITELY take an entire year off to pamper and treat myself for all my hard work and travel the world.  I am SO excited about this.  I don't know exactly how many years of school are still ahead of me (it's still kind of up in the air; 2 if I'm just graduating with my degree, 3 or 4 if I decide to take the Seneca program or go to law school, I don't know yet), but all I know is that I'm going to work my butt off to save as much money as I can for this and I will have the time of my life.

Australia, Italy, and Disneyworld are officially on the road map ;)  More stops to come ;)"

"event","It must be the heat.  It has to be.  Even so, it's not a very good reason for everyone to be UP MY FUCKING ASS ABOUT EVERYTHING.  I was kind of sleepy when I got home from work today so I certainly was in no mood for my mother's fucked up attitude.  I get home and she starts bombarding me with my school/course enrolment shit.  She and my dad had made up a few timetables for using the courses I'd chosen (out of boredom I suppose) and I appreciate that, really I do.  What I DIDN'T appreciate was how my mother started getting on my case about when and how I was going to fit work into my schedule once school started again.  She asks me, ""What days are you going to work?"" and I, feeling a little tired and sluggish, shrugged and said, ""I don't know.  I'll look at it later and think about it.""  And she fucking starts hyperspazzing on me, going ""Your dad and I work on this for hours and all you can say is 'I don't know?'?!"" while at the same time shooting me dirty looks.  I then proceed to shoot HER a dirty look and then stomp and march up the stairs to my room where I hurl my work clothes at my bed.  Excuse me, but if I recall, I never ASKED you to look over my school shit for me and I never ASKED you to stick your nose into my fucking school business.  Oh wait, it gets better.

As I took the money tray from Sandra (the front end manager) this morning when I first got to work, she asked me, ""What time did you punch in?""  I tilt my head towards the punch card clock and said, ""According to that clock, 7:56.""  And she replies with, ""You know that you can't punch in too early, right?  No more than 5 minutes early, okay?"".  I then slowly walk down the stairs to the flower shop with angry steam slowly and silently seaping through my ears.  WHY THE FUCK IS EVERYONE AT THAT GODDAMN STORE GETTING ON MY CASE ABOUT GETTING TO WORK EARLY??????  >______<  What, would you rather me come to work late instead?  Excuse me for actually giving a shit about my job and wanting to be punctual and professional.  Excuse me for not getting to work at the exact second my shift is slated to start.  Not to mention ever since the store changed management everything has gone downhill.  They make us abide by stupid rules and they make us execute their dirty work (aka. paperwork) without paying us more AND they get up everyone's ass about the stupidest details.  Everything was perfect before they came and ruined everything.  The only thing that is keeping me here is the artistic aspect of floral design and the girls I work with.

Why can't everyone leave me the fuck alone?  I am not a child, I am not an idiot, and I am not a dumbass.  I don't need guidance and I don't need to be patronized, thank you very much.  I don't need people to 'help' me with anything and I can get on in life fine on my own.  I am much smarter than certain people give me credit for and if people don't appreciate me for the nice person that I am, that's their problem, NOT MINE.  Please don't think that because I'm nice you can take your shit out on me; that's what dartboards are for.

AND the back of my ankle is bruised because one of the girls accidentally rammed a shopping cart right into it last night and it hurt like a bitch for the rest of the night.

I am so glad this weekend is over.  And that felt so good to get out.  All that anger can now flush itself away and I can finally enjoy myself and be happy again."

"event","I swear, going shopping with my mom is sometimes so aggravating.  Usually it's fun, but maybe today I was just tired and sleepy and more impatient with her than usual.  It's not that she drags me into stupid stores or anything like that, it's just that she is the pickiest person in the entire world!  It's bad enough that she never buys nice things for herself but when she <i>does</i> want to actually shop and buy clothes and shoes and accessories, she never comes home with anything.  She'll constantly pick things off the racks, eyeball them a bit, and then put them back.  It's forever, ""Oh, this is too young, this is too old, this is too revealing, this stuff will hurt my feet, oh, you don't like it?  Okay I won't buy it then.""  Jesus christ, just buy something already! >___<  She is forever complaining that she doesn't have clothes to wear but when she drags me out to shop with her, she's like (in chinese), ""Mo yeh ho my"".  Um, yes there is mom, but you're just too darn picky.  GOD.

AND Toys R Us is having this AMAZING sale where you can buy a board game and get one FREE.  HELLO.  So obviously I'm twitching with excitement about getting Simpsons' Monopoly which I've been dying to get and Simpsons' Life.  I'm all ready to take the two off the shelf when my mom starts to leave.  I'm like, huh?  She goes, ""What's the point?  You're not going to play them.  It doesn't matter if it's a good deal.""  And I LEAVE WITHOUT MY GAMES.  I was thisclose to taking a temper tantrum.  Not only is the sale an amazing bargain but I've wanted this for so long and my mom knows this.  She's always telling me that I never spend enough on myself and that I should just buy the things that I like, yet she DOES THIS.  I am so upset.  I know people will probably think I am being stupid and trivial because it's just a board game, but those people don't understand because it's not just about the game.  It's about wanting something for so long and when you're finally so close to getting it that you can taste it, it's snatched right out of your hands.  I don't get it.  I'm not a bad kid.  All I want is a board game (which by the way I would've paid for on my own, so money is not the issue) and she won't let me buy it.  :(

But anyway, at least I was successful in shopping for other things.  I got myself a new hello kitty photo album (my cinnamoroll one ran out of room), 3 small bags of pony beads (a baggy of assorted hearts, a baggy of bright purple, and a baggy of yellow), a Bart Simpson book, stamps, and a package of manila envelopes.

And I'm looking forward to going out for dinner tonight for mom's birthday.  We're going to Kelsey's (yum!) so for those of you who were planning on going to the movies maybe I'll see you there ;)

And I've suddenly developed a fascination with product labels.  As in collecting them in pasting them in a notebook.  So far I only have 3, but I'm sure the collection will grow.  I have 2 aero chocolate bar labels (1 mint and 1 white chocolate) and the label from my Dole Cranberry Cocktail fruit juice bottle.  I also wanted to start my cosmetics scrapbook but I couldn't find the five-star sketchbooks at wal-mart today :(  They're my favourite.

And it's very hot and muggy and humid and hazy outside. :\"

"event","Good news!!  I just came home from my teeth x-ray appointment and I found out that I won't need to take out 4 wisdom teeth after all!  YAYAYAYAYA!!!!!  Instead, just the bottom 2...because I don't have any wisdom teeth on the top AT ALL.  My dentist was funny.  I asked her why I didn't have any on the top and she said, ""Your mom forgot to give them to you.""  LOL.  And when I told my brother when I came home he said, ""Good, only half the pain"".  haha.  I love him.

AND today is a wonderful day because I don't have work and it's the first saturday in a long time that I've gotten off without actually having to <i>book</i> it off.  
June is going to be so, so busy, but I'll try my hardest to get together with people, even if it's only for a few hours in the afternoon or something.  

AND the mail has been such a nice friend to me this past week.  I received:

x. my 5 Sweet Valley books
x. my Dessert Treats mini in Butterscotch Toffee (it smells and tastes delicious!) along with my scented Cinnamoroll memo sheets and Puerto Rico postcards
x. my ginormous postcard grabbie from the Laundro PIB (me loves them)
x. 2 magazines, old issues (Hilary Duff on Cosmogirl and CMM on YM)
x. 2 L'oreal CJ's in Bubble Gum and Cherry on Top, and my Bonne Bell Lip Shake Trio w/ tin

AND I dropped by Shoppers before coming home and bought 3 new glosses: Skittles liquid lip smacker in Tropical Fruits, Liquid Lip Smacker in Pink Lemonade, and Maybelline Shinylicious in Tickle Pink.

P.S.  Who wants to see Batman and/or Mr. and Mrs. Smith with me sometime this month? :)"

"event","<P>Happy Belated Victoria Day weekend everyone!! :)</P>
<P>&nbsp;<lj-cut text=""We are hotness""> </P>
<P><IMG src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v148/soda_fountain19/Laundro%20pics/mesally.jpg""></P>
<P>Miss Sally and I shared a romantic date last Wednesday; it was nice =)&nbsp; And according to her beloved Wesley, I'm not the white one or the brown one; I'm just ""boring"" chinese.&nbsp; You better watch your back, buddy.&nbsp; Haha.&nbsp; I had a good time and we'll definitely go Yorkdale/Eaton Centre shopping crazy sometime this summer, missy!&nbsp; </lj-cut> </P>
<P>My Victoria Day weekend was quite nice ^_^&nbsp; Let's see, on Saturday I spent the day with my family and grandparents and auntie-uncle-cousin and did I ever have a ball shopping that day.&nbsp; I visited the Oriental Centre mall in Scarborough and my grandma was so excited to show me this one store and OMG, it is amazing!!!&nbsp; It's a toonie store and everything inside&nbsp;costs a toonie (or loonie) and I found all this great stuff!&nbsp; I bought a&nbsp;few cutesy storage containers for my jewelry and lip gloss, this&nbsp;super cute japanese-looking toy with dangly string arms that jingle (it&nbsp;looks like baby blue poofy ball with a face and arms), a winnie the pooh tape dispenser and 4 rolls of decorative tape.&nbsp; AND I found a wicked cool stationery store where I picked up a letter set, an envie/memo set, and a mini memo pad.&nbsp; Then when we went&nbsp;back to my grandparents' place, my cousin, who's graduating out of elementary school (aka. gr.8)&nbsp;modelled her dress and shoes for us.&nbsp; The dress is gorgeous (a coral coloured halter dress with silver sequins) and it&nbsp;totally made me&nbsp;miss dressing&nbsp;up for big events&nbsp;this these.&nbsp; I would love to buy myself a bootiful dress to prance around in and cute heels to click around in, but I have&nbsp;no where to wear it to :(</P>
<P>Even though my day was fun, it was still soured by some&nbsp;yucky news I received that morning.&nbsp; I had just finished my biannual teeth-cleaning&nbsp;when my dentist told me some very unsettling news.&nbsp; I had taken a few x-rays just minutes before and my dentist&nbsp;called me over to look at them.&nbsp; And guess what&nbsp;she found.&nbsp;&nbsp;My freakin' wisdom teeth are growing horizontally!! &gt;___&lt;&nbsp; I have no choice but&nbsp;to get my 4 teeth yanked out of my precious mouth this&nbsp;summer.&nbsp; I am absolutely petrified.&nbsp; I was seriously hoping that I would be one of&nbsp;the lucky ones who wouldn't need to have her wisdom teeth taken out, but NO, my fucked up teeth had to ruin everything.&nbsp; I have another appointment this saturday to get another x-ray&nbsp;taken and if&nbsp;everything goes as planned, I'll be MIA&nbsp;for a week in late july.&nbsp; *tear*</P>
<P>To make myself feel better, I watched&nbsp;&lt;i&gt;13 Going on 30&lt;/i&gt; last night and it was a really cute movie, I enjoyed it very much ^_^&nbsp; The ending threw me for a loop at first, but it was a happy ending and that's all that matters.&nbsp; And just the other day, I found out that Nicole Kidman's &lt;i&gt;Bewitched&lt;/i&gt; will be coming out&nbsp;next month, in June!&nbsp; I had no idea it was coming out so soon.&nbsp; Why do&nbsp;all that cool movies have to come out in the same month??&nbsp;&nbsp;Why can't they spread them out a bit?&nbsp; Now I have 3 movies I want to see in June and I don't have a clue how I'm going to see them all, especially since&nbsp;my work schedule this coming month is&nbsp;scary.&nbsp; I'm working on average 5 days&nbsp;a week and they're not all baby shifts like 4 or 5 hours, half of them are my 9-hour shifts &gt;__&lt;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is going to take some serious planning.</P>
<P>Oh oh!!&nbsp; And yesterday and I watched&nbsp;Oprah with Tom Cruise and damn, is he ever HOT.&nbsp; He looks so good for his age and just watching the show yesterday made me like him so much more.&nbsp;&nbsp;He is such a nice guy and a real down-to-earth person.&nbsp; And&nbsp;he's crazy about Katie.&nbsp; I really wish them well, especially for&nbsp;him.&nbsp; He was so giddy and it's so wonderful to see a guy so head-over-heels.&nbsp; Speaking about guys, I read my 'love scope' in this month's Seventeen magazine for fun and this is what it said:</P>
<P>""The guy you have silently been pining over will tell you that he likes you too""</P>
<P>O_O&nbsp; Do I &lt;i&gt;ever&lt;/i&gt; wish this&nbsp;would come true.&nbsp; Because I am also stupid.&nbsp; And giddy.&nbsp; And giggly.&nbsp; Over HIM.&nbsp; I hate him.&nbsp; I want to smack him.&nbsp; More so than ever, I want to see him and be with him and tell him how cool he is.&nbsp; I just have to be patient.&nbsp; Which I'm having trouble being right now :&nbsp;\&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>

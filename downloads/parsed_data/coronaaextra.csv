"event","So I had an amazing conversation with Matt in the wee hours of this morning! I asked him if he ever feels like he is gonna be alone forever. He told me he does. I asked him if he would promise me that I would never end up alone. He told me that he promises. I dont know y but for some reason Matt always knows just what to say to me. So he asked me to tell him about my life. I vented to him completely. I told him everything because he is always so genuinely caring when he listens to you. He told me that I have to tell Sean that I love him because if I dont then he will never have a chance to love me back. Can anyone tell me why Matts advice is the only one that actually makes sense to me? I have asked people who know me and know Sean and know us together and noone told me anything that made sense. After we were finished with giving me advice we talked about how unhappy and lonely he is. It is a bit sadening for me to know that. I know how amazing Matt is. I did fall in love with him for god sakes. All he really needs is someone like me who is pushy and never gives up. He just has to find someone like me or me. He will realize it someday. I just wish there was something I could do. On another note I have this guy who is after me. It is so ridiculous. He is almost 30 and is not what I would ever date. He is always calling me and is just a bit overbaring. I guess I will just have to let him down easy. Sean is doing well by the way. He is so amazing! Now I just have to get some time with him so I can profess my love! Good luck me! I am still so terrified! I guess we will just have to see what happens!"

"event","For some ungodly reason I feel really shitty today! I think it is mostly because I came back home! When Im home I realize that everything really sucks! I am miserable in my own life! I hate having to put on a smile everday. I just have too much shit building up in my mind and it is driving me absolutely insane. I cant handle that Matt and I dont talk. I keep thinking and hoping that maybe I will hear from him. I dont! Sean is soooo confusing. I dont know y he makes me feel like this. I know that its love that I am feeling and it is making me crazy! I think about him when I am going to sleep and I think about him as soon as I wake up! I have to tell him. But how? I guess Ill figure it out!"

"event","So I am pretty much insane by now! I am sooooooooooo madly in love with a man its ridiculous! Sean is the most amazing person I have ever met. I dont know why every time I see him it gets harder. I have known him for 10 years you would think that I would just become immune to it. I didnt want to leave him saturday night. Im always scared that I will never see him again. Is that crazy? Im the idiot who wont just tell him I love him. I cant do it. I am so scared of what would happen. Im scared either way. He could not love me the same way which would crush me. Or he could feel the same way I do and that scares me too. If he loves me too then I will be happy and that is completly overwhelming scary to me. I guess that I will have to do something someday. I guess I just figure he will always be there. I know he wont though! I just really need to get this sorted out. He text me yesterday and asked me to go to a show with him last night. I couldnt cause by the time I got it it was 15 min before the show. I miss him terribly and its only been 2 days. I am pretty much insane by now!!!!!!! Im going to stop rambling."

"event","OK so not too much going on. I met a boy. Names Kevin. He is pretty amazing I must say. I dont know what it is about him but he drives me wild. He is in New Orleans right now. He is about to celebrate Marti Gras without me! I cant be mad though. I am mad that while he is gone for two weeks he hasnt called me or text me once. He is keeping me waiting. He knows me far to well already. I miss him terribly though. On the other hand I do get to make him suffer while I am in NY. Thats right NY the big apple. I am O so nervous about my trip. It should be fun though. I know you hate me Hannah but I must do it. I hope to see Matt. I am still unsure wether he and I will get to see each other. I do get to see Rocky though. I havent seen my favorite cousin in 2 years. I am going nuts. I cant wait. Well almost all is well. My Kevin situation could be better but thats how my life goes. The men in my life almost always suck with the few exceptions. Hopefully Kevin is one of them! I love you Hannah Chels Amber And Nikki!!!!!!!!!!!! By the way I love the Dane ROck Quotes. Very Hott!!"

"event","So I think that everyone knows by now that I have this incredible guy in my life who left me to be with his family. I am soon going to visit that amazing man. I am doubting myself a little. I am not just going to see him. I am spending most of the week with my cousin. I just get mixed signals from everyone in my life. I know I shouldnt listen to them and I should really juat follow my heart, its hard to do that though because my heart feels so strongly and my brain is telling it that its stupid. I think it is the best thing for me to do though. I need to see him I need to talk things over with him. I cant do it over the phone cause he is sooo difficult and when he calls me it is just so good to here how his life is that its hard to think about what conversation he and I really need to be having. I dont know I am just pulling an Amber on this and overthinking and now I am dreaming about it and worrying and thats not me. I really am just sick of the rain and on the verge of my period so everything feels 10x worse than it is!"

I got you a present though. I found my back up for marrige this week. I am stoked I have a backup plan. I am gong to marry Matt when I am 30 that is if Im not married by then. So he and I fought again the other night cause he is a deuche. Thats alright he basically told me that he thinks that he and I should be together and he wishes I would leave my life to be wtih him. He is on drugs cause Im so not ready to do that. I miss my sisters a lot, that is pretty much the only complaint I have for now. I am officially as of today a blentender! That means a raise soon! I am so stoked! I need it. i never have money. It doesnt help that gas prices are out of control. Well sisters i love you and will talk to you soon!!!"

I on the other hand have been told that he is right I am amazing by the people I love and they tell me that its his loss. I somewhat believe what they are saying, on the other hand he is so special and I dont want him to miss out on the amazing me and I want him to be in my life. I dont know, I guess it will just take some more thought. I will work on it and let you know what happens! I love you all and thanks for the call Chels. Sorry I didnt want to talk. I think it is just something Ill have to figure out on my own. Ill call you if I need someone though!"

Life is going alright though. Work is as good as it can be. I am still pissed at my manager half the time it is insane. I am still at home. I think im going to spend the better half of my life here. I dont want to leave. I fear eventually it would get awkward with the boys and such. I dont know. I think I just need something drastic. My life has become so boring. Nothing ever happens. I am in a rut with men. I am in a rut at work. I am in a rut at home. Will it ever change? I hope so cause I am mighty sick of this. Oh and by the way I love the Giovanni pic. He is oh so hot.

Ecspecially since he just drove across the country by himself. He makes me worry more then anyone ever has in my entire life.I am trying to pry myself from thinking about him being the one that got away and thinking he is someone special but I have to find someone that is really good for me. Its still upsetting.I guess Ill have to forget it like all other things. I miss my sisters so much it is rediciolus. I talked to Amber the other night though it was sooo relieving.

Although I dont talk to my real dad I got my step dad the best present and I love it too. Matt is going to N.Y. today. I am so excited for him to get back cause he is bringing me a present and I cant wait to see what he picks out for me. Also I am house sitting right now and I am having a good time doing it.

I dont know how yet but i am working on some sort of master plan to make him feel like shit. Just so he knows how it feels. I am back to work tomorrow. I am sooooo stoked. I miss work when i am not there. I have the best co-workers who ever lived i tell you. I have also decided that i want to move from this horrible state. I dont know when i dont know how but i know that it will happen sometime even if i have to bum it for a while. So anyway I will go for now and Chels i promise i will update more just for you!!!!!!!!!"

"event","Wow this is a record I think. I am pretty much the same as last time I wrote. I am shitty. I hate school and I hate Matt. The only thing really looking good in my life is work and I love it there so much that sometimes I wish I didnt have to leave it. My manager Connie is the most wonderful person I have met in a long time and is very supportive of me. She is so interested in me and my life it is unbelievable. You dont find people like her everyday and if I could I would never quit OJ so I would never have to have another boss. It is kind of sad that the only thing really keeping me going right now is work. I just sometimes think that all this shit isnt worth it and i should just become a drifter. Maybe I will hmmmmm I will think about it."

"event","Hello all! I know it has been awhile. I have been oh so busy with my wonderfully shitty life. I hate school more than anything I have ever hated. I love work although that is becoming shitty too. I work with this dick chad who acts like im some kind of retard. He never does anything takes longer breaks than he is supposed too and has a real attitude problem. I am also hating love and my social life. I hate love because I met this wonderful boy who I would love to be with and he seems to want to be with me but he has a lot going on and I can understand why he wouldnt ant to get into a relationship. I am hoping that sometime it can become more than this fucked up thing we have going on. My social life is horrible because basically most of my friends suck and can go to hell for now. I guess that is about it and I will probably update in a million years again!!!!!!!!!!"

"event","It has been awhile I know but I am writing now. So anywho life is alright but school sux a big one. I hate it here and everyone knows it. I cant stand it anymore. If I dont fail I think that i may take a break anyway just to see whats out there and for gods sakes rest.I feel like a zombie. Work is awesome I am getting a raise and probably a promotion. I have only been there three months and I am already doing better then the people that have been there for a year or more. I am also very frustrated w/ I guess what yo would call my love life. My old friend/ex boyfriend is back in my life and big surprise wants to get back together which is not alright with me. and being stupid me I actually told him how I love him but I could never be with him. He of course wants to be with me. I am hanging out with all my old friends though and it is soooo nice you dont realize how much you miss them until you get them back. I am also a little freaked out about my sister getting married but I know that she will always be there 4 me and love me so I really shouldnt freak out. well anyway there is a little lif update 4 you!"

"event","I am soo disappointed in these United states to even live here is a disgrace. I am ashamed to show my face to the world. The Monkey squirrel is back in office and it is time to move to Canada. What is so wrong with people that they feel that voting for an evil man is write? What is he showing other people that he is not showing me? I am not impressed by anything this man has done and anything he will do to this country will be horrible. What kind of conservative ass hole wont allow gay marrige. I dont understand hid reasoning for anything I guess beside the fact that he is a bithering idiot. I really dont want a man that can barely spit out a sentence running what is supposed to be a part mine. But on to other things I passed my Kines writen after my not so surprising breakdown. I have my practical tomorrow.Wish me luck I sure will need it. Besides that I am none stop thinking sbout Sean which is not unusual but I really need to stop. It doesnt make anything better me thinking and not doing anything. RRRRR he frustrates me soooo bad but it really isnt his fault. Oh well back to my crumbling world."

"event","I think I may be going insane. I have been thinking that for a while now havent I? I am just soo lost in my little Korri world that it is hard to know what is going on in my own life. I havent been sleeping well and I think it has to do with Sean for some reason. It is not only Sean though. It is really the whole thought of if he and I never end up together will I find someone as good as him. I dont know why I am thinking like this considering I am so young. My plan has always been to be married by at least 22 and I dont see that really happening which is scary and sucky all at the same time. I just want to get the whole thing over with so I dont have to worry about it ever again. I am going crazy at school. Work is fun but I am not getting shit for hours. I am excited to see Amber and Patti and Nick and My baby scruffie. That is what I have been looking forward to. I feel so bad that I just want to scream and then go to sleep,for a really long time. I really need a shrink or I just need to be closer to Amber. That is part of why I have such a hard time is because she really is the only person I can talk to and have understand me. N E way that is all for now."

"event","I am doing a little better now. I know that I realluy overreacted to the Sean thing. I tend to do that with him though. I always want him to be single and waiting for me to finally tell him how I feel. I guess he cant wait forever and I know that when shit happens between them it will be me picking up the pieces and in the back of my mind saying ""yes I still have a chance"". I am so glad that Amber is doing so well. It is her time to be happy even if it is not mine. I have been in extreme pain lately. I finally got pills for it though and it is helping. Well anyway school is alright and work is alright too. I wish I worked a little more but I am still training."

"event","Well it has been a while. I have been busy all week with school and various other things. I dont even know what is going on half the time. It is amazing how depressing it is when you are actually happy. I have been realizing this is the best time in my life and it sort of makes me sad. It makes me sad only because there is no one to share it with. There is no one to share it with because the only reason my life is good is because I am finding my self and it is so awesome. I have never had any experience like it. I am just in the most unusual mood. I have been thinking a lot about the fact that I dont date and that is only because my friends are constantly pushing me too. I finally realized that if I am ment to meet someone or be with someone it will come to me in time. For now I will just wait. I am having an awesome time at school and also at work. It is so nice to be in school and work again. I love having no time to do anthing. I have been thinking a lot about Sean lately and it is mostly because of my friend anna she always gets into situations that remind me of him.I really wish I could see him but when I see him it drives me insane even more than usual. I think that I will try to get ahold of him to at least see if he is still alive. But anyway I miss the girls. I really miss Amber I am just so lost not being able to talk to her. It is going to get even worse over the next year and that Kills me.Poor Patti and stupid ass Bentti he is a stupid monkey. I hope everything works out for them. Niether of them need this right now."

"event","I think I may be insane. I just met this guy and at first it was nice and now after only the second time of haning out I cant stand him. My mom told me I am too picky. I dont think that is a bad thing. I may be a little over critical of people. He just talks way to much and he is always trying to complement me which makes me think he is trying way to hard. I wanted to tell him honey I dont date so you are pretty damn lucky to be going out with me in the first place, you really dont need to try to hard. But then I am just sounding like a bitch. Where have all the normal guys gone? When someone finds them please let me know. Thanks"

I am starting work next week as well as school so I am going to be soo pooped. I am a little disappointed I didnt talk to Nick last night. When he called I was watching a movie and my phone was in the other room. I tryed to call him back but I think he may have been sleeping because he had work all day and then school last night.(poor guy) Hopefully we will talk tonight and hopefully Amber and I can talk also."

Not too surprised there. So I also finally checked my e-mail today and say my e-mail horoscope from 2 days ago right after I met Nick was talking about meeting my soulmate. I am a little freaked out now but he is cool and he will do for now. I also had an interview monday with orange julius and have a second one today. That I am leaving for soon."

I had one of those nights when everything is on your mind and you cant seem to get rid of it. I also got very irritated with John. He came home and was all pissy for no ungodly reason. Ihate it when he does that it makes me want to get out of here even more. Besides that when I got home I realized I had a rash all over my chin (yuck). I also have this bad cold, it just really wasnt my day yesterday. I hope to be updated on the situation between David and Mom tonight which should be interesting."

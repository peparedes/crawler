"event","Whoever said that Melbourne was a boring town obviously did not know Courtney's cousin. 

We got there around 7 and went out to Zack's friends houses and hung out. But then THE NEXT DAY Zack came into our room at 11 and yelled ""Tequila time!!!"" so yeah that got started. At around three we got a keg and there was a bunch of people there. I played basketball against this kid Blake and beat him, which was really funny. Then we danced for a little and the most gorgeous kids i have ever seen came over. They were down from San Clemente and they were sponsored by oakley and were here for a surf competition in sebations. They were really funny too, every single one said ""Star....rad name man!"" in a hardcore calli accent. Good times.

"event","The Titan Invitational Tournament was interesting.

Poletick and I did Public Forum on ""offshoring aiding in the benefits of the American Economy"" We got close to perfect scores and won every single preliminary round. Then we went against a group that was horrible and lost. The thing was, one of the judges from that tournament was talking to our opposition DURING our speeches saying things like ""you'll win - you got this"". So obviously Polly boy and I got really dsitracted and discouraged becaause, obviously, that's the worst thing a judge could do. Then we found out that she was actually a debate coach from Coral Glades! So Johnathan wanted to report her for during that during our speeches and after she told us that she was a coach her exact words to me were, ""your cross ex sucked."" Now obviously, I have worked so hard on this so that was horrible of her to say plus if i was in the quarter finals obviously i didnt suck! So then later we got our ballots and realized that every thing was rigged because Polly and I and the other top team (according to the ballots) were ""dropped"" ... but for no reason. Which is why Ms. Weber discouraged us from going in the first place - because that school hates Dreyfoos because we are their biggest competition so they cheat really badly. 

Anyway, everyone broke to semi-finals WHICH IS A HUGE DEAL and Jackie B. got 5th place for her OI!!!

We had such a good time! Yelling at people at McDonalds,singing Nsync, playing minesweeper, taking crazy pictures (will post later) and the list continues. BUT i have been up for over 18 hours so peace out hommies.

Yesterday Jackie and I made a decent amount of money putting up hurricane shutters for people in Olympia which is always good. 

Today I went to the beach with my family to look at the waves, it was RIDICULOUS. Then when the storm came Jordan, my aunt and I all took big black trash bags and held on to them while we sat on our skateboards. I have never gone so fast in my entire life, it was so much fun. Then the storm passed and Jordan and his friends needed an extra guy (girl) for football so I went and played with them and we were going to play two hand touch but there was so much mud and it was too fun not to play tackle.

She came home to visit today from her flight attnendant training and she came into my room and jumped on my bed with two bowls of ice cream and we just started blabbing on and on. I was telling her about all the stupid people at work and stuff and then she was telling me stories about her training, they were SO FUNNY. For her training she had to fly in the cockpit with the pilots and she told me that if the pilots start getting close to the ground and they don't put their wheels down the plane will start saying ""retard, retard, retard."" amd i thought maybe it meant something else so i asked her what that meant and she goes, ""its means, retard u are about to fucking crash the plane RETARD RETARD"" and i started CRACKING up. because, i mean moms dont really say things like that. And she told me about how her and her friend started laughing so hard during class that her friend Regina peed her pants and the instructor like secretely went to her bag and pulled out a hair dryer and gave it to regina and sent her to the bathroom. 

There are so many other hilarious stories but I don't feel like typing them. But this was the best bonding time i have ever had with my mom, I'm so happy she's clean and doing the things that she's always wanted to do. Im so mad though because tomorrow she leaves and i have to work so i wont see her :("

Day 1: Came home from Brandon's house and packed. Almost missed our flight but then arrived in Atlanta. We were really hungry so we changed our flight time so we could eat, then we headed towards the windy city. We got there and checked into our hotel and everything and met up at Shannon and Jenny's house. We went to Portillos which is this hot dog and beef place, if you have never had a Chicago hot dog you have never really lived cause they are SO good. Then everyone went home but I stayed with Shannon and we went to Kandice's house. Then these guys Steve, ST (he's african and his name is like 30 something letters long, so we just call him ST lol) and Nile (Another African name lol) called us and wanted to see if we wanted to go clubbing at this place called zero gravity, so we went. okay ST and Nile dance sooo good, they make Usher look like a white boy with no rythym haha. But it was really good to see them cause I've known them for a really long time and it was nice that they called cause they knew i was in town. Then Shannon met the love of her life, so i am happy for her :) Then around five in the morning we decided that since the birds were chirping maybe it was time to go home haha so we went home. 

Day 2: Got ready for Shannon's graduation, and well, went to Shannon's graduation. It was a nice ceremony outside and it was really sad cause Shannon took one of her balloons and let it fly up to the sky to her mom, and we all started crying. Then we went to eat and then we went to her mom's grave and shannon left one of the roses that she got in her boquet (sp??) at the grave sight. Then, we went to Brittany Highler's party and I got to see everyone that I haven't seen in a really long time which was great. Seriously, all of my Chicago friends were there. Then her party ended and we went to CJ's party, then to justin's party, then to some girl jennifer's party haha. At Jennifers two girls were fighting and one beat the shit out of the other, and well i just thought that was really funny. 

Day 3: Woke up at three in the afternoon and went out to eat with Josh while Shannon was at work. He's my buddy, i love that kid so much. The whole time we were throwing food and making fun of each other. He calls me a baby cause im fifteen and i call him a senior citizen cause he's twenty. (I know him cause he's shannons ex of like three years) Then we went to blockbuster to visit Mike. THEN we went to brianne's pool house (she is extremely wealthy) and met up with like ten people there. THEN we went to jay's house and he had a little party but Mike suggested that we went to China Town in the city to eat at three in the morning and kandice and i were like ""we want to go to China!!"" so Kandice, Shannon, Mike, Jay, Jerry and I all went and it was so much fun. Then we went to this little area with all the chinese signs and what they mean, (they were huge statues) so we all climbed on top of the bull one and took a picture and the cops came so we had to speed off really fast. i felt like i was in the movies cause then this old bum came over and started rapping (but realllllllly bad) about how he was ""needy so dont be greedy"" hahaha. And um then we went to jay's house and watched van wilder 

and walked up stairs and it was BRIGHT out cause it was so early so we went home. Then a few of them came over before i left to say goodbye and Shannon ended up having to work so Brittany and Mike drove me to the airport. it was the worst trip ever, my flights were delayed, so i missed my connecting flight, had to book another one. Then when i got to the airport in PBI finally, my moms co worker said she went home and left me her car and he handed me the key so i had to drive home and i just really wanted to go to sleep. But it was fun and im going back in probably like ten days for Shannon's graduation party. 

When i get the pictured developed I wll post them. :)

THEN we got to taco bell and we pulled in the parking lot to eat and these two guys walked over to our car and were just like hey what's up etc.... then SIMON (Jackie's best friend out of school, who I know really well cause he lives close to me...etc.) walks over to the car!

Friday I had my mom's car for a little while so Becky and I went to the beach and hung out for a little while, hopefully we are going to the beach tomorrow. 

Saturday the people doing my furniture came here from Melbourne. Tom is the builder, his wife's name is Dina, they have a seven year old girl, and one year old TRIPLETS. so that's three babies, the seven year old, jordan and chad all in one house. It was terrible. I went to Katie's for a little while and then came home. Yesterday I went to Courtney's house cause they were having a barbeque. We went four-wheeling...i cannot wait until it rains, we are going mudding!! yay!! We watched a movie and that was that. Today we woke up, her mom brought me home and I went to the gym for a little bit. Took Chad to the pool and that's about it. Hopefully later Katie will  be coming over, if not I am going to her house. 

CHI TOWN SATURDAY FOR SHANNON'S GRADUATION. MOMMA JUST TOLD ME.

It's weird not talking to her, she deserves it. 

This song was on when i was driving her home from the hotel:
silhouettes above the cradle hold me down
they won't let me go the wrong way
my mother taught me all the fables, told me how
in the end all the sinners have to pay 
but...

i don't wanna live like my mother
i don't wanna let fear rule my life
and i don't wanna live like my father
i don't wanna give up before i die

he worked so hard his bones are breaking
he wore them down but long ago he lost the feeling
his good intentions leave me shaking, show me how
i don't ever want to end up like he did
and...



when i have kids
i won't put any chains on their wrists, i won't
i'll tell them this
there's nothing in this world that you can't be if you want it enough"

She is never going to get better. I am never going to depend on her like other people depend on their mothers, and i have to accept that. And he is never going to call on our birthday's or even to say hi, and i have to accept that. But the first one of the two is hurting me one hundred times more. Out of all the help she has gotten and all of the places she has been sent to, none of those things will last. and that fucking sucks. i try to say to myself ""18 and you're out of here"" but just because i can leave doesn't mean Jordan and Chad can, and that pains me so much. I need to be here for them, and I need her to get better. And only one of those two things will ever happen.

"event","I had more fun yesterday then I ever have had...on a Monday. In first hour we watched a movie on the atomic bomb, you would think we would be reviewing considering our AP exam is tomorrow...but eh...I guess not. In debate, Brittney and I almost finished our Public Forum speech in 30 minutes which means no homework. WOO GO US! Then lunch was, well there was food so that's always good. Then onto study session for AP. Even though we didn't learn that much it was still a lot of fun. I was in a group with the loud Katie Johnson, Giggly Jana Krumholtz, and Crazy Leah Norris, so of course we had a good time. Mr. West saw that we were working in a group together so he said we had to go first to answer the questions from the practice test that we had. So we all worked really hard on the first five, and then 5 minutes before we were supposed to go up he tells us that they will be a RANDOM 5 questions so we just startd cracking up. We went up there and got one or two out of five right, so Jana had to do ten push ups. HAHAHA. Then we sat in the back of the auditorium and goofed around and yelled out obscene things the whole time. :) Fun Fun Fun. Then after school Mr. Stewart and Mr. Bryant came over and we had dinner. Ben left, and Jackie and I hung out. Then he left and I realized that I am supposed to be having a notebook check in spanish today, problem was i didnt even have my notebook so i stayed home today and studied a little bit for AP.

Oh yeah! I painted my room this really pretty blue color, and I love it."

The whole day we have been loading, unloading then re-loading the planes, making calls with the pilots, marshalling the plane in, checking people in...and suprisingly it's kind of fun. I don't know the thought of talking to someoene on a walkie talkie wgile they are in the air and telling them if they can land...etc. is just pretty cool. But i threw out my back in the belly of the plane (again) cause u have to bend over in there to put all the bags on the plane. I'm ready to go home though.

Joshua died last night. 

Cancer and anyone is never a good combination, but especially when that someone is 11 years old. 

I found out right before I went to school and I got there and realized I couldn't deal with it all. When Jordan got home I couldn't stop crying becuase I couldn't imagine what it would be like to lose him.

Everyone pray for Joshua's family, he has seven siblings and no mom."

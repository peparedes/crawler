"event","Mmmmm.. lots going on lately...  So my computer crashed, well sort of, but luckily by God's grace Paula's brother was able to fix it, and it is up and running again.  So that is definitely a blessing!  Second, my first retreat was this past Friday night and I think it went pretty well.  I didn't really know how to feel after it was all over.  I didn't know what to expect and I wasn't sure how it went.  However, after talking with some of the girls and hearing how much they enjoyed it, I am coming to find that it went really well.  I just pray that the Lord reached each one of the girls that attended and that they would open themselves up for Him to work in their lives.  I really need Him to work in my life as well.  It is so ironic how I am leading this retreat and trying to encourage others to seek the Lord's will in their dating lives, and yet I am struggling with that so much.  I honestly don't know if I am ready to date again or not... I really want my focus to be on the Lord right now, and I don't want boys to be a distraction, but then again, I don't want to miss out on an opportunity to get to know someone, because I am so guarded and afraid.  Even though I am so outgoing and bubbly most of the time, I am so afraid to seriously put myself out there and become vulnerable.  I just really need to pray and be patient."

"event","Not really feeling like myself lately....  So basically today I was super emotional and felt like crying.  I know that I am really stressed about my classes right now... but usually I keep it together better than this.  So that wasn't fun.  I guess one thing that is really bothering me is the fact that I really don't know what I want to do with my life.  I chose this crazy major that I thought was something I could possibly want to do, but in reality I am wondering if it is just all about the challenge to me.  Do I really enjoy it? Or do I just really like the challenge of it?  Because when it comes down to it, this is something I am going to be in for a long time... and I need to decide if I am really happy.  I talked with my Mom about it and she said that my uncle ironically just sent a magazine to the house for me with careers for stats majors... so I dunno maybe this is the Lord telling me to stick it out.  I really do want to do His will and I am trying not to be selfish about this... but it is hard.  So that is really all...."

"event","So spring semester started... and well, to be honest I am so not ready for it.  I swear every single one of my classes is in some way based around computers and that completely freaks me out.  So we will see how this goes.  My schedule itself isn't that bad.  In fact, I get home a lot earlier this semester and one of my classes is online (which I was unaware of... haha), so that is nice.  
But even though I am not really all that excited about school, I am really excited for other things.  I am leading a girls retreat this semester (2 actually), and I am so blessed that the Lord has allowed me the opportunity to do this.  The retreat is titled ""How to date, have fun, and still remain pure during the best time of your life... your college years.""  Haha, and if anyone knows me, they know that I think about dating and all that junk a whole lot, and since being in college, the Lord has really changed my perspective and taught me a lot about that subject.  At first I was really nervous presenting the idea to the girls in my sorority, but I could not believe the reaction that I got.  So many girls were sincerely interested and I honestly can not wait to share this experience with them.  The retreat itself is going to be amazing, and what the Lord does with it will be even more amazing!  We are going to talk about some pretty interesting stuff.... like what the Bible says about sexual purity, relational intimacy, setting bounds in your physical relationship, the man of Godly character, the wife of noble character, the art of attraction, and the art of dating.
Going along with this whole dating thing...  I guess for the first time in a long, long time I am finally ready to be back in that scene again.  In the past year and a half, God has just been amazing!  My standards have completely changed and although dating is still scary, I see it so differently now than I did back in high school.  Haha... so news for all of you.. I am back on the market.. jk jk! But we'll see what the Lord has in store.. He's still at work... and that's the biggest challenge right now... waiting on His timing!"

"event","Wow so break has been amazing!!!!  Christmas was tons of fun and yeah a lot has happened since this last time I wrote in this little guy.  Ummm let's see... my little sister got a new car.... yay!  But anyways, umm New Years I went downtown to Friendship Fountain and hung out with a bunch of friends and watched fireworks and such!  Then I slept all New Years Day bc I didn't get in until like 5 AM, which Mom and Dad thought was pretty funny for little miss oldtimer.  Monday I hung out with my fav gals.  Me, Danielle, and the Jessica's went and saw retarded Wolf Creek... which is so dumb.. don't go see it.  Then we went back to Casa de Lodge and layed around and talked for forever.  Today I went to lunch with MB and Vonnie.  We def had a three hour lunch catching up on old times... ahh fun!  And then tonight I went over to Danielle and Jessica's house again and we definitely dug out all of our old cd's and tried to remember our competition routines... haha It was so much fun!  Crazy thing, Danielle remembered like every dance... hmmm I guess that's why she was the captain.  I think tonight for the first time... I actually missed high school... hmm weird.. never thought I would say that.  So it is almost time to go back to school, and a part of me is really excited about that.. and on the other hand I hope I am ready to tackle another semester.  But I have a lot to get excited about... I am leading a retreat this semester.. which is going to be awesome.. bc the Lord is awesome and I know He is totally going to work through me!  I think I am heading back on Saturday.... I want to get my hair done tomorrow ......hmm random thoughts.... gosh I have a lot on my mind.... okay well I think that is all for now....."

"event","Wow, I can't believe I am already about a week into the break.  Time is going by so fast, but I am having a lot of fun!  Monday night I went out to dinner with Jess and Danielle, and got a chance to catch up with the old gang.  Then we went and saw ""The Family Stone,"" which was okay, but a little disappointing.  Tuesday I went downtown with my sis and we just walked around and talked and took stupid pictures... haha it was a very random day.  Then, when we got home my Mom told us that her doctor called and they found questionable material in her left breast and she needed to come in right away... so being the little worry wart that I am, I immediately freaked out.  I honestly was so scared.  So Tuesday night was definitely spent in prayer.  By God's grace on Thursday, we found out that the questionable material is a cyst.  So that was a huge praise!  The Lord is AMAZING!!!!!  So Thursday, Thursday... yeah what a bad day!  I found out that I didn't get the internship I applied for, but compared to Mom's situation, that seemed so insignificant.  So yeah,.. Thursday night I really disapointed myself.  On Sunday Danielle and I had made plans with Brad and Dustin for Thursday night.  They were supposed to make us dinner and we were gonna make them dessert.  So we get out there and there was a slight change of plans, but we went with it and I don't even know...... but all I can say now is that obstacles that I thought I had once conquered resurfaced big time and I really let myself down.  Here I was screwing up big time after the Lord had so graciously blessed me.  I felt so low.  I am still trying to forgive myself, but my devotional today definitely helped to gain a new perspective of Christ's love.  This one particular quote helped me to feel a little better... ""God's love will heal your emotions, raise your self-esteem and put a foundation of self-worth and dignity under you.""  It is still amazing to me that God loves me no matter what I do....."

"event","So Christmas break has finally arrived and I am home at last.... Yay!  So, I got back to Jax on Friday night and didn't really do too much.  Watched ""A Charlie Brown Christmas"" with my Mom.. haha.. and then hung out with my brother.  We had ourselves a crazy little adventure... it was quite fun.  Then, Saturday I slept in until like 12:30 PM for the first time in forever.. and let me just say that it was AMAZING!!!!!  So then I got up and worked out and showered.. and then Danielle and I went out to dinner and went back to her house to watch a movie with Jessica and Josh.  Today, I got up and went to church and then went out to lunch with Kathryn and my sister.  Then Mom and I spent the day shopping, which is always fun.  Funny story....We were in this one store and my Mom picked up this men's shirt and was looking at the size, and then she said ""4X... Who in the world wears a 4X?""  And as she is saying this, this huge man walks right by and looks at her.... It was sad... but freakin hilarious... we laughed so hard!  I love my MOM!!!!  So later we came home and grilled out with the rest of the fam and then I met up with Danielle.  We headed out to Jax Beach and went over to Dustin and Brad's apt.  Haha we had a good time... I haven't laughed that hard in a while.  Those boys are crazy!  We stayed out there for a good while and then headed back to the cove, which brings me to now.... yeah and I am one tired little chick... so I should probably head off to bed... Mom is teaching me how to make a seven layer dip tomorrow... Yay!  I am learning to cook!!!!"

"event","So one week from today I will be back home to rest for three weeks.  That sounds amazing right about now!  Haha but I still have to make it through next week, which is gonna be a little rough.  Yeah so today was a pretty good day... I got a little bit of studying in and got a few other things accomplished.  I just finished having my quiet time, which was wonderful!  I am really beginning to enjoy reading my Bible and I have recently started a prayer journal that has definitely been good for me!  One big prayer request for tonight is my little Hannah Banana.... she was in a lot of pain earlier today and she said she was going to go to the doctor, but we haven't heard from her and it is getting a little late.... I really want to drive down to Orlando, but I am just trusting that the Lord is taking care of her!  Anyways,..... I probably should get to bed, because I am planning on spending the whole day at the Christian Study Center tomorrow.  Fun stuff, huh?..."

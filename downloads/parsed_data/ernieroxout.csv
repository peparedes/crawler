"event","Consider me a conceited, vain little twat, but OMG. I love my iPhone so much. Jeff was completely right... I finally found something that I love more than my cat... (although, I'm uh, pretty sure the novelty should fade and she'll probably be back in my attention span any day now.) 

I'm also a little twat who's late to the party. Yesterday, when I was rhapsodizing about the iPhone's ability to make a ringtone out of any part of a song, even Jim, who I'm convinced orbits around a different planet and has no awareness whatsoever of any current/pop culture stuff, already knew about it. But seriously. I don't know if you've heard, but you can take snippets of any song, up to 30 seconds, and basically create your own ringtones in this little editor. 

Guess who now owns ringtones from three different parts of Ben Folds' cover of ""Bitches Ain't Shit."" 

And the brilliant thing is that you have to buy the song from iTunes, then you have to pay 99 cents for the ringtone after you've made it. So, if it's not a song you already own, you're out $1.98. And here I am, foaming at the mouth, arranging the little sliders to just the right part of the song and absolutely bubbling over with glee when I finally nail it. Only 99 cents to sign, seal and deliver this little gem I created? Sure! Take my credit card, Apple. Go buy yourself something nice. I'll be here when you get back, making ringtones. 

Apple is the smartest company in the world. 

It's not like I leave the house, but now I've got two different robots on which to check my e-mail! What if someone e-mails me while I'm downstairs in the kitchen? iPhone will tell me! I don't have to run up to the computer! (Sad truth: the person who has e-mailed me the most since I got my iPhone is... me.)

Another grand revelation: the ear buds (those little iPod ones) that come with the iPhone have a MICROPHONE ON THE WIRE. I grabbed them in the dark and didn't know what the hell it was. I thought it was one of those stupid little sliders that keeps the two wires together and goes up and down. I even tried picking it off but I would've been very sad if I had succeeded. It's like one of those douche-bag-a-licious Bluetooth headsets, only now I can be a total hipster in my hoodie, pretending I'm listening to an iPod and talking to myself, only I'll really be on the phone talking to someone. 

This is a mega money-saver because come January, phones have to be hands-free in the car. I know it's illegal to drive with headphones on, but these are ""ear buds"" and I don't have to stick them both in my ear. Brilliant. Not to mention that I already have a Bluetooth headset that I bought on a whim but... they really are the epitome of douchebaggery. Even though I opened it and used it, I still have the box so I'm just going to exchange it at Office Depot for some sweet-ass toner and pretend I lost the receipt. 

Man, I lead a thrilling, thrilling life. But seriously... iPhone is the gadgetiest gadget I've ever used. It's smarter than I am and twice as pretty. It also sings the intro, the chorus and the bridge for ""Bitches Aint Shit."" Did I mention that? It also plays me Borat when I'm at the gym. It also... it also... *brain short circuit*

Don't worry, I don't need my brain anymore. iPhone's got it covered. 

The only problem is, this hasn't led to an exponential increase in people calling me. So c'mon folks. Don't you want to hear how beautiful I sound talking on an iPhone?"

"event","That's why I haven't been on LJ. I had a baby. 

It was born today at 12:53 p.m., August 15th and weighs a hefty 202 pages, 56,587 words. 

I haven't named it yet, so hold off on all the personalized presents for a bit. The character's name is Meg, though. I guess that would look good on a silver pictureframe, or something. 

In case you're wondering, I'm concurrently also carrying one that's 25,000 and change. He's taking a little longer to bake and, frankly, I'm kind of sick of him. However, he is a serious ""literary"" novel and I have to soldier on in the name of literary fiction. His name is Alex. 

Recently added to my nursery has been a whopper... 64,000 and change of chick lit. The plot on her is so messed up that I've put her away, happy to never look at her again. Even though she's a great idea, her name is Claire and she'll drag me to the first edit kicking and screaming. 

Addie, my oldest novel is bouncing from literary agent babysitter to babysitter. I'm still getting responses to my page-long query letter... the one I sent out in April. So... responses to the full-length manuscript have been... slow. 

Now all I want to do is edit the new one. 

If I take the time to finish the serious literary work, then I'll have THREE books. Three books that need a first edit. 

Because, like I heard a literary agent say on a blog... ""A first draft is something that you don't even want to show you dog.""

I've also added to my brood a children's book for autistic readers (Dennis) and a children's book just for the fun of it (Hailey). 

And I haven't started sending the children's books out, really. I'm meeting with an editor from Chronicle Books to talk about them when I go to the Yosemite Writer's Conference next weekend. See if she says anything good. I'm also meeting with a YA editor from HarperCollins. Sorry, did that drool soak through to your screen or is it just on mine?

I've joined an online writer's workshop. (http://www.internetwritersworkshop.org)

I'm slowly trying not to drive myself insane with all this writing. So far it's looking good. Next week I think I'll start editing Meg. She's ready. I'm ready. I won't need to overhaul the entire plot like I did with Addie, like I'm going to have to do with Claire. She's solid, straightforward and clean, for once. 

I think that this novel-length manuscript, my fourth, I've finally got an idea of the scope, the whole point of writing a novel. Jesus Fucking Christ. It's not just a lot of typing, I'll tell you what. My first was like 90,000 words of PURE BULLSHIT, hahaha. That one's not even mentioned above. La, la, la. It's 1:05 and I've been so busy writing that I've forgotten to eat."

"event","Today my little LaCie drive crashed. I was updating it and dragged it to the trashcan to eject it. The drive disappeared off my desktop and I counted down ten seconds and unplugged the drive. Then my computer said: You unplugged a device that you didn't eject. There are dire consequences. 

I did too eject it!

So, then my computer wouldn't recognize the drive and everything I tried to do to bring the drive back made my disk utilities crash. So... no drive. 

Now, I just have to say... nobody cares how many novels I've written if the files disappear in a hard drive hiccup and are gone forever. Until I get published, all my hard work depends on little 1's and 0's. And it's terrifying. So... if I know that I'm without a backed up version of my work, I run to my external hard drive. 

Immediately, I went online and found a good deal at Best Buy. The LaCie drive had been $99 for 80 G. This Seagate drive was $84 for 120 G. I only have a 60 G hard drive, so... you know... more than enough memory. 

This way, I could also take all the movies Jeff has ripped for his and my iPods off my computer hard drive... they take up half my disk. 

So, I ordered it online for an in-store pick up at the Best Buy down the street. I gave them my credit card and waited for the e-mail that said... go get it! 

I went. I got it. I came home. They charged me for the 120 G hard drive and they put the 250 G hard drive in my bag and sent me home with it. 

Despite a pang of guilt, I am now putting my files on my 250 G hard drive. Was I wrong?

"event","I'm still thinking about this Totally Joe book. It's a YA novel and it has the coolest little thirteen year old boy. He's gay, that's just the way it is. The book isn't a catalogue of his harrowing coming out experience, it's a book that celebrates him. What a smart and courageous fictional character. 

Man, this may be an odd thing to say, but I hope that when I have kids, if there's a gay kid floating up in pre-life Heaven and whoever decides what parent gets what kid is stuck for a place to send him or her, I hope they get sent to me. 

There's so much drama out there and too many horrible parents (Dick Cheney, hellooooo) getting gay children. If the kid-deciding diety wants to give a gay boy or girl a cakewalk and super hip family, send them down to me. I'd love to have a geeky, diverse and totally nerdy family... because that's the best kind. And I'll be a lot nicer to artists than my family, even though both of the people in my family... are... artists. *brain explodes*

The one thing I don't want, never ever ever, is a popular child. Please don't send me the popular babies, I think I'll seriously beat them.

I would be on my second downward facing dog in yoga class right now, except I have to sit here and wait for Comcast to fix our broke-ass internet. We have MetroFi, which is decent... I am posting right now, so it works, but it's way too slow. 

I'm going to dust off one of my yoga tapes and do that instead, and then catch class at 3:45 today. 

It's been so long since I've let myself sit around and do <i>nothing</i> that I'm not very good at it. I guess I can eat some yogurt and take a shower, too, so that will keep me occupied. 

Next week I want to dive into a book I've been writing, chick lit, and I want to just get back on the creative side of writing. Not the revisions side. Revisions are awful. Revisions make my soul bleed. I'm so sick of revisions that it hurts. 

I want to be writing again. See, I really know that I'm on top of my game writing-wise when lines float through my head. There have been times this year when I feel like a freakin' conduit, like a lightning rod. I'm always thinking of stuff and then I have to write it down, no matter where I am. That's why I got a cork board, so that I can stick all my ideas on there. 

These last few months, though, when I've been busy with the actual business/submissions end of it, I haven't gotten that. At all. It makes me feel like poop. 

I need to work less and write more. Which, unfortunately, means less money, but I've got to find a way to cut some students out of my schedule and free up some more time. 

Next week I'm starting in earnest again. I'm very excited. But for today, I guess I can just let myself turd around. 

Also, I am having cold sweats because I want this coffee drink from Barefoot Coffee Roasters so bad. Friday, my pet, Friday you will drink all the Dark Voodoo you want."

whole foods bill - $14.35
(laxative tea, cayenne pepper, grade B maple syrup and one smelly-ass wedge of brie that i can eat today to send myself off!)

COSTCO BILL BABY!!! - $12.98
(lemons are $1 everywhere else but here i got 20 lemons for $6 and change)

safeway - $4.32
(for a citrus squeezer deal)

the only other expenses i can see is one more bottle of maple syrup for $5 something and another $12.98 for lemons.

i have been accepted by seven journals, and i have been rejected by seven journals. 

i have been rejected, and then accepted by one journal. 

i have been rejected by one journal twice, and boy are they gonna be sorry later. 

seven journals. eleven poems total. 

my mom has been telling people i've had thirty poems published for like, six months already, so i'm catching up, slowly but surely. this sunday i think i will get back to sending stuff out. it's a lot of fun.

"event","i have the best boyfriend in the world. la di da, best boyfriend in the world. 

valentine's day was the best. we took it real mellow-like. first, we cooked delicious pasta with sausage and shrimp. it was the best thing i've ever eaten, until the next time jeff cooks something. 

then we drank wine (way too much wine) and ate ben and jerry's ice cream. 

i set up a bunch of candles and roses and stuff upstairs, and we went and exchanged gifts. jeff got me roses. 

he also got me <i>the universe is a single atom</i> by his holiness the dali lama, because we'd just watched cry of the snow lion, a documentary on tibet. 

he also got me <i>traveling mercies</i> by annie lamott, who we're going to see in march at the herbst theatre (!!!)

AND he got me a wine cube, from target, because one of the chapters in my book is called ""thinking outside the wine-in-a-box"" 

AND AND!!! snakes on a plane on dvd!!!!

it was the best.

for him, i put together a tiny little hardcover book of poems i'd written and some pictures and stuff, and published it using <a href=""http://www.lulu.com"">lulu.com</a>. it was awesome. and i got him the beck cd. 

it was god damn gorgeous and awesome and brilliant."

here i have written a poem about what i did today. 


<i>embers of pain</i>
by mary kolesnikova

oh sweet core-needle biopsy
a stinging needle in my boobie
the hurt killed me dead,
i'll wear a sports bra to bed
but at least it inspired
some poetry


actually i don't really write like that, but i DO have to wear a sports bra to bed. 

i have a tumor in my boob, and i had to get it checked today to figure out if it's a happy tumor or a sad tumor. luckily, most of the tumors that boobies my age get are happy tumors. 

it didn't hurt that bad, nothing $20 worth of chinese delivery couldn't fix, but i would've liked at least a honorable mention vicodin prescription out of the deal, but no dice. 

actually, the guy showing up to my door and saying ""chinese food?"" was worth everything."

it's the 24th (for me still, in hawaii because of the two hour time difference) and i have logged 40,832 words. 

does it still make me a writer if the only thing that gets me up in the morning is having a little thing online where i can update my word count? i don't have that this month because it's no longer nanowrimo, and i feel like it's made writing a whole lot more difficult. 

because it's a young adult novel my aim for the number of words is a little lower... so i don't totally, like, blow their little adolescent minds. i'm aiming for 60,000 before rewrites, 55,000 or even 50,000 after. i'd be a happy lady if i reach 65,000. which, judging from the creeping boredom that i get whenever i'm around my parents, may actually happen.

yeah, like for instance did you know that (my favorite) gewurztraminer and other white wines like chenin blanc and riesling are so sweet because of botrytis cinerea... a fungus that grows on the grapes and concentrates the sugars?

that claret just means a bunch of red wines and isn't an actual recognized term?

that some board made up the word 'meritage' to mean a mix of bordeaux wines in 1989? 

that there's a pinot noir, a pinot blanc, a pinot gris, a pinot meunier, a pinot nero and OVER A THOUSAND OTHER GRAPES IN THE PINOT FAMILY?!?!

did you know that spain and france and italy all have crazy fucking names for grapes that i've never even heard of????

the week after thanksgiving i went out and got myself thank you notes to keep on hand as well. 

when big things happen in my life and invitations or announcements need to be sent out, they will be sent out with pomp and care on the most exquisite stationery that you have ever seen. 

i don't know what it is, but there is such solace and warmth in writing and mailing a card. 

when i was mailing graduation announcements i relished putting them all together. they were my idea and i was an exacting little bitch about it.

i could spend six hours in a papyrus store poring over stationery catalogs and still be excited about all the little papers and colored inks and envelopes lined with fancy designs... 

the best gift that someone will ever get me is a set of completely custom thank you cards. hundreds of them so i always have a card or two on hand. 

in trying to cultivate a greater sense of gratitude and peace in my life, i have found that physically writing a thank you card is a big step in the right direction. i want mountains of them. i want to exhaust people with my floods and torrents of daily-arriving thank you cards. i want to resurrect the postal service with my constant patronage and need for stamps!!!!




but i think i need to work on my horrible penmanship first. the cards may be lovely but i write like a sixth grader."

i took smokey to the vet this morning to get her check-up and her shots and i wanted to be super nerdy and thorough, so i dug up her old paperwork from the humane society to bring with me so they could see what other vaccines she already had. there was a line there that i never noticed:

estimated birthday: 1/15/98

i had a strange hunch so i went digging through my livejournal to figure out when i had adopted her and BAM!

day i adopted smokey: 1/15/06

this makes me absolutely giddy. i only just realized it, but i had given this little baby cat a really fabulous birthday last year. now i think i'll celebrate every january 15th because it's the day that smokey was born, and then eight years later would end up in my life. 

the doctor says she's doing really, really well. she was an absolute darling at the appointment, everyone loved her. the only note was that she's gained about two and a half pounds, so i should only feed her at night. i think sushi could benefit from this dietary restriction as well. when i adopted her, you could feel her little ribs though her skin she was so thin! 

so... one month and one day until smokey's birthday and i just absolutely love this silly little cat! she is the light of my life!"

one from this two day a week position, really casual, 11-4 at what turns out to be the most bomb and expensive restaurant ever... one day during the week, one saturday. they think i sound like a great match and i have an interview tomorrow at 10. 

another from the princeton review. i took their online application fake SAT yesterday and i got an 84% which i thought was particularly shitty, but apparently it's test season and they're desperate. they called in a mad rush and said... short notice... we want you to interview tonight at 6 and then you can start training tomorrow. 

miraculously, all the times they need from me worked out perfectly and i said, ok. i'll do the interview tonight. 

it's an ""audition"" (score) where i have to get up and ""teach"" something for five minutes. she said that stuff like teaching how to fold a paper airplane was bad, since they just have to mimic, and i can't fold a paper airplane anyway. she also said to talk about something interesting but to stay away from the academic. 

ok. sure. i know <i>exactly</i> what something like that might be. uhh...

so i was standing in despair by the bookcase in the bedroom just staring blankly. then, suddenly, i realized that i could put one of my most underrated talents to use!

tonight i will be teaching a five minute seminar on <b>reading poetry pretentiously</b>. 

five minutes only! be there, be there, be there!



hopefully they'll like me for my cheekiness and my confidence for doing something as retarded as that, and maybe even laugh once or twice...

my workshop is going to focus on the idea that the poetry itself doesn't matter, it's how you do it. there are three critical tenets to my pretentious poetry philosophy:

1. poetry stance
2. dramatic poetry gesture
3. poetry face

this will allow me to draw on the board, which is advised, as well. 

then i will use my techniques to deliver a hideous looking and ridiculous rendition of a short children's poem.

if there is anyone here that has good reason to not allow me to make a fool of myself, speak it now or forever hold your peace. otherwise, i'm doin' it! i'm so excited!

so... if both things miraculously do not hit rock bottom (and i'm definitely taking a risk or two and erring on the side of retardation) then i will be rolling in moola and i won't need any more students! huzza!"

not to mention this guy is like a hoover at restaurants and you're lucky if you end up with a third of your own dessert when he's done. but no. this holy ham and cheese breakfast bagel is the limit. 

i want some time in new york city without parents breathing down my neck and calling me selfish when i want to do something by myself. like go to adorable german bars.

i never thought myself the kind to really say this, but seriously, i'm too old for this shit. 


and for those of you keeping track: 65,617 words today beetches. <a href=""http://www.nanowrimo.org/userinfo.php?uid=138262"">take a look at my profile</a>, the bar graph doesn't know what to do with itself."

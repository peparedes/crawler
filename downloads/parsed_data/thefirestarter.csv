"event","My mood is very easily influenced, especially by key people. 

I fixate on things.

<b>I am terribly, deeply insecure. </b>

I am the worst kind of perfectionist. The lazy one. My laziness stems from a lack of confidence in myself so fundamental that I set myself up for failure to give myself something else to blame my failure on (procrastination, something circumstantial). 

I have a disgusting fear of being irrelevant, of not being sought after. It makes me feel worthless. I'm embittered. I think I'm really special and have a lot to offer people, but nobody cares, so therefore I'm worthless. Who wants someone who makes no effort and is mediocre anyway? 

And it's not like I'm fishing for compliments. Any compliments I do get look like lies to me.

I love myself a lot sometimes, I think I'm pretty cool, but I don't think anyone loves me to the extent that I can love someone, and I feel like I deserve it sometimes. And it's not fair. 

Putting it all out like this makes me sound so stupid. I am stupid. I should just focus on how good it feels to do things for other people. That's a very nice feeling, even if it isn't reciprocated. Just bring happiness to others. 

I just can't get over how empty and alone I feel though. 

I said to the man I love the other day, ""I am not going to reach out to someone who is OK watching me drown.""

He said ""I am not reaching out to someone who purposefully drowns themselves.""

I don't want to drown. I told him. 

""You sure try hard to.""

Is that true? I feel like this because your inaction makes me feel unwanted. You insinuate that I could fix this for myself, that I'm digging my own hole. So I have the means to make you make me feel wanted again? How? How can I control your actions? That doesn't make any sense. What am I missing?"

"event","I can't sleep because of this nausea I feel at the top of my stomach. I feel a hole in my chest where my heart is supposed to be and a lump in my throat. I feel like my insides are rotting. 

You don't have time for me. You haven't thought to look for me. You don't miss me. And I cant make you. The realization hurts, it carves me hollow. Your life is full of things and you enjoy them one at a time, fill your minutes with them. Im trying to do the same, but its all an act. The world is darker, less vivid, when someone you love doesn't even think about you.

Oh, unless you can do them a favour. Then it's ""thank you so much."" I want to rip how much you mean to me out of my brain, I want to drain my blood of you, but the last living pocket of my heart still believes that you love me, that I'm overreacting, that this is normal. I'm not even being used. Ive been discarded and i wont admit it.

Whats even the point of admitting it? Then I'll really be alone, without any chance of getting what I want. I'll just wait here, and if you finally come for me, I will drink you like water in a desert, and never tell you how your silence hurt me. 

You must know, after all these aeguments. You have to know how this ruins me, right? I just want you to understand and be sorry, to hate to see me sad, to want to make it right, but you won't. If you saw this, you would blame me for it. You would get defensive, you would say that I inhibit you with my foul mood. 

Youre right, it is my fault. I let myself fall in love with you and thought my heart was safe with you. I'm rotting here waiting for you to love me, but nobody wants to love something rotten."

I&#39;ve told him pretty much this before, and it hasn&#39;t changed anything, and if I were to tell him again, it still wouldn&#39;t measure up.

I wrote this yesterday morning:

""Good morning, 
It's hot as fuck here. Even in the hyper-air conditioned train, the amount of sticky people coming in from the humidity outside, bringing in and radiating the heat their bodies were charged with, negates any cooling measures. 

I've been taught from somewhere that sweating is good for you, that you lose weight when you sweat. Don't necessarily know if this is true, but I hope so. I started working out last night, half hour on the ""gazelle"" I got off a neighbour who was moving. It was moderately fulfilling. I hope it does something noticeable soon. 

The more I use my blackberry for diferent things, the more I like being able to do most anything on one device. I used to knock it when I had a regular phone, but I dig it now. I wanna buy my friend's original iphone - I know, I hate all day on apple, but if this guy can give me a iphone for 40$, why not? The more I use my blackberry, the more I notice blackberry's limitations. ""

As I watched the (3 hour holy crap) movie, I was reading the wiki article about his life, and a lot of it aligned with the movie. Apparently the Vatican helped, yo. This was legit.

It was really depressing to see this man aiming to bring peace to the world almost secularly. He was inspired by his faith to just reach everybody, no matter what religion, where you're from, how old you are. And what'd the human race do? Inspire conflict. He appeared to the people outside his window less than 2 days before he died, his speech and motor skills gone. And what does the world do? Delve into more unrest.

Upsetting. I just hope that if the influence of someone with pure, ethical, just intentions doesn't penetrate, the human race will just get tired of suffering."

"event","There were lots of negative and positive feelings being felt in those seats when she got up on stage. Not one person expected her to say what she had to say, but by the time she was done, everyone knew the weight of the situation. My heart felt heavy, but only half because of what she shared with us. The other half was because I felt alone when I looked around and everyone was crying. Everyone. Don't get me wrong, it was worth crying about. It was even well-performed, if I can take a step back from it. But I was disconnected. As I got up there and tried desperately to tell her how I felt about it, I couldn't help but feel fake. I really did find what I just experienced to be remarkable, and I really wanted her to know that as if my opinion would change something significant about that night, but I felt like she didn't care, because she knew I didn't cry. I got knocked out of my confidence soapbox for a hot minute.

Have I been desensitized? I tried to rationalize it with the fact that she was on a stage and I was in seats, and I tried not to think of all the disgusting things I've said for a laugh and laughed at, all the gory things I've seen on TV but never assessed the gravity of, and wondered if I cried for all the wrong things. Every trite thing I put emphasis upon - but is it all really trite? Do you have to go through some traumatic experience to feel inadequate and self-loathing? I know there are things I used to cry about that I should never have, but for the first time in a long time all of my problems with myself are resurfacing. Am I trying to empathize with someone whose life will always be a little bit harder than mine? I felt so bad, so selfish when I asked myself that on the walk home, and suddenly I was a girl I had almost forgotten. -- I tend to forget what I look like until I see myself in the mirror. I tend to pretend my face is actually shaped differently when I haven't seen myself for some hours, and I still manage to always be surprised when pictures of me don't come out like I expect them to, or when I walk past a window reflection and I'm not as slim as I am when I pose in front of my full-body mirror. I feel sick. I feel inadequate. I feel like I can relate to her, though my life has been wonderful. I feel ungrateful.
And fucking hell, I'm crying now, about me. About how I wanted to cry before, about how I've learned to hide how I feel about myself (If I tell myself I'm hot enough I will be hot), about how I don't care unless it's about me, about how I know I'm the only one holding myself back from everything I want."

I got to school on Saturday, August 19th, only to find that I had a disgustingly tiny room while I had packed for a double without a roommate. Pretty wack, right? So I complain and complain, and after nearly a week's worth of my mom being here, I get a single in the basement. Bless her so much, she set everything up for me in <i>both</i> rooms before she left, and she's been calling me so much lately, but I've been so busy. :c
	Uhm, so orientation training was long and desperately boring without a computer or much access to my mother while she was here. One of the RAM slots on my pc died; luckily the RAM didn't, but I ended up paying someone else 70$ because I was too busy/lazy to figure it out myself. Also, I more than likely needed someone else's computer to figure out what the retarded beeping noise was - it was devastating to not have my computer for that nearly full week. Orientation finally happened, and it was all sorts of interesting and tiring. Thankfully my residents and Devika, my partner, are super hella great, and we all bonded significantly in that week. Most of us, at least; there's always going to be that one that sorta just goes off to parties and friends whenever she can/wants. Two of the guys took <i>me</i> out to parties one night, we had some beers and talked about all sorts of random stuff, it was adorable. And NO hangover the next night! I saw Mike on campus; no one from the internet has ever moved closer to me before, especially someone I've met in person before this move, and seeing Mike in a campus setting bridges the gap a bit. Weird, but cool. This is such a good school.

First day of classes was today. I really like getting all my classes out of the way by the time it's still daylight - and I get a nice little space for lunch! And I love the idea of having two days free in between my sets of classes. On the flipside, I really friggin hate buying textbooks. I'm about to spend 320$ on textbooks, and I've got it great compared to what some kids are spending.

I am estranged from loads of my friends. Well, loads, there were really only 5. 3.5 of them I trust with my whole heart still. I don't know, it'll all get sorted soon enough. On the other side, I've gotten closer to a couple of people, and that's cool, but I don't think we'll ever click like I did with those few. Oh well, I've still got my mommy.

A couple of wild and crazy things have been happening; I came in 40 minutes late to work today because I overslept/talked to Sam, but I still manage to look absolutely dashing. I had an absolutely insane dream, perhaps because I left my Mp3 player playing all night at a low but audible volume. I think it started with me and two old people (related to me somehow) walking up some strangely midwestern-looking road trying to go upstate. Cars were passing us by but we refused to hitch a ride. I was younger, and I think I had blonde hair. We turned around and started heading back (""We're never going to get to your aunt's house like this""), and soon we were in some crazy apartment with sparse decoration and lots of linoleum but very big. There were lots more old people, either related to me or Sam, but they were around a surprisingly small table playing cards. When I was around them, I was small, perhaps even a single digit age. But Sam had his own room, and I would be my age when I was in there. We didn't talk a lot, he seemed a lot more timid than I presume he actually is; I couldn't tell if he was nervous or bored. I looked out his window and it was the view out of TEAK's computer lab. I'll take a picture. The wildest part was that there were old couples in trenchcoats throwing themselves off of ledges lower than ours. They fell in slow motion onto cars and onto the otherwise barren street, then they'd get up and laugh and hug each other. I remember seeing a woman's nose start bleeding (even though she fell on her back?) and I was sure she was dead, so I was mortified, but her husband fell face first and then got up. She got up too and they shared like the deepest moment of their entire lives, it was frightening. Anyway, I felt depressingly distant from Sam and so I went out to the old people and played cards with them a little. I noticed Sam take a 5 minute shower and go back into his room, and I went back into his room after giving him time to change and climbed into his bed in the most innocent way. We faced each other, and he was about to say something when my mother woke me up asking if I was awake. :/ No mom, it's 5 am.

I really wanted to document that before I lost any more of it.

I'm sitting in an office that isn't mine on a computer that isn't mine, earning a pretty good amount of money to do little things like construct a PowerPoint presentation (on a mac? :/), just waiting for work to be over. As much as I hate work, I'm always going to like its dynamic more than classes. Know why? No homework. My brain feels stunted, though, I wish I could be taught something other than how to feign work more convincingly. At least I have my gorgeous MP3 player playing the sexiest tracks, all thanks to who, even at 19 years old? My mother.

I'm really wondering if I should ask Beka if I could go with her to that Of Montreal concert tonight - if it even is tonight - because she knows it isn't necessarily my kind of music, and I don't know if I can be fucked to get my ass up and go anywhere - much less Brooklyn. Will my mom let me? I sorta just wanna hang out with her.  We'll see.

I'm really upset that my school books haven't come yet. The one time I was actually inclined towards getting even a little ahead in my work, I can't. It must be fate.

"event","<a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2006/US/07/10/building.collapse/index.html"">This</a> upsets me. I don't even like updating this much anymore, and I don't really have anything to say, but It's still very upsetting. A suicide attempt? Gas explosion? Collapsing a whole building? Thankfully not a lot of people were hurt. Supposedly there weren't too many people in the building.

Guess where I was at 8:40? At the 59th Street train station, on the 2 towards Teak. Maybe 6 blocks or so from the building. Underground, at least.


Apparently a man is either seriously injured or died on train tracks today, on lines that I didn't take today (I took the 5, though, last Wednesday, to get to where I needed to be at Teak's first day of classes). I read about it on livejournal, so it could be wrong; if it is true, it got pushed out of the news due to the building collapse.

Creepy."

Doesn't a trophy wife mean, like, a really desirable therefore prize-like wife to whoever weds her? Hell yeah, I'm still one of those. 
I'm so furious but not surprised that the US lost. :c

lolol I love the Sun commentators. ""I've been hit harder by the wife!"" I love the internet.
I haven't been feeling too good lately, I don't really know why yet. Moodswings. I really hope this is just PMS, I don't want to be feeling it for much longer.

I'm so hungry."

"event","<b>10:29am</b>: I'm back at work; I'm starting today. I'm the luckiest girl ever; my first time-consuming project involves a computer! I got my own, too. My own account (sans network privileges, unfortunately) and everything. I work at the corner of my boss's desk, I feel like I'm in my own mini-office, it's hella cute. I can't really slack off, though, because I'm sure he'll know that what I'm typing here isn't what I'm supposed to be typing -- you know, he'll hear it. I'm hella hungry, but it's only 1.5 hours 'til lunch. 

I feel so good about my life and where it's at right now. I love waking up early and having like 1 or 2 hours before I leave the house, because it feels like work is just another event in the day, as opposed to what wakes me up in the morning, you know? It's almost like having a mid-morning class. It's less pressure, or something. Plus, I feel more alive once I've been awake for awhile, instead of thrusting myself out into the wide world with sleep sand still in my eyes.

It's humid as hell out, but still cold somehow? I hate really cold mornings, because then I tend to overdress. it's a teeny bit cloudy, though. I want the sun out so that I may tan! 

Nathan wanted to give me his old camera because he's buying a new one, but I told him no. I kinda wish I didn't, but it's a pretty good camera, and I know he'll have more use for it than I would, since he's more of a photographer than I am. But sometimes, I wish. I've got so many ideas for what I'm going to do with the money I plan on making here -- that's really bad, I don't like waiting, and I don't like depending on the future, you know?

If I can keep this computer throughout the summer, I'm going to join a message board. mmm, the idea of spending hours doing what I do at home and getting paid for it excites me.


<b>1:30pm</b>: Lunch was so delightfully filling that I have a bit of a tummy ache right now. I go home in 2.5 hours, and I honestly can't wait. I want desperately to feel my bed. I'm ok though, I'm terribly glad I'm infront of my computer. I have a couple of things to do:
xInquire on the internet about my IPod's HD. 
xYell furiously at Sam for not responding to text messages.
xCry silently because of the US's first loss in the World Cup.
xSleep offensively early.

oh, the work i'm doing right now is so monotonous i could cry. my contact lenses are drying up, and all i want to do is be outside where it's sunny. but i can't take off clothes ,and i have to update these damned forms. any suggestions on staying awake?

on the bright side, it was fun to be back, even though it feels like i never left. i don't really like that feeling, i feel like my body's cheating me into thinking i didn't leave when i know that the fact is that i did. way to fuck me, mind.

i think it's time for me to get back to work;  my body naturally pressing ctrl + s is a sign."

Dress up, take lots of pictures, go out, lick a shot for me, whatever you do to have fun. Have a smile on your face all day, find something to be happy for (if my turning 19 just doesn't do it for you enough :P ). Treat it like a(n inter)national holiday. I want people to come up to you and be like ""What're you dressed up for?"" or ""What's the occasion?"" and I want you to respond ""Oh, it's Judy's birthday.""

That would be so much more fulfilling -- and cheaper -- than presents (though presents are still quite fulfilling, I must say)! Cuz I'm sure that's been on your mind a lot, you know, what to get me for my birthday this tuesday. Tuesday, April 18th, kids! Have fun.

"event","So, this is pretty exciting. I've been on Spring Break since Friday, and I feel so much better it's ridiculous. Last Monday night I went to bed hella early with a headache and PMS, and I woke up throwing up, dizzy, and ready to die the next day. My heart was racing and I had a furious temperature, which hours upon hours of hydration quelled, but I still had a crazy cough and a lot of weakness and nausea. I didn't eat that entire week -- not like I didn't try, but I really couldn't. I ended up throwing up some bile on Friday. A throat culture and a blood test later, it seems like I don't have strep throat or mono; thanks Appel Health Services. What they did do for me, though, was give me sick leave so I could miss classes and go home. 

Ahah, go home. So I go on the Amtrak at 5:16, ready and raring to just be in my house, in my room, with my mommy, and we're off. The train's going and going and going until it gets to Newark. Alright, that means that I've been travelling for over two and a half hours, because Newark is the stop before New York City on the 3-hour trip. The train stops for a long minute before the conductor tells us over the comm that there has been a fire on the track, or something, and that there won't be any Amtrak service between Newark and NYC. ..What? Thankfully, New Jersey wants to be us enough to provide a New Jersey-New York transit train called the Path train, and they let stranded Amtrakers get on for free. So here I am going towards the World Trade Center, having to change trains to go farther uptown, having to walk to 7th Avenue to find a place where I can take the 2, having to wait for what seems like years before an uptown 2 train comes by 34th street. It's like 10pm, and I'm still on the train! I don't get home until like 11pm, sick as hell, carrying a lot of heavy bags. Poor baby!

But my mommy took care of me great, and I'm feeling so much better that I can easily say I'm practically cured! To my dissappointment, though, I feel like I'm in a state where I'm going to be 'practically cured' for weeks -- ie, sporadic coughs, sporadic runny nose, random ew. Oh well, better that than not eating!

I've even done work! Alright, maybe not a lot of work, but work nonetheless. Tom Wolfe, though he's a good writer, is hard to get through. Or maybe I'm just not meant to be an architecture historian (<b>From Bauhaus to Our House</b>, Tom Wolfe). I was reading over people's livejournals and I couldn't help but feel inclined to write in my own. I must say, Sam remains my favourite. I'm very upset because I also want to take a lot of photos, and while I have Adam's camera, I don't have the USB to upload them from because I don't use it on my computer at school (it has slots to read the memory card). Oh well, I'll just accumulate some and upload them when I come back, I suppose. I think Evan's book was supposed to come out this month; I hope it did, and I hope it's doing well. 

I'm beginning to come to terms with my vanity and flaunt the photos I've taken without as much apprehension and hesitation, and I'm beginning to like it, even though it is at the expense of my possibly looking very bitchy. Oh well.

Shower time.

"event","Hi there. Do I have lots to write about? No, probably not, but I'm procrastinating studying for my Sociology 100 midterm, and anything's better than reading Durkheim's <i>Suicide</i>. I really like this little mac laptop I'm on (though I never thought I'd see myself say that, ever). It's a Powerbook G4 12"", and I like it more than the bigger one (this is Adam's, Jake's is the bigger one. 14, 16 inches?). I want a laptop so badly.. 

I'm tired. My day didn't consist of a whole lot, to be perfectly honest, but I'm tired as hell anyway. I look damn f'ing good in my opinion, though it's a little embarrassing to be compared to a ""(naughty) catholic school girl"" (i'm wearing a button-up and a tie, and a blue skirt. black tights, and my FURRY BLACK BOOTS.) -- a little embarrassing, I emphasize. A lot exciting, a little embarrassing. Especially when it gets pointed out around the right people. :3

Damnit, now I'm thinking of all sorts of witty things I could've said in response; don't you hate that? Why can't you be sharp as a tack when it counts?

I feel like singing. I feel like singing for certain people, and impressing them, and getting showers of compliments. And I feel like hugging people. Very specific people, for specific reasonsl. And I feel like going out and buying a lot of food -- BUT I CAN'T FIND MY WALLET. 

10:30, my Sociology midterm. 1:30, photo class. 7pm, chorus. I wish I had capoeira every day instead of just two days a week. I think if I wanted to I could call people and have them take me to where they practice, but do I want to? Will I be able to? I'll talk to David. 

I've been eating one meal a day, generally. I don't know if it's because I don't get hungry, or I don't think about being hungry, or what. I hope I lose weight soon. I need a scale.

I'm in such a good mood, and I wish I could type forever, but I'm actually starting to feel guilty that I'm not doing enough work this semester."

"event","1.24.06, in Digital Photography:

I feel very weird. I want to write, but don't nkow about what. I've been productive, but only halfway -- I've never read so much so quickly (and effectively?). I feel pretty, but only sometimes -- I'm wearing a sweater that's big in some places but small in others, and jeans without back bockets that I've been wearing for days now. [<b>Today: I got compliments twice today from people telling me that I've been looking/dressing pretty lately. Hooray~. And yesterday? My ass has not been touched that much in.. ever. Hooray for pants without back pockets.</b>] My photo teacher is late, I want a new camera. Someone in my class looks just like Carrie; I miss her, hope she's doing well. I wonder what Evan's doing right now.

	Teacher made it some minutes late. Sigh, 3 hrs of class.

Today, 1.26.06, in Sociology:

	In my Sociology class, there is this girl who probably weighs only a little less than me but has a puffy bird face. My first time seeing her, I caught her staring at me, her puffy mouth agape and her overly mascara'd eyes half-lidded and -- I hate this so much, even when I do it -- her irises didn't touch the bottom of her eyelids. I was so frightened, I turned away quickly (I was so late and in a trenchcoat that was too big for me but was very warm -- thanks, Dylan.) and got my things together. Maybe 10 seconds later, I turn back around -- she's still staring at me. I really have to look her in the eye and smile for some seconds before she could smile back and turn away. She was probably looking past me, but <i>man</i>. Look past someone else.

	I've been very sexually frustrated lately. A significant amount of people tease me in the most subtle ways. I prefer it when they don't know -- at least then, they don't have complete control over me. Or do I prefer it when they do know, because that means they do it on purpose? Oh god, if only I knew.

	I have this deep feeling that Evan is doing just fine and that he's happy, and that amkes me feel a little better about things.

 I am still desperate to go dancing. Desperate to travel. Desperate to get piercings, thin out, be even mroe arrogant and charismatic and delightful. I plan on being fucking amazing, fucking gorgeous, a regular volatile, addictive substance.

Today, in Photo:

I'm having photographer's block, lol. I have to ""respond to a glass of liquid"", and I can't possibly think of where to start. I don't have interesting glasses or anything. 

I love this littel planner. I have free pages (from August until January) I can just write and doodle all I want, without anyone thinking I'm doing anythign mroe than planning my day out.

I also love this class. I'm not really going to be tested on anything and I've always loved digital photography. I hope it stops being ridiculously cold so I can take more pictures.

So I thought New Years was gonna suck for a majority of the evening because I was sitting at the computer when I was dying to go outside and play. I ended up being upset throughout most of the evening (though thankfully not as upset as some others). Mom was asleep at like 7 pm, but somehow managed to wake up a minute before midnight, so at midnight she stumbled out and we managed to share the hug and hopeful, happy words I've become accustomed to at the beginning of every year. We basically spent the next 8 someodd hours together, just talking about life. I don't know, something about the way she said things I already knew to me made them make so much more sense. I am so much more comfortable with myself right now, and I hope this amazing, comfortable feeling stays throughout the year. 

I feel like a hippy with the degree of spontaneous happiness I'm feeling; I have nothing but good, loving wishes for everyone I know. Evan, if you're reading this, I love you infinitely, and hope your night was also awesome, and hope your year is filled with amazing things. I'm not going to name anyone else directly because I honestly have good vibes going out to absolutely everyone I know (and even some I don't).

I don't like setting ultimatums on myself; thus, I don't do the resolutions thing. Either that, or I put ultimatums on myself constantly, so today is no different? 

All I can say is that I feel really good about how things are going to progress; I feel ready to progress, and I hope all of you do too."

My emotions have been fucked up severely lately, and it's upsetting. I bring it upon myself, though, which is why I've decided to let all that drama go. It's washing away as we speak; I'm just gonna have fun, no matter what. 

My best friend in the entire world from kindergarten to grade 5 moved away to PA in the 6th grade, at the same time I changed schools. I come to find out now, that as I attend college in PA, he goes to school in NY. He's coming down tomorrow and we're going out. I don't think anyone understands just how excited I am. 

Christmas is on Saturday, and though I'm happy, I'm not as happy as I used to be. Today, 8 years ago, my grandmother died.

Shit, I can't write anymore.


A thinker sees his own actions as experiments and questions--as attempts to find out something. Success and failure are for him answers above all.

I am so happy. Today I had two presentations that went so very smoothly, it was great. Yesterday I got my final math test back and I've gotten the highest I've ever gotten before: 97. I'm getting no less than a B- on all of my classes, As in two of them. I must say, though, that I should work a little more; I'm pretty sure the only reason why I'm doing well is because i know this stuff already. 

I'm writing an alarm clock for my final project in CPS. I don't know how I'm going to make it look, since I don't know the first thing about a gui. I was wearing Adam's shirt yesterday, but I'm wearing a shirt my MOMMY gave me today. :D Nate invited me to the arts house this weekend. They have Soul Calibur III; that means I'm there. I need to do laundry and clean my room again.

I feel good and tired at the same time, so I kinda want to dance and sleep. Simultaneously. Now THAT'd be ill.

It's really funny; I found out yesterday that a guy I found terribhly attractive (for reasons I don't quite understand) might be gay. I know he hooked up with another dude friend of mine, but he could be bi? Could be drunk? I don't know why, but I will get very upset if he ends up being gay, even if he never finds me attractive.

Well, no. I know why. If he's gay, there will never <i>be</i> a chance that he finds me attractive. The fact that there are men in the world that are averse to women and therefore averse to me is dissappointing. And I'm generally oblivious to these things, damnit. 

I really want pictures taken of me. I don't know why. I have a severe urge to be feminine."

Hi everybody. I'm trying so desperately to stay awake right now. I have a class in about four hours, and I know that if I sleep now, I'll be missing both my classes. 

This weekend could've been better. Everyone around me was on edge, drama ran rampant everywhere. Everything was a soap opera. But on the plus side, there is a pool table in my common room and I am making progress. I'm so glad that's over. I laughed so hard just about an hour ago, and it felt so fucking good to be retarded and funny and make people laugh and laugh at other people being retarded and funny.

Turns out I'm performing with some others tomorrow for some Kwanza celebration with a beat I learned today. Fail. And I'm the only one playing the beat on top, which would be a compliment save for when I get tired (it's a long piece), everyone knows. At least the dancing'll be pretty. I don't like the girls' attitudes sometimes, though. Prissy, condescending. Sigh, females.

I've been playing a lot of Soul Calibur II too, and it's amazing. So much fun so much fun, and I didn't know the GC was so powerful. <3 Props, nintendo.

The last two weeks of the semester signifies that I am really in college. Holy hell. I've got two presentations - one on my dad and his livelihood as a musician, and one on Adam, about language aquisition, both next week. A test this Friday coupled with two exams in two weeks or so means I should be working, but I can't be assed. I'm not learning anything new in class anymore, it feels so liberating!

Looking over some of my old entries, I've realized a couple of things: 
I am not as happy as I used to be - or, at least, I don't write as happily as I used to.


My interests, though they have not changed drastically, they have changed. I guess I've grown up.

I have only had this journal for two and some years. I only realized that when I noticed just how soon I started writing about Evan relative to the first post.

I think I was a lot harder to handle back then. Maybe. Unless I wasn't, then my perception of what a good person is is very skewed.

"event","So I saw Jarhead yesterday. It was both hot and fucked up (Like a lot of things lately, wtf). Like, three of the 7 someodd main characters were so good looking: Jake Gyllenhaal, the guy who played Troy (especially), and the southern one. See, that's what's fucked up: I was so excited, and then the movie touched on really fucked up things. 

That wasn't very well worded, but I can't think of much else to describe it. Sometimes when I think of war I think of a pointless, disgusting loss of life, and sometimes when I think of war, I think of badass motherfuckers carrying ridiculously awesome weaponry around and owning bitches. Sigh, testosterone. What this movie made me realize, though, is that I never think about anything else: I never think about the countless people who enlist and get their minds fucked with to the brink of insanity for no reason, for the moment. I forget what first influenced me to consider the way america runs its people by keeping them in fear (I think it was that first Roger Moore movie, there was a cartoon that talked about that), but all I could do is think of that when watching the movie. Then another little bit of me can only be like ""omfg that's so dramatic I'm sure not every marine's life develops in that manner,"" but in this case I can't be so sure. Not like I know anyone who'd tell me. Evan says it's ""accurate"", but that's about it.

It's a little upsetting that the movie really gave me all my knowledge of Desert Storm ever. I think that means I should read a little more.

I'm halfway through Lolita, by Vladimir Nabokov. You want to talk about hot and fucked up at the same time, you talk about that book. Fuck. 

I'm free 'til Monday. No classes. But I'll be in the dorm. So fuckin' call me, peoples. Incoming calls to a landline are free, and I've got my own phone in the dorm (Well, it's mine and Allia's.), and I'm ready to make use of it. GG at the first person calling me on it that wasn't my mom being spider. <3 Win.

It's family weekend here at F&M, but since my mother worked today, she didn't really have the time or ability to come up here. I called her earlier, told her I loved her, and then called my dad. We talked for a long time (by our standards, no more than 30-45 minutes in total), and it was very fulfilling. It meant a lot to him for me to tell him I love him, and it meant a lot for me too. I love my family, really.

Now I'm doing computer science homework (or putting it off..), a little sick and a little upset that my computer doesn't believe my programs should ever be compiled, but listening to Neutral Milk Hotel and thinking about Rebeka and Yi-Hsin and Gail. I'm not going to be able to see them over Thanksgiving like I had hoped; I'm probably going to call them later. I even had a (small, but) invigoratingly happy conversation with Evan today; I feel like it'll be fantastic. If only it wouldn't get so cold at night, then I'd be more excited about going out. 

I gave my room a thorough clean on Thursday with Adelaide - thank god for her energy and my strange self-loathing - I'm the lazyass with OCD, how does that work? But we managed to get it gorgeous. It's full of bags and bags of clothes that once were on our floor, but are now washed; I'm gonna sort through that once I'm done with Computer Science. Damnit school, getting in the way of my life!

<small><b>Edit:</b> I GOT MY COMPUTER TO DO WHAT I WANTED IT TO. It'll now compile my homework!</small>

Talking to my parents has compelled me to straighten up my life. It's not like I don't talk to them often, but there's something about today that sorta sparked this latent need to be awesome. 

I've gained a lot of weight, so much so that it's visible even to me, and I tend not to notice things like these. I aim to get rid of it. As soon as possible.

Other than that, I think I'm done with this entry. I think I wrote it mostly for comments, so provide."

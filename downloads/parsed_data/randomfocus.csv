This residue makes the keys sticky
Electrical tape is amazing, and copper wires cut fingers
But something physically productive was in order
(Plus, my broken stereo played the same CD for a week)
So I bought and installed a new car-mounted discman
I'd have screamed had I listened to Dido again.

Her teeth were brown and peeling off,
Ashes from countless crack blazes;
So she didn't smile widely for the
""I'm a certified Wal-Mart electronics specialist"" photo.
She's bashful about the err in her drug-cursed ways.

The stack of work lies far away now
I ignore it, just as I ignore the plastic blonde
Who doesn't understand why I get angry when she talks in class
(She's NEVER met a teacher who had a problem with that before!)
If only I could tell her to suck it.

And in spite of it all, I hear the crunchy tingle
of Spanish in the streets, in the stores, on the tele
Hence I have a mission, and I'll always have a job.

I laugh with those who advised 
that the first year is tough.
If only they paid me for all the frustration
and the 20+ hours I work from home.
The boiling anger antidote: ""I'm a professional..."""

"event","I worked my last Friday night shift ever

I cackled with my new friend over dumb shit
said ""hello?"" quaintly with buckets on ears
left before midnight, a bitter exchange
broke $100 and my body
inner thighs are chaffed and medicated
overstarved expressions of lack
celebration is in order
3 coronas in the fridge
but I prefer writing this ditty

embrace my abstractness,
please"

or what I say unless you
read between my lines
stand back, stand back

attention all friends:
leave a 25-30% tip for good service and watch your server smile :)

attention all customers:
you can suck the scum off my toilet bowl!

I'll give your children ONE F MUY GRANDE in my class
when you leave frickin' $2.90 on a $57.10 tab
which, F.Y.I., is a meal that barely feeds your starving obesity!

so take your extra ranch and shove it
I don't need your chump change, chump

counting the bless-ed days...
in two weeks I'll be orientating and orientationing
rising at 6 and snoozing at 10

God reminds me to enjoy this while it lasts
soon I'll be
missing those moonlit, smoky rides
and I.H.O.P. at 3 a.m.
or dancin' 'n' sex 'til the sun comes up

I wonder if shuddering while I grin
makes me a walking contradiction
or, inasmuch, a breathing paradox

-=-

on a side note, in light of the recent Discovery launch, I guess...
they say ""we must find an energy source that is not expendible""
then they indicate the sun with a smile

sin embargo, a medianoche, the world freezes over
as that brilliant, balanced sphere fizzles out
some odd 4.6 billion years from now
and our future energyless society hurtles toward yonder abyss
with Andromeda just a quantum stone's throw away

whatever will our great great great grandchildren do?"

letting people hypothetically

with twisted smiles and holier-than-thous
that creep from diverted stares
elevate collective worthlessness

"event","<P>Okay when i was in Fayetteville Stacey ( Johns sister) offered me a job babysitting Ethan ( John's 2 1/2 yr old nephew) and i would stay there for the 4 months that i am taking of off school. When i got back.. mom and i talked about that and we were both a little ify about it. But today i get the new paper and there are 2 major hotel hiring and i am going to apply to them this weekend. Mom went to the beach and when she came back she told me that she did some thinking. and she told me that It's stupid that i haven't been able to find a job yet ( stupid that no one is hiring) and she said that if i apply to these otehr places and they call me back theni should just go to Faetteville and babaysitt Ethan becuasei would at least be making money rather than sitting around making no money. She aslo said that i need to decide by the time we get from MI ( we leave next week) and if i dont get a call back by then .. then i should just go to Fayetteville and work for Stacey. and if i end up going i could leave at the end of august which is when Jill and Aunt Dee leave here (they are coming for a visit) so i would be there from August-December/January. What should i do?</P>
<P><U><STRONG>Pro's</STRONG></U></P>
<P>1. Make money</P>
<P>2. Live with John for 4 months</P>
<P>3. Babysitt a little boy that loves me</P>
<P>4. get out of the house</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><STRONG><U>Con's</U></STRONG></P>
<P>1. Mom alone for 4 months</P>
<P>2. Won't be here for the holidays ( again)</P>
<P>3.Mom alone for hurricane season</P>
<P>4.Is the pay enough?</P>
<P><BR>P.S Mom told me to just do it and not to worry about her being alone because i will be moving out anyway. she said "" it will be weird with out you here but i would rather you be makingmoney and doing something VS. not makingmoney and just sitting around"".</P>

I found that it is $284 to fly directly into Fayetteville ( 15 min away) but $185 to fly into Raleigh Durham ( about an hour away).. mom told him that she wouls split the cost with him since he paid the whole ticket last time.. so there for if i were to fly into Fayettevilee his half would be $142  but to fly me into Ralegh Durham it would be $ 92.50..  HMMMMM  which is better?!  Well he said that "" well i don't know, keep checking for lower fares into Fayetteville..  i don't know exactly how to get to Raleigh Durham Air Port and its like an hour away""..   well my next though ( i thought this i didnt saya it) then you dont want to see me that bad..  i mean seriously. .if you want to see some one bad enhough you will do what you have to do. .even if it requiers an hour drive to see a person for 6 days! to me that seems worth it.... but i guess i was wrong.

I had a criminal justice test today..  seemed pretty easy.. i hope it was as easy  ifelt it was ha.After that we broke early so i got out of there like 1.45min early which was pretty cool. I have come to the conclusion that my math professor (i have the sme one!) is a complete ass hole. there is no student teacher cofidentiality with this prick.. or he just doesnt follow it. He decided toannounce to the ENTIRE class that some of the students were repeating the class.. and the sad thing is  is he said it loud and clear during roll call to those people to not give the answers out for the up coming test! OKAY that was completely disrespectful i was pissed because he had no right to do that! He could of pulled the students aside and told them to wait until the room was empty and then told them  BUT NOOOOOOOOOOO he had to be a prick! I can't stand this guy!

John's alternator decided to quit on him today which i find funny because he had to repair it in the pouring rain and had the urge to call me and tell me ha. Poor guy... got poured on  but hey at least he gets a discount on parts so it wasn't toooo expensive.

Goin to MICHIGAN in July! IM excited.. Speaking of... My younger cousin turns 18 next wow..  when he gets olde ri know i get older scary thought! ha. I remember when i USED to be taller than him.. yeah not anymore  he towers over me at 6'6"". GIANT! HAPPY EARLY BIRTHDAY ELLIS!

My dad annoys the shit out of me!!!!!  He calle dmom to fnd out what my insurance was.. OKay he had called me 3 days ago and i told him that it is 170..  and he calls mom today and said that I told him that it was 350!  OKAY!  no i didnt that ass! If he would only listen to me the first thousand times i told him things he would know that!"

"event","It has been a week since i was in NC with John.. I really wish that i still was. I was so happy when i was with him, he makes me happier than i have ever been. The stupid things that we do together make our relationship so fun and goofy. We can pick on eachother and not take it to heart beause we know that we would never say anything to hurt oneanother. I can honestly say that being with him, i feel whole..and now being apart from him again...i feel as if a part of my heart was cut out. Leaving him again ( 1st time was in michigan) was so painful, i couldn't do that again. My heart hurt so bad when i turned and walked through the security station, i couldn't even look back. It still hurts, its a fresh wound that can only be healed by being with him again. I don't know when that will sadly :-( hopefully it will be this summer..wether he is coming here or i am going there...i hope to see him soon for my heart longs for him to be close.


Had class today. was up at the ass crack of dawn.. OH WAIT IT WAS STILL DARK! I was up at 5:50 AM.. had class at 8am then another at 10:25..   and tomorrow my class is from 11:40-3pm  so thats at least some of a break. My CJ class is wicked fun though. My professor is pretty cool.. my favorite by far.
  I lost 7 more punds.. for a total loss of 27lbs! :-) GO ME!

Not too much to write about actually, my life seems so revolve around school at the moment. Only 4 weeks left in this term. Finals on the 25-29  mine take place on : Rea:03 eitehr the 25th or 26th  and MAT 0002 on the 27th.  WONDERFUL!  Then i get to go to NC for a week which rocks.. i'm hopefully booking my ticket today.

Next term is gonna be intense! i dunno what iw as thinking about taking on 12 credits for a 12 week term.. OH yeah i do..  bc i need to be a fulltimer to beable to stay on moms insurance thats why..  DAMNIT.. BLAH oh well can't help that.. I would rather be on her insurance and take 12 credits rather than not be on her insurance  bc that is exactly when something bad would happen where i would need her Med. Insurance..  say for example i trip over a cat and break my ankle again. ha. Yeah would need that insurance so this is a good idea..  Next term consists of : 
        1st 6 weeks: Humanities  M W F  8am -10:15am
             Criminal Justice M W F 10:25am - 12:40 pm
        
       2nd 6 weeks: Psychology  M W F 10:25am - 12:40pm
  Narcotics/ Dangerous Substances  M W  5:40pm - 9:00pm


  Hmmmmmm   FUN! :-)

Surfside PD has yet to call me back which is oh so depressing but that is okay..  Maybe i will go up to Old Navy and see if they have any openings..  GRRRR   okay okay or maybe even a hotel and see if they have anything..  all i know is i need a jobby job!"

"" I Want To Tell You Lies""

I want to tell that little boy , that his mom will be just fine
I want to tell that dad, we got his daughter out in time.
I want to tell that wife; her husband will be home tonight
I don't want to tell it like it is, I want to tell them lies.
You didn't put their seatbelts on; you feel you killed your kids.
I don't want to say you didn't.....but in a way you did.
You pound your fists into my chest; your hurting so inside.
I want to say you'll be OK, i want tell you lies.

You left chemicals within his reach, nd it's in his eyes.
I want to say your son will see, not tell you he'll be blind.
you ask me if he'll be OK , with pleading in your eyes
I wan to say that yes he will, i want to tell you lies.

I can see you're crying, as your life goes up in smoke.
Id you'd maintained that smoke alarm, your childrean would have awoke.
Don't grab my arm and ask me if your family is alive.
Don't make me tell you they're all dead, I want to tell you lies.

I want to say she'll be OK, you didn't take her life.
I hear you say you love her and you'd never hurt your wife.
You thought you didn't drink to much, you thought that  you could drive.
I don't want to say how wrong you were, I want to tell you lies.

You only left her for a moment, it hapens all the time.
How could she have fell from there? You thought she couldn't climb.
I want to say her neck's not broke, that she will be just fine.
I don't want to say she's paralized, I want to tell you lies.

He fell into the pool, when you just went to grab the phone.
it was only for a second, that you left him there alone.
if you let that darn phone ring, perhaps your boy would be alive,
But I don't want to tell you that, I want to tell you lies.

I want to tell this treen, his buddies didn't die in vain.
Because he thought that it'd be cool, to try and beat that train.
I don't want to tell him this will haunt him all his life.
I want to say that he'll forget, I want to tell him lies.

The fact that you were speeding, caused that car to overturn.
And we couldn't get them out of there, before the whole thing burned.
Did they suffer? Yes, they suffered, as they slowly burned alive.
But I don't want to say those words, I want to tell you lies.

But I have to tell it like it is, until my shift is through.
And then the real lies begin, when I come home to you.
you ask me how my day was, and I say it was just fine.
I hope you undertsnad, sometimes I have to tell you lies.

And yet some people still like to talk shit about me- we all know who that ass hole is!  but anyway. Jill and Aunt Dee are comin down on the 10th to stay for a week which is really cool! School is driven me nuts already! On a daily basis i have about 4-5 hours of homework including the 3 hours a day i put in Lab work. but next term is gonna kick my ass- psych. genetics (maybe).some criminal justice courses...  and the like. so yeah.. this is a mickey term so i cant complain too much. I found out that i cant even jin the police academy until I'm 21 because i have to own a gun..  and i need to be sponsored by a dept. so that when i do go to the P.A  they will pay for it and pay me in the process if i agree to work for them! :-) works for me   but i have like 3 more years damn it. at least i can get classes out of the way. 
Alissa and April are coming down for a long weekend in March which kicks ass!  that will be a party!!!   And John is HOPEFULLY coming down in April for my spring break which would rock! I hope he makes it! :-D

Never knowing if you did what you wanted to or tried something new or exciting.

Blind to any solution to any of your problems or road blocks....
Not realizing the simplicity of it all..
The only thing you need to do is to let it go....
Let it go by not allowing it to get that far...

Fall in love or Fall out of love....
But most of all, do what you know will make you happy and not regret never living.

I have been pondering the same same thing for a while now...  why is it that when everything goes good for so long.. then it all turns for the worst at the same time. I mean can't there be some perk inbetween there, like when you can for once get something you want instead of wanting something you can't have. Oh wait.. then that wouldn't be life and life would have to figure out a new way to mess with your head. never mind that then. Ha.  anywho.............

Haven't talked to Rich in a while either, that sucks a bunch :-( . I wonder how his mom is doing, okay i hope. That ""issues"" hasnt calle dme since friday so that is kinda freaky.. never gone this long without callin me.. last time that happened my mom and i made a bet on days that he would call.. yeah we both lost because he called that day! But so far to drive by engine revvings in the alley and no phone calls.. anywho..... had to pay for my classes today which cost me an arm , a leg and a few fingers so i look pretty goofy right now ;-). Classes start Jan 4 so thats pretty nifty. I need to go chirstmas shopping, i need to send some gifts back home for teh family and for some friends.. hmm i wonder what they want. i will figure it out. I need a job so bad! I hate sitting around and doing nothing. But finding a job here sucks!



Im out i need to go for a skate."

I went for a speed skate ( to blow off some energy) through the park today. And as i was goin through i was noticeing how many different familes were gathered together in the park to spend time together. there was such a mix of ages and it was so awesome to see how much family togetherness means to people.


I am so tempted right now to just go sit on the beach and look up at all the stars.  The sky is so amazing here at night, that is a plus about being down here. The sky is just twinkleing with billions of stars. You know how when your a little kid your'e told that if you make a wish on the first star you see , that it will come true... I have been making the same wish on that first star that i see ever since i was younger. and it has yet to come true. Everyday it becomes less and less of a reality as the chances of that wish ever comeing true. My wish was that my dad and i could actually have a relationship again like we did when i was little. I was such a daddies girl. Until i grew up and began to realize what was really going on. Then he grew distant.After my parents divorced my dad moved out and into a house with a family friend who lived about 4 blocks away from me and i never seen him.. he never even called.. i always had to call him.  and its still like that now.. i always have to call him and now im 18 and living 3,000 miles away. All chance of that happening are gone. So now its time for me to mke a new wish.. Maybe i will have better luck the second time around.

Somethign i learned was that you will have friends, enemies, close friends and friends you love. but no matter how much you trust them... then can become your enemy before you even know what hit you."

Okay i had this whole entry typed out and done and i clicked the submit button and the darnthing tells me somethin was wrong with.. so i click the back button..  do you tink that worked?  NOOOOOOOOO  so i had to type this whole darn thing over again...  I dont remeber half the things i said! It was the heat of the oment kind of crudd!  GRRRR on Live Journal!

Somethings seem to be better left not understood.  For example- at about midnight i hear the car of this guy tat i know drive by my window ( my window faces the alley) explain this to me..  Wait. you might be wondering how i know it was his car...  he has the loudest car around not to mention a blow off valve that he just so happens to release as he drives ALL THE WAY down the alley..  hmm what what was the point of that? can you say stalkerish? I just don't get it! Things like this make me wish i was back in michigan.. okay lots of things make me wish i was back in michigan.

ANYWHO

Melissa called me today that rocked! she told me she might be commin down here for thanksgiving! That would be awesome if she could! I also talked to JIll today. She is doin good. I miss her so much! YOU HAVE NO IDEA! I LOVE YOU GIRLY!I will see you in 4 months!

Still no call backs on jobs..  been lookin for 2 months now and have not been lucky AT ALL..  even home depot didn't call me back!  I mean come on. I need a job so bad, i hate not working. not working = no money. no money = no apartment which means i live with my mom forever..as cose as we are...  UMMMM no. i would like to be out on my own... Any one need a roomy? hit me up lol.  

Yeah this entry is all over teh place but oh well... ITS MY JOURNAL  i will type it how i want  :-P"

"event","I gotta say, working for the University has its perks.  The big one is I'm working with little-to-no supervision and very little expectations of how much progress should be made in any given week.  The scientists I'm working for don't have any idea of how long it takes me to impliment anything, and the two guys who originally worked on this project are having less and less of an idea.  They know a few more of the technical details, but since what I'm implimenting now is uncharted territory for them, by not venturing forth specifics I can give vague statements like ""I can have this done by the end of the week"", then spend most of the week dicking around on the internet, then busting out a little bit of work and get praised for the progress."

Why am I so obviously insane?

49.Name a character that you like but everyone else seems to hate

Only my pride, after my mom finds the stains.

55.Has a horror/survival genre video game scared you to the point that you refused to finish the game? Did you get nightmares from said game?
Fear is a human emotion.

56.Have you ever thrown a controller/disc/cartridge in a fit of frustration?

"event","Oye, things are really starting to piss me off.  Been guild leader for a few months now, and things have been on a slow downward trend.  We keep losing our best players, and although we pick up new guys, it doesn't really make up for it, as the new people aren't geared up in any way.  I'm starting to reach my wits end, and if this keeps up I'll probably end up going to another guild.  Which is something I don't want to do.  I'll feel shitty about myself for what I perceive to be letting them down.  But I can see that if this continues, the guild will die, and it will be a slow and painful death.  Or it will just be a complete plateau at mediocrity, which is something I just won't accept.  The way I see it, I've got one last chance to get us back on our feet, to spur the guys (and gals, we've got like, 6 of them) back into being the kickass guild that I remember.  But if it fails, I don't know what I'm going to do."

"event","Time for another update, mostly because I'm bored as hell at work.  There's only so much of this I can stand without my mind wandering.  For those who aren't in the know, the way my job works is I get a Word document from my boss.  I need to check that document to make sure there's no syntactic/symantic errors and that it fits with the style document.  Any changes I make I have to document.  Assuming I can resolve all the errors myself I then procede to integrate it into the web pages of the company.  This basically consists of hitting copy and paste over and over again, while also having to deal with a frustrating tool.  Afterwards I have to check through every page to make sure that I did my work correctly, and that it looks right in the final rendition.  Considering that each Word document is ~60 pages, I'm sure you can see how boring this can get day after day.  I've been working on this stuff since mid-May and I am really starting to get tired of it.  I can't complain with the pay, though.  $16/hr is not exactly chump change, and that's what's kept me going through the weeks.  

So in other news, I'm going to a wedding in December, the 8th to be precise.  I've never met the guy in person before, but I've known him for 5 years, and he's like a brother to me.  He helped me get through my little episode in April.  He's definately one of my two best friends (and the other one knows who she is).  So that's going to be a lot of fun.  Since my mom is worried about me having to deal with the flight and hotel and rental car, she's convinced my dad to drive me out there and visit Cincinnatti while I'm at the wedding.  Of course, now that I remembered the bachelor party (which I <b>need</b> to be there for) I'm going to have to work out something with my dad to go a day earlier than we expected.  We were thinking of driving there the day of, since it's a Thursday, and thus the wedding would probably be an evening one.  Of course, they could always do an earlier one, in which case we have no choice but to go there the night before.  It's definately going to be something worth telling my kids.

And in other other news, thanks to my dad driving, and thus subsidizing a significant portion of the cost (I'll have to pay for the gift, and contribute some to the bachelor party) I will most likely have enough money to visit Mt. Holyoke during Spring Break, which is March 18th - March 26th.  Now watch as it turns out that they go on Spring Break at the same time."

"event","*sigh* I've wasted my life.

All these years I should have been spending learning things such as how to study, or how to meet girls, I instead spent in front of my computer.  I skated by in school, helped by the system, but now I can't do that.  They expect a lot of work out of me, and I can't deliver, since I never learned how.  I have no ability for self-directed work, which won't matter at a job, since you go in for 8 hours, do your job, and go home.  They don't have you come in for an hour, give you a bit of info on what you're working on, and then send you home to give them the project in a few months.  They want status reports weekly, you're working with other people and you all have to get done at a similar pace or it won't get done.  But in this short run, my inability is going to get me mediocre grades.

And then just when I think I've gotten a handle on school, my other deficiency rears its head.  I finally have interactions with the fairer sex that go beyond that of two friends who see each other once or twice a week, and my schoolwork suffers again.  And then when my inexperience causese me to hit the lowest point I've ever reached emotionally, my schoolwork suffers further.  And now I only have two years left of college, and maybe a few more years for masters, and then it's off to the real world, where, my mom has assured me many times, it is MUCH harder to meet people.

And now my mom has been talking to me about possibly taking the next year off, and working.  But I can't do that.  I know myself too well.  If I can get a steady paying job that goes 9-5, I won't quit at years end.  I'll stay on, and then I'll be 40, alone, and with a job that doesn't pay as well as I should be able to get, since I settle for what works.  I've always been the type to go the path of least resistance.  My career I just see as a means to make money to raise a family.  I have something I'd like to do, but I won't be crushed if I can't get it.  So taking a year off is probably going to end up being the worst thing for me.

But then there's the other end of that, insofar as that there's a good chance that I'll end up my college career with mediochre grades, and I won't be able to get into grad school, or get a good job.  But at the moment, I think I'd rather risk that.  After all, I can still pull my grades up, but I don't think it'd be as easy for me to rejoin school, even with my parents supporting me to do so.

None of this would be an issue, though, if I hadn't wasted my high school years.  And now I'm becoming paralyzed by my inexperience, unable to even make strides to correct myself.  And I can see myself in the future, a lonely 50 year old man, never achieving the one thing that I really want to do with my life.

Fucking A."

"event","Wow, I just had the most fun I've had in a long time.  It started last night.  We had rented out the DDR machine so that the people who had registed for the DDR tournament today could get some free play.  The machine was set to no fail, and we got one song per play.  So after the first couple, we all started really getting into it, doing all kinds of crazy shit, like freestyling whenever we could, the kind of stuff we would never do when we're paying for it for fear of losing our money.  We just had a total blast.

Then today was the tournament, which caused me to miss a guild raid, but I don't mind.  Started with the Perfect Attack division, in which I did surprisingly well.  First off, I qualified, which I did not expect.  I lost in the first round, since I was facing the second seed, and I knew I was going to lose.  But then in the loser's bracket, I made it past the first round, and then lost in the second.  A hell of a lot better than I had expected.  I figured at best I'd qualify, and then lose in the first round of the regular bracket and the first round of the loser's bracket.

Next up was the freestyle competition.  Everyone entered in it had no real routine, even though the one weighted the most was the Prepared Routine round.  We all just made stuff up on the spot, and I had so much fun with it.  Got a chance to use Johnny Bravo's dance, where he goes ""Do the monkey now!""  Then there was the improvised, and I got a decent song for it.  When the results were tallied, I ended up being in fourth place, but behind the third place guy by 0.75 out of a possible 75.  So I did quite well, I figured.

Finally was the Follow the Leader competition, for those who hadn't won anything.  Marty (the guy running it) did a song, with some mods, and made a point of not doing it well.  We then had to play the same song with the same mods, and see how close we could get to his number of perfects, number of greats, and number of other steps.  I ended up coming in fifth in that, so I got a $10 EBGames gift card.  And considering I paid $7 to get in, I came out far ahead of the game.

So yeah, things are definately looking up for me."

"event","I'm in a rut.  I've known it for the past week now, but I didn't get it cemented home until today.  I was going out to turn in my CS231 homework at the TA office.  As I'm leaving Seibel Center, my hand automatically reaches down to my pocket.  It's then that I notice I don't have my keys with me.  For those that don't know me on a daily basis, let me explain this to you:

I never forget my keys.

And by that, I mean if I leave my keys in the room, it's only when my roommate is in the room, and I realize that I don't have them before I reach the elevator, so I go back right away.  If I go to visit someone else in the building, I bring my keys, even if my roommate's still here.  If I go downstairs to use the bathroom since our toilet got clogged again and everyone's too lazy to get a plunger, I bring my keys.  But this time I forgot them, since I didn't take my inventory of stuff that I always do as the door is closing behind me, so that if I, say, don't have my keys, I can open the door before it shuts locked and grab them.

So now I'm heading back, and I first come to the back door, completely automatically, even though I don't have my keys, know that I don't have my keys, and have been thinking about how I hope that Erik or Micah is in the other room, so that I can come through the shared bathroom to get in.  I get to the door, and remember that I can't get in.  Minor inconvenience, but still, another sign that my head is not where it should be.  So I come through the front, up the elevator, come to my room, hoping that maybe someone is back, so the door'll be unlocked.  It is.  I step in, and no one's here.  I forgot to lock the door.

I never forget to lock the door.

I've been at many dorms my entire life, so locking the door is very automatic to me.  Heck, back at IMSA we got in the habit of locking our door at night, due to the actions of some seniors in the first week playing a round of miniature golf in our room.  I even will lock the door sometimes when I leave for class or somewhere similar and my roommate is still in the room.  It's exceedingly simple, just push in the little turn lock on the knob, so that the door'll be unlocked when I open it with the key.  If I turn it to lock it, it stays that way after I open it with the key, which is an inconvenience to people who want to come in.  So it's just the simple push as we go past the door.  And I had forgotten it somehow.

This was just the culmination of the past couple weeks that have just been completely and utterly off.  Last week was the beginning.  Wednesday I get into my Stats class late, as always, due to its location, and there's so many people who aren't sitting in the seats (and there's room for them, they just don't want to push over 5 people to get to the center seats in the middle of lecture that I just turned around and left.  Since there was now two hours before my next class, I figured I'd head back to my room, copy down notes from the book on the chapter we were covering in class, and that'll make up for it.  Except I go back, and never come back to my other class that day.

Then on Friday, I make it on time, since the previous class, instead of being an hour long lecture, is a discussion section I get out of early, because I work fast.  So I get to lecture on time, with the homework, figuring I'll stay, since he says homework is due at the end of class.  Except he brings out a homework box, and leaves for a second or so.  We all start turning in our homework, and then, for reasons I still can't explain, I leave.  Fortunately, that day I did make it to the Psych lecture I had skipped on Wednesday, mostly because I went to the Union to play DDR instead of going to my room.  But that isn't the proper solution.

Monday, I didn't even try to go to Stats.  I'm starting to think that I'll end up skipping the lectures and learning from the book until I get my bike, since getting there 5-10 minutes late every day depending on when the bus gets there is not something I want to do.  At least with my bike I'll be able to get there at around the start of class.  And I never made it to my Psych class.  I've now started realizing that something is very wrong.

Then today came.  I ended up skipping my CS231 lecture, but it was for a good cause, as I was in the middle of a long reply to someone's brainless post on a forum I frequent, and I planned on going to the rest of my classes.  Except I don't make it to Geology, opting instead to take down the notes from the web.  And I don't make it to Stats, again.  And I don't make it to Psych, again.  Or my Stats discussion session, which has a quiz today.  My rational?  One gets dropped.

I've grown completely stagnant, and I can't figure out why.  I'm not even using this time I take from class to really do anything productive, outside of copying down notes so that I don't totally waste the time.  I end up surfing the web for completely inane things.  Which isn't like me.  If I was skipping classes normally, I'd probably be using the time for something like World of Warcraft, or one of a myriad of other computer games.  But instead I'm just kind of putzing around on my computer.  And I can't figure out why.

I've also started listening to Pink Floyd a lot more, which might be related.  I love Pink Floyd, but recently I've just been starting at the top of my ordered list, with Dark Side of the Moon, and letting it play through The Wall, Meddle, More, and Wish You Were Here, and just now I've incrased my collection by another four albums.

I don't know what's wrong.  Maybe there's something missing in my life.  I've normally thrived on monotony.  When I worked at my mom's place two summers ago, I enjoyed it, since I would wake up (albiet too early) and do the same thing every day.  I don't mind that.  In that respect, I'm a very boring person.  I can expand it to doing the same thing week after week, to suit a school schedule, but when my routine gets messed with, I tend to get very uncomfortable.  That's why I didn't enjoy the temporary work I did last summer and over the winter, since I would do one thing for a while, and then have something else interposed within it.  That's also a reason why I dislike vacations.  I go into a break knowing that I'll be doing either nothing or work, depending on the situation, for the next four weeks.  Having this three to five day vacation thrown in suddenly throws me off, as I won't be able to do what I want to, and instead have to do something related to the vacation, in some way.  So I don't think the problem is a same shit different day issue.

Like I said, it might be that there's something missing in my life.  But the only thing I can think of that would fit that bill is intimate female companionship.  And I completely and utterly lack the self confidence to try and seek that on my own volition.  While I don't care what others think of me, I do know that others do have various thoughts about me, and that governs their willingness to engage in social interaction with me.  And as I see myself, I don't find any appeal to members of the opposite sex, in general.  I know it's there, otherwise I wouldn't have so many female friends who are far away, or in a relationship.  But these people have all been either introduced to me through friends, or were online exclusive, which is a much easier interaction for me.  Online I can easily give a real impression of me, as opposed to the flawed perception that is gained through face to face interaction.  And so, since all the females I know have been through other friends, it is a different kind of building of a social relationship.  They get to know me through hanging out with the same friends as me, and so over time I can get to the point where they consider me a friend.  But I have no confidence in my ability to meet new people on my own.  Even when I have shown myself that I have an ability to easily interact well with total strangers, when plunged into a social situation like that.  But I am totally unable to plunge myself into that.  I need others to do it for me.

And yes, I have diagnosed that particular problem of mine, and while one might think that fixing it would be relatively easy, i.e. just forcing myself to do it, there are deeply rooted psychological barriers against it, that are hard to get over.

But then again, something missing might not be the cause of my current lethargy.  In which case, what is?"

"event","So a few days before break was over some random chick (who, by her picture, was quite hot) decided to add me to her facebook friends list.  Now, I'm not one to turn down random chicks who want to be my friend, but I was curious, so I looked at her profile.  And, true to my luck, she was already in a relationship with someone, who also has facebook.  And this person added me to his friends list just as I saw this.  So I end up paying it no mind and moved on.  A day later she messages me:

Hey Aaron, we should hang out sometime. Give me a call or drop me a message. My phone number is [removed]. Hope to hear from ya.

So this wasn't just a random thing.  And here's me, wondering who this person is.  So I message her back, asking who she is.  Response:

I saw you playing DDR in the Union. ~Kate~

So the moral of the story is: DDR gets you chicks.  The fact that she's attached is just due to my curse of only knowing chicks who are attached, or many miles away."

For the semester.

Done with finals, so now I'm at home, on this shitty pos 15"" moniter, which I discovered has a bent pin (like, bent all the way down).  So that might explain why it also has trouble with some games.  For example, with WoW, I had to shift some of my UI elements around, because they were being displayed too low on the screen.  I'm just glad I'm using a UI mod that lets me move stuff around.  I'd hate to see what would happen if I couldn't.  It would really suck to not be able to even play that game for these next four weeks.

"event","New Amy dream.

For some reason, I was having to leave somewhere, and the only way to do it was this catwalk, which happened to go over the stage of an Evanescence concert, of which I was totally unaware, which explained why I wasn't in the crowd.  So my parents are leading me away, and suddenly I realize I'm RIGHT ABOVE AMY, and so my mom, who's actually a really cool person when it comes to the things I like, suggessted that I stay and wait on top of the catwalk and watch the show.  For some strange reason, I didn't accept, or I fell off into the crowd, I don't quite remember exactly now.  Maybe I saw the end of it, like, the Whisper encore, and so I left immediately afterwards.  All I know is I was disappointed that I was only watching Amy for an extremely brief amount of time.

Then me and my parents go to a clothing store, and they happen to notice Amy in there browsing for stuff.  I didn't see her at first, and my parents were encouraging me to go over there and introduce myself.  So I position myself, browsing through merchandise, so that I would be able to see Amy as she came over and greet her as if I wasn't stalking her, which I wasn't, but I didn't want to weird her out.  So I'm looking through some shirts, she comes by and starts browsing, I look up, and am like ""You're Amy Lee, right?""  She responds with ""Yeah, I am.""  I extend my hand, she takes it and I go ""I'm Aaron, nice to meet you.""  Then we get into a conversation, and then my roommate's alarm wakes up."

I remembered how much I enjoyed them as a kid, and the best part was putting your finger through the hole in the middle and eating them off your finger.  But I was dismayed to find that with these new adult fingers, such an activity was possible.  This lead direction to the formation of <b>Good Idea #37</b>: marketing an adult size butter cookie.  The hole in the middle would be large enough to accomidate the finger of an adult male, and the rest of the cookie would be larger so that you get the same amount of total cookie per unit, and thus it is just a larger ring."

"event","Alright, first off, for those who visit BlizzLink, you've already seen the last part of this entry, so feel free to skip it.

Today I reaffirmed that the single most sexiest piece of clothing for a woman to wear is knee high leather boots, preferably with a lace up front (which we all know is decoration, as they all have the zipper on the inside side of the boot).  That look is just so incredibly hot that unless you're 5'1"" and weigh 400 lbs, I'd wanna do you right then and there.

Then this weekend was great.  First off was Ghost in the Shell 2.  If you liked the first one, or you liked SAC, you'll love this movie.  I do have to warn that it is very much a thinking movie; the action sequences are few and far between.  All of them are fucking awesome, but there isn't a whole lot of them.  The best part was the theater, though.  It was exactly like the AMC 30 back home, except it had a DDR machine (that only needed 2 tolkens!!!) and it had fruit punch in the soda fountain.  But the movie was excellent, and I'd recommend it to anyone who likes anime.  Especially since it's subbed!

Then the prerelease was on Saturday.  First flight I went 2-2, had a decent samurai + red removal deck, but I ran into a better one (the guy had Takeno and Konda and Oathkeeper, so he completely out bombed me), and then the next round I ran into the Blood Speaker/Fear Demon combo.  Second flight went much better.  I snagged Sosuke, Son of Seshiro, and Seshiro himself, so I had some phat snake beats.  Couple that with getting the red and white Hondons, and I completely trashed my opponents.  Round one was a 12 year old kid who didn't know what he was doing, round 2 was a guy who couldn't beat white Hondon, game 2 he just scooped after 4 turns of me having it out and him not drawing threats.  And then I drew the guy round 3, cause that's what you do.  So I came out 8 packs richer.

And now the disconnect due to copy and paste.

 had an interesting experience driving on Friday. My brother's taking us up to South Barrington, as it's the only place that's playing Ghost in the Shell 2, so here we are, on 355. We go through the toll express lanes, and we're in the rightmost of the two lanes. Suddenly, as we get out, we notice this guy in a black Mazda decide that he really needs to get into the far left lane, which is the lane just to the left of us. However, he's two lanes to our right. So we see him start moving at a 45 degree angle, at a speed of around 70 mph, give or take. Now, what do you think will happen when he straightens out in that far left lane?

You guessed it, his back end wanted to keep going, thanks to Mr. Newton. And, like far too many drivers out there, he turns OUT of the skid, so while his back end is going to the left, his front end is now going to the right. So now he's going completely perpendicular to traffic, on a busy highway.

Now, as me and my brother are both fairly inexperienced drivers (he's had his for almost a year, I've had mine for 4 weeks), we didn't immediately react to the guy going across the lanes. He was far enough in front that it wasn't a big deal. And when I saw his back end start going to the left, I initially thought ""Heh, what a dumbass,"" instead of it registering ""Slow down, he's a dumbass."" It wasn't until he starts going across traffic that me and my brother both realized ""Oh shit, we're gonna hit him.""

So my brother hits the brakes, and starts turning to the left. As it ends up, we scrape right by his back end, and by scrape I mean that literally. It ended up peeling back a bit of our bumper, so we gotta get a new one. But the damage is so small that if it were me, I wouldn't replace it, as I'm cheap.

So we get past this guy, and start accelerating again. My first thought is ""I'm so glad we didn't get into a serious collision."" My second thought is ""Hit and run."" So upon realizing this, I get my brother to pull over to the center median.

Another guy who saw what happened ends up pulling in front, to make sure we're ok. We never see the guy in the Mazda again, though from the pattern of traffic it was obvious that he was no longer in the roadway. We ended up waiting there four about 10 minutes before taking off, figuring that unless he has a crazy trick memory, he wouldn't know our license plate number. And, it was really his fault anyway."

"event","So, here's a post that contains more of my views on life, and a follow up to last post.  I'll put the follow up last, for those who may not want to hear about it.

So today we're going too talk about women, God's gift to the world.  It always saddens me when these lovely creatures decide to forsake the gifts God gave them, such as long sexy hair.  And many don't stop at having it at shoulder length.  They'll cut it extremely short.  This does indeed look cute on some, depending on the cut, and I can respect their wanting to do it, even if I don't agree with it.  But then there's the ones who get a more androgeneous cut, so that from the back I'm stuck going ""Is that a guy or a girl?""  It's a crime against nature.  The first thing I look for in determining attractiveness of a girl is weight.  I won't lie there, I'm like most other guys.  If you're a fat chick, there's a good chance I don't find you very attractive.  But the second thing I look at is hair.  Good hair is more important to me than any other part of a woman's body.

And then there's the problem of girls not wearing too many skirts or dresses these days.  And I'm not talking about wanting girls to wear the short stuff that seems to be the trend so that it barely covers their ass.  I'm talking about any length, from the mini to the floorlength.  The skirt (and the dress, though that's just a combination skirt and top) is a decidedly feminine thing, and it saddens me to see so many women abandoning it.  Sure, we live in a day of equality among the sexes, but that doesn't mean our bodies are equal.  Gender equality is a strictly moral issue.  It does not change the basic facts of what looks good on women, nor does it change the differences in the way male and female hardware works.  It is unfortuate, though, that we've taken it to mean precisely that.  However, all is not lost.  Go to a prom, or any other school dance, and count the number of girls wearing a tux/suit.  Then realize that deep down girls know that the skirt is a beautiful thing.

Now, for the update.  Two days ago I tried out the dildo for the first time.  I have to say, it was a rather pleasant experience.  It didn't hurt at all, as I used plenty of lubrication.  And I've taken dumps that were larger than it, and those didn't hurt.  Thus, the myth that anal sex has to hurt has been dispelled.  The trick is using a good amount of lubrication, as that's what causes pain in most cases.  The other thing is to go slow, so you can get used to the feeling.  I say that everyone should give it a try, as it seems to me that you should try it before you decide if you like it or not."

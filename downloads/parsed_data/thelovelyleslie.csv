"event","Sorry I haven't updated more but school/work and trying to salvage what little I have left of a social life has worn me out. I'm really sad that all of my friends are going of to college and mad at Scott for not coming and seeing me before he left (jerk) but Lauren and I got to go and feed the ducks at Lake Pine. We bought a $0.72 loaf of bread and fed the whole thing to the ducks. There were about 50 of them just crowded around us it was so cool. I think I going to eat lunch with Jeff tomorrow because he leaves for ECU on Saturday and I'm going to be really busy after school and all day Saturday.  I really wanted to spend a lot more time with him before he left. My brother has a belt test tomorrow and a tournament Saturday..that will be exciting. I went out and bought a sexy, black dress to wear to the dance after the tournament. ha ha Frank is going to be there..ooh la la."

"event","<P>This is going to be an exciting week! I got a lock on my screen name, I'm joining the cell phone club, school, and I'm engaged. I must be the happiest girl in the world. ;) So after I get my phone I get to call all my little Texans all the time! Horray. And I can call Scott in the middle of the night to tell him everything I ate that day. God life is good.</P>
<P>Today at work the microwave exploded. I was standing there making a smoothie and I smelled something burning. I went to ask Julie if she put something in the microwave and she said no. So I opened it up and all this smoke came out. So maybe it didn't explode..but something happened that wasn't good.</P>"

"event","Today at work, I answered the phone ""Hello"" on accident instead of ""Hi! This is KX Fitness, Leslie speaking. How may I help you?"" Then before the other person could even get a chance to talk I apologized and corrected myself. Well it turns out that it was the new sales manager and he call my manager and bitched about it for an hour. He thinks that I'm incompetent and that I can't do my job right. That was the only time I have ever messed up answering the phone in my 5 months of working there. He has only been there 2 weeks and he thinks that he has the right to tell me I'm not capable of doing my job?! He didn't even say anything to me..he went straight to my manager. Thankfully, my manager loves me and thinks I'm one of her best employees. She told him that she accidentally answers the phone like that sometimes and that he needs to just get over it. What a jackass. This is also the guy that was caught tanning while he was on the clock..Then my day got better! When my dad came to get me from work I was trying to do a whole bunch of stuff and I told my dad I'd be out in a few minutes. He decides he doesn't want to wait for me so he drives home. I call and ask him why the hell he left me at work and he said, ""You should have called me before hand to tell me you were going to be late. Its a pretty day. You can walk home."" Then when I got home he asked me to go and get my brother from his friends house and I said, ""No, its a pretty day you do it."" He got mad and my mom said that it served him right."

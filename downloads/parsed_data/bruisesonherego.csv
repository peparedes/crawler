"event","would you answer if i would call?  would you care if i would fall?  i've stumbled across you and i want to stay down here on the ground, but you're picking me up and putting me in my place.  why can't i stay?  at least you're trying to pick me up instead of kicking me while i lay here with my heart on my sleve and blood from love that i bleed for you.  i bleed love for <u>you</u>.  please fall to this ground i lay on so hard that i could probably sink into.  can you just lie here for awhile and lie to me?  i promise i'll get back up with you if you choose not to stay.  why wouldn't you stay?  i never said you have to throw yourself down here so that the ground hits you so hard, you are shattered.  of course that's why you're scared.  just lay so slowly, so softly.  come down, and i'll stop sinking.  i'll meet you half way.  then we can hold each other as we float to the floor... to my blood.  to my love. <3"

"event","my seed, your dirt.  your water, my hurt.  our flower never bloomed and now it's too late.  are we just so last season?  i am the seed that has been so buried by you, the dirt.  i've gotten so lost in a pile of you.  i couldn't escape.  you tried to make me grow using your charm and words as water, but i refused.  and now when i'm thirsty for you, this seed next to me which is buried and lost just as deep has allowed itsself to bloom.  it took in all of your water and so there is none left for me.  and all you can say is ""oh well.""  but i'm still thirsty for you.  and the flower <u>you</u> bloomed is just going to be picked up by someone else.  but i am still here.  i'm watiing until it rains.  i'll force mysefl to grow within the dirt so only you can see me.  please don't dig me out."

"event","i guess i'm never seeing you again.  this is what it's like to have it never matter and still hurt all the time.  we never even tried.  all those feelings i had to hide.  understanding what you don't want and keeping it inside.  where do all of these hidden feelings go when everything's over?  oh my god, it's over.  those words have never been so laughable and saddening in syncricity.  you reacted as if i had thrown it all at you with a force so untrue and you kept in mind all of those times that all of those stupid girls broke your heart just so i couldn't do it again... i wasn't even given a chance to break your heart.  it was over before it started but i tried in my head and my heart was just confused.  what was i to do?  i lied, kept it all away from you, even cried, and tried to think of something to do.  should i call or should i come see you?  listening to all of these songs that you said were for me... and reading between the lines of what they're saying.  i was never in your head.  so this is what it's like to have someone love someone who loves someone else who loves someone else?  i think i hate it.  no.  i have no energy to hate.  to love.  to feel.  for my body is a shell filled with emotion and nothing will ever get past my skin.  you'll have to rip me to shreds and stab a knife through my heart to get to what i feel.  even then, what would that tell you?  you don't care anyway."

"event","your memories lie in the pictures you carry around with you and feelings stay within them and words of yesterday never matter anymore when you see yourself in the past.  take this picture of us with you and look at it knowing we were happy and unknowing of right now and we were thinking we were so content with what we had found.   please remember those days of oblivion when nothing ever made sense but we didn't care anyway.  someone tell me what it was like.  i can't remember because this picture's all i have."

"event","she makes me smile.  is that comment about me?  is it to let me know you're free?  if it's not i don't know what to do.  even if it is, i don't know what we'd turn into.  it hurts to think it's not for me and maybe you don't want to let these feelings be.  it hurts to think that i'd have to give up other opportunities and let these feelings become calm friendship peace.  i feel it in my heart still.  the tension wont ease up.  take me if you will.  tell me i'm the one you dream of.  do you think of me?  and when you do, do you smile?  please let me see... i bet it's stretched out a mile."

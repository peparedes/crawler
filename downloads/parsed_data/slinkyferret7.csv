if I thought people would actually by my stuff, there is a good chunk of me that would say fuck it to a real life and just sit in a studio and throw LOTS of paint on canvas...WITH ELECTRICAL WIRES AND DUCTING!!!

another bright note, my dad sent me an article in the news today about advanced degrees in nursing. Specifically a new program thats emerging called DNP. Which is basically a Doctor Nurse. You get two extra years of training....one of those being ""residency"" and have to take a very similar exam to what med students have to take. While I decided long ago that I don't really need my father's acceptance of my choice to most likely not attend medical school, its nice to know that he's coming to terms with the idea that none of his children are going to be a lawyer, MD, or pilot and that that's ok.

Now if I can minimize the buttheadedness he will no doubt expel from every pore on his body about my mom attending graduation and, god forbid spending time with me while she's here, I'll be set.

Karen gets a few people ahead of me in line and thus, gets on the plane before/without me. When it gets to be my turn at the gate, the gate agent looks at my passport, shakes her head and tells me I cannot board because I might have had novocaine in my system within the last year and that I have to wait until they get a blood sample and test it. The plane with karen takes off and I'm stuck in what is presumably LAX. Meanwhile I am the MOST pissed off thing ever screaming about how I paid all this damn money and by god I'm getting on the next plane. Eventually some reeies show up and I get on new plane and we take off. And it only takes 3 hrs, according to the flight attendant. During that time though, I start freaking out about wanting to go to Japan to see a friend there. Once we land in Spain, i end up chasing down a bus that my middle sister and some reed friends got on without me. Audrey yells at me for dressing like a whore and asks if i want to go to the beach since i'm basically only wearing a swimsuit for a shirt. I look down and my bra is just showing a little bit. Then audrey and i sort of piss at eachother till we get to the hotel. Turns out, Karen is at a different and much nicer hotel but since my oldest sister Laura had stayed at this place once, we had to too. And there was a cat with beautifully embroidered rectangles of fabric instead of eyes.

weird. just weird.

"event","Had a meeting with my thesis advisors today. Could have gone a lot worse, really. Most of their issues were also issues of mine. The biggest problem I'm having though is every time I meet with jennifer she tells me the project is looking at something different from the last time we agreed on what it was about. GAH! makes setting up stat relationships i'll wanna look at in a few weeks a real pain in the ass. On the bright side, I will have all my lab work done by the end of this week.....gods willing.

Been talking to that canadian kid a lot recently. good times. rather fond of it.

this is a bit of a late post for it but hey, jess, when you read this Happy Birthday...again ;)

SOOOOOOO much guitar hero.(Sorry joni, you're going to hate me after you hear Killer Queen about 20 times a day. I'll try to tone it down.)

I crave a cheap ass but decent sewing machine. Anna, HELP!!?!?"

"event","apparently my dad's gf found some people from china to work with her instead. Bummer. I could have used that money. Oh well. Guess I'll just have to work more in the colony.

things have finally settled down with my love life for awhile. well, as much as they ever do.

Am enjoying the subtle knife and some time alone.

I could use a new coat and possibly a plain hoodie. My black one is getting gross.

Life is good.

Finished up the major work at the dentist."

"event","well thats interesting. my dad's gf wants someone to travel with her to atlanta to help with her show. Pay is 200 bucks a day with free hotel and airfare. Mighty tempting since its like 4 days. 800 bucks could be very very nice to have indeed. Plus the 200 i will make while they're in portland. Wowzer. But that would also mean a weekend with my dad's gf. Ugh."

"event","christmas is fucking exhausting. Was nice to spend time with me nieces. Got a new lappy and some other things I've been needing (socks, underpants...the usual) and one of those laps to help keep us sun deprived california transplants from going crazy. Always good. My cell phone number maybe be changing in the near future. Will inform folk when/if that happens.

hope the holidays are going well for you all."

"event","- choosing between painting and clinical psych is HARD. Wah.
- paint is not my best medium for artsy farsty fun.
- I'm going to be taking a lot of dance classes next semester.
- there are in fact some men that look good in tight hipster jeans. i thought it was impossible.
- vegan zucchini bread is less crumbly and therefore superior to this using eggs bidness.
- after realizing i say balls too often to be allowed near by nieces when I go home, I'm going to attempt to replace it with a less awkward word. Sparta is the most likely replacement. Seems to work well around this apartment recently.
- i should probably buck up and get my own phone plan. my current phone is dying and I don't wanna get stuck with the contract breaking fee if I renew my contract with verizon to get a new phone. I'm not really excited about paying 40 bucks a month though. Maybe I'll do a pay as you go thing. What sort of plans to do you people have?
- I'm done with finals. WOO!!!"

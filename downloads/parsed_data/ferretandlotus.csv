"event","So I was goofing off on the HGTV.com site and I found this handy little organizer. It's totally free and you get to create it yourself. Instead of it being a big,bulky organizer. It's a folded piece of paper. OK I know I thought it was weird too but it actually is really cool. It's a piece of paper folded 6 times. Just go to the site,then build your organizer then print it out. It's free and you can get a new one whenever you need one.

The website is www.pocketmod.com

Enjoy!

"event","I spent the first half of the day cleaning the house and finishing up some organizing upstairs. So now I'll have to do is get off my ass and get some new end tables. A friend of mine is going to go with me to look at some of the fab thrift shops we have here in Minot. I'm excited. Jared is ready to go back to school and he finally got his school/work schedule. Which unfortunately isn't the schedule we want but, I guess when all of this hectic-ness is done it'll be worth it. Right? Goddess I hope so. So here is glimpse of our schedules just in case any of you need to get ahold of us you'll know when is a good time to call. I will be at work from 7:30-1:30 and then school from 2:00-4:30 then home to make dinner, clean and do homework and hit the sack at 8:30pm. And Jared will have a similar schedule. He goes to school from 1-3:30pm then to work till 11 pm then he comes home and eats then gets to bed at like 3 am. So we are barely going to see each other. But you know school is important I guess. 

Well I have still more cleaning and some laundry to finish up.

Love you all

The vet told us that we need to get her leg xrayed to see how bad the damage is and then we need to put her on supplements to halt any further damage. You know for the amount of money we paid for this damn dog you think she would oh I don't know NOT FALL APART ON ME!!! But that is what I get for making her fat. And to top it off the vet told me that Dutchess is still fat. I mean come on I swear that this freaking vets want to her to be anorexic.

"event","Jared, the dogs and I all went to Colorado for 2 weeks and had a wonderful time. It was so good to see everyone again. It's been far too long since I've been back. My cousin Brandy Michelle and I were talking and we think that it had been 6 years since I'd been there. And of course J had never been there. Let see Trace and Aaron and beanie were there, along with our parents and our brother Chris and his two girls. I was so excited to see my family, the trip down seemed to take forever. I know that its only like 6 from Cheyenne (where we stopped the first night) but I was just so excited to get there that it seemed to take forever. 

So we've been home for a week and we managed to finally get stuff up on the walls. Family pictures and what not so the house actually looks pulled together and nice.

Jared found out that he can't stay here in Minot to do his AECP (the program where the AF pays for his college). Which sucks be we have a working plan. He's going to go up to Grand Forks ND (about 4 hours away from here) and go to UND (university of north dakota) and I'll stay here in the new house. I know that it sounds weird but it should only be for about 2 years. I know that there are some people who were looking forward to us coming to WA and I'm bummed we can't but right now its just not feasible for us to move and sell the house. We love it far to much here and we really don't want to leave. So J will put in for his ""first"" base as a officer in his jr year and he should be able to find out shortly after that. So once he's done with school we'll figure out where we are going and pack up and move there. Hopefully we will either the west coast or here. Well it is very late and even though I am having a blast on my new computer I should go to bed.

Love to you all

"event","Finally after what seemed like the longest freaking month of my life we are all moved in.Mostly everything is unpacked but there are still some things. My good friend Beth and her husband Nathan  came (with their truck and trailer) today to help us move out the remaining stuff. It was fun for me and Beth, We sat on out asses reading trashy mags and gossiping. The guys moved everything. Hehehe gotta love em. So I realized that I didn't give you guys any details on my new house. So here they are.

1971 4 bedroom/2 bath Ranch (totally updated and kick ass because Eric worked his butt off fixing itup)

Finished Basement(which is a total blessing Thanks to Eric)

1/2 Acre fenced in backyard with garden,basketball hoop( and small court),storage shed and built on dog house.

The house has blue siding and white trim

Let see what else...OH yeah 2 count em 2 apple trees (and lots more trees I just dont know what they are) 


I'm working on getting pictures to post and currently we don't have Internet at the new house (we have to drive to the rental to use wireless) So it'll take me about another week to get the pictures up.


Lets see oh yes In July Jared and I are going to Colorado for a Bradford Family Reunion and 4th of July BBQ. For those of you who care to know Trace and Aaron are going too. We are really excited. This is the first time Jared and Aaron will meet our entire family at once. BRING ON THE PROZAC!!!

Ok well it is getting late and I need to head home to let out the dogs (yes they are housebroken now..well almost) and go to bed.

I'll talk to everyone soon. Angel and Melinda I'll call you guys next weekend to chat.

Love you all

"event","I got a new schedule at work. Now I will be working M-Th 9am- 530pm at TWO DIFFERENT Locations. I will work 9-3 at the Main Head Start Center and then 330-530 at The Jefferson Child Care Center. Yippee! Actually I am happy about it because I'll be making about $40 extra a week. So that is good. I still love working, Jefferson is a little challenging b/c there are a lot of handicapped children who require more care. But I know I'll get the hang of it eventually. Well I should run the house is messy and needs a good cleaning.


I love you all

"event","at Head Start filling out all the required paperwork and meeting some of the staff. I already know that I'm going to really like working up there. The people there are great, really sweet and welcoming. I still don't know what age kids I'll have. I'll find that out Monday morning at 830am. So today I have to go to the Fed building and get some stuff straight then off to get my official ID/time card. I have today and tommorow off due to a NDEA Conference. And of course we don't work Sats or suns. Anyways, I'm off to eat breakfast and what not. I was so tired last nite. I was up all Tuesday nite worried that I wasn't going to get the job that last nite I passed out at 6 pm so after 14 hours of sleep, I'm starving."

"event","When I heard about the lastest school shooting I started thinking about Columbine again. It surprises me to see that still no one has learned anything. Columbine was horrible as were the other horrific school shootings..but when do we as a society step back and say ""what the fuck? How come this keeps happening?"" Heres a simple concept that some people would do good to latch on too. LISTEN TO WHAT THE CHILDREN ARE SAYING, STOP ASSUMING THAT BECUASE YOU DIDN'T GET PICKED ON IN SCHOOL THAT KIDS TODAY DON'T GET PICKED ON. AND TO ALL THE PARENTS OUT THERE. WHY DON'T YOU STEP UP AND SUPPORT YOUR KIDS, BITCH TO YOUR SCHOOL BOARDS, DON'T LET BULLIES GET AWAY WITH ANYTHING..BECUASE THE LONGER WE IGNORE THE POOR CHILDREN BEING PICKED ON THE MORE AND MORE SCHOOL SHOOTINGS WE WILL HAVE.  I think that everyone should take a page from Marilyn Manson's Book..I know he is not eveyones favorite person and some of you are probably diluted to the fact that he is a bad person and he what not....but he was interviewed for the movie ""Bowling for Columbine"" and let me tell you his response was the best. Micheal Moore asked him ""If you could say anything to today's youth what would you say?"" Manson's response ""Nothing, I would listen"" Now tell me if he is such a bad man how come he has the right idea? How come he is willing to stop and listen rather than judge and brush off?? Huh? I ask you....what do you do? Do you listen? Cause if you don't then I blame you for all the shootings..and I hope that you fall asleep every night knowing you are part of the reason that kids are being shot at school."

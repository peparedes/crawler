House news--- it's back to painting.  I wish that I would just finish all the rooms in my house in one summer instead of just painting one or two.  It's taking a long time to finish.  This summer's plans are the kitchen cupboards and the den.. :)  Someday my bedroom will be done."

I am a very pregnant lady-38 weeks along now.  It seems so crazy--me..38 wks pregnant.  Now Ck and i are just waiting for the little man to make his debut.  We can't wait to meet him. It might sound all cliche, but we are already so in love with this little boy.  Everything that we've bought for him has been carefully chosen and thought out.  His room is so beautiful.  The only things left to do are to hang some things on his walls.  All of his clothes are washed and folded carefully in his baskets.  All separated by size, item, etc.  You can't have onesies with pj's, dontcha know?! :)  At night when I should be sleeping I am instead thinking of what my life is going to be like as a mom. thinking about what i want to teach him, how i want to be, all the dreams and aspirations i have for him.

in other news.. we have a little kitty. Well, technically she's not little. She's 3 yrs old. Meowie. named because she loves to ""talk"".... she is tiger-striped and very lovey. She was abandoned and lived on our deck.  Once we fed her and let her inside, she ""adopted"" us formally.  A trip to the vet's office got her all squared away.. shots were administered, flea medicine was given, tests were done, and it was all pronounced... that the kitty now belongs to us. Ck has never really cared for cats, but he adores Meowie. he's the one who always wants to buy her a toy or treat.  She spends her days outside and snuggles with us on the evenings until we go to bed.. for now the arrangement is satisfactory to all of us.  Probably in the winter we will transistion her to a full-time indoor cat.  She loves to snuggle and sleep.

hopefully this will be updated very soon....."

"event","Poor forgotten blog. Working full-time and being pregnant leaves me exhausted at night and the blog is suffering as a result.

Found out on Friday that we are having a little boy.  A little boy!! Wow!  It's so exciting to finally know.  Now we can buy baby things.  So far we bought a few outfits, a baby book, and his first blankie. His blankie is amazing. It's so soft, I just love it.

This weekend we are planning to go to Chicago to do some major shopping.

I guess the nesting bug has hit me. I've got new curtains for my dining room, finally hung pictures up on walls, rearranged furniture in rooms, and have been getting rid of things like crazy. It's like I can't get rid of enough stuff. Sadly, this purging hasn't extended to my scraproom yet.  Supplies are plentiful in there.

My clothes all fit me really badly now.  My stomach is the only part that's really grown during my pregnancy.  Although I haven't gained much weight, my tummy looks like it has a soccer ball in it.

I am so excited these days.  Just loving life."

I started becoming interested in the stock market with my first finance class eight million years ago.
I have a subscription to the Wall St. Journal newspaper.
I read it everyday.
I have called the Wall St. Journal and complained if my paper comes late or ruined.
I have bought the paper at the store when my carrier doesn't bring it at all.
I have a huge stack of newspapers in a basket in my living room.
I save articles I especially like in a binder.
I have given stock advice to others and they have earned money.
Did you know that Martha Stewart was once a stockbroker?
I have contemplated becoming a certified financial planner more than a million times."

Why am I procrastinating writing my term paper? Why?  I know I'll enjoy it, but I'm just having a tough time getting started.  Maybe it's because I have so many papers to write this semester?  

Grade-wise, I am doing fabulously so far. Thankfully.

Ck is in Pa doing some recruiting. He's having a good time. He did a bunch of interviews today & said he had a lot of great candidates.  He comes home on Saturday.

Jamie's mom gave me three ferns on Saturday. I transferred them to different pots and in plant stands. I just love them!  Ferns rock.  Now i have 5 ferns in my house.  All of them are Boston ferns.

I'm so tired.  Last night I stayed up way too late doing homework.

Senator Baraack Obama was on Oprah today.  He's an Illinois Senator.  While I think he's genuinely a great person and a good husband and father, I don't always agree with his voting record. Yes,I am a nerd and get copies of all Illinois Senators votes and Representative's votes.   And yes, again a nerd, I email the Senators all the time and let them know issues I am interested in.  I 99% of the time always agree with D. Durban's votes.  I think he is a great Senator.

Meeting Sarah tonight for dinner. I'm excited to see her, it's been awhile.  Since the summer, actually.

Peace out"

It takes forever to get to my name and sweltering in the gown for me is no fun.&nbsp; soooo....&nbsp; Ck said we can do whatever I want to do to celebrate the big day.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Next weekend we are going on the Fall Foliage cruise that we won from Ck's work.&nbsp; It's an all-day thing and should be lots of fun. I'm pretty excited.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />I love fall. Love cooler weather and changing leaves.<br /><br />Sears is going to replace our refrigerator.&nbsp; The ice maker has been just wrong for ages.&nbsp; We've had approximately 6 appointments with the repair team where they have tried to fix it to no avail. yay for new frig<br /></font>"

I'll invite a few close friends and make some yummy appetizers.<br /><br />Speaking of my house..... The downstairs is all painted!!&nbsp; It's been the summer of painting. 5 rooms!!!&nbsp;&nbsp; Now all that's left is the garage, basement, and upstairs.&nbsp; And the deck. Ck and I are going to start on the deck in a few weekends.<br /><br />This Saturday we are going to Chicago to the Field Museum. We're going to see the King Tut exhibit. I'm super psyched!<br />I love going to the city and to museums.<br /></font></p>"

"event","poor neglected blog... 
i've been a very bad blog-keeper. my life has gone into crazy mode... can you tell it's almost time for finals? papers due, projects due, presentations presented.. exams.. quizzes.. it's crunch time.

last weekend, and i mean ALL weekend, ck and i tackled our dining room.
let's skip back to the BEFORE part... hmmm wallpaper.. two kinds of wallpaper separated in the middle with a border. I appreciate wallpaper, but not the stuff that was in my dining room. Ck and i decided to conquer our fear of removing wallpaper. You see, everyone has been telling us such horror stories about the removal of wallpaper that we've lived a whole year in this house with some pretty ugly wallpaper in some rooms. 

I have to tell you, readers, that all the horror stories of wallpaper removal were well-founded and not exaggerated at all. We were lulled into a false sense when the top portion of the wallpaper came off in no time at all, 15 minutes tops for the whole room. The bottom portion & border of the wallpaper weren't so generous. it took me 12 non-stop hours to remove PART of one wall. Skipping ahead, all in all it took 2 days just to remove wallpaper. Then we had to sand the walls. Prime the walls.. and finally Paint the walls. The results of all our hardwork really paid off though. Our dining room is gorgeous now!!! I selected a page out of Pottery Barn to use as Inspiration. (side note, Pottery barn catalogs are my CRACK). 

the page has an almost identical dining room table to ours in it. Armed with the page, I went to Benjamin Moore and brought home Chincilla blue paint for our dining room. It looks amazing! Now all our dining room needs is: new curtains, new chandelier, carpet removed, crown-molding put up, and some pictures hung on the walls. I can go into my dining room and feel such pleasure. I can see all my hard work went to creating a beautiful room. :)

My friend Jamie came over this morning and LOVES the room!! She couldn't stop saying such nice compliments.

Next up... removing the hideous chicken and heart patterned wallpaper in the kitchen. yes, chicken and hearts. it's revolting."

the site that i paid $200 to use keeps kicking me out...shutting down... rulings and procedures will show up only to dissappear seconds later. internal revenue codes are scrolling by about 200 miles per hour.
in short, the site is possessed by a devil... or that's what i'm thinking...
i'm ready, ready, super ready to pull my hair out.
now i just got a stupid message, after being kicked off the site, that i am logged onto the site and it won't allow multiple log-ins on different computers at the same time. that i'll have to wait till my session times out, in an hour, to resign in... ohhhh- and don't forget to sign out properly to avoid this.... SIGN OUT PROPERLY- I never signed out in the first place..#$%*! 
I hate this assignment.
I hate tax research assignments.
They suck.
I hate the website.
Hate the codes, rulings, legal opinions, rulings, and so on..
Oh, and Editorials- i hate you the most.  you secretly lure me into thinking that you are a primary source with your fancy words.. then after reading your boring diatributes on tax issues i realize you ARE A SECONDARY source.. thus USELESS TO ME!
god help me make it to spring break
serenity now.
oh, and thank you mr.managerial/cost/you suck teacher, for assigning me that project THAT'S DUE on WEDNESDAY.. thanks for assigning it today.. i'm not busy enough.. Let's see.. i've already got an 8 pg research paper due that day and a tax research assignment (that's killing me) due the same day.

"event","It's a new year...  I love new years..  I firmly believe that anything can be changed, anything can be improved, anything can be renewed... new years bring new possibilities.. new opportunities to be savored.. new things to be learned.

i've been purging my life.. purging out things i don't need. it's amazing how closets can hide so many things. how i can hold onto so many useless papers and trinkets that i really don't need.  how i keep those jeans that i haven't worn in two years.  this year, 2006, i am all about simplicity..  what a lovely word that is.  i've been rearranging, rediscovering little treasures, renewing my mind. 

last summer i started feeling a bit depressed. no reason really as to why. just a little depressed. sadly it has lingered longer than i've wanted it to. i can happily say that i can feel that starting to shift away.  i'm starting to feel like myself again. to feel creative and hopeful and rejuvinated.  thank heavens. you see, a new year is so powerful. :-)

Happy 2006 to everyone.. May it be a wonderous year.."

<P><FONT size=4>my friend maria came to stay with us for a few days. it was so good seeing her.&nbsp; the visit went by way too quickly though.&nbsp; i wish she lived closer.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=4>tomorrow ck's parents are coming.&nbsp; i'm feeling a little nervous. worrying about everything- do i have enough towels, what do they eat, etc....&nbsp; by nature I am a fretter, so this worrying is nothing new.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=4>i haven't mailed out any gifts yet. working two jobs leaves very little time. i went to the post office the other day to mail out some stuff- waited in line forever and realized my lunch break was about to end. so i didn't get anything sent out.&nbsp; i hope noone is upset w/ the late stuff. i wish that a] post offices were open longer b] i wasn't running around like crazy c] next year i'll have all my shopping done by november so i can mail everything out early.&nbsp; with the demands of school, work, and taking care of a house i'm not sure how i can pull c] off.</FONT></P>

"event","The fall semester is finally come to a screeching halt.  It ended with the most difficult final I've ever had the displeasure of taking. UGH. at 7:50 am i suffered through a painfully hard exam.  after completing it and walking down the hall of the college of business, i realized that the semester had officially ended for me. but i didn't feel any relief from that fact. instead i felt dread and apprehension. i worked more dilligently this semester than ever before.  often spending 8 hours a night at the library and oddily enough it's the semester that i did the worst in..  the cost/benefit analysis that i do doesn't add up.

  Those semesters of row's of perfect A's has ended, I do believe.  My academic advisor told me that employers really don't want to hire people with straight A's because they worry that they will burn out.  I think she was just telling me that to make me feel better as I prepare for all B's and a lone A.  UGH! I just don't understand what I could have done better. But I need to distract my mind from this consuming thing...

other news... My SIS Had her BABY!!!  She had another girl. She named the new bundle- Arianna Caitlyn. Ari was born on Pearl Harbor day. She's a little baby weighing 6 lbs and 10 oz at birth and was 20 inches ""tall"".   My sis says that Ari has blond hair.  She just sounds so adorable.  I really want to meet Ari and to see Nellie and Vallie.  I miss my family.  The last time I saw them was a sad time with my grams being ill and going to heaven. I want to see my family as a happy occasion.  I should plan a trip.

other news.... Ck and I got our tree. It's a basalm (balsam?) fir. it's tall and smells heavenly.  we got decorations .. tonight will be tree trimming night.  we'll listen to the cd ""Charlie Brown Christmas"" as we decorate. I am super excited...

maria will be here on saturday for four days. i can't wait to see her. the day she leaves ck's parents are coming to stay. which means, we'll have guests for the holidays. our first holiday guests ever. i am extremely nervous worrying about every stinking detail. i need to just relax, it will be fine. i worry too much.

over break i'll be doing a temporary job at an insurance company doing some tax auditing.

today i plan on doing laundry, reading ""memoirs of a geisha"".. relaxing. no more finals. no more assignments... can finally finish christmas shopping. can decorate.  can do all the many things i've been aching to do all semester when i had to study.. i will get more than 3 hours of sleep a night. i won't be at the library more than i'm at home.

i'm worn out. bubble bath- rescue me."

"event","<P>This has been a busy week.&nbsp; On Monday I gave my presentation in MQM.&nbsp; It went well.&nbsp; I am so thankful to be done with that. I'm not overly fond of public speaking.&nbsp; I hope I get a good grade on it.&nbsp; I've been studying, studying, studying all week.&nbsp; Last night Danielle and I spent 3 hours doing homework for int accounting class.&nbsp; We are getting together again tomorrow to do another chapter.&nbsp; Then on Sunday I'm meeting all the girls to do Cost accounting. UGh!! But the good news is that I only have one more week of classes. Then a week of finals. Then I'm done.. :)</P>

<P>Ck and I made a wreath last weekend.&nbsp; We went to Hobby Lobby and they had dried naturals and wreath stuff all on sale for 50% off so we picked up a bunch of stuff. The wreath looks AWESOME.&nbsp; it took us about 2 hours to get it all put together.&nbsp; We drank pomengrante tea and listened to Cuban music while crafting. It was a lot of fun.&nbsp; I want us now to make a wreath out of evergreens for our front door.</P>
<P>Ck and I are going to eat dinner at a Thai restaurant tonight. I'm super excited.&nbsp; I love Thai food!!!&nbsp; We haven't gone out on a dinner date in a long time.</P>

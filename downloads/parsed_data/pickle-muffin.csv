Guns N Roses Lyrics

Patience 



1,2,1,2,3,4
[whistle]
Shed a tear 'cause I'm missin' you
I'm still alright to smile
Girl, I think about you every day now
Was a time when I wasn't sure
But you set my mind at ease
There is no doubt
You're in my heart now

Said, woman, take it slow
It'll work itself out fine
All we need is just a little patience
Said, sugar, make it slow
And we come together fine
All we need is just a little patience
(patience)
Mm, yeah

I sit here on the stairs
'Cause I'd rather be alone
If I can't have you right now
I'll wait, dear
Sometimes I get so tense
But I can't speed up the time
But you know, love
There's one more thing to consider

Said, woman, take it slow
And things will be just fine
You and I'll just use a little patience
Said, sugar, take the time
'Cause the lights are shining bright
You and I've got what it takes
To make it, We won't fake it,
I'll never break it
'cause I can't take it

[whistle]
...little patience, mm yeah, mm yeah
need a little patience, yeah
just a little patience, yeah
some more patience, yeah
need some patience, yeah
could use some patience, yeah
gotta have some patience, yeah
all it takes is patience,
just a little patience
is all you need *

I BEEN WALKIN' THE STREETS AT NIGHT
JUST TRYIN' TO GET IT RIGHT
HARD TO SEE WITH SO MANY AROUND
YOU KNOW I DON'T LIKE
BEING STUCK IN THE CROWD
AND THE STREETS DON'T CHANGE
BUT BABY THE NAME
I AIN'T GOT TIME FOR THE GAME
'CAUSE I NEED YOU
YEAH, YEAH, BUT I NEED YOU
OO, I NEED YOU
WHOA, I NEED YOU
OO, ALL THIS TIME **
(ah)

 P.S. here goes....

 What is Love??? 
A group of 4 to 8 year-olds was asked, ""What does love mean?"" The answers they gave were broader and deeper than anyone could have imagined. 
 
--""When my grandmother got arthritis, she couldn't bend over and paint 
    her toenails anymore.     So my grandfather does it for her all the 
    time,even  when his hands got arthritis too. That's  love."" (Rebecca - age 8 ) 
 
--""When someone loves you, the way they say your name is different. 
    You know that your name is safe in their mouth."" (Billy - age 4) 
 
--""Love is when you go out to eat and give somebody most of your 
    French fries without making them give you any of theirs."" (Chrissy -   age 6 ) 
 
--""Love is what makes you smile when you're tired."" (Terri - age 4 ) 
 
--""Love is when my mommy makes coffee for my daddy and she takes a sip 
    before giving it to     him, to make sure the taste is OK."" (Danny -   age 7 ) 
 
--""Love is when you tell a guy you like his shirt, then he wears it everyday"" (Tina - age 7) 
 
--""Love is like a little old woman and a little old man who are still 
    friends even after they know each other so well."" (Tommy - age 6 ) 
--""During my piano recital, I was on a stage and scared. I looked at 
    all the people watching me and saw my daddy waving and smiling. He 
    was the only one doing that. I wasn't scared anymore.That's love"" 
    (Cindy -age 8) 
 
--""My mommy loves me more than anybody. You don't see anyone else 
    kissing me to sleep at night.""    (Clare - Age 5) 
--""Love is when mommy gives daddy the best piece of chicken."" (Elaine - 
    age 5) 
 
--""Love is when your puppy licks your face even after you left him 
    alone all day."" 
    (Mary Ann - age 4 ) 
 
-""I know my older sister loves me because she gives me all her old 
    clothes and has to go out and buy new ones."" (Lauren - age 4 ) 
 
--""I let my big sister pick on me because my Mom says she only picks 
    on me because she loves me. So I pick on my baby sister because 
    I love her."" (Bethany - age 4) 
 
Love............ is not only made for lovers....... its also for friends who love each other sometimes better than lovers do. Smile and spread some love today.  :-) 
 
:D"

MERRY CHRISTMAS AND HAPPY HOLIDAYS!


P.S. thought this little story was in the giving spirit:(my grandma sent it to me by e-mail hope ya'll like it)

 
Little Leroy came into the kitchen where his mother was making dinner.

 His birthday was coming up and he thought this was a good time to tell his mother what he wanted. ""Mom, I want a bike for my birthday.""

 Little Leroy was a bit of a troublemaker.
 He had gotten into trouble at school and at home.
 Leroy's mother asked him if he thought he deserved to get a bike for his birthday. Little Leroy, of course, thought he did.
Leroy's mother, being a Christian woman, wanted him to reflect on his behavior over the last year and write a letter to God and tell him why he deserved a bike for his birthday.
 Little Leroy stomped up the steps to his room and sat down to write
 God a letter.
 LETTER 1:
 Dear God:
 I have been a very good boy this year and I would like a bike for my birthday. I want a red one.
 Your friend,
 Leroy

 Leroy knew this wasn't true.
 He had not been a very good boy this year, so he tore up the letter and started over.

 LETTER 2:
 Dear God:
 This is your friend Leroy.
 I have been a pretty good boy this year, and I would like a red bike for my birthday. 
Thank you,
 Leroy

 Leroy knew this wasn't true either. He tore up the letter and started again.

 LETTER 3:
 Dear God:
 I have been an OK boy this year and I would really like a red bike for my birthday.
 Leroy
 Leroy knew he could not send this letter to God either, so he wrote another letter.

 LETTER 4:
 Dear God:
 I know I haven't been a good boy this year. I am very sorry. I will be a good boy if you just send me a red bike for my birthday.
 Thank you,
 Leroy < BR>> Leroy knew, even if it was true, this letter was not going to get him a bike.

 By now, Leroy was very upset.
 He went downstairs and told his mother he wanted to go to  church.
Leroy's mother thought her plan had worked because Leroy looked very sad. ""Just be home in time for dinner,"" his mother said.
 Leroy walked down the street to the church and up to the altar. He looked around to see if anyone was there. He picked up a statue of the Virgin Mary. He slipped it under his shirt and ran out of the church, down the street, into his house, and up to his room.

 He shut the door to his room and sat down with a piece of paper and a pen.

 Leroy began to write his letter to God.

 LETTER 5:
 I GOT YOUR MAMA.

 IF YOU WANT TO SEE HER AGAIN, SEND THE BIKE.

 Signed,

 YOU KNOW WHO


(hehehe happy holidays ,i personally liked this story):D"

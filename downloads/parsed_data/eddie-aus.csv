"event","In comments to my previous post, we got onto 1 = 0.999... recurring. This is in fact true, and the answer is in my reply comment to the previous comments.

Further about infinities, we have that we can just fill in a hole if we have a well-behaved area of maths. As Babso has pointed out, there should be a little bit extra left over when you calculate 1 - 0.999.... = 0.0...01, where there are an infinite number of zeros. However, since the real numbers are well behaved, then actually there is no difference, and 1 - 0.99..... = 0 exactly.

The difference is in maths in terms of limits of sequences. If you can get close enough for any element along the sequence, then the limit exists, and you can just fill in the whole. It all comes down to infinity again... 0.0...01, with an infinite number of zeros is in fact a well defined concept, since it is a limit of a sequence. There's a concept in maths which is 'dense' ness. The best example of denseness is in terms of rational numbers and real numbers. The rational numbers are dense in the real numbers. This means that between each pair of rational numbers, we can find a real number between the two, and between each pair of real numbers we can find a rational number.

No matter how close these numbers are, we can always find a real number between a pair of rational numbers and a rational between each pair of real numbers. This is an amazing fact of the real numbers. In fact, we define real number as the limit of sequences of rational numbers. So we fill in the holes between the rational numbers to obtain the real numbers. This is a definition of the real numbers that get around the problems above.

Just as a brief revision, rational numbers are all numbers that can be written as p/q, where p and q are both integers, and real numbers are those numbers that cannot be written as p/q, such as pi or the square root of two.

Another amazing fact is that there are as many rational numbers as integers, and there are as many integers as natural numbers, and there are as many natural numbers as even numbers.... :)"

"event","Hey all who infrequently read my lj. I think this is mostly because I post to the lj infrequently. Anyhoo, Hi crowd!

(*tumbleweed...*)

Quick update on my life. Pure Maths Honours.

(*more tumbleweed...*).

Okay, so maths is an inaccessible subject to many. Fine. Time to make it a freaky and kinda interesting subject. Did you know that we have had the last date made from entirely odd digits for ages? The last date was the 19th of November, 1999 : yes 19/11/1999. And how long a time until the next entirely odd date? Well, the next one is the 1st of January 3111. That's over a millenium away folks.

But that isn't the cool bit. The really neato bit is that recently we had the first date with entirely even digits for a while. The date was the 2nd of February 2000. Not only was it within three months of the last odd date for the next millienium, but it was the first even date since the 30th of December 888. That, also was 1111 years ago.

So people will see Hayley's Comet pass with monotonous regularity - unless someone blows it up, or it hits us - but it will take another milenium for someone to see a date composed entirely of even digits and a date composed entirely of odd digits.

A brief aside for the not so maths savvy. Why is zero even? Short answer without formulae is that the digits go (..., even, odd, even, odd, even, odd, ...) and zero is sandwiched between two odds. Kind of a familiar feeling really...

I'll post some even weirder maths later that will require at least second year uni knowledge, but I'll attempt to explain to the layman.

Oh yeah, I am procrastinating, in case you weren't wondering. :)"

Notice of Revocation of Independence

To the citizens of the United States of America

In the light of your recent failure to elect a reasonable President and thus
to govern yourselves, we hereby give notice of the revocation of your
independence, effective today...


...Her Sovereign Majesty Queen Elizabeth II will resume monarchical duties
over all states, commonwealths and other territories. Except Utah, which she
does not fancy. Your new Prime Minister (Tony Blair for the 97.85% of you
who have until now been unaware that there is a world outside your borders)
will appoint a Minister for America without the need for further elections.
Congress and the Senate will be disbanded. A questionnaire will be
circulated next year to determine whether any of you noticed.

To aid to the transition to a British Crown Dependency, the following rules
are introduced with immediate effect:

* You should look up ""revocation"" in the Oxford English Dictionary. Then
look up ""aluminium"". Check the pronunciation guide. You will be amazed at
just how wrongly you have been pronouncing it. Generally, you should raise
your vocabulary to acceptable levels. Look up ""vocabulary"". Using the same
27 words interspersed with filler noises such as ""like"" and ""you know"" is an
unacceptable and ineffective form of communication.  Look up ""interspersed"".

* There is no such thing as ""US English"". We will let Microsoft know on your
behalf.

* You should learn to distinguish between English and Australian accents. It
really isn't that hard.

* Hollywood will be required to occasionally cast English actors as the good
guys.

* You should relearn your original national anthem, God Save The Queen, but
only after carrying out task one. We would not want you to get confused and
give up half way through.

* You will no longer be allowed to play American football. There is only one
kind of football. What you refer to as ""football"" is not a very good game.
The 2.15% of you who are aware that there is a world outside your borders
may have noticed that no one else plays American football. Instead you
should play proper football. Initially, it would be best if you played with
the girls. It is a difficult game. Those of you brave enough will, in time,
be allowed to play rugby (which is similar to American football, but does
not involve stopping for a rest every 20 seconds or wearing full body armour
like nancies).

* You should declare war on Quebec and France, using nuclear weapons if they
give you any merde. The 97.85% of you who were not aware that there is a

"event","This year's exam selection was really fascinating for me. I had an interesting time trying to learn for Operating Systems - I had to cram a whole lotta info into my brain to answer even half the questions, which is what you get when a subject with a theoretical basis is trivialised for those not in the know - and I also had the biggest mental high ever. This was the Topology and Analysis exam. This is sometimes regarded as the hardest pure maths subject at 3rd year uni. This is also a subject in which I understood sections immediately upon reading them from the board.

I had the best experience in a lecture when upon reading the statement of the theorem, and the first few statements of the proof, I realised that the theorem was incomplete (needed to add a statement about a property of a function). I then pointed this out to the lecturer, even tho the missing property wasn't to be used for another few statements. That was a good feeling.

A great feeling was the morning of the exam. During the exam period I hadn't been sleeping well, but that morning after getting my wakeup bottle of <a href=""http://www.red-eye.com.au/temppage/index.html"">red eye</a> I started my last minute recap of my Topology bits and pieces, and started a previous year's exam to get into the correct mindset.

I romped through the practice exam and suddenly realised that I knew everything in the subject. This is the most awesome feeling, which I experienced again on seeing the actual question paper. I feel really good about this exam, but knowing Murphy's Law, will wait to see the results :P

The next day was a second pure maths year subject which I could not get my head around for the life of me!
For those who think maths is maths, there are many different branches. Look up the maths section in your local big uni library and you'll see what I mean. This kind of maths I just did not get my head around...

So I hope I've done enough to pass this subject, but I'm confident I've passed the others :)

"event","Hooray for lecturers asking questions to which I know the answers. After studying for a long time (as the amount of material in the course was immense) I knew enough to bullshit; which was nice. Some of the material is kinda cool, with names like ""The Sleepy Barber Problem"" or ""The Dining Philosophers Problem"". Some of the material was dead boring.

The best bit was that the questions were different to the previous exams that they gave us. I like that because the people that memorised the answers from those exams and didn't bother to learn the subject matter wouldn't have had as good a time :) And I didn't know how to answer some of those questions... :P

It's a teeny bit hipocritical to say that, because I know in the past that all that has passed me was the previous exams...

"event","So much I remember I associate with music. Feelings and thoughts just seem to tie in so strongly to music - of all kinds. I remember when Doom first came out in '94 (i think?), and my brother was playing it and listening to some early pop/house music. And every time I hear the music, I remember the level in the game he was playing, the way his room was setup, and even a lot of the rest of the house. For ten years ago, that is a strong association. Every time I hear Crowded House I have an urge to study, as most recently I used to study at the kitchen table watching their 'Farewell to the World' video. Most of the associations were made a lot earlier in life. I think the Crowded House one is the most recent to have formed.

All of the more communicative music, such as Jeff Buckley, Ryan Adams (not Bryan, Ryan!!), Sarah Blasko, Missy Higgins and others of the like, can manipulate my emotions so easily, and also act as an outlet. Its great to know that someone somewhere feels the same :) and so the bad emotions go, and the good return.

Anyway, this isn't getting work done.

"event","Its that time of the year again, and us uni students have exams to worry about. Talk about laugh, all we have to do for one maths subject is remember the definitions, the named theorems and know how to use them.

Good news: 6 named theorems.

Bad news: 56 definitions.

In other not exam related news, one of the choirs I sing with recently had a concert. One of the pieces was an arrangement of Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon for 4 voice parts and band. Awesome stuff, especially Us and Them. We also did bits of Jesus Christ Superstar, which rocked. Pilate's Vision, wherein he sees Jesus, then all the people of the Christian Faith blaming him for Jesus's death gave me goose bumps. That was the fault of the singer and the ideas/words. Brilliant stuff.

Of course, no uni choir concert is complete without a post concert party/piss-up. Time to go to a house and visit the inside of a beer bottle. Great fun.

Here's to our friend Mark, who is downright the funniest person I know.

"event","Just spent a whole 300 lines explaining defragmentation concepts to a friend. Maybe I've missed my calling in life. I could start up a new book series: ""Ed's Guide to What's Going On"", and more advanced topics in ""Ed's Guide to What's Really Going On"".

But on a more serious note, there's a huge problem with communicating with technical people. They've spent so much time thinking in terms of technical concepts that some assume others understand what the hell they're talking about. I'm guilty, coz I know I've assumed others understood what I was talking about when I was excited, no raving, about polynomial functions being dense in the continuous functions (over closed intervals) - called the Weierstrass Approximation Theorem, which means a huge amount for mathematicians :)

We need more middle people, to get shafted from both sides!!!

Its actually really cool, coz I'm enjoying my maths way more than I thought I would. After hearing from a friend who's now PhDing over in the states about how hard this one particular subject is, I'm finding it a whole lot easier than he intimated. Maybe the course has changed a teeny bit since when he did it :)

And its the home straight as well. Last week of lectures, with swotvac and exams after.
Some sicko rigged the exam timetable (again!) and I have one exam, break for a few days (yay!) and then three exams in three days. AGGG.
Especially coz they are the hard ones....

Off in a blue funk about that....

"event","Weirdness. Break up with girlfriend = return of insomnia.
It's a bit strange, coz maybe the only thing that fuels the insomnia is my self-image. When everything is okay, and life is going smoothly, I tend not to have sleeping problems. Chuck me thru a blender of a week and its lights on till the body keels over.  Mainly its coz the brain doesn't shut down and starts on strange topics.

Like a few nights ago, when, for the most unimaginable reason, I did a ""thought experiment"" as to what it would have been like to be in the World Trade Centre when the shit went down. That was disturbing. But enlightening (not the following about falling, but about facing death).

I had a chat with a friend about it, and we got onto whether we'd choose to end our lives quickly inside the building, or take the slim chance of jumping out the window and surviving (according to my friend, some people chose to jump, and a tiny fraction of those people did survive). His argument was more that any life you have after surviving that fall would be full of agony (massive injuries from hitting cement at a way too fast speed) and hence would not be worth living. I'm more attached to my life than my friend, so I'd probably choose to jump, rather than find a quick way.

People have survived things like that, I'm told. There have been cases of pilots who jumped out of their aircraft at 30000 feet and survived the fall *astonished expression on face*. So there is that slim chance of survival. I think I'd take it, but the real question is: How would you land??

Feet first is a no-no. I know for a fact that leg bones are just that, and have no place being next to your stomach. Face down and face up are also out I think. The problem is having the longest period of time when you are decellerating - which as a maths/physics person I have a great deal of trouble saying - without resulting in the most injuries (eg leg bones introduced to intestinal cavity). I'm guessing its something like a 45 degree angle to the ground, feet first, facing down, protecting the head with arms. Either way, its still a snowball's chance in hell of surviving.

But it is a chance....

Next time not so morbid... :)

Tomorrow it is. Voting for the MoM. I never could have imagined things turning out like this. Molly has been so wonderful, so very patient with my long hours. There's so much to do, and frankly, any sort of campaign has been the last thing on my mind.

I'm hearing disturbing reports from Hogwarts. We had to quarantine the children over hols and I'm not sure when that shall end. What is going on here? What has You-Know-Who done now? We need answers, and we need them quickly.

If I win... if it becomes official... maybe we'll finally be able to begin pushing back.

Ah, but a pile of work is staring at me now. Percy has just brought them in. I still owe Virginia birthday wishes from yesterday.</lj-cut>"

Normally Sundays are rather quiet around here without the children, but today Molly was exclaiming things loudly as she hovered near the toplap thingy majig. Every now and then she jumped up and either frantically scatched out an owl - or a howler, if I heard right - and sent it off or she was waiting by the window for an owl. When she finally explained to me what was going on I was most amused. I did have to remind her that it would take several hours for Charlie's owl to make it from Romania so she was kind enough to pause and fix a delicious supper.

The quiet around the Burrow has been very nice compared to the mayhem going on at the office. Things are always hectic these days but... this past week... Well, it seems Mrs. Malfoy has returned to the country. Indeed, several times I saw Narcissa around the Ministry, usually near Fudge's office.

I'd like to think that all they are discussing is the fate of Lucius but... I don't trust Fudge. Merlin knows what Narcissa has up her sleeve. I need to find out more and let the Order know. Maybe Snape has heard something... I think he saw her over the hols.</lj-cut>"

Sometimes I wonder if there was ever a time when work at The Ministry was not so hectic. I suppose it always has been, it's just not always been this... urgent. There is a horrible sense of desperation hanging in the air - no one knows what is really going on or what to do. And, worse than that, no one knows who to trust.

I still have not managed to talk with Percy much, but I think his observations about Minister Fudge are probably crucial to figuring some things out. If Fudge has been meeting with suspcious people... If he's blackmailing Percy by means of <i>my</i> job... something must be up.

Those of us in the Order really need to see if we can get more inside information on what the Minister - not just the Ministry - is doing. 

Somehow, in between all this darkness looming, there is always time for family. Last Saturday Molly and I were able to go see Ron and Ginny's Quidditch game. They did wonderfully and Gryffindor won. It was good to see Harry and Hermione too - they seem to be holding up well enough.

I also managed to meet one Zacharias Smith briefly a few days before the match on the journals. He seemed like a very polite young man. We met him after the game and he seems a perfect gentleman. Hufflepuffs are hardworkers and extrememly loyal. I can't really think of my little Virginia growing up... but she has, and she's fond of him and so I'll be loving and supportive as a father should be.

Checking in with the journal project earlier this week my heart was warmed to see some pictures that Molly had posted of the children. It's nice to look back on times that were more pleasant. Bill and Charlie have been through this before... but for some reason this time it seems worse. We have seen the resources of You Know Who and... we know it is not easy to defeat him.

Bill and Charlie... in the Order... in danger. Percy, well... and the twins - so busy with their new shoppe but also wanting to help out. Ron and Ginny, still at school... 

Well, <i>usually</i> at school. It was most... odd to come home Saturday and discover them right there at home!! I could not believe my eyes. Indeed, it was good to see them... but leaving the school without permission or telling any of the professors?? Even in the safest of times this would be a poor choice. In these times... I don't like the idea of them wandering off on their own... even if it is just to floo home. We never know what could happen and it is important for the Hogwarts staff to have the students accounted for at all times. 

<font size=1>But it was wonderful to have them there...</font></lj-cut>"

"event","I'm rather tired as things have been busy around here recently. I've been working with some cases of Muggle artifacts gone wonky, and this new journal project as well. I predict it's only a matter of time before the two intertwine and I'm faced with a charmed laptop. That will not be good at all.

I did have a nice surprise earlier. Charlie flooed in from Romania. I was able to speak with him for a little bit before he headed on down to the bank to meet up with Bill. I hope... I hope everything goes well."

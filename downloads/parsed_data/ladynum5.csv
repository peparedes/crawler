"event","So, it's been almost a year...And I had totally forgotten about this thing.  i think it's pretty cool that I still have the account.  i think that it's a good idea to keep a journal, no matter how or where it is.  
Anyways, back to the entry.  i just got in touch with my old teacher from high school.  I was very excited about that.  
I am moved in to my new apartment and am excited about that.  The only thing that bothers me is that my roommate isn't here.  We moved in and she went back to her parents house to go to her JC.  So annoying. and I am trying to live in this great big apartment all by myself.  It's kind of spooky.  I haven't been able to sleep for the last couple of night.  Gone over to my  bf's to sleep.  Anyways, it's too late to write.  at least I put something huh?"

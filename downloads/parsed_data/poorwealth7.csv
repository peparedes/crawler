Jennifer.. don't get me wronge, she's the coolest person alive but were bored... and theres nothing to do. The guy i love (curtis) is probly in daytona screwing some girl right now, while the guy Jennifer likes is camping... so this really sucks. What are we supposed to do. Anyways, me and my mom are not getting along at all. She hates me but i don't really care cause i don't like her that much anyways. it's sad i know, but it's true. Last night i got my official Huddle House visor that i have to wear when i work, thats when huddle house opens. it should be around June 11th. I can't wait to start so i can get some money and get a car. one of these days i'm gonna have a car. i hope. Tim is being a jerk and i don't know why. i think he hates me now, and that really sucks considering i care about him alot and he's almost like my big brother. well i guess he was like my big brother. i'm not sure what his deal is though. sometimes he nice and others it's like he's too cool or something, which i don't blame him for being cooler then me, i mean you don't have to try very hard to be cooler then Amy. I'm not that cool, that's why curtis dosn't like me. We have alot in common, i mean we both wanted to have a twin when we were little so we could screw with people. what more could u ask for in a guy, right?! well i could think of a few things, but were not gonna go there. i guess i'm done talking about curtis now. This totaly sucks. I have to go to church in the morning, not by choice though, everone there are a bunch of liers anyways. No one really walks the walk or talks the talk. I'm not much into church, i smoke somethimes and i like it and i don't really care who knows as long as it's not my granparents. they would hate me for it. but i don't tell everyone they shouldn't smoke then go smoke a bowl or anything... i think people should be able to do what they want to. and thats that. but i guess i'm gonna go now, sorry for being so boring."

Now... my third and final best friend... Marti... oh man... she's riot. but she's in virgnia right now, looking at a college, which is really scary because she's gonna be gone not next year but the year after that, i mean i know we'll still talk and everything, but it's not gonna be the same. and i love her. she's like my big sister that watches out for me and cares a whole lot about me... even when i make her mad. but anyways... thats a little bit about my friends... now for the guy i'm in love with... lol... Curtis, oh wow, he's not my type or anything, but he's really cute and for some stange reason i think i like him... a whole lot... i think it's his teeth though. there so........ white... and he's just so.... i don't know... there's just something mysterious about him that makes me want to get to know him... but i don't think thats gonna happen. with teeth like that he can do better then me... and i don't blame him. he's really nice though, not to mention nice looking...he's friends with Tim... but i'm scared to tell Tim that i like him cause he'll be all gay about it and make curtis think i'm totaly in love with him, which i'm NOT. i just like his teeth... well i think i'm starting to ramble, so i'm gonna go find something construtive to do with my time..."

"event","Well Hey guys... since this is my first entry i guess i should tell you a little backround information. Amy is my name, and i'm 16 years old. my life sucks. I can't talk to one of my best friends another one of my friends just told me i was babyish (whatever the heck that means) I'm talking to another one of my fav. friends on the phone right now who has a boy friend, which also means she's not gonna have a depressing v-day. However my v-day is gonna suck as always. I want a valintine, i really do, thats all i want out of life... well that and to go sky diving. which i plan on doin A.S.A.P. anyways... I haven't talked to Marti in a few days.. i tried calling her yesterday but i dont think she wanted to talk to me. I don't blame her though. i probly wouln't want to talk to me either. i'm pretty lame. Tim is a emotional roller coaster... as always... him and stephanie are gonna hook up soon which also means... Happy Valentines for the two of them. oh man, all the past years have really sucked but i think this one's gonna be really bad. I might just go to Murray Hill and watch 6/7 decision. i think the root of all my problems is Valietines day. i think whoever thought of it should be hung or killed... cause it is absolutly the worst idea ever in history, worse then eve when she took the apple from that darn snake. Just bad... bad bad bad. I hate it. So i was walking down the hall way and i saw him... HIM, the love of my life, the prettest smile in school. he's tall and cute.. and i'm defintly in like with this guy, too bad he barly know's i exist, it's the substitute for Jennifers spanish class.... j/k... i think i'll just leave this one nameless... he only know's my name cause i'm best friends with one of his friends. Other then that i'm sure he wouldn't care what my name was... but i think i'll leave you with that... later"

"event","So, week #...whatever. so here's an update:

Classes-

<underline> Astronomy </underline>
just took a quiz in there that I didnt know about. Im callin a C on it. I thought itd be a hard class but it just takes a lot of your time to do it. Like, looking at the moon and shit. Its alright though, and Im getting a decent grade and meeting new people. I sit at a table with all guys. All stoners I mean. Theyre just like that denis leary sketch, they talk about the thousands of things they can turn into a bong. I just sit and laugh and they dont think Im innocent at all. We bond over tattoos, piercings and trying to find your way around Champaign while high. Again, I just sit and laugh. Theyre nice people and we usually split off into partners and my partner is really nice and wears some cool but predictable band shirts. Nice nonetheless. I have to go star observing and shit soon. Its like 20 percent of my grade. Ill wait til it warms up.

<underline> Photo </underline>
Fuck, this is what I want to do for a living. For the rest of my life I want to be a fucking photographer. And im losing faith. I know Im not good enough yet, I just need more time to practice. I need money to buy film and paper and supplies and guh. The only thing setting me back from being a photographer is money and time. hmm. Pink Floyd. I am underappreciated in photo class. I feel my work is decent and people have nothing to say about my pictures literally. I need to do something to wow them. I need to do something to wow myself. The advice Ive gotten about my problem from my mother is ""well maybe you just shouldnt be a photographer, your father was great at it, maybe you shoudldnt try to be like him"" and my fathers is ""look at the pictures ive done, a good picture looks like that, I could have made thousands of dollars being a photographer."" whatever. I just want to be one. money and time being no issue on whether I am good enough for you. despite getting no feed back from the people in my class, Ive made a pretty good friendship with some of them. Ive already known sophie and phil, but i met a hair stylist Taylor who dresses nicely and always has something funny to say. Hes nice to me sometimes which makes me happy. And then some Emo Kid Ben who probably wishes I didnt talk to him, so Ive stopped. Even though I like his music too.

<underline> english </underline>
my teacher is a stoner. I could end it there. All I do in that class is argue with him. and he never argues back, just agrees with everyone. theres this kid in the class that is straight up stupid and doesnt know how to shut his mouth and everyone hates him. he says meaningless things. Theres also a kid in my class that I sit by that I seem to get along with. Not my cup of tea though.

<underline> Math </underline>
waste of time. I cant believe I was placed in that class. fuck that.

Work-

I swear I tell myself Im quitting every day. but I some how get talked out of it. bribed with food and money I spose. and fear that I wont have any money. I closed the store by myself two nights ago. Big step for me. even though kristie molly and I made the store look better than it ever has been with us working, they didnt say anything. not even a ""thanks for taking my shift"" or ""hey, i can see the floor, its nice in here"" fuck that. I feel very underappreciated there too. I need to find a new job.

Friends-

lost all the old friends from high school. I see amandine and mat regularly. but thats it. No one fucking calls. I could be dead for all they know. Guess now that this post is out theyll be comforted to know Im not. fuck that.

Relationships-
none new. I mean, I have small likes and crushes. but nothing will come of them due to them ya know, not liking me back. or never being able to hang out due to distance and jobs and time and yeah, money. But Im kind of liking where Im at now anyway. I like the familiar strong arms that hold me. and Im more in love today than yesterday or even 20 minutes ago.

Money-

what money? I have none. I barely make enough to eat on a daily basis. I need money to buy film and paper. Ill starve if I could make a killer print. Im living off expired milk and stale cereal. I occasionally rake up enough money to get some Jimmy Johns once in awhile. Or to buy some nice things for people. I take my cans to cash them in for coins, and then cash in my coins for money to fill up my car to drive to school and work. 

Health-

<underline> mental </underline>
deteriorating. quickly. 

<underline> physical </underline>
getting better. Im working out and due to lack of funds, eating less and healthier. fuck, I drink milk now. cant kick the soda though. but Im working on it. Im afraid of picking up habits that will hurt the above category.

Prom-

am I going? no group has asked me or intend on asking me. despite the big plans I think I have, none of it will happen if I go alone.

thats it."

My ocd has me worried, though everyone says im exagerating. But today before I noticed it, it took 5 minutes for me to lock the door. I count. non stop. what used to be ideas and thoughts and music is now one two three four five. one two three four five. its not all the time. but im afraid that with mom gone itll get worse.

started college. and despite my constant if not continuous paniced rushed dizzy feeling it hasnt been too bad. I see no one that I know except Cody on Monday Wednesdays and fridays. on top of doing college work I still have to deal with high school shit that didnt get finished because the school administrators suck. ass. you think after years and years of doing this theyd get it right. now i have to come in between my classes tomorrow to have everyone and their mom sign this paper. even my mom. not to mention I have to come in for a pe final and a fucking english letter. speaking of. i need to write that paper thats 20 % of my fucking grade. fuck that ya know? 

Everyone's leaving. my mom leaves in a week and a half. neal went back to school. ryan left. my father's been gone. I have an extra room. for free. if you need it. and id be willing to give it to anyone. I think I can talk Ryan Corson into staying with me. after he turns 18. i mean..its free. if not ill just...let it be empty for neal or something. 

Im trying hard to not be so passive and to be more out going. 

This college thing is getting tiring already. Maybe when stress goes away. I AM looking forward to photo class though. Its relaxed enough that I can finally have a lot of freedom in there. My english teacher is nice. A tired rock listening to pot smoking english teacher. My favorite. I wish I had something to show everyone who I am. Like when people see me its like ""Fuck. look at her"" and know me in a second and then maybe id have more friends and people wouldnt keep leaving. 

You wanna know a fucking secret. Im missing you. And it hurts.

3 days and 15 weeks to go. may 4th is my last day not including finals. fuck i cant wait til spring. I heard the song Jet Airliner today. and it reminded me of the first spring where I felt free. And where I felt happy. And it hurt because im in the middle of fucking winter where there isnt a sun to speak of and I have to wear coats and shoes and I dont even have a fucking back yard so what does it matter. Theres no grass to sink my toes into. No sun room to warm in. Fuck I want to go home."

I bought you hundreds of dollars for christmas to make up for it. I come hundreds of miles away from my comfort zone to see you. I do things you want to do and dont complain. I wake up early. I sit through your arguments and I dont cry. so, when say I dont want to come down, dont be surprised.

She dont think you love her the same

With her tight pants and curls
I comfort her crying eyes

She screams to be bold
to be blunt to be a knife

her voice vibrates off her winter lips

deep pockets with deep meaning
Your hands pushing against her waist

I fucking hate how im easily guilted. And you know what happens because of it? I work on my fucking day off. My one weekend day off and I give it away because I feel sorry. fucking bitches. I worked like I was on crack today. I pulled more weight than anyone and all I get is shit and extra hours because my friends like to get blinding drunk. 

I have 2/3 of my christmas shopping done. Im certain what Ive gotten for people no one will like. or care about. 

fucking. a. 

if you really wanted to mess me up you should have gotten to me earlier. 

Id like to think that since I was 14 times have changed.

I want to cut off all connections to my family. My older brother did it. And he sees them every christmas, the occasional valentines day, and thats it. and you know what? hes happy. he has no guilt in his life. He has no family obligations other than the mothers day phone call and the thank you for the nice but tastles thats the worse fucking sweater Ive ever seen its a cosby sweater a cosby sweater that my mother bought him. I want to truely live in this shit hole and cry. And not feel like I should keep it down when I punch our unstable metal door. Or when I scream because Im tired and sick of it all. Or feel bad for not buying milk or coming home with food that someone else should have bought. 

How many reincarnations have there been of the band name Belle and Sebastian?

Every life has a theme. and every fucking moment you live should be just like the one a year ago and the one before that and your life before this one and the one after and it will feel the same because it is a scrambled version of it. 

Im. fucking content with doing nothing with my life. Nothing. Dont fucking say yeah right because I will work a fucking meaningless job for the rest of my life because I want to and dont care. nothing will change in anyones life or mine if I go to college or be an english teacher or an art teacher or a fucking writer or a fucking photographer. Nothing will change be different better worse. It wont. Matter. 

she liked me she liked me she liked me or atleast I think she did.

I worry about my abilities as a lover.

I bat my eyes and pout my lips yet get no where with any ambition I have. 

IM the one tripping over the curb in the rain. 

I dont want to move again. I dont want to look at another box or packing tape or fuck. Ive lost so much shit with the move. I cant find anything Im missing. I realized I had too many clothes after I had to go out and buy more hangers. I have so many shirts that I dont give a shit about but I cant find a necklace my grandparents gave me when I was three. and it bothers me. I dont need that necklace. but Id like to be happy knowing it was in a place I could find it if I did need it. Thats my life in a nut shell. 

it was contrary to the whole spirit of our relationship.

Im the underappreciated. 

so fuck you for saying I should go out of my way to care. fuck. you. 

That sounds..

"event","So I must ask,

Is it better for one to love many people evenly but minimal, or love a select few or one, more and with all your heart?

My father is upset that I dont take off work everytime he comes to town, yet he couldnt come home for my birthday because he didnt want to take off work. Are either of us in the right?

Im not looking forward to thanksgiving. I mean, we're eating unhomemade food for the first time. gravy out of a can and biscuits from a can and cranberry sauce from a can...well we always eat cranberry sauce out of a can cuz its good. But Im not looking forward to sitting at a table that sits 2 and up against the wall. I really just want my family to move out and leave me alone. AndI know Ill miss them when theyre gone but not as much as I am happy that theyre 9 hours away. I like my space. I dont like my mother waking me up before my alarm even though Ive woken up to my alarm every single time I set it. I dont like that I cant take a shower without my mom bothering me or watching a movie without her knocking on my door to tell me some dumbass thing that I dont even need to know about. Im selfrelient. Yes. Jim Morrison would have fallen in love with me at that moment. I believe.

So we were pawned off into the computer lab because some teachers dont know how to show up for school. Im very bored. very. dispondant. Im back to feeling like sleeping. Im very sure that in another life I was a bear. a cute bear. Because I always feel like hybernating about now. 

I also commonly feel like hiding anytime anything i dont like comes up. I dont want to see things I dont want to see, I dont want to feel things I dont want to feel, or remember things, or be things or do things. I get this sinking feeling, this constricting pain in my chest anytime I think about most anything.

Did you know that anything can spark a memory for me? Do you know how hard that is to live with. I cant smell pizza without thinking about something that happened when I was a kid. It sucks. I was day dreaming in english and lehr said the word ""Whom"" and I thought of riding the bus in seattle and how I thought of when to use the word Whom.

I really like hanging out with dillon and ryan. Its so much fun."

I know youve got sometime between jobs 
To make confessions
if youre in your booth Ill meet you there
and through the wicker grate
Ill tell you of my night
the roads I took and the things I felt
and youll act anonymous
and shake your hidden head

Or make up for lost time
So use the words I used once before
to comfort you through the ones Im saying now
and just hope this is all worth remembering someday."

Or said I love you because maybe I really shouldnt have, but it made them smile a bit...

My father is coming down on thursday. He once said the only reason he cant come down is because he doesnt like seeing how we're living. off tv dinners. off a wobbely table. on torn couches. in an uncomfortable space. with half of what we used to have. 

he actually said ""because of work"" but I know the truth.

I'm actually enjoying what few classes I have this year. mainly art and photo. and study hall. gives me time to catch up on english which is THE only class that involves effort. Without having an 8th hour, and having a mid day study hall break, the day goes by insanly fast...

"event","<p align=justify>i really don't feel like making a new update. so i'm just rewriting what i had in here, my moms gone 3 more days. she'll be back monday after six. shes having fun i talked to her, shes happy. i just hope she comes back, i do miss her, but i'm living. i feel like i'm living on my own, & i have kids, since i've been babysitting. its really rough. lol but i'm handling it, i'm really depressed. i can feel it. but i'm trying so hard to fight it off trying to keep myself busy, & motivated, so it doesn't drown me in it. i'm trying to work through it, i really am. i just don't feel... happy, anymore.<br><br><b><p align=right>&hearts; kitty"

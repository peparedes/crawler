"event","Yep. Well, its about the end of another semester in my collegiate career. This is gonna be a ""Garrett has had a bad day and will now rant about it"" posts, so dont expect warm fuzzies and butterflies. And, if you ever expect warm fuzzies and butterflies to come from my posts, then you are definitely on some kind of drug.
   Yeah, different paragraphs. It's a new thing. I don't know if i can handle it. Well, my day started off rather well. You know, some comedy central, a little studying for an exam that is worth 33% of my grade. No big deal. My exam went really well. I'm proud to say that i smoked that exam. I finished it in 15 minutes flat. If you looked at my exam, you would think that Bill Shakespeare and I had grown up together. Yeah, thats a literature joke. I'm a dork. NEXT PARAGRAPH
   This paragraph thing is blowin my mind. Well, i got home from my exam and told my ""great"" roommates taht i wanted to go see Mission Impossible 3 today, and that if they were going they should tell me what time so that i might go as well.  Well, my roommates definitely decided to leave me behind and not invite me to go to the movies with them. Aren't they just great guys? How i love them so. Needless to say, I was quite irate when i found out that they had done this intentionally. Ok, i was a little more than irate. I quite nearly went postal. So, things are quite tense at the moment in the house. Good thing im moving out very, very soon. I can't wait to move in with guys that want to live with me. 
   So, i left the house with quite the temper flare, and went to grab some food and then vented to my incredibly awesome mom.  This woman has superhuman patience. She just listens to me rant on and on about how bad my roommate Matt is and what a psycho he is. I'm serious, he's a psycho. Not like a ""i'm  physically going to harm you"" psycho, but more like a ""i'm going to try to ruin your life"" psycho. You want to hear me get on a huge rant sometime? Bring him up. I'll go on for about 45 minutes. Seriously. 
  Well, i get back to my house and call my impact partner, Meredith. Now, this girl has to be one of the coolest girls i've ever met in my life.  So, i told her about my day and then we decided to hang out and grab coffee(even though i dont like coffee). This girl was meant to be my partner. I don't think i tell her what a blessing she has been to me enough. I definitely don't know anybody that has as big of an encouraging heart as she does. So we chatted and talked about various topics. Then, i dropped her back at her dorm since she needed to get her study on.
  Then, I came to the conclusion that my horrible day could only be rectified in one way: Going to see a funny movie. So, I went. ALONE. Now, this is the first time in my life that i went to the movies without other people being with me. If you havent gone to a movie alone before, do it. It's very liberating. It inspires you to do great things like type random posts to a webjournal very early in the morning.  I'm not gonna lie, it was a bit awkward having no one to talk to before the movie. And, i definitely think i interrupted this one couple's makeout session. That made things a bit tense. I tried to think of a way to ease the tension, but the only thing i could think of was to put my feet on the chair back. Which was quickly interrupted by this big guy sitting directly in front of me. The movie was awesome. I saw The Benchwarmers. You should give it a try. I think you'd like it. Then again, I like stupid comedies. I wasn't in the mood to do much thinking. It actually taught a good lesson about picking on kids. I was surprised. Tomorrow, I'm picking up Meredith for breakfast and then we are gonna work on our BASIC group folders. It's gonna be a rocking good time. And for those of you that think im being sarcastic in that last sentence, let me clear it up for you. I'm NOT being sarcastic. I really think its gonna be fun. 
  Well, thats about it for this edition of ""Personality in Spades"". I'll catch y'all on the flip side. Later days.

"event","Hey guys. Update time. I forget when i wrote in this thing last. Could have been last week, or it could have been 2 months ago.  Life has been decent as of late.  This week has been odd. It's the week after spring break and i feel tired all the time. And i feel extremely lazy. I havent gotten to run in a couple weeks and im definitely feeling less healthy.  I just cant seem to get motivated to run. I am definitely feeling it in my walk as well. Running is normally when i can concentrate on talking to God. I feel really distanced from him the past couple of weeks. For various reasons, not just the lack of running.  Oh yeah, another reason i havent been running. I have been having lots of ankle problems recently. Sometimes I can run on it, and other times i can barely walk on it. It's odd. I don't know what to make of it. But I know that i need the exercise and the time with God.  After school lets out for the semester, I'm going to go back to the doctor's and get another mri so they can look at it again.  I might need surgery.  I hope i dont need surgery, but ill get it if itll heal this. And the surgery might involve me having to spend the summer at home, which would be a serious damper on my plans to take classes and stay at A&M for the summer.  But the only thing I can do is pray about it and hope for the best. AND NOW FOR SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT. My impact camp rocks!! And for those of you that dont know what camp i am, I'm definitely an OMEGA ZEBULUN!! I love my camp so much.  I dont know why, but i think i fit in better with my camp this year.  Last year, I kinda felt a little alienated from everyone else because I wasn't as outgoing as the rest of them were.  This year I feel like i fit in with everyone else and that I'm stepping up and being a leader of sorts. And im not ashamed to get in there and be goofy and wierd with everyone. It's a confidence thing. I definitely feel more confident now than I did last year. Booyah. Spring break was awesome. I went hiking with my little brother and my dad.  We went to Big Bend and hiked for 2 nights and 3 days in the back country. So beautiful. I love getting away from college, city life, everything that comes with school and just observing God's glory. So amazing. It's where i feel the most at peace. Well, thats about it for this edition of Personality in Spades. I'll catch y'all on the flip side. Later days y'all. I love ya.

"event","Yep. Cool title huh. I'll give you one guess as to who said that........ If you guessed John Locke you'd be absolutely correct.  Locke is quickly becoming one of my favorite philosophers.  His writings were so influential to our nation. Ive had several professors that have tried to discuss Locke without discussing religion. I don't think you can do that. Locke was such a Christian man. His principles take root in the Bible's teachings. You can't get much more sound than that.  On another front, I've had a decent week as of yet.  My roommates and I are becoming better friends every day. Thank God for that.  He definitely blessed me with solid, amazing Christian roommates. I have definitely enjoyed being their roommate for the semester and some change that I have been.  And ill be sorry to see them go if they decide to not renew their lease. I know that i will renew my lease. Rather, I will if i can get some guys to take my roommates places if they move out.  Sounds incredibly complicated doesnt it. That's because it is.  Im going to try to get it all ironed out by the end of February. That way it isn't looming over my head. I finished more of my INFO assignments at the lab tonight. It was definitely tedious and frustrating.  I dislike it when a program makes me do things a certain way.  If i can get the right answer a different way, why not let me use it? But, for now I'm going to go see if my roommates want to go to the grocery with me. I'm all out of tuna and triscuit. Those are what keeps me going. Energy wise, at least.  I will leave you with a quote by Thucydides.  ""For we both alike know that into the discussion of human affairs the question of justice enters only where the pressure of necessity is equal, and that the powerful exact what they can, and the weak grant what they must."" That shall be the topic of my next entry, if i can remember what i said. That's about it for this edition of ""Personality in Spades"". I'll catch y'all on the flip side. Later Days."

"event","Hey. This post is gonna be some heavy topic matter. Tomorrow i have been asked to meet with the coordinators of Upstream to talk to them about some issues involving me flirting with a freshmen.  Those issues are true. I can't deny that, and I won't deny that. This issue is also entirely my fault.  All of the blame will come to rest upon my shoulders and that is the way that it should be.  I may be asked to step down from my role as a prayer teamer.  If this should be the case, i will not drag my feet and whine and complain about it. I will do the manly thing and accept the consequences of my actions.  If they believe that me being the prayer teamer for that group will be a detriment to the girl involved or the group as a whole, i will gladly step down.  I have nothing but love for this ministry and I only want the best for it.  Even if the best involves me not being involved anymore. I also want the best for my group and for the individuals in it.  If I'm going to make things awkward or influence the group's learning in a negative way then I should step down.  That's the noble thing to do.  As a good friend told me, this is a humbling experience.  Through this i hope that i learn something great and something amazing.  I know that God's will is working through this hardship and that this is all for the best. But, that is sometimes hard to accept.  But, I will accept it.  Have you ever had one of those moments that you wish you could just go back in time and jerk out of existence?  I certainly have. The instant those flirtatious words left my mouth, I wanted to take them back.  I knew they wouldn't do anyone any good. But yet i stepped over the line and said them anyway.  Have you ever felt so bad about one of your decisions that you felt physically sick to your stomach about it? I have had that almost for a week now.  I think that every bad decision should give these horrible feelings.  I know for me that many of my bad decisions don't.  I tend to just gloss them over and move on.  But, this one has shown me the true meaning of regret.  Regret isn't just simply wishing something hadnt happened. Regret is a much deeper thing. I don't even know if i can explain it.  Just know that i have learned something through all this. And, ill be glad to not have it looming over my head anymore.  Whatever the outcome, I accept it.  I'm sorry if this post seems pretty depressing. Actually, im not sorry. This journal is meant for me to get my thoughts out and to vent some frustration and be honest with myself.  If no one wants to read it, then thats fine.  I'm perfectly content to just write out my thoughts so that i can see where i have been and where im going.  God is so good.  He can handle anything.  Even when i feel like its unfixable, he is capable of fixing it. Thats it for this edition of ""Personality in Spades"". I'll catch y'all on the flip side. Later days. I love y'all."

"event","Yep. Looks like we've got ourselves a bilingual journal entry. Well, the semester has officially started. Ok, i know. It started last week. But, i'm a little slow sometimes. Especially on journal stuff.  Yep. All my classes are gonna be awesome with the exception of Texas Legislature. That class is boring and the professor hates me already. Long story. Oh, i also applied to be an Impact Counselor.  I finally got over my hard feelings about not being chosen as a co chair and realized that I would be a much better counselor than i would be a co chair. I realized something else as well during the process of writing my responses to the prompts. I realized how much i look up to and admire the founding fathers of our country.  Those men had so much faith.  They had faith that God would help them found a nation and God honored that and helped them found the United States. How faithful is that. Those men risked everything to found this nation, and did it all on faith.  If we had more Christian men in our society today that had that much faith, we wouldnt just be changing lives. We would be changing the world around us.  I, for one, am tired of guys my age not stepping up into places of leadership.  We need to stop being cowards and step up and take a stand for what we know is right.  Ok, im a little bit passionate about that topic. And by little, i mean alot.  The rest of my week has been good. I already feel swamped with work to be done, and i need to find a job for the semester, and i need to sleep sometime, and i need to exercise sometime as well.  But, i guess ill step off my soapbox now. Thats about it for this edition of ""Personality in Spades"". I'll catch y'all on the flip side. Later Days."

"event","Yep. Another update from the people that brought you...well, actually its just me. there arent other people. except in my head. his name is Rusty Shackelford. ok, that isn't exactly true. There aren't really people inside my head. I'm just your average dude.  It's been a good day. I did absolutely nothing all day long.  And its nice to realize that i had nothing better to do. Actually, i watched the new Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. It's one of my favorites.  Then i picked up my new contacts. Heaven help anyone that comes across me when i have no glasses or contacts in. I can't see 2 feet in front of my face without them. I wonder what the government regulations are for being legally blind. Because, i think i probably am close to legally blind if not way over. Then i hung out with Tristan tonight and played some pool upstairs. I'm proud to say that i sharked him all 4 games.  He had a very off night tonight at pool.  Then we went to Mcdonald's and i got a HUGE diet coke. We both realized that this could be one of the last Christmas breaks with the gang all being here. By the gang, i mean Tristan, Mike, Travis, Wes, and I. Thats a sad thought. It seems like yesterday that we were all in like 6th grade. Well, taht excludes Mike and Travis as they didnt enter our group til high school. Tristan and I both decided that all of us are gonna have to do trips as a group as we get older and all that. That would be fun. I just read on wikipedia about being legally blind. I'm still not sure if i am. Oh well. Another post perhaps. I'm growing weary. Therefore, im going to go sleep for a long time.

"event","Ahhh. Christmas. A time for joy and laughter among other things.  Well, i know i havent written in this thing in forever. And for that, I am truly sorry.  I hate to have neglected all of you loyal readers out there. And by loyal readers I mean absolutely no one considering i havent written in this thing for months.  Well, my semester was good. Same old same old. I've gotten into a groove with this whole college thing.  New semesters are not nearly as exciting as they used to be.  My Christmas break has been sweet. I came home and basically played a whole bunch of video games with my friends every night of the week. Then, i went to the Grand Canyon for a week and hiked down into the base for 3 days and 2 nights.  I'm gonna sound really geeky when i say this, but it brought back alot of my old geology knowledge that i thought i had long since forgotten.  I mean, i was able to remember what certain rock formations where called and all about erosion and all sorts of random, useless information.  Oh, about me being geeky.  I watched the casting call for the new Beauty and the Geek season on the WB.  And i realized something.  I have more in common with those geeks than i would be willing to admit.  All of those guys are painfully shy around girls. And i have come to realize that i fall on the side of the shy rather than on the side of the incredibly secure.  Most of the guys on that show have no self confidence and can't even fathom a girl that is beautiful ever wanting to date them or find them worthwhile.  And this is gonna sound sad, but alot of times I feel like that as well.  Wierd, eh? Becky volunteered to make me a video to audition for that show if i wanted her to, but i declined as I thought that my social skills were much more refined than those of the geeks on that show.  Seriously though, i think i could go on that show and win.  I would be awesome at that.  Maybe i should try out for the third season.  I have no clue what I would my video would contain though.  Probably something with xbox or some other type of video game. It is what i really enjoy doing besides camping. Well, this whole post has been incredibly random and probably seems like i am a very depressed person or at least that im feeling very depressed at the moment. I can guarantee that i'm not depressed but I have been doing some thinking about these things.  And now for something completely different! I bet you didn't catch that reference did you. It's from Monty Python. But, seriously, here's what im taking for the semester:
    English: Shakespeare
    Poli sci: Texas Legislature
    Poli sci: Intro to political theory
    History: History of England
    Info: Business Information System Concepts

Yep. After this semester, I will have a poli sci free senior year. It's gonna be too awesome.  Feel free to comment me. I swear i won't bite. Haha. That was a joke son, a joke. Did ya catch the reference? I won't tell you where its from.  Well, thats about it for this edition of ""Personality in Spades"". I'll catch ya on the flip side. Later days y'all."

"event","Alright. Update time. I know i havent been very good about writing in this thing over the summer and the past couple of weeks. Believe me, if you had worked as much as i did you wouldnt have had time either.  I pulled a month of 7 days a week, 12 hours a day.  That has to be the most physically exhauting amount of work around.   I didn't think it was possible to work that hard.  But, I get some really nice bank out of it. I enjoyed that.  I quit my job on august 1st so i could prepare for my calculus final on the 9th.  Funny thing, I did better on my final when i wasnt working. Go figure.  I got something like an 89 on my final. Which made me happy since calculus was pretty hard for me. I understand it pretty well now though.  So thats good.  I left for IMPACT on the 13th so i could be back in town for our meetings on the 14th.  Impact was so awesome and such a blessing for my life.  I learned alot and really got to know my freshmen.  Hunter, Ashlea, and Moriah.  If y'all are reading this YOU ROCK.  It went by really quick and it was awesome.  We won Rodney the spirit horse for our rendition of the OOMPAH LOOMPA SONG.  It was sweet.  We definitely set the bar high for spirit type cheers at Impact.  Now, im back in college station living with my totally awesome roommates.  I didn't know what it was gonna be like going into it, but it is so awesome.  God moves in awesome ways.  He totally covered me, and gave me 3 totally rock solid Christian guys to live with this year and next.  And, its alot of fun.  They are a strange bunch, but im told i fit in like ive been here years.  So, thats another God thing. Everyone should come meet my roommates sometime.  They are very snug.  Oh, snug is the new ""tight"". Use it well.  BYX rush is next week, so im excited to see all the new pledges and start getting to know them.  I think we are gonna have a really great class this year.  But, not better than the pledge class of 2004!!!  And now for something completely different.  I'm on Upstream Prayer Team now.  I applied this week and found out on thursday that I'm one of the final two people to be on Prayer Team.  I went to All Faith's on Thursday and got to meet everyone and get to know them.  I also got to stand in the back in case a freshmen wanted to pray with us.  I think this is gonna be a great thing.  My prayer life isn't awesome, but i know it can be through God's help.  And, i know that i can definitely be on my knees in prayer for the freshmen.  I really want to do that for them.  I know that my Upstream Prayer Teamer was awesome and helped me out alot even if he didn't know it.  So, if you are reading this Marcus you are awesome and so is your blog!!!  But mine is pretty awesome too.  We found out what groups we will be with last night at Central.  I'm in GROUP 9 with Charlotte and Quan(sorry if i spelled that wrong).  Its gonna be awesome.  I feel like im a step ahead since i already know Charlotte.  And i had already met Quan earlier this week.  It's so amazing how God works.  For a while it was like i couldn't feel his presence in my life(even though he was definitely there), and now its like i feel his presence all the time.  I am definitely having a great semester so far. I'm on top of all my reading, and i think im gonna continue to be through out the semester.  That way, i can bring my GPR up.  Well, have you had enough yet? I know, i know. I'm almost done.  Thanks for being patient.  I love aggieland and I love each of y'all.  Well, thats about it for this edition of ""Personality in Spades"".  I'll catch ya on the flip side. Later days y'all."

I realized something tonight amid the family trouble that has been haunting my life for the past year.  And i dont mean immediate family trouble. Ive just had alot of family members pass away.  And now, my uncle has lung cancer. He has been given 8 months to live. And he doesn't want treatment.  My dad went up there, and found out my uncle has started drinkin again. I've really realized how important and how much i take my family for granted. I don't know what i would do without Mom, Dad, or Clint. I love them all so much. They are all the most important people to me. I miss them alot when im here. I can't wait to be home and see them everyday. I miss my walks with my mom. And my arguments and story telling sessions with my dad. And video games with my brother. They each have a spot in my heart that no other person on this earth can fill.  I would miss them tremendously if they were gone.  You know that saying ""you dont know what you have til you dont have it anymore""? Well, i know what i have now. I know how much they mean and i wont take them for granted anymore. Not a way on the earth for me to forget how much i love them. I know this has been a sappy post but I love my family and family deaths and illnesses make me feel this way.  I love my Impact camp too.  I love that they are praying for my family. That is so reassuring.  It makes me feel secure.  And, THANK YOU KELLY AND ANDREW for praying with me tonight!!!! It was great, and i know my family appreciates it.

"event","Late night post. Yep. I love posting. Its such an outlet for me for my frustrations and inner thoughts.  I had a good couple of days. Still tryin to break habits.  Its hard. But i shall prevail!!  Been doin some thinkin, and I need to run after Christ with more intensity.  I need to be ready and skilled enough to do battle with the traps and slings.  And, at this point, the little rabbit traps that you see on cartoons are catchin me.  Don't get me wrong. The big bear traps catch me alot too.  But, Im tryin to change. I really am.  I still need a Barnabas. That position is still open. By the way, I love my IMPACT camp!!  We played ultimate and i wasn't much help due to my ankle having flared up. I don't know why it keeps acting up. Oh well. No use complaining about something i can't change.  I played alot of Jade Empire today. I know. I'm a dork.  Can't change that either. I did that instead of quiet time!!! HELP ME.  I just put it off and never did it, thinkin i could later. SOMEONE BEAT ME UP and LIGHT A FIRE UNDER MY BUTT!! All it would take was a match.  But, i can't rely on everyone for everything. I should learn to do for myself.  And now for something completely different!!  My partner is awesome. Such an encourager. I do believe im going to a baseball game with her and some other KFC guys and gals.  Things are lookin up.  I have actually started to smile, or try to make myself smile as i walk around.  I think its better received than my normal blank look. haha. Well, thats it for this edition of ""Personality in Spades"". I'll catch ya on the flip side. Later Days y'all. I love each and every one of you. Y'all mean the world to me.

"event","Howdy. Im updating once again for my faithful readers. Im thinkin only Miss Lauren Dunlap reads this. So, if you're reading this, Im glad you read and im glad you comment.  All the rest of you, STOP BEING BUMS AND COMMENT SO I KNOW YOU READ.  Im just sittin here after a wonderful day.  I love Sundays so much.  I didn't go to church unfortunately.  So, if you read this and go to Central Baptist then call me sunday mornings til i wake up or offer to pick me up or somethin.  I have no car so if i have no ride that equals no church.  But partially im making excuses. So wake me up!! I wrote my essay and then I hung out and then i went to my KFC(Kids Fun Camp aka IMPACT) meeting and told my testimony.  One of the girls told hers and she said something that rings true in my life.  I havent felt God's presence or hand on my life in a while. And that sounds bad, but i have been really lax in my part on the relationship.  God's standin in the doorway(he's been invited in) but I haven't let him sit down yet. If you catch my drift.  I don't know God the way i should.  I put up a nice front. But i don't.  I really, really want to.  I just never think about quiet time or reading.  I pray but not as much as i should.  Im not exactly A team material at this point.  But, i hate to put all my fears and woes out on you.  Even though, you= probably 2 people.  But, then we went to Coffee Station to study and i did philosophy homework.  I got it all done!! Im so proud of myself right now.  If you only knew how little i truly did.  I have nothing but time yet i never have time for God. And that makes me sad that i do that to myself.  I count myself out before even playing.  SO, if you are reading this, encourage me in that. Ask me what im doing over aim and if i say ""nothing"" then tell me ""maybe you should go spend time in prayer or reading your bible""  or studying. GET ONTO ME.  Id appreciate it. I love you all. I truly do. I love each and every one of you.  And, i wouldnt used to say that. I have been so full of hate, and i now realize that it has poisoned me against the people i love.  And i dont want that. I want to love each and every one of you fully. So, I need to lighten up and let bygones be bygones. I need to forget what people have done in the past and live for Christ.  This has been a great post. Ive loved writing it, even though you probably dont wanna know about my problems.  Thats about it for this edition of ""Days of My Life"" and ""Ive Got Personality in Spades"". Ill catch ya on the flip side. Later days y'all.  Love you.

Its a good feeling. Keeps my feet on the ground. I had a good day. I went to all my classes today!! amazing, isnt it. I enjoyed them all. I should be more diligent about them. I love being me. I have found out that I just need to be me more often. I need to let my fun side out more. If i dont it might just take over all the time. haha. Well, i dont have too much to say this time. I had fun in confrontin conflict with jen. Neither of us pay attention and just talk to each other via our notebooks. Its a good time. Then i always walk to H20 fountain and then walk back to my dorm. Its good. Now im sittin here listenin to Shaun Groves. Thats it for this edition of ""Ive Got Personality in Spades"".

"event","Sorry Timmy but you need 15 tickets to live. Haha. Great stuff. Well, update numbero 2 for this week.  Today was good. I only had one class and then lunch with my incredible partner, Stephanie.  Good times were had by all. We shared our testimonies. I think we are really getting along as a partnership.  God definitely put us together for a reason.  And since im not him, i can't see the whole picture as to why but im not worried. It is workin out great so no cause for alarm.  I then came back here and talked to James(alvin) for a while about his busted ankle since we share the same injury.  I decided that i should become a risk assessment agent for college kids about their dirty clothes.  Think about it.  When you are out of clean clothes, do you pick the shirt from the bottom of the hamper or the one you didnt wear that often but is still dirty? On one hand, the top shirt wasnt worn as much but the bottom shirt hasnt been worn in a while and has had time to air out.  The bottom of the hamper is kinda touch and go in my opinion.  Its a risk. Therefore you need a risk assessment agent. And that could be me. Kinda like Hitch but with clothes instead of women since we all know that i know little to nothing about women and probably never will. Then i came back and did laundry so i wouldnt have to hire a risk assessment agent for my clothes. Then i ate dinner and watched Secondhand Lions. Great movie. Definitely worth the buy. I havent bought it but i probably will eventually. Robert Duvall is awesome. Great actor. I just finished it. Now, im off to bed before i zonk out at the keyboard and end up hitting a bunch of AAAAAAAA's. ya know? and that would be bad because i only like to go A-A-A-A-A. Class of 07 baby. Holla. Ok, that felt odd to say that. I can't say stuff like that without feeling incredibly retarded. haha. Well, thats about it for this edition of ""Days of My Life"". Ill catch ya on the flip side. Later days y'all.

And lauren, im sorry i havent. for those of you Impacters reading this, Im talkin about my friend who goes to SFA. haha. Well, there are very few weeks left in the semester. So here goes. GARRETT'S SCHOOL UPDATE!!!! Im passing everything. Go figure. haha. that was a joke btw.  I just skipped Intro to Philosophy. I hate that class so much. So annoying. Yep. Really annoying.  I should have gone. Now im just sittin here. Well, Im having a great time just kinda ridin out the end of the semester. Im a drifter. Few can drift with the skill that i do.  I have class at 225 so im gonna leave soon. Very soon.  I have decided that i need to read more books like Jesusfreaks volume 2. When i read about people giving up their lives for Christ, it makes me feel all tingly. Its something i hope i would do in a second. I dont know though. Its easy to say that i would but when the time came would i? I certainly hope i would.  Thats alot of woulds. After that many woulds it doesnt seem like a word anymore. Could just be me.  But i have 2 more classes, a quick dinner, BYX meeting, and an Impact prayer meeting!!! Day doesn't seem so long anymore. Well, im off to Intro to World Politics. Should be a blast and a half. <------ notice the heavy sarcasm.  Thats me. A sarcastic opinionated guy who will talk about almost anything. hit me up on comments. I am startin to think no one reads my journal and that would make me shed a single tear. *sob sob. yeah, right. Thats about it for this edition of ""Days of my Life"". Ill catch ya on the flip side.

"event","Yep. Im a man at large if that makes in sense. Think about the word large. doesnt sound like a word after a while. Kinda like patio, and hip. Oh well. I have had an interesting few weeks.  I forget when i updated last. Seems like several years back but i know it hasn't been that long.  I made a 90 on my history exam, and a 72 on my philosophy exam. I might have already told all of you avid readers this before though.  I had impact retreat this weekend on friday night and saturday morning.  We got our partners!!! My partner is Stephanie Gertson. Definitely one of the coolest girls ive ever met. She loves pancakes. She also is a professional pancake flipper(although, its a self imposed title). All the partnerships in our camp worked out really well. Im really glad Stephanie is my partner. We are gonna work really well together. My camp is totally kickin.  We invented the sloppy high five. Ill show it to you sometime if you really wanna know.  So we always keep it sloppy. I have moved on from Seinfeld to Smallville. Good show. It's the only show on WB that is worth anything, in my opinion. But don't take my word for it.  I also spent about 2 hours last night worrying about an assignment that i came to find out later isnt due til the 21st.  Sad, eh? I thought so. Oh yeah. I got up this morning at 7 and went running and then lifted weights.  It was really refreshing. I think ill wake up at 7 every monday wednesday and friday.  I am really tired  now though.  I dont know if ill be able to stay awake through the rest of my classes. Ill try my best though.  Oh yeah. I played some Halo2 last night.  I totally smoked the competition. Just thought id let you know, in case you cared.  But i doubt you do. At least about the halo.  Well, thats about it for this edition of ""Days of My Life"". Ill catch ya on the flip side.

"event","I subscribe to Ferris Buellers theory of the Ism.  Nobody should believe in isms, they should believe in themselves.  If you were to put an ism on it, it would be Selfism.  Hardcore philosophy comin your way so watch out!! Thats right. Im a philosopher of sorts. One day, this theory will be called Garrett's theory of Selfism.  Yep. Its got a nice ring to it, eh? I think so.  Ive had a very tiring monday.  I had class from very early(945... yes, thats early) til like 525.  Then i ate dinner with Wes and had a great BYX meeting, then back to the dorm for some Seinfeld. NO SOUP FOR YOU!!  haha.  Good times.  Once i finish all the seinfeld episodes that will bring my series knowledge to four different shows.  That 70s Show, Southpark, Family Guy, and Seinfeld.  I also do a good Cartman impression if you ever want to hear it.  I don't approve of all the cussing in Southpark but i do think the show does a good social satire.  Then i had a prayer meeting for IMPACT!!! Omega Judah baby!!  Heck yeah.  It rocked.  I enjoyed it immensely. We broke off and prayed as a camp.  Totally cool.  Im lookin forward to gettin to know all the Godly Men and Women in our camp.  Ive decided that Godly college females aren't girls.  They are women.  Ive decided that if i want to think of myself as a Godly MAN and not a boy then i need to realize that there are Godly WOMEN out there and not girls.  I'm goin deep. Real deep.  Be prepared for you are about to enter the Twilight Zone(aka My mind).  Being a MAN is superior to being a boy.  So, being a WOMAN is superior to being a girl.  Therefore, the words make a difference.  There is some formal philosophy ISM for this but i forget what its called.  Ill update later and tell ya.  I don't want to be called a boy for i am a MAN.  So, i don't think its very respectful to call Godly WOMEN girls.  This is just my line of thinkin at 107 in the mornin.  Oh yeah. My day. Sorry. I went on an extreme tangent.  Then i came back here and studied some Texas history.  I love being from a state that emphasizes its history like we do.  Its hardcore.  I read over my notes like 4 times. I figure im prepared.  The first test always tells me what to expect.  Im also thinkin about running to be a Senator. A Liberal Arts Student Senator that is.  That could be really tight.  It would put my foot in the door for Student Body President.  Who knows though? Ill think and pray about it for a bit.  Well, thats been my day/night.

And by good, i mean i had a stinkin awesome day.  It was the kind of monday that dreams are made out of.  Yes, im very happy today.  Want the lowdown? Prepare yourself, for its about to be brought down.  I woke up this morning after slamming my knee that is healing(from an embarassing bike crash last week) into the wall by my bed.  I know what you're thinking.  Did i fire 5 shots or was it 6? Well, seeing as how this is a .44 magnum and could blow your head clean off you gotta ask yourself one question; Do i feel lucky? Well, do ya?  Oh, yeah. Thats Dirty Harry. Sorry about that. I do know what you're thinkin though.  It wasn't a good way to start the day.  But then i had a nice shower and some God time.  I like havin God time in the shower.  It helps me set the day out right.  Then i dressed, checked email, and went to pick up my IMPACT letter!!!  The survey says.... IM AN IMPACT COUNSELOR!!!! Heck yeah. Majorly awesome. Im totally excited.  Then i had class, a lunch break, philosophy, then a canceled world politics class, a good talk with one of the girls in the class who applied for impact, and some Halo.  The halo frustrated me but then again when does it not?  Then i ate with Mark, Matt, Wesley, and the one and only Andy Winniford.  Yep. Rumours is definitely the best food on campus.  Then i had a tight BYX meeting.  Which by the way, BYX is stinkin cool.  I got my new cell group tonight.  I really like it already.  The guys seem really cool.  And they are really involved with each other's lives.  How awesome is that??  My cell group last semester was tight, but im excited to get to know my new cell group. Then i had a very good conversation with my mother and brother for like 45 minutes. Clint is doing much better and I'm deeply relieved.  He had our family worried for a couple weeks.  Everything is lookin up now though.  I'm gonna head home in a couple weeks to celebrate Clint's birthday. Nothin fancy. Just family and fun.  Then i came back and finished up Tomorrow Never Dies and The Matrix.  Both great movies. By the way, GO SEE MILLION DOLLAR BABY!!  That was my day. Pretty exciting, no?  I thought so.

"event","Major Update. Yep. Gonna give it a whirl. It's one for the history books. Well, spring semester is under way.  I'm takin a cool 15 hours.  Yep.  Comparative Politics, Intro to Philosophy, Intro to World Politics, Confronting Conflict, and Texas history.  Yep, i can't get enough of my texas history.  I'm so proud to be a Texan. I wouldn't trade it for anything.  I also love being an Aggie. Nothin compares to it. It's a great thing. Alright, update on my life time.  Yep.  Well, besides class i'm still in BYX and i'm tryin to get more involved with Central Baptist.  I think getting involved will help me meet people and give me more of a tie to the church.  I think that is what i need.  A tie to the people.  That helps i think.  I have been quite the social person this semester as of yet. I've been hanging out with more people and havin lots of fun.  I went to go see Million Dollar Baby the other night. With Clint Eastwood. That's right. The most hardcore guy out there. I wish i could be him.  I  would love that. Oh well. I'm quite content to be me.  It was a great movie. Amelia didn't like it but i thought it had a great message and was well acted.  Definitely best picture material.  I watched teh super bowl tonight.  I didn't really have any ties to either team but found myself wanting the Eagles to win.  Just because I think the patriots need to be taken down a few notches.  Too cocky in my book.  I watched it with the  Triple Chunks. Yep, Group XIV(14) back together again.  It was great. I have really missed everyone in taht group.  It was a good thing for me last spring and I wish i got to hang out with all of you more.  So hit up my cell and lets hang out.  I went to church this morning with Sander and Whitney.  By the way, they make a great couple.  They compliment each other nicely.  Plus, they are both really super nice people.  I really respect them.  Sander is givin me rides to all kinds of stuff and he has been a kind of mentor to me.  I definitely need that.  I need someone to tell me that i need to get involved and get stuff straightened out in my life.  A good kick in the butt every once in a while.  I think it's a positive thing.  OH!!! I nearly forgot. I FIND OUT ABOUT IMPACT TOMORROW MORNING!!! How tight is that??  I hope i get to be a counselor but if not thats fine. I have come to realize it wouldn't be a personal thing.  They just would feel that i belong elsewhere.  Thats about it from GarrettLand.  Where i make the rules. If you are curious about those last two sentences hit me up and ill explain. Thats it for this edition of ""Days of My Life"". Ill catch ya on the flip side. Later days gang."

"event","Howdy. Its Christmas time in Aggieland once again. Its actually cold  too. Im not too excited about that. I don't especially like jeans. I prefer jean shorts. They are more my style. Alright, at this point ive taken four out of five finals. Exciting, eh? I had drama and geography exams on friday. I had Intro to Public Administration, and Interest Groups yesterday. Today is a do nothing day considering i have no exams. Im gonna study tonight. This afternoon is for doing nothing though.  None of my exams have been too hard as of yet. I count myself lucky considering I'm not taking classes such as ochem, physics, chemistry, geology and others of that nature. And yes, geology is hard. I took it last year. It kicked my butt. And i actually tried in there.  Oh well.  Military Ethics exam tomorrow. That should be great fun(heavy sarcasm). Ive grown tired of essay tests for this semester. They cramp my hand up. Im left handed and write odd. Wanna see for yourself? hit me up. ill show ya. I don't care. Everyone finds it interesting. It is. I find it interesting too.  Oh yeah. There was the BYX party on friday. It rocked.  It was at Lee's house.  We had a big fire and music going.  It was cool.  I enjoyed myself immensely.  It was the most fun ive had in a long while.  The cops came out though.  He told us that one of the neighbors down the block had called in a noise disturbance.  They didn't approve of our music choices and the volume.  I thought that was funny. It wouldn't have been if we had gotten ticketed. But we didnt so it is.  I saw Ocean's Twelve on Saturday.  It was a very cool movie.  It completely confused members of our group though. So i ended up explaining it. No big though. Wasn't somethin i minded doing.  I kinda enjoy explaining movies for some reason.  I'm going to DISNEY WORLD for Christmas. It should be fun. Im hopin I can get my mom to go on more rides this go around.  She barely wanted to do anything last time.  We will actually be in Disney World on Christmas Day.  Which should be interesting.  Fun and interesting. We are also going to Key West. Ive heard some odd things about Key West so we'll see. Ask me when i get back and ill tell you about it. Well, thats about it for this edition of ""Days of My Life"". Ill catch ya on the flip side. Later days and remember ""You'll get tired of a slinky in a day. Im puttin you down for flashcards. Math. Thats what you're gettin for Christmas"".  Merry Christmas!!!!!!!!!"

"event","BYX Formal 2004!!!!!! Heck yeah.  I actually attended a dance thing. Its like the third formal type deal ive ever been to in my life.  I didnt get into them in highschool.  Not my cup of tea then.  I really enjoyed this one though. I went with a gorgeous girl named Taylor and a great group of girls and guys.  We rode up with Taylor's cousin Warren and his girlfriend Danee.  They are two of the nicest people ive ever met.  We met up, ate at Chick-Fil-A, and got on down the road.  We stopped once or twice for the girls to use the bathroom.  Then we went to the Galleria.  I attempted to ice skate for like 10 minutes.  I dont know why ice skating bothers me.  I think its the lack of ankle support.  Do i sound like a wimp? I can do practically any other sport but ice skating or roller skating.  Those two arent my thing.  We then walked around the mall.  The girls went and looked at clothes.  Warren and I went and looked at cool gadgets.  They had some super cool masage chairs. We ate lunch, looked around some more and then headed to the hotel.  We stayed at the Residence Inn(correct me if im wrong guys).  It was tight!!!!! For 150 dollars, our group got 3 separate suites. Each suite had 3 rooms. Two bedrooms and a living room. It was tight. I have to hand it to Charlie. He put it all together. It rocked.  The girls had 2 suites and the guys had one.  I didnt mind though.  Two of the guys were gonna sleep on the floor. I would have but they jumped at the chance to sleep on the floor.  One time my mother told me in high school that I shouldn't sleep on the floor when I went to Florida with band because ""I could get herpes"".  That story cracks me up everytime. Its funnier when i tell it. I swear it is.  Ask me to tell it to you sometime. Ill be glad to.  The girls started getting ready and the guys all watched football.  Heck yeah. Im always down for watchin college football.  We all got ready and headed to the formal. We had some good food and some dancing. We didn't dance.  We left pretty soon after the dancing started. Either that, or we were taking gobs of pictures. But pictures are alright. Im tryin to work on the whole me not being photogenic thing. It would certainly help.  We went to The Cheesecake Factory around 1130.  It was fun to just hang out with everybody and chat. Then we headed back to the hotel.  3 of the couples( Me and Taylor, Warren and Danee, and Andrew and Summer) played Trivial Pursuit(90s edition).  Im proud to say that Taylor and I won.  I think we won. It's possible it was a tie with Warren and Danee. It was fun.  Then a night of sleepin like a rock. I slept so good. My bed was like super comfortable. Then we headed back this mornin at around 1110. It was a good ride. I fell asleep. Or at least I think i did. I dont remember about an hour of the ride. So i assume i fell asleep. Oh well. Thats about it for this edition of ""Days of My Life"". Ill catch ya on the flip side. Later days everybody."

"event","BYX. indeed. Its personally my favorite thing i do.  I have enjoyed it fully.  This week was NSHW or ""not so heaven week"".  I was called to do stuff on tuesday and thursday or actually like 2 hours ago.  A bunch of us filled this guy's room and car up to the brim with like 60 pounds of newspapers. Its gonna take him like 3 weeks to get ever bit of it out if not longer.  I finished all my interviews. This week is formal. You guessed it. Im not going.  The girl i asked gave me the run around.  She gave the excuse of ""I dont know what im doing that weekend"", proceeded to blow me off for a week, and then tell me that her new boyfriend might not like it if she went with me.  So not only did she lie to me, but she basically crippled my chances of finding another date by waiting a week to tell me the truth.  Yeah, so that sucks.  I really wanted to go too. Oh well. No use crying over spilt milk. There will be other formals. Initiation is Monday. I dont know whats gonna happen. I dont care though.  It'll be cool i imagine.  I follow the first rule of fightclub on things like this: Dont ask questions.  I also follow the first rule of the Recruit: Don't get caught.  Those two rules make for a pretty binding thing, dont you think? I have no class tomorrow whatsoever. So haha to all you class going people.  Have fun with that. Oh yeah. To any BYX guys that might read this and are going to formal: Ill be praying for your travel and that you have a Godly time.  Have a bit of fun for me while you are at it.  Ill be sittin around. Well, its 209 AM and im rambling.  That about it for this edition of ""Days of My Life"". Ill catch ya on the flip side. Later days."

You guessed it. ESSAYS!!!!! Yeah buddy. Me and essays are gettin to be great friends. We are like super tight. I woke up this morning or rather afternoon at 1245. Yep. Past the crack of noon. Felt good too.  No regrets.  Then i sat around.  Sitting around is good. I dont like sitting behind, below, or next to stuff. Around is the way to go. The ONLY way to go.  I find myself becoming extremely tired of school for the semester. I wish to be like Van Wilder. I wanna just hang and throw rockin parties. Or rather just hang. Im not a partyier. I think its ""partyier"". It might be ""partier"". Dont know. Its too late for coherent thoughts. My roommate and a friend are playing Madden on PS2. Ive been sitting. Oh yeah. I made 100 copies of directions to a party i wasnt even going to. I should have gone. It would have been fun. Or  thats what im told. It was a BYX thing. I need to be more involved.

We ate at Gattitown and then went rollerskating. Yes, i skated. Or, I tried to skate.  I fell down alot.  I think i was holdin my date back. She actually could skate. I felt bad because i couldnt. Its cool though. I had a fun time despite the falling down. Then i went to the game on saturday against OU. I think we deserved the win.  We did better against OU than Texas did. And that is all that matters in my book. Because OU and A&M might have to play each other but we are united on the hating of Texas.  Thats right. I think we are gonna give Texas a good game at least this year. Or a royal butt whuppin. Im hopin the latter is the game.  Well, its late and i have a military ethics test tomorrow. Its gonna not be fun. Ill be prepared. Thats about it for this edition of ""Days of My Life"". Catch ya on the flip side. Later days. OH, and i went to church on sunday morning.

"event","Yep. Death. Im broachin the subject. I dont know if thats how you spell that word but whats someone gonna do? Correct me? Go for it. I welcome it.  On monday my grandmother passed away. She had alzsheimers for 12 years.  My parents called me and told me that she had pneumonia that morning.  I knew what was gonna happen. I hoped she would pull through and i prayed about it. I prayed heavily about it. I felt taht it was her time.  My parents have an odd habit of callin Wes before they call me when a family member dies. I knew thats what was up when they called him on monday.  I was sittin right there.  I saw it ring.  I knew what had happened. There wouldnt be any other reason they would call Wes. Im ok though.  Ive been prepared for this for years. God has really laid a sense of rest upon my heart. Im content.  I know that all will go on. And everyone will eventually be made stronger because of it.  I have to believe that good can come out of bad. Otherwise i would snap. Really. I would. Two grandparents passing away in one year. Not a good year so far. Don't get me wrong. Im havin a good semester and I am generally a happier person this semester than last semester. Im really tryin to brighten my outlook on things. I think i can be happier that way. God is really moving in my life this semester. Mostly through BYX and through personal study but alot of it is because I know that im doing stuff wrong and wanna fix it. I am probably not the most consistent person in my faith but im tryin to correct that. I fail alot of the time but itll get better. Yeah, so if you could keep my family and i in your prayers that would be awesome. Id greatly appreciate it guys. Thanks. I don't know who reads this or whatever but if you can just leave me a comment or somethin. Just so i know whats up. Alright. Thats about it for this edition of ""Days of My Life"".

Im definitely a sinner. Does that blow your mind? Yeah. doesnt blow my mind either.  I definitely need salvation. My life is nothing without it. Yeah. This is my first spiritual post.  I know. I went on a BYX retreat this weekend. Kevin made an awesome point.  He asked us if some of us felt like a fake during church and worship sometimes. And the truth is I felt like that alot.  I felt like that I was just some big poser in God's house.  Like I wasn't truly worshiping.  He also talked alot about being a prince.  After this weekend, I figured something out. I am a prince. I am one of God's sons. I need to take up my sword and be ready to rush the gates of hell for God. I think i have finally realized what that means. That i need to be always on guard.  He also made some great points about temptation that really hit home. Ask me and ill be sure to tell you about them.  The whole weekends sermon was based on Jesus being tempted by the devil in Matthew.  Ask me if you wish to know more. Im about to go to poly sci which is why i wont write all about it here.

Funny, no? Long story. Ill explain it to you in person if you ever truly want to know. I doubt you do so ill save myself the time and not explain it. Monday was good.  It was square dance night. Im not exactly the most graceful person but i made the best of it. Lets just say that size 14 shoes arent exactly made for dancing. Tuesday was tacky night and I didn't participate. I dont own anything tacky. At leat nothing i consider tacky. What exactly makes something tacky anyways? Write comments and tell me.  Id also liek to hear what everyone thinks about my tournaments idea. Hears the gist(is this how you spell ""gist"") of it: You could be the best in the world at something and never know it because there are no tournaments. Think about it.  Let the depth of that thought roll over you like an ominous cloud or something of that sort. I could be the best envelope sealer in the world and never know it because there are no tournaments. Its a great concept and one I will put into fruition one day. I shall have a tournament of wierd events to determine the best at it. If you would like to be on the mailing list or just simply donate money to my cause you can send a letter to ME or just simply drop me an email. I will be glad to take cash, check or money order. Credit cards are always fun as well. Wednesday was the night we went to the ""wave"" pool. I was decently surprised. The waves were fairly large. I didn't swim seeing as I look like an albino beached whale at this point in my life and i dont want to scar anyone and have to pay for their psychiatric evaluations.  Thursday was client night. It was sorta touching i guess. Some of the clients have such faith in God. I really respect that and admire them for being so grateful to God for just giving them the ability to walk. That is really awesome.  It really helped show me how much i really have. It does that every year. Its kinda like a gut-check. I dont do it for that though. I do it because I love it and love the people that go. I also do it because I love getting to know the clients. Its my favorite part. Friday was some mardi gras theme. I didn't care for it personally but I have never really cared for the concept of mardi gras anyways. Friday was also share night. I didn't share because I am really picky about how i phrase things in speech type settings. If it doesn't all fit together i wont speak. Its just who i am. Saturday was sad because we all went our separate ways. I was a CGLA or Color Group Leader Assistant for those of you who haven't been to UM ARMY which means i didn't get to know as many of the high school kids as i wanted to. I always like to come away from UM ARMY knowing more people and having more friends but I dont think I did this time. I have some friends from there I guess but I dont know how long we will keep in touch. Well, Im rambling. Thats it for this edition of ""Days of My Life"".  Ill catch ya on the flip side.

I work like 20 hours a week because my managers refuse to schedule me for more even though I do a good job.  Im looking for another job. If i dont find one soon I might just go off into the deep end. Im serious. I might not be back at A&M because ill be in the loony bin if this keeps up. Oh well.  Ill deal with it I guess. I am currently on a diet type thing. I feel better than I have in years. Im not on any of these fad diets either. Mine is all hard work and running.  I have currently lost almost 25 pounds since coming home for the summer. I hope to lose much more over the course of the summer. Well, thats it for this edition of ""Days of My Life"".  Ill catch ya on the flip side. Later days everyone."

"event","Tis the last monday for the semester. Sadness. Not really. Im looking forward to seeing all my best friends at home.  I have missed the ones who don't go to A&M.  Well, yesterday was interesting. I woke up and went to church.  I was quite tired and found the sermon a little dry so I closed my eyes. I didn't fall asleep but I almost did. Then after church we went to Fazzoli's. Good italian food. Major. Then we came back to campus. I worked on my english essay for like 2 hours then watched part of Holy Grail with Emory, Charlotte, Greg, and Matt. I most definitely fell asleep.  They decided to leave me there. So i ended up sleeping in the TV lounge by myself for like 45 minutes. They all thought it was hilarious.  So if any of you read this, I will have my revenge!!!  Just kidding.  You will get your come-uppance though.  You won't expect it but it will come anyway.  Im just sitting here doing nothing for a while before I start on my essay again. That essay will be the death of me yet. Oh well.  Thats it for this edition of ""Days of My Life"".  Ill catch ya on the flip side everyone. Later Days. Oh, and if I don't see you again before the semester is over chances are that I love ya. I mean, if you read this chances are you know me and are oen of my good friends. Later days."

"event","Ahh. Saturday. good day for doing nothing.  I have written a bit of my paper. I still need to do alot more writing on it. Good thing i have like 4 days. Ill write like a paragraph a day. It should be a good paper. One i will put up on my refridgerator at home. I dont think thats how you spell ""fridge"" but im not gonna try again.  I am sitting in the scc talking to a bunch of LJ people on a chat room that Wes made. Good stuff.  The day has been pretty unproductive as my roommate would say. He is the most driven person i know. Seriously.  He works on studying like 6 hours per day all semester long. I hope he goes to med school otherwise all this work will be for naught. Like that word? Its me having been writing for a while and getting out of the writing mode. Haha. Well thats about it for this edition of ""Days of My Life"". Ill catch ya on the flip side.  Later days everyone."

"event","update on my day. I thought it was going well and then i got a call from Jay who is one of the Upstream leader saying that Im not a leader for next year.  This is no good. They gave me this really generic message like ""We feel God is leading you elsewhere and not to this ministry."" How generic.  I mean that is really generic. Oh well. Looks like im not going to be doing anything next year because Breakaway recquires that you be immersed in order to be a volunteer. Once again, Garrett is counted out. Looks like its going to be a pretty crappy fall semester. Thats it for this edition of ""Days of my life"" Ill catch ya on the flip side. Later days everyone."

"event","Exams. I hate the nasty little buggers. I had a exam once. It wouldn't drink alcy-hol so i bit its bloody head off.  Haha. Celebrity Jeopardy.  Funny junk.  Well, i finished my sociology exam recently. It wasn't that hard or so i believe.  Well the year is slowly winding down. Its been a great year in Aggieland. I love it.  I will talk more about this as the week goes on and my semester ends. Well, I have not found out about Upstream leader yet. I am beginning to think i won't ever find out or that they only called the people who made it and Im not one of them.  I need more patience. Its one of the things the Lord and I are working on together. Or more like the Lord is working on in me. Thats more like it. I have little to no patience.  My dad and I are more like each other than we will ever admit.  We both just get so incredibly angry at times. I severely get angry back home.  Im like the Hulk.  Don't make me angry. You wouldnt like me when Im angry. Seriously. Oh well. Its being worked on.  Pray for patience for me if you will. Id greatly appreciate it. I should be studying psychology.  I don't know how well i will do on that exam. I studied but I couldn't concentrate on the information. So i quazi-understand/know the material. Well, I have a party to attend tonight at Bernie's for Upstream group number Fo'teen. Its gonna rock. I need to remember my camera. So if you read this don't let me forget it. Well thats it for this edition of ""Days of My Life"".  Ill catch ya on the flip side. Later days everybody."

"event","Sunday. Second to last this semester. That means its almost full fledged SUMMER!! Booyah!! Almost have one year of college under my belt. Cool beans. It has been tought and the last two weeks are gonna be hard but thats ok.  I have two tests next friday followed by a research paper and a test on tuesday. thats all thats left. Not much, eh? I am gonna try to keep up with this journal over the summer but I don't have broadband so i will be on more sporadically. Therefore, add me to your favorites or memorize my journal address. That would be cool.  Well.  I have been doing research today. I have been finding the occasional source. I think that I can manage seven sources about word choice in The Hobbit.  Fun stuff.  Well I went and watched the gang play foosball. I hate that game. I dont think its as fun as pool. Not in the slightest. They seem to enjoy it though. I guess thats all that matters.  The song of the day is Weezer's Island In the Sun. Good stuff. I am gonna try to write 2 paragraphs of my essay tonight. So be praying that i stay focused. I need all the prayers i can get because I have almost no concentration.  I sometimes think Im ADD. I know im not though.  Well thats it for this edition of ""Days of My Life"".

"event","Yeah. i have a lazy eye. Want to know how i know i have one? some symptoms include: Clumsiness, Poor vision, and a difference in how my eye looks in pictures taken with a flash. Yeah. I have all of those. I dont think i am that clumsy but my family is convinced that i am.  Blows, eh? This is why i have been taking bad pictures for years. Seriously. So if you ever want to take pictures of me dont use the flash. Then you will get great pictures of Garrett. Thats the only way. Seriously.  No more flashes for Garrett. dont even try it. You will get bad pictures.  It is only visible in pictures but that is only a precursor to it being visible always. Which really cuts my already low aesthetical value. Oh well. Nothing to be fixed now. Its a problem ill just have to deal with. There has to be a reason. Well im gonna watch Monty Python's the Meaning of Life. The song of the day is Boyz II Men's Its so hard to say goodbye to yesterday. Thats it for this edition of ""Days of my life"". Ill catch ya on the flip side. Later days."

"event","Well. Here i am at friday again. I went to history and english where I proceeded to get nervous about speaking in front of my class when it was only like a 2 minute thing.  Thats pretty bad considering I am a Political Science major. Suckage, eh?  Well, I had a great thursday night. I went to Upstream as usual.  It was all worship night and let me say it rocked. It did go a tad long though.  I my voice was starting to strain but thats nothing some sleep didn't fix.  Then we went over to my uber-cool leader's apartment.  We watched our very own personal group slide-show. Cool beans. Then we came back to campus. Travis, Amanda, Daniel T, Evelyn, Alicia, and I all played Nerts. Is that how you spell that guys? If not contact me and I'll issue a blanket apology for mis-spelling it.  Well I ate at Fuddruckers again tonight. Good food. Ran into Aaron there which was cool. Im always glad to see my friends. Wes and I went to Fuddruckers with this guy named James(who was cool) and like 8 girls. Count em. 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8!!!!  I mean this guy was pimpin.  Seriously.  I look up to people like him and Sander that are always around a group of super cool girls. I daresay I even envy them.  Very lucky they are. Thats Yoda speak for ""They are very lucky"".  Haha. Such a dork am I.  The song of the day is Weezer's ""Photograph"". Major.  Well thats it for this edition of ""Days of My Life"". Ill catch ya on the flip side. Later days everyone."

"event","Ahh. tuesday. kinda like monday but not.  I went to sociology because it was the last class period of the year and i felt obligated. I also went to psychology because of obligation plus the fact that he might have taken roll for extra credit. And he did. I did nothing in there though. Didn't stop Sander from not showing up. It astounds me that he can skip that class and still stomp my face in on every test. Disgusting isnt it. I think so. So Sander and I have successfully mastered relationship theory. We figure that it's not finding the ""perfect girl"" since no such female exists; it's figuring out the thing or things that you don't want the little lady interfering in (video games, sleep, whatever). Once you've pinpointed it, all you have to do is find a Christian girl that realizes she can't and shouldn't jack with you on it and you're golden. Odds are there's only one or few at best that will comply and still really like you for who you are, so the ""perfect girl"" should find herself. Oh, the genius.  Sander wrote this but since i was in on the discussion i think i kinda co-wrote it. The theorem really is genius. It works for girls as well. I mean it should work. Ive never tested it but it works on paper. But then again lots of things work on paper. Like communism. It works on paper but in the real world it sucks. Thats just the truth.  I don't beat around the bush.  I get straight to the heart of things. I accidentally didn't go to Breakaway tonight. I accidentally put a load of clothes in the washer 20 minutes before Breakaway was supposed to start. Major suckage, no? Other than that ive been doing fairly decent. Thats it for this edition of ""Days of my Life"".  Ill catch you on the flip side. Party on!! Garrettsworld, party time, excellent!! Later days. Comments wold be nice. They let me know you read. And they inspire me to write. So everyone needs to write comments. Laura, you keep writing too. I always enjoy hearing from ya."

"event","Yes. I shall sit here til one of us expires. And believe you me, I have a logn time. Another day, another journal entry.  I would have said ""Another day, another dollar"" but i have no job. That would kinda hinder the whole dollar thing.  The only money i have is to sustain me on meals off campus. And its not much. Therefore im strapped for cash. I wish that people would pay me to be me. Thats a job I can handle. For serious.   I watched When Harry Met Sally today. It's on the list of the top 100 comedies of all time. At one point he says that he doesn't think that men and women can be friends. I agree with him for the most part. I think that men and women can never be true friends because there will always be a part of them that wishes that they could be a couple. I do think there can be a non-couple relationship. Oh yeah, and he addresses women being low maintenance and high maintenance. His point of view is clearly almost the same as mine. He tells her that she is high maintenance because she is really picky. I don't know any non-picky girls. I think that every girl on the planet is high maintenance. Seriously. Don't hate me because i think this.  For all you ladies that read this its not meant to be offensive. I think that high maintenance can be good. It just isn't on most girls. There are some that do well with it though. I don't have a list of who they are but I know them when I see them. Write me some comments and tell me what you think. Im truly interested to know. And once again, don't hate me or scold me for my opinion.  Just inform me of your opinion in a business like manner. Hate is never good. As i always say ""Don't hate, appreciate"". That saying can be made into like 400 things. For instance ""Don't hate, integrate"" Thats for all you engineers and math people.  Or there is ""Don't hate, retaliate"" or ""Don't hate, reciprocate"". Think of the possibilities!!  They are endless. Seriously. Thats about it for this edition of ""Days of My Life"". The song of the day is Relient K's Staples. Ill catch ya on the flip side!! Remember: Ponies Die. What you need is a good pair of boots. Later days everyone!"

<b>1. What were you doing 10 years ago?</b>

It was summer after my freshman year of high school, so I did not have a job, and I had just made a group of friends to hang out with anytime my mother would drive me to North County or Alpine. I'm pretty sure my X-Files IRC chat roleplaying game met on Tuesday nights. I remember specifically going to the Del Mar Fair one day with my group of OLP posse and me and Eunice leaving early so we could race home and get on IRC and game it up. 

<b>2. What 5 things are on you to-do list for today?</b> 

- Make it through the end of the work day without falling asleep at my desk
- Do not get drunk at firm softball
- Get a base hit at firm softball (no forced outs at second!)
- Do not give in and eat a delicious beer brat at firm softball. Think of the amnimals!
- Get to bed at a decent hour

<b>3. List some snacks you enjoy.</b>

- Brie cheese and pear on crackers
- Fruit (nectarines and apricots especially)
- Chips and guacamole

<b>4. What would you do with a billion dollars?</b>

- Travel
- Put away enough money to never have to work again, if I live simply
- Write stories, knit, volunteer, ride my bike, and get a community garden patch
- Buy land to build a house on, or buy a small house in a great location
- A billion is a lot of money. I hope I'd give a fair amount away.

<b>5. List the places you have lived:</b>

- El Cajon, California
- Santa Cruz, California
- Portland, Oregon

<b>6. List the jobs you have had:</b>

- Dog and cat kennel associate
- Vons bagging clerk
- Pier 1 sales assistant (something I was truly horrible at)
- TA for ESL students at SDSU
- Creative Writing Department intern
- Legal assistant (labor law)

I have eliminated the question to tag others, since I figure, if you want to fill this out, you will. Calling you out specifically will not necessarily force it."

"event","For about a month, my bus stop has boasted a framed picture of Buddha shoved up under the eaves. I finally remembered to take a picture of it on Friday, and then someone stole it (or the owner retrieved it) by this morning. I'm disappointed. Buddah was a lovely calm start to my morning.

The weekend was hot. Stinking hot. Bloody hot. It was 100 degrees on Saturday, with breezes from a hot oven, significantly cooled to sticky, humid thunderstorms last night. I'm strutting like a pigeon, however, because I successfully created a delicious no-mayo no-mustard menu of popular summer picnic foods for our picnic last night. 

- Deviled eggs (which I have never previously tried, given my distaste for mustard and mayo) made with sour cream, cumin, turmeric, and parika.

- Potato salad with sour cream, shallots, white wine vinegar, dill, and tarragon

- Pesto pasta salad with pine nuts

- Fresh blueberries and voignese wine

We set out for a picnic right as it started to rain. But this is Portland, and in Portland, Amanda must stop bitching about the goddamn rain on Mount Tabor and find a copse of trees with high canopies in Laurelhurst Park that successfully kept almost every drop of rain off my head (and would protect us from the lightning, if it was closer). So cheers to that, trees."

"event","I love that fruit talks to us. Fruit actually <i>tells us</i> when it is ripe by putting off those delicious smells and enciting us to eat them. Yesterday? I could not smell the nectarine on my desk. Were I a primate or an animal incapable of analytical thought, it might simply be a pretty ball of something not that interesting in the general scenery. But today, friends. Today that nectarine smells of honey and nectar and I want to hold it and sniff its delicious skin and then eat it slowly and savor it and spread its seeds around the world just like the fruit is telling me to do. People, this is <i>communication</i> with <i>nature</i>! It is amazing. Just like a nectarine. It makes me so happy. Because I can sit here and enjoy its delicious scent in the air until I decide to devour it. And then go find more. For it is summer, the season of fruit and happiness."

"event","I am having one of those days where I feel restless, reckless, and anarchistic. I want to shave my head. I want to get a tattoo. I want to sell all my worldly possessions and live in a carpark, or a van under, or in a tree. I want to hitchhike again with just a backpack and no money. I want to be a part of a revolution, a massive protest, take back the streets, decry consumerist excess, throw a rock through a window. Redefine freedom, since I know I'm not living it. I want to quit my job and screw the money question. I want to set fire to something. I want to sleep under a freeway. I want drug experiences, relive ones I've tried, and explore the ones I haven't. I want to eat good food without worrying about how far it came to get to me, what sort of environmental footprint it had to produce, whether the vegetables have been chemically processed and are wreaking havoc on my system, whether the fish is full of mercury, whether the oceans are full of plastic, how much packaging I'll have to throw away, and how much money I'll have left for food tomorrow. I want to live on next to nothing. I want to unplug. I want to sit under a goddamn tree instead of in this too-cold office wasting time until I can move on.

Stagnation is more than a state of the body, simply sitting, though I am that. Stagnation gets to be a way of thinking and I've been trapped there for some time. I can't tell you how many times I've written goals for myself, active ones: run, hike, camp, explore, methods of truly interacting with the world, and it is so difficult. It is so much easier to sit and think, to watch, to plan, not to act. And it's a sad, sad state of affairs when I admire the people who are actually getting up. Just getting up should not be the basis for admiration. Is this really what we've become, or what I've become? Too complacent, too many excuses and not enough time, stagnant and starting to mold? I don't even know where to start sometimes, I've done the small steps. I want the big ones. I think these moods are worse because I don't know where to start the big ones. The ones that matter. The ones that require real lifestyle changes that I want to make, but know it'll mean leaving behind one helluva lot of security. I suppose I'm getting closer."

Craig and I went out for Chinese food tonight, after a stressful work day for me, and his fortune read, <i>Time heals all wounds. Keep your chin up.</i> No joke! My fortune told me, <i>Good things come in small packages. One is coming to you.</i> A very special person sent me some CDs in the mail today. Thank you, Chinese cookies, for your cheerful psychic powers.

The News of the Finger is all good news! The pain has decreased sharply, he hasn't taken Vicodin all day, and he no longer needs to ice it constantly. Of course there's some pain and discomfort, but it's manageable. He got his wound re-dressed yesterday, and other than the Incredible Inconvenience of having to drive a half hour to get him to his appointment (the hospital is a 20 minute walk from our house. The surgeon has a practice in West Fucking Linn), it was a positive experience. My index finger is now the same size as his. He gets the stitches out in two weeks! We took a horribly gruesome picture of his knuckle (with a scar running down it like a sideways grimace on an eyeless face) and sent it to Allison. He's gotten incomplete-extensions for two classes until October, and managed to type his final paper one-handed for his third class. There's still blood on his tennis shoes, but we both find that hilarious.

Karmic gifts work, my friends. Monday afternoon I had a doctor's appointment that sent me home with six months of free birth control. Then I got home to a notice from the IRS saying I was to be economically stimulated to the tune of $600. Two weeks ago, I didn't think I would be receiving a bribe, since Craig got his weeks ago, and didn't much care since I didn't need it and it's just adding to the deficit. But now we have a potentially huge emergency room bill looming, so woo fucking hoo!

Allison broke my vegetarian vow for an evening, but since she arrived at my house with swordfish steaks baked with lemon slices and rosemary sprigs, and creamy Danish cheese with fresh pear and salami slices to cook for us, I consider it an exception well made! And dear god, I do love fish.

All I need is for some goddamn sunny effing weather. OBLIGE ME, WEATHER GODS."

"event","Craig got in an accident with a table saw on Friday afternoon. The tip of his left index finger was beyond repair. So it was removed to the knuckle, about a half-inch. The fingernail is gone. This shouldn't be a significant handicap, in all likelihood he'll still be more able-bodied than me once it heals. My wrists still prevent me from pushups, rock climbing, lifting boxes, or sustained typing, and he'll be able to do all that once he relearns some things. But his gorgeous long fingers. All last night during Bill Moyers Journal, and at the pharmacy, and in the car, I just see fingers, slender fingers, of everyone around me. It's a powerful image, fingers, and when they're removed, and why, and how fragile they are. We use them for everything. Craig's are particularly beat up: he broke one on ecstasy, his right hand was rolled over when a car lost its brakes, he cut one with a cleaver last year (those scars are gone now). Missing fingers are marks of carpenters, miners, wizards, and my grandmother, who got one of hers cut off in a sawmill when she was a little girl. I know two other carpenters with the same injury. Power tools are exceptionally dangerous. Johnny Cash's older brother was killed by a table saw, you know.

He's in pain. But he's handling it. I may have to take him back to the hospital tomorrow to alter his medications, which are making him nauseous and dizzy and itchy, and aren't really helping with the pain. I feel almost self-pitying posting this here, given how none of you have actually met Craig.

I'd just really like things to start looking up now, please.

I'm sorry to all you casual readers. I really do try to keep my blog a cheerful place, though I know I've just been too busy to blog about all the nice things happening lately. This year is just so fucked up. When bad things happen, I slow down. He's 26. That finger should have lasted him another 40 years."

Speaking of vegetables, I've been having the most gourmet lunches every day this week, that I want to share. I've been having a half mixed greens salad with walnuts, dried blueberries, vignagrette, and this marvelous locally-made blue cheese, with a whole grain sandwich of goat cheese (also local), cucumber, and sprouts. So delicious. It takes a good ten minutes to prepare it all, but it's healthy and filling and doesn't give me a food coma thirty minutes later. Yay!"

Things I have successfully done in the past five months:

- Read 15 books! 
- Just gave in already and went vegetarian
- Knit slightly more
- Travelled to California a lot
- Helped train my dragon boat team to a full victory at Rainier two weekends ago
- Purchased seeds and planted strawberries and garlic
- Reconnected with some friends
- Made plans to move into a house come September
- TURNED IN PAPERWORK TO PSU, woo!

Things I have not successfully done:

- No hiking
- No camping
- No yoga
- No running
- No sewing. I was an idiot and maanged to throw away my bobbin holder.
- No planting of any vegetables, since Eddie ruined our tomato and basil sprouts

I would like to blame all this lack of exercise on the crappy weather, but being as I chose to live in the Northwest, Land of Constant Sorrow, I really need to suck it up and deal. And buy a damn raincoat I like. But JUNE, people. What gives. Where is my summer?

I actually knit this twice to get the perfect fit and color combination, it's a top-down raglan knit with alternating balls of yarn to stop the pooling. The pattern has an optional pocket to add to the front, and I had the extra yarn for it...but I think I like it as is. It's a bit more sophisticated with the neckline, and the pocket will just make it casual. 

The sweater is actually several shades of brown, I'm not sure why my camera turned it purple. But I love it! I've already worn it out for martinis.

Her head brushes several sheets of plastic wrap that have been wound around the top of the car to keep the broken skylight from leaking on her when it rains. She does all her own car repairs, and drove around for three weeks before she realized she'd installed her battery backwards. Neither door will open from the inside. The backseat is still covered with hay from when she owned two goats in North Portland, and the car came free with a shoebox full of mid-90s cassette tapes. She carries an empty gallon jug to every place we visit to fill up for more water, so her car won't overheat. She's excited because the heat is working. She recently upgraded her room in her house from the freezing-cold attic to an actual room with an actual window, but it requires jumping down from a three-foot high ledge to enter it.

She was totally, completely serious. ""I have such an easy life! Sometimes I think, wow, this can't last. It's too good."""

- May 9-10, Fly to San Francisco for Adam's graduation.
- May 10-11, Drive Nana's car back to Portland.
- May 13, Turn 25.
- May 14-18, Mother arrives to visit Portland.
- May 17, First dragon boat race of the season (drive to Tacoma, Washington)
- May 18-23, Oregon registration for car, plates and likely a smog test (Notable because of $$); get new car insured, try to boot old car.
- May 29-31, Fly to San Diego for Thomas' graduation.

All while working 40 hours a week, with dragon boat practice 3 times a week, and maybe, MAYBE some training for the Starlight Run again (ha!). Oh, and knitting. And eating, somewhere. I need to start buying carbon offsets for all this damn flying I've been doing. Yagh!

So this leaves me the month of April to: get the Suburban in shape for selling, start running, start gathering paperwork and loan options together for school applications in June, finally visit the damn dentist before I start the wheels moving on leaving my job, get my eyes checked and shell out for new glasses and possibly contacts for summer for the same reason, and...try to enjoy the spring sunshine. Oh, and I need new socks. And new running shoes.

I took pictures while calling on the boat last Saturday, and have been an idiot and forgotten to upload them every night. The season is going really well, despite being SNOWED and HAILED ON last Wednesday. Yes, friends, we are paddling on the fucking river in 40 degree weather.

I'm terribly upset, but of course it's something of a relief - this is the end of several long months of constant stress, worry, and prolonged grief for my mother. It's awful that this comes so close on the heels of Uncle Bobby, but at least now she can finally take some time to heal. The only thing I want of my Nana's possessions is the wooden back-scratcher I made for her when I was 5. The five pegs are nailed in off-center, it's just a bunch of blocks that I sanded and hammered together in a childhood woodshop class, but Nana always said she used it ""all the time,"" since I gave to her. And maybe a teacup from Newfoundland. And her knitting needles. One of the last things Nana said to me was, ""I have to get better soon, Amanda. We have to knit together."" I'm not sure whether I can go down for the funeral, but I'd like to try.

Uncle Bobby's body finally got back to the states yesterday. Dad said the paperwork and bureaucracy was a Brazil-ian nightmare, but it all worked out. Someone had stolen Bobby's shoes. Dad said he suspected they ""cast lots for his clothes."" Luckily, his wife still had his wedding ring. According to the police report, there were business cards found in the hotel room, but the Mexican police department refused to hand them over.

In the ""good news"" column, we had our first dragonboat team meeting of the season last night. I just made myself a truly excellent gin martini. I am going to a ""support my boy Obama"" housewarming party on Saturday. The sun is coming back."

"event","When my mother said, ""Well...I was going to call you tonight,"" in That Tone of Voice, I immediately thought my Nana was dead. Two weeks ago, Nana developed an infection that is extremely difficult to cure without working kidneys. Or maybe it was my Uncle BG, who was diagnosed last year with a rare form of bone cancer that very few survive.

But apparently, two weeks ago, when my Nana was so sick, my Uncle Bob arranged to fly from Texas to see her. He got on a plane, got off the plane in San Diego and rented a car, and promptly disappeared. Missing persons reports were filed, my father used his connections to the DEA office and American Consulate in Mexico, and the same day that both Texas and San Diego police tracked the rental car and Mexican hotel (10 days after his disappearance), my father found a picture of my uncle on a Mexican missing persons/found unidentified bodies website. That was Wednesday. The Mexican coroner stated the cause of death was a heart attack. He was found in a hotel room on January 31.

We have no idea why my Uncle Bob, who had a past history of substance abuse but had been clean for years, went to Mexico instead of going to my parents' house as planned. His wallet and cards were stolen, and my father spent several days helping Aunt Kristin cancel and refute charges from Wal-Marts in Tijuana before we knew anything, but we have no idea what really happened or why he was there. My father and Uncle Scott are going to Mexico all day on Monday with some knowledgeable people to fill out bureaucracy paperwork at what's probably going to be every governmental office in Tijuana, and my father's mentioned taking out quite a bit of cash before he goes in case he needs to bribe anyone. The body should be back in the United States by next Tuesday.

Nana can't be told. She's done the impossible yet again and kicked that infection, but though she is improving, she's very ill. We thought we were meeting up for Nana's birthday so we all had a chance to be together before she died. Turns out it was the last time any of us would ever see my Uncle.

I woke up early and finished my fourth book of the year (<u>Breakthrough</u>, finally, which was much better as a thesis statement and speech than as a book, but I think his message of approaching environmental politics from the sense of optimism and innovation being far more effective than doomsday scenarios is spot-on) with a pot of tea and some sourdough toast. Then we made pumpkin muffins and cream cheese frosting from scratch (which I have delicious leftovers for breakfast), and biked to North Portland.

North Portland is about a 40 minute bike ride from my house, but the weather report said ""no rain,"" and it truly was gorgeous and cool until we got to 84. There, the sky opened up to pouring rain and a massive hailstorm. Not so fun riding when hail pieces are bopping off my nose, but it was hilarious, and we hung around Allison's space heater while she made us a brie and apple scramble (which was far more amazing than I could ever imagined). Then we immediately rode home all together, in perfect chilly spring weather. The rest of the day was spent knitting on my top-down raglan by the fire, I had my precious enchiladas with avocado for dinner, and I feel so fantastic this morning. I knew I had been missing exercise, but the cold-cold-cold makes it difficult to motivate. I hope this sparks the beginning of my bike season - the ride to North Portland was the longest one-way trip I've taken, and it was glorious. And that the weather warms up enough for yoga in my apartment without freezing my ass off.

As for books, now that my ""optimism quotient"" is fulfilled for a few weeks, it's back to the hair-tearing exasperation and depression that is <u>Blackwater</u>. Yay weekends!"

This is the third time this winter I've worn a sweater to work and discovered it had a hole in it. THE THIRD SWEATER. Either there was one damn devilish moth in my closet last year, or I will WAGE WAR on the SO-CALLED luxury sweater consumer world that makes sweaters to last a mere two years, assuming you will BUY a new sweater every year and therefore HAS NO QUALMS about using shoddy yarn without quality workmanship, BECAUSE REALLY HOW CAN YOU EXPECT GOOD WORKMANSHIP FOR AN $80 SWEATER MADE IN CHINA FOR 50 CENTS A DAY. 

This is why I should not purchase ""nice"" things. Nice things are NOT worth the money we ripped civilizations off to pay for, get HOLES IN THEM which are difficult to fix WITHOUT MATCHING YARN, and I do not have matching yarn because I did not make this sweater. And I should not purchase nice things because I clearly cannot take care of them properly, since I did not stuff the sweaters in my dresser and FILL THEM WITH MOTHBALLS DURING THE SUMMER MONTHS.

Also, it's been frickin' freezing here. And the library has decided to make four of the 300-page books on my holdlist available all at the same time, all to be read in a three-week window without renewal options. Damn it."

"event","I spent New Year's Eve in a falling-down punk rock house without heat, without insulation, with a goat, space heaters, really good weed, a sharp-clawed kitten, and whiskey. We nearly missed midnight. It was a lovely, small party, trying to convince cynical revolutionaries to vote before rioting, planning local political action, debating whether Allison or I were more Catholic (I think I lost), asking the Ouji board if spirits lived in the attic, and a quick trip to a crowded Northeast bar with an amazing butternut squash tart. I didn't get to bed until 4:30 a.m., which is unheard of for me, and babbled a mile a minute about any concept I found exciting at the moment, which isn't at all unheard of for me.

Today has been slow, sleepy, grappling with ""babbler's remorse"" (resolution: practice self-acceptance, but try to think before I speak), Zelda: Wind Waker, frogging an entire top-down raglan sweater because there were too many little mistakes to be happy finishing it, and a cute Indian boy from AAA replacing my car battery (resolution: sell car, soon). 

My last entry mentioned a few silly resolutions I've been tossing around, but when I really think about it, my resolutions are largely the same as last year, or every week: Write. Blog. Knit. Run. Hike. Camp. Read. Save money. Reduce consumption. Reduce footprint. Progress."

I love resolutions time, though I'm definitely the sort to make huge, life-changing resolutions that are very difficult to implement immediately with success (i.e., ""eliminate all plastics and packaging from life""; ""buy only organic cotton underwear"" - which seems to be just as goddamn hard as you'd think it is; ""have a vegan day once every week"" - those of you who are aware of my cheese obsession may laugh now). 

I have no idea whether I'm ""doing anything"" for New Year's yet, either, though I don't really care. I'm actually happier doing something active and life-affirming on New Year's Day, like a long walk at sunrise. I've been invited to some parties, but it's occurred to me lately that I only ever enjoy parties when I'm drunk. And I enjoy them when I'm drunk because I'm relaxed and happy and feel confident, but if there's any rule about drinking and being sociable, it's that ""I am not nearly as funny as I think I am,"" and I still spend the next three days worrying over what ridiculous thing I said that sounded funny at the time. Sigh. So I'm leaning towards ""mountain hermit.""

"event","So the slipper tops are done, and while they look adorable (I took a picture but forgot to upload it last night), they are too big. Way, way too big. I cannot reknit these. They took three days, all 50 ends are woven in, the argyle is stitched. I could not find leather slipper soles at two craft stores. I decided to fudge the design and knit the soles. Soles still too big. Slippers do not even fit Craig, Boy of Big Feet. I have been working on this project nonstop for a week and it's not working out. At all. I am dreaming yellow and red intarsia and getting more and more stressed because there is just no way I can make this work by Christmas. And I hate the project.

I called my parents. They said, ""Bring the slipper pieces, make him a scarf, if you can't get any of that done, wrap it all up in a big box and write 'works in progress.'"" So I'm going to the yarn store at lunch to find chunky yarn in boy colors to make a quick scarf (hopefully quick - I've never made a scarf in less than two or three weeks, but then I never work with big yarn). Or I'll take him with me to buy yarn in San Diego and pick out a pattern. I think he might like a sweater, and depending on whether he goes to Maine for college, mittens. I hate those kind of ""IOU"" gifts, but it's really the only option at this point. Argh! Poor kiddo. I hate not having things done in advance. I just assumed no one would want knitted things for Christmas this year, and gee, that's what everyone asked for at Thanksgiving!

"event","So I had a pretty darn successful little NaNoBlogMo - given that there were no real requirements other than ""blog more."" Check! And then I let it lapse for two weeks. I've been going through a cycle of hating my job (Craig is out of school for a month. A MONTH. WITH NOTHING TO DO. I am so jealous), so when I get home, the last thing I want to do is get on the computer and mess around, or Think Deep Thoughts About My Life, and I hate blogging at work because I always have the hope and dream that I'll manage to coax some decent lighting out of my apartment and take a photo or two. Considering much of what I've been up to is Christmas knitting, photos are a necessity. Maybe this weekend.

I've done all my shopping, save tracking down a place to buy my mother a massage gift certificate in San Diego, and two out of three knitted presents are completed. That gives me just under two weeks, one full weekend, to knit a pair of men's size 11 argyle slippers (my only worry is that the pattern is kind of insane. To get gauge, it tells you to <i>pull the yarn plies apart</i> and use two out of three plies held together to knit with. WTF??). As long as I can track down some leather slipper soles at Michael's this weekend, I should be fine. 

I'm reading a lot. A LOT. Science books, environmental studies, Russian lit. Which is really nice for my brain and helpful to deal with how frickin' cold and dark and depressing it is outside lately. It's snowed every Saturday this December, and it might snow again tonight. Unfortunately, it's all melted the second it hit thr ground, but at least it's pretty. I'm spending most of this weekend baking and decorating gingerbread cookies (polar bears!) for local friend gifts before I skip town next weekend.

"event","My brain is taking another holiday. There is no earthly reason why I should be exhausted after cuddling under blankets, watching old TV shows, and knitting socks for my mother last night. But I wake up in what feels like 5 a.m. blackness, and it's already 8 p.m. blackness when I leave the office. Long days at the office, ramping up to the pre-Christmas bluster, with nothing but gossipy witch-ladies and snotty attorneys to interact with. So a whole day goes by, and all I've accomplished is dressing and feeding myself, and putting dishes in the dishwasher without turning it on. No lights on upstairs. Awesome.

It wouldn't matter so much, this isolated unproductivity, if my brain didn't shut off in the process. That's what bothers me. If I spent an evening listening to podcasts and knitting lace, or reading, or thinking wandering thoughts about more engaging philosophical questions than ""I really ought to clean the house more,"" or hell, if I'd even cleaned the damn house, I'd consider that at least ""time engaged."" But zoning out to reruns of <i>Scrubs</i> with New Elliot (I hate New Elliot - just put on makeup and sexy clothes, that will give you confidence!) while I knit stockinette stitch in the round and pet my cat just doesn't have any mental activity going along with it. It doesn't have any creativity. I want to build things, real things, larger things, grander things. I have no earthly reason to build a goat shed or a greenhouse or a tile mosiac, but I want to. Actually learn some damn bike maintenance, despite it being 35 degrees in my garage, and pouring rain outside, well, maybe a space heater? But then it means buying more crap to do crap to keep myself entertained without watching crap on DVD. I want creativity that stretches to the size of my house, the size of my car, thinking larger than tiny hands and tiny needles (not that I don't love my tiny needles). I probably just want more physical activity. I skipped yoga on Sunday. I need to start running again.  Maybe if I start training now, I could run Portland marathon next year. Or Hood to Coast. Oh I am so good at these glorious plans, but all signs point to ""No, I won't. I will get halfway there and fall short. As usual.""

Also according to Wiki, if a dry cleaner uses perc, it's a contaminant that contributes to smog and 70% of which ends up in drinking water supplies, and a carcinogen that increases the risk of cancer and the rate of miscarriages for dry cleaner workers. Maybe Hawthorne Dry Cleaner doesn't use perc? Or they're advertising as GREEN because they don't...waste water?

"event","If I ruled the world, I would do the following things:

1. Abolish leaf blowers. The most ridiculous device ever created. They are incredibly noisy, inexcusably noisy, and completely inefficient. Well, you say, they are for the collection and removal of fall leaves. No! No, you see, what you have there is some massive, gas guzzling machine that simply <i>blows the leaves around</i>. Usually from the lovely lawn under the birch trees in the park, where they collect in pretty piles and actually look like fall, blown out into the street. Just blow 'em around! Nevermind the fact that half the leaves will be blown <i>back onto the sidewalk</i> by the passing cars, and the other half will sit and rot in gutters. It is the ultimate tool for the lazy jackass.

1(b). Take noise pollution seriously! There are studies showing the stressful and anxious effects of constant noise pollution on our population. Walking through two beautiful parks on the way to work is sorely marred by the constant rr-rr-rr of the damn leaf blowers and the crazy car people. 

2. Either create car-free days in downtown urban centers, where only bikes, busses, and pedestrians are allowed, or, if I could get away with it, abolish cars in downtown urban centers altogether. There is no point having cars downtown. There are tons of pedestrians, construction, bikers with nowhere to go - cars downtown are constantly stuck in traffic, parking costs $10 a day, it adds to noise pollution and the general sense of alienation most people feel in our society. Also, I'm tired of nearly getting run over every single day as cars speed through intersections tryign to catch lights, so they can jump onto a freeway that's deadlocked to Beaverton. Every day!

Daylight Savings Time Ends = The Last Week I Will See the Weekday Sun. I'm currently getting some daylight as I walk from the bus stop to work, and maybe a few minutes more when I'm on the bus downtown in the evening, but it pitch-dark by 5:30, people! Soon we will not have enough daylight for an eight-hour workday, and I will yearn for an office with a window. Or a job at the farmer's market. Still, my desire to read and memorize the complete history of all peoples on the planet is well-timed for this shifting of seasons. Or, at least, it would be a shifting of seasons if the season were actually shifting. It's November and the Northwest is still sunny, dry, and warm.

Free to spend my Free Time however the hell I wanted, I suppose. Now that I have an idea, a real idea, I'm feeling trapped and stunted.

We've lived her for two years, so it's not out of the question that they would raise our rent at some point - it actually surprised me that, so far, it hadn't happened. But we know the other apartments are currently only $10 more than our current rent. Also, what happens if we choose not to accept the wonderous offer of being locked into a new lease and paying them $15 more each month?

We had to call twice, have the company track down the landlord, and wait for return calls for three days to find out that if we stay month-to-month, our rent will be raised $30. Wow. That might have been good information to include in the letter.

"event","So things are changing around here.

Craig was accepted into the PSU architecture program, which is fantastic. What is slightly less than fantastic for me is that it is damn near impossible for him to hold even a part-time job while being a full-time student - he could barely manage working and attending one studio class last year, this year he'll be taking three full classes. So while he's gotten some loans to help with his tuition and expenses, I will be the primary provider for all rent, cat litter, and groceries. Which I pretty much was anyway, but Craig's income helped with groceries and luxuries. Now there will be no luxuries.

In an attempt to cut expenses, and also to start living the lifestyle we find necessary, we're making severe econo-enviro-changes in our life. Read <a href=""http://www.bestlifeonline.com/cms/publish/health-fitness/Our_oceans_are_turning_into_plastic_are_we_2.shtml""> this article</a>, and watch <i>A Crude Awakening</i> for some of the most recent reasons. Luckily, most of these alternatives are going to be cheaper in the long run, and the ones that aren't cheaper will just eliminate the budget for Unnecessary Crap to Purchase anyway.

<lj-cut>

Item 1: I am making serious steps to go completely car-free. We spent Saturday outfitting my bike for grocery runs, which is our last major step for day-to-day car stuff. I bought a bike rack, a nice new lock, and some waterproof saddle bags. We were temporarily stymied by the fact that crotchety old Odabee Jones is too old to have rack hookups, but a quick trip to The Bike Gallery yesterday provided us with an adapter. 

Item 2: Something we had been meaning to do for months, but we eradicated all toxic chemicals from the apartment. The Chlorox, the Windex, the Kirkland Signature laundry detergent, the Kirkland scented dryer sheets. What's lovely is that about 5 or 6 bottles of chemical product have been replaced by just three bottles of all-purpose green alternatives. We'll see how well they work. There's always good old cheap baking soda.

Item 3: An attempt to follow the <a href=""http://100milediet.org/"">100 Mile Diet</a>. This will be impossible to do entirely with our budget and driving limitations, but there's a farmer's market three blocks from my office, a local grocery next door to TJ's, and a lady in my office who sells organic, free range chicken eggs from her son's farm. We're going to do our best.

Item 4: Severely limit the amount of plastics and disposables that come into our lives. I think we should take a visit to the Portland landfill just to see how much of a problem our disposable economy has become. Our collection of cheap plastic pens, disposable razors, all the unnecessary packaging in food, it all goes somewhere, and it Never. Goes. Away.

Item 5: Grow a better garden. Seriously, ours sucked this year. And when the oil is gone, food production is the one thing that scares me. Most of our food is made with oil product fertilizers.

Item 6: Learn to sew. I can't afford a sewing machine right now, or have room for a fabric stash, but it's an excellent way to limit consumption, recycle old fabric, and avoid plastic packaging. That's my Christmas goal.

I've refrained from mentioning this on my blog until now, for the squick factor, but I've also switched to a <a href=""http://www.divacup.com/""> Diva Cup</a> and <a href=""http://www.gladrags.com/""> Gladrags</a> for monthly things, which is seriously the best thing I've ever done. A one-time expense will take me for 5-10 years without needing to purchase products that are disposable, bad for me, and bad for the environment. Look into it. It's very empowering, it's a million times for comfortable than plastic products, and you're Doing a Good Thing.

It's going to be impossible to do all these things strictly - no religious adherence, but a firm commitment. My car insurance needs renewing in January. If I can bike ride to the grocery store in the rain, I'll sell my car, and instead of buying a new, smaller, energy-efficient vehicle, I will sign up for <a href=""http://www.flexcar.com/""> Flex Car</a> to rent a small, energy-efficient vehicle for camping and once-a-month errands.

</lj-cut>

Phew. So this blog, if I keep it up, might get a little enviro-centric. It sounds rather doomsday-ish, but we have to start now. We should have started yesterday. This is going to take a significant amount of effort to reverse the damage our crazy world has done to the planet, and I'm starting with me.

Not much to report. Dragon boat practice takes up most of my spare time in the evenings. I started paddling on intermittant days, which is hella hard work, but incredibly envigorating. Works muscles I never knew I had. 

I fell off my bike last weekend, dented the handlebars, and have a raspberry the size of a softball on my thigh. No more riding until I put a hundred bucks into it to replace the cables, clean out the gear shifts, and fix the handlebars. Sigh.

I was completely apathetic about <i>Order of the Phoenix</i> and <i>Deathly Hollows</i> until about two weeks ago, when I realized ""Holy shit! This is the end!"" I have since been gripped with that same fervent, passionate POTTER-MANIA that has made this work week feel INTERMINABLE.

I am passively enjoying my yearly crush on my firm's new summer law clerk. Le sigh.

That a variety of fruit, in differing numbers, must all ripen at once, in a single wave of deliciousness? No rebels or independent thinkers here, we are a fruit collective? That if every piece of fruit is ripe on the same day, at the same time, they know there is a small chance their human captor will become full of their sweety and juicy goodness, and leave one precious nectarine untouched? Free? Free, yes, but lonely? 

Seriously, though. I want my goddamn fruit."

Portland continues its goofy weather of bright sun, 70 degrees, and sunburns through my sunscreen...directly followed by pouring rain and wind. Luckily, the sun came out again long enough for me to dry my jacket and enjoy the sun deck of the lovely yacht serving as the ""start boat.""

A retiree and 15-year member of the Dragon Boat Association, and Sister City Society, lines up the four boats of each heat and starts the race. My job was to hold a walkie talkie in front of him.

The race starts at the Ross Island Bridge, and ends at the Hawthorne Bridge (which is that green one). A good race time is 3:05. Each heat takes approximately five to seven minutes to set up, race, and clear.

I am nervous. I just had my last practice with the team calling before Alcan in Vancouver, we leave on Friday. Good news is, the team is very encouraging, and I do sometimes remember how to count. And, even if it all goes poorly, there is room on the team for another paddler. Helloo, upper body strength!

It's been a very long time since I was a member of a team. It feels very uplifting. Like breeding confidence. It isn't just the sense of belonging, it's the synchronicity, how I am beginning to feel when the boat is at the perfect speed, the energy rising as they power up, when I am calling at the perfect rate, and the paddlers are all in tune, counting together, cheering themselves on, forcing through the water and the wind.

We're going to kick some ass this weekend.

"event","I'd forgotten how much I dislike riding my bike downtown. I am in casual-work clothes,&nbsp;a goofy helmet, and am panting and wheezing to make it up 12 blocks of hills with impatient cars&nbsp;idling along behind me.&nbsp;It takes five minutes to ride from my house on 50th Street to the Hawthorne Bridge (essentially ""1st""), as it's all down hill and deserted on side streets, and another ten to fifteen to get over the bridge, and up the&nbsp;hills&nbsp;from 1st to 12th, with Every Business Sedan stalking my back wheel. But success! I have ridden my bike to work. Day 1. The Plan was to ride my bike every day in June, thus saving the $3 a day I spend on bus passes.&nbsp;

The Plan was stalled by four days of rain. The Plan is now up and running. Odabee Away!

I feel much more confident after dragon boat practice yesterday. I got extremely wet, and cold (rain, choppy water, pirate ships shooting canons on the Willamette), and yelled until my voice was hoarse.&nbsp;I am practicing calling in my steps, along with the microwave, in the shower. ""1-2-3- HOO! 1-2-3- HOO!"" ""Power. Up. Now!"" Since calling is essentially a lot of counting from one to ten, it rather sounds like I can't remember my first grade arithmatic. Which, technically, I can't, but nobody else needs to know that."

"event","<p>Things are getting missed.&nbsp;I somehow sent a rent check that wasn't filled out properly - how did I not fill out the entire check? We have no food in the house. It's a miracle I've remembered to do the cat boxes. <br /><br />A coworker explained her view of introversion/extroversion at the staff luncheon last week as ""extroverts are energized by being with people, introverts are drained."" I rather like this explanation, because it reflects more about how social interaction makes a person feel and respond, rather than simply ""extroverts are outgoing and have lots of friends, introverts are quiet and have no friends."" I like parties. I like social situations. I've been quite lonely with Craig spending so much time at the architecture studio.&nbsp;<br /><br />I'm keeping busy. On the move, busy is active, busy is involved and engaged, busy is fulfilling. Busy hints at an intricate social network.</p><div class=""ljcut"" text=""I am absolutely drained."">Over the past few weeks, I have tried extremely hard to meet more people in Portland and make new friends. Operation Bring All Good Friends to Portland has failed spectacularly, thus I have to do better here in town. But meeting new people in a social setting larger than one or two people involves an incredible amount of concentration for me. I feel&nbsp;most confident&nbsp;when I've had an hour or two to myself beforehand to mentally prepare, including at least one alcoholic beverage, to leave an escape plan open in case the situation becomes too much for me (I try to keep near a bus line or have my bike), and (unfortunately) <em>three straight days</em> of post-game analysis.&nbsp;I am not relaxed. I am hyper-alert, completely focused on phrases like ""good impression"" and ""clever, damn you, be clever!""<br /><br />Friday night, I played kickball with new politico friends-of-friends. One of them made a sexist and snobby comment about my line of work, pretending to be talking about ""everyone else, not me,"" and I called him on it. And beat feet out of there. While I'm quite proud I finally had the stones to actually <em>stand up to a jackass,&nbsp;</em>I spent a good few hours analyzing to ensure I wasn't over-reacting, In A Snit about said jackass, and wanting to go home and never try to meet new people (or play kickball)&nbsp;again because they are inevitably all jackasses.<em>&nbsp;<br /><br /></em>The Starlight Run was <em>hard</em>. 2,500 runners means 2,000 people flooding behind you, and if you don't run fast enough, you'll get run over. Not unlike the running of the bulls. They swept me into a pace much faster than I was training at, and I had a side stitch the entire time. Forget running the entire time, I could barely <em>breathe</em> the entire time. There were people everywhere, and another 150,000 on the sidelines watching. The rest of the night was spent navigating two groups of friends into a Plan for Hanging Out, which really should not have been as complicated as it was.&nbsp;<br /><br />More dragon boat practice last night. Calling on my own, learning by doing, practice is the only way to learn in this situation. I am going to direct their paddling&nbsp;efforts in a huge, 9-boat race in another damn country (should I blame Canada?), after practicing calling for one week. 22 new people, all depending on my directions. They are going to lose because of me, I just know it. I can't get the timing right, I don't have enough experience on the boat to feel when the back is moving faster than the front, they tricked me into a faster rhythm when I should have held them steady, and I'm still not loud enough.&nbsp;Everyone is fantastic and encouraging, and they don't seem to expect a miracle. But their regular&nbsp;caller&nbsp;is fantastic.&nbsp;I'm a crap pinch hitter.<br /><br />It will be fine. Deep, calming breaths.<br /></div>"

No costumes in the above picture, but lots of runners were dressed up: a family of Incredibles, a lobster in a pot, an abundance of pirates, girls running in wedding dresses, girls running in swimming flippers (amazingly, she didn't fall!), a man wearing a soccer ball and little else. The kids were particularly jazzed about the man in the Spiderman costume. There was a wheelchair-bound father who built a race car casing for his electric wheelchair, while his 6-year-old son ran alongside. I didn't run as well as I would have liked - the parade route has quite a few hills, and I had a side stitch almost the entire time. But still! I did it! This picture was at the finish line, the race began and ended at a high school just off of the parade route.<br /><br />I also spent yesterday morning learning how to 'call' for a dragon boat team. They need a replacement caller for a race weekend in Vancouver, Canada. If I can get the Friday afternoon off, I'm in!

"event","Whoops. Lost two weeks there. I can blame half of it on the alien cold that wouldn't quit (I've gone through three boxes of Kleenex at work this week. No joke).&nbsp; But really, I have a hard time convincing myself to write journal entries about activities when I don't have pictures to back them up - ends up feeling like a laundry list.&nbsp; But alas, I have no deep thoughts to share, and&nbsp;no pictures of the awesome places I've been lately. I will definitely be going back to almost all of them, so next time.<br /><br />Anyway. Here's a laundry list of what I've been up to!<br /><br /><div class=""ljcut"">- Cold. Sniffle, sniffle, hack.<br /><br />- Knitting! I finished seaming my very first sweater last weekend. Still need to get Craig to take some pictures. Also, half of a cabled hat completed, working on the strap of a new tote bag, turned the heel of the second sock at work.<br /><br />- I finally overcame a childhood fear: David Bowie. Goblin King. My second-grade class was permitted to watch Labryinth one day during classtime...I was terrified and left the classroom within ten minutes. Watching it last night reaffirmed a universal truth: Muppets CAN DO NO WRONG, and damn, if I had made it through the beginning of the movie, there is NO WAY I could have handled the dancing incomprehensible&nbsp;muppets throwing heads at each other. Scary! <br /><br />-&nbsp;Finally started running again yesterday, after last week's cold-and-flu-reprieve. I made it to a mile, and then congestion prevented further breathing. The&nbsp;Starlight Run is in two weeks - must train, must train!<br /><br />- I've volunteered to be on the start boat for the Dragon Boats&nbsp;races at the Rose Festival. More on that in June.<br /><br />- MAJOR happy hour hopping over the weekend. Tasted my first Earl Gray martini at Vault,&nbsp; St Cupcakes (delicious cream cheese frosting),&nbsp;Tugboat beer,&nbsp;whiskey at the Cellar Annex, the 36th floor of the Pink Building for Portland City Grill. Half carafe of wine and three baskets of bread for dinner on Monday. <br /><br />- Mission Street Theater for Pans Labryinth (so beautiful! So sad!). Mission Street is owed by a local brewing company, so they have their beer, soup, sandwiches, burgers, etc., all on the menu which they bring to you while you're watching the movie. Pitcher of Ruby, turkey sandwich and chili? And a $3 movie? Seriously awesome.<br /><br />- Day hike at Tyron State Park. I love that it's now light and warm enough outside to go for a hike after work. Drive 15 minutes, and suddenly you're in lush, green, secluded-feeling nature.<br /><br />- <a href=""http://www.voodoodoughnut.com/"">http://www.voodoodoughnut.com/</a>&nbsp;- The most amazing doughnut place on earth.<br /></div><br />I also watched an Eastern-European Very Good Looking Man in a bowler hat swallow an entire balloon at the Saturday Market.

In an attempt to find out, first-hand,&nbsp;what&nbsp;jogging (read: walking)&nbsp;10 miles feels like, Julie and I cruised the Springwater Corridor to view the Giant Osprey Nest and avoid being run over by&nbsp;Grumpy Biker Man (who biked back and forth across this 3 mile stretch along the river at least&nbsp;three or&nbsp;four times, red-faced, screaming at small&nbsp;children to get out of his way). 

I forgot sunscreen. It was overcast, but not so much cloudy, and now I have a bona-fide red neck. Also, red face and red collarbone.&nbsp;I keep meaning to take pictures. Behold! How very much I am in kinship with the lobsters. 

Actually, I am beginning to believe my true totem animal is a lobster. Red when boiled. Googly-eyed. Can resort to cannibalism when in captivity. Protective&nbsp;fuck-off claws.&nbsp;Moseys slowly along the ocean floor. Delicious with butter. Much, much cuter than a crab.&nbsp;

Also! The nice weather has returned! Hooroo! It is skirt and sunglasses here, finally. 80 degrees outside...and of course, my office is an ice box. Sigh. The temperature here is never, ever comfortable. By August I'm going to be wearing sweaters to work again. And then in December, well, the heat doesn't work that well anyway, so."

My wrists have been steadily improving over the last few months. I use wrist guards when typing at work, but I can operate the home computer, knit (even on teeny size 1 needles), ride my bike, wash dishes, and drive my car without being laid up for several hours thereafter. This is an amazing, amazing thing.&nbsp;Just about the only thing I can't do now is lift heavy boxes or do too much yoga. Or knit for six hours with cotton yarn.&nbsp;

Still. Most of these activities can't be sustained for very long, and it's aggravating to constantly be limited. I'm ready to be well now, damn it. It's been ten months since the injury. I sure would like to try a cartwheel. Or throwing a baseball. Sigh.

I finally procured a copy of The Last Emperor - WHY this brilliant film is out of print in the US is beyond me. The movie is only from 1987. It won 9 Academy Awards. It is brilliant and sad and incredibly beautiful. It was filmed on location inside the Forbidden City.&nbsp;It has Peter O'Toole. It's in English. So why did I have to purchase it from Korea? Craig and I have been watching it in nightly installments (given that it's four hours long), and I am revelling in his very presence. Mine eyes becometh googlyeth. He had a large architecture project due Monday, and spent every night last week and over the weekend at the studio.&nbsp;So it's been rather nice having his company the past few nights. Saved me from watching West Wing reruns and eating Annie's Mac and Cheese straight from the pot.

Zounds! Portland is scolding me with a reminder that May 1 does not equal ""summer,"" and I am being punished for the blashphemy. It's been hailing, raining, and then chilled, clean, and sunny... then back to hailing, for two odd days. This parallels my mood entirely. I can appreciate the rain, I ought to, I live in Portland, but I am so much more cheerful, and excitable, and energetic, when the sun is out. Blah. I spend my winters waiting for summers."

The runners wear costumes, small children waiting for the parade give you high-fives (I am told by reliable sources), and I get to say I ran that much for the first time in my life. Sweet. I've got a month and a half to do it. This is initial training for the incredibly, incredibly stupid idea of running 27 miles in the Portland marathon in the fall. Sweet baby Jeebus.<br /> <br /> The route I'm running is along the Esplanade, the gorgeous paved walk along both sides of the Willamette River - the West Side bank is lined with a park and trees, and the East Side goes down to water level on a dock with fisherman. I cross two bridges (Steel and Hawthorne), which is one of the things I love most about Portland - crossing bridges, every day! The whole run is 3 miles, and there are Canadian geese, cute doggies, and river water the entire way. Much more inspiring than any other place I've tried to run.<br /><br />I'm also waiting to hear if there's a space for another woman on a dragon boat team in June.

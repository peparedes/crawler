"event","Every once in a while a game will come along that challenges the eye, and tantalizes the consumer with promises of bounty, grace, and originality. It doesn't happen very often, but back in the golden age of gaming, this was a regular occurrence. Bear witness to any of Squaresoft's efforts on the SNES and original Playstation, or any of the latter Zelda games.

Ardent Sony fans will recall that one of the earlier titles released to the newborn PS2 in late 2001 was a title called Ico. While the gameplay was decidedly simple for a game running on a system that could do so much more, the game itself was beauty redefined. The design aesthetic took off in new directions for this game, and while the actual graphics were almost as simple as the gameplay, the quiet ambience generated by the lighting, architecture, and overall ""feel"" of the game made it seem like it was crafted to fit the world, rather than generate a gameplay experience. It attempted to elevate video games into a higher categorization than what traditional rationale would allow.

And it succeeded. 

Enter Sony's next effort, Shadow of the Colossus, stage whichver-it-damn-well-feels-like.

Playing up on the biblical story of David's triumph over Goliath, the game casts the player as a warrior named Wander, and his battles against various colossi. The deal here is that if Wander defeats each distinct colossus in battle, he is one step closer to bringing his deceased girlfriend, Mono, back to life.

Wander and Mono's backstory is never revealed, nor are the circumstances of Mono's apparent death. What the player does know at the beginning, and by the end, is that Wander's love for Mono is so strong that he is willing to do battle with 16 different mythical giants in order to bring her back. To be quite honest, no backstory is necessary, as this simple approach to the fairy-tale, utopian love story only bolsters the effect. You don't press on because you know Wander's story, you do it because you can relate to Wander's desire to see his true love alive again.

Words can't describe how beautiful this game is, graphically, and aurally. I could go on about the gorgeous fog effects (never thought I'd EVER say that about a video game, as anyone growing up with the N64 and it's horrible pop-up issues can attest), and how they add a sense of mystery to the situation, or I can talk at length about the little details, like the sand storms that form in the arid desert environments, or how sunlight will erupt between the tree fronds in the forest setting, or the shimmering water on the walls of the castle . . . but it would all be worthless to do so. This game is rich, elegant, and graceful in it's simplicity. There are no complex archtechtual works of art here, nothing of Final Fantasy's caliber, but what we do have is something so easy to look at that it hurts the soul to think that something like this could exist in video game form (and that's not an insult, either). Movement in still life, poetry in motion, this game is heaven for the eyes . . . 

The Colossi are interesting, too. Designed to look ornate, and modern at the same time, these kingly beings are your quarry, and must be taken out with extreme prejudice. Sometimes, the solution to their demise is simple (climb his ass hair and stab him in the face), but others will challenge you with their complexity. And just as the game environment bleeds beauty, so too, do the Colossi. With forms ranging from humanoid, to avian, there is never any dullness, and each battle is fast paced, and usually ends with the player stabbing them in the face, or other area. 

What really struck me was the ending. I really don't want to spoil anything, but I will say that Shadow of the Colossus had one of the best endings I have ever seen in a video game, comparable to Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater, and Final Fantasy IX.

In any event, March will see the release of Kingdom Hearts 2, so I am looking forward to that . . .

"event","Thievery . . . 

Upon walking into 7-Eleven for my shift last week, I was greeted by an irate (manager), who sat (co-worker) and I down to have a long discussion about recent events. He recounted how, over the course of December, in excess of $6000 worth of cigarettes and other tobacco related paraphernalia ""vanished"". We, of course, attributed this to thievery, as, in these kind of scenario(e)s (""scenarii?""), it is always best to assume the worst. Our pessimism was rewarded, however, as the past week, two of the thieves were apprehended, and two employees involved were fired upon review of the evidence.

It should be noted that the two employees were not terribly good people to begin with. One of them was a rude, conceited, emasculating (and possibly STD-ridden) she-whore, while the other was a shady, perpetually drug-addled teenager. While the latter was a nice person to be around, he generally did little to no work around the store. On the other hand, the former was just a detestable person all around. Our manager cited ""issues with being constantly late"" (indeed, she did display attributes such as being absolutely bereft of chronological consideration).

The male employee was known for taking store DVD's home for personal use, and this is probably why he was fired. I'm not entirely certain if he brought them all back after viewing them, but it is a safe assumption for one to say that he didn't, if the whole situation resulted in his termination.

In any event, the situation is hopefully resolved by the end of the week. With the recent staff turnover, maybe our store supervisor won't fire everyone off and start over like he was planning to.

"event","The Christmas season has come and gone. As I have written about my feelings for the yuletide season in a previous entry, I will not reiterate them. However, it goes without saying that my antipathy for what Christmas has become, has become absolutely unyielding, as opposed to simply reluctantly tolerant.

In it's wake, we are given January, which, of course, means a new year for me to found dreams upon a broken crag, never to become manifest in physical form. I think this is true for everyone. I have yet to meet a person who has actually quit smoking as an annual personal goal.

While it is true that I am saving for an RX-7, it is also doubly true that my boiling blood thirsts for video games, to sustain its passionate fire for the medium. Similarly, with the recent release of the MSiA Extended Zeta Gundam, and other robots from my beloved Tominoish universe, my toy collecting spirit has not, in fact, been dulled, but rather, lied dormant, in hopes that it will rise again in a passionate fury of toy loving, er, love.

Such is my mania . . . 

Christmas was good this year, I suppose. Gift-wise (many people will erreonously tell you that it is the gifts that do not matter), I got clothes, and also money. I am not complaining. As one who does not normally shop for myself (Amy and Kristin can attest to this, as in the past, I have requested they come along with me, so I can get a female's opinion) this was greatly appreciated. It has always turned out nicely, these past trips of ours.

I did spend an inordinate amount of money on my friends, but this is normal of what is expected of the holiday season. As anyone can tell you, Christmas is all about getting gifts for your friends that are more expensive than the ones they give you, in an attempt to appear financially superior. This is almost never deviated from.

I should mention that I did end up working both Christmas day and New Years eve, which afforded me a great deal of money earned on both nights (We received 3x pay for X-mas, and double for New year's). Both nights were exhaustive, but for different reasons. Christmas night was absolutely dead. We had about 20 people in the space of about 8 hours. Not surprising, and it gave us time to give the store a complete overhaul. Not a single thing in the store that night was tarnished with dust. We scrubbed everything. Looking back, it is amazing how much we accomplished. Such exhaustive janitorial duties left me depleted to the point of falling over, but the cool air was refreshing once I stepped into it at around 7:30.

But then New Years rolled around and decimated us with an onslaught of drunken idiots. At any given time we had about 30 people in the store. I estimate our losses (from theft) totaled around $400. As good as I am at picking out shoplifters, it is impossible to do so when greeted with a throng totaling more than 25 people. This, of course, meant that I had no time to clean (in complete contrast to Christmas night), and no time for stocking, or what have you. It was like Monday morning rush, only twice as busy, and with the rush lasting roughly the whole night. It was crazy.

And with that, I am off to bed . . .

"event","It's amazing, isn't it? Not even two years ago, I wasn't interested in cars, but after my induction into the fast-paced world of Initial D, it is all I can think about. And after spending countless months fantasizing about driving a hopped up RX-7 FC3S Infini, my dream is about to be realised.

Almost.

While I can't quite afford the Infini model (the rare Japanese-only type used by Ryosuke in the aforementioned anime), I was able to find a street tuned RX-7 for sale, cheap. Naturally, I am suspicious of the low cost, but I will look into it, and if it is legit, then I'm going to devote my resources to purchasing it. Of course, since I can't drive yet, all I can hope to do is park it in the damn garage until such time that I can roll with it.

I have it planned out. The vehicle itself has a bit of rust on it. No big deal. I took automechanics in High school, and remember a bit of body restoration. If it becomes a bit too much, there are plenty of resources to help me out. Books, the internet, maybe some of my car freak friends . . .

My biggest concern, ironically, is that I might not be able to control myself once I get the car. I've watched (and played) far too much Initial D, and sadly, I am impressionable. I think that, without restriction, my first attempt at a drift will end disasterously, resulting in the deaths of at least four people, with the injury count being much higher (not that I plan to do it in a crowded area, but with my luck, you never know who might just happen to be there when I do it.

As far as the car itself goes, I'm going to look into buying the Infini's model rear lights, as well as it's badge, and also the rear spoiler (which is small and humble, none of this giant, ridiculous ricer garbage I see so much of nowadays). I'll need to finish consulting with the proprietors of www.takumiproject.com, to see how much a pair of black Watanabe RS rims will cost. Not only that, but I also want to install heated leather seats, and a moderate stereo to blast my Initial D music to. I'll also need to get the suspension tightened and the car lowered (improves handling), and maybe a stage 1 Turbo (really all I need), or maybe a supercharger. The blow-off valve is also desirable for that cool as hell ""PSSHT"" sound every time I shift gears. Finally, the crown jewel will be the Fujita front spoiler, imported directly from Japan.

All told, this car will take a couple years to complete, but it is a project I am looking forward to.

Giving up my hobbies such as gaming and Gundam model kits is one of the sacrifices I will have to make, and easily the biggest sacrifice of my life.

When completed, she (yes, ""She"". All import cars, save for the Supra, 300ZX, Lancers and maybe GTO's are female. FC is just too elegant to be masculine) will be a wonder to behold.

"event","Yeah, after all this time playing the game since its release sometime in 2002, I've finally beaten Kingdom Hearts (I'm a little behind the times. I haven't even finished Vagrant Story, goddammit!). I have to admit that the ending caught me off guard. For such an bright, cheery and child-friendly game as it is, the ending was rather somber and quietly morose. The final shot of Kairi, kneeling down in the cavern, looking at the pictures she made on the wall with Sora, with tears in her eyes, made me die a thousand deaths inside, and the slow version of ""Simple and Clean"" fit the ending like no other song could, and sung in context is depressing on a level only reached before by Zone of the Ender's ""Flowing Destiny"", Fatal Frame 2: Crimson Butterfly's ""Chou"", or any of the vocal tracks from XenoGears/Saga. I really thought (and hoped, nay, expected) everything would end on a happier note.

The end credits were absolutely amazing. While the credits roll by, we're shown photo-album style shots of many key moments of the game, and soon flash to little mini-cinemas depicting epilogues featuring many of Final Fantasy's recurring cast. In particular, seeing Cloud reunited with Aeris was heartwarming, but I really wish they had extended upon that. All in all, everything about this game and what it stood for was nostalgic. Seeing classic Disney characters reunited along side new characters created specifically for the game, greeting our favorite Final Fantasy characters one last time before they are never seen again along with touching scenarios that fans were too afraid to ask for, but always wanted anyways is such a huge draw for this game.

One of my main gripes with Kingdom Hearts was that it featured the cast of FFVII, VIII, and X, which was all well and fine (of those three titles, I only liked 7), but I'd really hoped to see characters from FFIV, VI, and IX make it in. But as Kingdom Hearts was a project fronted by Tetsuya Nomura himself (character designer of FFVII, VII, and X, as well as the co-writer of FFVII's script), I kinda doubted that we would. It'd be awesome to see, though. How are Rosa and Cecil faring? Locke and Celes? I really would like to have seen Freya and Steiner, Dagger and Zidane one last time, too. Maybe seeing characters from other Square titles. Aya Brea and Maeda (Parasite Eve) would be awesome, and Ashely Riot (Vagrant Story) would absolutely kick ass. How about seeing Fei and Elly (Xenogears) one last time? I really miss those two. And how about Crono, Marle, or Serge and Kid? There are so many possibilities, and it would diversify things quite a bit to have these characters make return appearances. I think it'd also increase sales of the game. Maybe we can hope for something like this in Kingdom Hearts 2, which is just around the corner?

Speaking of which, because I completed every single sidequest (minus beating Sephiroth. Fucker is a goddamn wrecking machine), I was privy to the ultra cool secret FMV that plays after the end credits, which seems to be nothing less than a teaser for Kingdom Hearts 2. But given that Kingdom Heart's screenshots seem to have the familiar air of frivolity and the viscerally chaotic fight scenes that the first one was known for, I doubt that the atmosphere of the teaser remained intact. It'd be awesome, though. Seeing a Kingdom Hearts sidestory that has a totally different atmosphere than the main games did, one of darkness and depression, where the landscape is ruled by darks with patches of light to heighten the sense of wonderous forboding and menace.

So now I'm done with Kingdom Hearts. Am I keeping the game? Oh, hell yes. One of those games I just can't bring myself to get rid of. But what is next on the list of games to play?

 - Suikoden series (Assuming I can fucking find Suiko 2)
 - Racing Lagoon (Japanese release racing/RPG hybrid, the first/only of its kind)
 - Tear Ring Saga (If I can pry myself away from Suikoden Tactics, that is)
 - Fatal Frame 3 (You know, I have had this title for about 3 weeks now and still havent' gotten very far)
 - Dragon Quest VIII (Game looks absolutely amazing)
 - Rogue Galaxy (From the makers of DQVIII)

When will I have time?!

Until then, I will bide my time waiting for my copy of the Wangan Midnight OST to arrive in the mail . . .

Working overtime, at a frantic pace, trying to get coffee going for our customers, while trying to balance my till, and lottery counts all at once has that effect on me that is beautiful in its irony. And when the shift is over, and you step into the frigid winter air of Calgary, after sitting next to a hot grill all day, and you're greeted with a beautiful sunrise reflected off of the high-rise buildings downtown, it becomes an almost celestial experience. The clouds, subtly masking the suns rays, with bits of shine erupting between gaps, burn bright orange, like hot coals on a barbecue, and the way the clouds are smeared make it all look like the most beautiful watercolour painting you've ever seen. It is very picturesque.

Because of the long weekend, we got paid today, which means I get to take care of a few debts. Perhaps if I have the time, I will go down to Trader and pick up MGS2: Substance, and Soul Calibur III.

Oh, that reminds me. To any of my Calgary-based friends. I am desperately seeking a good condition copy of Suikoden 2 for PSX. If you or someone you know is looking to get rid of it, phone me up, or email me so we can arrange something. I will pay big dollars for it, and am willing to barter!

"event","Hockey night is back, and you know what that means. More drunks, stoners, and other forms of social dregs that I do so love dealing with. My God, they don't stop. I can't imagine what kind of desperate straits would drive a (wo)man to hammer him/herself until the wee hours of the morning for the simple celebration of his/her favorite sport. I love anime and you don't see me going, ""WOO!! Anime! ROCK ON!"" before taking another swig of hard liquour. It is mind boggling.

The stoners at this time of year are resoundingly retarded. We had one guy come in so whacked off his rocker that he came up to me and tried striking up a conversation about how squirrels avoid fruit and nut taxation by hoarding them in trees. Even now, I'm at a loss of words to describe how mystified I was at his unorthodox expression of thought (if it can be called that. ""Thought"", as a word, is usually meant to describe intelligent mental reflection on an equally intelligent subject. The word can't possibly be used to describe someone's acid induced ramblings).

Ever since making my Cappuccino in Initial D, progress has been slow. I've been able to master Irohazaka (braking is a wonderful thing, really), and since then, I've gone on to make various other cars I didn't have the guts to before. Cars like the BNR34 Skyline (which actually sucks, despite popular opinion), or the much loved (and deservedly so) BNR32 Skyline, which is infinitely better than its successor. I experimented with the Lancer Evolution III and IV, but found the IV much to my liking. There is no doubt that the Evo III looks better, but there is something about the performance of the Evo IV that tips the scales in it's favour. Engine-wise, they are the same, the turning radius is the same. They are both 4 wheel drive vehicles, so handling in different conditions is great for each. Something very odd indeed.

There isn't much else worth commenting about in my life, aside from the random drunken idiots we get in 7-11 at night time, so updates from now on will be invariably limited in scope (as well as frequency). Only when there is a good anime/soundtrack/model kit (or whatever worth reviewing) that comes out will my usual cycle be broken.

"event","It's been a while since I've updated this blasted thing. Where to start?

Finally having picked up a PS2, I've been running around like crazy picking up all the games I wanted to get around to beating, but never really had the chance. Games like the Metal Gear series made for PS2, Beyond Good and Evil (which is woefully underrated), Silent Hill 2, and whatnot. It's kind of sad of me to be doing this, because between my large collection of Gundam related merchandise and other shit cluttering up my shelves, I have very little room to put anything now. I need a damn CD rack.

Cleaning my room the other day. It's truly amazing what you find if you don't clean up for a while, then resume such custodial activites. Things like the other half of my CD collection (put together, anime music makes up more than 75%, with a small emphasis on games. Then the other, like, 22% is stuff I just picked up on a whime in high school). Techno CD's (all but one of which are disappointing). I really need to sell some of my shit.

7-11 has me working night shifts. Dealing with customers during the timeframe of 11:00pm to 7:00am requires a very different mindset. I'm always tired too, because I'm still changing gears. Customers come in drunk, stoned, sometimes both, and the results range from being hilarious to downright scary. Typically, we get people coming in and trying to strike up an unusual conversation, but I tend to ignore these kind of people. The very last thing I need at, like, 2:00 in the goddamn morning is some drunk fuck telling me how long his penis is (true story). Not like he came out and said it outright, but he did ask how large our ""biggest fuckin' hot dogs"" were. I told him that they clocked in at around 12 inches (and also mentioned that we get them in very rarely), and then he said, ""beats mine by about 8 inches"". Do the math, and then shake your head.

Sometimes people aren't stoned, or drunk, but are just assholes. I remember this one man who came in on my second night shift, and asked for two taquitos. I asked him what kind he wanted, but he said I was being lippy. When the transaction was complete, I wished him a good night, but his only response was a mumbled ""Fuck yourself"". After careful consideration of his request, I had to decline. Manual manipulation of ones genitals on store property is kind of frowned upon. I can't be sure, but I think this man was the same guy from about a month back who tried to hand us a counterfeit $20 bill.

Fuck. It's already 3:00 in the damn morning. I'm totally going to bed.

"event","Today was a fun day. Having just recieved my paycheck ($497 for those wondering. Yeah, me and my low paying job. And at least I'm not sucking dicks in the bathroom of McDonalds), I decided that it'd be fun to head down to Eau Claire, brush up on DDR and Initial D (both of which I haven't touched for the longest time).

It was amazing. The Suzuki Cappuccino, the much maligned car from 4th stage is a fucking monster when used correctly. It's stock horsepower is an estimated 85, but it handles like . . . like nothing else! This is most likely due to it's small size (it is literally half the size of a Trueno 86. I'm not kidding). I'm not sure if I'm even close to maxxing my Cappuccino out, but my Custom Option C is complete, which must mean something. 

To give you an idea of how good this machine is, let's use the course Irohazaka as an example. Normally, this course is far above my ability. On a five star ranking system, it'd be a fucking 6 (I can't even do Akina!) But with this car, I can even do Irohazaka. Not that the car is rigged or anything (it has a blisteringly slow max speed). I was even able to beat Ryosuke in LOTS mode, which is friggin' hard to do. I don't think I'd have been able to do it if I'd been in my RX-8, or Trueno.

Also, a couple of weeks back, Roland lent me Parasite Eve, and I've finally beaten it. Is it a good game? The answer is a resounding YES! The weapon/armour tune-up system is an amazing feature that allows you to totally customize your weapon. Let's say you have a handgun, but want it to have the same amount of firepower as a shotgun. All it takes is a ""tool"" item (which are readily available throughout the game), and a Shotgun, and you can mod it. But the downside is that after modding, the weapon you took the desired attribute from disappears forever. Not only that, but for it's time, the CG used in the game was equaled BY NONE. And even today, it holds up rather well. 

Aya Brea is so sexy, too. She has this doe-eyed innocence in her eyes that was later seen in the eyes of the DOA females. Not only that, but there's this whole ""girl next door"" atmosphere about her that draws me to her. If she were real, I'd be all like, ""Yoo hoo, Ms. Brea, is it time for your ""oil change"" yet?""

Sadly, the game has a couple of faults. First of all, the game's length is short. We're talking about an endeavour that lasts about 4 hours, thereby negating my use of the term ""Endeavour"". It's more of a ""Merry Jaunt"". Secondly, I don't know what kind of clothes she wears, but they must be made out of fucking lead for her to move so slowly. You thought Master Chief was slow? Play Parasite Eve for awhile, to get used to the speed, then go pop in FFIX, and watch in awe as Zidane clears a fucking room in the same amount of time it takes to access the menu in PE. You will be stunned.

All told, though, this game is pure Square magic, through and through. Can't wait to play PE 2

"event","Today was particularily depressing. Kristin approached me at the bus stop on my way home from school, and tried to make conversation. I wasn't prepared for it, needless to say. At a loss for words, I stumbled over my words, until I was able to tell her firmly, but as politely as I could, that I wanted nothing more to do with her. The story between her and I has been told, and I don't want to go through anything with her ever again. I don't see why she keeps trying.

Just seeing her rocks me to my core. I look into her eyes, and see a creature that is so above me in every respect, that I put on a show of self-importance and try to dismiss her, despite her gentle urgings to start conversation. It's done all out of feelings of inadequacy. I feel especially bad for that.

It's also a bit confusing for me, even after so long. It's like racing someone on a long stretch of highway, straight as an arrow. You can see her in the distance, but your car lacks the power to catch up. Nevertheless, you are able to keep a consistent distance from her, and you hope desperately that she slows down. But then a lot of turns come up on the road, and you can't quite make it through the turns fast enough. As a result, you lose sight of her, and you're left with feelings that you can't quite explain.

Her birthday is coming up soon, too. On the 13th, I believe.

I picked up my first Gundam Fix Figuration figure today, from Redd Skull. Well, actually, I beseeched Nigel to pick it up for me. I wish I could've been there to see the girl that works there again.

Memories of St. Francis come flooding back to me, and I can never let go of them. Nigel has said before that my main problem is that I live in the past (one look at my shelf, stacked with old magazines, and action figures from the 80's . . . Caylin calls it clutter. I call it history), and with everything that's happened in the past few years, it's not hard to see why I prefer the past to what's happening now. 

Ever since my father died, things have been goig downhill. I swear to God that my mother is losing her sanity. Why else would she use Dad's retirement funds for renovating the house? It's gotten really bad. We no longer have a floor in the kitchen, and there's talk of her replacing every carpet in the house. This is good news for the other people in the house (Riley's carpet, in particular, is dreadful), but it creates problems for me. In order for us to do anything in my room, everything must go. My models, furniture, appliances, everything. Normally, this wouldn't be such a big deal, but the fact that my mother hasn't determined where she's going to fit everything while my room is retrofitted with the latest carpetry fills me with unease. 

I had to move all of my MG model kits. Taking a long hard look at my MG Master Gundam model kit, I've decided to throw it out. I have no qualms about this. The model was a horrible build, and didn't even look that great compared to other MG's. Even my extensive customization couldn't save it from being far below mediocre. 

On the other hand, my MG Shining Gundam (which was in a similar state of disrepair) was about to suffer a similar fate. But as I was tossing it out, I looked up at my MG Gundam Spiegal, and was struck with a brilliant idea. While the skeletal frames for the Shining and Spiegal were the same (which certainly helped in reconstructing the Shining's frame), the connector pins that allowed the outer armor to connect to the fram were in different locations. This required considerable sanding and puttying before they were in the correct place. This allowed me to use the Gundam Spiegal's inner frame, and attach the outer armour of the Shining Gundam. The result is a slightly taller Shining Gundam. The only sacrifice was that I had to discard my MG Gundam Spiegal, but it's no worry. It wasn't that good of a model either. So thankfully, Shining Gundam was spared a fate as bad as death, which would've been unfortunate, as the Shining's design is definitely one of my favorite AU Gundam designs.

"event","I worked again at the Drop-In center today, and was able to get acquainted with one of my co-workers, a sweet asian girl by the name of Johanna. She's really nice, and easy to talk to (kinda reminded me of Kristin, in other ways). 

The homeless shelter isn't as bad as I thought it would be. The hobo's are very nice (there are exceptions, of course) and only on the very rare occasion will any of them give you trouble. In fact, the only one who ever did was one woman, who had wrapped herself up in a sleeping bag, and hid under a table. When asked to remove herself from the floor, she yelled, ""Fuck you"", and that was pretty much the worst of it. 

The hobos themselves are easily identifiable, too. I initially thought it'd be hard to tell them apart, but it turns out that it's rather easy. Though I don't know them by name, I can identify them by mannerisms, or at the very least, by jacket.

For instance, one man, who I call Mumbly Joe (taken from a nickname made up by Nigel's brother, Evan), is always mumbling, and when he's not mumbling, he's either swearing loudly, or sleeping. He even mumbles when he's eating. It's hilarious!

There's also Coatse (kind of a spinoff of Goatse), who demanded we give him a big coat, so he could go outside, and not have his wang fall off while he relieved himself in the bitter cold. Of course, we couldn't comply with his request, and he ended up calling everyone whos passed by him an asshole. He's identifiable by the black jacket he wears, with neon green strips around the arms.

Then there's Crackwhore, the girl I mentioned earlier, who is addicted to cocaine (as I've been told by the higher ups).

Finally, there's Twitch, named for his cocaine, and/or crack induced twitching. He freaks everyone out. Because of the unpredictable nature of coke addicts, you can never really tell what he's gonna do next. I was scared every time I walked by him. At one point, he was content with doing his laundry (we've got some washers and dryers so hobo's can wash their cloths, if they so wish), and the next minute, he'll be swearing at some guy at the other end of the room, and kicking things. Not pleasant.

And there are at least 400 more homeless people in the building at any given time. I feel really bad for each and every one of them, but aside from cleaning up, and serving dinner, I can't do a damn thing for any of them. I feel so useless . . . 

In any event, one of the first things that one realizes while toiling away in an establishment such as the Drop-In Center, is that doing a quality clean up job is impossible, and the idea itself, impractical. I mean, you're surrounded by the dirtiest people in the city.

If it's not candy wrappers, or cigarrete butts, it's something else.  You can sweep the entire floor of the establishment, but somewhere, on the opposite side, another hobo will discard a piece of rotten fruit, or whipe some detritus from his/her coat and/or facial hair, which is always abundant. Yes, even the women sport a fine 'stache here and there, and the sight is always an unnerving one.

Another thing I noticed was the overabundance of discarded Rice Krispy Square wrappers. I don't know if they've been beating children for their lunches, or shoplifted from a 7-11 or something. 

Also, some of the homeless people were in possession of items you'd never think they'd have access to. Things like discmans, or cell phones (I don't even have a cell phone!). I even saw one with a GBA SP, much to my surprise. He was playing Shining Soul II. I could tell by the music.  One of them actually managed to smuggle in a ferret, which was passed around the table like a bong at a frat party. Even books, which would probably be hard for a homeless man to aquire, seem to be a popular carry-around item. You wouldn't believe the amount of Holy Bibles I see around here. It's like each hobo has one (I can hardly blame them. In the troubling times they face everyday, they probably could use a little spiritual guidance). Aside from the omnipresent Bible, the diversity of the books is staggering. I've seen everything from Stephen King, to Baldur's Gate, to comic strip compilations (almost a classification in it's own right), to horror, to fantasy, and everything in between. It's like a fucking library.

All told, it is really depressing to work there, although the feeling I get while I'm helping out is a warm one. 

There are other reasons why I'm depressed tonight, but . . .

"event","God bless the fine option program. Instead of having to pay $150 for ""invalid fare payment"", I have the option of working it off, doing community service. The only establishment where I can easily get to in this weather is the drop in center, located just outside of Bridgeland, and on the outskirts of downtown.

Not a bad place, I guess. We'll see how it goes.

It's Friday today, which means that the weekend is nigh. I can't wait until Monday, so I can get back to searching for a job (it's never a good idea to search on Wednesdays to Sundays, for reasons that ought to be obvious).

Resident Evil 4 was recently released. I'm not usually big on the RE games (save for the Gamecube remake of the original), but I've heard amazing things about this game, and it makes me want to try it. Apparently, the game is faster paced than previous entries in the series. Also, there are no zombies to speak of. Instead, protagonist Leon Kennedy (now a Gov't agent. A huge step up from his role as a rookie police officer in Resident Evil 2) must fend off the surly advances of a group of crazed hicks, who may or may not be undead. While this may sound corny to some, I think it actually fits rather well (especially when one looks at the screenshots). Apparently, the player is kept on their toes a lot, which means there's less backtracking, less (illogical) puzzles (thank God), and a bigger emphasis on survival. 

It's currently on my list of games that I must get around to playing. The list itself is getting kinda big:

- KOTOR (Xbox)
- KOTOR 2(Xbox)
- Doom 3 (PC)
- Resident Evil 4 (Gamecube)
- Final Fantasy: Dawn of Souls (GBA)
- Tales of Rebirth (just because) (Can't remember . . . )
- Ridge Racers (PSP)
- Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater (PS2)
- Metal Gear Ac!d (PSP)
- Metroid: Zero Mission (GBA)
- L.A. Rush (PS2)
- Gundam: Encounters in Space (PS2)

In other news, Mom recently bought a new dishwasher. This was long overdue. Our current one is a relic from, like, the 1800's. Well, not that old, but it came with the house when we moved in. I estimate it to be roughly 30 years old. It still runs good, but it occasionally leaks water all over the place, which can be a hassle to clean up. Today was particularily dreadful. Because it's silent when it's leaking (usually takes place when the dishwasher is drying the dishes. Don't ask me how that particular nuance works) you sometimes have to keep an eye on it. In any event, I sit down at the table to read the paper, and about two minutes later, I turn around, and the entire kitchen floor was covered in a thin veil of water. Goddamn piece of machinery . . . 

In any event, it's Riley's birthday today. He turns 9 years old. Mom got him a huge-ass Bionicle (candidate for stupidest idea Lego ever had. MindStorms has nothing on these) and an acoustic guitar (way to go, Mom. Riley doesn't have the patience to finish a novel. What makes you think he'll do any better with a guitar?). Oh, well. If he demonstrates patience with the guitar, then I'll be damned impressed.

"event","After many, many hours of playing through the world of Aether, after countless frustrations prepetrated upon myself at the hands of the hated Ing horde, I've finally completed Metroid Prime 2: Echoes.

The Metroid series of games, up until Prime came out in 2002, was a relatively obscure franchise. It wasn't as well loved as Zelda, and it wasn't quite as popular as Mario. Nevertheless, it established a loyal enough fanbase that Nintendo published the first Metroid game in roughly 8 years, for it's then successful Gamecube.

And we were all the better for it. Prime was, and in many ways, still is, the best Gamecube title to date. How then, does it's sequel stand up?

First, I shall relate the storyline. An ancient race, known as the Luminoth settled on the planet Aether, a veritable Paradise, after many years of being cosmic nomads. Life was happy, until fate decided to send a huge meteorite crashing towards them. When said meteorite hit the planet, it did so with such a great amount of energy, that it opened a rift in time and space, and drew a dark planet from another dimension towards it. So now the two planets coexist, only on two separate planes. Problem is, that the inhabitants of the Dark world, the Ing Horde, are waging a brutal war on the peaceful denizens of the Light World. Enter Samus Aran, stage left.

Metroid Prime's opening was dramatic. It showcased Samus, wending her way (that's right, ""Wending"". Watch as I resurrect the English language, one dusty word at a time) through an Orbital Space Pirate laboratory, far above the surface of planet Tallon IV. She takes care of business, manages to get her suit wrecked, and escapes the self-destructing space station with not a moment to spare, before heading after one of the generals of the Space Pirate armada.

Prime 2's opening, on the other hand, is sadly nowhere nearly as exciting. Samus recieves a distress beacon, and makes Planetfall on Planet Aether. But on the way down, her ship gets caught in an electrical storm.

GRAPHICS
The visuals in Metroid Prime 2 aren't much of a step above the original Prime. The light sourcing is a bit better, and there is less jagged pixels when things get really close, but for the most part, things remain unchanged. This isn't necessarily a bad thing; Prime's graphics were amazing at the time, and are still excellent today. 

One thing that has really improved is the Samus model. She looks darker in this one, more down to business somehow, than her previous version. However, this is a moot point, as the player doesn't really see her throughout the game (aside from when you first load up your save game, or when you acquire a new weapon/pickup.

Speaking of the Samus model, it should be noted that she upgrades her armour throughout the course of the game. While I didn't care much for the Dark Armour (it looked too coppery, as if it just came out of a mint or something), her Light Armour is decidedly bad-ass. Looking a lot more slender, clad in shining, pearl white armour, lights on her chest, she looks like some kind of space faring Ninja, or something (Which in itself is bad-ass; Wearing white defies ninja convention, so she's bad-ass in three different ways).

GAMEPLAY
Gameplay remains largely unchanged from the original Metroid Prime (henceforth referred to as MP), with only one notable difference. The player must hop back and forth through the light and dark worlds to solve myriad puzzles. Sound familiar? It should. This sort of setup was last seen on the SNES classic, Zelda: A Link to the Past. This can be frustrating, at times, as some of the portals from which you emerge are one way only, leaving you to backtrack all the way across the map to find another one. This gets frustrating really quick, and sadly, it happens very often.

That's not the worst thing, though. When you're in the dark world, the harmful atmosphere reeks damage on your suit, so you spend the majority of the early game hopping to and from pockets of light (staying in these ""safe zones"" slowly refuels your energy) to survive. The thing that bugs me about this is that the damage caused by exposure to the atmosphere can become severe in a matter of seconds, and the time that it takes to replenish health in the safe zones is immense. This means that you'll spend what feels like hours just going from point A to point B. And it gets even worse. Oftentimes, the player will be surrounded by the Ing (the main enemies of the game. They adopt many forms), and their constant attacks do nothing but hinder the healing process. Of course, the problem is lessened when you get the Dark suit, and is eliminated altogether with the aqcuisition of the Light Suit, but by then, it doesn't matter. You'll have amassed a large collection of Energy tanks. Perhaps I'm a pussy, but I'd have preferred a little bit more balance.

While we're on the topic of gameplay, I should mention that the Screw Attack, from Super Metroid has made a triumphant return in Echoes. By moving forward while space jumping, and pressing the jump button again, the player will air jump forward up to five times. Not only does it look awesome, and damages enemies something fierce, but it is also necessary to solve some of the puzzles. My only complaint is that the Screw Attack puzzles don't come up often enough, which makes the Screw Attack seem more like a gimmick, than anything else. Still, it's nice to see it return.

Another minor gameplay addition is the ability to use the boost ball ability in conjunction with the spider ball. By clinging to the magnetic Spider Ball tracks, and then boosting, the player will be flung off in the direction that they are facing. This is also essential for solving puzzles, and is even required for defeating certain enemies. It's fun, too ^_^.

The weapons in Echoes are a strange dichotomy. They require ammunition, something unheard of in any past Metroid title. The weapons themselves are kind of cool, though. You've got the Light and Dark beams (the Dark Beam itself is a candidate for ugliest weapon ever in a video game), and they both fire the respective types of energy. The Dark beam is the Echoes equivalent to the Ice Beam. It can immobilize enemies, but is more likely to slow them down. On the other hand, the Light Beam functions more like MP's Plasma Beam. It will set enemies on fire, with holy energy. Finally, you've got the Annihilator Beam, which fires a stream of Light and Dark energy, but can also be used as a sonic interface device (I don't want to spoil how it works). 

Similar in nature to MP's Beam combo system, you can charge each beam, and then fire a missle, with effects varying from Beam to Beam. Comboing the the Light Beam will result in the Sunburst, a slow moving ball of light which will more often than not kill anything it touches (it wreaks utter havoc in the dark world). The Dark Beam combo unleashes the Darkburst (Not the most original name, but it's better than G Gundam's ""Darkness Finger!!"" attack), which is, admittedly, the coolest looking attack in the game. It's basically this big black hole that travels across the room, enveloping anything it touches in total darkness. Then, you have the Sonic Boom, the Annihilator Combo. Arguably the most useless attack in the game. It fires a stream of sound that explodes upon impact with the enemy (or wall). Kind of stupid. It would've been a lot more effective if it just stunned everyone in the room instead. I mean, it is a sound based weapon, after all.

Also, like MP, Echoes has many different visors for use in solving puzzles. You've got the Dark Visor, which let's you see things that reside in the world opposite you're in (It's a lot more useful than it sounds), and then there's the Echo Visor. The Echo visor is extremely cool. It lets you see sounds. I can't really explain how this works, but it's an effect that must be seen to be believed. It's almost as cool as the X-ray visor, from the original Prime. My problem with the Echo visor is that it really has no other use, outside of the puzzles for which it was designed, which are few in number, so it feels very gimmicky.

CONTROLS
Shigeru Miyamoto has gone on the record, saying that Metroid Prime wasn't a First-Person Shooter (or FPS, for short), and this statement is reflected by the control scheme. Instead of having a user-friendly interface, with a very slight learning curve (like Halo), we have a more conservative approach. The Control stick moves you forward and backwards, and side to side. Holding down the L shoulder button causes you to lock on to the nearest enemy, and tapping B while moving sideways causes you to perform a sideways dash, which is usefull in avoiding attacks. Jumping is also accomplished by pressing the B button, but requires a harder press than what is required for a sideways dash. Those are just the basics of movement.

Firing your weapon requires a tap of the A button; Hold it down to charge the shot to do more damage. This naturally takes time to prepare, and part of the battle strategy is knowing when it's best to use each type of attack. Changing visors and weapons is as simple as pressing the appropriate direction on D-pad, and C-stick, respectively. Finally, the map is accessible by pressing the awkwardly placed Z button.

SOUND 
Musically, the game is a treat. Kenji Yamamato, longtime composer for Nintendo, has crafted an excellent soundtrack, much in the same style as the MP soundtrack. This is something of a surprise. Koji Kondo (another longtime Nintendo composer) worked solely on the MP OST,  and to have the Echoes OST follow suit is excellent, even if the synth capabilities of the 'Cube are overused on some tracks. Nevertheless, this is excellent stuff, and old time Metroid fans will be elated to hear classic Metroid tunes, redone using updated synth technology (the biggest and best example of this is the deep Torvus Bog music. If you listen, it's actually the theme of Brinstar (""Dreams in Red"", to be specific). The majority of the soundtrack, is new stuff, however. In particular, the Temple Grounds music, and Normal Torvus Bog tunes are excellent.

THE BAD . . . 
My complaints with the game, aside from the whole ""lose health way too quickly in the Dark world"", The monster designs are kind of stupid. Aside from the Hunter Ing (sort of like giant flying octopusses), or the Blogg (giant, acquatic . . . things), they're all just uninspired. This is doubly true for the bosses. They are all, for the most part, the same creature, with different powers. Not only that, but the boss fights themselves, while a lot more difficult, just aren't as epic as those found in the original Prime (I don't think there's a single MP player who can forget such fights as those with Flaahgra, Thardus, Omega Pirate, or Mecha Ridely). Even the final boss, the Emperor Ing, is a fast paced, although very bland battle

Another thing I really disliked was the Space Pirates' appearance. Fans of the original Prime will fondly recall the pirates looking somewhat similar to the Predator, bad-ass villians, worthy of being Samus's rivals.  In Echoes, they look plain stupid, resembling bipedal mantis things that look really dorky. The Ing possessed versions look a lot cooler, with purple trim, and spines coming out of their backs, but they are also really rare, and fall too easily.

Also, the hint system is still annoying. You could be merrily blasting away at the cursed Ing, trying to figure out what you're supposed to do next, and all of a sudden, you'll get a message telling you that you're supposed to be at the other end of the game map. It gets old in a hurry. I wish it'd inform players sooner, as to what they need to do, instead of letting them wander for hours.

And who's bright idea was it to make the various beams you aqcuire in the game require ammunition? This defies Metroid weapon conventionality, and not in a good way.

Finally, my last complaint is with the story. It honestly felt like a side story, and as Majora's Mask proved, side stories do not belong in any Nintendo game. This only bolsters that opinion 

IN CLOSING . . . 
So, does Metroid Prime 2: Echoes fall short of the glory attained by the first Prime? Yes, it does. That's not to say that it's a bad game, though. It could have benefitted more from a bit more innovation, but it's still a good game, not as rounded as Prime, nor as engaging as, say, Super Metroid, but it stands well enough on it's own to warrant a look. PS: Nintendo, get to work on an arranged Metroid OST, with music from all 6 metroid titles! We deserve it . . . 

Overall rating: 3/12 out of 5 (bump the score up half a point if you're a HUGE Metroid fan)

Pros: - Great music
      - More challenging than any other Metroid game
      - Samus is still bad-ass

Cons: - Repetitive enemy designs
      - Story is kinda lame.
      - Beams require ammo? What the fuck?
      - Scavenger hunt-style gameplay may have limited appeal

"event","With Christmas over and done with, the holiday spirit is gone as well. My christmas went alright. I got a couple of greatly needed items (gloves, clothes, money, etc).

On Christmas Eve, we spent the evening over at my Grandmother's house. She's a sweet lady, but sometimes she goes overboard with the festivities. In any event, my brother was restless all throughout the evening, so the task of watching over him was placed upon me. We basically sat downstairs and watched the annoying christmas cartoons all evening. I have to admit that the newer stuff they have now has NOTHING on the stuff I used to watch. I think the worst Christmas special I was subjected to was ""Christopher the Christmas Tree"". It followed the story of a morose owl who is unable to fly, or talk (Doesn't that make him retarded, compared to other owls?). Eventually, the owl (named, stereotypically enough, Hooty) gets wounded, and ends up in the care of a young boy, who takes him into his house. After recovering, the boy reluctantly kicks the poor owl out of his house, and the owl eventually stumbles onto a gigantic talking tree, whose name is Christopher, and who also has a plethora of tiny animals (squirrels, birds, and one particularilly retarded skunk) living inside him. I'll be honest. It was barely watchable, but then the show went to fucking hell when the animals broke into song. It was at that point that I tried to smother myself with a pillow. Riley seemed to enjoy it, but then, he's 8 years old (legally stupid).

The next show to come on was one of my all time favorites, ""A Christmas Story"". This 1980's classic is the tale of a young boy named Ralphie, who desperately yearns for a ""Red Rider BB Gun, with a compass in stock and this thing which tells time"". It's primarily a comedy, with sentimental drama thrown in here and there (but not very often). The only thing keeping young Ralphie from getting said gun is his parents' unrelenting refusal to get him one (""You'll shoot your eye out!""). Actually, I think it's best to not talk about the plot anymore, as it really deserves to be seen.

Christmas day eventually rolled around. I saw Nigel that day, and we hung out together. He walked me home, and I may or may not have seen Marc (Nigel said it was him afterwards, but I'm not so sure). Also got a christmas message from my old friend, Kris Goldman. It was great to hear from him, and I've been trying to get in touch with him, to wish him back a merry christmas, but to no avail.

The only trouble with this years' Christmas was the overabundance of snow that we got dropped on us on the last minute. It fell unrelentingly onto our sidewalk, and I vowed to shovel it all after Boxing day sale shopping.

Speaking of boxing day shopping, I picked up some awesome items. First, and foremost, I picked up the Mazda RX-8 Transformer Meister (known better by his infinitely superior American name, Jazz). This item is part of the Transformers ""Binaltech"" line. This translates to supreme articulation, and ultimate realism (in car form, the figure is absolutely flawless). It's also easily the hardest Transformer to, you know, transform, that I've ever seen in all my days of transforming Transformers. And I've been doing that since I was, like, 2.

Also picked me up the Master Grade Strike Gundam model kit. The amount of detail on the kit is staggering, even for a Master Grade. And it doesn't skimp on articulation. Aside from maybe the MG Nu Gundam, I think the MG Strike is the most complex Master Grade I've ever built. A very satisfying build of a very stylish (in a generic sort of way) machine.

And lastly, I picked myself up a model kit of the Toyota AE86 Trueno Sprinter, as driven by Takumi Fujiwara, of Initial D. People tend to think that it's an ugly, outdated car, but I find to to be utterly charming. It's small, very fuel efficient, and is great at cornering. About it's only flaw is that it's an FR car, which makes it unsuitable for winter driving (AWD is still best for that). Not that that matters on a model kit, but it's an interesting bit of trivia.

Also got to see Aaron a few days ago, and he presented me with a Big Lebowski poster. How nice of him!

And finally, I had the rare opportunity to hang out with Steph-chan the other day. We went to Chinook mall to hang out. We ended up playing a lot of DDR, which made me realize how far I've fallen. I used to be able to do 9 footers with ease, but that day, I failed a goddamn 7 footer. I also barely made it through the songs I'm good at (A, Era, Senorita). But Steph-chan is doing well. She talks an awful lot, but it doesn't matter. She's just too damn cute.

"event","Back with another anime I downloaded, more Macross. This time, it's the featurette, Macross: Flashback 2012.

I'm not sure if this was meant to be a followup to the excellent DYRL? OVA, or what, but what it is, is a music video, set to footage of various scenes from Macross, and DYRL?. The music I mentioned is just Minmay songs, edited somewhat to fit the pacing of everything. What results is a somewhat confusing walthrough of the events chronicled in the TV series, and DYRL?. This alone is somewhat of a continuity buster. The events of DYRL? were completely independent of the TV series, and I'm not sure if splicing them together with the scenes from the TV series is justifiable. 

On a side note, I am rather bitter that they didn't include, among Minmay's songs, her classic ""My Boyfriend is a Pilot"". This is one of the catchiest songs in an anime, and to not include it is something of a crime. 

One of the high points of Flashback 2012 is seeing updated versions of the Macross characters. They've aged a bit since they were last seen in either Macross or DYRL?, and the animation reflects this. Hikaru's hair is no longer all over the place, and Misa's adorable ""cinnamon bun"" hair is no longer in that shape. Also, apparently Hikaru and Misa are now married, and while Hikaru is still a pilot aboard the SDF Macross, Misa has been promoted to Captain of the Macross.

All told, this music video has some flaws, but to be honest, it wasn't all bad. After all, this is the last chance fans will have to see their favorite Macross characters for a final time, as they're never really seen again (which is a shame. You really grow to care for everyone in the series). The exceptions to this rule are Max and Millia, who both return in Macross 7.

As is the nature of the music video, I find it hard to rate. For one thing, it seems to be more of an interactive scrapbook than an OVA, more suited to the diehard fans, than casual Macross viewers.

"event","So I finally finished downloading and watching Macross: Do You Remember Love? and I have to say that it rocked.

Being a fan of old school anime, DYRL?'s art style struck a note with me instantly. With that said, I'd wager that the production quality rivals that of most big budget anime features. The quality of the art, despite being 20 or so years old, has stood up well over the years, and the quality of the animation itself is astounding for something of this age.

Macross is considered an absolute classic by the anime community, and after viewing the series, and now the OVA, it's not hard to see why. The story, while cheesy at some points, really hits home with it's theme of love, and relationships, that was never really explored in such detail until later series, like NKOR, or Gundam X (at least, those are the ones that I can think of off the top of my head). And the ending itself is one of the best I've ever seen in any anime. Unlike the TV series' ending, which was a very small, quiet ending to a very big show, the ending presented for the OVA is bombastic, featuring a huge space fleet battle, while Minmay sings a concert for those aboard the Macross. The end credits themselves roll to footage of the concert, complete with lights, dancing, and singing (plus, Minmay is just so cute in her concert dress ^______^).

It should be noted that DYRL? is sort of a retelling of the events chronicled in the Macross TV series. Events seem to happen in a different order, some are skipped entirely (like Max and Millia's love story), and others are altered in such a way that fans of the original series might find it offensive (Roy's death scene is an example of just such an alteration. Instead of being shot up in a blaze of glory during a defensive mission, he dies in a botched attempt to escape from the Zentradi.)

It's best to treat DYRL as sort of an alternet setting to the original Macross TV show. The characters are the same, the time is the same, but events happen differently. And all told, it's all the better for it. I wholeheartedly reccomend this OVA for anyone wishing to see these classic anime characters in action again. It's not to be missed, Macross fan, or not.

"event","With Christmas on it's way in a few short days, my spirit has fallen far. Not that it's an unusual occurance, but Christmas has always been a melancholy time of year for me, despite the fact that I'm surrounded by family and friends.

As strange as this may sound, I don't like christmas presents. Whenever I open one, my mind always wanders towards people who're less fortunate than I, and I get to thinking that I don't deserve anything, especially when there are others out there who suffer, when I have a relatively easy life. It's always been like this for me, so I find little to be cheerful about during this time of year. The new year isn't any better. People resolve to make their lives better through myriad meaningful, yet hopelessly empty promises and decrees (""I WILL lose weight this year!"", or ""I'm going to quit smoking!""), although I suppose that's their own fault, and not the machinations of yet another stupid tradition.

Christmas is also a time to be thankful for family and friends (Thanksgiving used to be the holiday for that. Since when did we allocate a holiday for every aspect of our lives, anyways? Can't we be thankful for stuff like that without having a holiday centered around it? It just makes it seem superficial to me).

I just don't know what else to say. Maybe I'm going through some slight depression, but I have no idea why . . . .

"event","Christmas is rapidly approaching, and with it, the christmas 'spirit' as well. I've never liked the christmas of today. It always seems so commercial. Whatever happened to 'goodwill of man', and all that? When did christmas become like this? *sigh*

I helped out with the christmas decorating today. We hauled out our artificial tree (which I say is superior to most real x-mas trees), and afterwards, I helped my mother thread the christmas lights into it.
Kind of an arduous task, as mother likes to have them set in a perfect way. 

The thing I hated most was setting up the goddamn NutCracker (the most suggestively named piece of christmas paraphenalia ever). Our nutcracker stands about 2 feet high, and has a look of utter vacancy in it's eyes. Its teeth are particularily frightening. Set on a hatch, not unlike most mouth-equipped hand puppets, the teeth on this thing are large and in charge. To be honest, I find this nutcracker to be more creepy than festive (that is, if festivity is what the creators were going for, as opposed to tradition. And speaking of which, why would anyone want to make such a creepy object part of history?). Actually, I'd bet that it'd be more at home in a house with Hallowe'en themed decor. 

Unpacking other boxes, I found the Yule Log that I made for my mom way back when I was a kid. The thing has held up surprisingly well throughout the years, and I was a little shocked that she would keep it. Among other yule-tide ornaments, we found the Cowboy Snowman, that has become the bane of the holidays ever since it's inception. This particular object is basically a snowman, wearing cowboy gear. When you flip the switch on the bottom, it starts vibrating (""What the...?""), and sings an up tempo version of ""Here comes Santa Claus"". As if the song itself wasn't annoying enough, now we've got a migidarian, ridiculously attired snowman to sing it? Ugh . . . . 

We also found a similar item, only this time it's a bird that chirps in tune to Jingle bells. Riley somehow activated it, and didn't know how to turn it off. I suggested banging it against the wall, and he said, ""Like mom used to do to me when I didn't shut up?"" He's definitely acquired my sense of humour, which is a relief. God knows my sister's sense of humour isn't the most intelligent kind around.

We also dug up this beautiful Santa figurine. Clothed completely in white, and looking more like the Sandman than anyone else, it is nevertheless, a very beautiful figure, and I hope it stays in excellent condition throughout the years.

Well, with that, I'm ghost . . .

"event","I'm rather upset today. One of my mother's old boyfriends came to visit us today. I've never been entirely fond of this man, and I wish he'd leave us alone. Mom says she feels comforted by having him around. Maybe she doesn't remember this, but this is the same man who screwed us over a long time ago (the man who is responsible for Caylin, my sister). 

He did challenge me to a game of Halo, which he lost miserably.

He decided to spend the night here, which made me angry inside. As far as I know, he has a wife, and at least one child. Not only that, but the two slept in the same bed. As much as I dislike him, Caylin dislikes him even more, which is entirely understandable. He did abandon her as a child, after all (sorta the same thing that happened to me).

Only God knows what's going to happen next, but Mom did say she wanted this kept from Caylin (she was at a friend's for the night when it happened). I feel that Caylin should know, but I also don't want to betray mom's trust in me. What an underhanded thing for her to do . . .

*grumbles*

In other news, I did manage to pick up the Turn-A Gundam movie duology. After sitting down to view these movies, I can say that they were definitely made for the fans of the show. Basically, the movies compress 50 episodes of the TV series into two, 2 hour movies, so the narratives move at a breakneck pace, that only really slows down after the first hour. Because of this, it's hard to recommend them to people new to the show, as they will be lost within the first five mintues. A little more in the way of accessibility would have been nice (not that I needed it).

Other than that, I have one other qualm with these discs. Normally, on import DVD's, the english subtitles are marred beyond recognition (an actual line from my import Gundam 0083 dvd: ""Space war the final table monkey radish car"". And this went on for about 13 episodes). Not so with my Turn-A Gundam DVD's. The subtitles are pretty decent, with very few grammatical errors, and this makes it quite easy to watch. But when they refer to certain characters, mecha, and/or ships, then things get a bit wonky. For instance, main character Rolan becomes Laura, Turn-A Gundam becomes Gaoda (and later, in the second disc, Gingadum), and the Willgem becomes Will Jim (which is about as accurate as this show gets in terms of names). Aside from that, other tiny things bother me, such as punctuation errors. But this is no big deal. I can live with it.

I just wish they'd hurry up, and bring Turn-A Gundam over to the States, so they'd make some sweet ass MSiA's. After the *incredibly* awful Hyaku Shiki MSiA, a 2nd version Turn-A Gundam figure would be just the neosporin for my wounds.

"event","Today has been a slow week. With my dad's funeral, and the viewing prior, I haven't had much opportunity to go out to search for a job (seeing as how I quit my job at my previous place of employment). Speaking of life and death, they seem to compliment each other, as with the death of my dad, new life is born anew, in the form of SHaun and Leona's baby, whom they've dubbed, ""Lidia"", after Nona Lidia. Even though Lidia was born a couple weeks before my dad's death, that's the feeling I'm getting here, is that the two events balance out.

I also rented some animes. Cowboy Bebop: Knockin' on Heaven's Door, and Cybord 009. While the Cowboy Bebop movie got boring rather quickly, there was some fun to be had in it, as the trademark taste and style of the excellent TV series is retained. There just isn't enough ""oomph"" to keep it going throughout the entire length. I think it would've been better off done in a 3 episode OVA or something, rather than a movie.

On the other hand, Cyborg 009 was excellent. Featuring old-school character designs, and an older-school plot (at least it seemed like it. Very reminiscient of Osamu Tezuka's Metropolis). The depth of the characters extends further than what might be expected of a ""super robot"" show, such as this. Also, I'm pretty sure that BOA does the opening theme of the show, but I have no way of knowing.

Other than that, not much is happening. I'm going to register into SAIT within the next week, so hopefully that will go well, and then I'll try for my learner's liscence the following day (I've put that off for FAR too long).

I got the call around 11:00am, and immediately went to the hospice. Everyone was there; Marisa and Rod, Shaun and Leona, Nick, Nona Lidia, and of course, my mother and sister. Everyone was crying, except for me. I think they thought I was cold or something, but to be honest, I've been preparing for his death ever since he was first diagnosed with the cancer, so I wasn't as emotionally receptive as I normally am.

Afterwards, I headed down to Eau Claire, and decided to get rid of my troubles by playing a couple rounds of DDR, and Initial D.

"event","Today was very productive. 

I woke up at around 8:00am, and got ready to go out to drop off some resumes. I put on my best clothes, packed my stuff together (which mainly consisted of my book of resumes), and headed off. My first stop was downtown, namely Eau Claire, where I dropped off a resume at this art dealership. My travels then led me to HMV, where the store next to it (that deals in photography, the name of the venue itself eludes me) , where I also dropped one off at. I hit a couple of other places (I can't quite remember them), and my final stop was at Cinezeo, where I dropped another resume off. The clerk there said I had a cool name, which, for some reason made me self-conscious.

I checked in at Art Box (Banker's Hall), where Nigel is currently employed, to see if he was working that day, but to my dismay, the lady there told me to come back at another time. It was then that i decided I really wanted to see Nigel, so I headed down to Eau Claire's arcade to blow some time. I met Roland there (he now works a kiosk there, if kiosk is really the right word; It's more of a booth), and we played a couple games of Initial D. Well, when I say ""a couple"", I mean, like, $30 worth. So it was a lot of money. The time when Roland had to leave quickly approached, and I somehow found myself in the company of Mike and Rob. They informed me that the DDR machine was on free play mode, which in a way, it was. Apparently, someone had deposited 5 credits worth of tokens into the machine, and left it, giving me the chance to steal all 5 games. I was damned tired after that. 

This took place over the course of around 3 hours, so by the time I went to go see if Nigel was there yet, his shift was already almost up. After hitting a couple more places that were hiring, we headed to Video Game Traders, where I picked up vol. 1 and 2 of Aura Battler Dunbine (which served as the inspiration for Escaflowne). Nigel pointed out that the Mazda dealership across the street was hiring, so I dropped off an application there, too. The owner even let me sit inside the RX-8 that was on display, which was awesome. I can see why the car costs $40,000. You certainly get what you pay for. 

We headed back to Nigel's house, where we played Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance. His alliance proved to be deadlier than mine, ad he won most of the bouts. We sat around, watching Family Guy as well, which disappointed me, as it was an episode I've already seen about a billion times. 

At about the time that it was over, I decided I really wanted to get home and watch Aura Battler Dunbine, but Nigel made me stay to watch some video he downloaded of some idiot who piledrived his best friend off the roof of his house, and onto a table. It was really no surprise when the two injured themselves. Predictability aside, it was nevertheless quite humorous, and one can only imagine what thought process culminated in thinking that this sort of thing was at all a good idea.

Nigel's MSN rang non-stop. Apparently, Kristin added him to her list, which for reasons I can't explain, make me upset. *sigh*

Nigel said I shouldn't expect a call back from the folks I dropped my resume(s) off with, but when I got home, I was informed that someone had called, requesting an interview.

With that, I'm out of here.

"event","Last week, I went to St. Francis, my old high school. I needed to pick up my Student Transcripts, but my primary motive for going was to se my teachers again, for a final time. Mr. Arseneault was looking great (his grey hair made him look distiguished), and Mrs. deKlerk was doing great, as usual. She even gave me a hug, which felt really nice. I also saw Ms. Kang, and she's still as pretty as she ever was. Mrs. Carlson was also still there, and I went to see her. All told, everyone was doing alright. 

Being there made me very nostalgic, however. I kept expecting Kristin to come up behind me and tap my shoulder, like she used to do. At the bus stop, I kept looking towards the hill that led to the school (that's the direction Kristin would always come from). I kept expecting to see her there as well. 

*sigh* So depressed . . . . 

I was contemplating joining the army, as a way to get in shape, and earn a bit of extra cash, but unfortunately, it's a no-go. They have very high requirements, which kind of threw me off. Apparently, I need to have high level High School courses; nothing lower than 30 will do. And on top of that, I have to have all my marks above 80%. So difficult. I did awesome in high school, but not THAT awesome.

At work, we have two new employees, Mike, and Josh (not the previous Josh that was fired). Both are really good looking ^_^. 

Apparently, I also preordered Halo 2, as well. I was renting some games at Blockbuster, and then the guy was all like, ""Hey, you just preordered Halo 2!"". At first I was kind of annoyed about it, but then he told me that I'm entered into a contest, where I could win one of four lifesize Master Chief statues. 

Other games I'm excited about? Need for Speed Underground 2, Metroid Prime: Echoes, Half-Life 2, Final Fantasy XII, Z Gundam: AEUG vs Titans, and Initial D. While I'm definitely going to play each of these, I think I'll only end up buying Metroid Prime, Initial D, and the Gundam one.

With that, I'm off. I need to go to work now.

We're no longer a part of each other's lives, unfortunately, so her sending me it is kind of pointless. Part of me wishes she'd just forget all about me. It would certainly make my life a lot easier. But on the other hand, I can't let go of the memories she left me. Whenever I think I've gotten over her, I look at that flower she gave me that one day, and emotions just flood back. Maybe I'm just pathetic.

*sigh*

I bought Robotech: Battlecry for Gamecube. I absolutely loved Macross, and it's an utter joy to see all my favorite characters again for a final time, even if Hikaru Ichijo's name was changed to Rick Hunter for the Americanization of Macross, dubbed Robotech). Oh well. It's a lot better than Hayao kakizaki's name being changed to Ben Dixon. I swear to God, the American names all sound like the names of porn stars. Rick Hunter, Ben Dixon, Max Sterling . . .

I also rented Tales of Symphonia, for Gamecube. Marc had me all excited about it, but now that I actually have played through a good portion of it, it seems I'm now questioning his sanity, more so than usual (you have to remember, this is the same guy who lured Aaron, Nigel and myself into his room, and subjected the lot of us to Tiny Snowfairy Sugar).

Simply put, Tales is mediocre in every sense. The graphics aren't up to 'Cube standards, and the soundtrack is so ununique that it does NOTHING to draw you into the environment. Not only that, but the storyline pretty much rips off every RPG ever created (although the SNES classic Secret of Mana  is the biggest victim in this category). Add that to the bland, although fast paced, battle system, and you have an RPG that just can't cut it in today's world. Mind you, it is still one of the few RPG's available for the suffering 'Cube, so if you're a cube owner dying to get an RPG fix, then this game might satiate those needs.

I was also able to finish Initial D. It seems my initial assessments of the franchise were wrong. It is actually a very fun show to watch, and has got me excited to learn to drive (although actually drifting in my fathers' old Chevrolet Z28 might be hazardous).

Other than that, not much else is happening. I might be quitting my job at my current place of employment to pursue a temporary position elsewhere (where I might get paid more), and I plan on getting my drivers' liscence soon, so I'll be able to cart my friends and I around town, on wild adventures (ugh, painful memories of attempting to pick up chicks in my friends' mother's old Station Wagon come to mind. No, I've matured since then. I'd never let that happen again . . . ).

"event","I had fun today. I was able to hang around with Aaron, and we toured downtown again, almost arbitrarily. He wanted to go check out the ""Globe Theatre"", but we weren't sure where it was. I thought it might be in Kensington, but I didn't feel like walking all that way to find out. 

We met at the Pho noodle restaurant. I didn't feel like eating much, so I only ordered some spring rolls. We hit Eau Claire afterwards, and I decided to play some Initial D. I'm getting really good at it, and it's becoming really enjoyable. Too bad my interest in DDR is waning (again).

I was almost tempted to buying the Gundam movie trilogy at A&B Sound, but ended up foregoing it. Each volume was $40, so I'm not sure that decision would've been justified or not. They also had Macross II, and Macross Plus. I regretted selling Macross Plus way back when, and I was almost going to re-purchase it, but in the end, I decided not to. 

We went to HMV afterwards, so I could pick up an Elvis action figure (by Mcfarlane) for Mike next door. And after that, I walked him to the train station, called Nigel up, and asked if he wanted to do something. 

We went to Redd Skull, and I finally purchased a Masterpiece VF-1S (Roy Fokker use) Valkryie, from Robotech. I'm extremely happy with the purchase. In all honesty, this thing could win ""Toy of the Year"" on packaging alone. It's housed in a fold-open book, with an inner cardboard tray that slides out, for easy removal, and re-entry. To be utterly honest, it looks better in the box than it does out of it.

Accessories are pretty cool too. Along with the Veritech itself, there's also a miniature Roy Fokker figure (that can be placed in the cockpit), a ladder (for placing along the side of the cockpit, in fighter mode), a communications antenna (for Guardian mode), a beam rifle, a cockpit shield, and 4 missile pods, that can be attached to the hardpoints on the wings, two per wing.

Presentation of the figue is awesome already, and it's execution is great as well. The figures' mono-eye lights up, it features multiple points of articulation, and looks cool in all three modes, with Fighter mode being my personal favorite (it was the mode most used during the series). Engineering-wise, the figure's transformation design seems to have been based directly on the old Takatoku Valkryies, from the mid-eighties. This engineering works as well now as it did 20 years ago.

I think my only gripes with it are that it's leg joints are kinda loose, and the miniature Roy Fokker figure was difficult to get into the cockpit. Not only that, but the hands are less than satistactory. Also, I would've prefered the figure be made entirely of plastic, as die cast just doesn't last as long. Other than that, though, everything is perfect.

I think I'd give it an 85%

Pros: - Excellent Engineering, fantastic presentation
Cons: - Loose leg joints (might be an isolated problem), stubborn pilot figure, too much die-cast

The only other alternative for those looking for a highly detailed Valkryie is Yamato's 1/48 scale transformable figures. These are extremely well detailed (more so than the Masterpiece Veritech), and are a bit bigger, but the price rises by about $150, so expect to pay roughly $275 for one. While the Yamato ones may be better, I'm simply happy with my Masterpiece Veritech.

"event","Recently, I was able to rent two animes which I've been meaning to see for quite some time, but never got around to renting before. This inculdes Akira, and Gundam: Char's Counterattack.

Akira has a huge fanbase in both America and Japan, and after watching the anime, I fail to see why. People hail it as the best that the American anime industry has to offer, and that even Japan's recent offerings pale in comparison. 

The story in Akira is very esoteric. You really have to know what you're getting into before you watch it. That's not to say that previous experience (via the manga or something) is necessary to enjoy it, but it would certainly help. 

Basically, the story is this: ""Tetsuo!!!!!!!"", ""Kaneda!!!!!!"" *Insert explosions here*. Okay, so that is the abridged version. Here we go. The story centres on a young man named Kaneda, who happens to be a member of a bike gang. Kaneda himself owns this really sweet red motorcycle, and I'm guessing that this makes him the defacto leader of the gang.

His friend, Tetsuo, discovers that he's got extremely strong psychic powers, and so goes on a destructive quest to locate a being who's only known by his name, ""Akira"", who reportedly had similar abilities, only much, much stronger. That's pretty much it in a nutshell. It may sound like somewhat standard fare, and for the most part, it is. The only thing that sets it apart from most cyberpunk anime is it's heavy focus on ultraviolence (it's worse than Ninja Scroll).

Visually, Akira is gorgeous, although this may be attributed to the fact that I was watching the DVD version. Even then, it's still pretty impressive. The quality of the animation, and the animation itself (they're two different things, people), is extremely impressive for an anime almost two decades old, and can pretty much stand cel to cel with most anime being produced today.

The sound is done very well, too. Unfortunately, I had to setle for watching the english dub, because my speakers don't support the settings needed for the Japanese language mode. The music seemed pretty standard. I wasn't paying too much attention to it. 

I think my biggest gripe with Akira is that there are no special features on the disc. Nowhere will you find any commentaries by the creators, or art galleries, or special theatrical trailors. I  would've liked to see that kind of stuff, especially considering the fact that I was watching the Special Edition version.

Now, we move onto Char's Counterattack.

It's difficult to give a summary of this show, as, unlike Akira, previous experience IS necessary to enjoy it. Char's Counterattack (henceforth, I will refer to it as CCA) is a UC Gundam show, which means that it's a followup to previous shows in the series, including, but not limited to, Gundam 0079, Zeta, and ZZ. It features the cast from the original Gundam series (Namely Amuro Ray, Bright Noa, Mirai, Cameron Bloom, and Char Aznable). Previous experience will benefit the viewer greatly, as without it, (s)he might not understand the rivalry between Amuro and Char, or the political strife between the space colonies.

I shall forego the difficulties in explaining the story, in favor of giving a refview of the disc, and the presentation of the film.

Visually, CCA isn't quite as impressive as Akira. There isn't as much detail in the environments (which is understandable, considering that it's set in space). This may be because of the budget that Tomino-sama (creator of Gundam) had to work with. Nevertheless, the show's animation is still vibrant, and bright. There's no graininess at all to speak of, and everything is clean. Nothing wrong here, although not quite the graphical powerhouse that is Akira.

The sound is a different matter altogether. For the soundtrack, viewers are treated to beautifully orchestrated music, and the sound effects, for the most part are very accurate to the context that they are used in (although I'm kind of wondering why they stole the lightsaber sound from Star Wars). Overall, I was really impressed with the sound.

The extras included on the disc are kind of hokey. The music video, using footage of a cameraman's walkthrough of Gundam toy factory is, I think, the worst offender. Then there's the filmography of Yoshiyuki Tomino, which doesn't provide enough information. I dunno. I would've liked to see an art gallery, maybe some preliminary design sketches of the cast and mecha, or perhaps an interview with the compser of the excellent soundtrack (who's name escapes me at the moment).

With all that said, I should point out that I enjoyed this movie very much. Granted, I'm not the best person to ask about Gundam, but . . . 

Overall Ratings:

- Akira     : ***     (out of 5)
- Gundam CCA: ****1/2 (out of 5)

Farewell until next time. Hopefully, my next reviews will be for Macross: Do You Remember Love?, and Macross: Flashback 2012.

Got to see Nigel momentarily. We went up to Blockbuster, so I could return Macross Vol. 6 and 7. I was also able to rent Vol. 8 and 9, but more on that later.

Nigel and I played Fable for a while. We both have come to the conclusion that the game is indeed awesome, and that, if one has ignored the hype, that it delivers a truly rewarding experience for those willing to invest their time in it. Neither of us understand why anyone can dislike this game (And there does exist people like that). We both believe that they're focusing on what was taken out of the final rev, and not focusing on the game's own merits. People like that are far too pessimistic, and negative attitudes like that get on my nerves very quickly.

About 10 minutes ago, I finished watching the final episode of Macross. Despite the fact that the series is more than two decades old, it's still an incredibly enjoyable series. Macross is one of those shows where you really care about the characters, and what happens to them. Aside from Lynn Kaifun, there really wasn't a character in that series that I disliked. 

I think that that's whats missing from most of today's anime. Most of the plotlines of contemporary series are cookie-cutter fodder, recyclable (environmentally friendly!) plotlines that are bland, uninspired, and therefore, boring. One need only look at shows such as RahXephon, or almost any shoujo anime to find examples. 

Gone are the days when the ideas presented in anime were original. I really do miss animes like Gundam, Ideon, Macross (even though I just finished it), Kimagure Orange Road, and, to a lesser extent, Evangelion. It seemed so much simpler back then. Anime didn't need to have mind-blowing visuals, or music with advanced synth to appeal to the masses. What it relied on was story, and originality, and character development.

Some people may argue that anime like Evangelion was unoriginal, because it was inspired by both Ideon, and Gundam, but the fact remains that it was still a highly engrossing series, and it improved upon it's inspiration, if you ask me. The same can't be said for 90% of the anime's today. It just seems like the only company still putting out high quality anime nowadays is Studio Ghibli (you might remember them as the folks who put out Princess Mononoke, or Spirited Away, the two animes for which they are known the best, but they also did My Neighbour Totoro, The Cat Returns the Favour, Laputa: Castle in the Sky, and Castle of Caliogstro, among other, lesser known animes).

*Sigh* Anime has gotten progressively worse since the 90's. Sure, there have been a few shining moments, but for the most part, anime from that time period up until now has been less than grand. I don't think we'll ever recapture that former glory. It makes me depressed, even if it is a dumb reason to be sad. 

I dunno. I wonder if anyone else feels the same way about this as I do? Maybe I take anime too seriously . . .

"event","Ugh . . . . Too much happening right now, I can't concentrate. I went to go hang out with Aaron, and I got to see his dorm, down at the University. I must say that I am really jealous. If I had the drive, I could've easily done well enough in High School, well enough to get a recommendation for University. But, for some reason, I was limiting myself. I realize now that I was a fool back then. 

Must be cool, to still be in an institution for higher learning. Aaron's well on his way to making his future life great. In the meantime, what am I doing? Wasting my life away, working in a backwoods pub and restaurant. I know I shouldn't complain, because it was my decision that lead me here, but let it be known that if I were to ever encounter my High School self in a dark alley, I'd beat the fuck out of him for not doing the best he could. 

At this rate, my dreams of being a journalist will never be realized. But I can't give up! It'll cost me some money (a lot of it), and I'll have to work my ass off, but if it's hard, then it'll be worth it!!

A few days ago, I was also able to hang with Nigel, and we met up with Aaron at the University. We hung around there for a while, playing pool, and whatnot, but we finally got bored of that and decided to go to Eau Claire, for more evening festivities. But alas, the arcade was closed to the general public, as the ""Calgary Committee of Chef's"" (Whoa, the aliteration went crazy on me!)was hosting some kind of event, for member's only. If I had my chef's uniform on hand, I could've easily snuck in, but I forgot to bring it with me! And besides, doing so would've meant that I'd have to leave Nigel and Aaron behind. 

After our admittedly brief session at Eau Claire, we went to some Chinese restaurant. Aaron and Nigel ordered a plate of dumplings, which I didn't touch, really (I dislike oriental food, with few exceptions). I felt really uncomfortable there. It was far too fancy for people like me to be in there. If I had dressed for the occasion, then I wouldn't have minded, but I was dressed really casually, so I felt really out of place. Nigel and Aaron made fun of my insecurities, but they're both douches. 

I had to go into work today at 11:30. I was late by 15 minutes, and Calvin wasn't too pleased with that (he's a dick anyways, so it really doesn't matter how he reacted).

Afterwards, I went to Matt's house, where I played Fable. Words can't describe how great the game is. Being a free-roaming RPG, it's really expansive, with massive environments, and lush scenery. Character development is unprecedented, as well. The character whom you play actually evolves in real time, according to your actions. For instance, if you prefer to use heavy melee weaponry, then you're character will grow stronger, and at a faster rate than normal. If you're purely an offensive magic-user, then your hair will go white, and you'll become skinny. There's so, so much more to it than that, but to cover everything would take a book, about the size of ""War and Peace"".

For some reason, Matt doesn't like it very much. But then again, he's also the same guy who openly disliked Zelda 64, so I don't know how much his opinion can be trusted . . . 

Tomorrow's my only day off this week. I'm going to visit my father at the hospice, and on the way home, purchase a replacement tire, for my bicycle. Afterwards, I think I'll ride up to SAIT, see if I can book an appointment with a councilor. And after that, bike down to the various comic shops that are so sparsely planted around our fair city (Need to track down some Gundam figures . . . ).

Anyways, that's it for today's update . . .

"event","The past three weeks have been absolutely brutal for me. Josh was fired a ways back, which is kind of sad. I really liked him, he was cool. As a result, I have had to cover all the shifts he was scheduled for on top of my own shifts. I've been working nonstop for the past three weeks, and am completely burned out. I can't wait until Sunday.

A couple more developments . . . 

I purchased an Initial D game, for the PC, but had to return it, because it wouldn't run on my computer. Because I paid for it with Interact, they couldn't give me a cash refund, and instead let me put the amount I paid for it towards another product. I chose to put it towards a copy of Xenogears. The copy I ended up buying was the Greatest Hits version, so it costed $77.99 in total. This is a lot better than paying $200 for the normal version (Incredibly rare). 

To be honest, I was quite surprised to find out Xenogears had made it into the hallowed ranks of the Greatest Hits Library. It has always been a cult favorite; It didn't have a lot of fans, but the fans it does have are incredibly loyal. I've always disliked the packaging for the Greatest Hits. Instead of the sleek black side bar, we get a really tacky red text on green background. I would've opted for a sticker or something, and this tacky presentation takes away from the majesty presented by the game's cover. Still, it IS Xenogears, and I've been desperately seeking a copy for a long time.

The whole ordeal led me to wonder about the requirements a game must meet before it becomes a Greatest Hits title. Is it based on the number of copies sold? How long the game has been around? The quality of the game itself (which would do nothing to explain how Frogger managed to get on the list so quickly)?. So I dug around, and found out that, in order for a game to become a Greatest Hits title, it must sell approximately 1,000,000 copies. I'm unsure if this statistic is a national one. I'm thinking it'd have to sell so many copies in one nation, as each country has it's own variation of Greatest Hits. Besides, it'd downplay the game's significance if the numbers were for number of copies sold worldwide. And also, not all Greatest Hits titles were released in Japan. The Spyro games, and many Hasbro titles are examples of American exlusives (as far as I know).

Roaring success in a game's native country almost always guarentee similar results overseas. Squaresoft's Final Fantasy series is proof of this, with each recent installment selling well over 2 million copies.

Anyways, when I bought Xenogears, the guys at Trader told me that the copy was brand spankin' new, and that it was the only one they recieved. This actually isn't surprising at all. Judging by the numbers, Xenogears must've just recently hit the ""1,000,000 sold units"" mark, which would explain why I haven't seen a copy elsewhere and why it took so long to become a Greatest Hits title (it's been 6 years since the game's initial release). This chain of events is a stark contrast to Square's other releases (like FFVII, which became a Greatest Hits title a few months after the game was released domestically. Big surprise there.)

Other than that, I've also been playing through Resident Evil. Not the 'Cube remake, but the original, old-school Playstation version. To go back, and play through it again, after going through the 'Cube version is utterly hilarious. The dialogue was so corny, and the storyline was even more so. Lines like, ""Gosh! This mansion is huge!"" now make me laugh. I can't believe I was actually frightened by this game when it was first released!

I saw Marc at Eau Claire the other day. He nodded to me, but I walked away (what am I supposed to do? Be all nice, like nothing ever happened? Although, it wouldn't kill me to forgive him, I guess . . . ).

And finally, just an hour ago, a cat snuck into our house, via my bedroom window. Caused some trouble, too. I was gonna kick him out, but he was just so cute! He finally caused too much of a racket, and so I threw him out the back door (not literally, just sort of put him on the ground, and went back inside).

Hrmm . . . Not much else has happened . . . .

"event","Today was a good day. I had a lot of running around to do, doing errands, and stuff like that. Before I left, I got a call from work, saying that they might need me in today, but with all the shit I had to do today, I told them it was a no-go.

First, and foremost, I had to go down to HMV, to pick up ""My Neighbour Totoro"" (DVD), for Doug (whom you'll remember as the coolest co-worker ever). After that, I decided to hang out at Eau Claire. I had a lot of fun, despite the fact that the DDR pads fucked me over again (You'd think they'd be bored with that by now). I also played some Initial D. The car I was using previously, a GT-R Skyline, was apparently a Grip specific car, making it unsuitable for my driving style (then again, I only chose it because it looked nice). This became apparent in my race against the racers in Usui. This led me to change my wheels, and so I started over, this time selecting the Mazda RX-8 as my car. I must say that it is a major improvement, although I still experience difficulty using the drift cornering technique. This is probably due to the fact that I cut my teeth, so to speak, on R4: Ridge Racer Type 4, which is very 'arcade' in execution. I was expecting the same sort of experience with Initial D, and therefore have encountered difficulty in adapting.

On the way home, I got very thirsty, so I stopped in at Northeast Grocery to get some kind of frosted beverage. I ended up buying a bottle of ""Fruitello"", a new soft drink (mine was ice cream soda flavoured, but it ended up tasting more like dishsoap). Fruitello is worse tasting than Fresca, in my opinion. Also picked up a bottle of ""Tropicana Twister"", which I have yet to try; I'm still struggling to get the Fruitello down my throat. I don't wanna throw it out, because then I won't get my money's worth.

On a sadder note, my father's condition is getting worse, somehow. The tumour is indeed growing larger, resulting in an increase of mental instability. He's even more lethargic than usual, as well. It's really sad. He's fallen a long way. I predict he will finally die within the next two months. There's no hope for him to get better. I would very much like to visit him again. We (and by 'we', I mean my mother, sister, and I), owe him so much, and I know it's too late to repay him for taking us into his home. Even if it weren't too late, it'd be impossible to repay that kind of favour.

I ended up stopping to go see Nigel on my way home, but he was out, which was kind of annoying. He's probably seen enough of me the past couple of years. He probably needs a break.

Anyways, I got another call from Troy, and he was desperate for me to come in to work, so I told him I would, if he needed me that much.

Apparently, there were two birthday parties being held at the bar, so it was very busy. The bar staff set up a Karaoke machine, which I think was a terrible idea. Listening to a bunch of drunks warble away to songs that were bad enough as it is, is not what I call a pleasant work environment.

Near the end of the night, Troy came up to me and thanked me for coming in, saying I did an awesome job. Many people take compliments like this for granted, but hearing my mentor say this to me lifted my spirits beyond measure.

 . . . But I'm still depressed . . .

Also, I bought us some food, but she refused to touch it. Somewhere, Kristin is probably laughing at me.

In terms of DDR ability, she utterly destroys me. Then again, most people do, so . . . .

Also played some Initial D, and some guy challenged me. Take my advice kids. Never accept challenges from asians. They will flat-out wreck you.

Aaron and I have been shaking our heads over Playboy's marketing of the ""Bloodrayne"" character, from the eponymous video game. I can think of so many other video game/anime girls who'd make better playmates. Final Fantasy (the game series, not the movie) had plenty of candidates. Soul Calibur II, as well . . . . Almost any anime has better looking females (oh my god, I'm now a complete nerd!). I don't know why Bloodrayne is getting so much attention . . . <sigh>

"event","This past week has been filled with ups and downs, but mostly downs. I found out recently that my co-worker (and friend), Josh, was beaten up by a group of people outside of Co-op, down in Forest Lawn. The fact that it happened there does not surprise me in the least, but it still came as quite a shock. 

He was on his way to his ex-girlfriend's house to pick up his stuff, and that's when he was jumped. Typically, I'd think it was the machinations of his ex, but apparently, it wasn't a bitter breakup. This exonerates her, as she would've been the first person I'd interrogate. God, I sound like a P.I. or something.

As far as we know, it was just some random thugs.

In any event, because if his injuries, I have to cover for him, for the foreseeable (oh my god, is that even spelled correctly?) future. I really don't mind it, but it does make me angry that this sort of shit happens, although I can't say that I don't expect it from time to time.

I'm doing alright. I'm kind of depressed today, and I blame the fucking radio. They played this song, ""She Will Be Loved"", by a group called ""Mellow 5"", or something. It reminded me a lot of Kristin. <shakes head>. Not only that, but I also got this one annoying R&B song stuck in my head.

I talked to Nigel today. Apparently, Kate and co. are coming back from their trans-continential trip, which started in Vancouver, and ended in Seattle (actually, those were the only two stops they made). Nigel's been looking after their house, in their absence. I guess that the Kate family (Sorry! I don't know her last name!!) has a really fat cat, which I find humorous, for reasons I can't explain. They most likely have something to do with that dancing cat video from Ebaumsworld.com, though.

Went to see Shaun and Leona's baby the other day, which was exciting. All the female relatives were outside in the back yard, passing the baby around like a bong at a frat party, or something. Meanwhile, the rest of us (Nick, his girlfriend, Addie, and a bunch of kids) stayed downstairs, and played Dreamcast. It was a lot of fun. Nick has almost every Dreamcast game ever made, but they're all burnt copies. As a result, some of them don't really work properly. This was the case with Marvel vs Capcom 2, and Soul Calibur. The other ones worked just fine. In particular, we played a lot of DOA 2, and DreamSnes (which is a collection of SNES roms, but made compatible for the Dreamcast).

Oh yeah, before I forget again, Aaron and I saw the most blatantly sexist toy ever, in Chinatown a while back. I guess I forgot to report on this. Anyways, bascially, it's a little ""Dishwasher"" set. It comes with a little sink, some cutlery, and some dishes (all of which are made of delightfully pink plastic). Apparently, the sink can hook up to a real sink, so you can emulate the joyful task of washing dishes. If the whole premise behind the toy isn't enough, the box that it's packaged in is pink, with light pink letters, accentuated by little swirls around the text. Obviously, this toy is made for little girls. If that isn't an example of a sexual stereotype, then I don't know what is.

Also, Doug finally got around to watching Goldenboy, which he thoroughly enjoyed (he's male, after all). I'm happy that I'll finally get my dvd back, so I can show it to Matt.

Other than that, there's nothing really happening with me . . ."

I also made some new friends, by the names of Steph and Brandon (!!). They're both really nice people, and both are surprisingly easy to talk to (They'll never be able to replace 'her' though). Also, they both watch anime, and play DDR. They're cool in my book. Also had the chance to meet the best DDR player in the city. His name is Tony, and he is apparently better than even Adam Singer (who apparently moved away). This guy is amazingly good at DDR, and he seems to like video games as well. I didn't get the chance to talk to him much beyond that, though.

Gary stopped working at the pub, to pursue a career elsewhere. He still has my ZOE 2 video game. I'll have to get that back from him. Also, I wonder how Doug liked Goldenboy?

Nigel also has a job now, and I'm very happy for him . . . . 

All told, I'm depressed, though (although that's nothing new). Things don't seem to be going right for me. My hours at the Pub have been cut considerably, ostensibly to make room for fresh talent, I guess. I was never any good at being a chef, anyways. There are plenty of other things going wrong right now, but I can't really talk about it here.

"event","It's like, whenever I go to Eau Claire, Kristin is there. Why is this happening? Is it some sort of cruel joke, perpetrated by God, for my past follies? Whatever the case, she was there again today. Again, she tried talking to me. I sort of mumbled an obligatory ""Hi"" back, but I doubt she heard me. I didn't very much feel like talking to her anyways. I don't think she realizes what she does to me, by simply saying hello, or smiling at me. To be honest (and maybe a tad melodramatic), it feels like I'm being shanked, by a sharp ethereal knife, on the inside of me. Not physically, but that's what it feels like in my mind. I can't explain it, and I doubt she'd understand, as well. She was never good with metaphorical shit like this.

Last time I saw her, she was playing DDR, alone, a song called ""Colours"" by DJ Taka. Maybe it's unreasonable to think that she chose this song on purpose, because she knew I was standing by (part of the lyrics go, ""I was a fool to let you walk away""). Oh well, it can't hurt to dream, I guess.

I met up with Shaun at Eau Claire, as well, and we played mad amounts of DDR. Shaun is apparently an anime fan, and like Naruto, and Ghost in the Shell: SAC. 

Also, I noticed something INCREDIBLY cool, while watching Kristin, and her little asian guy friend play ""Break Down"". In the background, it has someone wearing a t-shirt, with the words ""Break Down"". The ""A"" is upside down, just like the logo for Turn-A Gundam!!! Of course, Shaun thinks that it may be because it's called ""Break Down"", and the ""Down"" part of the title led them to put that little nuance in. If I am correct about it being a reference to Gundam, that would mark the third reference I've seen in the game, the first one being DJ Amuro (Amuro was the main character in Gundam 0079). Then there's the Legend of Maxx, by an artist called ""ZZ"", which may be a reference to ZZ Gundam (or ZZ Top, whichever). DDR rules, yo.

It's like that time she called, a few weeks back, and said that she saw me at the arcade, and said she would've came up to me, but her glasses were broken, or some shit. Hmmph. I'm so sure . . . 

The huge fire of my love has been reduced to smoldering ashes. There's nothing for me to say to her anymore. It's no use talking to her. Maybe that's why I stayed silent. I don't dislike her, but . . . . 

She was watching some guy play DDR. Maybe he was accompianing her? I dunno. Nevertheless, this guy was pretty good at DDR. He passed the advanced version of ""So Deep"". I always find it impressive to see someone pass that song. She played as well. She did . . . alright. Cetainly not up to the level I'd expect from someone who hangs around with Marc so much (as much as I hate him, I have to say this: He plays a mean game of DDR). Then it was my turn, and I was pad fucked (this term refers to when you do really badly, on account of a messed up pad).

I did get a compliment from Matt (one of the resident DDR maniacs), which felt good.


Not much else happened today. I went out and bought new shoes, and on the way home, I picked up a cd, ""Gundam Seed OST vol. 1"".

As far as Gundam music goes, this cd is decent. It has the first three opening themes on it, as well as the first two ending themes. It also has instrumental versions of the aforementioned tracks. For some reason, the second opening song, ""Moment"" by Vivian and Kazuma gets, like, 4 extra tracks dedicated to it. I dislike this song very much, and to have 6 different versions of it is very annoying. Another glaring flaw is that they left out the fourth opening song, ""Realize"". This song kicks ass, and it's simply a criminal act, to not have it on the disc. The flaw of the disc having many variants of ""Moments"" would have been made up for slightly by the inclusion of ""Realize"", and maybe an instrumental version of this song. All told, I give this CD a 65%. It does have a nice cover, though, and the CD itself is lenticular, which is a cool effect.

I did alright, I guess. Aaron, he did good, too. Shaun was nowhere to be seen. <sigh> Maybe I should try doing something new, next time. 

Chrystal told me today that she still has feelings for me. I don't really want to be in any relationship right now (I'm still licking the wounds that Kristin gave me). As such, I had a dificult time trying to tell her about how I feel. To me, she's a friend, and that's it. Sure, we used to be more than that, but those days are far behind me.

I talked to Sammi today. She doesn't seem to be enjoying her new job at all. That's the way it goes, I guess. She needs to learn to take pride in what she does, and only then, can she find joy in her duties. It took me a while to learn that lesson, myself. Still, it was nice to talk to her. I really do miss seeing her everyday, like I used to at school <sigh>

Got a haircut today, something I was in desperate need of. I was very close to asking him to shave it all off, but I wisely chickened out at the last minute, and instead asked him to give me a light trim. It's still a new haircut, which means it's still in that ""Unsure phase"". I'll grow into it in about 2 days, at most.

My parents went away on a camping trip, and they took along Riley. Caylin is also away for the remainder of the summer. I've got the house to myself for the next two days <sigh>.

I'm probably gonna have to visit Dad on my own, down at the hospice. It's not a very pleasant place to be. The residents are all people who have diseases that are incurable, so basically it's a place where people are put when they are waiting to die. Despite comfortable rooms and accomodations for the residents, I find myself unable to be there for very long, before wanting to run away from the building. A feeling of hopelessnes emnates from the building, and this is probably what fuels my unease.

I knew I had to work at 6:00pm today, so I got ready about 2 hours earlier than normal. I did this because I wanted to go down and pick up my Dom figure (which STLL hasn't arrived). When I learned of it's absence from the Gundam Shop, I decided to head straigh for work. It turned out that I was 2 hours early for my shift, so I decided to head down to Trader. Karen was working today, as was Colin. Colin will be leaving Trader to pursue a job at Toys 'R' Us, as Assistant Manager. I wish him all the best for his new career, and hope that he will give me discounts on any Gundam figures I choose to buy from there in the future. 

Karen, on the other hand, looked really cool today. She was wearing a Transformers shirt, which was mainly purple, black and silver. This depressing colour scheme wouldn't usually work on someone as upbeat as Karen, but she also had purple eye-shadow on, so she looked really cool. Also, this one Asian guy walked into the store, and I kind of thought he looked like Hideo Kojima. Karen didn't think so, but . . . 

After my stop at Trader, I went to work, for the first time in a long while. I don't understand my lack of hours. Anyways, today was alright, save for the fact that I nearly killed everyone. See, our oven mitts are extremely dirty, from all the use they get. I decided that they were in dire need of cleaning. So I mixed some degreaser with some bleach and put the new chemical into a bin. This was probably the worst idea I've ever had. Bleach is pretty powerful as it is, but to mix it with another chemical produces a strange chemical reaction, that caused the entire kitchen to be filled with this sulphuric gas. Anyone who went into the kitchen died of asphyxiation (well, not really, but it did cause the other cook to throw up throughout the rest of the night). 

Anyways, the moral of the story is: Never, ever, EVER mix chemicals together, or else you just may cause the other cook to toss his/her cookies.

After work, I decided to head to Eau Claire for some late night DDR. I met Shaun there, and we played a couple of games. I passed Orion 78 again, something that I'm still immensely proud of. We also played a couple of Nonstop megamix modes of DDR. Also, on a completely unrelated note, I need to purchase a replacement pair of shoes. My current ones have almost fallen apart. I think I'll go to Wal-Mart tomorrow, and pick some up. I hear they have a sale on. Maybe Nigel would like to come along?

"event","Today was a lot of fun. Got to hang out with Aaron today, and again, we toured Eau Claire. After playing a couple rounds of DDR, we got tired (I guess my legs still need a bit of a rest from the massive amounts I've been playing lately, before today rolled around). Then we played some pool, which I lost for the first few rounds. Then I got my groove back (move over, Stella!!), and utterly dominated Aaron. Then we left, and headed for Chinatown, to pick up my Dom (which still hadn't arrived yet, by the way). I just KNOW he's got, like, a sack of them behind the counter, but he will neither confirm nor deny my suspicions. What a dubious proprietor. 

After this, we headed to TD Square, to hit HMV, and Play. I almost bought the ZOE: Idolo DVD, but I decided not to. It was for the better, anyways, as once we hit Play, I came across something far better. I found the first Gundam OVA, which, again, I almost bought, but then I found the Goldenboy DVD. There was not a moment of hesitation before I snatched it up and proceeded to the counter to purchase it. Sorry, ZOE, and you too Gundam! Some things have a higher priority than others, and you know that when I choose one thing over mecha combat, that it HAS to be good, and to apply that label to Goldenboy is like saying that the French are jerks: Both statements are painfully understated.

I also happened to pick up a couple of miniature Transformer figures, one of which was presented as a gift to Nigel later on, but I'll get to that in a minute.

After our jaunt around TD Square (man, I need to find other things to do with my time, than go downtown), headed back to Eau Claire, for a few more games of pool. I won, needless to say. As Aaron and I were walking away from the pool tables, some Asian girl in a blue sweater smiled at me. It was rather dark in the arcade (like it always is), so I wasn't able to make a decent profile of her in my mind's eye, other than the fact that she was Asian (when you've seen one Asian woman, you've seen them all). Regardless, I don't know if she smiled at me because she recognised me or something. Maybe she was someone from high school? I doubt it, though. I never really associated with any Asian females back then, save for Ms. Kang and Kristin. 

After this, I parted ways with Aaron, and headed down to Nigel's house, at which point I presented him with said Transformer figure. I was kind of disappointed when he got the same one I got (they're all randomly packaged in blind boxes), but it was no big deal. We watched some Goldenboy, and then we played a hell of a lot of DOA 3. He's really good at that game.

We then waited for 10:30 to roll around, so we could watch this one episode of South Park. Usually, I despise that show, but this episode parodied Lord of the Rings, and that made it funnier than normal.

Despite all the things that happened to me today, I kind of feel depressed, but I have no idea why . . .

"event","Today was great. As is usual for me now, I went to Eau Claire, and met 'Shaun'. He's really nice, kind of reminded me of Ian Sherwood, from High School, only cooler. We're both DDR players, and we're both of equal skill, although he's a bit better than I am. We played Nonstop mode on DDR a couple of times, and utterly bit the dust. Nonstop was probably created by the Japanese, to kill people, who aren't physically fit (then again, I thought the same thing of Era, when I first tried it).

Shaun and I saw this one guy play, and playing in standard DDR fashion, he was pretty good. But then he tried a couple of 4 footers, and started this freestyling sketch of pure pain. He was embarrassing to watch, crossing the line between being good at DDR and being a fag with such gayness, that many times throughout his game, I had to wonder if his body had been possessed by the patron diety of fairyness. Still, I guess he was trying something new, but it honestly didn't work out. He looked really faggity. 

Lesse, I arrived at Eau Claire at about 1:00pm, and stayed till about 8:00pm, playing countless games of DDR. I almost passed a 9-footer today, which I'm very proud of. Also passed 8-footer Holic on my first time, as I did Orion 78. 

We also saw Michelle today, hanging out with her boyfriend, Matt. I swear to fucking God that Matt looks like Jay, from Jay and Silent Bob. No one else who's seen him agrees with me, but to me, the resembalance is uncanny. He's crazy good at DDR, although nowhere nearly being as good at it as Adam Singer (aka God). Michelle and I talked at length about a variety of subjects, ranging from DDR, to anime and video games (although, I suppose, the three are usually related in some small way).

Also went and saw Tommy, down at the Gundam shop. I was really hoping he'd have the ZOE soundtrack in, but he didn't. I loved that soundtrack, and the copy I had broke, hence my current search for a replacement copy. The game itself was awesome, as well.

Went to Subway today, and there was this cute asian girl working there. She had a really charming smile. At one point, I considered saying something like, ""Hey baby, wanna see my 12 inch sub?"" but that probably wouldn't have gone over very well. Besides, it's one thing to say something like that, but it's entirely another matter to hold a straight face. Besides that point, I'm NOT smooth at all when it comes to women, so . . . 

And that's it!!

"event","These past few days have been interesting. On Sunday, Nona Lidia organised a barbeque for the family, and I actually attended, which is unusual (I dislike family gatherings). I have to admit, however, that the only reason that I attended was because this might mark the last time my father will get to spend some time with his immediate family, so . . . it was nice to see everyone. 

Shawn and Leona brought their baby, whom they named after Nona Lidia, and she was really cute. Even though she's only two weeks old, she already has a full head of hair, which is . . . well, there's black, and then there's BLACK, and her hair falls into the latter category, it's almost as if the night sky, in it's inky glory has taken up residence on her head. To be honest, the only other person I've ever seen hair this dark on is . . . Kristin . . . 

I helped to cook dinner, which I'm somewhat proud of. My steaks turned out really well, everyone loved them, and the chicken was also good, according to those who ate it (I didn't touch it, because I dislike chicken). The best part of dinner was the pasta that Nona Lidia made. It was PERFECT. The perfect amount of seasoning, and the selection of base ingredients for the sauce, itself, bespeaks culinary genius, that only years and years of cooking can bring. Being a cook myself, I'm always extremely impressed with Nona's work.

Shawn himself invented a new drink, too. I don't know what he calls it, but it's basically apple juice mixed with ginger ale. The end result is a drink that almost tastes like an apple Crush soda, but just tangy enough to elude classification as a sodical refreshment.

After the whole gathering had ended, we had to take Dad back to the hospice. I can only imagine what it must be like for Mom, to have to walk out of that room, leaving my derelect father behind. She also says she's been trying to get used to sleeping alone now, and that it isn't easy, because she can't get to sleep now (I guess Dad's snoring used to put her right to sleep). I feel really bad for her, but that goes without saying, now . . . . 

As per my friend Mike's request, I downloaded a game, called Gunbound. It's almost like Worms, only more anime-styled. I love this game. Aaron, Nigel! If you're reading this, download Gunbound (www.gunbound.net) and get playing with me, so I can whoop up on you! Yeah, it took a while to download (112 megs) but it was well worth it. Only problem with it is that it's really hard to become good at it, for reasons that are very esoteric.

Talked to Tony the other day. He says he keeps seeing my 'ex-crush' around. This could refer to any of 12 different girls that I liked throughout Highschool. On the same note, he also says that he'd like me to attend Con-Version with him and Akiko, but I don't know. Ticket prices are $40~$50, and that's a lot of money. There's a minimal amount of anime related panels and whatnot, but I don't think I'll attend. Besides, they definitely WON'T have Gundam action figures for sale, so I don't see the point in going, even if anime was being shown around the clock . . . unless it was good anime for a change. None of this Digicharat or Happy Lesson shit. 

Talked to Sammi today, and she didn't sound too happy to be talking to me. I think I'll leave her alone for a while. She might be upset with me about something or another. Women are so goddamn difficult to deal with.

Anyways, I'm going to bed now. It's goddamn late, and I'm fucking tired . . .

"event","Just got back from hangin' out at Eau Claire, for, like, 6 hours straight. Not like there's anything else to do in this sorry excuse for a city. A couple of new developments in my life, to which I will dedicate the following paragraph(s).

There's been a new game at the Cineplex for about half a month now, a racing game by the name of ""Maximum Tune: Midnight"", by Namco. After examining it for about five minutes, it becomes immediately apparent that much of the style was ripped from Sega's ""Initial D"" arcade machine. The demo screens are substantially different, however. Interspersed between scenes depicting gameplay are short little story snippets, in which phrases like, ""More power, more torque"", and ""I feel as one with this Supra"" flash by, presumably to make it seem that street racing is philosophically deeper than it really is (sounds almost like Gundam Wing, in that respect).

Graphically, Maximum Tune seems to go for more of a stylish, almost cinematic approach. Whizzing past lightposts produces this weird, hard-to-explain effect, where the light itself follows the lamp, creating a 'light trail'. This goes for the lights on the car, too, and almost every other light in the game (buildings, reflections, even the sun, to a certain extent). The car models themselves are shiny, and reflective, almost to the point that looking at them will cause permanent corneal damage (""ARGH! MY DAMN RETINAS!!). 

The backgrounds also follow the suit set by the foreground visuals, with flashy buildings, highway overpasses with reflective concrete (What the . . .?) and other such things. The buildings themselves are almost incandescent, something that just looks really cool, as it did in ZOE 2: The Second Runner.

The developers felt it necessary to copy every nuance that was prevalent in Initial D, and this goes for the character portraits that are displayed during the race. Now if you thought my complaints regarding Initial D's artstyle (or lack thereof) were bad, then wait 'til you see this games' characters. They are UGLY in a way that makes Initial D look like an art form (again, not that Initial D had ugly characters, but it's art style was very bland). The actual character designs for Max Tune are uninspired, and quite boring. 

Gameplay itself is left largely unchanged from Initial D. Again, we see the copycat of game design rear it's ugly head, as players are asked if they want to purchase a ""game card"", for subsequent races. Aside from that, the difficulty isn't too bad, actually. I won the race the first time I played, unlike in Initial D, where one screw-up and you're basically fucked. 

Unlike traditional arcade games, where you can continue on, as long as you pass the stage, Max Tune (and Initial D, for that matter) both require you to input more tokens in as you progress. Obviously, only rich people will have the funds necessary to get really good at this game.

As far as control goes, it's thankfully a lot tighter than those of Initial D's. Of course, this might be an unfair comparison, as Max Tune is a much more recent game than Initial D, and Initial D's steering mechanism is terribly worn from all the use they still get. 

So is Max Tune a better game, or does it stall halfway through the race? In my opinion, it doesn't even get started until it's already lost. Initial D may be more difficult, and have looser controls, but on the other hand, it's not quite as extravagent as Max Tune in the graphics department. it all really depends if you're looking for more of an arcade style race, or a simulation. 

Overall rating: 3/5

Pros: Not much that hasn't already been seen in Initial D . . . 
Cons: This isn't a new game, and it's graphics do become annoyingly destracting.

Other than that, I did happen to run into this girl who asked me if I went to Sydney,Australia for my backpack. Of course, I only got it from McDonalds. She was cute, though. Her hair was done up in a way that made her look like she just came from elementary school, and I guess if any other girl attempted this look, they'd look really bad, but it looked cute, and playful on her.

There was this other girl, playing DDR, who had crazy endurance. She, like, played Paranoia Survivor (or one of the many variations of the Paranoia song series) over and over again until I left. Bear in mind that this was over the course of, like, six separate games she played of DDR. She was really short, though, and I don't think she was Asian.

<sigh> If only they'd remake Ridge Racer Type 4 for the arcade, I'd totally own EVERYONE at it. <Sigh> An arcade rendition of ZOE 2 would also kick much ass, as would I, if I played it.

At PIP, this troupe of theatre performers were doing a rendition of Shakespeare's ""Julias Ceasar"". It was . . . alright, I guess. I didn't see much of it. The only reason I'll remember it was because of that one guy in the play who was dressed startlingly similar to Bayman, from DOA3 (OMG Nigel, I'm not even kidding)

And that's it for me today!

"event","Today I had the opportunity to hang out with Nigel. In between a rigourous work schedule, and visiting my dad at the hospice, I don't see my 'friends' as often as one would like. 

We sat down and watched a movie together, ""The Big Lebowski"". This movie is seriously funny, and one I wasn't much expecting to like. Basically the plot revolves around this deadbeat who is referred to throughout the movie as ""The Dude"", who has his nice carpet peed on by a thug (""It tied the room together!""). Thereafter, he goes on an elaborate quest to locate a replacement rug, making friends with such greats as Steve Buscemi, and John Goodman. Ths cast was rounded out by the stereotypical rich, yet gibbled billionare (who shares a name with the main character), and his young wife Bunny (""I'll suck your cock for $1000 . . . ""). Great movie, that one.

Before we watched said movie, Nigel's mother wanted us to go shopping with her, so I ended up going out to Family Foods, and doing a bit of weekly shopping with Nigel's family. It was kind of fun. Afterwards, Mrs. Davis offered me money for all of my help. This shocked me, but the thought that someone would actually accept it shocked me more. I simply said, ""No thank you, your satisfaction is reward enough for me"".

Now it's almost 12:00am, and it's raining heavily. Whenever it rains now, I get really depressed, which is very uncharacteristic of me, especially considering the fact that I do so love the rain. 

As I sit here, waiting for the Gundam Seed OVA to finish downloading, I'm listening to DDR music, namely Smile.dk's ""Dragonfly"", and ""Speed Over Beethoven"", by an unknown artist. Actually, to be honest, I'm not sure if Smile.dk's ""Dragonfly"" ever made it into any DDR version

Sometimes I wonder about DDR. I mean, a huge portion of the song selection (from all DDR versions) are done by third party groups. Only a couple songs are done by Konami's in-house music band. This makes me wonder what kind of negotiations take place, for Konami to be able to use all these artist's songs in their game? I mean, do the artists themselves get a share of the revenue generated by these machines? Or do they do it for free (Now that I think about it, having their song in the game is almost like free advertising. Assuming of course, that neither party gets paid)?

Songs that I think should be in the next DDR? A whole ton of Initial D songs come to mind, almost instantaneously. Maybe some songs from Gundam Seed (""Believe"", and ""Resolution"", namely""). ""Anime Ja Nai"", from ZZ Gundam would also kick a lot of ass. ""Cotton Eye Joe"" by the RedNex would also be good.

I've been thinking of Michelle lately, mostly what she said about her boyfriend, Matt. Apparently, he gave her a spare set of keys to his house/apartment. So what happens when/if they break up? It'd be very awkward to ask for those back. Also, why would anyone do that? The only way I'd ever give a girl (or anyone) an extra set of keys to my house woud be, like, if they were having severe family problems, situations where it'd be dangerous for them to stay there any longer. And I'd only do so if I knew I trusted them (it takes at least 4 years for that kind of trust to 'bloom', if that's even the right word).

I've tried calling Sammi recently, but she never answers anymore. I think that maybe she's annoyed with me. I don't know . . . 

I was supposed to burn Goldenboy onto disc for Douglas (manager of my current place of emplyoment), but I accidentally deleted iMesh, and along with it, several hundred episodes of Gundam (almost every series, save for maybe V, Wing and X), a (relatively) small amount of mp3's, and said Goldenboy episodes.

Speaking of Gundam, Sunrise is producing a sequel to Gundam Seed. Tentatively titled, ""Gundam Seed: Destiny"", the storyline reportedly shares many similarities to Zeta Gundam. The most notable instance in which these similarities are present is how the previous antagonists are now the good guys (Shades of A.E.U.G, Batman!!).

As far as mech designs go, some of the ones that I've seen are REALLY bad. This is because Kunio Okawara is returning yet again. No offense to the man, but he's worked on almost every single Gundam series to date, and his designs started getting stale with G Gundam. I wish they'd hire in some fresh talent, namely Hajime Katoki, or Junya Ishigaki. Again, Okawara is a legend of Gundam history, but his designs get worse with each new Gundam series. 

Hisashi Hirai (Scryed, Gundam Seed) returns as primary character designer, a fact that I'm not happy about. His designs for Seed left a lot to be desired, and every character looks the same, only with different hair, and or eyes. The main character of Seed: Destiny, Shin Asuka, reportedly looks identical to Kira Yamato, only with black hair.

I shouldn't complain, though. Although Gundam Seed had many factors working against it (the fact that Mitsuo Fukuda directed it was one, as was the main theme of the show, being 'friendship'), it was still a respectable effort, one that was very enjoyable at times (although far from being the best Gundam). We'll see how Seed: Destiny does.

And that's it for today!

"event","Oh shit, I forgot to write about that little 'incident' at the bar. It's really a long story, but to make it short, this girl punched me for staring at her boyfriend. Kind of embarassing, but . . . . 

Today was really kind of a mixed bag. On one hand, Troy came back from working at the Porter House down in Cochrane, and he was so excited about it (""It's sooooo classy, dude!!!"") that he could hardly contain himself. He kept telling me how much better it is down there, as opposed to it's sister bar (the one where I currently work). In any event, I hope I did a good job of running everything today. It was a doozy, but I got through the day. Finished prepping and all that good stuff. Also 'cleaned house' like a motherfucker. I think I did a good job. The suits upstairs (the guys in charge of running the place) wanted the whole establishment to be fuckin' IMMACULATE, and we delivered on that promise.

<sigh> Poor Kayleigh. She's so pretty, but she's, like, angry at the world or something. I've only ever seen her smile once, and I must admit, it's most likely the prettiest smile I've ever seen (next to my own, of course). I don't think she likes me very much.

Shawn and Leona finally had their baby!! I'm so happy for them! It's a girl, which is a relief. Little boys annoy me, but little girls are just so cute!! Congratulations, you two! Another resource-consuming kid on an already over-populated planet! No, I'm kidding, I'm really happy for them.

In spite of all the happiness that comes from the baby, there still is the ever-present shadow, cast by the fact that my father's death is indeed iminent. I remember how he used to be, very strict, and taciturn, but also very kind, and warm-hearted. Now, he's . . . . . derelect. It's really sad to just watch him move about his room, with that blank stare in his eyes, and not really responding to any stimuli (or is that stimulus? Can never remember). He can barely think for himself anymore.

His work buddies really admired and respected him. Every single one of his friends have gone to see him, and it must break their hearts to see how far he's fallen. Still, it's touching, in a way. He must've been a really important part of their lives . . . It really causes me to wonder . . .

There's another reason I'm depressed now. Kristin just called me a few minutes ago. Why does she do this to me? Just when I think I've forgotten my intense love for her (or what little of it remains), hearing her voice causes those emotions to swell up again. I mean, before this, there was a whole year in between, where I almost convinced myself that she was never really worth the effort. I almost rid myself of her memory. Then she calls, ""to see how you're doing"". Well, I WAS doing just fine, thank you.

Damn it. Too many emotions running through my head to think clearly. I'm outta here.

"event","Aaron and I chanced upon Michelle the other day, at Eau Claire. She was really angry with me for calling her a hooch. She, like, kicked me, and then tried to scratch my eyes out with her demon-like claws. Then she lashed me with her whip (which was made of fire, by the way). Moral of the story: Women are scary! 

Played pool with Aaron that day, too. Aaron made the most beautiful shot ever. He was lined up for a shot with the '8' ball, and he fires off the shot. The pool cue goes right over the cue ball, and he pulls it back, which causes the ball to go right into the hole behind the ball. It's a little difficult to describe, but rest assured it was most likely the funniest thing EVER.

We also went down to HMV, where I saw the rare Clerks Animated series boxset, for $19.99. I would've bought it, if not for the fact that I needed money for the 2nd Ver. Dom MSiA figure. I did, however, pick up the Full-Armour Gundam MSiA. I wasn't expecting much from it, seeing as how it's basically the RX-78-2 figure, with removable armour. And seeing as how I already own the basic RX-78-2 figure (on which the Full-Armour version is based), I thought it was a bad decision at first. Then I opened that bitch up, and was startled by how much they improved on the figure, without changing it's looks too much (aside from the colour scheme). For starters, articulation is no longer a problem, with the less restrictive skirt armour, and the ankles are actually 2x jointed, which result in some spectacular foot mobility (mind you, it's still nowhere nearly as great as the sheer craziness that is the Shining Gundam's ankle articulation). The original ""ver. 1.5"" Gundam figure suffered from it's detachable waist, an action feature used to recreate it's core block mechanism from the show. The pegs used for holding the upper and lower torsos together have been lengthed, and now the figure doesn't come apart as easily! I was really happy with this particular point.

I just can't wait for that damn 2nd Ver. Dom to arrive . . . .

"event","Today kicked ass. Hung out with Aaron and we walked around downtown (like we always do). At Eau CLaire, we ran afoul of Marc (I contemplated the notion of sticking my tongue out at him), and Kristin. We also saw Michelle, and surprise, she wasn't with another guy today. I guess she isn't the hooch I always thought her to be. Anyways, she dropped by to see us while we were playing House of the Dead 2. She's a nice girl.

We found out that we weren't able to play pool on the 'daddy' tables (as I call them), so we had to play on the economy sized ones. Our table had a broken mechanism, so we had to ask the cashier to help us out with that. I thought that she was rather cute! Sort of absent-minded, but that only adds to a person's charm, in my opinion. I won that game of pool, by the way. Also, we played DDR on the broken machine, and as a result, I ended up failing Senorita. 

I picked up more Gundam-flavoured Pepsi Twist!! That stuff rules all! The special edition bottlecap I got this time was the Elmeth, flown by Lalah Sune, in the later half of the first Gundam Series. Then, of course, Amuro killed her (he didn't know it was her inside), and so kicked off the famous enmity between Amuro and Char. I also happened to pick up some more of those packages of Gundam candies, the ones that include a miniature gundam figure. Combining toys with candy is probably the greatest idea ever.

Afterwards, we hit TD Square. Being the weekend, Every store closed early. Aaron had been pining to go to TD Square since our trip began. Finally we go there, and EVERYTHING was closed. Besides us, there was nary a sould to be seen wandering the thick corridors of the place. We decided to head outside, to go home, but the damn door had locked already. We looked around for an alternate exit, but at every turn, we were foiled by the doors' autolock function. I think we wandered around for about 7 hours (re: 20 mins) before Aaron started panicking. Every exit was barred, and even I was beginning to lose hope. ""Let's try the Parkade exit,"" Aaron exclaimed. ""That door definitely won't be locked!"". Surprise, surprise. It was. Aaron and I just had to laugh then. After all, this was the sort of thing that only happens in sitcoms and pornos (""Hey, baby, lookes like it's up to you and me to repopulate this place!""). Another 10 minutes pass, and we're still wandering around. We turned a corner, and I was thinking to myself that I might need to, like, eat Aaron in order to survive (""Circle of Life, bitch!! HAHAHAHAHA!""). But just then, we ran into a security guard who directed us to what was very likely the ONLY door left unlocked, and we finally made it to freedom.

For some reason, this whole ordeal reminded me of that time I got trapped in a stalled elevator with this incredibly fat guy, who after 20 minutes, decided to crack painfully unfunny jokes. It almost hurt to laugh at some of the things he joked about, but I didn't want to hurt his feelings. 

Now I'm home again, and have to put up with my two annoying cousins. God, they're being inconsiderate . . . .

"event","The days' events left upon me a need for personal reflection. I was at the hospice today, where Dad is. I feel really bad for him. He must miss his home, being comfortable with us. 

I did see something I'll never forget. I was on my way to my father's room, when I passed this one room where two EMS guys were carting out somebody in a bodybag. This poor soul had just died, apparently. I remember looking in his room about 1/2 an hour before and seeing this person putting on his shoes. I've often wondered what it's like to die, and not being in the comfort of your own home when you do break the barrier between life and whatever lies beyond. Does one feel lonely before the reaper comes to collect your soul? Is it a sense of accomplishment (for a life fully lived)? Or is it a great feeling of remorse, to look back on your life, and all the opportunities that one passed up? 

I wonder why I'm thinking about death like this? Maybe it stems from a deep fear of the unknown and misunderstood (there's nothing quite as misunderstood as death). No one really knows what's beyond life, so it kind of feels like . . . . a risk, I don't know. Well, no, maybe not a risk. There's no escaping death; there's no 'risk' involved.

One of my father's work buddies called today, to see how my parents are holding up. He mentioned to me that my mother had told him what a ""great help"" I've been through these troubling times. He said that, if my father was still capable of independent thought, he'd be proud of me. I've never had to handle being complimented on such a thing before. For some reason, it makes me feel like I could be doing more, but I don't know why.

Now onto a more light-hearted subject. After I left the hospice, I decided to take a refreshing walk through Riley Park. It was great to see everyone out there, enjoying the summer heat, and taking full advantage of the weather. I noticed a mother playing frisbee with her daughter (they looked so cute together!), and the little waterpark located nearby was chock-full of people. Even if I wanted to go for a little dip, I don't think they'd have room.

I went to Eau Claire today, to play DDR. I did alright today. I've never claimed to be good at the game, but I've advanced greatly from when I first started playing. Strangely, I didn't even go near the Virtual ON machine. I think I've grown tired of it. If only they'd import a couple of VO: Oratario Tangram machines, I'd be in arcade heaven.

I went to Chinatown to see if they got in my 2nd ver. Dom, but, alas, it's a no go. I'm kind of getting fed up with waiting, but as it turns out, I'll be waiting a bit longer, while it gets through customs. Since they didn't have it in, I decided to purchase these collectible Diet Pepsi Twists which come with special edition Gundam bottle cap toppers. Basically, they fit over the bottle cap itself, and there's a little non-scale Gundam figurine on top. I got a special deal (3 bottles for $10), and I walked away with two Char's Zaku II and a mini-bust of Amuro Ray (pilot of the original Gundam). I think the Amuro mini-bust is my favorite so far.  

I wanted to go shopping with Nigel for some new shoes today (we're both in dire need of new pairs), but he was unavailable. What a donkey-fucker. Just kidding! I loves me some Nigel!!

And that's it!

"event","I am back from the day's events!! My journey started at about 9:30 in the morning. Last time I worked, it was so busy that I had no time to check the work schedule to see when I work next. Being a prudent person, I set out to go into the pub and check said schedule. I wasn't sure whether or not they had scheduled me in for that day, and luckily, they didn't. I decided to blow the day riding around, getting some exercise. Taking the long course home, I decided that I should go to Eau Claire Market, maybe play some DDR. I suddenly changed my mind halfway there. I won't say why . . . .

I did happen to see the funniest thing EVER on my way home. I passed a group of townhouses, and this one house had one of those giant trampolines on their lawn. A group of 3 kids are jumping around on it, and this one kid is doing tricks, y'know, backflips and stuff. At one point he jumps particularily high and rebounds off at a weird angle, and does this incredible herkey-jerky thing in mid-air before landing square on his back on the grass beside the trampoline. He was all like, ""Ah, darn!"". If he were older, I'm guessing it would've been like, ""Ah, FUCK!""

I decided to go home and call Nigel up, see if he wanted to go to BlockBuster with me to return Kingdom Hearts (what a charming game that is!). We went, and we returned it, but I had, like, $30 in late fees and other miscellaneous charges. Nigel had some late fees that were left from when his Brother Evan rented Spider Man 2 and Manhunt. He wasn't too happy about paying these late fees. We decided to rent the first season of ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"". Made by the co-writer of Seinfield, it is a hilarious show. I honestly wasn't looking forward to it at all, but I was really surprised by how offbeat and funny it was. Afterwards, we played Halo, and talked about how much Halo 2 is going to kick fucking ass. Fable is also very much anticipated. I honestly can't wait for Kingdom Hearts 2 and Metroid Prime 2.

Lesse, I work on Wednesday, so I think that, tomorrow, I shall spend the day cleaning up the house while my mother is away. I'd like to visit my father in the hospice, but I don't wanna see him like that. I don't know if that's selfish of me, but that's how I feel . . .

"event","Today kicked so much ass. I had to work at 11:30 in the morning. No big deal, only I don't seem to be improving when it comes to running the kitchen in the morning. Later in the day, I can handle it, and it's no trouble for me to close the kitchen, but it's an entirely different matter to open it up in the morning . . . . 

After work, I decided to hang out with Matt. It only started out as a trip to his house to drop off the $10 I owed him from before, but then he asked if I wanted to go with him to return some movies. We both set out, and upon arriving at Roger's Video, we decided to rent two more. In the end, we chose to get Godzilla vs Mecha-Godzilla, and X-Men (the first one).

Godzilla vs MechaGodzilla kicked sooooooooooooooo much ass. Aside from having the best pickup line EVER written into the script, it had some wonderfully corny fight scenes, the likes of which could only be seen in bad Asian cinema. I especially liked how MechaGodzilla had verniers all over it's body (or is that chassis?), and thus resembled a Gundam while in flight. It was awesome.

X-Men was decent. As a superhero flick, it does surprisingly well. Great cast of characters that represent(s) their comic-book namesakes very well (my favorite being Jean Grey, only because she's a redhead, and kind of cute. 

We also rented Jedi Outcast for Xbox. It's a pretty good game all around, and it's especially fun once you get the lightsaber. Pushing the 'secondary fire' button cause to throw your lightsaber around, and after it completes it's arc, it returns to you like a boomerang. This is soooo much fun to use against those damn stormtroopers. The only problem with this is that sometimes my partner would get in the way of it's predetermined throwing arc, reulting in her getting killed. This happened often, and as a result, I just started killing her on purpose, out of frustration.

And that's about it . . .

"event","First day of the motherfucking Stampede (mo' like Damnpede! OMG LOL), and this always leaves me annoyed for several reasons: 1) I hate crowds, 2) Annual festivites annoy me, and 3) it costs too much to get dressed up when the whole thing only lasts for a week or so. Sure, seeing town spirit is kind of uplifting, but soon it just gets annoying. Bah, cowboys!

I hung around with Aaron today. We had lunch at the Noodle Place (I'm still unable to finish that damn bowl of whatever-it-is. Yeah, my stomachs' a pussy). After that, we toured Eau Claire, and made fun of Rastafarians, and played some DDR. I was finally able to pass 8 footer Senorita, which I was surprised about. I played it on a whim as my 4th and final song, and wasn't expecting to get very far, but in the end, I kicked that song's ass, netting myself a 'B' ranking. This compliments my beating of 8 footer Era quite nicely. 

I saw Michelle today again. I never noticed before, but she looks a hell of a lot like Rinoa, from FFVIII (a character that I hated. Not that I'll hold it against her . . . ). She was with some asian guy. She seems to have a new boyfriend every couple of days. Y'know, of course, this is assuming he IS her boyfriend. For all I know, he could be just a friend. I don't know for sure.

Damn DDR pads were busted. I had to make due with the one DDR machine in the corner, the one that nobody really plays anymore.

I decided to check out Chinatown today. As I suspected, my 2nd Ver. Dom hadn't come in yet. I'm kinda annoyed that it's still stuck at customs. This is the same fate that my MSiA Devil Gundam and 2nd Ver. Zeta Gundam suffered . . . 

I almost ran over a little girl on my rollerblades, while riding home. She just sort of ran into the way, and I had to careen myself into a lamp post to keep from hitting her. She was awfully cute, though. I'd be sad if I collided with her. 

Oh, man. I've gotta work tomorrow morning. I'm not really looking forward to it. It's the stampede, and I'll be most likely flooded with food orders tomorrow. God knows I'm not the fastest cook ever. I'd really like to work with Matt, in Canadian Wholesale, but I'm not exactly sure what it is they do. Oh well. He says that his co-worker Thomas isn't the best worker, so he might not last long. If that's the case, then I'll definitely apply there. I'm not fond of the kitchen environment.  

Well, that's it for me . . .

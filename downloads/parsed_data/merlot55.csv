Man!
Is it ever dusty in here!

I do plan to post to the Mother list about my experiences at Left Coast Crime, in an abrieviated form.(in an attempt to prevent a mass desertion of 4MA(or should that be deletion? <G>)
Those who know me, know that I am seldom shy and have long since given up on avoiding embarrassing myself- sort of goes with the territory.
I have copied and pasted the 4MA post and added a * thingie to denote extras.

Here goes!

Do any of you remember the wonderful preformance that Lee Marvin
contributed to the film Cat Ballou?

I can quote him- "" OHH!! It was swell, just swell!""

I had the most fun I have had since my wedding in 1985.

My intent is to sum up the experience- excercizing a WHOLE LOT of
restraint and using point form.
For the whole enchilada, go to my live journal (see end of message)


Wednesday-
-Pick up Sandra Ruttan , Jen Nightingale-Ethier and daughter T-1 from
Highschool.
-Transport said daughter to dance class and head to Seattle!
-With careful navigation from Sandra, we arrived at our hotel at
about 6:10- plenty of time to make the 6:30 4MA dinner deadline.
-Arrive at dinner about 7 PM, after circling the hotel block via one
way streets and then checking into the valet parking at the wrong
hotel.
- have wonderful time meeting other members and score the latest Ian
Rankin book as a doorprise.
* We all got our names drawn for doorprises, which included lots of books(no suprise there), chocolate(ditto) and miscellania(included Mr Monkey lapel pins and a tinfoil hat- can't imagine how that got there)
- return to bar at con hotel, have terrific conversation with member
Moyra T. about writing romances- amoung other things.

Thurs-

-Went shopping in the AM for wine,coffee and chocolate- the
essentials of life- and found out just how similar Seattle and San
Fransisco are vis a vis that 'hill' thing.
* I had to stop every block and sit down. Like San Fran, everything is uphill, downhill or underwater.

-registered, found hospitality suite- where all the cool folks hang
out, and received a whold bag full of books! Got MORE books from
other 4MA-ers who thought I might like them. I must be paper-
magnetic

* I swear everytime I turned around, folks were giving me books! It was all I could do not to swoon! Very generous with other stuff, too. Donna Moore bought me a Betty Boop sign!

- hung out in bar, metting folks and ajournded to our crummy
hotel- long story- to drink more wine and bond with roomie Jen, until
2 AM.
* I will NEVER arrange accomodation like this again. I wanted to pay cash, but it was impossible. I have no credit card, so we had to fax my hubbie for authorization. ACK! Guess what I'M going to do tomorrow?

Friday
-Started the day with my most embarrassing moment(Are you suprised it
took this long? <G>)
When I walked into the hospitality room in serch of caffeine, there
was a man in a kilt pouring himself a cup of coffee. Now that's a
sight you don't see every day!
Merlot: ""Now that's something I like to see! A man confident enough
to wear a kilt!
ARE you Scottish?""
Well, as I found out as soon as he opened his mouth, he was. Being
Scottish Author Peter May, and all.
He was most gracious and forgiving, luckily.
* And drop dead gorgeous- right Kim? <G>

-About panels
I was sensible enough to not try to attend EVERYTHING, and found out
that the best panels are the ones you go to by mistake!
* Got caught in the wrong room for one, and followed Pappa Cook to another in one of the small side rooms-Profanity in crime fiction- turned into an interesting intimate disscussion, where I found out just how smart Sandra Ruttan REALLY is!
-sat next to a lovely lady who turned out to be Kate Flora! And I
wasted all that time talking about our kids!
* That panel I attended by mistake was called CS I don't think so! It debunked a lot of forensic info that television and film perpetrate on us- a real eye opener.

* I also gave her the 'line' about middle age women not being able to wear sleeveless tops because of flying squirrel arms- AND SHE WROTE IT DOWN!!!
-went out for lunch in the afternoon, and found a hat store-.What to
do, what to do? Food is over-rated- decided to blow the dinner budget
on a spectacular hat and more books!

- bar- again- fell asleep in corner
* I swar, I was only resting my eyes!
-auction and reception- no money- see hat shopping above
* much thanks to Bob Fate for telling me about the room behind me where the real food was- DUH!
* also met Fran Reads friend,(Pam?) who came up, introduced herself, and claimed her hug! Too cool for school!

-Most Gob-stopping moment

At the Friday night reception, Maddy caught my arm as I was going by,
and said to the man beside her, ""Here's Merlot!""
""Merlot!"" he said, in a tone that implied that he knew who I was.
I looked at his nametag to see that he was(and still is, hopefully)
author Con Lehane. Apparently, he lurks on 4MA.
ACK! Con Lehane knows who I am! After I shovelled my jaw off the
floor, I must have made some mumbling acknowlegement, and crept off.

- THE MWA(mystery Writers of America) knows how to throw a party!
We went through Seattle's Underground Tour, and I had a blast
vollying riposts from Grandma Rose. More about this elsewhere...ahem.

* It was like this.
Seattles industry in the late 1800s was logging and prostitution.
The city fathers decided to tax the 'girls' $10 per month. This soon made up 87% of the city's revenue. They couldn't put 'prostitute' on the books, though, so they called them seamstresses. (Sounds of suppressed laughter from the attendeding 4MA members) By the time our guide began talking about notorious 'madams' I thought Rose would explode!
Luckily, no one who had been on the tour that didn't know me asked me what I did for a living.

-More wine back at our room-hic
* Jen now knows all my deepest, darkest secrets. If she grasses, I will have to kill her.

Saterday-
-went to 10 AM panel on Noir, with only a slight hangover- most
appropriate, I thought.
-Had lunch in hosp suite with 4MA-ers, educated Troy Cook in the art
of 4MA shoe appreciation
* Troy pointed out to me that I had tipped my costumers hand by showing him two pairs of members shoes within 10 minutes. I apologized for assuming he looked the sort to have a shoe fettish. But both Donnas shoes, and MommyKims boots were worthy of a second glance.

-cabbed it to the Seattle Mystery Bookstore where some authors were
signing, smoozed with Bob Fate, Troy and Bruce Cook, and Deni Deitz,
among others. Bought Dame Near Dead:Solitary Drinker by Con Lehane:
Deni's book, Tie a Lambchop to the Bed, Peter Mays new book, and
rushed back to the con to catch The Liars panel at 3PM
* Vast apologies to Bob Fate for telling Deni that I could lend her his books.
 In a book store.
 At one of his signings.
Ouch.
Sorry ,Bob. I'm still in the lending library thought pattern. Forgive me?

-The Liars panel was a complete hoot! It featured S.J Rozan( a
dynamo!), Barry Eisler(easy on the eyes),Meg Chittenden(I SO want to
be her when I grow up!) and a very funny swedish author I've never
heard of! Who-ie Nessler?
The audience poses the questions, the panelists replied, and we had
to guess who was lying by a show of hands! Very funny, wonderful time
had by all!
-Then real life/Fictional crime, with Troy Cook, Colin Campbell, and
Kate Flora. Troy knows FAR too much about the Mafia , IMHO.
-finally- the banquet! Good company, Donna's Lefty award, and a most
bizarre song medly by author Parnell Hall.
* Rose and I sang the Tinfoil hat song quietly at our table,too!
Brian Wiprud said he liked my hat!
-the bar(yet again) Con Lehane signed my book,and I had my picture
taken with Mr Monkey- yah!

Sunday-
-missed the last panel due to hotel check out issues- still part of
long story.
-had a quiet lunch with Rose, Pam and MommyKim
-sat in the lobby and read a third of Con Lehanes The Solitary
Drinker-ahh! Reading again!!
-went for dinner at the Wild Ginger with the remnants of the 4MA
crowd who were still about. Wonderful food, wonderful company!

Monday
-smuggled approximately $200 of free books through the border.

Will I go again?

Damn straight!

4MA-ers are quite the nicest people on the entire planet. At no time
did I ever feel that I couldn't approach anyone- author or reader.
I love you all!
I don't dare name names for fear of leaving someone out.
* But I will!
I wish I could have spent more time with Ann C., Sheila Lowe and Pari. Special hugs to Bob Fate, The Cooks, Donna, Lynne, Lisa, MommyKim, Deni, Rose and Jen.
But you know who you are!

Merlot- home safe and sound
And all talked out!!!
Sorry, can't figure out the spell check- hope you can adjust!"

"event","Hi there!
Did you think I( like Marley) was 'dead as a doornail'?

Though I enjoy hammering out these missifs(groan), I have learned that I would make a poor writer indeed, without some sort of deadline imposed on me.

Which brings me to the subject at hand; the mother of all deadlines, Christmas, December 25th. No substitutions accepted.

I can't understand why this holiday is so hard to tame. I have the religious end down- multiple church services,(I'm in the choir- must be why I'm developing a sore throat; it's about that time) that wrap up with a moving candlelight service on Christmas night.

I have only my immediate family to bestow gifts upon, and no entertaining to do this year until our annual openhouse in January. So what do I have to whine about? Well you may ask!

Nothing.

Over the years I have come to terms with my devil-may-care attitude to finance which leaves me shopping frantically with the mostly male last minute shoppers. Since there seems to be nothing I can do about this, I have adopted the 'challenge' philosophy and a down right cheerful attitude.

The challenge is this! After paying the bills on the 23rd(last payday before Christmas!) I will sally forth with the remnants of my bank account, and spend roughly 10 hours  distributing it. 

This drastic deadline accomplishes two things. It forces me to FOCUS!
 Lists, destinations in geographical order and possession of a BACKUP PLAN(stop at the book or liquor store!-works for me)

It also limits overspending- there is only so much cash and a certain amount of time in which to spend it.

Sure, I have every North American womans dream of a perfect Christmas. Gifts lovingly selected and carefully wrapped by mid October, cookies baked(and frozen) by Nov.15 and the house cleaned and tastefully decorated by Dec 1 in time for advent. But is is just that- a dream.

Real life is messy, last minute and cheerfully chaotic- at least mine is.

The outcome is always the same.

1 AM Christmas morning finds me, sitting - stockings stuffed- down to a glass of scotch and a reaquaintance with Mr. Dickens Christmas Carol, or Daymon Runyans Dancing Dans Christmas, or perhaps one of Ring Larders Christmas short stories. My family knows that I have loved them to the best of my ability, and we are togeather, safe and warm.

 
That's  my real gift on Christmas morning- the first gift from the first Christmas.

Love.

Merry Christmas!"

"event","The french said it. If I weren't so lazy, I'd look it up. 

The gist is- 'The more things change, the more they stay the same'

Sort of sums up my recent anniversary holiday with my husband of 20 years. The decision was made to re-trace the tracks  of our honeymoon trip. 

Do I hear an ""Aaaawwwww!""?

 HA! Just wait.

I have said before that Bob is a great guy. Part of the reason that our marriage has lasted so long, is our ability to overlook each others faults. (Although, none of mine come to mind at the moment.....)
Still, one can't help but notice some less than charming character flaws over the years. One of which is my darlings faulty sense of timing.

A few weeks before our trip, the following conversation took place.

Bob: ""You know, dear, we're going away on holiday soon. I was kind of dissapointed in you, you never gave me any input into it.""

Merlot:"" Huh?""(Well, I was reading!)

Bob: ""It's just that when I was planning the trip and making our camping reservations, you didn't sound very interested.""

Merlot:(Thinking very hard)"" And that was WHEN, exactly?""

Further exploration revealed that the reservations were made on the 27 of June.

Merlot:"" While that explains it! T-1's graduation dinner/dance was on the 28th, I was a tad preoccupied.""

Said graduation involved preparations on par with the cononation of a minor monarch, and I spent the last few days before it finishing the dress, chaufering to/from multiple hair appointments, and preparing for out of town company that were scheduled to arrive on- TA DAAA! -June 29th.

Bob:(Voice heavy with dissappointment) ""Well, I wanted to include you ""

Now- here's the rub.

I KNOW that he LIES.

Many road trips with Bob have lead me to the following conclutions.

A) He WILL NOT stop the vehicle unless it requires gas. Unless the dog is tap dancing (complete with sequins,top hat and cane) in the backseat.

B)He does not require food while traveling. He will begrudgingly prepare coffee on the mornings that we are breaking camp, but that it. I learned long ago to prepare sandwiches for lunch and stash them in the cooler in the TRUCK- not the fridge in the tent trailer- think about it.

C)He will avoid any suggestion I make re: points of interest with the following comments. ""Are you crazy? I'll never get the truck and trailer in there!"" , or "" Well, if we have time""

So, therefore on my holiday  I did not see Canon Beach(see C above), the historic district of Port Townsend (same thing) or any 'historical point of interest ahead' s.(A)

My friend Jen says that her fella is the exact opposite(he stops for everything- probably takes pictures, too-sigh) and that it is equally annoying. I would be willing to trade her, just for the novelty.

Luckily, my job on these trips is to navigate, and 'thorough Bob' provides excellent road maps. ""Cause you just KNOW what would happen if he got lost, don't you? :-)"

"event","I'm supposed to be cleaning my house.

Instead, or more acurately. during a neccesary break, I am writing about it.

Imagine my suprise- and delight!-when I read the opening sentence in Dean James book, Decorated to Death. His protag is a vampire, who is also a writer.

""Dead people hate housework just like everybody else"" Hmmm. 

I really have aways hated cleaning. From  the adolescent days, when my mother(who worked a 8-4, Mon to Fri day job) would roust me out of bed on a Saterday morning, because it was Saterday and time to CLEAN!

Later, when I lived on my own, there was always something more interesting to do.(Well, that's still true!) And I was rarely home enough to get it dirty.

Then came marriage and children and ....the dog. Don't get me wrong, I love them all, but HAY-SUESS! That dog sheds so much, I am amazed that she has any hair left!!! And I have noticed an alarming development recently, on the cleaning front.
 
It's getting damn difficult to do. Levering myself down to and up from the floor requires twice as much effort  than it used to. And furthermore, after 30 minutes of toil, I'm dripping with perspiration. I can think of a much more enjoyable way to work up a sweat, thankyou very much!

So here I am.
 Sweaty, grumpy and achey- and I still have a dirty house! And at the back of my mind is the knowledge that ,no matter how long I work at it- it will all need cleaning again next week- month- and for years to come!
Oh, well. Crank up the fast tunes, and take my best shot at it.

And fantacize about puting Mollymaid on the speed dial."

"event","It's been quite a year for my eldest daughter.
12 years of work,play, friends and foes have resulted in graduation.
Last month was exciting- Cinderella goes to the ball, transformed from jeans and t-shirt into heels and a swath of silk. Make up, hair, nails- perfection!

But that was last month.

The next step on her lifes journey? You guessed it, employment. Not wanting to be labeled a nag, I have refrained from pushing the point.(other than singing the well known Sillouettes refrain to her whenever she asks me for money-""get a job-sha na na na, sha na na na na!"")

Yesterday, however, on my travels, I came upon a retail shoe store that is hiring. I brought home an application. Was that pushy? I think not.

This morning, after much grumbling whilst filling out the form, she left with her father to go grocery shopping, intending to stop on the way and hand in her resume.

Now I must tell you, that my daughter is not a stupid girl. Mrs. Young didn't raise no dummies. So you tell me why she left the house wearing cargo jeans, a biker hat and a black t-shirt featuring a skull and cross bones. She DID ask me to iron an overshirt, which I fervently pray she keeps buttoned.

When I rolled my eyes frantically at my husband, he told me to knock it off, and off they went.

I don't recall being that reluctant to find employment. The paycheck, however modest, was carrot enough to keep me eagerly searching until I landed a job. I only want my dearest dear to experience the humbling effects of public service and minimum wage.

After six month of retail in the real world, I know she will be serious about persuing an education.
But first, we have to get there."

"event","My Husband's mid life crisis is sitting in our driveway.

It's a little black Tracker with a sun roof and removeable hard top. The horrific cost of the gas guzzled by his pick-em up truck on his  two hour daily commute, was the official excuse for purchasing the toy truck.

Bob's a great guy, y'know. He lives in a house with three women- one in puberty, one in menopause and one in between.  He spoils me rotten (I have a tendency to 'still think I'm the cutest trick in shoe leather'),and has set the bar very high for his daughters prospective beaux.He lives among cats,shoes and chaos, and he rarely complains.

He is also true-blue. So his crisis-of-choice is half a ton of plastic, metal and rubber instead of 110 pounds of nubile flesh. For which I am very grateful- because if he left me for a bimbo, I would have to think up truely horrible ways to make him suffer, which would cut into my reading time.

So when he asked me yesterday afternoon, if I would care to take a drive, I was thrilled!
There we were. Two middle aged folks, blasting down the backroads, top down, and The Eagles 'Hell Freezes Over' on the CD player- very loud!

It was only a 30 minute drive (which included a stop at the library), but for me time stood still. I remember the thrill of cruisin' when I was a teen. No worries, see where the road takes you.

Now it doesn't matter where the road takes us,  the worries are always waiting in the wings, but as long as I can go along for the ride, I'm a happy woman."

"event","I have always considered myself a fairly low maintenance woman.

My husband, Bob, rarely has reason to complain about excessive spending on my part.(Except for books, of course, but he's just as bad as I am)

But one never knows, do one?

Thursday past, I decided to use part of my birthday gift from my best buds- a trip to Spa Utopia for a pedicure(it being sandal season, and all).

Holy Molely! Thomas More must be spinning in his grave!

Lush does not adequately describe the decore.Plants, tasteful artwork , dim lighting , soft music, and overstuffed furniture created a mood of comfortable oppulance. I was offered the option of wearing one of their fluffy terrycloth spa robes, but I declined, fearing I would be mistaken for Yeti and causing mass panic in their carefully tranquil atmosphere.

After a brief wait, with a glass of wine and a chapter of Sparkle Hayter, I was ushered into the 'treatment room"" and took a seat in THE CHAIR.

Words fail me. It looked somewhat like a padded dentist chair with an attatched foot bath. Sinking into it's comfortable leather embrace, I was struck by the thought that it probably cost more than the vehicle I am currently driving. When the eththet- eathset- LADY-WHO-WORKS-THERE,  began explaining the remote controls(yes-two!), I almost swooned!

The control in my left hand adjusted the angle of recline and the distance from the foot bath. The right hand control reined over the chairs massage and heat functions. I kid you not! After 15 minuted of nirvana in that chair, I was considering making them a trade offer for my truck, but then how would I get the chair home?

Wait a minute. Who said anything about going home?
 I figure I could saunter about from waiting room to waiting room, reading and drinking wine for at least 4 hours before they caught on and gave me the bum's rush( in a very refined way, of course)

The icing on the gateau came at the very end. While I was being pampered, the real world had a power outage, and the building was plunged into darkness. I had to stay for a quarter of an hour, to let my nail polish dry thoroughly, and I was led through candle lit hallways,(should have brought my peignoir) to a room at the back with windows, so that I could have light to read. Wasn't that thoughtful?

When I walked into the room, my fate was sealed. There before me was a faux leopard skin covered 'fainting couch'.No one else was in the room, but I would have used any ruse, (short of yelling fire! )to recline there.
Back to my original statement about high maintenence women. This is a life style to which I would gladly become accustomed.A tad pretentious, perhaps, but I could always justify the expense by calling it 'research'. Or 'therapy'. 

I wounder if I could sneak that one past Revenue Canada?"

"event","I remember to the moment, the first time I noticed this annoying trend peculiar to North American Culture. At least, Dear God I hope so.

My oldest daughter was about 6. when I purchased a video for her viewing pleasure- The My Little Pony Movie. It only took one screening for me to notice that all the characters were screaming. Not squeals of excitement, but honest to God, THERE'S A SPIDER IN MY SALAD screaming.The six gazillion subsequent viewings did little to sooth my initial reaction (""What the Hell???!!!!"")

The mothers among us may remember the pregnacy phenomena. You know the one- the moment you became pregnant, you saw pregnant women everywhere. So it was with the screaming. It was on the playground( boys and girls both), on television- big suprise, Vana, and most annoyingly(that can't be a word, can it?) on radio.

Over the intervening years, I have not seen a reduction in this trend. I find it most annoying in connection with sports(large hairy jocks)and music 'fan events'(young adult women- teenage girls I can forgive, it's hormones)

Perhaps what REALLY bothers me is my knee jerk reaction perception of these folks. I immediately assume that they are either, boorish(the jocks) or ignorant(the girls)
O.K. I'll try to be generous here. Let's put this down to youthful exuberance. No? How about joi de vie?
Waxing philosophic for a mo, what is it in our fast paced  world that makes us think we have to scream to be heard?
So, desperate creatures caught in the frantic upheaval we call contemporary times?
Naw, I'm gonna' have to go with stupidity .

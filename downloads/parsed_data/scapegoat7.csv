"event","I'm messing around on the internet, and I'm taking random quizzes, right? so it's all really funny and i'm getting the screen to say Michelle's sexual nickname is ""pornstar butt"" and other stupid stuff. (I already typed this and I'll shorthand it now because it deleted 87% of my entry) I put in Brad as my name and my sentence is ""Uh, their against my religion."" I put in Lindsey and my sentence is ""What do you mean their against your religion?"""

"event","sorry i'm an ass Linz, i got in real late last night and was gonna go four-wheeler riding today(move all day references back one, it's past midnight...) so i tried to get some sleep so that my judgement or fragile sense of humor were not impaired. i failed miserably at all three. but on the plus side i'm only minorly scratched up from mudding and getting in a fight!! and when i go for an actual rematch tonight(friday night-this one's correct) there will be fabric gloves and feet pads for the kicks, so i can't get too fucked up. plus i'm gonna kick his ass, that helps with the not feeling pain part. oh-Sean, my cousin's ""boyfriend"" decided he wanted to piss me off and then swing on me- inbetween which i said i couldn't wait for him to learn how to read so that i could insult him better...so now we're both real pissed off and hate each other to the point of going to the community center and using a boxing ring as an excuse to try and knock the shit out of each other...he doesn't have the rage and therefore has no chance. i was fighting because he said mean things, he's fighting cause i dodged his dumbass charge and then knocked him on his ass. i love it...i bought four more c.d.'s- goo goo dolls: a boy named goo, everclear: so much for the afterglow, armor for sleep: what to do when you are dead, and seether: erm...can't remember which and too lazy to look.(not the title...) i'm sleepy.....*yawn*......again, sorry i didn't write last night....would you want my parents to maybe pick you up and take you to St. Francis park for the picking up of me-or would that be awkward?? a fair-sized chunk of my family is going to a seventy-fifth birthday party for some guy in my family-although i can't remember who- my grandparents are going, and so picking me up there is logical.....if that's wierd say so, but it's a couple hours we could have....put your answer in your comment to this, and if you want to and are not busy i'll call mrs. and mrs. adolf and try to hook it up. it would be like, eleven or noon that they picked you up probably(maybe slightly sooner..). i miss you. i thought about you while i was riding today, new topics and ""the same old stuff"" all the same. thinkin that picture as a bookmark is the worst idea ever...can't stop the yearning process....that part of the trip really sucks. everything else is even better than i wanted it to be....except for the sean thing.but then again it's not everyday that i get to choke a bitch...emo kicks ass- it's about all i've been listening to this whole time...if it wasn't for emo, this world would be a sad, sad place. everyone agree on three. now wasn't that nice?? Ah, the times i've said that....not really....i'm not a skank, no matter what percentage of Becky doesn't ever wash off......there should be two people laughing their asses off right now. you know who you are. you don't know about each other- but lindsey that isn't what it sounds like. i just came up with a new nickname for Linda: Monica. in the end, the bullshit didn't even come close to worth it!! well, fuck, that description goes for becky, too. but not the name. i never really lied about becky....at least i don't think....my memory goes a little....i'm not dodging anything i swear. but i am sleepy....kinda....i'll check this tonight(friday) at like, midnight or one, and if you want to go saturday my parents will call you in the morning. you may be able to ride with with jason up there, if you prefer. i'll tell them to tell you that that is an option if it is.k?   love ya babe, miss you like crazy!!!   -Brad                    (one of these days i really will talk to the people that aren't my girlfriend, but for right now- there's just too much to say!)"

"event","i read a shit-ton(yes,hyphenated), talked to my cousin, watched some punk-ass whodunit on Court T.V. or somethin', went to Joey's, played video games, laughed a LOT!!, came back to granny's, ate pizza with grandma,grandpa,Megan,Joey,and Shawn(the boyfriend of Megan with the plastic Wal-Mart BB gun i had a story about), left for Megan's house and talked my aunt and uncle into letting us cruise with Kylie(don't worry,i'm taken), left there, cruised with Kylie, hooked back up with Joey and Shawn, cruised, sang to Three Days' Grace and My Chemical Romance, almost beat Shawn within an inch of his life for badmouthing My Chemical Romance and saying ""Goddamnit"" in the same sentence, ate a Cookie Dough Blast from Sonic as recommended by you, came back home, puked, read, read, read, watched a movie i can't remember the title to on Cinemax(i love the movie), and thought about you three times between each of these. have you been busy? I'm gonna bum around tomorrow, then go ride four-wheelers with Megan and Kylie and somebody else.....can't think of anything else to say that i'm not too tired to make sound boring. I miss you like crazy- and you always manage to do something that makes me want you even more right before we know we won't be able to hang out for a bit...thanks.....love ya baby!-Brad"

"event","well, now i do...ok, so i'm in Arkansass (yes, on purpose to both- smartass) and now i'm bored. i don't sleep as most of you know, so all i can do is sit around and watch Skinemax and think about Lindsey. those don't go together, i swear it.....but i'm not thinking of anyone else though, so don't worry.  (i'm sure ""THE talk"" makes you much more convinced, right??? hope so....) no one but her understands that so don't even try.....i am happy that talk came though, i was beginning to get curious...a little...but on to udder tings, ho was (that totally says ""ho was""- I'M LEAVIN' IT!!!!!) babysitting?? hope the second day's smooth....sorry i didn't call again, ran outta time when i was on the road. but i'm talking now-kinda...i'm also sleepy now, i'll try to do that.      sorry this wasn't to the people that aren't Lindsey that read this, i'll write more tomorrow with funny stories. fuck you Sharon,Becky, and Brandon.  I'll also explain those later..."

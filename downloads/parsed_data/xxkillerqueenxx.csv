I was talking to my mom about the baby and stuff, I was like  when she gives birth to it. I'd love to stay but i have to go and watch daddy in france, she was like don't mention this but he said maybe he'd take us for a 2 weeks vacation in Greece to spend with our uncle who lives there, he moved to Greece cause he hated Saudi and stuff, I totally agree with him, maybe i'll end up doing the same thing. 
anyways... my latest obsession is to write stuff for him before going to bed :s like notes and things I might wanna say then when I wanna say em they just slip away from my mouth and I just sit there speechless so I thought maybe writing them down. uhh all that because I'm hanging on to that little string of hope.  it feels so serendipity, or something like it's meant to be or whateva, gawd IF I DIDNT HAVE THE URGE TO FUCK THINGS WOULD BE SO MUCH FUCKING EASIER FOR ME! hehe I'm so bad.
my best friend (she doesnt know me that well but she thinks shes my best friend so..) well she gave me this little note thing about religion and stuff..what do you think I'm not so smart?? I know what I'm doing, my brain is in my head I know what to fucking do...:P she told me she'd give me a tape about other stuff lets see what it's all about....I'm not gunna listen to it...oh well 
 oh yeah I watched that video i loved it, it made me think of him :'( 
god i'm so stupid i should have been more officiant. 
well that's a lesson to learn. 
I had a morning headache and didn't go to school...:D

"event","Hmmm... Today was kinda slow, my friend Maha passed out on me on our way out of the WC. I tried to pick her up but i couldn't. thank god the chicks saw us and called one of the teachers...lalala, So I talked to Mary today about fufu how were not talking and whatever happened with me and him. I was like maybe his dad found out :S she said yeah maybe but nothing is gunna happen to you...dunno he calls me from alotta cell phone #'s maybe his sisters or his moms...she popped and said yeah his sisters are bitches, like once mohssin (faisal's bro) called and then his sister called her cause she found mary's # on the cell. asking her who she is and all, mary said the the phone she has is her brothers and told mossin bout it later so mohssin asked one of his friends to call his sis and ask her why is she bugging his sis -mary-..... This is freaky...nothing is gunna happen to me though and that's good.

But I dunno... I could just let it go and I'm trying to forget it ever happened (the whole thing)... But something's holding me back.  

Oh yeah and mary is my schoolmate the one who introduced me to faisal who is her naighbor...god that is some kinda weird too, how we met. 

I just wanna know what's going on. 


I'm kinda sleepy but I cant nappy nap its too late and I have a private lesson. 

yay tomorrow is going to be a funny day. I hope

Lol why does everybody think I'm angel-like, so inoccent and sweet, heh well maybe it's my  sweet blushing face, or my inoccent eyes maybe?... or my shy smile?... gahhh I'm so baaaaad. 
So anyways I didn't do my math HW. she was like why didnt you?, Then I said: 'I was sick, really' she said she blieved me and then nothing happened but me blushing and her calling me sweetheart. 
next period she saw us laughing like crazy and other girls screaming so she asked us why and said I don't think sick girl laugh like that Yasmine! she was nosey enaugh to ask about what was going on, so I showed her my rubber frog and she freaked out and took it, told me to come back and take it when school finishes. I came back to her later on, and took my shit she gave me cookies cause I'm all healthy now and wuteva lalalalal... gee that was weird. 
I thought of fufu today too, He didn't reply my email. wonder what's going on ... dammit, I need a man 
I'm at home now, thinking about him and my cell, I wanna nappy nap but i can't, I feel like sleeping early tonight. 
Oh yeah and I chated with some arab dude who just wants to cyber sex me...I was all funky on him asking him whats the average penis size for teens or 17 years olds...Heh I wanna know fufu's penis size..shame on me
Oh well

I didn't  know I was addicted to him that much, Its's my first time getting with a guy from here, and it's so interesting...I love it cause it's a secret maybe, and secrets drive me wild...
I've always thought that love loses it's  shine & glitter when everybody knows about it, maybe that's what i mostly like about it.
So mmm, Abla Manal will put some ringing tones on my cell like Akhasmak ah and some other stuff...It's cool...yay 
I napped for too long today too, god i cant stop... nappy napping rocks. 
I spent all morning fixing my 007 light and cleaning my gun...
I worry about my weight I dont think im gaining any but i dunno my diet is fucked oh well... I have so much going on I'm glad i can let some of it out, I felt like something was missing when i couldnt. 

*sigh*,,, Is he ever going to call?!... I can't call him cause hes always changing his # and one of his bros or sisters might answer...I don't know, He always asks me why i dont call... and he wants me to call this time...we'll just see"

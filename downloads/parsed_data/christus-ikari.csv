So the three, my oldest sister, her fience and myself will sist down and discuss what needs to be done before I move out on the 30th of this month. I have been doing some thinking and I may even go back to school now that I am making more money now and also have a set schedule but im not to sure about that yet either I just know I need to do something with this life of mine or else I am going to go insane. And if I dont go to school I will go and look for another job so I can atleast live on my own which would be ok as well. I will put more thought into it later after I do this and get kinda situated back at my folks place."

"event","Today My baby rat Yang died while I was at work and so I will dedicate this post to her. I didnt have her for long but even though I was really getting attached to having her around to see when i came home from work and seeing here before I went to work. She was always full of energy and was always playing with Mei Ling my other female rat who was the reason I got another girl rat in the first place but anyways they hit it off from the start and they were always sleeping together. Figuring out what got her is something I dont want to do but I did it out of habbit and it hurts me even more if that is the case. I bought a diffrent kind of bedding for them cause it was a better buy then what I was normally getting them and thats how I have always shopped in the past. I just didnt think nothing of it and so I got it and changed their cages. Well I didnt notice anything real drastic til about mid last week when I notice she wasnt as acyive as she used to hoping that it was just me I let it go but I kept an eye on her. well today my room mate came in and noticed her and said that she might have the cold which was possible cause it just flew through my house and I was lucky not to get it but looks like Yang got it and well the rest is what it was. So I held Yang for a few minutes in my hand as I said a little prayer for her and then Mei Ling and I took her outside and barried her. Its funny how when my grandparents died I dont remember seading a tear but when a pet that I barely started to own dies I cry and it hurts inside so much but all I can do is just bottle it up inside and hope that the pain will subside. Well anyways this was todays post hopefully the next one will be of better news.

"event","I have decided that todays post should be in two parts the first one being what has gotten me a little down and this one about the one thing that keeps me going, my friends. I will go from friend to friend and write how they get me by in my eyes so if I leave something out or somebody it doesnt mean I dont notice its just these are what keeps me from being swallowed by the darkness of depression again.

Heather- My sister, her and I have gone through way to much in the past years (way to many to count) and she is by far the one reason I didnt leave when everything went south in my family. I cannot express in words how important my sister is to me and I am happy that she is always there if I need to talk to her.

Mike- My first best friend and someone I know I can trust with anything and everything. He and I went through hell as well and in my opinion him and heather were there when we went through those years he just didnt know my deamons as much as I didnt know his. Even though he lives in another city he and I get together via the internet and play Final Fantasy 11.

Jason- My newest best friend and my sisters fience, he is always a blast to hang out and I have fun every time the three of us hang out. He and I are alike in alot of ways but diffrent in alot as well cause of the way we were raised but with him being a gamer, movie goer and his wide arange of music we have something to always talk about. Also he is always willing to help me get through whatever comes up with my current problem and I am grateul for that.

Derek- A friend who became one of my best friends when we worked in the same department for the few months. He was there to talk to about my feelings and was just as confused as me with what she was doing. He is always willing to help me if I need to go somewhere on a certain day and now he and I along with Heather and Jason get together on set days and play some D&D or whatever depending on who runs the game."

Hey, I took the http://dragonhame.com online Inner Dragon quiz and found out I am a Rune Dragon on the inside. 

In the war between good and evil, Rune Dragons take the side of the noble and good....
When it comes to the powers of Chaos vs. those of Law and Order, your inner dragon tends to do things by the book. ...
As far as magical tendancies, a Rune Dragon's nature does not lend itself well to the ways of Magic....
During combat situations, whether by spells or by claw, your inner dragon will do whatever it takes to get the job done....
Rune Dragons are burdened with a specific task upon the world. They retain their original knowledge and experience, but something about their making compels them into undying loyalty.'
Although it does not cast spells itself, the Rune Dragon is Very magical in nature. In fact, it is a being made almost purely from the stuff of magic itself.'
The Rune Dragon appears dull grey in color, with each of it's scales containing a magical glyph of power. These glyphs contain the mighty spells involved in the dragons making. To undo these glyphs is to undo the dragon itself. It should also be noted that when the Rune Dragon has completed the task set for it, it's soul is freed from it's body.
'
This Dragons favorite elements are: Magic and Undying Loyalty

"event","First off I would like to say thank you to those who talked to me or responded about my past couple of post your words mean more to me then what I can say. Anyways on to my newest rant.

It has come to my attention that people should think twice before doing something stupid as to fucking their life in some way shape or form. I personaly know the pain of finding out that you are garbage and let me tell you it never heals. Seince we are on my wounds ill tell you what I mean, my father cheated on my mother when I was around the end of my freshman year in high school. Now with that I cant say for sure what went through his head at the time or even if he thought of any of us before he did it. Lets say he was doing it to get back at my mom for something it doesnt matter once he cheated on her I felt as if I was the one he was trying to forget and my world as I know it shifted to this dark and empty place I now call home. And to make matters worse my mom took him back showing me my mom wont even stand up for the family either so I was at a lost. Thankfully this tragidy did have some light in it and that was my baby sister for her and I realized that if we were going to survive we needed to sticki together(Heather you mean more to me then anything really and I prey for nothing but the best for you an jason). Now carring on, in my current household my older sister is doing the same thing to her family and now that I realize this I do not want anything to do with this household. I am even willing to move back into hell inself to escape this madness and prey that it gets better. What kills me the most are my 2 neices for the oldest is only in the 4th grade and I fear that if she finds out that it will just completly crush her and her being a scorpio like me I fear that she may do what I did and shut off the entire world or even worse for she doesnt have anyone to help her from falling like I did. I would even go as far as to say that they would be the reason why I would subject myself to this maddness even longer. We will see what happends and I am hoping that my neices have some gaurdian angels up there."

So from here on out I will recite the words in my subject to myself daily so I will not fall for someone who obviously doesnt care about me, and will lie to me about how they want someone closer to their age when you find out later that they were in love with someone who was younger then you? I HARTE BEING FUCKING LIED TO! If you dont like me just say that, dont tell me one thing and competly condradic it!!!!! Besides that I also hate people asking if I need something (heather I am not talking about you on this so dont worry). And just because I say no and walk away doesnt mean im mad at you so get over yourself and leave me be. Also I hate it when someone says 'oh thats sad' I dont get it Im not sadden by it so why is it sad? And above all I hate it when people try and tell me that Im a nice guy or that I am what women look for cause I think I will scream at the next person who tries and hands that crap off to me cause I know that statement is full of crap cause here I am alone and no matter how hard I try women seem to see me as only as a friend so that is why I will rip my heart out with my own hand before falling in love again."

So the only thing I can ask of you is to not write to make me feel better I would like you to write how it made you feel and respond back. Ten to one you will be more happy with what you write with your heart then rather with your mind.

I belive now that I am in what I will call the relm of beauty. Everyone around me is atractive and has no problem showing it off in the same sense I feel they even look down at me sometimes for I am just a visitor or outsider which ever you pick. Which is most likely why I cant find anyone cause everyone around me is too atractive that they dont even consider me anything more then a friend if that. Well that is what I think and in the end nothing can really change it cause it is truth and it is something I must learn to accept before desspair swallows me up again(which I have gotten close to being consumed already)."

It hit me the other day that each year I really hate valintines day. Rather its because I am alone or because I see so many happy people together which is new because I personally dont care about people in general. It seems that on valintines day I realize how alone I am and maybe thats what hits me the hardest, and then I hear things like 'you are a good person' or 'you just havent found the one yet' what people dont realize is that I will never tell someone how I truly feel because thats just who I am keep everything inside until it kills me and maybe it will one of these days. Well anyways besides that I also dont get this yesturday I was working and I just walked past Erin without saying hi and she automatically thought I was ignoring her? Now if she would like me to all she would have to do is just say so and I will walk away, erase everything I have to remind me of her but then maybe thats just me trying to take the pain away but anyways thats all I have to say and maybe tomorrow will be better......or at least I can hope"

Anyways I had a dream that I took Snake and Liquid (my two white rats) to a park for some reason on my bike. Now I only remember bits a pieces of my dream entirely but I remember seeing a huge rock that were home to these really big snakes (actual snakes) and way too big to be in a park. So I avoided the snakes and left the park. Now the next thing I know I have lost both Snake and Liquid and I dont know where they could have gone and the only thing that came to my mind were the two large snakes from the park and I just start to panic. Now this is where my dream got really weird cause I went all over the place looking for them and in the end all I remember is the great deal of grief and sadness. The only person I knew in my dream was my mom but she wasnt comforting me in the loss of my two rats, which is why I think heather and jason were not in my dream cause they would be there to help me find them (or at least thats what I think). Anyways when I woke up the first thing that came to mind was that it was only a dream and that Snake and Liquid were alright. Well thought I should share that and if you have any thoughts on the meaning by all means please share them."

"event","Its hard to describe how I feel right now. I want to be known but I also want to be alone? I think the old me is fighting with this 'new me' and my spirit in the meantime feels lost and confused. I am thinking of going away to someplace to start a new life but I am sure that no matter what I do these feelings will come back to me and I will once again feel lost. So i am guessing that I should just wait it out a little longer and see what happends. Till the meantime I am going to free style a poem for you guys:

Whould you be there in the end?
To remember all the good times
and the bad
would you cry for me?
and wounder why I ended my life so soon
Would you blame yourself
for not seeing this soonier
Well fear not
for i ended my life on my accord
and I am truly sorry for leaving you 
with these thoughts
And I wish I could tell you that we will meet again
but where I am going I wish for no one to trend
for the path I walk in the afterlife will be one saved only for
the forsaken"

"event","Ok now I am getting really pissed off her. My mom and my sister need to back the fuck off about the relationship between me and Erin. No heather I am not talking about you I am refering to Jenny and mom, they both think I am obsessed over Erin when all she is, is just a good friend. Now I wont lie to you who read this and I will be completly honest with you about how I wish there was something more but there isnt and I am slowly learning to deal with it. Anyways they think Im obsessed over her (and maybe I am) but if thats the case then they are the hipacrits for they tell me to go out and make some female friends and the instant I do they automatically think she is a girlfriend or something and I have had enough. If they cannot accept the fact that I have female friends then I will just not tell them anything anymore and this is the reason why I tend to keep my female friends so secretly from my family cause they all jump to conclusions about them. They belive Erin is just using me which I dont understand how for if you ever met her you would know she is not that kind of person, and 2 I dont have any money so its not like Im buying her stuff. So I have no idea what my family could be thinking if they are trying to save me from a heartache thats a little too late fro my heart was broken years ago and the pieces remain broken until someone comes to fix it......."

"event","Now I dont understand people and so I have decided to post this on my next journal. I dont understand why people will allow someone else to hurt them or at least I belive they are getting hurt but then I think I am over reacting cause if was really hurting them then why the fuck would they continue to allow it to happend? Now what I refering to is having sex and I want to know what the big fucking deal is? Is having sex with someone that important to where you rather cannot cope without talking about to someone or even bragging about it to others. I personally dont give a flying monkeys ass if you got laid the previous night and I really dont care if some guy is using you as a last resort for some ass cause in the end all this will do is piss me off. Maybe its because I have no experience with this issue that I dont understand so thats why I am asking thoughs who have and I dont care on who I am looking for some insight on why it is such a big fucking deal to get something from rather a complete stranger or a friend you refer to as a 'bed buddy'. I have come up with a senerio but if this is true then I would rather be alone and die that way, the therior is that the person loves the person using them so they dont care if they are a booty call or a bed buddy as long as they can be near that person for those few minutes is worth the endless pain afterwards? BULL SHIT! I will not except that such sacred things such as love or even making to be tainted by such stupidity and if it is true then all I have to say is that you are all fucked and over rathed and I think Im going to be sick and its all your fault. Granted I do know how blinding love is but like I said if anyone is willing able to destroy such a fragile thing and not worry then this world is truly fucked and whomever is watching all of this might as well set this bitch of a planet on fire."

"event","Its funny how this always happends, but I am once again struck down by my depression that no matter how hard I try it seems to never be enough for anyone. So what the hell do I do? I get another job and move out and not have to worry about anything again? Yeah like that would happend, I belive its in my nature now to be down cause I am use to just trying to help everyone out that I am now always feeling that I am spread out too thin. So what do I do I get a spot that would give me more money but that has only caused more problems and I just feel even worse because I have gotten nowhere. So now what can I do? What should I do? I want everything to be okay again but nothing will be okay again and no matter what I do I will never make everyone happy. Again I belive that its my nature to act this way no matter what everyone else thinks I will always be this way until my dying day, nice guy to the end and thats going to be the story of my life. Now I dont want you to worry but rather understand that I am not sad Im not happy im just me and if that makes you worry then I will put on my 'smile' cause I never wanted you to worry about me. Today at work a Co-worker came up to me and informed me that there is a promtion coming up for a GSTL which is a postion in Target that is the person who is in charged with watching the checklanes to make sure the customers are getting out fast enough and that you are getting the cashiers their breaks and lunches in time. That I would be able to deal with my problem would be the people who have to return something from the store and have to deal with them if they cough an attitude with me if I would be able to deal with it. So that is on my mind right now and I am thinking of atleast going for it so the store knows Im interested in moving up in the ladder. Anyways if I get this promotion I may start pushing my room mate to help me get my license so I can get a car and then from there get a one room apartment or a studio whichever will be good as long as it is close to work I dont care which one. Yet at the same time I am really afraid to live on my own but I need to or else I think I will do something even worse relying on others. I hung out with Erin on Monday and it was cool I just hate myself a little more everytime I do and I have no idea why. Maybe its because I still have emotions for her eventhough she does not feel the same for me. I guess Im just a damn fool for hoping that maybe one day she would feel the same way. Then I hung out with Heather, Jason, Heather's friend Kat and Kat's boyfriend Nick. Its was ok and the only reason I say it was ok is because I have never felt comfrotable in groups of people I dont know and so hanging out over there I kept mainly to myself and said little to nothing, its not like I dont like any of them I am just not a people person and I will never be a people person, thinking of that makes me laugh cause I work in retail and therefore I am always dealing with people so its ironic that I would be working in retail for 3 years now and I am still shy around people. As I look back on my friends I can give you the exact grade level where I ""shut down"" and went hiding in my ""box"". And that would be the seventh grade when I started to shut down cause that was around the time I was shown to trust no one but myself, and the only good friend I got out of middle school is my friend Mike who I am still friends with to this day. In High school I kept to myself hanging out only with MIke for the first 2 years of it. The other 2 years were spent in a group that i no where near fit in with and now that I think of it now I should never of hung out there but that is now in the past and I can only look back now. So here I am 4 years after I graduated and most of my friends have vanished in air but in a way I feel that this was all part of why I exsist in this world, and that 'purpose' is to help others but with this selflessness I should realize that I will never get what I want and so maybe that is the lesson I need to learn from my life........"

So I wounder if anyone has ever had these two conflicting thoughts in their mind at the same time, one is thinking that you are better off alone but you know what that leads to and you would rather not go that way again. So what do I do? Do I piss off those that I care so much for about to the point where they all abandon me or do I hope that there was more to my life then this constant disappointment. Also I have no real way to know how I would act if I ever did find someone for I have gotten so used to being let down that I may just lay on my back and enjoy the fact that I am comfortably numb......."

"event","Well here we go again, in two months another year of my life will have passed me by. Man I really do hate the coming holidays and even more my birthday. I think the reason why I despise my birthday and the holidays is for the one simple fact that I am alone and when I go to work while Im there, when I go home and when I hang out with friends or family I see them all so happy it makes me feel bad cause I am no were near that and every time I think I found someone they don't think I of me the same way. So maybe what I need to do is go find me another job so I can work in the mourning and at night and get me a place of my own so when I go home the only thing I will have to see will be my loliness and thats ok with me cause after awhile the pain will subside and I will be okay again or atleast for the moment until I go outside so maybe I should really get my writing career off the ground so I can stay home and not go anywhere. Sorry now I am just rambling on. Anyways the next thing is that Erin found out that I dislike these holidays and so she told me that she is going to get me to enjoy these holidays she even hinted that she was going to buy me something for my birthday which if she does I will be mad at first cause she should not have to go out of her way to try and make me happy. Also I have no idea on what I want this year cause I literally hate it when someone comes up to me that is my family and goes what do you want for your birthday when I wish they would just try to get to know me and buy me something they think I will like. Now Heather I don't want you to think I am aiming this at you for you did something I was not expecting and bought me the mp3 player. I wanted mom and dad to buy it cause I feel that we who have done nothing wrong to them in any way should get something nice from them. Anyways last year the two best gifts I recived was from heather, jason, jenny and kelly for the gifts they got me i know they put some thought in it and I am happy that they did. So anyways now I will need to see if I can find something to buy erin in case she remembers and gets me something even though I am hoping that she does not get me anything and hopefully I will just fly through these 2 months so I can forget these months for another year....."

"event","Okay now I have no fucking clue anymore, do onto others what you would have done to yourself? Well after tonight I find that saying to be a bunch of shit. Let me explain although this will be another long-winded entry, it started on saturday evening me and a co-worker found these notes stating these terrible things on cardboard and placed throughout my department. Now the name they chose was 'Chris' so we figured that it was aiming at our manager for she recently pissed off some people in the store. Yet tonight the 'notes' came back and the last one stated that Chris is a he and I realized that they were talking about me and so I was wounder all night what the hell did I do to get this person so mad to leave these notes out for me to find. And to make matters worse I think it is a co-worker who I thought we were alright friends but if it is him I have no idea what to do and even more so I feel as if I will slowly start to hate everyone at Target which if that happends I will just quit and go get another job but I have no idea where cause when I came home and was in my room I slipped again and started punching the back of my chair. Now I know that this will make most who read this start worring for me but I truly felt like I was alone and that there was no reason to see tomorrow. When I was younger and something like this happend the only reason why I continued on was cause I did not want to leave my sister alone and so I continued but now I know she will be protected so what do I have now? When I started crying I wanted to hold someone but there was no one and that just made me feel even worse. Yet here I am typing to you and I must say was that was because I just got done talking to my friend Derek and he helped me get back to my normal status. Thinking about it now this will be my last Christmas with this store for this is bull shit and I am going to go find another job and say good bye to that hell, yet i wounder if I will trust anyone ever again.....I guess only time will tell on that."

Nothing new to report except that we finally hired another body to the department that I work in and so I am no longer pulling 40 hours but I will be working more like 32-35 hours which is fine with me and plus it will allow me to hang out with my friends which I feel I have been ignoring lately and I am sorry for that. Also my anger slipped yet again on Saturday and I feel like I need to write about it, but the more I think about it I think I was being very childish and I should learn to let it just go. Well anyways here is what went down on saturday at four o'clock I went to go to lunch and a friend of mine clocked off from work so we were hanging out for awhile and when we went up to get some food we found out that Erin and her friend Amanda were also on lunch. Well me and my friend Derek were going to ignore both of them for the lunch but that fell through even though we were not even sitting at the same table nor anywhere close to each other. Then to top it off another co-worker by the name of Ansel came in for his lunch. Well when I finished my lunch I went to throw it away and thats when I heard it Ansel made a comment that everyone found out that I got embarrassed about one of Erin's tattoos and so when I heard everyone laugh I decided not to go back into that room and sat in the clerical part for about twenty minutes where I listened to my MP3 that my sister bought me and the song I was listening to was Duality by Slipknot. The scary part of that was that I found myself actually pushing my fingers into my eyes but anyways after I regrouped myself I went back into the room but as I entered I ended up kicking a table and then walked over and sat down and when they tried to talk to me I told them that I could not hear them for my music was too loud and I just pretty much sat there watching t.v. Derek got worried and pulled up a chair and sat next to me and wanted to know if I was ok, I told him that I was not ok but I did not quite tell him why but he caught on quickly to why I was upset. Then Erin came over and wanted to know if I was mad at her and the only answer I gave her was no and when she asked if I was lying I told her maybe. Fast forward to about six-thirty Erin came over to my department to talk to me about that and wanted to know if I was really mad at her. When she found out that it was Ansel that made me mad I already came to the conclusion that I was the one that acted like a child and that I needed to get over this shit and start acting my age. Well anyways I don't care if you respond or not cause I am starting to wounder why I type in something that no one really reads......Well until next time."

"event","Ok people here is the situation, for those who know me personally can guess what the question is. The thing is there is a girl I have developed feelings for but I don't know if it is what love is or just another stupid crush. You see to be perfectly honest with everyone I never had a lot of female friends and especially ones who know any of my true self (Heather You Don't count for you are my sister). So I think that whenever a women and I get to know each other I end up falling for them. On top of that I have no idea if she is just being a tease which the more I think about it is a possibility but I don't know. So my question to you guys is what do you think of it if you need more info respond with what you need answers to and Ill respond back with a 100% honesty, thanks."

"event","I don't know if anyone has ever hated them self as much as I hate myself right now. There are a few reasons to my hate for myself right now one being that if I am pushed too far I lose control of myself and what ever be the most powerful emotion at that moment I express it. Tonight was anger and the reason why I snapped was because while everyone else was waiting to get the call to leave me and another co-worker were trying to get rid of the carts in one of the departments and when I heard him over the walkie talking to our manager I just snapped. I threw the stuff in my hands into a cart walked away then walked back and kicked the cart. I say that I hate myself for this is because I try not to let things like this to get to me but since I was already in a bad mood for a reason I will discuss in a few minutes and that the customers today seemed to be assholes I was in a bad mood and so by then I was just waiting to snap and so I did. Now the other reason is something I have come to realize and somewhat come to terms with and that is that nice guys never get the girl and that women are hypocrites for they sit there and state that they wanted some sweet and nice when what they really want is someone to protect them. So with that said I know now that I will truly stand alone for now until I change or I find that one in a billion women who actually loves the nice guy........"

As I lie in bed
I slowly drift away
I begin to wounder why I
Should be alone?
Have I wronged somewhere?
......Someone?

As I lay in bed
I slowly drift away
I start thinking of hurting myself
To end this pain in my heart
Then I feel a preasence
lying next to me

As I lay in bed
I slowly drift away
A tear rolls down my cheek
I feel my heart fill with wounder
I see a reason to continue on
For one day I will finally meet...
...my angel
Who has saved me from the darkness."

"event","well I have been busy lately but seeing how I had some free time I figured I might as well write in it. I figured I can put on these two poems here to give you a hint on what had been on my mind and i will leave it at that.

How do I describe how I feel about you?
That when I hear your name my ears twitch
That when I see you my heart skips a beat
That when I see you smile my problems somehow wash away

I see the man that I know I can become when I am near you
When your away my heart won't let you escape my mind
Like a nameless song in my mind you are there
When you are sad, I to am sad
I wish that all your pain would wash away
So that maybe you would understand
How I feel about you

But you cannot know for my path seems to be etched in stone
For I waslk alone, and alone I shall be
So I will try to enjoy the what time we have and hope that,
One day you will find that person who will make you feel
that same way that I felt about you.

I will post my second poem on another post so thats not all."

I don't mind hanging out with my friends but I would rather be hanging in my room and I wounder why I have allowed myself to become so secluded. A friend of mine from work keeps telling me that she will help break me out of my shell. I smile and just shruge my shoulders and say whatever maybe this was my destiny. Also I have been thinking of not going to this get together on friday for I don't do well in groups never have and never will and if I go I feel as if I am killing everyones good time. I don't know maybe I am just making an excuse not to go. I will type in this again to let you know what I have decided on what action to take. 

Now I have a question for those who may have an answer for me for I am at a lost and I am actually starting to lose sleep over this (which is sad). Ok there is this girl that I work with and despite my best attempts I have ended up crushing on her. We hung out together at her place (nothing happend) and watch Hidalgo then she gave me a ride home. Seince then she has called me at least twice a day stating that she just wanted to bug me and we talk online while she is at work in the mourning and when we both work at night she calls me a couple of times to talk to me. But the thing that bothers me is that she claims that she has a thing for a guy in uniform. So thats that I would like anyone to answer this post honestly what they think this could mean.

My final post of the night is this besides what I have posted I have also been thinking about this so called 'free will' thing and I was thinking what if no one had true free will and that no matter what we do it is fate that decides where you go in life. Maybe that is just a way to give up on life without comiting suicide. I don't know I am just posting what gose through my mind most of the time and is also probrably why I don't sleep well if anyone has any guess on that as well please reply to the post if not I am sorry you had to read all this."

"event","Well I found out that I will be able to hold off on one payment and be able to make one that is more important to me. and hopefully I won't be shooting myself in the foot for later. well anyways I guess I should let you all know that I have realized that I have slipped into a depression and I didn't even realize it until about a week ago when a friend from work asked me if my family had a history of derpression and I would like to know the answer to that but to find out would only make all those I hold dear worry even more for me. Who knows maybe its just me and if thats the case then its a real good reason why I should stay this way so I don't end up passing it down (but thats a whole nother problem on its own). Well anyways I have posted my poems and told you how I felt so you would not think that I did not trust you for it never was about trust but more of not wanting you all to worry for me. Now I know that I posted saying that I despise post that said that they were sorry to hear that or what not but I would like to know if there is anyway to overcome this and if there is (without taking perscription drugs) reply back with your thoughts if not thats ok I will find a way to beat this."

"event","Darkness

I started this journy with the tourch burning brite,
but the darkness surrounds me.
I try to find my path,
yet the darkness is too think to see the road.
I look around me but all I see is darkness,
outside of my light.

I am still here walking through the darkness,
in search for another source of light,
but all i see is nothing.
I see that my once proud light 
is fading to nothing brighter then a night night.
So now I look for something to replinsh my light source
before the darkness consumes me.

I am still searching 
but now it seems more desperate.
and I feel as if I have lost my way.
Inside this darkness that is inching closer to me.
My light is now a dim glow
as I fall to my knees I cry out into the darkness.
Hoping that someone heard my cry 
and come save me from this darkness."

"event","I swore that I would keep my feelings at work professional but I just can't seem to put this heart of mine on stand by while I am there so I end up falling for another. Heh, maybe she won't run away if I ever get the courage to say anything. My friends say I should go for it but its hard for a person like me to say how they feel for I am afraid of what the out come may be. Well I will most likely let you know if I ever get the nerve to say anything, but I may not and if that is the case then I will one day get over her and move on. Well anyways I was on the internet last night and I found out that my zodiac must of been some kind of joke for those watching in heaven for my ruling planets are mars and pluto and according to this site mars helps me while pluto sets me up to fall from it and so I just think that it would be impossible for me to like anyone enough to say anything to them. Or at least right now that is for the site mentioned that my tarot card is the death card but that is only as a symbol, for the death card just means the end of something and the begining of something new but that would all depend on where the card landed and the way it lands. So I don't know maybe one day I will find out what the cards have in store for me but then again I guess relying on a deck of cards to tell you future is a little weak but I would be more interested in finding out how acurate it can be on my life. For that is the only reason why I have trusted my zodiac sign so far for wherever I go to do research on it or what not I get the same in depth look on my life. Well anyways I am off to figure out what I am going to do with this thing called life, here is to hoping that tomorrow is a good day."

I do not know whats wrong with me but I think it is a form of depression. For the past three weeks now I have felt as if nothing I do is right and that it mounts to nothing in the end and it has finally got to me so bad that I can no longer hide it from anybody and for not telling those about this earlier I am sorry but I did not want you to worry about me and I hope you still won't for even though I feel this way I still have hope. Hope that tomorrow will be better and that I may one day end this pain inside me. Also I have come to the conclusion that a person like me is best suited alone, or atleast thats what I am telling myself. For even though I may think I know myself I will never completly know myself and therefore I will never know what I want out of life and will most likely live my life that way...who knows heres to hopeing."

"event","Well yesturday my sister gave me one of her rats, which was okay. In fact with the limited amount of money that I had at the time it was good that she gave me her rat (which I knew how hard to part). I am going to keep his name the same but as a nickname I may have it as Big Boss. The reason why is because before she gave me Ben they had a female rat named Sarah that got knocked up by Ben and they said that I can have one of the children. Now if I get two males I can name one Solid and the other Liquid or just get one male and name him Liquid for he was the one that Father chose. Although I hope Ben and his son or sons would get along a lot better then the characters did. Well talk to you later I have to go to work now and before I go I am going to say good bye to Ben but I may just let him sleep and I'll see him when I get home."

I feel as if I am surrounded in darkness. What makes me realize this is when I step outside my room and I see all these couples walking around, happy to be with eah other. Even though my friends and family give me the strength to survive in this darkness I feel as if it won't be long before the darkness consumes me and after that I have no idea how I am going to act or feel adter that so I hope this light inside me never fades and I hope I don't hurt those that I hold dear to me.

"event","Its been a couple of days seince I wrote in this and its mostly because I had no idea to write about. I hope everyone had a pleasent easter. My was good, I got to go see my Grandma who I have not seen in a very long time and when I heard that she had cancer that they cannot take out my first thought was to go see her. Now I would be lying if I said that she looks good but all I wanted to do was see her again before the end and all I can really do is hope that she goes peacefully. Now I don't want my sister to get the wrong idea, she did not look like she was going to die on the spot she just does not look well at all and I refuse to sugar coat it as some people would. Now moving slightly away from the subject of my grandma (mostly cause I don't want to talk about it anymore) my belife is once again on a shaky foundation. Now I know some of you would say that I am not a religious person but I must say now that I am a degree of the religion that is know as mormon. For if you look at the way I have lived my life you would see that two things happend: I was raised properly(Thanks to my older sisters) and that my best friends came from outside the church for it was their point of views that helped me get a look into their own lives. Also I guess for the fact that I was never a pushy person I was a never a big fan of going up to people and telling them that they were sinners if they did not go to church every sunday and to do nothing but read the bible and fallow the footsteps of 'God' whom we have no idea how to do that except that he wants us to live a life of choice. Well if that was the case then I belive that we are all okay for we make choices day in and day out. What I belive is wrong is the pressing against someone to belive in your belifes. Seeing that I just repeated the same thing twice I will move on to the next thing that botherd me about my 'church'. Acording to mormons there is no hell, it is just a figment of our imagination and that there are three levels of heaven and the only way to not go into one of these three levels is to be a murder, rapest or child moleste(which you are just cast to the stars). Now what I was told that your 'hell' is being put on one of the lower levels of heaven and surposively your consence gets to you talling you that you could have done better but you didn't and now you are here. My thought is that I will live my life the way I wanted and if 'God' does not like it then I would tell 'God' that they should not be so double-standards. Finally the last thing that really got to me was the people there. The adults were okay and so were the children it was the kids my age that pissed me off for they two-faced everything and for that I was done with going to church for anything less then two things: The peace I felt in side that room was like none I have every fealt and for a women that I fell in love with. Yet as time marched on we went our seperate ways and I talk to her mom whenever we run into each other mostly when I am at work. Well if you are still reading this I am appologizing for this long winded post and that every time I think of the after life I really get down so I will talk to you later....have a good night and take care of yourself and each other."

"event","This post is going to be my reasons why I like the singer/songwritter Phil Collins. For starters he writes his own material which if you listen you can tell that he seem to pour his soul into each of his songs. Secondly I can't think of anyone as talented as he is in the music business(thats still alive). Growing up in the eighties the radio channels I listend to were the mix 96, y92 and the eagle 96.9 (These are the radio station in my area so they may be diffrent in yours) and I loved going to bed (and still do) listening to my radio which plays 'soft rock' as it is called now. My first song I heard from him is one of two (I can't really pin-point the exact one :( ) In the air tonight or Everyday. Both songs are my absolute favorites I just don't know which one I heard or liked first. Most likely it can be in the air tonight for that was his first hit off his first solo album Face Value. Well anyways I got his newest album Testify awhile ago and I must say that it is his best one yet. My other reason for liking him is for whatever my mood may be I could listen to any of his songs. Its funny because I once bought a Eric Clapton cd to try and get something a little more diffrent then Collins and listening to the cd I was looking at who wrote some of the tracks and sure enough there he was Phil Collins helped him write one and performed with him on another. Well anyways and then one of my favorite Disney (and there are not alot of them) was Tarzan and he along with Mark Mancina (Composer for Tarzan and Brother Bear) The music to that movie always got to me(you can go ahead and call me a pussy). Well the reason why Im ranting is because I watched the movie Brother Bear today while I gave blood and even though Phil Collins was not as dominant as he was with Tarzan I still want to go get the cd and also buy the movie for I let the Tarzan movie slip pass me I don't want to miss out on this movie. Well anyways what are your thoughts on all this babble, go ahead say whats on your mind for I would really like to know what you think when you read my posts (if you even read them). Well talk to you later."

"event","Okay today was a busy day. I got a call at ten o'clock, it was work wanting me to come in early because almost everyone called in sick or were showing up late for they forgot to set their clocks ahead an hour. Then while at work I was pratically running all over the store trying to get the calls to help the people who shop at the store. Well by the end of my shift I was more then happy to clock off and go home. Well other then my long day at work I decided to post my next poem. Fair warning though it is not a happy one and that it only reflects of how I felt at the time so without further delay here is my poem:

Failure
Failure is something new to me
I failed in being a friend
I failed to be a faithful boyfriend
I failed at being a brother
I failed at school

And I failed at what I wish I did not
I failed at being a son
So in all my failures I feel I do nothing right anymore,
For I don't even get his attention for any moment
For if I could feel that my father really loves me again 
I could free myself from my depression

""But I know I may end up failing too. But I know you were just like me with someone dissapointed in you."""

"event","Reading an entry from my best friend made me once again realize a little more of me, I have already answerd his post this is just my after thoughts on it. I have come to realize that through out my life I have spent it helping those in need. No I am not saying I am a super hero who goes around helping everyone. I helped those close to me and I realized the reason why is to help them through those curves that life sometimes throws us. I am a really big fan of sci-fi or fantasy novels but there is a book that I really liked that is outside those two genres and the title of the book is Catcher in the rye for that is how I see myself. The problem though now is that I am starting to think that I helped those people just so I didn't have to face my own problems that here in my room makes me think of all those worries, but before I go to sleep I usually have a plan on how to get myself through but therer are still no long-term plans yet."

"event","Well yesturday was a wild day and all I have to say is that by the end everything worked out. I won't go into the details about why. Anyways I finally beat MGS2 on hard and it was insane. The boss fights were incredible and I can't remember the last time I played a game thinking that I was not going to survive or that I had to start over again and again. Well I think I have figured out on my fanfic to MGS. I think I will place it after sons of Liberty but I will not have Liquid being Ocelot's right arm. My character will be a soilder that is sent to help Snake and Otacon to try and find Olga's child. Well that is just a start I may change it tomorrow. Well Thats all for now so I will see you tomorrow."

"event","I finally got past this one part in MGS2 (Metal Gear Solid 2)! I found all those stupid control panals and now I am moving on in that game so I can get all the dog tags and so I can walk around saying ""HA! I got your tags!"" in snakes voice. I mean my sister is the only person who knows how frustrating that part was for me. Now it gets more interesting, for I have to fight the boss's now and they are getting to be a real pain. In the fight against the harrier I actually had to rely on Snake dropping down some rations for me so I could heal myself. And now I am fighting Vamp who is even worse! I mean imagine all the things that could go wrong in a boss fight and that was happending to me. Hopefully getting some sleep will help beating him tomorrow if not I could always bust out my walkthrough guide and see what they said but I will make that a last resort. Also I have gotten the urge to write a metal gear fan fic my bigest concern is where to place it. My sister would most likely would like to be in it and maybe her boyfriend and my newest best friend Jason might want to be in it. I'll think of my character's bio and when its done I will post it and ask you guys for your insight and again I want you to be brutally honest. Also I spent the last few days over at my Mom's keeping my sister and Jason company, and when it got done to me leaving they did not want me to go, now its not like I hate them or anything I just fealt like I needed some time to myself and I hope they understand that. Also I have a message that I would like to give heather and Jason which goes like this: Thanks for including me in your guys plans for the future but I must decline and say that my future is mine and I would like to make my own path. I hope they get what I am trying to say and if not I am sure they will call me and ask for the meaning. Well anyways I am getting tired and this journal entry is getting pretty long so I will say that I will cut it off there and say good night."

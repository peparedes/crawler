I remembered that once upon a time an angsty young lady used to post angsty things about her love life on this thing, and then I thought maybe I would show the world that the angsty young girl has grown up.  A little bit.  Maybe when it's not bedtime (work early tomorrow) I will actually post some updates.  In the meantime, it's good to see you, LJ.  Hope to see you soon.  And you too, faithful readers, if there are any of you left."

"event","I'm thinking about doing some sewing tutorials to put on youtube.  I've been doing a lot of sewing lately and I've taught myself a couple of stitches that are really nice for decorative purposes.  Also, I think sewing is a skill that comes in handy quite a bit.  What I'm wondering is whether people will be interested in watching them.  I know there are already quite a few videos like it on there so my target audience would be people I know - but are there enough who would like to get into sewing a little more?  Who knows.  Perhaps I'll just do it and see what happens.  Right now I'm working on a Free Hugs shirt - pictures will be up on deviantART when it's finished."

1)Rich, I miss you so much.  It's been a few years since we were together but for some reason it hurts that you're in a new relationship.  I'm happy for you - don't get me wrong, but I miss you.  She'd better understand how lucky she is to have you.

2)Did I ever mention that my parents are officially divorced?  As of June.  And I am fine with it.  Wonderful actually.  My relationship with both my parents has never been better, and both are now completely sober.  Rather than send me condolences, send me congratulations that life is good.

-Quote from the archives of this journal XD

I've been reading through old journal entries for amusement.  I have learned two things:
1) I really need to stop the whining.  Wait - I already knew that.
2) I have become less eloquent with time.

I'd really like to get in touch with people I haven't talked to in awhile.  Cera, Jen, you are two of the people on that list.

I really have amazing friends.  I see it more with each entry I reread.  I miss them tons.  Sarah, this one's mainly aimed at you.

It is 3:30am.  Funny how that part of me hasn't changed.

Good night moon."

"event","So it's been a long time since I've posted but I'm bored, putting off going to bed, and I've played way too much Mahjong Dimensions on GSN's website.  This is what my life has become.  A lot of wasted time, wasted days, boredom, loneliness.hu  One day my brother and his friends were sitting here talking and they were discussing karma.  All of them believe in it in some variation, and I sat there and wondered if karma does exist, shouldn't I be winning the lottery or something?  Then again, I have a family that loves me and that in itself should be enough.  Very often it is.  But seriously.  I want a family more than anything else in life, and yet this PCOS that I have could mean that I'm infertile.  If I am then I have no real purpose in life.  I have this stupid anxiety disorder.  I can't completely complain about it though -  it has taught me the value of not stressing over little things.  I can't save money, I hate my job, and living at home makes me feel like I'm still 12.  I don't have any idea what I want to do with my life, and it's frustrating.  Most of my friends seem to have forgotten about me, and I know it's partly my fault that I never talk to them either, but it would be nice to not feel forgotten.  I regret a lot of the things that happened in high school.  I regret a lot of things I did in college.  I wish I could get over petty things that don't really matter.  My mom often tells me I need to find a full time job.  My brother works like 6 days a week.  I don't know how.  I dread going to work.  I feel useless because I don't work more, but I'd feel worse if I worked more at this job I have now.  I want to move out, but my checking account never has more than $300 in it.  I pay bills and then waste the rest on stupid little things.  Then I look back and wonder why I did that.  I'm tired, I'm hungry, and I'm already bored with this post.  I need to eat less and exercise more.  I want to know if people think I'm ugly and if that's why nobody ever seems to be interested in me.  I know it can't just be my weight because people much fatter than I am have husbands.  Attractive ones too.  I know personality is important too, but people seem to like me okay so what is it?  I'm honestly just curious.  I mean it hurts too but at this point I'm just wondering.  This weekend was beautiful.  Tomorrow is supposed to be almost 80.  I have to work.  Seems like that always happens.  I know I probably sound high, but I'm not.  Never done that crap.  Never been drunk either, and I'm okay with that.  You won't see me with a cigarette in my mouth either.  Ironically I love life way too much to risk lung cancer and COPD.  Teens really need to stop with this sexting crap.  Seems like this upcoming generation is doomed by stupid people.  I really hope not.  Well it's probably bedtime.  When I get to this rambling point it's a good idea to sleep.  I miss having a boyfriend.  Just some passing thoughts from a wonderful artist (Owl City, Vanilla Twilight):

The silence isn't so bad till I look at my hands and feel sad, because the spaces between my fingers are right where yours fit perfectly...Drenched in vanilla twilight I'll sit on the front porch all night, waist-deep in thoughts because when I think of you, I don't feel so alone...As many times as I blink I'll think of you tonight.

Time to find a quick snack before I hit the hay."

"event","I've been off of LJ for awhile and suddenly had the desire to post.  I wish I knew where to start.  There's so much to talk about and yet I never feel like writing it all down, especially when I'm reading a good book.  I'm currently reading Dan Brown's <u>Angels and Demons</u>.  Excellent book.  Full of puzzles and action and romance and danger, etc.  Very worth reading.  Assuming the end doesn't suck, I will be reading <u>The Da Vinci Code</u> next.

So let's begin with the biggest, most strangling topic.  The rest of my life.  I've graduated and here I am living at home still making barely more than minimum wage.  It's not that living at home is that terrible - I have friends here, I do enjoy living here for the most part, but it's so BORING so much of the time.  Each time I visit the good old alma mater I feel a pang of sadness that I'm not still there.  I miss my school friends and I miss the city.  (Pardon my paranoia - I don't like to name places for the world to see and I don't like making posts private)  But this isn't even the biggest issue.  The biggest issue is figuring out what I actually want to do.  The more I think about it, the more ideas my mind comes up with.  Since graduation I've had so many ideas about possible career paths, and all of them require more school.  I still love my Spanish and want to use it, but I want to do something more.  That being said, I have known my whole life that I don't want to teach.  It's not my ""calling"".  The irony is that all the topics which have recently popped into my head as possible paths have very few options besides teaching.  For example, reading this current book and falling asleep to ""National Treasure"" every night have given me an interest in history (very strange since it was my least favorite subject in high school).  I've also been reading a lot of classic literature lately and immensely enjoy it.  Lastly, I've had the desire to write novels for a long time now, but I worry I don't have the talent to make a living off it.  The biggest obstacle of course is going back to school, something which not only fills me with despair but also costs money - something I'm seriously lacking.  The way I see it right now I have time to think and work it out, but this turmoil is frustrating.  I want to move forward.  I want to feel like an adult with my own life and own career.  At the moment I still feel like a child.

Next, on a lighter note, I've been pondering friendships this evening.  It's funny how our core friends change so much over time.  Even since just a year ago the people close to me have shifted immensely.  It's something that's not stoppable and it's not necessarily a bad thing, but I'm finding that I miss some of the friendships that have faded over time.  I would love to get to know Audrey again and see how her life has changed in the past 4 years.  I wish I still had the closeness I had with Rich.  I miss arguing with Ethan.  I wish I could see Torie's strength now that she has been on her own for 4 years.  Her inner strength always filled me with wonder and I wish I could take a page from her book.  I regret all the negative things that happened in high school and I wish I had been as enlightened then as I am now.  Anyway, I love the friends I have now, and as much as I miss some of my more distant friends, I'm glad that to have the ones I have now.  Each person brings their own unique personality and presence and I'm blessed to have gotten to know so many amazing people.  I look forward to making more friends in the future.

Thirdly I could rant about my current worries about my family, but they haven't really changed.  The only beacon of light that has broken through is my mom's story - after getting so drunk she blacked out and drove home, luckily without incident, she has sworn off alcohol.  She hasn't drank since August 1st, and as upset as I am about the story of the blackout, I'm proud of her for finding strength.  My brother seems to be on a possible road to recovery - I just hope my dad will find strength from the rest of us.  In my case, I haven't really drank for a while now.  I just don't see the appeal.  I don't like the taste and I don't like throwing up enough to get drunk.  So good for me.  People may find my preferences strange, but I am proud of myself and frankly I like my liver too much to care what other people think.  Anyway it's more fun to be the only sober person at drunken parties.  Messing with the minds of drunk/stoned people is too fun.

I'm sure there's more I could rant about.  If you're reading this I applaud you for getting this far.  Clearly you care about me and I'm glad to be friends with you.  I hope everything is going well with all of you - I miss you all terribly and I hope we'll meet again soon.

Good night."

It's nice to feel like I have a best friend again.  It's nice to have people to hang out with at all.  All in all things are good.

"event","I hate this day.  El Dia del Diablo (Day of the Devil), as I like to call it.  Or Singles Awareness Day.  Or just That Day.  Ick.  I'm getting ready to put some clothes on and go outside to build a fort.  Whether or not I will actually throw snowballs is up in the air, but I do want to build a fort because the snow is perfect.  Also, my prescription finally came so I'm back on my meds again.  Woot.  I'm still in a pretty sucky mood though.  Let me tell you though, accomplishing something does a world of good.  Last night I did all the dishes in the kitchen and it felt good to be doing something useful.  It boosted my extremely bad mood a little bit.  Anyway, I'm skipping all my classes today for various reasons so I'm around.  You should come help me build a fort, unless you're in a relationship, in which case I'm probably not in the mood to see you.

Happy Singles Awareness Day.

May hang out with <lj user=dragonclaws> watching chick flicks and booing at the sappy parts + throwing things at the screen.  If I wasn't worried about getting frostbite/attacked/arrested I might go outside and throw things at oogley-googley couples.  I know I sound bitter.  I am.  And I'm also still getting over that breakdown and am now beginning to feel angry at the world.  Probably one of the stages of grief.  So bear with me.  Have a lovely night all.

"event","So guys, I need some advice.  The more responses I get the better.  Here's the situation:

I like this boy named Will, which most of you probably already know.  He lives in the house with me (along with about 28 other people, for those of you who don't know), so I see him pretty regularly.  Every Monday he and Sarah and I go rock climbing together.  I'm not best friends with him or anything, but I would consider him a friend and I enjoy the rock climbing routine and all.  I don't really want to jeopardize the friendship but I also just want to tell him how I feel because I hate this not knowing how he feels.  I suspect he just thinks of me as a friend, but I'm biased because of the number of rejections I've been through (a LOT).  I don't know what to do...help!!!  Here's a poll so you can let me know what you think I should do.

Had to get another PPD, they gave me the Tdap shot (tetanus/diphtheria/pertussis), and they had to draw blood to make sure my Hep B is up to date and something to do with chicken pox.  The Tdap makes your arm really sore and sure enough, it hurts to raise it and stuff.  Hope it doesn't affect contra tomorrow.  Went to a party at Shir's which was okay but I didn't really talk to many people and the drinking was bugging me a bit.  After that I called my mom, got into a huge fight with her which made me feel horribly guilty, then played cards with peeps and won a bunch of times.  So here is my list of injuries/pain for the week:
-Cool bruise on my hand from broomball Sunday
-Cut finger from climbing Monday
-Sore shoulder/muscles from climbing Monday
-Random painful ankle on Tuesday
-Pain in arm from three needles today
-Sore arm because of shot today

Stayed up WAY too late last night, woke up at 7:41am to my alarm (I do this every year; I was born at 7:41am and so I always set my alarm for then and wake up and do a little happy dance then go back to sleep) and slept in until my mom woke me up to take a phone call around 12:30.  It was Rich!!!  It absolutely made my day to hear his voice.  *sigh*  I then got up and took a shower and got dressed and my mom and I went out to lunch (Chinese buffet...mmm) and went shopping all day.  I got the new Lifehouse CD and an iTunes card and so when I got home I imported the CD to iTunes and got a couple new songs.  Which reminds me that I need to charge my iPod.  Lounged around for a couple hours and now I'm in bed.  Bobby's being a bit of a douche but oh well.  He's in bed now.  I should be asleep; I almost fell asleep before but then Brownie barked and woke me from my semi-conscious state and I decided to go online for a bit.  So here I am.  And now I'm leaving.  Good night all!

"event","Aaahhh I can finally settle back into my more relaxed way of life that doesn't involve getting up at 7:30am or changing diapers every 15 minutes!  On a more annoying note, this connection is even shoddier than usual and I keep keeping disconnected every 5 minutes or so.  I bought myself a pint of Ben & Jerry's to celebrate/reward myself.  Woot.  I can't even begin to tell you how exhausted I am.  I can't even look at the stair because my legs are so sore from running up and down them so much.  I woke up this morning because apparently Owen got up before me this morning and helped himself to breakfast - a donut and a bologna sandwich.  Sheesh.  I got bonked on the nose by Owen while on the trampoline today and I got a bloody nose, and now if I move my nose back and forth it hurts.  Not too bad - it's not broken or anything, but it's sore.  Ah well.  Occupational hazard.  

In other news, Bobby graduates Saturday!  I'm excited because we're having a party and it will be lots of fun, the next day I get my new phone, and we'll be leaving for our vacation soon after that.  Boy it's going to be an exhausting weekend (but not as exhausting as this past one!).  I'm planning on bringing my computer with me on vacation so hopefully I'll be online quite a bit and will be able to stay in touch.  Otherwise perhaps I'll send letters/postcards.  Send me your addresses!  I have the list from last year, but if you've moved I need updates (this means you, Ethan).  I can't guarantee I'll be able to send things to everyone, but I'll try!  Anyway, I'll have my cell phone (most likely a new one with the same number!) so I'll actually be able to call/text people too.  I will keep in touch no matter what it takes.

On another completely different note, I have a wishlist of songs that I want and unfortunately  my iTunes card ran out and I can't buy more until I get a new one.  If anyone has either of these songs, will you send them to me?
""Last Dollar (Fly Away)"" by Tim McGraw
""Hey There Delilah"" by Plain White T's

My connection is wicked sketchy so I suppose I will wrap this up here.  I don't know if I'll be on AIM tonight - it's too frustrating to figure out what I've missed.  Good night all.

I would love to be able to watch an episode of Fresh Prince ;)  I would also like to be able to eat a sandwich without hearing ""Bite?""  Actually no I think that it's adorable and I don't mind sharing with Brodie.  Babysitting is good for me because it reminds me why I could not possibly handle having my own kids yet.  They're good kiddos but boy am I exhausted.  I'm so ready to have some free time again.  Today was immensely better than yesterday.  My mom, the boys, and I went shopping then we went ""out"" to eat at McDonald's.  On the way home Owen said something that I wish I could've caught on tape - it had my mom in tears she was laughing so hard:

During a discussion about marriage:
Owen: Sometimes women marry women.
Me: And sometimes men marry men.
Mom: Someday you'll get married and have kids Owen.
Owen: No I'll <i>never</i> get married.
Mom and I: Why?
Owen: Because there aren't any women left.
Me: Because they're marrying each other?
Owen: Yeah.

Kids really do say the darnedest (sp?) things sometimes.  The boys will be going home tomorrow or the next day - not sure which yet.  In other news, tonight was Bobby's last night working at the restaurant so he brought home french fries, onion rings, and mozzarella sticks.  Sooo bad but oh soooo good.  Anyway, I should go check on Brodie and I should also probably go to bed.  7:30 is going to be bright and early...ick.  Good night all."

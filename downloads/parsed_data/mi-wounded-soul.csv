"event","he passed away today about 640 am.

i was at his house when it happened but weird thing was about 5 minutes before my mom called me to let me know i got on the freeway here and about 6 beautiful white birds were on the freeway flying next to me and i knew it had happened.&nbsp; i called mom and she confirmed it :(

im&nbsp; glad that he is in&nbsp; no more pain but today i lost my best friend, my partner, my uncle and my brother all at once.

im relieved and heart broken.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

i was able to be there for my mom and grandparents for a while this morning at least and some more tomorrow.

thank you all for your thoughts and prayers."

"event","this will probably be my last update.&nbsp; 
 
 he found out today that there is more cancer in his esaphogus.&nbsp; there is nothing left for him to do.&nbsp; too weak for chemo /radiation and too weak for another surgery of that magnitude.
 
 he cried with me alone in the room and i was told that was the first time he has shown that emotion among anyone else.&nbsp; my uncle, the closest thing to my brother, is going to pass away from this.
 
 no time frame was given, just basically as long as his body can hold out.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 
 today i have felt worse and cried more than i have ever done in one day and its not over yet.&nbsp; 
 
 thank you all for your thoughts, you guys are my second family thank you.

he was able to do the full surgery and is in lots of pain they told me =\&nbsp; but the doctor has a lot of good things to say, ie went smoothly, they were able to take out the parts they wanted to and replace what was needed to be replaced.

he is having some trouble with some kind of breathing exercise they have him on and is just in a lot of pain from the whole thing =\

"event","Well

my uncle is in Los Angeles and is preparing to have his surgery.&nbsp; its so scary, his life is literally in this doctors hands.&nbsp; they chose him because for this type of surgery, removing the stomach and replacing with other organs, he is number one in the country.

since he stopped&nbsp;doing chemo and was doing radiation only he has greatly improved though, eating much more, if you remember&nbsp;the cancer was in his throat and he wasnt able to eat anything.&nbsp; but he is more talkative on the fone and able to move around the house a lot more.&nbsp; the&nbsp; doctor&nbsp;told him this is a life changing surgery and that afterwards&nbsp;he would never eat the same.&nbsp; smaller amounts and more often and some foods is a no no for a long time.

im terified to be honest.&nbsp;&nbsp;

i am just praying that everything goes smoothly the surgery is monday, last about 8 hours to get it all done at the 4 hour mark they stop and make sure his blood&nbsp;vessels are still pumping strong enough and able to continue for the next half.&nbsp; if not he will have to wait about a month for them to reheal and&nbsp;go back for the 2nd part.&nbsp; we are all hoping that wont happen.&nbsp;&nbsp;he will have to stay in cali until end of february most likely to be close to that doctor and make sure everything is going ok internaly and wiht his&nbsp;digestion and everything.&nbsp; he will be in the hospital&nbsp;itself for&nbsp;a period of 7 to 14 days after surgery.&nbsp;&nbsp;

he told me that will be the hardest part im hoping he&nbsp;so drugged up that&nbsp;the time goes quickly.

we went to his house this last tuesday for a bit and got to sit and watch tv with him he joked a bit like he always does but when he talked about it ...&nbsp;i just told him to stay strong not to worry about anything else then yourself and healing.&nbsp;&nbsp;

it all goes down monday.&nbsp; i wish i could be there&nbsp;but i cant be.&nbsp; he said he knows and that i shouldnt worry because&nbsp;he will be out of it anyways and stuff but you know, its having people around you that care when you need it.

ill update again when i found something out.

"event","<b>I Am A:</b> Lawful Good Human Paladin/Cleric (2nd/2nd Level)
<br><br><u>Ability Scores:</u><br>
<b>Strength-</b>13<br>
<b>Dexterity-</b>14<br>
<b>Constitution-</b>14<br>
<b>Intelligence-</b>14<br>
<b>Wisdom-</b>14<br>
<b>Charisma-</b>18
<br><br><u>Alignment:</u><br><b>Lawful Good</b> A lawful good character acts as a good person is expected or required to act. He combines a commitment to oppose evil with the discipline to fight relentlessly. He tells the truth, keeps his word, helps those in need, and speaks out against injustice. A lawful good character hates to see the guilty go unpunished. Lawful good is the best alignment you can be because it combines honor and compassion. However, lawful good can be a dangerous alignment because it restricts freedom and criminalizes self-interest.<br>
<br><u>Race:</u><br><b>Humans</b> are the most adaptable of the common races. Short generations and a penchant for migration and conquest have made them physically diverse as well. Humans are often unorthodox in their dress, sporting unusual hairstyles, fanciful clothes, tattoos, and the like.
<br><br><u>Primary Class:</u><br><b>Paladins</b> take their adventures seriously, and even a mundane mission is, in the heart of the paladin, a personal test an opportunity to demonstrate bravery, to learn tactics, and to find ways to do good. Divine power protects these warriors of virtue, warding off harm, protecting from disease, healing, and guarding against fear. The paladin can also direct this power to help others, healing wounds or curing diseases, and also use it to destroy evil. Experienced paladins can smite evil foes and turn away undead. A paladin's Wisdom score should be high, as this determines the maximum spell level that they can cast. Many of the paladin's special abilities also benefit from a high Charisma score.
<br><br><u>Secondary Class:</u><br><b>Clerics</b> act as intermediaries between the earthly and the divine (or infernal) worlds. A good cleric helps those in need, while an evil cleric seeks to spread his patron's vision of evil across the world. All clerics can heal wounds and bring people back from the brink of death, and powerful clerics can even raise the dead. Likewise, all clerics have authority over undead creatures, and they can turn away or even destroy these creatures. Clerics are trained in the use of simple weapons, and can use all forms of armor and shields without penalty, since armor does not interfere with the casting of divine spells. In addition to his normal complement of spells, every cleric chooses to focus on two of his deity's domains. These domains grants the cleric special powers, and give him access to spells that he might otherwise never learn. A cleric's Wisdom score should be high, since this determines the maximum spell level that he can cast.

we made it home with no police escort from the security gate to the plane i actually got to walk around the stores and buy stuff before the flight leaving Israel :p

i bought the Da Vinci Code, didnt plan on reading it on the way home but... i read the 378 pages of the 480 ...  it was really freiken good 

we landed and the grandparents picked us up and we got home yesterday but everytime we sat down to relax we both felt like we were on a plane still very odd like a dizzy feeling like i have never felt before. 

it was fun, other than sleeping on my uber greatness bed and teh dogs, i didnt want to come back.  but here i am.

hte flight from phoenix got delayed because some bitchass got sick and the plane was ready to fly away and next thing we know we are being told to get off because one fo the plane poeple were sick and that if they can't find a replacement then teh flight will be cancelled and since NASCAR was here that weekend no other flights to new york were available until the next day... panic....&nbsp; so after about 30 minutes sitting there waiting they said they found a replcament and we will be leaving in another 30 minutes.&nbsp; so instead of having a liesure stroll through new york airport wiht an hour and 30 minute layover it was a mad dash throught 65 gates in 10 minutes or less to catch the flight it Israel.

but that flight was nice, freiken long but nice.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; huge plane, saw night at the museum about 3 times and slept some.&nbsp;&nbsp; 10 hours on the plane is harsh though.

when we landed we hung out at her parents and her mom made so much food it was great tasty stuff.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

saw fireworks for their independence day and now we gonna go with her mom to hang out at the mall for a bit and spend some monies -.-&nbsp; its nice here temperature wise.&nbsp;&nbsp;

I'm going to spend all day sitting around waiting for a phone call that's never going to come.

I went to the doctor today.  

Tomorrow I'm going to get some blood tests done, then later this week I have to get another x-ray.  At least it's not an MRI.  

I go to the doctors more often then most old ladies that I know.

I'm getting paid tomorrow... I need to shop.  Nope, can't, I need to pay my bills."

From now on if you know something that has to do with me and especially with me and Levi then I don't want to hear it.  Let things take a natural route and flow on their own.

I love talking to the guy that I lost my virginity to and joking around about it
me: You know what amazes me about you?  The amount of women that you have been with and you haven't used a condom with and you never got any disease
him: well I don't want to say that I'm lucky cause I do have two kids, but I stay away from the sluts, you know that
me: yeah I know, that's why you did all the virgins, cause you know they were clean
him: *laugh* yeah
me: yeah, that's how I got the job ain't it, yeah it is.  Cause you knew my cooter was clean!!!

"event","I've spent half my day in hospitals.  First I went to Capital Heath System to get my stitches taken out, the same guy that put them in took them out.  He said that everything looks good and that I'm healing very nicely.  Then I was in the Robert Wood Johnson hospital for my mom.  She just had an operation done today around 1pm.  Everything went fine, but she will be in the hospital until Wednesday so I will be at the hospital again tomorrow.  

<lj-cut text=""some notes:"">
ER is very depressing, all the convicts, the 14 year old girls with their soon to be 14 kids, the car accident victims, the kids with their scraped knees, the old people who are slowly getting ready to die.  It's all very depressing.

The number one theme for paintings that are in hospitals are flowers.  95% of the paintings in the 2 hospitals were of flowers.  Some of them were actually really nice, and most of them were not tacky at all, but still of flowers.  Regardless I had fun going around analyzing what they were made from ""oil paint, watercolor, acrylic paint, print, print...""

Robert Wood Johnson is the nicest hospital I have ever been in.  It's new, it's clean, it's well kept, the people that serve the food are dressed as waiters.  It's all very nice, and a very healthy enviroment, I'm glad my mom is there over any other hospital."

I went to the doctor today, my regular doctor wasn't there and I ended up with some retarded fucking bitch who tried to send me back to the ER but I told her nope.  Then I had some retarded nurse, she comes into the room and looks at me and says ""so what is wrong?  do you feel sick?"" you fucking cunt my fucking lip is 4x it's normal size and I have strings sticking out of it what the hell do you think is wrong.  They both almost got their teeth knocked out. 

On the way to work I felt a very strong urge to drive my car off a bridge, into a ditch, or into a tree... but I didn't.

I'm also tired of having to listen to people tell me that I should have something done about the dog.  Fuck you, you didn't get bit, your kid didn't get bit, and your best friends dog didn't do teh bitting.  When this situation happens to you then you do as you please, until then mind your own mother fucking buisness.  Roar...

I'm sorry but I just needed to get that out.  I'm gonna go home soon, change clothes, make myself pretty, and then go out to the movies or to play pool.  I'm also considering buying a pack of cigs, I'm in a very much smoking mood."

My friends dog bit my lip yesterday.  Marta and Levi took me to ER.  We spent 3.5 hours there.  I ended up getting a tetnis shot and 2 stitches.  I always wanted to have a bigger upper lip... but this is kind of extreme, I look like a duck.

Now for the disclaimer: don't give me any pitty, none of the ""oh it doesn't look that"", ""you'll be fine"", and all that other bullshit that you usually tell people after something bad happend to them.  The moment I hear anything of that sort I am deleting you from my friends list.  Follow Hesed's way, he said ""if a dog did that to me I'd have it put to sleep right away.""  and that was it.

It's funny to come into work and see everyone of your co-workers sitting around drinking a whole bottle of scotch.  For my first hour of work I did absolutely nothing.  

Cut my last 2 classes today, twas nice.

Hung out with Levi before work.  It was a bit upsating, a bit tense, a bit uncomfortable.  Both of us wanted to tell eachother something, but we couldn't either a. get it out or b. figure out how to say it.  But it all ended on a good note.  He cares, I care, everything is fine.

<lj-cut Text="" "">
First he said ""I don't know how you can be so perfect and so right for me.  And I'm not sure if that's a good thing because every time I feel like this about a person is the time that things suck"" for about 15 minutes after that we sat almost silently and I just kept thinking <i>then why don't you just end things here so that you don't get hurt and only have the good memories left</i> but ofcourse I couldn't get myself to say it.  I was being kinda cold at ceartin points, but then he was cold to me earlier in the day.  He asked how long do I think that we can keep things up the way they are, and I said that I have no idea, I've never been in a relationship like this before.  Then I said ""I guess when we get tired of eachother.""  Then when he was leaving the car he hugged me really tight and said ""Try not to get tired of me any time soon please.""  It was very sweet.  Now I'm waiting for him to call me.  I allready want to leave work and see him."

"event","So I had to research a few issues before work today.  One of them is a text from <i>Lullaby</i> <lj-cut text=""research1"">
""'Embolism, if you ask me,' Nash says. 'You eat a girl out and you blow some air inside her, or if you fuck her too hard, either way you can force air into her bloodstream and the bubble goes right to her heart.'""
So I decided to reasearch embolism, and yes it can be an air bubble in the blood stream, that's what it usually is used as medically, and one the air bubble will get to the heart it can kill you, and if doesn't kill you when it's in your heart then it will when it gets to your brain.  But embolism does not describe that specific way of getting that air bubble into your blood stream.  Still, if that is possible it is quite scary
</lj-cut>
I also researched the thing that my mom said that Levi probably has.  She called it a <i>czyrak</i>, and in my polish-english dictionary czyrak translates to ""boil; furuncle; abcess; anbury; rising
<lj-cut text=""research2"">

furuncle
n : a painful sore with a hard pus-filled core 

boil
n: A painful, circumscribed pus-filled inflammation of the skin and subcutaneous tissue usually caused by a local staphylococcal infection.

abscess
n: A localized collection of pus in part of the body, formed by tissue disintegration and surrounded by an inflamed area.

And then anbury talked about horses and oxen so I'm leaving that one out.  The thing on his leg was this inflamed thing that was filled with blood and pus so the definitions, especially boil sound correct.  My mom told me that there should be a part of a small rust colored vain like tube inside the sore and he needs to remove that tube for the thing to heal.  He can get it out with a simple pair of tweezers.  I am so totaly nurse Betty so I'm crashing CF band practice today and bringing my tweezers with me... gotta clean em first.
</lj-cut>
The last research that I did today was on the place that Sherri, Jess, Yanni and I are supposed to visit friday. 
<lj-cut text=""research3"">
to read about our destination go <a src href=""http://www.weirdnj.com/_abandoned/marystower.html"">here</a>  and thank Wird NJ.
</lj-cut>
But unfortinately we might not go because I just found out that CF is playing on friday at Trinity.  Kill me, but I can't miss a CF show, you know that."

sometimes I still wonder if Jim has the stuff that I gave him.  If he still has I love you written on his mirror in red lipstick.  If he still has that poster that I made for him for our 6 months.  He cried after he read that poster.  If he ever put up that Rome and Juliet poster that I gave him for christmas, and if so is it still up, and does he still watch the movie that I gave him.  Does he still remember my phone number from the top of his head.  Does he still sit and think about me the same way that I am right now.  I put all his stuff away.  His note, his necklace, his shirt, his seal, it's all put away, I need to get a box for it and put it in a box, and label it <i>Jim</i>, I will also throw our pictures into the box, then put it in the back of my closet.  I also will write down his phone number on a piece of paper and put it in the box so that I can just delete his number from my cell phone.  No more memories, at least nothing evident.  The only thing that will be left to remind me of him is the Yeah Yeah Yeah's.  Blarg, I can't throw them away, maybe Levi will start reminding me of the Yeah Yeah Yeah's considering that he listens to them a lot now.

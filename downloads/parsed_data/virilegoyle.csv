"event","Fucking nice afternoon. I ran into <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/scanda1ous"">her</a> and had a nice little snogging session. If anything, <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/scanda1ous"">she</a>'s easy on the eyes.

Up for round two, <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/scanda1ous"">Mona</a>?

Heh."

Who knew that <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/proserpentina"">she</a> could be so fun to annoy? Say one bloody thing about her lack of skills to offer the Dark Lord and she's all huffy. It's fucking marvelous. Course, I can't bother her all the time, I have more important things to do, like follow the Quidditch matches and train for whenever they need me.

This is fucking disgusting. Some blokes thought it would be all grown-up to get drunk off of some vodka that they <strike>stole off of me</strike> found and now there's vomit all over the floor. 

Bloody hell. Doesn't anyone have some fucking <u>manners</u>? If this is the way future Slytherin generations are going to be like, then I think we're truly fucked. I think I'm going to show them their place, whether they like it or not."

"event","Falmouth Falcons beat Tutshill Tornadoes 250-100! FUCKING BRILLIANT game! Fucking Rough stuff, there was - blagging, blatching, you name it. Just when Zeke Gajol was going to score for the Tornadoes, he was hit by a Bludger just in time. Fucking hell. I was so relieved. The Tornadoes have a habit of leaving the left side of the pitch weakly defended, so of course any Chaser could <u>easily</u> pass by their bloody <u>pathetic</u> Beater with the Quaffle. The keeper of the Tornadoes just makes me sigh with despair. The team must have been quite desparate to let bloody Isomalt Ford be their Keeper. 

Besides that exciting game, I've been trying to handle my bloody homework. It's not as if I am going to be a high class Rune studier when I graduate. My life is destined for Quidditch. The <u>only</u> sport worth paying any attention to."

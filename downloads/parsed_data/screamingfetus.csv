"event","Well, it's not gonna be Turkey Day for me, yet, but that's because mine'll be on Saturday when SETH AND LAURA (my brother and his fiance), AND LAURA (my Bu-bu ^___^<3) WILL BE COMING OVER! Woot!! ^^

I hope that everyone else has a good holiday! I'm all the more hungry just thinking about the food to come...I swear, Lala, this feast'll have you swallowing your tongue again, to the point where I will be ready to perform the Heimlich if that does, indeed, happen! X3 It'll be great! And afterwards, it's December coming up...and we all know what THAT means...CHRISTMAS IS ALMOST HERE! WAI!! =D

I'm always so excited about Christmas, I love it. Even if I'm ever previously depressed, Christmas always seems to make me happy...and this year feels particularly chipper ^^  Now I need to make my wish list (hmm...reminder to self: take a picture of Bu to show to Santa Claus! X3) AND work on gift ideas for family/friends (better to give than to receive, yes? ^^) I have an idea worked out for Bu's gift, hopefully, and I might also have ideas for Seth/Laura, as well as the parentals...Although, I won't be thinking about THEIRS immediately tonight, since they didn't seem to want my company at dinner after I just happened to be late to the table because of some damn HW I'm working on off/on...it's funny how school ultimately puts dampers on my familial relationships like that...Anyway, so my mom stops me from coming down the stairs, and tells me to sit down, shut up, and listen to what she had to say or she'd prevent Lala from coming over...So, of course I figured that this either had to be something really important, or was just going to be some angry blabble intended to be a guilt trip, and she gets on me about how this could be Grandma's last Thanksgiving since it was her mom's last Thanksgiving last year, and then she changes her mind and tells me she doesn't care whether I come down or not. I dunno if it was just that she was taken aback by my seeming to lack a response from her words, or what. But it hurt. However, I tried to go downstairs and eat dinner, be civil, and act normal with my parents in front of Grandma. I got some food, while they were talking about how embarrassing I was being by being down there, and whilst I tried to deny their stupid remarks. And I ask them if they really don't want me eating with them, and Mom says something to the effect of basically saying she'd prefer me to go elsewhere to eat. So I take my food up to my room. That event hurt a little more. I tried to cheer up by watching this movie I rented called ""Tootsie"" that's supposed to be hilarious...but I guess my mood hampered my potential enjoyment. It was alright, though--you get to see Dustin Hoffman pose as a woman! ^^ But, nothing that I fell-on-the-floor laughed at.

I talked to Lala earlier, but I called her again just recently and missed her. Then I just read this e-mail she sent me that requested that I try calling her at 8:30 or so...and I was reading this message at 10:something. So, sorry I missed you, Bu ^^V  I wish to hear your voice again, before I go to bed...

Oh, and hey--Thanks, again, for yesterday afternoon, love. 'Twas a very, VERY good ""movie"" ^_~  Love ya so much... ^___^ <3 Wai, can't wait till Saturday/Sunday, much fun and pleasantry is to be had! ^^

Well...I need to get this damn English work done before Seth and (his) Laura get here tomorrow evening. I'll just shower in the morning, too. So, on that note:

HAPPY THANKSGIVING EVERYBODY!! o^___^o ~Radical Edward face! hoohoohwai!~

OH! I almost forgot to mention that I FOUND MY LOST ""MEGATOKYO"" PAPERBACK! L33+n355!! (which I got on our first date, Bu! LAAA! ^^)


~See you, space cowboy...~"

"event","Okay, I know it's been forever and a day+ since I've updated this thing, but to everyone who reads this--heh, 3,4,5 people? I've been trying to keep up with everyone elses journals--to everyone who reads this, I'd just like to say:

I'M BAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACK... ^^

Anyway, I'm quite tired, but I will hopefully be able to update this consistently, as I have had A LOT happen to me since last entry! Wow...last entry, I was talking about the auditions for Rumors! Holy shit... X3 Well, Rumors is over with now, and it was AWESOME!

I think I'll go into more detail about things that have been going on later. But I will say one more thing tonight, before I go, just in case anyone's caring to know how I've been (in case they don't know):

I am the happiest that I have ever remembered feeling in probably my entire life, during these past couple of months. ^^

And, on that note, I now good everybody bid evening for now! I will elaborate more on everything afore mentioned later, when I'm not so tired, 'cause there's so much to write about that's remained fresh in my memory. But I'm just too tired to think about all of it right now, as I wish not to give my brain an overload. X3

One thing's for sure, though...Even though I'm too tired to think otherwise, I'm still thinking about you, Bu. 'Love you so much! ^^

Well, anyway, till the near future arrives...
GOOD NIGHT, EVERYBODY!


~See you, space cowboy...~"

"event","I'm married to Jackie in ""Rumors""! lol, That's gonna be fun! Apparently our chemistry worked so well together at audtions! Jackie went up to read her lines (which were those of the character she got cast as ^^), and I volunteered to read the other lines with her, which were those of the character of her husband. For my actual audition, I read lines from the character of Ken, who I assume is the main character in the play since he has the most time on stage (hats off, Will, my man, for receiving that role). But, honestly, I auditioned reading that part because I thought he sounded like the most interesting (male) character in the play. But, after actually reading the whole play, I think that I could do a good job representing this other character, Glenn(sp?). I actually felt that I did a pretty good job reading the lines, and everyone thought Jackie and I were so hilarious! Which says something for me, 'cause I get so nervous at auditions (I find it to be a bad sign if I'm ever not a LITTLE nervous)! Jackie, baby, I know we're gonna make our moments SHINE! =) ""Don't you see my ears perking up??"" hehehehe.

I've just finished what I could of all fo my homework (there's this web page design assignment that required going to some link at erols.com that didn't work, so I assume I have an excuse for not being able to do that work.

...I'm still in my pajamas...

Anyway, this weekend, I hung out with the Geigers (twin brothers) on Friday; and rode around town with Ryan, Wayne, and eventually A-Rad, last night. Good times.

This morning, I ended up talking to Rebekka about dreams. And it got me to thinking, again, about how I feel creatively/artistically blocked; and how, if I could ever remember my dreams, I could perhaps use them as inspiration of some type. I dunno... I guess I just feel, sometimes, like I don't have what it takes to be in the arts as a career; like I have the desire, but not the talent... but I hope I'm just ranting and feeling sorry for myself when I think like that. I ought to stop it. But I've also figured that one of the purposes of this LJ thing is to rant, so you might see that on this journal quite often...

Anyway...Oh! I also started reading this book called The Perks of Being a Wallflower, by Stephen Chbosky, and it is really good so far! If you like stuff in the similar vein of The Catcher in the Rye (one of my favorites), or if you like a good coming-of-age story, this is right up your alley.

Well, I think I'm gonna go watch ""Identity"", now..."

"event","Let's see, my first day of school...well, it was yesterday. And today I saw the rest of my classes. Of course, I love choir and theatre. I just hope that I can get used to waking up at 5:00 or so every other morning (3x a week) to rehearse for Vocal Jazz...heh, I suppose I should start drinking heavily on the caffeine! Mr. VanSlyke's been a fun director to work with in the past, though, and choir=cool, so I'm really looking foward to it! I like all of my classes as much as hoped for, I suppose, even though we didn't end up doing squat in Web Page Design...but, hey, it was only the first day. Besides that, it's all good.

Oh! And auditions for roles in the Fall plays're tomorrow during Theatre class! Wish me luck, all 2 or so people that read this! =D

I'm still nervous around people, particularly loud, large groups of them that (seem to) look at me strangely...I HATE BEING SHY, DAMMIT!

...ahem. ^_^*

Anyway, I'm still trying to figure out putting in a picture on this profile...

I know I should get to bed, I'm tired as hell. But I still find it ridiculous that I'm not considered responsible enough, in my parents' eyes, to be allowed to be on the computer at all during the week (not to mention that I probably have to even sneak putting up this LJ while I'm living in this house). However, I may (or most likely) end up usually not posting on here as often as I'd like to, so don't...freak out, or whatever, if you happen to notice that I don't post for awhile, at any period of time.

...Anyway. Like I said before, I'm tired as hell. So goodnight. Oh, and hey, if anyone I know that knows about this LJ reads this entry, would you like to hang out some time this weekend?"

"event","Well, school starts again tomorrow...I'm actually looking foward to it, especially since I'm gonna be a SENIOR! WOOOOOOOOOO!!...yeah. I always feel a little nervous at the same time before the first day, even when going back to see people I know and wished I'd called over the summer.  This year I've promised myself to be more social. I think I've gotten a <little> better at it every year, but I've never really felt that I've taken full advantage of it (but not only because I don't drive yet). Hopefully, I'm going to change that significantly this year. But I'm psyched about going back into the Choir and the Drama rooms again, and checking out my other classes (which are all electives, besides Gov't and English), and especially seeing the old and new friendly faces. 
I'M A SENIOR, YEEESSSSSSS! Here's to an awesome Senior year."

"event","hello. 
upon request, i have finally gotten a LJ. but i'm pretty boring, in the sense that i don't do many different things with my days besides self-imposed boringness, so my entries would probably sound the same a little too often if i used this as a journal. you'd get annoyed with reading it, and you wouldn't want that would you? in fact, i'll bet you're already annoyed with reading this now. so i'll stop here for the moment, because i know i would be annoyed with reading about my life, as well.
goodbye."

has always imagined he'd look to me.  I on the other hand, watched all of this discreetly, tight lipped with tears in my eyes. Silent tears, that made no sound as I cried them. Subdued tears, so much, that no one could see them...but I cried them just the same..."""

"event","if someday soon, i should fall,
would anybody notice my absence at all?

should i be found dead in my room,
would so much as one place flowers on my tomb?

if my heart just finally burst,
would any of you feel the slightest bit worse?

if suddenly i deisappeared,
was abducted or murdered, as any had feared,
if then, i suddenly was no longer there,
i wonder...
would anyone even care?"

"event","i don't think i even remember how to update this thing, it has been so long. 
what to say. portland is a good town. not a lot going on, but nice. i've found a few places to skate. found a decent looking bank to wall the other day. haven't actually skated it yet, but maybe if it get about 35 today i'll go check it out. the park sucks, but has a nice mini. met some kid there that told me there is an indoor place not too far from here that is fun. maybe check that out soon.
friday i went on first friday art walk. i'm a geek. didn't see anything too great. one gallery had some nice, city map looking paintings. but the highlight there was when the gallery directors boyfriend backed into this little sculpture on a pedastal and knocked it off. unfortunitly it broke, which makes me feel bad, but shit, it was just kind of funny.
i read a lot for school. have three papers due this week. been reading freud. think everyone is analyzing me now.
actually bought a pass to snowboard this year. wasn't going to, but they were a really good deal. all east for $199. can't go saturdays, but who wants to do that anyway.
that is all."

"event","hardlyever do i update this thing anymore. i guess that much doesn't really happen. everyday i read about 50 pages of something, go to my studio and work on making something, work a T&A job or work with little kids. it's nice that i don't have to work some shitty job. at this time last year i had about $20 to my name and i was breaking up with my girlfriend. not that i have anymore money now, but atleast i'm happy with what i am doing. i guess the one downside is that i don't get to skateboard nearly enough anymore. i guess maybe 2-3 times a week i get out to kick around town. but i haven't skated a park in atleast 2 months. the one here sucks and to commit a day to going skateboarding is alot right now. midterm is looming next week and i have about three projects to finish. well, i guess they don't have to be finished, but atleast further along.
but maybe this weekend i'll sneak out for some good old skateboarding. good then."

"event","A Statement


Focus

Technology is overbearing, putting a constant strain on our everyday lives. This must be questioned. In a time when everything changes so rapidly, we must allow ourselves time to step away from it; outside of it. Everything is not always for the better. Question it. Respond to it.


Materials

Use everyday materials. It is in the everydayness that interest lies. Materials in and of themselves pose questions. Exploration of these materials leads to answers. Use only that which can be commonly found in the everyday and available to all.


Means

Through repetition and accumulation, forms can be found; questions can be answered. Constant observation of the overlay of lines directs next choice. Work comes from work; constant work. Questions arise. Answers are formed, forming more questions. The cycle is constant.



Ends

Means dictate ends. Rules may be formed. When applied, ends are determined from the beginning, but are unknown. Forms may be the ends, in which case, technique is the process to arrive at the ends, the latter being most important.  Constant working and re-working; questioning and re-questioning. This leads to the ends, and again to the means."

the TA job? well, george, one of the founders of the MFA program, called me on monday asking if i was still looking for work for the fall. ""sure"". and from there he told me that i could be a TA and that the class was meeting in an hour. so i walked up there, introduced myself to the professor and that was that. now, is it bad to hit on the students?"

i haven't even had time to get drunk this week. except that one night. boy was that a mistake.

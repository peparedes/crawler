For all of this you're feeling 
Low, it's not my call 
You couldn't ever love me more 
You couldn't love me more 
You couldn't love...

Me, I don't show much 
It's not that hard to hide you 
See in a moment 
I can't remember how to
Be all you wanted 
I couldn't ever love you more 
I couldn't love you more 
I couldn't love...

You want me to cry and play my part 
I want you to sigh and fall apart 
We want this like everyone else 

Stay if you want to 
I always wait to hear you say
There's a last kiss 
For all the times you run this way
It's not my fault 
You couldn't ever love me more 
You couldn't love me more 
You couldn't love...

Love me more
Couldn't ever love me more 
I couldn't love you more 
I couldn't love

You want me to lie not break your heart 
I want you to fly not stop and start 
We want us like everything else 

Maybe we didn't understand 
Not just a boy and a girl 
It's just the end of the
End of the world 

Me, I don't say much 
It's far too hard to make you 
See in a moment 
I still forget just how to 
Be all you wanted

promise; promise of a better day, promise of a greater hope, promise of a new tomorrow.

I just had a playdate with my hands.
My fingers are so sore and buff.



I played with the Powerball you stupid pervs.

I think Andrea Sylvia and Scott are sexier than I am.

During dinner we laughed like hell at nothing at all. I spit out soda all over my food and took a shit, Andrea almost barfed, Sylvia swallowed her phlegm, and Scott checked himself out in the mirror.

I eat like a pig. I'm also a badminton freak as you can see from my icon. My room is very neat because there is virtually nothing in it. I rule at the powerball. I have a mallet in my room. It's very special to me. It holds a very special place in my heart. 

I like to take pictures of myself and edit them in Photoshop.

Look at all the pretty stars!"

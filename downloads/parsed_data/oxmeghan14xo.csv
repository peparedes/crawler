I am extremly grumpy today/tonight and sorry if I snapped at/towards you.  THe heat/people/drama/shit lately is getting to me, and I'm taking it out on people taht don't deserve it.

Mr. Gale upset me greatly today, and I tired not to let anyone else see it, but when he said he didn't know if I would pass the Regents, I took it personally.  That is a direct insult to my intelligence and he doesn't know half of why I'm struggling this year..Hell I can't even figure out why things are 2198545790121 times harder to handle.  Will promised me he would help me pass, and I belive him..I think.

School is over, no more Gale, no more pain in my ass teachers, I can have the summer to myself, my friends, my family, and to relax.  I can figure out what is really bothering me so taht next year I won't feel so dumb.

This year has lowered my confidence in myself so much its crazy.  The more times I would not live up to my standards, the more frustrated I got, and the more I gave up.  I know that most people think I'm crazy, but I feel like I need help for once, and I dont like it. I have always been the one to help people in school and in life but now the tables have turned, and I am struggling to admit that I need help.




To my 2 fillibusters- I am leaning on you more than ever now, please don't let me fall :/"

"event","so its been hot lately, and everyone feels the need to start a convo that way, so i guess i will too.

It's been extremely hot lately.  There now that that's out of the way, I can get to more important things.

Friday I went shopping with the lovely Devan, and we had quite an experience...I can't stand up straight, and neither of us have enough of an attention span to do what we need to.  We danced for the people at PayLess shoes, and ""chased"" people :-)

Saturday was uneventful during the day.  My dad and I visited my grandparents and such...I don't know them anymore, and they never come to anything I do, and my dad flipped shit on them which makes me sad, but they are never there.  Afterwards we came back up here and ate dinner, and then he decided he wanted to go visit his neighborhood people, which I hate.  I don't know anyone, I'm extremly uncomfortable around them and I didn't want to go.

Well Dad got drunk again, and if you knew me last summer, you know he says some hurtful shit when he's drunk.  We were 30 minutes away from our house, and frankly I didn't want him to drive.  From just what I saw he had 9 beers, but I wasn't with him the whole time.. Scary. So at 12:30 he decides its kinda late, and he wants to go home.  How thoughtful.  He was swerving all over the place, and once again THANK GOD we didn't get stopped, we would have been screwed.  He fell asleep in the chair and I came online to talk to someone, but every single person was away, so I sat here crying, wondering why he can't grow the hell up sometime soon.  He woke up and came in here and goes what the Hell are you doing up...Get your ass in bed NOW.  I obeyed and went, I'm not starting a fight again with him.  It was 2 in the morning, and I had dance pictures at one in the afternnon, but he comes in and says no wonder you have so many problems, you dont sleep, you dont eat, what is wrong with you? You have to get up in 4 hours to take your test...Dad I don't have a test...Don't talk back to me, turn your damn light off and sleep.  Not that it will help you, you are beyond help.

So I waited until he fell asleep again to watch TV/ sit by myself and be alone.  I am tired of him and how he acts, Im tired of him talking trash about my mom and that side of my family.  I am tired of how he looks at me like I have mental issues, and feeling like I will never be good enough.  Why do I have to be the responsible one all the time?  He won't let me do anything because hes afriad I will make bad choices like he did...Well Dad I have news for you...I'm not you.


THank you for listening, I feel much better.  And no need to be all tell someone about this...It doesn't matter.  I can handle it...I just needed a space to tell my story.  Don't worry about me or him."

"event","ok so im sitting at andreas house and i was jsut thinking about boys and relationships and i got a brain cramp cuz all these things came into my head at once.

what the hell is the point of liking someone? its usually someone that either doesnt kno you exsist, doesnt like you either, or wants to mess with you.  why put yourself in that position??  maybe im wondering cuz im liking someone who doesnt like me at all, but seriously you siot there all sad and depressed and all you want is for them to look at you in that special way with taht look in thir eyes, saying your the one i want.  but how many times does that really happen? 

boys are overrated, and all of a sudden im wondering why girls go through so much effort to impress aguy and then get pissed when they dont like for who they really are.  why go through the trouble and make-up and time just for them to see u when your ""comfortable"" and say wow what happened?  high-school ralatinsips are pointless unless you find that person taht decides to be a human and treat you respectably.  other than that people love to talk behind your back and hurt you and then feeings get hurt and it completley sucks.

then i thought ok so u get into a relationship in highschool and as soon as you start to get attached and close with them they leave.  and dont say oh i get to kno them sooner than that becasue tis horseshit.  you learn something new about a person every day and to be able to kno a person inside and out it takes time not a month to decied if you work together or not.  so IF you make it through highschool then what happens when you go to different schools?  you lose touch and sit and wonder what if for the rest of your life.


friends get in the way too.  boys and friends dont go together no matter what anyone says.  they always wany more time than what they get. and the fights becasue they are trying to protect you from the ""hurt"" is rediculous.  tears and broken promises are complete crap and everyone and their cousin abner goes through it. im tired of trying to pick up my friends everytime something mean is said.  dont get me wrong i will ALWAYS be there for them, no matter what...they(she) is my entire life. but for once i want to see them happy and stay that way without smeone ruining it. 

please let teenage girls live their lives  in harmony. let htem be happy, and for god sake dont take advantage of them


the end.  srry for the rambling but i couldnt stop oce i started."

"event","goodness i missed all of you.  i spent 7 wonderful days in Cali and got a tan to prove it. yes u heard me right...i...Meghan Dralle got a tan :-)

we went to Disney, California Adventures, Long Beach, Huntingtion Beach (Surf capital of the US), Newport Beach, SeaWorld, and some other places i forgot.  OMG when we went to Seal Beach...omg this is the most exciting/stupid/wow im a loser thing ive ever done..... okay so me, mom, and RJ were walking on the right side of the pier and RJ was like ewwww its dirty over here, lets go on the other side where its cleaner, and we were like ok good idea.  so we go to the left side of the pier and there really werent that many people over there, but we figured taht was good, less crowd. so we are walking, and they do this thing in Cali where they build up a big sand hill where the waves are really big so taht it doesnt flood buildingsa and stuff.  so the waves go right up to the hill, and i was like omg how are we gonna get across? and RJ was like we have to time it perfectly, I'll go first.  So she RUNS as fast as she can, and i follow her woth mom behhinf me.  All of a sudden her left leg sinks down to her hip and as I'm yelling out to see if shes alright, both my legs sink into sand to my hips. im still running full force, but my legs stopped, so what do i do but a face plant!!!!  i dropped my pourse in the ocean with my cell phone, camera, and some other stuff, and im all wet and sandy too.  i get my self out of the quicksand, and mom and Rj are above me on the hill.  as im walking to get out i sunk again, and couldnt get out.  OMG it was soooooo scary. I cut my legs a lil bit but its gone now.  so needless to say my cell phone doesnt really work that well anymore, so if u ever call me and it gets dropped in the middle, my apologies not my fault.

Disney was Godly, there were so many good rides, and ill tell more about them later, but this is really long and i dont want to bore you. 

i missed everyone immensly, everythig i did reminded me of someone, and RJ and Russ got kinda sick of me talking about Andrea 24/7 but idc now they said next time i come out, she should too so they can meet the famous Andrea.

um im done for now, ill update in like an hour prolly cuz i have SOOOO much to talk about. oh an my mood reminds of ice cream.....friendly jubilee roll."

"event","Last night I went over to my aunts house, which was nice because I haven't been with all of my family in FOREVER.  All of my cousins were there, including Kipper's...they are family.  My fmaily told me that I was a drug dealer and left me many messages on my voicemail telling me what kind of druf they wanted, and for once I didn't mind it.  Usually it bugs me when they pick on me but not this time.

After I finished there, I went over to my andrea's house.  God I Love Her. We laugh about the stupidest things and we have fun every single time.  I left this morning and went to my dad's house.  I was nervous about coming up here, because we have been fighting a LOT lately, and I am tired of it...but everything is just peachy.

I WENT DRIVING!!! for like an hour, and for about 25 miles.  It was in Berne Knox, Westerlo, and Voohersville.  I have determined that I am not capable of making left hand turns. Hills are no fun either.  My dad is convinced I am going to be a senior citizen driver who doesn't take left turns at the ripe old age of 16.  Man that made me sound like a fruit. I'm not ripe.  Well I am, but not in a fruity way.  And no I'm not gay either hahaha.  I'm done now.

I need more days like this.  I'm in such a good mood, and I feel like me again."

Zombie Prom was amazing, and I don't know how else to describe it.  I miss everyone immensly and don't know what to do with myself anymore lol.  

The most exciting thing going on right now, is that I am preparing to go to California in 6 days!!! OMG i can't wait.  We are going to Disney 2 days, Hungtinton Beach also known as Surf City USA...and you know what tha means?? SURFER BOYS!!! my camera is going to get a workout! We are also going to Sea World and the San Diego Zoo, plus othr beaches and day trips.  I am getting to the point where I am losing sleep because I am so excited.  And I LOVE LOVE LOVE flying, so its just another thing for me to look forward (pronounced four ward). 

hmm...i would write about *someone* in here, but for the abuse I would get i am deciding not to.  Plus everytime I ahve said things I have jinxed it, so no more unless something super exciting happens.  

and I leave you with this....please comment and leave me your favorite memory of us or of something I have done that when you think of it you smile.  Just a little activity to get your brain working.

Happy Andrea... got a life AND I wrote about it! :-)"

"event","beautiful way to wake up this morning.....no school.  I slept until 10:42 and came online as soon as i got up.  I called Andrea to call Bob because I'm scared to call him by myself yet, and I needed to find out when and where this hockey game was going to be.  We talked forever, but I'm not complaining, and then Bob was like hey Donny is coming over, do you 2 want to come over too?  Ummm what do you think? of course i do, it was perfect.  So he told me that i needed to be ready in 10 minutes which wasn't gonna happen, but luckily Donny is a little more understanding, and gave me and Andrea about half an hour. 

They played guitar for awhile and we could have listened to it for hours, it was Godly.  Then his 2 brothers and his sister came home from sledding, and we discovered that Steve hates me and proceeded to kick and hit me, and Kerrianne just likes attention, shes cute though.  We had a pillow fight and Andrea loast horribly, i tried to help by attacking Bob, but he kinda just stood there while i was trying my hardest and he was like are you kidding me, and tackled me, and took my pillow away. Oh well it was a good effort...Andrea we need to plan a sneak attack, and kick their butts :-)  My apologies to Bob, didn't mean to hurt your lip...but you bit me, we are even.

Another hockey game tonight!  Bob played...yay! Um the other team was stupid and didn't let their goalie play for the last few minutes which was stupid because we scored, and ended up winning 3-1.

"event","volleyball this morning went by fast, i was having a bad day but it doesnt matter cuz i havent played in like 4 weeks, because the west wing slash math wing is very comfy.  we went to the MUG to see waht was going on slash vanna and it was busy and crowded and too many little people so we left.

andrea came back to my dads house with me and kicked ass in yoshis cookie even though she clears the cookies all wrong.  i lost track of time straightening my hair and learned how to control my frizziness while making my hair smell dryer fresh at the same time...use a dryer sheet to control frizzies.  

hockey time :-) it was busy adn the first people we saw was the  ""OMG i'm such a bitch"" and her posse... so we sat down and they all came out in their sexy lil outfits with tape around the socks?? and my sexy lil hockey player :-) was the door man and was damn good at it i might add....open, let them in, close, and lock it. and the sad part is colonie-shaker lost, but they played really well.  afterwards was teh best part cuz we went down by teh ice and he was there and he saw me and did the lil half smile and make me totally melt lol....oh and his hair is GODLY o m g its amazing.

then he saw us after and HE TOLD ME TO wAIT FOR HIM....omg so i sat there and waited for him right where he said to and then i got a hug and urg then he poked me and of course i made my lil OY noise but tis okay cuz he heard it before but i was still embarrassed.  and he wanted to ahng out but......

the stupid TIME NAZI woudlnt let me be with my friends god forbid and we got in a big fight and it was awful and mean thngs were said and it hurt my feelings, so i called mom and now im home....and im still excited and all EEEEE about it and theres much more but andrea is rushing me and i need to go.

"event","andrea slept over at my dads house tuesday night, which was nice, cuz i havent had anyone up to my dads house. i really hope she enjoyed it cuz i was worried all night that she would be like wow i wanna go home. we watched american idol and went online and totally forgot to play yoshi's cookie's (i looked up the name) and tetris.

when we were woken (waken waked woke urg i HATE that word) up at 11:30 we went ice-skating and andrea was pretty good at it, she doesn't like going fast, which could be a problem if she wants to learn how to play hockey haha.

then!!!! later that night we went to a hockey game :-) and it was sooo much fun.  the person that i was watching didn't play but it was all okay because it was made up for after he came out!!!  eeeeeeeeeee it was soooo great. umm too bad andrea cant keep up with ims cuz 5 minutes turned into an hour and 5 minutes and then it was too late and out plan was foiled again batman.  no worries we will try again tonight.

i went skiing today adn it was sooo freakin cold on the mountain.  i got windburn and i look like a raccoon but idc its kinda cool. i officially almost got frostbit on my fingers, not cool.  i need better circulation.

um thats about it.....im done with this i surrender. *white flag*  PLEASE STOP FIGHTING ALL OF YOU!!!! please, i hate it"

"event","not like y'all really wanna hear this but im gonna tell you anyway.  i talked to jake last night until like 11 or so, and then i tried to fall asleep but i as thinking about WAY too much stuff, so i came online and talked to andrea for like .3 seconds before she went to bed and then jake came on again. and once again he calmed me down and i actually felt like i could fall asleep so i went back to bed.

all day yesterday i had been feeling really dizzy and whenever i stood up i got those fuzzies in my eyes and couldnt see anything, which isnt weird for me, i get that a lot so i didnt think anything of it.  then i talked to andrea later that night and she asked me if i had gotten sick to my stomach cuz when i stayed over at her house on friday and all her cousins were there, all of them and andreas mom had some kind of stomach bug. and i said no i hadnt gotten sick, AND I FORGOT TO KNOCK ON WOOD, which was my first mistake. then second one was the chocolate milk at midnight which does NOT look pretty the second time around.

i didnt fall asleep at all, and the next time i woke up it felt like my stomach was turned over and was in a knot. I have never felt pain like that before. and i felt REALLY nauseous, so i went into my bathroom and that was the first time i got sick, it happened about 4 more times before my alarm went off at 6 30, and i realized that i had not slept at all all night.  needless to say we skipped skiing and now im jsut waiting for andrea to find out if she needs a root canal, so she can get her ass over to my dads house and we can hang out and have a grand old time.

lifes a bitch and then you die.  i despise selfish people.  ganc guo and have a nice day."

"event","today was an eventful day.  we woke up this morning and skipped voleyball again fot the 9 gillionth time.  we were gonna sleep in the english hallway but it had a little leftover skunk smell, or according to Ed possibly a gas, no sorry dude that was straight-up skunk.  the math hallway was nice and quiet and a nice place for a lil nap.  when we woke up it was time for a 90 minute long game of tetris, which i came nowhere near the high score so it was a complete waste of time.

i came home (to your house) and we took a road trip and i learned that im backwards when i skateboard and that i dunno i guess thats bad. lol we came home again (to your house) and we watched the first part of one godly  movie...dirty dancing havanna nights, which we need o finish btw.  then it was off to anthonys party. yes i got made fun of for awhile because i was laryngits girl, but it was all good.  people were in bad moods and the negative atmosphere kinda got to me, but it turned around :-)

SAW sucked the first time, but the second time wasn't so bad...hehe im gonna learn to play guitar and go to a hockey game omggg i cant wait"

"event","So today I had a headache and no voice but i was FORCED to go to school because i had to had in 2 papers, so i told my mom that i was coming home during 5th and she didnt believe me. so i handed my papers in and then came home just like i said i would.

i slept for a little while and took a loooooong hot shower which made me get my voice back.  i was having a dream that my house was burning down and all of sudden my phone rang and i realized that if my house was burning down then i wouldnt have a phone, so i jerked myslef out of a nice peaceful sleep to answer my phone that was ringing. and when i picked it up someone asked me if i wanted to go to jeepers woth them to keep them company but i could NOT figure out who it was because i was all confuzzld.  anyway it turned out to be who else but andrea.

so we went to jeepers with her little cousins and the first ride we went on was the super tall super scary extremely dirty (hey look how dirty the ceiling is, did i stutter?) and then the circles in the bumper cars made me sooo dizzy.  the ""jungle play area"" with the 7 year old boys going..""hey ladies"" hows it going....just fne pervert. and then i tred to use my ""sexy"" voice and i sounded like a guy on helium trying to be sex while someone was stepping on his vocal chords so that he couldnt tlak.

"event","this is all bitching and complaining so if you dont wanna hear it, dont read it.

oh man yesterday sucked ass, i havent had a good old fashioned bad day like that in awhile, i dont miss it.  to start off i am EXTREMELY confused as to what to do right now. i said if one person told me that there was no chance then it would be easier to make the ""right"" decision, and thats what i got.   i just forgot how much it hurts everytime, and yes i know that its my fault because im the one that gets myself into it and i dont listen to the people that acutally know what they are talking about, but im stubborn and i cant let go of the hope that maybe hes changed and that hell come back to me. i dont know if i will ever let go of that, i want to though. so now its down to 2 different ones, and i dont even know what i want anymore.  so you know what im doing, im making myself feel horrible and guilty and making myself sick over this. I NEED TO STOP.  i dont think people realize how much i torture myself over decisions, you would think its easy but its like every little thing i need to decide on, i think the world will come to an end if i make the wrong one. want an example?? COLLEGE, im starting to get stuff from colleges, and i thougth okay a few colleges will make me wake up and realize waht i need to do to get into a good one, and you know waht it did? when i got my report card i had a panic attack.  yea a wake-up call okay. now i need to go back to the old me stressing constantly about grades, and i dont want to do taht, im having more fun this year than i was last year and i dont wanna go back, but i know its the only way im gonna feel better.

that was just the stuff i worried about durin the day, then i got home and realized that it was my moms birthday(today) and guess who didnt have time to get her a present?? okay talk about a guilt trip, i FREAKED cuz as much as i am not getting along with ehr, its her freakin birthday and i cant find time for my family anymore. so with all this stress and some bad news i got last night that really set me over the edge, i got the worst migraine i have ever had before.  i was rolling around on my bed crying becasue it felt liek someone was stabbing me in my eyes while someone else was hitting me over the head with a baseball bat and then poking it.  i took 4 of something, and that was about 2 hours after i ahd taken 4 extra strength advil, yea too much.  but you know the sad part?? it didnt help at all, not one bit, after all that my head felt exactly the same, and i fell asleep at about 7 30. then andrea called at 8 15 or so, and i talked to her for like half an hour and fell asleep again.  the next time i woke up was at 10 when my mom came in to tell me to do my homework, and i discovered that i couldnt open my eyes without throwing up.....found that one out the hard way. so i did 10 cards for chem and fell asleep for the rest of the night.

so needless to say, today i stayed home...but im not enjoying some me time, cuz im worrying about what im missing in school and play practice after school.  i also need to figure out something for my mom, which i really dont know what im gonna do, but ill be creative.  so im off to relax and try to stop freaking

sorry for wasting so much of your time bitching, but it had to come out, i dont blame you if you didnt read it....oh and by the way to andrea, brianna, savannah, jake, amanda, ciara, and anyone else who advised me to stay away, im sorry for not listening, you were all right."

umm then came the fun part, me and garcia and paris all walked to the mall, and once we figured out the proper order for walking it was fine, im sorry im so obsessive but it NEEDS to be a certain way :-) 

oh yeah last night at dance...me devan and andrea all wore powerpuff colors without planning it, and i was buttercup, andrea was the pink one (blossom??) and devan was the blue one (bubbles??) so that was the only thing that got me through dance cuz i got pissed that danielle wasnt teaching us the right way, and then heaven forbid we have fun, or else those bratty lil 4th graders who we now know talk about us behind out backs...freaks

today was uneventful except that mr gale is yelling at me A LOT lately, im not doing anything and hes like miss dralle what are you doing.....uh breathing sitting, listenig, what the hell do you want me to do? you large oversized string bean jesus let me be.  

play practice goes by quicker every day, i really like the people doing it this year, i get along with them really really well, and im making new friends, whoda (like whoooo-duh) thunk?? me being somewhat outgoing, lol.  i ab-so-bloomin-lutley cannot wait for the performances, this year is alraedy 100x more fun than last year.  eeeeeee 

im confused as to how im feeling right now, cuz i mean i like a few people, but i dont know waht to do about it for fear of hurting people but who knows, no matter waht i do i end up hurting everyone, and then i feel guilty in massive amounts for ridiculously long amounts of time.

ok so let me know what y'all think of this, i dont even begin to compare with garcia, but im trying something new here:

through the pain and agony
the bruises and scars
you keep going back
to the same black love

you have been infected with his lies
you sit there and take it with a smile
your heart so tainted
your soul turned inside out
but you stick to him thinking if you let go
everything will fall apart

waht you can't see
is the dreary mess you have become
a cold heartless mass
that was once warm and caring

way before his prescence sucked you away
you love life
you had a glow about you
one might say you were almost angelic

it just goes to show what temptation can do
a simple offer, and he began to take you over
the fire in his eyes was addictive
and now that fire is taking you down
erasing your glow and filling in pain
the void inyour soul is getting bigger
the thing you feel you are missing is happiness

you no longer have control
he wont stop until you are gone
i know you can't see it
but your life is not a life anymore
he has taken over."

"event","today was loooooooong.  me and my dad and his best friend dwight went skiing at stratton which was awesome with all the snow, but skiing in powder really puts a strain on your leg muscles. i kept losing my balance and getting stuck. oh did i mention that with the wind chill it was about 30 belows zero and at the top it was almost 40 below. jesus christmas thats cold.

so i did good, i was numb all day but i was happy cuz i <3 skiing.  then the last run of hte day, my goggles were sooo fogged up, there was a pretty good layer of ice on them and it was dark and my eyes couldnt adjust to the light, so i couldnt see the snow very well, its hard to explain.  i tired taking them off and almost froze my face off. baddd idea.  well 3/4 of the way down guess who takes a spill??

i havent fallen in 3 years, and today well i broke that streak.  i landed on my right hand, then my face came next with all my weight on my right arm as it bent backwards. sooo lucky i didnt break an elbow, but i did a number to my shoulder. it keeps popping and its stiff and yes im grumpy.

but guess waht?? IDC cuz it was sooooo worth it, i would do it all over again yes im that crazy :)"

midterms are next week, and we all know how stressed meghan gets. lol so im studying my ass off cuz i am so scared that im gonna fail my math regents or the chem midterm. 

i was hurt this week for awhile but idc cuz im me and nothing is gonna change that.  deal with it, i do.  

the dance got cancelled which is good and bad, i can now hopefully find a dress (and a date) and people that couldnt come this time can come next time.  but i was really looking forward to this so i hope the one in february will be as much fun as this one was supposed to be.

"event","But you were history with the slamming of the door
And I made myself so strong again somehow
And I never wasted any of my time on you since then

But If I kiss you like this
And if you whisper like that
It was lost long ago
But it's all coming back to me
If you want me like this
And if you need me like that
It was dead long ago
But it's all coming back to me
It's so hard to resist
And it's all coming back to me
I can barely recall
But it's all coming back to me now
But it's all coming back

yea that pretty much sums it up.  I've tried to deny it for so long, that the feelings are gone, there isnt anything there anymore.  But now that we're talking on a daily basis again, everything came rushing back.  And thats not whats killing me, its the fact that I KNOW HE DOESNT FEEL THE SAME WAY!!!! i just want to tell him that i can be everything to him, that i can make him happy, but he wont listen to me.  Talking to him and knowing there might never be anything again is better than not talking to him at all, but he is so perfect for me, i know people dont think so, but when i talk to him i feel full i cant stop smiling, and its like this glow that i dont feel with anyone else. who knows i must be crazy, but i know one thing....im not gonna get over him for a long ass time.  its been so long already, and i havent gotten anywhere, so i keep telling myself i have to get over him, but what if im not supposed to get over him??? what if were supposed to be together??? no more what ifs im done for now"

"event","so this weekend was fun.....2 and a half days at my andreas house, and we caused some trouble, and we had incredible amounts of fun.  Im sorry about the glass, i was barely holding it and it slipped, yes im a ditz.

okay so andrea has a gecko which is disgusting by itself, cuz its a lizard and it sheds and it eats bugs and thats just gross. well her cat ruby decided to attack the plastic bag of live crickets that she feeds her gecko, and about 15 crickets escaped and were all over andreas room, and i HATE HATE HATE bugs, and we, well andrea, i was in a corner cuz have i mentioned i hate bugs, were trying to catch them all, and by the time we went to bed most of them were caught, but there were still some loose in her room, and i swear all night i could FEEL them on me.  and then we were on the phone with someone and tehy wished that the bugs would crawl in my nose and ears and eat me alive....cough*josh*cough.  so of course i woke up about 30 times and check for bugs on my face, blech


winter ball is coming up and i am dateless, and mad about that, cuz i was planning on going with torin but that didnt work out so w/e.....um i have one person in mind but im not asking him so andrea and i decided to go together unless something works for her, and sorry hun but knowing him it wont lol

things have a way of complicating themselves at the BEST times (note the sarcasm) it was mutual, but it still sucks...just more proof that they is something wrong with me oh welll

yea my feelings have been hurt sooooo much this weekend by like 4 different people, look i cannot help how i feel or who i like, i know its not the best person in the world but its addicting and i cant stop, so im sorry if u dont like it or like me but you need to start dealing with it cuz the more you tell me no the more pissed off i get. so in conclusion this was a good break with the exception of a few things

"event","I had an intersting weekend.  On Saturday I had Volleyball in the morning with my beloved Paris.  Have I mentioned lately how much I love volleyball??  The more I play, the more addicted I get.  WE have a bunch of tournaments coming up, and some of them mare pretty far away..I'm getting kind of excited, we all know how me and Andrea get over long periods of time....and 3 hours in a car or bus is gonna be interesting to say the least.

I went back up to my dads house later Saturday night, which was good, because I got used to things around him, and it kind of scares me how much more I like it up there.  My excuse has always been that things would be too hard, and that Dad and I wouldn't get along after a long period of time.  After staying with him for a week, I realized how much happier I was up there, and now I can't think of an excuse other than that I don't want to leave my friends and start over again.

Saturday night I watched gothika at midnight with no lights on, alone in my living room with noooooo blanket to hide behind, and I didnt fall asleep until 3 in the morning, 3 hours of sleep for skiing!!

Sunday me and dad went skiing at Stratton, and as nice as it was to get back to skiing, I think we over-did it a little bit.  We did 6 black diamonds, and 4 double-black diamonds.  I had so much fun, i forget how much fun I have with Taylor and my dad and our ski crew!  

When I got home I got to work on the nine million journal entries I had to do for Monday.  I stayed up until 3 in the morning, and I still had 4 more to do, plus my spanish homework, an english quiz, and chemistry review, that I NEEDED to take my times on.  When I woke up on Monday morning, I had hives from something, and a panic attack from not doing any work, and i was tired and sore from skiing.  So I stayed home, and enjoyed a day of sleep and being a bum.  More to come later I'm being rushed away by the one and only vanna...LOSER!

"event","wow long time since i have updated....my apologies...december 26th, ouch.

since then not a heck of a lot has happened.  I am staying at my dads house for the week cuz mom is gone thank god!!! oops was that out loud?  

Over x-mas break i stayed at andreas (aka Paris) for 3 days and 2 nights (i sound like im giving away a vacation) and we caused all kinds of trouble, annoyed many many people, called people prolly every 3 minutes and watched so much that 70's show.  Paris can become a pretty big loser when she is on the phone with *someone* and hit her head prolly 4 times while i was there.  We went to see Darkness and while me and her were hiding behind her jacket shaking (wasnt that scary but we got caught up in the moment) the people behind us decide to reach through the seats and grab our shoulders and scare the crap out of us.  so what does Paris do?? give them her number...riiiight cuz thats what people do when they almost pee their pants in fear.  little did she know she gave it to someone who was going to turn into a stalker haha.  we made soap and almost set the house on fire, we found the coolest drawing thing ever....aquadoodle, and we taught a small child how to swear.  i had so much fun we must do it again soon my dear


i went home for half a day and then went to vannas house for 2 days, and went to the new years eve party at anthonys, which was sooooooooooooo much fun.  there were a lot of people there that i got to know better, and i had so much fun, i just wish i coulda slept over.  there are a few things i wish had done and some things i wish i hadnt done, but everything turned out for the better, so idc.  vanna and i got home at like 1 and we stayed up until about 3 talking about all the drama and gossip and *things* that happened to us and me and her at the party.  Needless to say it was wonderful.



Well today is a snow day and im going to make use of it by being a bum..... sleeping and watching tv and doing nothing.

"event","yesterday was pretty awesome, i got just about everything i asked for and some things i didnt ask for.  my family cooperated and behaved nicely for the most part except when it comes to me.  About a month ago my friend and I were in the family room and she threw a ball at me adn it bounced off my fingertips and broke one of my grandmas figurines.  Well being the only girl and also being known as the family jinx, they have not let me forget about it.  All day it was oh dont let meghan touch that she might break the head off, dont let meghan near anything glass it shatters before her.  meghan dont go near the waterford you cant be trusted near it anymore.  yes they were joking but after awhile of the same jokes and every single person in my family saying it, it starts to get to me.  then i was wearing this pink shirt with a cowl neck and my aunt was like so meghan did u get good money working at hooters tonight, oh wait your flat you cant work there, how was the street corner...and then later she wrote on an etch-a-sketch meghan is a slut.  Okay is it me or is that taking things a little too far, its embarrassing and people wonder why im so self-conscious.  If i could get rid of my family or make them nicer i would, because the things they say and do to me are really getting to me.  No one gets how badly i want to be accepted and how much i want them to like me. I feel like a disappointment to them.


I did get to talk to Heather, my cousins new fiance, and it looks like the wedding is going to be in october 2006, my senior year, its far away but i think i get to be in it!!!  Her ring is beautiful and my cousin designed it it was adorable. oh side note, when he gave me my present he spelled my name wrong, twice.  Meagan, no thats not me, and hes family, shouldn't he know hoe to spell my name after 15 years?



thank god for friends, a little slap in the face now and then is what i need, a point in the right direction, thanks for stinking....haha im gonna leave that....*sticking* by me while im trying to get me back and trying to get teh strength to live life without relying on people, so thanks, things are gonna get better now."

Then my mom's car died, which I know sounds bad, but Andrea gave me a ride to school this morning so I got to spend even more time with her.  We talked and I heard some stories....let's hope for the best hun!

Don't remember much about school until right before 9th.  I was standing and talking to Will and I was freaking out talking to him, asking about Torin....well he was standing right behind me!!!!  I turned around and he kinda laughed at me, but its ok from him.  We stood there for a second and then he asked me out!!!!!  I was in complete and total shock, I was hoping it would happen, but I wasn't sure if it really would. Remid me to be bold more often.

"event","Today was completely surreal

If you havent't already heard, which you must be dense if you haven't, Justin Mirabile, 17, passed away last night/early this morning.  He was a senior and from what I can tell, had an amazing impact on the people around him.  Personally I didn't know him, but I have bumped into him in the hallways..yesterday :(

It sucks that this is the wake-up call for people, that we needed a loss of life to realize the dangerous things we do.  Everyone will be more careful now, but how long will it last before we start to take life for granted again?  Like I said I didn't know him very well, but just the fact that it happened here, to us, in Colonie freaks the hell out of me.  This is the kind of thing you see happening to schools far away from here, it doesn't happen to us....well guess what it did, and it completely sucks.

People were a wreck today, it was people crying and hugging everywhere you went.   It didn't hit me until 5th period, when I read Devan's poem, it made me realize that he really is gone and that his family is suffering, and that we will never see him again.  After that it was all downhill from there.  I feel weird that this upset me so much cuz I didn't know him, but the what if's got to me.

What if that had been one of my best friends, what was the last thing I said to them, and do they know how much they mean to me?  Well if you dont, this is to all my closest and bestest friends, you know who you are..... You people are the reason I wake up in the morning, the reason I go through every day and the reason that I am happy.  Without you people, I would be no one.  I love every one of you, and I hope that you will always remeber the impact you have had on my life.

Justin- You will never be forgotten, but you will always be missed.  Rest in Peace always and forever 12*14*04"

the waking up at 5:30 was one of the not so fun parts but knowing that i could sleep on the bus made me feel better, lol.  We got off the bus at bryant park which is very pretty, and there were little shops and stands to look at, and i got 3 scarves, green, pink, and blue, sooo pretty.  We then proceded to walk allllll the way to central park, which let me tell you is not a hop skip and a jump away.  I was extremely excited because mom got tickets to the Nutcracker which is my favorite ballet of all time!! Well of course that was too easy, and things never go the way they are supposed to for me so yea.  We find out that the ballet is designed for little kids, and NO lie there was not a sinlge child over the age of 5 there.  Screaming babies, the little girl that kept kicking my seat for fun and the theatre was smaller than the auditorium in our school.  I was not a happy camper.

On the way back,w e decided to walk to Macy's, well the theatre was at 52nd and 4th and Macys is at 35th and 6th, and we walked the ENTIRE way. thank god for 5th avenue, cuz if i wasnt interested in all the shops i wouldnt have made it.  We stopped in sax 5th avenue which is a joke, there was a dress that looked like a dog ate it threw it back up the put it through a shredder and then glued it back together without looking, adn the price was 6,000 dollars...wow.  We went in the disney store which is 3 floors, and then macys which is HUGE and the windows were decorated like the polar express and it was amazingly pretty.  I bought 2 purses from street corner dudes, RIGHT before the police came and shooed him away, that was scary, but the purses are really pretty lol.

I relaized how smelly it is down there, its not only really hard to breathe, but it smells like crap lol.  People are rude and they knock me over and then swear at me....omg funny story, this lady cut me off and then stopped in the middle of the sidewalk, and i was like excuuuse me, and she starts swearing at me in spanish... well the look on her face when i did it back to her was PRICELESS.


more to come later, x-mas party to go to, 13 days until Santa comes!!!
pardon my spelling mistakes, no time to check it over"

You are a gentle soul, with good intentions toward everyone.
Selfless and kind, you have great faith in people.
Sometimes this faith can lead to disappoinment in the long run.
No matter what, you deal with everything in a calm and balanced way.

You are a good interpreter, very sensitive, intuitive, caring, and gentle.
Concerned about the world, you are good at predicting people's feelings.
A seeker of wisdom, you are a life long learner looking for purpose and meaning.
You are a great thinker and communicator, but not necessarily a doer.

"event","yea so i had a totallll meltdown during chemistry today, mr gale set me off and it was all downhill from there.  

kiddie theatre was amazing....ill write more about that later, i need to get this crap out right now

we got back at the end of 5th and i knew that if i didnt tell mr gale that i would be there for 7th and ust showed up id get in a shitload of trouble, so nice little me told him i was here and i would be there after i ate lunch cuz i missed mine.  hes like no your not gonna eat lunch youre coming to class, well not only was i already pissed but i had a killer migraine (still do, thats 4 days in a row, they are getting wayyy worse) and i desperatley needed to eat.  i yelled at him and you know me i DONT yell, well i yelled at him and i had a few spectators who were like whoa is that dralle? yes it was me

i did end up going to lunch freaked out on andrea and alaina got all upset and *someone* in that lunch was like whoa, and shut up garcia and andrea cuz i cant help it hes like just WOW. especially today, when he wears those things haha if u know me you know what im talking about!  i left there crying and then thats when i freaked.

mr gale took me outside the room and was like wahts wrong i can tell its something big cuz ive never seen you this upset or freaked out, and you know how i am when people pressure me, i freak and break down, and well thats what happened.

i do need to say thanks to everyone but especially erin and will cuz they are the ones that calmed me down like a millionith of a percent.  i walked aimlessly around the school for almost an entire period crying and stressting and listening to erin and it helped, cuz i got crap out, but the rest of the day i was worrying about all my stuff and im still not feeling any better

the more i think about everything the more things i find that are going wrong, and im not going into detail cuz i dont know who reads this and well it involves people and there are some people that i dont want them to know how i feel or what tehy did to me.  People hurt me wayyyyy more than they know and i dont want them to feel guilty or anthing so we will leave it there.  But im telling you if people continue to treat me like they do i swear im gonna flip on someone again, things had better start getting better before i lose it for good."

"event","yea so right now im not happy at all, no matter how hard i try to cover it or deny it im so upset and confused and there are only a few people that can seem to really make me feel better anymore.  I've been ditched, replaced, yelled at, and forgotten enough for a lifetime.  so blah.  okay boys just completely suck there is no doubting or denying it, they make me hurt and they get me soooooo very fusterated >:( 
I went from liking 5 people and having 4 be interested to liking 5 and having possibly 1 interested, and the best part is that it all happened within a 48 hour period, just one nope sorry right after another.  

I keep telling myself that I am a good person and that the right person will come along eventually and that i just need to wait, but let me tell you i am running out of patience.  People around me are happy and getting what they want, well it's my turn and yes I realize how selfish I am being but well too bad, I'm bitchy and i dont care!  

I can see myself changing for the worse, and I hate it.  My grades are dropping, and I dont care about stuff I normally care about anymore, everything is so much harder and I cant seem to keep up with everyone else.  People are adjusting, but I want things to go back to how they were, when everything was easy and I was happy and things worked in my life.  Things are so complicated and there are times when I feel like I'm sitting on the sidelines watching my life pass by and like I have no control over what happens to me anymore.

AUGHHHHHHHHHHHH i swear i cant take much moreeee, things better start changing or i dunno what i will be forced to do"

"event","Yea so last night was totally amazing!  It had been awhile since I had been online for a long time, and I talked to a few people that just completley made my night.  So basically if I was talking to you last night for awhile, you made me forget everything thats going on, and I honestly enjoyed myself for the first time in a longggg time! So thank you.  Some highlights were cereal (holy crap I'm still going on that one) and ashtrays (van wow never a dull moment around you).

Ever since I made that decision, which if you dont know what it is you don't need to, yes I have been upset that it's over, but mom and I aren't at each others throats anymore, which is a welcome surprise.  Life has been so stressful and upsetting lately that I needed this calm in the storm, I was about to g over the edge.  

Thanksgiving should be fun...let's see how many more bruises I can add to my many! lol  No worries I will add another one after dinner because I know that you all love to read about my dysfunctional family and our many crazy times.  

May your turkey be white (cuz dark meat is nastyyy) and may your stomachs be fat....

more to come later!"

"event","well I have always wanted to have one of these....so here it is.  Well my life is screwed up to say the least, but somehow it's not bothering me as much anymore.  I think I am becoming numb to it.  Nothing huge happened between me and mom, but it's still a forced relationship, it doesn't feel right or real.

But thanks to my friends I get my mind off of it.....take last night for example!  So I go to the mall with Piche and did a damn good not to mention fasttt shopping trip.  We had like 40 smells on us by the end because it seems we have an odd fascination by scents!  I got to Nikki's and we watched Nemo and had pizza and flung happy birthday confetti at each other.  Well after that we ended up watching Fear of the Dark, and for an independent film it was DAMN scary.  Devan and I were on the chair under the blanket, and I swear we both have permanent nail marks in our arms, and in Devan's stomach...oops sorry Dev!  PIche, Brandy, and Burke all fell asleep while Nikki Dev me and Nikkis mom were freakin out!  I fell asleep once we got upstairs but not before I smacked my head about 4 times!  My apologies to Devan for cramping her space, but she slept on my head, yes actually on my head!!

I raked leaves for the rest of the day and well here we are.....more to come later"

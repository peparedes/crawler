"event","Here I am, slowly crawling my way back to LJ.  I still don't have real internet yet, but it's getting better each day.

So now, with my copious amounts of free time [haha], I've had a chance to look over all my internet accounts and basically overhaul a bunch of them.


I'm torn on whether to revamp the shit out of this account or to just make a new one.


Any thoughts?"

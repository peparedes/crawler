"event","So, on Tuesday night at about 8:25, me and five other PEACEFULL protesters were arrested outside a resturant serving fois gras. I was kept in a police cell untill 3:30 AM and interviewed. I cant even remeber the interview because i was so fucking tired and hungry, police cells arnt exactly the comfiest places on earth, not to mention the fucking mad bloke in the cell opposite to me who wouldnt stop screaming something about needles. I'm currently out on bail until May 17th and im under suspision of ""Harrasing a man in his home."" Harrasing a man in his fucking home?! We were handing out fucking LEAFLETTES. Seriously, its stupid, and not to mention totaly against the human rights legislation. Ever heard of the right to peacefull protest?! I know im bitching and moaning far too much, and i know a night in a police cell is nothing compared to the suffering of millions of animals, and it wont stop us, we'll be back there next tuesday carrying out the same lawfull protest.

"event","<small>Tonight, i really dislike the way things change so so quickly. I honestly scares me a little how sudden relationships change and how hard it is too keep up with them.

Last night i had a conversation with James.
He got me down to a T.
""You long a father figure of a boyfriend, hence your dependancy on the more comforting aspects of a relationship.Like hugs and stability.""

I think thats what scares guys off you know.
I do have a honest dependancy, i am not a strong person despite what it may seem. I find it hard to function without someone holding me up, and it messes with my head when that support has suddenly gone.

But, at least i can spend time re-aranging my room, reading philosophy books, customising tee-shirts, mounting things, making collages perhaps even learning to knit. I might even start making notebooks.

"event","<small>Today, I have never wished for simplicity more in my life. I wish I could go back and just hold myself back for a while. I'm always rushing towards B without even acknowledging the existence of A.  Causing everything to become far too up and down for me right now. There are so many things i should tell people. Perhaps it would be easier if we could read minds, it would save me having to open up and let things spill all the time.

I have a (free! i love Jessops) colour film to do my project on homeless people in portsmouth, and an excuse to go back to my local Jessops. I still cant work out if the guy who does the developing is cute or not."

<small>Danny & Ash last saturday. Waiting.
Seriously, its the only good picture that came out of that film. I need to get my flash sorted out.


Just a warning, prepare for some major ranting when i get home.
On a lighter note, i managed to get out of photography today giving me extra time to complete my project and tommorow to shoot when im in london.

Downside. I get my graphic design project back today.

Upside/Downside a possibly awkward meeting today.

Upside i put up some pretty good anti fur/ anti kfc posters yesterday for world vegan day.

But you know that feeling when you need to speak to someone so bad, and its eating up your insides, and you feel empty because you need just a few moments with that person, but its impossible? And all you can think about is speaking to them, but every night you wait for some kind of correspondence, and yet, nothing, and you go to bed empty?

Well....
Yeah.

"event","<P><STRONG><FONT color=#cc33cc>SO today is Monday.&nbsp; Well it was an alright day i guess.&nbsp; I was actually early to school today which was a good thing.&nbsp; Then i went to :</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#cc33cc>1st period- Went over our packets that no one remembered to do. They suck sooo bad...I quit math!&nbsp; </FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#cc33cc>2nd- Another dang packet with like a gazillion and one SAT-like words on them.&nbsp; What the heck is up with teachers and packets?</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#cc33cc>3rd- More work in Chem...go figure. But hey, look on the bright side! I got a 55 on my test!! YaY!</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#cc33cc>4th- Mr. Rine tried to teach but it was just too cold in his room! Like everyone had their jackets/hoodies on. So as usual no one listened.</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#cc33cc>5th- Big Macbeth exam review.&nbsp; Pretty simple but watch, the test is gonna blow.&nbsp; All i got to say is thank god its all over...im gonna have a party after the test!</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#cc33cc>Lunch- Me and Linny got the last 2 pieces of Turkey! haha</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#cc33cc>7th- We took more notes. I got ""yelled"" at because i was making Linny laugh...im sorry!! haha&nbsp; But i wasn't the only one who thought taters was funny! Good one Chris.</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#cc33cc>Softball practice was ok.&nbsp; My pitching is getting steadily better. The best part of practice was when Liz told me how when she was in 1st grade and when the teacher would say ""put your thinking caps on"", Liz would get all upset because she was the only one without a thinking cap!! haha&nbsp; That made my day!</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#cc33cc>SO on the way home i almost got hit by an old man that was pulling out of the ""in between"" lounge. Gosh...Fricken Idiot!!</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#cc33cc>Then i came home and ate. Tried to study Macbeth but i have like nothing to study. I took a break and went to CVS to buy jellybeans...Yum! Then Duane came over and we hung out for a lil as i studied some of my chem....im really gonna try to bring up that 55!! I started to annoy him though because i was gettin so hyper as usual! I still &lt;3 U!! lol &nbsp;Mr.V-sack called, finally, to verify that info for the college prospects thing. Thank God! I thought it would never get done...O well, Im exhausted......o0*GiNa*0o</FONT></STRONG></P>

"event","<P><STRONG><FONT color=#cc33cc>Sooooo....Haven't updated in&nbsp;a week. Figures, How typical of me!! The last week was pretty cool I guess considering i don't remember what i did already. haha Im such a dork! Well i think the movie was on Friday because we had a half day.&nbsp; I was feeling a lot better...I think?&nbsp; We watched Napoleon Dynamite which totally rocked! Duane and Joe were getting mad at me and Lindsay because we kept saying the lines from the movie that didn't even happen yet.&nbsp; We &lt;3 U!! Cool Beans!....lol Jenny. Anyways, this weekend was cool.&nbsp; Went to Duane's Aunt's suprise party on Saturday.&nbsp; It was fun. I wish i had a family that big lol.&nbsp; They are all soo nice!&nbsp; I had a good time even though Duane spilled orange soda on me and i had to go home and get changed...thanks a lot!! haha&nbsp; Sunday was boring...all i did was practice a little bit.&nbsp; Funny how i can run without that dang brace on but it kills me to run with it on.&nbsp; It just figures they won't let me run without it on either! And Today.&nbsp; It was ok.&nbsp; Math was&nbsp;boring as usual. We didn't do our quiz again which is totally fine by me!!&nbsp; Mrs. D's we did Impromptu speeches which suck ass!! You have to go up infront of the class, pick out a topic from a jug, then you have like 5 seconds to come up with 5 sentences on that topic and you cannot say ummm or aaaaa.&nbsp; You have to do it like a regular speech! Its nuts!&nbsp; Chem was alright....more problems. No physics today. We went to the gym because Mr.Rine was giving blood.&nbsp; I got sick just watching everyone! Mrs.D's class again....annoying. Everyone fought over the playbills and this continued on through the ENTIRE lunch period...Dang! lol Mr.Bush's test rocked! It was sooo easy because it was the same as the review sheet.&nbsp; NO softball today....awesome! Me and jodi stayed after for a minute or two to talk about getting some people together to figure out decorating stuff for prom.&nbsp; Now im just sitting here nervous as all hell.&nbsp; Some guy from the ""College Prospects of America"" is coming to do an interview today. Im scared! Its some program worth a <EM>few</EM> bucks and its used for college recruiters to be able to see you and know about you and stuff.&nbsp;Me and Dave P. were picked to do this for Hanover. Thanx a lot to Dave for making me nervous&nbsp;today!&nbsp;&nbsp;O well, its pretty cool i&nbsp;guess even though i don't kno anything about it! Yea, well im going to find something to keep me busy until this scary man gets here! lol ;)&nbsp;&nbsp; *0oGiNao0*</FONT></STRONG></P>"

! lol She was mad at us because we werent responding...at all!
haha&nbsp; Mr. Rines kicked ass, as usual.&nbsp; There was a sub and
she was nice.&nbsp; A big group of us sat in the back of the room and
played asshole and bullshit.&nbsp; Steve is hilarious!! You're an
ASSHOLE! lol&nbsp; Mrs. D's was fun too. I did my tomorrow speech which
i would have done real swell on if Sammi didn't make me laugh! lol Its
Otay!! Then me n Lin spent our free time talkin to Brandon N Derek
about random things like Kings parties (lol) and how im being
""recruited"" to lift with the football team!! haha Crazy people! Lunch
was a blast...Lin and Chrissy got run over by the garbage can.&nbsp;
Lin: ""OOOWWWW!!"" haha&nbsp; Mr. Bush's was cool. We watched Chris C's
movie at it was brilliant!! Then i went to softball which was ok but it
sucked because i couldn't do like anything. So depressing! But i did

"event","<STRONG><FONT color=#cc33cc>Soooo...today.&nbsp; King of Prussia. Fun but exhausting and very aggravating at times.&nbsp; My main goal was to find a nice prom dress...something different though.&nbsp; Not what everyone else might have.&nbsp; So the first few stores sucked butt so i shopped for clothes for Duane instead! lol Then, thank god, after like&nbsp;6 stores Macy*s had a reallllly super nice dress but of course Gina's luck just shone through and it did not fit!! That threw me over the edge lol.&nbsp; I wanted to cry.&nbsp; So we decided to leave Prussia.&nbsp; Went to some place called Linens N Things and i got a really awesome squishy pillow! Then off to Wendys, haven't been there in ages! Yummy!! Finally we ended up at Group USA, where i got my dress in 10th grade.&nbsp; I could not find one dress i liked!! It was horrible lol. Then my mom straightened me up and told me to pick one out already because by then my dad and duane were gettin irritated too!! haha I love it! So i went back in there and searched and i actually found the one i saw online that i thought was cool.&nbsp; I tried it and a few&nbsp;others on. It came down to the one i saw online or a baby pink strapless one.&nbsp; When i went out of the dressing room to&nbsp;get an opinion from&nbsp;my dad and duane i felt like i was in a fashion show, lol! Like all the girls in line would stare at whoever came out of their room with a dress on and judge if they liked it or not! haha&nbsp; So they said they liked the baby pink one.&nbsp; Then i came out with the other one because i totally couldn't decide and right away the panel of judges agreed they liked the one i had on better! lol Crazy! So i went with my instinct and got the one i saw online. Its different thats why i love it soo much! It looked crazy when it was out on the hanger&nbsp;but when i had it on i loved it!! yay! Heres what it looks like: <A href=""http://www.groupusa.com/c-product.cfm?icon_image=GroupusaPinkProm.jpg&amp;gid=10&amp;cid=1"">http://www.groupusa.com/c-product.cfm?icon_image=GroupusaPinkProm.jpg&amp;gid=10&amp;cid=1</A>&nbsp; Its the one on the left, the pink and orange one.&nbsp; Its different and i love it! lol&nbsp; So after that madness, we went home. Well not exactly. We drove around Philly for awhile and went to USIP's campus. Sadly, its really not that nice...I don't know about that place.&nbsp;After 12 hours, we were safely home and then me and Duane went out to get a cd at Best Buy ! haha&nbsp; Im sooo tired now....o well! Who needs sleep anyway?!?! I sure as hell do!!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ~*GiNa*~</FONT></STRONG>"

Math class was ok...sat around and talked but what else is new. Gym kicked ass!! Dodgeball should be a school sport! haha Steve manages to hit everyone that is on his team though! Chem II is always boring, just because no one understands her but we pretend like we are listening anyways. Physics...poor mr.rine. No one ever listens to him but he manages to get through his lessons quickly so everyone likes him for that.&nbsp;Mrs. D's was more Macbeth hoopla. Something wicked this way comes! haha Sammi, good times.&nbsp; Mr.Bush's...project stuff.&nbsp; My group is done, thank god, but i soooo do not wanna watch&nbsp;our video&nbsp;tomorrow!! Its really corny but&nbsp;kinda funny.

Me and Katie B. shot rubber bands at Don and got him mad. lol&nbsp; The cops were in front of Klien and i told don the person he pulled over was my mom and he believed me for 10 minutes!

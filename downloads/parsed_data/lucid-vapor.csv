"event","I think there are some people who need to learn when to get over their past. Especially when them not being able to is affecting others. In the particular case im thinking of i totaly can understand not wanting things to be over, i hope they never are in my case. But id like to think that i wouldn't become a stalker and be absolutley convinced that something the person wrote is about me, even after the clearest of the clearest statements that it was not about me. So, <i>MASTER OF THE OBVIOUS...</i>If you are reading this because you followed a link off of her website i hope your super-deductive powers will allow you to see through my vail of vaugness and see that...
<font size=""+4""><font color=""#ff0000"">THIS IS ABOUT YOU!!!</font></font>
There, glad we cleared that up. So if you do read it, then i just want you to know that id really like you to leave her alone, stop stalking her, stop harassing her. Move on in your life. And if you show up while im around you'll regret it. thats all i have to say, whether this gets read by who its supposed to or not is a different matter. I hope it does though
In any event, <font size=""+1"">i love you Mallory!</font>

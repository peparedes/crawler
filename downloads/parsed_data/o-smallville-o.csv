WOwie, I have honestly done a whole load of nothing since i last updated which was like freaking months ago.  And i feel i have to mention(because im a loser and i forgot to like 4 months ago) alex and i did eggrolls in my basement while watching the Cosby show!!! EGGROLLS!!! ok back to current times. which are seriously so snooze worthy. Oh but i joined a smallville community, which in case you sdidnt catch this, Im obsessed with that show.I love it. And if you don't watch it thats unfortunate cuz ur probly feeling a little bit empty. The part of you that ios missing, that is a combination of Tom Welling's hot face, and the awesome drama and suspense that comes from Smallville. SO...um watch it. Ok got that out of my system. SOoo.. I'm currently taking health in Gym, along with the entire freshmen class, i mean were not all together, but were all taking it.  It is weirddd.. and i know you all agree. i got to go. mahalo. LOVE AND PEACE baby! lol <3 me me me"

"event","It smy second entry of the day wow some kind of record.  Im not tired, or sad, or hungry.  Im not in a complainy mood which is new for me, cuz i like to complain, alot.  But i do have the hiccups, eew...wwwell, i really dont have much to say, im bored. I wish i lived in a hotel ya know i nice one, cuz theres this show on like nickelodeon or disney and its like these 2 brothers that live in a hotel, and i just think that would be so cool. I fell bad when i think mean things, like not in a snotty way, but when i meet someone i almost feel like i judge them in my head, like i can hear myself thinking mean things, not terribly mean but mean enough, and i would NEVER say them outloud but why do i have to think stuff like that.  Ya know ill meet somebody and in my head ill be like, ""ooh thats shirt is way too small for you."" and i wont say it, or even treat her differently but im thinking it and i feel guilty.  ANd i know we had that huge long involved convo. in mrs. holstroms class about judging people, and i think its wrong too, but i cant help it.  Ok im done with that spiritually good natured put down and my healthy portioning of unecessary guilt. wow big words.  I'm a weird person, i want a friend that i can tell anything to, but when im ready to tell that person, i change my mind and wanna keep everything in, not that im this huge vault of deep and mysterious secrets like my husbands buried under the pool. lol *DH*  but i just like to be able to totally vent everything, and this ideal person could make me feel like my **secrets** are really awesome. lol im joking there.  WOW i had a really weird dream and im gonna tell you.  
   Ok im in a gym room and its empty and theres dirt on the floor.  ANd then i see my old boyfriend, like my first boyfriend, from florida (who shall remain nameless) and hes like laying on the floor, no injuries but i screamed, and im like look what you did! i dont know who im talking to but i said it and then. someone i dont know walks throught the doors and is like, you made me do it.  I started crying and im all I loved him (eeew i totally dont and didnt)  and so the girls like yea well i did too, and he loved you so i had to get rid of him n then shes like its too bad .  And im like its not over yet, and i start like kung fu-ing her with my mad skills, lol.  ANd thats the end.  It makes no sense. whatever.  Im so tired im going to bed..
,               Nighty night Mwah, Luv yall"

"event","OOk...It's Super Bowl SUnday.  I'm here to question....Super BOWL??? why bowl? it just doesnt make any sense to me...And why is this such a big deal. Now i admit, i LOVE a good game, but the SUper Bowl just seems like another game to me.  I mean people have like huge parties, they throw down the big bucks for this one stupid game. No offense if ur into the whole Super BOWL thingy but, i'm not following ya.  I have bets on the Eagles though. I might as well have some illegal(its really not lol) fun with this game. I love Terrel Owens, he has an ankle injury and his doctors say he shouldnt be playing, but his determination overrides.  That's Hot. lol. I was invited to some SUper Bowl shindigs, but im not feeling so hot. I'm not going. I'm gonna watch the game (For the commercials and the all-too-famous half-time show)and paint my toenails. I have soo much Mythology homework its lethal. lol.  and Geometry of course. Ok for any of y'all in that class(Mrs. Kane), i totally forgot bout that project she gave us, ya kno the nursery rhymes, and comic strips thingy.  It's due March 4th but i cant believe i let it slip my mind.  God, its soo nice out today, it makes me realy miss spring, so pumped for all the smow to go away. All of my shopping magazines came today amnd are all like, ""hot spring fashions"" ""Spring into spring""(very cliche) yea.  Cant wait. uuh im gonna go.  love you all -Ka-ka-ka Kirstyn.-  lol im gonna find a cute way to sign off every week. Lol ima fag."

Ok, soooo This morning i had to wake up like wayy too early for a saturday and i had to sit in a smelly middle school gymnasium and watch 89 other little boys wrestle each other until i finally got to see my brother wrestle. See his meet was the 90th match out of all of the kids. ANd corey lost.  I waited 2 hours to watch my brother loose in less than a minute.  wow.  but he did good.  And then i came home and ate. and cleaned up and took a really long shower.  just watching little sweaty 7 year olds makes me feel dirty.  and then i watched the Terminal with corey.  It was really sad. but i liked it.  I didnt watch any smallville today, bummer.  But i did make a faithful attempt to satre at Tom Wellings picture for a record breaking amount of time which is so not hard to do.  Oh and i watched the VH1 special on Michael Jackson. interesting.  I'm like really tired. and tomorrow i have to go to another wrestling thing except this one lasts all day.  And i have to volunteer, which means work on SUnday, The day of rest? oh and its in Indian Hills, joy.  Maybe no one will recognize me if i wear my dads clothes. Im tired....and im going to bed.....goodnight."

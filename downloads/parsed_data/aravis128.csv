<br><br><u>Ability Scores:</u><br>
<b>Strength-</b>10<br>
<b>Dexterity-</b>12<br>
<b>Constitution-</b>11<br>
<b>Intelligence-</b>14<br>
<b>Wisdom-</b>15<br>
<b>Charisma-</b>14
<br><br><u>Alignment:</u><br><b>Neutral Good</b> A neutral good character does the best that a good person can do. He is devoted to helping others. He works with kings and magistrates but does not feel beholden to them. Neutral good is the best alignment you can be because it means doing what is good without bias for or against order. However, neutral good can be a dangerous alignment because it advances mediocrity by limiting the actions of the truly capable.<br>
<br><u>Race:</u><br><b>Humans</b> are the most adaptable of the common races. Short generations and a penchant for migration and conquest have made them physically diverse as well. Humans are often unorthodox in their dress, sporting unusual hairstyles, fanciful clothes, tattoos, and the like.
<br><br><u>Class:</u><br><b>Clerics</b> act as intermediaries between the earthly and the divine (or infernal) worlds. A good cleric helps those in need, while an evil cleric seeks to spread his patron's vision of evil across the world. All clerics can heal wounds and bring people back from the brink of death, and powerful clerics can even raise the dead. Likewise, all clerics have authority over undead creatures, and they can turn away or even destroy these creatures. Clerics are trained in the use of simple weapons, and can use all forms of armor and shields without penalty, since armor does not interfere with the casting of divine spells. In addition to his normal complement of spells, every cleric chooses to focus on two of his deity's domains. These domains grants the cleric special powers, and give him access to spells that he might otherwise never learn. A cleric's Wisdom score should be high, since this determines the maximum spell level that he can cast.

To you, there is always an element of play inherent in the genre, and you may very well enjoy fashion as much for the opportunity to dress up as for the style itself.  You probably wear goggles as an accessory, and rarely as actual eye-protection.

"event","This past week has been very busy and highly productive.

I have a reception site picked out.  I still have to get the contracts in order.  There are some lines that definately need fixing.  But at least I know where I would like to have it.

I have started playing phone tag with my parish deacon.  I think I will leave him a message telling him to call me on my cell anytime on Tuesday or Wednesday.  He seems really nice and has let me know that there should be no problem whatsoever with the date we are looking at.

I also have a wedding dress ordered.  It is a Mori Lee (style 2175).  My dad over-reacted to the cost until my mom talked with him.  But in retrospect, he also over-reacted to the cost of my prom dress (""A hundred and twenty dollar!  You had better get married in that dress!)

I have also been 'busting my hump' at work trying to get as much done and together before Monday.  Monday will be the last day at the office before vacation.  Which I am really really looking forward to.  I know that I will have a lot to get done when I get back.  But it is worth it. (Nino give me a call, you know what it's regarding).

Then Monday evening Goat and I will be driving to Lansdale (northern suburb of Philly).  We are going to spend a couple of days chillin with the family and some friends (whoever is available).   Then on Thursday night we are going to Gabe & Joanne's rehersal dinner.  Friday is their wedding at Pen Ryn Mansion.  

Saturday is still undedicated to any major plans (Nino, you really need to call me).

Sunday is a Father's Day brunch with Daddy Malloy.  Then the long drive home."

"event","Betsy and I just watched one of the greatest movies ever.

It was called ""Fido""

In the first 3 minutes they established that the zombie wars happened, and someone invented a collar that when you but on a zombie it removes their blood lust. Because of that zombies have become menial servants; moe the lawn, deliver the newspaper, etc.

The brilliance of this movie is that it uses this premise in a 1950's setting, the same setting as Lassie. There are literally scenes were Timmy (swear to god that's the kids name) is running thru a golden field with his zombie instead of a dog. In another scene the mother says ""Where's Timmy? Is Timmy okay?"" and the zombie leads the mom to where Timmy is in trouble.

It was the greatest zombie-parody movie I've ever scene. I highly recommend everyone sees it. Zombie movie fan or not, we've all seen ""Lassie"" or ""Leave it to Beaver"" and it really does mix the genres well. I tried to tape it while I watched it but it didn't work. I'm definitely buying this movie in the future.

Now I can no longer read my livejournal sporadically throughout the day as I used to.  In fact, I only get to read it at home, and the internet is slow here and the computer is so old that it is often too much trouble to spend more time on it than is absolutely necessary.

I am still checking, but updates will be far less frequent.  I am also hoping that this will help me get back into letter writing.  Especially with the change in weather.  

The filter system is also effecting my gmail.  Because gmail automatically lets you chat, and the filter is designed to block chatting as well, I can only chat and check my gmail at home.  I still have my hotmail account and can check that from anywhere.  But chatting just isn't an option right now.

</lj-cut>
<lj-cut text =""Part 1"">Friday night we packed our bags, straightened up, and got a good nights sleep.

Saturday morning, we took our two bags (one backpack with our clothes, one with games/books/DangerMouse) and hit the road.  With a healthy breakfast from McDonalds, I proved that forks, even when you are driving are only optional.  The drive was long and direct with only a few pit stops.  The time flew by thanks to The Golden Compass.  Nothing like a book on tape to pass the time.

We arrived in Souderton, PA around 4pm.  That is where Goat's brother Bob lives.  The household consists of Bob, Nikki, Nikki's Mom and Step-dad, and three dogs (and occasionally Steve, crashing in the spareroom).  Everyone was very nice and gave us some quiet time to get settled in.

Nikki volunteered to drive us to Goat's Dad's, where we would be meeting up with Jim before heading out for dinner.  We took the scenic route, but I didn't mind as I had the rare priveledge of being passenger in the car.  Once there Pat gave us a tour of the house.  She enjoyed pointing out all the exotic gifts that they have received from their foreign friends.

When Jim arrived we headed out to a local mexican restaurant.  The conversation was lively.  I realize now why Goat takes my hearty laugh so easily... Jim too, has boisterous laugh.  When dinner ended we returned to Goat's Dad's.  There Bob joined us for dessert and more conversation.

As the evening wore down Bob, Nikki, Goat & I, decided to head over to Ruby Tuesday's to pester Steve until he was free to leave the kitchen.  Nikki and I left first, then Bob, and eventually Steve and Goat.  This gave me time to hang out one-on-one with both Nikki and Bob.  Nikki gave me the 411 on some basics of the family history.  Bob and I just chatted in a casual manner.
Then it was off to bed as Bob, Steve and Goat indulged in Danger Mouse.
</lj-cut>
<lj-cut text =""Part 2"">Sunday morning was mostly spent curled up in bed.  Goat and I eventually got cleaned up and went to breakfast at a local family restaurant.  

When noon rolled around Jim, NIkki, Goat & I loaded up into Nikki's car and headed north to the Poconos.  Goat and I fell asleep in the backseat on the ride up.

Once we got there we met Uncles John, Cliff and Bob.  I got a tour of their little lakeside cabins.  There were air matresses in the bedrooms, as Mary and Rachel had spent the night.  The lake is shallow so it was easy to meet some of it's native fauna.  

There was more food than needed, but such is the nature of cookouts.  There was some lite grilling of Betsy.  But what is to be expected when meeting the parents?  The questions were easy and they stopped asking them once I started volunteering information.

The day was mostly filled with food and conversation.  At one point, Goat and I took a decaying canoe on the lake.  In less than five minutes we had taken on enough water to fill the bottom fifth of the canoe.  All the men folk came down to delight in the fruitless attempt made by Goat and myself.  Which actually made it all the more jolly.

At one point in the day, we ended up with the girls in the cabin chatting while the boys were outside playing Texas Hold'um.  But by the time dusk came round Nikki and I got a fire started and there were smores to be had.

Not long after, we piled back into Nikki's car for the long drive back to Souderton.  The original plan was to hang out with Goat's friends in the evening.  But we got back so late, and there is something about fresh air that just makes the night so great for falling asleep, that we had to cancel.

However, we did get to see Rick Monday morning.  Steve also joined us to make a foursome for breakfast.  Goat and I were the most awake of the four.  I know that I am a morning person.  But Goat, while not a morning person, has become quite good at quickly becoming cognizant in order to keep me company.  I always knew that Goat was a night owl.  Not until I saw how out of it Rick was in the morning, did I truly appreciate Goat's willingness to pull himself out of bed and spend time with me in the morning.

After that, it was the long drive home.  We got in around 7:30pm.  We stopped to pick up dinner on the way.  Goat, having listened to the description of Ioric Bearnesson eating a freshly killed seal, had an insatiable craving for sushi.  So sushi for Goat and chicken for Betsy.

And my goodness, how wonderful it is to be back home!

The plan is simple, after work, drive to Philly.  Arrive at about 3am (give or take an hour).  Sleep.  Spend Saturday and Sunday meeting Goat's family.  As well as seeing any other friends we have time to visit.  Monday, drive back to Columbus.  Sleep.  Tuesday crawl out of bed to work.

So Nino, give a call and I'll see what I can do."

"event","Goat and I celebrated 6 months together this past weekend.
Friday night we went to dinner with Mark and Audra at Bob Evans.  After that we drove up to Easton to see Stardust.  There was only one showing in only one theater.  It was an excellent movie. We didn't make it home till after 1 am.  So I was very slap-happy when I went to bed.  It made for a memorable evening.

Saturday, Goat made waffles.  He made so many that I was quite lethargic for the rest of the morning.  When the afternoon rolled around, I dropped Goat off at his D&D game and then drove around before ending up at Pochi's.  I had time to just chill before Mage.  It was nice to be able to play Mage again.  I haven't been there in nearly two months.  My, what one misses in a couple of months.

Sunday, we went to TeeJay's for breakfast.  After running a couple of errands, we went to the State Fair.  I have never been before.  It was great to ride all the rides, and walk around, and just spend time with Goat.  It was a lovely and tiring time.  We left after four hours of playing in the hot sun.  Goat made a quick and easy skillet meal for dinner and then I zonked out.  

It was a lovely weekend, and a great way to celebrate six months together."

<p>Although deeply emotional, you are extremely lacking in self-knowledge. You are somewhat needy, and when bored, may become very hedonistic. Your life is a quest for meaning, above all else. You are most like Dionysus. You are primarily interested in serving others, but your efforts are almost always unappreciated. You aren't confrontational, you're often out of tune with your own needs and unaware of the consequences of your own actions. <br><br>You are, at heart, a good person. You are very affectionate, and you are very loyal to your friends and family. You are very reluctant to burden others with your own problems, to the point that this in itself can become a problem for the people who care about you. This is a particular of a more general problem. Dionysus sends wave of ruin throughout his personal life. He is the photographer who seduces his subjects. He is the teacher who seduces a student. He is the art student who paints nonrepresentational splashes of color, he is the poet who rejects meter and content. You seek sexual partners more than anything else (this is to exploit the nurturing side of others to help fill your own void). If not sexual partners, this desire to become the object of sympathy with other people can manifest itself in other destructive ways. Stinkfist by Tool explains your condition pretty well. It's very likely that you haven't had many experienced mentors. You don't want them either, because you're the sort of person who rejects criticism and boundaries, but they're also your only hope for reaching any kind of emotional maturity. <br><br>Famous People Like You: John Lennon, Mick Jagger, Michael Jackson, Britney Spears, Marilyn Monroe, Hugh Hefner<br>I'd tell you to stay clear of Hermes, Icarus and Apollo, but you could probably learn something from them. You're least likely to hurt The Oracle, Atlas, Prometheus, and Daedalus, but Atlas and Daedalus won't like you very much.<br>Seek out: The Oracle, Prometheus </p></div><table cellpadding=""20""><tr><td><!--t-->Link: <a href=""http://www.okcupid.com/tests/6185258618751578079/Greek-Mythology-Personality"">The Greek Mythology Personality Test</a> written by <a href=""http://www.okcupid.com/profile?u=Aleph_Nine"">Aleph_Nine</a> on <a href=""http://www.okcupid.com"">OkCupid Free Online Dating</a>, home of the <a href=""http://www.okcupid.com/online.dating.persona.test"">The Dating Persona Test<!--/t--></a></td></tr></table></lj-cut>"

Since then we have had our first overnight visitor to the new apartment.  That honor went to Guin.  She crashed on our futon for a low-key night with me and Goat before the hub-bub of Rachel's wedding.

That weekend, I took Goat to his two games (Werewolf LARP and D&D tabletop).  I did a little bit of socializing and a little bit of making trouble.  But all for a worthy cause.

This past weekend we worked on Goat's car.  The goal is to make it drivable so that someone can use it, even if Goat can't.

Tonight Goat is going to pick up his new suit.  I am very excited!  And I am certain that we will be heading out to the theater to see Transformers at the first showing that Goat can pull me to.  He is so excited (I hope it isn't disappointing)!

Otherwise work is work.  Goat is good (with a little bit of irritating and a whole lot of wonderful thrown in).

As for me, my life is holding steady.  There is no major news regarding work -which is the best news of all.  This weekend, I got a sore throat.  And as my job depends on me being able to talk I decided I would try to take it easy.

Saturday consisted of a drive, where Goat and I picked up some money and went shoe shopping.  I got a nice pair of summer sandals to were to the pool.  Goat got some new work shoes and a nice pair of black boots.  After that Goat pampered me and I turned in early.

Sunday, Will invited us to see a play with him.  So Goat, despite the pricy tickets (however, the student discount nearly cut the cost of my ticket in half), took me to the theater for a Sunday Matinee.  We saw RSC's Complete History of America (abridged).  If you are in the Columbus area, I highly recommend it.  For information go to http://www.catco.org/completeamerica.htm"

"event","This week has been very up and down.  I still don't have a dresser, so the bedroom is a mess.  There are clothes and boxes everywhere.  Though we did manage to put up a curtain that blocks out the sunlight.  So that if Goat feels like sleeping in - theorically he could.  However, I don't have that option (Yay, for the ol' 8-5!).

Right now, there is only live tv (air) in the bedroom.  If we want to watch tv on the bigger screen our only options are VHS/DVD/Playstation.  I think I will try to get a cheap set of ""bunny-ears"" so that that is no longer a problem.

We have lovely red curtains for the living room with matching pillows and blanket for the futon.  I bought an extra curtain so that I can have matching material for recovering the dining room chairs.  Any left over material will go making cords for holding the curtains open or pillows for the couch.

What I have really noticed is what I DO NOT HAVE.  How quickly you realize that salt and pepper don't come standard in a pantry shelf.  And that if I want to have leftovers, that I need to have tupperware/plastic wrap/aluminum foil actually in the kitchen.  A set of four is not enough silverware unless you plan on washing dishes everyday.

Otherwise, life is pretty normal.  The only thing that has really changed is that when I get home, I have someone who is happy to see me.  Even when the day has been long and crappy for the both of us.  I come home and there is a hug and/or a kiss waiting for me.  That alone had made moving worthwhile."

I went to Columbus this past weekend.  Went down Thursday evening - which passed quietly in the company of my boyfriend.

I went to a morning mass a few Saturdays ago and I think my pastor actually recognized me this evening because of it.  Forget that I was in the First Communion class his first year at our parish.  

I am not a normal fixture at my parish.  I am much better about attending services in the summer than I am in the winter.  And with the exceptions of Christmas, Ash Wednesday, and Easter I cannot claim any regular attendance.  However, I think I should try to fix that.  

I love going to church!  I love how great I feel by the time the service has ended.  I will often wait till the church is nearly empty before heading out of my pew (kinda like how I wait till all the credits are thru when at the theater).

Today I stuck around and lit a few candles for special intentions.  The first candle was for my coming job interviews.  One for Amanda as promised.  One for the people struggling to get thru the depression of February.  One for my cousin Meredith.  And the last one was for my boyfriend.

For Lent, I have decided to return to saying my evening prayers.  There are well over fifty people on my ""God Bless"" list.  So I figure it will take me about fifteen minutes to get thru my prayers in the evening.  But prayer is good.  It is good for me to think about people other than myself.  And let's face it, we all could use another person praying for us.  Afterall...

Well, thanks to the advice offered by my friends nearly six months ago I have recently decided to risk a broken heart.  AKA, as of Sunday, February 11th, I have a boyfriend.  He is a wonderful man who makes me feel like I am the best version of me that I could possibly be.  It isn't necessarily true, but I feel comfortable in my own skin when he is with me.
I know that this is the disgustingly cute, puppy love stage.  The stage where you are so into each other that the world around you seems to melt into the background.  It is the giddy early stage, that is nausating to watch but ends all too soon.
That is where I have been since this past Thursday.  I was hoping to make my post all gushing to reflect the shmoopy sentiments I have lately been embracing.  In fact, many of my friends have now had a chance to at least make his acquaintance so I was hoping people would respond with their critiques, commments, and questions.

But getting home today after the wonderful lightness of the weekend was just heartbreaking.

I went straight to my Granpa's to get his mail so that I could send it off straight away.  Only to discover that the house had been broken into over the weekend.  So I called the police and they came straight away to get fingerprints (hopefully) and record any damages and take a statement.  There was very little damage to the house.  Nothing of value was taken.  It turns out to be really more of an inconvience.  However, it is really very disturbing.  Many of you know how attached I am to that house.  It is like a sanctuary outside of my house.  The place I go when my family is just too much for me.  And that sanctuary was just ransacked.  I'll get over it shortly, but it is enough to make you cry.

Even worse than that, I hurt my friends feelings.  I think she feels like I did it on purpose.  And that is making me feel miserable.  I didn't mean to hurt her, it's just that this weekend was about something else entirely.  I didn't announce to anyone what my agenda was.  And now ... uuugh.

Just last month I finally managed to beat the depression that I had been feeling since last June.  The failure that I've been feeling from flunking out of school was being offset by the two job interviews that I have lined up for this week.  And today, just when I started feeling like my life was finally showing like it had some sort of path or purpose, two things happen to make me feel like shit.
And now,
I just... 
I give up!

Saturday:  I managed to wake up early enough to get cleaned up and go to 8:30am mass.  I discovered that my dad and I had the same idea.  After mass I lit candles in the the church for some special intentions.  It looks like I will have to go back and light a few more.  But that just means another fun morning at mass.

After I drove down to visit with Amanda for brunch.  We had a lovely time at the downtown Bruegles.  I discovered, that despite my hearty appetite, my quest to devour the pancakes they served was woefully abandoned.  I was defeated!  However I was brightened with the promise of stealing Amanda to Columbus for a weekend sometime in the nearish future for girly fun with Sarah.

When lunch ended I headed further south to meet up with Joe and Sarah.  We hung out and had dinner before going to MageGame.  Where, with Sarah's help, I had a marvolous time being introduced as a player and a cleverly manipulated awakening.  Game lasted for a ridiculously long time and I was out cold on Sarah & Joe's guestbed by 2am.

Sunday:  After a brief tet-a-tet with Sarah, I headed over to hang out with Michael for a couple of hours.  It is astounding how all the places we wanted to eat at were all closed on Sunday.  We finally ended up at the Market where we ate, people watched, and chattered like magpies(at least I did).  

After returning to campus,I headed over to chill awhile with Goat.  We just hung out and talked for a couple of hours before we sat down and watched Little Miss Sunshine.  After the movie, Goat was good enough to show me around the apartment.  By the time I realized how late it had gotten, it was too late to drive home.  So I spent the evening watching Coupling with the household and spent the evening covered in blankets to ward off the offending cold that insisted on creeping into the house.

Monday:  Home again, home again. Jiggity Jig!  I made a few calls.  But I am so tired that as a oppossed to doing anything very productive I have opted on dinner, showering and then to my soft warm bed."

I love going down to visit with them.  Between <lj user='anivair'>'s cooking & <lj user='gothpanda'>'s sharing nature, I always seem to have an amazing time.

<lj-cut text= 'Why I like being ""fresh meat""'>I have had very few opportunties in my life to be ""fresh meat"".  Most of the guys that I met in highschool knew my brother and/or my sister.

And while I am sure that that was good for me to learn not need a man's approval in order to be happy.  So it was a nice change to have so much attention showered on me.  And as the Panda succinctly stated, I am a middle child and we often feel the need for more attention.</lj-cut>

On Saturday, I attended the Mage game with them.  It was so awesome to have so many people there!  I didn't play which was very good for me as it left me with the freedom to observe others playing and even jump in to play a ""busty blond"" NPC.  And since I have never played Mage, that was really the best way that they could have introduced me to it.  I was so inspired by my observations that I created a character sheet so that I could play the next time I am in town.  In fact, thanks to <lj user='gothpanda'>'s assistance, I think I have the makings of a very fun player character.  

This was such a great weekend!

Until this past Wednesday or Thursday I have been almost completely lost to the world.  

In the week following the New Year I completely lost my voice.  In order to get my voice back I have been drinking lots of hot liquids - hot tea, hot coffee, hot lemonade, and just plain old hot water.  I have sucked on cough drops until my tongue was seemed to be permanently dyed with red, yellow, and blue.  To restrain myself from talking I secluded myself at Granpa's for nearly a solid week.  So there has been very little communication between me and the world.

Upon returning to the world I have seen two movies, The Painted Veil and Pan's Labyrinth.  I went to a birthday party at Dave & Busters.  I have spent at least 12 hours talking on the phone.  I was invited to join a Star Wars D&D campaign - I have declined at present.  And I have been making small strides towards employment.  

I have also been toying with the idea of doing something for my birthday this year.  A few years ago, I swore to myself that I wouldn't bother about my birthday until someone throws me a surprise party or until I turn 30 (whichever comes first).  But this year my birthday is the Friday after Easter, Friday the 13th, and I can't help but think that this might be a good year for a birthday party.  Just a thought."

Where was I?  
Up at 8am after roughly an hour of sleep.  I joined my mom, Uncles Rick, Tom and Tim, Aunt Donna and cousin Sammy for breakfast.  After I ate my fill and drank several cups of coffee, I returned to my room with Sammy.  I packed up my things and with Sam's help, I managed to take everything to the car in just one trip.

Sammy joined me as I drove to Granpa's house.  There everyone else would eventually be meeting up for a Rothman family Christmas.  I had much fun in my conversation with Uncle Tom.  I explained to him that he tipped the scales and I have the vote for best family.  If you like I can list the things that make my family so unique and wonderful.  But Uncle Tom wins for his statement he made to Guin several years ago at Thanksgiving.  Afterall, two queens, do a marriage make.

There I struggled to stay awake until all the family arrived.  Which is very difficult when you are drinking a soothing tea for your throat and are trying not to talk for fear your voice will go out yet again.  But I stayed awake and cognitive enough to join in the family white elephant gift exchange.  With the majority of the family together for the first time in years, it took a while.  I think there were 24 of us present.  So 24 people in one room, even at Granpa's house, gets tight.  I ended up with a Calligraphy set.  I also got my presents from my Godfather.  Another ornament for my collection.  (He has given me an animal ornament nearly every Christmas since I was 13.  Someday I hope to have a full menegery on my tree.)
  
After the gift exchange my cousin Tavis headed back to New York, with my cell phone number in his phone.  Once I get my voice back I will give him a call.  I worry about him.  But not long after he left, I conceded to my tired body and headed home.  I got home a little after 4pm.  I took some NyQuil.  Unwound for a few hours.  And was out cold by 7pm.</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text =""New Year's Eve"">
I woke up around 11am.  For those of you doing the math, that is about 16 hours of sleep.  I dreamt like crazy.  I wish I had recorded it, because they were really great dreams.  However, with all the dreaming, I woke up not really as refreshed as a 16 hour sleep with cold medicine will make you feel.
I got a call from Nia going over the plans for the day/evening.  Despite not using my voice for over half a day, it was still sounding like an eighty year old smoker.  I took a shower and then fell asleep for several hours.  Upon waking I slowly started getting ready to head over to Nia's apartment.
There I had the good fortune to spend time with Amanda, Danny, Jeremy, Meg, Meredith, Erin, and Nia.  There was more food than we could eat.  All of it Oh So Tasty!  There was plenty of conversation.  Lots of laughing.  And champane for ringing in the New Year.  And though Nino and Jess could not be there I did get to talk with them briefly.
Being very tired, I opted to drive home and spend the night in my comfy bed.  So after my goodbyes and a very easy drive home, I finally went to bed around 2:30am.</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text =""the rest of my week"">
Monday - slept off and on all day.  I don't even think I got out of my PJs.

Tuesday - after a two hour delay, Ted and Emily finally headed over to my house.  I took them to my usual fooding place.  I hadn't eaten more than a few bites in nearly 24 hours.  So I did my meal justice.  

While we were out Emily gave me a lovely Christmas present of two Chinese characters and authentic ink pad.  I can't wait to use them!  I took Ted and Emily to Half Price Books where we browsed until it was time for Ted and Emily to drive across town to their next appointment.  I wish I could have had more time to spend with them (as well as a speaking voice so that I could have had a good chat with them).  As it was, it was wonderful to see them and I am looking forward to a copy of the pictures of us.

Wednesday - Slept.  Tried to spend some time with my brother before he headed back West.  Kathy and Matt took off for their honeymoon.  Took it easy.  Completely lost my voice.  Can only talk in whispers.

Thursday - Worked.  Which totally sucked without a voice.  Mom and I went out to dinner together.  Found out that Great Aunt Helen passed away.  Apparently I, and not my mom, is the last to know.

Friday -  Worked. Slept.</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text =""A funeral"">
Saturday morning I got up and showered and dressed.  I actually now own enough back separates that I can in fact wear all black to a funeral.  I wore my crystal pendent, etched with the letter B.  It belonged to my Granma and I felt it would be nice to have a piece of her with me at the funeral.

It was Great Aunt Helen who died.  She is my dad's Aunt.  She was married to his favorite Uncle.  She had been a widow for nearly 30 years.  She has been in relative good health.  All of her family was in for Christmas this year (including her great grandchildren).  And not long after Christmas she suddenly took sick and just quickly passed.

It was mostly just family at the funeral.  But we managed to fill about 1/3 of the church.  For a 95 year old woman, it was an awefully big funeral.  I couldn't really talk to anyone as I can only still just whisper.  But things went smoothly.  Her grandson, Joe gave a wonderful eulogy.  Not an easy thing to do.  Having given one for my own grandma, I know.

Funny thing about funerals, after attending one, you never attend JUST ONE again. Every funeral takes me back to other funerals.  Some more promenent than others.  I always seem to go back to Jeff's and Grandma Barb's.  But sometimes it's one of the many others.  I have attended nearly three times as many funerals/wakes than I have weddings.  I'm not sure if that is normal.  But I suppose I'm not really a normal girl.

I was looking forward to a visit with some friends after the funeral, but that just didn't pan out.  Which explains why I have managed to fill you all in on the last two weeks in such a short period of time.</lj-cut>"

I found out very late on Wednesday night (1:30am) that I had a morning appointment at the salon to get my nails done with the rest of the bridal party.  This normally wouldn't be too big a deal (though I don't like it, I can get by on 6-7 hours of sleep).  However, I had just started to develope cold symptoms and I wanted to get a lot of rest before the wedding so that I wouldn't look like I was sick.

But Thursday morning I was up bright and early and ready to head of with my mom, sister, Kristen G. and Genie R.  I got a french manicure for the first time.  And it was delightful to have a manicure again.

After the salon we went to Clemintine's for a little Tea Party.  The service was disappointing, the tea was less than stellar, but the food was excellent.  By then my voice was starting to go in and out and I had a faucet for a nose.  But it apparently wasn't obvious.  

After that was the wedding rehearsal and dinner.  I was slightly disappointed that they didn't go into a little more detail at the rehearsal.  However, I was not to terribly surprised.  (Our pastor recently had a 5-by pass surgery.  He is still recovering and is not aloud to work yet.  So we had a pastor from a differ parish coming in for the ceremony.  So because he wasn't free to be at the rehearsal, and he wasn't from the parish all we had was the general outline of the mass to fall back on.  Thank goodness for the structure of Catholic masses!)

The dinner was delicious.  I spent the majority of the dinner entertaining the flower girl, Annie.  But I did get to talk with some of the family.  I am sorry that I didn't really get the chance to chat with Matt's family.  But it was just as well as I was suffering from a sore throat.  At the dinner Kathy and Matt handed out presents.  Some lovely gifts for our parents.  The kids all got presents.  The groomsmen got cocktail mixers.  The bridesmaids got our necklaces and earings, and navy slippers - to make up for the fact that we were wearing 3"" heels.

My aunt Fran drove me home early.  Which ment I could finally give her her Christmas present.  It was a set of clear quartz crystals that represent the basic shapes in ""sacred geometry"".  She absolutely loved it!  Many thanks to Emily for taking me to that new age shop in Prescott, AZ (where I purchased it).

I also got a lovely present in the mail from my dear friend Panda.  She knew that I would be wearing heals the next day and sent me a foot repair kit.  It was the best!

Also, my cousin Laura (on my dad's side) gave birth to a healthy baby boy, Christian.</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text = ""Dec 29 a.k.a. the day that lasted a week"">
Thursday night, I went to bed early.  But all of the bridal party spent the night at our house for an old fashioned sleep over.  From what I understand, the watched the first 20 minutes of Elf and where out cold.  Friday morning, I got first dibs on the shower (7:30 am).  The hot water finally gave out on Kristen.  But we got thru me, Mom, Genie, Kathy, and Denise with hot water.  However the drain has been very slow ever since.

Once we were all up and dressed, we went to the salon to get our hair and make up done.  There is no point in going into detail.  I will try to get pictures up and/or out as soon as I get any copies.  At the salon we got a private room where we could gather and eat, drink, etc.  Kathy and her friends immediately set about correcting their hair and makeup (just minor touches, that even if they were celebrity stylist, they would have corrected anyway).

After that we went home.  I packed my overnight bag with the essentials.  It had to be ready for my brother, Joey to take to the hotel.  He took my car and bags to the hotel because he had to head that way anyway as the groomsmen were getting ready at the hotel.  
At home we ladies got dressed. And it wasn't long before the photographer arrived to start taking pictures.  With the house still full from the sleepover and Christmas it was a tight fit, but it doesn't show in the pictures.

We left the house for the church in a limobus.  And while there were only 6 of us in there, with our dresses, we definately took up all the space they had to offer.
The Church was decorated for Christmas still and there were pointsettias everywhere.  The service ran relatively smoothly.  My sister jumped the gun on the candle lighting.  Amy didn't have the mic on until half way thru the first reading.  Aunt Fran did an excellent job on the second reading.  Matt didn't respond at the ""with this ring"" until the priest had to repeat himself.  I was a Eucharistic minister (which totally sucked in 3"" heels).  Stephen did a great job with the closing petitions.  Mass ended and the party processed out.  Kathy and Matt went thru the church row by row to thank everyone for coming and to talk with the people who wouldn't be at the reception.  While that was going on I got to see some of my family and have some bubbly (the first of the day) in the limobus.

We took the scenic route to the hotel to enjoy and savor the moment.  But once we got there it was time to take some wedding photos.  I haven't been in a wedding party since I was 4.  So the process was all very new to me.  It was lovely to be announced so that everyone knew who the heck was in the wedding party and why.  It was lovely to be the first one served.  I didn't have to make any speeches.  I knew 2/3rds of the guests so I had no end of people to talk with despite my sore throat.

I danced alot.  I made everyone of my male cousins dance with me.  And that may have been the only time they danced.  Most of them admitted that no one else could get away with forcing them to join in the dancing.  I made Tavis dance the polka.  Brian W. (approx 12yrs) was gracious enough to dance with me twice - even though I am not family.  His mother, RuthAnn thanked me for it.  (RuthAnn is possibly my favorite of mom's friends.)  I made Brendan dance one dance with me.  Which was more than fair as I offered to let him spend the night in my room so that he wouldn't have to worry about getting drunk.

My mom's friend, Kate pulled me aside so that I could meet her family.  She told them I was her favorite.  Which I never get tired of hearing!  

I got to meet some of Kathy's friends from the College of Wooster.  I already knew Liz.  But I was quite embarressed to find that her friends remembered me, while I did not remember them.  However, this is not surprising to me.  I try to keep Kathy's friends and my friends is two separate categories.  Something that is usually not difficult.  It stems back many many years to a conversation I had with her that she claims not to remember.  But I am sure that though she would like me to get along with her friends.  She would not like to share them.
I had some great conversation with the Wooster kids.  Nate brought his lasso with him.  He let me try.  Apparently I'm a natural.  He taught me how to tie the lasso knot.  But promptly forgot the next day.  But I think I may look it up so that I can practice.  It is nice to be naturally good at something.

I talked till I was hoarse.  I talked till I sounded like a eighty year old smoker.  I talked till I had no voice left.

After the reception ended I went to my room to change into some comfy clothes.  Then I hit the hotel bar with Brendan and Genie.  One of Matt's very drunk highschool friends was a little too forward there.  But I put a stop to that quickly.  When the bar closed we went to the room my dad got solely for the after party.  I had many drunk family members in that room.  I didn't really do a lot of drinking.  I think I had a total of five drinks all that day.  Which is double the amount I have had in any other given day.  But I wasn't even buzzed.  Just a little tired.  

I talked for a while longer with my cousins, and the Woo kids.  My cousin Jeff was unusually talkative to me.  When we were little we were real pals.  At one point he even said that I was the only girl he would ever want to marry.  But he broke up with a long time girlfriend and I think that he misses having a girl to share his thoughts with.  Which is something I understand very well since my friend Mark and I haven't spoken in ages.  I sometimes miss having the masculine perspective to bounce ideas off of.  

Then I retired to my room.  Where I didn't get much sleep before I got a call at 8 am from my mom asking me if I would like to join some of my family for breakfast.  Which I did.  

But as that was Saturday, I will have to post that later.  I am sure I left some details out.  And I will happily answer any questions.  But that's it for now.

Stayed home sick from my reception job at Action.  Between killer cramps and exhaustion, I felt sleep was the best course of action.  Clearly, I should have gotten in my car and just run away while everyone was out.  
Dad went out drinking all afternoon.  Mom and Joey decided to run up to Taco Bell instead of going out to eat with Dad.  He has this very irritating habit of insisting that he is sober enough to drive even when he is buzzed (and he won't let anyone else drive his car).
I also got a ltter from school saying that I am not reaccepted in the dental hygiene program.  I got a very well intentioned letter trying to cheer me up, but just reminded me that I am in fact just a loser with a bad case of depression.
So Dad, in his drunken state tries to have a serious talk with me about my future, in which the word failure was repeated many many times.  Not to mention that his talks with me are really more didacturns where he can just tell me what he is thinking.
So, with so many thoughts and feelings swimming in my head, I ran to my room and grabbed my scissors and found some release.  Six slashes on my forearm.  
When mom and joey returned, I was forced to sit thru dinner of taco bell and lots of people talking at me.  Needless to say, I went to bed as soon as my mom and brother stopped watching me.</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text =""Dec 23"">
The next day I went to Granpa's and put up the Christmas tree.  Mom cooked an actual family dinner.  But the day was rather quiet.</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text =""Dec 24"">
On Sunday, I helped my mom with the Christmas Eve Dinner.  She was a little trepidatious about my using any sharp objects for peeling the potatoes.  But she covered quickly and hide it fairly well.  It was Mom, Dad, Joey, Kathy, Matt and myself for dinner.  We had more than enough food but not enough that anyone really gorged themselves.  After dinner was a rousing round of dominoes.  Followed by opening our presents.  It was a very Narnian Chrismas for me.  It helped that I had my Amazon Wish List.  Everything I got was from it.  After pressies, we went to Mass.  By the time we got back, it was nearing midnight.  There was a little chitty chat but Kathy and Matt had to leave for Edinborough for Christmas with his side of the family.</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text =""Dec 25"">
Christmas was very laid back.  My Uncle Dan got into town in the afternoon.  He came over for some food and games.  But only stayed a couple of hours as he had a long drive to Buffalo ahead of him.  After Dan left, I joined mom for the Phillips annual Christmas openhouse.  Dad, as usual, decided to stay home.  Joey wasn't interested.  But I hate for mom to have to go alone.  So I went and was assulted by the kids.  Afterall, I can carry two kids at once.  We stayed out late enough that I knew I would be tired at work the next day.  But I love the Halloran clan, so it was worth it.

I worked on the 26th and 27th.  And the rest I will have to post at another time.  Which is logical as it will all have to do with the wedding.  
However, I get the distinct feeling that I am boring my friends with my posts.  So I may obstain from posting for a while. So until then, Salud.

"event","I received an email today saying that a friend wished I would update.  So here we go.

Firstly, my friend, you should know that I try not to update when I am unhappy as it effects my post.  No need to bring my friends down.  
As for any details, I am working.  I am over worked, underpaid, and feel relatively unappreciated at my job.  
Granpa's basement is still unfinished.
I have a very uncertain future at this point.  
I am still wrestling with tiny to moderate depression.  
My sister's upcoming nuptuals make me feel a dozen different emotions, sometimes all at once.  
I am trying to focus on the positive, or at least on the things that need my attention most at present.  
And I can't help wondering that if I DID commit myself to the county hosptial, would they charge me?

Otherwise, I have had the delight of seeing Nia twice in one week.  And maybe, though I doubt it, I will have another friend who wants to spend time with me this weekend.

Right now I have had a long day.  I am tired.  And my only release is in tears.  So I think I will retire."

"event","<lj-cut text = ""a scattering of thoughts"">
Lately my mind has been all over the place.  My thoughts are scattered and erratic and fragmented.  They jump.  And I wonder what is really on my mind... that it needs such heavy protection from my coherent thought process.

My dreams are no help.  I have been dreaming very heavily for nearly two months now.  And while I enjoy dreaming, I am a lucid dreamer.  So my dreams only reveal so much.  My dreams do indicate that I either don't know who my friends are or that I have false friends.  There are also a lot of indicators of fears and obstacles.

I wonder which of my friends will come to my funeral.  Will I surprise my family by having lots of friends attend or will my funeral reflect my daily life?  Will my funeral, left in the hands of my family, reflect me?
What music will they play?  Will they think to use my playlists?  Who amongst all the people I know will know what music I would choose?  Does anyone know why one of the playlist titles is Rococco Red?  
Will anyone know my passwords?  Will my accounts remain open without anyone knowing my passwords?
Will anyone want something of mine to remember me by?  Will anyone guess which things mean the most to me?  

How do I share these thoughts with people?  Does anyone even care?  Does it matter it they don't?  My mind is chaos.  My thoughts drift to the warm feel of blood flowing over the skin.  How thin the surface of the skin.  How easily it rips and tears under the pressure of my nails.  The itching and tingling of my skin...
The overwhelming desire to take a vacation from the pain of living.  To sleep without the responsibility of waking.  Not death, just sleep.

I have been attempting to hold back on my posting as they tend to be either depressing or somehow miserable in their nature.  And let's be honest, life is already depressing enough without all you good people having to read more of my doom and gloom.

Since my last posting I have managed to have several phone conversations with both Nino and Neve.  I have played phone tag with Michael.  And even got a return call from Kiery.  I have also had the good fortune to spend a glorious weekend with Sarahpanda.  A pleasure I hope to repeat in the near future.

I have also been having a heck of a dream life.  I have remembered my dreams more often than not in the past two weeks.  Some of the most memorable include having all my teeth fall out, being in a labyrinth at the zoo, being involved in a major traffic accident, being bitten by a poisonous spider, and writing for a high profile women's magazine.  I'm sure that they dreams mean something... but I am too lazy to record the dreams and analyze them.

This past weekend my granpa's basement flooded thanks to a broken sump pump.  I have been spending a lot of time over there trying to get it cleaned up.  Looks like it will be quite involved.  I will need to have a contractor come over to check out the damage.  But it's not like I have a life here in cleveland anyway.

Tuesday, I returned to Action Door.  I will be there as close to full time as posible until they can hire a new receptionist.  The guys there all remember me and are glad to have me back.  I don't blame them.  I spent from 11am till 5pm yesterday filing invoices.  Hopefully, I will be able to help them catch up or at least stay afloat now that the busy season has started.

Luckily, I can pretty much take off whenever I need it.  So I am asking all of you now... are there any days that I need to take off of work to spend with you?
I would like to tell my boss which days to expect me by Monday.  So please get back to me soon.  So far the only claims on the future are 11/4, 11/19, & of course, the weekend of the wedding.

As I generally refrain from posting, if you would like an update or have any questions please respond to this post or email me directly.</lj-cut>"

So Friday was the last day to complete my incomplete.  And as the numbers stand... I did not.  That means that I failed my POHS II course.  And that in turn means, I am no longer a student in the dental hygiene program.  I have to go to school and withdraw from all of the courses that I am currently taking.  If I decide that I want to go back I have to re-apply.  My instructors suggest that I reflect on whether or not I really want to continue in dental hygiene.

The thing is, I am actually pretty good.  I'm no savant, but when I am working on my clients, I AM quite good.  In fact, I have had clients ask to see me again and even hug me at the end of appointments.  However, the clinical stuff was never the problem.  It is always the paperwork.  I keep making stupid mistakes and I don't know why.  It's like my brain disconnects after the client leaves.  

Right now I just feel like a complete failure.  I never seem to accomplish anything.  What the hell is wrong with me?"

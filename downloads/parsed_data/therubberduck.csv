"event","aright that football game was awesome!! lost my voice, had a freak accsadent.. we lost 42-7 Im gonna make this into a storie


Last night
my team lost
it was a horrible fight
and the pizza was a great cost

I cheered for my team
but all they did was fall
i also got hit by a laser pointer beam!
and the team lost the ball

As i screamed
lost my voice
i yelled for pizza
not a very good choise

two freaking peices costed 4 bucks
but i still ate it and thought
its better buying some chucks
that i bought

as the night went on
my voice died
it was tottally gone
i think i almost cried


slow motion trip
i went to the cement
that hot chochlet fly at my eyes
my sight was spent

ahhhh what a night it was...

have you ever felt so much for someone you both dream and daydream about them.

have you ever felt so much that you could never hurt them in any way>?

You know that ideal love that each of us dreams of from childhood? That's you!
Not because you posess all of the ideal characteristics, but because you are a savvy shape shifter.
You have the uncanny ability to detect someone's particular fantasy... and make it you.

You inspire each person to be an idealist and passionate, and you make each moment memorable
Even a simple coffee date with you can be the most romantic moment of someone's life
By giving your date exactly what he or she desires, you quickly become the ideal lover.

Your abilities to make dreams come true is so strong, that you are often the love of many people's lives.
Your ex's (and even people you have simply met or been friends with) long to be yours.
No doubt you are the one others have dreamed of... your biggest challenge is finding *your* dream lover.</font></td></tr></table><div align=""center""><a href=""http://www.blogthings.com/whatkindofseducerareyouquiz/"">What Kind of Seducer Are You?</a></div>"

"event","50 things girls wish guys knew  ...

1)You have to tell a girl how you feel about her...we make no assumptions.
2)It never hurts to work out...take your own advice.
3)Girls like sex just as much, if not more than guys.
4)Not all girls masturbate...we just don't and no we are not lying.
5)We hate porn.
6)Hmmmm...guys in Jeeps...yummmm...
7)Girls need food, water, and compliments to survive.
8)We think about you all the time.
9)Being able to make us laugh is so much more important than how much you can bench-press.
10)We may think you are gay if you wear tighty-whities on a regular basis.
11)Hold our hand.
12)No backseat drivers...NONE.
13)Girls generally don't like giving head, so you better be ready to reciprocate if and when you get it.
14)We are not your all-night restaurant.
15)Anything we say or do during that 4 days to a week each month cannot be held against us.
16)If you hold our hand while you are driving we will be thoroughly impressed...especially if it's a stick.
17)Under no circumstances will we have a threesome.
18)You look hot in hooded articles of clothing.
19)If you think for any reason that we don't like you then we probably don't.
20)Having us over while you and your friends play video games does not count as ""quality time"".
21)Just because we groom ourselves on a regular basis does not mean we're high maintanance.
22)Never comment on how much a girl eats...ever.
23)Keep in mind that we withold sex when we're mad at you, so you might wanna get around to apologizing...
24)You just can't force us to like sports...especially those associated with the WWF.
25)We're typically smarter than you...so get over it and stop whining when we get better grades than you.
26)If you do not own a wife-beater, stop reading this list, and go invest in one...right now.
27)The ability to play the guitar will help you get laid.
28)We're sorry, Brad Pitt just IS hot...get over it!!!
29)Walks in the rain, kisses on the forehead, and cooking dinner for us will get you everywhere.
30)Just because we're in a serious relationship doesn't mean we plan to marry you someday, so stop being so damn scared!!!
31)If you're developing such good finger skills playing video games, you better put them to good use sometimes.
32)Anything you do or say to another girl that you wouldn't want us to know about is considered cheating.
33)If we can admit that we're wrong, you'd better be able to do the same.
34)The excuse ""I can't dance"" is unacceptable...we'll appreciate the simple fact that you're trying.
35)On that note, if you refuse to dance, expect us to dance with other guys...and lots of them.
36)Think before you speak...it'll make a world of difference.
37)Not all girls kiss on the first date, get over it...we're creatures of mystery.
38)Make fun of our clothes...prepare to die.
39)We don't always expect you to pay for us, but it doesn't hurt to at least offer everyone once in a while.
40)Tell us we're beautiful.
41)The ""little things"" in a relationship are really the biggest.
42)Foreplay isn't something we should have to ask for...it's a prerequisite.
43)Don't screw us over...especially if we have an older brother or protective guy friends...they will hunt you down and kill you.
44)If you're gonna look at other girls, at least make sure we don't see you do it.
45)Just because we're still just ""hanging out"" doesn't make it ok to sleep with your ex-girlfriend, friend with benefits, etc.
46)No girl just wants to be your ""friend with benefits"".
47)We're sensitive too...be gentle (and we're not talking about our hearts here guys).
48)One word when it comes to smoking...quit.
49)We reserve the right to hate all of your ex-girlfriends.
50)If we happen to trip, fall, etc, while wearing the exceptionally high shoes that we love, go ahead and laugh...we will be...that is unless we hurt ourselves."

You are attracted to those who are unbridled, untrammeled, and free.

In love, you feel the most alive when your lover is creative and never lets you feel bored.

You'd like to your lover to think you are stylish and alluring.

You would be forced to break up with someone who was ruthless, cold-blooded, and sarcastic.

Your ideal relationship is lasting. You want a relationship that looks to the future... one you can grow with.

Your risk of cheating is zero. You care about society and morality. You would never break a commitment.

You think of marriage as something precious. You'll treasure marriage and treat it as sacred.

"event","i prolly shouldn't write this because it will prolly start alot of shit, but that's the drama know a days..




: ok 1st of all... this  whole thing with emmie and dan and megan doesnt concern  you... seroiusly u dont know megan she is actaully a nice person... and i def think dan did have ALOT to do with the whole sex thing and its not all megans fault....fucken they werent even going out and for emmie to say all this shit sooo not mature and you guys arent either...you guys seriously need to grow up and stay outa ppl business...YOU and your group should actually really here what people say about you and its pretty sad that you guys dont know... everyone thinks that you all are sluts bc you sit there and talk about sex and everything...eww why would would u spread it around ... Maybe if emmie gave it to dan he wouldnt have to go somehwere else.... 


^this was sent to stef by someone.. and i thought i might add to that..


okay well.. maybe this doesn't concern stef, but i think as a friend she should care and obviously she does..,anything that has to do with a friend is our business, i mean why the hell do you think you wrote that thing, because it's not your business either.. and what else are friends for to sit there and watch our friend who would do the same to us cry? NO.. and you know what's funny we told emmie herself that don't blame this all on megan because dan obviously he had to of done something too it wasn't all her, and she knows that!!.. and yes emmie and dan were going out, and i could see why emmie would be so mad that was HER boyfriend who she LOVED and gave everything to! and that's just disrespctful for anyone to do anything like that!.. and you don't know what emmie says you don't.. of coarse she's going to say she's a slut she FUCKED her boyfriend!, and Stef i have got to say that who gives a fuck what people say about you, what are you going to do about it you've got us!!.. and that's funny how you call her a slut when she just fucks one guy who she waited forever to do it with when she felt comfortable.. and guess what she LIKES IT! .., and as for emmie giving it to dan she obviously does something because he keeps coming back for more!.. 


okay on another note.. before you gals decide to say shit to people, why don't  you think of how your life is and how your boyfriend is to you too, before you find yourself in a situation talking shit about other peoples boyfriends and getting yourself in a situation where you infact have the same problem..

..oh and megan no hard feelings!, we know it wasn't all your fault and you are a probably a nice person, but you did fuck our bestfriends boyfriend.. I'm not going to sit there and hold that grudge forever but emmie prolly will and next time you find your body on another man think about who you could possibly hurt.. it obviously effects what other people think!


Stef- Don't even waste your time, it's not worth it, it just makes things a mess believe me!


well i would update a good note about my whole week but, i just can't remember all i know is my back KILLS, oh and i finally got my 5 hour coarse and i might get my road test on the 17th but i have to get a picture id before then!!! so wish me luck!"

"event","Wow this week went by really slow for only a 4 day week!! other than it being a slow week it was actually a pretty good one!..
Friday is really the earliest day that i can remember, haha well school was okay study hall was the best thanks to Brent haha... Brent and I cleaned Mr. Farrels broad para Pagame de Brent. Wow we really cleaned it alright haha we got is dripping went that he couldnt use it! and if you did the chalk like melted haha!.. then he asked us if we knew where someone's room was i don't even know the name and we're like yeah DUH, and we get out of the classroom and i got brent do you know where the room is? and he'[s like Hell no and i was like well what was the guy's name again?, I D K.. yikes so we went to the only room that we'[ve actually never been in and there was this guy who was never there when we were there and he was kinda younger and thankfully the papers belonged to him, then i asked Mr. Farrell if i could have candy because i got ""all my work done"" and i got this really good chocolate almond bar, and i go stef look what i got and she's like did you even get your work done, and i was just like does is look like it? haha that was great

After school i went to Tony's mom's with him and we had a big wrestling fight with these blow up toys wich happend to leave whelts!! and he let me get 4 hits in because i got a welt, muahaha bad idea :-P.. then he went to the bank and his work then took me home, and i got a shower an what not then Amy and I picked up Stef and we went to the Notre Dame game, wich actually wasn't that bad it wasn't a big blow out like you'd expect  and i got to see Katie and John!

SATURDAY- was the best day!! Stef came over we rented Napolean Dynamite and Stepford Wives wich i haven't seen yet! well we went over to Amy's to hang out with her and that was soo Amazing, we had to go to Wilson farms and stef stayed home  with Dylan to play bball since i was no competiton seeing that i kicked there asses O:-) yeah and we went to oops i mean prime market and those indian people are like american women wanters and the guy was asking what grade i was in because his son wants me and the man wants amy, and how old i was, that i was Beautiful and all this junk and amy was like see i told ya, because she had told me what was going to happen before we got there lol... then we came back and played some more bball watched tv ate pizza.. then played cards!! hahaha we were playing and i started to chug my drink and it like got alll foamy and shit and it went up my nose and i was like it went up my nose  with a really big burp like the biggest i've ever done it was like this ""it went up my noBBBBBBUUUUUUURRRRRPPPPPPPoose!"" and we all about pissed ourselfs we were all on the floor dieng laughing and i couldn't believe that it just happened i didn't even know i had to burp!! then i was looking at dylans cards and telling stef what ones he had hahha , then i was like hmm he doenst have anyones i need so i asked stef if she had any 10's and she's like nope go fish and i picked up a card and i wa like wait i  don't have anyy 10's!! WTF haha..  I played with there bird Frankie who i feel bad because gets no attention and i want it but Joe wont give it up even though they don't pay attention to the poor thing! so stef and i went home and tried to watch stepford wives and stef fell over my step that goes into my bedroom haha! that was a great time!!

Sunday- Watched napolean dynamite made breakfast took stef home then went to softball, hung out with tony  watched the village wich i thought was actually pretty good but tony thought was boring!! haha i love him so much! then we played Monoply again and this time he WHOOPPED my ASS i mean literally RAAAPPED it!! omg i got beat so bad!! this time he hit the free parking evertime and evertime EVERYTIME i went pass go i landed on the tax thing and never collected my 200 dollars EVERYTIME!! and tony had like 4 houses on everything and the only thing i owned was park place!!, then he went home and i copyed my religion prjoect to a floppy disk.. 

Today- Got to school and my floppy disk wouldn't work anywhere!! so i got screwed and it sucked because i did all the work while james just copyied mine and he got done before me AND handed his in ontime!!, so other then that my day was pretty good! i got a yummy lollypop from rach!! Amy picked Stef and I up after school and i had to do my project all over again and then she took me to Mrs Stevens house and i dropped it off to her!! haha Stefs mom picked her up and i made Sausage green beans and applesauce for me and Fish and french fries for james and now i'm sitting here doing nothing!!

"event","well well well, it's been awhile hasn't it.. well the whole trip to emm's crib was just simply amazing!.. it was me stef and of coarse Emm... we were tired and bored so we decided to get into emmie's closet and play dress up!!!.. yeha i know how little kid ish.. but ya gotta get in touch with your inner child once in aw hile ;-).. well i originally wanted to be a princess but that didn't quite fit in.. we all decided to dress up at SLUTS, you gotta your high quality hoes, hahaha and we got lots of pics and it was soo funny!.. of coarrse Stef's ASS hangs out of almost them all so if you would like to see some just ask, but you can't see one of those ;-)... yeah and her mom took pictures of us and crap it was the shit.. then we played the new caranium game with emm's mom and it was actually kinda cool because you could play with 3 people its basically everyone for themselves sort of speak.. but we put a movie in i can't remember what but emm went to bed and stef and i stayed up untill like 5.. then my mommy picked us up and we went to jodi's house to see my cousins and uncle... then we took her home.. and i hung out with tony, john, and Katie!.. and we went to bill and Stacey's for a football game wich ended up being a 4 hour game!! lol.. then tony stayed the night....



well i can't really think of any other important events untill yesturday's game in Thomas Edison!... well amy took stef and i, we went to BK and i didn't eat anything the whole day except for lunch.. i got a frozen coke.. then we were off for the game.. Both games were soo exciting and the guy we sat next to was soo funny.. he was a true T.E fan and it was great.. ""hey stef it kinda looks like a PENIS"".. haha "" yeah it kinda does"", well "" no wonder she doesn't get any guys , she's got her own damn thing"".. muahha.. well the game ended up being so intense that my heart and chest started to hurt.. but then it was time for Varsity's game and john and katie showed up it was nice to say hi.. there game was pretty intense to and the guy next to us was yet amazing again!.. haha it was soo funny.. oh god and during the national anthem wich didn't coem up for like 10 minutes i went to guy well it loooks like you're going to have to sing and he's like oh no come here baby, and i was like haha yeah okay .. well both jv and varisty ended up winning, my brother had 14 points i was soo proud of that big bro of mine :-P... he had like 5 and ones!.. and then Alex Gable my hero who i shook his hand.. he had the game winning shot with 1 second left on the clock and it was a 3.. muahaha.. then amy took stef and i home.. and i was actually tired so i decided to watch a movie before i went to bed, but i never fell asleep at all!! my chest was bothering me so i pulled an all nighter!!.. 

this morning i went to Softball with Ray, damn am i so out of shape from not having bball anymore!!.. yeah i doved for this ball and hurt my crotch bone and boob!!.. it was actually pretty fun.. then when i came home my mom took me to the emergency room for my chest.. When i get excited or whatever or angry and anything where my heart beats fast it causes tention and i get pains.. so then we went to the cafeteria to get food because i was starving since i dind't eat all day or nothing the day before besides lunch.. yeah i had a salad and a peice of pizza!.. it was actually pretty good.."

"event","well christmas break was pretty damn amazing considering that i got to spend every second of it just about with that studly boy of mine :-*.. i stayed the night at his house like everyday... of coarse it wasn't as fun as usual because it's only fun with john and katie who left for north carolina to see katie's mom and dad and family.. adn they shall be back the 5th i think?.. tomarrow.. well i can't wait because they're seriously the best people alive!! muahahah!! but anywho what a crazy week, me and tony wrestled like for ever and i have like 3 bruses on my thighs just little ones though but it was funny haha.. and of coarse tony gets away clean because i can never win!.. i get a good shot in once and awhile when i sneak attack him!!.. we went to the mall watched national treasure  i finally got the name memorized!! it was actually a pretty good movie!.. but i also went to the mall with stef and my mom back when i was sick and i didn't think i was going to make it because i kept feeling like i was going to faint i didnt but i got to get a peach smoothie!! i got a couple shirts and all that good stuff... then 2 days later i went with my mom and brother and i got another smoothie this time a berry banana blast and that one was really good! better than peach an nothings usually as good as peach! my brother got the peach one but ended up drinking the rest of mine anyways because i never finish.. i went to all the xmas tounry games they lost them all just about.. but i got to meet up on some old friends at the athens one it was pretty nice..
uuh i hate it! i got a site up for all my pictures!! wahoo on picture trail 

back to school well lets just say it sucks!! because of coarse they got to make up for not having school by giving you everything for homework thats possible!! uughh... it was nice to see alot of people that i hadn't seen in a week anyway i guess.. 


on a different note emmie's back with Dan i guess i have to be okay with it becaise she's one of my greatest friends but when he decides that he's done being his nice guy like he did before and start to fuck around with other guys and get into being his stoned self then she's just going to have to learn herself.. but who knows maybe he did change i doubt it but maybe.. Either way emmie with be stronger in the long run and i'm rooting for you girl, You'll do what's right in the end i have faith in ya!! Love you



emm aline  nL:so yeah i guess my sister heard the nasty mexican called me a bitch today

       ^ yeah that's kinda funny .. it's okay emm everyone knows you can't ever be mean to anyone! i mean she's worse then me! even when she's trying to be it's not that mean!! haha.. Gotta love ya girlly

"event","I've hit a wall of depression. My frustrations are very personal. But for some reason I can't help but revert them back to the political. Yea I know the cliche 'the political is personal' and vice versa, blah blah blah. But usually when I get sad I ignore my political life and just focus on my personal one. I haven't been able to create the situation. 

Well first off I'm a bit drunk. This probably contributed to the fact that this is probably one of the only times I decided to go on a political rant on the phone with Kate. But I really couldn't help it. I was depressed, and when asked why it was because my prof wouldn't give me an extension on my assignment, despite having the excuse that the course kits were sold out and i needed to do the reading AND that i'm at CFS meetings all this week and don't have any downtime. I still didn't get my extension which means I won't be handing in my assignment. 

Oh boo hoo whatever, it's not a big deal.

But then I can't help but bring in the political. I can't help but see this is a systemic issue, not an isolated personality issue with a specific teacher. There are so many students failing,, or being failed. Dropping out,, or actually being pushed out.. I don't mean failing in the traditional sense of a D grade. Whatever that's supposed to signify. I'm talking about the real thing - failing to learn, failing to accomplish what they set out to, failing to reach their goals which SEEMED perfectly attainable. All because of this rigid, exclusive curriculum that ignores the unique experiences and knowledges of.. well probably the majority of society. It's a glass slipper that's expected to suit everyone. I don't think I have to do detective work to discover that this curriculum.. was probably designed by some privileged white male who doesn't know -- or at least doesn't acknowledge -- the experiences and knowledges of oppressed and marginalized people, because he was never told about it, because when he went to school his classes probably only had people like him in them, because the people who designed those curriculums, didn't understand the experiences of oppressed peoples and therefore weren't admitted into those classes, etc, etc, all the way back to the colonization of turtle island. It's frustrating that in our society, those wounds endured by colonization are just as deep as ever, despite all the time that's gone by. These historic wounds have not healed.

Rigid pedagogies don't help students learn. And they certainly don't promote creativity. I mean - not that the education system sees creativity as much of an asset unless it's in the obvious visual art or whatev. Creative writing is not valued. Which I sort of like because I was never good at that shit anyways, but that's not the point. Well, probably, if this was school I wouldn't be able to use the example of Courtney Love's response when her husband died. They did the failed rehab thing, and courtney said that '80's tough love bullshit didn't work. I mean he ended up killing himself because of it. And yea, if that was out of date in the 90's, it is definitely out of date in 2008."

"event","I just recently got a better chest binder, which means I now look like a guy more than I previously did, AND it is way more comfortable.

Previously, I had been using a tensor bandage, which hurt the back of my rib cage, and actually ended up causing some wierd small little cuts in my skin - very nasty and unwanted. So I got a pair of extra-small biker shorts for $19 (initially I was afraid to do this because if I screwed up it would cost me a new pair of biker shorts). So I cut them out to form a bra-type thing, and it worked! I was very careful, and I didn't at all screw up. So that is way cheaper than getting a real chest binder and I think it works just as well.

Here is a photo of how it worked out:

The problem is I look like a girl when I have hair like this and im trying to find a way to have boy hair without cutting it short. This should be do-able, non?

The other day on the c-train I totally heard a group of folks use the term 'like like' in a way that wasn't supposed to be a joke. It was supposed to be a serious conversation they were having. I thought 'like like' was always a joke.. hmm.

Anyhow, when I went to go to work today, I was really tired, in a rush and I never bother about my work clothes too much. I forget my play clothes to change into after work. But I did that yesterday too. The main thing was that I put on a blouse without a shirt underneath that. I just naturally do that because of my tomboyish qualities or something, but I didn't think it was a big deal to go without. When I got to work, I realized this blouse had a nice little pattern down the front that had HOLES in it. and you could see the colour of my bra from miles away. It is also a lowcut blouse and doesn't have buttons high enough!

So at lunch today I went to a store and bought myself a grey tank top. And now I know why I wear shirts under my blouses!"

"event","I had rugby after school today.
We split up into 3 groups. The group I managed to settle in with was a very nasty one. They referred to the other group as the bad ones and jumped at the opportunity to express their hatred and disgust behind their backs.

Maya was asked to demonstrate this thing and needless to say, she messed up pretty bad. When she went down on the ground, she formed a 'fetal position' and when the coach told her to get straight so her team could step over her easier, she just didn't understand. Then people continued to bad mouth her, some girl even yelled 'FAG'.

3 of us were on defense, myslef, azra and that punk kid (i forget her name). 3 were on offense, and they intentionally played dirty, moving us needlessly too far offside and one actually strangled me. (Thankfully the coach caught that fucker).

Most of this was the product of 2 kids, one who is hostile and doesnt want to be classified as a bad one (even though she is -- on the bench most of the time.) Then there is the other one who seems to dislike most of the team, particularily that punk kid, the nice asian ones and myself. (Seems pretty random to me).

Well this is a team sport for marx sakes. I can't believe people (including myself) actually put up with that shit.
In Grade 9, I was one of the worst. I was pretty self-concious and scared. (Our team was made up of almost only seniors.) Our starter fly half (Jess) [and occasionally our Full Back] were always so nice to me, they were always there ready to back me up, even though I was very nerdy, stupid, rookie, ect. ect., they didn't care because they wanted to win, and in order to win, I had to be a good player too. I was incredibly grateful for the extent that she went to to make me feel righteous. I've been such a better player for it. So I decided that when I became a senior I would do this for her - I would encourage the rookies and show them that it was okay to mess up, because that stuff happens. When a teammate drops the ball and we all have to do push ups for it, I wasn't going to shutter in disgust and ignore them for the rest of the practice, like what happens to these rookies now. I want this sort of thing to have that 'pay it forward' effect. Maybe sometime in my senior year i'll help a rookie like I was and once they become a senior, they'll help the next generation too. Well whether that happens or not, I don't care. But I still think that it's necessary to do this for her, so her efforts are rewarded (even though she isn't even aware).

I don't want to be the best on the team and neither should THEY. The point is to be the best TEAM in the REIGION. I want to be the best in the region, this is what we're all supposed to be fighting for. 'Because without respect, there's gonna be nothing left!'

UPDATE: I HATE This.
Shona says: Didn't seem to happy witht he ethics of our team today.
Maya says: the ethics of our team?
Shona says: Yes, I mean people playing like it's them against the team, not the team against the region.
Maya says: yeah
Maya says: brb
Shona says: Okay...
Shona says: I mean, there are some nasty girls on our team, not very friendly. I'm not sure if you've noticed that?
Maya says: uh... most people were really nice
Maya says: do you mean anyone in particular? 
May says: I must go.

Alexis and I, both decidedly going to the art school of OCAD, we're going to share housing. woo fuck and hoo. The future plan is to part all night and day and not study because tests are obsolete now. And get a low-paying job as a professional dreamer. Now dreaming you say is easy. Well it's not. Therefore, I have compiled a list to make oneself a much more effective in the area of dreaming.

Shona's list of Tips to Dream:
1. If you fall asleep watching television, the show will seep into your dreams. 

For example, If one always falls asleep during beat the geeks because it's such a boring show, they'll dream about beat the geeks. An exaggerated obscuro surrealist version of such. 

This can be really cool if you have the right channel.
We call this the ""teledream""
2. Wake up during REM sleep so you remember your dream. Plan it. For more information on correct times, analyze <a href=http://www.uwm.edu/~johnchay/sl.htm>the interactive model of the brain at sleep</a>.
3. If you don't want to have nightmares about being naked in public, don't go to sleep naked.
4. If you don't want to have afternoonmares about not being able to wake up, don't go to sleep while you should be doing work.

<b>Shona's Hierarchy of Dreams</b>

Here we have the types of dreams in order of most calm and least obscure to most obscure.
Note that the most obscure ones tend to be 'high risk' and can lead to irreversible emotional scarring.

A. The standard dream: You're not that tired but you routinely go to bed after a day of routine. You wake up and you're still not tired. Rating: Low
B. The tired dream: When you go to bed you're tired. You fall into a deep sleep and probably dream Rating: Low.

C. The nightmare: Dark. Strange Room. Waking up sweaty. Possibly watched a scay movie. Rating: Medium
D. The 'waking up in the middle of REM' dream: Probably tired. Waking life and dream submerges and remote sounds end up in your dream. Takes you a while to realize it was just a dream. Rating: Medium.

E. The teledream: Fall asleep watching television. Probably on an uncomfortable sofa. Wake up all knotted and tired. Usually after school. T.V. Show seeps in to dream Rating: Medium-High depending on show
F. The AFTERNOONMARE: Fall asleep during day. Succeptable to common misconceptions such as: Where you are. (You usually end up falling asleep in a strange area.)
What time is it? (Is it the morning? Are you late for work? Is it the middle of the night?). Dreams tend to be nightmares about not being able to wake up. Rating: High

G. THE BORING MOVIE AT SCHOOL DREAM: Fall asleep during a boring movie. Kill your neck. Terribly uncomfortable. The key is the wake up: HOLY FUCK! WAS I ASLEEP? You risk talking in your sleep and sleepwalking. You risk getting looked at strangely. This is toppled with bemusement. You're not in dreamland, you're at school and schools have a strange yellow tint to them."

"event","so i had an AMAZING weekend
I went to the Kiss Concert with gen and Alison and it was so good but so cold. and wet. basicly no other words to describe it except AWESOME. oh yeah, and after seeing backstreet boys perform, we have decided that boy bands are definitly back in. lol. but we were there for like, 8 hours so i got home at midnightish and then had to wake up at 5ish the next morning for my show which was also super fun
i got to marlborough at 6ish and rode in long stirrup equitation and short/long stirrup hunter with Duke-he was so good.  So in my eq division, there was only one other person so there wasnt much competition so i got 3 firsts from that and the *cough* ""special"" prizes with them. so i got a oh so nice mec keyring, a little green journal and a hoofpick-the only useful thing there. IN my Hunter class, i got 3 seconds but could have had another first but i almost took a wrong jump (i swerved just in time but it messed up my jump line) so i got a second
i think this might be the best ive ever done at MEC...hmm, i think it must be the horse since Duke always gets champions and stuff...
anyway, school is almost over so im super pysched but unfortunatly, exams are next week so thats kinda stressful
AND LACROSSE IS OVER! WHAT AM I GOING TO DO WITH MYSELF?! IM GOING TO GET OUT OF SHAPE AND FAT AND I WONT BE ABLE TO PLAY LAX UNTIL NEXT YEAR!!! *faints*
hmm..maybe ill go running

"event","so the clark clinic was awesome and was really helpful although i wish i had been in a different group-gwen and I were in a group with two people who cant jump any higher than 18 inches/2 feet so we only did maybe 18 inches which wasnt so cool...but it was awesome anyway...soccer today was fun, we won by 5 points or something. But ive been sick since the milton game on wednesday (we were playing in the rain and it was really cold anyway) so that kinda puts a damper on everything and makes my throat constantly hurt and since my house is freezing, me being cold makes it even more cold (so currently i have like, a billion layers on)...lets see...ah yes, today is also mother's day. So as usual since i am over scheduled as is my sister, and my dad had to drive us everywhere, Mom got all pissy since we actually had things to do. So she now shes all mad at everyone and im mad at her for other reasons and its very tense now...so thats pretty exciting...ugh, huge bio paper due on tuesday and kristen and i still have to write the intro and finish the discussion and do some revisions...which is going to take a long time.
btw, CLARE IS A SUPERHERO!! hehe

"event","hehe, i am COVERED in mud.  i just had my soccer game in the pouring rain and we were all sliding all over the place; i went for this one ball to kick it out and as i kicked it, my legs went out from under me and i landed flat on my ass. great impression to make on everyone on my team. but thankfully we won (4-2) which was joyful...umm, went riding earlier today and i was on duke (again) and gwen got to ride penny. And once again, i am pissed at katheryn because she was all ""tory, im going to start putting you on penny now and you might ride her in the clark clinic so ill have you on her next week so you get to know her better"" and then yesterday when i signed up for a double lesson SHE DOESN'T PUT ME ON PENNY and puts bobby on her instead and then gwen on her today. and gwen rides her much better than i do so there go my chances at finally having a good horse...well, Duke's a great horse but hes just so...blah. Not to mention that he's so wide that after everytime i ride him i feel sore...kinda like one of those creepy looking cowboys who look like they have bowed legs...oh! but i got pretty new riding pants yesterday, and i finally ordered new tall boots, which sadly have zippersin the back *shrugs* oh well, theyre still pretty.. anyway, im supposed to be writing my english paper so i had better go finish that or Ms Robbins will have my head

"event","erm, yeah...so ive decided to start this whole livejournal thing up again even though i havent used this since december or somethin. anyway, life is pretty ok i suppose. Riding today was kinda stressful since Katheryn tried to put me back on Molly; which actuall went pretty well considering that the last time i rode her i refractured my tailbone and had the Big Meltdown and i actually managed to trot her-cantering her is a dream but keeping her in a trot is incredibly stressful cause she does this wierd 'lets throw my head up and make it seem like im going to take off so i can scare the shit out of tory-sounds like fun!'God, that horse needs a martingale-one would think after what happened with me and how she got put on probation cause of that, they would use a stronger bit or put a martingale on her...oh, and then (gwen, i love you to death but its just hard) she puts gwen on molly and of course, as usual, gwen can manage her perfectly with no problem and it seems as if katheryn is PURPOSELY trying to mess with my mind and making me feel even worse.  Not to mention the fact that since she took gwen off molly, guess who i had to get on? Gershwin-the love of my life of course! (that was sarcasm for you dim-wits who didnt pick that up) Putting me on an ex-racehorse who absoulutly HATES me when im that up-tight about molly already if NOT SUCH A HOT IDEA KATHERYN!! and then im like ""Katheryn, he hates me, hes really skitzy-i feel like hes going to take off"" and she gives me this look like 'god, you are so stupid' and is all ""what are you talking about? hes one of the most laidback horses in the barn"" argggghhhhh!!!anyway...it was incredibly stressful...not to mention that we have our clark montgomery clinic next weekend and im probably going to be expected to be able to ride her if duke isnt able to be ridden.  Speaking of duke, he was awesome today, we did jumping with him-my first jumpcourse was painful to watch, but they got better...hmm...what else, mom and sarah are back from armenia (unfortuatly-jk) 
lacrosse is awesome of course (now that i can play again-i had a minor tear in my miniscus or something-that would be in my knee)so far our record is 3-1 and hehe, our game against Pingree on friday was AMAZING! i got in this fight with one of the pingree players and it was s o  m u c h  f u n ! the girl would literally take her hand off her stick when i got the ball and GRAB MY SHIRT-it was actually quite amusing cause she was tiny and so i just kinda dragged her along.  anyway, the ref didnt see, and then the girl checked my across the face so i got the ball, scored, and while the ball was going back up for the draw i went to the ref and told him about the shirt holding and he called it the next time.  but i didnt hear him call it, so i told her"" STOP grabbing my SHIRT""  in my toryish way and shes like ""wtf, im not doing anything"" and she starts swearing at me and the ref is like girls, its just a game, relax.  she was so mad! And finally at the end of the game, i was told to just run out the clock so i had 30 seconds or something to just hold the ball and do what i want and the girl kept trying to check me and she couldnt! haha number 23-it was very funny, oh if looks could kill...bwahaha....these things make games much more fun...i hope we play them again *checks calendar* damn...
oh well, next game is at milton so i get to see my old bds friends who play lax and possibly noah

"event","hmm, not much to say...
exams are over and while exams were kinda stressful with the studying, i have decided i really like exam week.  yea, im crazy...
so now im on vacation for 2 weeks, and hopefully will be going skiing soon and/or will be riding a few times and doing the jumper show on the 31st-but that probably wont happen.  speaking of riding, Katheryn has been working on getting a lease set up with me and Molly (who is a horse) but there are no guarentees that it will work out.  And considering i fell off on friday night, she might rethink it.  but at least it wasnt compltetly my fault and since molly has been kinda evil lately with Kate also, theyre putting her on moodymare and will put her on something stronger if neccessary.  the only down side b eing they have to take her off it before show season starts.  and considering this is what she's like in the show ring, they are still deciding whether to keep her on it or not.  so that might work, it might not.
on a sadder note, hershey has left and might not be coming back because they thought he was becoming ""dangerous"".  he didnt like the cold, threw a few begginers off, and he is deemed dangerous??? well, if they hadnt switched him to begginer riders, he would have been happier and may have enjoyed being a schoolie!  they did the same thing to Fawn and look how that turned out? i suppose its for the best though if he really was unhappy.  ah well...going to the movies with the family ttyl
i guess i did have a lot to say...

"event","spent all of sat. basicly at the barn.  freezing my ass off.  but i got to ride and Dawn came for a clinic and I got to ride Molly! Sadly, she spooked at the beginning and nearly threw me (now i have a pretty bruise on my inner thigh from slamming into the pommel) so then she was kinda spedish for the rest of the lesson but we were jumping maybe 2'3"" to 2'9"" so that was fun even though she kept spazing.  toward the end with the big jumps she finally calmed down so that was even more fun.  went home, studied some for exams, went back to the barn, rode cider for an hour with my regular lesson.  worked on making hard turns in a jump course (without the jumps being up) so that was kinda fun/boring at times.  Cider is ok, but i'd never ridden hom before and since i hadn't ridden for 2 weeks, and was sore from the morning lesson, i was kinda sloppy and spazzy (surprise surprise).worked for maybe an hour and 45 minutes with Heather and put up with annoying little kids (I dont know how Heather puts up with them all week and all day) got home at maybe 5:00, did some more studying, watched a bad, corny Chritmas movie...and finally went to bed.  
Sunday, went to Gwen's Ballet, came home, studied forever, watched some tv, had my tutor, and went to bed.  Today, took a math test which i probably failed, and our finch lab is due on wed and we still have all the questions to answer...exams are next week and i still havent made any appointments to meet with teachers, and lets see what else?

THEY ARE WORTH 25-30% OF OUR ENTIRE SEMESTER GRADE!! and im most likely not going to do well on my english cuz i hate english and i cant write, math should be fine, history should be fine, bio might be ok if i study, and french will be ok if i memorize that paragraph in french that i wrote about myself (she told us that was going to be one of the questions).
not to mention i am going to be riding more now that soccer is over...

but on a happy note, our two puppies are super cute and my puppy is named Bella and my sister's dog is Frodo (as in LOTR).  bella is really relaxed already but frodo is having some trouble adjusting-and while they are super cute...

they are also super messy. the first thing frodo did when i took him out of his carrier, was pee ALL over the kitchen floor.  pleasant, right? anyway, i should have pictures of them up on photobucket soon and i think gwen put up some on her account so go look cuz they are the cutest puppies ever!!

Soccer Season is over which is very sad but also happy cuz that means NO MORE JENNY!!WAHOO! jk (but not really) We should definitly get ""we hate jenny shirts""lol.  And, thankfully, i am not playing bball this year cuz last year was complete and utter hell.  I was going to play squash but I decided not to cuz of riding and stuff...

School..umm, lets just say that i got my midterm grades and while I think they arent great-but ok-my mom is completly flipping out and is like ""no riding if you dont pull up your grades""  ""I should just pull you out of winsor if you arent working hard"" and I AM WORKING HARD BUT IM JUST NOT GETTING STARIGHT A'S!!ARGGHHHHHH*vents for awhile*

Riding is going well cuz ive been riding a really good horse for the past 2 weeks and thats been awesome cuz even though we arent jumping right now, we are working our canter stuff and she has THE nicest canter EVER!  so that makes my life alot easier cuz then when im trying to work on my position, i dont have to worry about being bucked off like i do with hershey.  

And good news! I am getting a new dog so that should be happy.  and even though I miss tuggy so much, I know i made the right choice and i dont regret any part of it.  He was in pain and it was kinder to let him go.  So we should be getting our new dog by christmas time so i can have a puppy to come home to again.  Zorro has gotten so big its scary! hes maybe twice the size of when I first brought him home! 

anyway, ive g2g because i have a huge bio test tomorrow that if i dont do well on, goodbye riding!

"event","yup, my bad week was completed with a bad riding lesson...took a pretty nasty fall off hershey.  heres what happened...Lucille had started out on hershey and he bucked her off after taking off with her.  So i get on hershey and we start jumping.  So the first couple go fine but when i start my jump course, he completely FLIPS OUT at the double.  he leaps into the air, and then crow-hops (for all you 2003 brumbies, this was similar to what kermit did to me except Hershey is MUCH larger and jumped MUCH higher into the air) so i am able to sit the 1st one ok but when he goes up for the second, i am completely unseated and go toppling over his shoulder, land on my back/left shoulder and roll.  Meanwhile, Hershey is galloping to the other end of the field.  And not only was this in front of my dad, but it was in front of Heather (my friend whos also barn manager or something, and katheryn, who owns the barn and dictates who i ride etc.  so i got back on and schooled him back over the double and he was good (for the most part lol) and i dismount when we're done.  so i handwalk him back up to the outdoor ring and as Im walking him into the parking lot to go into the ring-he flips out yet again-only this time, im already on the ground and about 5 people from the show team are standing there while i hold onto the reins as my horse rears.  in the parking lot.  with other parents watching.  it was mortifying.  but they were all good job controlling him tory, so i guess it wasnt as horrible as it could have been.  and besides, Ill get hershey back next week *laughes evilly*...but only if they put me on him...whatever-i g2g ice my shoulder

I have three tests next week which Im probably going to fail.But happily I just got my french quiz back and I got a 98!! very happy-specially cuz it was worth 100 points (most quizzes are only worth 50) so in reality it was a test.  Soccer is fun and all but its kinda annoying cuz I dont really like the coachs, and (call me a pessimest) but I dont think were going to do very well cuz we already lost our first game and no offense to anyone on my team who reads this, but it didnt really seem like anyone cared very much...so there goes the jv undefeated record-jv has been undefeated for the past 2-4 yrs or something.  Anyway...ah yeah-riding-pissed at my barn again cuz when I asked about the next show, theyre all ""all the horses are being leased and youre not riding enough""  which i know is a load of bull.Not all of the horses are being leased and I am riding just as much as some other people on the show team-so basicly Ive been Kicked off the show team...*ponders* ah well, it doesnt really matter if Im switching barns soon so whatever...but im still pissed at them...bout this and the whole Hershey thing...and the other stuff Im stressed bout is really unimportant so I wont talk bout that right now...g2g finish my hw that i havent started yet!

"event","got four hours of sleep last night so this is going to be short cuz i have no energy...decided i have to wait to switch barns for 2 more monthes (until soccer is over) and then I will start looking at volo more.  Reasons why? cuz volo is more serious and i could only ride once a week right now but once soccer ends ill be able to ride twice a week and start showing again.  Also cuz volo is my stables big rival so if i even set foot there katheryn would flip at me and kick me out of the barn-and then I would be stableless-and to clarify thats bad.  So i dont think Im going to play squash, i think im just going to play soccer and lacrosse this year.  Speaking of sports, we had our first official practice ""as a team"".  So im on JV soccer and we have our first game this weekend AND ITS IN MAINE!!SUCH A LONG BUS RIDE WITH CRAZY PEOPLE SUCH AS MYSELF!!HOW AM I GOING TO LIVE?! ill just bring my discman or something...oh and cuz im playing soccer or saterday, I WONT BE ABLE TO RIDE! which means i wont have ridden for TWO WHOLE WEEKS! ahhhh-plus school...life is so stressful...whatever..Im going to go get ice cream-ttyl!

"event","things are definitly looking up-had a pretty good day considering how pissed i am about not going to marlbrough *growls at stable*.  Went shopping today-very sad that Weathervane closed but i went to AE and gap and got dragged by my mother into ann taylor and Talbots-and the worst part was that my mom tried on clothes in Gap-it was mortifying...so i was shopping for like 5 hours-always makes me feel better to shop-before that went with gwen to find the stable that would have been like 5 minutes away but its now its just regular suburbs...oh well-but the happy news is that I think i found the perfect barn! Volo Farm has good facilities, instructers with amazing qualifications-one of whom used to be at my barn but left-and the horses are really good-it shows these like 4 foot jumps and I dont think I would be jumping that high but I could get there in a year or two...maybe...and, they have a really good showing program! they go to all these top rated shows and actually do well-so Im pretty excited about it but I think I stil have to work on my parents...but if any of you actually care about my poor, pathetis life got to www.volofarm.com and thats the place-if you do go look, aim me and let me know what you think-that is of course if you ride and have some idea of what ther hell Im talking about.  
Soooooooo...anyway....
not much else to say actually...
So i think im going to go work on my parents about the whole volo thingie...

"event","Still pissed about the whole not going to the show today...i couldnt sleep all night and so at 4 i was thinking to myself ""*sigh*, all my friends are waking up right now to go to Marlbrough...TOO BAD IM NOT GOING!!"" but whatever, im feeling somewhat better cuz I think I may have found a new barn online which gwen and I are going to go check out today-but her dad thinks it isnt there anymore so im trying not to get my hopes up too high...anyway-rode texas yesterday and he was really surprisingly good cuz he only threw a few bucks and stuff.  But we were doing extended canter and trot and Pam is all ""let him go tory-let him have his head-Youre holding him back!"" So, I give him his head and he takes off completely out of control and pam is like ""exellent-thats exactly what I wanted to see"" and im just sitting there on top of this crazy horse who is hand galloping around the ring COMPLETLY out of control and shes saying exellent? crazy world...but sadly hes being sold cuz hes not working out-he likes to throw tantrums with the beginners-but hes really fun to take crosscountry and hes actually a fairly good jumper and he has smooth gaits so I dont want him to be sold...:( but if we can find a new barn gwen could buy texas! but she wants to buy gershwin so thats not going to happen...ok, going to go eat and then go check out that stable...

"event","Really really pissed off at my stable-because I dont board or lease, all of the people who do get priority for shows therefore I dont have a horse! and what about my horse that I ride hershey? well apparently katheryn has decided he isnt cut out for showing and therefor ehas retired him from showing after ONE FUCKING SHOW!!!And she wont even give him a second chance! AND, she thinks hes not a good advanced horse cuz he keeps throwing tantrums-WHICH IS WHY I THINK HE IS SUCH A GOOD ADVANCED HORSE! and so now, he is a beginner horse and my little SISTER is riding him and im probably never going to ride him again and so Im not going to the show tomorrow even though I entered the show like, 2 weeks ago-and they are telling me NOW? THE DAY BEFORE THE SHOW THAT I CAN'T GO?! and she tried being nice about it, went and talked to my dad and was like im sorry, im sorry, im sorry but ya know what? IM SORRY DOESNT CUT IT! I LEFT MY WHOLE WEEKEND OPEN FOR THIS SHOW AND GOT MY HOMEWORK AHEAD OF TIME SO THAT I COULD GO TO THIS SHOW!!AND THEY TELL ME NOW THAT I CANT GO?! whatever-none of you really care about my pathetic life and problems so ill just shut up about this *fumes some more* well, i have nothing else to say other than the stuff I already said so Im going to go find a different stable to go to online.  Ill be back when Im not so Pissed.

"event","not much happening here...went riding on friday and finally rode hershey which is hopefully a sign that i am taking him to Marlborough next weekend...but after what happened at the last horse show I tok him to Im not sure if I am going to be taking him (for those of you who dont know, to make a long story short-went into my jumping class and it didnt go well-meaning lots of rearing and other bad stuff. Anyway, school is starting on Wednesday and I really dont want to go into high school.  I really dont feel like going back to my ever so boring life in an all girls private school in boston-at least this summer I had some excitement in my life-although not much.  lets see...what else...oh yeah-in addition to school starting, i have soccer tryouts and im not sure im going to be able to try out considering I have 2 broken toes-due to playing bball in bare feet and being pushed to the ground by one of my guy friends and doing a faceplant into the pavement.  And to add to my neverending stress my dog has cancer and we just found out it has spread to all his major organs so he only has a few more weeks...so its all kinda depressing-but on a happier note-we did just get a new kitten from HVC who we named Zorro.  Hes incredibly playful and enjoys tearing up everything from the curtains to my face.  anyway-Ive g2g eat dinner.bye"

In 1947, Hansel und Gretel was the first Metropolitan Opera performance heard on radio, and later became the Met&rsquo;s first complete recording in English issued by Columbia Masterworks Records in 1947. By no means a children&rsquo;s opera, but one for music lovers of all ages to enjoy!</td></tr></tbody></table>Admission: $18 members $16<br />Students/Seniors $1 discount<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.natickarts.org"">www.natickarts.org</a>"

Man, I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever slept so well...it rained here and I always sleep so well when it rains in Vermont. Just something about the air and the sound of rain. I love it. Though, I could do without the cold. I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m going to do when I have to go back to sleeping only a few hours a night. That&rsquo;s going to suck.</span></p> <p style=""margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica; min-height: 14.0px"">&nbsp;</p> <p style=""margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0.0px"">They were running really late during rehearsal which was kind of good as I was able to check e-mail and got the good news about being cast in Hansel &amp; Gretel. YAY! It&rsquo;s gonna be nuts for me to try and get all of this learned, but I&rsquo;ll figure something out. First I need to get the score here somehow...</span></p> <p style=""margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica; min-height: 14.0px"">&nbsp;</p> <p style=""margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0.0px"">My aria went much better today.

I feel so nervous for all of those people. It&rsquo;s soooooo scary being in that sort of situation without cameras everywhere, nevermind with them! Sheesh! I can&rsquo;t imagine what kind of pressure they were all feeling with the cameras everywhere... I&rsquo;m glad that it was done though. It really gives us all some perspective (even though we know it is all fixed...kinda). The sweetest thing was when all of us Il Barbiere singers walked into the theater, the audience clapped. Our director announced that the reason people were clapping (in case they didn&rsquo;t know) was that the singers from the show were in the audience and he acknowledged all of us. It was very sweet and really cool. The community here is soooo supportive and very very arts-oriented. It is so refreshing to see. Another interesting thing - one of the finalists in the met competition sang the Witch&rsquo;s aria from Hansel &amp; Gretel. It is sort of an odd aria, but rather difficult. I found it odd that she would choose that aria(or that they would). But I guess it is something a little different, and they do perform that opera at the met...so it kind of makes sense???</span></p> <p style=""margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica; min-height: 14.0px"">&nbsp;</p> <p style=""margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0.0px"">Thursday</span></p> <p style=""margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica; min-height: 14.0px"">&nbsp;</p> <p style=""margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0.0px"">No rehearsal today until 6:00pm. YAY! Our conductor is away for a few days which is a welcome respite. He is very kind and I like him a great deal, but it is still weird living with you conductor no matter how you look at it! Meredith and I went out for brunch while the cleaning lady was here and we spent the rest of the time resting as she has not had any chance to rest at all. I&rsquo;ve been catching up on some reading, which I never get to do, and listening to the Witch&rsquo;s role in Hansel &amp; Gretel. It is sort of crazy and I&rsquo;m trying not to over-think things. Like how the hell can I learn this challenging music so quickly? But then I remember that I learned Silla in 4 days with no previous recordings to listen to and nothing to compare it to and now I feel much better. :)</span></p> <p style=""margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica; min-height: 14.0px"">&nbsp;</p> <p style=""margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0.0px"">I&rsquo;m hoping that this cold weather goes away soon. It is really messing with all of our voices and our health. We open a week from Friday and I really want the warmth back. Everyone stills sounds amazing, but if it keeps going on like this, it is going to have a bigger effect on our voices. *sigh* Sometimes it sucks being a singer...</span></p> <p style=""margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica; min-height: 14.0px"">&nbsp;</p> <p style=""margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0.0px"">Rehearsal was good tonight, though all of us are really low on energy. I think everyone really needs some time off. We have Saturday off, which is excellent. My friends from the VT faire are having a b-day party on saturday and I&rsquo;m starting to feel a little stir-crazy here. So I&rsquo;m gonna make the drive down to them (I think its like an hour and 1/2) and visit with them on Saturday. I think I&rsquo;ve been staying in too much...you all know me, I have to do like 10 million things at once, and all I&rsquo;ve been doing is staying in and reading. So I need to go out and explore around town a little more and get out. The problem with this is of course that the weather just sucks, so being outside is not the best idea for la voce. Here&rsquo;s hoping that things change weather-wise.</span></p>"

I think everyone is going to enjoy this. It is funny and nuts and has everything you could imagine, and probably things you wouldn&rsquo;t imagine. ;) Meredith and I think it is fun being the only girls in a cast full of guys. :)&nbsp;</span></p> <p style=""margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica; min-height: 14.0px"">&nbsp;</p> <p style=""margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0.0px"">We had a sitzprobe at night with the orchestra. If I didn&rsquo;t explain before, a &ldquo;sitz&rdquo; as we call it is when we rehearse with the orchestra to figure out tempos and such. The singers sit on the stage and we stand when we have to sing. It&rsquo;s a loooooooooooooonnnggg and arduous process, but we managed to make it fun. It was also decided that we would be hosting a bbq night @ our house the next day. YAY! This house is definitely meant for partying.</span></p> <p style=""margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica; min-height: 14.0px"">&nbsp;</p> <p style=""margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0.0px"">Not much else to report for Monday...they gave us Tuesday off because everyone is getting allergies and we are all looking and sounding a little tired.

YAY! The conductor and I came into town for a bit we are all working off of 2 different scores (including the orchestra) and he was doing comparisons of the 2. They are incredibly different, so he wanted to order one of the other scores which is much better for the orchestra. I got to catch up on some e-mail and do a little business in town. :) Then we headed to the store to pick up essentials for the bbq.&nbsp;</span></p> <p style=""margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica; min-height: 14.0px"">&nbsp;</p> <p style=""margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0.0px"">I had part of the day to sit outside and just read and breathe for a while.

The mountains do that to me. :) The nights have been in the 30s eek. Thank god we have heat. The weekend was hot though.

We have a cleaning lady coming in, thank god. But I want to get my room a little more organized. I plan on going into town a little early to post this. We have rehearsal ending @ 4:00 so we can have time to eat dinner and then go watch the Met&rsquo;s broadcast of &ldquo;THE AUDITION&rdquo; which is a documentary they did on their annual competition that they have all over the country. I&rsquo;ve already seen it, but I&rsquo;d love to see it again. I think it is very beneficial to all singers to see the whole process.&nbsp;</span></p> <p style=""margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica; min-height: 14.0px"">&nbsp;</p> <p style=""margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0.0px"">Hope all is well at home!

The lake is quiet except for the frogs happily singing.

If you know me, that&rsquo;s late. My rehearsal didn&rsquo;t start until 11:30. Which is amazing. My rehearsals @ BASOTI and in Italy always started at 9. It was more a company meeting. We met all the other cast members. Meredith and I are the only girls. Which is all sorts of crazy and fun. After the meeting, I wasn&rsquo;t called for about 45 minutes, so I walked around the town a bit with one of the cast members who actually recognized me from Hartt. It was good catching up and he&rsquo;s been in a show here before, so he showed me to all of the fun spots. There is a beautiful waterfall around the corner from the theater. There is also a little coffee shop that has given all of us singers 9 free coffees. They are very sweet and were kind of a hang out spot for the cast last year.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; font: normal normal normal 12px/normal Helvetica; min-height: 14px; "">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; font: normal normal normal 12px/normal Helvetica; ""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; "">Rehearsals were great and passed in a whirlwind... the way the director works is fun. He kind flies through things and is more of a theater person, which I think is so good for opera. It gives us all a fresh perspective. He is very much someone who is willing to work with you and take your ideas into account. I love people like that.</span></p><p style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; font: normal normal normal 12px/normal Helvetica; min-height: 14px; "">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; font: normal normal normal 12px/normal Helvetica; ""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; "">So, not much else to report. I&rsquo;m pretty exhausted. I shouldn&rsquo;t be, but I am. I blame the heat...mostly. Tomorrow we have a meet the singers event where we will meet people who &ldquo;adopted&rdquo; us. There were several donors who basically adopted us and helped pay our contracts here with the company. It&rsquo;s a good idea and so far everyone has been so great to us. They told us that tomorrow&rsquo;s event is always a lot of fun. We&rsquo;re singing things that are not from the show, which is a nice change. I&rsquo;m singing my russian aria which is the polar opposite from what I sing in the opera. lol. But it is gorgeous and they requested that I sing it. :)&nbsp;</span></p><p style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; font: normal normal normal 12px/normal Helvetica; min-height: 14px; "">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; font: normal normal normal 12px/normal Helvetica; ""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; "">Ok, I&rsquo;m rambling and I&rsquo;m tired.

The Conductor and Meredith had an earlier call today, so, I couldn&rsquo;t sleep too late. And for some reason my cell phone shuts off at 4 am here because of low battery, even though I charged it to full capacity...weird. So that wakes me up. But NO MOCKINGBIRD! lol.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; font: normal normal normal 12px/normal Helvetica; min-height: 14px; "">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; font: normal normal normal 12px/normal Helvetica; ""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; "">So we had breakfast and went through our music. I must say how wonderful it is to be in a professional production where you go over your tempi with the conductor. Especially a cool one like ours who is really flexible. We had a great deal to talk about this morning. it was sunny and beautiful for the morning, and around noon when they left, it got cloudy. I decided against the canoe today since we had to sing at the Meet the Singers event later on. Lord knows with my luck, I&rsquo;d end up hurting myself somehow. tee hee.</span></p><p style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; font: normal normal normal 12px/normal Helvetica; min-height: 14px; "">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; font: normal normal normal 12px/normal Helvetica; ""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; "">I went grocery shopping instead. On the way, I passed a A&amp;W diner where the waitresses are on roller skates. LUV IT! It is mostly countryside with fields and mountains not too far off. So gorgeous. I spent the rest of the afternoon getting ready for the concert and going over my music.</span></p><p style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; font: normal normal normal 12px/normal Helvetica; min-height: 14px; "">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; font: normal normal normal 12px/normal Helvetica; ""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; "">The meet the singers event was fun. Lots of schmoozing. Everyone here is so ridiculously nice and so accomodating. We&rsquo;re getting spoiled. I wish every company would treat their singers like this. Its awesome. Everyone sang well. My piece went ok. I kinda lost it at the very very end of my aria, but if you don&rsquo;t know the piece, it wasn&rsquo;t noticeable. Meredith and I stuck together during the cocktail hour and had to dodge all the guys trying to make us laugh while we were speaking to the donors. I know I&rsquo;ve already said this, but the guys are all hilarious. We actually met a composer who lives here in Middlebury and composed a new work for Fort Worth opera. Jonathan Blalock, who is playing our Count Almaviva here is actually going to be in it as well. Coolness. The opera world is SUCH a small world!</span></p><p style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; font: normal normal normal 12px/normal Helvetica; min-height: 14px; "">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; font: normal normal normal 12px/normal Helvetica; ""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; "">We had a rehearsal with the orchestra directly after. It is called a sitzprobe where we all sit and sing along with them. The orchestra is quite good, they are smaller, but still very talented and very nice. Unfortunately, about 1/4 of the way through rehearsal I started getting a horrible tension headache. IT was awful. I had to sing the insane 140+ page sextet with a headache. I didn&rsquo;t let it bother me, but part of singing is letting the sound go through the top of your head, and if you have a headache, you can&rsquo;t really feel the sound. It is kind of a block and it feels like you cant get anything through. So that was a challenge. Luckily, we stopped right before my aria. Phew! We had fun though, of course we laughed a lot.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; font: normal normal normal 12px/normal Helvetica; min-height: 14px; "">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; font: normal normal normal 12px/normal Helvetica; ""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; "">We were all soooo exhausted and starving afterwards. Our eating patterns here are not normal. We can go without having time for food for about 8 hours. Its kinda nuts. But that&rsquo;s ok. We&rsquo;re rushing through everything and don&rsquo;t even realize that we are hungry until we are done. :)&nbsp;</span></p></span></div>"

It always feels like home here. Some people like the beach, I prefer the forest and the mountains. They make me so calm. Its hard to explain.

I walk out my door and 30 feet later - lake and mountain. *sigh* I love it and I already don&rsquo;t want to leave. We were told that we get the better of the accomodations...um YAH! We are in a &ldquo;summer home&rdquo; which basically looks like a large cabin, but the inside is all leather couches and looks like a ski lodge. We have a cleaning lady who is coming in once a week and all have our own rather large bedrooms. I get the smallest, cuz I am the last one here, but who cares! It is still bigger than my room at home! There is a covered porch and then a deck. There are canoes!! I looooooove canoeing. Srsly. Haven&rsquo;t done it in years but die a little inside every time I see one and can&rsquo;t go out on it. So you better believe I am taking advantage of that!</span></p><p style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; font: normal normal normal 12px/normal Helvetica; min-height: 14px; "">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; font: normal normal normal 12px/normal Helvetica; ""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; "">I met some of the cast tonight. They had a little rehearsal of a few scenes since not everyone is here yet. I got to rehearse my aria for the meet the singers event on Friday which is when we all sing a little something not from the opera for the locals to enjoy and to encourage them to come see the opera. (Which, BTW Sunday is almost sold out!!) It went well. I got to watch the blocking a little. This cast is GOOD. I mean really really good. And they are all very nice so far and hilarious. They make it a point up here not to hire anyone stuffy and not willing to take some chances. Which makes me happy. I actually have a lot in common with the other girl - Meredith. She is a friend of a few of the people I went to Hartt in CT with. They weren&rsquo;t my best friends when I was there, but she is cool and they are ok. So we were exchanging stories. I also discovered that I went to Hartt with one of the guys in the cast. I didn&rsquo;t know him well back then, but he was the one who realized it. We both looked at each other and were like, I know you. He firgured it out. :) You know me, I can&rsquo;t remember what happened yesterday anymore!&nbsp;</span></p><p style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; font: normal normal normal 12px/normal Helvetica; min-height: 14px; "">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; font: normal normal normal 12px/normal Helvetica; ""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; "">Anyway, after a little bit of rehearsal, I went to the grocery store. Did I mention we have a MASSIVE KITCHEN??? Yah, we do. So, I went home and was on my own for a bit - yay! I went outside by the lake with my dinner and just sat and relaxed. *sigh* It is so gorgeous here. I promise to post some pics soon. The funny thing is I was just saying how much I need a vacation. And no matter how stressful this all turns out to be...I will enjoy that lake. Just being here makes it all better.</span></p><p style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; font: normal normal normal 12px/normal Helvetica; min-height: 14px; "">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; font: normal normal normal 12px/normal Helvetica; ""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; "">Ok, I am tired. I don&rsquo;t have wireless access here, so that is the downside. I have to steal it when I can, so chances are you will be getting this the day after I write as I tend to write at night when all is said and done. :) And my phone doesn&rsquo;t work in the house, only outside...I know, weir. But it DOES tell me when I have voicemail, so if you want to call me and I don&rsquo;t answer, leave a message and I will get back to you. If I&rsquo;m not at the house, I pretty much have reception everywhere. So, that&rsquo;s good. :) I&rsquo;ll post whenever I can. Catch you all later!</span></p>"

"event","That is what I have been asking myself for the past couple of days.&nbsp; 

As you walk down&nbsp;Rue de Jean Medecin&nbsp;&amp; through Place Messena they are everywhere and very well dressed I&nbsp;might&nbsp;add. But why do all the homeless people have, and Im so not kidding, puppies &amp; bunnies?!?!?! Sometimes both!&nbsp;Maybe they think that the cute animals will help them get more cash? But then how do they afford the food and carriers to keep them eating while on display? Aroo? If you could see me right now, you wouuld probably see a question mark over my head.&nbsp; 

Lets see, where did I leave off?&nbsp; 

Oh yes... Yesterday after having breakfast (yummy croissants!) and posting my previous entry, I ventured out to find the highest point in the city to get a great view. Well, that didnt quite work out... I went in the direction of the hill and got side-tracked somehow and ended up walking alllllll the way around the bottom of the hill. It was hot and sunny, so by the time I got to the steps that I would have had to climb, my feet were like - OH HELL NO!!! lol. It took a looong time to get there. Not that it wasnt worth it. I adore seeing the side streets and such, to me that is where the charm of most cities lies, especially in France. So I got some lovely snapshots, which I will post when I can get my damn laptop to work, hopefully somewhere in &lt;Rome!! Maybe not...&nbsp; 

So I walked by the beach and went to Cours Saleya which is the famous marketplace filled with fresh flowers, fruit, various food stuffs and art. I loved it there. I stopped by one of the fruit vendors and got the biggest nectarines I have ever seen (and the cheapest) and the most delicious. OMG it was like taking a bite of heaven! So, I continued to wander around and decided that I wanted to visit Eze. 

Eze is a medeival village not far from Nice. It is situated on a hill. I took the bus to the village and tried my dandest not to pass out from the clibing. lol. My back was throwing a fit like&nbsp;a 2 year old toddler, demanding attention, but I ignored it. If I didnt, I would be in a world of pain, and I cant give over to that right now, too much to do an see! So, I climbed and wandered my way through the beautiful streets of Eze. The streets are more like pathways, and in every nook and cranny there are tiny stores and cafes to stop and peek in or enjoy something yummilicious while trying to recover from the steps and hills around every corner. There were people finding little shaded spots and picnicing everywhere. That is one of my favorite things about France, there is always somewhere to stop and picnic and enjoy your tme there. ;) I took tons of pictures. Let me tell you how tiny the streets are, the vendors and hotels and people there have to pile everything onto carts and such to try an trek their way through the streets. It is a sight to see, I assure you. There is no way to get a car or anykind of truck up there.&nbsp; 

I found some shade,&nbsp;stopped, had a croissant that I stole from, breakfast (yay for being thrifty!) and had my heavenly nectarine. Seeing what time it was and noticing that the bus schedule was a little odd, I figured I would catch the bus then rather than being stranded there for 2 more hours. I was getting a little tired anyway. I JUST caught the bus after running down the street - lol. It was amusing. And I headed back to my hotel. Thank god for public transportation! The buses and trams here are fantastic and run until very late at night. They arent expensive and are pretty easy to navigate, as long as you have a fairly good sense of direction... which lucky for me, I do... I think. ;) Well, I do most of the time!&nbsp; 

A LITTLE NOTE TO THE ROE - As the bus was driving back towards Nice? I saw a hotel that we all have to stay at some day!! It was called, ""La Fiancee du Pirate"". The fiancee of the pirate. LOL! I thought of all of you. *wink* 

I got back to my hotel and crashed. Have I mentioned how hot it is here? I really hate the heat. I am a 75 degrees and under kind of girl. But it is bearable by the ocean. The breeze is sooooo nice. Plus, with the view, you coudnt possibly be anything but content and relaxed.&nbsp; 

Speaking of being relaxed, I sat there and asked myself why I was killing myself to get places when I should be resting before the hellacious schedule I will be having over the next few weeks. So I decided to skip my trips to Monaco and Cannes and take it easy. I needed to rest. 

With that in mind, I went to the beach. There are these beautiful spots on the promenade that are covered and provide shade about halfway down the coast. By the time you get there, they are much needed. But they have these lovely little benches that are under cover and just outside of the cover, so I sat down, took out my book and soaked in the sun for a bit. It was so beautiful. I absolutely loved it. I ended up just sitting there reading and watching the world go by for a few hours until it started to get dark. 

I heard that the nightlife is the most fun around Cours Saleya so I went back to the hotel, got dolled up and went back out as the sun was setting. Every cafe was abuzz with the crowds of hundreds of people having dinner or a drink. It was a gorgeous evening and I found a little cafe to just sit down and have a drink and take in the surrounding restaurants and cafes and all of the people. I really enjoyed it. ;) Before I went back to the hotel to get some much needed sleep, I went back to the Promenade and walked up and down until I couldnt anymore. There were people on the beach until I was there at about 1000 pm. Beach Volleyball games and people at the hotel bars abounded.&nbsp; 

I love it here. Seriously, it is going to be so hard to leave!!!&nbsp;

So, today I slept in, figuring that I should since it was my last day to do so! I got up and went straight for the place I didnt have energy to go to yesterday. 300 stairs later, I found myself staring at the amazing view of La Cote Dazure. Wow. There were more stairs to climb qs the night before &gt;I noticed that not far from that spot there was a waterfall all lit up. I loooooooove waterfalls. If I could, I would take&nbsp;a whole year out of my life and visit waterfalls all over the world. And I dont count Niagara Falls, I mean Falls in more natural habitats. The waterfall was another couple of hundred stairs up and over. But so worth it. I wish I could describe how beautiful it was up there, but my words would hardly do it justice. It was wonderful to sit there and breathe in the air and get covered by mist when the wind changed. I had gotten some lunch from the market down the street from me and I picniced a little ways down from the falls. It was perfectly quiet and all you could hear were brids singing happily and the sound of the falls. I felt so at peace. That is rare for me! Not a person walked by for about 20 minutes, and considering how touristy it is here, that is pretty amazing.&nbsp;

I finished lunch, trekked my way down and walked down the promenade to my spot fron yesterday afternoon and took in some sun. I need to get&nbsp;a tan. Seriously, I am whiter than white, it is scary. lol!!&nbsp;I met some people from Boston while sitting there. They were robbed right out of their hotel room. But they left the door unlocked while in the pool, so they knew it was their own fault. I felt bad for them. They really werent too worried about it though. 

That is about it. It is currently about 400pm here and I am probably just going to go back to the beach and get some more sun. Ive been neglecting my music so after some packing tonight, I plan on going over my music. Or I may take it with me... I dunno! Hope everything is well for all of you!&nbsp;

I am flying out to Rome tomorrow morning, so this could be my last post for a few days. Im not sure what my internet access will be like out there. If that is the case, hugs n smooches and I will post again as soon as I can!!

MWAH!"

"event","OK, these damn European keyboards r hard as hell to use!! Why cant&nbsp;we all use the same keyboards?!?!

First of all, let&nbsp;me tell u that my first day was not good.

I arrived a little late to the airport and by the time I checked my baggage, the flight&nbsp;was boarding. Blah! I ran through security as fast as I could&nbsp;and ran to my gate. OK. Crisis averted!&nbsp;

The flight&nbsp;wasnt bad at all! Mostly comfy.&nbsp;Not totally full, so there&nbsp;was room to stretch. Turbulence was down to a minimum. But my spine totally hates me now. Apparently it doesnt like sitting for&nbsp;8 hours!! Not that I blame it at all!!&nbsp;

When I finally got off the plane we were in the middle of the airfield. Yup, weirdness. You get off the plane and then take a bus to the airport. It was hottel than the 5th level of hell. Literally! So, I have exactly 20 minutes to get to my connection to Nice. I ran through the airport, stopped to go through mini-customs, stopped to exchange some cash for Euros and got to the gate with time to spare. I boarded another bus and 20 min later, I was on the plane to Nice. I didnt have time to take pics of the airport so you can all see what I mean, but I will when I go back to Rome on Thursday.&nbsp;

I saw the French Alps while flying back to Nice. The peaks were peeking out of the clouds. ;) It was gorgeous. I got to Nice and came to discover that they lost my baggage! Nice!... I mean as in the word not the place. lol! I am so exhausted by now, all I wanna do is get to the hotel and rest for a minute. So I grabbed a cab sans luggage and headed into the city. My cabbie told me that losing luggage happens all of the time and that I would probably get it that afternoon. Which actually did make me feel better.

So, I get to the hotel. And it is lovely. On a an unbeaten path that it right off of a beaten path ) ha. And it isnt far from the beach. Yay! When I got there, they didnt have my room ready and I was told to come back in a few hours. Ok, so I will go check out the scene. They gave me a map and I went for a walk. It is quite lovely around here. And parts are not so lovely. But that is expected. I had tons of time to kill so I found a schmancier part of town and went shopping. No, I didnt buy anything. I was being very good and I am on a really tight budget. But I definitely lusted after a few items. Like Bulgari sunglasses. drool. I am so shallow lol!

I went bck to my hotel and got my room. Yay! I took out my laptop n realized that I cannot use it w/out my power chord and where was that power chord? In my suitcase! Yah, I was having one hell of a day! So I called my mom from the hotel which will cost me an arm and a leg, because my calling card didnt work. At this point I just wanted to pass out from heat exhaustion cuz it is hotter than hell here!!! I left a message for my mom to tell her that I was here n ok n then went to explore somemore.&nbsp;

The beach is gorgeous!!! It was worth the trip just to see it. I took my time walking up and down the Promenade des Anglais which reminds me of CALIFORNIA with its palm trees and such. It was gorgeous. And I did a little more exploring. I really like it here.&nbsp;

I was starting to fade so I hiked back to my hotel, called my mom and then called the airport. They had my luggage and aouuld deliver it later on that night. REJOICE!!! lol. So I fell asleep and was woken when my luggage arrived. I got my stuff out and plugged in my laptop, which will not connect t the internet. sigh...

At that point I was done and decided just to go to sleep. Hopefully today will be better.

I am off to look at the gorgeous view from the highest point and then to the village of Eze and probably Monte Carlo. That is if the heat doesnt kill me first. Yuck!!"

"event","<p>Wow. It has been waaaaay to long! Now that things seem to be moving right along, I think I will be posting here more often about my musical adventures.&nbsp;<br /><br />Let's see... where did we leave off? Ah yes, the Opera Idol competition. How fun that was!!<br /><br />After that, in December, I was back and forth from Boston to New York for many auditions for various companies/programs all over the world. The most exciting news and more relevant to my sigining endeavors is the story about how I will be doing a program with ILAR this summer in Rome! YAY!<br /><br />In December, I met up with my dear friend and fellow mezzo-soprano, Brianne who I was fortunate enough to meet @ BASOTI this summer. She flew in from Wisconsin and we spent two fun-filled days in New York for our various auditions. Our travel plans were insane, so it was a whirlwind of a few days!<br /><br />My audition was the day after we arrived in the Big Apple and it was weird. To convey the craziness and excitement to you all, I will take an entry from my personal journal -&nbsp;<br /><br />""My voice teacher was one of the people listening to the auditions as she is teaching there this summer. Oh, I should probably tell you that this is for a summer program in Rome for all of July.&nbsp;<br /><br />So after their break, I went in. They all looked very very serious, except for my teacher. She was smily but stern. ha ha. I gave them my resume, repetoire list and introduced myself and my first piece. I sang my best aria from Barber of Seville. The one where everyone tells me that I will be doing that role for the rest of my life. It went very well. Not perfect, but under the conditions that I had to sing under, pretty damn well. I was ok with it. :) I didn't get much of a reaction, but there were a few smiles. It is a funny aria after all. After I finished they all began speaking in Italian right in front of me. It is weird to have people talk about you in another language right in front of you. LOL. That was quite an experience. So then they asked me to give them a minute and to step outside. When they asked me back in, my teacher (who was translating) told me that they would like me to do the role of 2nd lady in The magic Flute as well. YAY! I was kind of indifferent, but&nbsp;very&nbsp;gracious and thanked them all in Italian. They were so nice. And then the Maestro who was the most serious-looking out of all of them&nbsp;told Andrea (my teacher) to tell me that if he was doing the Barber of Seville right now He would give me the role tomorrow and I would be on a plane to Italy that same night. Wow. Biggest compliment ever! Of course, I was so tired and overwhelmed that none of this hit me until this weekend! It took several days for it all to settle in. :) Then I realized that the Maestro is the head of the largest Rossini festival in the world and is considered to be an expert in Rossini (who is the composer who wrote Barber of Seville). So, basically the world's biggest expert in Rossini gave me the ultimate compliment. HOLY CRAP!""<br /><br />I would be doing the role and recitals. In addition to that there would be exclusive opportunities to sing for agents in Rome (including La Scala) and composers as well. And it is nationally televised. Then after the performances in Rome we would be going on tour with the opera for 2 weeks all over Italy. It would be reviewed by local media as well. So how can one pass up that opportunity??<br /><br />When I came home, I discovered that my performance of Bertha's aria and the lack of people that they had audition for <em>Rigoletto</em>, has made them decided to do <em>Barber of Seville.</em> Nothing is for certain yet, but I may be doing the role of Bertha as well as the role in the Magic Flute! WHEE!!!&nbsp;<br /><br />This is all very exciting! And I have sent in my contract to be part of the program. It is an experience that I cannot pass up!<br /><br />My voice has also grown a great deal in the past month or so. I've been working very dilligently toward trying to get to where I need to be in the voice. And I am soooo excited for all of the possibilities that the new sound has opened up. My voice has become huge and it is so much fun to work with!!&nbsp;<br /><br />Other than that I am playing the role of ""Leila"" in <em>Iolanthe</em>. Which is a Gilbert &amp; Sullivan Operetta that is being put on by Mass Theatrica and NEGASS in Sudbury, MA on March 9th. It is a sing through/sing along which means that the people in the audience get to sing the choral parts! WHEE!! I hope some of you can make it!&nbsp;<br /><br />After that I may audition for <em>Godspell, </em>but that depends purely on how much memorization I can get through for the Magic Flute and <em>Suor Angelica</em>. Oh, which btw I am doing in September now instead of June. The opera company wanted to market the opera a little more, so they felt it best to change the dates to the end of September. Which is actually kind of a relief. I will have a little less stress this way. :)<br /><br />I am so excited for all of my upcoming opportunities and I promise that I will update more as information becomes available! Hugs n kisses!!</p>"

"event","The Lakes Region Opera Idol Competition was great!

I was so freaked because one of my arias was just not up to par,&nbsp;and I KNEW that they would ask for it, because it is in german and they always ask for the damn german!&nbsp;The sheet&nbsp;that they sent&nbsp;originally said that they would choose the first piece, but when I got there, they said that I was allowed to choose - YAY! So of COURSE I did the&nbsp;piece that I could sing&nbsp;upside down, sideways and diagonally and be so sick that I want to die and still rock it - lol. It is ""Il vecchiotto cerca moglie"" Bertha's aria from Barber of Seville - It went very well.&nbsp;All of the judges got a good chuckle out of it! YAY! I loooove getting reactions, I really find that it helps egg me on and do that much better.&nbsp;So they thanked me and I left. YAY! The only problem was that the accompanist TOTALLY messed up on the 2nd half. He lost his place and could not pick it back up, so I paused for the accompinament where I was supposed to, and when I didn't hear it, I continued. Totally unrattled. I was so proud of myself! It didn't phase me at all. The accompanist was like, you did a cut, and I couldn't follow. And I said, no I didn't. Which I didn't because I've been doing this aria for 2 years and we have NEVER cut anything out of it. It was he who messed up, not me. But whatever. Nothing I could do about it.

At work that afternoon I got a call saying that I was in the semi-finals! EEEE! I was sooooo shocked becuase I heard some of the other singers, and they were truly amazing. The Semis were the next day (Saturday the 3rd) and my time was late in the afternoon. There was a really awful Nor'Easter to drive through, that was not fun. But my mom and I made it. And OF COURSE they asked for the German piece first. (Prince orlofsky's aria from Die Fledermaus)&nbsp;BUT they only wanted the 1st verse, which is great cuz that is the one that I knew! EEEEEEEE! So once I did that, I was like the rest is nothin! They then asked me for ""Must The Winter Come So Soon?"" from Vanessa. Then they asked me for the 1st verse of the aria I sang the day before again. And again, they giggled and laughed and enjoyed it. Then they said ""Ok Giliana, we will see you tomorrow"" To which I said OK THANKS! And then they said ""Giliana, you do realize that we are putting you in the final?"" I said ""No..."" He said - we are! I said thank you! And they all laughed. It was very amusing. So that whole night I was kind of in a state of shock while trying to pick out gowns as the grand finals concert was the next day and is was a full formal affair.&nbsp;

The next day was the Grand Finals concert. There were 15 finalists which were narrowed down from 57 singers. Some were rom new York, you can imagine how shocked I was that I was in the same competition as them. They were very very talented. And most were really nice. Got to know some great people, including some fellow mezzos. :) I went first and they told me the night before that I would be singing my best aria which I did the first day. YAY! It sucks to go first, cuz you get kind of forgotten. But I was glad to get it over with. In the end, I won a contract with the Lakes Region Opera Company for a role in Suor Angelica. I didn't win first prize, but that doesn't matter.&nbsp;

I spoke with one of the judges and he told me that he hoped that I was ready to do that role a gazillion times (Bertha who is the maid in Barber of Seville) as I do it so well and will be doing it for the rest of my life. He said that I need to specialize and find roles such as those and there was no doubt in his mind that I will have no trouble getting continuous work from now on. He also says that he hears Wagner in my future. Right now I am far too young, but he says it is there. He said he loved how I could just take the stage and be larger than life and that my charisma was something that you just can't learn. I was soooo taken aback by all of this. He was very very very blunt with all of the other singers and said don't do this and don't do that to all of them. But to me, he was really nice, very blunt also, but had nothing but good things to say. It was so cool!&nbsp;

So, now I will be performing in Suor Angelica in June. We'll see what happens after that. :)"

"event","This is my last post from San Francisco. WAH! Actually, by the time most of you read this, I will probably already be home. My flight leaves @ 2:10 tomorow and gets in late at night. Weather is not supposed to be happy all across the country, so here's hoping that the turbulence stays at a minimum! I don't do well with turbulence.<br /><br />My last few days here have been great. Thursday night I went to a goodbye party. I stayed out waaay too late. But it was so worth it. Everyone just had a blast and we took over the Bitter End, which is a bar that everyone from BASOTI frequents. I had to wake up early the next day to sing in acting though. So staying out late was not a very good idea. But that is ok! :) Friday morning I woke up and went to acting. When&nbsp;I was warming up, I didn't sound too good. But acting is not so much about the sound as it is about other things. We started with a scene between two sisters, one of which had gotten her ""dream job"" but since their mother was sick, the sister answered a letter for her and she lost the job. Lots of break throughs happened and some walls that had been blocked started to crumble. It was interesting to watch.&nbsp;<br /><br />When it came time for me to go up and do a scene, I was psyched. I love the way this guy works. He gets such amazing results out of people and helps them get to untouched places to portray a role. I sang ""Must the winter come so soon"" which is a melancholy piece that is really beautiful. Katy was in the scene with me and she sang a gorgeous aria from ""Susanna"" about a young girl describing her home and how she wants to get away one day. So the scene that Katy was a young prodigy who was unbelievable at the piano and could also sing. I was her mother, and ever since she was little, I knew that she had a natural talent and tried to get her in with the right people. I was also blind. Oh yay! So my daughter, now 17, came to me and told me that she got into her favorite school. My reaction was to be happy for her, but quietly happy and not really sad, but still melancholy. Holy crap that was hard. So he kept telling me to be still and almost whisper. Then I had to sing my song. It had to be super quiet, which was also difficult. But it felt great. So I told her that I was happy for her after it ended and to tell me what Julliard is like. She then began to sing her aria. She had to act like she was telling me what new york was like she was singing, the song talked about going to the city. So it worked really well. :) But as she was singing, she really blossomed. It was so moving. There was a moment in the aria when it was instrumental and I said ""It sounds beautiful"". Then I began to cry. Not from sadness, but because I had a blindfold on and I could still see what she was talking about in my head. I was crying more from happiness for her than for sadness that I was losing her. It was so intense. What an incredible feeling!&nbsp;<br /><br />Our comments from the teacher and from the audience was that they were so engrossed that they could have let us go on for hours. Wow. He said that I am so charismatic and that this side of me is so enrapturing that I need to try and let things happen than forcing them to. Not that I force things, but this vulnerability and sense of stillness was so moving. So he gave me a new motto and wants me to put it on my desk and all of my mirrors at home - Reveal not Project. He said that my charisma alone is enough to keep people's attention and to just let things happen will be my strongest ability. I wish I could tell you how amazing that all felt. I feel transformed somehow. It is so cool.&nbsp;A couple of us asked him for reccomendations for teachers in New York. He gave&nbsp;us a few names and those of us in the area are going to get together like once a month to go to class. Sounds fun, no?<br /><br />Friday after acting a few of us went to lunch and then I went to Union Square to pick up a few things before packing. I thought I was going to have to buy another suitcase becuase I have sooooo much stuff. But luckily, I have managed to pack all of it up. I'm sure that I'll have to pay overweightcharges,but whatever! That is ok by me. <em>Tartuffe</em> is a weeeeeiiiirrrrdd opera! Funny at times, but pretty weird. The conductor was there for the first evening last night. He wrote it many many many years ago and is a big supporter of BASOTI, so the organization gave him a plaque commemorating the occassion. I think it was like the 25th anniversary of the opera? Not too sure.&nbsp;<br /><br />I went home to pack after the performance, people had a gala to sing in today and I had major packing to do, so we allwent home. This morning, I was able to pack some more up and was able to go to brunch with about 8 others from the program. Afterwards, we all went to the gala for the final scenes program. Then we all went to PIZZA ORGASMICA for one final pizza. We sat in the orgasmica room which has low tables and cushions ot sit on. There were about 25 of us, and sillyness abounded. So, now I am home and finishing up the rest of my packing and trying not to be too upset. ha ha. I had to say goodbye to many today. Many are trying to meet later on tonight, but many are not able to make it. *sigh* So it has been a rough day, but still good! And the sun finally came out today. It has been so cold an dreary this week. Almost like San Francisco is saying - don't go! Which is what everyone was saying on Thursday night - don't go, stay here! I wish I could. this place has grown on my sooo much.&nbsp;<br /><br />But alas, I have to go home. I have obligations to fulfill, but maybe one day I will end up here. :)<br /><br />Ok folks, this is Gils in San Francisco for her final night, signing off and saying GOOD BYE SAN FRANCISCO! I WILL MISS YOU!"

"event","<p>It is Thursday afternoon here on the West Coast and for the past 3 days it has been FREEZING. Colder than it has been so far. Bleh. I was hoping it would be sunny my last week here so I could take pretty pictures. Nope. Doesn't work that way.<br /><br />Tuesday morning I was supposed to go to Acting Class, but my back REALLY hurt and I was up late the night before reading the rest of the new Harry Potter (EEK!). I couldn't get my act together to go to class. So I slept in. That was my last day for it. *sigh* Back to early mornings until my next day off from work. blah! I got up and had lunch and decided to go to Chinatown - loved it! I had tea at a tea tasting bar, got myself a silk kimono and bought a new huge tiara for the PRINCIPESSA! WHEEE!! I love the tiara, and it was not expensive. To get to chinatown, I took a cable car. It was windy and cold, but well worth it. Cable cars are awesome. Cuz let me tell you, climbing these hills SUUUUCKS! And it doesn't matter what kind of shape you are in, it NEVER gets easier.&nbsp;Anyway, chinatown = fun. I took a bunch of pictures which I will post later.&nbsp;I also went to Clarion Music Center which has really funky instruments. Got some ankle bells for the act. <br /><br />Because I was so close to Union Square, I decided to go there and check out Loehmann's which has great designer things for a fraction of the price. I found a few things that I like, but didn't get anything. I was a good girl. :) So, once again I went on a quest for Versace, this time with a map in hand. It wasn't there. They must have gone out of business here in the Bay Area. *sniff sniff* But I went to Juicy and a few other places to make myself feel better - tee hee! Then I went home. I was exhausted, so I just stayed in.&nbsp;<br /><br />Wednesday, I got up for acting. The class was AMAZING. It was conducted by Bobby Wineapple who is just INCREDIBLE. He gets people to do things that you would never think they are capable of doing. He asked me to sing first since he hadn't seen/heard me yet and had already worked with everyone in the class (not many people had shown up). So I did Berta's aria and he chuckled and then said to me. Giliana, what do you want to be when you grow up? Everyone giggled. So I said, in my cutest voice - I wanna be an opera singer! So he said, right, and how big are opera houses? I said, anywhere from 200-3,000 people! He said - exactly! So, I want you to make this bigger. I want you to go crazy and just make it ridiculous and over the top. So I said ok. He told me to keep that in mind and sit down. Then he asked the guys in the class what they brought to sing. One (who is a bit of a drama queen and a baby) said that he just wanted to watch and didn't really want to sing. The second, Ian, brought a comic aria as well. So Bobby had him sing through it and then he had us set up an improv scene. Ian is a Jack from Will &amp; Grace-like character who is famous and lives in Hollywood. The other guy, Joe, was playing a Sylvester Stallone-like action hero who is also famous, but is gay. And if anyone finds out, it would ruin his career. He &amp; Ian are in love. And me? I'm a fag-hag who is hired to be on Joe's arm. I fall in love with Ian and we have one night together, but he is now denying it. So, I become crazed and threaten to go to the press.&nbsp;<br /><br />The scene starts and Joe is not into it. Ian come running in and starts to try to explain what is happening to Joe. I come running in about a minute later and start flipping out. So, the scene excalates and I have to go crazy to try and make IAN love me. The director is shouting directions to us as the scenes go on. So he says, preted that you are going to kill yourself. I grab a pillow and pretend to smother myself, when they both don't notice (after being very dramatic and almost dying), I run @ Ian, throw myself on the floor and grab his leg. I don't let go and he drags me all over the floor - and then his aria starts. I'm still holding onto him and screaming. lol!! The people who are watching are DYING at this point. Everyone is laughing so hard that they are literally falling off their chairs and can't breathe. It was sooo funny. Then Ian finishes his aria and I have to grab onto him and try to threaten Joe. Then I hear my music. So, at this point, I have to be like homicidal. So I take the pillow and hit it threateningly towards the two of them. And then I do my aria while threatening them. The director keeps telling me that I have to go bigger and do more. So by then end, I'm in the middle of the stage, singing my high notes and then I fall into a heap on the floor with my hair wild and all over the place. It was amazing and fun and crazy and it felt great! I loved it!! There was another scene with a couple of people after us that made us all cry. But I won't tell you about that one. It is really depressing.<br /><br />After class a whole bunch of us went for lunch. It was great to spend time with some of these people. I haven't seen most of them as they were all in other scenes and operas and we haven't had times that overlap. After lunch, I went to see the famous ""painted ladies"" - the row of victorian houses up on Alamo Square. It was so foggy and so cold that the view of the city wasn't great, but I did some good shots of the houses. :) After walking the hill, I went to say goodbye to Fisherman's wharf. I went to Ghiradelli Square for some souvenirs and then I went to Lori's Diner for dinner. It is a cool 50s themed diner that is all over the city. Very fun place and good food! So, I walked around the wharf for a bit and pier 39 and tried to find the ""crookedest street"" which I did see, but it was late so I couldn't get a good picture. The street is crooked because it was so steep that you have to drive on it from side to side in order to go down. Scary! Since it was getting darker and colder, I went home.<br /><br />Today I went to acting class again. It was fantastic! Didn't get to do much today, I mostly watched, but he is writing a scene for me for tomorrow. YAY! After class a few of us went to help one of the girls find a gown for the final gala this weekend. They have a formal event at the Legion of Honor every year here and it is pretty much black tie. This girl didn't have a dress and was pretty clueless, so we went to the Jessica McClintock Outlet. DRESSES GALORE and for less than $30!! It was insane! But so fun. So now I am resting a bit and trying to start packing. Tonight I have to introduce some of the girls to the wonder that is MAC makeup and then we are all going to a local bar because one of the guys is leaving tomorrow to go home. So the first of the final parties has begun. :) Tomorrow I have class and then I have to go to Union Square to pick some things up and also to Haight Ashbury to visit the hippies. lol. <em>Tartuffe</em> is the final opera here and it starts tomorrow night. So I am heading to that. Saturday early afternoon is the Gala which we are all required to go to and then Saturday night is another of the final goodbye parties. lol. The final final goodbye is on Sunday when I am not here. So Sunday late morning I head to the airport and fly home. *sigh*<br /><br />It feels weird that I have to pack everything already. *sigh* But that is ok. My memories will keep me going for a looong time and there is so much waiting for me @ home! :)</p>"

"event","Tonight I went to a masterclass that was a big waste of time. The master who was giving the class didn't say much that I agree with. But that is ok, it happens. I didn't sing - thank god! But those that did were not very happy. Afterwards, a bunch of us went to Pizza Orgasmica. Yes, the pizza is that good. lol. And we were all sharing stories of how we enjoyed the program and what we've gotten out of it. Then we all started going into our histories and how we ended up there. <br /><br />There was this one girl who is a little awkward there. She is sooo sweet, and I really really like her. She is a composer and has only recently discovered the world of opera. Mostly self-trained as a mezzo-soprano, she is very cool and doesn't have any music background except for being part of a chorus or two. We were all talking about how we see ourselves and if we actually think if we have what it takes to make it. She had seen me this weekend in <em>Silla</em> and told me that she loved my performance as God and she also saw me in some scenes as her scenes were the same night. She was like, how could you think that you aren't meant for this? I said how we are all our own worst ciritcs and explained my history. She told me that she thinks that I am amazing and how she loves my voice. I said thank you. And she looked at me and said - can I give you a weird compliment? I said - sure!&nbsp;<br /><br />She asked me if I knew who Linda Rondstat was. I was like - of course! Everyone else at the table also replied the same thing. She is great - of course we know who she is!! :) So she went on about how she and her mom were really close friends and have been since they were young. She told us stories about how she would come to the house. Someone didn't believe her, so she was like, WAIT! I think I have a picture. So, she pulled out a picture, sure enough, there she was with her sister, her mom and Linda Rondstat.COOLNESS! So, then we all got the shock of our lives when she said that Linda came to the scenes programs that she was in with her mom. WHAT??? Linda Rondstat was within 15 feet of us and we didn't know?!?!?! AHHH! So she said, yah, she was. And let me tell you that she had a lot to say about you Giliana. I was drinking at the time and had to spit out my drink to not choke on it? I almost dropped my glass of water and said ""Excuse me?"" She said - yah, she said that you seemed very sweet and that you had a beautiful voice. She also said that you were charismatic and that she thought that you have a very bright future.&nbsp;""Are you serious?"" I said. Yes, I am,she said. Totally nonchalantly!&nbsp;She said, so don't you dare say that you aren't meant for this.<br /><br />OH. MY. GOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />Friggin Linda Rondstat thinks that I am good??? This cannot be real! This has to be a lie or something. HOLY CRAP! I've never felt more honored in my life. I was in complete SHOCK. Words... there were no words!<br /><br />So, now that the initial shock of it has worn off. Let me tell you about how the weekend went. Friday we had one last dress rehearsal in the afternoon. Whoever had that idea is not cool in my book. It was very difficult. When we all should have been resting, we were having dress rehearsal and working our asses off. Ah, the theater. Gotta love it.&nbsp;<br /><br />The performance went REALLY well. It was my silent role night. We opened to a packed house with standing room only. The audience LOVED the opera. It turned out to be very funny actually. When I came on stage with my dorky glasses and waiter-like outfit, people laughed their asses off. Especially the ones that knew me. Everyone afterward said that I stole the show. And it wasn't intentional. It wasn't meant to be funny. Well, not really. But it was - lol. There was only one little hitch in the whole night, which was not noticeable to the audience, so that is fine. :) After the opera, we hada champagne reception in the hall to celebrate the US premiere of the opera. Everyone was decked out in gowns and jewels and it was quite the shindig. I was approached by the artisitc director and her husband who said - wow Gliana. That was perfect, it wasn't overwhelming, it was just the right amount. You didn't take away from the scene but you made your presence known. This really showed off your acting ability. To which I replied - Thanks! I guess I should not sing more often! They all laughed heartily at that.&nbsp;<br /><br />The next day was my day to be GOD! YAY! I slept a litle late and went to be supportive to some of my colleagues, they had a scenes program that day. It was really good. Some I was entirely unimpressed with, but there were a few people that were fabulous. They also did a one act opera that was originally composed by mozart about the craziness of the opera business. Basically about 2 feuding sopranos. It has since been translated to english many many times and is just hilarious. We all laughed our asses off. I was glad that I got to see it.&nbsp;<br /><br />Just a few short hours later, I was in makeup and ready to be GOD. lol. I didn't get as many laughs as Nick did. He has this natural ability to be silly. And he really hammed the GOD thing up. It is hard to describe. But it was a riot. I was more look at me, I am god - love me worship me and I am pretty and regal. Naturally. ;) The aria didn't go as well as I'd hoped. Well, in my opinion anyway. Everyone else did a great job. There was one little mishap with one of the sopranos, she came in a little early and off key, but hey, it happens!&nbsp;<br /><br />Afterwards, we again had champagne and again the opera was REALLY well received. Compliments abounded for everyone involved. Me? I gots tons, which I really didn't expect. I wish I could explain to you how challenging this aria was for me. I was a little nervous about what people would say. I got nothing but THat was fantatics! OR Wow, Giliana! Some of my colleagues came to all three performances and approachd me and said - ya know, I thought you did a much better job than Nick. They said that they loved him, but he almost took away from the opera. He didn't play it regally, he played it like a ham. And they all liked my aproach more. I got a big hug and a kiss from the aritistic director and her husband. They were thrilled with my performance. It was really shocking.&nbsp;<br /><br />I've just had shocks left and right! It has been quite a few days! Sunday also went really well. I was so done with everything already though. lol. After we struck the set, we were supposed to have a cast party. We did, but not many people showed up. It was fun, but short lived. Eh, my parties are always better anyway. lol. We go ALL out when we throw parties, these people have NO Idea how to throw a party like me! ha ha!<br /><br />Anywho, less than a week to go and I will be home. WEIRDNESS! I am looking forward to hearing about everyone's adventures over the summer and have lots more of my own to tell!&nbsp;"

"event","I was suddenly woken by a very large boom and felt the house shake for 1/2 a second. Thinking oh, it was that stupid motorcycle that always wakes me up at night, I went to sleep. My street sometimes has loud noises. I've gotten pretty used to them.

So, I'm at my final dress rehearsal before tonight's opening(yes, it does suck to have dress the same day as a show!), and everyone is talking about something that happened this morning.

Yes my friends, I have survived my first earthquake. 

EEEEK! Scariness. Not at all what I expected. It literally felt like a bomb went off outside or something. It was loud and very fast. Not scary cuz it didn't last long. But now that I know what it is, I'm surprised. Thank god it wasn't worse. The epicenter wasn't actually in the city, so it wasn't as bad here, but one of my colleaguse told me that the center was by his house and it happens often. NO THANK YOU! I've had one earthquake, now I don't want anymore!

"event","Literally! My costume is partly gold lame! LMAO! I am playing god and i have a cape - and it is fantastic! LOL!

We open tomorrow night (Friday, July 20). Yay! I play a silent role tomorrow and Sunday and then I play God on Saturday.

Tuesday's rehearsal was fairly simple. I didn't have to sing. Yay. It was our first night with the orchestra, so it was a ROUGH night. Monday was also a little rough. It was my second time doing the aria with staging and the first on stage. The Artistic Director and her husband (one of the conductors) were there to see us. They left almost right after my aria, but before they went, they gave me a few insights. Mathias (the conductor of <em>Cosi</em>) was very very concerned that the aria was being taken way to fast and insisted on telling Jennifer, our conductor for <em>Silla</em>. He is a great guy and really wants to see us all succeed. So, it was good to hear from him. Syvia was telling me to sing through things, which I totally agree with. But the day she heard me was not a good one. I had so much crap in my throat from getting over the damn cold I had, that is was sort of preventing me from getting the sount out. Plus, the aria is kind of hard and I was stil sooo tentative on it. Which is what my director told me that same evening. Yes, I said, I know and I promised it would be fine by today.

Wednesday was a fun day for me. I went to do some shopping on Fillmore St. the day before because I had saved some extra cash and nothing makes me feel better than shoppin! LOL! So, I went to MAC for some makeup because I was almost out of some things. Had a BLAST there and got my new PRO ID card which gives me 30% off - can you say it with me? EEEEEE! lol. Then I walked into Marc Jacobs. YUMMEH! I got myself a quilted silver vinyl tote - which surprisingy did NOT cost me a great deal. And I got various blingy things for my hair. :) I never thought that I would like Marc Jacobs, but I guess I do. :) I met this RANDOM guy there from the Big Island in Hawaii. Every other word out of his mouth was ""rad"" and he was so typical surfer that I wanted to giggle profusely! It was quite amusing. Anyway, back to wednesday... I had to pick something up for the show so I had to find a specific store. Only one in this area was across town. So, I thought, great, I'll take the bus. NOT a good idea. I got off the bus and was in the worst part of town imaginable. OI! I was like - ok, gonna get mugged. Not good at all. I had to walk about 5 blocks to get to where I was going. I almost passed it. And teh funny thing was that it was in this random place that was really really nice and schmancy! Weirdness!

On the way back to the bus, I heard my phone beep. Thinking it was my mom, I caled my voicemail. I had spoken to her earlier as it was the anniversary of a very very good friend's death and we were remembering her fondly. So, I thought maybe she wanted to say something else. I press 1 to hear my messages... and hear the dulcet tones of a tenor voice. :) It was Eli singing ""Un aura amarosa"" from <em>Cosi! EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!</em> I was grinning like a GEEK! It was fantastic! I was so excited that I almost knocked someone over on the side walk. lol!!! BTW - if you want to hear him/see him sing it you can go to -  <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39zcFvJe41I"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39zcFvJe41I</a> it doesn't really do him justice. The live version is waaaaay better - but you can get the idea. I just adore him for doing that. He is the bestest! This kid is so unbelievably talented and still so young. I can't praise him enough. :) I'm not easily impressed, which is why I can't stop raving. Tee hee.

So anyway, that night I had a dress rehearsal before my final dress on thursday. It went well. Not too bad. I was much less tentative. But unfortunately, I had a bit of a breakdown. One of the other sopranos came up to me and said What is that high note that you sing in the aria? I told her and she said ""I wouldn't sing that if I had to do all of that blocking"". It was basically her way of telling me that it sucked. Normally, that wouldn't bother me, but I have moments when I feel a little insignificant compared to other singers and those little self-doubt moments come around randomly. This was one of those moments. So, after I while, I broke down. Cried a little. Hey, it happens to all of us. Everyone in the cast had one, now it was my turn - ha ha! But everyone who saw me (I try to avoid people seeing me in those situations) was pissed at that girl for saying that. They all said you should listen to no one but the conductor and director and even then they can be wrong. I know that, and I was fine. Just a moment of weakness. Being exhuasted can do that to you. :) But now I am good and I am totally ready to take on the world! :) That night my conductor came up to me and said - I have no notes for you! But let me kiss you cuz that was right on! :) Needless to say, I felt a lot better!

Tonight was my final dress to sing in. And it went well. Not perfectly, but I think that if your dress rehearsal sucks, your show goes well. Old theater superstition. :) So, it wasn't perfect, but my ornaments were totally on and I was psyched. A couple of my fellow colleagues wanted to hear and watch to prove that girl wrong and they were all like - I don't know what the hell she was talking about! I feel so much better about the whole opera and I feel like I am ready. YAY! Bring it on! Time to shine! :)

Well, that is all for now folks. If you have time - keep you fingers crossed for me on Saturday night @ around 11:30 pm Eastern Time! HUGGLES!"

"event","<p>For some reason my computer has decided to say that today is Wednesday the 18th. I actually believed it for a while. I am so confused.&nbsp;<br /><br />Let me tell you that having a major role in an opera takes every single ounce of energy that one could possibly possess!! I didn't think that I could be as tired as I was yesterday. i am serious! We ran through the opera once with one cast, and then ran through the opera a second time with another. There are 3 different casts. But to run through it 2 times in a 5 hour period is just deadly. I could barely keep my eyes open at the end of the night. And then we had to sit around and wait for notes, which took forever.&nbsp;<br /><br />At home I averaged about 4-5 hours a night of sleep. Here, I need to get at least 8-9 or I am pooped! My teacher used to tell me that you have to rest a great deal before a performance. I never really thought about it, but it is really true. No wonder people put themselves on vocal rest and take a few days off before performing. Sheesh!!<br /><br />Sunday was a busy day. I had a loooooong day with rehearsal @ 12:00-5:00 and then the last show for <em>Cosi</em>&nbsp;@ 8:00. The show went well. But I somehow ended up with only 1 character shoe. lol! Don't know how that happened. So I had to do the show barefoot. ha ha! This stuff only happens to me. It is quite amusing. That night was an interesting one to say the least. After the show, we all went to Mel's diner to grab some dinner and to decompress. If you know anything about theater, decompression is absolutely necessary! That is why we party afterwards. ;) It was fun. I got to spend some time outside of rehearsals with my fellow cast -mates which was great! They are a hilarious group of people! I was out a little too late though. I had to sing the next day, so I left at about 1:00am. Luckily, there was a bus right next to the diner and the driver was grabbing coffee, so I ran to the bus and hopped on. It was only a few stops to my street&nbsp;- yay!<br /><br />Staying out that late was probably not a very good idea though. It is probably why I was 1/2 dead yesterday. I did get to sleep late, but I stil didn't feel rested. Note to self: Don't do that when you have to sing the next day! It was worth it though. All kinds of memories were made that night!&nbsp;<br /><br />So Monday I had rehearsal @ 3:30pm. I ran some errands and went to S<em>illa</em> at the Conservatory. I love that the conservatory is only about 6-7 stops by bus. So much easier than going to the school on the other side of town. It was tough day for everyone. There were a lot of de-railments and a lot of breakdowns. They are all so stressed.&nbsp;I had a really fascinating conversation with some of the other members of the cast. They all hate BASOTI with a passion. Most of them have only been doing <em>Silla </em>and nothing else. While I have loved every moment of the program. I mean, I see why they hate it. They have a difficult director and a difficult conductor. They are all so stressed that you can see it in every move they make. None of them are having any fun. And ya know, if you don't enjoy it, the audience won't either. And that is the worst thing that can happen. It is awful and just a shame. I know that the reason I am having fun is becuase the people in my scenes and in Cosi are amazing and they are all so supportive, while in <em>Silla</em> they are kind of cut-throat and not very supportive. It is like night and day. I feel bad for them, but at the same time, I don't. You have to take what you can and learn what you can from these things. If people tried to see it in a different light, they might enjoy it more. But then again, my background is so different. I have been through hell. These people really haven't. So, I came with a different attitude. I mean, I also came into this about 1/2 way through, so I haven't seen as much as they have, but I think I am fairly perceptive. Ya know?<br /><br />Anyway, rehearsal tonight from 5-10. Then tomorrow and the next day and then I have rehearsal all day on friday and a show friday, saturday and sunday - then I am done. And one week after that - I come home. EEK! Kinda scary. Don't know what it is going to be like to be thrown back into life. But I'm sure I will be fine. ;) I always am.<br /></p>"

"event","<p>Woke up today to my phone ringing @ about 5:00am! WHAT? It was a number from home. Probably a wrong number, even if it wasn't - it is a 3 hour time difference! ARGH! <br /><br />I got to rehearsal at 11:00 only to find out that am rehearsal was cancelled and no one thought to call me- thanks people! Didn't have enough time to go back to my place before the scenes programs started, and I wanted to be supportive and watch the scenes, so I stuck around BASOTI all morning. I helped in the office and went out for Dim Sum. Ah dim sum - how I shall miss you when I go home! <br /><br />The program was good, but I had to go to <em>Silla</em> rehearsal from 4-7 which was before the program ended. Darnit. My call for <em>Cosi</em> was at 7:00 as well, now how I am supposed to be there in a flash when it take at least a 1/2 an hour from BASOTI to the Conservatory where we are performing is beyond me. Not to mention,my stuff was all at my apartment because I hadn't anticipated this change of scheduling. So, yah, little stressful. We had a full runthrough of <em>Silla</em> for the first time. Didn't go too badly. I still don't have this stuff under my belt completely, but I will by the time we have to perform it on Friday. :) <br /><br /><em>Cosi</em> went very well. Our first performance, and it went off without a hitch. It was bittersweet as there are 2 casts and 2 nights. The tenor who I adore - Eli, only sang tonight, so I only got to hear him sing one last time tonight. *sigh* He is fantastic. :) Fame written all over him. And yes, I know that I said that before, but it is true! And the aria I am talking about is very famous and one of the most beautiful tenor arias ever written. It is called ""Un aura amarosa"" from <em>Cosi fan Tutte</em>. Listen to it - it is gorgeous! <br /><br />Anyway, tomorrow I have rehearsal and then a show again. No rest for the wicked!

I got to take the morning and afternoon off and sleep in and roam the city a little. I went to have a manicure (which was crappy - but what do you expect for $8??). Of course most of the people having manicures were men. Only in San Francisco. ;)&nbsp;One of the guys asked me where I was from and what I was doing there. I answered Boston and that I was an opera singer... that is when it hit me. Now, I really am an opera singer. Sure, I've said that before, but it didn't really hold such a special meaning before. I wasn't doing as much as I am now. What a great feeling. It makes me smile everytime I think about it.&nbsp;<br /><br />So, after my brief conversation about what I was doing there, I asked the gentleman where there was a good place to get a sandwich around here. I've been able to explore the city a great deal, but not as much in my immediate area. There are restaurants everywhere around where I am, but nothing like a deli. So, he told me to walk a couple of blocks over which is where I found Miller's East Coast Delicatessen. YUMMEH!!! Their sandwiches are a lot like Carnegie Deli in New York. Not as amazing, or as huge. But quite good! If ever any of you come out here, come on out to Clay &amp; Polk to find the deli! :)&nbsp;<br /><br />Thursday night's rehearsal was ok. We're all getting a little weary. But the chorus was given a special nod. Everyone was asked to stand and give us applause for all of our hard work. It was very kind of them. We all felt a little better.<br /><br />Today was a good day! I woke up early in the am as I had to go to my coaching for <em>Silla</em>. What a GORGEOUS day!! Not a cloud in the sky, which is so rare around here. lol. It was warm and lovely. I got to the school early because I needed to warm up and attempt to get all of this <em>Silla</em> stuff under my belt. I felt ok with it, but I wanted to be a little more confident in some of the ornamentations. When I got there, I found out that I was supposed to sing in Aria Class. Oops. I didn't know. I only had 1/2 an hour from when Aria Class started to when I went to my coaching, so I asked one of the girls if she had a Soprano Rep book with her. She only had one aria in her book that I knew. So I sang ""The Black Swan"" from ""The Medium"". One of my favorite arias. But seeing as how I am still a little sick and it was 10:00am, it wasn't my best work. But, I did get some great insight. Patricia Craig, who is from New England Conservatory (NEC) in Boston was giving the class. She gave me some suggestions about breath support. And then she asked me about my background, which I told her. She then asked me if they allowed me to sing big repertoire @ Hartt. Which basically means, did they allow me to sing repertoire that was written for big voices. Which they didn't. She then went on to describe to the class how if they reign in a big voice when it is younger, it makes it very difficult to make it big again. Which is exactly what I have been working towards for the past few years. It has been a long rough road, but my teacher is wonderful and has helped me through it slowly, and the right way. She asked me who my teacher was and she replied that I was in excellent hands. All very true and well observed.&nbsp;<br /><br />I ran to my coaching right after. It was fantastic! My conductor hasn't heard me sing the aria yet and she had written the great ornamentations for me without hearing what I could do. But I told her that I would try anything, just couldn't guarantee that it would work. But she loved my attitude. She said that they could use more people like me in the cast. With all of the drama going on, people haven't exactly been cooperative. So, I sang it, and she got sooo excited! She said she couldn't understand why they hadn't given me a bigger role when I am so good at Handel. She said she really wished that they had given me the role of one of the sopranos. I was flabbergasted! (oh&nbsp;- good word!) I was truly shocked to hear that. But ecstatic at the same time.&nbsp;<br /><br />I had <em>Silla</em> rehearsal the whole rest of the day. I did a lot of staging for my silent role. There is a lot of running around required. Definitely got my work out for the day! The director then worked with me on the staging for my aria. We had to change it a little as my ornamentations are different from Nick's and the rythm's didn't really work with the footwork. So, we worked and worked and worked on it until I finally got comfortable with both the aria and the staging. Thank god I had that extra time because tech week starts on Monday! EEK!&nbsp;<br /><br />It was a really good day. <em>Cosi</em> dress rehearsal also went well and we actually got out a little earlier than planned - yay! Have I mentioned one of the tenors in <em>Cosi</em>? I am NOT a fan of tenors. Don't know why, I'm just not a fan of their voice type, but Eli - he can make anyone melt with his voice. He is simply fantastic and was born for stardom. I mean, he has it written all over him. And is also quite humble and the sweetest person you could meet. I wish you could hear him. For all of you opera buffs out there who are reading this, remember the name Eleazar Rodriguez - you WILL hear of him someday! He is wonderful!<br /><br />Anyway, here it is. The night before opening for <em>Cosi</em> and I am still happy. I keep thinking that one of these days I am going to just say&nbsp;- I hate this and want to go home. But those feelings never come, no matter what - I love this. And I know that this is what I am meant to do. </p>"

"event","I had forgotten how it can be in the ""real world"" or in this case. The real singing world. It is late Wednesday night and I have just come back from a crappy rehearsal for <em>Cosi fan Tutte.</em> I am in the chorus for this opera, which is good because it keeps you humble. At least that is what I keep telling myself. The chorus also serves as the set crew. So we are in full costume and running around doing set changes. Some while we are singing. It sucks. I don't like it, none of us do. We've been able to be silly and laugh things off, but today, we were treated like crap, and we were all crabby for the remainder of the 4 hours of rehearsal. Blargh!&nbsp;<br /><br />This only came after I had a rough rehearsal for <em>Silla.</em> I haven't sung the full aria with accompaniment or anything since the day after I heard it for the first time. And I didn't have much time to run it. So, needless to say, it doesn't sound that great. It downright sucked. And with me being sick and never having done the staging, made it suck even more! They were very nice and understanding, but that is only going to last this one time, next week is tech week and we have to have it perfect. I just felt bad and unprofessional. They weren't rude or demeaning about it at all, but I am hard on myself and felt bad about the whole situation. But that is ok. I needed a kick in the butt to make sure that I learn what I need to and practice. The main issue is that my ornamentations for the second part of the aria are different than Nick's, and not in the same rythm. That presents a huuuge challenge. I can do it, just really have to work on it as much as possible. Which I will!<br /><br />Monday my mom was here for her last day. We went to Fisherman's Wharf where we found Lark in The Morning. It is a huge musical instrument store here in Frisco. We took a cable car from my mom's place and went all the way down to the wharf. I bought a concertina for our ren faire groups. I am psyched! Always wanted to learn to play one. And it wasn't that expensive. I was planning to spend much more. So that was great! After playing with every instrument in the store, mom &amp; I went for lunch @ Boudin's Bakery. They are famous for their sourdough. Their New England Clam Chowder in a bread bowl is the most delicious thing I have EVER had. I had one when I first got here and have been raving about them to my mom ever since. We both giggled at the irony of eating new england clam chowder while in california. ;)&nbsp;We also hit this amazing pirate store. Had EVERYTHING piratical that you can think of. Super pricey though, so we didn't get that much. The ROE girls would lurrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrvvvvvvvveee this store!!!<br /><br />It was getting close to time for my mom to go. So we went back to Union Square and hit Macy's on the way to the hotel. I went a little crazy. Their large designer departments are RIDICULOUS! I got some awesome clothes. Whee! Yes, I know, you are all saying, Gils, the last thing you need is clothes. And yes, you are right. But we don't have this kind of stuff @ home. So that is a good reason right? *wink wink*<br /><br />By the time my mom had to leave I was kind of regretting that I did all of that walking in the wind and cold. It wasn't that bad, but I was just getting really sick and I probably shouldn't have gone anywhere that day. But that is ok. I am doing all right and I think I am finally getting over this damn cold! Echinacea and vitamin c are my bestest friends!<br /><br />My first rehearsal at the Conservatory here was on Monday night after my mom left. Thankfully, it is only a few stops away on a bus for me. So not a bad trip at all! The first rehearsal was ok. We were all still bright eyed and bushy tailed. But as the days past, we are getting a little more annoyed and exhausted by everything that we have to do. Tuesday we had a 10 hour rehearsal. And that was after Nick &amp; I had to go to Silla first. That was a looooooong day. We were all pretty bored and bummed by the end of the night. 10 hours of rehearsal is kinda crazy. But thankfully, we had an hour and 1/2 for dinner when we were replenished by the lcal crepe house. :) Yummy crepes with nutella!!!<br /><br />Well, other than being tired and a little bummed/pissed off. There is nothing much else to report. I almost wanted to go home today. Just cuz I feel like I have been doing this same opera for like a year! I'm not kidding. I feel like we have done it over and over and over. And we really haven't. But there is only so many times that we can rehearse things before we all get cranky, ya know? It'll be over soon and the next level of hell will start.<br /><br />I'm still hapy though. I love this program and the people in it. I am so blessed to have this opportunity. And I am taking every chance that I have to get what I can out of it. So far so good. I only have a few more weeks left and they are going to just fly by.<br /><br />Hope all is well with all of you. I can't wait to hear the stories that you all have to tell when I get back. Hugs until then!"

"event","Has it been that long since I have updated??<br /><br />I believe the last time that I updated was...Monday?? Yah, that is about right. Let me see if I can remember what has happened since then... Tuesday wasn't super exciting. I had a series of rehearsals, including a last minute call for Silla rehearsal. This new opera is making my schedule a mess, but that is ok. I wasn't planning on going in until about 3:00 that afternoon because my first rehearsal wasn't until then and I wanted to sleep as late as possible. But I got a call at about 1:00pm (while getting ready to get lunch) saying... Ummm...Gils? Yah. I have some bad news for you. What? Did you know that you have rehearsal right now? Umm...no, I do? Yes. Ok, well I will be there in 25-30 minutes then. Nick (the other person paying God - yes that is the character that I play!) didn't know that he had rehearsal either, and he comes in from Oakland, so he was late too. But the director was, thankfully, very understanding. It seems as though as well as playing a major role on 2 nights, I will be playing a silent (but extremely huge) role of a servant the other 2 nights. I love silent roles, they save your voice and often times you are on stage more with a silent role than you are with a singing role. It is great! Good deal for me!<br /><br />Tuesday night we had our first staging rehearsal for <em>Cosi</em>. Oh the fun! It was fantastic! A lot of us that are in it together have also been in classes and other rehearsals together, so we are all buddy-buddy. And seeing as how it was night and we were all kind sleepy, we started getting slap happy and were giggling up a storm. Not so much to be distracting to the others, but still enough to be crazy. We are all looking forward to the performances as we all get to spend lots of extra time just being silly.<br /><br />There was also a party being thrown that same night by one of the girls who lives here. She knows a lot of local singers and her roomie is the accompanist for a very very prestigious young artist program here, so everyone was planning to go over to her house as it was the only night when we could all sleep in the next day. I wasn't planning on going but I was persuaded by a few of the folks and almost pushed into the car. ha ha! On the way there I had another San Francisco moment. We were driving down Fillmore Street and all of a sudden we couldn't see over the car. MAJOR drop down the hill. It was scary as hell. We were all like EEEK! lol. It was a priceless moment. So, we got to the party at about 10:00 and nobody from our program had shown up yet. So, we made ourselves at home and began to ""take over"" the party. :) Would all expect any less? Slowly, the rest of the troops came trickling in. It was an ok party. I wasn't feeling too festive because I didn't feel dressed for a party. I didn't look atrocious, but I wasn't in my ""party clothes"" so I felt out of my element a little. And can I just say that I still find it really really hard to be comfortable hanging out and partying with my conductors or directors??? I mean, no, I don't drink or anything, so maybe that makes it weirder. But I just can't get used to the idea! It is soooo strange! They jus saunter on up to you and strike up a normal conversation when earlier that same day, they were yelling at you for something. Just teaches you that you can't take anything personally, I guess. I ended up leaving the party a little earlier than most. Fun, but just wasn't feeling it. Thankfully, it was pretty close to where I am staying. <br /><br />Got to sleep in on July 4th! That gave me 2 days of sleeping in. Thank god! Had to stock up on sleep seeing as how my schedule was going to get crazier and longer, especially over the weekend. I decided that I wanted to catch a movie. Unfortunately, Pirates 3 wasn't playing nearby. WAH!! Still haven't seen it, just never got a chance what with the performing and the packing and the working... anyway, I saw ""Ratatuoille"" instead. It was very cute. But in my opinion, totally over-hyped!! I found it funny and cute, but personally, I prefer ""Cars"". It definitely had it's moments. Especially since it was based in Paris.&nbsp;Loved the moments when I could be like ""OH! I know where that is - I was there!"" Of course it is Pixar so everything in it was witty and wonderful. :)<br /><br />After the movie, I had a few hours to practice my new role until I had a party to go to. A couple of BASOTI folks are sub-letting an apartment in the Richmond District, which is definitely not the prettiest part of town. It isn't unsafe, just not much to look at. So, I went out there and when I had to switch buses, I had to wait for 45 minutes! That SUUUUUUUCKED! It wasn't super cold that day, but it was really really really windy. I got a little worried for a while, the buses usually run pretty much on time here. I was suprised how good they were. But not&nbsp;on this day.&nbsp;I hate holiday bus schedules, they say it is going to be one thing, but you actually have to add about 20-30 minutes on to the scedule. BLAH! When I finally got on, I had to get off a little earlier cuz of an accident up ahead that was blocking the road, so I had to walk many blocks, uphill. Thought it would be closer, it wasn't. Eh, no big, I don't really mind walking. When I finally got there, not many people were there. And the vibe was a little strange. I got the feeling that there would be drama somewhere very soon. It wasn't bad. Not really my scene. I stayed for a few hours and socialized. But ultimately, I ended up leaving when people got more intoxiacted. I'm not too keen on being around drunk people. Which I had to endure the whole way home! BLECH! I had to wait forever, again for another bus and it was so packed full of drunked crazy people, that I got off and just started walking. lol. Just didn't want to deal with it. Though, I must say, I looked fabulous! ;)<br /><br />When I finally got dropped off at the top of my hill, I was just in time to watch the fireworks over by Firsherman's Wharf. It was a great view! Just a block away from where I'm staying! The fireworks show was great. I am such a kid. I love fireworks! Though, let me tell you, no one does the 4th of July like Boston!! We are famous for our show @ the Esplanade and our fireworks. And for good reason! Go Boston! ;)<br /><br />Thursday I got to sleep again! 3 days in a row?? WHEE! My mom was also expected to fly in @ about 12:45pm. YAY! As I was walking to my rehearsal, she called and let me know that she got here safely. Our family friend Vito was kindly picking her up and taking her around the city for a few days with his wife. I told her that if I could get out early enough that night, I would try to come and see her. Luckily, my rehearsal ended early and I got to spend about 45 minutes with her before I had to go to dress rehearsal for my first peformance of <em>The Tempest</em> on Friday night. Unfortunatley, I got out super late and though my mom came over for a bit to see my apartment, she was exhausted from jet laggishness and couldn't stay long. So, no hanging out with mom until Saturday.&nbsp;Of course it was just my luck that it got much colder than expected that night and I had to wait for a few buses as I thought I would be going to my mom's hotel. So, standing there in the freezing wind. Not a good idea.<br /><br />The next morning, I woke up, my throat was KILLING me. OWIE! I was going to go to my ""Business of Singing"" class, but I could not drag my butt out of bed. I felt awful. Luckily, I only had one other rehearsal that day and my call for the performance that night wasn't until 7:00. So, I called in and just stayed in bed all day. Thankfully, my throat pain was high enough that it didn't effect my voice. I swear, there is someone up there looking over me. I would have been SCREWED! I took echinacea all day long and vitamins and got soup and tea as much as I could. It sucks not having a microwave or something to heat food in/on. That would've been helpful in this situation. I sucked it up and went to the show. It went very very well. And I was so glad! The problem, I had another dress rehearsal then next morning. Ugh!&nbsp;<br /><br />Who the hell thought of forcing us to be warmed up, in makeup and costume by 9:30am needs to be shot! My cold had fully set upon me and my throat was still hurting. I was in a PANIC. So, I vocalized a little before I left my room to go to dress rehearsal. It didn't sound too bad and the pain was still sitting pretty high. The first scene was actually really good. My conductor was hard on us, once again, and even though I was sick as a dog, he made us go through some things outside in the cold. Thanks John! I was not happy. The rest of the rehearsal also went very well. I was really surprised that I could get anything out at all! By the time we were done, it was 1:00pm and I was dizzy. I found my director for Silla and asked Nick if he could stand in and just tell me what I missed later. It is a blessing to have double casting! Nick &amp; Meghan spent about 10 minutes convincing me that I needed to eat something to feel better. So they dragged me to everyone's favorite local pizza place&nbsp;- Pizza Orgasmica. Yes, that is the name of the place. LOL! And yes, the pizza is that good. They specialize in all kinds of different flavored gourmet pizzas. Yummeh!&nbsp;<br /><br />I was released from my captors after lunch and allowed to go home to see my mom. ;) She came over to my apartment because it was freezing and I just didn't want to make the trek to her hotel. I was able to just hang out with my mom and do nothing all day. It was nice actually. But kinda weird. She kept saying that it was strange being there. Our family friends had to go back home (not far from here) on Saturday morning. They were so sweet to take her around and show her things. She got to go to Fisherman's Wharf &amp; Pier 39. They also took her to Sausalito and she shopped in Union Square. So she was glad to have a little down time.&nbsp;<br /><br />Today (sunday) was my 2nd performance. And thanks to Bailey's Irish Cream which I sipped several times yesterday, my sore throat was gone. YEARS of blowing my voice out @ Ren Faires has taught me that Bailey's is my best friend! Not a ton, just a sip or two. It is great! Thank you Bailey's! LOL! I should do commercials for them. So, with a horrible cold left over, I got up, got ready and went to the show. Forgot my camera - oops, went back to the room. Then about 3/4of the way there, I realized that I had forgotten one of my costume pieces. CRAP!!! So, I hopped on another bus (after almost getting hit by a car while crossing the street) and went back to grab it. I figured, hey I will try to get a cab and if I can't I will take the bus again. Whichever comes first. Got the bus. And got there with time to spare. I was doing&nbsp;my makeup on the bus on the way to try and save time. I kept getting all of these looks from the passengers. One woman looked over at me and said ""why are you putting so much make up on?"" Of course, I had to be polite and tell her that it was stage makeup. Ah, the stories one hears on a bus. he he.<br /><br />However, it seems that everyone who was in the program was trying to warm up at the same time, so&nbsp;I was running around trying to find a place to warm up. Just ended up doing it in the makeup room in front of everyone. Hey, I don't care, I need to warm up, I'm in the first scene. That was interesting to say the least. When you warm up, you don't exactly sound pretty at first. But it taught me not to worry about it. When you have to get ready, you have to get ready! It was really weird though. Somehow I managed to sing everything well. It wasn't bad at all. I was pleasantly surprised. Getting enough breath support when you are completely congested isn't easy. But you have to get through it as best you can. We got lots of laughs and lots of applause and everyone enjoyed the performance. The last scene was the worst for me. My makeup was not agreeing with me at all. It was kind of painted on, and my eyes had the worst reaction to it. I started tearing up and then it started stinging. Owie. And then I was so teary that I just couldn't see. So, I went on like nothing was happening. My eyes were watering so badly that I looked like I was crying. My colleagues were all freaking out afterwards cuz they thought I was actually crying. lol. I wasn't. The makeup didn't get all over my face, which I was worried about. It didn't run all over the place. If it had, I would've looked like death. Thank god it didn't!!<br /><br />My mom took me to a 3 star restaurant to celebrate. We had delicious food from famous chef Michael Mina. Not the best food ever. But it was fun to see how people who live the high life eat. It was like a movie. :)&nbsp;<br /><br />Ok, so now I think we are all caught up. Tomorrow is my mom's last day here and we are going to Lark in the morning. It is a very famous music store that has thousands of different instruments. I want a concertina for the ren faire stuff. Yes, I am a dork. But I love it. :)<br /><br />Oh, and&nbsp;one more story to tell. Something that I will never forget - my rehearsals for <em>The Tempest</em>. Our conductor had the best accent ever! And at one part, the goddeses (I was Juno - the highest of all godesses"") had to sing ""Honor, Riches, marriage blessing"". He used to tell us how to say riches in rythm. But when he said it with the accent, it sounded like ""Reeches"" We love him! He was great. Could be very serious but very fun at the same time. And Hector Correa was the best director that I have ever worked with! I will never forget them and am so thankful that I got to work with them!!<br /><br />"

"event","<p>Yesterday was Friday. It was a rough day. We staged the rest of <em>Merry Wives </em>first thing in the am. It was a little crazy. The conductor wants us to sing a particularly difficult part in another way and it is already challenging enough without it being changed. So we struggled with it and everyone got a little exasperated. I got more exasperated than anyone else really, but it was just hard. Everyone gets a little annoyed with themselves in the entertainment world, it is normal. I just hate it when things don't go all that well. But, it'll be fine. :)<br /><br />I went to get fitted for the rest of my costumes right after with some of the girls. I of course was recruited to tie some people into corsets and the like. Hey, 7 years of Ren Faires gives me major corset-tying experience! I am a pro. :) The costumer is ecstatic to have a fellow rennie around. She does some of the faires around here sometimes. She is a doll, I really liked her. And luckily, the pieces that I brought with me to wear work really well with her designs, so I get to use some of my own stuff - whee!<br /><br />My second rehearsal of the day felt kind of endless, but we got a ton done. It was very prodcutive. I am singing in an Aria Afternoon tomorrow and the piece I am doing is rare and difficult. Luckily, the pianist for the rehearsal I had is also the one playing for me tomorrow, so we got to run it a few times. THANK GOD. I was a little nervous about it. Now I am at ease. :)<br /><br />Thankfully, that was the last rehearsal of the day, so I got to go home for a bit and try to rest myself. All of these rehearsals are increasing in numbers and length, so my exhaustified meter is getting higher. But I am still loving this!! I had a great moment in San Francisco yesterday when I was on the bus. On my side of the hill it was bright and sunny and on the other, the fog was starting to blow in. And as I was looking down one side of the hill, I could see the fog blowing in over the sunny part of the lowest part of the hill. It was sooooo amazingly cool to watch. I almost wished that I had gotten off the bus and just stood there to watch the fog blow in. It was like a movie where the fog rolls in slowly. Awesome. Yes, I know I am a sappy weirdo - ;) but I really enjoyed watching it. It was like a moment of relaxation before a night of german art songs. lol.<br /><br />So, I went to the ""Liederabend"" which taken literally means - Songs Night in German. :) It is a night where everyone sings German (or other language) art songs. It was actually lovely. Some of the pieces were not appealing at all, but most of them were very nice. During the intermission, Sylvia approached me and asked me for a moment of my time. I freaked! I thought that I had done something wrong! OH CRAP! So, I followed her preparing myself to hear something awful, and was surprised when she asked if I learn quickly. I said, absolutely, I pride myself on being a quick study. She said, oh good! There is a role available in Silla, would you like it? I said, sure, I would love to do the role. So she told me a little about it and asked me to meet her after the concert ended. EEK!&nbsp; So, I met with her and we went to get a score from the office, they didn't have any left, so I had to wait until today for a copy. It was 9:30 at night, don't think I would've really had a chance to look at it anyway considering I can't sight read for anything and I don't play piano well. Not to mention, I don't have a keyboard or anything with me!&nbsp;<br /><br />I was asked to join many of my fellow colleagues to a local haunt that they all go to after a performance. It was crazy. I ended up having a drink with one of my conductors - weird! But still fun. A lot of the people I didn't really know yet as they aren't in anything that I am doing, but most of them remember me from all of my crazy energy from the first day and from my sneezing at the pants role master class the other night. ;) So, I was a big hit. It was actually really fun. It is great to be in a position where no one has any preconceived notions of you and can form their own opinions. And it is nice to be accepted into a group with similar lives. So many of my friends don't really understand the whole performing thing. And admittedly, it is hard to understand. But these people are all in the same positions and totally get the kind of life that we are asked to lead. It was also interesting to hear some of their stories and great to just unwind a little bit. :) I didn't stay too long, I wanted to head back to my room cuz it takes the bus a little longer at night.<br /><br />Had an interesting experience on the bus. I swear some day I am going to write a book about my bus experiences. This guy comes onthe bus and keeps yelling (to an invisible person) I'm a veteran! I'm gonna call em! You betcha! You betcha! I'm gonna call em! LOL. I swear, this city has more crazy people than anywhere else! And then this morning, this woman on my bus on the way to rehearsal was telling everyone where they need to stand and how to sit and how we have to respect the older people on the bus. It was completely unecessary and just plain annoying. People were starting to get pissed off with her.&nbsp;<br /><br />So, I thought that in a few days, I would be called into rehearsal after I learned the role a little more. BOY was I wrong. I got a call at about 10:00 this morning. I was still sleeping and had not planned to wake up until about 10:45-11:00. But no, I got a call from Miriam asking me if I could come in for a staging rehearsal this morning. Ummm..ok I said, when is it? It started about 10 minutes ago. Uhhh.... ok, I will get there as soon as I can, I have to take a bus. Thank you! Don't worry, they know that you don't have the music yet and don't let them push you around, ok? Well, that last part wasn't fun to hear. So, I drag myself out of bed, and try to make myself semi-presentable. I managed to get out of the room in about 10-15 minutes and luckily caught a bus right away, so I was able to get there fairly early. I am playing ""God"" in the opera. Is this a typecasting thing? I am playing the highest of all of the goddesses in <em>The Tempest</em> as well. lol.<br /><br />I sat in on rehearsal and had to go through the staging myself as well. Now, having never heard any of this music and never hearing of this opera, it was all a&nbsp;little overwhelming. And it is Handel which is super hard! I was supposed to be at another rehearsal from 1-5 and then another in between from 2-3. But I had to go to Silla from 1-2 and then went to the other from 2-3 and then went to the other from 3-5. So in between, I had to find 2 of my directors to talk to them about this schedule and try to listen to the conductor for this new opera and try to take in all of the staging. So, I guess it is normal that my head kind of hurts and I feel a little numb huh?&nbsp;<br /><br />The cool thing about this is that this is a big deal to be asked to do this. It means that I have been noticed and they have watched my progress over the past 2 weeks. I am really honored to be given this opportunity. This is also the United States Premiere of this opera. There has never been a public performance of it as well, so it is a really big deal. So, basically, this is pretty amazing and crazy and great at the same time. I am excited. But it is all a little difficult. The role is written in a strange key, so the conductor is re-writing it to fit my voice. It is double cast so I can't learn what the other person is singing. This whole thing is pretty confusing. And I'm sure I'm not making a whole lot of sense right now. I am confused myself. ha ha.&nbsp;<br /><br />But suffice it to say, I am happy and so fortunate to have this opportunity!! Until we blog again...</p>"

"event","It is Thursday night in San Francisco and I have just returned from having dinner with a few friends who came to visit me on their way to their own summer program in Losa Angeles. YAY! I got to spend some time with Sanjay and his bf Collin. It was great seeing someone from home. :) Sanjay is an AMAZING tenor for those of you who don't know and is going to Operaworks in LA for the month of July. It is an excellent program!! <br /><br />So, the past few days have been very very busy. Wednesday I had many rehearsals and got home a little later. I had Alexander Technique in the morning, which I wasn't supposed to have, but I went because I have a rehearsal during that class on Friday. So I skipped acting and went there instead. Out numbers in classes have dwindled exceedingly as many people are having later rehearsals and more of them, so we are all starting to kind of drag ourselves around. I had my first staging rehearsal for <em>The Tempest. </em>It was great! Working with the director was better than I thought it would be. He is so fantastic. He basically makes you find the character and the motivations and it is just a joy to work with someone who lets you be creative. I loved it! And now that&nbsp;it has been staged, it all makes so much more sense to all of us and is really coming together well.&nbsp;<br /><br />Then there was&nbsp;a ""Pants Role Masterclass"" where all of us girls got to learn how to be men! LOL! For those of you who are not familiar with opera many women,&nbsp;especially Mezzo Sopranos, play men in an opera. So, the masterclass was great for all of us who are totally clueless. It was...interesting to say the least. Basically, we started by having all of the men (who were required to be there to help us along) stand to the side and all of the women got to feel their hands, shoulders and rib cage. Yah, GREAT way to get to know your fellow colleagues! HA! No way you can be shy in this business! But it was actually really nteresting. We had to learn how to walk like them and there was an exercise where we had to enter the room, see a rose on the table, go to it and smell it and leave. Most women were apathetic to it and didn't like the way the rose smelled - lol. Me? I sneezed. And everyone fell off their chairs from laughter. And then we had to practice running and hugging. Which was also quite amusing. I was fortunate enough to be partnered with one of the men in my classes and I just love him. So we had a lot of fun making fun of each other the whole time. Before the end of the class though, I felt awful. I hadn't slept very well the night before, so that and my new found anemia made me feel very weak and rather than pass out in front of the whole company, I figured it was best to go home and try to sleep.&nbsp;<br /><br />Today (thursday) was also very very busy. I had aria class this morning which was sort of laid back because most people didn't show up and there were only a few singers. So we had a chance to ask more questions and talk with each other about arias and auditions and things. We also got some excellent insight from our accompanist&nbsp;- who I ADORE!!! He is fantastic and you can just tell that he loves what he does when he plays. That is so rare. I had a wonderful conversation with him on the bus to class the other day. We were talking about how we feel that it is almost impossible not to have passion for the music that we perform and how difficult it is to try and understand how people cannot emote what they are singing. I mean, how can you stand there and just sing and do nothing? I can't even imagine doing that!&nbsp;<br /><br />So, after aria class I had a quick break for lunch and then had rehearsal for <em>The Tempest. </em>It was good. Us goddesses were having a bit of a hard time as we sort of feel like we are just stading there. And one of the girls was a little lost cuz she didn't really know what to do. And they weren't very happy. But I was thrilled. I mean the director is pretty open to interpretation and I have worked with directors who don't allow you to do anything!! So this is like nothing for me! I love it! Most of you remember how much I hated the last musical I did and how horrible the director was!! I guess that I am lucky that I have had the past experiences to appreciate this one. :)<br /><br />I finished with rehearsal a little early and had a little time in between to talk to some people at home - yay!!! Then I had a final staging rehearsal for <em>The Magic Flute</em>. We are done with staging! YAY! Though, our Tamino really needs some help. The director wants him to act a certain way (well, the opera actually calls for this as well) and it makes perfect sense! He has to be frightened by something that is attacking him, and the poor kid is just clueless. He just can't act. It is terrible. But he is trying, and the director is really good at getting things out of people. I just hope it happens soon, we go up in a week! So, that rehearsal was a little bit rough. We had some moments where the director got really frustrated with us, but that is ok, it happens to all of us.&nbsp;<br /><br />So, finally, I was done with rehearsal and I went to dinner with Sanjay &amp; Collin. On the way home from dinner - I saw a huuuuge line of people camped out in front of the apple store. I think it is for the new Iphone?? Lame! The phone is not that important. Some people just have nothing better to do with their lives!&nbsp;<br /><br />Well my dears, I hope to post again soon. My schedule is getting more hectic and I am getting a little more fatagued, but that is ok. I still love every moment and am having a blast! Until we blog again..."

"event","""The coldest winter I ever spent was a summer in San Francisco."" 

An he ain't lyin'!! Today (tuesday) it was *bleep*ing cold!!!! BRRRR!!! The last couple of days it was so gorgeous and warm and nice. Not hot, but  warmer than usual. :) So we weren't really expecting this. It was cool though, where I am it was sunny and breezy and then on the other side of the bay, it was thickly fogged and again *bleep*ing cold. Weirdness, but cool cuz you could see a hill in the distance that was covered with fog while you are standing in the sun. :)

Today, I had class early and then I didn't have a rehearsal until later. I loooooove my audition class. It was great. I sang an aria and really didn't get much feedback which is both good and bad. You don't want to be critiqued on something that you have worked so hard to perfect, but at the same time, you want to fix what is wrong and you want some suggestions. I had one main suggestion that was sort of minor. But I learned soooo much from watching other people's auditions. It was fascinating. And our teacher is actually directing one of my pieces which makes me happy. He is a really well-known Shakespearean actor and my scene is based on <em>The Tempest. </em>So I'm looking forward to that. A bunch of us went out to lunch. I'm glad that I am getting to spend time with different people each day. I am learning so much from them. Ok, I am gonna stop saying that, I am getting so repetetive!

I didn't have rehearsal until about 7:00pm so after I filled one of the girls in on the staging for one of the scenes she missed, I went home. Thank god for being on 2 major thoroughfare roads! The buses come super fast and frequently so I get home fairly quickly. My first staging rehearsal for <em>The Merry Wives of Windsor</em> was fantastic! This opera<font size=""2""> is gonna be hilarious! I am so psyched. The director is really brilliant. He is also directing <em>Die Zauberflote</em> so I get to work with him a great deal. I really like the way he directs. He gives you like a bare bones description of what he's going for and then fills things in as we go along. And the end result is fabulously funny! We were all cracking ourselves up. Love those moments.

Anywho, I didn't have a whole lot of time to post over the past few days and I am gonna have a little less time. As we get closer to performance dates, our rehearsals increase and get longer. Eek. So I am trying to get as much sleep as possible. Lately I've been getting a lot of sleep so that is good, but soon the sleep will stop. As is typical for any performer. *sigh* I like sleep. Sleep is good. :)

Ok, so here is the 411 on what has happened on the past few days and some pictures! Enjoy!</font>

  
<p style=""FONT-SIZE: 10pt; MARGIN: 0in; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"">Sunday was fairly uneventful. I felt a little yucky, and had a hard time getting up out of bed. Just one of those days, ya know? So, I slept late and went to rehearsal around noon. I was running a little late so I had to high-tail it there. Eek. Didn't have time to warm up. That was not a pleasant experience. For all of you non-singers, for a singer to sound good, we have to warm up our voices by doing vocal exercises like scales. You wouldn't run 26 miles without warming up your muscles, right? Same thing for singers. :)</p>
<p style=""FONT-SIZE: 10pt; MARGIN: 0in; FONT-FAMILY: Arial""> </p>
<p style=""FONT-SIZE: 10pt; MARGIN: 0in; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"">We had our first staging rehearsal for <span style=""FONT-STYLE: italic"">Die Zauberflote. </span>It wasn't horrible, but one of our girls was out for a wedding and the other didn't know we had rehearsal. There was a bit of a scheduling snafu. The schedule is run a little strangely and every night we have to call a hotline for changes. They hadn't put the new schedule up when we were there the day before and it wasn't on the hotline. The only reason I knew about it was because I had lunch with one of the girls the day before. Thank god she caught it or we all would have been in serious *bleep*. But, it was ok, it went well and one of the girls showed up about 1/2 way through. Eh, these things happen.</p>
<p style=""FONT-SIZE: 10pt; MARGIN: 0in; FONT-FAMILY: Arial""> </p>
<p style=""FONT-SIZE: 10pt; MARGIN: 0in; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"">We all had to attend a Masterclass after rehearsal. It was great. Some of the people who sang had unbelievable breakthroughs under the direction of Sylvia, the Artistic Director of the program who was giving the class. One of those people was Lauren Woody who was my old teacher's student. Her voice was GINORMOUS! HUUUGE voice and simply beautiful. She is going to go so far becuase she takes direction well and is very easy to work with. It was incredible to watch the changes that happened in both the characterization and the actual sound quality that was coming from this girl. So cool! I love things like that. It kind of humanizes us a little. Some singers seem so untouchable and so amazing that they don't need help, but these people did and wanted it. And even though most of them were incredible, they all had these little things that really needed work, and those little things made such a huuuge difference when they were fixed. I love those moments.</p>
<p style=""FONT-SIZE: 10pt; MARGIN: 0in; FONT-FAMILY: Arial""> </p>
<p style=""FONT-SIZE: 10pt; MARGIN: 0in; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"">So, after the masterclass, we were all invited to a pizza party provided by the program. GREAT PIZZA! And it was nice to hang out with some of the other people not singing with me but are in other things. I also got to speak to one of my conductors for a while, he mentioned how they were impressed how much I have progressed since they heard me the first time a few months ago. It was quite an honor to hear those words come from him. He is an amazing conductor and has an unbelievable passion for music. People like that are so rare. He is very good to his singers, which is even more rare. Then it was time to go home and rest and get ready for the week. But not before I found out that Monday was a free day. What? Nice!</p>
<p style=""FONT-SIZE: 10pt; MARGIN: 0in; FONT-FAMILY: Arial""> </p>
<p style=""FONT-SIZE: 10pt; MARGIN: 0in; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"">So, Monday, I got to sleep late again - yay! We had a free day which means no rehearsals! WHEE! I decided that I wanted to take a nice long walk. It has been lovely weather and today was probably they warmest that it has been so far. Ok, so still a little chilly, not exactly bikini weather, but still gorgeous out. So, I headed for the Marina to get a view of the famous Golden Gate Bridge. I got off the bus and had to walk a couple of blocks and saw it. It is so cool. I was fairly far away, so I figured, hey I feel like walking and the walk along the beach was about a mile and 1/2. Why not? So, I went to Chrissy Field Park and walked the mile and 1/2 to Fort Point which was right under the bridge. The walk was beautiful. Got some sun (and have the suburn to prove it - owie!) and the wind wasn't that bad. I walked to a small pier near the bridge where you can get great shots of the bridge, alcatraz and the city. THAT was cold. The wind picked up a great deal. It was just a little way out on the water, but geez, the wind. </p>
<p style=""FONT-SIZE: 10pt; MARGIN: 0in; FONT-FAMILY: Arial""> </p>
<p style=""FONT-SIZE: 10pt; MARGIN: 0in; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"">So, I finally got to the bridge. It is certainly something to behold. I will post pictures at the end of this entry so you can all see. I was hoping that maybe I could take a bus or something and I wouldn't have to walk back, but alas, I am not that lucky. So, I turned around and walked back. I thought I would be exhausted, but I wasn't, the walk was still quite pleasant. :) When I got back to Chrissy Field Park, I stopped at a little cafe they had there and got something to snack on, I wasn't really hungry, just wanted something to hold me over. Then I started to walk back to where I knew the bus was. On the way back, I was curious to see what this huge dome that I saw earlier was. And I found what is my favorite spot that I have seen so far. The Palace of Fine Arts, a huge dome-like structure that is built likea roman structure. It is huge and gorgeous! There is a large pond with the biggest koi I have ever seen and duckies and geese! Oh yes, and swans (hence the title of this entry)! It was just lovely and in a really nice part of town. Lots of people come here to relax by the water on the grass and marvel at the structure or read or enjoy the duckies. :) I love it there and have to go back one day when I need to just relax. :) </p>
<p style=""FONT-SIZE: 10pt; MARGIN: 0in; FONT-FAMILY: Arial""> </p>
<p style=""FONT-SIZE: 10pt; MARGIN: 0in; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"">By now of course, I was exhausted, so I had to get back and rest. Thankfully, my place isn't very far away. I am in a centrally located place and I have 2 major bus lines that run everywhere (well, there are more bus lines, but the 2 big ones are the most important). </p>
<p style=""FONT-SIZE: 10pt; MARGIN: 0in; FONT-FAMILY: Arial""> </p>
<p style=""FONT-SIZE: 10pt; MARGIN: 0in; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"">My back is starting to hurt again. This isn't making things easy. I am trying to just be strong and keep doing my exercises, but that sciatica is starting to be a little more persistent. I think it is the bed that I am sleeping in. It isn't exactly new and improved. Ah, well, not everything can go well, right? Something's gotta give, I guess. It isn't that bad, I just don't want it to get any worse.</p>
<p style=""FONT-SIZE: 10pt; MARGIN: 0in; FONT-FAMILY: Arial""> </p>

"event","One week down. It has gone by sooooo quickly! And at the same time I feel like I have been here for a long time.&nbsp;I don't miss home at all. I guess that is cuz I am so friggin busy! But I'm glad, I hate being home sick.&nbsp;<br /><br />Yesterday was pretty uneventful. I got to sleep in! Say it with me now - YAY!!!!!!! I couldn't sleep too late because there was all kinds of noise going on around the hotel, but that is ok. I got about 10 hours of sleep which is fantastic! I went to a 1:00 rehearsal and then I had a 3:30 rehearsal so I got to spend some time with my colleagues in between. We mostly ran through things and had fun just talking. Yesterday it was beautiful outside, as is today. Not too much wind and little to no fog, which is surprising for these parts. :) After rehearsal, I was pretty tired cuz they worked us pretty hard. I have to say that I am sooooo glad that I am so well-prepared and knew everything before I got here. There are a few people who are really really struggling to get their stuff together. I am not one of them! I think I probably would be having a melt-down about now if I didn't know my pieces. Thank god I have a teacher and a coach who are both supportive and know when to push me to do things! Admittedly, I waited until the last minute to really do things, but I am still better prepared than most of the other people here.<br /><br />Today was a fun day. I had rehearsal @ 10:00am instead of a class today. Singing @ 10:00am is NOT fun. You have to get up waaay too early for anyone to be up and have to sound fabulous. Ew. Not me. I don't sound fabulous that early in the morning. I was surprised that I didn't sound worse though. They had me scheduled for 2 rehearsals at the same time - ummm... unless I remember incorrectly, I am only one Gils - not 2! So, I had to split the time between the two, one for one hour, the other for another. <em>The Tempest</em> is the most challenging. Contemporary music is so friggin hard cuz the composers of our time are both brilliant and COMPLETELY OFF THEIR ROCKERS! lol. But it is really gorgeous and actually coming along quite nicely. Considering that we have 2 weeks until show time, things are really going well.&nbsp;<br /><br />We all went out for lunch afterwards to Chinese food. Did you all know that out here, chinese food is all worded differently? Like Peking Dumplings (or ravioli) are pot stickers (kinda) and Chow Mein is actually lo mein. Weirdness. It was fun trying to figure out which is which - lol. After lunch, I went shoppin!!!!! Yes, we all know this is not a good thing! But I was good girl! I swear!!&nbsp;<br /><br />I went to Union Square. I walked it as I didn't think it was THAT far away, and it isn't really, but by the time I got there, I was already pooped. ;) Union Square is where ALLLLL of the shopping is. Among the shops are Juicy Couture (whee!), Christian Dior, H&amp;M, DSW and the biggest Macy's in the world. I tried to find Sephora and my beloved Versace, but I couldn't find it!!! Alas, alack! I was so bummed. But I guess it is just an excuse for me to go there at the end of the trip and be all extravagant. ;) Ok, ok,&nbsp;I won't buy anything, but a girl can drool over things can't she??? I went into Macy's and bought a cute little top. The fact that I fit into a NORMAL person's size was the coolest moment - EVER!! I was very happy and bouncing in the dressing room. Yay weight loss. I want to lose at least another 10 while I am here. I think it'll happen. For some reason, EVERYWHERE you go here is uphill, even when you should be going downhill - lol. I'm not kidding. It is messed up! Oh, anyway, shopping. So I also got some stuff @ H&amp;M. Love that place! But I was sooo friggin exhausted from all of the walking uphill that I had to go home.<br /><br />Oh, also weird/interesting. It is gay Pride weekend here. (That isn't the weird part.) Seeing as how this is the hub for the gay/lesbian world, they really make a huuuge deal out of it here. It is actually very cool.&nbsp;But unfortunatley in this world that we live in, where there are gay people, there are anti-gay people. So, in the middle of union square (where there were a few anti-war protesters yelling unintelligible crap over a bullhorn) there was a christian group singing things trying to bring peopleback to Jesus. Now, I don't have a problem with religion at all. I am catholic, but my own version of it really, but these people freak me out. Ya know come back to jesus and say no to gay people and all of that; I'm not saying that they are wrong, everyone has a right to their beliefs. I just really hate it when people try to force those beliefs on you. Like&nbsp;throwing it in your face and trying to attack you with it. Ok, before this gets too serious, I am going to switch subjects....<br /><br />So,here I am, chillin and relaxin all cool... Ok, babbling again. Have I been repeating myself alot on these posts? I don't usually have time to go back and read them, so I don't know if I've said things more than once. I hope that you all enjoy reading these posts. I actually really enjoy doing this. It is kind fun and this way I get to go back and read these memories when I am famous and go... ah Gils, what a dork you were. Even though we all know that I will always be a dork. ;)<br /><br />I have tomorrow morning off. We get some days or 1/2 days off sometimes, which everyone really needs. Tomorrow I was only supposed to attend a masterclass, but now I also have rehearsal at 2:00. Blah. Was hoping I would have more time to explore, but c'est la vie.&nbsp;<br /><br />Till we blog again my friends. Hugs to you all!"

"event","Today was also of the good. My acting class wasn't great. But that is ok. They can't all be good, right? It just wasn't great or effective. Then we all had a company meeting to discuss scheduling concerns. It has been really rough on people. Some of us have had rehearsals from 10-12, 1-5 then 6-10 every night so far. And in order to sing @ 10:00am, you have to get up ay 7:30am at the latest to sing effectively. So, yah, rough. No one ever said that these programs would be easy. Luckily, I don't have rehearsal all day right now, but I will later on on, probably in about a week. So, some people expressed their concerns. Not much can be done for that. And in a professional company, you have 12 hour rehearsals sometimes. So basically, they said suck it up. But in a much much nicer way. :)<br /><br />I had rehearsal for <em>Merry Wives</em> at 4:00, so I had some time to kill in between. I got to meet and greet many many more of my fellow singers in the common area and actually had a lot of fun sharing stories with them and experiences. Some of these people are just great. It is so cool to be in a place where everyone has things in common with you. And to be immersed into your art is such a blessing. I know I keep saying that, but I am so thankful. I really am.<br /><br />My rehearsal was great. Not perfect, obviously, but still good. The conductor gave me a lot to work with. He is one of those conductors that you really enjoy working with. Very precise in what he wants, but allows the singer to take some risks, which is encouraging and lots of fun. So, when I did something right, he would smile and looked as if he was enjoying what he did. There is another girl who also sings my role (it was double cast) and she has a gorgeous voice. It is completely different from mine. She sang everything very smoothly and flowy and that is not what the piece is supposed to be. It is kind of bouncy and light, funny and silly. I love that scene. So the conductor was getting a little agitated with her because she kept ""beautifying"" things. lol. It is interesting to hear how different people approach things and how different people's voices can be. You can learn so much by listening how other people do things.&nbsp;<br /><br />So, another day down and almost one whole week with 5 more weeks to go. I feel like I have been here much longer. But not. Does that make sense? lol.<br /><br />Anyway, have a good day and hopefully I will be able to post tomorrow. I get to sleep in tomorrow! YAY!!! <br /><br /><br />And can I just say that I love that John Cusack is now doing voice-overs for Volkswagen!!"

I woke up feeling a little crap voice-wise. I was a little strained and my back was sore. I had a class in Alexander Technique in the morning. For those of you who don't know what it is, Alexander Technique is the process of being aware of everything around you and being really in the moment and aware of your body. It is very cool. Hard to contemplate, but very cool. We started with how we stand and how we balance. IT is amazing how if you put weight on certain parts of your lower body, your upper body reacts and your voice reacts as well. The correct way to stand is physically straight all the way up, that way you are all aligned and your voice is open and you are able to breathe and move more freely. The difference is incredible. You had to be very comfortable with yourself and we got to know our fellow class members really really really well. There was a lot of touching going on. Now, before you get the wrong idea - as I know most of you would - ha ha. We had to wake up some of our muscles in our backs and our necks, so a partner had to put pressure on certain parts of your back to wake them up. It was actually really interesting to feel the difference. And what we all think is upright and the correct way to stand is not necessarily correct. We all have a tendency to over arch and lean back and in fact, we have to lean forward a bit to be perfectly aligned. You almost feel like you are going to fall over, but you won't. And the difference in the sound when you sing is so incredible!</p><br /><p style=""FONT-SIZE: 11pt; MARGIN: 0in; FONT-FAMILY: Calibri"">&nbsp;</p><br /><p style=""FONT-SIZE: 9pt; MARGIN: 0in; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"">So, after class a few of the girls in The Tempest got together to rehearse cuz it is ridiculously hard. So, we went through some of the scene as we didn't have all of us. It was ok, the girls in the chorus were the most nervous as they hadn't really gone over there parts. There is like no known recording anywhere so no one had anything to listen to. Afterwards, a bunch of us went to grab lunch at a nearby diner. The school where our classes and rehearsals are is at a catholic school and isn't far from japantown which is also not far from Golden Gate Park. So there are a ton of cafes and places to grab food or drinks. It was fun. Got to know some of them much better. Some of them have similar stories. Some are totally different. It is a cool group of people.</p><br /><p style=""FONT-SIZE: 11pt; MARGIN: 0in; FONT-FAMILY: Calibri"">&nbsp;</p><br /><p style=""FONT-SIZE: 9pt; MARGIN: 0in; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"">I didn't have another rehearsal until 7:00pm so I went back to my room to rest for a bit and continue to memorize my music. I actually did get to memorize some of it. My <span style=""FONT-STYLE: italic"">Cosi</span> rehearsal went very very well. It was short, but good, and then I had to leave and go to my <span style=""FONT-STYLE: italic"">Tempes t </span>rehearsal. That unfortunately was not so good. I was sooooo strained and dried out by then. I didn't sound good at all. But unfortunately, I can't be perfect all of the time. The conductor said that I was making it seem like work, and I was. But that still sucked to hear. It wasn't really in a negative way, I was just a little bummed. I wanted to make a better impression, but that is ok. He is also the conductor for <span style=""FONT-STYLE: italic"">Die Zauberflote</span> so he heard me on a better day earlier. :) I was planning to go to sleep earlier on Tuesday because I had to sing in Aria Class the next day, but again, that didn't happen. </p><br /><p style=""FONT-SIZE: 11pt; MARGIN: 0in; FONT-FAMILY: Calibri"">&nbsp;</p><br /><p style=""FONT-SIZE: 9pt; MARGIN: 0in; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"">Wednesday: </p><br /><p style=""FONT-SIZE: 11pt; MARGIN: 0in; FONT-FAMILY: Calibri"">&nbsp;</p><br /><p style=""FONT-SIZE: 9pt; MARGIN: 0in; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"">A good day! I had Aria class and it was really interesting. It was just like a masterclass really. The Artistic Director of the program, Sylvia Anderson, was the one giving the class. Each student that was chosen sang an aria and then she gave suggestions as to what we could work on. So example, one of the girls was kind of struggling with an aria and Sylvia noticed that her breath was not being supported correctly so she had her stand differently and put her hand on her stomach and her back so that she would be aware of her breath support. Little things like that can make a difference. Each person has different issues with each thing that they sing, so masterclasses are really good for that. Though masterclasses are a bit more formal and not really hands on so to speak. They are usually given by guest professionals as well. Summer programs are kind of like a huge masterclass and more. :)</p><br /><p style=""FONT-SIZE: 11pt; MARGIN: 0in; FONT-FAMILY: Calibri"">&nbsp;</p><br /><p style=""FONT-SIZE: 9pt; MARGIN: 0in; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"">So, when it was my turn to sing, I got up and did my funny aria cuz we all know that I am am better at comedy. It actually wasn't too bad. I mean, it was 11:00am so it wasn't great, but not too bad. She had only good things to say and some little suggestions. She said ""You know what Giliana, I think that you can sing anything. I think that you could sing the mezzo roles but I love how you approach the higher register too. What other rep do you have?"" To which I couldn't name off the top of my head cuz I was kinda swimming and then she said that she wants me to learn a new aria while I'm here and to start thinking of what I would like to learn. She also suggested that I coach the aria with Hector my audition instructor to help with the comedy. I am thrilled with those comments. Many people had less positive comments, so that made me happy. :) </p><br /><p style=""FONT-SIZE: 11pt; MARGIN: 0in; FONT-FAMILY: Calibri"">&nbsp;</p><br /><p style=""FONT-SIZE: 9pt; MARGIN: 0in; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"">After class one of the other sopranos, Katy and I decided to go to Pier 39 to see the sea lions. THEY ARE SO FUNNY! We stopped by the pier to see Alcatraz and then went to Boudin Sourdough to get the BEST New England Clam Chowder in a sourdough bread bowl. Yes, I know, I had New England Clam Chowder in California. Yes, I am a dork. lol. But it was delicious and they are famous for their sourdough here. Then we went closer to the sea lions and stopped to grab a sweatshirt on the way! YAY! I was warm! lol. Though, today is wasn't that cold outside. Sunny and pretty actually. :) </p><br /><p style=""FONT-SIZE: 11pt; MARGIN: 0in; FONT-FAMILY: Calibri"">&nbsp;</p><br /><p style=""FONT-SIZE: 9pt; MARGIN: 0in; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"">I finally saw the Golden Gate Bridge from a distance. YAY! And we walked through Fisherman's Wharf and went to Ghirardelli square. They give you free chocolate in the shop - yummeh. So, we got some chocolate of course and stopped at the cafe to get milshakes. OMG. YUMMY MILKSHAKES! I can't remember that last time that I had one. These were amazing. </p><br /><p style=""FONT-SIZE: 11pt; MARGIN: 0in; FONT-FAMILY: Calibri"">&nbsp;</p><br /><p style=""FONT-SIZE: 9pt; MARGIN: 0in; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"">Today was such a good day. I am liking the city more now that I have seen more of it. Katy is from around here, so it was nice to have a guide of sorts. She is very cool too. I'm getting to know some great people and finding that a lot of their stories are similar to mine. It is nice to have that in common with people. This still isn't my favorite place in the world, but I am starting to like it much more now that I am getting a better grasp on the flow. :) </p><br /><p style=""FONT-SIZE: 11pt; MARGIN: 0in; FONT-FAMILY: Calibri"">&nbsp;</p><br /><p style=""FONT-SIZE: 9pt; MARGIN: 0in; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"">BTW - I found out why I am so tired all of the time. I am super anemic. Say it with me now - yay. Well, at least we know what it is now and I know what I need to do.

"event","<p>Monday was ok. I loooooooved my audition class. It was amazing. I learned so much and can't wait for the next one!&nbsp;We had to get to know our instructor a bit and he went around the room and asked us questions about our experiences and asked us what our dream was.&nbsp;He does love himself, but also loves to share what he knows which is wonderful. He really is a brilliant man. So we had to think of nine things. 3 things we really strongly believe in that we can grab onto when we need. Then 3 things we like/love and 3 things we dislike. Then we had to exit the room, come into the room like we are having an audition and make eye contact with every person in the room (there were about 15 of us) and introduce ourselves with an inflection in our voice that would leave an impression. Very cool. Then we had to state each of the nine things and make eye contact and hit one person for each thing. It was awesome! We each did it and discovered our little idiosyncrasies. I tend to drift backwards when I talk. It was great. I actually was thrilled with how I did. I love auditions and don't usually get nervous, I thrive on that stuff. While so many get so freaked. The class was fabulous, I have another one next week.<br /><br />I didn't have anything for the rest of the day so I went back to my room. On the way back I stopped at Whole Foods which is like an entire city here. EVERYONE shops at whole foods here. It is great and not horribly pricey. After lunch I went for a walk to Fillmore st. which is where there are designers (I found a MAC store - YAY!) and tons and tons of cafes. Kinda trendy and cool. It was so windy yesterday though, I was freezing my butt off. My original goal was to find a place to get a sweatshirt cuz I forgot to pack one - idiot. But, I had forgotten my wallet. Grrrrr....&nbsp; Not that I found a place to actually get a sweatshirt.<br /><br />I have to say that so far, I am not a fan of this city. Admittedly, I haven't seen that much of it, but so far, not so good. There is nothing but restaurants and seedy stores and homeless people everywhere. lol. Maybe it is cuz I am cold and tired. Today I am feeling better. So hopefully the jetlag is passing. :)&nbsp;<br /><br />I have Alexander Technique today and then I have rehearsal from 7-10 so I am going to go out to Pier 39 and see if I can find somewhere to get some warmer clothes. :)<br /><br />Thanks for reading!</p>"

"event","<p><br />But so happy.&nbsp;<br /><br />I&nbsp;had a great day! I went to brunch downstairs in the hotel and met a girl who was part of the program here. She isn't nice. WHATEVER! Don't need people like that around. Then I went upstairs and got to memorization until I left. The bus is about 7 blocks away. I could've taken a bus to that bus, but I figured I need the exercise and I didn't mind walking. It was a lovely day, a little windy and cool, but not cold.&nbsp;<br /><br />Some lady on the bus threatened to kick me with her 86 year old knees. It was so funny! I was just standing there on a packed bus and she was like, my knees are 86 years old but it you come close to them, I will kick you. So naturally I said, lady, you kick me and I will just kick you back and my knees are younger and stronger, so I don't reccomend it! LOL! I am so mean. But is was for NO reason. Just some crazy lady. ha ha! This stuff only happens to me. I'll have to save this story for the tell all. ;)<br /><br />I get there and have a costume fitting and met one of my old English diction teacher's students. She is a doll and our bdays are exactly 5 days apart. Leos rock... or roar??? hee hee. So, orientation started, we heard many wise words from the multiple directors and all kinds of inspirations and some not so inspiring things when they started talking about the rules. Like punctuality and if you are late, you are in trouble and could get cut. Then about how if you don't know your music - you are screwed and will get cut. So there was mucho amounts of scariness, but I wasn't flinching. So that was a good sign. :) I mean it is naturally expected that you know all of these things in the professional world, but you have to say them cuz there are always a few people in the bunch who just don't get it and don't know the music or deter their colleagues by being late. I met all of the people from my scenes, it was weird as we all ended up congregating in the same place and sitting together not knowing that we were all in the same scenes. Met some really great people who are ALOT like me. ha. AKA - INSANE. Met some Diva attitudes as well, but I don't have to interact with them, so whatever.&nbsp;<br /><br />One of the really cool things about this is that there are a ton of people like me, tall, bigger and very cool. ;) Now a days the opera world consists of skinny-minis who are like a size two and blond and adorable. But that wasn't what it was like here, which is sooooo encouraging! I guess they really are more laid-back out here on the west coast. And they still hold to the traditions of the old opera world. Which is nice. I'm writing this at about 10:30 my time and 1am your time so if I'm babbling, sorry!<br /><br />So, during orientation, we all went around and introduces ourselves and stated what our goals were for our time here. I of course was super bubbly and happy and full of energy and said that my goal was to absorb as much as I possibly could both from my colleagues and from the environment around me as I'm new to the whole west coast thing. I also said that I wanted to meet EVERYONE and get to know EVERYONE to wich everyone laughed. I was well-received. ha! Some people came up to me afterwards and were like - OMG, you are such a ball of energy! We love you. tee hee. My evil plan is working. *wrings hands evilly*<br /><br />After orientation, we went RIGHT into rehearsals. Well, dinner break first and then rehearsals. I feel like crap today because I do have a litle jet lag. Well, my voice has jet lag. But that is ok, the whole weather/environment/time change is naturally going to affect me and my voice. So, I'm not going to be concerned. I didn't sound like utter crap, but I didn't sound my best. My first rehearsal was for <em>The Merry Wives of Windsor</em> and it went well. One of the sopranos unfortunately didn't have the correct score and memorized the wrong words - oopsie! But they were pretty understanding. I didn't do too badly. After the initial OH MY GOD I'M ACTUALLY DOING THIS nervousness wore off, I was good to go and had some fun. My second rehearsal was for <em>The Magic Flute</em> - loved it! I am such a Mozart girl. And I sang A LOT. But by the end of the night, my voice was getting a little tired. Which is to be expected of course. I'm not exactly in the best shape what with back problems and the like for the past few years. But I know that after a week or so, I will be better. For now, just have to rest (ya right - not with my schedule!) and take it easy when I can.<br /><br />The schedule is pretty nuts. I have classes from 10-12 in the am, lunch break for 1 hour then rehearsals from 1-5 then dinner then rehearsals for something else from 6-10. So, yah, no rest for the wicked! OF course, you don't always have that schedule, you do always have classes in the am, but sometimes you don't have afternoon/evening rehearsals so you can actually go and explore or rest. Tomorrow I have a class in the am and then thankfully I don't have a class. But that can change at the last minute too. :)&nbsp;<br /><br />So, for any of you planning to come and visit me, I cannot guarantee that I will be able to spend A TON of time with you. I can absolutely spend some of the time with you folks, but not all of it and most likely not at night.&nbsp;<br /><br />Anyway, I didn't have to take the bus back tonight cuz of one the girls in my scenes is from Berkely and was gracious enough to drive me home as it was on her way. YAY FOR RIDES!!&nbsp;OH! And one more great story... I was asking a question about the audition class and how we were supposed to dress and the director of the program was like - GILIANA we are SO glad to see your smiling face again, I'm so happy that you could join us. LOVE HER! WHEE! I left an impression and in this businnes, I cannot even begin to tell you how important that is!!! <br /><br />Ok, I am babbling and I need to get some sleep. Until next time. Keep smiling.</p>"

Yay. It was packed with people, though. The only problem was that my headphone port didn't work and I couldn't watch the in flight tv shows and movie. Well, I watched them, just without sound. Actually, that can be quite amusing. So, I was a good girl and learned my music instead. And the views from the plane were really amazing. The air was clear in most parts of the mid-west so you could see the fields and flatness of the land. At one point, all the fields were round. Interesting, my mind kept wandering to crop circles. lol. Then we flew over the Rockies. WOW! GORGEOUS! They were slightly snow-capped and simply magnificent. I love mountains. I think they are amazing, must be from all of those years of skiing!&nbsp;</p><p style=""FONT-SIZE: 11pt; MARGIN: 0in; FONT-FAMILY: Calibri"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""FONT-SIZE: 9pt; MARGIN: 0in; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"">Anyway, the rest of the flight was fine. The touchdown to the runway however, SUCKED! It was super bumpy and we hit the run way at sort of an angle, so that was&nbsp;NOT fun. After that everyone was like ""Get me off of this plane"". Then we all had to wait for about an hour for our luggage. They were having problems with the belt that brought it up to us. Grrr.. After being on the plane for 6 hours, all you want to do is get your stuff and head to wherever it is that you are going.&nbsp;</p><p style=""FONT-SIZE: 11pt; MARGIN: 0in; FONT-FAMILY: Calibri"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""FONT-SIZE: 9pt; MARGIN: 0in; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"">I grabbed a cab and got to my hotel. It is actually very nice. An old house that has rooms that are like apartments. They have private rooms as well as shared suites. Mu room is like a 3 room apartment. And it is great! I have a large living room with a couch and tv and stuff. Then my bedroom is also large and very nice with 2 huge closets. My bathroom is FABULOUS. They just re-did it and it is great!! I will post pictures later. :) You have to be buzzed in to the hotel. It is very safe, not in the greatest part of town, but not that bad either. But I love it. And they have a lift! I loooove lifts! I think they are the coolest things. I'm not an elevator girl, but lifts rock. It has these guilded doors that you have to pull bak to get on and off. I keep forgetting and waiting for the doors to open&nbsp;- lmao.&nbsp;</p><p style=""FONT-SIZE: 11pt; MARGIN: 0in; FONT-FAMILY: Calibri"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""FONT-SIZE: 9pt; MARGIN: 0in; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"">It is COLD here people! I had plenty of warning from many people that it gets cold here in the summer, so I am prepared. But geez. Today it was only in the low 50s. They said that it hasn't been that cold at all and it was almost 80 the day before yesterday. Well, good, I'd rather haev like 60s and 70s than 50s. Brrr! There was no sun yesterday either. All fog. But by the end of the day, the fog was burned off a bit and the sun came out.&nbsp;I went exploring a bit. I was so tired from not really sleeping the night before (last minute packing is a bad idea). And&nbsp;was still on Boston time, so I was a little messed up time-wise, but now that I've had a good night's sleep, I feel much better!&nbsp;And the hills here - sheesh! I don't know how some of the cars make it up some of these hills cuz they are soooooo steep! Good thing there isn't snow here or everyone would be screwed!! lol.</p><p style=""FONT-SIZE: 11pt; MARGIN: 0in; FONT-FAMILY: Calibri"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""FONT-SIZE: 9pt; MARGIN: 0in; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"">Today (Sunday) I have orientation and then we dive right into rehearsals. I have 3 rehearsals all going on at the same time... that&nbsp;will work out well, I'm sure.&nbsp;Ah, the performer's life for me. Tomorrow I hope to get to do a bit of exploring as our rehearsals are near Golden Gate Park and such. Still haven't seen the bridge. :) I'm sure that when I do, I will be a dork and take a million pictures. lol.&nbsp;</p><p style=""FONT-SIZE: 11pt; MARGIN: 0in; FONT-FAMILY: Calibri"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""FONT-SIZE: 9pt; MARGIN: 0in; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"">So, off to breakfast for me.

"event","&nbsp;<span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""border-collapse: collapse; font-family: verdana; font-size: 11px; white-space: pre-wrap; "">I woke up to the sound of purring.  A kitten, almost a cat, really, had placed himself next to my face for warmth.  He'd seen me move, and that spark alone was enough to ignite his purrbox.  It was the first time in a while that I woke up smiling.  Animals are loyal without question - you feed them, clean up after them, and they give you the promise of constant affection.  To be loved is no small goal in life, and in so many ways, the promise of love that a pet brings to you can make all the difference in the world.  When I set out at the beginning of this year, my goals and my priorities were vastly different.  I was freshly engaged, and looking forward to a lifetime with my fiance, comfortable in the knowledge that my daughter was going nowhere, and preparing to settle in for a lifetime of love.  Nearly every part of that goal has been altered or damaged in some way, and I have been forced at every turn to reconfigure my plans.  Jess gave up on me, Vesper's step-dad joined the military (with the ephemeral suggestion that he &quot;shouldn't have to relocate&quot;), and returning to a life where I am mostly alone.  It's easy to give in to depression and despair, especially during the holiday season, but I do my best to push on.  I hate the fall and winter, and the way they always make me feel - grim reminders of relationships ending, and false promises of new beginnings.  I've put forth my best effort to make myself something worthy - awesome job, honest person, good friend - but I know in my heart that I'm still not trying hard enough.  I don't have anything to offer someone beyond that job, that honesty, and that friendship.  I wish that those things were sufficient for a good relationship, but they're not - especially not at 28, overweight, and going bald.  I think sometimes that not caring, just giving up on the dating thing and trying to focus on just doing the things I love will lead me to someone, and that's probably true.  But ever impatient, it's the days I spend at home alone, sitting on the couch, reading a book or playing a game, that seem the longest and most difficult.  What little affection I can extract from the world is distant and cautious, and I feel guilty making any assumptions about its permanence.  And with good reason, I think.  So here's to January - to the promise of something better, a year with a fresh start at a new job, one more year in the decade, and to good friendships that never die, no matter the distance.  To a year full of hope and wonder, and a year with the hidden promise of unexplored horizons, new opportunities, and something better than the sum of my parts.  I love y'all dearly, and hope that everyone has something good to look forward to this year.  Enjoy your Christmases, and maybe we'll meet again next year.</span>"

Let's light candles and burn wood in the fireplace; let's bake cookies and pies, and sing about the joy of each other.

"event","A life update, presented with limited commercial interruption, by Smuckers.

I don't really know, from one day to another, how I'm doing.  If you asked me in person, I would tell you that I'm fine.  Maybe I am.  It isn't even really that different days bring different moods, it's different from that.  It's a constant feel that I'm in a dead zone, a gray area in my life.  This is a frequent occurrence for me, but usually it's something to complain about, and right now I kinda like it.

I count my blessings, as it were, with the measured breath of a person wide asleep.  I have good friends who see to it that I'm never not busy.  I have a wonderful roommate who always pays on time and is like a best friend to me.  I have a healthy, vibrant daughter, who can ride a bike without training wheels now.  My parents are in good health, and are about to pay off the last of their substantial debt, thus securing a smooth future for them.  I have the friendship of my ex, and it's something that I actually really wanted, really hoped to not lose.

I don't mind my commute each day, long as it is.  I treasure my Wednesdays, and with them, the opportunity to take Vesper to school, pick her up, go to the library and the park.  She reminds me of the importance of seeking out pleasure in simplicity.  My life is gradually settling into a pre-30's zen calm, the awareness and acceptance of a man who is idling, scanning the horizon for new mountains to climb.

I often imagined, even very recently, that things would have gone differently for me.  It is one of my great disappointments that I've tried to be bitter over things, tried to feel angry and hurt, cast aside and emotionally abused.  I've gone so far as to try to convince myself that being alone was the fault of others, that time after time, relationship after failed relationship, it was somebody else's fault.

I don't feel that I'm a bad partner.  But I don't think the women I've been with have been good fits for me, or at least not as good a fit as I'd like to make myself believe.  I have a tired heart, a dreamer's mind - my song is a sigh, and the appreciation of a slow sunset, a campfire, and the phosphor glow of a computer screen.  I do not fit into a conventional stereotype, and for whatever reason, it has bothered me in the past.  But I understand now, one very important thing.  Please understand that I'm not being whiny or emo, or melodramatic.  It's simply what I believe:

To be completely true to yourself is to be alone.

Think about that before you shake your head.  It's true, every word of it.  The key is in the ""completely,"" of course.  Love takes sacrifice, and it is always the sacrifice of self that makes things work, makes them last.  You give part of yourself to the fire, and in return, the other person fits a little more snugly in the space that's left behind.  It is comfortable, and it is always worth the sacrifice.

But being alone is okay too.

And I am, believe me.  I'm very loved by my friends, and I spend as much time with them as I can.  I care so much about the people who take the time to call, to write, or to stop by.  That interaction is my communion, the reminder of the parts that are still human about me, still a part of a larger society.  But ultimately, in the ""my head is filled with thoughts"" way, I have no partner, no one who wants to hold my hand through it all.

It's been a strange feeling for me, despite having been that way for two years before.  I kind of like it, the realization that I do not need to search, don't need to push the river.  I have my dear friends, I have my birds, and I have my body pillow - I am not lacking for things to hug and snuggle.  I have my journal, my laptop, and the occasional poorly written fictional piece for a contest - I am not empty of words, or mediums to express them in.

And so this is my life.  In January, I'll be 28, which actually feels better to me than 27.  Even number, I guess.  And I don't imagine much will have changed by then.  I continue to pay off debt, and save up for trips to warmer climes.  Disneyland with V in June, Sunriver and Hollywood in Summer.  

I'm happy, and restless.  By habit alone, I long for female companionship, someone to snuggle up with over a movie.  But it's fading.  I feel the pull toward new, more interesting work.  Sometime after the new year, I'll probably start looking for something different.  Sometimes I think of going back to school, other times I don't.  In a couple years, I'll be out of debt, and able to think about buying a house or a condo.  Sometime within the next year, I'll know if Vesper is going to stay in Washington.

Until then, I'll just stand and watch the ocean, listen to the waves crash over my feet.  Dream about something familiar, hope for something good to come again.

I think it will."

"event","I arrived home last night, worn and torn from the 8 hour drive, but feeling rejuvinated.  A good vacation can do that - set your soul on fire with new promises and ideas.  I don't think anyone can come away from a place like Sunriver without a goal of living there and working as a tour guide, but luckily for me, less exotic plans were able to come to fruition and stick.
     The standout experience for me was the fly-fishing.  I'm not sure what I expected when I pulled up next to the dirty old Ford.  Probably I imagined that it would be fun, as just about anything outdoors is, especially in Oregon.  I probably imagined that a couple hours would be all I could take, and maybe a small fear that I'd disappoint my dad in not seeing the joy in fishing after all these years.
     As it turned out, I had absolutely nothing to wonder about.  Buckled into waders, and armed with a rental-rod, I forded the river to the halfway point, up to my stomach in fast-flowing lake runoff, tactically positioned within casting distance of several protective rocks.  Fish lurked under them, where the current was easiest to swim against, snatching out whatever food came by.  I aimed to ruin their morning.
     There is something that can't be effectively described in words about fly fishing.  Maybe it carries over to traditional fishing as well, that zen calm you feel when you're alone on a dock, or in silent company on a boat.  I don't know, I haven't fished in years.  But the ease of the casting, the flow of the river, and above all, the gentle rhythm in your cast, track, repeating causes something akin to time dilation.  The white noise of the river, the peace of repetitive movement, engineered to fool sneaky fish, it all puts you inside of yourself in a way nothing else can compare.  It was a year if it was 4 hours, maybe fifteen minutes.  After a few casts, the rod becomes a part of you, the river becomes your legs.  Your eyes drift along with the flow of water, you draw line, loop it back, paint the air.  The thin swish of line cutting wind, the occasional tug of a curious fish.
     In a place like that, you are both there, and not there.  Endlessly aware of the slightest anomaly at the end of the line, my head swam with problems, knots to be untied.  I realized things about myself that needed to be realized.  A call to grow up, to quit pretending that barely sliding through life can be justified by a good paying job.  A hope for the future, for more time to get away from it all in a meaningful way.  To enjoy my usual hobbies, but to branch out, to not just say I'm going to do something, but do it.  Back and forth goes the line.  A bite, but a miss.  Recast.  Reset.
     I miss Jess, her ease of character, her friendly grin.  A smoke in one hand, an eyebrow raised.  Cast, slide, line, cast.  Her smell, her hands, her stretch.  Reel in, sharpen up.  She's in my skin, under it.  Earn it, less talk, more rock.
     I caught eight fish in that four hour/year/minute period.  Five little 4-inch shits, and three footlongish rainbow trout.  Slippery fish-hands, remove the hook, say goodbye, send them down the river.  When the guide told us our time was up with the equipment, I thought we were taking a lunch break.  But no, four hours had passed.  I wanted to stay for four more, maybe forever.  In a cold river in the canyons of central Oregon, I found Nirvana, a personal zen garden, a place where I could recall the good memories, and believe for a time that I could bring them back.  In the flow of the river, surrounded by weeds and fish, I saw the things about myself that I loved, and the things I didn't want.  In a very real way, I felt a spiritual connection with nature, and an awe for the outdoor experience.
     My vacation was filled with moments like this, though none so profound.  Starry skies untied by telescopes, bike rides down back roads, hikes to waterfalls, and a cold beer in a hot tub.  Back to the other world, back to work.  But that's okay.
     Like the Cylons, I have a plan.  I am tired of surviving.  I am ready to live again."

Man, it never happens.  It NEVER happens.  There is always a darkness, always a light.  I have so many things swirling inside me, my heart is a disco, dark as night, filled with light.

I'm being dragged down by my mom about my choices, and I finally snapped at her and told her what I think.  She shut up, after meekly suggesting that she ""just vents"" while I ""attack.""  Uh huh.  Her favorite line to throw is that because I ""don't believe in heaven"" I'm amoral, and feel like I can do whatever I want.  Pure genius.

On the other hand, there's this totally awesome girl from Oregon.  I've had like 13 girls emailing me between eHarmony and Match, and this girl just sweeps me off my feet.  So cute, so funny.  She has a kid, is an ex-Marine, but she's got this totally rad ""devil may cry"" attitude that's impossible to not be charmed by.  She lives life as it comes, is really laid back, and has a biting sense of humor to boot.  Killer chick, and she's coming to the party on Saturday.  I am really nervous and fluttery for the first time since Jess.  This girl keeps me on my toes, I hope something happens here.

I'm torn up by finances, the credit cards are eating me alive, and my only recourse is to buckle down and tell them to fuck off.  Which I'm doing.  I'm trying to find a cheaper place to live come the Fall, but damn, gas is so fucking expensive.  I want to eat my shoes, it's so goddamn much.  I'm being raped for about $320/mo in gas, and I drive a fucking HYBRID.  Absurd.  Living further north will cut that bill in half, while giving me a place to live that's much cheaper than my current rent.  I don't know for sure that that's what I'm going to end up doing yet, since it also depends on Chris's plans, but I need to get some cash flowing again.  I need to own my life again.  My mom, of course, thinks I'm being selfish and abandoning Vesper.

So yes, Amy moved in, and that has been quite rad and low key.  It's nice knowing someone else is in the apartment again, and I'm not a sad, lonely bird-man.  The bad kind of bird-man, the kind that does not fly.

In relationship news, since romance and heartache are all these journals are designed for - I met a cute girl from Canada, but she's from Canada.  Fail.  I met another cute girl from Oregon, and I'm going to hang out with her.  I hope that she is as rad in person as she has been online.  She's a big sweetheart, and filled with piss and vinegar.  Not literally, unless she has drank a lot of vinegar.

I don't really know what to say about Jess anymore.  When I don't see her, I feel fine.  When I see her, I get kinda mixed up in my stomach.  I want to say things, but the things are so fucking conflicted.  I'm actually really proud at how well I've held up with everything.  I have a feeling that she's making a mistake or two, and I have a small consensus growing that all believe she's going to try to get back together with me before 3 or so months are up.  I don't know how realistic that is, and at this point, I don't really know that I care.  The longer I think about the way stuff ended, the more I can feel anger in my heart, and the less I want to even talk to her anymore, let alone date her again.

I maintain that the worst way to break up is to let shit fade away.  Break my heart up front, tell me straight up that you don't want this.  I'm not a prepubescent girl, I can handle rejection.  Don't tell me you want to be with me, want to work it out, and then turn around and tell your sister you want to move out with her cuz you're dumping me.

I don't even want to talk about it here.  For all I know she reads this, too, so whatever.  It hurt, worse than anything, cuz I trusted her.  A lot.  I don't really know that anything good is ever going to spring up out of those ashes.

In other news, I got to hang with Melissa all day yesterday, and that was rad as hell.  We did some copyshop stuff to get her paperwork in order to bring her boyfriend over, and went out for sushi and a movie.  It was really fun, she was incredibly nice, and things didn't feel awkward at all.  I think she's going to come up and go swimming in our pool soon, which will mark the first time since 1976 that I've taken my shirt off at a swimming pool.  Ew.

So yeah.  Meeting cool new people, love my roomieface, and getting to see Vesper a lot.  Life is turning out to be quite better, day by day."

She's always there, at the apartment, which is fine.  But she's completely stone now - all the friendliness has gone out of her.  My mom said that when they had a talk about the breakup, Jess painted it like I'm the one who changed, like I gave up on her.  Neglecting to mention that she had texted her sister, in reply to the question ""Did you break up with John,"":

""No, not yet.  We're in the apartment for six months, then we'll break up, and not get back together.""

That text is what spawned me breaking things off.

I just don't get it.

Sometimes I feel ugly, terrible, inept, and all the things associated with breakups ending.  

Lately, though, I've been losing weight, feeling better, and noticing that she's gaining weight, and smoking like a chimney.  I guess if she wants to look at me like I'm a burden, more power to her.

We talked it out, and while she seems to really want to get back to how things were, she doesn't think we can.

I wish that it were that easy, to just take some time off from each other, and come back all happy together.  The truth?  I don't really think I want this relationship down the road.

I wanted it now.  I proposed to this girl, asked her to come into my life and grow old with me, and she said yes.  Now she's changed her mind, for seemingly no real reason but cold feet/fear.  I've worked on what she asked me to work on, and it doesn't matter.  I've done nothing but be supportive of her needs, and asked for very VERY little in return.  

I believe her when she says she loves me, and that she wants things to get back to the way they were together.  I also believe her when she says that she doesn't think they can at this point.

I wish I could believe that we'll find each other again.  

The truth for me?  I hate being alone.  I'm 27, I want to find someone, settle down, marry, and build a home and life together.  I want to take the kids for picnics at Mt. Rainier, and go to Disneyland together.  I want to come home and help my wife with dinner, play board games with the kids, and steal my lady away once or twice a year on a romantic ""just us"" getaway.  I want someone who has a real job, with a real idea about what her personal goals are, and who is working toward them, at any pace she feels comfortable.

Jess is a wonderful human being.  She is witty, delightful, down to earth, and not afraid to fart out loud.  She has an air of simplicity, but moments of profundity. Her personality and appreciation for playfulness is the exact sort of person I can fall in love with easily - but her direction, her goals, and her self esteem fall so far short of the mark, that I sometimes wonder how we even made it this far.

Aerosmith said it best - ""Falling in love is hard on the knees.""  I think I'm going to just continue to be civil and friendly to her during the transition - she's making plans to move out sometime soon with her best friend Aubrey.  But once we're no longer living together, I think we need to have a ""no-contact"" period, so I can shift back to single life with as little longing and whinyness as possible.

The winds of change are a-rumblin'.

Come December, there may be more change than one Livejournal can handle.  Stay tuned."

Mainly, Jess wants things to go back to how they were before they went to shit, back to when there was warm fuzzies and butterflies.  Me too!  But she doesn't really think we can get back there in our current state - too many scars from the past months.

It's looking like the best bet for both of us is going to involve taking a break.  Like a real, you move back down south and we see if we miss each other six months from now break. I told her to try quitting her job and going down south to her mom's for a couple weeks to get her head on straight, and figure out her priorities in life.  She hasn't replied yet, probably asleep.  I think she needs a major reset button on her life to figure out what she wants, dig?

And if things don't work out, they don't work out.  I love her so goddamn much, and to hear her say she just wants things to be good again was a huge boost to me.  But we can't keep going on like this.  Nobody should draw it out, suffer, have things hurt like they hurt now - dull, aching, and forever.

That said, moving her stuff out of the apartment will be a huge pain in the ass, ere the 2-3 week vacation I'm trying to get her to take.

"event","I try really hard to be a good guy.

I am overweight, and out of shape.  I like to do things like just sit and daydream, read a book, watch a favorite show.  Sometimes I will think for hours on end about things that are boring and mundane to everyone else, or about things that just don't matter.

And sometimes I will think too much about something simple, and with a heart full of suspicion and assumption, break the things not broken.

But now, things are broken.  And thinking about them yields difficult answers, and even harder solutions.

Since the discovery that my poor handling of money and general lazy attitude have factored in my girlfriend's decision to leave, I have been hard at work.  Clutching on to those ideas like the last child holding the last doll, I've washed every dish, packed every old thing I don't need for Goodwill, and saved every possible dime that didn't need to be spent.  I have worshiped at the shrine of thriftiness, and offered, every time I get up, to get her a drink, or something to snack on, or a needed/wanted item, so she doesn't have to do it herself.

The fruits of my labors are very small, and very fragile.  A familiar hand dragged lazily across the small of my back as she passes behind me, a casual ""I love you"" as she races out the door for work.

My attitude has grown small, and meek.  A helpful friend, undemanding, innocent.  There is a conflict in her, I can see.  She is a woman torn between two minds - the mind that knows this relationship has to end in five months, and the mind who loves the meek man that cares for her, and thinks it would be easier to stay.

But if my lax attitude of days past taught me something this time around, it's that easier is not always better.  A broken heart is the worst feeling in the world, but the pain numbs if you drag it out.

In five months, she will leave.  I know that now.  She dodges the direct question, so I stopped asking.  The only hope is that my continued compassion, my love and affection for her, will shine through long enough to change her mind.  

A distant hope.  Like grabbing a sunset in your hand, before the light sinks beneath the sky. This is how it was supposed to be! you cry.  You were supposed to be The One!

But there is no One.  No perfect other to live your days with.  In all things there is responsibility and compromise, and you, old man, always show up early or late to that dance.  I'm 27 years old, and all I want in my life is someone to call ""honey"" day in and day out.  Someone to spoon up with at night, fight back against the chill.  Someone to make a home with, a family.

I asked her to be that to me, and she said yes.  I gave her an endless stone to mark it.  And then it died.

All that's left is to carry it to its final resting place, sometime in the fall.  A lease ends, and the sun sets.  But isn't such normalcy the only real poetry in the world these days?

How sad.

I don't want to be alone anymore."

Livejournal is my outlet today, because I don't think anybody really reads it, and I don't know that I really want to reach out to anyone right now.

I just want to write.

Everything has gotten bad, very suddenly.  My Jess, my love, has been so stressed lately, and has taken to being a bit distant.  I'm so used to all the snuggles and closeness that we've shared over the past year and a half that it made me panic, and I began to worry about our relationship.  My worry made her irritable, and now I'm afraid that things might be falling apart.

I'm too emotional.  To overbearing.  I need too much.  And my need for affection, for reassurance that I'm doing okay is killing the best thing I've ever had.

I love her with everything I have.  I'm trying so hard to make everything okay, but I think I'm failing.  I'm trying to back off, to give her space, to let her breathe, while simultaneously reminding her that I love her so.

I don't know what's going to happen, but the first time since I met her, since I fell head over heels in love with her, I'm afraid.  Afraid of that timeless truism, that sometimes love just isn't enough.  If I could take how I felt, and turn it into a picture, show it to her, she'd know.  She'd just know.  But when I feel like I'm losing my heart, I panic, and I can't get the words out right.  I just don't want to lose her.

I don't want to be alone again, I don't want to be without my best friend. :(

Upon arriving to the campsite, it was pouring rain and dark, and the ground was slick with mud and leaves.  We decided right away that we'd sleep in the car, avoiding the mess of putting up a tent, and then having to take it down again the next morning.  Jess got the fire going, while I paid the site fee, and then we sat down in the passenger's seat with the door open, taking pulls from a bottle of excellent red wine, and staring into the fire.

We talked about how much we loved each other, how a little over a year ago we'd been awkwardly feinting at each other with flirts and sideways smiles at this same campground, and I mentioned that I had a present for her.  I told her that I wanted her to stand up to open it, so she could see in the fire's light what it was.  All thoughts of rehearsing anything fell out of my head, and I could only yammer.  I mentioned how what was inside the box was awesome, but what was more awesome was actually what it represented.  I told her how beautiful she was to me, and how long I'd wanted to give her the gift, and stood out in the rain with her, next to the fire, as she opened it.

She smiled when she saw it was a Power Glove, and grinned down at me as I sank to one knee in the mud.  I told her that now that she finally had the glove, I could steal her away and marry her, if she'd let me.  She smiled, and would later tell me how cute she thought it was that I was pretending to propose without the ring, etc.

Then I said the words.  ""Jessica.  Will you marry me?""  She was still nodding yes as I pulled out the ringbox and opened it, the firelight glinting off the diamond solitaire.

For a second she continued to nod, and then the nod slowed down as her eyes got wider and wider.

""ARE YOU FREAKIN' KIDDING ME?!"" she yelled, and tackled me in a flurry of passionate kisses.  I had to keep my finger on top of the ring so it didn't fall out into the mud.  She kissed me hard for a good two minutes, and then pulled away, tears in her eyes. 

""I take it that's a yes?"" I said.  She nodded and affirmed that yes, it was a yes.  I placed it on her finger, and she admired it for only a second before pulling me back into a hard kiss.

The rest of the night was filled with reminiscing, wine, and cuddling under blankets.  The rain fell hard, the fire eventually died out, and we fell asleep together, dreaming the dreams of people who know no malice in their love for each other.

Despite the car, and adjusting throughout the night, we slept the sleep of rocks, trees, and water.  

I'm so in love. :)"

Tomorrow I ask the question, and it finally means something.  I ask it not out of desperation, nor out of pity or fear.  I ask it because every day - EVERY day - it burns my lungs to ash and crawls up my throat, with blatant disregard to all reason.  I ask it because it is all that lives inside me, and all that reaches into my mind.

Yes, it's true, Batfans.  Moderate amounts of info to report.

The job is going alright, but I'm not liking the high level of responsibility.  I've talked to a number of people about it, but the reality is that I'm just not much of a leader.  The incredible stigma in this country that people who don't want to get the opportunity to lead are dicks is just false.  I want to enjoy my life, and part of that necessitates working at a job that is not stressful and reasonably enjoyable by my standards.  Alas, I'm surrounded by Type-A personalities, and it causes large amounts of friction.

I met a girl through eHarmony named Carly, who is positively adorable, and we hit it off like lightning.  Downside = she lives in California, but we're meeting in person on the 22nd, so we'll see how the chemistry works in person.  We're already talking on the phone for 2+ hours a night (yay unlimited nights and weekends) and photo-swapping, and we have a lot in common that counts.  Namely, we're lazy gits who enjoy watching DVD's of television shows, ""bad"" sci-fi, video games, and sharp humor.  It's a nice contrast to the people I've dated in the last couple years, and I'm not gonna jinx it by predicting anything yet.  More after the 22nd.

On the 3rd of October, I leave for Hawaii for Erica's wedding.  I won't be attending the ceremony for obvious reasons, but I fully intend to make good use of my couple of days on the beach.  Thanks to the forum goons at SomethingAwful.com (which is my all time favorite place in the internet - the forums, specifically), I have a long list of beautiful secret places to check out, hikes to make, and food to eat.  Brittany was going to tag along, but it looks like that's gotten shelved due to tensions on the homefront, and it's getting too close to the trip to not book my hotel room by now.

Erica has been very civil and cool lately, spending lots more time with Vesper, which I both appreciate and am saddened by.  Less time with my bug is a weird feeling, like a tangible emptiness, if such a thing makes sense.  Dinners are quieter, evenings are filled with silence and indecision.  I have no one to watch the Powerpuff Girls with.  :(  But on the plus side, she gets lots of time with her mom, which works out well for the both of them.  Vesper is happier, which is really what it's all about, and Erica seems to be too.  Peace is a desirable thing, always.

November 1st is the day I'm planning to move in to my new apartment with Kris.  2 bed, 2 bath, 1100 square feet, w/s/g paid, and with a dishwasher/laundry room, for $825 a month, after rebates.  Not too shabby.  Finally be out and about, and I get the Master Bedroom for Vesper and I, with a screen to turn it more into ""2"" rooms.  We'll likely get a pair of Sugar Gliders, but I'll probably wait until the breeder that I trust gets new joeys, and we're settled in a bit more at our new place.  

So life is moving.  It's shaping up into something cooler than it was yesterday, which should be modus operandi for every day.  Moving out, moving on, and feeling twitterpated - all essential parts of the human experience, and desirable qualities in any life.  

Carly pointed out that I have a ton of friends on Myspace.  It was something that I knew, but I thought about it - I don't really talk or hang with as many of you as I used to.  Life has slowly become more ""specialized,"" and it seems that about 3 or 4 people are all the socializing that I have any more.  It isn't a sad thing, either.  I love the people that I have in my life, all the way out to the obscure borders if it, but it's just growing older.  Some of you started dating someone, and they took all your free time (which is cool).  Some of you just moved out and on.  I hope that everyone is doing well for themselves, and that you all know that you can call me anytime, for any reason.  Even to yell at me, even to cry at me.  

Just don't be surprised if I don't pick up the phone first.  I'm a little wrapped up in the tangled web of love, loss, joy, and struggle that defines my own epic right now.  Lovies.

Brit invited me out to Endfest, but due to some scheduling constraints, there was no way we were going to make it for her to see Eagles of Death Metal in time, so we decided to just scalp the tickets, and do something else.

We hit up the Mazatlan in Bonney Lake, and proceeded to get her loaded on a 32oz margarita, followed by fajitas.  

What else could we do at that point besides hit up the strip club?

We rolled out to Deja Vu, pockets near to bursting with 1's, and bought the VIP access.  What followed was about 4 hours of hanging at the strip club, cracking jokes with the strippers, and watching Brittany get molested everytime she threw a dollar at a girl.  And I mean molested very, very literally! :D  Shower shows, spankings, one girl took my hat away and wore it for the rest of her stage dance, before kneeling down in front of me and making me ""come get your hat back, bud.""  Much to the rolling laughter of the club.

We were reasonably well done on Mike's hard lemonade the whole time too, which we consumed in earnest in the parked car out in the lot before we went in.

Then it was back home.

Tonight and tomorrow, I'll be staying with Miss Molly so I can get to work by 7 in the morning to set up interviews for Sam.  I have a wedding to go to tonight, and the next week is going to be a brutal hell.  Yay!

You made my list faster than anyone else in the history of my life.  Congrats.

24.  You really don't deserve what you have, but that's only normal when you're so used to it.  I hope you realize someday the treasures you have.

25.  There was a time I really thought of you as a friend, but then the calls stopped coming, and mine weren't returned.  I don't know what you do with your time, or your life now, but man, I really feel like I was wrong about you, and I wish that I could fix that.

26.  If I could find myself stranded with one person on a desert island, it would be you.  You make me laugh, you make me feel like there are some seriously awesome people left in the world, and watching you evolve has really made me proud.  For all my goofiness and annoying ability to run jokes in the ground, you still make the small movements, like touching my arm, or giving me a genuine hug, and they always feel sincere.  We don't really talk like we used to, but I know that there's so much more to you than even some of the closest people to you do.  Thanks for that.

27.  You first made me feel like you were pretty cool, but then I saw how freely you whored yourself out, metaphorically speaking, and at the lowest bid.  I'm sure there's more to you than that, but man, I just can't get past shit like that, and I already have no respect for you.  I don't think that can be salvaged, but then, I don't think you care, so it's probably best to leave it at that."

"event","TRY THIS: write 15 statements intended towards 15 people but never tell them it was about them or would never say it to their face or something you wish you would have said, but didnt

1.  I really think you have a ton to offer to the world, if you could just get past your bizarre insecurities.  There are times when I wish I could just punch you in the mouth and walk away, but I don't really have the opportunity to listen to your shit as much as that would take.  You seem to me to be otherwise smart, rational, and reasonably intelligent, but I often imagine you don't deserve what you have.  My loss.

2.  I'm pretty well convinced at this point that despite our lack of constant interaction, we have pretty much laid each other bare to the foundation, and know whatever we're ever going to know, save for casual events.  There was a time when I confused this for genuine attraction, and for that, I deserved to get pushed off.  That's good, though, because the more time went on, the more I realized there were better places for me than your arms.

3.  I think that you pretty much INVENTED intimidation amongst women.  You intimidated ME in ways that make me sorry that I ever bothered, but I did, and it was because I loved you, in a very real, very <i>simple</i> way.  Part of me still does, and really wishes that we had the chance that never really came.  I've often envisioned you as the perfect human being, and although we had our times and our moments, we never really shined, and it's mostly my fault.  Our worlds are diverged again, and it'll probably be for the best.

4.  You completely balance all of my insecurities, all of my fears, and all of my shortcomings against myself.  I've idolized you since I met you, and despite my best efforts to conceal it, I still think it shows.  I trust you implicitly, and if you led me into the mouth of the sweltering abyss, and told me that we would find glory within, I would follow you to the very end, and never ask you why we did it.

5.  You seem to me to be someone who is totally consumed by the past, and has no real way of fighting it off.  I think you carry its weight with you everywhere you go, and you've done some things that have borderline wrenched my heart out, but there's still love there, if cautious.  I trust you in an odd way, because you haven't really given me a reason to yet.  You constantly hide behind a wall you think is impenetrable, but for all its survivability, it's translucent as glass.

6.  You were once someone that I craved time with constantly, and now you kind of annoy the shit out of me, and I don't really know why.  You seem to me to be outspoken about ridiculous claims and things, and for all practical purposes, the things you say are filled to the brim with ridiculous bullshit that I can't even fathom.  I would never tell you this to your face, of course, but I really don't miss the time we spent together that much.  Sorry.

7.  You fascinate me.  You absolutely captivate me, and for all your thin shields, I see right through them, and am continually amazed at the core of what you are.  You have no idea that I think this about you, and you never will.  I wish that we'd met some other way, some way that could have brought us together in a more personal way, but I love knowing you like I do, and can't wait to get to know more.

8.  I fell in love with you the first night I met you.  I still have a bit of that left.  But I'll never, ever tell you that.

9.  The first time we met, you struck me as so completely adorable and beautiful, but I was trying too hard to impress someone else, and didn't follow our conversation as deeply as I wanted to.  Once that was over, we had a chance to spend time together, and I've been floored by you ever since.  I don't know why it is that I feel so strongly about you, and yet never act like that.  I sometimes entertain the idea that you feel the same way too, but you don't seem like the kind of person who would tell me, even if you knew.

10.  You've become a major let down to me.  I expected more of you, and you didn't deliver.  I wish that I could offer you some more advice about the way things went, but I just really don't care that much.  Not like you do, either.

11.  You have way too much ""love"" ""cute"" and ""adorable"" in you than one human being.  Besides having exquisite taste in music, you alone amongst my friends have the distinguishing capacity to not see me more than once in a blue moon, but still make me feel like the most important person in your life while we're together.  If I ever wanted to spend a whole week driving across the country with someone, it would be you before anyone else.  Every conversation with you is an adventure.

12.  The quirkiness of our first meeting, which is already all but forgotten, and the subsequent chain of conversations has led me to believe that we deserve to spend some quality time together, discussing some of the finer points of life.  You strike me as an intimitely enthusiastic conversationalist, and I can't wait to talk more with you.

13.  It didn't take you long to fascinate me.  I feel like we dance around each other in some way, waiting for one of us to strike.  I don't know who it will be, but I hope it's you, cuz I suck at making the first assault.  After that's over, I think it'll be interesting to see where that goes.  Intensely worded conversations of an epic nature are all but assured, though.

14.  You are pretty firmly convinced that I'm both full of shit and selfish, by turns.  The reality is, though I'll never admit it to you, that in casting you aside, I severed a limb - an artery, even, and that all I want in all the world is for you to love me and accept me again.  For all my bartering with words, all my pleasantries, insults, and ramblings, I'm saying the same thing over and over.  ""Please just be my friend.  I love you.  Don't go.""

15.  I found something in you that I hadn't found before in anyone else, and it ignited a spark in me that took a good couple months to really kill.  I had to, though, and I'm glad I did, because I could't have been your friend otherwise.  I know you had your reasons, and I appreciate the honesty.  Thanks for the time, and the memories."

"event","of my daughter(buggy) today. 

she was in a drama production called ""The Magical Dream Machine"" 

On Saturday they had a dress rehersal and the little girl doing half of her part stole a chunk of buggy's lines. the drama teacher went to discuss the issue with the girls and after a tantrum from the other child, buggy lost some of her lines. 

my daughter was so upset, but like a trooper she got her posistive attitude back and went on with the show. 

today that other little girl decided that she wanted to goto the pictures with her class instead of doing the first showing of the play...after all they do it three times all told in the one day...buggy would do it..and she would just do the other two sessions. 

the drama teacher was furious and went to ask buggy if she would do it. like a trooper my daughter took over the other girls part, she didnt miss a line and she was commended for her performance by the lady who was examining them at the end of the second session. 

the other child had lied and told a different story to her class teacher, the drama teacher and her mother, she wasn't allowed to be in any of the sessions although you should of seen her squealing when she was told she couldn't be in the show."

This article really makes you wonder. I heard about it first on a radio news bulletin friday morning.

What i would like to know, is how could you accidently forget that the butter in the fridge had been mixed with dope? How could you scoop out a spoonful of the butter, add it to pasta, and not realise that the smell that happened as the butter melted into the hot steaming spaghetti pointed to the fact that the butter had extra ingredients?

These two baby sitters may plead forgetfulness, but does this mean they are not responsible?

One of the children reportedly almost died due to this overdose. 

Damn it makes you worry about leaving your kids with a baby sitter."

"event","This weekend i had the chance to goto two reunions. 

One of them was a school reunion for my primary school, it was the 40th birthday of the school. The weather was bad, very cold and wet. I went over and had a look at all the stalls and spoke to a few people. While i was there and slowly making my way out of the grounds i came across a gang of people that i had been in classes with. One of those people was a girl i was best friends with for many years, she hasn't changed. By this i mean, when i came upto the group of people and started saying hi to them all, she suddenly tried to take the focus off of me and told them they all had to run across the school ground to go see an old teacher. Some of the people who were just about to talk to me looked at each other what should we do there expressions said, and they followed her expecting that i would join them. It was the same old thing, she has always been like that, i found it rude and thought stuff em and walked the otherway. It still pisses me off that people can be so rude, she demands to be the center of attention and the little followers always do what she wants.

The other reunion was for a chat room that i have belonged to for many years, that just seemed to slowly die after geocities was wrecked by yahoo. This reunion was a buzz, the people are all great. It was sad to watch them slowly drift away from the old room and it was grand to see so many are still in contact with each other. 

It is cos of these people from Paris cafe comunity i know have access to this live journal. They are a supportive bunch, and i have always found people i have made friends with from the net are just as real when you meet them in real life as any R/L person you may know.

I have decided that reunions can be fun and i will attend them in the future, even if its just for a little while. I will also go with a ready excuse to escape early if needs be. :)"

Underwires in ladies bras suck such big time, why do they always snap when you are out, and then the break starts pinching your breasts and really hurts. So annoying, and its not like i can just take the bra off whereever I am at the time, I am too big for that.

So there you go, someone who is trying to work out how to become a millionare....make me a bra with underwires that wont snap!!!"

i was sitting in paris cafe:1 chatting to delta and a couple of others

delta started telling me that there had been a horific plane crash into a building, in disbelief i tried to get it on our news, we didn't start getting news about the terrorism of that day till half an hour later on our news. i remember sitting with delta, and later i think john came in, he wasn't getting as much info about what was happening as delta due to communication problems

the day went on and more people came in to talk about it

it was great having support through our own feelings of what happened that day

hugs everyone

"event","LOL...I'm so excited as I write this

I got my car back, not only did I get my car back, it was in not bad condition, things could of been much worse.

How it happened was so freaky. My sister brings her kids here everyday for schooling and baby sitting purposes. She takes the same route every day, but today the traffic was piled up for miles, and she was running late, so she took a side cut she knew of.

As she was driving along the streets of the short cut she saw a car  parked neatly on the side of the road. She thought it looked like mine and quickly jotted down the number plate and raced to my place. 

She raced inside and asked me my number plate, I told her and she was jumping around telling me she had found it. I quickly reported it to the police and organised a lift to where it was parked. At that time another amazing thing happened a lady pulled up in a driveway and it ended up being a mum of a child I have taught during my teaching practicums. I asked her what she had noticed, she had seen the car being driven by the people across the road the past week.

On inspecting the car I found that there was lots of stuff in there that wasn't mine, things like a wallet, key cards, a steel rod, used syringes, empty spring water containers, enough to get lots of DNA and finger print evidence. You see the cops had also found some items in the car, like a mobile phone. Seems the people using my car were all set up in it, they ha taken it on like their own.

I have more i can write but i will have to do it later...the cops just rang me, they want the cig butts in my car...ya see they have caught the mongrel and they want the DNA from the butts to help their case:)

"event","stress is an ever funny thing
manifests itself in so many ways
stress is the way your body says slow down
its a measure to make you stop and think
one day you body functions normally
the next it wants to stop and shout
listen to the heart beat, listen to the flesh
if it's speaking to you take that rest

throw away the times and trials
the busy lifestyle of today that seems to prevail
stop and smell the flowers, see the sun, and watch the star
stress is an ever funny thing, don't let it cut your life short!

yeap now where did that come from, i have been under so much stress lately, one things to the next i just can't seem to get a break, its driving me insane, i'm trying to fix it, but sometimes it seems so hard

last saturday one of my aunt had what we thought was a stroke, she lost her speech and her right side went weak. today we had news that they beleive that she hasn't had a stroke, her body and mind have been unde too much stress, so it decided to take a rest..

slow down folks...don't let stress make you sick..."

"event","Just before christmas day (02) one of my uncles was asked by a lady to go and get some cigarettes for her mother who was housebound. Uncle bill got on his push bike and got the cigarettes, rode to house they were to be delivered to and started riding home.

The same day a group of young teenagers in their expensive new cars had been down the beach, and decided it was time to come home. Down a long stretch of road they could'nt help themselves, they decided to test their driving skills in a match of speed. 

Unfortunately their driving skills were not good enough to miss my uncle as he started to cross the road on his bike so he could make a turn into the street he lived in. They came tearing around the bend, and with that they hit his bicycle and took him down the street, dragged under their car until they could halt. 

The death of my uncle was just a start to a messy state of affairs he had left behind. Uncle Bill had 4 sisters that his estate would of been divided between. During the year before his death Uncle Bill had a hard time, you see his wife/lover/life long partner had died after a long bout of Alzheimer's. When Aunty Louine died he was devastated. 

During Aunty Louine's last months, a carer was provided in the home to help Uncle Bill cope with his wife's very demanding health needs. This carer started becoming unhealthily involved in all their affairs. The carer was reported to her work place by other carers who felt she was doing the wrong thing, yet when confronted with her actions she was able to defend herself by denying she was doing harm, and as there was no real proof she continued on her merry way.

By the time Aunty Louine had died the carer had control of my aunt and uncles bankcard, which she was using to buy herself $1000 of dollars worth of lingerie, and other items that were purely for her personal use. The carer also talked my uncle who was fairly well off into building a house that she could live in and continue caring for him. 

When my uncle died my aunts who he was living with while his new house was being built went through his papers and other affairs and the picture of what this carer had been doing with his money and other affairs started to become clear. They found his last will and all of a sudden this woman came up with a will written after the date and made by someone who Bill had never dealt with before. That later will was leaving her the new house, much money and other things. 

Uncle Bill had one person do all his wills for most of his business life. My aunts couldn't understand it and went and got themselves a lawyer. so did this carer. This is what ended up being the downfall of the carer.

My mother works for the same company that this carer worked at. Mum had been very distressed and last week she finally went and reported what had been happening to some of the bosses of the company. They were appalled at her story and they arranged a meeting with my aunts. Last Friday afternoon my aunts had a visit from the authorities that dealt with such issues, the meeting went for two hours. My aunts showed them and talked about everything. Thankfully a lot of the information had paperwork to prove what had been happening. The real downfall for the carer was a 6 page letter she had her lawyer write to my aunts that had everything she had done in black and white. This included all the things she had done while she was working and had denied to her employer.

Last night we had a phone call, the carer had been sacked. I think this is just the beginning. She has been reported to higher authorities, she may yet be charged with what she has done...

the start of her just desserts has begun."

"event","i know i get ideas from things i see and hear on the net, telivision, from books, lectures, from everything i do each day.

i don't always acknowledge someones opinion that has affected my train of thought, especially when i have made that opinion mine over a period of time.

yet there are many famous quotations that are used in what we read, and hear everyday. they are ideas that belong to one particular person, that we use in our daily speech(oral and written) to add authority to what we say.

what is your favourite quote? or which quote best describes your passion?

most people are other people.  
their thoughts are someone else's opinions, 
their lives a mimicry, 
their passions a quotation.

with mars being so close to the earth and knowing how much of the skies at night we miss out on due to light pollution i am wondering... 

what do you think of an idea where street lights that aren't on main roads are turned off at say 1am... 

think of it in many ways... 

how much energy would it save? 

do you think we are a society afraid of the dark? 

would society go crazy if street lights were turned off at a certain time? 

do you know anywhere it has happened and it didn't work and they had to switch them back on? why didn't it work? 

would there be more accidents? why??"

On the news tonight there was a cop chase shown on T.V. a young 20 yr old woman was driving along minding her own business and a group of hoods in a stolen car ran red lights and now she is in hospital fighting for her life. They reckon its getting really bad, that the 14-20yr old group especially are taking others people's lives into their hands stealing cars nightly for something to do. So sad..."

so it ring up the cops, they tell ya it was prolly just joy riders taking the car for a spin, you'll prolly get a phone call in a few days telling you to go and pick it up...nice...hopefully not as a burnt out shell

i have car insurance at least...i have to pay the first 250 bucks and they will pay the rest what ever that means...i doubt i will get much for the car. I had the insurance in case i ever hit an expensive car

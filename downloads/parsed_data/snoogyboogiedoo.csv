I'm... I'm alive?

yes. So here's the lowdown:

I graduated high school! yay. 
I still don't have a job, although, I might get a job as a flight attendant. :O
I would probably be in indianapolis for training right NOW but...

i sprained my ankle :D
right after having a tonsillectomy :D:D

yes. I had strep over ten times within the span of a year.
unhealthy?
+ mono

it was a tough senior year. I didn't do nearly as weel as I wanted to, because I missed around thirty days of school. luckily the attendance policies didn't apply to me because I was nineteen so I was really lucky or I wouldn't have walked or received my diploma.

Nick and I are still together! Working on getting jobs and our own places.
hoping to get into Atlanta Institute of Art for Winter semester of '08.

what else...

that's about it, for now."

"event","<P>Yesss... sooo excited. I've finally put my plan into motion, I've got it all rolling around my head and I'm about to go grab my pad and start scribbling.</P>
<P>My plan, you ask?</P>
<P>My comic. It'll be a weekly thing.... okay, well, not weekly, because I'm such an f'ing<STRONG> procrastinator</STRONG> and just don't have the time or resources to do so..<BR>but it'll be a webcomic. And it will be popular and I will have a <STRONG>fan following</STRONG>.</P>
<P>So, what'll it be about, right? Well, zombies, for one thing. And other things that I don't want to reveal. You know, the usual post apocalyptic world type-thing. And, being the <STRONG>self absorbed bitch</STRONG> that I am, I will be the main character. </P>
<P>Well, sorta. she'll look like me, anyway, and have my name and most of my personality traits.</P>
<P>Once I finish the first few pages and they're ready for viewing, I'll post them on DA, and get a keenspace or something. And eventually, I'll be cool enough to do the interactive comic I want to do in Flash. :D </P>
<P>So far, the working title is called <STRONG>The Zombie Slayer. </STRONG></P>
<P>I know I can count on you all to help spread the word once I get the website up. :3 </P>
<P>nyu. I'm so excited. (as if you hadn't caught that already :P)</P>"

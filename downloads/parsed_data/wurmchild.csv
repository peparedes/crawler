"event","So here I am again, planted infront of a computer screen knowing I have ICT coursework to finish, and without the energy to concentrate on it. Sound familiar? The unit is due in on friday, and I still have half a report and alterations to do. My excuse is that Mrs White fried my brain last lesson (Maths. Coursework. Enough said) and Im in no mood to concentrate. So I'm flying around trying to find something worthwhile to do online, and damning the fact I dont have internet on my computer - I could have at least tweaked some of my J the R files for a wee while.
Skirmish is still in pieces, although I did finally ask if there is a game going on on the 2nd (I need to know, considering otherwise five people is NOT enough to paintball) and I'm still wondering if its affordable. 
Off to check my Friends pages..."

"event","A quick update from school, although I dont actually know if anyone reads this anymore anyway. After hannah asking if I've been writing lately, it occured to me that I hadnt touched my A4 pad for quite a while, so I rectified that. It started off rather frustrating, but when I gave up on trying to watch Cold Mountain at 8pm, I ended up sprawled on my floor (after clearing a space from the mess) with my trusty bendy biro. I started on the almost-a-priest-more-of-a-culprit's story, and it wasnt until 1 in the morning that I looked up at my clock and thought that I should probably get some sleep to cope with getting shit from my PE teachers today. I havent reread what I did last night: I dont really want to for fear of 9 A4 pages turning out to be senseless drivel, but I'll have to check it later, so fingers crossed. I need to find my Russian friends and grill them, and I could do with some christian input too *looks beseechingly to see if the christians reading this have any spare time*"

"event","After spending three hours at lakeside trying to avoid buying pajamas (waste of money completely. Theres nothing wrong with an oversided shirt and some random pajama bottoms) last night found me watching Eddy Izzard stand up and laughing at the ""stoned olympics"" reel, then sharing a joint with Tom and Liam, and agreeing with Hannah's opinion on cannabis: that the effects arent really that lifechanging. To be fair we only had the one joint and I was beginning to feel it more later on during the second joint ('happy-sleepy' as Liam called it) when I'd mastered not coughing my lungs up after every inhale and having a conversation about dope ettiquette(sp?), bongs, blunts and so on.
This morning I found out that Im not actually going to the reenactment on saturday, because hannah has to go to some christening thing *rollseyes* so we could have booked paintballing after all. At least its going on in october for definite though.
Got nothing to do until half two, when I leave for chelmsford in search of all things retro for pilchs birthday present, and then onto stephs party."

"event","First time Ive posted on this place, just asking a few questions.
Watching the comments and posts, It looks like the majority of people here are from the USA: how many people on the boards are actually in the UK? Because Im too lazy to go hunt myself down a rules and regulation site, can anyone tell me what the legal age for firearms possesion is in England, or does it depend on the type? Im also interested to know where I would go about finding a firing range (nobody i know has an interest in guns unfortunately), and if was thinking of picking myself up a pistol, what type would you reccommend for a beginner or does it make no difference? Am i better off looking for a Gun show or something similar or buying secondhand?
Cant think of anything else right now..."

Calling my mate Hannah in Cornwall last night, I found out that from midday onwards (and from 9-12 Ill be in the car) ill actually be in sailsbury (or wherever she said) on the 28th of August. So, no paintballing for me. Im currently harrasing people (third time in three days) to find out who still wants to go with only five people and whoever they bring along (sos y'all can have the fun still) and who will take over organising and see if they can make a go of it. And I did have a brilliant idea to organise <i>now</i> to go paintballing in october, but oh <i>no</i> we ""might be going on holiday"" in october. After Ive been told repeatedly we cant afford to go on holiday in october.

"event","For those of you who actually read this thing, I propose a challenge. I need a new surname, because Im bloody fed up of having to spell my current one, or having it mispronounced. So far Liam has decided I change to being Orla Nothing (say it without a break and you get All or Nothing) and I prefer Smith because its boring and easy to spell. (I considered being Orla Interpreted so if i dont marry I'll be Mis(s)Interpreted or Orla Issippi for the hell of being Mrs(s)Issippi if I marry (pppft). For a few minutes I was going to be Axebearer because it sounds violent, but then I figured it was too complicated to spell as well)
Um, yeah basically can anyone come up with a decent surname thats easy to spell and pronounce, or just a plain odd one. I'm off to find out what I have to do to change my name legally. Ciao"

"event","Yesterday was emilys birthday so six of us headed down (or up?) to southend for the day to terrorise ""Adventure Island"", the mini theme park on the coast. Basically it was eight hours of wandering round trying to persuade catherine to come onto most of the rides and in turn making sure we visited close on every ride in the park. I drew the line at the skydrop (and jumped the fence out of the queue) which kept making disturbing explosive hissing noises that completely put me off going on it, but for some unexplainable and insane reason i went on the claw twice, and as katie laughed at my drawn-out expletives (it works better than screaming) and hysterical screaming the second time round when i left the seat entirely for most of the ride (i still dont trust those bloody shoulder restraints) i still managed to keep my breakfast. However ironically stacey lost her tea on the way from pizza hut back to the theme park because we were walking to fast /:)
By the end of it, i had decided that in the new year (knowing me probably around three am on new years day, when im plastered at Hannahs 16th party) im going to start organising the alton tower trip for the end of next summer. this time ill have plenty of time to invite people and make them cough up the cash, lol. The sleepovering bit was uneventful, and after watching one and a half movies everyone else managed to drop straight into sleep while i restlessly ate my way through the travel magasines and a book on australia until god knows what hour. When i woke the first view i had was of a dog heading straight for me, tongue hanging out and intent-on-licking-you look on his face, which shot me straight into a sitting position with a shout of NO! DONT LICK ME! that woke the rest of the room. Fastest ive been awake for a long time.
Spent today wandering round town with hannah and meeting up with simon, one of the guys from my junior school, who wants to get married to my DCs, then coincidentally zoe who i havent spoken to for a year and now hangs with billy joe (i turned her grunger! go me!) who knows hannah... it was a complicated i know her and she knows her and he knows him and she knows him moment (etc) before i had to leave to go hunt down some food. Hannah followed me (and waited for me while i stood in the middle of the shelterless patch of pavement when the rain came pouring down) and we ended up watching Cinderella (it was her choice, honest) of all things. She left about... five minutes ago, and now im going to check my email. Ciao"

So tonight im going to give up finally and give Jim a ring, begging him to come make my internet work for me with lots of free disc thingies. I didnt know dialup internet was so bloody annoying.

In other news, i actually joined the gym the other day (shock horror cue heart attack) and ended up with hannah-from-cornwall joining so she could go with me, and we seem to be spending about two hours a day switching between the pool and the gym. I managed to pull a muscle in my arm rowing too hard, and now i cant straighten it properly, which is quite interesting to navigate when youre trying to swim.
Today was spent mostly attempting to fix my everly dodgy teeth and the learning the important lesson that you should never try to shut your mouth and swallow when you have a suction tube in it because the hygenist is cleaning them. 

And to anyone who actually bothers to read this, what are you doing opn the 26th of August, because im trying to organise a paintballing expedition in billericay. I will get round to phoning all of you about it, I promise, but this is forewarning. And dont use ""i dont want to get shot at"" as an excuse, because ive already dragged two people into it that dont want bruises, and we have to be fair now dont we.

Anyway i need to run and find the price for paintballing. Ciao"

"event","Well well well, back in brentwood library again.

Sooo, I arrived on time, with no major mishaps (gotta be a first) on saturday night (at least, i think it was saturday night. Ive given up on days now) Didnt get up the next day until midday, when liam came barging in back from church yelling ""wakey wakey rise and shine"" (if id been more awake i probably would have battered him) and once i dragged myself into clothes we went shooting. since my darling brother is a qualified air rifle-r (his college course is good for something) it only cost us a fiver for two hours shooting, equipment included. I fucked up the sights twice, which wasnt smart because then all i could hit were the milk bottles (the thriftwood rifle range is very informal, because you pay extras for targets. So everyone leaves old coke cans and beer cans (and dr pepper bottles, which happened to be the only targets i had a 100% hit rate with) and they get lined up on the wooden board. I also managed to hit on of those 35mm camera film cases (the little black one) which was pretty fucking hard to do considering the size of it. I figured that next time that I go down im going to buy a can of coke (or some other cheap fizzy canned beverage) and shake it up for a while so i can see what the result is when you shoot it. we then ended up in basildon to go see harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban, which my mother enjoyed and i sat through trying to text someone.

Today has been pretty spaced out, since ive been awake since about quarter past three and i only went to bed at half one. Im not used to seeing that side of seven oclock anymore, and i ended up reading utter shite. Now it feels like the middle of the evening, and everyone in essex is in school (i think) 

And im running out of time on the computer. I need to persuade mother to get the internet for the summer, because im a lazy arse when it comes to walking to the library. I ended up cycling to thriftwood yesterday and damn i forgot my brother is superfit and i am nothing but a fat blob. I felt like one of those clowns that ride the really really small bikes, because i only have my old bike and i end up ccling with my knees up by my ears half the time.

Right, im going"

Nothing interesting whatsoever has happened, other than the 16th gradually creeping nearer as i watch TV aimlessly and stuff my face. Aaand now im meant to be getting offline. Fuck it."

"event","Another pointless update to add to my list... I have bucketloads of J the R stuff now, the majority of which is utter shite (about 60 pages out of 66 i'd say) and the stuff i think is half decent is (suprise suprise) rather violent. (Hannah I'm blaming this rant on you at the moment :p honestly! telling me that i ""write about murder far too much"" :p) I've concluded that i'm an obsessed nutter with writing thats unhealthily violently explict and gory. I think those were my exact words last night.

AAaaaanyway, I've discovered that I'm only 460 days and 265 pounds short of legally doing my tandem dive in england. And then I'm only 18 jumps and 2 grand short of being a qualified skydiver.

I attempted to get to the air rifle and air pistol St. John SC but my darling father was too pished to drive me, and i couldnt be arsed to walk, what with it starting at 7.30pm and being five miles away and all. And no, I wont shoot you, especially when I dont have a fucking gun. *grumble*

My Work Experience placement is going reasonably well, apart from the being polite to guests part... Laetita's advice was that we have to ""lick their behinds"" (sounds amusing in a french accent too), and I dont bother. But we have an old american dude staying who has a dead sweet accent, and he speaks really... slowly... I think he said he was from Illonis (if that place exists)

My Russian contact also kindly replied to me and sent a list of Russian names and Surnames (saves me time having to make them up, and mine always sound stupid, if only to me) so my killer is no longer ""Jack""... and is now Ipollit (or Ittopet, I cant remember)... doesnt have the same ring to it as Jack lol

Riiiight I'm off to pretend to type up stuff, on maybe find a map of Russia. Ta very much for the deaths, Ky, along with spellcheck :p 
Right, I have to run..."

Thats about all of my news (wow im exciting) barring the fact i now have over 43 pages of J the R stuff, which i was quite amused about, considering half of it is utter crap."

Other than that, not much has happened since i last posted, except my flight is booked for the 17th - someone find out whether there a non uni on the last day of term for you guys, (and whether spontaneous visitors will be thrown out if they dont announce themselves to the office) for me please? - and ive done sod all in the last few days barring draggin myself into school and cycling the wrong way down one way streets (whoever designed the street/road plan for jersey was seriously insane. If you follow the one way system you end up on the other side of town before you can get back to where you started...) to the tune of swearing drivers. Oh, and i spent the last few days typing and writing some of the J the R stuff up. Im still determined to finish what im starting, but the plot may change drastically if i dont forget about it by tomorrow morning.

Come on IT GCSE coursework moderators (or whoever the fuck reads this, delete as appropriate). How do you THINK i produced it? I sat down, stared at the screen, and transfered the thoughts inside my head onto the piece of paper at the printer. What do they want me to do, give them a minute by minute progress? Sorry to dissapoint you, but wierdly enough, considering the hardware i used i (shock horror) <i>TYPED</i> it! 

Sometimes i wonder why i didnt take the hint the first time i failed my IT exam.

[End of school day update]
Does anyone here happen to remember my openfiction account address? Ive stolen my english ""extract"" back to type up because i dont actually have a hard copy of it and i thought it was half decent for a two hour in school moment of creativity. You gotta love english teachers that hand you one of your best subjects on a plate - <i>""i want you to write a short story entitled the assassin...""</i> anyway where was i ... oh yeah i want to send it up on openfiction (gotta start using that thing more often) and i cant remember my goddam account 8-\
Is there anyone with a better memory than me that i actually told?"

Heading downstairs, i discovered it was flooding through our ceiling in the kitchen, lmfao. So i started to watch Donnie Darko only to hear (Joan:)""get orla we have to move everything out of the room"". Turns out the laek was behind my wall, which meant we had to pick eeeeverything up and moved it, computer and desk included. Remantling my computer a few hours later was fun- i managed all of it without <i>that</i> much chaos (my desk only collapsed once!) only to hit the power button and discover i had lost the power lead. After frantic searching, i discovered my oh so helpful father had stacked it neatly in the corner by the power socket- considering thats the opposite side of the room to where i left it, i think i have right for it to have taken me near half an hour to find. Buuut the computer works again, despite the ominious rattling i heard when i picked up the monitior (it didnt make that sound before :-S)"

"event","A few miles from the pentagon, a man watched the broadcast with a faint smile playing on his face. The idiotic president revolted him, but timing was everything to the watcher. He threw the small black box into the air absentmindedly, barely seeing it spin.
 ""-The enemies who struck us are determined and they are resourceful-"" The man caught the box without looking. <i> They are, but the enemies about to strike are <u>much</u> more so</i> 
 Listening carefully, the man retorted to each ridiculous line mentally, snarling with contempt when Bush paused to allow room for the mindless applause. The camera focused on a woman clapping, tears streaming down her face.
 ""-They will be opposed by the United States' Army, Navy, Coast Guard, Air force and Marines-"" Bush wittered on. <i>Let's see them oppose the <u>next</u> disaster!</i> The man stopped throwing the black box in the air, moving one of the switches on it instead. The screen split into two halves, one side showing Bush continuing his mindless gabble, the other hosting a birds eye view of the plan of the pentagon. 17 blue dots flashed on the map, one directly under where the president stood.
 ""-Here in Pennsylvania, and in New York, we honor each name and each life-""
 ""Honour away, Bush. Who knows, maybe the morons will honour you."" the before silent man spoke to the screen, his finger twitching in anticipation of the ending of the speech.
 ""-God Bless."" Bush concluded, and the man flicked the second switch on the black box, with a macabre grin and one word:
 <i>""Boom.""</i>"

"event","*fumes* DAMNIT! i just wrote a relatively long ramble of a journal entry, and itsgone and VANISHED! baaaaaaah >:(

basically the gist of it is that my writing is screwing up comepletely. Im spending too long nitpicking over the lil things (like Neilmeister for example) and im ending up rambling about barely related subject. Im tempted to rip up all 10 A4 pages of the attempt at getting the writing going, and scrap the whole thing. Im wondering if i actually have the attention span to get the whole thing written. Ive been irratating myself over it all day- trying to decide whether to write out the bare bones of it and add in detail after or to write out whatever comes to mind and sort it out after its written. But i may not have the paitience to do either. The stuff i write in the middle of the night is mainly on point, but with school and everything, i dont have the timespan to work that late anymore. Damn all schools and people that work during the day and dont like nocturnalism. Im rambling again arent I. Sod it all."

"event","It amazing how much you can bloody well annoy yerself. Ive pretty much pissed myself off all damn day about the beginning of the terrorism writing thingy. Long debates about whether to write it then chop change and work things out after (or to do it the other way round) have been irratiting me all day, and i stil havent decided. I realised i was rambling rather too much (ten A4 sides is a bit excessive methinks) picking over the fine details of the train crash, when its only a miniscule part of the whole thing. 
I seem to do that a lot, and it reminds me of a random email joan showed me. It was somethign along the lines of a guy filled a jar up with rocks, then asked his students if the jar was full. When they agreed yes, he poured small pebbles into it, which mostly covered the gaps. He asked them if it was full again, and they said yes (again). He proceeded to fill the jar with sand. He asked if it was full (guess what the answer was) and then he poured two cans of beer in. He proceeded to say that the rocks were the importnat things- work, lesuire, family etc, (i cant remember the significane of the pebbles now) and the sand was all the littel things in life, the unimportnat things. If he had filled the jar the other way round, with sand first, then there would be no room for the rocks or the pebbles. This may make no sense whatsoever to people, but i relate it back to my writings and i therefore piss myself off cos by nitpicking the smaller things, i end up missing out the bigger bits and going off on a tangent which is irrelevent over the scheme of things.
Whee im rambling. I neede to sort my ideas out, and finally decide how im gonna sort out the whole thing. Im beginning to wonder if i actually have the patience to get this terorism/powercut thing written. I have too short an attention span :)). Anyway, if ive promised anyone i'd get this done, im taking back my promise of actually haveing anything relevant by the end of the two weeks :)). Later

"event","I swear writing is bad for my sleep patterns. I also swear i get too caught up in the smaled aspects of plots to get the bigger ones written at any speed :)) oh well, tis my writing, who gives a shit. Tis mainly wurmbles anyway. The trouble comes when i try and drag myself away from it to actually sleep. Im built to be nocturnal! Draggin myself out of bed this morning was exhausting in its own right, and tonight we leave for kiltzlan. Well, at least i have a whole two weeks to head back into nocturnalism. And by the end of it may even have something looking vaugely like a plot (shock horror :))) And ill have UK moby access for the first time in roughly two months... i must buy credit sometime. Anyway, its twenny past seven, im bloody freezing cos my window was open all night, and i have no idea why im even posting this entry. Im rambling arent i :-?. I'll vanish before my fingers freeze off. later

"event","kyna, how random can you get? :)) i started writing the beginning of the evans terrorism plotline, and i asked for a character name . So began the existence of Mr. Neil- who has two identities. He live in NYC and england , and is also known as Mr. Warner :)). And now ky has picked out bits of the converstaion and decide to turn it into lyrics :))

damn you kyna, now im wondering 
about neils personality 
damn mental pictures 
five, ten minutes ago, he was clean shave, 
pinstriped grey shuit, fawn hair, darkish eyes
now he has black hair, hes developing a beard. 
wearing a black suit and has blue grey eyes 
not a fully grown bear
stubble methinks 
he has stubble on his chin 

he comes home, drinks too much whisky, sits and plans his next vicitm
serial killers are just rock stars who haven't learned to play guitar
killing is an art form too 
a guitar... 
yeeeeeeeeees he can play the guitar too 
i can picutre him sitting in the dark basement, 
playing the acoustic and humming to himslef 
bottle of whisky next to the chair
his knife collection is in the corner 
long long evil looking blades


blue shirt with his dark grey suit i think, 
not a black one
not a black one after all
his suit jacket is hung on the chair hes sat on
and his sleeves are rolled up
his suit jacket is hung on the chair hes sat on
damn you kyna
damn ye damn ye damn ye ... hes a 
fucking pointless, minimal character
have to play golf to get promoted

i can hear acoustic guitar music 
are you HAPPY kyna? 
now youve got me obsessed over neil?! 


i told her to get the band to write it into a song about five minutes before the first line was part of the convo, and now she wants the whole book to have an OST :)) i refused point blank to do vocals on the grounds that i would be laughing too much to speak if i had to do that. And the plan is to get alex to do illustrations, kiltzman(and roland :)) ) to do the insturments and kei to do the vocals (apparently he sings like a bird :-?). And all that because i asked her if americans carried breifcases :))"

"event","Sian called me 'boring' yesterday, which pretty much cracked me up. Somehowe the conversation got onto marriage, and i pointedly and firmly said 'marriage is pointless' which led to an EVEN LONGER conversation about why marriage is pointless. I countered every single reason Sian gave, which irrated the hell outta her, and amused me. Then somehow the conversation switched onto advent calender i mean... what sthe connection there? but anyway, i started laughing, and sian goes 'what?' and im just like 'im resisting theurge to say that advent calenders are pointelss too' and she goes 'they ARENT' and so i pointedly said. 'so give me one good reasons why to have advent calenders. That stumped her >:) it was followed by 'christmas is pointless' 'birthdays are pointless' and several other things that i cannae remember now. I pity em sometimes- they live in a carefree world, where they dont bother about the point of things. My new motto is 'life is pointless' , and after sian declared that i was 'boring' because i didnt do anything, i just started laughing. Then she randomly decided that by the time i left state school i'd be into parties and birthdays and christmas. I asked her if she wanted toe put a bet on that - i need the cash. I think she took the hint. Boring is not a word i'd use to describe myself... antisocial, stubborn and damn weird, yes , but not boring :))"

"event","My current theory on knowledge is that if you talk fast and use long words, people assuem ye know what yer going on about :)) Ive had that experience three or four times already - all in yesteray. Starting off wuith science where i was enthusiasticaly nitpicking hazards about burning things, folowed by maths, which was hilarious cos the teacher goes 'and ORLA does it this way' and i'd been sketcing aimlessly while she talked and i just went 'oh, shit what have i done now?' lmfao... she reminded me of cousins when she emphasized my name :)) and then yesterday evening talking to joan. Joan has worked with computers for longer than i have been alive, and she handed hers over to me because 'i appeared to know more about what i was talking about' my comment was 'joan, i wouldnt say that- i probably know lessabout what im doindg thatn you do :))'
On the writing front, I finally gave up on structure last night and started picturing people. So, i have no structure, but i have a character- totally useful that :))) Ive been spending the last few days thinking through what exactly would happen if i cut the power over all of NA. I still havent got through my list of things to find out, after about an hour of bouncing ideas off of kyna on yahoo messenger. Im trying to work out at the moment how to get rid of the army headphones.. kyna, come ONLINE! I still dont understand exactly what you were going on about! :)) Maybe i culd look it up online :-?... im off to google.

"event","last night was... interesting to say the least. for the first time since god-knows-when my brain was thinking over past ideas on storylines and the such. im surprised i slept at all- after spending the entire day pretty much dead with exhaustion, i collapsed onto my bed and removed everything except my music from my current mind, and instantly i was plagued with ideas and questions. i gave up trying to silence them after about an hour, and dug out a pencil lead (lol- its bloody difficult writing when you left yer pencils at school!) and started brainstorming across the anarchy and power cut thoughts that kyna reminded me of during the day. i'd forgotten what i meant by the silent hours of creativity. the only problem was the complete lack of actual storyline :)) im not one to write something that has a plot usually- just extracts, which annoys the hell outta me... anyone care to help me on this issue?  anyway, i realised after a while that unfortunately i had school tommorrow, and was still wide awake, brain working better than it had for the last week or so. damn my nocturnal thinking. and i can truly sympathise with kyna- i agree school kills creativity. there was no way i neede sleep at that time, but i knew that i'd end up falling asleep during school hours, which would get me into a hell of a lot of trouble with dad. so i attempted to clear my head and stop writing, and sleep. fat chance :)) i got up about an hour later and changed music to something slightly less heavy (korn is not good brain unwinding music ive discovered) and even then it took me a god few hours to sleep. waking up this morning, i was so tired i managed to hit myself over the head with a cupboard door twice :)) (dont ask me how, please) and now... i can feel myself beginning to wake up. im going back to brainstorming.

apparently for all my journal helps i could well be dead. unsurprising considering the fact that nothing i particularly have an urge to type has happened lately. and im not going to ramble either.

we had english first thing today, and turns out that the piece of writing on oursleves (that i should have done and wrote next to nothing for) was actually coursework for the GCSE, unlike a random piece of work as i had hoped. great. just when i thought i could get away with it, it turns out im gonna get chased up again about it. arse.

anywa, i cant be arsed to writa anything else."

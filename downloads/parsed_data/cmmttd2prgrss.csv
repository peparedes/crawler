"event","I just watched the movie ""The Secret"". I love the ideas in there. The law of attraction is amazing. I believe it. Quantum physics is fascinating. I am making it possible to live my life to its full potential. It makes me want to share the ideas with other people. I realized today that the way I contribute to the world is by sharing what I learn with others. I am good at talking and being persuasive. I want to use it for good and be socially conscious. I love life. I am constantly amazed by the universe. The possibility that I am creating for myself and my life is the possibility of being grateful, compassionate, trusting, loving, generous and authentic."

The possibility that I want to create for myself in my life is the possibility of being committed to writing in my journal at least 5 times a week. I know I will learn a lot about myself by doing this and I'm committed to it. I want to do amazing things with my life and this is just the beginning!"

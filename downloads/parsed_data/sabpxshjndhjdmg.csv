"event","apparently according to some random book im reading i should better appropriate my emotional venting before i have to go to the 'sylum. so anyway. this will be the first of many... dedicated to a part of me i dont like showing - after all i am a filipino male: entitiling me to some bi-polar tendencies, if not a dissociative identity disorder. yeah this lj has been ""alive"" for a while yet has not actually served a purpose of any kind. but here it will begin to! woe is you. if i offend you in any way shape or form, fuck you. maybe thisll be labled for ""emo uriel"". whatever it becomes i think ill keep the consistency in venting on lj under lock and key.. if you wanna read something more interesting, look under my xanga for whatever the hell i use it for.

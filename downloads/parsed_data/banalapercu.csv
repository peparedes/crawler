"event","I don't know if this marks my triumphant return to livejournal after several months absence, but it probably does.  

I will be in Portland starting tomorrow until the 13th of the month of Augustus.  I am hoping to take a several day trip up to Seattle whilst on said excursion and depending on the vagaries of homeland security and friends in the area may even attempt to visit the great gray north.  (I was going to attempt a 54-40 or bust pun in there but thought the better of it.)

I've emailed some people about said trip, but I'm sure I've missed some.  If you live in any of these three areas and want to see me, drop me a line.  I think this may be my last extended visit to the northwest- after this one, I fear that any further trips will be under a week unless I end up relocating back there.  

I suspect that once I am in a location where I can get online without having to either lug my computer out to the living room and lose all privacy or hijack my mother's computer and lose even more, I'll be online more.  In other words, I may post while in PDX, but my triumphant return is now scheduled for some time after August 17th."

And one more thing.  A copy of <i>Maya</i> by Jostein Gaarder.  I had a copy, I read it, but it had to make its own way in the world.  you know how these things are.  

I'll probably be quoting bits of <i>Maya</i> for a little bit now.  His books always do that to me.  

If you haven't read anything by Gaarder, start with <i>The Solitaire Mystery</i>.  Then read anything but <i>Sophie's World</i>.  It's a good book, but aimed at perhaps a slightly younger audience and if you've had even one class in philosophy, parts of the book with probably boor you.

"event","So I decided that I really don't want anything from anyone for Christmas.  Instead, I'd rather receive birthday gifts, celebrating my existence for a quarter of a century, or perhaps, my fifth square birthday (thanks for the idea Jenn).  No one is obligated to get me anything off this list, but if you do, I'd be greatful.  I'm also planning on sending people books of all the photos that have them in them or are relevant, but that will take some time to do.  

Before the list, what'd I'd really appreciate is contact info for people who are under an hours drive away from where I am.  This includes people in Athens.


If you don't have that and you want to support me being a materialistic bastard, here's the list of stuff that I think is cool:
<lj-cut text=""The List, in no real particular order"">
My two front tweeth.

A super towel, the type that are made of really super absorbent fabric to dry hair with.

A dress hat.  One that can go with a suit. The type that requires a hat box. This would require some serious time with me at a haberdashery or a nice department store (Nordstroms, etc.) so I'm not really expecting anyone to do this, but if they could, I'd be very grateful.

A nice knit hat.  If you intend to do this, let me know, I'll get head measurements to you.  This would be something I'd be expecting next winter season if someone says they'll do it.  Given that I've lost one (along with a gortex jacket, but I miss the hat more than the jacket), multiples are cool.

An xkcd shirt.  Especially the Science: It works Bitches shirt and the Just Shy shirt.  I take a L or XL.

The Math is Delicious shirt from QC.  But the xkcd shirts are cooler.  

Books: 
Through a Glass, Darkly by Jostein Gaarder
The Christmas Mystery by Jostein Gaarder
A book by Christopher Priest that is not The Prestige or The Space Machine.
Fables: 1001 Nights by Bill Willingham
Cows by Matthew Stokoe (expensive, out of print, but I'd love to get this)
Altered Carbon by Richard Morgan

DVDs:
No Map for These Territories by William Gibson
The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou (Criterion Collection would be really cool)
Lost in Translation
Space Above and Beyond: The Complete Series

A subscription to Dwell magazine.

"event","There's a term that's been used for oil companies and other big polluters running ads about how they now love the cute little bunnies who are in the forest and wouldn't do anything to hurt them while at the same time not cleaning up their act.  It's called greenwashing.

I'd like to introduce a new term, inspired by bristol-myers squibb.  Redwashing.  Red has been used in recent years as a color to bring awareness of various health problems, most notably, AIDS, heart disease and breast cancer.  Bristol-Myers Squibb will donate a total of $100,000 to National AIDS Fund.  I'd like to cite a couple of numbers at you about BMS:

Global Sales: $19.2 Billion (source <a href=""http://newsroom.bms.com/index.php?s=home"">here</a>)

2005 Salary of CEO Peter Dolan: $41 Million (source <a href=""http://moneycentral.msn.com/content/P125120.asp"">here</a>)  This does not include any extra benefits, including stock options, etc. that he may have received.

Net Earnings (Profit) of BMS for the first 9 months of 2006: $1.7 Billion (source <a href=""http://www.bms.com/irdocs/3q06earn.pdf"">here</a> (Note, this is a PDF))

Finally, I would note <a href=""http://www.frizzylogic.org/archives/000850.html"">this</a> blog entry from last year.  Items of note:
1.) In 1999 BMS blocked the production of generics for both AIDS drugs and cancer drugs in Thailand.  (Source: <a href=""http://www.globaltreatmentaccess.org/content/press_releases/99/112999_AU_PR_DC_action.html"">here</a>)
2.) In 2003 BMS payed $670 Million in penalties for delaying the production of taxol (a cancer medicine) as a generic for 4 years  and BuSpar (an anti-anxiety drug) for 4 months.  (Source <a href=""http://www.mainecahc.org/coalition/articles/Pharmaceutical%20Company%20to%20Pay%20Settlement%20of%20$670%20Million.htm"">here</a>.)

$100,000.  With sales like that, they could donate that much each week and still make a billion dollar profit.  

And Light to Unite is now down.  Something tells me they hit their quota.

I wish I had Aykan's skills.

\end{rantmode}

Sorry to clutter up your friends page with this, but I thought it might be useful to see this in action.  Also, I'm trying to invent a new word!  Or at least descriptive term."

"event","So I was sent a link: <a href=""https://www.lighttounite.org/"">here</a> where they donate a dollar for every person who lights the candle today.  It's done by one of the giant pharmaceutical companies and the national AIDS foundation.

And I couldn't help think of <a href=""http://www.theregister.co.uk/2001/01/10/the_reg_brings_you_more/"">this</a> short story by China Mieville.  Mieville is one of my favorite authors, I first read this story in a collection of his, and was lucky to find it online.  And while I lit the candle, I can't help feel just a little like the narrator.  I understand Aykan's view on that site is, about corporate whitewash, etc. and I can't help but feel that there is a point there.  

(Although the story is really about something very similar to <a href=""http://www.thehungersite.com/cgi-bin/WebObjects/CTDSites"">The Hunger Site</a>, this feels the exact same.)

Thoughts?

Edit: Independent of all this, I think I may have some vague idea of what Aykan was planning as his ultimate move, but I'm really unsure.  If anybody has any ideas, I'd love to here them."

"event","So I bought the first part of what I anticipate will be my summer reading- all the books on teaching that I should read before I start teaching.

The list:

<i>The Red Pencil</i> by Theodore Sizer
<i>Horace's Compromise ibid.</i>
<i>Horace's School ibid.</i>
<i>Horace's Hope ibid.</i>
<i>What to Look for in a Classroom</i> by Alfie Kohn

There are more authors to read besides these two, but this is what Powell's had when I went tonight.  I'll probably post more when I start reading these.  But first, sleep."

"event","So tonight was Curry night.  And it was good.  I used paste from the tub instead of a pre-measured tin, and I didn't use enough, but it was still wonderful.  I cooked the chicken for 35 minutes in coconut milk and it was falling apart (in a good way) when I ate it.

And now I have four meals of Panang Curry in my fridge.

So I'm thinking of holding a Curry party.  I can do Panang, Red, Yellow and Green Curries.  And I'd make either the green or yellow curry vegetarian, as those don't have shrimp paste in them.  There'd be lots of food, and it'd be good food.

I figured out the secret is to use just a touch of Galangal, as it can get overpowering as it did with my last curry.  (Although Jess says that powered Galangal smells like yellow mustard.)  And adding chopped up birds-eye chilies was wonderful.

I will make my own curry paste by the end of the summer.  I just need shrimp paste.

Anyway, so if I did do a curry party, who is interested?  Each curry generally is enough to serve four people, so I'd either be feeding a small army or people would be taking home lots of leftovers.

I should try this with fish next- probably a whitefish, but a solid one.  Tuna, or Swordfish, or something else that will give me my recommended mercury dose for the next six years.

I need to learn to make Indian food."

I'm planning on doing a unit on induction (easy to explain, I can use both triominoes and the oracle problem, can start easy and work up depending, etc.).  But I'm not sure where to start with induction.  So, how many people had heard of the concept of induction (the mathematical one, not the physical one) by their junior/senior year of highschool.  If you don't know what induction is, please let me know that too.

Thanks for your help."

I think it was a flea- it was blackish blue, small, and jumped out of my fingers when I pulled pulled it out of my beard to see what it was.

Question- I have never had to deal with this sort of thing before- what do I do?  I did some web searching on that sort of thing, but I don't know how serious it is, or even now if what I saw was a flea.  

I think I will ask Amy to get her cat a flea collar in the least.  This is something I really don't want to have to deal with, but will if I have to.  I'm just glad the cat doesn't go into my rooms."

   This is my thesis.  There are many like it, but this one is mine.  It is my life.  I must master it as I must master my life.  Without me my thesis is useless.  Without my thesis, I am useless.  My thesis is human, even as I am human, because it is my life.  Thus, I will learn it as a brother.  We will become part of each other. 

The second, well, because the first got me thinking:
""I must not procrastinate. Procrastination is the mind-killer. Procrastination is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my procrastination... And when it is gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the procrastination is gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain."""

They're afraid I also fractured one of the small bones in my wrist and it's hard to tell immediately after it happens.  I am doing ok, having been given 800mg pills of ibuprofin and some smaller dose of vicadin.  I'm currently on the ibuprofin and slightly drunk, so I'm not taking the vicadin for a while.

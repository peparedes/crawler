"event","Ok, so after moments of randomness and all that, I&nbsp;feel relatively sane. Sometime this afternoon, I&nbsp;decided to check out my blog archives, around the same time of the year, in the past. I&nbsp;kept praying it wouldnt be a depressing entry, and no, they were not. <br /><br />2007 - This is a private entry I&nbsp;had written. It coincidently mentions the ex boyfriend, but its something I&nbsp;was feeling at that time. Another entry around the same time mentions om shanti om being an awesome film, and me wondering what the hell am I&nbsp;doing in Au. <br /><br />2006 - There are NO entries in nov. I&nbsp;havent really written a lot since I&nbsp;moved here, and there are many reasons for this, mainly because I&nbsp;am a lot busier managing my own house and get tired easily. <br /><br />2005 - <a href=""http://eh-donia.livejournal.com/55926.html"">This</a> is a friends only post, but I&nbsp;am talking about a random boy who met me when I was at work, and he hit on me. Flattering today, as&nbsp; I&nbsp;did not even remember this happened. :-)&nbsp;Reading the comments was nice as well... I&nbsp;miss all you lj people.<br /><br />2004 - <a href=""http://eh-donia.livejournal.com/2004/11/15/"">This</a> is the best entry of them all! A model, who I&nbsp;think is gorgeous said she thought I was pretty. Woohoo. <br /><br />I&nbsp;noticed my current mood, and it made me think. From happy and bored, I&nbsp;have moved towards depressed and scared very often lately. I&nbsp;know that a lot of it is hormones and events that have happened in my life over the years, but it is NO&nbsp;reason for me to not feel pretty anymore. So what if I&nbsp;am fat now, and dress more conventionally. I cannot let the eclectic get away, ever. I&nbsp;used to be a gorgeous head turner, and I&nbsp;guess that girl has got lost somewhere inside me. <br /><br />So amongst my moments of sadness, I&nbsp;hope to remember this entry, and maybe re-read it in a few years and remember the promise I&nbsp;made to myself. I&nbsp;am gorgeous, and will remain so. I&nbsp;am a good person and I&nbsp;make people smile. I&nbsp;am a good loyal friend, and will always be one. <br /><br />I&nbsp;am, Ruchi, still the same person you know. <br /><br />"

Feels different not ranting, but good. <br /><br />A lot has happened in the last month. Most of it was not good news, but I&nbsp;have learnt to deal with it, block it out if need be, and move on. <br /><br />To start with, my sister in law (my brothers wife) delivered a baby girl on the 15th of Sep. My niece, Stuti, is gorgeous and I&nbsp;cannot wait to see her in Feb when I&nbsp;go back to India for a visit. A day later, both&nbsp;my sister in laws kidneys failed.&nbsp;I&nbsp;honestly dont know how it happened, but I&nbsp;have heard, ARF, or acute renal failure is fairly common. She was in the ICU&nbsp;and the hospital for a month before she came home, and saw the baby. At the moment, she is on the dialysis machine every alternate day... and we are hoping it will be reversed sometime soon. <br /><br />I&nbsp;was upset, depressed, angry and jealous. I&nbsp;was just jealous of everyone there who was involved, and helping out. I&nbsp;was all alone here, and not needed physically there. My parents specifically told me not to go back now and only in feb. Sigh!&nbsp;I&nbsp;know where they are coming from, so I&nbsp;cant even be mad. I&nbsp;am only hoping she gets better soon and continues with her normal life.... I've started shopping now for Stuti and little kids clothes are sooo cute!&nbsp;<br /><br />Somewhere in the last month, my husband has been <span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ansi-language: EN-AU; mso-fareast-language: EN-AU; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA"">diagnosed with an eye condition called central serous retinopathy. According to wikipedia &ndash; it is a </span><span lang=""EN"" style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ansi-language: EN; mso-fareast-language: EN-AU; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA"">visual impairment, often temporary, usually in one eye, mostly affecting males in the age group 20 to 50 but which may also affect women. The disorder is characterized by leakage of fluid in the central macula, which results in blurred or distorted vision. A blind or gray spot in the central vision is common, along with flashes of light. Sigh!&nbsp;It could be stress induced, so yeah, not stressing anymore. He also lost his job, randomly if I&nbsp;may add, 3 days ago.. but he NOT&nbsp;stressing this time. He has already been for two interviews, and is going to get something in a week. His MBA term and his photography term is almost over so he is more relaxed, and as a result, I&nbsp;am more relaxed. <br /><br />About me. I have had the flu and&nbsp;laryngitis, and resulting weakness for a couple of weeks. Depression is easy as I&nbsp;am on the pill now and I&nbsp;have to work very very hard to keep it at bay. For the first time in my life, I have said no to going out for movies. </span><br /><br />On the positive side, I have been dancing a lot. Had a couple of gigs in the past two months, and am teaching a six week course at <a href=""http://www.cae.edu.au/?course=HWO080"">CAE</a>. Its going pretty well I think. Woohoo!&nbsp;Dancing definitely lifts me up.. so thats a good thing, right?! <br /><br />And lastly, am alone for Diwali for the first time in my life. Its just hubby and me. I&nbsp;want to be more enthusiastic and light up every part of my house. Maybe I will. I&nbsp;am not going to be bogged down by anything today!&nbsp;</p>"

My mom. 
My husband. 
Tarla Dalal. 

Mom. She tried to teach me to cook ever since I can remember. Make tea, coffee, rotis, cut vegies, blah blah. And I always rebelled. Thinking I was not going to make a traditional marriage where the girl cooked. 

And then I moved to Au. Mom had written a simple recipe cookbook for my brother when he had moved overseas for sometime. And I took the same book here. It greatly improved my Gujarati reading abilities cause most of the recipes are written in Gujarati. 

Being a practising Jain, there is not much I can eat and so I started cooking the easy recipes first. Cabbage, peas, dal, rice. Then I started making rotis. Perfect round rotis... thankgod for the practice earlier! Koftas, Dhoklas from scratch, idlis from scratch and just other stuff I cant remember right now. Thank God for me Ma! 

The husband. This gorgeous man has been cooking long before me, and I am SO SO SO lucky I married him. Touch wood. He makes me the worlds best pasta (many types), nachos, fajitas, burritos, enchiladas, spicy noodles and banana milkshake. I help, but he makes. And I learn, but I dont cook when he is in the kitchen. Cause he ROCKS! :P 

Tarla Dalal. 
Amongst all the recipe books I own (about 5), my fav ones are the Tarla Dalal cook books -- cooking in 10 mins, and Jain International Recipes. Pretty good variations of nice worldly stuff... My fav recipe is the mushroom-capsicum veggie and the kali dal. 

And I know I am not a bad cook. Kudos to all three! :D"

Tea (Made with Indian tea leaves)
Put half a cup of water to boil. 
Add some ginger, 2tsp of sugar and 1tsp of tea leaves in it and let it boil. 
Once the water is boiling, add 3/4 cup of milk to it. 
Keep stirring till it boils. 
Strain it and pour it in a cup.

Happiest when I hold onto the days gone by and my memories with you. Late night phone converastions, early morning messages, group chats, compliments, when you told me you liked me. I am not vain. I just feel loved and pure enough that I too have loved you back. I missed you. I still miss you. You might not know how lonely I can be. You might not know the importance of friendship which is realized only when one is away from everything one has loved, liked, wanted, known and lost.&nbsp;
You might not think about me anymore. You might think I am gone far away.. thrown in my world of matrimony and things which you are far away from. You might not even know what you mean to me.&nbsp;
But i can only say that I am almost alive today, and I smile sometimes when I think of the way you made me feel.&nbsp;
Thank you.&nbsp;

For most of you on my eljay.&nbsp;"

They loved Melb and Au and loved to see me, my new house.&nbsp;<br /><br />And now, my house just feels so barren. I have never cried so much before. Not in my wedding and not when I left Mumbai. And this time its like some dam has broken loose. I howled at the airport when I saw my dad, I cried at multiple times yesterday throughout and was walking around like a zombie around the house this morning.&nbsp;There was no mom and there was the extra food she has cooked and stored in the fridge.&nbsp;Enough to make the dam break again.&nbsp;</p><p>I love (my) parents. They are the most wonderful people in the whole wide world. (Siblings and partners come&nbsp;close but not close&nbsp;enough!!)<br /><br />I dont want to be this vulnerable. I know I love them enough but I dont want to cry when the leave and when they are not with me. I get scared of being so emotional. But then this is life. Attachment, love, feeling and all these emotions are a part of life. And my aim is to move beyond them. I believe I am happiest within myself. I only need to practice that belief more often! </p><p>In the mean time, partir, c'est mourir un peu... (parting, is to die a little).... and I could not agree more.&nbsp;</p>"

"event","So since two days we are getting calls for some telephone shit - telstra and optus and blah blah. Obv they are call centre people from India. Common knowledge right? <br /><br />The interesting thing is this -- the first girl who called yesterday asked me my name. As I was expecting this recruiter to call I gave her my name (thinking these people never get Indian names) and this girl who calls herself Julie. She then tells me she is calling from Sydney and her sisters name is Ruchi too. She then asks me if I am from India and which city I am from. I politely told her she didnt need to know that and hung up. She then called back in a couple of hours and asked to speak to my husband. He spoke to her and hung up. <br /><br />Today I get another call from the same company and this dude who had no idea which accent he was supposed to imitate (confused btwn the Indian, American, British and Australian) he tells me the same scheme. Polite as ever, i said Ive spoken to someone already from his firm and I cant help him. This dude then tells me I have a nice name and asks me if I am Indian (wtf)... and if I am from Delhi or Bbay (is that all India is made up of?)... And then HE STARTS TALKING TO ME IN HINDI. (omg!)<br />I was laughing by then bec this guy refuses to hang up. So I was like, yeah, bbay... and then I asked him where he is from. So he tells me, this little place in Gujarat called Ahmedabad (small city? moron?)... <br />I finally hung up saying hope the weather is fine in Gujarat. <br /><br />Arent these guys supposed to atleast pretend they are from Australia? Atleast that was the way in my time! (Read: 3 years ago when we graduated and everyone I knew was working in a call centre)... Are they specifically targetting the Indian market? Picking out names which sound Indian. Do these guys tactlessly call up Sri Lankan and other neighbouring country people living overseas and pretend to be their best friends and talk in Hindi? Is no one monitoring their calls? What has the world come to!! But its definitely amusing for a bored housewife!! <br /><font size=""1""><br />ps: new userpic. yay. </font>"

It haunts me randomly during the day. I have moved on, but then there is a moment, when I stop, think, and cant believe he is gone. The last I remember is when they all came to see me off at the airport. I try and think how death would be in the final moments of someone. The heart attack, the pain. Does someone realize this is it? Or they are only trying and thinking that it will be ok. <br />I hope I can remember my faith in my final moments. Its all a struggle to live, isnt it really. I went for a discourse today (found some Jains in Melbourne, yay!!) and he said, whats the one thing we dont need to teach a baby? Its food. The struggle to live..."

They were quite friendly actually. And it was really really nice to finally see them cause sometimes I think thats all people ask me.. have I seen Kangaroos yet! <br /><br />The first time I saw dolphins! All along, I have seen them on tv and loved them... (And I am NOT talking about aquariums.. actually not even sure if I have ever seen them there) ... So I saw wild dolphins, and that too, from the beach. We were one of the beaches there.. and suddenly my friend spotted them playing in the water not further than 60m from us. It was just, beautiful. You'd think we would have to go out in a boat to see them at sea further away... but this was AT THE BEACH. <br /><br />The first time I saw an Australian poisonous snake -- So after seeing the roos and the dolphins (lets throw in some nice birds and a 6ft huge termite mound that was seen along the way).. husband tells me that the only thing left for me to see is a snake. And the very next minute I saw the red bellied black snake! <font size=""1""><i>(<a href=""http://www.users.bigpond.com/neen105/Snake2.htm"">pic courtesy</a>)</i></font><br /><img width=""150"" height=""98"" border=""4"" align=""right"" src=""http://www.users.bigpond.com/neen105/images/Red%20Bellied%20Black%20Snake.jpg"" alt="""" /><br />It was also the first time I was supposed to go swimming in the sea (I am the kid whose mother never allowed her to go to Goa).

(Jain bbq food consists of eggplant, capsicum, zucchini and tomatoes.. and its divine!) I am going to try the paneer tikka next time. <br /><br />And this is the coolest thing. When we were driving back, I learnt of a cool thing drivers do here. If they see a cops car by the side of the road waiting to pounce on some unsuspecting speeding idiots, they flick their headlights once to the person coming from the other side, to warn them! I am quite fascinated with this sign language! Interesting na?"

And I am aware of my uncles sudden death but am smiling now. I will always miss him and I now know what I need to do for my own spiritual well being. 
And since morning I have heard a lot of varied music - not necessarily from my personal faith. 
1. Dev Vandan - my morning ritual (Jainism)
2. Hanuman Chalisa (Hinduism) - many times over
3. Kabir by Abida &amp; some more Sufi music (Sufi and Bhakti) 
4. Shree Ganesh Aarti (From vaastav - I love this version) 
5. Swaminarayan aarti and other bhakti songs - which I stumbled upon suddenly from wiki. 
6. Oh, and I was humming some hymns I remember from school on my way back from the supermarket. 

I love everything! Definitely on a high."

"event","Happy new year to all folks. <br /><br />Rewinding back on 2006, and reading India Today, this item caught my eye. <br /><i>Luxury became a lovely word in 2006, with more and more international          brands making an appearance in India, and even the middle-class aspiring          to flaunt a Gucci and a Fendi. The rise of the new affluent in India saw          ceos and presidents under the age of 40. The retail sector saw the emergence          of new players and entrepreneurs in all fields. Add to that the return          of prodigal NRIs to where they belonged. From Bernard Arnault to Francois          Pinault, no name in luxury now seemed alien. Society ladies from Kalyani          Chawla to Sheetal Mafatlal started representing brands (Dior and Valentino          respectively) even as the Louis Vuitton store in Delhi became something          of a store-stopper. Add to that a clutch of new magazines-some on newstands,          others on the anvil-and it was no wonder that a KSA Technopak survey this          year showed that there were about 1.6 million households in India earning          over Rs 40 lakh annually. These spent over Rs 4 lakh on an average on          luxury goods and services, giving India a potential market of Rs 65,000          crore, due to see a 14 per cent annual growth. The survey also mentioned          that the Indian had a long way to go to be totally 'luxuriented'. But          hey, it's a start.<br /></i><br /> May 2007 bring in a lot of that cash mentioned in the article to everyone... hehehe.... <br />I miss India. A lot. Sigh."

"event","Ya. So. I am a diasporic Indian. Living as an Indian, brown in colour, speaking great English, Hindi, Gujarati and bits of Marathi. I watch Hindi cinema in the theatre and buy everything I need from the Indian shop. I value $2 coriander and make chutney with it. I live in Au as I am, a mix of cultures and try to adapt to the best of everything. I have personalized my history and where I come from. Like I told a friend the other day -- if I miss Bombay or not, I said, I can now hold onto the parts of the city I love, and I dont have to deal with the clogged drains everytime it rains and I dont need to deal with the heat in Nov (when I left it last) and I dont need to deal with the million people driving at all times of the day. I can now remember fort, and colaba, and bandra and think about how I missed going to 'shiro' when every person from the age of 40 to 18 told me 'I MUST GO THERE'...   <br /><br />  Yes, my history is personalized. Like they taught me in college. Will I now appreciate Indian writing in English? Over the years I have avoided these novels. The ones I did manage to read, were crap, with a few exceptions. Will I now get myself to read Shalimar the Clown and the Inheritance of Loss? I had hated hullabaloo in the guava orchard except the part when the dentures fall in the curry or some such thing... <br /><br />I am now teaching Bollywood Dancing here. Reminds me of the time we had filed a story on Masala Bhangra in NY at CNBC and we were laughing seeing the <i>gori  </i> girls dance to it and thought it was so cute. And here I am. The world is opening up to Bollywood and we can see the influence in theatre, cinema, radio, food, clothes, and the kolhapuri chappals. Chhamma chhamma in Moulin Rouge and Farah Khan choreographing Shakira. The world is grooving. And I am learning to be comfortable with where I am. Except the fact that I am what I had never understood. It is an overwhelming feeling. <br /><i><br />An excerpt from wikipedia --  Bollystan: The Global India As the Indian government's own Singhvi commission notes, ""the sun never sets on the Indian diaspora."" Yet the cultural transmission model is rapidly transforming from a one-way street, in which the Motherland gives and the diaspora receives, to a two-way street, in which the diaspora is as confidently Indian, sometimes more so, than India itself. Bollystan (""Bolly-"" for Bollywood, and ""Sthan"", the Sanskrit suffix for ""land"" comprise this term) is a ""Neologism"" which recognizes this changing balance of power between the home country and its diaspora. Technology has enabled the diaspora to manufacture ""Indian-ness"" as competently as their home-bound relatives through film, dance, music and even religious practices.<br /><br /></i>I am now living in the Bollystan?! :D"

"event","Life is tough. I mean fucking tough. 

We first heard about the blasts when Mehul's sister called us at 6am today morning. Mehul woke me up saying there were 7 blasts in Mumbai and thats all he knew. And I woke up immediately, a panic in my heart, my stomach all contracted and everything. He had no more information to give me except that our families were safe. 

I immediately logged on and read through the million emails that had appeared over night (this includes the dozen orkut messages) and then the blogs and the news websites. And I was in shock. This is the first time that something like this happened in my city and I wasnt around. And that feeling of helplessness is not a good feeling. Thank god my family and friends were safe. What if they were not? What if something HAD happened to the dozen friends who take the train back home from Andheri etc every single day. My in-laws were at Malad station two hours prior to the blasts. And they got off at Matunga road. Hell. 

I saw tv and relied on emails and sms's sent out. And I felt like shit. I felt that this world was a horrible place indeed and all my Jungian notions crashed in a second. And I missed home, tv (even the fucked up Star news that I detest) and CNBC. I have to admit I am mortified by Rajdeep Sardesai's comment about his channel... It is shameful.  

And then it dawned on me that its always going to be like this. I am always going to worry here hoping that nothing goes wrong with everyone home. And I am always going to be away from home that is bombay. 

Australian TV reported the blasts and news and showed footage from all channels - Times now, India TV, Aaj Tak, Star news... and then they showed a map of India segregating POK and the rest of India. I was mortified. Why didnt I know that the rest of the world recognized POK?

I am depressed. And I feel for those men who were in the first class compartments returning from a days work in some nice place. I hate being here when all my friends are there. But I am thankful for the internet and various blogs. Thankgod for  Mumbaihelp @ blogspot and Peter Griffin and all those people who make this possible. After 26 July last year, the website helps again. 

Hope everyone is ok. I love you all."

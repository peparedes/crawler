"event","Salary Raise


I, the Penis, hereby request a raise in salary for the following reasons: 
I do physical labor. 
I work at great depths. 
I plunge head first into everything I do. 
I do not get weekends or public holidays off. 
I work in a damp environment. 
I work in a dark workplace that has poor ventilation. 
I work in high temperatures. 
My work exposes me to contagious diseases. 

Dear Penis, 
After assessing your request, and considering the arguments you 
have raised, the administration rejects your request for the following 
reasons:
You do not work 8 hours straight. You fall asleep after brief work periods. 
You do not always follow the orders of the management team. 
You do not stay in your designated area and are often seen 
visiting other locations. 
You do not take initiative - you need to be pressured and 
stimulated in order to start working. 
You leave the workplace rather messy at the end of your shift. 
You don't always observe necessary safety regulations, such as 
wearing the correct protective clothing. 
You will retire well before you are 65. 
You are unable to work double shifts. 
You sometimes leave your designated work area before you have 
completed the assigned task. 
And if that were not all, you have been seen constantly entering 
and exiting the work place carrying two suspicious-looking bags. 
Sincerely, 
The Management"

"event","The power that i have in me could possible be the one thing that could say the world in the future to come. But i really don't know i been told i have to go on the journy alone and find out who i am to find out what the power i have in me is. But in everything that i have seen in my mind tells me that i am supposed to do this with people and not on my own all the time.But ya when i did try it on my own i did see more thing.other then when i was with more people. SO it actually could be ture that i am stronger when i am on my own other then when i am with people. So what is for us as human to come. Thats is even if i am human. I really don't know what i am. I don't class myself with the humans on this world. Not even with the people that think there are half animals to. I think i am more then both of them. I can feel it in side of me that i am. I can feel that there are people on this world like me to but none of them live close to me so i can't get a hold of them. I know this couls sound crazy but i don't care this is why i am writting this downto see if one day someone will find this and prove that i was something esle other then just human. So what am I? I don't really know for sure but it has something to do with something i call the ancient forces. I think my soul pissed them off in another life and there put me on this world for some messed up reason. Probly because i did something i wasn't supposed to do. THIS IS MY PUNISHMENT!!! LIVING ON THIS MESSED UP WORLD! WITH ALL THESE HUMANS THAT ARE KILLING THIS WORLD! I HATE ALL OF U HUMANS SO YOU ALL CAN GO TO HELL! anyways that is what i have to say. so my life doesn't have a meaning at this time but in a way it does. I like to question everything and think of way how this world of our happenes. so what does the powers that be are trying to tell me. ALl humans have a reason to be on this world and in this place and time that we are all in. But humans are losing the big picture to live in peace witht mother earth and not to destroy it. We need it to live and nothing esle. If mother earth really wanted to. She/He could have destroyed us long ago and still could destroy us if it wanted to. We can't control nature anymore so why shoudd we try and control it but let it happenes how it happenes. I try and take things will it happenes but i have noticed that it not the way it should be. We have to go out and find thing to challenge the midn and body and grow as people and find the wisedom and knowledge that we seek inside us all.

Strenght is nothin without knowledge and wisedom to guide it to the right path/course to take in life and challenges"

"event","&nbsp;Two abosolutely drama filled weeks, filled with nonsense.

Well...it's over.

I personally didn't voice my side very much. I knew someone else would not use discretion and go around talking about it. Even turning to my friends. People are strange.

It's like there's a void. An empty space where the past year was. I feel like time has almost stopped. How good was it really?&nbsp;
Good, really good. Rarely excellent after the winter that possibly drove us through more stress than we ever imagined. It's amazing to see what changes people, college, jobs, adulthood, encountering new areas, and knowing yourself. We drifted, and I loved a ghost.

Well...it's over.

I've cried once. I would only give myself once. It was the hardest I had cried in years.

i've discovered though, I'm ok. I'm all right. I'm moving on.&nbsp;

For once, just once, instead of trying to arrange them...I let the pieces fall. It was satisfying.&nbsp;

Maybe now I can just &quot;trust the process.&quot;"

"event","So i was talking and i thought about how certain thigns bother me, and i was asked, what my pet peeves were so i've officially come up with a list and hope that I'm not a giant weirdo. 

1-Sticky things
2-People with Rhode Island accents (except Roy Rossi, because he's my HERO)
3-Facial Hair
4-bad table manners
5-close minded people
6-People who are two-faced.
7-People who don't listen
8-Assumptions-(side note:that whole thing they teach you about making an ass out of you and me, that's usually true)
9-Yelling
10-Tardiness
11-toilet humour
12-vaccuuming
13-when people make a giant mess in my house, especially my beach house and dont clean it.
14-technology that doesn't work
15-the following words: Yolk, moist, plump, nickel, mushy.
16-round flat circles. I have overcome pancakes, and they are delicious.
17-Ignorance-(In the true sense of the word, ignorance is a lack of knowledge, not when someone is rude and people say that they are ignorant, when someone truly doesnt know something, and is just obnoxious)
18-my allergies.

someone comment and make me feel less weird.
k thnx,."

Come on, why not?
People might misunderstand what we're tryin' to say, you know?
No, but that's a part of life]
Come on
Let's talk about sex, baby
Let's talk about you and me
Let's talk about all the good things
And the bad things that may be
Let's talk about sex
Let's talk about sex
Let's talk about sex
Let's talk about sex
Let's talk about sex for now to the people at home or in the crowd
It keeps coming up anyhow
Don't decoy, avoid, or make void the topic
Cuz that ain't gonna stop it
Now we talk about sex on the radio and video shows
Many will know anything goes
Let's tell it how it is, and how it could be
How it was, and of course, how it should be
Those who think it's dirty have a choice
Pick up the needle, press pause, or turn the radio off
Will that stop us, Pep? I doubt it
All right then, come on, Spin

Hot to trot, make any man's eyes pop
She use what she got to get whatever she don't got
Fellas drool like fools, but then again they're only human
The chick was a hit because her body was boomin'
Gold, pearls, rubies, crazy diamonds
Hot to trot, make any man's eyes pop
She use what she got to get whatever she don't got
Fellas drool like fools, but then again they're only human
The chick was a hit because her body was boomin'

Gold, pearls, rubies, crazy diamonds
Nothin' she ever wore was ever common
Her dates heads of state, men of taste
Lawyers, doctors, no one was too great for her to get with
Or even mess with, the Prez she says was next on her list
And believe me, you, it's as good as true
There ain't a man alive that she couldn't get next to
She had it all in the bag so she should have been glad
But she was mad and sad and feelin' bad
Thinkin' about the things that she never had
No love, just sex, followed next with a check and a note
That last night was dope

CHORUS

Ladies, all the ladies, louder now, help me out
Come on, all the ladies - let's talk about sex, all right
[Yo, Pep, I don't think they're gonna play this on the radio
And why not? Everybody has sex
I mean, everybody should be makin' love
Come on, how many guys you know make love?]"

"event","Alright so brace yourself for this...the single most bizzarre christmas eve ever, and thus leading to a bizzarre christmas i suppose.

  so 6am xmas eve morning i wake up and puke, and continue to puke and dry heave every half hour after that until 11am. My grandma and mom then both take me to this weird clinic (my normal doctor was gone), and all the people in this clinic, i swear, were from the twilight zone...they were all nuts. So about 30 minutes of waiting in a doctors room, a big man with tatoos on his arms comes in to give me a shot ::shutters at the thought::. Not 10 minutes after the shot, i pass out, not go to sleep, PASS OUT...out like a fat kid in dodge ball. I was out for a while, so i dont really remember anything that happened in that time. Except that i think i had an out of body experience cuz according to my mom there were no mirrors in the room, however i remember looking myself in the face. I also remember wondering if i was dying. So first i got all white and waxing looking, and heard a ""fizzing"" noise in my ears, and a ringing noise too, then i turned all rosey, and got all sweaty, then i got all white again. Also my mom said i was making weird groaning noises. And apperantly i kept slipping out of my wheelchair too while they were trying to get me into our car. 

   Once home from the ""crazy clinic"" i stayed in my ""passed out"" state and slept for hours and hours and was woken few times to drink a little bit of water. Then i slept till this morning, woke up tp open presents, went back to bed, and woke up again at 3.

merry christmas"

its too easy for others to meet you there.

dont drink your tears,

  So today my car got sick and decided to puke up coolint all over the ground. Thankfully just as she blew i had just parked. Every last bit of green liquid coolint was out of her in a jiffy. SO sat Jenica on the curb outside of the Olympian Newspaper building, awaiting Sarah and some guidence. Thankfully she called up Plum Street auto, and grandpa Shelstad came to the rescue with more coolint and advice for me to eat up. Grandpa Shelstad insisted we bring bessie back to the shop for a check up. So my mother, grandpa, and sarah and I made a nice little train down to the auto shop. On the way down there my poor little car got sick again and started steaming, thankfully she didnt puke again until we parked at the shop. And thats where she is now. Again, i am carless (for the time being anyway). One taste of freedom, one day to do what i need to without depending on others...and BAM! its gone. thats it. thats all i get.

homecoming is on the 23, and i bought my dress on tuesday! Its absolutly gorgous! I know its ""the one"" too cuz i simply love it, and it when i saw it at first i didnt like it much, didnt even wanna try it on, but did cuz it was the only halter top dress i could find...it wasnt even my size. Turns out, like it usually does for me in these kind of situations, it was actually the most beautiful dress i had seen all day and its just awesome. muy bonita!

The CHS vs OLY game was last friday, and for those of you who care, we won...and by won i mean we smoked them. THough Geoff didnt play, he did a wonderful job of standing on the sidelines. haha. That was a fun game. good times.

Thats all for now i suppose, i will definatly up date again after the show, and let everyone know how it went.

*getting yelled at by spanish speaking people who spoke absolutly no english
*some old guy thinking III was hitting on him cuz we are required to put customer phone numbers in the computer (he thought i wanted his number)
*some old man commenting on how i should raffel myself off, make a lotto type deal, where at the end of every week, one lucky guy would win a date with me (funny thing is that i think he may have been serious haha)
*a litte fat kid with a high voice getting reallllly excited at the fact that there IS a special drawer under my counter that only SOME people have the key to and the OOONLY way to open it is with that key. he was half way up on the counter becuz this thought entertained him so much haha.

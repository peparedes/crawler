"event","So this weekend, was a rolller coaster. Friday hung out with Abbe, the usual hehe and stayed at her house...good except when she wakes you up in the early early morning hours haha <3
I got home and slept alll day til 3, gah hadn't done that in a while so felt kinda good.
Finally got myself out of bed went shopping at over near the Florida mall and Millenia mall alone, I like to do that sometimes it helps me to not think about shit and I get clothes so ya!
After that I got Abbe from her work and we were supposed to go to one of our houses to watch Sex and The City...and well she said she felt like being home so I took it as I go to my house, she goes to hers haha well I get home and I'm in a terrible mood because people suck so I decide to pop in satc and watch it alone and eat LOTS of foood..she calls me an hour and a half later WHERE ARE YOU!!!? haha 
Sooo after my depressing night I drive over there and she passes out on me. Bitch<3
So I come home and don't go to bed til 4 in the morning, I emailed 30 agencies..that'll make your head spin and then I just wrote to ramble about shit.
Sunday I wake up early for no reason sucked. But still in my blah mood I needed to see Caitlin!!! Fucking had the most amazing time with her I miss her soo much, I thought we were falling apart, but it was the lack of us hanging out. It was like the old days, when we didn't have shit to worry about and we could just be crazy and do what the girls do when know one is around..Be US
I wish I didn't live over on this side of town, because I would be with you everyday spending our last high school year together..
sooo anyway...We brought out the CLOTHES hahah the big box of CLOTHES.
And toook sooo many pictures...they were hot Cait was madonnna and I was jsut a whore lol <3
and turns out cait has a professional breakdancer in her room..for whenever she gets bored LoL
sooo I came home and watched another season of SEx and The City!!! wooohooo!
I may have cried all weekend, but atleast I can say I ended it laughing with my bestfriend! I loveeeee alll my friends!!
OHH and michele pommier agency in miami emailed me back...they need bathing suit pictures grrr now I have to hurry up and do that! rush rush rush
and after weeks of waiting I'm just now finding out whats wrong with my finger..because I still can't bend the piece of shit hahaha
LOVE YOU FUCKERS!!!

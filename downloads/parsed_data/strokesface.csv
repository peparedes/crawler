i went rollerskating last weekend for a friends birthday. i fell over 4 times and just when i thought id got goin and built up a bit of speed i turned into bambi on ice. my little sis came with me and she started crying cos i kept falling over and she thought i was gonna hurt myself haha. rollerskating is the hardest thing in the world EVER.

we resumed our football season last sunday too, with a win WOOHOO. i was HACTUALLY allowed to play upfront aswell and i got two goals(one a rather impressive henry-esque raid down the left cutting inside and curling it into the far corner past the keeper), but my bastard manager still insists im better on the left, arse.

omg and how fuckin good is Desperate Housewives?

"event","this is the first chance ive had to come online today cos some bright spark(lol i no) decided to set fire to the electricity sub station at about 7 this morning and jsut about the whole town was left with no electricty. cue lots of neighbours gossiping over fences, offering cups of tea to those without a gas cooker, dusting off some old books and generally realising what a pain in the arse it is to go without the wonders of modern technology, even if its only for 8 hours or so.

talking of pains in the arse, mine still hurts buts it better. it was fuckin awkward tryin to sleep last nite tho, every time i turnt over it felt like someone was tryin to pull my arse cheek off haha.

yeh so anyway. the power cut. i basically stayed in bed and read my John Lennon book until we got the power back. altho apparently, alot of the town still hasn't been reconnected.

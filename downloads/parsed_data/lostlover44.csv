Sara- u were the hottest cowboy ever u made amercia proud lol

kelly- no one can ""streach"" like u and you are way hot lol and i loved seeing u as dirty kit kat girl casue like your award your so dam sweet 

alysse- u rocked the house i love u in to ladies your facial expression were so on, your in character 120% of the time 


ALL- U I CANT WAIT TO SEE all your names is lights i love u guys



then i went to KAylee's party whiched rocked i missed tat family so much. And im started to not be so scared of the OAK park boys they are so nice. LOl  i love cacth pharse!!!!!!!!

lol we played dumbell racing i really like the game, 

but only thing bugged me and it is my fault. Im not a dumb blond
no i am not in honors classes or AP classes but i do have a different kind of smarts, people smarts life smarts and its just as in important, NO i cant tell u the formula for some biohazard cemical, but i cam give insite on people and feelings and educate in way a text book can't. ANd u can laugh at me all u want,  and yes i do act like a dumb blonde but thats a joke i kiding around. I went over this with Kerry and ALiie, i tend to act dumb alot because everyone has had one of those moments were u have wanted to say soemthing so bad it hurts but your scared to sound dumb, lame, or werid, but if i say the dumbest thing then everyone will feel comfortable. The only problem is i creat a wonderful and safe group yet i don't get any of that wonderful or magical feeling. SO u can call me dumb i not telling people to be werid around me, treat me the same just understand that there is somthing deeper to me when i talk. 
i love u guys thank u 
if you read this i love u guys

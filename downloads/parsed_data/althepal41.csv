I woke up with my bed partially soaked....here i'm thinking ""ohh shit did I just piss myself?""&nbsp; only to realize that last night i passed out with a full open bottle of water in my hand...and let me tell you that was definitely something that gave me one hell of a rude awakening. Later on my sister took me out to eat at benihana (cuz i'm kool like that lol) then I came home and lounged for a while then figured ""well I have the time, might as well set this journal up"".&nbsp; My buddy Tony is payin for all the drinking he did the other night as of right now ""hey tony water and excedrin work miracles my friend"". But on another subject i'm currently stradling the border that divides relationship and being single.&nbsp; Sometimes it's really hard seeing that most of your friends are in a relationship and you feel sorta...well left out...I mean being single has it's good moments but sometimes you just need that one person around that you can confide in and just hold.&nbsp; I mean hey who wouldnt mind a movie night that involved you, your gf,a couch, possibly a blanket, and a couple kisses here and there.&nbsp; I guess in all honesty i'm a little afraid to get back into a relationship being that my last one ended in a ""crash and burn"" fashion.&nbsp; Even though we both sorted out our differences it's kinda hard being the same with that person because of what happend that ended both the friendship and the relationship in the first place...Yeah I was hurt pretty bad but it's still kinda tough giving this person a second chance knowing all that you had with this person and all that could have been is gone and will probably never be.... She calls once in a while wanting to hang out but I usually decline not because im being an ass but more that im not sure how i would be around her...scared of my reactions I guess because i dont know what my reaction would be..... but back to the single thing I had a talk with my buddy mike about it and he's in the same rut i'm in...as is tony and greytok (I feel ya boys).&nbsp; Maybe i'll find that person that i can share the couch, blanket, and kisses with on movie night but for now..........</FONT></STRONG></EM></P>"

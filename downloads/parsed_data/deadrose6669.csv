"event","Ok, yea, so it has been a while, again. I know, every time I update I claim that I'll keep up with this thing, but I keep forgetting, lol. Anyhow, this update prolly wont be too long since there isn't too much to say. Let's see...I'm still in Alaska, and will be for the next 3 years, still with Mike and doing well, and still working on school. 

Alaska's ""6 months of daylight"" has come to an end and the season changed. We actually got snow this weekend. It was only about an inch accumulation total, but it was snowing non-stop all weekend. The temperature dropped to about 26 too. Although, it wasn't too bad cuz it was a dry cold, not that chill ya to the bones crap. I'm used to snow close to Christmas, not Halloween though, lol. The days are getting shorter as well. Right now we have what would be normal winter days for the lower 48 (i.e. slightly overcast all day with darkness creeping in around 5 or 6pm). I'm sure in a month or two we will be really hitting the ""6 months of dark."" The Northern Lights are slowly getting more visible. Nothing too spectacular yet so I don't have any pics, but if you go outside around 10pm you can see either a light green or red off in one corner of the sky. It's neat :) I'll be sure to send some pictures as soon as it gets really clear.

Nothin much new in the me and Mike department. We have both been spending a lot of time playing Halo 3 (prolly me more than him) and just hangin around the house. Nothin major to report really. We are doing well and have been happier than we ever really were before.

As for school, that is going well too. I got A's on the finals for all 4 of the classes I mentioned before and so I have a 4.0 GPA right now. I changed my major to Humanities, instead of English, which isn't that big a change, lol. Instead of taking a butt load of all English courses, now I get to spice it up with some History, Language, and other types of courses. I think it will be more fun. Plus, I'm contemplating working on a Graduate degree in Humanities with a focus on Asian Studies. That way I can try for a job at a museum, possibly as a curator if I get really ambitious, hehe. We shall see. Even if I opt not to go that route a Humanities degree will look good on just about any job application in the Business field, so whatever. I'm planning to step up my class-load next semester to speed along the process a bit. Mike and I are hurting for cash and so I volunteered to go back to work, but was told I'm not allowed, lol. So, instead, I plan to push myself to get through school quicker so I have no excuse for not working. I should have taken more courses this semester, but I thought it would be nice to breathe after that History of Japan class, which turned out to be a lot of fun but a LOT of work too. So I only signed up for 2 classes, but one is a 1/2 semester, 1 credit hour class. In fact, I only have like 1 more week before LIBS 150(Liberal Studies) is over. Then I'll just have HUMN 351, Myth and Culture, to finish up. The class is fun, but it is easy. So anyhow, next semester I'm signed up for PHIL 140 (Contemporary Moral Issues), SOCY 100 (Intro to Sociology), and IFSM 201 (Information Systems). I'll also be taking my Math placement exam as soon as the Army Ed. Center gets their computer system fixed so then I'll be signing up for whatever class they suggest for my Math pre-requisites. It ought to be an interesting semester.

Well, I think that about covers everything. Oh, last thing, I gave into the evil of MySpace cuz a bunch of my family has it and I got tired of not being able to view all their blogs and shit. In any event, I posted some of the pics from the drive up from Washington on their. If you want to go see, here is the link: <a href=""http://viewmorepics.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewAlbums&friendID=258422906"">My Photo Album</a> So, till next time :)"

"event","Why hello there my humble companions. How goes it? I know, I know hisashiburi desu ne (long time no see).  But, rest assured, from now on I will try to make a valiant effort at stopping by from time to time to throw out an update. That being said, let the show begin!! ;)

So, quick summary of points: 1-Mike and I have been back together for months now and doing better then ever, 2-Sherman and I are still great friends and drop each other a call when our hectic lives allow, 3- I had moved out to Washington to be with Mike, but after about 5 months we were moved and now I live in sunny Alaska.

Now, you will notice I used the word ""sunny"" to describe Alaska. This is because right now Alaska is in it's 6 months of light phases which translates to...THE SUN NEVER FUCKING SETS! Now, I don't mean that in an over-exaggerating, making shit up kinda way. I mean that in the sun truly never sets sorta way. Right now it's 4pm and looks like high noon. In a few hours it will be 9pm and it will STILL look like high noon. By about 11pm it will start to look like evening (4-7ish) and by 2am it might be dark enough out to be considered ""sundown"" and it will stay this way for a bit. However, by 4pm it will start looking like ""sunrise"" again and by 5am it will look like late-morning (9-11ish). Wash, rinse, repeat. Of course, this is only half the year, I'll let ya know how the 6 months of dark thing goes, lol.

So, anyhow, I've been living in Alaska for a couple weeks now and so far so good. The weather is nice this time of year, there is some breathtaking scenery, and the people seem pretty laid back. Mike and I have agreed that people run on ""Alaskan time"" up here, which is about 15-20minutes slower than anywhere else in the world, hehe. Mike sat in line at a drive through for almost 20 minutes one day and he was the only person in line.  Speaking of scenery, by the way, Mike and I ended up driving up here from Washington (in separate vehicles mind you) and I have some pictures of some absolutely gorgeous scenery and a shitload of wildlife. The drive was spectacular! I hate driving long distance and even I couldn't help but enjoy it, lol. I'll post pictures just as soon as we get all the film developed.

On another note, for those of you who don't know, I've finally gone back to school. I'm attending UMUC online and going for a B.A. in English with a minor in Asian Studies. Right now I'm finishing up my first semester which consisted of ENGL240 (Poetry, Drama & Fiction) and JAPN111 (Elementary Japanese I). Plus, my summer semester started 2 weeks ago so I'm also taking HIST483 (History of Japan Since 1800) and ASTD150 (Asian Studies I). I know my class order is a lil odd since I'm practically finishing my minor before my main degree, but I had to wait for my military ed. to be evaluated and it left my struggling to find an offered online course that I knew I would need to take. In any event, I've been hella busy lately with the 4 classes and as it is, I'm only typing now cuz I'm in need of a break, lol. But, both English and Japanese language end in a week so I'll have more time after that. Just have to pass those finals first.....I think I'll be fine with English, but Japanese is gonna cause some issues. I know the basics, but there is a LOT of the class I just don't understand or can't seem to remember off the top of my head. Luckily I've aced every other part of the class so even if I blow the final, I should still pass the class. hehe

Wow, this is turning into a longer post than I expected. Heh, probably has something to do with not wanting to go read any more Asian Studies or ""Death of a Salesman,"" lol. Oh well, whatcha gonna do, I mean really? :)

So, let's see, what else is new...anooo(ummm)....aa (oh!), I've picked up some new interests thanks to Mike and my friend Eka. 1- I'm a huge Naruto and Bleach freak now, 2- I find myself spending more and more money every time I visit a comic book store, and 3- I'm gonna go fucking broke with all the manga and anime I'm buying as of late. To go into further detail, thanks to Mike's MASSIVE interest in comic books (Deadpool in particular) I've started to find comics I like as well. For example, the Laurell K. Hamilton series I read devotedly has it's own Anita Blake comic series now. Plus, there is a series called Ninjas vs. Pirates. I mean, Helloooooo, NINJAS versus FUCKING PIRATES!! Who could resist that one??? I'm not unbreakable damnit!! So, despite my best efforts, I've started reading some of Mike's Deadpool series and rather liked it. Now I've completely given into the dark side and have vowed to read all Mike's Deadpool comics in addition to the two series I plan to collect for me.  As for manga, that is thanks to both Mike and Eka, although I think Eka played a greater role. The damn girl felt the need to bring a new one in every week practically and then tell me all about it!! Christ, I can't live under these conditions! So, now I am reading Helsing, Berserk, Basilisk, Judas, and Rebirth, among others that I can't recall thier names right this second. In addition to this, I have read ALL the Naruto manga (Japanese version w/ translations) online and wait patiently each week for the newest translated edition. Plus, I have watched every Naruto/Naruto:Shipuuden AND Bleach episode meaning that once again I wait patiently each week for the newest translated episode. As if all that is not bad enough, I've developed such a fascination with anime/manga that I've started watching/reading various other series that aren't as popular (at least not in the U.S.) I truly think there was a conspiracy to turn a helpless book geek into an all out nerdy geek!! 

My future children are truly doomed to be the laughing stock of the school. I mean, look at who their parents will be. Dad faithfully watches WWE wrestling, reads comic books, reads the occasional fiction book, reads manga/watches some anime, and plays an abundance of video games. And mom reads more books then we have bookshelves, also watches some wrestling, reads some comic books, faithfully watches anime/reads manga, and when a video game attracts her attention will go days doing nothing but playing. LOL, he/she is SO destined to be just as big of a nerdy geek!! hehehe, poor kid.

Anyhow, I really should finish up school work and I'm sure you are tired of reading. So, off I go. Ja mata (See you later)"

"event","Why do I always do this? How do I always hurt those I care about? Why am I like this?! How does one person manage to hurt everyone that has ever cared for her? FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK! I want to scream and throw things. I want to cry, well, technically, I've got that covered already, but I want to scream too. I am nothing more than a coward. A spineless little coward. I run from everything. I use people. I'm no better than Fred. The going gets tough and I hall ass. Joe once told me a long time ago that ""if I faced the Army with the same cowardice that I approached our relationship that I was sure to fail."" Only now, all these years later, does it make sense. I did fail. I fail a lot of things. I didn't make it through Basic Training, I scraped by because the Drills liked me and felt sorry for me. I barely made it outta AIT. I gave up in Pensacola. I quit. I did fail. Then I failed with Mike. I ruined us, more than once. I don't know how or why he sees a reason to take me back after everything. I wouldn't. If it had been the other way around, I wouldn't have been able to forgive him. Why? I don't deserve forgiveness. God, I hurt so many people. I gave up Joe cuz I was afraid of the Army and cuz I jumped into things with him without thinking them through. I led him on and dumped him. I did the same thing to Adam and Sherman. Sherman's hurting because I got confused and bailed. I ran away from Drew too. God, he may have had his own problems and I just bailed. Don't think I'm giving him an excuse for what he did, but I should have at least called his ass instead of an email. But Sherman, yea, that one takes the cake. The only real friend who has ever understood me and I used him. I hurt him. Just like I hurt the others. What is wrong with me? Why do I ruin every good thing in my life? I had a feeling that trying to date Sherman would backfire. I knew it would ruin us. I knew it and I ignored it. Now look! He can't talk to me cuz he gets upset. I can't talk to him cuz I get upset. He blames himself when it's really my fault. All he ever did was care and I'm the one who changed.I'm the one ruining his happiness because I can never make up my mind about what or who will make me happy. Hell, I never know what will make me happy and every time I think I find it, I throw it away. AGH! I can't do this right now....I'm going to lay down and stare at the ceiling till morning."

Distance and space allow emotions to age into faith
Our bodies may end up alone but close

Are you there can you hear me
Are you there can you feel me

Just in the way all your fingertips touch me
They are healing
One day we'll all fall prey

Are you there can you hear me
Are you there can you feel me

Waking up good morning to you my dear
I'm waking up enduring my biggest fears of
Distance away (a weight) distance away

Are you there can you hear me
Are you there can you feel me

Waking up good morning to you my dear
I'm waking up enduring my biggest fear love</font>

"event","So, I decided to get a sample reading done and here are the results. I'm gonna highlight the things that seem to hit home the most for me. Maybe ya'll will gain a bit of incite that I have not yet been able to put into words accurately. (Sorry it skips around, it was only a sample reading so they don't show you most of it)

<b>Chapter 1: Your Heart and Soul - The Real You</b>
<i>The Sun is in Gemini.</i> 
The Sun was in Gemini at the time of your birth. However, reading your birth chart will show you the many other astrological factors that also influence your personality and the way you behave. Put them together and they give you a complete picture of the many astrological influences that make up your unique personality. 
Even if you live to be a hundred, life will be far too short for you to cram into it all the experiences and knowledge that you'd like. People, places, and all sorts of subjects fascinate and inspire you, because you're always open to new ideas and influences. <font color= #FF7F50> What's more, you love communicating them to others, whether you have a good gossip with a neighbour, spend hours on the telephone or put all your thoughts down on paper.</font> You love using your brain, and you're very intelligent, but sometimes your insatiable curiosity gets the better of you, and you're side tracked on to yet another new train of thought. <font color= #FF7F50>That means you can flit from one subject to the next like a butterfly, leaving a trail of unfinished conversations, hobbies, or evening classes behind you! </font>If you want to make the most of your stunning potential, then you need to cultivate your concentration and try to avoid being so easily distracted! 
<font color= #FF7F50>Words usually flow from your lips with no effort at all, but sometimes you can get carried away and start embellishing the truth, just to give some added interest to what you're saying.</font> Take care, though, that folk don't accuse you of lying, or start to disbelieve everything you say. You're top of the popularity polls, because folk enjoy your quick wit and lively mind and find you fun to be with. <font color= #FF7F50>You're never lost for words (in fact sometimes you barely pause for breath!) and try to keep up to date with the latest books, films and news. 
There's never a dull moment when you're around, because you're always changing from one mood to the next. One moment you'll be feeling doom laden and depressed, and the next you'll be laughing and joking as though you hadn't a care in the world. All this chopping and changing can make you very highly strung unless you make an effort to relax and soothe those jangled nerves. </font>One thing you're never short of is a host of friends and acquaintances, all of which appeal to different aspects of your multifaceted personality, from serious to superficial. 
<font color= #FF7F50>Being tied down to one place, living with a possessive partner who wants to know your every move or having a tedious nine-to-five job are just three of the things that will make you feel frustrated, suffocated and desperate for escape. You also have a very low boredom threshold, and don't suffer fools gladly! Happiness for you is feeling free and unhampered by restrictions or rules, and that often goes for your emotions, too. 
Because you live so much in your mind, strong feelings and desires can frighten you, since they mean that you're no longer in control or are unable to think in your usually rational and logical way. You need to learn more about your own emotions, and realise that you won't look weak or silly if you admit to the way you really feel about something or someone. </font>Everyone has emotions, so why not start admitting to yours?


<b>Chapter 2: Your Persona and Image - How Others See You</b>
<i>The Rising sign is Gemini.</i> 
Versatility is your middle name, and you have a list of interests, hobbies, and studies that's as long as your arm! In fact, you're happy to have a go at almost anything that takes your fancy, just to see what it's like. Therefore, you know a little about almost every subject under the sun, and are a real expert when it comes to your job or favourite pastime! In fact, you have the best of both worlds because, although you're always open to new suggestions and love discovering new things, you don't flit from one idea to another like a restless butterfly. Instead, you have quite a strong sense of purpose and so can remain interested in something for quite a long time! By the time, you've finished it, another subject will have caught your eye, and you'll be off on a different track! After all, you know secretly just how restless and unsettled you can feel sometimes, and you may need to curb your fancy-free spirit a wee bit. <font color= #FF7F50>Where relationships are concerned, you need all the freedom you can get! You shudder at the thought of being tied down to someone who always wants to know what you're thinking and what you've been up to. You're not going to tell them, so the sooner they get used to the idea, the better! Instead of feeling that the two of you are bound together hand and foot, you prefer to think that you're friends and soulmates who let each other live their own lives. Every now and then, you can't resist taking a risk or accepting a challenge it all adds spice to what's already a very exciting and invigorating life! </font>


<b>Chapter 7: Your Energy and Libido - Your Ego</b>
<i>Mars is in Gemini.</i> 
Intellectual energy is bubbling away inside you, making you tremendously talkative and always alert. <font color= #FF7F50>You're rarely stuck for something to say, especially during arguments or heated debates! Because communications of all kinds appeal to you, you probably love writing long chatty letters to all your far off friends and family or getting away from it all by having a jolly good read. Something that you find difficult is concentrating on one thing at a time almost anything can distract you, making you feel restless and all set to move on to something else.

<center><font color=#BC8F8F> <b><font size=3>""What Happened To Us?""</font>
By: Hoobastank</b>

[Verse 1:]
I thought it was too good to be true
I found somebody who understands me
Someone who would help me to get through
And fill an emptiness i had inside me
But you kept inside and I just denied
Some things that we should have both said
I knew it was too good to be true
Cause i'm the only one who understands me

[Chorus:]
What happened to us
We used to be so perfect, now we're lost and lonely
What happened to us
And deep inside I wonder, did i lose my only?

[Verse 2:]
Remember they thought we were too young
To really know what it takes to make it
But we had survived off what we have done
So we could show them all that they're mistaken
But who could have known the lies that would grow
Until we could see right through them
Remember they knew we were too young
We still don't know what it takes to make it 

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
We could have made it work, we could have found a way, 
We should have done our best to see another day 
But we kept it all inside until it was too late
And now we're both alone, the consequence we pay
For throwing it all away, for throwing it all away...

[Chorus]</center></font>"

"event","<font color=blue>I spoke with Mike today and told him not to check this anymore. There wont be anything on it. I've decided to stop writing. My thoughts are better kept to myself. Mike thinks I'll forget about him...he should know me well enough to know I never forget. He thinks I asked him to not have a rebound fuck at some point too, when I actually meant don't be like Adam and hold on so tight that it hurts himself in the end. He can fuck whoever he wants, whenever he wants. It's his right. Anyways, I wasn't trying to make this in to a reply to his post. That was actually the last post of his I plan to read. I just wanted to say that I've tried to tell everyone that I thought I was a conniving, lying, whore and only now does the world see it to be true. So be it. I'm tired of fighting. I'll take whatever abuse comes my way. I deserve it. Life goes on.

I love you, Mike. I'm sorry you found out the hard way who I am...and don't worry, like I said, I could never forget.</font>"

"event","Ok, upon re-reading that last entry, I realized that despite my best efforts not to lash out at Mike, I did anyhow. So, I have decided to clear some things up in my head. I'm going to list my major faults during the course of this relationship and next time I feel the need to lash out, I'm going to re-read this list and tell myself to shut the hell up...that's the plan anyhow. So here goes:

1- Even in the very beginning, I had a hard time committing myself completely to Mike. Perhaps a trust issue on my part.

2- Six months into the relationship, Mike and I had a huge argument and I cheated on him (Jay). More importantly, I didn't tell him about it till 2 days later when he was apologizing for the fight. Quite a bit of immaturity on my part.

3- I harp on things. For example, Mike's driving. I don't like how he drives, so instead of saying my piece and letting it go, I harped on it. A lot. Typical nagging woman issues.

4- I dwell on things. The only way I know how to solve any of my problems is to dwell on them. Not that this is entirely bad, but when I take it to the extreme it can make mountains out of mole hills.

5- I can't always express myself correctly. I tend to fear other people's reactions to what I will say and so sometimes I keep things in to prevent them from hurting someone. When in reality, if I just talked about it in the first place I might have prevented an argument.

6- I'm manic depressive and most likely have an anxiety disorder. Now, I know neither of these are faults per say, but refusing to seek help with these issues IS a problem. I hate doctors. So, instead of going to therapy, I put it off and deal with things my way. Well, we all know my way isn't always the healthiest way.

7- I have no self esteem. I tend to blame myself for things that are not my fault and things that are my fault, I sometimes try to turn around on others. If I had more confidence in myself, I would be a better person at handling the everyday issues of the rest of the world.

8- They say you can't truly let someone else in until you learn to love yourself. This is true for me. I hurt those I love because I don't know how to love myself and thus don't truly know how to love others. That's not to say my intentions aren't good, but we all know what happens to good intentions.

9- I lack a certain degree of patience...I know that's putting it mildly, lol...ok, I'm incredibly impatient. Let's be honest here, right?

10- I'm stubborn. Now this can also be termed as I'm a bitch. Both true at times...when I think I'm right it's VERY difficult to convince me otherwise. Furthermore, I tend to get crabby at people that don't see things my way. Not to say that I don't try to understand others points of view, but I do sometimes lack the maturity to admit when I'm wrong without being bitchy about it.

Ok, so the list can go on and on, but I'm not looking to have a pity fest or make myself feel like shit here. The top 10 things I can think of off the top of my head should suffice. So, I apologize for sounding testy in that last entry. I had no right to lash back, Mike. I shouldn't have said some of those things. I'm sorry. But, hopefully, this entry will help act as a reminder to myself that I'm not perfect and I wont be so quick to get defensive."

"event","Well, Mike's pissed at me...which, technically is an expected response, right? I dunno, it's weird though. Like, he sent me an email the other day asking me to explain everything that has happened. He didn't understand why I called things off. I tried, again, to explain it to him, but he only seems to focus on the parts that are easy to get angry about. Not that I blame him, that's a normal human response. We all try to only focus on the things that suit our mood at the time. But, it's bigger than that. I read his online journal today and he's not just mad at me, he's downright furious. He calls me a liar. He says I deceived him our entire relationship. Now granted, I have said some similar things about some of my ex-relationships that I felt wronged by, but this wasn't any of those relationships. This was a 4 year relationship with someone that I truly loved...not puppy love, not a crush. I dunno, I mean, I have screwed up in the past. Yes, I cheated on him, twice. Things got bad and I ran to someone else. I'm not perfect. Then again, neither is he. I told him about my little one-night flings after they happened, it may have taken me a couple months, but it came out. He on the other hand had a whole second relationship on the side that lasted for a month and the only reason why he told me about it was because I was crying on the phone one day and asked that we always be honest from now on. So he fessed up to something he had done 3 YEARS ago. How do you keep a secret like that for 3 years? More importantly, how do you throw my mistakes back in my face constantly and talk about havin a lack of trust in me, when you did the same damned thing? I have never thrown that back in his face. I found out a whopping 2 months ago and have not once thrown it in his face, because it wasn't important. Yet, he continued to throw my mistake with C. (see, I can be nice and leave names out of it when I want to, hehe) back in my face, not to mention Jay. And now, he stands ready to accuse me of having an affair with an old friend just because I called the marriage off. Yes, Cormier and I have been talking again, yes, I flew out to Colorado (which I told him about) for a weekend, but hell nothing happened. I had a good time. That's the plain and simple truth. I went out there and just had a good time being myself. He calls this running away. I call this not dwelling on my problems to the point of them killing me inside and out. I have spent my whole life as a manic depressive. Just once in my life, I'd like to wake up in the morning and know that life will go on. And damn it, is that so fucking bad? I don't think so....

God this whole thing is just so frustrating. How can he honestly believe that I never loved him? Because he read a couple journal entries on here written when I was angry? I mean, really, how often do I even post on this damned thing?? Four years of trying to show him I loved him, and he says that was a lie? Four years of trusting him COMPLETELY, when he didn't deserve any more trust than he gave me. Four years of memories and he here we sit...on different sides of the world...not understanding each other any better than we did on day 1...scared and lonely....maybe that's just me. According to him I was only using him for the medical benefits. Which makes perfect sense if you think about the fact that I didn't want to get married so young. I didn't want to get married early for the money. I didn't want to get married precisely for that reason. But, no, clearly I only did it for the medical. I'm lashing out. I know...I shouldn't be. This is his battle and I don't need to fight him. It's just painful to hear some of the things he says about me now. Has he always felt that way and just never said anything? I think that's what bothers me most. It's just not knowing if these are old thoughts about webs of lies and deceit that are only just now fully coming to light or is he only speaking out of anger? He thinks I blame him for everything. I don't. I don't know how to make him see that. I have tried to explain to him why my journal entries all point the blame at him, but he doesn't understand. I write only when I'm upset. And, when I'm upset, it's easy to point the finger. I mean, who wants to blame themselves, right? We all do it. Isn't that what he is doing now? Trying to get back at me? He feels wronged and is lashing out. I understand this. It's just hard to hear some of the thoughts that go through his head.

Mike thinks that Cormier is a rebound. Can I blame him? no...but he's not. I'm not sitting by the phone waiting for him to call me. I'm not pining over him. Am I looking forward to his possible visit in February? Yes. And why? because he has always been good at helping me work through my problems. The entire time I was in CO for that weekend, ya know what I talked about? My failing marriage. I would start talking and get lost in thought or be on the verge of tears. And for the first time in a long time, I had an old friend there to help me cheer back up. That's what friends do right? Help cheer each other up? So why does that <italic>obviously</italic> mean that I'm looking to jump back into a relationship with him? I remember what happened all those years ago. I remember the old girlfriend and the way I got played. I'm not stupid thank you very much. Even if I wasn't with Mike and Cormier just popped back in my life, I would not jump head first into a relationship with him for just that reason. The fact that I currently have a full plate trying to cope with my soon to be ex-marriage is plenty enough reason for me not to jump into ANY relationships. But, Mike insists that this must have been going on for months now. I have been planning on leaving him for 6 months now to run to an affair with someone that I only started talking to again about a week ago. There is no way for me to prove that to him is there? Nothing I can say will help this. Nothing will change his mind. So, what do I do? Let him vent and tell the world I'm a slut in his journal? Eh, looking like the only choice. Heh, it's funny that he's even got friends who have volunteered to spy on me. Why is that necessary? What would that accomplish? I have been nothing but honest with him about Cormier. I didn't have to tell him I was in CO, but I did. I didn't have to tell him Cormier might visit the end of Feb., but I did. In fact, right now, I don't have to even respond to his emails, but I do. I could very well just stop talking to him altogether. I could stop trying to help him answer all the questions he has. I could leave him to fend for himself....maybe that would be best, but hell, I still care about him and seeing him in this much pain kills me. So, what do I do? I set myself up to be punched around so that he can feel better. So be it. I'm a big girl. And despite popular belief, I think I'm handling this whole situation very well, considering I could be fighting back. I could be sitting here blaming him the way he blamed me, but I'm not going to. What's done is done and I can't take back the things I've done or said. So, well, just keep your fingers crossed that we all walk away from this with as few injuries as possible...."

"event","So yea, it's been a while, I know...and a lot has happened. Everything goes around in circles with me. Mike and I are bad, then we get better, then I realize that I'm still having a hard time accepting that everything can change. I can't entirely explain why or how my marriage just came to a screeching halt...I can assure you that it hurts like hell though. I dunno...it's...maybe it is all me. I know I have anxiety and manic-depression problems, but what if Mike was right and I am over-analytical and borderline delusional? I don't blame Mike for everything that has happened, even though I can't convince him of that...I mean, I know I have my problems too...things just got so bad after 4 years that I just, I couldn't handle it anymore. Perhaps it was quitting on my part or running away, but I was miserable. I felt like we were always together, but I was always alone. Then we call it off and go our separate ways for a month. But during this time he is trying, he is trying to show me he loves me. I start to hope that things might improve. I'm not sure that things will, but I hope and I pray. He comes home for 2 weeks and it's great...he deploys and it's ok. We talk about whatever...nothing overly important, but we talk. Things go well for 3 weeks or so. Then, we start to run out of things to talk about...conversations get spaced out with no explanations as to why...I start feeling awkward and helpless again...and there begins all the doubts and fears that I had never gotten over. I started asking questions to myself again. Were we only doing well cuz we weren't together? Everytime we had to live together we stopped talking, so was this just because we were in seperate places again? Did he really understand why I was so upset in the first place? Was he just trying to make me think he recognized the problems I did or was he only saying that out of fear of me leaving? I tried to push them all down again. I spent a whole weekend asking myself why I felt this way again. I talked to my mother...she says I have problems with fully committing. I talked to friends...they said I had made up my mind in August and that's why the doubts were back. All in all, most people tried to get off the phone quickly. No one wanted to talk about it anymore...""make your choice and stick with it"", ""quit being so melodramatic"", ""you're just like your father sometimes""....what if it is all true? I can't help the way I feel can I? If you're not happy and dragging the other person down with you, what choice do you have? I hurt him.......I never wanted to hurt him...I tried to show him that not everyone was evil and all I managed to do was re-affirm his worst fears....I made it worse....How do you say you're sorry for that? How do you even begin to make that right again? You don't...you can't...you can only live with your failures and regret your wrong-doings towards others.

So, it's over...it hurts...It hurts most because I know he hurts and it's my fault he hurts...I want to hold him and comfort him, but that would give him hope...that would give me hope. He's tired of living off ""my hopes""...I don't blame him...I know he will find someone better. He deserves it. We both made mistakes...I know this....I just hope I figure out how to not make those same mistakes again someday...I fucked up....I was not only not-perfect, but I did to him what Fred did to me...he feels used and I made him feel that way. he feels betrayed and I made him feel that way. he feels lost and I made him feel that way....I can't fix this. I don't know how anymore. I asked for help, but the gods turned a deaf ear...it's ok though...I knew they would...I ask now that they help Mike. I just want him to be happy...I hate seeing his pain, hate feeling his pain, hate knowing that I AM his pain....I still wear my ring. My ring is my punishment for failing. I know I will take it off at some point and I will ask him if he wants it back...it's the right thing to do, to return it....but for now, it reminds me of my failings, it reminds me of the pain I caused him. I have always loved him...I always will...but I can't be his everything when I'm my own worst enemy....I need to get me in order...I should have done that before I got involved with him...I can't expect a marriage to succeed when I have so many failings of my own...but I was naive. I wanted to believe in a ""happily-ever-after"" regardless of who I am....I was wrong and I hurt the one person I cared most about because of this....I am sorry...it wont ever be enough, but I am sorry....I tried not to hurt him...I failed....perhaps that will be my destiny, to fail....I hope I don't bring anyone else down with me......"

"event","Ya know what? Reading some of my past entries, I've come to the realization that I'm a bitch. I mean, I have always known that I can BE a bitch, but this is different. This is realizing that I am just genuinely an all out bitch. I'm cold-hearted about a lot of things, I'm one the most indecisive people anyone could ever meet, and I have managed to insult more people that I call ""friends"" that anyone should probably insult in a life time. I gripe cuz people aren't honest with me, but how often am I honest with everyone else, to include myself? So, ok, I'm gonna try to clear some shit up here cuz I'm sure anyone who has been trying to keep up with my soap opera of a life is severely confused about who I like and who I don't...

First, as far as Mike goes. I love him. I honestly do love him and I always will. However, I am VERY confused about where we stand right now and I'm VERY confused about whether or not we will works things out in the end. And, to be truthful, I don't have a whole lot more to say on that subject cuz it has been beaten to death in every entry for the last month. Bottom line is that what happens is Mike and I's problems and no one else's so the rest of my thoughts on the matter can stay in my head for now.

Second, I owe a HUGE apology to Chris. If I can get him to stay in a room with me long enough, he deserves to hear this to his face, but I have to work on that one a little first. Ok, so, I have been a <i>tad </i>bit unfair in my entries about our lil situation. I mean, I usually make entries when I am angry or sad and so, well, that's what a lot of my thoughts on him have been. I have done a lot of venting that probably shouldn't have come out, or at least shouldn't have come out the way it did. Our feud has not been all his fault just like it hasn't been all mine either. I think it started because he was trying his damnedest to stay out of everything and at the same time he knew he was short on time to spend with Mike. Somewhere in there I think I got jealous and started to get angry with him. He retaliated and pulled further away from me. From there it has been a downward spiral. Somehow we ended at the bottom here where he doesn't want to tell me how strange it is to try and be my friend after everything that has happened and I can't come to grips with the fact that I've only been making it worse by being such a bitch about it. So, in conclusion, Chris, hun, I am very sorry about some of the things I said in my blog. It was said in anger and I know that is no excuse,and I'm asking you to please understand that I didn't mean it. Not havin you around to talk to anymore has sucked ass. I miss being able to call you my friend....a LOT...I really hope we can still fix this sweety. I've never told you this, but you have always been one of the best friends that I've ever had. I mean, Fox beats you on the ladder, but she's really the only one... I don't want to lose you over something like this.

Wow, ok, next topic....as far as Randy goes, we are cool. I can talk to him and I am trying harder not to complain to him about things that involve mutual friends. It's not fair to drag him into fights either and I have done that a few times too. So, Randy, I do owe you an apology too. I am sorry for having brought you into just about every fight that I've had with Chris.

Last, as far as my living conditions and future plans go, I am still a bit in the air right now. I want to go to college, but I don't want to move to CT where I will be living in an attic at my mom's. I want to hang with Rob and Krista, but I don't want to lose touch with Erika or Randy or Chris. I don't know if Mike and I are working on things to get back together and so I'm not sure if Washington is in my future. It is all up in the air right now. Who knows what direction I'll be heading in come tomorrow.

Alright, well, enough of this...it's late and the dog is walking in circles by the door trying to get my attention. So, Goodnight everyone and and if I offended anyone else, well, I'm sorry to you too"

"event","I'm sorry...that seems to be the only thing I say anymore....ya know, some people have low self esteem for no good reason and then others have low self-esteem because they constantly find themselves in situations where an apology is in order. Somehow, some way, I seem to find myself in the second of these two groups. My intentions aren't bad, it's just that I seem to do and say a lot of stupid shit. Then, I never know how to fix the problem without making it worse. Maybe I do worry too much and that is why I cause so many problems in my life. I just don't know how I keep fucking things up. 

Mike and I talked the other night and we agreed that we need to take some time off from each other. Well, I decided that I need some time for myself and he simply said it was ok. And yet, by the end of the conversation, somehow he came to the conclusion that this is ALL his fault...now, I never said that and I wouldn't. I'm fully aware of the fact that I have many problems of my own to work on and that I fucked up my fair share of this relationship. But, I can't make him see that...so, I feel like shit cuz I just called off my marriage to a wonderful person who thinks he is the sole reason I need space. Needless to say an ""I'm sorry"" or two was in order and still is.....

Then there is Chris and Randy. I think Randy and me are ok...I use ok cuz I'm not sure, really, but I think we are still cool. I know he feels awkward, he's told me. And, that's fine, definitely understandable, but again, sorry if I make things worse on my end...So, on to Chris..........it's funny how I always seem to be at a lose for words these days when I try to talk about him. God, I don't know anymore. Mike and Randy kept telling me that Chris was havin a hard time dealin with this whole thing, they both admitted that Chris mentioned not being able to hang out with me if Mike and I called it quits, Chris himself has avoided me like the plague since this whole thing started. Yet, it IS understandable since he didn't want to get in the middle. Who can blame him? On the other hand, he didn't have to lie to me about us still being cool and all when he was tellin the other 2 a different story. Even Krista got the impression that Chris was uber-awkward around me, but not Mike. At this point, I feel awkward around Him, even if he doesn't feel weird around me. I'm not sure how to fix this either...I do miss havin him around though. I mean, we hung out when Mike was at 2 field training exercises, I've helped him drunk and half-unconscious to my bathroom on numerous occasions, we've both been there for each other during sob-fests a few times, and hell, he practically lived on my couch for a while. Yet somehow, we have managed to throw all that away these last few months and for what? Eh....I'm sorry, hun...

Ya know what, I'm not really in the mood to type anymore, so I'm gonna go sit on my couch and channel surf, like I've been doin every night for a week. Laterz ya'll"

"event","I swear, you would think it was getting close to my PMS week cuz I have been moody as shit lately! One minute I'm up, happy and just goin through my day. The next I feel like I'm fucking up my whole life and wanting to cry. I just can't keep things straight in my head...not that I ever could. For one thing, I had an AWESOME time in CT this last trip and I don't know why all my trips haven't been this much fun. Of course, with all the other trips I was worried about Mike feeling out of place or not gettin along with someone or whatever. I was able to go home and be myself again. I'm not saying I enjoyed being sad depressed Angel, but I did enjoy the stupid jokes we all had or the scary way Fred and me could play off each other's thoughts so well. I miss laughing with Rob and them down at TGIFridays or patrolling the mall, looking for people to scare into giving us dirty looks, lol. Most importantly, I miss having friends! I don't have friends here. They are all Mike's friends. I never go out by myself so there isn't a chance of meeting new people and when ""the group"" is out, I'm the only girl among 3 or 4 guys and so no one in their right mind would come up to talk to me. Chris and Randy are fun, but come on now, we all know they aren't MY buds, they are Mike's. But in CT....those are MY friends. It's like having a whole separate life that I only get to live when I'm by myself.........

Then there is this whole school thing. I mean, when I left for the Army, who remembers me telling them that I was joining for the college money? Raise your hands now, you should all have them up! That was why I joined...so I could afford school when I got out. Well, then I got to Pensacola, met Mike and all that changed. Suddenly my priority after the Army was getting to the same place as him and starting a life with him. Well, anyone who knows about the military at all knows that an E-4 don't make a whole lot of extra money. At least not enough to help pay rent, both our car loans, insurance, phone bills, gas bills, electricity bills, etc. There was no way I could go to college full time while living with Mike because he wouldn't be able to afford to help pay my bills and his. Plus, living in Maryland, the cost of living is outrageous. AND, I was only here for a year with him before he got orders to move. No point in starting at one school, transferring to another, losing half my credits, and then doing it all again when he transfers in another year. A 2 year degree suddenly takes 4 to get. Thanks, but no thanks! I used to have goals and ambitions. Then, sad to say, when Mike and I hooked up and got serious, I lost all those. I lost myself...I can't blame this all on Mike, I mean, he didn't do it on purpose, but that's just how life goes. Now, I feel like I have a chance to go back and try again, but unfortunately, I don't think Mike has much chance of being there for it all. How can he be from the west coast and then god-knows-where when he transfers again?

I love him, I swear to the gods I do, but how can this possibly work out when I have so many doubts and fears? How can this work when I want to start anew? How can this work when we can't even be together and be happy? That is what is all comes down to isn't it? Being happy with the compromises you make? I don't think I'm ready to compromise all that yet. I want to go to college. I want to move back home with my friends for a while. I want to HAVE friends for a while. I want freedom to be myself without having to worry about anyone but myself. I want to be happy. That's not all too much to ask is it? I'm not being selfish am I? I know, I should have figured all this out before we got married, but everyone makes mistakes. I told Mike before we got married that I wasn't quite sure we doin the right thing. That very morning I told him I was worried about getting pressured into it and that I didn't want my wedding to be in a court house where we were only doing it for the money. He told me it would all be ok. He told me that we were only doing the legal portion. He told me not to worry so much. Now look at us...I honestly feel that we got married too soon. I feel like we rushed it. Of course, if I tell him that he says I'm just worrying too much again and that he doesn't agree with me. Well, that is just one more difference between us if you ask me. Besides, if one person feels like it was a mistake then the other person should at least acknowledge that it may have been, not shrug them off!

I'm just confused. I know Mike can offer me stability and a loving husband to go home to every night. Yet at the same time, we argue so much and seem to have so many problems that I wonder if love is enough. He has way too much temper, he thinks I'm a nag, and he doesn't act like he takes me seriously. Not to mention a SEVERE lack of communication. On the other hand, I've never met a guy that doesn't have communication problems, everyone I know has a decent temper, and maybe I can be a nag. Oh fuck it! I'm really thinking that it's only a matter of time before this all comes to an end. I'm already heading down that road again. I've already started distancing myself unintentionally and I'm looking forward to going home and starting college so much that I'm not even thinking about our problems as much as I was before....

Maybe I need to talk to Mike again...maybe the separation isn't what we need, maybe it's more than that. Of course, every sentence begins with ""maybe"" so who really knows, right? I can't keep over-analyzing this though because it is driving me insane! So, ok, I'll talk to Mike again, we will see what happens..."

"event","So, it's a Wednesday night and here I sit questioning everything in my life, yet again. But, the difference is that this time I think I may actually be making some progress. I have come to the realization that I want to go back to school. I want to finally get that degree that I swore all those years ago, I would get when I got out of the Army. So, I talked to mom and she said I can move back to CT and go to college. Mike is just about out in WA right now and we have agreed to take a break. Not that things have changed much since we agreed that 2 days ago, but whatever. I know, my last entry I was leaning towards wanting to fix it all, but I'm just not so sure anymore. Ever since he left we have been pulling farther away from each other. Both of us have been doing it. Plus, if I got to CT to get my degree, we are looking at a year maybe two where I wont be able to move out to be with him. And honestly, that thought doesn't make me want to cry like it should. I dunno...I spose everything works out for the best in the end.

I'm real excited about moving back to CT and doin college though. Which, for anyone that knows me, knows that's weird since I hate school, lol...but, I want this. I remember I used to have goals and ambitions and those got lost when I hooked up with Mike. I almost feel like new windows are opening for me. So, if I get my ass in gear, I can move in December and start spring semester classes in Connecticut. It's real exciting!

Anyhow, quick update on what I've been up to since my last entry...Uh, let's see, Krista was here for the weekend of that last entry and that turned out to be real fun. It was nice hanging out with one of MY friends for once. Then this last weekend I went to CT for a visit and hung out with my mom and Tom, spent some time with dad, and hung out with Fred and Rob. Now before you say anything about Fred, it was ok, I swear! lol...we just hung out and caught up on old times. I had fun believe it or not :) Then I hung out with Rob on Saturday night, which was a total blast! Yes, I am talking about the same Rob from all those entries in the past. He's finally home from Iraq and out of the Army. He's living back home and going to college now...which I will admit, was a bit of an inspiration for me to do the same. So, if you ever read this again, thanks hun! 

Well, yea, so I lost my train of thought on this whole thing, hehe...I'll leave you with the words to a very good song. Rob had mentioned the music video (which I had never seen till now) to me and I downloaded it and I must say, it's pretty heart-wrenching. So, as that is always a sign of a good song, I leave you with this:

"event","Yea, I was a little angry when I wrote that last entry...hell, a lot of it isn't even how I really feel it was just ranting. I guess I just felt left out, ya know? It didn't help that Mike didn't want to admit to me that Jennifer was invited to go and I wasn't. Hell, when I talked to him the next day and asked if it turned out just to be the 4 guys (someone else from work went too) he said yea, but I know she was there. I have my sources, lol...anyhow, it doesnt matter. I mean, I know why I wasn't invited..for the same reason I wasn't invited to go out with them tonight. I'm convinced that Chris hates me, Randy feels awkward around me, and Mike doesn't know how he feels about me. I know, I deserve all of it.....

The worst part is that no matter how much any of them piss me off or how left out I feel, I can't really stay mad at any of 'em. I mean, I did this, right? I was reading some other people's blogs tonight and found out some interesting facts about there little get-together. The sad part, I'm not mad. I'm a little hurt that no one felt they could tell me about any of it and I had to read some things on a web blog. I'm more just upset that I missed the chance to have a good time with everyone and that no one wants to have anything to do with me these days. How pathetic is that? I find out my man kissed some other chic and all I can do is be sad I missed the party. Yea, I know, I'm stupid. 

I don't know what I'm supposedto do at this point. It's too late to go with Mike to Washington and yet I feel like staying here is going to make things worse. Hell, even if I did go with Mike they are talkin about deploying him to Kuwait so it wouldn't do much good right now anyhow. I'm pretty screwed no matter what I do...I want to fix us. I just don't know how and I don't know that Mike even cares to try anymore. Maybe I should have stayed quiet about this whole thing. Nothing would have ever gotten changed, but then again, the changes so far have been for the worst. I fucked up. I know the relationship problems are 50/50, but this whole break thing is entirely my fault. I caused all the pain for both of us. I started the gradual ruin of all my friendships, small as they may have been. I caused Mike to start distancing himself from me. I did all of it. Yea, we had problems, but I got scared and tried to run. And the running, that was ALL my fuck up. If I had just stuck with it from the start. If I had just kept my mouth shut up the seperation. All I had to do was start counseling sessions or something. I just, I got tired of telling him about the same problems over and over. I felt like a record skipping on repeat. I thought I had no other choice but to leave or to take time for myself. But now, I'd give anything to take it all back. There are so many regrets about this last month. So many things that never should have happened. So many words that should have been kept to myself. But, since the damage is done, now I have to find a way to fix it all. I have to find a way to keep my husband, to show him I still love him and I also have to find a way to mend broken friendships. I'm not sure why I feel the overwhelming need to try to mend friendships, especially since the 2 friends I'm referring to were never really MY friends to begin with. They are Mike's buds and I just adopted them as my own too. It's just that, I don't have any other friends. I don't have anyone to hang out with on my own. I barely have people I can call on the phone long distance. I just, I feel like if I lose Chris and Randy that then I'll really have no one...even if they only look at me as Mike's girl, that's better than having no friends at all right? 

Plus, ya know, they kinda grew on me :) Alright, I gotta go, Randy is here...laterz"

"event","Well, Mike, Chris, Randy, and Jennifer are all out partying tonight. Apparently, guys-night-out turned into anyone who wants to come can, except for me. Hell, Mike told Chris he was gonna run up to say bye to me and then they could leave and Chris pitched a fit. Mike had to throw ""you-know-who"" back in face saying that we all put up with him running back to her time and again so he could live with Mike and me's situation. Does anyone else see how that puts me in the same category as the she-bitch?! I fucking hate this shit! 

I found out that Mike got all upset cuz I took my ring off after our last big talk. He thought I was giving up on us because I put the ring in my jewelry box, so he took it. The catch would be that 1-I put it there cuz I felt like I was being a bitch wearing the ring and flaunting it in his face when I was the one who started all this and asked to put ""us"" on hold, and 2- I asked him that night if he wanted his ring back and he said ""no, put it in your jewelry box or somewhere safe."" So my question is, why did he get upset when he knew I was gonna do it, he told me to. He says cuz it was the day right after, but come on now, there was no appropriate time to do something like that. If I had waited and done it out of nowhere, he'd have been upset and if I waited till he left that could be taken as being sneaky. I wasn't trying to be a bitch, I just didn't think I had a right to wear the ring that he gave me when I was the one screwing with the relationship in the first place. It felt wrong....I thought I was doin the right thing....

So, I'm sure Mike complained to Chris and Randy about it and so now I have no doubts that they think I'm just the Wicked Witch of Maryland. Chris has been an asshole to me for weeks now. Mr. I'm-not-taking-sides picked a corner and started throwing punches. Not to mention the fact that he's so fucking busy with this new girl that he has barely had time for anything else. Shit, I'm surprised that he actually found time to hang out with Mike tonight. He volunteered to take Chad's dog, Emily, and who wound up watching her the first 4 nights she was here? Mike and me! Chris left to go visit Jennifer. It's all ""bros before ho's"" all the way up until he finds a ho worth keeping around. Then it's ""nothing matters but her, to hell with everything else."" It pisses me off to no end that he can't be responsible enough to take care of the dog HE took in, he can't be friend enough to spend time with his so-called best-friend before Mike leaves for Washington, and he can't be man enough to just say to my face how he feels about me. He feels the need to shoot me glares when he thinks I can't notice and he tries to be ""civilized"" to my face, when he's not hauling ass to get out of the room before I notice him. If he has a problem with me, the least he could do is fucking say it to my face, the fucking coward! Mike's gettin pissed at both of us cuz he thinks we are both being childish with our little feud...which is true, but the boy wont sit in the same room as me for 5 minutes, let alone talk to me long enough to work through our issues, so fuck it right?

Then there is Mike and me...he is leaving the 23rd of this month. That is only 5 days away. Honestly, I don't think we have accomplished anything these last 2 months either. I sure as hell don't know if we are even still trying to work this out or not. He still has the ring and hasn't tried to talk to me about it at all. Plus, one minute he acts all sweet and normal with me, then the next he seems like he doesn't want me around him or touching him. I'm getting confused about where I stand with him and he still doesn't talk to me about it to let me know how he feels. We need to have a major convo before he leaves. The problem is that my friend Krista came down for the weekend (she's having some serious relationship problems herself) and so finding time to talk to Mike might be a problem. I'm just starting to get this bad feeling that when Mike leaves that it will be for good. I keep feeling like he is going to walk away and not look back. But, he wont tell me or give me any real clues so I'm not sure....

Ya know, my logical side saw all this coming right? I knew Mike would turn away completely. I knew Chris would get mad at me and not want to be around me anymore. I knew I would lose what few friends I had. So, why am I acting like this is all a surprise? Why does it hurt so bad when I knew it was coming? I'm afraid to lose Mike....I love him. I can finally picture him being in my life years down the road, I can picture our wedding day, I can picture myself having his children...I just need to find a way to salvage this before it's too late. Eh, well, I'm gonna get goin before I get all emotional. Maybe Krista and me can go make cookies, lol :) Wish me luck......."

Every time I swear I'll change and quit bein the psycho that I am, I find a way to go back down the same roads. I'm gonna have a mental breakdown one of these days and there will not be a single person in the world to blame but myself. Hell, the ulcer I'm working on will be my fault too...

So, anyhow, Mike's home. The group came in Friday the 22nd while I was out gettin that furniture with Tobin and by the time I came home, Chris and Randy were passed out next door and Mike was passed out on the couch. Saturday morning I had to go with Tobin to return the trailer and by the time I got home Mike was sittin in the bedroom crying. Talk about unexpected....so we talked for a while, didn't accomplish much, but we talked. Saturday and Sunday was an up and down roller coaster ride for me goin from happy to sad every five minutes. Spent most of the weekend across the hall at Chris' place cuz I wasn't sure what to say to Mike. Monday and Tuesday I wound up staying home from work since Sunday night I broke down into hysterics that lasted till 3am and Monday night Mike took off at like 11pm without tellin anyone where he was. Yesterday I convinced him to let me read his journal entries, that was enlightening....

My thoughts are just so jumbled right now. I have Tobin breathin down my neck for an answer on if I'm stayin or not. My boss is being cool about it, but you can tell he wants an answer too. My stomach is constantly in knots. I have a UTI that I'm sure is stress related and I was pissin blood yesterday. I'm constantly on the verge of tears and I am no closer to making a final decision that I was 4 days ago.  I keep tellin Mike that I think I'm too far gone, but he thinks I'm just givin up too easily. Am I? Probably...but, what can I do about it? I can't force myself to fight for something that I don't feel I have the strength to fight for. I'm tryin so hard not to hurt Mike and he's trying so hard to be sweet and supportive, but is it all too late? I'm really thinking it might be. How do you let go though? How do you give it all up after 3 years? Then again, how do you fight for something that you don't think will ever change? How do you force yourself to be happy when your not and more importantly, why should you? 

I don't feel like anyone really understand me right now. I'm lost somewhere in my head and no one knows why. Erika looks at me like I'm just being pathetic, Chris is mad at me and Mike for letting this happen, Tobin thinks I should just pick something and stick to it and Mike thinks I'm just worrying too much over an obvious answer. Nothing is obvious to me though. I don't want to go to Washington, but I'm afraid to lose Mike because I got scared and ran. On the other hand, it would be good for me to get away from here, but I don't think Mike and me have much of a chance of fixing everything. So, do I take the chance that we can solve this or do I say the hell with it and cut strings before this gets any harder? Either way I feel like I'm failure because if I quit and stay here then I'm just running away, but if I go and things don't work out then I let myself get thrown in a situation that I knew was gonna happen. Both ways I get to kick myself in the ass. Both ways Mike gets hurt. Both ways I'm the bitch. My gut is telling me not to go...my heart is breaking at the thought....and my head is so confused that I want to go lay down and not wake up....

Heh, it's funny, everyone thought Mike would take all this badly and this would crush him, but he is holding up a lot better than I am. I feel like the weight of the world is on my shoulders and that no matter what I do someone is going to get hurt. Maybe I should just tell him it's over and lock myself in the apartment with no contact with Chris or Tobin or any of them and just go about my life. Hell, it's easier to take care of yourself than it is to try and be socially accepted when no one understands. I dunno...I'll have to talk to Mike again, maybe we can make some progress this time......"

"event","Well, considering I've gone through every other emotion in the last 6 days, I suppose anger was only a matter of time, right? So, today is my fuck the world day! I have this friend who can't see things from my point of view...he agrees with Mike in some ways that this is all in my head or that I'm giving up. He's upset that this is all goin down the way it is and he's worried about Mike. Ok, I can understand that, honestly...HOWEVER, I don't think the thought has crossed his mind that maybe this hurts me too. Ok, so he's a little jaded when it comes to girls (having been in a few shitty relationships himself) and so in his mind I'm sure I'm just some evil bitch who woke up one morning feeling bored and decided to shake things up by calling off my relationship of 3 years...but come on now, I'm not THAT fucked up in the head?! Maybe I should give him the benefit of the doubt and say maybe he was just in a bad mood when I talked to him yesterday. Maybe I should give him some time to see both sides. Maybe I shouldn't read into things so much. But what can I say, today is my anger day, so...fuck it all!

It's amazing how you can open up to people, lay it all on the line and have someone turn around and not understand a damn thing you told them. Are all guys like this? Or do I just have impeccable luck at finding people in my life, friends and otherwise, that I just don't seem to make sense to?! In most everything in life that you're ""sure"" about there is an 85% chance it will work out the way you intend...then there's that 15% that will come back to bite you in the ass every goddamn time! So I ask this: why bother taking that 15% chance? Why not just ASSUME the 15% will happen and then you'll never be let down, right? Sounds like a realistic concept...but then you're a pessimist. Then you're a downer. You're the one nobody likes to hang out with. You're the nag or the bitch. And, most importantly, you're alone.

So fine, take your chances, get burned and then what? Live to see another day??? Who the fuck cares?! Maybe I am quitting, maybe I am a stupid bitch, maybe I am the one with the problems, maybe maybe maybe.....I DON'T FUCKING CARE ANYMORE! Fuck the 15%'s! Fuck the people who don't understand! Fuck the things that don't work out! It can all get shoved sideways up everyone's asses!!!!

Fucking hell, I hate this shit...I try not to regret things in life too much. Regret only makes things worse. And, I don't regret having started this relationship with Mike, I don't regret moving to MD, I don't regret getting out of the military, the list goes on and on...but I do regret not being able to handle this situation better. I do regret having let myself get married so young when I knew it wasn't supposed to happen yet. And, I do regret not having made friends of my own after I got here to have for support (people over the phone can only offer so much). Other than that, I don't regret a single day of the last 3 years...I've been in love. I've been cared about by someone special to me. I've met people that I hope I can keep in my life after all this is said and done. But, if me and Mike don't work out, it's going to do a lot of damage to a lot of things. 1-Fox says she understands, but I know she'll act differently for a while cuz she is Mike's friend too. 2-Chad and his family probably wont be so willing to invite me over should I stick around here. 3-Chris will DEFINITELY not treat me the same. 4-People are right, Mike is would not take it very well and that is something I'll have to live with.  I never meant it to turn out this way. I know, it still sounds like I've made a definitive decision about us, huh? But, it's all easy to think about and be decisive when no one is here. When Mike gets home and I see him again, I don't know what will happen. Hell, half of me is hoping he decides that I'm a bitch and he doesn't want to be with me anymore cuz I think I could live with that easier than knowing that I fucked him over like this. Easy way out, I know....

I keep trying to put myself in Mike's shoes, trying to figure out why he can't see it. I haven't made any progress though...the only thing I can seem to see from his point of view is the pain this is causing him. Ya know, I really don't think I'm any better than the Amanda's of the world. Maybe all women are just manipulative, psychotic, flaky, lying whores. 

Ya know what, my stomach is hurting and I can't find the words anymore...I'm outta here...."

"event","I'm lost and confused. I love Mike, but I don't think I can stay with him. I don't want to lose him, but we don't understand each other. He's immature and closed off to me and yet somehow we made it this far. Is this all in my head? Am I just some tramp running around in life not knowing what commitment really is? What went wrong all of a sudden? How do you just wake up and realize that you haven't been as happy as you could be with someone? I'm looking back at past entries and they were so happy, so full of love...was that all real? Have we lost that? Or am I just over-analyzing a situation that doesn't even exist?

*bangs head on table repeatedly*

It can't be all me...other people have noticed. My mom says she doesn't think I have a problem with commitment, and as sad as it is, she'd tell me if she did...My boss describes Mike as a ""very mature 15 or 16 year old"" which would be lovely if he weren't 23. My mom thought that was hilarious...I'm ranting about things that don't even matter, I know...avoiding the subject cuz I can't think straight anymore. Six days of barely eating a thing, not knowing what day or time it is, and wanting to do nothin but sleep (when for the last few months I've been an insomniac) is starting to take it's toll. I've lost 10 pounds since Friday. Not necessarily a bad thing in itself, just the method to which it's being done is lacking a bit :/

Rambling again, I know I know....am I making the right choice? Have I made a choice yet? Seems to me like every time I think I have come to a decision something happens to change that. Mike sent me a msg today saying he loves me and doesn't want to lose me, but has he already lost me? I just don't know anymore. I think I'm too far gone to fix the problems even if he does figure it all out. Besides, it wont all be changed in the 6 weeks before we are supposed to leave. Chris says ""work it out,"" but how do you work out what only one person understands? I can't expect Mike to grow up and change for me. He can't expect me to lose some maturity and quit worrying. If we can't co-exist as we are right now, then doesn't that mean we aren't right for each other? We just have so many differences...we are from two different worlds....and I don't think the worlds can live peacefully together anymore. God I'm in so much pain....I can only imagine what this is doing to Mike...I think that's why I'm in pain. I know I can survive this, but what about Mike? Everyone keeps telling me this will crush him....I don't want to crush him. I don't even technically want to lose him....I just don't think I can be married to him...can't have both though.......

A few entries back I mentioned that my mind was wandering to other people and past relationships...technically, that's been happening a while, even before the entry. I feel guilty as shit for it too. I think that's what really got me to thinking ya know? I mean, why would my mind wander if things were perfect? And I realized that things haven't been perfect. Things weren't even really good and hadn't been for a while...

Ok, sorry, Tobin came up and we talked for a bit. As fate would have it, a friend of his up at work is getting rid of a couch, a dining room set, and a bedroom set for free. He just needs it all gone by the end of the month cause he's sellin his house. So, Tobin told the guy that since I might stay here if things don't pan out (I had asked Tobin if that might be an option and he said yes, I just need to let him know) that I might also be interested in the furniture. So, this guy is gonna call me here in the next day or two just so that if something happens I have some bases covered, ya know? I also talked to my boss the other day and asked about maybe keeping my job and he said that would be fine, it's just that he needs an answer by 1 AUG.....so, a bit of a deadline, I know, but that gives me and Mike a week after he gets back to figure shit out. If we can't make progress in a 3 week span, then it really is over whether we like it or not.

Alright, I'm gonna go cuz honestly, I've lost my train of thought. It seems to happen a lot lately. I just hit a point where I can't think anymore and I blank out. So, I'll wrap this up...laterz ya'll"

"event","Hey ya'll...I don't think me and Mike are gonna make it. We talked last night and, well, things didn't go so well. I know he loves me and I know he doesn't want to lose me, but it doesn't seem like he's willing to fight through everything in order to get me to stay. He thinks all these major problems that I'm so insistent we have are all in my head. He thinks it's all cuz I worry too much! Fuck man, do you have any idea how much that hurts???? After 3 years I can come to him and tell him (which I have been all along) that the problems we have had since day 1 still are not fixed and it's bothering me a lot since we are supposed to be MARRIED now and he responds by telling me there ARE NO PROBLEMS?! Has he lost his damned mind???? It's like he's blind to it all. Not to mention the fact that just by me coming to him and saying I'm not happy here, he should be scrambling to find out what's wrong and fix it, but instead he says ""there's nothing I can do"" or ""I don't know what you want me to fix"" or my favorite ""just tell me what to do"". I shouldn't HAVE to tell him what the problems are AGAIN. I shouldn't have to tell him how to control HIS temper or how HE should learn to communicate more. I can't force him to fix what he can't even see as a problem. God, the more I think about all this, the more I think that maybe it's been like since the beginning. Other people saw it (not gonna mention who, but there are 2 people who have told me so).....

I just thought that we could make this work. I thought we had a love strong enough to make this work. Heh, love we do have, but maybe that's just not enough all the time....I told him we need to take these next 2 weeks while he's gone to really stop and think about what we want. That we would hash the rest of this out when he gets home. I also told him that if things don't take a dramatic turn around that come September, I'm not going with him to Washington. His response is a big empty gap of dead-air and when I ask what's going through his head, he simply says ""I'm thinking about everything and I see where this is headed."" Well NO SHIT SHERLOCK! You NEED to see where this is headed. If you SEE where this is headed then what can we do to STOP IT FROM HEADING THERE?!!!!!?!!!!?!!!!!!?!!! Am I the only one that sees that maybe he's not fighting as hard as he could/should be to keep me around? Maybe he's getting tired of this too and just hasn't told me cuz he never tells me anything? Hell man, at this point, short of an act of god epiphany, I don't know that there is anything he can do to fix this. I don't want him to superficially fix problems just cuz i tell him they are a problem. I want him to genuinely fix a problems that he can acknowledge IS a problem and do it because he can't bear to lose this relationship. Is that too much to ask for?

My mom, Tobin, Fox, and Chris have all noticed that we don't communicate, that we fight A LOT, that we have some serious issues to work out and I have tried to tell Mike this time and again. And, yet somehow, Mike is the only person who cannot see it. It's all cuz I worry too much. I told him I worry too much cuz that's how I am. I don't just roll with things. I plan, I aspire to goals, I make arrangements. I'm not the type to ""wing it."" He tells me that he's just an angry person and I should live with that. I respond with, you know how much your temper bothers me and I have asked you not to change it completely, but just try to tone it down some. And you know what he tells me???? He says well, I learn to live with the fact that you always make me feel like I'm doing something wrong cuz you worry about everything so you should learn to accept me for who I am. So, ok, let me get this straight......This is the first time he has ever mentioned the fact that I ""worry to much"" or that I make him feel like he's ""constantly fucking up.""  And the reason is cuz he has learned to live with it. He is apparently happy being with me when I apparently make him feel like a fuck up all the time. Anyone catching on to my drift here? He's HAPPY with me as the manic-depressive nag that he sees me as and I should be HAPPY with him as the overly aggressive, non-communicative person I see him as. We should be HAPPY being UNHAPPY...............Is anybody on my wave length here?

I think at this point, I'm just waiting to see what conclusions he comes to by the time he gets home. If nothings changed then I'm outta here. I need a sign that it's not gonna be like this for the rest of my life, ya kow? If he can give me that then we'll work on things, but if not, then I'm not gonna prolong this just because I'm afraid to leave. Hell, that actually brings me to a whole new set of problems. I would really like to stay here in MD if I can because I don't want to move back to CT in a vulnerable state ya know? Last thing I need is to run back to old flames, if ya get my drift. I hate MD, but I do at least have a job right now (not a great one, but a paying one) and I do have friends here. Plus, I don't want to move back in with my mom after being on my own for the last 4 years. The only problem is that I'm not sure I can afford an apartment. This place I'm in now is one of the cheapest places around. Yea, me and my landlord have our differences, but it's a cheap place to stay. Unfortunately, I'm not sure I can even afford this on my salary. So what do I do? I don't know anyone I can room with. I'll probably not find a higher-paying job. And I doubt I'll find an apartment not infested with roaches in the ghetto part of MD for less than what this apartment goes for. I'll have to do some numbers crunching. Maybe I'll go talk to my landlord.......

Alright, well, I'll leave you with this link. A friend of mine had it posted in his LJ and I read it and liked it. So, I'm posting it here too. It's a good read.

"event","My stomach is in knots. My head is in a fog. I'm in a lot of pain and numb all at the same time. I feel like my world is caving in. So much keeps going wrong....so many things feel like they are falling apart. Where did I lose control of this situation? Did I ever even have control to begin with?

My doubts and fears about my marriage to Mike is coming to a head. We had our major conversation about it all a week or so ago and he blanked on me. I told him if things didn't start to fix soon that I would end up making a decision that no one would like. I asked for feedback, for thoughts, questions, concerns, ANYTHING and I got nothing. I got a ""I dunno, it's all a lot to take in."" Which, yea I understand, but 2 weeks later the convo has not come back up, at all. He is avoiding the issue, like he avoids all issues that he doesn't know how to fix. I'm not looking for some miraculous act of god, but fuck, TALK TO ME! It's been over 3 years since this relationship has started and communication has been a problem since day one. I thought maybe it was just cuz we were so far apart. Maybe once we live together things will change.... nothing has changed though. We don't talk to each other. We barely touch each other in any way other than sex. Hell, I'm never in the mood to do that either....we have problems. Problems I have pointed out to him that he hasn't changed or worked on. I think I'm starting to come to conclusions........

I talked to Fox today, who as you all know is a friend of both me and Mike's and even she kinda admitted that the problems we are having may be tearing us apart. She didn't really encourage me to chose one thing over another, but she helped put things that I already knew in perspective for me. She never offered any real advice in either direction, but she pointed out things that I was saying and making me think about why I said certain things and helped me realize that shit is starting to come to a point where there is either change and a lot of it, or this is not gonna last. Plus, I realized that we are spose to leave for the west coast in 2 months. If we can't work this out and we call it off while I'm over there, I'm screwed. What would I do. I'm not gonna stay over there, my family is all over here on the east coast, but yet I wont have money to move back or anything. I wont have any friends over there when we arrive to talk to or anything and no one to help me get through the break up if it comes to that. 

Sorry, mom called...talked to her about everything. She was surprisingly, very supportive. She, well, she told me that if I'm not happy and we have tried to work things out that maybe it is just that time. She doesn't want me to wind up like her and my dad did. Heh, not sure what I expected her to say, but that wasn't it....Mike and Chris are both at a field training exercise right now so neither of them are around to talk to and I need to talk to both of them, for different reasons, ya know? Bah....Mike's text messaging me asking why I'm acting like I'm upset and telling me that things can't be as bad as all that. It's almost like he doesn't want to hear it or see it so he tries to ignore things. That's our one major flaw ya know...lack of communication. I know I'm guilty at times too, but he's more so than I am. I'm not gonna sit here and pick at all the relationship flaws though because no offense to my friends, but that's between me and him and not something the world wide web needs to be reading.

I'm just confused ya know...I don't want to hurt him, but I can't be happy like this. I'm tired of wondering where things are going, why things wont fix, and what if things had been different. I just want things to change at this point. I NEED them to change. I need someone to talk to me. I need someone that I can actually carry on an intellectual conversation with. I need someone who doesn't pick on me 24/7 or block me out when things get tough. I need someone to show me they care from time to time, someone who would do something like stick a note in purse for me to find later, or do something spontaneous for me. Mike USED to do things like that and I've pointed that out to him, but he didn't get the hint I guess.  I don't need to be pampered ALL the time, but every once in a while I need someone to make me feel special, ya know? Plus, it always seems like every relationship I'm in, I'm the more mature one and just once, I'd like to know what it feels like to be with someone who knows how to handle his own affairs so I don't have to. I'm not saying that the person should never need my help or has to be perfect by any means, but someone who can handle their own finances without me worrying, can keep their career in good standing without me worrying and can notice when things aren't going so well in a relationship without me having to point it out. Mike still has some maturing to do. He's a wonderful guy and I love him with all my heart, but I am going crazy trying to be the one who always ""fixes things"" and coming across as the nag that I am so often called. I know there are people out there who have some of the traits I'm looking for, but I'm afraid to give up what I have in the hopes that some day I might stumble across someone who would be willing to give me these things. Mike has a lot of endearing qualities, but I don't think he has all the qualities that are right for me...we just always seem to have a couple too many differences. We always have....I just thought that it would all work out when we moved in together and lived with each other that we would find a way to fix them. But, a year later, we are having the same problems as before. Nothing has changed....and I'm starting to wonder if they ever will. My mom stayed in a relationship that she was unhappy with for YEARS and YEARS and she regrets every day of it now. I don't want to stay if I'm unhappy, but  don't want to throw away a chance that I could one day be happy if we work this out. Unfortunately, this is all just bad timing and I have to put a deadline to it. For my sanity and for the sake of the moving issue. I mean, my stomach has been in knots for 3 days now. I haven'y eaten much, I haven't slept much and I've been enjoying my time away from Mike a lil more than I probably should. It's like I miss not having someone around to talk to, but if Chris or Erika were here, I'd probably be fine with him being gone. Not because I don't love him but because we don't talk even when he is home...we fight, which isn't the same thing.

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This is just all so confusing. I just re-read some of what I've typed and I'm sure those of you reading this, you have got the impression that my mind is made up already...maybe it is...maybe it has been for a while now. I need more than someone to hold me at night. I need someone I can relate to on most levels and someone who can offer me more than good sex, lol...Mike is a wonderful person, I just don't know if he's there yet. God, I guess I have come to some conclusions...I knew writing things down and talking to people (especially Fox who has seen both sides since day one) would help collect my thoughts. I kinda wish they collected in another direction, but....so, I guess this means I have a lot to think about before he gets home cuz if I do call this off, I don't want to completely crush him by saying something wrong. I know this is gonna hurt...it's gonna hurt both of us, but if he can't fix things before September I just don't think I have another choice...at least not anything I can think of....

Alright, I think this entry is long and confusing enough so I'll go now. Thanks for listening to me rant again ya'll.

<center><font color= purple> **BTW, if ya'll like the alternative softer rock genre of music, I recommend checking out Chris's brother's band! They are called the Seldon Plan. Very good group, went to see them playing last night and I was impressed. They can be a lil rough around the edges cuz they basically started as just a lil garage band and have saved and scrounged to get a record or two out, but I think they have the potential to be a lot more. So, I'm trying to get the word out! Stop by their site and listen to their music if you can please :) http://www.theseldonplan.com**</font></center>"

"event","This is fucking bullshit! Why in the blue fucking hell does it always seem like I have the worst luck?? That wedding that I've been planning for a year now...MY wedding....just got canceled!! We just found out that Mike is definitely scheduled to PCS on 20 September to Ft. Lewis, Washington for in-processing and we can't get in touch with his new command to ask if he can be authorized for leave after he gets there because (get this) they don't know WHICH base we are going to yet!!! They WONT know till AFTER we arrive at Ft. Lewis to in-process!!!! Which means we can't get approved for leave till after we arrive which would only be a month before the wedding and we can't wait that long to find out if we will even be able to have the wedding. Thus, wedding has been canceled.

THEN, to top it off, Mike keeps talking bout ""let's just have it the following year"" but what he fails to take into consideration is 1- Fox will be in Japan at that time with Mango so she wont be able to afford to fly back to be the maid of honor, 2- Ft. Lewis is a highly deployable base, so there is a chance that Mike may get sent to Iraq for a tour after we arrive in Washington (which is possible since they already deployed one group of Tangos over there to act as population control for rabid dogs), and 3- We can't fly with our sick lil pup so that would mean a 2 week leave time turns into 3 or 4 weeks on account of having to drive TO and FROM the west coast (which it's prob. doubtful that his command would authorize that much leave not to mention I wont get that many vacation days as a civi)!

This fucking blows nuts! If we do have the wedding another year, I'll have to re-buy all the wedding invitation supplies since I already MADE the ones for this year.....the only good thing is that the places we already paid are acting cool about it and offering to hold onto our non-refundable deposits till 2006 instead of just eating the money. This blows...I got married early so we could save money for a wedding we aren't even having. So now, not only does my wedding day mean nothing since technically I'm already married and will have been for TWO FUCKING YEARS before the WEDDING day, but I was already starting to have doubts about having gotten married too early so now I have just one more thing to dwell on :( 

*screams at the top of her lungs: FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCKING HEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEELL THIS SUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCKS!*

Fuck it! Whatever! Nothing ever works out the way it should...nothing's ever easy....

Life always has been and will always be one big emotional roller coaster for me. It just seems like I spend more time plummeting towards the ground than I do climbing up to the top. Maybe it's all me...I know I tend to be pessimistic about things so maybe this torment is all a web of my own doing. But then again, you have to admit that life is one big case of ""bad timing"" for me. Anyhow, I'm not gonna psychoanalyze myself tonight...save that for another time. G'night ya'll"

"event","You ever just get into a rut? I mean, nothing horribly wrong with your life, but you just can't find a way to be happy or content...I don't know what my problem is! I have a good life. I'm almost 22, living on my own, with a loving husband, a good paying job, and friends that care about me. Yet, here I sit at 12am on a Sunday night, crying, wondering what's the matter with me. Heh...funny how life works. I have a someone in my life that loves me unconditionally, yet I question how and why we are still together, when I should just be grateful that we are. Old habits die hard huh? It seems like every relationship I have ever been in I have fucked up cuz of my doubts and fears. Why the hell am I so afraid of commitment?! Just cuz it took me 3 years in this relationship to get to this point, it was inevitable, right? I can't run away from this one though...Christ, I'm married now! And here I sit asking ""what would it have been like if (enter old friend/boyfriend's name here) had worked out."" I mean I haven't considered anyone seriously, ya know...but I just keep wondering if things might be different, if I hadn't fucked up so many other relationships. Speaking of past ex's....I got a message from Adam. He's getting married June 18th to Catrina. He admitted to me that those girls he fucked right after we broke up, were lies. He was just trying to hurt me for making him hurt....heh, how do you respond to that one?

I was talkin Tobin yesterday after me and Mike had a small falling out and he said that he has noticed I have some fears about being hurt. He thinks if I come to grips with who/what hurt me so bad the first time, that me and Mike will get through our probs easier. Which all that sounds like a novel idea and all, but I don't know where the root of my issue is?! I feel like there has just been a lot of small things that have happened to hurt and wound me. I know some of it comes from my parents and all the arguing when I was little. Part is probably from Melissa and my high school issues with manic depressive friends. Then there is Fred, I'm sure...not to mention a dozen other painful relationships. But how do you just forget that people have hurt you and move on with life? It's been years and yet I still feel jaded about people I meet. It's like my skin has thickened which is good cuz I get hurt less, but bad because I don't let people in as much anymore. I suppose that is the problem right there...I grow a spine and some thick skin and I get hurt a lot less, but I also turn into more of a caustic bitch, with no friends. How do you find the balance? How do you be both thick-skinned and sensitive? Both open-minded and realistic? Both the all-loving person I was and the jaded one I am now?

I feel completely alone, but I don't wear my emotions on my sleeve anymore, so no one knows I'm sad. I have friends, but my friends are Mike's friends and so I can't really go to them and feel comfortable. I have no female friends up here in MD to hang out with. I dunno....I'm probably overreacting, as usual. I'm sure it's the sleep deprivation talking right now. I forgot to mention that...I don't sleep so well anymore. It's an on and off thing, but I seem to sleep less on weekdays, when I know work is coming back into the picture.

Did I mention I don't like my job? It pays real well and the hours aren't bad, but I'm just a piddly receptionist for the most part. I only get to do basic tech stuff and my boss is a dipshit sometimes. My college is fuckin me over with my degree, so I have no college education to stand on. I got kicked out of the Army, so I'm a flunky there too. And the first job I get comin out of all that is a fuckin receptionist position. How fuckin lame am I...

You remember being a kid with dreams and hopes for your future? You remember promising yourself that you wouldn't let yourself fall into the same traps as your parents? I feel like all those hopes and dreams are going down the drain and I'm doin what I always swore I wouldn't do...I feel like I'm becoming that which I hated most...I have a routine, that I hate, and I'm afraid that I'll never be able to get out of that routine. God...I need some sleep...I'm gonna go lay down and try to get some rest. Thanks for listening to me vent ya'll"

"event","Yea, so that last entry that said ""tomorrow is my last day""...ever-so-slightly erroneous.......Ya see, I found out the hard way on the 12th that I needed 3 years service to still qualify for my Montgomery GI Bill. But guess what? The 12th put me 13 days short of 3 years. So, my command was gracious enough to extend me for 13 days. Of course, all my household goods had already been shipped so I lived off of fast food, 1 set of BDUs, and only enough scrubs to last me for a few days before having to do laundry again. Oh well, whatever...I'm officially out now. I became official on the 26th and now I'm sitting in South Carolina at my step-dads place for a week before I head up to Maryland to see my sweety :) I'm handling it all pretty well this time around. I mean, minimal tears...I think it hasn't completely hit me yet. I keep thinking I'm on vacation or something, ya know? Heh, permanent vacation...

So, overall I'm doing far better than expected, but I'm also not completely living in reality right now. Fox was a mess...we went to dinner my last night in the area and she started balling afterward. I felt terrible, but I managed to stay strong enough that we weren't there for 2 hours sobbing in each other's shoulders. Well, hey, I'm gonna get goin cuz I'm getting hungry and Mike will be home soon. Laterz ya'll"

God, I knew this life was never really for me...I knew this day would come because I'm just not made for this lifestyle, but damn it I never thought it would hurt this much to walk away from it...I mean, this was what I wanted right? I didn't want to be in Pensacola anymore right? Then why am I so goddamn sad to be leaving?! SFC Miller went on leave Friday so I'll never see him again...and he didn't even say goodbye...he just left...and today was the last weekend I'll probably ever get to spend with Fox...we may have fought a lot and had our differences, but that girl has been there for me through so much...I'm really really gonna miss her...and the Mochmers, they were so damn nice...and...*cries*

How do I walk away from being a soldier?? How do I become just one of millions of nameless civilians? How do I just walk away, unemployed, stripped of everything I worked for here, with no college education and no real certifications to get me started? Where do I go from here? I almost feel like I'm losing a part of myself...like I'm losing a part of my pride or something deeper that I can't explain...

I think I need to go...my head is starting to hurt from crying...

Not quite how I envisioned my 21st birthday...I spent my entire day sitting out on a picnic bench trying to act like I enjoyed a ""mandatory fun-day"" with my branch. I'm halfway through a nasty little cold and 1 day away from starting to PMS.  I lost my book at the stupid Organizational day and along with it my bookmark (which just happens to be one of the last things my parents gave me as a couple before the divorce).  Then we got to dinner and I order 2 Margaritas, that while good as they may have been, didn't get me at all buzzed and now my stomach hurts.  So, I'm sitting in my room, alone, on a Friday night (god, could a girl's 21st fall on a better day????), feeling like ass, and sad to boot. How pathetic....

Eh, whatever, they say you only turn 21 once, but it's not a big deal...just another day like the one before. Oh well, I'm gonna go to bed now and sleep away the rest of my ""party."""

<img src=""http://images.quizilla.com/Q/quizsterr/1083250892_ZealotQ.gif"" border=""0"" alt=""Zealot.gif""><br><b>You are most likely to be the Vampire<br>Zealot!</b><br>
The Zealot is the vampire that is utterly addicted<br>to what it is. Overcome by the sensations and<br>capabilities it possesses, it exists to simply<br>enjoy anything and everything pertaining to its<br>heightened vampire existence; it lusts for all<br>things available to it, blood, sex, power,<br>money, immortality. Neither identifiably<br>well-intentioned or malicious, these are<br>trivial matters to the zealot, as its existence<br>is focused on the sensations it can achieve.<br>The zealot always appears most seductive and<br>alluring, an utter sex symbol. As it is always<br>pushing the limits of what it can do for the<br>sheer pleasure of doing so, often it can be a<br>very powerful vampire, simply from the sheer<br>experience of its addiction.
<p>
Dominant personality trait: Lust<br>
Dominant color: Red<br>
Fictional Vampire Examples: LeStat ('Interview with<br>the Vampire'), Claudia ('Interview with the<br>Vampire')

Curious to see how you would fare as a creature of<br>the night? Come this way...

 TopGun2021:  but of course
 Armychic6669:  I'm glad to see you haven't let all this change ya completely! You're still the same ol' Rob, hehe 



The rest of the conversation was just catchin up a lil more...you get the idea. Anyhow, it's one thing to be in the state-side Army and it's another to be infantry...I guess I never realized that I know more people in the line of fire than I thought, ya know? Well, I'm gonna get goin...but do me a favor, in whatever way any of you out there pray, keep our boys and my friends in your thoughts, k? Here's a final thought...pass it on!


This is a letter from Ray Reynold, a medic in the Iowa Army National Guard, serving in Iraq:

As I head off to Baghdad for the final weeks of my stay in Iraq, I wanted to say thanks to all of you who did not believe the media. They have done a very poor job of covering everything that has happened. I am sorry that I have not been able to visit all of you during my two-week leave back home. And just so you can rest at night knowing something is happening in Iraq that is noteworthy, I thought I would pass this on to you. This is the list of things that has happened in Iraq recently: (Please share it with your friends and compare it to the version that your paper/TV is putting out.)
*Over 400,000 kids have up-to-date immunizations.
*School attendance is up 80% from levels before the war.
*Over 1,500 schools have been renovated and rid of the weapons stored there so education can occur.
*The port of Uhm Qasar was renovated so grain can be off-loaded from ships faster.
*The country has its first 2 billion barrel export of oil in August.
*Over 4.5 million people have clean drinking water for the first time ever in Iraq.
*The country now receives 2 times the electrical power it did before the war.
*100% of the hospitals are open and fully staffed, compared to 35% before the war.
*Elections are taking place in every major city, and city councils are in place.
*Sewer and water lines are installed in every major city.
*Over 60,000 police are patrolling the streets.
*Over 100,000 Iraqi civil defense police are securing the country.
*Over 80,000 Iraqi soldiers are patrolling the streets side by side with US soldiers.
*Over 400,000 people have telephones for the first time ever
*Students are taught field sanitation and hand washing techniques to prevent the spread of germs.
*An interim constitution has been signed.
*Girls are allowed to attend school.
*Textbooks that don't mention Saddam are in the schools for the first time in 30 years.

Don't believe for one second that these people do not want us there. I have met many, many people from Iraq that want us there, and in a bad way. They say they will never see the freedoms we talk about, but they hope their children will. We are doing a good job in Iraq and I challenge anyone, anywhere to dispute me on these facts. So if you happen to run into John Kerry, be sure to give him my email address and send him to Denison, Iowa. This soldier will set him straight.
I you are like me and very disgusted with how this period of rebuilding has been portrayed, email this to a friend and let them know there are good things happening.

"event","Wow, I SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO needed to do homework today and I just spent the last 12 hours, online, talking to one person. lol...yea, so I was going back reading some of my old entries and it's amazing how much things really do change. I mean, in one entry I wrote that I thought Rob and Cormier would be my friends till the end and I haven't spoken to either of them in a VERY long time. Last time I heard from Drew was god, at least 7 or 8 months ago I think and Rob, well that was before Christmas cuz he was getting ready to head home from Korea. In other entries I talk about Fred and how much I love him, when now adays, I can barely stand to talk to him. Then Will, well, we hardly ever talk anymore either. My entry bout Fox and I always at each other's throats doesn't quite hold up anymore...everything is just so different. I can honestly say that very few things in my life have stayed somewhat the same. 
1- Me and my mom are still closer than me and my dad. 
2- Sherman is really the only person I've known who hasn't stopped talking to me or has become less of a friend to me.
3- And, I do still talk to Adam from time to time.

Yea, that's about it...everything else is completely different. I haven't talked to Sara since my goin away party. I barely talk to Erin or Larry or Dan C. anymore. I have no clue where Veronica is these days, neither do Sherman or Adam. I don't talk to my buddy Dan from the store much. Mom doesn't even live in Waterbury anymore. The Army isn't as bad as I thought it would be, nor has it been as great as everyone wanted me to believe it would be. Hell, not that it matters much at this point with them discharging me and all. Lol, ironically...Drew doesn't even know...eh, maybe I'll try to contact him again someday. 

It's funny cuz, I miss home and the way things used to be, but at the same time I don't want to go back to it. I miss all the good times, but I could so do without the bad. I try not to live in my past anymore, but sometimes you can't help wonder what might have been, ya know? What if I had never been friends with this person? What if I had never dated that guy? What if i HAD dated a different guy? Don't get me wrong, I realize that all my experiences have led me to be who I am today and in the place I'm in today, but sometimes you just have to wonder. I'm happy with Mike, we work great together...we are a lil far apart at the moment, but hey, can't have everything right? lol...so, don't think I'm having any doubts about us or anything. These are just passing thoughts.

Oh my good god, is it really 10pm? Wow...alrighty then, I think it might be time for me to go to bed now. No wonder my thoughts are reminiscent, lol...ok, G'night ya'll"

"event","Ok, so maybe this entry wont be quite as juicy as the last one, but ya know, it's kinda hard to top that one! lol...well, quick update: I'm officially on my way out of the Army. They are guessing that 1 JUN will be my discharge date. We will see if that actually holds :) If they hold true though, then that means only 30 more days till I get to have sex again, lol...see, always a silver lining! And who says I always look at things the negative way, hehe...I can be opptimistic with the best of them. Have I mentioned yet that I'm horny again? What is it about the weekends? Maybe it is all the spare time to sit and think about all the things I'm NOT doing and would love to BE doing. I mean, I'm exhausted, been a long week and all I can think about is a long sensual bathe, with candles and lots of bubbles...being rubbed down with soap and licking water off my man's chest, drop-by-drop...long, slow kisses...30 more days huh? hehe

So some of my family might be moving up north again, I'm excited! I'll be within drivin distance of so many people when I get to D.C.!! Friends, family...far enough away to have my own life and close enough to visit on a long weekend. That sounds like fun to me, hehe...*yawns* I'm gettin sleepy...and all my friends and people I was talkin to up and left. Don't they know I can't amuse myself when I'm bored? lol...bored bored...I can't even go to Sparknotes and take online tests because I took them all last weekend :( Hmm...let's see...there has to be something...eh, TV it is...laterz!"

"event","Not that any of you REALLY need to be reading this entry, but I gotta get this all out of my system somehow and writing might help me a lil. So, here goes...Those of you who actually knew me  a few years ago, remember how dark I got sometimes? How flirtatious and seductive I sometimes got? Ok, most of you wouldn't really know THAT much about me...nevermind...the point is that my dark demons are resurfacing right now. Like, ok, let me paint a picture:

Right now, I want to be wearing my tightest black leather pants, my sexiest top (which just happens to be a lavender and black boustier), high-heeled black sandals, my dog collar with the chain, and just enough to black makeup to make me look sexy and dirty all at the same time. Of course I'm not wearing any of that cuz I have no where to go in it. But, the point is that I want to be walking through a room right now with heads turning, knowing that people are staring at me. Problem, the one who would need to be here to fulfill every last one of my little needs is in D.C. at the moment. But, assuming we were together...

I want to feel the tension building, knowing that sheer will-power alone is keeping him from throwing me on the floor and tearing my clothes off. I want to sway my hips and know that everyone noticed. I want to rub against him knowing that he can feel every inch of my body that close to his. I want him to want me so bad he can taste it, hungers for it. I want to get him alone and know that I'm in complete control of how fast the situation moves, but that he is using every once of his being to not toss me around like a rag doll. I want him to be able to taste me before he even gets near me. I want him to be aggressive, pull my hair, pin me to a wall, and bite my neck without abandon. I want to feel his fingers fumbling to undress me because he is trying to hard to get me out off my clothes. I want to see pure passion and hunger and need in his eyes. To be at the point where things are being forcefully moved slow enough that it doesn't end in a heartbeat, even when both of us just want it fast and hard. I want to know that he wants nothing more in the world then to have me in his arms and to feel my heart racing against him. I want to know that if I pushed him down and pinned him to the bed that he wouldn't fight me...just lay there willing me to make the next move. I want to feel the power that comes from being in control, but knowing that he is constantly fighting the urge to just take me, throw me down, and pound me till I scream. I want it slow and sensual, yet forceful and passionate. I want to be dominated and in control all at the same time. I just want raw sex, here, now.

That little piece of me that makes me my old ""demon-spawn"" self is trying to peak it's little head out. My dark side that is a combination between a dominatrix and morbid ice-queen is trying to surface. There have only been a few times in my past that I felt this way. It usually came out around Fred since he was such a bad influence on me, lol...but right now, it's just my overactive imagination wanting sex and passion from the man I love. God it's been to long since I've felt this way. Every morbid fascination, every twisted fantasy, every dark desire just wants to come screaming out right now. Wow, I missed this feeling...I was starting to wonder if I had finally turned away from this side of myself. I was starting to wonder if I could even pull off the Goth seductress anymore. Damn a lil turned on right now, lol...ok, well, I'm gonna go, but writing this did help ever-so-little, hehe...sweet dreams ya'll...."

"event","I gotta tell you, a lot has happened these last couple days. I mean, it's amazing how things seem to work out sometimes. God, so much to tell and I have no idea where to begin, lol...ok, first, let's start with yesterday:

I get to work yesterday and Jodi (our civ. tech) tells me that the Cordova Mall is having this fundraiser for the American Cancer Society. You can go donate hair to Locks of Love so they can make wigs for children with cancer. Well, my hair has gotten quite long, I mean, it almost went all the way to my waist. So, yea, I love my long hair and had no intentions of cutting it, but Fox (co-worker/best friend), she has this little cousin, Gabe, who has Leukemia. And, well, poor Gabe lost all his hair during Chemo. and as I'm sitting there thinking about all my hair, I'm seeing his picture she showed me, all bright, cheerful, and all smiles...with no hair. Well, I decided to call down to the mall and get the details. And, yes, I did it. I donated 10 inches of may hair to Locks of Love...it made me feel so good too. I mean, I just kept picturing poor Gabe and remembering Fox telling me that he had overcome his cancer and his hair was finally growing back in when he got sick again. The poor kid had to start Chemo. again and lost all his hair for the second time in his short life. I just, I can't imagine what that must feel like..to be sick and feeling so terrible, but on top of that to have to face the world looking different than everyone else too. Ya, so, I think I'm going to start growing my hair out every year so that I can cut it and donate it to the Cancer Society. I was blessed with long, thick hair for a reason and I never understood until yesterday what that reason was. I almost forgot how good it feels to do things for others...

Anyhow, my next story is a bit different, but no less touching. Ok, so, I'm running clinic today with Dr. Zettler and this older man comes in with his cat for annual vaccines. Well, I ask how he is doing and he's says he's ""still kicking."" Well, this man turns out to be a retired Army veteran. He served 22 years and worked his way up from enlisted to Chief Warrant Officer. At 85 years old, this poor man had more war stories and battle wounds than you could ever imagine. He told Dr. Z and I about his tour in WWII, how he met Gen. Douglas MacArthur, how he became a POW for 3 years. This man, was abused so badly as a POW that they broke the femur head in his hip. He stayed 3 months in a death ward of a POW camp with a 103 temp before a doctor finally tossed him a towel said ""chew on this"" and took a razor blade to the abscess that formed on his hip. He told us about his first kill. He told us he killed 6 other men, but missed the one above him that dropped a grenade at his feet!!! He has scars, wounds, back aches and pains from grenades and POW abuse. I mean, can you imagine? This man saw the Baton Death March from the banks of the other side of the bay and didn't know until later what he was witnessing. He served in Korea before the war ended. He showed us a card he had that had a picture of all his medals. He has 3 Purple Hearts, a POW medal, about 6 other various war medals, about 10 International medals (one of which has 51 battle stars on it). And that doesn't include all the regular ribbons he got just from serving in the places he did.

I don't know how to explain it, but it was awe inspiring. To actually meet a living piece of history. To talk to a man who not only saw those wars first hand, but lived through more ordeals than anyone could imagine in their nightmares. I gotta tell ya, history class does those wars no justice. There is so much more to the stories than you can learn from a history class or two. I just, I was surprised at how open this guy was to sharing all his experiences, but ya know, Tom put that into perspective for me...he made the comment that the man was talking ""to his own."" You don't realize it, but unless you have served in the service, there are just some things that you will never understand. I can't relate to him about a lot of what he said, but there is an unspoken bond between service members. I wanted to stand up and salute this man for making it so I can live in freedom. And, he didn't do anything so spectacular that he got his name in the books, but he's a war hero. He saved more lives than I could even imagine. It's men like him that keep our flag flying high. God, I have never been so proud to be a soldier. I'm not saying that the Army is what is best for me, but I am so proud that I had the chance to do my part at keeping this country moving. Maybe I never saw war and maybe I never fired a M16 in self-defense, but I was (even for a short time) a part of the greatest fighting force the world has ever seen. I kept Working Dogs healthy that detect bombs that could kill people. I keep infectious diseases from spreading to our soldiers so that they can keep fighting to protect our country. These are small things that you don't realize in your day-to-day life. I mean, I have a normal job. I do paperwork and work as a Veterinary technician, but I am so much more than that and I tend to forget sometimes how important of a job I have. I'm a soldier and I'm proud to be able to say that I share a bond with men like the one I met today. 

You appreciate life a little more when it all gets put into perspective for you. I'm healthy, I'm alive, I'm doing something useful with my life...and, even when I get out, no one can take that away from me...ever! 


Soldier's Code:
I.      I am an American soldier - a protector of the greatest nation on earth sworn to uphold the Constitution of the United States.  

II.    I will treat others with dignity and respect and expect others to do the same.

III.  I will honor my Country, the Army, my unit and my fellow soldiers by living the Army values.

IV.  No matter what situation I am in, I will never do anything for pleasure, profit, or personal safety which will disgrace my uniform, my unit, or my Country.

V.    Lastly, I am proud of my Country and it's flag.  I want to look back and say that I am proud to have served my Country as a soldier."

"event","Been a long, long time...maybe too long. I'm not really to sure where to begin. So much has happened in my life since my last entry. Hmmm...well, I've been here in Pensacola for 2 years now. Two years to long, I can assure you. I've been flagged for a PT failure for a year and 1/2 of those two. Basically, that translates to no promotions, no awards, and a hell of a lot of running. Uh, let's see, I still hate the way the Army treats me. I'm still with Mike (Kelley)...in fact, we're engaged now. The wedding will prolly be 31 Oct. 2005. Yea...that covers all the basics...

I gotta tell ya, my life ain't workin with me lately. I'm on this emotional rollercoaster and only part of that is caused by outside forces. Most of it is self-inflicted these days. I mean, the Army has been dicking me around for almost 2 years bout PT...""we're kicking ya out""...""we're not kicking ya out""...""on second thought, maybe we will kick ya out."" They can't make up their damn mind. So, yea, they started it, but now, well, now they might actually me kicking me out and that thought has me scared to death. I mean, don't get me wrong, I don't love Pensacola or the Army, but....god, well, it's all I know...

Look at it this way: Pretty much all my old high school buddies went from HS to college without a hesitation. They are all practically OUT of college by now with degrees and everything. Then, well, then there is me. I have barely any college and what I do have costs a small fortune to continue. So, basically, I win the lotto or I will never have a college degree. Do you have any idea how difficult it is to get a job in today's society without a college degree??? Then, to top it off, I don't know how to grow up yet. I mean, the Army way of life is all I've known for 3 years now. So, what happens when I don't have a steady guaranteed paycheck? How do the bills get paid? 

Goin with the Army life thing, how do I be a civilian????? I know that sounds like a really strange question, but anyone who has served in the military would understand perfectly. I mean, how do you go from wearing a uniform everyday that everyone respects to just being plain-old-jane? I never had much pride in myself or my country, but after you have been in for a little while, it grows on you. No matter why you joined, you start to love your job, your purpose in life, your pride in your country and your flag. It scares me to think that someday, someday soon, I wont ever be able to wear that uniform again. I wont be able to salute the flag or stand, full of pride, at the position of attention when the National Anthem is played. Shit, that sounds cheesy even to me, but strangely enough, it's true.

There is also the small problem of finding a decent job with minimal experience, no technician certifications, and no college degrees. No one is going to want to hire an Army drop-out. Goddamn it! It's not like I can't do my fucking job! I mean, really...I'm damn good at what I do! But can I get promoted to Specialist? nope...do I get a pat on the back saying good job? nope...heh...wonderful thing, the Army...it doesn't matter how good a worker you are. If you can't run quite fast enough they say see ya later, have a nice life. 

Ya know what? Crying makes you VERY tired at 10:30 at night, lol...so, yea...off to bed soon I guess...I'll try to write again later. I'm sure I'll have more tomorrow :/"

"event","So, ok, last time I wrote, I was not too happy, right? Well...things are a bit different now.  See, I don't sit around being upset about my past relationships anymore and I don't sit around waiting for people who don't really care to call me.  Instead, I sit around with my baby. LOL, I know, you are wondering what in the blue hell I am talking about...Mike (well, Kelley as you know him).  We have been going out for about 3 months now and my god, I have never been so completely enamored by someone in my life.  I absolutely just love spending time with him and he treats me like I am the greatest thing to ever walk to earth. 

Another quick update: I went home to CT last week...and well, I didn't end up seeing anyone from days past. Drew was conveniently on leave the same week I was home and my Fred plans were canceled.  I think I will probably call Drew sometime this week though cuz to be honest with you, I miss his friendship. Regardless of what happened between us in the last few months, I want to have my best friend back, ya know? I suppose if I want that then I need to stop calling him Drew cuz that's not who he was to me as a friend. So, he is back to Cormier. Perhaps he will be able to forget everything like I'm trying to and we can start over as big brother, lil sister.

Alright, I'm gonna go now, I just wanted to let ya know that things are finally going ok for me. Not because work is good or life is making me happy, but because I finally know what it is like to be in love and actually have someone feel the same way I do :) Bye for now...."

I think part of it is that I had a dream last night that upset me. It's not the first dream I have had like this since I got down here to P'cola, but I dreamt about my SMMS and SHHS friends. Marissa, Hadley, Joey and his sis, Hank, Jenny, Sam, the Rossis, Will (who doesn't really fit there), Krista, god...they were all there...I mean, the dream wasn't a really upsetting one, but I started to cry at the end of it cuz I sat in the corner and just could not believe how much time had changed them all. Everything, and I mean, everything was different.  They were the same, but I could not for the life of me, fit in with any of them.

"event","It's so weird how things work out they way they do. I mean, ok, maybe my life wasn't exactly going well, but it was going and then life threw something else at me. Don't get me wrong, I'm not entirely complaining, but at the same time, it's confusing. All right, I guess I should explain myself, huh?

Let's start at the very beginning...Remember the guy from before? The one that made me feel so great and then dismissed me? Well, I suppose it's about time I gave him a name. This mystery guy is Drew. None of you even really know him by that name, but it's ok...it's just to make it easier for me to talk about him.  See, I miss Drew. I don't think I miss what began between us as much as I just miss his friendship, but regardless of HOW I miss him, I still miss him.  Kelley, Fox, and I passed a TGIFridays yesterday and I damn near started crying cuz that is where we always used to go. It's just so weird to not be able to call him after a long day just to say ""hey, what's goin on?"" For a year and a half Drew was one of my best friends, hell, he was my only friend for a while. And, well, now I don't feel as if I could call him even if my whole world were fallin to pieces.  The last time we talked he snapped at me for nothing at all. That's not like him. I mean, I had been getting the impression before that maybe he didn't want to really talk to me and that kinda proved it, ya know? I just don't know what to do. All right, I wont lie, yes, part of me just misses the way he made me feel for the short amount of time that we started to get serious, but at the same time, I just want my best friend back...

So, ok, I'm not 100% over Drew yet...the flip side would be that I AM 100% over Fred as anything more than a good friend or one-night stand. I love the boy with all of my heart and soul, but I could never be with him as anything more than a friend. Fred doesn't treat me well enough for that. Of course, I always realized that I never fully got over Will either. I don't know why that is though. I know that I keep sayin in one entry that I'm over Will as anything more than a friend and then contradicting myself in another, but that's how it has been working. For a few weeks I'll hardly think about him at all and when I do it's just on a friendly basis and then the next week I'll be wishing I could have been with him as more when I was home.  I realize that with me so far away for so long that I could never start anything with Will now, but part of me wonders if maybe we could try a couple years down the road, ya know? It's not like I'm pining over the boy it's just that as a passin thought, I miss him too. I mostly just miss talkin to him as much as I used to, but I do also miss the thought of having his emails to come home too. You know, the ones that were all sweet and stuff. Ya, I'm pathetic, but hey, Will was one of the few REALLY attractive guys that were interested in me. Hell, all the other guys I've dated, I've pretty much convinced myself that they were cute. Drew, Fred, and Will were my 3 exceptions and I think that may be part of the reason I clung to all of them. I mean, knowing that a guy THAT attractive, who could get any girl, was actually attracted to ME just blew my mind and boosted my self esteem so much. It's stupid, I know, but I think that was/is part of my reasoning...

Anyways, another update: I talked to Ray!! He is doin good up in VA. He's just as sweet as ever too. Oh, and Bazal left...Fox isn't too happy, to say the least, but she is handling it fairly well.It's so weird to have the final chapter of month one close out...Bazal was the last of the original group. I actually started to cry at that thought the night before he left and me and Bazal never fully got along.

All right, I guess I need to get to the main topic now.  Remember mention of Kelley? The guy I work with that came to Disney with us and everything? Well, me and him have been getting closer. I mean, he spends basically every night in my room and we just cuddle. Nothing really sexual has happened between us and he knows that I'm still on the rebound from everything back home and Ray and Matt and just life itself. But, we cuddle a lot...He's bought me flowers twice already, just for the hell of it. It was so sweet. The problem is that I don't have much of a desire to be with him sexually. Like, ok, we have messed around a lil and I'm not turned off by it or anything and the gods know that I have the best time in the world teasing him, but it stops there. Maybe that is a good thing that I want to take this slow. The problem is that if I think about having sex with Fred or Will or any other guy that I find attractive, I get turned on by it. When I think about having sex with Kelley, nothing happens. I don't get turned off, but I don't get turned on either. Now, don't get me wrong, I find Kelley to be attractive and I do like him a lot.  The thing is though, there was no instant spark like with all the other guys. Well, ok, there was no instant spark with Ray or Drew either, but once things started to happen between us I realized that I did have feelings for them and I did want to be with them. With Kelley I realized I had feelings for him, but I don't know if I want to really be with him. I am loving all the attention and he is so sweet, but god, I'm confused. I want something magical and I am never going to get that. So, in the meantime, I have set myself up for a whole shit load of pain. I want one of those movie love stories to happen to me and I know that will never happen. It's just that I have come close to having those type of relationships with guys and then they always fizzle out (ex: Drew) So then I get ordinary guys like Kelley in my life who are willing to treat me like gold and not rush me or pressure me and I don't want them cuz it's not magical enough. I'm so pathetic, but I don't know how I truly feel bout the boy.

I know deep down that I do care about Kelley lots. I mean, I actually got sad all week when he was SIQ with Strep Throat cuz I couldn't see him at work. But, on the other hand, I am glad he is out at Wallmart with Fox right now and not hanging on me. I just don't know what to think! Part of me loves being with him and part of me finds so many things about him that I don't want to be around. Yet, the people who don't treat me the way he does, I want to be with.  Take Fred for example. When I was in love with Fred I could see no wrong in the boy. Granted, I've overcome that, but there was a time when the boy would toy with my emotions and yet I loved him more than life itself. Then there is Drew. I mean, he has practically dismissed me as a friend and otherwise, but yet, if he ever called me and told me that something had happened and he wanted to see me, I would drop everything, empty my bank account and fly home to be with him. I get snapped at for nothing, but yet, I would put my life on hold for the man. Not to mention the fact that I wish him extreme happiness cuz I respect him just as much as I respect my own mother. Then you look at Kelley who treats me like gold, buys me flowers and makes me feel so special and I'm like ""yea, he's ok"" All right, at least I don't think of him the way I was thinking about Joe right? I mean, Joe was a really bad situation cuz he treated me well and yet I really questioned how I felt about him. It's not like that with Kelley. I know I like him a lot. I jut don't know if this will ever pan out to anything and I don't know if I enjoy the affection more than his company.  Now you see why I said I'm confused and grateful at the same time??

Perhaps I create my own problems, but what am I supposed to do? It just seems like every time things start to go better, shit starts to get crazy. For example, I have a record APFT coming up in April. If I don't pass this PT test, I'm fucked! Failure means many repercussions. Not to mention the fact that I am going to have to get taped again. Failing that means getting flagged and put on certain restrictions and shit. God, that would crush me...I know I'm not any better than I was a month ago either. I mean, I have been trying to watch what I eat and stuff, but it's not working that well. Food is expensive and it's either buy food that is cheap or buy food that is healthy. Plus, the only means I have of cooking is a microwave. Those combinations don't make for very healthy food options. So, basically, I'm down to just not eating. Which, for a week or two I have been doin ok at. I have only been eating like one meal a day and not snacking and then again, I have been pretty damn tired and weak lately. So, yea, I can't win. I don't fucking care anymore and yet at the same time, I'm forced to care. No one understand either. Kelley and Fox keeping arguing with me that I'm not fat, but shit, my clothes don't fit right and according to regs, I AM fat. So WTF?! I haven't been able to look at myself and feel good in a long time. I mean, for the first time in 8 months, I actually had a ""sorta-feel-good"" day. It wasn't even a full feel-good-day, but it was nice. Of course, I haven't felt that way since cuz I have put on shorts since then. Plus, SGT Long told me I have lunch-lady arms the other day. He was just kidding, but it's still true. I mean, I have always had lunch lady arms. Ya know, the point of me joining the Army was to get in shape, right? Well, I have gotten into shape, but I have gained so much weight that it all cancelled out!!! I feel like shit...I feel so beyond unattractive. And, well, everyone I know keeps making jokes about it trying to be funny, but I don't see the humor. Like Will, he called me a heifer and I know, again, it was all in jest, but shit, it didn't help me any. You don't say things unless part of you, even if it's subconsciously, believes it...

It doesn't help that for the first time in a while I'm actually home-sick. Well, sorta...mostly I just miss my doggies. Kelley, Fox, and I were all at the mall yesterday and they had this little Daschund in the window that looked exactly like Lil' Bit when he was younger. OMG, I was 2 seconds away from buying him.  If we were allowed to have pets here in the barracks, I would own a dog right now. I miss my babies. I miss being able to take them for rides and spoil them. I miss watching them play. I just miss my babies!!

Ok, I'm done...I'm gonna get goin now...I will leave you with this:

Ya know it's really weird how life works...It will throw obstacles and life lines out there like there is no tomorrow. It allows you to fuck up time and time again. It laughs at your mistakes and applauds you for your winnings. But then, Life has the audacity to give you the ability to REMEMBER these things. It couldn't just let you live day-by-day without recollection of the things you have done in the past. No, life haunts you with memories. Your worst mistakes, your most humiliating moments, all caught on a tape that has no stop or pause button. Even fond memories are often twisted into painful recaps of what you once had but lost. It's just not fair...then again, I guess no one really claimed Life was fair...

I dunno...maybe it is just me...maybe I live in the past at times. I mean, I'm never happy. Not like everyone hasn't already noticed that, right? LOL...yea, big surprise! Anyhow, I have so many thoughts going through my head right now, but for some reason the words just don't really want to come right now. Like, for the first time in a LONG time, I'm homesick...I want so badly to be able to climb into my car and just go drive around Waterbury. I want to call Will and go to the Athenian for dinner. I want to go play pool with Larry and the guys at the Corner Pocket. I want to show up on Fred's doorstep or go over to the Recruiting Station just to hang out. But I can't do any of that...Hell, I can't even TALK to most of those people. And it only makes it worse that I know everyone is gonna be home this week or next for Spring Break. I mean, I'm here working and they are all chilling at home cuz school feels the need to ""give them a small vacation."" WTF?! I don't get vacation unless I put in for it and even then, I only get 30 days a year. Yea, all right, the whole 30 days a year thing is a lot better than any other civilian job would dish out, but I'm 18 for christ's sake. All my friends are HOME!! I realize that I have had so many more opportunities than any of them have and I realize that I have experienced so much more here than I ever would have at home, but that is not really relevant in my mind right now. It's so weird cuz part of me is grateful that I got out of CT while most of them may never experience even half the things I have in 3 months. At the same time though, I miss the buggers.  I don't entirely feel like myself here. I know I always complained of not feeling like I fit in at home, but here it's different. I mean, I fit in, but  I don't act how I did back home so I am afraid that I might be putting on somewhat of a mask, ya know?

Take Fox for example...Me and her can be the best of friends at times, but most of the time we are down each other's throat. Like, she made a comment yesterday that just completely pissed me off. See, Bazal, to be funny, put on my black lipstick and when he came out of the bathroom, she flipped out. She was like ""oh my god, that's so disgusting. Go take that off now."" and I was like, ""what? I thought it looked cool"" Well, her response was ""Ewww, no! I think the Goth look is nasty on guys. Hell, it looks disgusting on girls too"" I was just sittin there with my jaw on the ground, like What the fuck?! She knows damn well that I'm Goth and yet she just sat there and made a comment like that to me. I mean, come on now, how stupid can you be? It's the stupid shit like that and she does it all the time. She blows things out of proportion too, which pisses me off. I swear to god, everyone is out to get her in her mind. I know I can be bad sometimes, but goddamn! I can't handle her! Then, ok, Bazal can be an asshole sometimes, but she gets pissed at him over some really stupid shit. She so needs to lighten up some. Like I said, we can be really good friends most of the time, but there are so many other times that I would really like to choke her.

I just can't act like me around her without getting some kinda shit for it. I just wish that some of my friends were here from time to time so that I could be stupid again and not feel like I'm being thought of as a retard! It doesn't help that I have been feeling incredibly lonely lately too. I mean, yea, sex can be great, but I need more. I need so much more...It's not that I WANT more either, it's that I NEED it. I need to feel loved by someone. I need to feel like someone cares about me for me. I need warm touches that aren't sexual. I need a phone call or a card every now and then just to say hello. I need affection...

All right, Fox just came downstairs to ask me if I wanted to go out somewhere so I need to go now...I'll write more later if I have time..."

"event","Wow...it's been a while...I haven't had time to write on here in what seems like ages! LOL...I would fill ya in on everything that has happened, but I don't think there are enough hours in a day to recap the last 3 months in vivid detail. I'll try my best to summarize it though:

All right, let's start at the beginning...remember that guy I talked about in my last entry? The one that I have known for a while, but I was just now startin to really see him? Yea, well, Mr. Perfect turned out to be Mr. Perfect For Someone Else cuz he sure as hell wasn't for me. I think I mentioned the fact that he had a girlfriend when all the shit with us happened. Well, she came home and suddenly I wasn't needed anymore or something cuz he stopped talking to me, stopped calling me, stopped caring. Hell, I don't even think he cares now and we don't even talk as much anymore. I can't call him cuz when I do he snaps at me for stupid shit and I know he wont call me ever...I'd be surprised if he even remembers I exist most of the time...heh, I think he thought about me more before when we were just friends. I know he cared more back then...

So, ok, while all of that bullshit was goin on, I had a life here in Pensacola goin on. I got down here on 8 JAN (that's funny...I remember the exact date...) Anyways, That day I met what have been some of the coolest people of my life. Fox, who I had gone to AIT with, she got down here a few days before me so she had already met her new quad-mates. One of them was Ray (27, with a girlfriend). The others were Bazal (20, single), Brit (23, with a girlfriend), and Hagstrom (19, single). These 5 people got to see more sides of me in one month than most of my friends back home did in 18 years! My first weekend here I got completely drunk off my ass with Ray, Haggy, and Fox. It was so much fun...I don't drink really, but there are so many stories from that night! LOL...So, ok...about a week later, me and Ray hooked up for the first time. It was a purely lust-type situation. We screwed around, he actually managed to get me off (a first for me!) and that was that. Well, Sage, his girlfriend, came down to visit that weekend too.  That didn't really bother me since, like I said, it was a purely physical thing between me and Ray. Well, another week went by in which I kissed and made out with 2 other ppl and me and Ray hooked up again. The problem starts here...see, me and Ray had a whole week to get to know each other better and well, we kinda had sex that following Saturday. Then we spent the whole day together and the whole situation became more emotional....Ray made it that way. He had started complimenting me and kissing me in front of other people and stuff like that. Well, Sage came down to visit again that weekend so I made myself scarce. And here is where it all goes downhill...February came and everyone came up on orders.  Me and Ray hooked up again, this time, we really got into it and spent the whole night together. On the 31st of January, Brit left, and that same night, I met Gunter (not for the 1st time, but it was the 1st time we talked at all). The following day, another friend left.  That Saturday, like every Saturday, Sage came down to visit. So, I spent the weekend with Fox, and oddly enough, Gunter. That was fun...me and him hit it off and he was so sweet. God, I miss the way he made me feel. Anyways, that weekend was cool too, but unfortunately, Monday came and on 4 FEB, both Ray and Gunter left. Haggy left that Friday and so me and Fox were left by ourselves with just Bazal for company and even then, she had him for company far more than I did.

Well, that covers the first month...it seems now, lookin back on it, that Ray and the guys were here for months and months, but it was really only 4 short weeks. God, those were some of the best days of my life. I know they may not seem like it from what's written above, but hell, you just don't understand how much Ray managed to bring me out of my shell. We all had such a great time and I'm never going to forget that month! So, all right, everyone leaves, but Bazal, right? Well, then we meet Kelley. He works at the clinic with me and Fox, but he was on leave when we first got there. So, me, Fox, Kelley and Bazal become the new ""group.""  The weekend after Ray left, we all went down to Disney, which was hella fun! Nothing happened with anybody, but I slept in a bed with Kelley and Fox and Bazal were together which made for some interesting blackmail pictures! LOL...Anyhow, The next week was fairly uneventful. Then, Matt shows up...Fox's new quad-mate.  He's 23 and has a girlfriend (that I found out about just 3 days ago), but I still ended up hooking up with him and screwin him a few nights after he showed up. Yea, I've become the little slut since I got down here...So, ok, we are at the present now...sorta...I mean, ok, there's last night too...me and a few of my other friends (who shall remain nameless) were all sittin around drinking and well, we kinda had a three-some. Yea, I know...dirty....but, well, I alsways did want to know what it would be like....guess now I know....

Last night was interesting to say the least...but, I honestly wasn't planing on having sex with anyone again for a long time. I mean, after Matt, I decided I was gonna be abstinent. That obviously didn't last long...I mean, yea, ok, I have been having a good time and all, but I have messed around with far too many guys in the last 3 months and I had sex with 3 more people since I left. I mean, I went from 2 experiences with Fred, to 2 more with Ray, one with Matt and another after that with a guy and a girl. That's a bit much...I don't regret anything, but the one with Matt...and I only regret it cuz I hardly knew him (I didn't even know he had a girlfriend) and cuz it wasn't that good anyhow, LOL...I dunno...I can't change the past, but I do wish I could sometimes

All right, I think this may be enough for one entry...I'm not feeling so well all of a sudden and I think I should prob go lay down for a bit...Goodbye for now..."

"event","Wow! I would try and play catch up here, but there is just way too damn much! Ok, my last entry wasn't pleasant and come to think of it, most of the ones before that weren't either...but! Alas! I'm...smiling! Can you believe that? me???? SMILING! And no, there is no gun to my head! LOL...I'm just, well, I'm happy...I mean, Truly happy. I left for Basic as ya know, and before I did me and Fred kinda hooked up. We were dating and everything...then that went south (as expected). So I was miserable. I hated BCT and AIT and I hated the Army. I'm starting to realize that maybe this Army life thing ain't that bad though. After all, I have made some great friends from the whole thing. Look at Rob and Cormier. My two best buds...Anyhow.......

I came home on 14 DEC and things were...well, different. I mean, I didn't fit in with most of my friends. I still don't. I feel out of place. I always have with most of them, but it's worse now. So, I have spent some time down at the Recruiting station. At least I can chill with Cormier right? To be honest, I like hanging out with him. I mean, he's a great friend and upon closer examination of my life, I've realized he's my best friend. He always has been...I just never really noticed it before. It's weird though cuz like he was telling me just yesterday that he found a lump on one of his tonsils and I actually got scared. I mean, I started to worry that I would lose him. How odd is that?! LOL...I dunno, I guess I'm just now realizing just how much I've always relied on him and Rob, ya know? I think he might kinda think of me as his closest friend too. Like, we crack on each other ALL the time, but it's all in fun. And, well, we have so much in common. I finally got him to open up a lil too. He's finally starting to talk about himself more. It's so cool. And me and Rob are talkin a bit more now than before which is just as cool. I think I may have finally found a couple of REAL friends...

Ok, so, yea, on to my other topic! It's REALLY strange, but for the first time in my life, I'm at peace. I mean, like, I have found people in the past that have made me feel pretty good about myself, but this one person that I just met...well, I didn't just meet him. I've known him for quite a few years now, but I'm just now starting to really see him...anyways, this guy, he makes me feel good about myself! I have never had that before! I mean Adam came close, but good god, we had so many problems that it was all cancelled out in the end. So, this guy...I dunno...it's hard to even explain. Like, ok, ya know how my first reaction with any new interest of mine is to think about how much I want to like jump the person? LOL...well, that's not the case this time. All I can think about with him is holding him. I want to hold him in my arms and just never let go. For example, he held my hand today for the first time and I damn near had a heart attack! hehe...I can't explain how I feel about him. All I know is that it's a pleasant change from the normal guys I attract, ya know? Like Fred and Will...they can both be really great guys and at one time I was head-over-heels for both of them, but things have changed. For one thing, I don't trust Fred anymore. I don't think I ever have really, but I'm just now realizing it. Then with Will, I dunno. I keep getting this impression that he doesn't feel like he used to about me. All he really wants me for is either a friend or a booty call. LOL...I love being Will's friend and I even enjoy Fred's friendship, but that's all it is now. I don't want anything more with them. I haven't for a while...it's just taken me a bit to realize that! hehe

God! This is all so overwhelming. I mean, I'm currently in the process of packing my shit up to move to Pensacola for the next 2 years! And now, now of all times, I find someone in CT that's worth sticking around for. But, the really strange part? I'm not worried about it. I mean, I'm sad, yes, but not because I'm leaving him here. I don't understand it! I'm not at all worried that my being gone will effect the two of us. I know that at the very least we will become VERY good friends and keep goin. At best, we may even begin to date from time to time cuz the gods know that I plan on coming home fairly often and I know he would come visit me if he got bored enough! LOL

All right, I need to stop rambling...I'm gonna go now, but I'll try to keep ya posted. Oh and to everyone else out there...Smile! I have found that smiling makes the world seem a lot better, hehe...and who knows, maybe I'll finally stop being so pessimistic now! LOL...byeeeeeeeeeeee!"

Why do I do this to myself? 
Why do I screw myself over? I may have just fucked up any friendship Angel and I had. The problem is I care about her way too much for my own good. I only set myself up for heart break because i'm looking for something that cant happen. I want her to feel about me the way I feel about her and it sucks because I know she wont. Especially after tonight. I've screwed things up because for some stupid reason I have to be a teacher and not just a friend who listens to people. I always open my damn mouth. i'm fairly close to tears listenin' to Def Leppard here because I look back on this summer especially. And i realize that I'm a screw up. My parents, my financial situation, my magic...everything. I probably should have just looked at Angel when she walked into my store that first time and said to myself ""Don't do it, she's out of your league"" taken her money and let her walk out of my life forever. But like an ass, I kept trying. And I realize now I was right then. I should've just stopped at ""Hi"". i'm so damn stupid. One day down the line, I hope I grow out of it... one day...

You didn't do anything 

I'm in a pissy mood. I get this way. It's part of who I am. When I get this way, I want to listen to know one. I bitch a lot. I complain. And I refuse to listen. You didn't fuck things up. Granted, you learned a lil more about me tonight. You learned that when I'm pissy, it's best to just shut up and nod cuz I have a tendency to to start taking shit out on the people who are trying to help. It's not my best side. I'm sorry I took it out on you. I'm sorry my bad night turned out to be upsetting for you as well. I have a real knack for getting the people around me upset when I am. I got Liz upset tonight too...but that's a whole 'nother story. You're not a fuck up. No matter what you say. You try to help, it's your nature. Unfortunately, I'm stubborn and don't usually want help. It causes inevitable conflict. I'm not sorry that we met. Even if you are, I'm not. You have been there for me and you have made me smile when it seemed otherwise impossible. So, basically, thank you. I know it don't seem like much right now, but thank you for being there for me and for not listening to the nagging voice inside that said don't do it. Ok, I'm gonna try to go to sleep again...prob to no avail, but I need to try. Keep smiling hun...one of us has too...

"event","The other day I went to a dermatologist to get rid of this one pimple, and I find myself recieving a 15 minute long lecture trying to persuade me to begin a ridiculous skin care regime, as if taking care of ones skin is like fucking boot camp.  Then the women tells me I won't be sucessful or make any money when I grow up if I don't start spending massive sums of money on skin (cosmetic) products.  What? Its crazy.  It was like being forced to listen to a door to door salesman for an hour about his new stupid product.  And I know that what they offer often helps, but it all seems so crazy to me."

"event","I just found out that the lead singer of the Libertines (an amazing band) was dropped from the band because of his severe heroin and crack addiction. They say once he cleans up they will allow him back into the band.  I just hope he manages to clean up and continue to write on the same level.  If you haven't heard The Libertines, seriously check them out.  They rock.
Other than this news, nothing much is going on.  I miss my friends and I don't know why I haven't seen them for so long.  I need some kind of escape.

The Curiosa Festival is going to be amazing."

"event","The other day, Friday, my mind just seemed to be wandering all over the place.  I remember I woke up and started practicing guitar for my lesson and just suddenly blanked for a second, then I started practicing again and the string i was bending just snapped.  So I just packed up my stuff, walked to Woodsy's, and then during my lesson, when Drew and I were playing, I kept momentarily zoning out, and then coming back.  It was so weird.  Then I was just indifferent and detached the rest of the day.  
   On Saturday I saw Fahrenheit 9/11.  It was really disturbing, like most of Michael Moore's books and films. Yet, this movie was really really chilling when you think about it.  And now I'm listening to this amazing British band called Elbow. You should definitely check them out."

"event","Fucking Christ.  My dumbass sister and mom who is now all of a sudden a gay pride activist have put a up a huge gay pride flag on the front of my house.  I mean, I am all for gay equality and gay pride, you know, but fuck man! This is gonna give even more shit to deal with that I don't fucking need! Why is my sister so desperate to be an activist and why does she want to be a lesbian so bad?  Put a gay pride flag on something that is entirely yours, not on something that makes me share the consequences (whether they are unjust or not).  God!  And then my mom steals $70 from me.  She's such a bad person, i mean, i sold all of my old lacrosse gear and when i sold it the people write you a check. And I asked her who to make the check out to, and she says to her so she can cash it for me.  Then she tells me that shes keeping the money, and that i can't do anything about it because the checks made out to her.  What a bitch! God, i can't wait for my property to be vandalized now and be out $70.  Life fucking sucks."

"event","Man, i hate it when i know i just made a really tasteless and bad joke right after i say it.  Its like sometimes my mind stops but my mouth keeps going.  Then if the joke is really bad and hurts a persons feelings, thats just gotta suck for them and I feel awful.  Yeah, and I do that all the time. So I'm sorry for all of you countless people I have rudely hurt with bad humor.  I'm so sorry."

"event","This past couple weeks has been so weird for me.  I've felt so detached, and ant-social.  I find myself sitting on my couch playing guitar and I realize that thats all I have done in over two weeks.  Also, have you ever complimented someone and then realized how stupid and cheesy that compliment sounds.  Yep, i definitley get that feeling all the time.  Life can just be so strange sometimes."

"event","Man, i think i've been really anti-social this past week.  i haven't really hung out with anyone and i haven't really called any of my buddies.  I think its because of really stupid reasons, like a single zit that i had that was annoying the hell out of me and because i desperately needed a haircut.  In retrospect those have got to be the dumbest reasons in the world but i really don't have to worry about it because my haircuts tomorrow (i'm getting it cut like this old pic of Nick Valensi of The Strokes that i got offline).  I also bought this amazing hat yesterday and a pair of huge sunglasses that i'm not so sure i like. Oh well, i really feel bad for not calling some people, and if you are one of those people and you're reading this, i am very sorry and chances are that i love you to death and we'll be having good times in no time at all."

The Stills, Changes are no good

Man, right now, my family is just annoying the hell out of me.  And I just can't stand feeling like i belong.  Its so weird, I mean, if you have a bunch of friends in a certain group, yet you still feel like you're new at school or just being introduced.  This feeling comes with exceptions, of course, but the feeling overall is just surreal. I feel like I'm still just arriving even though I've been here my whole life."

"event","I saw Sea Ray at the Grog Shop yesterday and they blew my mind.  It was kind of like Mogwai, and when they played they had these short films with amazing colors projected onto the stage.  And Metric rocked out too.  The lead singer is so hot and she let everyone dance on stage with her.  Gosh, I love it.  But now today, I feel a little sad because this amazing girl that I like doesn't feel the same about me. Oh well, thats life I guess, but its still disappointing.  But hey, I've got some amazing friends, like Zach and Andy and this kid I just got to know named Andrew, and if shit doesn't always work out with girls, thats cool."

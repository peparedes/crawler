"event","so its the first day of a new month and therefore the first day of a new plan.  i think i have already posted my plan but i'll post it again, because i really do love it.  i just hope it works!

monday: 600 cals max/2 hours at the gym
tuesday: 600 cals max/2 hours at the gym
wednesday: 600 cals max/2 hours at the gym
thursday: 600 cals max/2 hours at the gym
friday: crepe and smoothie on the way to work plus 600 cals max/2 hours at the gym
saturday: 600 cals max/no gym (unless i feel like it)
sunday: eat whatever i want (within reason)/walk the dogs a few miles with rob.

i hope to stay on this plan for a long time, or at least until i stop losing.  i'm not going to weigh myself again until i get my new scale for christmas.  here are a few things i'm getting for christmas (i hope) that should help with my weight loss.

these are just a few of the things i put on my list for my parents.  i'm most excited about the first two though.  

anyway today i went and signed up for the gym.  i didn't last two hours but thats okay because its only my first day back.  i lasted 20 minutes on the cross trainer and then walked 2 miles on an incline.  i was there about an hour including filling out the paperwork.  i might go back tomorrow after work depending on how i feel.  rob is going out to dinner so it will be the perfect time.  i'm not sure what their hours are on saturdays though and i'll probably be tired and hungry after work because all i will have had all day will be a slim fast shake or bar.  

i just really want to start losing but with less obsessing.  i want to be 120lbs at the most by the time i weigh myself again which means i need to lose about 15lbs.  i really hope i can do it."

"event","okay so here is the new plan, for now until forever...or at least until it stops working.  600 calories a day.  except on fridays and sundays.  on fridays i can get a crepe and a smoothie before work in addition to my 600 calories.  on sundays i can eat without counting but at least try to be healthy.  gym everyday except saturdays and sundays.  i am joining the gym again on friday.  every morning i will do 20 minutes on a bike, 20 minutes on an elliptical, 20 minutes on a gazell like machine (lateral trainer?), and then attempt 5k on the treadmill.  during robs christmas break he'll use a free pass and teach me how to use the weight machines and i'll start doing strength 2-3 times a week.  christmas is on a monday but i am taking the day off from both the gym and dieting.  

in addition to all this i will take as many diet, green tea, hoodia, and vitamin pills as i can every day.  i will also be switching to a lower dose of birth control pill and possibly stop taking it all together and use condoms instead.  

i am so serious right now.  i can't stand being so fat anymore.  its a constant humiliation and i hate leaving my house.  i have huge holes in the only pair of jeans that fits me right now (ae size 6s boyfriend stretch jeans) so i went and bought a new pair last night.  didn't bother to try them on because it was the same size i was wearing.  went to put them on today and of course they are too fucking small.  i am so disgusting i want to puke when i look at myself in the mirror.  i walked around campus today looking at every girl and saying in my mind ""i wish i had her bmi, i wish i looked like that.""  

i hate myself so much.  i can't take much more."

"event","so today i weighed in at 135lbs.  again.  its so fucking frustrating.  lose 1 gain 2.  back and forth, up and down and i am just so sick of it.  sometime after thanksgiving i'm going to go to the doctor to have my thyroid looked at.  it just doesn't seem possible for me to lose weight no matter what.

so today i started a fast.  i want to fast for 100 hours followed by 50 hours of eating raw foods only.  right now i am on hour 4 which leaves me with 96 more hours.  woo!  my fast lasts until saturday night at 6:00pm at which point i can start eating raw foods.  i will then eat raw foods only until monday at 8:00pm.  i'm hoping to lose 10lbs though i know it will be mostly water weight.  at least 4lbs should be actual fat gone.  once the whole fast is over i'm not sure what i will do because it ends monday night and wednesday i leave for florida so i don't have time for 2468 or anything.  i'll probably just try to stick to raw until florida and then eat as little as humanly possible while there.  maybe start 2468 when i get home and keep at it until christmas with another 100 hour fast or two thrown in there depending on how well this one goes.

i made myself charts with the numbers 1-100 and 1-50 so i can cross off each hour as i complete it.  it makes me feel accomplished and like this won't be so hard.  if i think of it in groups of 10 hours it doesn't seem so hard.  its only 10, 10 hour fasts...they just happen to be in a row.  i will probably allow myself some juice or diet hot chocolate at times when i feel dizzy.  i'm really not too worried about liquids.

43 more minutes until i can cross off hour #4 yet i'm hungry already.  the thing is i know i'm not really physically hungry, just mentally hungry.  i hate myself."

"event","i have not been doing well.  back up to 134.5 this morning but i think its water/food weight inside me.  the plan is to eat 500-600 calories every day until thanksgiving, except this saturday because we'll be having dinner at rob's moms house.  i'm also doing the walk away the pounds routine from the book and hoping it will help.  doing crunches on and off but i know they won't really matter because i'm too fat for definition in my stomach.  i really wanted to be 115 for thanksgiving but now i'll be lucky to be 125.  this sucks.  i'll never be 100lbs for chrismtas.  oh well, i will do my best to get as close to that goal as possible.  maybe i can make it by new years.  

today i have had a starbucks bar (130) and a small slush which i have no idea how many calories were in that.  i'm planning to have an apple at 2pm (50) and popcorn (100) after i take my clients grocery shopping.  for dinner i would love to have soup (200) but will probably have to have mashed potatoes instead.  i'll try to only eat about a cups worth but we'll see.  tomorrow should be easier.  i wish i didn't love food like i do.  it would make this so much easier.  its so fucking hard to lose weight.

i want to be on the biggest loser but i'm pretty sure i'm not fat enough."

"event","so yesterday went very well.  i felt sick and had a sore throat all day so food really wasn't appealing to me.  i ate:
hot chocolate (25)
pria bar (110)
soup (200)
popcicle (80)

total: 415

and this morning when i weighed myself i was down to 132.5!  another pound down and i am LOVING 2468.  last night i was supposed to go out to dinner with robs family for his dads birthday but i looked at the menu and knew i would over eat so i said i felt too sick to go (and i really did feel sick) so i got to stay home in bed and watch tv and eat low cal soup.  and the night before, on my 200 cal day my dads girlfriend brought over tons of chinese food to celebrate finally being done with her thesis and i didn't even take one bite!  

last night i couldn't really sleep because my throat hurt so bad and so at 8am, the minute the doctors office opened i called and made an appointment for 10am.  turns out i have tonsillitis as usual and the doctor gave me prednisone and vicoden.  i decided to come to work anyway because i called in sick two days last week and there is so much work to do for licensing that i was too scared to call in.  so i filled my perscriptions and bought a crepe and a smoothie and came to work.  not sure how many cals in that crepe and smoothie but i bet a lot so if i eat at all later today it will be another 200 cal soup.  good thing i can have 600 cals today.  oh yeah, and last night i really wanted a milkshake to make my throat feel better so i picked up my cell phone to call rob to bring me one, but then i thought of the calories and decided to have the popcicle instead.  i am just brimming over with willpower these past few days.

so now i am at work (luckily i am pretty much alone on fridays) and i am really fucked up from this vicoden due to eating so little the past few days and i set up the space heater right next to me so i'm all warm and loopy and just loving reading livejournal entries and the vc andrews book i got when picking up my meds."

"event","happy day today.  i stuck to my 200 cals yesterday (well actually about 210) and today when i woke up i said to myself, if i weigh 135 today i can stay in bed and don't have to go walking, but if i weigh 135.5 or 136 (like i did yesterday) then i have to go.  so i got naked and stepped on that scale and it read 133.5!!!  i was so estatic that i decided to go for my walk anyway.  i know its almost all water weight but i don't care.  i'm hoping to lose 4-5lbs per round of 2468.  if i even come close to that i'll be down to 115 by thanksgiving like i want.  then it should take a bit longer to lose those last 15lbs by christmas but i think i can pull it off.  

i am just so happy and motivated today.  i do feel a little sick with a sore throat and haven't felt like eating.  i had planned for today:
b: hot chocolate (25)
s: apple (50)
l: pria bar (110)
s: hot chocolate (25)
d: pria bar (110)
s: fruit bar (80)

but so far all i had was that hot chocolate for breakfast.  i will probably end up having 75 cals left over tonight because i don't think i'll want the apple or the 2nd hot chocolate.  but if my throat still hurts i might use those cals for a cup a soup or something."

b - 3 frosted mini wheats (24)
l - apple (50)

d - salad (98)

total - 197

if i start to get hungry at work i'm going to take a phertermine which might mean i won't eat for the rest of the day, so its possible i'll end up with about 100 cals for the day but we'll see.  i hate taking those pills though because they are like speed and after a few hours a ""come down"" and i HATE that coming down feeling with a passion.  i get so depressed and rob always gets worried.  i'll try my hardest to keep it under control."

i know that if i can stick to this and get through just one round, four days, i will lose weight.  probably up to 5lbs.  once i finish round one i might do 4 days of the cereal diet (cereal for breakfast and lunch, and a lean cuisine for dinner) or i might do another round of 2468.  we'll see how i feel.  so far i feel good.  and i'm ready to be skinny."

"event","today i went to weigh in for the start of my companys next weight loss challenge.  when i got there the woman in charge of it was like ""why are you trying to lose weight?""  meaning that i am already thin.  although i must disagree with her wholeheartedly, it does make me feel really really good to hear comments like that.

sadly, with all my clothes, jeans, hoodie, etc, i weighed in at 140.4lbs.  that makes me incredibly sad.  luckily i plan to weigh 100lbs at the final weigh in, thus losing 28% of my body weight and i will win this challenge hands down, and the $800 that comes with it.

the team who won the first challenge only lost like 6% of their body weight so i have this no problem.  now i just need to start losing.

ps. i quit the 28 day plan."

so yeah i'm psycho.  on my way home from work i couldn't keep myself from the grocery store where i proceeded to buy binge foods and go so crazy waiting to eat them in my car that i unknowingly left my $300 coach purse with my pink razor cell phone and my wallet containing my drivers license, my credits cards, and my atm card in the GROCERY CART in the PARKING LOT!!!  i didn't even realize it was missing until my way into work today and i FLIPPED.  i wasn't sure i had left it at shaws, i thought it might have been stolen.  i checked all my accounts online and no charges were made and i called my cell phone company and no outgoing calls had been made so i kept searching my car and had rob and my dad search the house.  i called shaws, the brighton police, and the arlington police.  finally someone from shaws called and said they had it and everything was there but my cell phone.  luckily they didn't realize how much the bag itself is worth!  anyway this is why i hate food, look at what it did to me!  

no i don't have anyones phone number which sucks, but i would rather have the coach bag (which is a few years old and not replacable) than my cell phone which i can relatively easily replace for half the cost of the purse itself.  

despite binging on 2.5 krispy kreme doughnuts and fat free pringles i still ended up down a pound from yesterday at 135.5."

yup i finally faced the scale this morning and weighed in at a sickening 136.5lbs.  the most i have ever weighed in my life and the most i hope to EVER weigh! except when i am pregnant, maybe.

so today is the first day of what i like to call my negative 150 diet.  its going okay so far.  here is the plan for today:
food:
b: hot chocolate (76)
l: apple slices (142) with caramel (140)
s: pocky (210), popcorn (100), rice cakes (30)
d: hot chocolate (76)
total: 775

exercise:
morning walk: 522 cals burned
16 minutes of jumping jacks: 134.4 cals burned
evening walk: 270 cals burned
total: 926.4

total deficit for the day = 151.4"

"event","okay this is important.  if i want to be at 115lbs for florida during thanksgiving here is what i need to do:

eat 800 calories or less EVERY DAY!!
burn 950 calories or more EVERY DAY from exercise!!

i am assuming that my body will naturally burn 1500 calories a day.  this means that i need a deficit of 150 calories a day.  if i fast, i only need to work off 150 calories.  if i eat 400 calories i only need to burn off 550 and so on.  no more fucking up, i need to do this EVERY DAY until november 23rd when i leave, and if i do, there is NO REASON for me to weigh any more than 115lbs.  

i can do this, and i WILL do this.  after thanksgiving, if i feel like being a fat pig and eating whatever i want and not working out, thats my choice, but until then i will end each and every day with -150 calories!!"

not good, not good.  i tried to do the ballet video but apparently i'm not nearly flexible enough.  i couldn't do the foot positions because my feet do NOT turn out all the way like they apparently need to.  i am thinking of trying yoga to gain flexibility and then try ballet again in a few months.  

decided on a plan for next week, tuesday-friday fast and then go back on the fat blaster diet because its the only thing that has helped me lose.  i'll hopefully stay on that diet the rest of the plan!  i need to lose 3lbs a week to make my goal and the fat blaster diet says you can lose up to 50lbs in 100 days."

ate pizza yesterday and again today.  not good but today if i just have hot chocolate for dinner (tell rob and dad i ate at work) then i will still get a 2/2 for food.  also i'm hoping to do my ballet dvd i got from netflix tonight and then walk the dogs or do my night jog and get 2/2 for exercise today as well.  i'm already done with water and my challenge so today could just be what i need to get my score back up.

tomorrow is friday so i'm definately having a crepe and a smoothie for breakfast and then i'm going camping for the long weekend but i would really like to try a fast from tuesday-friday.  also camping means i won't be posting here saturday or sunday but i'm going to give myself the posting points anyway when i post again on monday when i get back, as long as i actually keep track of my points while i'm gone."

so yeah, i did really, REALLY badly.  i don't know whats wrong with me.  if i hadn't eaten that stupid pretzel, popsicle, and chocolate i would have been FINE.  i just wasn't thinking and thats my problem.  i need to try harder to eat MINDFULLY!  i also didn't exercise.  i slept in, barely walked around campus, and napped instead of going for my night jog with the dogs.  barely drank any water either.  

the good news is i am on for a 10/10 day today!!!  i hope i make it!"

me and rob were at the mall all day walking so i got over 2 hours of walking in there plus i jogged about a mile later, sparkpeople says i burned about 480cals from exercise.  we got fun stuff at the mall including the coach wallet i can start using once i get to 115lbs.  thats 20lbs and forever away but it will be sweet when i get there.  we also got a lot of toys at sharper image.  today rob got my ipod fixed and i bought the shoes to hook up to it and i can't wait to get started."

i wish that 64% would mean i would have lost 6lbs out of the 10 i wanted to lose but sadly although i was able to lose two pounds, i gained both of them back.  i suck.  new challenge begins today though.

i am doing 800 non fruit and veggie cals max per day plus as many fruits and veggies as i want as long as they are fresh.  any frozen or canned, or basically any fruits or veggies with any added ingredients get rated with full calorie content.  i'm using spark peple to track my progress and i really hope to actually make some this time around.  

doubt i'll get my exercise points today though because its raining, but i'll do my best to start this challenge off right and i'll put on my rain boots and rain coat if i have to!"

i ate relateively badly yesterday: large smoothie, crepe with nutella, grilled cheese, doritos, 4 sour patch kids, hot chocolate, spaghetti squash with meat sauce.  but i gave myself 1 point for putting in all the effort to make and eat the spaghetti squash instead of having real pasta.  plus i made rob and my dad try it and they both liked it!  i should have jogged laps with rob when we walked the dogs but we had eaten so late we both felt too full and thought we would puke if we tried.  

i also put in an application for consumer credit counseling and they are going to help me.  thank god!  they are getting my interest rate with american express lowered from 30.2% to 9% which is AMAZING!  they told me not to consolidate my citi bank card because i have 0% apr with them now and if i consolidated it would go up to about 9%.  basically i will be paying ccc around $250/month instead of paying all my credit cards individually, plus my interest will be MUCH lower so everything will get paid off sooner.  that will make my monthly payments look like this:
$200/month - car payment
$250/month - car insurance
$300/month - rent
$250/month - ccc payments

that leaves me with about $700 a month for everything else including my cell phone, food, clothes, perscriptions, magazines, diet pills, gym membership, and gas for my car.  then once i graduate (in december) i'll get to add another $100/month for the next FIFTEEN YEARS to pay off my $11,000 in student loans.  

i would be able to deal with this except that CHRISTMAS is coming up and how on earth am i going to be able to afford to buy people preasants??  plus my brothers bday is nov. 5 and my dads is nov. 23.  god i hate money.

so anyway today is the last day of my 28 day plan.  food for today included:
-2 slices of light wheat toast w/peanutbutter
-2 peanut butter sandwhichs on light wheat bread
-2 tiny cups of diced peaches
-3 ferrero rocher chocolates
-1 bag of smart food popcorn
+ whatever i have for dinner (hopefully my stir ""fry"")

thats about 1000 calories so far and hopefully less than 400 for dinner.  i'm being lax because hard core diet starts tomorrow.  not sure exactly what my plan is yet but i'll know by the end of the night and be ready for tomorrow."

so i had to step on the scale which i have been avoiding all week and yes, very sadly i am back up to 135, exactly what i was when i started the plan.  i am the biggest failure ever.  i couldn't even lose 1lb and keep it off in 28 days.  that is so pathetic.

i am mad at myself for having so little control over my life.  not only am i unable to lose weight but i am unable to lose debt as well.  i am so financially fucked right now.  i owe over $8,000 in credit card debt and $11,000 in student loans.  then there is another $5000+ that i still owe on my car, along with about $3,000 on my car insurance policy for the year.  i only make $30,000 a year BEFORE taxes and end up with about $400/week in actual cash.  i am so FUCKED.  i spent the day trying to get my credit card debt consolidated with no success because my credit score is bad.  my boyfriend wants me to ask my dad to co-sign but he doesn't understand my dad.  my dad doesn't believe in debt.  he has never ever been in debt.  he owns our house and his car.  he pays off his credit cards in full every month and every bill on time.  if he found out how badly i am in debt he might disown me.  

i am so depressed that i don't even feel like eating which i guess is a good thing.  i hate worrying about money so much and i hate being fat even more.  a new weight loss challenge at work started today and ends december 29 and the winner gets like $800.  if i make it to 100lbs by xmas and keep it off till i weigh in that would be losing 26% of my body weight and i seriously think i could win.  that is major motivation.  my other motivation currently is that i need to be bikini ready by november 22.  also there is the fact that i barely fit into my clothes anymore and obviously can't afford to buy any fat clothes with my money situation as it is.  

life sucks."

so i thought my food and water intake would be much better but rob called me at work and said his boss gave him red sox tickets for that night and could i go.  so i called my boss and he said i could leave early to go and of course what is a red sox game at fenway park without:
-one philly cheese steak (350 cals)
-half an order of fries (200 cals)
-cotton candy (80 cals)
-chocolate ice cream cone (300 cals)

uggghhhhhhhh i suck!!  it was really funny because i commented to rob that the whole thing of cotton candy was only 100 calories and that sort of ruined it for me and he was like ""its like you don't care how the food tastes, you just want it to be high in calories so you can be bad.""  and it was so true!  i wanted to just eat everything there!  i estimate my total calories of the day to be at a little over 1,000 because besides what i ate at the game i had a fruit salad for lunch.  the numbers are so high but unfortunately most of the calories from the game come from fat.  

tomorrow is my work challenge weigh in and i know if anything i will probably show a gain.  this morning i ate a stupid donut again, ugh (300?) and a bowl of frosted flakes (250ish).  thats all i plan to have today except a fat free hot chocolate for dinner (70).  i am strongly considering taking a laxative tonight just to get everything out of my system before the weigh in tomorrow morning.  i know it will work because i NEVER take laxatives.  i know it won't be real weight lost and i don't care, its just so i don't look like an idiot when i weigh in in front of other people tomorrow morning.  

also i got permission from my boss to go to florida for thanksgiving so i will be off work weds 11/23 - mon 11/27.  thats like the longest i have ever taken off and then best part is i only need to use 3 vacation days.  its also wicked motivation to lose the weight because i will be wearing a bathing suit a lot and don't want to look disgusting in front of rob and his brothers!"

i don't want to talk about it but i feel like i have to be honest here.  my fast was killed by dinner pressure.  i suck.  

here are the things i consumed:
-fat free hot chocolate
-1/2 baked chicken breast (no skin)
-1 cup rice pilaf
-2 cups steamed green beans
-3 slices bread with butter
-4 squares of chocolate
-2 doughnuts

estimated calories: 1500 for the day (and todays breakfast)
estimated fat grams: 35
estimated fiber: 12

its TERRIBLE i know.  after eating donuts for breakfast i walked only about 2-3 miles and did only 3 sets of arm curls/lifts.  i had slush and fruit salad for lunch.  hoping not to eat again today or tomorrow.  friday my dad is cooking dinner again so i'm fucked.  he said he is making spaghetti sauce so i'm hoping to buy spaghetti squash to eat with it instead of real pasta to lower the calories and carbs.  weigh in on friday at work will be humiliating.  

i want to apologize to anyone i let down.  including myself.  i'm sorry i suck so much and have no will power."

"event","its only hour sixteen and i feel TERRIBLE!  i am FREEZING cold and i have a terrible headache.  i'm at work so i can't get warm snuggling up to rob or my puppies in bed or wrap myself in more clothes and blankets.  i tried doing jumping jacks to warm me up but they made my headache so much worse.  i took 2 tylenol around 4pm but they have don't nothing.  i'm about to take 2 more with my 3rd cup of water.  

despite how awful i feel i will not give in.  i know this is just my body eating itself and that hurts, but its worth it.  in just a little over one hour i can leave work, pick up elisa, and make myself a nice warm mug of hot chocolate and then wrap me and rob up in a quilt and settle down to watch a movie or something.  maybe i can even sneak half of one of robs percacets.  

when i weigh myself tomorrow morning and see a lower number on the scale, i will know this was all worth it and i can make it."

"event","oh man i am so hungry right now.  not really physically hungry but more mentally hungry.  i want a chocolate ice cream cone covered in chocolate jimmies.  oh man i want it so badly!  thank god i did not bring my wallet or any money at all with me to work today.  also on saturday (the last time i was here) i got rid of all the food i had in the office so i wouldn't be tempted by it.  

this morning after i told my dad i didn't want a steak he asked me if i would eat chicken instead.  i told him i really didn't want to eat dinner that late and hopefully he won't keep trying to force food on me.  i called elisa and offered her the other steak and she is thrilled because she has been living on a food budget of $15 a week lately.  i told her i didn't want it because i wanted to eat an early dinner.  hopefully i will pull this off, resist all that they are eating and sip contentedly at my hot chocolate.  i might take one tiny bite of steak if they say its really good and that i just HAVE to try it.  other than that, NOTHING!!  

at our team meeting at work today we interviewed a potential apd (the position directly above me) and i didn't like him.  i told duncan (pd, who is above apd) how i felt and i'm pretty sure if he gets hired at all, it will be to the same position i hold (cw).  i was offered the apd position but i didn't want it because its WAY more work for only about $3000 more.  no thanks!  

well my tummy is rumbling and i'm drinking all the water i can.  before work gets out i hope to finish up my 6 sets of jumping jacks, ab move, and waist move (i already did one set), drink 5 more cups of water, and write my lap report for class.  i will be here for two more hours so lets see what happens."

so today is the first day of my fast.  so far so good!  its hour 10 (its been longer but i officially started at midnight).  wow, my dad just called up to me ""hey liz, i'm marinating three steak teryakis right now, do you and rob want to eat dinner here tonight?""  man i do want to but i told him that i'm eating earlier but that rob and elisa will eat them.  its going to be soooooo hard not to even try a bite!  its so hard living at home!  anyway this morning i got up and went and did my six cross country miles with foxy and she was so well behaved, i was so proud of her.  also during each lap i did some arm curls with my water bottle which was about 2lbs.  at work i'm going to do 6 sets of jumping jacks, 6 sets of my ab move, and 6 sets of the waist trimming exercise.  

so today is going to be difficult with the family dinner and all but i will try my hardest to resist.  i might HAVE to take one tiny bite of the steak to appease my dad, but i won't let that ruin my fast.  its just one bite.  also i decided to have a kashi go lean protien shake for breakfast every day instead of hot chocolate because i might need it after working out so hard this morning and all day.  i don't think it will hinder my loss at all.  

wish me luck today!"

so tomorrow the fast and exercise begin.  ideally i want to fast for fourteen days.  realistically i will probably last until friday morning after weigh in.  if i weigh in at 125lbs i will allow myself a crepe and a smoothie and go back to fasting.  every day i hope to walk 6 miles before work on the cross country train.  i also want to do some ab exercises that i saw in a magazine claiming to be ""better than lipo.""  if i have any energy i'll try to do 280 jumping jax during my time at work.  thats 10 sets of 28.  i will have fat free hot chocolate made with water for breakfast and dinner every day.  if i get dizzy or shakey i will have a little nantucket nectars apple juice.  i will make it this time.  i want to be 115lbs for thanksgiving because i might be going to florida with robs family for a few days and i'll have to wear a bathing suit.  this plan ends the 30th of september and i need to be at 125lbs by then.  if i can fast for fourteen days i know i can do anything.  i just need to make it through the first 3 days which everyone says are the hardest.  wish me luck everyone.

so i figured out what hoodia can do for me.  i took it all day yesterday, every 4 hours or so, and when i went home after work for my dads dinner i was starving.  i served myself on a small plate, instead of the normal ones rob and my dad used and told myself i could only eat one plateful and i was supposed to eat as slow as possible.  sadly i ate too fast and then had a second serving of mashed potatoes.  BUT, once i finished eating i was so uncomfortably full!  i felt sick for HOURS after i ate like the food was going to cause my stomach to explode and despite the extra potatoes it was less than i would normally eat.  so the plan is to to hoodia 1-2 hours before i am meant to have a meal.  then 30 minutes before the meal have an apple or some veggies, something small.  hopefully that will fill me up so much that i won't be able to have the meal!  

here is what i ate today:
b: banana nut muffin
s: 5 saltines
l: 100-150 cals of veggie soup and some bread
s: apple slices, galaxy bar, 5 saltines

now i am feeling overly full once again as i ate too much.  i wish the pills would keep me from eating instead of making me so full for so long AFTER i already ate!

so i have a few days (today, tomorrow, and monday) to eat a few last minute cravings and then my fast starts monday night, not sure what time yet.  the fast has to go until at least friday morning (weigh in at work) but i heard it gets much easier after the 3rd day so maybe i'll be able to keep it up for longer.  i would LOVE to make 14 days but thats just not likely for me.

also my 28th day is september 30th which gives me a perfect october 1st as the start day of my next cycle!  i want to weight 115lbs for halloween so i really need to step it up!"

i suck.  fucked up my fast.  the weekend would have been impossible anyway.  instead i'm hoping to fast tue-fri at least because i have my final weigh in on friday for a work weight loss challenge and i am my group leader and will feel so stupid if i haven't lost anything.  if i can make it beyond friday awesome, if not, i'll live.  todays menu:

so i decided to fast my way down to 130lbs at least.  preferable to 128 or so to get back on track because i had wanted to lose 2.5lbs a week.  so by day 21 i should have been at 127.5lbs.  i know that won't happen but i will fast until i get to 128lbs and then go to a metab booster someone posted in another community for a day or two and then move on to my variation of the 2468.  it may just be possible to lose 8lbs in 9 days or so.  some (or most) of it will be water weight but i can handle that.  i just want to start off my next cycle at 125, is that so much to ask?!

so its hour 12 of my fast and i'm going strong.  i figure if i get dizzy or shakey i will drink a little apple juice.  i'm taking a hoodia pill every 4 hours or so and if i want a can have a multivitamin and calcium chocolate chew every day.  then starting tomorrow i'm going to allow myself a light hot chocolate for breakfast and before bed to get my metabolism up in the morning and then help me fall asleep at night.  

i really hope this works!"

okay here is my plan, starting tomorrow, in hopes of stepping up the weight loss this week!  i NEED to be at 130lbs by day 22.

monday: 800cals
tuesday: fast
wednesday: 200cals
thursday: 400cals
friday: 600cals   
saturday: 1000cals
sunday: 1200cals

every day i want to walk 6+ miles on the cross country track, switching off which dog i bring every day because if i want a good work out i can only bring one dog at a time.  everything else will stay the same.  hopefully my leg will be feeling better by tomorrow so i can get back to my exercise."

i can't believe i didn't lose any more weight.  this means its time to resort to more intense measures and some fasting and starvation and extreme restriction.  i'm wearing my fat jeans out of the dryer and can barely button them.  i'm feeling so fat and unhappy.  i'll never lose weight if i don't step it up more.  sadly i have a wicked cramped muscle in my left leg and can barely walk so there will be more starving than exercise but i have to do what i have to do."

i was hoping for 10/10 but i had to work at a group home during work yesterday and the bathrooms there are so disgusting that i was afraid to drink any water in fear of having to use one.  oh well, i think i made the right decision.  today i don't think i'll get my exercise points in because i had to work 9-5 today instead of my usual 12-8 and by the time i fight my way home through rush hour it will probably be dark out and i cant afford to buy my gym membership until next month."

this morning i decided to go for a walk on this cross country track in my town that is about a mile around.  i did six laps and it was really difficult but i found a way to keep myself going.  i kept telling myself that i was walking towards my skinny self.  i told myself that the skinny, 100lb version of me is far away, maybe even more than 1,000 miles away, but i have to keep walking, whether its at the park, on the treadmill, on the elliptical, or whatever i need to keep going until i get there.  picturing myself at 100lbs at the end of the walk really helped.  today is totally going to be a 10/10 day!"

i'm so mad at myself.  why can't i just go to the gym in the morning??  every day i chose to sleep and lie around and do nothing instead of going off to burn calories.  i SUCK!!  tonight i'm going to tell rob that from now on i have to be in my car on my way to the gym every morning when he leaves for work.  its what worked for me in the past and it will work again.  i'm so mad at myself right now.  seriously when i go to the gym in the morning it motivates me to do well the rest of the day.  i drink my water, i don't eat bad foods.  ugh dieting is so fucking frustrating sometimes.  but i guess if it was easy, everyone would be thin.  

i can do this and i WILL do this."

so yesterday wasn't so hot but i'm aiming for 10/10 today.  i should be at the gym now but me and rob were fighting last night so i'm tired now and i will just go after work.  strawberries for breakfast and snack, salad and apple slices for lunch, yogurt and apple slices for late snack, rice for dinner (the other half of what i made last night).  would love to see 125.5 tomorrow morning!  tomorrow is my last day on this diet, then i'm going on to my 2468101214 which i'm hoping will be a major metabolism boost, but if i gain 2lbs and keep them for more than 2 days, then i'm back to this diet until i lose the pounds and then for 2 extra days like the book says."

so it was my worst day on plan so far.  today wasn't so hot either as i planned to get a roasted red pepper soup from abp at around 80cals but was so devestated when i went to get it after class and they were out that i went to d'angelos and had a small steak and cheese at 460 cals!  i'm not counting today as a total loss though because all i ate before that was some apple slices (no caramel) and all i'm having for dinner is some rice (half my normal serving).  so it should all even out.  i will not be too devestated or suprised to see a gain tomorrow though."

so this morning when i got up i told my boyfriend that i was going to weigh myself, and if i hadn't lost anything i was quitting the diet and we could go out to dinner.  well i weighed in and saw a solid 133 on the scale and while i was sad that i wouldn't be going out to dinner, i was thrilled to be losing again.  so i'm back on track until wednesday when its suppossed to end.  rob is taking me to legal seafood for dinner than night and i'm going to buy special shoes to hook up to my ipod so i can track all my steps and calories burned and stuff, its really cool.  anyway having tofu tacos for dinner tonight.  its hard to stay on my eating schedule during the weekend so i had like a 2pm breakfast/snack of strawberries and grapes and a 4pm lunch of a salad from whole foods and i won't be eating again until dinner, which will be much earlier than usual because i don'thave to work, and then maybe a snack of more fruit later if i get hungry.  almost on target of 2.5lbs a week, hopefully next week i can lose 3lbs and catch up!"

ugh i still haven't lost at all and i think its because i have been cheating in very small ways but starting now i will buckle down and stop cheating!  examples of small cheatings:
-ate small amount of bread that came with my salad yesterday
-had tiny amount of cheese in salad
-ate caramel dip with apple slices
-had 3 snack size take 5's (not really small cheat)
-ate samples in the grocery store.

no more!  starting right now i will not cheat and i will lose the weight i want to lose!  also no more smoothies for breakfast because i'm scared they might be bad too.  fresh fruit for breakfast instead.  this diet is only until wednesday and i can be good until then.  also half my stir fry for dinner instead of the whole 2 cups i have been having.  and if all that doesn't do the trick, i don't know what will!"

so i went to the gym after work and it was pretty funny because i haven't signed up yet, the first time i went i brought a 3 day pass so yesterday i was at the desk waiting to tell someone i was using day 2 but no one came so i just walked in and worked out and no one said anything.  i wonder how long i could get away with having no membership??  anyway i was lazy so i only walked 3k, took me about 45 minues and i didn't do anything really high intensity so i only gave myself the one point.  

this morning when i woke up the scale said 134.5 and i FLIPPED and got really upset and didn't go to the gym or walk the dogs but just went back to bed.  when i woke up again it said 134 even so i'm assumming i just have food/water weight and that i haven't really gained.  sadly i did not get down to 133 even but maybe tomorrow.  i guess i'll be going to the gym again tonight even though i really hate having to have such a later dinner.  i think my extra late dinner last night might be the culprit for my ""gain"" this morning.  

well here is my meal plan for today:
breakfast (11:30am): berry blitz smoothie
snack (2:00pm): strawberries and cantelope
lunch (4:00pm): salad and apple slices
snack (6-7pm): yogurt and remaining apple slices
dinner (10:00pm): stir fried rice with veggies in teryaki sauce (i use the term ""fried"" lightly as i am using pam in a wok and not oil so no added calories).

hope everyone else is doing well today.  i'm trying not to let the number i saw on the scale this morning get me down."

"event","i am sooooo hungry right now.  luckily i can have lunch in about 35 minutes!  i'm having a salad with pretty much just lettuce and carrots because i was too lazy to chop veggies this morning.  and then the rest of my apple sliced from last night.  hopefully that fills me up until my snack between 6-7pm of yogurt and a fruit cup.  i'll try to hold off eating my snack until 7pm so i'll have energy for the gym.  if i'm starving after the gym i might have a small salad with my rice.  

i'm trying to read ""fasting girls: the history of anorexia nervosa"" by joan jacobs brumberg to distract me from my hunger but its a pretty difficult read and i keep reading without actually reading.  i bet if i hadn't messed up my meal schedule yesterday i wouldn't be so freaking hungry right now.  i need to keep it up."

so i'm at 70%.  not good.  aiming for 10/10 today but am figuring on 9/10 due to water.  my throat hurts a bit and its hard for me to drink water when it hurts like this.  planning to go to the gym after work tonight because rob has class until 9pm or so.  guess i'll be having a real late dinner but thats okay.  i'll leave work as early as i can.  was excited to be down to 133.5 today.  hoping really hard for 133 flat tomorrow.  i need to lose 2.5lbs every 7 days to meet my goal of 10lbs this cycle.  i think i can do it.  that means i need to lose one more pound by saturday.  if i can stick to this diet i can probably do it.  .5lbs a day.  wish me luck!"

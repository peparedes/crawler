"event","this weekend I went to NJ.. family shit. It sucked. My cousins and brother went out and got drunk and I stayed back... bastards.
I really dont like much of my family. Nobody talked to me the whole time, everyone there was older than me or waaaay younger than me so it pretty much sucked the whole time.
I went to the mall and got a new pair of cons though. Theyre silk like chinese looking.
Im not doing anything all vacation really. I think Im going to saratoga tomorrow. And then the next day... 
probably just going to talk to Dick on the phone all vacation since we cant hang out... which is really what I need."

Nice to talk about amanda and kevin! THEY DONT LIKE YOU BECAUSE YOU'RE KIKE!!! Not because I Dont like you :D and way to call the fake nazis you fucking fake italian... ITALIANS DONT HAVE THOSE NOSES....

I have STDs... yeah. RIIIIIGHT. 
You sucked mike flatliners dick for what? A tshirt and cd??? PROSTITUTE???? yeah sounds like it to me.
and you went in the van w/ the fatass mike and he got your number... and what?? he didnt call your kike ass back... SCENE SLUT.

The only reason you liked kenny was because he was from saratoga... and notice how he left and DUMPED YOUR ASS. you went out for a whole 4 weeks? 5 maybe? but I have the stds
no thanks I've had the same BF for 9 months... 


And I definitely didnt expect you not to like her because I didnt. 
I think  it's fucking pathetic how you talk shit about EVERYONE and then want to be their best friends in person.
Liiiike. ALL OF KENNYS FRIENDS. And when you threw water on sidni and talked a whole lot of shit about her  and now you want to hang out w/ her? THATS WHAT I THINK IS FUCKING STUPID.

But getting back to the ""I think it's dumb how she expects me to hate someone because she does""
uhmmmmm when yo7u were in saratoga w/ kenny and you wanted to fight some emo chick and he's like yeah lets go down there and fight her and you were like ""No Im call Ali and have her come""
Orrrrrrr when Kevin's girlfriend hit you and you wanted to me to kick her ass???
Or at the one show you went to when lauren got all pissed at you aboutr starting fights and then you called me and were like ""I WISH YOU WERE THERE WE COULD HAVE KICKED THAT GIRLS ASS!!!""

And gretting on the topic of Elena... I really dont give a shit what she has to say.. I've met her... once? and besides you talk TONS OF SHIT ABOUT HER BEHIND HER BACK about she must have STDs too and how she takes it up the ass and fuck knows what else yoou've said you've talked soooo much shit about her...

but not only that.. I was hanging out w/ amanda today
and I guess people think I shaved my head and I just wear a wig... HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA, seriously. that's more funny than it is insulting. People in mayfield are fucking PSYCHO.
My hair doesnt even look anywhere near remotely close to a wig.
people are fucking fucked up.

But yeah so afterschool me and amanda walked around... Went to the ghettaway.. talked to those guys for a few... went to the skatepark.. smoked... went to jrecks and got some chicken wings thing... then we went around to this tattoo shop.. talked about how fucked my tattoo is and talked about him doing another for me.... :D so.. yeah. I think Im gettimng East End Girl tattoo somewhere on me..I dont know...

but yeah then I came home and talked to dick... and that's about it. I <b> LOVE <3333 </b> Dick"

It's depressing. But yeah.

I hate it when things go really good, and then someone lies and fucks things up again.
Or when you're sitting there watching someone do something REALLY STUPID over and over and then finally you're like hey dont fuckin do that anymore... and they still do it?
And then they lie to about it later?
fuckin lame.
People are just lame in general.

I want to do soemthing tomorrow but there's nothing to fucking do. So Im probably going to be sitting here doing nothing on my PC all day tomorrow. ... fun.

Saturday we went to the Great Escape it was cool. We met Dan and Larry there. Dick won me a bear it's cute... I went on the comet w/ Dan and LArry aha and Larry flashed the camera it was pretty sick but still funny. Then he gave us a ride back to dicks.. we hung out and waited for his parents to get home
The next day we didnt do anything at all. We hung out at his house all day a lone and then went and got movies..

I got my schedule finally. It sucks. I need to get it changed though. I hopefully want to drop this bullshit holocaust class w/ this kike teacher and take drivers ed. I would realllllllly like that. 
But yeah. I have homeroom w/ this teacher I hate and then a studyhall w/ her every other day. sucks.
and I think I have a virus. Every second shit starts popping up on my pc. Like the start menu and just other shit. It's fucked up.
I told Sandy I would goto this Scottish Games thing with her this friday-sunday and I dont want to. I'd rather goto the movies.. or goto the new age cabaret and beat this girls ass. 
Well maybe not kick her ass but harass her. or who knows.

"event","yeah.. so listen to this bullshit.
So for about 3 weeks now. My parents have been telling me I could get a tattoo on my arm for my 17th birthday. So at first I was going to get East End Girl done and then I wanted to get the Adicts face. So I was talking to my mom and she said whatever my dad says and I asked him and he said he didnt care. So I wasl ike alright all you have to do is talk to him now and she's like oh i will i will but never did for about 3 weeks.
So tonight I go to my dad 'you said you didnt care if I got a tattoo right?' and he's like '*sarcastic laugh* no I guess not' and Im like what the hell is that supposed to mean..
so.. more bullshit hpapens and Im not getting it anymore. They were like oh you can but you know if I do they're just going to bring more bullshit on me. It's fucking ridiculous. There's a lot more to the story but Im too tired to type it. It's just massive bullshit though and it really pisses me off.
My mom keeeps trying to bring up shit for people to feel sorry for her. And I did. but the same shit has happened to me, or pretty close to the same shit and i was FORCED TO GET OVER IT and she's still playing the sympathy card like months after.... It's fucking bullshit,
They're treat me like Im so fucking ignorant and stupid. And she tells me shit once and then I know and understand.. and then keeps saying it to me as if I dont fucking know it already
it's really pisses me the fuck off. I swear she thinks Im retarded. Or braindead. I dont even know. 
But yeah... I did absolutely nothing today. I ate.. and drove around w/ my brother for a little while.. he lost a piece of his car. I almost blew his tires. He was in a bad mood so it wasnt all that great. 
And now Im sitting down here w/ my dad and Im going to try and ignore him if he talks to me because I know if we do talk we'll end up fighting and then probably fist fighting. 
so.. Im in a bad mood and I hate everyone tonight."

"event","yeah yesterday I hung out w/ amanda. good times. funny fucking times.
we went around gloversvilles and video taped to white trash/ghettos
we even got some real footage of the white trash kids. it was hilaroius. I want to make copies and sell it. It's seriously the funniest 15 minute tape anyone could ever own.
I applied at this reallly cool place. Probably the only cool place in gville. It's called the GhettaWay. it's mocking Ghetto. but yeah they sell skater cloths, shot glasses, body jewelery, shit like that. confederate shit. I reallllly hope I get the job. It'll be just like chillin w/ the people who own it, who are pretty nice and cool, and every once in a while usin the cash register.
But today I had to go get a new permit. Ship some shoes. Not see dick.
this has been like over a fucking week. yep."

"event","last night I hung out w/ Amanda Gabbie and Jen. I love amanda I miss hanging out w/ her now :( me and her have a lot of the same shit going on. We're a lot alike it's almost scary.
but yes last night was pretty fun. It was really boring until some little bitch started talking shit about Gabbie. So of course everyone got pissed off because Gabbie is the shit.  She doesnt start shit w/ anyone. so this chick hated her for no reason. Me and Amanda went over and talked shit to her and she was like ignoring us... pussy.
but yeah the funniest thing happened though I wish I had it on fucking tape. This might not make sense to anyone reading this but it was funny as fuck. Me and Amanda were walking to McD's and Amanda was really pissed off about a few things and these kids were standing in the walkway to mcds so amanda like trampled right through these flowers. It was soo funny. I just started laughing. It was like this pissed off skingirl trampling through these pretty yellow flowers hahahahahah it was one of the funniest thigns I ever saw. no joke. 
but yep! that was my night."

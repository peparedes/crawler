"event","i honestly felt ridiculous creating this profile. i did so so that me and jen could talk while shes in mexico. ironically however, this journal is becoming real for me....i find my entries have become serious and actually have that confiding-in tone to them. it even feels semi good to vent to a journal. easy to move on when somethings on paper. kinda like the bad shits on that page, which u can refer to at your liesure. &amp; since its written down, no need to carry it round in memory...like a bank.
as i wrote that i heard&nbsp; Brotha Lynch in my head...""&nbsp; manic depressive only learned one lesson; thats fuckin forget it n let it die like the rest of em""&nbsp;&nbsp; Suicide Note disc 2 -track2 &nbsp;""better off dead""
anyway this has been your moment in my mind.
til next time"

"event","right now, my fathers in his bedroom at his moms house tweaking off the Crystal Palace journey he took yesterday.&nbsp;
he isnt him, hes an animal, rabid and unpredictable, so i worry
his mother, the worlds sweetest woman, lies in bed now fretting if the mistakes her family makes are her fault..so i worry
my unaccomplished(to put it nicely) just knocked to be let inside, like a cat that we should never have set the saucer out for. He was high off either crank or crack, i didnt speak to him enough to tell. so i worry.
my grandfather had his last kemo treatment this morning. now we wait to see if any of it did him any good. Prayers are appreciated, but not prescribed, so i worry.
my mom is kinda feeling that shes failing as a mom kuz my Bro wont stop being a jackass. so i worry.
Kodie hasnt dropped clean since he got released from rehab, and hes hanging with that joke-of-a-thug mike.so i worry.
the Corporate guy is in town to chickenhawk us, and since im the only one not spineless or intimidated, im forced to handle all dealings with him. i have to anwer for all our shit. Thanks Jessika.we shoulda been shut down months ago. so i worry.
i trust HER, and only her. im not worried bout her loyalty to me while shes gone.which surprises me,&nbsp; and makes me proud a myself. but i know she knows she dates a Thug and i know she knows how things are for me here, that it takes patience and love.i just Pray that shit wont become too much for her. it feels like itll tear me apart if im left alone. shes the best companion ive ever had.and i hope shell love me the way she does forever. id give her anything.but im a undiagnosed manic depressive gangster whos main emotions in life are animosity and hostility towards shitty surroundings. and shes the most beautiful talented purest thing there is on earth. i dont want her to ever give up on me.so i worry.
im sick a worrying."

"event","alotta people, religious people, have their own stories about real life encounters where they swear they saw an angel, or that an angel was present in aiding them somehow.&nbsp;
well, im ashamed to admit that my relationship with God isnt as strong as it was before. i hardly pray because of how far things have pushed me. i still believe, i guess im just afraid and ashamed of myself. im losing or have lost everything, and i live a life where i feel imprisoned and stuck.&nbsp;
then today happened.
i was standing behind the ICS counter at work, supervising sierra explain a flavor situation to a customer. well, supervising means i was reading the dandydime classifieds lookin for a car. saw a 67 Impala tricked out like a fiend on payday. as a joke i say hey sierra gimme&nbsp; 5 grand. the customer, a 40something yr old black woman with her daughter quickly notices why i made the comment and says to me, ""save for a house first, get a good line of credit...itll help when u go to purchase a car."" (she turned out to be a realitor, go figure)..neway, the flavor situation led her to only wanting a vanilla cone for her daughter. i got it for the woman and it was a Jon Cone. stacked high and beautifully (its a talent ) like a statue of soft serve. the woman thot this was really nice and said something like we gon say a prayer for you now tonight. she xplained they were going to church as i rang her upand told her the price, 1.72. she gave me a ten, and i wouldnt wanna break a ten for a buck 72 cone, so i told her jus have it on me.
she was really complimented by my mediocre generosity ( i probably give out ten free ones a day outta laziness). bt she stated again that they would most definitely add me into their familys prayers that night. i thanked her, very honored. think wat u will but ive been away from god since the last time i had to beg him to let me keep jen. and heres this random stranger telling me shell pray for me jus because i did something i often do.&nbsp;

thats not where it ended. i went to get her a spoon from the AW side and she followed me and when i handed napkins to her&nbsp; she took my hand and began to pray to Jesus that i be prosperous and fruitfull in my quests in life and that i may obtain wat i chase throu my&nbsp; kinheartedness and hardwork. it was stunning, and i at first worried that B Lo, who was eating in the lobby would see and crack up, making it a scene. but nstead i felt honored like i said, and so i bowed my head and said amen with her at the end. then she left, and i was pretty aware that god had jus bitchslapped me to remind me that a lil prayer lifts anyone. and also that doing a lil xtra good outta ur way for strangers is how we was meant to live .


corny or watever that happened. and i think i might return the prayer , even spark a convo with the Big Guy.....He knows i could use it...."

"event","this is how i tried to reach Koko. i dont know if i just put my foot in my mouth, or if it had anything to it at all. bt i tried. n frankly, im almost spent on trying.&nbsp;<br /><br />i told him sometimes life is like a hole. ur stuck in this hole, say its 6 by 6. n the ultimate goal is to advance your pace and your path. now, the only feasible way is to climb out carefully, so as not to fall fast back to the bottom. after u climb out, ull begin to crawl, then walk, then jog and run then sprint and so on...now u can choose to skip to the walking&nbsp; or running right away, bt ull only bump into the wall of the hole. or you could walk or run in circles around the bottom of the hole. either way, youre walking/running, bt goin nowhere. pace, but no path. you may even decide to dig the hole wider and deeper, bt this is obviously NOT advancing your path, it just gives the illusion of advancement. u got more hole to run around in freely, bt u r not free nor are u moving. u r still holed. i told him he , like all of us, have to <strong><em><u>asses being in a hole by climbing out carefully, using your head, and then crawl to your feet, begin to walk, and when&nbsp;youre ready ,&nbsp;pace into a sprint.</u></em></strong>&nbsp;<br /><br />i dont know if he got it, i dont know if i told it right, but telling it to someone who needs to hear it kinda helped me to understand it better...<br /><br /><br />"

"event","what do u do, when everything u know and have known comes crumbling down to nothing? when all that did matter matters no more? i dont feel the drive in gangbangin, or even in smokin bud nemore. i dont care that i dont do much of either. i used to be know for it. now i wonder if thats changeable? is redemption a possibility for me? i think redemption is something i can chase. i just pray the chase wont be fruitless in the end. am i cursed to this? i know i am a Thug for life,&nbsp; or that thuglife will always b alive in me. but im talkin ive been the last G on my block down to bust for years now. alone. all my YGs and Bhounds do they own thang. they beef with eachother like ckrabs. the loyalty we swore to is gone, and it looks like the friendships are fading. even my enemies found new enemies....thats low. i sold my guns. gave up my bullets, still carry a shank, bekuz i realize that even if i ""get out"" as u mite call it, there is no out. foos remember faces, n retaliation rules.but for the most part, i want no more of it. the madness and violence. at least b4 it was worth it. its on my skin n never going away. ill b a&nbsp; Hustler Brim every day. bt i wanna b one that did something, went somewhere. i dont know where this sudden revelation of mine came from. its probably from jen being away and me being alone here again. theres a slight fear that in her absence i may relapse into sum action. im fighting that temptation and keepin my nose clean.im makin&nbsp; my money my way, but im not bangin or getting caught up in shit. all words of confession asside, im in love with her. sooo deeply in love like i never imagined i could be. im young. but i dont care, grown men havent witnessed struggles ive survived. shes my way out and my ticket to&nbsp; my own salvation. so ill do this for me, but its because of her. shes that someone that made a YG wanna live, and live happily. So, ima keep goin n maintain til im with her again. She made me strong by loving me, so i owe her&nbsp; my love n loyalty. Missin ya jen."

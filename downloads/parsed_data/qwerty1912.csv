"event","<P>hmm so apparently ive gotten into writing once a week..so this weekend was 4 dayz and on thursday i went and saw the dance show with lauren and chantel and it was cute!...<STRONG>all the songs were about sex</STRONG>. it was so funnie cuz the audience was like half parents. and the ppl behind us kept going ""WHAT""&nbsp; ""okaaay"" from that song. it was awesome.&nbsp; so after that lauren came over to my house and we (I) danced around to willie wonka songs while my brother pretended to ignore me.&nbsp; so i walked lauren up to kamiakin so joe could pick her up. and she was spose to work out wit me the next day, but she didnt, so&nbsp;i was mad. and then me and hilllary werent really on the same wavelength that morning but i saw her kitty. and its little and it has funnie little hisses and growls.&nbsp; i have never heard a kitten growl before that it was cute. so friday nite i hung out wit my dad cuz im a <STRONG>loser</STRONG>. haha yeah. we watched the matchstick man which is actually a really good movie. my brother had a bunch of his little friends over so i went downstairs and bothered them for a while.&nbsp; i went down to ask them wut they wanted from the store to drink and one of them was like ""o anything alcoholic"" and i was like <STRONG>wait! r my brothers friends cool?</STRONG> but then i think no.&nbsp; so after the movie i watched them play vice city for a while and get drugs and hookers.&nbsp; o friday i also went down to coldstone to get my paycheck which was like 75 dollars. and im mad b.c im only working like once a week so my paychecks are like between 70 and 90 dollars. </P>
<P>so saturday i did something, but i forgot wut it was so yeah, but later that nite kelley called me up and ended up coming over and she broke her foot being a dumbass on friday (sorry, but its true). and we ate salmon and hten on the way to her house stopped off at coldstone to get some icecream and i brought her into the back wit me and stein made her work, so it was funnie. and i had to restock and shit to, cuz im a nice person. and it was cool b.c they were proud of me for something else and <STRONG>it made me feel good</STRONG>. which i like. so then we got to kelleys house and little kelly came over and we watched part of kill bill til we got distracted. and ummmm got up and went to the mall and i bought some 12'' hoops, but they are too big b/c i tried to skip 14' and it didnt work so i gotta go back this weekend and get some of those. umm then i worked on sunday nite with anna which was fun and we went to taco bell afterwards and the guy that worked there was <STRONG>realy rad.</STRONG> he gave us a bunch of <STRONG>free stuff</STRONG> and he did that whole ""AND THEN"" thing with the drive thru speaker that they do on ""dude wheres my car"". i love that movie. speaking of that movie, me and sarita used to watch it all the time and now we dont even talk or wave to each other in the hall or anything, its kinda weird how in like a year u can go from being best friends wit someone to not even acknowledging&nbsp; them</P>
<P>yeah back to my life...so more boring things...umm monday i got a <STRONG>new flip phone</STRONG> with a <STRONG>camera!</STRONG> it is so pretty and i love it and i feel superficial and i dont even care. so that was pretty much it for monday cept i had volleyball practice which is always good times because i like&nbsp;most&nbsp;of the ppl on the team and i talk to htem and deal wit the others (OTHER). so today was tuesday and i had my blood taken and it hurt, not really but its disgusting. so it hurt mentally...haha im just kidding that was a joke. so hmm thats bout it. went home, worked out, went to the gparents which is sad b.c.&nbsp; o yeah i also have feeling that some one played a really fucked up joke on me today and if thats true im gonna be hella pissed tomoro. so im gonna have to figure that out. yeah so sorry bout the boringness. !</P>

"event","hmm so i havent written in forever...because im kinda lazy now i guess..or maybe its because im actually getting a life..HAHA o wait that cant be it.newayz i cant remember wut the last time i wrote was so ill start on friday...umm hung out wit lauren and joe...joe is seriously a really nice guy. i kno all u guyz are like ""MWAHMWAHMWAH hes so old MWAH"" but yes hes old and yes i would never go out wit someone that old, but hes nice.  hes not like one of those 24 year olds whose incredibly peverted and could ONLY GET 16 year old ass... hes juss not at a 24 yr old level of maturity..more like 19...so the math works.  yeah so that happened and then on friday nite me and lauren did something that i havent done in a couple months. and I FORGOT HOW MUCH I LOVE IT! i seriously love it and i realize that that is a bad thing, but i dont care. wow.  yeah so saturday i got up early (still have not slept in since b4 the cruise) and got my hair dyed by lisa at celebrity status.  so leaving laurens house u go by the brickyard park and ride wheere that tent city is goin up. and OMG there was like 35 ppl there protesting and seriously get off urself...stop being so snobby...i mean if i was homeless i would rather live in juanita then seattle..half the ppl living there are gonna be kids and teenagers. ppl are just gay and dont understand...either that or theyre worried about image like my mum..who is incredibly worried about image. ppl need to think that we have everything under control and everything is perfect and we have tons of money, etc...ummm NOPE..id rather just be straight out wit ppl and be like ""this is my situation and think wut u want"" see i wanna be like that, and i strive to be like that, but im not and it pisses me off cuz i cant be totally open with anyone. none of my friends.  i mean i have like 2 or 3 girls that i am really close to but i cant tell them anything serious serious. and I DONT KNO WHY!
yeah so where was i before i got sidetracket....o yeah got my hair dyed and it looks pretty good and all of u have better have noticed...so then i came home and slept (whoohoo) and then i worked on saturday nite with monica and stein and hella shit went wrong and we got shit for tips and it was over all gay.  but i like the ppl that work there. monicas really cool and stein is one of htose ppl that makes u feel like u can talk to them bout anything when u first meet them..its pretty cool...so hmm sunday was mothers day and the parents went to a mariners game and i was home wit the bro and taught him how to ride a metro bus to laurens so i could pick up ""something"" lol...so then i had fun at home by myself that day (i seriously did, no sarcasm there) and then went to Dicks for dinner.
God damn SO MANY DAYS....monday - went to kamikain to get my $70, volleyball practice...cant think of anything else...Tuesday - god damn this short term memory loss...all i remember is that i worked and i couldnt find spoons and ppl felt bad for me and gave me 4 dollar tips.
So on to today. wednesday...i love talking to adam and owen on the bus in the morning, just because they dont care about anything and its fun.  Classes were lame..i understand nothing in science and marketing is boring as hell...little bit of awkward drama goin on in LASS wit switchin people and shit. but yeah ummm god damn i seriously cant think  rite now..like my mind is blank i wrote to much and that means im done

one more thing...i have a plan to find kelley! everyone be proud of me
another thing (last thing i promise) if ur gonna tell stories about things that happened in order to make urself seem more bad-ass, make sure that when ur tellin the story ppl that were actually there are not listening because they will kno u r lying and trying to seem cool...and even if no one is listening dont do it..cuz it doesnt make u cool.

HMMM well im depressed (whoa big suprise there) and i dont really feel like typing out why because i only kno like half the reasons so its gonna sound lame.. but i read this article for science class about y ppl are depressed and apparently my precortex cerebral is not making enuf serotonin so theres too many receptors trying to get at too little serotonin so it sucks it all up before it has a chance to produce a calming effect or something like that.  i read like 4 articles and summarized all of them so they kinda all blend together in my head. i decided that i need to change my personality also, but i really dont kno how. and i dont kno if i want to cuz the reasons i would is just to please other ppl that would eventually please myself and i dont kno if im down wit that..hmm i miss kelley...yeah so that thing i quit last week...well i broke down today...o well..i didnt really think it was gonna last anyways..this week has just been horrible for keeping quit on things..i also am still getting back into my 8th grade habit which is bad considering summer is coming up.  yeah so rite now theres open gym at juanita and im not there because im tired and i dont feel like being social..i am totally not looking foward to summer because im not gonna see anyone because i dont call ppl to make plans, i make plans at school and then go. and really i only make plans withl like 3 pppl and its just crazy ness.  yeah thats bout it. o besides that i kinda flipped out today at hillary and im sorry for that.  i still feel the same way i just should have reacted differently and i apologize. its just i was completely suprised and overwhelmed and sympathetic all at the same time and apparently sagitarius are incredibly emotional."

THEN we went to the concert, and waited in liek this <STRONG>MILE LONG LINE</STRONG> serisouly it like went around a whole block and we were freezin...so we got inside and the paramounts a <STRONG>hella nice place</STRONG> and you wouldnt expect it to be playin punk rock bands or anything. so we went to the balcony and there was so mosh pit there so i was sad...but i got over it.. so billy talent played first and he pretty much sucked... he just kept liften his shirt a bunch and rubbin his nipples...it was pretty crazy,... so sugarcult got on and they were a little better. cuz i actually knew most of their songs so it was funner. well we were sittin pretty far&nbsp;up wit nicole and there was the hottest guy ever behind us and i kno that none of u would&nbsp;think he was hott but i almost died...but he had a girlfriend... but his friend kept staring at me and smiling really big and it was kinda creepy. so brittay and i left that area because we wanted to get close to see the next set&nbsp; THEN simple plan came on and they are <STRONG>SO GOOD IN CONCERT!</STRONG> like i kno a bunch of ppl dont like em czu theyre supossedly <EM>sell outs</EM> or sumthin but they had such good concertness. or concert presence or sumthin.&nbsp; i totally lost my voice. and me and brittany were all jumpin up and down and rockin out it was soo much funN! they sang most of their popular songs and then their was the lighter one....which is always cool cuz it looks so pretty.&nbsp; and then we had to do this hard clapping thing that im not even gonna try exlpaining cuz either u wont understand or u will think im lame for not being able to do it.&nbsp; so then they sang a cover version of black eyed peas <EM>where is the love</EM> and it was really funnie. so after their set was done we went down to buy some shit and i bought a poster but then me bein cool...i ripped it..so me bein cool again tried ot blame it on someone else so i was like ""dude u gave me a ripped poster!"" and then he was ""im positive i didnt...but i really dont care so heres a new one and go away..."" so that was kinda strange...and then <STRONG>we needed water!</STRONG> but it cost 3 dollars for a tiny little bottle and the line was like 300ppl long (no joke) so i wak up to this nice looking girl whose like 3rd in line and im liek ""hey can u buy me a water"" and she was like ""of course"" so she was a genuinley nice person, which is always good to meet.&nbsp; hmm then i called jim(My uncle) on his phone and told him how much time was left and my voice seriously cracked like 3x in every word...i really never wanna hear that message i left him... so then MxPx was on...and they were alrite...i dont like em that much so it wasnt as cool...but they were good. they had this girl come on stage and play wit them which i thought was really awesome..&nbsp; so that was done and brittany and i got lost tryin to find my uncles car cuz he said it was by the building with the four flags....every building on the street had 4 flags...geez.. so we saw kacia and she lost her favorite sandel in the mosh pit...which suxs. hmm then we foudn the car and went to like chevron and talked to the worker about how he should invest in a knock off <STRONG>Slurpee</STRONG> brand...but he wasnt to into it...so that was sad...then we got home and were all hyped up and bouncin around...we finally started watchin this drug movie at like 1 called Go and it was really good but we fell asleep before it was over so nwo i dont kno if alll hte ppl died or wut.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Sunday.....got up.....ate some food....lauren came over and we took pictures of me in the woods for her photo class and i crawled into a little hovel....it wasnt really a hovel as much as it was a hole...but OMG as we were walking into the woods these 3 little girls walked out and when they say us they screamed and i was like ""why are u screaming"" and they were like""we didnt see u"" so then i asked them wut they were doing and they said they were <STRONG>digging a grave!</STRONG> and they actually had a huge shovel with them and everything...so that was kinda unnerving.&nbsp; so took pictures and then went to volleyball practice which was pretty cool....hmmm then i hitched a ride home with brittany and actually <STRONG>found my way to rachel marlows house by myself</STRONG>...it was cool. so rachel and i and hillary went and played soccer at kamiakin. but it was kinda dark so we left...yeah so thats about it....sorry u had to read all that! :)</P>

"event","lets see...wut happened today.. i have to think because im talkin to hillary right now about brent who is being incredibly gay...and its pissin me off even tho i am not the one talking to him. I also realized something today...that horoscopes are real (dum dum dum) no seriously cuz like 2 weeks ago rachael told me that saggitareuses(totally spelled wrong) are really emotional andi didnt believe her, cuz i was like ""im not emotional blah blah blah"" but today i realized that i am way more emotional than any of my friends (but i only have like 3 friends so thats not saying much, but STILL) so i think that shit is pretty cool.yeah lets see today... i reffed some volleyball at kamiakin and omg they suck a whoole lot... i just wanted to run out onto the courth and push them over and play by myself and win.  i really had to stop myself from yelling.lets see then i went to hillarys and then to work out then we met brent at the snow king ice place in kingsgate, i totally forgot what it was called. which all wasnt really that exciting but something good came out of it. i got home and my mom was all mad becaues she couldnt get ahold of me and i was like ""well i had to cancel my cell phone because i dont have enuf money"" and then she thought for a long time and finally agreed that i was rite, which like never happens and made me feelr eally cool. so now if i walk to dog every day she will pay for my cell phone.. which is of course a pain in the ass, but its worth it. cuz i never realized how much i needed it. i had to sit outside of juanita for 1/2 hour yesterday in the cold because i couldnt call anyone to pick me up. and then today i ditched brianna because all the lights were off in her house and no one answered the door so i thought she ditched me. but if i had my cell phone i could have called her and solved all hte problems in the world. yeah but okay i gotta go watch the end of american idol cuz i am a huge loser! haha :)

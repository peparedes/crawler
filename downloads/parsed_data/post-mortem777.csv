"event","Well.  Today sucked.  I basically sat around waiting for Alex to call.  Yes, I am a hopeless loser.  We went to see Shall We Dance.  It was...umm...*shrug*.  Well, that wasn't really that bad.  If it weren't for the fact that directly afterwards we both got quite down on ourselves.  I think I've recovered...  Her on the other hand...I'm worried.  I've been up all night trying my best to cheer her up, but I fear it was a waste.  I just hope she is alright."

"event","Well, I find myself here again.  I guess it really is addicting, Though it's more of a peer pressure thing.  I fear someone would beat me if I didn't update this.  Well, today Mike and Sean came over after school.  We had a time.  Rocked Orion for a little while.  It's coming pretty well.  I've got my whole part down except the last solo, but the two biggest parts of it are pretty easy.  Well have it down in a week for sure.  Any-who, afterwards we went to St. Anne's to terrorize the Churchgoers.  It was a failure.  Instead we urinated on public property.  Thats always good for a few laughs, especially when you are a guy.  Man how I love to be immature.  Yes, well, after they went home I ate and jammed, then went to the Y with Cole.  While there I decided to throw a party on friday.  Grandma Chuck will be home, but, she is old.  She probably wont even know whats going on.  It will be wacky."

"event","I have just reached a glorious new low.  I have a blog.  Well, being as technologically skilled as I am, I have no idea what to do.  Amanda is basically guiding me through step by step.  Now if only i could get her to finish this entry...Well, the best I can do is a direct quote.  ""You played on the blow house.  And talked to the great me.""
There you have it.  My first entry ever.  And likely my last."

""a letter to the old
kiss our cheeks in the cold
remember when nothing mattered
innocence loses face in days
now we're faced with this hazy maze
a hysterical craze
running thru this town
get up and get down
before the blood stains her gown
tonight we hold close
more heat to fuel my only passion
turn the knob one more notch
its not loud enough to drown the screams
i fear that we might be at the end
hope is up
count the memories before they end."" 

i love those who pose nude for me."

until we get internet in the house, i will be slow on the updates...

but if u want a real good update, come to denton and join the fun.

""don't forget the message sent
orders to slit her throat
a kiss is what i should have meant
but then would she not float?
let her sink to the bottom
no fight left in this drop
let these memories be forgotten
and make all the nightmares stop.""

loves and kissies to all that want them."

"event","yah so me and sosa went to look for an appartment today and we found a badass douplex with 3 bedrooms...so we decided to use the master as our music room.  rockass.  hopefully it'll be ours sometime next week...fucko.

lonely nights when the rain is out
tired of aimlessly walking about
i want some food to satisfy
i need a jack in the box nearby

we practice tomorrow but bond might not be able to make it.  hopefully he will...but if not, we'll just get that music tite...cause that's how SP rolls...on Spreewells bitches.

Check out our new song...at least the lyrics.  peace and rock.

""Maybe she'll forget about me
Over a cup of coffee.
I really can't stay and see
What she might say to me.
Actually, the curiosity
Makes me wonder...
What the hell?
Why not?
Maybe just one more round

Lets start jumpin' - YEAH!
Lets start dancin' - YEAH!
We're high fivin' - YEAH!
We're havin' fun - WOO!

How dare you accuse me?
All that I do is for you
But thats alright with me
You're too much
for my patience
I have been trying to leave anyways
Promise you won't follow me?
I am gonna go
Please let me go
I want to go

Is that her over there?
Damn I gots to go,
I didn't see her coming.
Tell her I left the engine running.
She won't believe that
She likes the hunt anyways
Sure, I'd love to stay and chat
But this is a gun to your head

POW!!!

Hello Spanish Mamma, would you care to tango?
I'd love to burn some marley, move your hips with mine
You place your hands here, and mine go there
What the hell is that?

Oh my god, is that a knife?
She paid you? Tell her to come out and stab me herself.
So I guess this is love...
You have plotted my death from day one.

Sticks and stones may break my bones
but knives will always kill me"""

"event","Wow...my first LJ entry...coolio.  I guess I've become so used to the same thing that I needed something else to keep me occupied on the computer.  Now everyone can see how little I do, yet still manage to do so much.

I think I want a girlfriend, but it seems like any time I find someone that interests me, they either dont feel the same or they are total whores.  Where is my Newo Ikkin??

So C&C are gonna be on the Dallas Warped Tour date...guess who else will be there?  Apparently the comic book will be sold there...that's reason enough for me to go right there.  Just watch, in a couple of years, I might be on one of those stages...dreams never die.

Well basketball is more important to me right now so I am off to the t.v. to see some action.  Check out a new band I like called ""Head Automatica""  The singer might sound filmiliar to some...if you know then you fuckin rock.  K I'm out, so I'll end with a lyric or two.  Maybe I can make this a routine hahahahahaha...these arent mine..some will be, and some wont.

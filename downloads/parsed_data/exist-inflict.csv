"event","It seems I have neglected to recount the happenings of my less than exciting life for some time now.  I must be getting lazy, or my life is getting more boring...probably both.  This holiday season has had it's ups and downs.  The best being Lala's party.  Many a good times were had by all, thank ya darling!  There were the countless, frustrating yet enjoyable hours of trying to get Robs studio in working order.  Some songs were written, with fingers sore from rocking out and so forth.  Rock and roll kicks my ass......  Some random late night hanging-out and chowing down on KD with Kevin while kicking the shit out of the cat.  He likes it.
The downs were starbucks and not seeing Jess.  Starbucks is just getting retarded.  It's so busy, people are rude and unappreciative, and I'm really not liking the new people Laura is hiring, because they all seem to be somewhat like her, and I really don't like her much herself.  So, I am looking for a new job!  Mostly just in the area of CD Plus, haha.  I've been talking to Justin and he's not sure what he's doing about staffing here in the new year, but he knows I'm knowledgable and whatnaut, so I think I have a chance.  Yay!  Gonna be staying with Safeway of course, since they pay me the big moola (not really, but it's decent).  I really like working there, everyone seems to like me, which seems to be a first (imagine that...).  The not seeing Jess part is getting really hard, I must admit.  Every time we make plans to see each other, one of us gets called into work, like tonight.  I had such a nice evening planned, then she tells me yesterday that they had a girl quit and now she has to work.  ARG!  I can't stop thinking about her, and I haven't seen her in almost 3 weeks!  I really don't want to let it go, because this never happens to me.  Meet a nice girl who is interested back who isn't a stupid manipulative whore.  I guess I just have to wait it out and keep trying.
In other news, school is back next week and I am super stoked.  More MIDI, some recording with Plan B, some recording with Insert (maybe), and some more of Bob's sarcastic wit.  Can't wait!

I helped her out with her close, because it was pretty busy in there and I was kinda being a distraction, haha.  She really liked her present.  It was awesome.  Can't wait to see her again.

Yesterday was also the 1 year anniversery of Kevin's accident, so I bought him some beer and hung around with him all afternoon.  I felt kinda bad leaving him to go see Jess, but he understood.  I was hoping he'd still be up when I got back, but he was pretty tired all day.  We are doing something with Melea tonight, so that will be fun.  I still have school until Thursday, and then I work all the way up to Christmas (i might have said all of this before because I always forget what I've written about and I'm too lazy to go back and read my old entries, haha).  I'm kinda getting excited about christmas.  Not for presents and that crap, but for family and such.  I always like getting together with my cousins, but for the last two or three years I have been working so much around the holidays that I'm so beat that I end up going home and passing out.  Not this year!  Roni is home from switzerland with Andi and his friend, so I really want to hang out with them.

Can't wait for the 2 weeks off so I can hang out with Jess and Sacha <3!

Tonight I am going out to Enderby to see Jess.  I can't wait to give her her present.  I'm stoked.  Tuesday, hanging out with Kevin and Melea, then working all the way up to Christmas, yay.

Apparently Rob is a little resentful that I'm not recording him Alex and Phil.  I guess I could use them for my final, digital project, if they get it together and write some decent, relevant material.

I make more than enough to live on (for me, right now anyway), but I always seem to be broke.  It's probably because I go to starbucks way too often.

"event","So, my date on Friday didn't work out, because of the stupid snow!  But, we managed to get together last night.  It went pretty good, aside from a few awkward moments and getting taken out by some careless, annoying kid (we went skating).  We seem to have quite a bit in common, personality wise.  And she's pretty cute.  Her name is Jess.  I hope we can get together again soon.  We were only out for a short time, because she had to work in the morning, so I went back to Vernon (she lives in Enderby) and met up with Lala and Chris at the rock show.  I made it just in time for Rise In The Fall's set (yeah Tim!).  That was pretty awesome.  We left halfway through Angel Grinder's set because chris was being a big baby, haha j/k!  But they sounded really good.  On a sad note, my dog was hit by a car Friday morning.  He was old and on his way out, but that's not a good way to go.  R.I.P Maxwell, I'll miss you.

I just had to get away, so I went home to my parents to wind down Saturday morning.  It felt good, since I guess I was feeling a little home sick, just yearning for my own space (haha!).  Losing my debit card and partner card probably didn't help the stress either, but I'm working around that okay.  Jacqui can't come to Van with us now, which kinda pisses me off, because I asked her if she wanted to come, then waited about a month for her to get back to me.  She came and saw me at work and said to get her a ticket, so I did.  I tell her I have her ticket, and she tells me she can't go now.  ARG!  Third time in a row that I'm scrambling to find someone to come so I don't get stuck with a ticket (Kevin is trying....).  I never find someone either, so I have to sell the ticket for less outside of the show and I get screwed by about $20!  Never again!  People are getting their own tickets from now on.  Or I'm getting the money first so people think twice about cancelling.....geez.  Doing something with Melea on Saturday, and I possibly have a date on Friday :)  here's hoping!

"event","the first snowfall is always so beautiful.  Everything is covered in a blanket of white and it feels like the world just stops and the quiet just seems amplified.  It's so peaceful.  Then you leave home and see all of the chaos that something so beautiful can cause.  Mainly car accidents, and that dreadful feeling that seeing lot's of emergency vehicle lights gives you.  Welcome to winter.  Haha....

Seeing the mountains all covered in snow always makes me want to go snowboarding really bad.  I never have the time to though, and I really shouldn't spend the money to go, but being up on the mountain is such a peaceful feeling.  I like to go alone (even though you really shouldn't) because it gives me some time to myself to just enjoy the quiet and ride at my own pace.  Here's hoping I can make it up there this year.

I'm pretty stoked about going to Vancouver again soon.  Yeah My Chemical Romance and Thrice.  So far, Jacqui is coming, and Lala wants to but I haven't heard from her in a while (hint, hint, haha)....

I'm looking at buying a DI line mixer and headphone amplifier so Kevin and I can start writing songs late at night without disturbing the neighbors or Ryan and Kristina.  It's gonna be around $300 to $400, ouch, but it would all be useful later on anyway.

I don't know if I'll have a job in my field right away, so this would be a good place to start.  I'd be making a fair amount of money and I could pay off my loans.  Then, I'll just save like mad, then move somewhere cool and just do cool stuff, haha.  It will probably be to Vancouver.  I'll have to move somewhere for safeway first, because when you get into management, they make you sign this sheet so they can send you out to whatever store they want.....stupid, but I don't care, I don't really have much here, except for my family and a handful of friends who I love dearly.  I'll just live cheaply until my loans are paid off, save a ton of money, go travelling when I can, then settle in Vancouver where I can get involved with underground rock scene.

So, it's Halloween (big deal...), and I actually have the night off (actually is a big deal), so I think Ryan and I and maybe Rob, Jordan, Troy, and Luke, are going to go check out that haunted houses in the area (set up ones, not real ones, unfortunately).  The one in Armstrong last year, was awesome (kudos to Julie), so this years should be a blast.  There's also one at the BX fire hall and one at the Science Center, so we will probably check them out too.  I'm trying to get some time off  this weekend, because it's Lala's, Rob's, and Ryan's birthdays and they all want to do something on Saturday night.  I am working, then working again in the morning, of course.  Not that I really want to party, being not overly fond of alcohol, I would just like to spend some time with some people who are important to me.  I ran into Jacqui last night, which was cool.  I never see her anymore, which is sad, cuz she makes me happy.  I was walking through the mall on my break yesterday and I ran into 4 people I knew, just trying to get back to work on time.  I barely made it.  First, I ran into Dwight.  He was buying music (good man...), then I ran into Kate (I'm gonna miss her...).  As we were talking, Emily came running by, didn't even see us, so we called after her and she came back.  She was looking pretty hot, I must say.  After I left them, I was almost out the door when Ben walks in.  We chatted a bit about seeing his band play and getting them into the studio to record some demos.  Then I was back at work.  All the craziness of serving people over priced coffee (damn, I want to quit.....) Yay!  just talked to Tyler!

Seems that everyone seems to be un-approving of my hanging out with Juanita.  My mother has ""forbidden"" me to get involved with her, and apparently Melea is not speaking to me because of it.  I am not getting seriously involved with her, no matter how it seems.  Yes, we are close, but I don't trust her at all.  She's a little too messed up.  That's all I have to say about that......

That said, I am rather enjoying my current schedule of all school, all work, minimal fun.  I find it keeps me grounded.  It keeps me thinking about things that are important and I don't get caught up in things I shouldn't worry about.  School is my main focus right now.  It's going so good.  I've been thinking about what I'm gonna do when I'm done, a lot.  Nita keeps asking me if I want to do all of these things with her, like go to california, and australia, and wherever.... I keep telling her ""we'll see"", but with her record for being effing weird, I don't see it happening.  I want to move somewhere cool, with a good underground rock scene, find some amazing unknown band, produce them and relases them on my own label.  I'll probably start in Vancouver, but it seems like all of the local bands that are getting noticed are taking off for Montreal or the states, so maybe that's what I'll do.  England is one place I really want to go, maybe not to stay, but definately to visit.  There are some killer studios I want to visit, like SARM.  So nice!

Then the next night, we had a bunch of people from safeway and Phil over for some drinking.  I didn't drink cuz I was pretty tired.  Alex was so drunk he could barely stand, haha.  Good times.

School has started and it is so awesome!  We're working on programming tracks with loops on a program called ACID, haha.  It all comes out sounding like Techno.  It's great.  I can't wait to get into the studio and start engineering and producing.

"event","It's been an interesting, fun, and somewhat depressing week.

On Monday, Nita and I drove out to Edmonton to visit our friend Mike, who we haven't seen since high school.  We were in the car for a total of about 14 hours that day, because there was a bad accident just out side of Golden that closed the highway for 4 hours.  Then we got to Edmonton, and couldn't get a hold of Mike or Dan, so we ended up sleeping in my car in the Wal-Mart parking lot.  We went to West Edmonton Mall, and visited Mike at work, then went to a movie with him, then we slept in my car again, then we drove home.  Overall, it was a pretty fun trip, weird, but fun.....

Thursday was Kevin's 21st birthday, so we got him really drunk.  It was great.  It was also a depressing night for me because it was Nita's last night here before she moved to Maple Ridge.  And what does she do?  She brings this creepy guy Fogan with her.  He was a fucking tool and we all wanted to kick the shit out of him.  I just hid in my room, cuz I couldn't drink and didn't want to deal with all the drunk people.  I had to work at 5:30 in the morning, so I stayed up all night.  I was awake for 34 hours straight.  Then Nita came to see me at work before she left.  She came right when I was finishing, so that was good.  I'm gonna go down there for a few days this week, to visit, see her place, get away from here.......

Stutterfly show was great, couldn't go last night, can't go tonight, sucks....  I'm done

"event","I've been thinking a lot about this friend lately.  We go back quite a few years now, and yes, we have been a little more than just friends.  She's very odd, definately one of a kind, and we've always been close, which, considering some of our mutual aquaintances, has made some situations rather awkward.  I care about her very much, but I know her too well.  She uses me and takes advantage of my kindness and forgiving nature, so in the end I'm the one getting hurt.  She says I'm her best friend and that she doesn't want me to think ill of her, but how can I not when she just fucks with my head and my heart and ditches me all the time.  She's moving in a few weeks and she wants me to come and visit often and says she'll come visit me too, and I'd be all for it, if she weren't moving with a guy I know she slept with and am pretty sure she is still sleeping with.  AND, there is another guy she wants to move to the states for in the near future.  So, here I am, with this growing affection for a girl who is all over me one minute, all over some other guy the next, and planning to just leave for some other one.  How pathetic and desperate am I to be putting up with this?

Sometimes I think about how appealing severing ties with everyone I know here and just leaving is.  Just not tell anyone where I'm going, or even that I'm leaving.  It sounds so good, but would probably just cause a lot of problems.  I hate it here, but I'll most likely hate anywhere, just because I'm alone..."

Anyway, I have all of today off, so I'm gonna get some stuff done, then I'm gonna go jam with Rob when he gets off from work.  Nita gets back from Van today, so she'll probably call me, and Kevin gets off work at 6:30, so I'll have lot's of options for tonight, yay!  Monday I'll probably go to Portillo's, if someone want's to come with me, then Tuesday, I'll probably be going up to sun peaks with Kevin to pick up Ryan and his sister.  That should be fun.

School starts soon.  I'm am so very excited, mainly because I will be moving or travelling once I'm done.  It will be nice to get the hell away from here.  Who knows where I'll end up.....I don't, and that's exciting.

I know it sounds funny, but being down here at the coast, amidst all the crazy busyness, I feel oddly relaxed.  Maybe it's the being off and away from work for the weekend, but I think it's the atmosphere here.  Everything is so close at hand, and if it isn't, there's transit.  There is so much life here and Vancouver is so beautiful.  Even though it's the big city, you can still see the mountains and there is so much green everywhere.  This is definately where I want to be.  I wish I could just drop everything and move down here, but alas, I have commited myself to school in Kelowna.  I'd just call up Jacqui and say ""pack your stuff, we're moving to Vancouver!""  That would be great.  I wish some other friends would come here too.  Kevin won't, he hates the city.  Juanita said that she might want to come with us, but I don't know what her whole deal is yet, and for some reason, she doesn't seem like a city girl to me....

Well, I'm gonna take off and find something to do.  Marissa isn't calling me until around 11:00, and Brian is at work, so I think I'm gonna explore the Maple Ridge/Coquitlam area a bit, right after I go to Starbucks, hehe.

The drive down seemed like it took no time at all.  I don't even remember the part from Hope to Abbotsford.  We got a little lost, haha.  Marissa printed off directions from her house to Amy Jo's apartment from mapquest.com, so it was step by step from Vernon to Burnaby, haha.  If I had looked ahead and found the part about Lougheed highway, we would have been fine.  Oh well....  After we got there, we jumped on the skytrain and went into Van and wandered around granville and commercial for a while, then we went back to Amy Jo's and Marissa's brother came and picked her up.  I drove back out to Maple Ridge and now I'm just hanging out here until tomorrow, when we are all gonna go out to some comedy club.  Then Saturday, they are going out to the Michael Buble concert, which happens to be sold out, so I can't get a ticket.....oh, well....I'll figure something out....

Everything has been driving me crazy this last week.  Work has just been stupid (Marissa and I talked about that a lot on the way down).  I haven't seen Jacqui for a while, so I should take her out sometime next week.  Nel wants me to invite her to her barbeque on Thursday.  I hope she can come, but I should take her out for dinner and a movie or something.  I want to ask her out so bad, but even if she did say yes, it is probably not the best time, with both of us working two jobs, and me going back to school.  We wouldn't see each other much.  I don't know if that would put strain on the relationship or not, but I wouldn't want to risk it.  Man, I'm a loser.....

Everything is going well in Vernon.  I've been working a lot, so I haven't been home much.  I worked all last weekend, but I had Monday off, so I spent most of the day with Jacqui, she had her hair dyed and styled at Chatters.  It looks awesome.  I ran into Shyanne so much this week.  We've both been working all week, so I've seen her at work, and I keep running into her at Starbucks (she's a junkie, like me).  She has kinda toned down her annoyingness since I got mad at her for it.  She got all upset and now she's all sweet and nice to me, it's funny.  Monday night, Ryan and I went out to Rob's and rocked out.  It was so sweet.  Ryan tried to play the drums, haha.  Rob is an amazing bassist.  We had some pretty awesome riffs going.  Then we went out and ripped around on Rob's moped a bit, haha, that thing is so much fun.  I went out for some dinner with Nita last night.  She's kinda going through a huge change over in life right now.  It makes me kinda sad, but she's accepted everything and seems a lot happier for it (I'll go into detail later when it's all set).  After dinner, we went out to Marissa's to visit.  Nita went home cuz she had to work early, so Marissa and I drove around looking for people and something to do.  Vernon was pretty dead for a thursday night.  We ended up just driving around and talking for about an hour.  She showed me a picture of her friend Laura.  Wow, is she ever cute.  Can't wait for our trip to Van next week, haha.

Well, I should go get some stuff done.  I should be back in Armstrong on Wednesday to visit Melea and whatnaut, then Marissa and I are leaving early Thursday morning....yes!

I really want to go to Portillo's again.  It's so cool!  I wonder if the crew still goes on Mondays, if they are still around (Madison, Mason, John, Luke).

"event","well, this has been the best fucking weekend so far *sarcasm* !!!!  Here's how it's gone down....

Friday: only worked 5:30am to 9:30am, sweet, then I relaxed for the rest of the day, then I went out to meet Jacqui...Lala called and invited us to a movie at 9:30, but I didn't meet up with Jacqui until right around then (sorry Lala!)  We then sorted some work stuff out, and went driving to find her bosses house up towards silver star, because she was babysitting for her the next night.  We sat around there for a while, talking and stuff.  They are cool people!  We left there around midnight or so, drove their friend Josh home, then Jacqui took me back to my car.  We ended up just sitting in the parking lot talking for at least another hour, so I didn't get home until after 2am and I had to work at 5:30am (idiot, yeah.....)

Saturday: got a great hour and a half of sleep, then went to work at starbucks.  It was busy, so it kept me awake, then I came home and got another 2 hours of sleep before I had to go to work at Safeway at 3:30.  It was pretty busy and I only had help until 8:00, but Tanner and Matt worked their asses off to get stuff done for me.  I grabbed an Arush and skipped my last break, cuz if I stopped I probably would have passed out.  I'm done, so I drive back to Armstrong, looking forward to getting a good 5 hours of sleep or so, but in the back of my mind I was dreading what I knew I was going to be going home to.  That's right, with my parents being gone for the weekend, my shithead brother decides to have a party.  I get home and there are cars everywhere and a ton of people in my yard.  I was fucking pissed off (still am), so I called Kevin and he said I could crash on his couch.  I drove out there and then kinda half slept for about 3 hours.

Sunday: Kevin came home around 4am and I woke up, so I drove home, hoping there wouldn't be people at my house anymore (there wasn't....good thing too, because I probably would have been the biggest ass to everyone.  The only person I've seen so far is Thomas, and I think he got the message that I'm pretty angry) had a shower, and now I have to work from 8:00am, straight to 10:30pm.  At least I'm working with Jacqui from 5 to 9.....

The wedding was lots of fun, although, I really need to learn how to dance.  Jacqui was trying to teach my how to two-step, but I couldn't get it.  Then they were line dancing....haha, I got so lost.  It's not that I don't dance, I just don't know how (or maybe just can't, haha).  I'm willing, but trying to dance and making a fool of myself in front of the family of the girl I really like isn't too appealing......I'll have to take lessons or something.....

The next night, I went out with Marissa and just walked around Vernon, talking and people watching, then we met up with Leah and Mikey and sat at Denny's until midnight.....haha, they are all crazy......

I went and watched Kevin and Ryan play squash one afternoon.  I gave it a bit of a try and it seems like it would be a lot of fun, so living with them, I'll definately be getting into that.  (it'll keep me in shape, haha)

I'm working most of the long weekend here, but I'll be able to get out to the cabin to visit everyone on Monday, and I'm going out tonight.  Marissa was trying to get something together for tonight, so we all thought she had a plan, but she just called me and there isn't really one.  She's gonna call back if something's up.  Works for me, cuz I'm getting together with Jacqui when she gets off work at 8.  Maybe we'll do something with everyone, who knows.....

I then went to the movies with Jacqui.  We saw Mr. & Mrs. Smith.  It was really good, but the popcorn line was really long when we got there, we passed, so we were so hungry by the time the movie was over.  We went to Boston Pizza, haha.  mmmmm, that was really good too.  We sat there talking until midnight.  I found out a lot about her.....

I really like her, but all I'm getting is the usual ""just friends"" vibe from her.  It's alright, since I'm used to it, I'll just have to try my hardest not to mess up the friendship, because she is such an awesome person.  I've pretty much given up on having a relationship and being happy, since I'm such a ""good guy to have as a friend"".  Who wants to date a tiny little 100 lb. guy, right?  I'd be fine with everything if I didn't have so many great friends who are girls, who constantly tell me about their ex/current boyfriends, and the kind of guys they like, who happen to be everything I'm not.  I distinctly remember something Rhonda told me one time I had one of my many ""I hate myself"" episodes, ""girls usually like guys who are bigger"", is what she said.  I get girls who are smaller than I am laughing at me because I'm so tiny.  Now, who can have any hope of having a relationship and being happy through all that?

Alexisonfire, Hawthorne Heights, Relient K, Atreyu, Hopesfall, Senses Fail, Fall Out Boy, Billy Talent, Thrice, and Strung Out were all really good.  Transplants sucked so bad, ugh!

All in all, it was a good time.

The drive was pretty uneventful.  Got there, went straight to Starbucks, haha, then we went and picked up some alcohol, cuz Kevin and Brian wanted to drink.  Jacqui and I shared a 40 of Corona (so good!)  Kev and Brian were pretty hammered.  Then was the Show.
Jacqui and I were getting made fun of because we were talking about starbucks all the time, haha, we're silly.  Just being in Vancouver was so nice.  It made us want to move there right away.  We were getting all these ideas about what we were gonna do.....it was so much fun, I can't wait!

It would be fun, since she's a blast to be around, and she wants to set me up with her friend Laura from Vancouver, haha.  Interesting......

I have to stop at the bucks before work today, cuz it's partner appreciation day!!!  YAY!!  I get cake and a present!  And Jacqui is working ;)!!!  I hope she can come to warped.........  I'm gonna miss working with her when she transfers to Polson, but maybe it'll all work out, cuz then I'll be able to ask her out, haha.......if I can work up the courage to do it, of course....:-S.....

well, must do things......"

"event","today is my birthday, but I have to work.  I had last night off though, so i went out and had a bit of a quiet celebration.  Jacqui took me out for dinner at Boston Pizza, which was soooo good.  I haven't been there forever.....  Then we were gonna go to see Mr and Mrs. Smith, but we lost track of time talking at BP and missed the start of it.  So, we went and sat at BeanToCup for 2 hours so we could catch the late show, but when we got to the theater, there had been some kind of fire alarm, so it was closed.  We raced over and managed to catch the late movie at the Towne theater, which was Monster-In-Law, and it was pretty good.

Haha, I had so much fun with Jacqui.  She's hilarious.  In between the random conversations of porn, piercings, skinning dead animals and general craziness, we started making our plans for moving down to Vancouver.  All of this talking about it makes me want to go right now, but I need to do my course and get it done.  She says she can wait, since none of her friends want to go with her, and she'd rather go with a guy anyway.  Oh! she might come down to warped with me too, she just has to see if she can get the three days off.  Haha, Nel is not going to be happy with her, since she's already upset with her for transferring to the Polson store.  Oh it would be awesome if she came with us.

I should go, stuff to do...

"event","well, my birthday is gonna be pretty much nothing, since I have to work every day until I leave for Warped.  Oh well, it's just a day right? I'll be older, so what?  I don't want to drink, I have to work, meh.

Work this morning was interesting.  I opened with Christine, and she was all giddy and distracted, because Matt proposed last night.  It was hilarious.  She was breaking down into tears when she was telling me about it, and then she kept showing me the ring over and over. And she couldn't stop smiling, and she'd just randomly giggle, haha, I'm so happy for them.  They are a great couple.

"event","pretty cool day at work today.  Tanner and I had the same shift, so we took our breaks together and just chatted about music, and guitars, and recording...it was pretty killer.  Chatted with Kevin a bit too.  Sounds like they had a good trip, other than getting lost around Hope, haha, silly guy.  Yesterday, I went out to Kelowna to visit Ashley, since we haven't hung out forever.  It was nice.  We just sat on the couch and talked and watched tv for 7 hours!!!  holy crap!  and she made me dinner, which was awefully nice of her.  She has a super nice place too.  It's pretty cozy.  And the view!!!!  man!  I found another guy at work who's looking for a roommate.  It's cheap and it's close to work.  He says it's pretty nice.  The thing is, I don't know if I could stand seeing him at work and at home all the time.  He's an alright guy, he just tends to get a little annoying sometimes.....
Super stoked for the show on thursday and for warped.....2 weeks!!!!  and my birthday....next week!!!
It's been kind of an expensive week so far.....brake pads, $80, eye exam, $60, then the show, $15 plus merch, and renewing my driver's licence, $75.  But I get paid on thursday before the show, so I'll be okay....
I stopped in at my starbucks on the way home, and Mike, Marissa, Carol, and Nel were working.  Totally crazy!  I don't even know what Nel and Carol were talking about, but it was screwed up, then Marissa was showing up mike with her massive muscles....haha, so funny.
Well, I'm done for now

"event","so much stuff I need to do, so much I want to do, not enough time, not enough money.  I haven't seen anyone in ages.  I always seem to run into people when I'm working, since that's all I do.  I see Kevin at work all the time, no big deal, then I just run into people on my coffee break.  Like Nikki and Ashley the other day.  Haha, I stretched my coffee break out for like 45 minutes just chatting.  I'm going to visit Ashley in Kelowna on sunday, cuz I haven't seen her place yet, and I haven't hung out with her forever.  Then yesterday, on my break, Jacqui was just getting off work, so we just sat there and relaxed and Mike joined us, it was cool.  Man that guy likes to hear himself talk, haha.  Jacqui and I made a plan.  Once I'm done school, we're gonna move down to Vancouver together so she can go to the school she wants to go to.  Haha, that would be pretty cool, we'll see if it happens.

I keep getting invited out all the time, but I'm always working.  I want to hang out with Tanner and Matt sometime.  Marissa wants to take me out to kareoke and get me wasted so I can sing with her, haha.  And Jacqui invited me to come watch movies last night.  And I so want to go party with Nikki, cuz she's effing crazy.......I miss Lala, and Sha, and Kyla, and Dea.....

I must go to work"

"event","I talked to Tyler the other day.  Man, I miss him.  I sure hope he comes to visit soon.  Everything has been crazy and messed up lately, but I've been getting by, feeling horrible, but what can you do, when everything falls apart?  move on...

I had the day off, with a ton of stuff to do.  I paid my initial fee for school, went to walmart, then came home.  Then I had to go back to Vernon, cuz I was trying to figure out when I can go in for an eye exam, but I lost my schedule, so I had to go to work and write it down.  Good thing too, cuz I thought I had to work early tomorrow, but I don't.  Then I went into CD Plus.  The mall was dead and Emily was so bored, so I hung out with her for a while, then on her break, we walked around and chatted and wasted time in Coles.  Haha, she's such a cool, sweet girl.  Then we went back and chilled with justin, then I took off.  Now I'm just doing nothing, and I can't remember exactly when I work at safeway tomorrow.  Meh, I'll leave early, cuz I have to make my appointment, and maybe I'll have time to get my hair cut or something.

Don't know what's going on with warped, I'm excited, I always am.  Sounds like Kevin is for sure coming, sounds like Shaleen is not, and Lalaine and Dea are pending........whatever, I'm going, all that matters right now, but it would definately be more fun with everyone else....

"event","so, I slept about 12 hours last night.  Haven't done that in a very long time.  I didn't like it, but I probably needed it.  We all went down to the Anchor for lunch, and I said goodbye to all my relatives.  I hope I can catch up with Scott and Jordy when I go down for warped, but I probably won't have time, and they will probably be working.....boo!  Then I came home and did nothing all day.  It was nice, just listened to some tunes, mainly the new Hot Hot Heat, the new Avenged Sevenfold, the new Fall Out Boy, the new Finch, and of course, Ben Folds.  I have been so out of it with music lately, because I never get a chance to just listen to it.  I'd have to say that Say Hello To Sunshine by Finch is totally amazing and so unexpected.  I knew they were making a very different record, but wow!  The catchy riffs and awesome vocals are still there, but the guitar is very angular and the time signatures are really messed.  I'm rather disappointed with Elevators (jordy said I would be) and From Under The Cork Tree.  I'll have to give them some more time, so I can find the good qualities to them.  City Of Evil is just a good angry record, haha.  The new records by The Agony Scene and The Hurt Process are out, but I haven't been able to find them......I can't wait for the new As I Lay Dying and Funeral For A Friend records next week.  From what I've heard they will be awesome!  Okay, I'm done my music geek rant, damn I should really be saving this money I'm spending on cds, but it makes me happy.  I should really get my computer and mics and start messing around with them.  I wonder if Sara is coming back to work soon, I'd really like to talk to her.  Apparently her husband has a bunch of recording equipment and does some stuff on the side, so maybe he can teach me, haha. oh yeah! and Jen's uncle runs the Music Shoppe! hmmmmmmmmm......."

"event","I Went to Kevan's wedding today.  It was nice.  I got to see my cousins Scott and Jordy from the coast, which is awesome.  I came home early though, cuz I'm exhausted.

I really want school to start so I can spend my days doing something I like, instead of dealing with people all day at jobs I hate.  And I'm getting sick of commuting from armstrong to Vernon and back every day, but I guess it's my only option right now.  I've been thinking about quitting Starbucks, because Safeway will guarantee me 40 hours a week until I go back to school.  I probably won't though, because working this much is the only thing keeping me sane right now.  It's sapping everything out of me, which is good, because last night I kept getting this strong urge to get in my car and drive down to the coast and just get lost by myself for a few days, but I was much too tired to pull it off.  Not to mention the wedding........

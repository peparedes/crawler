"event","So, I haven't been journaling much lately, and I'd really like to get back in it- for my own sake. 
I'm beginning to enjoy learning. I figure it's wasted money if I don't actually LEARN anything throughout my years of college. I'm actually starting to study; not for good grades, but for pleasure. Weird, i know..
I also want to start a dream journal- they've been really interesting lately. I want to try and discern their meanings.
I'm reading The Question of God- it's interesting, I like it.
Im taking 18 credit hours only on Tues. and Thurs. I'm crazy.
Next semester I'm taking 22 credits. Ha...
I love Jared. I wish he wasn't in Gainesville and he was closer to me.
Although, distance is growing/stretching us.
I'm working on my quiet times; Really making them intimate and not about me and my needs. 
I just love other people. I want to pray for them- really really pray. And I want to be a good friend.
I'm working towards it.
The food here makes my stomach upset. EW.
I miss certain people in my life.
I miss people that were once an inspiration to me, they encouraged me, they played a huge role in who I am today.
I don't know where some of you went!!
:(

I love my family. 
Sam Cook turned 11 yesterday. He continues to surprise me with new stories every day.
David is the best older brother I could ask for.
My mom is beautiful and teaches me love and kindness and how to one day be a wonderful teacher.
My dad is the most faithful man I know. I couldn't have asked for a better earthly father.
Thank you Lord, for providing for me.
Your love never fails."

"event","alright, that was a bit dramatic.

i figured id correct it because i dont want people to think im crazy.

im just sad, thats all.
very sad. and upset that i hurt someone i love so much.

i really do have a wonderful and blessed life.
i think its good to be thankful for the struggles.
they have always made me who i am, even if they were hard to deal with at the time.
im really not a depressed person or anything. im usually very happy and content with how my life is.

just not right this second, or an hour ago.

thats all."

"event","so.. today has been, so far, too thoughtful.
i cant stop thinking.
i havent even gone to this website in at least a year..and i havent writtin in a year and a half. change is such a bitch. i wish it didnt happen so often. and when it stops happening, i complain. im sick of smart people, i think they know everything, and a lot of the time they do actually know a good portion. but theyre blind. i dont care if anyone responds to this,or even reads it. and i dont expect them to. im writing this for my own sake.

 im sorry for hurting you.. it hurts me. i wish i was better for you and i dont deserve you. my eyes are stinging and my head aches. im sick of crying. no, i am not depressed im just suffering from a broken heart, which i broke myself. im embarrassed by what ive done. it was stupid so so stupid. but the truth is im confused. i shouldnt be, because you are perfect, maybe thats why it makes it harder. i dont measure up. you are way too caring and nice and loving. i hate that saying "" we hurt the people we love the most."" i think its just an excuse. no excuses here. i suck, i made a mistake, i hurt you, and it hurts me, i shouldnt have done this, but i did, and i cant take it back, i wish i could, but im glad i told you, im sorry and i love you. you wont read this but i hope you forgive me. 

dont judge me because im being dramatic.
i act like i dont care, but i do. im sensitive and an emotional bitch.
so if you have rude thoughts, keep them to yourself please.
it will just hurt more.
yes, i realize that things will change and i will get over it sometime.

i hate myself."

"event","so truth is.
i dont know what im doing.
im confused.
my feelings are all over the place.
in almost every aspect of my life.
for one, i dont like boys.
i just dont,.they are stupid. and im done with them for a while.
secondly, being 17 is hard.
i feel too young for responsibilites
but at the same time i feel too old to be dealing with the high school crap for one more year.
i really dont like feeling inadequate.
i wish i was good at everything..and i dont even know why.
and im definitely not as responsible as i should be right now.
i just have so much going on!!
ah.
and not enough money.
im sure this is a bit scattered.
but who goes on livejournal to read this crap anyway?
im dying for something NEW and FRESH.
i often think im too lasy for the things i really want to do.
and maybe if they did come around id be too tired to take the offer.
whats my problem?
and i want new friends
i mean, i love my friends, really really, but i just need new people in my life.
people that dont know every little thing about me..
people that are just so fun!
where are you??
probably some place cool..where they always have something to do.
unlike here.
and i love brandon too.
but i cant ever find anyhting to do?
its weird.
i need a change..maybe hair?
probably not.
i want to re-decorate my room
once again..MONEY.
guuuuhhh.
im just thankful for music at these times in my life.
sillly me."

im confused on what to feel.
i dont want all of this anger and hurt to come back.
and i dont know why im letting this feeling creep into me again.
im just so mad.
why did i ever let myself do it?
and i know..it was all part of Gods plan and hes grown me through it so much.
but ive soon realized that this event has completely reshaped my life.
and ive never really thought about the severity its had in me.
and how it has affected me forever.
now, in a good way.
because in my weakness i became strong and overcame!
and the joy of the Lord is now my strength!
i hate the devil.
and how he tries to make me feel this way.
im beautiful and i can do awesome things through the power of God.

"event","my life has been quite eventful lately.
basically, i was very very sick all of january.
giving me way too much time to think.
but it was good.
it helped.
im still not all the way better.
my immune system is a big girl, thats for sure.
im starting to learn that most of the people i know, including myself, dont know a thing.
all we care about is clothes, money, cars, sex, drinking, drugs.
its sad.
we dont understand that outside of where we are, things arent so great.or maybe we do, and just dont care.
we try to figure God out for ourself, as if we are on the same leevl as him.
i wish we could just beleive, have faith that hes there, and hes doing things in peoples lives.
When people in Africa hear about this "" free gift of life, salvation, perfect love, joy, everything that Jesus brings..and its free""..they dont try to figure God out...they just receive and beleive.
for some of them ,its all they have to hold on to.
But we already have everything we need, dont we?
Our generation is okay with letting foreign governments kill children..they think that We, as the US, should give other governments the choice to take on a new form of goverment..
So, in some cases, basically, we can give them the choice to keep killing and destroying and hurting people.
We're content with losing, content with terrorism, content with killing babies, content with disease, content with watching the world waste away.
Im not going to be a part of that..I cant.
either way, God has been teaching me so much and speaking to me so much.
its hard to explain what hes been doing in my life.

this is very scattered..i know.
but heres something that has really been pumping me up and speaking to me lately..something powerful! read it..

SO THIS GUY COMES UP TO ME AND SAYS

WHAT'S
THE VISION ?
WHAT'S
THE BIG IDEA ?

I OPEN MY MOUTH AND THE WORDS COME OUT LIKE THIS

THE VISION ?
the vision is jesus
OBSEESSIVELY
dangerously undeniably
jesus

THE VISION IS AN 
ARMY
OF YOUNG PEOPLE.
you see bones ?
I SEE AN ARMY

AND THEY ARE FREE FROM MATERIALISM
THEY LAUGH AT 9-5 LITTLE PRISONS
THE COULD EAT CAVIAR ON MONDAY AND CRUST ON TUESDAY
THEY WOULDN'T EVEN NOTICE
THEY KNOW THE MEANING OF THE MATRIX
THE WAY THE WEST WAS WON.

THEY ARE MOBILE LIKE THE WIND.
THE BELONG TO THE NATIONS.
THEY NEED NO PASSPORT.
PEOPLE WRITE THEIR ADDRESSES IN PENCIL
AND WONDER AT THEIR STRANGE EXISTENCE.
THEY ARE FREE
YET THEY ARE SLAVES
OF THE HURTING AND DIRTY AND DYING.

WHAT IS THE VISION

THE VISION IS HOLINESS THAT HURTS THE EYES.
IT MAKES CHILDREN LAUGH AND ADULTS ANGRY.
IT GAVE UP THE GAME OF MINIMUM INTERGRITY
LONG AGO TO REACH FOR THE STARS.
IT SCORNS THE GOOD AND STRAINS FOR THE BEST
IT IS DANGEROUSLY PURE.

LIGHT FLICKERS
FROM EVERY SECRET MOTIVE.
EVERY PRIVATE CONVERSATION.
IT LOVES PEOPLE
AWAY FROM THEIR SUICIDE LEAPS,
THEIR SATAN GAMES.

THIS     IS     AN     ARMY
THAT WOULD LAY DOWN ITS
LIFE FOR THE CAUSE.
A MILLION TIMES A DAY
ITS SOLDIERS CHOOSE TO LOSE
THAT THEY MIGHT ONE DAY WIN THE GREAT
""WELL DONE"" OF FAITHFUL SONS AND DAUGHTERS.

Such heroes are as radical
on Monday morning as Sunday night.

THEY DON'T NEED FAME FROM NAMES.
INSTEAD THEY GRIN QUIETLY UPWARDS
AND HEAR THE CROWDS CHANTING AGAIN AND AGAIN:""COME ON!""

AND THIS IS THE SOUND OF THE
UNDERGROUND
THE WHISPER OF HISTORY IN THE MAKING
FOUNDATIONS SHAKING
REVOLUTIONARIES DREAMING ONCE AGAIN
MYSTERY IS SCHEMING IN WHISPERS.
CONSPIRACY IS BREATHING . . .
THIS IS
THE SOUND OF THE
UNDERGROUND

AND THE ARMY IS DISCIPL(IN)ED-
YOUNG PEOPLE WHO BEAT THEIR BODIES INTO SUBMISSION.
EVERY SOLDIER WOULD TAKE A BULLET FOR HIS COMRADE AT ARMS.
THE TATTOO ON THEIR BACK BOASTS
""FOR ME TO LIVE IS CHRIST AND TO DIE IS GAIN.""

Sacrifice fuels the fire
of victory in their upward eyes.
Winners.
Martyrs.
Who can stop them?
Can hormones hold them back?
Can failure succeed?
Can fear scare them or death kill them?

And the generation prays
like a dying man
with groans beyond talking
with warrior cries
sulphuric tears and
great barrow loads of laughter

Waiting. Watching.
24-7-365.

WHATEVER IS TAKES THEY WILL GIVE:
BREAKING THE RULES.
SHAKING MEDIOCRITY FROM ITS COZY
LITTE HIDE.
LAYING DOWN THEIR RIGHTS AND THEIR
PRECIOUS LITTLE WRONGS,
LAUGHING AT LABELS,
FASTING ESSENTIALS.
THE ADVERTISERS CANNOT MOLD THEM.
HOLLYWOOD CANNOT HOLD THEM.
PEER-PRESSURE IS POWERLESS
TO SHAKE THEIR RESOLVE
AT LATE-NIGHT PARTIES
BEFORE THE COCKEREL CRIES.

THEY ARE
incredibly cool,
dangerously attractive (on the inside).
On the outside ? They hardly care !
They wear clothes like costumes:
to communicate and celebrate
but never to hide.

WOULD THEY SURRENDER THEIR IMAGE OR THEIR POPULARITY?
THEY WOULD LAY DOWN THEIR VERY LIVES.
SWAP SEATS WITH THE MAN ON DEATH ROW, GUILTY AS HELL:
A THRONE FOR AN ELECTRIC CHAIR.

With blood and sweat and many tears,
with sleepless nights and fruitless days,
they pray as if it all depends on God
and lives as if it all depends on them.

Their DNA chooses Jesus
(He breathes out, they breathe in).
Their subconscious sings.
They had a blood transfusion with Jesus.

Their words make demons scream
in shopping malls.
Don't you hear them coming ?

HERALD the WEIRDOS !
Summon THE Losers and FREAKS.
HERE come the frightened &FORGOTTEN
With FIRE in their EYES
THEY WALK TALL and Trees APPLAUD,
Skyscrapers bow mountains are dwarfed
by the children of another dimension.

THEIR PRAYERS SUMMON THE HOUND OF HEAVEN
AND INVOKE THE ANCIENT DREAM OF EDEN.

AND THIS VISION WILL BE.
IT WILL COME TO PASS;
IT WILL COME EASILY;
IT WILL COME SOON.

How do I know ?
Because this is the longing of creation itself,
the groaning of the Spirit,
the very dream of God.

My tommorrow is His today
My distant hope is His 3-D.
And my feeble,
whispered,
faithless prayer
invokes a thunderous,
resounding,
bone-shaking
great ""Amen!""
from countless angels,
from heroes of the faith,
from Christ Himself.

And He is the original dreamer,
the ultimate winner.
Guaranteed.

-Pete Greig

but definitely needed.

im very grateful for the people in my life.
whether they realize the effect they have on me or not.
and they are all positive effects, of course.

"event","A long December,
And theres reason to believe
That this year will be better than the last.


So this year is almost over.
And theres not much to say about it.
Of course it had its ups and downs.
But if I could go back I wouldnt change one thing.
And I cant go back, so I guess it doesnt matter.

Im definitely excited about the New Year.
The day will change.
The number at the end of the year will change.
Maybe even the weather..but thats about it.

Last year I expected to wake up and feel like a different person.
To automatically follow through with the New Years resolutions I made the night before.
But nothing changed, everything was the same.

You cant expect to start over overnight.
Simply impossible.
I mean, who sticks to New Years resolutions anyway?
I figure you shouldnt make a promise, unless you can promise to keep it.
And I know I cant.

So this year Im not going to make lists of what to do better.
Or lists of promises I know I wont keep.
But instead follow through with the goals and promises Ive already made.
Some from previous New Years, and others from inspirations.

And the first promise I will follow through with..is to start my day with a smile!
(: 


Happy New Year, friends!"

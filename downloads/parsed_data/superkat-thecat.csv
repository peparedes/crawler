"event","<lj-cut text=yeah...>ok.  so work is slow and i've read a billion pages of my really good book, A Fine Balance.  It about life in India, centered around a few very different people and is just lovely.  ok, i'm done with my book club push of the day.  
oooOOOOOoooooOOOOO so i figured out that with my next paycheck, which should be a little over $400, i will be able to pay my mom back, get our barstools from ikea, and have my nails done, oh and buy food.  and then i should save some of it.  yes, definitely.  i feel accomplished.  Money is silly.  
today i opened work at 8 am, ar actually i was here at 7:50.  and i work till 3:30, but we have a staff meeting from 3:30-5, when the housing office closes.  i got to take an hour lunch, which consisted of me reading and occasionally answering phones when a rush of people came in.  i love working here, its great.  
Perri came in to say hi earlier.  it was good. after all the drama drama drama lately, i'm really trying to sort of start over, be her friend only and not fall into the place of her therapist/mom/etc.  i think it may be working, and that makes me really happy.  she may drive me absolutely up the wall sometimes, but she's my sister and i love her to death.  
I'm really bored and this is turning into a blasphemously (did is spell that right?) long entry.  oh well. 
I didn't give the middle earth housing tour today; i'm supposed to give the mesa court one if anyone shows up.  i'm kind of hoping they wont.  it looks icky outside, and mesa is the longest walk ever away and i'm kind of congested so it would be kind of a pain to give a tour, talking over the wind and answering people's stupid questions that would totally not be relevant if they just looked at the information we send them every 30 seconds.  oh well i'm sure i was an annoying incoming freshman myself.  heh.  
i'm really excited to be going home on friday.  I've totally missed my drama fam soooo much!  I hope i get to see everyone.  oh btw, i saw nick the other day.  he was up in the OC doing water safety and he came by my apartment.  it was good to joke around with him and make him feel inferiour.  ;-0  <--oh hey did y'all just see how i spelled inferior?  i spelt it the british-ish way i think. weird. people think i'm british sometimes, or if they ask where my name came from, they assume that i'm fresh off the boat or start speaking to me in Russian...slash hitting on me in polish...yeah there was this guy at the grocery store who randomly hit on me IN POLISH??!! um ok.  plus he was like 50.  so ew.  
ok so i definitely am not giving a tour today.  no one came.  but that's fine. 
ok i'm tired of typing all this babble, and i'm sure no one will read this in its entirity anyway.  
peace </lj-cut>"

"event","and I'm at work...woo!  yeah lunch break.  wow.  i really have nothing to say.  hmm...oh, it was really funny, when this morning, this customer came in and she's this soft spoken lady, and she's been in a whole bunch of times before, but she always glares at me...i uber dont get it.  but yeah, she glared at me again this morning.  it was whack.  and kind of amusing.  the most amusing part of my day i guess.  
I might be coming back home next weekend.  but only for a very little while.  like friday night, because jacob said he'd have a party for me.  we'll see if he follows through ;).  but its my friend DT's 21st birthday on saturday, so of course I have to be home for that.  so, for good measure, we'll say i'll be home friday night and saturday until the early afternoon. ok.
I work all week long.  but that's good.  it equals mucho money.  oh yeah.  I might have to give a housing tour in a half and hour.  I'm kind of nervous, but they're really fun.  I get to make up funny stories that sort of but not really happened so people like the housing.  the kids kind of roll their eyes but the parents chuckle.  haha.  
zain's supposed to move out today. I'm kind of sad.  Its like we're getting a divorce, on amicable terms.  or having a separation, lol.  oh marriage.  haha.  
um, ok, i should try to do real work, even though its so slow.  ok, time to practice walking backwards!  woot!"

Well Zain has come back from NorCal, so I can resume my married life down here in Irvine.  Things are good, if slightly boring, but it is better than most.  I work incessantly it seems, yet I enjoy it, so much better than the bookstore.  I have no real purpose for posting this entry.  So maybe I'm done.

Basically a brain numbing distraction for everyone, and an attraction for the guys.  except they just eat and play video games.  so i'm not really sure what it all accomplishes.  but whatever.  yeah, i really haven't been doing the studying thing for finals.  everyone in my house was done on tuesday, and now everyone is here.  my house is like Friends.  no one knocks, everyone eats everything, we leave people here alone all the time.  its pretty entertainig, really.  except when i have to study.  like now.  except i'm totally not into it.  ahhhhhhhhh.  yeah.  and LJ is just another way for me to distract myself when i actually am in my room trying to study.

Well, guess who finally took the initiative to find out where our freakin' mailbox at the apartment is?? And its a good thing I did, because we already have bills past due...nice way to start living in a new residence, hmmm?  I'm totally freaking out, I was doing brilliantly with making sure everything got paid on time, but I didn't realize that the security deposits would be on separate bills.  due 19 days after you call in to initiate service.  In other words, late late late.  and now hopefully not screwed screwed screwed.  Sometimes I really hate money.  And besides bills, I have other things to buy.  IE pay for my dry cleaning, my lil sis' family bear, a halogen bulb for my lamp, FOOD.  Parents are not going to be happy.  And I really want to make real breakfast, not just cereal, but Zain and I slept on the futon last night, and he's still asleep out there.  I should either go back to sleep for a bit, or go study.  Hmm...I wonder which is the more appealing of the two?"

"event","Um, so another LJ post when i should be doing homework.  Everything is...chill.  Surprisingly.  Moving into the apartment in 6 days, that rocks.  Outta the dorms, thank goodness.  It was nice but I'm ready to have my own place.  Parents miss me too much.  You'd think I hadn't been home in years.  Memories make me miss home though.  Diving into my freezing pool on hot summer days, lying on the couch with my dad watching movies, doing laundry with my mom.  The dogs barely remember me when I do come home.  Kinda sad.  But such is growing up I guess.  ha.  Except that I feel like I'm twelve, b/c of this ridiculous crush on a boy.  I get all silly and giddy about him...honestly what's come over me? lol.  :)  Kind of fun though, lightens up the frantic collegite life a bit. Got my Lil Sis Emily her letters.  She looks adorable in them, I'm so lucky to have her as my lil.  Yeah that sounds corny.  Irene and Alex are lying all cute Midsummer style on her bed.  awwww.  don't you want somebody to love.  yes yes i do.  I found a card in my desk that was for Ryan's birthday, made me kinda sad and nostalgic.  Annoying that once you love someone those feelings never really disappear, even if they do fade.  Spent too much money this month...cant wait till the first when I get more.  But then I have start paying bills...yiiikes.  Rent, gas, electric, internet...well mommy and daddy still pay for that, but its my responsibility to get it in on time.  oooo responsibilities.  Too many sometimes.  whhheeee alpha phi undefeated softball 2nite.  yay!  ok time to go"

But not.  Whatever.
Last night was the Original Alpha Phi Campuswide BBQ, and Darshan stopped by...and he saw me talking to Army (check out those guns! ;) hahah) and apparently I was doing the prepostorous thing of <i>flirting</i> with him, so Darshan felt the need to put his arm possessively around me...ummm...ps, he's <b>still</b> not my (official) boyfriend, so that was awkward.  So finally I just said, if you want those kind of privilages, find an exclusive relationship!  So there.  Ha, he was so jealous, and even admitted to surprising himself in that he was jealous.  And thus continued to latch onto me the rest of the night.  Good God.  

So much for National Get Your Ass In Gear Day...I'm just going to be a total flake for the rest of my life and never graduate and drop out and work at In N Out across the street while I watch all my friends accomplish great things and feel sorry for myself and still spend all my money at Starbucks like I'm a yuppy with a great job that is so demanding and I can't do anything without my halfcafnonfatsoymilkwhitechocolatemochaextraesspressoandashotofraspberry glued to my hand."

J/K!!!!!
Sumber party with a few of the sistahs last night.  It was interesting...we talked about a lot of things and ideas we have in common but hadn't realized it.  It was, though we discussed a possible non appreciation of the current sisterhood (um, did that make sense?), very sisterhood-ish.  yay! 
The heat is becoming unbearable.  I feel like I'm melting.  And it makes me worried about fires, and burning, and yiiiikes.  But on the other hand, it makes me really happy about the beach, and my pool, and the summer.  Oh man, soooooo excited about the summer!!!!  Moving into my apartment (in early July!), going climbing, hopefully my friends will come visit me and we can go to the beach...(hint hint!)  That goes for everybody!  Woo woo, partay at my place!  Pleeeeaaaase come visit and don't leave me all alone with all the rich OC yuppies!!!  Haha not that I'm not turning into a yuppy myself, if a poor version of one...I looked in my wallet yesterday, and all, yes, ALL, my receipts were from various coffeehouses.  
Oh Elana...yeah, I totally have freshman senioritis too.  Its kind of...endoftheyearandreadytogohomeitis...or something!  (Hence the holiday....)  Yeah!  

Ok, time to get ready for a lecture and then a job interview...peace out!"

my parents are cool when i don't see them a lot.  my dad bought me fruit and granola bars and made me fresh squeezed orange juice and changed the oil in my car.  my mom bought me two tank tops and listened to my blithering conversations about everything and nothing.

ok i need to study.  if i don't get a good grade on this test i'm going to be pissed.  seriously, its biology for non-bio majors, so the information is as elementary as it gets.  haha, i say this now; watch, i'm going to get a C or something...knock on wood

*knock knock*

yup that's me knocking on wood.  now everybody!

"event","My uncle died today.  He had cancer and he decided he didn't want his family to see him waste away slowly, so he had an injection at 2:00 Holland time today.  He is survived by his wife and their two adopted children, my cousins.  Arjan, my cousin, told his father he would look out for his mother and sister.  Carmen, who is younger, was very angry.  I wish I knew her well enough to call her and cry with her, because I know that no words can ease the pain.  
I know that is very depressing but he was a wonderful man and his even to his death he was looking out for the emotional wellbeing of his family.  He deserves to be mentioned.  

<lj-cut text=""I hope the rest of this entry doesn't trivialize his death..."">

I am worried that I may have breast cancer.  And no, I'm not trying to be overdramatic, but I did notice a physically painful abnormality today.  I'm going to make an appointment with my doctor tomorrow.  
I should be doing a lot of homework right now, but my essay topic sucks so I'm not into it.  I need to do it though.
My hair is really straight, pretty cute.  My sister and future housemate Rachael did it for me, because I am incompetent when it comes to wielding a straightening iron.  
I'm going home tomorrow night.  I'll see my ""lil bro"" and then go home-home.  I'm kind of looking forward to it, mostly the food.  But I'll be studying too, because I have a Bio midterm on Thursday.  It shouldn't be that hard, its Biology for non-majors, and since I was planning to be a Bio major anyway, I already know a lot of the information.  I want to do really well this quarter.  My Bio class and Art History class should be cake, and Humanities lecture is just going to lecture and studying the material.  I'm really proud that I haven't missed a single class at all this quarter, and I don't intend to either.  Humanities writing might kick my ass though...eeeeee.  60% of our grade is based on a research paper that we have almost no guidlines for--basically, its ""pick a topic and write a coherent paper showing you put time and effort into researching.""  Oh, and the topic has to relate to the Cold War/Red Scare and related topics.  I think I'm going to look into some art aspects, and maybe write an Art History paper.  I should enjoy that more than researching Senator McCarthy and such.</lj-cut>

I feel pretty good, but I need a cuddle.  Any takers??"

I'm sunburnt.  Meh.
Just in case anyone didn't know, the higher you go up on a mountain, the closer you are to the rays of violent sun beating down upon your skin.  But I'm sure you are all clever and already knew that.  

So camping and climbing this weekend was both good and bad.  
I flashed a slabby 5.6.  That was good.  Darshan made me cry.  That was bad.  I saw gorgeous views and nature all weekend.  Good.  I didn't sleep at all because my feet were frozen.  Bad.  Darshan kissed me goodbye.  That was an improvment.  
I think, all in all, the excursion to Joshua Tree was worth it.  It ended on a bit of an uncomfortable note, but that will be forgotton eventually.  Next time I'll crack climb and show Darshan up.  Hmmph.  

I want to go running around Aldrich Park and blow bubbles and lie on the grass and look up at the sky through the trees and spin in circles till I get dizzy and laugh and be in the sun.  



I want that all right now."

I'm so tired right now. I had a stay over guest, a high school senior that is looking into UCI comes and stays the night here.  She was very inquisitive and asked lots of questions that required staying up late to finish answering.  Hence the tiredness.  I need to get PUMPED! word.  For the NOFX/Alkaline Trio concert I'm going to tonight.  I'm going with a guy who cheated on his ex g/f with me (sort of, he just kissed me) then fell off the face of the earth, found another g/f, and now wants to hang out.  Do I sense a pattern here?? yes, yes i do.  why do i always get stuck with the weird ones??  

k--more later, this time i promise.  sort of."

"event","my wonderful day which was yesterday:
spent the night at matty's after his birthday b/c i fell asleep listening to the mix i made for him.  ps he really liked it too.
came back to my dorm.
dawdled on my computer.
jen called to tell me they were almost here.  frantically got into an ice cold freezing shower, cursing the damn school and their lack of hot water.
got ready (sort of), then dashed downstairs just in time to meet them.
went to the orange county museum of art with jaclyn, jen, and jen's mom.  
the main exhibit was called from picasso to pollock...there were a billion picassos and only one pollock in the whole museum.  humm.
fashion island for lunch.  
jen finally visited my dorm.  it was a mess.  
sorted laundry.
went rock climbing with darshan at <a href= ""http://www.rockreation.com/cm/home.htm"">rockreation</a>.  the most wonderful experience of my life.
<b>i'm addicited to rock climbing</b>
darshan was really impressed with my abilities on my first climbing experience.  i was too.  
i bouldered (climbing shorter distances with no ropes) for a little while till my arms decided they weren't going to help out anymore, and then i top roped a 5-7 and made it up 3/4 of the way on a 5-8.  darshan climbed a 5-10b this weekend.  yay!
so i'm obsessed.  
we had dinner.  hung out.  he drove me home.  i was giddy with rock climbing excitement until the tiredness hit me and i crashed.  
wonderful day."

"event","Its so weird how I can go for months being so annoyed and upset with someone and then miss them horribly, only to find he has a girlfriend.  Yes, I'm talking about Ryan, and NO, I don't want him back.  I get this urge to call him sometimes, just to say hi, which I'm sure is not healthy, but the girlfriend thing is a little daunting.  It makes everything seem so final, that things have changed so far that even if I try to look back, the step behind me has disappeared and the only place to go is forward.  Without him.  Which is good.  For the most part.  I think.  But I do think that he should be wallowing in misery about the pain and suffering he put me through, and missing me.  And Jared ""met someone."" But we were never really dating, whatever we were doing, it didn't really count.  haha.  I find all of this highly amusing all of a sudden.  I think its the fact that I've been at work all freakin day long; my mind is absolutely numb.  
I'm going to make a mix for Matty's birthday.  He's 22, and does not have good music.  Or rather, doesn't have music that I like to listen to when he drives me somewhere.  Yay mix making!  Onward!"

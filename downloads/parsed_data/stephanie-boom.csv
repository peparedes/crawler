"event","im sure some would consider today a waste but to me it was pretty fun
all i did was relax in my pajamas and watch tv
it was nice to stay home for once
lately ive just been going out every single night
driving around with people and doing nothing
after relaxing from the time i woke up till after i dinner, i stopped by the strip and picked up a few cds and some clothes
nothing to exciting"

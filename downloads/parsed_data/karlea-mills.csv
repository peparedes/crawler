"event","It's funny the way life works, my past has not prepared me for the future, in fact sometimes I wonder if it has hindered me more than it should have.  Growing up I was tutored by one of the masters and he told me my gift was too strong, told me that I should never marry or have children as my powers would be increased in any children born.  So I have spent my life hiding from relationships and really hiding from the world.

In this time, there are so few people with abilities, so few that can actually tap into them that realistically any offspring I had would not necessarily have my gift let alone a stronger one.  I've never allowed myself to love, always too afraid of what it could mean.  The bonding of the soul is nothing like what is marriage in this age.  Once the soul bonds with another the connection is so deep that if something happens to the other half you know instantly.  It's not a piece of paper, it's not a promise, it's a connection so deep and right that neither soul is more dominant than the other, neither soul seeks anything else for it has found it's twin and it's home.

I know I will not find that bond here, I'm not looking for it."

It's easy if you try,
No hell below us,
Above us only sky,
Imagine all the people
living for today...</i>

I believe there is no heaven, no hell.  I believe in reincarnation, in the development of the soul and of life beyond what we comprehend as life once the soul has finished what it set out to do.  You do need to live for today, live every moment of every day as if it is your last.  Time is short, not just life but time itself.

<i>Imagine there's no countries,
It isnt hard to do,
Nothing to kill or die for,
No religion too,
Imagine all the people
living life in peace...</i>

I don't need to imagine a world without racial or territorial boundries, I lived there.  Religion is not that what you practice now, it is different.  Killing still occurs though as does dying, but for different reasons, crime is not wiped out, unfortunately humans are human and no one is perfect.  Evil is something human kind is plagued with, but a concious educated mind does not contemplate it.  Peace is a different level of brotherhood.

<i>Imagine no possesions,
I wonder if you can,
No need for greed or hunger,
A brotherhood of man,
Imagine all the people
Sharing all the world...</i>

Hunger is a thing of the past, greed exists still, but not in the quantity it does now.  People always want so possesions are still important.  However the world is shared, people co-exist in peace, religious wars no longer happen.

<i>You may say Im a dreamer,
but Im not the only one,
I hope some day you'll join us,
And the world will live as one.</i>

Dreaming ... Dreamer ... Perhaps deep down even today this is what every person on the planet really wants.  They just don't know how to get it."

"event","It amuses me at times how in this time the moon is uninhabited.  We out grew the planet many many years ago in my time and both the Moon and Mars are now lived on.  The Moon is such a beautiful place, at times I yearn for it.  There is nothing like sitting back at watching your planet in the distance, Blues, Browns, Greens and White circling it.  It makes you realise just how small it really is.  When the last of the rainforests became protected, there was no where else to go but up.  Disease and poverty a thing of the past, I watch the television some times and I see the poor children of Africa and my heart breaks, in my time Africa is a beautiful country, populated by many with beautiful cities and open plains where the animals still run free.  People enbraced nature and learnt to live with it, not work against it.  We had to.  The world was dying.

Mars, I never visited, I did see pictures and postcards.  The atmosphere was developed long before my time and from the Moon Mars looks like a very small version of Earth, just red and green instead of brown and green.  

There are times I believe perhaps my life before was all a dream, but the ormanx I carry on my forehead reminds me daily that I am not from this time, that is why I wear it proudly."

"event","<font size=""-2""><i>No matter what they tell us
No matter what they do
No matter what they teach us
What we believe is true</i></font>

Sometimes when I sit back and remember, I find the hardest things to deal with are the things I was taught before I came to this time.  When I started school here, in this time, I was unable to understand why things were so backwards from everything I had been taught.  In school they taught things that made little sense to me.  Things that in my time we were taught early on in our childhood, but we were also taught that life is not always rational and that sometimes belief is far more powerful than anything else.  The mind is a powerful tool, something you haven't learnt yet in this time.

<font size=""-2""><i>No matter what they call us
However they attack
No matter where they take us
We'll find our own way back</i></font>

I was called freak, strange, wierd, stupid, insane - just to list a few - growing up because I was so different from all the other children in my class.  I thought differently, spoke a little strangely, loved rocks.  I hated it here.  I wanted to go home, I dreamt about it.  Dreamt that my father would come and bring us home and that everything would be back to ""normal"".  It didn't happen and I had to find my own way in this time.

<font size=""-2""><i>I can't deny what I believe
I can't be what I'm not
I know I'll love forever
I know, no matter what</i></font>

I can't deny who I am.  It wouldn't be right.  I can't run from my past or avoid my future.  I'm just me, a little different from what many people are used to.  I feel differently from others.  I am afraid to love.  Afraid of what that might mean.  In my time when you found your soul partner, it was forever.  In your time, people can't see, don't want to see that love is forever.  That the soul mates for all time and although there are lifetimes where the twin souls are too blind to see when they finally meet it is forever.

<font size=""-2""><i><i>If only tears were laughter
If only night was day
If only prayers were answered
Then we would hear God say</i></i></font>

There are nights when I walk just so that the tears that fall remain unseen, I want to laugh, I want to ... be happy with the life I have been given.  But in the harsh light of day ... it's so hard to imagine that this time is where I am supposed to be, for what ever reason destiny picked this time, this here and now... but I also know that not everything is as it seems and not everything can be explained rationally.  Sometimes the road chosen is the road that needs to be travelled and just when everything seems so wrong and you want to curse that higher being... your eyes are opened to the truth and you realise maybe... just maybe this was exactly where you were supposed to be.

<font size=""-2""><i>No matter what they tell you
No matter what they do
No matter what they teach you
What you believe is true</i></font>

<font size=""-2""><i>And I will keep you safe and strong
And sheltered from the storm
No matter where it's barren
A dream is being born</i></font>

Sometimes I long to be held.  A deep painful yearning for something I am so afraid of.  I look around me and I see people, people who have been hurt who are willing to try again.  Willing to open up even though they know the pain of loss because the dream of loving and being loved in return is worth the pain if it goes wrong.  

<font size=""-2""><i>No matter who they follow
No matter where they lead
No matter how they judge us
I'll be everyone you need</i></font>

Judgement is so prevailent here, people don't take the time to stop and get to know the person inside.  They take things at face value, they say things that hurt deeply because they don't, can't understand.  People think they know everything, that they are right and that others should be like they are.  They don't open their minds to the possibility that being unique is everything.  We all need to be needed and sometimes ... all you want is for someone to need you as much as you need them.

<font size=""-2""><i>No matter if the sun don't shine
Or if the skies are blue
No matter what the end is
My life began with you</i></font>

The path my life has taken has never been easy.  There have been times I have wished for an easier life, a life that is sunny and bright with endless beauty.  Truth is life is never like that, and if we don't experience the dark days, the storms that hit and make us stronger, we don't grow, we don't change and we don't learn.  In a way coming here to this time, to Eden, was like a new beginning to my life.  But I am still afraid, and I don't want to be afraid anymore.  I don't want to have to hide the way I feel, to shut myself off from the way other people around me feel.  I just don't want to feel the pain that comes with living.

<font size=""-2""><i>I can't deny what I believe
I can't be what I'm not
I know, I know
I know this love's forever
That's all that matters now
No matter what</i></font> 

No matter what...."

"event","I realised today that I probably am missing out on a lot being who I am.  But I can't change who I am.  The stones are cold tonight, not one will share it's warmth and I want to crawl into a ball and block out the rest of the world.   I don't want to fight the voices I don't want to have to protect myself from them.  I want to be able to feel without feeling what the people around me are feeling.  I want to let the wall down.  <small>I'm just too afraid to</small>

I remember when I was little I was stubborn, I refused to believe my mother when she said other peoples thoughts could hurt me.  I went out, went to school prepared to hear everything around me.  Within an hour I was huddled in the girls toilets crying trying to keep their voices out, pain, anger, loneliness they flooded every inch of my brain.  I couldn't see, I couldn't feel I was trapped so deep did the voices reach I couldn't gather the strength to fight them off, to close them off.  So I sat, alone, crying.

I'm afraid now.  I ... I want to feel but the memory of the pain of the inability to close everyone out tears me apart.  I. just. want. to. be. like. everyone. else.  but I'm not and I never will be.

I used to dream of a man on a white horse who would save me, rescue me from myself.  I'm 25 years old, he's not coming.  I have come to terms with that.  My mother hasn't.  I have nothing to give anymore, nothing of myself to give.  All I have is what I hold dear, my stones and my thoughts."

"event","Firstly a question of sexuality... It is the soul that bonds in each life time, not the mind, not the heart definately not what sex you are... We do not get to choose if we come back male or female, we don't get to choose what our twin soul comes back as, nor what sex those of kindred spirit maybe.  What we do choose is whether we are prepared to open our hearts, our minds and ourselves to the true happiness our twin soul brings.  That connection goes beyond sexuality.

Life in general is about tough choices, what would the ocean be without the waves to stir the shores and lap gently at them?   A persons character should never be judged before you are exposed to the beauty of their soul, in this time I fear judgement is stronger than my time.

Past lives... Look at the beach, each grain of sand is different from the next yet together they create the beach as we know it.   Each lifetime brings with it new life experiences that build up and make that beach, but sometimes part of the beach is consumed by the sea and we don't have access to that area.  We keep coming back until our beach is full of sand and we have learnt all the lessons life wishes us to.  Some of us are just starting out... others have been here for centuries.  We all bring something unique to the world we live in.

The right stone for you will sense your presence and will be slightly warmer to the touch.  That is the stone that is right for you, the stone that will gift you will the balance you need in the area it can help with."

"event","Sometimes I feel so old, well beyond my years.  I think it has to do with my past and the fact that my mother has lived in my head for so long.  Last night she came to me again, wanting to see if my life here is everything I was hoping it would be.  I tried to block her, but there are times when she just reaches right in.

She called, frightened by how much I have opened myself up.  It's dangerous to talk about the past, I don't need reminding of that.  Sometimes I sit and wish that it was all a bad dream, that I'm just a normal person... 

I learnt tarot from an old lady who lived in our town, the kids said she was a witch but she was always kind to me, willing to teach.  I learnt about herbs and oils from her, sometimes she would open her book of shadows and share things with me.  I never wanted to learn about spells, that is not who I am.  Tarot however is facinating, the cards when read properly can help to navigate you to where the person you are reading wants to go.

As for the herbs, mother nature is very amusing at times, she can produce things that are amazing sometimes and not just sunsets and sunrises and beautiful surroundings, sometimes the things she produces are just as beautiful.

But my passion is my stones.  I learnt to clean auras and chakras because the stones wanted a way to unleash their power.  To my teacher I will always be grateful."

In my time what I am, what I feel, is not something people view as different.  There are many like me, all with different degree's of skill.  I started my training at a young age, I... I had a gift that even in my time was considered rare.  When we moved here, I was already talking to the crystals and the stones.

Everything on this planet produces some kind of energy, even things we all view as inanimate.  Stones and Crystals produce an energy that is uniquely there own even if their composition is the same.  That energy can tune in to an animates life force and strengthen their aura, their energy.  A stone used by the right person, for the right purpose can give to that person something that is needed to help them along.

I know there are skeptics, people who think I am strange, weird and they are afraid.  I understand.

I... I mentioned that even in my time I was concidered different."

She's talking to my father, this I know and I am frighten the desperation in her voice washes over me.  I hear the faint ""woosh"" of the air cars as they pass over the house.  I strain to hear if my father is home.  Nothing, just my mother sobbing.

I walk to the stairs and sit beside her putting my hand in hers, she pulls me close and kisses the top of my head.  ""Oh Karlea, what are we going to do?"" she chants over and over between sobs.  The sobs are wracking her body and I feel each wave as it passes her lips.

We sit there for a long time then she takes me by the hand, ""Come little Princess"" she says as she leads me down the stairs.  On the bench top to the far left there is a silver coloured box she opens it pressing buttons I hear the buttons and a faint wirring sound.

I feel a kiss on my forhead, my mothers lips.  I smiles.  She whispers ""Sleep baby, sleep, soon..""  her voice drifts off as the darkness takes me.

In my time, there were no diseases, they had been erradicated.  Cancer that was a thing of the past as was leukemia and all the other diseases born of defective cells, Aids, STD's they didn't exist.  I think the problem was that our society was a germ free society.  Everything was so sterile.  

The scientist grew restless though in my time, and after erradicating the diseases they decided that they wanted to study the organisms closely, find out why they were so prevalent in the past and pick them apart if you will.

A lab technician in Philadelphia was clumsey, he dropped a vile of smallpox, within days much of Philadelphia was suffering and slowly it spread.  We had no vaccine, no need for it you see, or so we thought.  Stupid, people of my time tended to believe that they were invincible I think.  But one small virus showed them they weren't.  

By the time my father contracted the disease, it had mutated, had become aggressive, he feared coming home in case he passed it to us.  He had books he had written in the lowerlevel of the house a machine he explained the details to my mother over the phone.  To bend time, to flee a world that was dying.

There are days I wish for the night, then when she arrives wrapped in her moon light robes I don't know whether to run and hide or bask in her glory.

The day started with a call, I wasn't sure if I should answer.  I sensed my mother, and shame washed over me.  It isn't or rather wasn't that I didn't want to talk to her.  More a case of uncertainty as to what questions she would ask of me, how to avoid her maternal prying into my life.  I answered.  She asked.  I avoided.  Yet a nawing feeling of unease has settled over me.  I don't lie well, I hate to lie, so all I can do is avoid.  She sensed that.  She senses much of what goes on around me, there are times I feel her gentle probing in my head.  I block her.  She calls.  It's a vicious circle.

I was born with the ability to read people, to hear their thoughts, unfortunately this leaves me open to the probing of like minds.  A dangerous past time.  Over the last 25 years I have gained skills that help me to block the voices of those around me, to block those who wish to hear my inner voice, my inner thoughts.  It drains me."

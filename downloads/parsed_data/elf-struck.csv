"event","Feeling utterly helpless tonight for some strange reason. I usually pass from one mood to another within spans of days. 

Tonight was diffrent

 I think I was inspired by someone and thier words. I would tell you what they were...but I think I'll be selfish tonight.
<sigh> Since I'm feeling inspired, I might as well go try and write something. Perhaps the writer's block has cleared. <prays>

Anyway, This was a weird entry that fits my mood perfectly. 
Love all,
Lauren"

"event","Leaving AGAIN! To go workith my behind off. O well quick runthrough of my day yesterday. I bought the Spiderman 2 sounndtrack WHICH ROCKS!!!!! (Availible now in a store near you hehe) 

I also went to see Shrek 2 which also ROCKS!!! I love that movie. ""Pray for mercy from...Puss in boots!"" Woo Hoo anyway you can catch me on my cell and if I don't answer I'm at work. 

I am including a little lesson for today also:

The Donkey

One day a farmer's donkey fell down into a well. The animal cried piteously 
for hours as the farmer tried to figure out what to do.

Finally, he decided the animal was old, and the well needed to be covered up 
anyway; it just wasn't worth it to retrieve the donkey.

He invited all his neighbors to come over and help him. They all grabbed a 
shovel and began to shovel dirt into the well.

At first, the donkey didn't realize what was happening and cried horribly. 
Then, to everyone's amazement he quieted down.

A few shovel loads later, the farmer finally looked down the well. He was 
astonished at what he saw. With each shovel of dirt that hit his back, the 
donkey was doing something amazing. He would shake it off and take a step 
up.

As the farmer's neighbors continued to shovel dirt on top of the animal, he 
would shake it off and take a step up.

Pretty soon, everyone was amazed as the donkey stepped up over the edge of 
the well and happily trotted off!

Life is going to shovel dirt on you, all kinds of dirt. The trick to

Getting out of the well is to shake it off and take a step up.

Each of our troubles is a steppingstone.

We can get out of the deepest wells just by not stopping, never giving up!

Shake it off and take a step up.

Remember the five simple rules to be happy:

1. Free your heart from hatred - Forgive.

2. Free your mind from worries - Most never happen.

3. Live simply and appreciate what you have.

4. Give more.

5. Expect less

NOW --------

Enough of that crap . . .

The donkey later came back and bit the shit out of the farmer who had

tried to bury him.

The gash from the bite got infected, and the farmer eventually died in

agony from septic shock.

MORAL FROM TODAY'S LESSON:

When you do something wrong and try to cover your ass, it always comes back 
to bite you 

Love, Skumz"

"event","You know what's absolutley disgusting about summer? THERE IS NOTHING TO DO! Well at least at my house anyway. Holmesy called me to go to the pool with her and all my clothes are at the beach including my bathing suit. 

Oh Joy.

Well now for an update on my day. I went to Padua this morning with my mother to talk to Mrs. Mooney. For those who didn't know I was going to be moved down to level 3 algebra 2 because I missed a C by 1 point...Grrrr! Anyway my mom waived me into Level 2 and bought me tons of math crap to keep me occupied. 

Oh Rapture.

My brother won't relinquish the TV to me so I can play XBOX so I think I might go pummel him and if that doesn't work I can always call in reinforcements aka my father.

So yes anyway I will be heading down to the beach tomorrow afternoon I think. If anyone needs me call the cell and if you don't reach me leave a message cause that means I'm at work woohoo! 

Cheers! Wuv, Lauren/Skummerz"

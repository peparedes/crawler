"event","Went to the Hamilton Hauntings thing tonight with Leonnnn... :D it was fun. And we both screamed. They chased me with a chainsaw. Not cool. Will have nightmares now. Both very frightened. Definitely NOT cool. But I loved it anyway and it was most obviously ;-] highly entertaining. Went to Fezziwig's afterwards and got apple crisp mmmm. Delish.

Lost the football game today. Was actually quite fun regardless because it started raining during halftime and the Wunschii let us just hang out on the bus for the third and fourth quarters because it was cold and wet and we didn't want to ruin the uniforms, but weren't allowed to leave because the flags were sharing a bus with the cheerleaders even though they were both BAND ONLY buses and the cheerleaders forgot to get their own. Hmph I'll keep my thoughts on that to myself, because I don't want to offend the cheerleaders that I DO happen to like. Leon and Ruchi and Melissa and I were having fun talking and, well, making fun of people. (Hard to be a leader around those three, I swear, but they're just SO MUCH FUN.) Jess and Jennie and Shrubby and Crystal joined in on the fun and it was just a happy group of laughs and yay.

in all, 'twas quite a FUN and WONDERFUL day. :)

"event","So. Been busy.

Friday went to lunch and the movies with my favorite :D, Leon. Ate at Federici's, yum. Saw Napoleon Dynamite, so hilarious I nearly peed my pants, man! Stopped off at Rita's on the way home, delish. (He's much more fun than any guy I've ever hung out with. What have I been doing with my life!?)

Saturday... went to the school from 9-2:30 and built middle school sets for senior sem with the lovely W-G's and me mommy... tons of fun with them. I got to play with dangerous tools like boxcutters and the big chop saw. They let me. Don't they know I'm a menace!? After that, I held my hindian soul sister hostage in her house for a while, then abducted her and demanded ransom at her 7-11, and finally took her to the house of remm, where i tortured her with my music and singing. We hung for a while, did some fun photoshop, went and got dinner, rented some dvds... Wow we have no life, because I thought that evening was fun. But down in words its pretty lame. :D We watched Saved!, some indie flick about this Christian school that's uber-devout.. there was a hot boy, Patrick Fugit. Mandy Moore's best line everrr: ""Roland, I just hit [the big Jesus billboard] with my van, I've got a pimple the size of Jupiter.. NO I'M NOT OK!"" and the principal's line, ""Are you down with G-O-D!?"" Laughing. My. Fucking. Ass. Off. Returned the hostage, because Ruchi's mom has a ""no negotiating with terrorists"" policy. Damn. So much less fun that way. Came home, watched Super Troopers with my dad. HA. Smart move on my part. (He secretly enjoyed it.) ""Meow, do I look like a cat to you boy? Am I jumpin' around all nimbly bimbly from tree to tree? Am I drinking milk from a saucer? DO YOU SEE ME EATING MICE?"" heeeheeeeheeeeeee.

Today: packing up and going to Rochester, NY for an open house at RIT, with me mommy. I'm gonig to be driving. Oh, dear, what have I gotten myself into!? :D This is gunna be fun.

Yesterday, decided that I'm actually going to try out for the play. I want to be on stage for once, maybe my name will actually get in the program this year. I've done pit band for three years and they have forgotten my name every year. (Even on the stupid little inserts that they add for the people that the forget. I was forgotten to be put on that, too. WTF!?) I figure I can sing and I can dance decently -  I know how to flamenco a bit, it doesn't get more Spanish, er, Latin-American, than that - and I'm willing to learn. And anyway, it's WEST SIDE STORY. Who wouldn't want to try out?

<P>Anyways... backtracking to yesterday... Homecoming game was sad, we lost 14-20 v. Burlington City. Our boys put in good effort though, made 2 touchdowns in last quarter. Better luck next time. Halftime show was decent, but shouldn't have played Final Countdown because it WASN'T decent... Then came <EM>Homecoming</EM>. Our king - LEON MALLOY!!!! :D Our queen - TERESA NYMICK!!!!!! (followed closely by my brownie Ruchi Gupta) Went home and slept some, because I've been SICK AS A FREAKING DOG. Throw up and all. But I kept down all my meals, perfect timing for my entertainment for the night... </P>
<P>Going to Jess Carr's for an hour, and prank phonecalling people! HAHA sooooo freaking hilarious... the Select Comfort lady told Jess her life story over the phone.. And the Starkist tuna guy... Omg. I&nbsp;&lt;3 that girl. The accent was too good to be true. Then... after the idiocy... the Homecoming Dance with a bit of good ol' New Egypt royalty. *big grin* Way fun. (Yeah we ""can't dance,"" haha what LIES) Can't wait til the next time around. </P>

"event","<P>*sigh* I love the beach, and LBI and working down there, having fun being a moron and going crazy... but sometimes I wonder what it would be like to spend my whole summer in New Egypt - you know, being able to hang out with friends all the time. Going to concerts spontaneously, where it doesn't have to be planned three weeks in advance. I know I'm leaving tomorrow. I know I can't wait. But there's this little part of me inside that's nagging, 'you KNOW you want to stay home and hang out with the people you never see anymore - tara, lindsey, lisa.. you KNOW you want to. And you <EM>can't</EM>, because you've already signed your life away to the beach.' And it makes me sad inside to know that I can't hang out with these guys on a normal or even somewhat semi/pseudo-normal basis. I know the whole reason I go away is to leave New Egypt, to get away from it, because I dislike the place... but deep down it's really grown on me. It's become somewhat close to my heart and I don't want to leave... but I do. It's complicated like that. <BR>I always tell people to come visit me, and they promise they will. I tell them where I work and give out my cell number and the shore phone, and it really hurts to realize on Labor Day weekend that they still haven't come and most likely won't be. It's happened a number of times, with many different people. And each time, it's someone who I would go find at their workplace at some point over the course of the summer, or at least call them and tell them, 'I hope you're having fun, but I'm sorry I'm not gunna make it down to see you... Have fun for me and I'll call you again.' I'd make up for it. I guess what it just comes down to is that I'm one of those people that takes promises to heart and really holds true to them. Sorry for being so generous and promise-upstanding.<BR>I guess I'd better be going, as it's nearly eleven, I'm leaving at eight AM and I'm still not completely packed. <BR><BR>This was my one for the road.<BR>-Courtney</P>"

I guess this one will be a writing-ish journal then. None of the lists of what I did today. 
=========================================
<i>it was a heart wrenching end to a perfect tale of love.</i>

She wept. 
He was silent.
She blew her nose. 
He had offered her no handkerchief.
She left. 
He stayed behind.
She was never to see his face again. 
He could no longer open his eyes.
She left him a single rose. 
He couldn't smell it or touch it or see it. 
She had once stayed behind. 
He had once left her.

<i>It was the cause of all this despair.</i>

He had been twenty. 
She was eighteen at the time.
He didn't go to college, because he had no money. 
She was a shoo-in at Vassar thanks to her parents.
He left for the US Marine Corps boot camp. 
She moved into her dorm on the same day.
He had seen her the day before. 
She had been crying, missing him already.
He had promised to marry her when he came back. 
She nodded and took his word for granted.
He had smiled and taken her home.
She had thrown her arms around his neck and wept some more.
He soothed her, wrapping his arms around her.
She had kissed him upon the lips, the most assertive move she'd ever made.
He'd been surprised, but had kissed her back.
She said, 'I love you.'
He said it, too. 

'I love you.' (<i>Three simple words in an eight-letter phrase.</i>)

She didn't know where he went after a few weeks.
He wasn't allowed to send letters, they might have been intercepted.
She was worried sick about him.
He thought about her night and day.
She was ecstatic when she got the letter with her name written on it, in his handwriting.
He had written to tell her how much he loved her, and that he expected to be home in a month.
She looked at the date at the top. (<i>April 30</i>)
He didn't come home.

It was already June 27th. Two months had passed.

She looked again at the pile of mail.
It was typed, formal, and had 'Department of the Military' written as the return address.
She couldn't breathe.
She couldn't open it.
She couldn't touch it.
She fell down in a pile and wept.

*

He was silent, startched, and solemn.
She thought he was sleeping.
He had no warmth in his face when she touched it.
She wished he were there for her, that it was anyone else.
He had no sympathies or a shoulder for her to cry on.
She wept.
He was silent.
She blew her nose.
He had offered her no handkerchief.
She left. 
He stayed behind.
She was never to see his face again. 
He could no longer open his eyes.
She left him a single rose. 
He couldn't smell it or touch it or see it. 
She touched the casket and walked away.
He was dead and gone.

In his death, her heart died, too.


***
In remembrance of the loved ones lost in war.

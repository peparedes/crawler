It all started out when my mom woke me up REALLY early. Six 'o clock AM to be exact. I started to get up, when I realized...... ""Mom! It's Saturday!"" I told my mom, still half asleep. ""Yes, but don't you remember?""

No.

""We're going to look at a college, for Lee!""

Crap.

""Mooooooooom.....you should have told me, then I wouldn't have went to sleep at 3 am!"". ""But you should never go to sleep at 3 am!"" she yelled at me. ""But I always do on Saturday! You know that!""

So, I got ready, almost fell asleep on the floor of my bathroom, then went downstairs. I felt sick, and even when I was getting ready, i sneezed and felt like my brain was gonna pop out. Blegh. So we went to the car, I fell asleep, woke up in an hour (it takes an hour to get to the college) and went outside, which was FREEZING! Anyways, we went inside, got all of the stuff we needed, and got ready to tour campus. We went out into the freezing morning, and toured for about 30 minutes. I got even sicker. We went inside to the gym. Listening to someone talk about campus for an hour (on really uncomfy seats....) I fell half asleep during the speach. Anyways, we went around campus. saw some nice dorms. They had REALLY REALLY nice dorms at the top on this hill. They consider it on campus, but it's pretty far from it. Anyways, they had really good cookies there. X3 But, when I got home, I found out I was sick (I felt sick the whole day) I had a tempurature of 102 I think. Anyways, I'm better today at least. X3"

"event","Heh, I may sound like i'm acting sarcastic in the title, but today, I'm actually happy! ^_^

Today was my happiest day this whole week! ^_^ At least so far. Well, let's start out with the good things...

Today was a half day at school. Half days of school are expecially fun when it's your best friends birthday. Her parents make cupcakes for everyone! X3 And when your best friend has a birthday, she deserves to be treated like royalty, so, she brings a little toy crown from home and wears it for the whole half day. And when the crown starts to make her head all itchy, she let's you wear it! And she seems extra chipper all day, which, since smiles are contagious, makes her best friend, me, smile all day also! ^_^ Finally, the half day ends, and you must leave your best friend. But wait? You get on your bus, and your other two best friends are sitting right near you! You sit down, and eat your cupcake and talk with them, until...it's time to go home. You leave, and are surprised to see your dad when you get home! You never get to see your dad during the day because he's so busy! But today's different! You smile and say hi, and talk for a while. Finally, his break ends, and he has to go back to work. But your still happy! Why? Because later in the day, you get to go to a beauty contest! For who? Why your aunts 3 dogs of course! It's a Halloween contest for dogs! Your aunt is going to dress her biggest dog (a German Shepard) George as a jester, and her two little chihuahuas (Lulu and Fred) are dressing as a king and queen! ^_^

I can;t wait for the Halloween contest thing for dogs! ^_^ Gonna be so cuuuuute! And even better, I might be able to walk one of the dogs on stage! YAY!!! Hopefully it'll be Lulu, necause she's my aunts newest little puppy, and she's ADORABLE!!! ^.^

Anyways, I hope you enjoyed reading about my enjoyable day! =3

Bai bai!

Guess what happened this morning? Yet another thing is stolen from my house...and I get really sick.....and I found out that the guy I really like (yes, I like someone.. >.>;;; ) got a girlfriend......

Yup. Another black light was stolen from my porch. I swear, I'm gonna get a pitbull as my guard dog and have it rip off that little bastard's head.

I got what my brother had because I didn't go to school today (not that I mind though, but still, I feel sick.. >.< )

Yesterday, I was robbed of one of the only things that I have left of my grandfather. My brother got really sick, and so did my dad.

And just when I though things just couldn't get any worse for the day, I find out that one of my best friend's dog gets hit by a car.

Nikko, he was with my friend Caitlin for six short years, and she would say. She told me the night before that she wanted to spend a lot of time with Nikko, for some reason. She stayed by his side for a few hours strait. And what do you know? He dies the next morning.

Even I had a bad feeling the night before yesterday. I just had this feeling...that a lot of things were gonna go wrong...

And sadly, I was right.

Today is the wort day I've had in a while.

Some FUCKING IDIOT stole 2 things of my family's that were on my porch. You know, a lot of people who read this thing are probably gonna think I'm sounding like a complete baby when I tell you what they stole, because they stole a black light and a scarecrow.

I really don't give a damn about the black light, but the scarecrow is really important to me. Why you may ask? Because, it was made by my grampa.

And my grampa is dead.

My mom is really depressed about it too, because my grampa made it just for her. I swear, I really want it back too.

If I ever find out who stole it, I'll hurt them SO MUCH!!! (probably a lot of you think I'm over-reacting, but it's important to me...)"

Rich was going balistic when the teacher told him to stay with the tempo of the song (also sluring his words >.>;;;) and every time someone told him to calm down, he'd say ""Okay"" and, literally, fall on his face.

They had neither of them.

It sucked! >,< But, my dad made me stay inside the book store with him while he looked for this really big crossword book he wanted. While he did that, I read some ""Calvin and Hobbes"" comic strips. Those are really good! My dad used to love those when he was younger, so he bought me this really big book of Calvin and Hobbes comics. They're funny! ^_^ I read a few and remembered how much I love those things. Oooh! And great news! Calvin and Hobbes are coming back to my Sunday paper this month! YAY!!!

Oh, and remember that day I was looking through all of my Sonic the Hedgehog related things? Well, I found a LOT more things that I forgot about! ^_^

1.) A little Sonic Adventure shampoo bottle with Sonic and Knuckles on it. Oh, and it has this cute little game in it! ^_^ There you press buttons, and you try and shoots these rings onto these hook things. I've had it for a few years.
2.) An Amy Rose hedgehog watch that I got for my birthday a few years ago. It has my name inscribes on the inside. I love that thing! Though, it's been missing for a while. i miss it!
3.) The Japanese Sonic Movie. Not sure if I already mentioned that though...
4.) A black t-shirt with Sonic on it, and he's punching towards you, like he's jumping or something. It bought it for my brother's birthday at hot topic. I'm trying to buy a brown one with him on it for myself, but I haven't seen one for a while... >,<
5.) My brother got this little Sonic book for little kids when he was like, 7, and it's somewhere in my room. I think it had Sally in it or something. Only, she had pink fur at the time.
6.) I bought this little black SonicX wristband at Hot Topic. Even though I don't exactly watch the show ( >.>;;; ) I still wanted it... XDDD

I still have a bunch'o other things that I can't remember. Anyways, I gotta go now. Bai bai!

Well, ever since my brother was like, 10 or something, he's loved eating hot sauces, and over many years of literally drinking giant bottles of Frank's Hot Sauce, he's grown a 'fire-proof stomach'...literally. So, he decided to try the hottest wings they had there, which was their Atomic Sauce, which are probably the hottest things you'll ever eat (because it's like...made out of Habanero peppers or something). He even had to sign a release form! Heh...I think this was the first time in my life that I ever heard my brother say, ""Dude, that's hot!"" after trying a hot sauce. He keeps telling me that the skin on his lips are peeling off now because of it. XD

He sang every word, and even sang the guitar solos. So..I just had to listen to it when I got home. So I got my Running With Scissors album thing and listened to it like....3 times..I'm even listening to it right now. I like....wasted 30 minutes of my life listening to Weird Al singing........

""So I got in my car and I drove over to the donut shop. And I walked on up to the guy behind the counter. And he says ""Yeah, what do ya want?!?!?"" I said ""You got any glazed donuts?""

I said ""Well, in that case - in that case, what do you have?"" He says ""All I got right now is this box of one dozen starving, crazed weasels"" I said ""OK, I'll take that""

Because, if you pay attention, right before Boone (or whatever his name is XD) fell to his death out of that tree in the plane, he talked into the radio thing and said, ""We're the survivors of Oceanic Flight ### (I forgot the number also XDDD)"" and the people on the other end of the radio said, ""What? WE'RE the survivors of Oceanic Flight yadda yadda yadda"". Yep.

I'm talking to much.

Anyways, I didn't get to see the rest of ""Invasion"" last night, so Im'na go watch it. Bai bai."

<div class=""textBoxtext"">IF YOU DON'T SIGN THIS THEN YOU ARE SICK! by the way, highlight it all and copy (ctrl + c) and paste (ctrl + v) and go to compose a new message, do not forward. This is so terrible. A site that we were able to shut last year has returned We have to try to shut it down again! (www.bonsaikitten.com) A Japanese man in New York breeds and sells kittens that are called BONSAI CATS. That would sound cute, if it weren't kittens that were put into little bottles after being given a muscle relaxant and then locked up for the rest of their lives!! The cats are fed through a straw and have a small tube for their faces. The skeleton of the cat will take on the form of the bottle as the kitten grows. The cats never get the opportunity to move. They are used as original and exclusive souvenirs. These are the latest trends in New York, China, Indonesia and New Zealand. If you think you can handle it, go to this site www.bonsaikitten.com and have a look at the methods being used to put these little kittens into bottles.

 Heh heh...I got that from my friend Vellu from her journal. Yup yup. I like eet. XD But argh...I have nothing better to do.

 The only thing I really did today was find all the things around my house that were Sonic related (other than the video games and drawings) like plushies, pillows, toys, comics, tapes, cds, whatever. I found about half of the Sonic comics I own (though I still have a few binders filled with the rest of the comics laying somewhere around the house), a Sonic toy that rolls around the floor (though part of it is missing) from McDonald's or something, all my plushies/pillows, my Sonic Adventure 2 soundtrack, and my ""Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog"" tapes (ex: Grounder the Genius, Tails New Home [or something like that]). Yah, that's about it. But, I do know I have a ""Sonic Underground"" tape laying around somewhere, and a SatAM (The other Sonic the Hedgehog tv show with Sally) DVD somewhere also. But my GOSH, where are they!?!? Argh...I have too much Sonic stuff to keep track of, not including the video games.

 *sigh* Speaking about the video games, when my brother was about six, he bought his first video game ever, Sonic the Hedgehog 2 for the Sega Genesis. I still remember when I was a little kid begging my brother to let me play it. ^.^ Then, he stopped playing Sonic games after Sonic Spinball came out or something. Then, when Sonic Adventure 2 Battle came out he was like, ""ZOMG!!!! DAD!!!!! SONIC IS ON TV!!!! REMEMBER HIM!?!?!?!? I GOTTA HAVE THAT GAME ITLOOKSSOAWESOMEBUYITFORMEEEEEE!!!!!!"" Yep yep. Then, after we beat Sonic Adventure 2 Battle (which took like 2 days because we played non-stop XD ) we bought all of the other Sonic games that we missed during the time we didn't play it. Yep yep.

Why am I telling you this?

I have NUUUU clue. XD Anyways, I'm gonna go look for more Sonic stuff of mine. Bai bai. *hops off*"

"event","I know this is kinda late to post ((because what I'm about to say happened about a week ago, but still))

Well, let's see. Three days before Labor Day, I left at 6:00 PM to go to Paramount's Kings Island in Ohio. And......HOLY CRAP IT ROCKED!!!!!! Well, we got there about 4 hours from when we left, and stayed over night at a hotel practically across the rode from the park. Well, the next morning we got up, had breakfast in the hotel lobby, and went to the park.

 The first ride we went on was the highest, only wooden roller coaster in the world that has a loop, The Son of the Beast. It was rough. I couldn't feel my legs after I got off. I practically broke my neck on it. I had a headache when I got off. And I loved every bit of it. XDDD I even have bruises because of how rough it was!!! Oh, and the greatest part about it was that it took us a minutes to get on the ride, because since we got there so early, there was NO LINE AT ALL!!!! XD Well, actually, the whole day was like that. There weren't really any lines. So, well, we got off, rode more roller coasters, walked around some more, and then.....I saw life size Sonic and Shadow dolls. I had to win them!!!! But I didn't. *gonk* Ergh...but! I did win an Amy and Tails plushie, and I got this funky little Shadow pillow. XD I only need a Rouge doll now because I have pretty much all of the other dolls (Sonic, Knuckles, Shadow, Amy, Tails) so haha! So, after that, we went to the hotel, slept, got up the next morning, ate breakfast, and went back to the park. We rode pretty much all of the other roller coasters except for one because the line was WAY TOO FRICKIN' LONG. Really, the only rides that I rode were the extreme thrill rides. Like all of the roller coasters, the Tomb Raider ride (which is like the Big Kahuna at Kennywood [if you live near Pittsburgh like me] only WAY HUGER and hangs you upside down for thirty seconds almost), and The Drop Zone (which is like a taller/higher/ huger/ more funner [XD] version of the Pittfall in Kennywood and it holds about 40 people at once).

 Oh, and the coolest/weirdest thing effur was that when we got off of The Drop Zone, the thing that pulls you up in the air got stuck and I was on the last ride of the day. All of the people in line behind me had to get out of line. So, then it took like and hour to get the thing back down before they were able to let people back on. Anyways........

That's it.....

I hope you enjoyed reading about my life as an Extreme Thrill ride Lover.....Wtf? That's a good title. O.o I should write a book about my life, and how one of my biggest dreams is to bunjee jump off of the Empire State Building. =D Yush! *backflips away from you, then skips off*

*skips towards towards you* Oh yesh! In other news, I burned myself on a pot in my gramma's kitchen and got a first degree burn, and HOLY $*** DID IT HURT!!!! I actually burned it in a big area on my arm. I hink the only reason it hurt so much was because I got burned in two areas on my arm and those two burns are huge. My dad said it started blistering or something when he was putting the burn gel on it. Ahmahgahd it hurt like HELL!!!! *anime falls and squirmes off*"

"event","Yupperz. Just like the title says. I found a really funny flash movie thing on deviantART two nights ago and found it really funny. XD I asked the dude who made it if I could post a link to it in my journal and crap, and he said yes, so. Well, the movie is supposed to be about a funny way to make a flash movie in eleven steps, but, if your not a member of dA, it will kinda be hard for you to understand. Though, a few of the steps are quite funny (at least I thought) and after all of the steps, he made a short little animation that had to do with everything he mentioned in the steps. Please watch the video. It is funny, especially for fans of Inuyasha, Fullmetal Alchemist, Teen titans, and a famous artist on dA named Kite-Ride (who rocks!)

Well, please enjoy this funny video. XD

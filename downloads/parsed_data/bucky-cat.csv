Hi my name is Bucky. Yes, I know I've been surgically altered. But I am looking for some FINE honies in search of a good time. I like the big girls too. I am 1 year old this month. I have blue eyes and I work out. My favorite interests include long walks on the windowsill and reading newspapers. Oh yeah and attacking shit. So if you're looking for a good time you know where to find me."

So I took this leather jacket and decided to try it on. Oh I figure I'll look like a badass. You know. But mommy had to pick me up and hug me and tkae pictures and stuff. These people are such crap. I am so going to bite them in their sleep. Suckas."

"event","So daddy is pretty mad at me today. Well its all his fault! Him and mommy were sleeping in and there was only a few bits of food in my bowl! So I went in there to teach them a lesson. Clearly the way to do this is to knock their shit on to the floor. 

So I knocked Daddy's glasses on to the floor. And when they were on the floor, I played with them and moved them and bit them repeatedly and ran away with them in my mouth. Haha! They were none the wiser! Their smooth roundness felt so delightful in my jaws. 

A few hours later I heard daddy scream pissed off. I think he called me a furless curse word, ""shit-head."" It ends up I left permanent marks all over his glasses and now he can't wear them cause he can't see. They look all wet he says. 

Serves him right bee-otch! Next time get your ass out of bed when I ask for food!"

"event","<P>I got kicked out of school for&nbsp;Fighting. I think everyone really knows the story or has heard about it.Well it has been 5 days and back to school I get to go 2morrow I am so <STRONG>VERY&nbsp;HAPPY</STRONG>.Well when I was out of school my mom or sister took me shopping so it was pretty good to be out of school.The thing that sucked was the homework I had to make up.I also was not able to talk to my freinds even tho I always find ways around it lmao.My grandma came up from Alabama so it was nice spending sometime with her sense I never see her.Being locked up in ur house for 5days not counting the weekend sucks.Kyle,Joey &amp; me went up to apple charlies.That was my 1st time out of the house with my friends<STRONG>.</STRONG>Think twice before your going to fight but if u know you are going to win then kick there ASS.</P>

Wow. We were very pissed off on the ride back to This skanky ass girls house. We were given her a ride home. And we left Chris at her house cuz I guess he liked her. Eww. So then me Nancy and Bubba went driving around and went to the Gas station and got some stuff. Then went back to Nancys house but then left cuz ppl where home. Then we went back to Bubbas house and we all hung out and then me Nancy Chris and Bubba went hot tubing.;) Good times.

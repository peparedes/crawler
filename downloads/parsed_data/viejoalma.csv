"event","Okay, I'm brand new to this livejournal thing but I hope to smooth out some quirks over the next few days. Luckily, I haven't too much going on this weekend so I should have some time to work on it.

One of the main things that I want to get into my layout are buttons. Maybe they are called something else here but over in Diaryland (this was years ago), we were able to list links with or without buttons on the side of our main page. This is an absolute must! I love to make little artsy buttons and it would be nice to link up some of my favorite sites!"

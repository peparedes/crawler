yeahhhh; not exactly looking forward to it.
i remember exactly what i did a year ago from today.
but thats when things were fine between us; we were ""normal""
now its all drama; its funny though..
youd think youd have more drama when you were younger?
and youd think as you GROW UP youd have LESS drama because well, youd be MORE MATURE
guess there is still time to see if that happens...
wait, who am i kidding? ""us"" not have drama... HAHAHAHAHA.
its really pure entertainment from this point of view
as long as im not part of it; i could care LESSS
whatever; im not part of any of it and i promised myself i wont get into it this year
and thats an easy promise for me to make:)
so all you drama setters out there [oh, you know who you are]
dont even try; cause ti wont work:)
CANT WAIT TILL THIS YEAR; oh ya.. you can clearly see how THRILLED i am

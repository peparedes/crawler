went to down under bar last night with the guy. i had my first ever panic attack when we were walking up to the entrance. i didn't even show id, i just walked in and went to the toilet - locked myself in and desperately tried to breathe. my heart was beating so fast i thought it would come right out of my chest... i don't know why. hmmm. hope it doesn't happen again.

anyway. stayed there until 3am, which was good. i don't usually like down under and last night was no different. but the company was great. had the guy and his friends. they made me feel really welcome which was a blessing. 

drove home at 3am. while he was driving me home it became obvious that i can't deny it any longer - i actually like him. and he actually likes me. i'm smitten. he's growing on me and i don't care. i'm happy and i can't believe it. now i really have to take it slow and steady. 

he let me drive his car down my street wooooooooo was so fun. then when i drove to my house and i had to leave, i really didn't want to leave. i wanted to stay. i wanted him to stay. i walked down my driveway and in my head im thinking ""no... don't let him leave..."" but my common sense stopped me from doing anything. i had such a good time with him last night, i didn't want it to end :-(

we'll see if we can top last night tonight :-)

keep y'all updated."

why do people have to be so shallow? well not shallow, rather - judgmental? I'm fighting my head and my heart at the moment and it's all because of what other people will think.

i like this guy but i am denying it. you see i haven't had such a great track record in relationships. i was in a 2 year relationship which ended 6 months ago which saw my whole life turn upside down and I lost my friends because of it. now can you see why i'm not too eager to tell my friends about this particular guy? 

they know him. they've seen him. they've hung out with him. they've seen us together. i've done well denying my feelings but my body language must be telling a different story. don't get me wrong, nothing has happened between me and this certain guy. but people must see that something SHOULD be going on... 

I know he likes me, and he knows I like him. we talk every night for hours on end about nothing. it seems perfect. we both want a relationship but i'm not eager to start a relationship built on secrets and lies. i know what my friends are like. they won't approve. perhaps they will ""approve"" but i know they will talk behind my back. how could they not? they will be worried about me, because it seems I'm setting myself up for the same heartbreak i suffered 6 months ago. but i'm doing things right this time. i've been on several dates with this guy, and i confessed that i like him, but i am not ready to kiss him until i know him better. why waste my kisses on someone who could turn out to be a dud? and besides, i want our first kiss to be somewhere special, or somewhat memorable. 

my heart says yes, and so does my head - but then i think of what people will think. i shouldn't care. but i do. don't get me wrong - i don't care what strangers think - they can go to hell. but my friends? of course i care. because they care about me, and they are only looking out for me. but how can i tell them everything is fine if i don't confess this budding relationship? i must tell them, because the longer i take to tell them, the more hurt they will be for me not telling them such a huge thing.

It has been a long time since my last update. It's exactly 1 month until I turn 18! How awesome! It doesn't really make any difference to me though. It's not like I'll be going clubbing or anything. A lot has changed since my last entry, almost a year ago. Seems like a century ago. Just goes to show you that the things you think are soooo important now, will be so insignificant in the future. I'm happy right now, I have my eBay business up and running, I finally feel like myself. I got this new short haircut, (so 80s, unintentionally! I promise!) and I feel like for once something suits me. I got my own computer which is really helping me with the business. I think I'm going to have a Roxette themed birthday party. I wonder who'll come? It'll just be me, Michael and Daniel sitting round a table listening to Roxette. I can see it now! LOL

I'd better be off now.

Should I be alone and go out VERY RARELY and have fun? Or should I stay with my fiancee' who is very jealous and strict and be in love but never really have any fun or life on my own? What happens when he leaves? Who AM I? No friends, no school, nothing! Oh well.

I don't know which one to choose because one week, one will forget to call me and i will have the full intention to break up with him but then he'll call me and be so sweet and i am back to where i started again.

i'm seeing this guy but he's been weirdo lately and i know our 'relationship' is coming to an end. You know how you can just feel it? How when you call him, he doesn't call you baby anymore? He's more distant than ever before? *Cries* i really could have stayed with him for a long time. we just get along so well and it's just really good when we get together - it just works! i sound soooo corny but it's all true ay. Anyway i hate this - i just want to know what is going on so i can either be happy to be with him or move on! It's the worst when it drags on - i wish i could just know what is going to happen... whether we're going to break up or make it through. I really want to be with him though. But i just don't think he has time for me anymore. And one day, he will leave me to go back home. :( i'm going to stop complaining and find out what is going on tonight.

anyway i'm so tripped out and confused and i can't even remember half of the stuff that has happened over these hols. 

You know what? How can a guy jut ignore a chick? Even if i need to break up with someone, i can't just ignore them. I couldn't be as heartless (and gutless!) to do that to someone. Everyone has been hurt and that's the ultimate way to do it in my books. Not knowing is fucken harsh and instead of knowing the first day, you sit there for days, weeks, months even wondering what's going on. I know it hurts to hear someone say they don't like / love you anymore but it saves a lot of heartache in the long term that's for sure. Well that's my point of view! lol

It's so stupid how something that was important to you a year ago seems like the most irrelavant thing to you now. I just hate him so much for what he did to me but I can't stay mad since we were such good friends b4 we tried going out!

I mean, I do writing in my spare time, for example I'm writing two stories atm that have been going on for ages but I just don't know. I'm not even sure he knows how old I am which is my biggest dilemma. I don't want to ruin my chances of this great opportunity but then again I don't want to get found out or disapoint.

Oh well. If I want to get my career in music going then I have to get as many contacts and as many opportunities to get experience as possible. Like these things like the muso fest and this thing will never come again!!!!

OK well I met Sum41 and they're really nice. Um that guy... well I talked to him on tha fone about five times and I asked him if he wanted to go out wit me twice but apparently he was too thick to have known I was *asking him out*, so he got pissed when he heard it from his friends. As a result, he called me up at 1pm one night and abused me, calling me a skanky ho and a bitch (he was drunk, but that's no excuse). It's not fair 'coz it was him... but it wasn't. He's just acting all hardcore and I know he's not like that. 

That night I explained everything to him about *us* and he understood. I wish he'd just act like he did when we worked 2gether. When there was no pressure, and it we were just work mates. And I've fucked it up now, 'coz we don't talk anymore. It's majorly fucked. I still like him, and it's just a matter of time before I get over it, and I will...

What really pisses me off is that out of all of this - I'm the loser. 'You'd of thought ambition was a crime' (sound familiar... Jase said that). You'd think that fancing someone was a crime. You know, I actually lost my job 'coz of him. I HAD to quit 'coz of him. And he's not affected one bit. For fucks sake, I put my heart and emotions on the line. I call him up, I ask him out, and all he does is call me a skanky ho. That's fucken harsh I reckon ay.

I'm still fucked up 'coz he only rang me last Friday night / Saturday morning. And I spoke 2 him yesterday (we did this piss funny prank... oh man!)

I want my job back! I miss it (man I didn't think it possible!)... 

I wanna get in2 contact with those nice chickys from work. I don't wanna just forget them! Well I'm gonna go... if anyone actually did read this, then I'm sorry you did. I'm pathetic!

b. Damn well talk to him!

OK - a. is not gonna happen. b. is just getting a bit pathetic. I've fucken worked with him for two or more months and I was FINE. Maybe I didn't feel nervous around him because I had a b/f and didn't feel nervous 'coz he's just a friend. I did actually like him a little bit when I was going out with sum1. But that's all cool, 'coz he fucken moved to melbourne to get wit another chick. (scroll down two or three messages... you'll see)

Um yeah, I'm wasting lots of make-up on this dude. Lol. Omg, saw him smile today. Me and Nicole were convinced he only had one facial expression. Wrong. He now has two.

Nicole heard Taxiride last night :(
I don't wanna think about it.

Mel (not me, another Mel!), said to me something about that I really like Joel. It's true. I cried over him, ahem, over a chick hugging him. While typing last nights entry to this thing, I had tears in my eyes the whole way. P-A-T-H-E-T-I-C!

"event","Last night I took my chances and told Codie that I like Joel... she's like teasing me and calling me a stalker. (they way I see it is that if I'm not going through his garbage or hiding in his garden, it's not stalking LOL)... Oh yeah, like as if you can call going to a shopping centre with your friends to go shopping is stalking. If Joel happens to be there, so be it. There I said it - twice. His name is Joel ok!

Y'know, I actually have to ask his ex-girlfriend for his msn addy. Lol funny shite though. I bet she's real pretty. And thin and plain gorgeous ay. It's not fair! I luv him so much. I was like fully crying yesterday 'coz this chick was hugging him. When it happened I like froze. Y'know that feeling in ur heart when something hurts you so bad? That's what I got. I had a dream about him last night. 

my dream -

well was shopping with Nicole and then we went towards the food court and my mum is talking to this guy I dated once (literally, once... bastard!) and she's like abusing him! Lol, so me and 'Cole are listening then round the corner comes Joel and Jeremy. 

I am so guy orientated. Lol - that's a good thing... right?!?! Of course...

Once, me friend told her friend how many guys I 'liked' in that year. LOL 
She counted like every guy I ever said was hot. I can't remember but there was over 20... LOL 

Do I mean nothing to anyone? I mean fuck. Joel doesn't hardly notice me. Sure, he looks at me, but that's 'coz he recognises me from work. I doubt he has any real feelings for me. 

This is some lyrics from Lovesong. It's so relevant right now:

Its one thing to ask why we break up
Have you ever
Wondered why it is we fall in love
Can you tell me
Do you know what it is you're looking for
What do we need
Can you tell me why I care
How is it that we heed 
That voice that says i want you there

-------------------------------------------

Makes ya think ay. Like why do we fall in love? 

I swear to god I'm gonna break down if I see Joel again and if he doesn't talk to me.
I mean fuck. We worked together for a few months ay. That mean nothing?!?!?

I don't think so. It's up to me now. 

Luv Always Mel xoxoxoxox"

"event","This whole Pizza Boy thing is getting out of hand. Seriously.

I came online tonight so I could chase people for his email addy but no-one is online. What a waste of perfectly good sleeping time eh?

Going to go see Pizza Boy on Thursday. Tommorrow I get paid, so I'm gonna go shopping for stuff... lol

FUCK... Forgot. Gotta work 2moz

SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT!

lol

I don't wanna work. Work was fun when Pizza Boy worked there. I hate calling him that. It sounds gay. Like he's a little five-year old kid! He's not... he's actually sweet 16... I think. See?!?! That's what makes it so pathetic. 

I'm head over heels for this guy but I don't even know - 

* His Email
* His surname
* His address
* His phone number

Things I do know - 
 
* His first name
* His suburb
* His friend / workmate
* His School

pretty standard shit.

Yeah... So bored...

Umm... Downloaded a EYG midi which was a good find. 

Awwwwww what I wouldn't do to have a shift again with Pizza Boy. I loved working with him. 
He even had a catch phrase. Which I can't mention :P

AWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW
I hate work now! There's no1 good! Even the chick who's always been nice to me basically yelled at me on the phone tonight. Jeez, I was just checking my roster! 

Going to go before I find something else to ramble on about...

luv mel oxoxox"

"event","hmmm...
went to see pizza boy today. Had that gut feeling that today wasn't *THE* day. 
OH MY GOD
So embarassing. Was in SOSE in last period and I was just adjusting the not 4 pizza boy a bit and OMG the teacher stole it off me! And read it!

It's all like saying I like him and shit like that. Not soppy, but still embarrasing for a teacher to read. I can't yell at her either. Today was her first day back since her mum died. 

Ummm. Gotta work on Wednesday. Maybe pizza boys friend will be working and I can sus out the vibe.

I really should use their names to avoid confusion but what if pizza boy and I go out? And he somehow gets the address to this page off my profile or a webpage? And knows all this shit? Lol he'd know anyway, 'coz it's pretty obvious. 

Oh well 'sall good eh?!?!?

This is pissing me off. He's so cute and gorgeous and FUNNY and nice!

OMG. I have two or three good memories off him. 
1. The cheese stomping thing [we were in the cold room and he started jumping on a bag of cheese to break it up and chucking the bag around. Then another guy comes in and he's like huh? IT WAS SO FUNNY)
2. The sauce thing [it's too long and it won't be funny to anyone else who reads it!)
3. The pizza base making thing 

yeah this is getting old now. Me talking about pizza boy. But he's SO CUTE!

AWWWWWWWWWW Don't guys just PISS YOU OFF!

After dating that 21 year old, I didn't want another boyfriend for a long time... then pizza boy comes along - again. I was naughty - I liked pizza boy when I was going out wit da 21 year old. And he knew it too (the 21yr old). WELL HE FUCKEN MOVED TO FUCKEN MELBOURNE TO FUCKEN GET WITH THIS CHICK AND TOLD ME ABOUT IT. AND THEN HE FUCKEN CAME BACK AND TOOK HIM BACK. WHAT A FUCKHEAD I AM!

God I am SO glad I got rid of him. OMG had to tell him I was pregnant to get rid of him. (After I broke up with him, like a month after he wanted to get back wit me so I said I had a b/f whom I'm pregnant to)

LOL

Well gotta go

Luv Mel xoxo
sorry about the swearing :P"

Hmm, the last few days have been pretty big. Urmmm, well not much news going on about Pizza boy yet, but gonna go see him on Monday *sigh*. Um, have to work tomorrow, which is very bad 'coz I just know Pizza Boy's best friend (who has an inkling i like pizza boy) will be there working as well. What can ya do?!?! Already 'weasled' out of two shifts over the past week or two so I can't do it again. Might as well bloody quite eh? I only liked the job 'coz of Pizza Boy, he kept me going eh? Remember the cheese in the cold room thing? And the teaching me how to sauce thing? LOL all great memories of me working with Pizza Boy. Lol, the only good memories of working there are those.

Um, replied to the very nasty e-mail I recieved from someone who will remain nameless. Although, many Taxiride fans KNOW damn well who I'm talking about. Hopefully, the matter will never be brought up again. I made a mistake, I apologised. You'd think that'd be that right? WRONG!

Jeez I'm so drained right now. I'm such a computer freak! 

Uh, yeah tomorrow gonna get all ready the night b4 I see Pizza Boy (you know how many times I've gone to type in his REAL name???). You see, I hate my hair being straight so I wave it... stuff like that. Stuff guys don't even notice but you feel better if you think you're made up. If you're used to wearing make-up around, even if it's just a little bit, you're gonna feel a lil' self conscienous about it if you're not wearing it in front of a cute pizza boy. Why do I keep calling him that? Lol he's not a pizza boy anymore. But ex-pizza boy sounds weird. Oh well, 'sall good eh?

Awww go away damn pop-up. It's friggin' flashing at me! Jesus christ. You'd think the people who make pop-ups were crazy. Who the hell is going to trust an internet casino? Or a dating service? Jeez I know I wouldn't!

Hmm... gonna see Taxiride soon which will be good. Did a little bit of work on the Taxiride Video Bio today, though, not much can be done til after the ekka gig when I get more resources.

Yay gonna have a new website soon. That makes me happy 'coz I'm a HTML freak. I luv making websites.

Me and Jen are gonna make our own which should be great 'coz I've never made on partner type website before. 

Jeez I'm tired. I'm in my bed, sitting up with the laptop. If it weren't for the friggin' longest internet cord you've ever seen trailing from my room out into the kitchen I'd got to sleep right now. Dammit, if I get up to take the cord down I'll be awake, and have nothing to do 'coz I'll be offline (sad).

Well I'm gonna finish the entry now. Gonna try and change the style.

Luv ya lots 4 reading"

"event","Went to Logan City Tavern last Sunday. Great gig, talked to Jase (briefly!) and got pic with him. 

Urm... saw *that guy i used 2 work with* (can't mention his name lol) today. He was smoking... I don't know why that affects me. Jeez! I can't talk! If my good friend Kate offers me a drag I'll do it. I just don't exactly like the taste, so imagine kissing someone that does. LOL oh well. 

I just don't want to become a smoker too! I mean, the seven people that mean most to me smoke, and that's pretty bad. I don't want any of them to die 'coz of it!

In case ur wondering, those 7 are - 

My Mum
My crush
and Taxiride

I am so tired and just drained!

I think I better go...

Anyway... 
I'm on holiday, that's why I'm on the net so damn early. It's so unusually cold up here (in QLD). Yeah... I don't really know what to say, things haven't been terribly interesting lately. Yesterday I was fully pissed off at the printer, computer and iron-on transfer paper! It just WOULD'NT work for me. And when it did, I went to iron it on (to test it, luckily wasn't THE shirt) and it went all crap. But it's all good now. Let's hope it works for the gig! 

If I go out and buy a good top and ruin it, I'm so writing an abusive e-mail to that company. It's meant to be EASY godammit!

Oh well... I'm used these gigs not working out... aka Twin Towns 2, my mum ended up in hospital. Afterglow in-store - My friend spilled mustard on my top, just minutes away from MEETING TAXIRIDE!, Doomben - crying non-stop for about 3, yes three hours 'coz it didn't look like I could go. But I went :P

I wonder what'll happen this time? I slip over and flash everyone - or even worse the guys? Hehehhee that'd be SO piss funny though. I'd laugh if I did that in front of them! What else could u do???

Lol... Well, I'm off!

oh well it's all good. I get paid more per hour, which is good 'coz I need lots of money at the moment for the Taxiride gig! 

I so can't wait for that gig! I'm hoping Dan the Merch Man will be there. He told me he's still waiting to be asked so I'll just have to hope! Well I'm gonna go... my journal is so boring..."

"event","Yay! Only 29 days 'til I again, see Taxiride! I've been preparing too! I want to wear this little black singlet top, so therefore need to buff up my stomach so I've been doing a minimum of 100 sit-ups per day... average around 110-130. I know, I'm going a bit far, but I do need to shed that fat! I was doing it anyway and started up again sorta 'coz of this.

Anyway, enough of my stomach (eww...)

Taxiride will be playing at the Logan City Tavern on the 20th of July. It's weird 'coz it's in Woodridge... and Woodridge it's kinda the slums of QLD. Well it ain't THAT bad, but all the rumours you hear... it's a bit scary. With the stabbings and robberies and all.

Oh well, can't do much can ya? Just worry about your car though... you'll come back to find nothing but a steering wheel left! 

Well I'm gonna go... thanx for reading if you are!

I don't think I can take another day of this...

I'm so upset too... yesterday I got my precious Taxiride signed and personalised poster laminated - or should I say contaminated! The guy (who was pretty hot, so I couldn't say anything... grrr) used an old piece of laminate, and all donw the left side of it for about an inch in is all yellowy-brown... not on any of the signatures tho - luckily! Got some Taxiride Doomben pix developed too which are so mad! That makes me happy - for now at least!

Umm... what else is going on?!?!?

Dad's coming home tonight so tomorrow I can use his laptop and go on MSN - which has been killing me for the last two weeks! 

I hope I'm not working tonight - I haven't checked the roster and I'll be in so much trouble if I do that again! I think I'll quit... both managers are on my back about shifts. Making me so angry - I applied for another job but they still haven't told me what's going on! I have a good mind to ring up and say that it's common decency to tell someone whether they have the job or not. 

That reminds me about yesterday. My friends thought it was weird that I said 'Common Decency' so we looked up weird words in the dictionary... like maladroid and paragola!

Well I gotta go... maybe update tonight!"

Well tomorrow I gotta go get my signed Taxiride poster laminated which is good + bad... I gotta bring it to school first :S :S :S scary I don't know what I'd do if I lost it... probably bawl my eyes out for a few days / weeks... I cried for an hour or so when I ruined my Garage Mahal CD. For weeks and months I'd kept my GM CD perfect and then it got ruined so you can guess I was upset!

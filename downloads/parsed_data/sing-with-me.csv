He walks, you say sit down, it's just a talk
He smiles politely back at you
You stare politely right on through
Some sort of window to your right
As he goes left and you stay right
Between the lines of fear and blame
You begin to wonder why you came...</i>

It's been almost two years since I've written in this journal. I didn't write in it much before, besides ""secret"" letters to you.  When I was reading over those just now, I realized how childish they were.  I mean, of course I loved you. I've told you that I always will. We were just so young. I always thought that I wanted to marry you...and in the beginning you denied ever wanting to get married. Then for some reason...you gave in. You told me that you wanted to. I believed you. I thought that the two of us would be together forever. Then something happened...and I lost you. I lost your love and I knew it.

<i>Where did I go wrong, I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life.</i>

And then I really did lose you. I'm not gonna lie, I saw it coming. I knew it from the moment you didn't want to stay at my house past 10 pm.  I knew it when you wouldn't say, ""I love you."" But I put that away...I believed that you would always want me. Then you did the unthinkable...you broke up with me.  I lost it. I cried for about a week straight. All of my friends told me that you weren't worth my tears but I knew that you were. You are my first love...and you always will be. I couldn't believe that I lost you. I knew that I did something wrong. But you kept talking to me. Then the next thing I knew, we were both saying how much we wanted to be with each other. Then right after that...the kiss. On your mom's kitchen floor. I loved it. It took my breath away all over again.  At that point, I didn't know what was going to happen. I thought that you just didn't find anyone better at college, so you came back to me. 

We came back for summer and shortly after you went to camp for the military.  I will always remember the day we got into a fight through text messages. It was the day my Grandma came out of surgery.  You told me that you didn't want me to change you. Just so you know, that was never my intention. More or less, I just wanted you to open up your mind to new possibilities.  

When you came home...you told me that you loved me. You can't even imagine how happy I was. We spent an amazing summer together, but one thing kept getting in the way: our beliefs.  I wanted to get married...you didn't. That would always be a major problem between us and we knew it. You were always a free spirit...you never wanted to rely on someone else. In some ways, I respect you for that. In others, I pity you. 

<i>Let him know that you know best
'Cause after all you do know best
Try to slip past his defense
Without granting innocence
Lay down a list of what is wrong
The things you told him all along
And pray to God he hears you
And pray to God he hears you...</i>

From the beginning of our relationship, you told me that you never wanted to get married. At first I thought I could change your mind...and I did. I thought that I would be the one to change your idea of marriage and spending the rest of your life with the person that you love. I've come to realize that I'm not that person, because if I was, you would have already let me know that. To me, a relationship is letting someone into your deepest and darkest fears. Whether your fears be the boogeyman or love, you let the person know that. You let the person get to know you in a way that not even you know how to. You let them explore your thoughts and you let them incorporate their own.

Bob, I don't think that I was ""the one,"" because if I was, you would have let me know. When you find that person, you will know it. It won't be a game with her, it will be the real thing. As much as I wish it were the real thing between us, I know that it wasn't. If it was, you would have told me about your feelings long ago."

I've been let down so many times.
and I was tired of hurting,
so tired of searching,
til you walked in to my life.
It was a feeling I'd never known,
and for the first time I didn't feel alone.

You're more that a lover,
there can never be another,
that makes me feel the you do.
We just get closer,
I fall in love all over,
everytime i look at you.
I dont know where I'd be without you here with me,
life with you makes perfect sense-
You're my best friend.
 
You stand by me,
and you believe in me, 
like nobody ever has.
When my world goes crazy,
you're right there to save me,
you make me see how much I have.
and I still tremble when we touch,
I know the look in youre eyes when we make love.

You're more than a lover,
there can never be another,
that make me feel the way you do.
We just get closer,
I fall in love all over,
Everytime I look at you.
I don't know where I'd be without you here with me,
life with you makes perfect sense-
You're my best friend."

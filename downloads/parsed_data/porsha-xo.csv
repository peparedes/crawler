i love my life.. i wouldnt want it any other way.. yeah, i've made ALOT of mistakes in the past and before i would think like 'if i could take all of my mistakes back.. i would in a heartbeat'  but now.. im glad i made thos mistakes, because if i didnt i wouldnt be the person i am today.  i would still be in the mess of my friends makin up lies and rumors about people.. i'd have backstabbing friends.. i'd be the one who was dropped in a min. when someone better or more 'popular' came along.. but most importantly.. i'd be the gurl who was never true to herself.  i didnt even realize that i was all caught up in mess til one day i woke up and realize that all of my ""best friends"" didnt wanna hang out with me anymore.. they started not invitin my to anything anymore.. and they wouldnt talk to me. yeah, those were really tough times for me.. but thanks to my true best friends.. i made it.. and im more happy then i ever was.


gosh i just hope one day they will all see it too.. life isnt about whos more popular than who or who has the best clothes or who has the most money.. its about bein yourself and havin so much fun doin it.. im just tryin to tell you guys what i think is the right thing to do.. you can make whatever you want of this..."

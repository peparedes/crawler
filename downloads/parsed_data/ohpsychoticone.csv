"event","YAY! I finished the sixth Harry Potter book, Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince. I caught many errors. I have quite a few ideas for the next book. I didn't really like this one as much as the first three. The fourth and fifth were okay, but the sixth was a huge disappointment. Ah well what ya gonna do. 

I slept over at my dad's house last night. We watched the movie Wrong Turn, quite creepy, though the effectiveness(is that a word) of being creepy wasn't as great as it could've been as my dear father was quite drunk and wouldn't shut the hell up. 

I finally got a hold of Nathan. I believe he really hates me. He made me cry. I can't believe he would think that I would stoop to something so low. I told him to believe what he wants. I am still quite worried about him, though. *heavy sigh*

"event","Okay, I just got back from the worse camping experience of my life, it is even worse than the time I got lyme's disease. First night out I must have fallen asleep with my eyes open...again, because when I woke up my eye was swollen and there were two mosquito bites under my eyelid. The next night my eye was totally swollen shut. The swelling is finally going down and I can blink with minimal pain. I couldn't shower the whole time I was out ther... there was mold growing in the stalls and the water was this pice color...eww! The water had iron in it and I'm pretty sure thats not all... I found out I'm a natural at canoeing. My sister is deathly afraid of spiders... and there were a lot of daddy long legs so she kept calling me to get them... I was getting sick of being interupted so I grabbed two and put one in my sister's bed and the other on her head...hey I rhymed!, needless to say I couldn't sleep in the same tent after that so I slept in the van with the doors locked tight... it was totally worth it! I have so many fricken mosquito bites and about seven fly bites. I finally stopped biting my nails! yay *waves flag* go me"

My mom is pissed at me... so she made this weird rule where I can't call any of my friends but I can talk to my friends if they call me. W/e. so I wait. my sister Andrea bought me the Phantom of the Opera for a belated b-day present. Nathan is mad at me for some reason... he said something about me pretending to be my cousin or something... no idea what he was talking about, but he doesn't believe me. god i'm bored.

on friday i went and saw STARWARS REVENGE OF THE SITH with TC and Kyle... it was AWESOME. I saw Jenny on my way out...

"event","I don't know how well I can put my memories into words...to get the full effect you'd have to enter my mind...but that would be a suicide trip.

Lets see. It was the last day of kindergagrten. My grandma simmerman picked my half sister Andrea and I up from school and took us to our new house, where we met our new neighbors. They had one son. I won't say his name. We soon became great friends. We played together every day and almost every night come summer we'd play ghost in the grave yard. In my back yard was a little red shed thing with a bunkbed. Megan always got the bottom and the boy and I would always fight over the top. It would usually result in him getting to stretch out and me being stooped over sitting. One day I decided I was going to lay down too. For fear of falling off the narrow bed... again... I layed half on him. He looked up into my face and I looked down into his. Suddenly he said kiss me. Surprised, I reeled back. What? i asked shocked. Kiss me he said again. I don't know why, but I leaned down and kissed him. I don't recall what happened after that. Long story short: that happened near the end of second grade for me third for him. Not long after that my parents got divorced and I had to move again. I don't remember saying goodbye. We didn't keep in touch, but I wish to everything we did. Maybe then he wouldn't have forgotten me. How could he forget me after everything we'd been through together? Oh well. It's obvious he has forgotten me, but his mom didn't. Oh well. I have a ton of memories of him i'll be adding later. This one is just one of my favorites. Geez, I sound like I have a crush on a memory. He's not the same anymore. We've both changed. I just wish he'd remember me. But whats the use?"

I feel happier now, I'm avoiding my mum, she's doing the same to me. I'm kind of worried about this summer. I won't be able to escape to school, and I can't guarantee that I'll be able to leave the house. At least she works.  I'm glad the only scars she leaves behind on me now are hust emotional...Its hard explaining where some bruises come from. I have permissin from my dad to move in with him for one week out of the whole summer...his wife wouldn't allow more. Hn. When did my life get so...ugh!

Feh, I give up. I just don't care anymore. Keh."

After my last entry she told me I don't deserve to be loved by anyone. I have been contemplating over this since then and I have come up with the realization that she's right...I don't deserve it...I don't deserve anything. People tell me they love me...but I don't see why. I'll just do what I have been doing for years...let others see I'm happy by faking it. I haven't been truly and genuinely happy for awhile. Not that any of you care... I'll stop my complaining and self loathing/pitying now and sign off."

I swear she's a 16 year old in a 45 year olds body. She just dissed me and my dad. She said I'm not her real daughter and that my dad doesn't really love me, he just puts up with me because he's drunk all of the time. I'm now grounded. I can hear her telling my sister what a bitch I am. What did I do wrong? Why doesn't she act this way with my other three sisters? Why is it ALWAYS me? Is it because I act.. er.. am the outcast? I can't take it much longer. I don't know what I'm gonna do. I wonder if my dad and stepmom will let me move in for a few weeks after school is out... If not... who knows what I'll do."

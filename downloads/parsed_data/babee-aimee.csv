"event","message 
most people aren't sure of what they realy want in life. I received this 
letter from a friend on the computer, did what it told me to, and within a 
week, everything I had wished came true!! Here's an exact copy, this really 
works!!!! 

OK NOW SOME ONE SENT THIS TO ME AND I JUST TOOK IT SO NOW ITS UR CHANCE. 

*************************************************************

1. To yourself, say the name of the only 
guy or girl you wanna be with 3 
times! 


*************************************************************


2. Think of something you wanna accomplish 
within the next week and say it to your self 6 
times!! 


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
>> 




3. If you had 1 wish what would it be? say it to 
yourself 9 times!!! 

----------------------------------------------------------------------- 



4. Think of something that you want to happen 
between you and that 1special person and say 
it to your self 12 times!!! 


-------------------------------------------------------------------- 



5. Now, heres the hard part! Pick only 1 of these wishes and as 
you scroll down focus and 
concentrate on it and think on nothing 
else but that wish.

* * 
* * 
* * 
* * 
* * 
* * 
* * 
* * 
* * 

Now make one last &final wish about that one wish that you picked. 

After reading this, you have 1 hour to send it out to 15 people, and what 
you wished for will come true within in one week! 

u only get one chance!!!!! Now scroll down and think of your 
crush!!! 














Keep going down 






Keep going 









Keep going 









!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 


Did you think of your crush? I hope so, that was 
your last chance. Now pay very close attention this important message! 
Sorry but once read, must be sent. Yes, this is one of those kinda chain 
letters that everyone hates. This one has been going since 1863 and if you
break this chain, you will pay!!!!!! Remember that after hearing these 
stories. 

First Example: 
Take Barbra Wallace.. She was a pretty lucky girl, 
up till she got this same chain letter. She had a crush on the same kid 
since kindergarden. when she got this mail she didn't pay any attention to 
it. She just thought, no big deal. And deleted it. The next day her dad 
got fired and her mom dies in a car crash. If she would have sent the 
letter none of that would have happened and her mom would be alive. 

Second Example: 
Try Freddie D. Now Freddie D. was your average 
nerd. Had glasses, was short and chubby, was in gifted. All the signs of 
your total dork. He also received this letter and sent it to 51 people in 
the hour. Now, like Barbra, he had a crush on a girl since 3rd grade. The 
next day after sending the chain the girl confessed her love for him ever 
since 3rd grade. Freddie D. finally had the courage to ask her out, and of 
course, she had been waiting to yes to that for years. They grew up and 
married each other to live happily forever. 

Third Example: 
Now if you couldn't relate to the others, this'll 
get ya hooked. Listen to this. A kid named Jordan Johnson was just 
getting on AOL to check his mail. He was a quiet kid, not that popular but 
not a geek either. he was just normal. He saw he had mail from his 
friend. It was this exact letter. Now Jordan Johnsen was a smart kid and 
he knew what could happen if he didnt pass it on. He simply pulled a few 
friends from his buddy list and sent it along. The next day, about that 
same time, he got a phone call. It said he had won the lottery! then his 
dad came home and bought him a new bike! His mom bought him Nintendo64 and 
play station! His grandmother sent him a new computer, and his best friend 
gave him tickets to the concert he wanted to go to, Kid Rock and Limp 
Bizkit! Then he inherited a brand-new tv from his aunt! He was goin' wild! 
the next day his secret crush asked him out, and they have been going out 
ever since. 

Now, you heard the stories. I know which person i'd rather 
be, but thats up to you. I wouldn't wanna end up like Barbra but thats 
only me. We all want what we cant have but now's ur chance to go out with 
that special somebody ur waiting for. Take it or leave it. If you send 
this to- 
1 person- you will lose all luck in ur love 
life.....forever!!!!! 
10 people- your crush will say they like you as a 
friend......ONLY!!!!! 
15 people- your crush will say they like you 
20 people- your crush will ask you out! 
25 people- your crush will kiss you!! 
30 people - Your crush will have sex with you 
35 people or more- All of the above!! 
Don't blow it, it's ur chance to shine! Have 
everything u wanted, and more! Now, complaining cus u dont have any 
friends. Well theres an answer 4 everything. It's simple, just go in a 
chat room, pick some names and send away! but here's the catch.....you only 
have one hour to send it after being read. Please pass this to everyone u 
know and keep it going"

""Happy Valentine's Day""

[Intro: Andre 3000]
My name is Cupid Valentino, the modern day Cupid
And I just want to say one thing

[Verse 1: Andre 3000]
Happy Valentine's Day
Every day the 14th!
I don't think y'all heard me!
I just wanna say Happy Valentine's Day!
Every day the 14th!
Can y'all dig that?
Now when arrows don't penetrate, see
Cupid grabs the pistol (Uh, yeah, now, now lookie here!)
And he shoots straight for your heart
And when he won't miss you!
That's alright 'cause y'all won't believe in me anyways
But..

[Hook: Joi & ""Skreechy Peachy"" (Andre 3000)]
Ya won't believe in me, but you would fancy
leprechauns or groundhogs
No thank you, Easter Bunny!
(There's all this talk about Santa Claus, but see
love will rule reign supreme)

[Verse 2: Andre 3000]
Happy Valentine's Day
Every day the 14th! (You got it!)
When Cupid knocks at your door
You can't ignore me!
There's no need to run!
So, Happy Valentine's Day (Hey!)
Every day the 14th!
I may have it all wrong, see
If you know what loves mean, well
Well, somebody tell me!
'Cuz they just don't believe in me!

[Hook: Joi & ""Skreechy Peachy"" (Andre 3000)]
Ya' won't believe in me, but you would fancy
leprechauns or groundhogs
No thank you, Easter Bunny!
(There's so much fuss about Santa Claus, but see
Cupid will not be defeated!)

[Verse 3: Andre 3000]
Happy Valentine's Day
Every day the 14th!
Now I know your hearts have grown cold
And that bothers me
Now I understand 'cause I use to be a bad boy in my day
I know you're trying to protect your lil' feelings
but you can't run away
Oooh ooh!

[Hook: Joi & ""Skreechy Peachy"" (Andre 3000)]
Ya' won't believe in me, but you would fancy..
(Hey! Don't you supposed to be some kind of player or something?)
Bunny!

[Talking: Andre 3000]
Well keep on runnin', player
'Cause I got my good shoes on
And I got 'em tied up tight
So, you're going to find out tonightttttttttt!"

Breathe-anna nalick
2 Am and she calls me cause I'm still awake 
Can you help me unravel my latest mistake 
I don't love him and winter just wasn't my season.
Yea we walk through the doors so accusing their eyes
Like they have any right at all to criticize
Hypocrites you're all here for the very same reason.

Cause you can't jump the track 
We're like cars on a cable and life's like an hourglass glued to the table, 
No one can find the rewind button girl 
So just cradle your head in your hands. 
And breathe, just breathe, whoa breathe just breathe

May he turned 21 on the base of Fort Bliss 
Just today he sat down to the flask in his fist
Ain't been sober since maybe October of last year
Here in town you can tell he's been down for while 
But my God it's so beautiful when the boy smiles
Wanna hold him but maybe I'll just sing about it 

Cause you can't jump the track 
We're like cars on a cable 
And life's like an hourglass glued to the table, 
No one can find the rewind button boys so cradle your head in your hands
And breathe, just breathe, whoa breath just breathe

There's a light at the end of this tunnel you shout cause you're just as far in as you'll ever be out 
And these mistakes you've made 
You'll just make them again if you'll only try turnin' around

2Am and I'm still awake writing this song
If i get it all down on paper it's no lonmger inside of me threaten' the life it belongs to.
And I feel like I'm naked in front of the crowd 
Cause these words are my diary screamin' out aloud 
And I know that you'll use them however you want to.

But you can't jump the track 
We're like cars on a cable 
And life's like an hourglass glued to the table, 
No one can find the rewind button now

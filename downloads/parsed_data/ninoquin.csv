"event","<lj user=""merylinabarrel""> made a post today that brought old memories of hard time at Burger King flooding back into my mind.  Especially the memories about how obnoxious customers can be.

To be fair, there are many polite customers.  But I think the problem with the rude customers is that no one puts them in their place.  Employees are afraid of getting fired for standing up to them, and the managers don't care as long as they get the customer's money and look good for the corporate HQ.

Here are some things that you can do to deal with the problem:

Employees - Sometimes, we make mistakes.  I made mistakes at Burger King.  If a customer brings a mistake to your attention, it's cool to apologize for it.  You don't have to really mean it.  I mean, it's a fast food restaurant that handles a large volume of orders, so mistakes are bound to happen.  I don't REALLY feel bad about making mistakes, because the world is an imperfect place, but a quick apology is the fastest way to get most retarded customers to shut the hell up, sit down and eat their fucking hamburger.  If the customer doesn't accept the apology and goes on and on about it, or is rude or huffy, call them a bitch and move on to the next customer.  They may threaten not to come back, but really, do you WANT a person like that to come back?  They tattle to the manager, but the first time you do it, you won't get fired.  Probably the second or third or fourth time either.  You'll get ""verbal warnings"", and all that.  Maybe around the fifth time you call someone a ""rude-ass motherfucker"", the manager will write something down and put it in your ""personnel file"".  Ooh, torture me some more, Mr. Manager-Man.  You can probably get four or five of these ""written reports"" in your file before they will actually think about firing you.  THEN, if the manager actually decides to terminate you for real, it's OK.  You still have your self-esteem and I'm sure you can get another similar job within an hour or so and it's not like fast food managers check your references or anything.  Life is good.

Managers - If someone is being rude to you or an employee, don't pander to them.  A customer yelling is unacceptable.  You're not fat rednecks and you're not on the fucking Jerry Springer show, so customers need to learn to keep their emotions in check.  If they can't handle these simple rules, throw their ass out.  Remember, it's your store.  No amount of future business is worth your self-respect, and you can always get another job.  Don't offer them free sandwiches to compensate for an employee's ""mistake"", because more often than not, it's not the employee's mistake, it's the dumbass customer's mistake.  The customer is not always right.  

Not that I actually put any of these suggestions into practice myself - I was too shy.  But now I'm on medication that corrects ""Social Anxiety Disorder"" and I still harbor anger and resentment.  

Come to think of it, I bet it would be funny if I tried to get hired at Burger King and then see how long it would take to get myself fired.  I could probably cause a lot of mayhem before we even got out of the ""verbal warnings stage.

If everyone works together, we can make the world a better place."

"event","I've been keeping up with my exercising pretty well over the last few weeks.  I think that it's really helped to improve my mood.  See, since I changed medications for my panic disorder, I've had a few anxiety issues here and there.  I just didn't feel as good as I did when I was taking Zoloft, and every couple of weeks or so, I would have a ""bad day.""  This usually involved some low level anxiety and general grumpiness.  No full-blown panic attacks though, except for one the day my dad died.

Anyway, I started running, biking, and lifting weights a couple of weeks ago, and in addition to losing about twenty pounds, I've felt much better.  I can't even remember the last bad day I had.  Occasionally, I'll feel a bit dizzy for a second or two, but it passes quickly without developing further.

I may ask my doctor the next time I see him if I can step down to the next lower dose of Effexor and see how that goes."

"event","Hello all!  I'm back.

Life has been pretty decent.  I think I'm finally coming to terms with my dad's death.  I'm still sad, but I don't find myself thinking about the accident all the time now.  Sometimes I feel guilty, on nice sunny days like today, that I'm around to enjoy it and my dad isn't.  I realize intellectually that it's not my fault and I shouldn't feel bad, but it's just part of the grieving process, I suppose.  It won't last forever.

Another thing I've found out - there are many fun and FREE things to do, even in the suburbs of Indianapolis.  For example:

1)  Go visit the cats at the humane society.  Seriously, I can blow several hours doing this.  As soon as I walk into the ""Cattery"" (that's what they call it, I swear) they all start yowling for attention.  Usually, I'll take one out and let it sit in my lap while I give it some scratches.  They're so attention-starved that most of the cats will sit and purr as long as I want to hold them.  Sometimes the kittens will climb up on my shoulder and go to sleep.  Tricia likes to go into one of the little rooms that holds a litter of kittens and let them climb all over her.  :-)

2)  Sneak into neighborhood swimming pools.  Most neighborhood swimming pools have a prominently posted ""RESIDENTS ONLY"" sign, but I ignore them freely.  Especially since there is never anyone there to verify that I indeed live in the neighborhood.  Most of the pools are guarded only by a keypad outside the locker rooms, and it's easy to sneak in behind someone who knows the code.  They even hold the door for me.  I got this idea from the urban exploration site www.infiltration.org, which is a great resource for things like this.  See here: <a href=""http://www.infiltration.org/hotels-plunge.html"">http://www.infiltration.org/hotels-plunge.html</a>

3)  Classic video game collecting.  Ok, this isn't exactly free, but it's extremely cheap.  I like to hit the local Goodwill stores every week to look for deals on old Atari systems and games.  There are also a couple of independent used game stores in the area.  I can usually pick up a couple of cartridges for a dollar apiece.  Sure, the graphics aren't as good as modern consoles, but I maintain that Atari games are at least as fun, if not more fun, than the $60 XBox games that I've played from time to time.  

And now, I'm off to get some FREE food.  There are leftover catered lunches from some conference at work today."

"event","I haven't written in this thing in what, a couple of months now?  That's about par for the course for me, I suppose.

Anyway, the last couple of weeks have been pretty hard.  On March 2nd, I wasn't feeling well, so I took the day off work.  I was sitting at home, watching a movie, when the doorbell rang.  I thought it was probably a salesman, so I ignored it at first.  The doorbell kept ringing, though, so I figured I'd probably better get up to answer it.  Outside, I saw Bob F., a friend of the family who is also a sherrif's chaplain.  Didn't think much of it, since he's a friend of the family and we get together quite a bit.  Anyway, he told me that he had some bad news and asked me to sit down on the couch.

He told me that my Dad was on his way to work that morning when a tree fell on his car.  It went through the windshield and he died instantly.

My first though was that it was a joke.  But really, who would joke about something like that?  I knew it had to be true, but I guess I was in shock.  I just stared at the wall for a long time, trying to think of something to say.

Eventually, I composed myself enough to go get Tricia and drive to my mom's house.  Didn't make things any easier when we had to drive past the place where the accident happened - the tree fell in my parents' own neighborhood, so we couldn't avoid seeing things like the broken glass, the tree itself, etc.

Anyway, the next few days were a whirlwind of planning the funeral.  I'm doing ok now, but I'm still pretty sad.  It was just so sudden.  My dad was in great health - he exercised and took care of himself really well.  He was only 56 years old.  I guess I just figured he'd be around forever.

The thing that drives me crazy is the fact that if he'd left the house just ONE SECOND earlier or later that morning, the tree would have missed him.  I saw the pictures of the van - the tree fell right into the windshield.  It didn't even touch any other part of the van.  It's just an insanely improbable coincidence.

Anyway, I don't know what else there is to say about all of this that I haven't said to so many people already over the last couple of weeks.  Just thought I should document things here."

""12 PACK OF SLYDERS $5""

What's going on here?  Is White Castle referring to their own burgers as ""Slyders"" now?  I was under the impression that calling them ""Slyders"" wasn't considered a compliment.

How did this come about?  A night manager's joke?  Did someone else rearrange the letters on the sign as a prank?  Does the White Castle Corp. maybe have a sense of humor?*  Or did a focus group tell them that ""ironic"" advertising would attract the 18-35 demographic?

The world may never know.

* (Yes, I remember the ""Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle"" movie, but I don't think the White Castle Corp. had anything to do with creating it, other than accepting free advertising.  Plus, the movie wasn't really all that funny.  Except the part where they rode a cheetah, because cheetahs are fucking sweet.)"

"event","So, when I reflect on my life over the past few years, I can't help but think about my complete flip-flop on the entertainment industry.  Once upon a time, I wanted to make movies and live in California.  Now, I pretty much just wish that all entertainment-types and celebrities would die.  Even the so-called ""nice"" celebrities, like Steven Spielberg, who made that nice movie about the holocaust, but also remade ""War of the Worlds"" with Tom Cruise.  Needs to die.

I have never seen an episode of ""American Idol.""  Yet I still know many things about Simon Cowell, including how to spell his name.  How do I know this?  BECAUSE I HAVE TO READ ABOUT HIM CONSTANTLY IN THE NEWSPAPER.  Seriously, the exploits of a judge on some TV talent show are NOT NEWSWORTHY.  If I wanted to know what he was up to, I would just watch the show.

It's tempting, at this point, to just start making fun of celebrities or post candid pictures of them looking badly dressed and ridiculous, like a thousand other pages on the internet.  But no, I have realized that's just what they want.  Talking about them only feeds their popularity.  Instead, I present an alternate solution.

Celebrities are just like gods - if you ignore them, they'll go away.

Let's join together, for the benefit of all mankind, and IGNORE ALL CELEBRITIES.  Turn off the TV.  Throw away the entertainment section of your newspaper.  When someone says ""Hey, did you hear what that crazy Simon Cowell said on American Idol last night?"" just say ""I'm sorry, I don't know who that is.""  Support local entertainment, like theatre.  Or create your own entertainment.

And now I'm going to take my own advice and stop talking about celebrities."

Such are the perks of working for a school district.  I usually end up taking Fridays off, making every weekend a three-day break.

I haven't had much news to report lately.  Yesterday, I helped Tricia package and mail some things for her eBay customers, and in return, she bought me dinner at a Japanese steakhouse.  Yum.  I spent some time redecorating the guest room in my house - now it's my classic gaming haven.  I may post some pictures soon.  Basically, I put up shelves along the walls to hold all of my carts and miscellaneous junk, added a big papasan chair to one corner, and put up some pictures and posters.  It's amazing how adding just a few items of furniture to a room can make it exponentially more homey.

My panic problems have increased lately, so I'm back on Zoloft.  I'm hoping to level off at a lower dosage than what I was taking last year.  I want the absolute minimum needed to prevent panic attacks.  The low-level anxiety, I can deal with on my own."

(I wasn't, but that's because I don't have anything to spare - my house is bare enough as it is!)  Anyway, we found someone's 2600 collection - a six-switch model with woodgrain from 77-78, a 2600 jr., power supplies, switch boxes, 4 joysticks, a set of paddles, and 25 games.  Quite a haul, but the guy wanted $80 for it.  So I headed home, took a nap for a few hours, went back and talked him down to $40.

A sidenote - I hate haggling over prices.  Even for cars.  I feel so sleazy.

I spent most of Saturday cleaning the systems and controllers.  They were coated with 30 years' worth of dust, but I managed to get them looking a bit better with some rubbing alcohol and q-tips.  I also fixed a dead controller jack on the six-switch model.

Now I have four 2600s, and I'm running out of space in my ""retro-game"" room.  So I'm giving one of the 2600 jrs. to Tricia, along with my duplicate catridges, since she gave me a TV.  Rock on.

One of the most interesting <a href=""http://www.ghosthounds.com/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=207"">articles</a> that I found relates the story of Heady Hollow and its supposed ""hauntings.""  I had never heard of these legends before, but supposedly people who have lived in the area longer than I have know all about them.  The official historian at Conner Prairie is said to keep an archive of Heady Hollow-related newspaper clippings.

I know the intersection well - I pass through it nearly every day on my way to work.  Supposedly, an old school that stood on or near the site burned down with some children trapped inside, and on foggy nights, you can see the children's ghosts standing in the road.  Now, I don't believe in ghosts, but if the school did exist (which an article in the Indianapolis Star confirmed) it might make for an interesting treasure hunting expedition.

Some of the details from the article pan out - Tricia and I visited the site briefly a few days ago and found the old Heady homestead on the southeast corner of the road.  We also located the Heady Cemetery in a nearby subdivision.  The place was a bit creepy even in the daylight, due to the large number of children's graves and the fact that most of the early settlers of the area didn't survive to 40 years of age.

The only problems with searching the area for the remains of the schoolhouse are all of the ""No Trespassing"" signs.  I'm not sure who owns the woods around that area, but if I can find out, I may be able to ask permission to search.  Otherwise, I can try to sneak in from the other side through a nearby subdivision.  We'll see."

I'm pleased to announce that the production of the latest Syzygy Pictures short film is now underway!  It's called ""I Can Fly"" and it will be released... er, whenever it's finished.  Which may take awhile, due to the fact that it's a stop-action Lego movie and those tend to take some time.

Last night, I worked on making the <a href=""http://www.syzygy-pictures.com"">Syzygy Pictures</a> logo out of Legos.  Tricia was helping me, and it *still* took 5 hours to get it done.  All this effort for a logo that will be onscreen for five seconds tops.  Oh well.  It will look nice when it's finished, and I'm glad to have another movie project to work on.

This reminds me, I still have some DVD copies of ""A Musical Masterpiece"" left over if anyone wants one.  It's a kids' film, but I think adults might enjoy it too.  At the time, it comforted me to think of myself as a Dr. Seuss-type director.  Dr. Seuss famously (or so I hear) disliked children.  The quote I've often heard attributed to him regarding children is, ""You have 'em, I'll entertain 'em.""  Could be apocryphal, could be an urban legend.  Anyone know for sure?  Anyway, if you want a free movie, let me know.

In other news, I've been very tired lately.  I've been getting sleepy in the afternoons ever since I stopped taking Zoloft for my panic disorder.  I keep hoping that it's a side effect of tapering off my meds, but I'm not convinced.  Think I'll give it another few weeks and if things haven't improved by then, I'm going back to the doctor."

I haven't been feeling all that well since last Thursday.  Seems that I finally caught the bug that has been going around the office.  Taking the generic CVS version of Nyquil has kept me in relative comfort, but has made me very tired.  I took Thursday and Friday afternoons off to sleep.  (Well, technically, I just snuck out.  I don't have many sick days to spare.)

The weekend was pretty much a bust, although it was nice to spend some time catching up on sleep.  I did a little bit of preparation for a new stop-action movie between naps.  Mostly storyboarding and building sets out of Lego.  Tricia is mad that I didn't stop by on Saturday, but I was too tired to go anywhere.

I have quit smoking again, hopefully this time for good.  It's been almost seven days now without a cig.  My anxiety level has decreased, which is strong evidence that smoking was the root cause of my panic attacks all along.  Note to everyone out there: don't start smoking.  Really.  It's not worth it.

The constant updates on the radio and the web would lead one to believe that this is what people are going to be talking about around the watercooler for months.  Only no one I know has been following it.

For that matter, does anyone still listen to Michael Jackson's music in anything other than a happily reminiscent sort of way?  Michael Jackson hasn't been worth paying attention to in 15 years."

"event","Wow, another month has gone by.  I suppose that means it's time to update this thing.

John got married on the 19th.  I was a bit depressed about that - the number of bachelor friends that I have is rapidly dwindling.  Actually, I think the only unmarried male friend that I have left is Jeff.  Buh.  Anyway, I drank a couple of martinis and felt better about the whole deal.  Note to longtime readers: I have NOT become an alcoholic again.  Everything is under control.  :-)  Actually, I think my drinking was mostly due to the Zoloft, which I stopped taking a couple of months ago.  (Which is a GOOD thing - no more panic attacks, no more meds, and my increased social abilities have stayed around.)  I just go drinking once or twice a month now, instead of, um... every day.  The same goes for my smoking - no daily cigs, usually just one or two a month at social gatherings.  Go me.

I'm back to being happy for John now - he's on his honeymoon for two weeks, then one week of work in the U.S., then it's off to England for six months.  After that, he's coming back to Indy so we can finish up some movie stuff.  I'm a bit jealous that he's going to England.  I may have to go visit them, unless I would be interrupting their ""newlywed time.""  ;-)

Jeff and I went paintballing this past weekend - lots of fun.  I still have several little round welts to prove it.  It's very satisfying to blast the hell out of little kids who are cheating.  Here Come The Mummies are playing this weekend at the Patio - I think Jeff and I are going to try to see that show.

Other than that - just the usual.  Reading a lot, playing with my electronics lab, etc.  Oh, and I finally got a <a href=""http://www.tvbgone.com"">TV-B-Gone</a>!  I've been having a lot of fun secretly turning off TVs in restaurants and stores and watching people's reactions.  :-)

I've gotten back into my classic gaming hobby lately.  I don't actually play the games much - I just like to collect the systems and play a game here and there whenever I have a free moment.  That's why I love classic games - you can learn the controls and play a round in a few minutes.  I find that too many modern games require reading a 100 page manual before you can even begin to play.  My current systems: two Atari 2600s (one 2600 jr., one old-school with fake wood grain), Super Nintendo (mostly for Mario games), and a PS1 (for playing arcade classics compilations).  Plus the assorted emulators on the computer.  I've been considering getting an <a href=""http://www.xgamestation.com"">XGameStation</a> lately, to try my hand at hardware and software development.  I feel the urge to create some games without all the flashy graphics.  :-)

After Christmas, I bought an Electronics Learning Lab from Radio Shack.  I've been having fun with that - someday I plan to become an evil genius.  :-)  It's helped me understand how to fix things around my house, too... I've repaired a broken lamp, a garage door opener that had stopped working, and my old CrossPad from college.  I think the Learning Lab has already paid for itself.

The no-smoking/no-drinking thing didn't pan out quite like I'd hoped.  :-)  But it's definitely under control now - I'm back to what I would consider a moderate level.  No more health problems, no more worries.

I'm off Zoloft!!  I was afraid that when I stopped taking it, the panic attacks would start up again, but they haven't come back.  I was also worried that I would return to my hermit-like ways, but no.  I feel great.  I've never been so outgoing.  It's a little strange, but I'm really enjoying going out with my friends instead of sitting around the house doing nothing.

This morning, I called in sick to work (since I'm rarely sick, I have plenty of sick days built up).  Woke up around 10, went for a three mile run, did a little bit of writing, then went to the gym.  I've been working out about three times a week, and it's making a difference.  

Now I'm home playing with the kitties.  Not sure what I'm going to do this afternoon, but I'll think of something exciting.  I'm considering taking lessons of some sort - riding lessons, flying lessons, climbing lessons... Getting my pilot's license is probably too expensive for me right now, so I'm leaning toward riding lessons.  There are some horses that live on a ranch across the street from my house.

Just wanted to say thanks for all of the kind comments and words of encouragement you've sent the past few weeks.  They've really helped keep me going.

As far as my non-smoking goes, I did have one slip this past weekend.  But I got right back on the patch and now things are going smoothly again.  I think that I'm really going to be able to quit this time.

I was very social this weekend - spent Friday afternoon with Jeff.  We tried to do some go-kart racing, but place we normally go (Fastimes Indoor Karting) was rented out for a party.  So we went to the Cheesecake factory and had a good meal.  Cajun Chicken Pasta... mmm...  When we got back, Jeff and I figured out how to get my A/C working.  (I hadn't turned the A/C on since the house was built, and when I really needed it, it wasn't working.)  So we looked at the exterior fan and tried to pretend like we knew what we were doing.  :-)  We eventually found out that a switch was backward, and when we changed it, the air came on.  We rule.

Later that evening, Tricia came over.  Just as she arrived, I noticed a growing puddle of water around the HVAC unit in my laundry room.  So I called Arbor, who kindly sent out a plumber to fix the problem at 11 p.m.  Thank God.  Cleaning up the water was no fun, but at least the A/C seems to be working fine now.

Saturday - mowed the lawn, played some video games, got tired of sitting around my house, and called John.  He and Leann (his girlfriend) weren't doing anything, so I drove to Lafayette to hang out with them for awhile.  They are a really cute couple - John raves about her all the time.  This is just my intuition, which isn't always the greatest, but I really think they're going to get married.  I can just tell.  Which would be cool, because it means that John would likely be moving back to Indy, and we could get together more often.  Anyway, we went to eat at Texas Roadhouse with John's roommate Ebenezer.  (That's his real name.)  Afterward, we went back to John's place and watched Big Fish.  Good stuff.

Sunday - called my dad to wish him a happy Father's Day.  Went to Wal-Mart (Ugh, but sometimes it's unavoidable) to buy an edge trimmer.  Trimmed the lawn, washed some clothes, played with the cats.  It was a very relaxing day.  Later that evening, I went for a run.  I was surprised that I was able to run 1.5 miles after having not run in so long.

All in all, it was a great weekend.  I feel like a different person - this is how I've always wanted to be.  More social, less shy.  I still have some work to do on myself, but I'm making progress.  Life is good.

Till tomorrow,
Gray"

The bad news is that I'm feeling very jittery most of the time.  No panic attacks or anything, just feeling irritable and shaky.  Which makes it hard to type sometimes.  I'm still not entirely sure that I'm not getting too much nicotine from this patch, but I'm following the directions to the letter.

Problem: I took the patch off last night at around 9:00 to alleviate the jitters, and within half an hour, I had the urge to smoke again.  Hopefully things will even themselves out over the next few days... I hear that the first week is usually pretty bad.  Still, I haven't smoked in 72 hours, and my lungs are starting to clear up.  Go me.

The ""no drinking"" thing hasn't been as hard as I thought it would be.  I haven't really had any problems laying off the alcohol.  Perhaps I wasn't really addicted like I thought - I was just having fun and drinking too much.

Things are still going well with my panic disorder medications.  I still occasionally have random bouts of anxiety, but I haven't had a full-blown panic attack since January/February.  Yay!

My short animated movie had its big debut last weekend - 50 or so people showed up to see it.  It got a pretty good reaction from the audience, so that made me happy.  Shameless plug - if anyone is interested in purchasing a copy, send me an email.  I have several DVD copies left over.  It's kid-friendly, and has 30 minutes of extra features.  (Which is longer than the movie itself.)  :-)

I feel really weird about this, but... I bought a gun.  It sorta scares me.  I'm going to keep it in a locked case at my house and hope that I never have to use it.  Tomorrow I'm taking a shooting class so I can learn how to clean and operate it, but I don't plan to fire it regularly at a range or anything.  I'm not a gun person at all.  I do, however, support gun rights, with restrictions.  I think that there are legitimate uses for guns... though I never want to shoot an animal myself, I think that others should have the right to hunt, as long as it is done responsibly.  My decision to buy a gun is based on what I consider to be the main reason that people should be allowed to bear arms: as a deterrent against tyranny.  The thought of the U.S. Government having the only weapons scares me.  Don't take that the wrong way - I'm not about to start shooting people or organize a revolt.  It's more of a preventative measure to safeguard our freedoms.  At least, that's how I rationalize it to myself.

It still scares me.  Would I ever really be able to pull the trigger on someone?  I don't think so.

In other news, I've been having lots of fun with my new camera.  My main focus right now is night photography.  Someday I might even get around to posting some of the pics I've taken.  :-)

I found out recently that a female friend of mine that I sorta dated in college is getting married.  I'm happy for her, but it's weird.  All of my friends are getting married, and I still don't feel any real need to tie the knot.  Maybe it's time for me to grow up, but I don't really want to!  :-)  Give it time, I guess.

Well, that's it for now.  Hope I haven't freaked anyone out with my gun story."

And somehow, I was onstage with the cast - I'm not sure if I was supposed to be an extra, or if I had just wandered onstage somehow.  Anyway, during the live broadcast, I kept ruining the show by swearing loudly, using the actors' real names instead of their character names, knocking things over and basically just causing chaos.  I remember that I kept referring to Jennifer Aniston as ""Jennifer Anus-ton.""  She got really mad at me and said ""Don't you know how this show is supposed to go?""  And I said, ""Not really, I've never watched it before.""  Which is true.

Eventually, some producer yelled at me for screwing everything up, and he asked, ""Don't you know this is live TV?""  And I yelled, ""No fuckin' way!""

Also, I'm much more social than I once was.  I'd always been more comfortable talking to people one-on-one, rather than in big groups.  But now I feel more confident in group settings, and I've invited several friends to get together with me at once.  This is a HUGE step for me.  I've always wanted to be more social, and now it seems that the day has finally arrived.

I do feel a bit guilty - after all, my sudden sociability is mostly due to drugs that change my brain chemistry.  But I'm having the time of my life, so it doesn't really matter much.  I've recently gotten in contact with some friends that I hadn't talked to in a very long time.

I read that it generally takes several weeks for Zoloft to have any noticable effect.  Regardless, it's great.  Sometimes I can feel a bit of a rapid heartbeat, but it doesn't make me nervous like it used to, and then it just goes away.  I've felt much more upbeat and awake.  Also, it seems that my usual anxiety in social situations has decreased... which makes sense because Zoloft is also prescribed for Social Anxiety Disorder.

I haven't even started to take the full dosage yet - I'm taking 1 25 mg tablet per day.  When those run out, I will start taking 2 50 mg tablets per day.  Should be interesting to see the effect of that."

is an anti-anxiety drug that I only take if I have another panic attack
before the Zoloft kicks in.  Hopefully I won't have to take the Xanax,
because I'm not supposed to drive for several hours after taking one.  I did
take a Zoloft this afternoon, and I feel different already.  Like, extra
happy.  :-)  I'm not really sure that the Zoloft is causing the happiness, since it's supposed to take several weeks to have any effect.  More likely it's my relief at only having panic disorder, and not some sort of heart malfunction, but I'm not complaining."

"event","I finally set an appointment with a therapist to help deal with my panic disorder.  I'm kicking myself for procrastinating so long... I feel better already just knowing that I'll be getting help for this.  Tuesday is the day.  I've cut down on my chemical intake - no more smoking, no caffeine, etc. and I've started taking vitamins.  This seems to help, though I'm still feeling anxiety at random times."

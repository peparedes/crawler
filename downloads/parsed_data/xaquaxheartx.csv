"event","THE POSITIVE SIDE OF LIFE: 

Living on Earth is expensive, 
but it does include a free trip 
around the sun every year. 




How long a minute is 
depends on what side of the 
bathroom door you're on. 




Birthdays are good for you; 
the more you have, 
the longer you live. 




Happiness comes through doors you 
didn't even know you left open. 




Ever notice that the people who are late 
are often much jollier 
than the people who have to wait for them? 



Most of us go to our grave 
with our music still inside of us. 




If Wal-Mart is lowering prices every day, 
how come nothing is free yet? 




You may be only one person in the world, 
but you may also be the world to one person. 




Some mistakes are too much fun 
to only make once. 




Don't cry because it's over; 
smile because it happened. 




We could learn a lot from crayons: 
some are sharp, some are pretty, 
some are dull, some have weird names, 
and all are different colors....but 
they all exist very nicely in the same box. 




A truly happy person is one who 
can enjoy the scenery on a detour. 



Have an awesome day, and 
know that someone 
who thinks you're great 
has thought about you today!.. 


""And that person was me.""..... 



My Papa sent that to me :)


Ive been having an okay/decent day. Well probably should get back to cleaning so that I can go out tomorrow and Bunny can sleep over Thursday I think..."

"event","Okay so after school Friday I walked to Mobile with my sketchy ass neighbor (Matt) and we met up with Cara, Ami, Rachael (and ready kids im going to remember their names), Joey, Rishi, Eric, Pepe...and..uh..other people. After that Cara and I went back to her humble abode and... uh..I dont remember. Then we went to BlockBuster..Thirteen and Napolean. I deffinitally fell asleep around 9 30 in like the begining of Thirteen. And then I woke up and Cara was like, asleep next to me. I didnt even realize that she ever got into bed. Oh well... Then woke up and watched Napolean. Thennnn..... rearranged Cara's room. IT is BEAUTIFUL. Then went to Friendlys and saw Jason, and some little kids I dont know. Could of sworn Jason was high..but he claims to just be sick (that excuse only goes so far). Then whilst waiting for a ride we saw Johnny and JP...then Krissy. Then Pat picked us up and drove Cara home...then mi padres went out for mi tio's b-day party. Then mi madre got sick and they came home :( . And sometime before they got home I was completly stupid. Like..always?


Well..lets see.... Ive been feeling so strange lately. I bought a lighter today, and for some reason I really want to go do acid. (Which has nothing to do with me buying a lighter..but I did.) But I wont do drugs because Im a goooood friggin kid.

Okay plans for Vacation-

Sunday- Nothing/Clean (so far... due to changes)
Monday- Nothing/Clean (so far... due to changes)
Tuesday- Nothing/Clean (so far... due to changes)- *Maybe* Drama in the morning?
Wednesday- My beautiful Bunny is sleeping over. So chillin with her.
Thursday- Bunny is sleeping over again? Chillin with her..AGAIN :)
Friday- Ami? Maybe? I sure hope so :) (or could switch around with Saturday)
Saturday- Brittany? Maybe? I sure hope so :) (or could switch around with Friday)
Sunday- Something...I cant think that far ahead.

Maybe fit a trip to the mall in there? Possibly."

"event","Coin operated boy 
Sitting on the shelf he is just a toy
But i turn him on and he comes to life 
Automatic joy 
That is why i want a coin operated boy

Made of plastic and elastic 
He is rugged and long-lasting
Who could ever ever ask for more
Love without complications galore
Many shapes and weights to choose from
I will never leave my bedroom
I will never cry at night again
Wrap my arms around him and pretend....

Coin operated boy
All the other real ones that i destroy 
Cannot hold a candle to my new boy and i'll
Never let him go and i'll never be alone
Not with my coin operated boy......

This bridge was written to make you feel smittener
With my sad picture of girl getting bitterer
Can you extract me from my plastic fantasy
I didnt think so but im still convinceable
Will you persist even after i bet you
A billion dollars that i'll never love you
Will you persist even after i kiss you
Goodbye for the last time
Will you keep on trying to prove it?
I'm dying to lose it...
I want it 
I want you
I want a coin operated boy.

And if i had a star to wish on
For my life i cant imagine
Any flesh and blood could be his match
I can even take him in the bath

Coin operated boy
He may not be real experienced with girls
But i know he feels like a boy should feel
Isnt that the point that is why i want a 
Coin operated boy
With his pretty coin operated voice
Saying that he loves me that hes thinking of me
Straight and to the point
That is why i want
A coin operated boy.


Well isnt that the god damned truth."

Oh my number one fear- Living a life of lonelyness.
Which is what i feel like im doing.

Im glad me and Bunny decided to be ""best friends again""... i believe the conversation went something like this:

Me:Lets be Best friends again!!!
Her:Ok!
Me:YAY!

or something like that. whatever tho....the point is she has helped me through sooo much these past two years and for that short time when we werent close, i was more confused than ever...she is like one of the only people i can confide in..and get the HONEST truth..about anything and everything....or at least i hope i can...."

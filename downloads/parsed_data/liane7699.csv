"event","So maybe i don't have the stress tolerance other people have. like i care about people who have to work after school on weekdays and work weekends just to pay for school or necessities like that....but....like i don't really care if they are able to handle it and i can't. i don't compare myself to them and say ""wow, they have it so much harder than me...maybe i'm not so stressed out."" i FEEL stressed out and i don't care if other people can deal with more than what i'm dealing with. 


""i thought i would have a golden age. now it's miserable. raising up ungrateful people...hang out with who?! all christmas i didn't see you hanging out with anyone...or summer. always so lazy, don't wash your face, don't take a shower and just go through a day. Those with high grades don't spend a day doing nothing. they're always on the go. Have you paid? you didn't have to pay yet....pull her out. i don't want to deal with her. wasted $900. ......................................................................."

"event","M aybe i'm too demanding...if some poor, unfortunate guy ever ends up liking me and i like him back, i think i would be such a demanding, time consuming and jealous&nbsp;girlfriend. I would be the worst girlfriend, actually. If i ever have a boyfriend, i would always want him there...to be there for me, to tell me he loves me, to talk to, to hug...i would be jealous whenever he talked to another girl, i would be depressed if he's not online or busy, i would be sad if he doesn't call or txt me...When i love a guy, i think i could give up everything for him. Just to talk to him, i could skip eating, lose sleep, let my marks slip, wait on the computer for hours...i can't find a balance when i like someone. there's no school, no music, no friends, no family...i hate that. If he's there, i could live just like that. Maybe it's the hormones talking. i just wish a guy didn't have that ability to completely take over my thoughts, feelings and actions. A nice guy could completely take over my mind and my life would mold and fit to his schedule. Am i mentally ill? Do i take my feelings too seriously? Do those small, insignificant feelings somehow enlargen in my mind and i think too much about them?


Why was i such a retard when i was a kid? i wrote an entry years before about how Barnabas liked Tani and i was upset...and i wrote an entry on how i was feeling then wrote ""PLZ Tani don't feel guilty"" or something to that effect...OBVIOUSLY she would feel bad after reading my post but i didn't think about how she would feel. Why am i so uncaring and selfish?&nbsp;

I don't think i know how to love. i don't know how to love a person...i just know how to be infatuated with a guy..."

"event","isn't it that whatever you think of last before you fall asleep, you dream about? or something like that...cuz like if&nbsp;you're stressed about a test you would dream about it cuz it's always on your mind even before you fall asleep. i can't even remember when, but it was recently, i had a dream about you. it's vaguely in my mind now, but it was&nbsp;something like school was cancelled and i wanted to meet up with you so i arranged to meet, but&nbsp;i didn't know the bus routes and it was really confusing...haha, i don't remember it at all, but i clearly remember you being in it. Lately i think about you a lot. Nothing else to occupy my mind i guess.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;



Kayy, well i wrote that a while ago lol. i still think about him 24/7 and i can't get him out of my mind. i can't focus on piano cuz i'm thinking of him. i'm on the computer so much, just to see when he'll come online. idkkkkkk, i just...but...frig. When he doesn't come visit me, i get so depressed and it's all i think about. i don't want to be like this. I don't want this feeling all the time when he doesn't talk to me on msn or doesn't visit me at school or doesn't txt me to see how i'm doing. Being so...vulnerable? makes me...lose myself. No, i can't blame him for my lack of focus on schoolwork or these feelings that i have...that's myself. He...he just confuses me. i don't like not knowing how the other person feels -- especially him.&nbsp;

Be strong! Aja aja fighting! Don't mind him. He has a gf and he's probably just having doubts about their relationship and then i came along and messed him up. It's no big deal. We just stay friends who are attracted [at least i am.....] to each other and nothing more. Nothing can work out from us anyways...so might as well have that mind-set now before it's too late. Before i like him so much that i dig myself into a hole. What's gonna happen is that he's gonna continue with his gf...get married? And i'll move on. It's not like he's perfect and i can't live without him. I'll just keep looking for a nice, asian, christian guy who really likes me and not in another relationship. Yah. I'll just forget about him and keep going...might as well."

"event","&nbsp;i don't get it. you would think at least my parents would be glad that i'm not gossiping or spreading stuff. Even with them, i thought that they might be a little proud of my values and how i'm not like other girls&nbsp;who talk about everybody else's business without caring who they hurt. Now, because i'm not telling them stuff about somebody else's family, that really has nothing to do with them, 

they say ""you don't talk to us about personal stuff""...i've wanted to talk to them about Ryan for weeks. i really want their opinion and what i should do, even though i know they'd probably lecture [or in their words, 'advise'....] me about how i shouldn't feel a certain why and how i shouldn't think about it. if they stopped for a minute to think about how i feel and what i want when i tell them stuff. i want advice...i don't want them to judge me.&nbsp;

someday, i think i'm just going to move out...before i'm 18."

"event","So this weekend was supposed to be awesome because it was our youth fall retreat and it was going to be amazing&nbsp;since we were cooking ourselves, getting to&nbsp;know each other more, having bible devotions with the girls.&nbsp;<br />I come&nbsp;home and i'm happy but tired...glad to be home but <em>not in the mood to talk</em>; i had about&nbsp;4-5 hours of sleep&nbsp;every day. I talk to my dad in the car about how it went though i know i didn't really say much because i was tired and <em>didn't want to talk</em>. i guess it's my bad habit of when i'm tired, i get grouchy and <em>don't want to say anything</em>. My mom asks how it went and gets the usual response of ""Good"" so she asks more questions. i TELL her that i'm <em>not in the mood to talk</em> but i'll tell her later so she gets kinda grouchy and tells me to unpack and shower. At dinner, she starts asking again how it went and what we talked about; i said that some stuff were more private because it was a serious talk and really, she doesn't need to know, lest she uses it to guess who said what and use it against them. She does that but [angrily&amp;violently] denies it. Then she starts saying stuff like ""it's prolly those 'sissy' stuff...nothing spiritual, about God...etc"" so i start getting pissed cuz she doesn't know what she's saying and it just making stuff up; to get me angry? i don't know. She makes random assumptions and when i say that they're not true she yells ""DID I EVER SAY THAT? YOU ALWAYS TAKE THINGS TO NEGATIVELY! DON'T PUT WORDS IN MY MOUTH..blah blah"" But the thing is she DID say those things and it confuses me all the time when she says that she didn't say it and i start thinking that i just made it up. i know she said those things but when i say that she's being negative and i don't agree with her, she blows up and starts bursting all these nonsensical things and makes things 100x worse. She assumes the worst of people usually and judges them by one incident. The thing with J was that she was coming to our retreat but doesn't go to our church. my mom starts saying all this bad stuff about her and how she's only there for fun and to hang out; not serious at all. Of course, my mom doesn't know her and already judges the reasons for her actions. Yes, she probably went to hang out but she's also really serious about God and when sharing came, it really showed that she was struggling with something. Of course, my mom doesn't care and thinks everything girls talk about in a serious sharing is ""sissy"". And she asks why i don't talk to her.<br /><br /><br />I want to tell my mom things. I wanted to tell her about Ryan a couple of times but the time was never right and i didn't know how to bring it up. I wanted to ask for her advice but i'm scared to incase she starts rebuking me, telling me that i'm wrong, that i shouldn't think of such things, and bans me from seeing him. I wanted to tell her how nice he is and&nbsp;how he's worried about me...saying i should sleep more because i look tired; that i should wash my face so i don't fall asleep when i'm studying; saying he misses me; that he's waiting outside my math class for me even though there's half an hour left of class. But i can't tell her those things. i don't want her to judge him and therefore making me see him differently; i like the way i see him now and i don't want my perspective to change. I know she cares for me even at times when she says she hates me and wishes i wasn't her daughter. The little and the big things she does out of her way for me really shows her love. i just can't talk to her no matter how much i want to."

"event","&nbsp;i don't know why i keep my old entries where i was immature and embarassed myself without knowing it. How stupid i once was to, without knowing anything, debate on important topics that affected how other saw Christians.&nbsp;<br /><br />I'm reading a book. The End of Religion. It talks about how Jesus didn't come to Earth to start another religion, but rather to abolish all religions, the rules, and the laws that 'bind' us. He was very controversial and he always created scandals because his teachings were so 'out there' and didn't follow the old laws. i find that really interesting. It's like Josh says...Jesus would be kicked out of modern churches because of the words he speaks which sound like blasphemy because we are so tied up in the law. But...many others are considered blasphemous; 'false prophets'. Back in Jesus' time, the Pharasees thought the words that Jesus was saying was ""blasphemous""...if he was here today, would i say his words are blasphemous? would i be able to tell between him and false prophets? i don't think so. If a book is popular in a Christian store, the thoughts and ideas become the Christian reader. Yes, they do question..but because it was in a Christian bookstore and so many people bought the book, it's considered true. The End of Religion. What's written in there sounds accurate and so empowering as it gives Christians and non-Christians a different view of when Jesus came down and what he was trying to do. But how do i know if it's truely accurate? Bible passages are used, the logic makes sense and it gives a new meaning in being 'spiritual' and not 'religious'. i think false prophets sound accurate to their listeners; or else they're not very good at their job. If people were to believe in them...if <strong>I</strong> were to believe them...yes, it would be my fault...but can i not go to Heaven if it leads me astray? God looks at the heart, not as other people see others, so i suppose as long as my heart's looking for Him..?"

"event","<font color=""#ffffff"" size=""1"">&nbsp;I got baptized today. i said my testimony, i got dunked, i came back out. There were so many people there congratulating me and wishing me the best. so many of my friends were there too. But the only person who really mattered...was you. you surprised me and came to watch...but you were with a girl. And it got me thinking. She might not be your girlfriend; she could be your cousin. But that's not the point. When i saw you with another girl, it reminded me that you're in a relationship with someone else. i don't want to come inbetween or break you guys up; i'm not capable of being in her place. But i can't stand on the side seeing you with your girlfriend; be super happy when you talk to me and really sad when you're not there. I hate the ups and downs that come with you. So i want to give you up. i can't actually cuz you were never mine...but in my heart i guess to give you up is to let go and move on. i can't see my future with you. you're not the guy for me. i don't want to be the third wheel. i can't be just friends with you. so with all those negative thoughts, the only think i can do is forget about you and hope you don't come back. i'm too young to be thinking that i'm in love, though not about being in love. we're not 'meant to be' however cliched it might sound...we're not. So i want to forget about you and hope you're happy with your girlfriend and hope i can continue my life without you.&nbsp;<br /><br /><br />i need to return a book to you...i'll just give it to a friend.<br /><br />N =\= R</font>"

"event","<p><font size=""3"" face=""Bell MT"">What am i supposed to think when you say  ""I miss you"" and i miss you too. I can't like you. You're off-limits. You have a girlfriend, you're in university, you're 6 years older than me, and you're not the guy for me. Sometimes i get confused and I wonder if you're just playing me and leading me on; fooling around and flirting. But when i hear your voice on the phone and when i see you, all my doubts go away and i smile and get extremely nervous. I don't really like that feeling. The tripping-over-words, making-no-sense, wracking-my-brain-to-think-of-what-to-say kind of talking from me. I never know what to say to you and you don't have much to say either. Another reason why i don't think we're good for each other. Whenever i'm with you or talking on the phone with you, my mind becomes blank and the things i wanted to tell you sound stupid and insignificant. I don't understand how i can have so much fun teasing and joking with my guy friends but when it comes to guys i like, i can't. I actually can't loosten myself around you and just have fun and be stupid. i guess i care too much about what you think that i'm not letting me be myself. That's not a good thing, is it....

i wish that i could see you more. But when i think about if that happened and i did see you more, we would always be awkward and there would just be silences when neither of us know what to do. I always hear from my friends how they talk for hours with their boyfriends everyday...and i wonder what they could be talking about that there's always something to say. I really want to ask you who i am to you, how you really feel about me, why you like me, and about us in general, i guess. But i can't gather my courage to ask you. Who am i to ask you anyways. i could just be a friend and for someone you treat a friend to suddenly ask you about your relationship and if you like them is kind of weird. 

I don't know how you feel about me. This could be completely one-sided, in which case i would sound stupid and love-sick, which i probably am.

"event","&amp;i feel the need to write here again.
-sigh- my mind changes so much over just 2 months &amp; a few days...i'm so inconsistent. So unsure of what i want. And when i have what i want...i am incapable of keeping it.

So it ends up that i actually started dating the guy who made me miss him so much and made me have the worst&amp;best feeling. April 9, 2007. Exactly a week after i posted last. He was so cute about it too =] i swear, i was smiling the whole week =D one of those cheesy, wide, blushing smilies.&nbsp;
But for some reason, even though i liked him a lot, sometimes i couldn't really put up with him. He was such a nice guy and he would walk me home. But some things were off about it. Like whenever we hugged it was awkward and seemed kind of...unreal? i don't know. &amp;other times i couldn't put up with how immature he acted. Yea, i was immature at times and it was so fun joking around with him and chat with him for hours while neglecting my homework, haha! But at other times...i couldn't keep up with his happyness all the time. I can't be happy all the time. I have such mood swings and periods of time when i get really depressed about nothing. And it was like we didn't...fit.&nbsp;
One time though, while in Syracus shopping in an outlet mall, i could suddenly see us shopping together for...whatever. Like kitchen supplies, clothing, furniture. I could imagine myself smiling my whole life if i was with him. and it felt SO GOOD. Like my future was somehow more clearer and i didn't have to worry about it. I don't know what changed. After 3 weeks and a few days, i broke up with him. I said i wasn't ready - i really wasn't. I said i needed to establish better relationships with my family and with God - i did and i do. I said that i would regret it for the rest of my life - i will. But i didn't tell him that i just...couldn't keep up with him all the time. I'm not smart, I'm not always happy, I can't joke around and have fun.&nbsp;

&amp;now.
Now.
I am still a wreck. For a completely different reason. A completely different guy.
In one month he has made me the most impatient, jealous, cautious, confused, and angry. But he has also made me the most happy, confident, beautiful girl.&nbsp;
I never thought that i would actually like him. It was a shallow thing at first; very shallow. ""hey that guy's hot"" ""yea, he is ^.^"" Basically the first thing i said about him and after. He had the most adorable smile - and i suppose he still does. I met him at a coffeehouse and after, he said ""hi"" to me in the halls, but I approached him first, wanting to know the singer of a chinese song i liked but that my cousin had put on my iPod. After, i would randomly find excuses to talk to him. I asked about lyrics of a chinese song, what a chinese phrase meant. I asked if he was from HK and we talked about it - how beautiful but also how polluted it is. It felt so good to be talking half English and half Chinese to him. So one day, i asked if he was going to 30hr Famine since he went to the church that was also participating in it with my church. He said no, but wanted to know more about it. That's how i got his e-mail. So i sent him information about it and waited. I asked him the next day when i didn't get a reply and he said he hadn't checked his e-mail yet. i guess i was impatient? He said he'd think about it, but then days later, said he couldn't make it because he was volunteering somewhere else on that day. My other friend actually saw him there because she happened to be volunteering at the same place. We talked on MSN, but not really about anything. Then he asked ""Are you going out with someone?"" What a weird question. Who asks that unless they're interested? and he couldn't possibly be interested. So i said no. Naturally i asked him the same question. When someone asks you something about yourself, you would generally reply with ""and you?"" So i did. He said yes. I told him he should tell his girlfriend that she was so lucky and he asked why. Why? ""Cuz i think you're really cute and i think i like you?!"" No. So i said that it was because he was such a nice guy and had the cutest smile - both of which were completely true. Days later he asks if i like a guy and whether he goes to out school. Odd. Who asks that?? everytime it's ""guess who i like"" with a guy, i end up telling them who i like. And it's usually the guy who's asking. So i ended up telling him because i'm that pathetic. Guess what. Ends up he likes me too. But he has a girlfriend?! I was just too happy to think about it though. The guy that i thought was the cutest guy in my school...liked me. What?! So he called me, i think it was the next night. We talked for...3hr 10mins 40secs...according to him =] But within that...3 hr 10 mins 40 secs, i learned something about him. Something i hoped wasn't true and didn't want to know but was true and i needed to know. Being in gr.12, naturally one would assume the age would be 17 or 18 if they have an early birthday. Not even close. I liked (like?) a guy who is 22...6 years older than me. He told me his story so i understood how he got to the point in being 22 and still in high school. But to like someone who's legally years over being an adult?? What was i thinking? To be fair to myself, he does not look 22. He could easily pass for 18. I couldn't think of him as anything about 18 when i first saw him and after. But this was shocking. Being stereotypical, i had always thought that teenage girls who like their teacher (he could basically be my teacher at that age) were girls who just threw themselves at guy and or older men. They weren't normal. They weren't me. Till now.&nbsp;

-sigh- i have an exam tmrw, so i suppose i should be sleeping now. I'll pour my brains out later."

"event","<p><font size=""1"">So I am procrastinating again. Shocking. I have&nbsp;<strong>got</strong> to stop this habit of mine, but it is like an addiction - its claws have grabbed a hold of me and every step away feels like my skin is being wretched from me. But the longer&nbsp;I stay still, the&nbsp;greater the grasp it has. Either I stay and let it devour me...or I try to break away, and in doing so, become...torn. I think I might go crazy.<br /><br />I am mainly writing here because I am hoping it will help me focus - on something, on anything. I have also taken up not using contractions, as in my essay, I will not be able to do so. Good practice, I guess. They are a big habit. Now I sound funny. Wonderful.<br /><br />My mind is a mess...Sounds like the beginning of a poem. Perhaps I should write a poem, starting with, ""My mind is a mess..."" Perhaps it might actually be good. Hmm. I am a crappy poet though. Better let someone else come up with that idea who can actually write poems. =(<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Puzzling feelings.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Swirling thoughts.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jumbled memories.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;My brain might rot.<br /><br />Haha! Random poem [almost].<br /><br />So I have come to the point in which I must empty my brain, lest I explode. Which would be extremely messy considering my brain is mush.<br /><br />I guess I'm tired of waiting. Tired of thinking, wondering, dreaming, being confused. So I have come up with a plan and though I am almost positive that it is not going to work, I shall persist. I have decided to not think about it anymore. It is a simple plan, really. An obvious one. But it will definitely not be easy. I hate plans like this. You think it is easy. It sounds easy. But it is NOT. Like my English essay. One might think it is easy [though even in the beginning, I knew it was going to be a killer assignment. In the worst way possible]. It sounds easy enough, especially if the teacher has basically outlined the essay for the class and all the students have to do is write, find quotes, and support them [but I <u>knew</u>]. The teacher had also given extra time to work on this essay, which consists of two extra class periods, a weekend, and taking it home overnight. Yet still, my paper refuses to be filled with writing - the 1000 words that are needed are still lacking. But I shall desist. <br /><br />""My life is like a garden and I am only simply walking through it - missing all the flowers that decorate my way""<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -Natty, in her time of lethargicness and thoughtful thinking<br /><br />I really like him. I do. And yes, I know that my plan was not to think about it anymore, but it is hard, especially since I am missing him now. Tomorrow has become that much more grim - I shall not see him tomorrow. This...feeling. I like him. But I hate the feelings that he brings me.</font></p>"

"event","<p>-sigh- Feeling pretty dead. Not good. Especially since i have 3 labs to finish. Man, i hate science =.=<br/><br/>my [little] problem:<br/>My best friend...i love her so much &amp; she's always there for me<br/>My crush...he's the randomest person ever &amp; every time i see him, i can't help but smile<br/>One event...changed...a lot<br/><br/>I can't help but think what would have happened if they never met. Me &amp; him would still be in that ""i-know-you-like-me-and-vice-versa"" friendship [?] Haha. Maybe I should have done something earlier? Asked him out? But i'm not that kind of girl. Me &amp; her would still have a super close friendship with nothing and nobody inbetween.&nbsp;<br/>Now, i feel bad because lately i've been kind of un-responsive whenever she talks to me. It's not her fault. She doesn't know. Course, i've told her before. The me-liking-him thing. But maybe she forgot. They look so good together. She's like...a girl version of him. So much so that it's actually kinda weird haha. They're crazy, outgoing, random, and never run out of things to say. They're both the two ppl, aside from my family &amp; other best friends, that i [love] most in the world.&nbsp;<br/>So i asked him. Whether he liked her or not. But he's the shy type of guy. As if he would tell me, right? No. He wouldn't.&nbsp;<br/>His best friend talked to me the other day. Was asking how it went and how our 'relationship' was going [do we even have one? in the sense that he's mentioning?] Said a bunch of things which just made me feel...sad. Because all of this was before and things have changed. Asking me to the prom? Not happening [don't know how i would reply]. Saying that he liked me was a fact.&nbsp;<br/><br/>Maybe i should stop. I don't want to keep feeling this way. I hate love games.<br/>Me? i'm going to be a rock for the next few days. That, or i'm going to live under one.</p>"

"event","-sigh- so i decided to go back on LJ
nobody's posted for AGES and AGES...so it feels good that nobody would read these =]

so, i'm starting up my online journal again..
[and yes, i have to tell myself that...it's all part of the journal experience =P]
so much has happened since...whenever i last posted..haha!
omgg, reading through my entries, i feel like i could possibly be the stupidest person in the world...galaxy...universe.......whatever's bigger than universe =]
my stupid Depression entry from that time when it was Yuka -&gt; Declan &lt;-&gt;Lilly ...sad&amp;funny memories
my HP rant ^___^&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [ewwwwwwwwwww, Daniel Radcliffe in an animal-sex play, movie, thing....&gt;__&lt;&nbsp; -scarred-]
my anti-gay rant too...man, i was immature and had sh*tty arguments &gt;__&lt;
NOW:
i'm an uber lazyy person who, currently, should either be sleeping or studying her science
neither of which she is doing
ergo, natty WILL fail her science test...just like her math test...
i'm now a jdrama/kdrama/cdrama addict...and it's slowly eating away at me as i succumb to my overpowering addiction
dramas = my drug...not something i'm particularly proud of...would never have imagined me being this type of girl 2 years earlier.
2 years earlier, i had personality...not much, but i had it. i had goals, dreams, knew what i wanted.
Now? i have zero personality. Can't carry a conversation. No clue what i'm going to do in the future. Failing in academics and music. Procrastinate to the max. whoopee.
kay, i'm seriously not getting this science. No matter how hard i stare, the info is NOT going in. i feel brain-dead.
haha! in China, i went on a tour of Beijing with my family and a bunch of random people. One of our stops was at a foot-massage place =]
apparently, by massaging your foot or whatever, they can tell what wrong with your body.
Wanna know what my massage-person said? [masseuse?]
He said that in the future, i'm going to be stupid.
yup.
unless my mom purposely translated it to make it worse than what he said..
but he had a very serious look on his face. What could i do? i laughed.
Now i'm beginning to think he had something there...i think i am getting stupider. my brain is slowly, but surely, disintegrating [can it do that?]

i'm hungry

i always get hungry after 12 am.
since right now is 1:06, i think i can pronounce myself very hungry =]&nbsp;

i miss it a lot. We had fun. Goofed off. Pretty good friend. On MSN anyways. But who can trust that? i know now that i can't.&nbsp;
Friendships come and go. But yours i miss the most. You brought out a different side of me. a funner side, i suppose. Me, the uninteresting girl always caught with a book. You loosened me. And then let me go. I can't wind myself up again. Worse, i can't live being loose without you with me. But you refuse to, so i must cope with living like this. Have you not noticed me, from the corner of your eye? Has the pitiful girl sitting in a crowd by herself not caught your attention? Will these feelings that i torment myself with everyday that i see you, never go away? i don't want to live like this. nor do i want you back. i'm afraid. though it was short, i thought perhaps you were the one who could unravel me. Not leave me half-naked, standing on your driveway in the winter. It was winter. Christmas. Man, i miss that year. i miss everything that happened.&nbsp;And i miss you."

<P>I'll bring You more that a song, for a song in itself, is not what You have required. You search much deeper within, through the way things appear, You're looking into my heart.</P>

<P>Baptisim is like a marriage with God. It's a commitment made saying that Jesus/God is your Savior and when you get baptized, you tell/ show&nbsp;it to the congregation. Im saying this cuz i was thinking about getting baptized...<U>maybe&nbsp;.</U> Val, how was it for you? Were you nervous? Did you hafta feel 'ready' to make this commitment? Our church does baptisims on Easter, in the summer, and Christmas right? Do you think Im ready Val? If i am.. what time should i do it at? Im so worried...Val...reply soon!</P>

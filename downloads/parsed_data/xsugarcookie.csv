<P>anyways..sam is letting me borrow her jean skirt to wear .. im excited--its cutee...thanks &lt;3</P>
<P>we dont go to school tomorrow till 10:30..and i was guna have a sleepovaa with abigail n everyone..but i asked my mom to pick me up early--jut cuz i was in a bad mood n whatnot..and she thinks i shuldnt go out if i dont feel good..grrr</P>
<P>anyways..im kinda hoping this hurricane hits us..but im kinda scared at the same time..i was just picturing like..looking down the hall and seeing my room and everything in it gone..that wud suck soo bad..everything i own is in there..and it wud be sooo gay to have to blown away n ruined. but yeah..</P>
<P>i went home around 12:30..and chilled..and i told dustin n andre id still pick them up..so i went to school with my mom and they werent there..turns out they got a ride home from someone else..now my moms pissed at me for taking up 45 minutes of her day to sit in the parking lot for nothing.</P>
<P>im kinda depressed // pissed off // angered right now..and the cramps and hotflashes <EM>arent</EM> helping..i really wish i had a boyfriend..and i hate how c<U>ertai</U>n people always give me dirty looks when they dont even know me..i wish my hair would grow--cuz im feeling soo ugly everyday..i found a picture from 7th grade..and my hair was soo long and (not to sound conceded) -- but it looked soo pretty...and i just wish it wud show me some sign of any growth..cuz ive been buying all this *hair growing shampoo*..*hair growing hot oil treatments* and in the shower ive been scrubbing little circles on my scalp to stimulate growth..and i only&nbsp;see like..a milimeter of my roots...and it sucks..cuz all my friends are growing their hair now too..and theirs is already longer than mine..and ive been trying to grow mine since summer..grrr its really irratating and it also kinda bugs me cuz i always had short hair//they had long hair..and they all cut it short..so i decided to grow mine long..and now were all guna look the same..cuz theyre growing it out too..and i wana keep it short now cuz i dont wana look like everyone else..but i wana grow it for me*not for them..so whatever..but anyways..im guna go and find something to do..bye</P>

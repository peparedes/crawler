"event","Alright so it's a month later.  I'm not even sure if anyone reads this anymore.  school starts in a couple of weeks.  Summer has gone by so fast.  I'm anxious to get my schedule for this year though.  I'm somewhat excited to be a junior.  One year closer to college, and sooner or later i'll be able to drive legally.  I can not wait!!!  I had so much to write a few minutes ago..... yea but that was then. 

I've been going to my moms work a lot.  It's so much fun.  I get to see my little Randy look alike.  I love malik.  Omg he's soooo friggin adorable.  I'm so upset he won't be there next summer.  :( tear

Two of my aunts are having surgery this week.  One tomorrow, and one on thursday.  It's going to be crazy, considering i'm at the barn from tomorrow until probably....the 28.  Which kind of sucks because it's me and umm me 24/7.  Maybe Tommy and Joel will come and work.  At least Joel entertains me.

The 27 I have my Finals for riding.  I'm soo excitied.  But i have to have a lesson with Paul which is scary.  I've been going to him since i was about 7 and he still intimates me.  Oh well.

adios.  sorry for whom ever read this and was bored. lol"

Had an expirence that i never want to have again at the mall with jenna and her lil buddy who i hate to death. Ben is just getting better. He's been lame for 3 weeks and we couldn't find anything wrong. So he's going to get his coffin bone injected and hopefully we will be riding soon. Katie has been working a lot and went away so i haven't talk to her much. I've mostly been hanging out with Taylia. Julie once in a while but thats about it. Everyone seems to be pretty busy, or disappeared...

Fourth of July was ok.  I had fun with Julie. It wasn't as good as last year. Our poor picnic table was ruined :( lol but we met a kid name Dave from Alabama. He was kewl. Except he didn't start to talk to us until the fireworks. But thats ok. Hopefully we'll see him next year. 

i'm heading to bed sooner or later. I'm having a wonderful conversation with Matty so it's going to take me a while to leave...lata"

At least i'll have my friends. Hopefully.  With the way things are going..i'm not sure.  I've become really close with Tay, ash, and jenna. You guys have helped me with so much stuff. I'm not sure how i could have gotten through some of it. Other people too.  Don't be offended if i didn't put ur name in here.  I love ya just as much. I hate the feeling when a beautiful friendship starts fading.

Julie G- I love you soo much. I will always be here for u, even if i'm not the person u confind in anymore. I'm not sure what happened to us.  We're not close like we used to be. I wish i knew why. I want to fix it. You've become friends with idk..better people and i'm not fitting in with them. I never wanted you to change, but you have. It's not that i don't like it. and even if i didn't my opinion is not important. I'm sorry for everything i have done. I'm sorry for annoying you. I'm sorry. I'm going to try to be a better person somehow. You know u can tell me when i'm annoying. And i don't wanna hear that ur too nice to do that. lol I love you so much. i hope u know that.

Alex- I don't know what happened. I don't really want to know anymore. I know what ticked u off now. I don't know why u automatically assumed bc of what i said i wanted to break pat and erin up. The thought never crossed my mind. I'm sorry that u thought that. I don't' know why you didn't say anything to me. We're friends(well idk what u consider us now)and i tried to be there for you when u let me be.  We became closer then we were, or at least i thought we did. Sometimes you say things that hurt my feelings, and i know you don't mean to do it, or realize that you do, i should probably have said soemthing when it happened but i didn't want u to be mad at me. Doesn't matter anymore.ily any


now that u've read that stuff that will probably cause another problem in some way. i'm going to stop while i'm ahead..."

I had a dream that a man was trying to kill me tho. =( I was at the barn all week and didn't come home until..sunday night around 930ish.  I had gone to The Almans to eat passover dinner.  That was fun. There is like more food then at thanksgiving.  I didn't think i was going to eat for a week.  I haven't talk to him in a while..i saw him twice today. That made my day, considering i haven't seen him in 2 weeks.  Nor have i talk to him.  He's a busy boy.  What can i say. o well.  I don't know why i still like him.  It's been two years.. and nothing really which is kind of understandable.  Whatever. 

Oh i must tell everyone about tay tay and ashley when they came to the barn with me a couple of weeks ago.  It was hilarous.  We went to ride and Ben was a space cadet..so i walked with  him..then ashley just went off on her own.  My uncle thinks they're hilarous.  Ashley didn't know his name so she said ""Your funny mister. whats ur name?""  and then she was calling him Uncle bobby joe...i guess u had to be there.

I def. have a thing for mikes.  Cept this one is a tiny bit to old for me.  ek not a lot older but he's been outta high school for 6 years. lol..w.e it's nothing he's just a sweet heart and wicked cute.  He was with tommy at the barn helping him build the doors.  Well he was helping until i came out.  tehehe I'm just really stuck with one mike.  Even though i don't think i should be.

"event","Yesterday was the weirdest friggin day ever.  From last period until 7ish.  First one of my friend's continued to tell me that he was going to come over when i got home.  Which i wouldn't have minded but i promised a few friends i wouldn't bother with him anymore.  No worries guys he didn't come over.  Then i was chatting with another friend online.  We never really talked since the one time we hung out.  After that i lost some respect to him.  He wanted to hang out but i didn't think it was a good idea.  But what he was doing at the time, i soo wanted to join in.  But i didn't.  Then i had a very unexpected visit from my ex.  I just stood in the living room, stunned.  I thought i was going to die.  My mom never said anything expect ""STAY DOWN STAIRS"" so i sat on the couch, shaking, and nervous as hell. I was happy when he left, considering it took me a while to get over him. Then he just shows up.  UGH then my mom proceeding to as me why he came.  Like i know why.  He said he missed me, and shit. But w.e.  I'm over him.  Later that night when i was back in my room in shock still, i had a WONDERFUL conversation with my love.  It made my night soo much better.  I sat there in astonishment(spelling) over what he was saying to me.  Most of the time i talk to him and i'm saying to myself he's bullshiting with me and i'm surprised he even knows i'm alive.  I still don't know for sure.  But last night made me believe that he does.  Idk... i have soo much to think over about last night. 

It is almost lunch time. I have 3 mins I think. I might update more when i get back.  I have nothing better to do this period.  I'm lost without Jenna."

Thursday we switched classes. I'm soo happy not to have Mrs. adam long anymore. Now i have Bio, computer apps, english and history long. History won't be so bad now, we have a student teacher so maybe, just maybe that class will get better.

I am sooo sick of this snow. There is way to much and it gets in my way of going places. Oh yea walking home isn't easy either. no sidewalks what so ever. and it's terribly cold out.

"event","It's soo cold and of course it had to snow yesterday. Because of the snow i had to stay in coventry. It was sooo boring. Today i wanted to come home around..3 but no i had to wait until 530. 

Christmas was ok. It doesn't make me excitied anymore like it used to. I opened my gifts around 830 with my parents. I knew what most of the stuff was bc i was there when she bought it. The rest was little things. It wasn't bad, my brother wasn't home so it was even better. Surprisingly he bought me earings and a necklace. I didn't get him anything but thats ok. I made him a soup bowl in art, so he;ll have to deal with that.


I need to go to the mall this week. Maybe tay tay and i will go, bc we both need to. I havne't hung out with anyone yet. I've been busy but not really. It's kinda boring with out school. Expecially if you can't go anywhere without having to drive. Ugh 

Dave is home. Actually he's been home for a while. I wanna hang out with him, but i don't think he wants to. Oh well. :("

"event","yey! i love christmas! lol not really...i like the vacation. Tonight i went to my aunts house for dinner and presents. I have such a headache. Logan was running around like a maniac screaming and mike brought a santa that sang. Ugh..major headache. My uncles brother eddie came with his son matt. I dont' know if he's considered my cousin though. He reminds me of joey. when he came in i swear to god it was joey and i was like wtf is he doin here. But then i realized it wasn't.some reason i was thinking about him a lot though.... wow so dumb. lol. I liked  my gifts though. My grandma and grandpa gave me a silver cross, a nice blanket and money. My auntie dawn gave me..2 pairs of shoes. Everyone else just gave me money i think. Which i'm fine with.

Tomorrow i get to go to my grammys which might be fun. I'm bring some movies that my cousin can't watch so i'll be alone. Cept that might be a bad thing. Random things pop into my head..and i sit alone going through sitautions<spelled wrong?> It sucks bc most of the time i wish they would happen, but they don't. And i must say that guys suck ass. not all but they ones i like. well liked. i dunno. w.e they suck.


okay, i'm gunna go and talk to nick and joey.

I dont think anyone knows how much i hate my brother. I come home to find him in my room, on the computer...downloading a bunch of shit he won't use. OMG then he just sits there doing what ever. Meanwhile i'm swearin my head off at him to get out and clean the mess he made. I left and my room was spotless. I come back and there is papers all over the floor...blah blah blah. AHHH i wanna SCREAMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM.

I forgot to add before how my day ended up sucking after lunch. Ok first i had math long...yuck. First lunch with Marissa, ashley, jenna, jenny and snuffs bc she had inhouse again. I was talking to marissa and out of know where this kid i liked popped up. She said that this other person told her the he was coming over my house and was gunna get some action. The first time i really hung out with him i didn't think it was for that. but yea i'm dumb...then talking to him more i can tell thats all he wants. which is kinda sad bc i liked him. ugh w.e....
where is dave when i need him? some where in RI but not anywhere i can get him. lol

I would of gotten a better grade in Tvenstrups class if i hadn't forgotten to hand in 2 assignments. Math..well i just suck at math...which explains it all.

playing the fool &
wearing all of the latest fashions
or bucking the new trends
wearing your old threads.
If you like coffee in the evening
These are a few things that I'd like to know
that I'd like to know""

So I say...
""I've been scheduled to work but I'll call in
and my friend isn't busy
he'd be happy to join me
and maybe my friend
and your friend
will hit it off or maybe we will?""

I'm dying to know
do you do you like dreaming of things
so impossible or only the practical
or ever the wild or waiting through all your bad bad days
just to end them with
someone you care about
or do you like making out
and long drives and brown eyes
and guys that just
don't quite fit in
yeah do you like them
So yes, I'll see you there."

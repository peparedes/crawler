"event","A friend of mine lives in SoHo, and she told me SVU was filming right on her street, so of course, after work, Shauna (<div class=""ljuser""><a href=""http://lilprincess26.livejournal.com/profile""><img width=""17"" height=""17"" src=""http://stat.livejournal.com/img/userinfo.gif"" alt=""[info]"" style=""border: 0pt none ; vertical-align: bottom; padding-right: 1px;"" /></a><a href=""http://lilprincess26.livejournal.com/""><b>lilprincess26</b></a></div> ) and i went. We thought oh hey we'll go watch them film for a bit. Well they were filming indoors so there wasnt much to see. BUT.. at dinner call, who came out right in front of us? Thats right! Adam Beach!! He was so much more handsome in person. He was being silly.. they had some pizza rolls and he says, very loudly I might add.. I LOVE TOSTINO PIZZA ROLLS!!... it was too cute. So after he was finished eating, I asked one of the handlers there if I could possibly get a pic with Adam since there was NOONE around watching the filming. She went over and asked him, he smiled and came over. I wanted to melt right then and there. He was like, Hi I'm Adam Beach! and shook my hand.. ohh it was so cool.. he was like want to take a picture?? duh!! so he posed with Shauna, then one with myself and one with our friend Jill.. he was so very nice! and short! hahahaa.. anyways he went back across the street, and a while later, this guy was standing by us. Lo and behold it was Mariska's bodyguard. He asked us if we wanted to meet Mariska too and I was like :O duh!! We had told him that we run Diane's website and he was like, I LOVE Diane, she's amazing! You tell her Tom the Security Guard says hi! i'm like :O and when Mariska came out he's like, call her over girls! I'm like, MARISKA! ....andddd she came over and we got pictures with her too! She was very very sweet in person. she's extremely friendly, she was laughing and she loved that i had a Fearlessness necklace on..&nbsp; She is even MORE gorgeous in person...she stayed and chatted with us for a few mins and then she had to go see August =)&nbsp; I thought it was nice of her to take time to take a picture with us, even tho she was on her way to see the baby. Anyways.. I am STILL stoked..

i have deleted a fair amt of people from my friends list now thanks to some insensitive person that i was ""never friends with anyways"" so in turn i am now making sure the only people on my list are ones that actually comment/give a shit and arent so fucking self centered that they feel if you are honest with them that they can fucking ignore you and ban me from your LJ/Life, esp since i knew you in person. Dont like me? great don't fucking add me. Im honest with my friends so if you are looking for someone to have a pity party with i will NOT participate. Im honest and i will tell you what i think, dont like it? dont care. Thats me, what you see if what you get. kthanx. 

dont try and add me without commenting on the the friends only post cause i will NOT add you back and will delete you again. 

/bitch rant. 

to all those who i deleted please remove me from your LJ, if you feel you were taken off in error, leave me a message and i will add you back. 

now back to your reguarly scheduled LJing."

"event","So Law and Order: Criminal Intent was filming outside of my work and INSIDE my work...the extras holding room was on the 6th floor right across the hall from us! They were gonna be filming in the lobby of our building later on at night, around 9pm lol so we didnt see that cause we didnt feel like waiting around, lol. We got to see some during the day and then some more when we were leaving work at night (that would be why some of the pics are REALLY dark, they wouldnt allow us to use a flash). 

The episode is going to be about a Rapper getting shot, you will see the ""memorial"" that they have set up. Also some of the pics are blurry lol cause they were going through rehearsal and constanting moving, plus ALL the people around kept getting in the way LOL. So I hope you like the pics that we were able to snag :) 

We were also able to snag a short vid of them rehearsing with Shaunas digital camera:)

Comment up at the friends only post if you wanna be added but again save the drama and pathetic shit for yo mama cause I dont buy bullshit and i can usually smell it a mile away...also no freaks, bi polar losers who are looking for attention, drama queens, attention whores, ect...

"event","pathetic people are funny. crazy pathetic people are funnier. the funniest people on the planet are those who are serious manic depressive, attention whoring, pathetic lying people. *sigh* it makes me laugh SO very hard. If ya wanna know who it is, let me know...cause im sure it will suprise some of you...but others not so much. Lying attention whores are always good to laugh at esp when we have convos about a certain person that this pathetic person is kissing ass too, wouldnt they like to know what you REALLY say about them....karmas a bitch.

ah yes and to this one person: eat shit and die.

"event","<p>I have made a resolution to practice positive thinking.&nbsp; And in light of such = so far so good!&nbsp; I wanna pop in the secret DVD before i go to sleep.&nbsp; Maybe subconsciously it can melt itself further into my thinking.<br /><br />Things I love about my hunbun:<br /><br />- The most hilarious person I've ever known<br />- Simple, meat and potatoes type of guy<br />- Likes to just lay around and be lazy = probably won't drag me out to hike and stuff<br />- The most genuinely endearing laugh I've ever heard.&nbsp; Something like a wheezing hyena<br />- His crooked teeth, chubby cheeks and crazy hair.<br />- The way he can interpret my numerous whines and grunts and gestures<br />- How he is ridiculously pale in the spots that are usually clothed.&nbsp; It's hilarious<br />- He gives an awesome massage<br />- He gives awesome lots of other stuff<br />- He likes to eat and likes me to eat<br />- The way he wraps his arms around me while we walk even though it must be somewhat uncomfortable considering the height difference<br />- He supports my nailpolish obsession<br />- I've drooled on him on numerous occasions and he thinks its more cute than anything else<br />- He's a manly man in charge and its really really really attractive<br />- He's ticklish but in denial<br />- The stache, man.&nbsp; Geez, how I love the mustache.&nbsp; Please never ever ever take it off it's so sexy<br />- He initiates the snuggle session<br />- His snoring is endearing and not that bad<br />- His huge....eyes<br />- His huge....love of me<br /><br />Power of positive thinking!&nbsp; I feel so happy already</p>"

"event","...not the greatest day ever i gotta say...its actually probably in my top 5 'worst days ever'.&nbsp; 

i am not really of delicate health.&nbsp; i can run miles, chainsmoke cigarettes, go on spinning carnival rides, drink lots of beer and horrible science experiments of mixed drinks (tequila = doesnt really go well with a lot of things) and still be able to not lose my stomach.

so how is it that i can get spontaneously, physically, intensely sick to my stomach when i think of living my life without you.&nbsp; so sick that i spend my entire first class with my head stuck in the toilet, losing my fucking gut.&nbsp; and the rest of the day trying my best not to think of the whole damn business so i won't throw up again.&nbsp; well i feel like i'm gonna throw up again.

you make this so much harder than it has to be.

and i do too. i'm sorry."

"event","i wish i had some sort of html talent. sadly, i can only manipulate hex color codes and make stuff <b>bold</b>, <i>italic</i>, or <u>underlined.</u> <br /><br />i am just about ready to pack my ass up and go home to my cozy little island. i do like it a lot here (= not hate it that much here) but i SRSLY ended up missing all of my jiggahboos at home. which is like 2 people. (but the BEST 2 people EVER) plus its cold and shit. somehow i came up here with 6 bottles of nail polish. and i will be coming back home with those 6...and like 17 more. well hey! some people like to collect stamps, or designer handbags, or gum wrappers. me, i collect nail polish. and by some great fortune of the gods i have ended up about to marry someone who not only tolerates it but actually ENCOURAGES it. squee. i love how he gets all invested in it. i know most guys would be like 'OMG WTF' (because guys talk in abbreviations) but not my hubby wubby. i am teh lucky. <br /><br />i miss my bestest friend in the entire world. and she is probably the only one who would end up reading this. (or IS she? dun dun dun) which probably is a good time to stop talking about her in the third person. anyway, steffy, you are the macaroni to my cheese, the tabasco to my pizza,(well <b>I</b> <strong>like it.</strong> you like that bold action? its html. i could make it underlined if i wanted to.) the jam to my jelly (they're kinda the same thing but that's okay. i didn't think you'd wanna be the PB. yeah me neither) i heart you so much that i wrote about you in my French essay. so it was like a French love letter. only that i didnt give it to you and i had to turn it in for a grade and our friendship came to mind seeing as the topic was...friendship. and i got an A. and probably not because of my ease with French grammar. <i>if you catch my drift</i> <br /><br /><u>THE END</u>"

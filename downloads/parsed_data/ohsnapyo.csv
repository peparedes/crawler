"event","All right, first of all, who the bloody hell is Justin Bass? Should I know you or something, are you in the band? I demand an answer. Second of all, my birthday is this Monday, and my weekend is going to suck. I've decided I'm not even going to bother throwing a party, because I have a feeling it's going to suck. Why, you ask? Go ask your mom, she might tell you. I'm in a state of hopelessness right now, because the one girl that I've decided I want seems so to be behind an invisible wall that I can't break, just like a bad videogame. It angers me. Grr. I've also come to the realization that I'm only as social as I am now and have as many friends as I do now just because I got hit in the face with a Peach Soda bottle, so I end with this:

This is to you, Peach Soda bottle

Because of you, I was invited to a party

Because of you, I have friends

This is to you

You opened up closed doors

You defeated the red dragon at the end of the dungeon

This, my friend, is to you

I was friendless once, but now, no

And you, Peach Soda bottle, being the reason so

So this is to you, Peach Soda bottle

This is to you"

"event","Yayyyy, update. Gah, so much going on in my head, it's like a nuclear bomb or something like that. Kinda happy, kinda sad. The happy part of my brain is telling me I'm becoming more social, more people are beginning to know me, talk to me, and i have more friends rather than just people I say hi to every once in a while. In absolute contrast to the happy side though, my sad side is telling me that yesterday I was running through trees, thorns, and tons of overgrowth for about 6 hours in Land Navigation for ROTC, because I was put on the expert team, and today I feel like crap. It's also telling me that I've lost hope in the girl that I liked for about a year and a half due to an event of which I would not like to explain, and now there's a certain girl that I like of who I've convinced myself I have absolutely no chance with, and of course there's another who I think I have a chance with but I'm trying not to take that chance for the sake of one of my friend's chances.

Gah, this is pointless, who cares about this besides me? No, must not say that, bad pessimistic Ben, bad. Nuclear bomb ASPLODE'D!!!

I'm sorry, that was really stupid. Oh well, done with this entry. Bye all."

"event","I feel lazy today, so I'm just going to paste what I put in my Xanga update:


I suppose it's time for an update. More people have visited my site than expected, but I demand more! Yep, (random change of subject) went to a party Friday night. It was ridiculously awesome. I mean, it was an actual high school party, and I was invited. Wow. We watched Land of the Dead and ate pizza and stuff. Yay, my cat calmed down, he was raiding my room and going crazy and such. But yeah, the party was fun, and as Wes says ""more intimate"" in a friendly sense of course. So, yep, that's all for now. Come to my site. You will love it, cherish it, embrace it. Raise my counter. Bye."

"event","Let's see, what to complain about today... oh yeah! Honors World History and P.E.(wtf?) Mid-Terms tomorrow. Actualy, I'm supposed to do the uber gay P.E. Test tonight or tomorrow, it just has to be turned in before the end of class. My day pretty much sucked. Let's see, I felt like a complete idiot all day, said and did things I regret doing, and I'm just really stresses and confused. Yep, that about sums it all up. I have to wear my Class B uniform for ROTC tomorrow, and hopefully the dry cleaners have it done whe my mom picks it up on her way back from work. If they don't, I'm royally screwed.

In other matters, how easy is it to form a band and get a contract with a recording company these days? I swear, there's so many freaking little emo bands with absolutely no talent popping up left and right, I mean, are so many people's lives that chaotic that they all have to go out and scream about it and make tons of money while doing it? For example, the new Hawthorne Hieghts song... ""I'll camp outside you're window with my radio!!!!! AAHHHHOOOOOOOHHHH!!!!! I""M SCREAMING TOO MUCH!!!!! ANEURISM!!!!!""

Seriously, what the hell? Well, anyways, I'm now going to go consult the magical Google for rules on the four main sports for Gym. Bye."

"event","Hello all, sorry for the late update, but much has happened recently. First of all, the ROTC Drill Team Meet Saturday morning went well, I supppose. Inspection went great, but the actual marching was just so-so. I found out that someone was actually looking for me at the Homecoming Dance. I mean, wow. Yep, so after hearing that, I'm sure you can imagine how much I wished I would've gone. Anyways, after that was the Showcase of Bands for well, of course, band. We did our show at 4:45 and I thought we did pretty well, I was thinking along the lines of 2nd Division. As it turns out, we got 1st! I think that's 11 years in a row now, and now that I've succeeded in not failing my Sophomore year, if the streak is broken next year, it's not my fault. Yay!

Yesterday was also in a sense, a day of new realization for me. I set a new goal yesterday, and I plan to achieve it at all costs. By my Senior year, I plan to be THE best player in the trombone line since Thomas from last year. He's become my new inspiration. I just remember seeing him perform last year on band night, both as a drum major, and as a trombonist, and it was fantastic. If it means that I have to practice for the majority of my days every single day until graduation, I don't care. I will be as good, if not better than him. I shall leave you all now to go contemplate in my lonely solitude. Goodbye."

"event","Why does noone ever tell me anything? Why, I ask, did noone tell me it was band mafia day today? It's things like these that I actually want to know, but I'm never told. I always know things I don't want to know, but when it comes to things I do want to know, I DON'T KNOW!!! Damn you all. Gah, this Saturday I have ROTC Drill Team Competition in the morning, then Band Marching Competition in the afternoon. It's going to be a long day. :sigh: I'm going to go play flash games with myself on the intraweb now. Bye all, I shall miss you."

"event","Yay! We got band uniforms finally today! Woo-hoo!!! I'm kind of mad though, 'cause I went to school for 80's day today at school for spirit week dressed as Tommy Vercetti, and it just now dawned on me that I could've gone as a skinny white version of Mr. T. Grrah! Sometimes I wish I could turn into a giant green guy with magically shape-shifting jeans/shorts so I could like smash things and throw a short bus into a crowd of people. Not the cool ones, like John, mind you, but the bastardly ones, like jocks in my gym class. Oh noes, I just noticed my laptop battery is at 5%. Must... find... charger. Bye."

"event","Well, I've uploaded a userpic now. Yep. For those who can't see, it's a picture of a kitten in a field of grass jumping onto a mine with the text ""PWNED"" across the top. I know this is going to anger a lot of people, but c'mon, lighten up. It's funny and you know it. You can't not at least smile at the subtle jab of crude humor contained within the picture. Don't say I'm cold hearted and don't have any animals or kittens in particular that I love or whatever, because I'll have you know that I indeed have 2 cats, and love them very much, so shut your dirty little mouths. :sigh: I'm trying  to create a really good map in Far Cry: Instincts but my brain is numb right now, and I have Go Go Power Rangers stuck in my head. Gah. Yea, so apparently, there's this thing on like ABC or something for Halloween that's showing a lot of movies by M. Night Shamalananiwhatshisname, and some other stuff. It's like 13 Nights of Halloween or something like that. Yep. Someone out there cares, and that's all that matters. I got my trombone out of the back of my mom's car, and loved on it some. Oh how I missed it Friday during the Texarkana game. It was stuck using one that Mr. Webb let me use. It was like a $25 trombone. I got kind of used to it though, I guess, but its definitely good to have mine back. Well, that's all for now, so ummm, yea, bye."

Yep, I need that, and a girfriend, which also probably wouldn't help at 12:12, now 12:13 in the morning. Alas, my life resides in AIM conversations like this: (prepare for eye sores and bleeding)

"event","Hello all, I have decided to bless you with another entry post, because even though you're afraid to admit it, you care. Finally got the last page in the marching show for band done. Turns out I'm in the very front on the last page, the point man. This could be a good thing, or a bad thing. I don't know yet, I'm still deciding. I also checked my counter on my Xanga that I put on there a few days ago, and 12 people have visited my site. That's right, people actually go to my website. Of course, I shouldn't be surprised by that considering Pamela Anderson's book is on the New York Times Best Seller List. Well, I shall leave you all now while I go to see if the intraweb has grown while I was at school. Goodbye."

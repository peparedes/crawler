"event","Victims burst into flames for no apparent reason and burn to death. In spontaneous human combustion, a persons body is reduced within minutes to a heap of cinders. Usual features are the speed and intensity of the process. It is also selectively directed, for example, leaving the extremities of the body unharmed and sometimes not even damaging the clothes encasing the body. The body is burned in its own substance, without external fuel, in which there is an absence of damage to surrounding inflammable objects. An uncontrollable burst of emotional energy that cannot escape from the mind out into the environment and which in consequence destroys the human being producing it. There is no record of spontaneous combustion in animals, just as there is no record of animal poltergeist activity. These phenomena are by-products of the highly evolved, complex human mind. Detailed accounts speak of bluish flames that can not only not be distinguished by water but are increased by it. The amazingly intense heat generated tends not to ignite or damage adjacent objects, nor to spread into any general conflagration. Body water makes up 70 percent of our physical structure, is electrolyzed into its constituent elements of hydrogen and oxygen, both highly flammable gases, which are some how self-ignited. Adding water is like adding fuel instead of extinguishing the blaze. What exactly causes this possible electrolysis to commence remains a complete mystery. Nevertheless, electrolysis is an electromagnetic phenomenon, and so the reason for the fire's containment or localization might be body's own electromagnetic field. Only at a very high temperature of 3000 degrees Fahrenheit do bones even begin to fuse or melt, let alone disappear altogether.

Since his 12th birthday a boy had been producing fires all around him. The boy slept and flames flickered around him, singeing the pillow, but not harming him in any way. Flames were observed to play over a girl when she walked in the street. At home her clothes regularly burst into flames as did her bedclothes in bed. A woman's dress went up in flames without causing harm to her. She was also present at times when items in the house ignited such as a pair of trousers, a bed, curtains, and so on. A boy was able to create hot patches of light in places such as on walls. If an individual can generate enough projected emotional or psychic energy physically to move objects, then he or she can also cause objects-or, conceivably, atoms- to vibrate vigorously enough to cause them to heat up. The vibration eventually reaches a point where combustion suddenly and spontaneously occurs."

"event","Poltergeist cause unexplained thumping, knocking and movement of furniture. Phenomena usually surrounds a particular person, commonly a young female. Trancelike states may occur among the target of poltergeist attacks, who speaks in a loud utteral voice, much like a medium. Objects tend to vibrate before they move. Occasionally objects take flight. Doors open and close. People may be pulled out of bed or moved. They may be choked, bitten or harmed. People may also be lifted into the air. Lights may be turned on and off. Cool rushes of air and temperature changes may also be experienced."

"event","Demons are usually indiscriminate regarding their victims. They might strike at time of day though their powers are strongest during the hours of darkness. They live in lonely places. They are also likely to attack a human who sleeps alone in a house. Demons prey upon mankind to do him mischeif. They are especially dangerous to women and children, and at the critical periods of life. (The critical periods are puberty, menopause, childbirth, illness, and so on.) Demons are usually humanoid, but frequently have characteristics of animals - horns, fur, pointed ears, cloven feet, and so on. Sometimes they are fully animal. In many cultures, demons are believed to cause nightmares.

Poltergeist makes noise, causes objects to move. They will pluck the sheets off the beds of sleepers or tweak one's nightcap. They whisper indecencies in unguarded ears."

"event","Incubus - male demon who bears down upon people during their sleep, choking and suffocating them, but who also performs the sex act with women.

Succubus - female demon who makes love to men during the hours of darkness.

Victims feel weighted down or paralyzed. The demon is a composite of attributes belonging to people known to the victim and other elements drawn from their memories. It is essentially it's own independant self though. The sex is described as totally satisfying. Sexual relationships with succubi and incubi have even been maintained over long periods."

I told him about the test I had just failed and he said he would do something to make me smile.  So he brought me a HUGE container with chocolate chip vanilla ice cream and a teddy bear and flowers!!!!!!!!  Awwweee  I ate so much ice cream I'm about to explode.....He just left and I'm already missing him :(  Oh wait...he's calling!!!  Ok so he's going to sleep now...and so am I!!  Bye kiddos!!!!"

"event","HI little journal.  I'm sorry I haven't been around for such a long time.  I have been busy with school and work. I am doing good in school, and work is good, just like it has always been. What happens when your boss wants you to GUESS everything instead of just asking for specific instructions?  It's very simple:  When you guess, you are at a high risk of missing the actual target, therefore, you are at a high risk of wasting time doing something that is not necessary.  Why can't the boss just say:  I want a print out of our financial status?  Instead of saying:  ""I wonder if I could buy a new computer for Mr. Lucky...""  Anyway...enough of work, it's devastating and it drains me.  The sad part is:  I like what I do!  

I have a situation:  I found some papers inside my boyfriend's car which undoubtedly belong to a girl (not me). It is like a small notepad with telephone numbers, email addresses, and things to do.  One of the things is ""get divorced"" (KEYWORD), a person's number is recorded under the name of ""flaca"" (KEYWORD).  THen, my boyfriend's old email address is among the addresses.  Now, he had that address even before he knew me.  He has a new one now.  Written with a different handwriting and different color of pen, I found my bf's name and his phone # (only that it's off by a digit) so obviously someone other than the owner of the note pad wrote it in for the owner to keep.  THis appeared in my bf's car.  He had let me borrow it because my car had a flat tire that he fixed today.  I confronted him last night about the papers I found.  ""GET DIVORCED"" is a keyword because my bf's ex girlfriend was getting divorced at the time he broke up with her to go out with me.  FLACA is a keyword because that's my bf's hore cousin's nickname, and it is her number.  He said he doens't know how those papers ended up in there.  Truth is, it is hard for me to believe that he put them there or forgot to hide them (in the event he IS seeing the hore) because I'm driving his car all the time, and being the control freak that I am, I'm always organizing the tiniest little mess I find, and he knows that.  My boyfriend had an accident past January and his car has not been fixed yet, so he doesn't drive it.  The only one that drives it is me, and if it is a complete and total emergency like my situation with the flat tire.  Knowing how my bf's cousin has tried to break us up in the past (Jessi you know this for a fact), I started thinking that it might have been her.  But how?  The car has always been parked at my bf's house, and she rarely/never visits.  She has a little sister (16 yrs old) who does visit with her dad sometimes, and who also (for a change) hates my guts.  It might have been her.  I don't know what to believe.  I don't want to be taken for a fool.  I know my bf and I can tell when he's lying.  He didn't seem like he was lying last night when I told him off.  I don't have any proof, and I don't want to give those hores the satisfaction of having my bf back in the market.  Even if he did cheat, which i doubt, I wouldn't leave him.  Instead, I would be nicer than ever, just to make those hores green of envy.  This is REVENGE now.  I'm living my life one day at a time.  I don't know what to do.  My boyfriend is not the kind of person that lies.  I don't know what to do.  SInce you are reading this from a third person point of view, you already know the answer to my little big problem.  Please tell me!  I need to know the truth so that I can know how to approach this situation.  If he did cheat, then I'm going to have a lot of fun using him just for revenge.  If he didn't cheat, then I'm going to have a lot of fun rubbing it on the hores' faces.  Either way, I'll have a blast."

LOl Just now, I was in the middle of a train of thought and my boyfriend called me telling me that he's going to be a little late because he's going fishing with this guy from work.  I was like:  SO what?  you just interrupted my thoughts and now I don't remember what I was going to write for my english paper!  Then I felt bad becuase he was being considerate and calling me so that I wouldn't worry.  Of course, I could have always called him and asked where he was, but the fact that he saved that step for me was just sweet.  Whatever.  I bitched at him for interrupting my thoughts.  LOL

I'm so overwhelmed and stressed with school.  I am taking three summer classes (12 week classes) and the three of them are so demanding!  I have been managing with the three, but it is do hard, I'm drained!

I feel like I have to apologize to my cell phone.  I mean, he's so cute and small and silver colored.  it's from Sprint!  And he has this cute walking panda in the screen.  ANd the sounds are so pretty.  It just annoys me sometimes.  Whatever...it's an innanimate object, I don't think it cares...

I got a baby blue liquid ink Uniball fine point pen.  It is so cute!  I also got another purple, and a pink one.  THey're all uniball liquid ink fine point.  Then I got this green one, fine point, but it's something else, not uniball, also with liquid ink.  

I'm so stressed with school!  THat's the only thing on my mind now.  I got a 95 on my first math test this trimester, I'm so happy!  Oh well, I'm going to take a shower, get dressed and go to my boyfriend's house now.  Ta ta!"

"event","My travails have been of an experimental nature.  I've tried new things at work.  For example, I've tried sitting back and pretending to work.  It works!  Work DOES get done!  MAGIC does exist! Yeah right, did you believe that?  OF COURSE NOT!!!!!!  Now I have a pile of work to do that's taller than me.  (I'm not that big, but you try to handle a 5'1"" pile of paperwork and see if you don't go nuts!)  

Well, I've been very stressed lately with school.  My math class is fun and easy when I'm in class, then when I get home, I review and review and review the material and I dont' understand it, even though I knew exactly what it dealt with when I was in class.  My English class is time-consuming and demanding.  It is hard to keep up, and the teacher is so picky and strict with our writing!  The only class that is lay-back is my social environment class, in which the teacher doesn't do much commenting but rather tells us to study and gives us the test date.  I like that better than talking crap for a month only to realize that you haven't learned anything.  So I have this essay to write about this reading I didn't understand (for my english class) and here I am trying to get my mind off of it for a while to see if I can focus when I get back to it.  

As a consequence of my stress, I have been eating like a cow, and I don't feel right about that.  Eating is my number 1 pleasure, but I have to watch it because I don't always eat healthy, if you know what I mean.  Then my puppy has not been feeling well lately, he's not as playful as before, my mom says he might be ""maturing"" LOL.  He's 4 months old!  I  haven't showed you pics yet, but soon I will, he's adorable!  OK, off to another topic...what topic?  Oh yes, my car, my beautiful car.  My boyfriend surprised me this weekend.  He always puts gas in my car because I hate puting gas!  SO he took it with the excuse of putting gas in it and came back with a car with tinted windows!!  They are so nice and dark!  You can't see a soul in the inside of that car!  Don't you hate it when you're driving and people stare at you at the red lights??  Aggggggggh I hate it.  Well, I gotta go and try to write this paper for english...wish me luck, send some light this way so that you  may enlighten my brain and I can write something worth reading..."

Not much has been going on, except that now my boyfriend is thinking (just thinking) of getting his own place and we've been looking around for apartments.  He already likes one or two.  So I'm super happy that he is becoming independent, but at the same time I feel awkward because if he moves out of his parents' house, I would visit my boyfriend's apartment more often than his parents' house, and I wouldn't want them to think that I don't care about them anymore.  Might seem like I'm drowning in a glass of water but believe it or not that is what has been bothering me lately.

Both Luis and I have become such workaholics(sp)! We barely have time for each other because we are so busy with work or school!  Incredible.  I'm having a mission finding my books this trimester, because the bookstore at MDCC closes at 4pm, and I can't mak it to the college before 4:30pm.  I'm screwed.  THen the efollet website has become flooded of company jargon I don't understand. Ie:  class division, class section, book division, book section, and there is not even an explanation on how to navigate the site.  How the fuck am I supposed to know the division or section or whatever of a book I've never seen in my life?  What kind of idiot remark is that?  I'm so fustrated I wish I could scream."

Have you ever seen the sad face of a little kid when the helium balloon he's holding escapes from his hands only to soar away?  I saw it today on my way home back from school (yes, I started school again today after a nice two-week vacation).  Right then and there, at that red light, my mind started to wander off...I concluded I wanted to be like that balloon...I want to break free, and soar away...but right then the balloon desinflates and falls tangled on a tree...and I didn't want to be like the balloon anymore..I want to soar, but I don't want to fall down.  SO I guess this is life:  full of ups and downs and if we're not ready for many falls ahead of us, why bother to try to soar?  Sounds a little bit pessimistic, but it's ironic because every time we reach for the stars we are risking a defeat.  Only if we are courageous will we succeed.  We need to aware that for every rise, there is a fall, and vice-versa. I can't believe it, it was a nice read heart balloon!  :[  OK enough is enough.  

Guys I was totally disgusted this weekend when I was forced to watch Maid in Manhattan...UGH!!  My boyfriend's little cousins were dying to see it, and since by boyfriend has DirecTV, I had no choice but to watch it with them (you may say, hey, you could have just stepped out of the room and save yourself from that torture!)  It's not that simple!  If I leave them unattended, they start trying on my shoes and my clothes and my makeup!  No-1 touches my makeup!  ::pouts::  So yes, they have to be under strict surveillance all the time.  They are a pain on my rear end...such misbehaved children!  I don't know how their mothers allow them to name-call her, yell at her, and even answer back with smarty-pants remarks...OMG!!  I'm not going to be a soldier raising my kids, I'm going to be lenient with them, but not to the point where they become misbehaved!  Anyway...I'm off that subject...for now.  I'm in the middle of a dilemma.  I SERIOUSLY want to have a baby.  My boyfriend still begs me for one.  I know I can balance school and pregnancy, and work and pregnancy...but will I be able to manage the criticizing looks of people?  My mom does not want me to have a baby now, she thinks I will suffer and drop out of school thus suppressing me from having a future...but she should know better...I know she is saying that because she went through it and she knows it is hard to have a family and work and go to school and take care of your home and your husband at the same time...but she did it, why can't I?  She doesn't want me to go through the same tribulations she went through, but when her mom told her to be careful and not have babies, did she listen?  Maybe just a little...Well, I don't know...Advise is appreciated...Thank you cyber pals!"

"event","I got a lot to write, but I don't know whether my eyes will allow me to stay awake for so long.  Let me start off by describing my weekend.  It was great!  On Saturday Jessi called me in the morning to tell me she had my stuff and that I could go pick it up.  So I just lay on the bed for a ""little while""  only to wake up six hours later when it was already time for dinner.  So on Sunday my boo wakes me up super early to go to Bass Pro Shops in Broward, because he and his boss want to by a thirty footer, maybe bigger, and that's the factory for the Makos, which are one of my fav boats...So we spent the day there, and we ate at the restaurant.  That store is so huge!  I had never been there before, it looks like you're out in the woods or in the ocean.  A bunch of fish and animals all around!!  Beautiful!  Ginger has grown a lot.  I took pictures of him.  I'll post them soon if I get a chance.  Work is hectic, aye, what's new?!?  I have to go to the doctor to check on my little engine aka heart because it's been giving me a lot of trouble lately.  I can only take one nitroglycerin a day to ease pain because it's so strong, but a few days ago, not even a nitroglycerin helped.  Right now it is hurting me, and I also have tachychardia (sp?) which makes it worse, because it hurts even more.  I checked out everyone's journals, but didn't get enough time to comment to all.  SO here goes:

Ivette:  I hope the three of you get better!  It's hard when one of you catch a cold or something because you're together the whole time and it's hard to stay away from catching the bug.

Jessi:  Mama please don't stress.  I don't understand your aunt's behavior, judging by what you had told me, she doesn't have any reason to have attitudes toward you.  Don't worry, Kevin will soon get a job, a place, and everything will be all right, you deserve this!  Your new hair color is very NICE! and I see you followed my advice on the gold stripe, even if it's just a stripe... :)

OBsita:  I couldn't see the crown for some weird reason it's not displaying, but I'm sure it's beautiful!!!

Plunky:  SO what's the Chas update?  No more funny emails about getting soda??  thanks for commenting about the trust issue, I am doing the same thing, I just listen, but am very selective when believing what they say.

SO yup yup...I got an A on my Speech class, an A on my English class, and a B on math.  My GPA is now 3.899.  It dropped!  :(  that's OK, it'll sky rocket soon, that's my goal!!  I'm reading First Things First by Franklin Covey.  I strongly recommend it, specially for those of us that work at really stressful environments.  It deals with time management and helps you understand what kind of person you are based on how you handle and manage situations at work and with your personal life.  It's wonderful!  My boss gave it to me for Christmas last year.  It's a great book.  I'm also reading another one called FISH, it's about time management also, I forgot who wrote it,and I know FISH is an acronym for something else...forgot that too...blah..too sleepy to keep on writing...catch you later!"

"event","Someone you thought you could trust suddenly doubts YOU are trustworthy? I mean, I have looked up to this person for a long time.  This person has her ups and downs and can be a pain at times, but I look up to her because she has found her inner self, she is in complete spiritual balance, professionally she has achieved what many of us wouldn't dream of, and even when the most unfeasible task emerges, she knows what to do to solve it in the best way possible.  So I'm told this person who I think is a goddess, does not trust me.  I know it's not personal, it's just business, but, I wonder why give such a high position to someone you can't trust just yet.  I wonder if she's testing me.  I know she is testing me.  Too bad she's not gonna get anything out of it.  I do the best I can under the highest level of confidentiality there is.  Whatever, a good friend told me that ""It's not personal, it's business"", and of course, she got that from ""You've Got Mail"", the movie.  I saw Adrian's mom today, she was wearing a T-shirt with his picture on it.  He looks so cute with his white little hat!  We just found out he's not going to be arriving maybe until June or August.  Apparently there was a misunderstanding about his return.  He was never on the ship on his way back to Virginia, that's something someone made up only to break the bad news later that he really wasn't coming.  What kind of frivolous person would do that?  Well, his mom knew he wasn't really coming, but this person told a few idiots like myself and I got all happy thinking he was on his way back.  Well, it feels good to be on vacation from school, although it is for a short while.  Well, I'm off to call my half brother Frank.  TTFN!!"

"event","I wonder if someone that I know feels sorry for a recent act of something totally opposite to what we call justice.  I don't know, as much as I try to see and understand both sides, I can only favor one.  Of course, the one that SEEMS the weakest.  I have no update on Adrian, I haven't spoken to his mother lately.  For those of you wondering who Adrian is, he's a kid my age that is currently on his way back from Iraq.  We've become closer friends since he got recruited, and he always came to me for advise.  I remember giving him this long speech on what being brave means and stuff...he's wonderful, just like a brother.  His sister breaks my heart, though.  She told me a couple of days ago that she missed her ""booger"" a lot (the call each other booger!)  That is so cute.  I remember sending Adrian a box full of twizzlers, the cherry ones, he loves them, even though I think they taste like an eraser.  Update on me?  NOt much, except that today I was on my way to my boyfriend's house (i'm driving his car since my car is STILL in the shop) and I stopped at a red light.  When the green comes on, the car doesn't move, it had shut off.  Then I get everybody complaining from their cars and stuff.  Then I get off, pop the hood, and discover that one of the cables that goes attached to the battery had gone loose.  So I put it back, and this man comes to my aid.  He was like, well, it looks like you have everything under control, so I was so proud of myself!  I know how to change a flat and I also know how to fix minor car troubles.  So I call my boyfriend as I am experiencing the biggest fit ever and I yell at him:  ""Your car just left me stranded in the middle of the road!!!!""  But the truth was, I was already on my way to his house again, I just wanted to make a point, the point being, I am able to fix this car without a man's help....HE HE.  A man theorically helped me, because he said:  Looks like you have everything under control""  So it was more of a self-esteem and psychological boost...Anyway...My final math exam was today...I didn't study because I figured that whatever I didn't know I wasn't gonna learn in a week.  I reviewed the material, but didn't sink in the book, for as far as I know, I would end up even more confused with all the formulas and graphs and quadrants and stuff....SO I arrived LATE to the test because it was raining and I didn't have an umbrella to leave the house with, and I had just blow dried my hair!!  Ughh how plastic, truth is, I didn't really care about the hair, but about getting wet with that cold water...OK, still plastic...what can you expect?!?!?  So I sit down and sink in the test.  Everything seemed too easy.  I turn in the test way before all the other people that had arrived on time.  SO I'm there wondering if I did things a bit too fast and just messed up everything.  I'm standing next to the teacher as he grades my test, and then i'm thinking:  ""Oh God, if I fail this class I will have to re-take it, and re-pay for it!!""  Oh No!!  HOUSTON, WE HAVE A PROBLEM!! And then the teacher goes, OK, your final grade for the class is B.  YOu would have gotten an A but you're missing 5 points that you could have easily gotten if you would have taken the practice test at the lab...Oh how I regret not taking it, but lazy me just couldn't do it...OK, so I'm more than happy with my B, it is way more than I expected...Bad news is, I have the same teacher next term, and I don't understand the way he teaches~!!!  :(  Well, gotta go now, it's time to hit the bed...nite nite!!"

This is what I do on a daily basis at work:

Personnel
Budget
Finance
Property Control
Room Control
Administrative Duties
Principal's Duties
Assistant Principal's Duties
MY Duties

Plus....regular secretarial work

Man, I'm washed out!  Yesterday we were on a staff meeting that took four hours!  Now they are thinking of making it six hours because four hours isn't enough!  OMG I'm soooooooooo stressed, but at the same time I'm calm and I just sent my co-worker's daughter (today is bring your son/daughter to work day) to get me a ham and cheese sandwich, they're selling them in the hallway for fundraising.  This is the second one I eat this morning!

On a heavier note, I am extremely sad....Life and its surprising experiences, emotions, trials and tribulations... at times we may feel that our lives are in quiescent state and we look around us feeling peace, happiness and tranquility... almost afraid to breath and realize that this state will change and all this will be taken away from us... and then it happens; that peace that we so much yearn for is robbed from our lives.

The challenge is to prove to ourselves, to life, to God, that we can step up to the plate and play ball.  Is our faith strong enough to pull us through?  If we feel that it is not or we have strayed away from our God, do we simply call him back and He answers?

You may wonder why I'm so sad...a very good friend's brother in law is dying of lung cancer. Seeing her suffer brings back memories of when my mom (not my real mom, but I called her mom) died of breast cancer last February.  Makes you wonder what life really is...when you think everything is going fine and you're walking smoothly through your path, you hit a rock and get a blister.  I just heard Adrian is on his way back from Iraq.  His ship left Iraq a few days ago.  I'm dying to see him.  I'm so glad he's OK and he didn't even get scratched, well, maybe scratched, but he didn't get shot.  I wonder what it felt like to be there so far away from home, experiencing something totally new and without someone's shoulder to cry on.  I wonder what it must be like to want to cry your heart out because of stress and melancholy, and you can't because there is something more important to do than take care of your own feelings.  Those guys are heroes because they deprived themselves from everything to go and fight a war and protect us, even those that wished them dead.
Now Adrian is in his way back to Virgina, where he will be staying for the next three months, unless they tell him to come home.  Well, I have talked a lot about many subjects...and the bottom line is, I don't even know why I said all these things when I really wanted to talk about yesterday, which was secretaries day, and my boyfried took me to Houston's to celebrate.  So I had a great evening, blah..."

So yes, I had a math test that had been postponed for a week, because the whole class was lost in la-la land.

So today he shows up with this totally weird stuff (nothing to do with what he said we should study) and the saddest part is, I think I failed it!

"event","::You are fearfully and wonderfully made::  This phrase was first said by King David.  A teacher told me that today as he walked in the office to sign out.  He looked me in the eye and told me this, and then I totally freaked out.  Three guys from work plus every one else I have seen, but i am surprised these guys said I looked pretty, since they never seem to care, besides, they don't see me as an opportunity to flirt, but more like an opportunity to have a friend at work.  That's the good thing of working at a place where you know everybody and they respect you and care for you for who you are, rather than what you look like.  So yes, people have told me I look cute today, when I haven't even made the slightest effort to look good, I'm just leaving it up to nature, so yes Jessica, I know exactly what you mean when you say that Dennis doesn't look at you when you are all fixed up, but comes to you to tell you that you look nice when you don't look as nice as you think.  Oh well.  I stayed at my sister's last night (she lives in Homestead).  As we were driving to work this morning, I notice her husband did not change her flat last night when I told him a million times he had to change it.  So I call her on her cell phone and tell her to pull over because she's gonna have an accident if she keeps driving like that.  So there we are, in the middle of 874 this morning and of course, you know she doesn't know how to change a flat. So daddy's little girl (that would be me) had to get down and dirty and change her flat.  I was wearing a white shirt I seldom wear becuase I have to take it to the dry cleaner every time because it looks as if it had been taken our of a bottle when I take it off.  So my white shirt had grease and dirt all over it, and so did my face and armas.  Thank God for baby wipes!!  That is the best invention ever.  So both of us called our jobs to say that we were gonna be late...To make a long story short, I had to end up wearing a T-shirt that my sister had in her car (luckily) and I arrived at the office at 8:45am!!!!  My boss had a luncheon today at FIU and she was terribly dressed, so you know I sent her butt to Ross to buy an emergency black blazer...LOL  My day has gone by VERY slow today, and I have done a lot of things, I am dying for this day to be over.  Today is my two-years and three months anniversary, my boyfriend wants to surprise me with a romantic dinner out in the beach (his mom told me, he he) but I have a test today in math, and the sad part is, I don't know ANYTHING, really, I don't know NOTHING, I'm screwed big time.  If I fail or get a bad grade in that class my GPA is gonna drop two points.  NO WAY!!! What do I do?!?!?!?  Ugh!!!!!  Oh well, so be it.  So I guess Luisito and I will get to have our evening at the beach AFTER I finish that horrible killer test.  I'm good at math, but I have to study it and totally understand it in order to be good.  It's not like English or History, or Anatomy or Psychology or other things I'm good at, it's just this thing I have against numbers, it just doesn't work, I actually have to study for it.  Well, I am off to check out my few friends' journals, and I'm off to find a new background so that I can get ochuncita to put it in, I suck at html, well, i'm learning, I changed my font color and size all by myself!  So yes, i'm crawling and soon I'm be giving baby steps, and then, I'll be able to walk and run...YAY!!! Long way to go until I become an HTML pro....LOL  hey it even rhymes!!! OK, that's enough...I don't want anyone thinking I'm a nerd or a freak or a geek...LOL  Peace!!"

OK, so down to business with this dream thing...Last night I had a very weird dream.  I dreamt Jessica and I were in a cementery, looking for a bone of a dead person whose spirit needed to be elevated.  He/she hadn't died peacefully.  I was dressed in black, the same black dress I was wearing yesterday.  I don't remember what Jessi was wearing.  It looked like we had just finished work and we had gone together.  Then I start screaming to Jessica because I see un muerto that coming my way.  And then se me pega.  I start feeling all nauseous and in a trance-like mode.  In conclusion, it was a total of four or five muertos que se me pegaron while we were in the cementery.  I don't know if we got the bone we initially went there for.  What's funny is that this morning I woke up feeling weird.  I had nausea, headaches, well, the same thing I had in the dream, only now it was for real.  I looked next to my bed.  The glass of water was empty.  Ginger probably knocked it down.  So I've reached a major conclusion:  When I don't have the glass of water next to my bed, muertos play tricks on me.  How weird.  I wonder if they are trying to tell me something.  God knows how scared I get sometimes, thinking they might do something bad.  At the same time, I don't know if they want me to do something, and that's the reason why they keep coming to me in dreams, and sometimes, they show themselves to me.  For example, my boyfriend's house if full of them, but I only see them at night, in the kitchen and the living room.  I saw one in the bathroom one, and next to the pool.  Is there action required on my part?  Hello!!  Jessica!  Obatalasita!  You people, you are the experts on this, que hago??"

"event","Ok, so it's time to vent out once again....Only this time I have good things to vent.  Yesterday I got out of work at 4:40pm!  I was supposed to get out at four.  You must be thinking:  ""You stupid workaholic!""  But no, it's not like that!  I was in a staff meeting.  We always have staff meetings on wednesdays at 1:30pm.  They're supposed to last from one to two hours ONLY.  But since sometimes we forget that it's wednesday and we have to have a meeting, then two and three meetings are squeezed into one.  Anyway, it was the usual boring, gossip-centered meeting we always have.  I had an appointment to do my hair at 4:30pm, so you know I missed it.  Anyway, I got home close to 5pm and then Luisito called me.  He's like hi mi amor que estas haciendo?  I'm like nada, driving home, just got out of work, tenia que ir a la peluqueria and i missed the appointment, he's like well, things happen for a reson, I'm like yeah, I'm sure.  Then as I'm parking my car in my house's parking lot, I see his truck approaching.  He's like let's go to Robert's (his boss) house becuase I gotta take some paperwork to him.  I'm like ok fine but I gotta change first.  Bottom line is we ended up eating in a very nice spanish restaurant, me my boo, robert and his wife and their 4 year old boy.  We had the best time ever.  So then we got to my house like at 12:30 and he was too tired to drive to his house so he slept over (in the sofa, of course, you know old cuban mom won't let him sleep with me when he's at my house).  In the morning I woke him up to go to work and I prepared breakfast for both of us.  It was so cute.  Then he tells me:  Mi amor yo quisiera que todos los dias nos levantaramos asi juntos y desayunaramos juntos, and then we would go to work together and stuff, as if we were married, I want to be with you forever.  So you know I was like ::gasp:: and then I said yes baby I know.  Awwe that was so cute.  So I'm happy.  Love makes us stupid.  Can you believe it?  I am all happy because of that little thing he told me, it made my day.  It's so beautiful to be in love!!  I do not want to fall out of love, because that would mean not living those little pieces of daily happiness.  Well mii lil journal, see you next time!"

"event","Well,last night I went on a quest to find the inner me.  I decided to pamper myself!  I filled the tub with SUPER hot water, and poured 4 caps of Juniper Breeze Bubble Bath from Bath and Body Works.  The bubbles started jumping all over the place, and soon the bathroom was filled with them.  I went into the tub and just lay there for about two hours.  How relaxing!!  I was playing with the bubbles just like my little cousin.  When his mom bathes him with the Johnson & Johnson bubble bath, he starts clapping and tries to crush the bubbles with his hands as he claps.  I was doing that last night.  Sort of felt like a little kid.  That made me wonder.  With all the responsibilities I have gained in the past two years, I started thinking if I gave up on being a kid way to soon.  I feel like being dumb, I feel like doing something for no special purpuse, I feel like jumping, yelling, spitting, biting, in conclusion, I want to be a kid.  All of us have a little kid inside, and mine is begging to be released. I've been so wrapped up in work and school that I have underestimated my inner child.  Well, I shall go shopping this afternoon to Toys R Us and buy my inner child some toys...LOL for real, that's what I feel like doing.  Or, I might go to the beach (my therapy) and just sit there until I feel calm and ready to face the world again...Well dear journal, I just wanted to send all this into the void...."

Medicine Wheel: Native American Astrology 


The Medicine Wheel Report gives you a deeper exploration into your symbolic animal and your place in its realm. 

A traditional Native American astrology program by Randall Cole Roffe, for natal charts; based on the Kvniakati Tsulawi Medicine Wheel tradition of the Southern Shawnee and Cherokee, with some references to the traditions of other North American tribes.

Dr. Roffe is a direct descendant of the Chickamaugan Tsulawi Cherokee, Chickasaw, and Southern Shawnee Kvniakati practitioners. He is not a member of any currently Federally recognized tribal entity.

MEDICINE WHEEL ANIMALS:

1. Red Hawk (Aries)
2. Beaver (Taurus)
3. Songbirds (Gemini)
4. Rabbit (Cancer) (Coyote - other tribes)
5. Alligator (Leo)
6. Mouse (Virgo)
7. Bear (Libra)
8. Snake (Scorpio)
9. Elk (Sagittarius)
10. Deer (Capricorn) (Buffalo - other tribes)
11. Otter (Aquarius)
12. Panther (Pisces)

MEDICINE WHEEL Native American astrology program copyright 2000 Dr. Randall C. Roffe


SUN

Sun is considered to be female and to govern the basic physical makeup and the mitochondrial DNA (the genetic mother line) of the individual, while Moon is considered male and is the Hunter or the desire and attraction element. Both Sun and Moon are considered measurers of the sky, and distributors of the energies of the ancient and eternal Star Clans. These ancient sources of genetic code are symbolized by the Totem Animals in the constellations and in the clans of the various tribes.

Sun in Alligator Place = Fruit Moon (Sun in Leo)

The Tsalaki Moon of Middle Summer is called Galoni or Fruit Moon. It corresponds to the Southwest direction and to the hottest part of the afternoon. At this time of year, when you were born, nature is hot and lazy in Cherokee and Southern Shawnee country and the cicadas are droning loudly as leisurely predators await their prey. Many fruits and berries are ripening as thunderstorms develop on the horizon.

Fruit Moon People like to be comfortable and lazy, and they like entertainments and evening activities. They can be very self-centered and volatile, yet frequently others hold them in awe. Fruit Moon People are often dramatic and impressive.

The Sun Guardian of this Moon is the Alligator in the Tsulawi tradition. Alligator has great aggressive strength, but is very slow to be provoked unless its family is threatened. Alligator or Tsulaski dwells in the Below Realm of Fire, and is also the Guardian of Heart and Circulation Herbs in Kvniakati herbal medicine. The alligators are promiscuous animals or nearly so, and pretty much stay in the same pond their entire territorial lives. The Wolf and the Fox are sometimes associated with this direction, as is the Sturgeon in the Mdewiwin Tradition. You have many Alligator qualities that come from the Below Realm of Fire, giving social circulation and entertainment skills and temporal leadership. Excess of fire can rise into the head from overaccumulation in the heart, causing attitudes of arrogance or self-importance.

Mouse is the partner Guardian of Alligator but they work and live in entirely different realms, not really knowing one another.

Alligator gets along well with Red Hawk and Elk, all of whom have strong aggressive qualities. Alligator also gets along well with Songbirds and appreciates their insect control. Bear also gets along alright with Alligator as they both are frequently fishing and are of comparable strength.

Alligator clashes with Rabbit or Deer only seldom, staying in separate realms. Panther and Alligator likewise seldom conflict but it is quite a fight when they do.

Alligator's worst conflicts are with Otter as they compete in the Lower Realm underwater for fish and crustaceans. Otter finds the Alligator to be arrogant and power-hungry, while Alligator finds Otter to be very annoying, and Otter sometimes becomes Alligator's lunch. Snake and Beaver also clash with Alligator in the underwater Lower realm and frequently end up as her dinner too. Otter or Snake may eat Alligator's eggs at times in revenge, and Beaver may disturb Alligator's nests. Alligator does not like the way Beaver changes the water level, disturbing the fishing."

I got into a car accident this weekend!  On Saturday!  This bitch hit me in Winn Dixie's parking lot...The lady fled the scene of the accident, of course, I took all her 411 down before she left, and then I stayed and called the cops.  Turns out the lady has a fucked up record.  She has had several other accidents in which she has also fled.  Anyway, I didn't get a ticket, I don't know if she did.  Let's see what happens when I go to Court."

"event","OK...Here it goes.  Last night I had a dream that I was visiting one of my female cousins.  She is for the second time pregnant.  Funny thing is, while she was in Cuba she was considered sterile. Even after the birth of her first child the doctors here told her that it had been a miracle that she was able to conceive a child.  The doctors assured her that she wouldn't get pregnant again.  Well, now she's 4 months pregnant!  So nothing, I dream that I am visiting her and I'm sitting at her back porch and we are in front of each other talking.  Her backyard is a cementery, as a matter of fact, she advised me to walk cautiously because I might step on a grave.  So she's talking to me, but i'm not listening, instead, her fetus is moving inside her womb, and I see it, and it is talking in some bizarre language that I cannot understand, but I hear it giggling.  So out of nowhere, this kid appears sitting against the wall and I guess I was the only one that saw it because my cousin didn't mention anything about the boy being there.  I don't know the boy, he might have been 10 or 12 years old. He's wearing baggy fisher pants and a baggy long sleeve shirt.  La tela es como de saco, but lighter tones of brown.  He has beautiful black hair that falls on his forehead.  His curls are perfect, undisturbed by the wind, and his skin is the color of brown sugar.  His hair caught my attention, and I stared at him.  He looked at me, but his eyes were empty, like far away in the horizon.  He said Hola Alielkis (nobody calls me that, that's my full name)  I sensed evil in his eyes and his smile was mischeivous.  I told him to get away from me, for I felt a wave of fear passing through me.  His eyes were intimidating me.  He said don't be rude to me, because something bad will happen to you in the morning.  And then he said, WAKE UP!  So I woke up to Ginger licking my face.   I looked at my clock and it was 7:45am, so i said, shoot, I am almost late for work.  But then Ginny calls me to find out what's wrong and why i'm not at work.  Then she tells me it's 8:45am!!  I looked at all the clocks at my house.  They said 7:45am.  So I rush to work and the clock at work said I was an hour late.  My dream was freaky, I hope it doesn't happen again."

"event","Dear Journal, I have something to tell you.  Yesterday I was supposed to go to school, but I was feeling so bad, so down, so depressed, so overwhelmed that I decided not to go.  As I was driving to nowhere, because I definitely wasnt going to school, I decided to buy some more milk for Ginger.  I stopped at Pet Supermarket (the one on US-1)  As I was leaving Pet Supermarket I realized I was very close to the Crandon Park Marina.  So I drove over there, but instead stopped at the beach, right before the first bridge. I had bought a pack of Kools.  I never smoke, I am disgusted by people that do.  So I was disgusted at myself anyway for not being able to handle certain situations.  So I took one out, I lighted it, and I walked up to the shore.  I let the waves wet my feet, and felt in heaven.  Once the first Kool was over, I decided to leave.  I wanted to be at an even quieter place.  So I went to the Crandon Park Marina and sat on the dock.  I watched boats as they entered and left the dock, I watched the sea gulls and the pelicans struggling to catch the fish that a man was throwing at them.  I felt good.  I felt in contact with nature, with the sea, to which I have been drawn ever since I can remember.  It's just a fatal attraction, me and the sea, I just gotta go there.  I wondered if I should smoke a second Kool, and I answered myself with the lighter in my hand and cigarrete in my mouth.  I was amazed.  Yuck, I was smoking it, and felt it to be so relaxing, calming, like it was helping me breathe or something.  I feel embarrased to say all this, because I have always been a controlled person, I don't let anything or anyone bring me down, at least not completely.  But yesterday I felt weak.  And I even smoked!  I don't know what got into me.  Then I got home and my father asked me:  ""So how was school?""  I answered:  ""same as usual dad, so did you eat or do I have to cook you some dinner?""  He had already eaten.  Another reason for me not to eat and just vegetage in some place, I had no company.  My boyfriend doesn't know about my little adventure of skipping school.  He doesn't have to know everything, you know?  There are things that only pertain to me, and if I feel like being alone, then where does he fit on the picture??  NOWHERE.  He was tired anyway, and went to sleep early.  I spent the afternoon with myself, and I loved it, I should do it more often.  Then I realized it was 8pm, and I had to feed Ginger.  So I gave him his semi solid semi liquid food (i'm starting to switch him from milk to solid food, so he's learningto chew) So I mix the solid food with milk, I make it a rather liquid, and I feed it to him.  He devours it, and then an hour later he's vomiting.  I freaked out.  He could easily dehydrate and die, for he's still very small (he's 46 days old today!)  SO I finally hit the bed at 2 am after watching Ginger fall asleep, maybe because he was tired, or maybe because he gave up on his pain and his discomfort and decided to go to sleep.  Then I couldn't fall asleep thinking that he might wake up in pain again and I might not hear him.  So I took a Zanax and fell into bed.  This morning, however, I wanted to smash the alarm clock against the wall.  But I couldn't.  When you are the administrative assistant of someone you can't just say you're tired and won't go to work.  Everyone depends on you.  So I got up, get poorly dressed, and went to work with a tired look on my face.  Now I have to listen to people asking me what's wrong, and I have to answer politely and say:  Nothing, why do you ask?  Then I have to be in control and energetic, but how can I be energetic if I have no energy??  I think I need some cuban coffee....Well....until next time!"

A very good friend is being cheated on for the THIRD time, and she always ends up forgiving the bastard and taking him back.  Honestly, all I can say is, he doesn't love her for shit, he just knows that she;s there 24/7 for him and she's good, responsible, reliable, etc, and he's known her forever.  She on the other hand, loves him and has loved him since the sixth grade!!  she says he cheats on her because she does not do what he tells her to...que boba!!  OMG Ochun teach this girl a lesson!! He's definitely oni chango...who the fuck does he think he is?  i can't tell her anything because then yo quedo mal when she takes him back again, and at the same time, si me callo i explode.  pero entre marido y mujer nadie se puede meter, so i gotta keep my mouth shut i guess. Thanx jessi for the advice, i shall carry it out now!!  stay tunned for the outcome of this my new quest for spark...LOL!!  Ginger is growing and everyday he comes up with new tricks and adorable things/movements.  My sister brought him this little toy that's a cow and it vibrates when you pull a string it has a the bottom, well, Ginger hates it and barks at it like saying stop vibrating bitch, i'm trying to bite you here!!AWWW  Ok last minute update!!  As i'm writing this, he's sitting behind me on the bed...well, he just tapped my back, and when I looked back he tilted his head like saying:  HI i'm here!!  I grabbed him and sat him in my legs as i type and he's just standing in two paws hitting the space bar he's so cute!!!!!!!!  Anyway...i shall sleep now, tomorrow shall be a new and bright day for me....."

I realized today that if you have something big that you have to do, the best thing to complete it without any trouble is to get your mind settled in the goal itself.  Break the process in 3 parts, and try to complete it one part at a time. Then, before you know it, you will have accomplished your goal in half the time.  Well, that's all for today's time management tip...  TTFN!~!~!~"

"event","Somehow I woke up today thinking that it is time I find out where I really belong.  For example, what orisha claimed me at birth?  What are my innate characteristics?  What can I do to praise that orisha and make it proud of me?  I'll soon find out.  I've always seen and felt them around me.  Last night I watched as my mother-in-law and father-in-law praised their elegguas, and asked them que le abrieran los caminos.  I felt the presence of muertos all around me, and even though I was just watching, I knew they were there.  I just want to get to the bottom of this.  We, humans, are by nature very curious!  Well, changing the subject, I thought I could pick up my adorable Lhasa Apso this weekend but it seems like I will have to wait another week, so I can't go pick him up until March 8.  I want to name him Ginger, but I've been told it sounds gay.  WHAT do I name him???  I want to name him something cute and/or funny.  Any suggestions?  Last night I heard a song my boyfriend dedicated to me at the beginning of our relationship.  I was on my way home from Blockbuster and heard it on the power love hour.  It's called Lost in Love by Nasty Boy King.  I shivered and called him so he could hear it.  I felt as if we were going through a new beginning.  I've been kinda confused lately, I don't know what my true feelings are.  Maybe I'm in love with him, maybe I'm so used to having him around that the sole idea of living without him makes me feel empty.  Is this love?  Only time will tell.  We've been together for two years and I have been told that all relationships go through certain crises, I simply don't know if my relationship will be strong enough to endure it.  He loves me and I can tell, he wants to marry me and have a family.  But that's not what I want.  I want to finish my career, I want to define my future, I want to achieve my maximum potential, and I feel that once I have a family to take care of, those new responsibilities will not allow me to fully concentrate on what's been my number one goal for almost 20 years.  I don't want to tell him that I am confused, because that would imply that I am not sure of my feelings toward him.  On the other hand I feel very silly. I feel as if I am gravitating above these issues and just get a panoramic view of them.  I feel like I am not me, as if I was somewhere else, just watching the other me.  And that's a silly situation, because the fact that I am not inside my body becomes a silly remark to the senses.  I am not inside of me, and I am watching me going through all this shit, and I am laughing because I know that it will soon be over and I am still tormenting me with the same issues.  I laugh at me because I have not gotten closure.  WHAT A F***ING DILEMA!!!!  Ugghhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!  Anyway, until next time..."

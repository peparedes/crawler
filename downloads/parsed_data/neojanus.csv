"event","I had a hell of a to do list today. With three hours of prep time, I had to do four things that take about an hour eat to complete. Man that was a close one honestly. Technically I didn't finish in time since I actually had to work almost an hour into service to finish it all.

Let me remember the biggies on the list. I had to make a hotel pan of potato gratin, a chocolate tart (plus enough tart dough for more tarts), tomato soup, and other set up stuff. When you make things in bulk from scratch even if it's easy it takes a few minutes and a lot of attention. Can't let things burn, turn black, or boil over. So at most I'm only allowed to do two things at once. Hell, cutting and stacking potatoes for 24 orders of gratin always takes me a little under an hour. The soup requires me to cut a bunch of onions and carrots and garlic, then crush and strain a can of tomatoes, then sweat/brown the veg, deglaze with wine, then bring the whole thing to a boil followed by a blending and straining session.&nbsp; And tart dough just requires a lot of time and freezing and mixing then resting. Everything was just a pain in the ass. 

I'm just glad I got everything done and finished. Day off. Time to work out."

"event","So now I have two days off as of a few hours ago. I'm going to be sore tomorrow from pumping iron but I think I'll be fine to enjoy myself. 

For anyone who doesn't know on Monday's Kevin is off so I get the sautee station all to myself. Which is fun if you consider I'm mostly standing around doing nothing, or I'm hit and doing an hour of straight cooking followed by an hour of nothing until we close. Oh and there are the desserts that do come up and deserts can suck if you let them break up your timing and rhythm. 

I kind of butted heads with Kevin yesterday, I was making pate a choux and even though I used his recipe my gut told me not to use all the eggs in his recipe. Kevin gave me a terrible look like I was some sort of idiot or something and told me to just make it as it said so I went for the full ten eggs. The pate was soft and runny and even though it baked nicely, the point of the matter was that they were harder to pipe, which makes for a worse product because they came out funny shaped. Well today whe I made another batch I used my gut and went with seven eggs. I made nigh perfectly shaped perfitiroles that puffed up nicely. But I won't tell.

Seriously though I've made pate a choux and have been taught pate a choux by a real serious Pastry chef. I know pate a choux, pate a choux is a good friend of mine. That sir was not pate a choux (though technically it was)"

I fucked up at work today.  The truth is I'm still feeling my way around what's the right thing and I fuck up in that regard. But the fuck up isn't very major though it annoyed my chef. Truth was I just didn't think what I was doing was so bad. Thinking back it was obvious, but I just didn't think it through. I went into Friday service with six creme brulees. How stupid was I really.&nbsp; I should have had eight minimum. Naive.&nbsp;

The other thing is that I do get worked up when I get stacked. I look frenzied even though I'm not actually frenzied. I just enter a scramble mode, which does get Kevin, my chef, worried. I don't think I actually lose track of things, I do panic a little but that's just natural stress, the thing is that I'm fighting to catch up and that just how I am in catch up mode. Yes it's stressing but I'm always fighting through, especially when I go into catch up mode. I'm never in a true panic, just a crazy get this, then that done mode. Once again naive."

"event","Got the last of my three wisdom teeth pulled today. I lied and told them someone was picking me up so they could knock me out. I'm not proud of what I did but I did because, I just don't want to be there when the chip and shatter and prod my tooth out (Like I was the first time). 

Let me tell you I've had two of the most memorable trips in my life today. The one I had under the anesthetic and the other trying to make my way home. 

Let me tell you, if you've never been knocked out, go for it. Sure it makes surgery a little more dangerous but it's like time traveling with a show in between. I was suddenly in a box filled with light, bright oranges, and reds, and yellows all swirling around and the first few minutes after waking up are so surreal it's fun.

Here's the down side and from now on I'll listen to everything my doctors say. I had no one to take me home and no cash on had for a taxi so I asked to just be let go after about a hour from waking up. The first few steps you are dizzy and nauseous, not necessarily groggy though cause I was lucid but weakened. Walking around was the worst because I've realize I'm the type who has a body that responds to toxins pretty well. I wanted to throw up a basically empty stomach cause my body sensed a poison. I say basically empty cause I'd not eaten for twelve hours and the only thing filling it at that point was a half a cup of blood (I assume).

Only thing that could soothe me was AC and motion not my own. I threw up in my mouth a few times which is double gross when you imagine that I have open wounds on my mouth. But after a few hours of power sleep I'm feeling much better. Next time I might consider not going under. (maybe)"

Well I suppose this post is going to anger a lot of women, or really senstive guys but I just wanted to write this down before going to bed because, well, it deals with personal freedoms and I'm a person who believes in personal rights and freedoms.

So what is the Rape button? It's the idea that and being weaker then the profile of an attacker can be hurt by merely the accusation of rape. I firstmost blame the rapist, by which I mean the real rapists. Don't get me wrong, rape is the worst thing other then maybe murder and that's arguable. But because of the rampant taking advantage of women and young children and all the likes, it gets to a point where the mere mention of rape with the proper circumstance can destroy a man. It didn't destroy Kobe but it could have. 

Maybe I am taking light of the situation, but I feel that the venomous women out there are really dangerous and they will use such things to their advantage, all the while destroy stupid and innocent men for being just that. Things like this make me feel better about being a virgin, but also keeps a mental block on getting laid. I kid but seriously the thought of innocent men being thrown to the wolves because of things like marijuana raps and false rape cases just gets me angry at the world.

I also hate Christmas, I hate it like nothing else. It's the one time of year where I feel like I want to be an asshole.

Let me explain, I love the good cheer and will, and the gift giving and the lovingness everyone shares in. I hate the monotomy and annoyances that always come from the rituals we take to celebrate. By rituals I don't mean the century old ones, I mean a lot of the crap we started doing in the last I don't know 10-20 years. New Christmas songs suck, I don't care who sings them or how they are sung. Stick to the classics, don't make up how you saw mommy makeout with underneath the mistletoe, or how you want every day to be christmas or none of that shat. I especially hate ""modern"" Christmas ornaments. I know this snowman decoration that turns it's head from left to right and sings the last verse of ""'tis the season"" before wishing you a Merry Christma. It's evil. It looks at me with the black coal eyes and is constantly singing in that stupid cutesy tone of voice. I think it wants my soul. Don't get me started on the crappy shows and telemovies and movie-movies, and all of that crap.

We should just go back to enjoying a nice party with family and friends, sharing gifts, having fun. Gathering around a hearth or tele-yulelog, or around a Christmas tree and all of that stuff. Just being happy is enough, isn't it?

FYI: I'm a non-Christian that celebrates Christmas, if you have a problem with that, whatever. The War of Christmas was and is BS and you should be ashamed if you ever believed that."

Now I know how the first Star Wars fans felt after Empire, and it feels good. Aang was almost killed in the Avatar state, Toph is now the sole Metal Bender in the World, and the Earth Kingdom has fallen from the inside. Still we know there's hope, Aang is alive and he is a step from mastering the cosmic force that will fully realize him, Toph's strength is undeniable, and the Water Tribe is still fighting, and Zuko he feels remorse (which is all I can ask for him).

Focusing on the indiviual characters I want to talk about Zuko the most. I guess it was too much to want him to be a hero, still he's troubled and I fear he's choosen the wrong path. Even his dream/vision showed him that choosing Azula is the path to ruin. Zuko will never be at peace with her around, and definately never be Fire Lord. If anyone needs attention it's Azula and she would never let Zuko show her up. Zuko and Iroh, they are so alike and yet different. I hope his regret leads him back to the path of a happier man, then a troubled prince. 

Also I'd like to say, Azula, you bitch! You sexy, smart, evil bitch. She's just a great character to follow, but only if your the type that likes the dark side. I might strole around the dark path once in a moon but I'd never live there. Still, I'm more Anakin then Luke-(despite the only half decent acting). Kudos on being a supergenius. Now go to hell, or some Avatar world equivalent."

"event","I'm so terrible depressed, I'm just going to sleep. Not that my life is that bad, but I have nothing to celebrate. Nothing at all. 

A yet, that makes me want to laugh out loud literally. I don't know why, but I find laughing so easily that I can laugh at my own pain. It's the worst thing ever, but it's a knack I have. I'm so sad that I'm worthless but I'm so giddy because I'm so pathetic. I totally suck and that's jsut so funny. Now while I'm still a little light headed from laughing manically, I'll try to get to sleep."

"event","So I decided to spend this day off for myself, by going to a movie. What movie, well of course, Tim Burton's Nightmare Before Christmas, in Disney Digital 3-D<sup>tm</sup>. Let me tell you, other then having to wear glasses over glasses, it was pretty awesome. They threw in these neat scenes just to give you that 3-d feel, like a kid walking down his stairs and some scenes they made into odd angles that was very, cool to see. I totally forgot how fast paced and geniunely creepy this movie was. The opening song and musical number was totally shocking in 3-D, mainly because you forget how gruesome a lot of the Halloween towners are. The kid with the sewed up eyes and those witches are damn disgusting when you see them that close up. This is a masterpiece of filmwork that really got improved in the 3-D style. <br /><br />Still thew one thing that I came away with was that if ever I was enamoured with a fictional character, it would have to be Sally. Her empathy, her subtle strength, her vulnerabilty, even her look, as a child I remember being attractive to all of it and it still holds true. The way that she is always in view and yew off to the side for Jack to ignore, how she is totally in love with and understand Jack, all play into her why and it makes me jealous of Jack that he has her and doesn't realize it till the end on hook hill. <br /><br />In other news, I finished Bully, and picked up Final Fantasy XII (12). I've played the demo and I'm still extremely skeptical of the battle system. The games plays itself, (or as <a href=""http://penny-arcade.com"">Penny-Arcade</a> called it, plays with it self ie it masturbates). Still it looks to be a fun play. Also it has a fully 3-d rendered Bunny Girl. I hear the sounds of nerd going nuts, busting nuts."

"event","If you don't know that's a line from Family Guy. Stewie Griffin lands in a baby carriage, smells the baby grl's dirty diper and is turned on. His reply, ""God, why does that turn me on?"". And in honor of the notion I will not list some things I've noticed that have turned me on.

1) Soccer girl on bus, readjusting her shorts/underwear. God, why does that turn me on? See a group of High School girls got on a bus and they were all busy being self involved when this just happened to happen and I caught a glimpse of one of the girls really going at it with her underoos. Perhaps it was the fact that she did this right in front of my face and it was at eye level (I was sitting). True I was looking through my paper at the time, but for the six some seconds that it went on, I couldn't look away. I mean it was like she was parting the red sea... not the best choice of words there huh?

2) Bird Girl on Harvey Bird man. God, why does that turn me on? I know sex is a big joke on the show and some episodes are just chock full of nasty cartoon loving and funny enuendo but I laugh and almost never find this show stimulating, in that way. Even in those episodes that have sex written through out the story line I just laugh. But when they put Bird Girl on, I don't know why but she does it for me. Tonight they had the Atom Ant, Hulk-Hippo story line, but the sight of Bird Girl doing quasi-sexual Yoga was too much. I knew it was ment to be funny and it was, but I felt the back of my brain hit a switch. Another minute and I might have gotten pretified, :wink wink:.

3) A female singing anything. Well what can I say, the female voice turns me on, period. But sometimes I'm just listen to a commerical jingle being sung by a woman, and I kind of fall in love with the voice. Like really in love. God, why does that turn me on? Meh, could be worse. I could be in love with women yelling, I suppose. Wait, no, no,- Wait! No, yeah, women screaming doesn't turn me on. Moaning you ask? Well how is she moaning..."

"event","My next door neighbor is a wife beater. I think. The cops took him away, no signs of what went on though. 

The Korean couple who move in a few months ago have seemed to always have some trouble. One time, I saw him grab her by the scruff of the neck to keep her from leaving. It wasn't a jerking grab, but he held on and she didn't move because she didn't want to stretch out her collar. 

Now two lady cops have come to take him away. Must suck to get arrest for wife battery by female cops. Two bucks say they pull him into a ladies room and beat the shit out of him."

"event","<div align=""center""><u><strong>The Tales of Ba Sing Se<br /></strong></u>
<div align=""left""><br />Well first off I whole heartily agree that this is the best Episode yet and will be hard to beat, but I hope they do.<br /><br />Okay so the show is broken down to six stories in Three acts, three of the stories mostly light hearted, three a little somber, all a fun mix of seriousness and good natured fun. Now let me break it down and if you don't want to be spoiled scroll down to the last paragraph.<br /><br />Katara and Toph's Story: First off, I like the use of Chinese through out the episode, my parent happened to watch and they caught more of it then me but I enjoy the bits I got, like how Katara's name starts with the character for card which does make a ""ka"" sound. Moving on, this episode is entirely comical with a bonding point a character developement for Toph. See, Katara notices Toph isn't the most well kept. The oepning bathroom scene was a good look into the original threesome actually. We learn that Aang actually does shave his head like a monk, that Sokka does shaves (only the teenage bit above the nose though), and Katara's loopy things have to be attached. Toph on the other hand wakes up, spits, and is ready to tackle the world. She like her fine layer of ""earth"". Katara suggest a spa, which Toph is adamant about at first, especially since she asked not to have her feet touched, which was a request ignored. I can't imagine what it's like to have your only set of 'eyes' scraped clean. Her responce is very cartoony, but very funny. But then they ahve a mud bath and a steam and she and Katara come out looking good. Healthier by a lot, but to be honest they were a bit whorish (which i find attractive but let's not open that bag of worms) Some spoiled girls make fun of Toph and Toph and Katara mix words with action by dropping them into a canal and washing them away. Toph like all tomboys revels in her, well, boyishness, but in her heart she's still a girl and that can't be forgotten. Sweet... and it only gets sweeter.<br /><br />Iroh's story: My parents really got into this one. Iroh goes looking to buy a picnic box and has a few funny adventure and little twists. He shows a shopkeeper the proper way to shade a moon flower so it will bloom (not in the dark but out of direct sunlight). He plays a paipa for a little boy crying, sing a silly song about the leaves falling from the vines and the haunting words ""Little soldier boy marching home"". He watches as some young earht benders play a game of what my dad refered to as, ""Shoalin Soccer"". This little scene had a replacement voice for Iroh but more on that later. After that Iroh almost gets mugged but after criticizing his mugger's stance and knocking him down, they become quick friends over a cup of tea. But then we learn the truth about what today is, Lu Ten's birthday. He goes under a tree, sets stone up on another and takes the arrangements out the picnic box. The moment I saw the tree and the stone palcement I knew it was a rite for the passed. I've been to enough of those with my grandmother to know it a mile away. A few offering apples, a small bag of what I assume is either money or another treat, and some incense to burn in front of a portrait. My parents picked up right away that Lu Ten was a Lieutenant from the writing on the portrait. In Honor of Mako, were the last words before the commerical break. Since Mako death I've come to realize no one can ever get his voice right. He has that deepness and the accent that can't be replicated. They should just do like the simpsons and retire the character, like when Phil hartman died.<br /><br />Aang's story: Cute animals running amuck. Entertaining but not very deep. It's cool to see that Aang has progressed enough that he can bend earth almost like a pro and can bend two different elements at once. rabbiroo babies are too cute. Also the Dragonflies, someone needs to be PUN-ished.<br /><br />Sokka's Story: Interesting note, Sokka's Ka is the same as Katara's. He stumbles on a haiku poetry school of girls, (the sign on the door had 575 and two characters I didn't recognize) and he just jumps right in. He out does the teacher with snide poems and then gets throw out for the stupidest poem that went long on the last line. It was very funny.<br /><br />Zuko's Story: Wow, zuko got cooler, then lamer, then cooler, then lamer. He's one of my favorite characters on the show, but you can see his youthful naiveness shine like the sun. He thinks a girl is on to him, but she's there to hit on him and she makes the first move. That's pimp (Cooler). He dresses fancy for the date with combed neat hair, but we all know the ladies like the mustled spiky hair and Jin (the young lady) just messes it up again. The dinner couldn't have been more awkward as Zuko shouts out that she isn't his Girlfriend (yet) and as a matter of small talk says she has ""quite the appitite for a girl"". You Moron (Lamer). When she asks about him he says he was a circus juggler and messed up juggling making a mess (Lamer still). So he can dual wield braod swords but can't juggle, I can buy that pretty easy actually. She cuts dinner short as they head to her favorite spot, the light fountain, only to find the lamps aren't lit and the fountain un-illuminated. Zuko asks her to close her eyes and Firebends like a sniper lighting all the lamps with small finger tip flames. She is amazed and he's done good (Cooler). She moves to kiss him and he throws up a free tea coupon (Lamer). She accepts and after a bit of small talk asks Zuko to close his eyes this time. She kisses him, and he kisses back (Cooler). He then pulls away telling her he's sorry and it's ""complicated"". In the previous episode he said he didn't intend to make a life in the city and probably doesn't want to be tied down. Or amybe he's afraid of being found out and then rejected. Or maybe he jsut does want to break her heart. Zuko then runs back home and locks himself in the closet (Lamer). Only to pop his head out to tell Iroh that it wasn't so bad. I like Zuko in this story, shows he has maturity and yet still has much to grow.<br /><br />Momo's story: Funny, might be my eyes but Momo's two characters are actually different. Anyway, Momo dreams and pines for his best friend Appa and with a small lock of fur (from the Chase no doubt) he uses his sense to look for hsi friend. He at first chases another Appa shaped cloud, then he finds his way to an Appa looking tree. He keeps on looking until he stops for a drink of water, unknowingly entering the territory of some wild cats. They chase, he runs, he get's mistaken for a monkey as is made ot Organ Grind. Momo doing the Mashed Potato is actually pretty funny. The cats break up the fun and chase Momo until they all get snagged in a net and sent to a butcher shop. All doesn't bode well for Momo and the cats. But Momo is very smart and can easily unlock his cage. The Cats whimper for mercy and Momo frees them too, becoming friends. One cat takes Appa's clump of fur and runs away with it. Momo chases and the cat lays it down in a small impression in the ground. Momo lies down on it, grabing the clump and looking almost sad, the camera pans up and we see it is a three toed foot print, Appa is, or was in Ba Sing Se. End show. <br /><br />Great show Avatar is. Every little joke, and character point, and action scene. It all cries genius. I implore everyone to watch this show. Trust me it's as good if not better the Spirited Away. Personally I don't get Miwazaki<br /></div>

"event","This is a great show for the guy who wants to believe in miracles and miracle men. And the Twist Endings are awesome, really straight out of left field shit. Good writing, good mystery, and great concept despite it being rip-offed (X-men). Still the demonstrative ability is subtle which is different from comics or as Hiro Nakamura calls it ""Manga"". We don't see Ali's Dark side powers which is done off camera, which makes me think Pheonix/Hulk. The clarvoyant paints what he can't control and we don't see it actualy happen. Even Hiro's powers are taken as possibly dellusions on his part (like teleporting into the woman's room when his friend is gone or going back one second in the past). Still when the powers come out in full force, you know they're real. The Superhealing cheerleader with the ribs poking out, cool. The Brother who can fly and the other whose yet able to, gold. Super Hiro coming to America, awesome. And more heroes to come next week as well as the revealation the 9th Wonder is them and the future.

Of course the question is which of these heroes would you be. I definately be Hiro. Not just for the Asian factor or that my favorite mutant power is teleporting, but he can alter time/space. He can bend reality. And he's so pure that he's not going to use them for evil, but for good like he's always wanted. Me, I might just become king of the world with his powers but Hiro's the man.

The other obvious question, I'd bang all the chicks on the show. Damn, the only ugly person on the show is Hiro and only because he's nerdy and chubby, that sucks."

"event","Truth is, whenever I play hold'em with a new person who has never seen me play, I tend to do better. I don't know if it's luck, or if I play better to impress, but whenever new people come, I tend to do well. 

Like a while back, I'm at Justin's Kegger and we get a game of Hold'em playing. I get wasted, and play okay, but got so lucky. And I've enver played at Justin's before and I just won like crazy.

My first time playing Hold'em with my brother's crew, I took the table. Since then I've had a dry spell but tonight my cousin Lawrence came over to play and I held out in the first game with him and almost won. In the next game, Lawrence left but I said I dedicate this to him, and dominated the table. In the end I was just whittling down my head's up opponent. She would not go more then the blind with me, trying to get a cheap look at the flop, and I made suree she had to pay. She doubled up a few times but in between I whittled her back down with blinds and raising before the flop. In the end I won. I tried out my new poker face, the Jester/ V Long grin, no teeth. Very painful but fun."

WE may have lost to Toronto, but Boston sucking it up big makes us the champions again this year and forever. We're going to the playoffs bitches! Whoooooaaaaa!!!! Bit buzzed, but still wishing I was in the clubhouse getting blind stinking drunk. To be a Yankee for just this night, I'd sell my first born son. 

This maybe be the greatest year of Yankee baseball ever. I feel it again this year. It'll be a subway series with the Mets and the Yankees will own them to death."

"event","New York Yankees' Hideki Matsui came abck last night and got four hits on four tries and one walk. Yankees beat Devil Rays 12-4. Steve Irwin is angry that devil rays are getting punished.

Of course the big blows came off of Bobby Abreau. Seven RBI's, six in the first off a htree run homer and a abses clearing double. Our offense is a beast.

Odd thing happened yesterday. I was going through the day when suddenly a thought popped in, if Derek Jeter walks the entirety of a game, does that mean his 21 game hit streak is over? Turns out as I learn that, that's not so under rule 10.24d. How do I know this, because Jeter walked 3 times and was hit by a pitch once, and in the last throw away innings he was removed from the game. Since he went 0-0, which means he played a game but never got an at-bat, his streak lives but we won't count this game in the streak. I told my friend Omar this and he was like humf, that's an interesting question. Later on that night he calls me and tells me I called it, which at first I didn't understand until he mention the no hit thing. I agree of course ebcause this was like some sort of twilight zone thing were my thoughts become reality. I wonder why such a random thing entered into my head in the first place. Co-incidence. Maybe."

If it was heart then that ment the poison would circluate through out his body in a crazy time, that is if it didn't stop his heart out right. Steve Irwin, was a good natured man.

"event","I hate today so much I wish I could ahve a time machine to kill myself for even going along. Okay maybe I'd make it so we went to Atlantic City but fuck it, I'd kill myself just so I can revel in a fool's death.

Okay today me and a bunch of friend's went to Six Flag's Great Adventure. It started well with me making a hummble lunch and packing some frozen water in a cooler. Oh how bad it turned. First my friend Omar ask for twenty bucks for gas, and I end up not even taking his car. And that Twenty basically went to waste to pick up a GF of someone I don't even know. I'm not saying it was a waste, but I'm thinking it hard enough. I mean we went up town and then back down town. Hell we met up with Tommy and his bro Andy halfway to Brooklyn, we couldn't do the same here? I digress.

So we were basically driving down, but Omar being a Speed freak jets ahead of us, but not by much.Just enough so that he gets his tickets first and can avid us completely. I know he didn't do this purposefully, but jeeze he could ahve been a little more there for Tommy and me. Shit, on the Jersey Trpk, we could have (and probably should have) gone to Atlantic City but no we went to Six Fuckers.

Oh they fucked me good. They fucked me long and hard. My friends got on line to ride Kingda Ka, the newest rollercoaster there. It claims to be the biggest, tallest (Damn it was tall), and fastest roller coaster. It does all this with magnetic induction like the tokyo bullet trains. Problem: appearent trouble shooting problems is only an after fucking thought. Could have fooled me. I waited after everyone in my group left, at what was then claimed to me as the two hour mark, which came after em waiting a hour in line. I sat and watched the line slowly move for 5 and a half hours, if not six. At one point I saw them doing test runs with empty trains. Afterwards they started sending people back up. So on the fifth hour I get cut off from the last group to be let in, along with the poorest Indain Family who have been there as long as I have. Half an hour after our cut off, we get news that Kingda Kucker is down for an indefinate period. Meaning they don't know when it'll come back if ever. I get off the line an march down to fucking complain. The only thing that kept me from killing the girl behind the glass taking complaint was the black owman screaming at the top of her lungs for some meaningless reason. They ended up giving me three line cut tickets that let me skip any line, but by then my time was basically gone and my fun shot. I was alone for five hours without any of my friends and without riding this rollercoaster, they basically fucked me so bad. Also I busted up the back strap of my sandel so to fix it a Jammed gum there which worked well but still it was gum on my feet.

I ended up going on Superman's ride which tilts you at ninety degrees and simulates flying on a roller coaster. Then I jumped on the Great American Scream machine. Both fun and dizzying and also made me remember one big thing. I always forget how insanely afraid of hights I am until I get on a roller coaster. I'm terrified of high places but love the thrill of rollercaosters, it's the best for me. In the end I got to ride on one roller coaster with my friends and it would be the last I got to ride today, Medusa. 

Funny thing was I resolved not to by overly price concessions but waitng on line at Kinda Fuk, dehydrates a person. They sold lemonade on the line, I refused to buy on princple but ended up getting one out of sheer need. I brought a bottle of ice water into the park, but it didn't last past the fourth hour. 

Here's the big kicker. My friend Tommy who I'm pretty close to through spend two years in the same three periods. The guy who drove me in his car. Lost his wallet riding Nitro. He assumes, but doesn't know for sure. He had it before Nitrom and after wards it was gone. So he has to get replace emnts for all his cards and lost like ten bucks. I'm not a big loss but a pain in the ass. He canceled his credit card and bank card in the park, but still have to replace his license, med card, registration for his car, metrocard, and tons other. 

Seriously, me, Tommy, and his bro Andy should have went to Atlantic City. We might have won money and not have to deal with these gaint headaches. 

Oh anf FYI, the whole time I was in the park, I ate nothing accept a bowl od dippin' dots and only when I was leaving the park. So not only was I dehydrated, but starved. Not worth sixty spent total. Three rides, what a fucking rip. Mother FUCKERS!!!!!!!!!!!!"

"event","Ever wonder if a man can truely write a woman character? Can a woman truely write a man character? I'd like to think it's possible. 

But then again how can we know how anyone else thinks other then oneself. That's a problem, because if we cannot think like the opposite sex, we're then just making images of what we see and felt. Can I write about a woman and ahve it sound like a woman without it being two dimenional. The sad trick to all my characters is that I like to act them out and feel what they're feeling, so to do this with a woman, I have to place myself in a woman's stae of mind, which is not hard but questionable. Can me thinking as a woman really be womanlike or just a dellusion that I've created.

Perhaps we all have the ability to act as the otehr sex, but just not the training. If so, can such gaps in action and knowldge be truely filled up. Perhaps, perhaps not. 

Me, I'd settle for a believeable female voice that I can constantly tap for my creative purposes."

"event","I love cooking, I love food, I love food network, I love when a plan comes together. Greatest feeling in the world really well all worlds collide.

It all started two days ago when my mom went to the supermart and got a rib roast. For those of you who don't know, a rib roast is basically a bunch of rib stakes still stuck together. She got a good deal for the whole thing at 25 bucks. Then she dropped the whole thing in my lap. She told me to cook it. and sent my on my way. 

So thinking about it, I said well why don't we dry age it and eat it on sunday. If you don't know, dry aging is basically leaving a roast or stake or otherwise hunk of good meat to dry in a cold place. See like all animal, a cow is mostly water and therefore it's stakes are mostly water. To make beef taste beefier you dry out the water. This also does a job of breaking connective tissues by allow enzymes to work with air to break the meat thus tenderizing. also it allows water soluable proteins to be released and come to the surface where we can cook them brown and taste in the brownie goodness. 

So two days of drying, I take it out and prep the oven to a low 250 while I oiled up (with bacon drippings) salt and pepper the meat. No Garlic cause it will burn in the long two hours of roasting. Yes it took two hours for a two bone rib roast and would have been twice that for a four rib roast. I didn't even put it in a 250 degree oven, when you put the roast in you back it down to 200. So most of the day I was watching the Yankee game. Not a lot of work really. But cooking is like baseball, you have to be able to stand around for hours doing nothing and then jump into action and go deep.  After the roast hit an internal temp of 118, (I own a digiatl themometer that rings, Sweet) I have to pull it out. Then I pump that mother hizzy oven to 500 and let the roast rest while the oven gets rocket hot. I mean when I opened my gas oven when it hit 500, smoke came out. Meanwhile, I had to steam broccoli, make garlic oil for my boiling spaghetti which was also boiling, and make mashed potatoes  from scratch. Also you don't want the inside too cooked, just the outside of the roast to get crusty. So after the allowed time you have to pull it out. 

Here's something I forgot to mention, When it comes to roasting smaller thing I use my cast iron pan. Works well...but. Well Cast iron is a gnarly conductor and retainer of heat. Five hundred degrees of heat just poured from this fucker and I had to get it out of the hot hot oven. Even with dish towels folded and wetted down with cold water, it didn't take long to convert my towels to steam burning packets of pain.  So with lightning speed I rip it out the oven in put it on the resting spot, then I drop the towels and blow hard. A few more seconds and I would have had a nasty burn I think, but such is cooking. 

I don't have hands of asbestos, but in due time maybe. 

As for the roast, well it was nice and pink in the middle and the jus sauce I made from reduced wine was pretty good complement. The broccoli was a little raw though, but that won't kill you. And the potatoes were a little wet but with some heat and stiring it came together nicely. The Spaghetti came out perfectly if you're wondering.

Oh and watch Good Eats on the Food network. Just a plug for Alton Brown."

I don't know who I should be mind you, but I feel I shouldn't be me. It's not like I want ot be someone else, but I just don't feel comfortable just being me. Uncomfortable in my own skin? Little bit.

I wasn't always like this was I? Maybe I was. 

Perhaps it's just manic-depression. Maybe I'm totally nuts. Yeah, I should maybe kill myself. What am I thinking? But when I get this way, I can't help but feel something is just not right with my world.

I was no more than five minutes away from home when I saw this sparkly thing.  It didn't glow like a ball, but it had the figure a person a tinny person, and it went THUMP! when it hit my windshield. O_O  

I kid you not, I swear it was a fairy.  I HIT A Fairy!?!?  BIRDS DON'T GLOW, AND NEITHER DO BATS!!!  It is halloween after all and weird things are bound to happen....  But hitting a fairy!?!  Oh gosh, I wonder if that will come back to haunt me."

"event","Okay... So I said I was going to ignore Sorin.  So I moved to the back of the room, in my studio art class.  We seem to run into each other a lot.  Yeah, weird.  Well any way I don't talk to him and I pretend like he is not even there.  Whats more annoying, is he doesn't seem to notice. Damn jerk.

But as far as good news goes, Makani and Mi-chan are back together.  How do I know?  well I kind of stumbled onto the both of them making out....  I was heading home Thursday afternoon, and I passed by the chemistry lab, and I could hear a familiar voice talking.  I was like Hey!  Thats Makani's voice.  I wonder who the womanizer has now???  

I peered into the classroom to see that he had Misako pressed up against the chalk-board and he was kissing the Bajeeezes out of her.  I have never seen a man hang onto woman before like she is thin piece of fishing wire (a life line of some sort) and he is using her to drag himself out of some kind of watery dispare. She didn't seem to be putting any resitsance...  He whispered something about keeping it a secret.  Keep what a secret?  I am not sure but I am assuming that they are back together, and he doesn't want anyone to know.  I am not sure if I like him much any more.

I was buggin... I swear my mouth must have been hanging open. I was like woah.  Duuuuuude... In the chemistry lab?  Oh, well I am glad one of us is happy..   I won't say anything except to Kahtia.  

On another note.  The midget man is back, and I swear he is following me around every where.  I see him all the time. I would ask Sorin what is going on, but I really don't want to talk to him. =_=  Stupid jerk, bet he only likes pretty woman.  Bet he is attracted to midget men.. Truthfully, out of everything that has been going on, that would be the first thing that has made sense in a long time."

"event","Well me and Kahtia discussed a plan for getting Mi-chan out of her room.  Kahtia and I stood outside her door and talked in a low/loud whisper... Low enough it sounded like a whisper... Loud enough she could hear us LOL.  I said I was going for a walk, and Kahtia said she was going to some kind of store that sells musical instruments for really cheap.  OUr thinking, we leave the house and maybe she would come out of hiding long enough to eat something.

In actuallty... I left with Kahtia, and we both went to the beach...  We ended up discussing everything...  We decided getting answers by force was best left to anime characters.... LOL Then Kahtia said something that surprised me.. She said when Sorin got angry she could see that his hair was white...  She had forgotten to say  something about it earlier... How do you forget something like that!?  She said she also noticed the color of Makani's hair?  Gah!!  I didn't even notice!! Damn....  Then she told me that she decided I wasn't crazy any more.... LOL  I didn't know whether to laugh or throw her into the ocean....

After Monday I was really beginning to hate Sorin.  Makani wasn't so bad..  Untill, he made Mi-chan cry.. Now he is an evil son of a &#%@($&.... Bah..  Things couldn't get worse... Well actaully it can... So I better keep my mouth shut... 

We got home, and sure enough Mi-chan was out of her room.  She said she felt better after eating left over pizza. Note to self... Have lots of left over pizza..  Any she told me as we were sitting on the living room floor, that she noticed Sorin's hair was white.. So they both saw it..  Its feels great not being alone.  Kahtia informed Misaku that she finally saw both Makini, and Sorin's hair...

I decided I was going to shun Sorin from now on... I was going to move to a different spot during studio art so I didn't have to sit next to him.  If he was going to play games, I wasn't going to stan for it.. I don't understand fully what is going on, and I know there is a lot more going than I can see.  Seriously.. Midget people follow us around campus, and listening to little pixie laughs coming from trees isn't my idea of normal."

"event","It's that time again.  You know, where I go into an emotional overload and I can't keep it in anymore.  Its been an absolutely horrible week.

I  am just going to get right to the point.  Misuko has locked herself in her room, and has decided to stay there all weekend.  Kahtia and I have tried doing everything to get her to come out.  But, she won't.

It all started when Sorin met Makani.  Sorin, has become good buddies with us, ever since those strange things on campus started happening.. Go figure.  Well anyway, now he walks us home every Mondays and Wednesdays.  Its obvious that he has somehting to do with it, or some part in it. I am not sure what.

Monday, he walked us up to the door just as Makani and Mi-chan were coming out.  When they saw each other they froze.  You know that feeling you get when you're standing in a room full of very heated tension?  Thats what it felt like.  Invisible sparks where flying.  

Then they started talking in a language none of us ever heard before.  It was beautiful, and yet disturbingly familiar. I know I've heard it some where, but then again I had never heard it before.  UGH,  its just complicated to explain.  I don't know how you dexcribe it. 

Then the next thing we knew Makani started to turn and leave abruptly. Misaku went after him, and when she went to grab his arm, he snapped away from her rather rudely. Then he turned toward her and said, ""stop it, go away and leave me alone."" Then he turned and walked off down the street.

Kahtia and I looked at each other.  That wasn't like Makani at all.  We knew he liked Mi-chan a lot.  Mi just stood there looking helpless.  Then she turned around and walked back inside the dorm.  Kahtia went after her.  

When I asked Sorin, what the hell was going on, he gave me a sharp look then turned and left.  I was half tempted to pick up a rock and heave it at his head.

During the week I have been trying to talk to Sorin, but he won't even look at me.  I went to Makani's dorm and ended up getting serious tongue lashing from him.  Really!?!?!  What the hell is going on???  Mi-chan tried one attept to talk to him, and he said the same thing he had said to her last time.

Thursday, me and Kahtia had all we could take.  Me and Kahtia were very angry.  Kahtia and I cornered Makani to ask him why he was behaving the way he was.  That turned ugly.  We got a verbal assult about how stupid little girls should mind their own bussiness.  

Now I was mad.  I wanted to smack him so bad, and I was going to.. If Kahtia hadn't beaten me to it.  She Kicked him hard in the crauch, and she began screaming that if she ever saw his face again she was going to stick his manliness on a pike and and set it on fire...(thats what she said.)  While I wish I was the one who had done it, Mi-chan was the one to hear about it.  He yelled at her on Friday, when she was heading home from class.

Hence why she has locked herself up in her room.  She is mad at me and Kahtia, she is mad at HIM, and she is mad at the world...  (sigh) Now I am stressing out, because she won't come out and eat.


---I love you Misako... There must be a way... T_T"

Thank goodness.  The thought of him following me and my friends home at night, doesn't exactly help me get to sleep..  I wish kursur was here... 

Sorin has taken to walking me and Kahtia home on some nights.  He doesn't say why, but we can take a wild guess..  Oh well,  sexy men can walk me home anytime.. As long as they look and not touch.  I suppose Mi-chan walks home with Makani..  Lately he has been hanging out at our dorm on weekends, and him and Kahtia have taken to beating each other on Super Smash Bros.  

Lol then all four of us got into a pillow fight.. Actaully it was three of us versuses Makani... I don't remember how it started....

I kept dosing off.  He told me he could finish the rest later, and decided it was best to keep the portrait at his house..

When I got home I tried to sneak into my room.  I was shocked to find kahtia and Mi-chan sleeping on my bed.. How the two of them fit on a twin bed I will never know..  Kahtia woke up first asking what time it was...  Was she mad that I was home late... Oh you betcha...

Today in Class she lectured Sorin about keeping me out during the witching hours, and telling him how mad  and worried she was.  While I was greatful she cared, I was sooo embarrest and the whole class heard everything..  Sorin looked like he was trying really hard not to laugh.  I on the other hand I wanted to crawl under my desk and hide..  I could hear some guys in my class say something about getting lucking.. I just wanted to shrivel up and die..

"event","Sooo.. here it is... I thought I better write this down before this becomes to far in the past, and I don't feel like telling about it anymore...

Thursday 29-  Folklore class just let out and Mi-chan and I were heading home, or so I thought..  Makani was waiting outside the door.  Mi-chan looked at me and told me she had forgotten to tell Kahtia and I that she had made plans to go hang out with Makani... She forgot!?!?! Like hell she ""forgot.""  The girl has a memory like a tape recorder...  I'll be damned if she didn't plan this.

I didn't know what these weird haired people were like?  For all I knew they probably weren't even human!  They were probably aliens or something..  When deciding on going to college together we swore two things.  One, that we would live by our own rules, and two, that we would look out for each other.  We don't hang out twenty-four seven.  Oohhh no, we would kill each other in that amount of time.  But, we are like sisters, so you can understand how something like this would bother me...  I mean, what if something happen to her because she ""forgot"" to tell me or Kahtia!?!?  Had Kahtia even met him yet?

Then he did something that surprised me.  He said since they weren't in that big of a hurry did he want Mi-chan and him to walk me home.  Why is this surprising you might ask?? Well pull me off my high horse and slap me... I guess aliens can be courteous too...  Well common courtesy coming from a stranger(let alone a good looking guy) is rare these days.  

Mi-chan was chewing on her bottom lip, she looked like she was ready to go..  I declined politely and walked home alone...  She got home late that evening...  Oh course Kahtia wasn't happy.. After Kahtia had gotten done yelling, I said jokingly he must of thought I was weird..  Mi-chan looked at me and said no he actually thought I thought he was weird, but he did say ""Your friend think's I am an alien"" and began laughing..  All I could think was OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG there is no way...  I didn't say that out loud did I???
 
Friday 30- I hid most of the day and pondered everything that has been happening over the last couple of weeks...  Mi-chan went out with Mikani again, and Kahtia went to school get caught up on one of her projects..  Me left alone with my own though, let me tell you it is never good...

Saturday 1st of October..  Kahtia was treating Misako and I to dinner, so she went out to get some Chinese food..  Misako was catching up on some Asian studies, so I decided to go for a walk..  I ended up atleast half a mile away from the dorms..  I didn't intend for that to happened, it just did.  The sun was going down and it was getting late so I decided to head back...  On the way home I passed the main school building...

In front of the main building there were wooden stick figures all over the front lawn, and they were all holding signs.  I walked past one stick figure, that had eyes and a mouth smeared on with yellow paint.. The sign it was hold said: I demand to be treated like a person two!""  I couldn't help it.. I began giggling... 

I don't know where he came from, but all of a sudden that little midget man was there.  He sort of scuttled over to me like a crab...  He had a nasty grin on his face, and he was holding something shiny in his right had.. Some kind of blue green stone in the shape of arrow head.. Ugh, he was laughing, or I think he was laughing.. It was a kind laugh were you draw in deep ragged breaths, and it sounds like you are hissing. I don't know how you describe it... 

Then he stopped and about ten feet away and looked at me..  He stopped that nasty cackle and his eyes grew wide..  He was looking past me.. The next thing I knew, he turns and runs (waddles) away. I was freaked out..  I had no clue what scared him away, which was actually a kind of relief.  I turned to see who was standing behind me.  

A part of me expected no one to be there.  I yelped anyway when I saw Sorin standing inches from me..  I was close to death and a near bed wetting experience...

To make an already long story short, there happened to be a stick figure holding the second portrait Sorin had drew of me.  The picture was glued to its limbs.  Upon closer inspection, my face now had a honking big nose, and devil horns...   I couldn't help but laugh.. Everything that has been happening has been sooo ridiculous..  Sorin looked pissed, as he wrenched the stick figure man out of the ground.. I should be the one who is angry.  I don't have a clue what is going on around here. Before I knew it, I totally blew up on him..  I was yelling things about his hair being white, the midget man,  and how he keeps shunning me, and how I was getting annoyed with him stalking off.  The least he could do is give me some answers...

All of a sudden he just starts laughing..  LAUGHING!  I was fuming and he found it funny...  The next thing I knew, we had a date set up for Sunday night and he was inviting me over to his apartment to redo my portrait again.....  And thats what happened Sunday... (sighs)"

"event","Well yesterday Mi-chan told me she met a guy yesterday. she told us (kahtia and I) That he was very flirty.  Which is weird because she is the one usually flirting.... Kahtia asked him what he looked like, and all she got out of Mi-chan was, he is very sexy... LOL  Thats our girl...

On our way home from folklore (which ends at seven) I got to meet this mystery man.  She waved at him, and I have to admit he did have an award winning smile.  He greeted back with really odd accent...   I had never heard anything like it.  It was really beautiful...  He just smiled and walked on past us... Or he would have if Misako hadn't stopped him in his tracks when she said, ""I love your your hair, it matches the night sky.""  I froze and he froze... Misako kept walking,  while humming a tune.  I stood looking at him, trying really hard to see what color his hair was.... I looked dark brown under the streetlights.  He just stared at Misako with a distant expression on his face..


Now I have to admit I was jealous... How does Mi-chan do it?  The guy looked like he would have kissed her feet if she asked him to...  I can't even get Sorin to notice me... (sigh) 

When I caught up to her, she began to speak. Mi-chan told me his name was Makani.  Thinking back to when I swore Sorin's hair was white, she serious consider I might have a new form of color blindness. But, when she saw Makani the other day, she noticed his hair was weird.  There wasn't any shade of hair quite like it... They met during chance the other day, and she said it was like looking at the evening sky in the afternoon.  She didn't say anything about it to him yesterday because she was baffled.  Tonight, with me there, she felt a little braver about saying something about it.  But, not brave enough to stick around.... She didn't want to face an awkward silence...

So this means Sorin is not the only one....  How many guys, even girls, walk around campus with the strange hair colors.  How come I can see Sorin's, and not Makani's?  How come she can see Makani's and not Sorins... I think something is happening that is bigger than both of us...

Hopefully theren't any midgets following us tonight...."

He came in ten minutes late looking tired and weary, like he was about to drop...  He plopped down into the seat next to me, and let his head sag on the back of his chair..  I found myself blushing for no reason..  He looked at me out of the corner his eye, and I quickly looked away..  

Oh course Kahtia started snickering... I was nervous  wreck... I hate being uncomfortable in my favorite class.

There were some girls at the front the of the class who had turned around to stare..  I noticed they had been staring at Sorin since the first art class we had..  They were glaring at me right now, with disgusted looks on there faces... I wasn't one to take that, so I glared back at them.  I can dish out a wicked glare if need be.  I have yet to meet anyone that could do it better than I could.. It did the trick and they turned around in there seat..

After class Kahtia told me she thought it was funny.. She even said Sorin had noticed I was glaring at the two girls, and he was smiling as well.  I just looked at her.. I bet she is making it up.  He seemed to out of it to notice anything. 

On our way home Kahtia said she saw a really short man following us.  I had forgotten all about that stupid midget, and that neither Mi-chan nor I had told her of our encounters with a midget...   I'm not going to get any sleep tonight with that in mind...."

"event","It is sooooooo late!!!!  I just woke up....  I went to see the Corpse Bride with Misako and Kahtia last night.  I thought it was endearing, and cute.  Not as good as the Nightmare Before Christmas though.  Misako and I agreed that it didn't have enough conflict, but it was good all the same.   We went to a late showing, and it wasn't as crowded as I though it would be..

Anyway, after the movie we went out to the car and they blind folded me with a bandanna... It was really strange and all three of us were very giggly...  During the car ride I could hear them arguing in the front seat over which turn off to take, and which road they were supposed to be on, and that they thought they had went the wrong way..  Since I couldn't see what was going on I just kept giggling.  Then, Misako cheered and said that we were heading in the right direction.  I felt the car turn in some where and we parked.

Then we got out of the car and they led me for a ways, now and then the would say watch step, there is a curb.  Or, now we are going down some steps. But,it was obvious to me where we were.    There is no mistaking the sounds of the waves rolling in and out, the sound of a sleepy sea gull that could be heard cooing in the distance.  It was so nice, and it was soo them too!  They were so wonderful, I didn't know whether to cry or run up and down the beach.  It was night and the stars were out and the moon was just starting its phases.  It was so wonderful!!  

Not going to get into any more mushy detail..  Mostly I spilled my guts, they listened giggled and poked fun, then we began to talk of other things and reminisce.  All in all we stayed out till 3:00 in morning, walking the beach or sitting, then went home and crashed in the living room area.  I just woke up, and Kahtia is still a sleep.  Mi-chan said she had been awake since 11.  She has been doing home work...  

I am ready to take on tomorrow.. I just don't want to face Sorin...(cringes)"

"event","My friends Misako and Kahtia are soo good to me...  They could tell I was really down about something..  Due to past experiences they have learned not to pry, when I am ready I will come out and tell them.  At certain times, that can take weeks...  So today they tried getting it out of me a little quicker..  No one likes a bump on a log, so in order to start the process of cheering me they started telling me some quotes they had picked out of magazines.  I had to admit it did make laugh.  

It started with Kahtia saying you know Cali, you seem down... You know the key to happiness?  The secret to happiness is a good sense of humor and bad memory.  Misako said I looked as confused as a hungry baby in a topless bar.
Or they would say things like, ""If there is some kind of goal you are striving for, well behaved women rarely make history.."" ( I wonder if that has some kind of hidden meaning.)Then we ended up with quotes like : Always forgive your enemies; nothing annoys them so much!!!And thoughtful ones such as If your parents never had children, chances are you won't, either. Or even, I always remember to resist everything except temptation!!! Or, I feel like I'm diagonally parked in a parallel universe. And my all time favorite!!!  Put on your big girl panties and deal with it!!


Then we got into philosophical questions such as:
""Sure, everyone always said 'Socrates what is the meaning of life?' or
'Socrates how can I find happiness?,' did anyone ever say 'Socrates
hemlock is poison???????""  Or, I wonder how much deeper the ocean would be without sponges....

Now they are taking me out to see the Corpse Bride, and then they said they had a suprise for me at the end of the movie... I'm excited... They sure do know how to get one out of a bad mood!!!"

I just stood back and watched them plan my future for me.... It felt like I was watching T.V.  I couldn't say anything they were ignoring me.. 

After that Kahtia started giving me dating tips..... even thought we weren't going out. It was like:

Rule 1.)  When smiling, let him know that you want him, but don't show any teeth.  It takes points away if you have anything stuck in them. (Did I have something stuck in between my teeth when he was drawing me!?!? OMG WAS THAT WHY HE WAS LAUGHING.)

Rule 2.) Play hard to get... Act like he doesn't hold your interest... (But he does hold my interest, and his hair is white and I like looking at it.... Wooo can't get enough of that white hair..) 

Rule 3.) When he finally does ask you out, and things start getting serious, ask him to sing the Idiot Boyfriend song... (Gah....)

Rule 4.) Ask him if he would still love you even you didn't have pinky finger, or if you were really a man... ( NO I AM NOT A MAN THANK VERY MUCH.)

The dating tips get scarier from here on out...

Wednesday-  Misako and I were walking back from our Folklore class when we saw the strangest sight.  We were walking by the shop class ( I think thats what it was) and there was a midget man in there.  He resembled a gnome...  He was short and his beard was black, and very burly.  It looked like he was steeling a large tube of wood glue.  Misako saw him first and pointed him out to me. He turned around and glared at us dubiously... He had dark rings under his eyes that made him look devious. Except for the fact that he was short, he might have been really intimidating... Then he took a his chubby pointer-finger, pressed it to his lip, and grinned... It wasn't a nice grin mind you... Then he scuttled off somewhere in the room.  I peeked my head in to see where he was going, and he was gone... Talk about creepy... 

On the way home we were discussing what we had seen, and we were walking by a vacant lot between two houses.  It was over run by scrubs and bushes and a really big tree.  As we were walking by we heard what sounded like girlish kid-like laughter. Then there was the noise of something scurrying about, and the bushes and scrubs started swaying.  We didn't see anything. Something in the tree started giggling and the limbs started shaking....  So we decided to walked home faster.....

Misako later dismissed it as stupid kids.  I didn't believe it, and I don't think she belived it either...

Thursday- Someone had put wood glue all over Sorin's portrait of me.  I couldn't say that I was unhappy, but I couldn't say I was disappointed...  I was still paranoid that something had been in between my teeth and he drew it in.  Sorin however, wasn't happy.  He had the darkest look on his face I had ever seen...  I wanted to go back to my dorm... Today was turning into a bad day...  Sorin did ask if tomorrow (meaning today) if I could come to the studio so he could do it over...  I had to contain myself, I almost screamed YEAH!!!!

Today- Because Sorin had to do my portrait over, it seemed to take forever... I can't sit still for very long and my butt was really beganing to hurt....  Then I mentioned that Misako and I saw a midget man in wood shop steeling wood glue...  He paused and stared at me... Bad conversation topic... Stupid stupid stupid...  His eyes felt like they were burning a hole into the side of my head.. I had to say something...  So I said... Ummm, Potty.... I got up and walked out of the room...  When I came back he was putting his stuff away....  I felt my heart sink to my stomache.. I guess I made him mad....  He walked past me and didn't say a thing.. It was like I wasn't even there....
I don't have a chance with him, I can see that now...

It wasn't till I got home did I realized how stupid I must have sounded... Really a midget steeling wood glue!?!?!  He probably thinks I did....."

"event","Today was awkward. In my art studio, our teacher told us to pair up.  For our next assignment we have to do a portrait of our partner...  I didn't get a chance to ask Kahtia, the girl next to her asked her first.. Kahtia has a hard time saying no...  The girls name was Sandy, Sasha, or something like that.  I was to crestfallen to care...  Its hard for me to talk to other people.  

I looked up to see the guy next me staring at me... You know the one with the pretty white hair.  Well, he asked if I wanted to be partners.  I was shocked.  I wanted to sit there and say OOOOH YEAH BABY! YOU BET! Nothing came out, I was speechless.  My mouth was opening and closing, but no words were coming out
....  Never had a cute guy ask me to be his partner..  Wait that sounded bad... What I ment by that is I never had a cute guy ask to do a project with me...  When I didn't answer he looked uncomfortable.  I finally squeezed out a Yes!  I must have taken to long to give him an answer because he looked slightly embarrassed. I couldn't stop smiling no matter how hard I tried.  I could tell I had a big goofy grin on my face, but there wasn't much I could do about it. I also found out is his name!!! It's Sorin....

After class Kahtia and I were walking home together, and she told me she had been watching the whole thing.  She said she was so glad that she choose to sit behind me. She thinks we are funny, and that its going to be an entertaining semester... I didn't know whether I liked that or not...  She told me she was trying so hard not laugh at me during class.  She said I looked very happy with myself, and while he was drawing me he was trying to hide his smile behind his canvas.  Another shocker....  Then she screamed I have to tell Misako!  Oh gosh, I wasn't going to hear the end of it for the rest of the night. FROM EITHER OF THEM..... I grabbed hold of her trying to keep her from running back to the dorm and telling Misako... Which was pointless because Misako would have found out anyway.  We were screaming and laughing like we were twelve years old, as I tried to keep a hold on her and as she tried to fend me off.

Wouldn't you know it... Guess who was standing not but twenty feet away... thats right... You guessed it.. Sorin!!  He  was just staring at us!!! Kahtia manage to get free, and took off..  I didn't know what to do I just looked from her to him, from her to him...  Finally I just walked away trying to make it look like nothing had happened...   How awkward could this day get...."

"event","Okie... So today Kahtia, Misako, and I were walking around campus... Its a really beautiful campus..  I was talking about wanting to go to the beach, and possibly making regular trips there.  I love the ocean... Love love love.  My very first love...  I was in such a good mood.  We had just gotten back from the councilor's office..  Someone had told me we could keep animals at the dorms!!  So Kahtia, and Misako went with me to the main office.  I am soooo happy!!!  The councaler confirmed it!!!  So after Christmas I am going home and bringing Kurser (my border collie/ borzoi) back with me!!

That was the good part.... Now for the bad part.  As we were walking back to the dorm, I saw HIM! You know who I am talking about... I don't know his name.. I was to scared to ask him during my studio art class. He is kind of  hard to miss.  His hair is white! He was standing next to a group of other guys talking about something.

I pointed him out to Kahtia, and Misako.  Misako agreed with Kahtia, his hair was black.  I insisted it was white.  Then Misako said I must have something wrong with my vision...  There is nothing wrong with my vision!  That stung the most.  Why then would I see black hair on other men!?!?!?  We started arguing, me and Misako, while Kahtia was trying to get us to drop it.  When we did finally stop, to our embarrassment, the guys were all looking at us....  Then they began laughing, and calling out rude things like... Woooo Cat fight! And Ohhh yea baby, where can I get me some of that. 

I was so mad... Guys can be such s.o.b's.  None of us said a word on our way back to the dorm...  Talk about throwing a wrench into things.  Gah, I wish I had a wrench!!! I would wack those guys so badly with it!!! They would rue the day their mother's met their fathers.... I think it is a wide spread conspiracy, and that men aren't actually from this planet.  They are just here because they think its funny, and to say obnoxious things....."

"event","I get this strange feeling when I am at school.  Like something is out of place.  You know that creepy feeling you get when you go for walks at night by yourself???  Well thats what it feels like except all the time..  It doesn't matter whether its day or night..  

Been in school for almost four and a half weeks, and I have gotten used to it by now. Anyway, I needed to write this down somewhere because it is to weird.  On the first of my studio art class I sat next to a guy who was really cute.  He hand nice Roman featured face, and dark mocha colored skin... He had a nice muscular body, but it wasn't overly muscular either.  Well, like I was saying, I sat down next to him in my art studio and he turned and smiled at me.  I noticed his hair is white.  I mean white white. Like the color of snow, and his eyes were a blue green color.

I was imaging myself drawing him. His hair was beautiful.  I was thinking aloud and I said to him, your hair is pretty.  It would look really good with a moonlight glow to it.  He just looked at me like I grew two heads.  Kahtia (my bestfriend) was sitting behind me and she just began snickering. 

After class he disappeared.  I am not sure where.  Gosh, I complimented the guy on his hair, he takes off.  I told Kahtia after class.  She looked at me the same way he did, like I had grown two heads. She was like no Calista his hair was black! Now it was my turned to look at her funny.  It wasn't black!  I was sitting right next to him.  

Kahtia didn't laught at me, and I was greatful.. We got back to the dorm and I told Misako (my other bestfriend) everything. She didn't laugh either, but she wanted to really see th guy I was talking about.  Neither Kahtia nor I ever got a chance to show her. He has been very good at eluding us... I still sit next to im class, though.  He tries not to look at me.  He gives me that weird feeling of walking alone at night.  I kept peeking at him out of the corner of my eye. Sure enough it was white.. Kahtia says, its black.  How bazaar is that...."

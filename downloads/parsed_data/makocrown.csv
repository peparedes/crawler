Pagan and L.C. have both shuffled off this mortal coil, within weeks of each other.  I would not have been sad to see them leave the HOUSE, but I had no wish for them to leave this plane of existence.  And the Giant has been touring around India, returning only recently, smelling of cow and desert gerbil.  I shudder to think what the summer will bring..."

The past two months have been an unspeakable mix of anxiety and torment.  The Giant persisted and yet persists in attending to the needs of the Objectionable Tabby and the Invader Cats at the expense of my needs.

I am very cross about this.

I'm tired of hearing about 'Poor Pagan' this and Lucky Catt that.  Why should they jeopardize so much of the Giant's time?  I've given many rejoinders about the situation, both vocal and physical, to no avail.

On Friday The Giant did not leave for work before dawn, but that did not concern me so much as she had spent several days home sick during the week.  However, when I was once again confined to the computer room, I knew something was afoot.  There was a brief period of thumping and stomping, then silence.  Much later in the day, I was released and decided to run into the bedroom and take shelter under the bed to sort things out.  My attempt was met with a rude discovery - there is no more under the bed.  The bed is now solid from mattress to floor.  How inconsiderate!  How thoughtless!  How beyond the pale - in other words, how very human.

     I am writing this from the computer room (natch) but I am in the computer room as a captive, not as a willing feline.  This morning, I was feeling unwell in a digestive sense.  I realized I must have developed a hairball and realized that it was going to make an egress from my system.  Normally the Giant is very sympathetic when I am unwell, but today, when I ran into the bedroom to regurgitate the offensive matter, she was not.  She was ranting and raving about how only two rooms in the house have carpet, and only one of them is white, and why did I choose to be sick here as opposed to anywhere else.  And then, I was closed up in this room, with nothing more than food, water, a bed and my litter-convenience.  And of course, this computer and Internet connection.  But other than that, what have the Romans ever done for me?"

However, not two hours later, she was back, with a pointy-haired, even taller giant in tow.  He looked vaguely familiar, and not quite as terrifying as the other giants who occasionally come and go, but I must wonder as to the plans of mice and men.  Particularly men.  Am I to be allowed to nap in peace?  Will they depart again for parts unknown, or linger about the place?  Chloe, of course, had to be fed upon their arrival.  Maybe that will keep the yowling down."

I must make this a brief posting, as I have urgent matters to attend.  The Giant, as I have noted prior, is not satisfied with the interior of our dwelling.  This weekend she set out to turn the walls of her bedroom a different shade of blue.  Which is fine, except she did not explicitly warn me of this.  Which is why parts of my normally dapper coat are a light shade of blue.  To worsen matters, the Giant seems to think I need assistance in removing the paint.  I will NOT be bathed by others."

(Come to think of it, is there any other type of Aussie ex-pat bar?  And wouldn't The Sin Bin be a most appropriate name for one?).   And the Springboks were not even playing - she had gone to see the Wallabies and the Kiwis have at it.  
     I am not unreasonable - if the Giant wishes to spend her disposable income and time on such things she may - but this inconvenienced me.

I have exciting news to impart - I encountered a new creature from my window perch.  I was sitting on the Giant's dresser, which affords a fine view of the side yard.  Two days ago, the panes of glass were fully blocked by tawny colored fur.  Yes, you deduce correctly, I was visited by a fine specimen of Odocoileus virginianus.  The female of the species grazed on the thistles and stickerbushes that crop up on that side of the property.  It was thrilling to see this creature that everyone speaks of, but that I never had a chance to see."

     I apologize for the two month gap in posting.  Rather than reporting that there was nothing worth reporting, I must admit that I was under the bed for a large part of the time.  You see, the Giant was disappointed with the performance of the house that surrounds us, and she paid some tradesmen to come remedy the flaws.  At one point all the windows were removed and replaced, at another the sides of the house so treated.  

     The noise was beyond belief.  The thumping and banging and clanging and assorted other parts of cacophany  would have driven a lesser person to delirium.  And the so called music that the rude mechanicals chose to blast did not help matters.

     Such disturbances seem to have been curbed for the moment, so I can be a better conveyor of feline about the house matters.   Such as the growing irritability of the Objectionable Tabby.  She is stepping over the line of Objectionable and heading directly for truculent."

Pagan missed his companion and was slightly more tolerant of my presence.  The Giant would allow us to socialize for small periods of time, scooping me up whenever things got out of hand.  I do believe progress was being made...

This morning however, a new wrinkle appeared.  Not so much a wrinkle, but another feline!  Yes, and just to show that the Universe will not be upstaged, this new arrival is bigger than Pagan.  Pagan, now that I look at him in light of the new, is just fat.  His head and paws are those of a smaller beast.  L.C. on the other hand is enormous in all aspects.  He even has extra toes, to make his paws all the more gargantuan.  He and Pagan were sparring in the Middle Sector, which displeased the Giant.  She called then 'ninnies' and made reference to their having been housemates earlier on in life.  As they carried on in their warring behavior, she decided to separate them by placing the larger one in MY sector.

At which point she inelegantly rolled me over onto the other side of the bed that was not warm, and did not have a nice Mako sized hollow burrowed into it.  I was scandalized, Dear Reader, and trotted off to show my displeasure.  To whom, well, that is another story, as Objectionable Tabby was not sympathetic at all.  One would think that a feline who consistently says ""It isn't fair"" might have some sympathy for others, but one would be mistaken.
Again, I end with a Harrumph!"

"event","Well dear readers, things have been alternately dull and exciting since my last post.  The Giant left the house last Friday night and returned with another giant, who took up residence in the spare room that O.T. and I are not allowed to enter.  They both went to sleep fairly early - and arose several hours before dawn!  There was a brief period of activity and coming and going, then the front door closed for good.

When the front door re-opened later that day, I thought it was a return of my giant.  But it was a different one, so I headed under the bed, where a person can truly feel safe.  When I felt the cost was clear, I reconnoitered the area and found fresh food and freshened litter.

This continued for seven days.

I thought this might be a good time to try and connect with Objectionable Tabby.  I was incorrect.  She spent the time sulking (nothing new) and wolfing her kibble down.

On Saturday, the Giant re-appeared just as suddenly, with the same two pieces of luggage but many different scents.  I cannot believe that she went to Black's Barbecue as well as Kruez's and only brought back postcards.  It is the 21st century - how hard could it be to return with some brisket for the cat?  Or at least a sausage ring.

It seems the Giant was eating and revelling her way through South Central Texas, soaking up history and tequila, while I was left with no one to sleep on and just O.T. for company.  Harrumph."

We continued the dance until this afternoon, when the giant reappeared.

I have heard her speaking since her return of Peahala Park and salt water and sand.  I am not sure what the delight humans take in sand is all about - I have only one use for it.  I suppose there is no tuna flavored salt water taffy,  but an offering of fresh fish would not be out of the question!"

The giant brought two other giants home this evening and tried to carry me out to meet them.   I was amenable, but when I saw one giant, was, in fact giant, I decided to take shelter under the bed.  They seem to have gone (I hope they did not journey all the way to Hub City just to catch a glimpse of me) and so I thought I would write in my journal.

I personally can sleep for hours and hours before arising at 2 a.m. to ferociously hunt foam soccer balls and catnip mice.  On the other hand, she still insists on grooming herself with water and soap, rather than just using saliva and a barbed tongue.

Part of the activity this weekend was seeing one of Will S's plays in a Greek ampitheatre.  How she and her companion, the giant giant got to Greece and returned home by 11 p.m.  I am unsure.  I thought the American SST program had been shelved in favor of more commercially viable transport, but perhaps I am mistaken.

O.T. continues to be more objectionable than not.  She does not want to converse civilly, act civilly or have anything to do with civility.  I may have to call Sir Kenneth Clark if this continues."

 Her musings give pause as well.  For instance, I was sitting under the dining room table today as she walked by.  She said ""I know he's around here somewhere.  He has to be.  Everybody has to be somewhere.""  I suggested that she replace that quote with one from the venerable Buckaroo Bonzai ""No matter where you go, there you are"".

Which, if you could see the state of this house, seems to be the least needed cleaning tool.  Why bother poking around under a person's bed with a broom when there is a fine layer of dust on everything?  And the clutter.  Let us not speak of the newspapers piled up on the dining table, or the mail accumulating in the kitchen.  I dashed from my room in a panic when this all started and dove under another bed.  Moments later, O.T.'s face was poking under the bedskirt at me!  

She of course, hissed, then sat back on her considerable haunches.  We gazed at each other for quite a while before the giant discovered us and coaxed O.T. out of the room, giving me a chance to dash back out and under my own bed.  I like a clean house - my white gloves make me a natural for inspecting the maid's work - but this is absurd.  I can only hope that we have better results for our exertions next time."

"event","Hello Dear Readers

I've not been able to refresh my blog for a while as the giant has persisted in not being at home.  I understand that she has a job, unlike me, but really, after work she seems to finds all sorts of things to distract her from coming to pay attention to me and O.T.  Wednesday she arrived home a full hour and a half early, which cheered me, but she quickly changed clothes and was gone again for hours.  I understand that the other giants were well pleased with the raspberry rhubarb pies she procured in her absence, but really...

Thursday was also marked by another early arrival, but the extra time was immediately taken up with baking honeycake, which I don't particularly care for.  Almost as soon as the loaves were out of the oven, she bundled them up and was gone for hours.  I was concerned when she returned, as it looked as if she had burned her hand by leaning on a decorative grillwork that had been heated.  However, she was quite comfortable petting me with the patterned hand, and when I had a chance to sniff it, it had the scent of plants and barnyard that my old giant's cousin often had.  

Saturday O.T. and I were left to our own devices from 8 a.m. until midnight!  The giant left the house in one outfit, a cheerful yellow tunic and pantsuit with many gems and returned in a light blue wrapping with beaded flowers.  I could smell many different people and foods on the five yards of fabric that she (with no small struggle) finally extricated herself from.  I heard her talking about 'a mother of a blowout' to one of the other giants today, so perhaps this was some sporting event?  A challenge to see who could most quickly swaddle themselves in yards of fabric or how much weight any one piece of fabric can hold, with weight measured in terms of rhinestones?

Today we had much better attendance.  I was brushed - I don't like being brushed -  but I do understand it should be done to better my coat.  O.T.  'helped'  fold laundry and we both hid while the vacuum cleaner was employed.  This upcoming week will be a more regular schedule I hope."

Apparently a friend of theirs sings in the group.  I mention the late great Ozzy the Cat as it is his technology that enabled me to hear the concert from the comfort of my sleeping bag.  Even with the giant's mobile turned off, I could still access its speaker.  

I greatly enjoyed the variety of music the group played, especially the piece by Copeland.  I am still not convinced about Bjork and Meredith Monk.  As for pseudo-yoik, well, I think it is growing in favor on me.  By the time this group reaches its sixtieth anniversary, perhaps I will be a tremendous fan.  Marni Nixon came out towards the end of the show and did a few of her chestnuts with the group.  I will be charitable and simply say that it was nice to hear that she could have danced all night.

Sunday there was a combination of sloth and activity.  I continued to try and introduce myself to the Objectionable Tabby, but she just hissed at me.  However, she is getting closer and closer with each attempt, so perhaps we will become acquainted.  Right around the time I fully embrace pseudo-yoik compositions."

"event","Well dear readers, Thursday was a mostly uneventful day.  I took fresh air on my sleeping bag, catnapping and casting a languid gaze out of the window of my room.  There was a clattering outside the window, but rather than St Nicholas, a group of workers appeared.  They proceeded to take away a large tree, piece by piece.  I am not sure if they were authorized to do so, or, as it is summer, if they were part of some wandering troupe of Shakespeare players needing props for the Scottish play.

The new giant came home much later than usual and had to coax me and Objectionable Tabby out from under our respective beds, as there had been extraordinary atmospheric disturbance during the evening.  I had to suffer the indignity of being brushed for a while before bed.  Although, I did let a few purrs escape when the appropriate spots were reached.

Today held new adventures.  The first part of the day was routine, but I was encouraged to explore part of the house that is usually only O.T. territory.  We met up a few times and she was most disagreeable.  I fear that I have taken up residence with a Scottish wildcat.  I always fancy myself to have a bit of wildcat blood, as I have lovely black tufts of hair atop my ears.  But it is clear that much more civilization has entered my family tree than others."

She came into the room whose bed I stay under and we were aquainted.  She said something about having to go back to bed so as to be able to get up in the morning.  I hardly saw the point of going to bed just to get back up but she would not be persuaded otherwise.  
     Objectionable Tabby seems to be a permanent fixture here.  She came to the door of my room and I leapt off the giant's lap to come greet her.  However, she was most rude and skittered away with much clattering of ill-groomed toenails.  Then, dear reader, things got curious.  I moved back to the lap of the giant and then ventured onto the desk to do some typing into this blog.  I caught a glimpse of another cat - not O.T., but one similar to me.  I looked again and there he was.  A handsome devil, but looking very cheekily at me and the new giant.  I let loose a magnificent growl, in perfect lower register pitch.  At the same time, *so did he!*  We did this a few more time and I decided that it would be prudent, as this is unfamiliar territory, to go back under the bed.  So I did.  I haven't seen him since, but I will be ready to greet this doppelganger if I see him again."

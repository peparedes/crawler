"event","wow, i have to say that i just love mattie and milla. okay so after cams house they came over, and we tanned, and OF COURSE mattie got like....2 shades darker and her tanline looks like TWO DIFFERENT PPLE, and milla got a little color, and i just DIDNT, and tomorro i'll prolly wake up like..tomato red w/ sunburnosity, cuz rite now im kinda feelin it. k so neways, after tanning and zack talking to-age, we went to matties, and like a lil after we got there, i get an ANGRY call from my dad about how i didnt clean up when really i did, and so he picks me up so i can clean, and then drives me back to her house. (cough cough, pointless!). so i get there and we leave for downtown, and mattie was wearing the GHETTOEST outfit ever. like holy lordmonkeys it was so damn hilarious. rite so then we went and found newman and tarik (who i had no idea who he was), and we were gonna go get fried snickers, but we were like ""nooooo everything we've eaten today has been fried"", so then we kept walking and we found baskin robins and were like OH MAN NEED A SUNDAE. so of course, being the fatties that we r, we got one :-D. okay so quotes of the day....


matties mom: mattie, button up ur shirt we dont want u looking like a puta
me: wuts a puta?
mattie: a slut
me: OHH SO THATS WUT ROSA HAS BEEN CALLING ME!

milla: can u see my purse moving?
mattie: ur breast moving?
milla: my purse
mattie: ur bruise?
milla: my purse
mattie: ur bursts?
milla: MY PURSE!!
me: dying of laughter


thats all for now. night night"

"event","my life is a boring boring place. are there any guys involved? no. do i have a life? nooo..not really. however..lets think of things that are on the plus side....
hmmmmm
1) when justin was in the mickey mouse club he had a very nerdy yet very sexy 80's haircut
2) hilary duff has acne...shes not perfect!!!
3) possibility of seeing dustin tonight
4) my mommy just bought avacadoes
5) only one more quarter till summer
6) newman made out w/ gerard

sorry shnog but that excited me so i hadda put it on there. anyways, this is my livejournal. we might as well call it ""the life of erica reich"", considering i will be posting LOTS of personal info about her.....its called payback!!(only erica would understand this)
anyways..know wut ive discovered is fun? hitting emily and zack while they're making out. sometimes they stop..but then again sometimes they dont, so when people walk by they see two very intimate love birds being smacked by an angry little girl. WOW im cool.  
neways...ttyl! bye bye

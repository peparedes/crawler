"event","Yesterday I spent the day at the National Contemporary Art Museum in Seoul. The grounds were beautiful and full of sculptures. Inside, the art was a very well rounded collection from the obscure to the traditional. Most of it was created by Korean artists, although they did have an international exhibition and I got to see a couple of Andy Warhols. The most intriguing piece was something that reminded me of Hieronymus Bosch for some reason. It showed hamburgers and french fries with mouths and sharp teeth consuming little people. They weren't just eating them though, these were savage 'creatures'. Tucked away behind a hill, all the free people were doing was having sex, everyone else was either being brainwashed in an underground classroom by Ronald McDonald, or being killed by the monsters.

It was raining when we first arrived but we were able to look around the grounds later that day when it stopped. One piece that really moved me was a giant robotic-style of sculpture with a jaw that moved up and down. Out from the mouth came a man's voice singing a lullaby. There were no words, just a tune, but the sound was mesmerizing and peaceful. You could hear it as you wondered the rest of the property."

"event","I've been spending a lot of spare time reading about composition, lighting, texture, balance.... the list goes on... There's so much to learn about photography but for the first time in many years, I'm actually inspired by it. I'm a sponge for this stuff. 

I remember when I took photography in grade 9 I couldn't get enough of it. My parents bought me a cute SLR that I loved and bought me a zoom lens later that year for my birthday. That started my fascination with zooming right in ;) I like to show on film something that other people might otherwise miss because they're looking at the wider view. All the photos for this class were in B&W because we were also learning how to develop our work - now <b>that's</b> fun! My favourite picture was one I took of my mum leaning against an old tree. I've still got that somewhere back home. B&W was hard for me because my eye was usually drawn to the brilliant contrasting colours and I'd have to view the scene with a different perspective

Anyway, now that I've picked it up again, I need to stop taking the easy point and click shots where the camera does most of the work. It's time, ladies and gentlemen, to switch off automatic. I need to experiment because I have a hell of a lot to learn!"

"event","Today's photography class was great. We drove out to the Ansung Namsadang Training Centre. The grounds were fantastic with a hotel, cafe, restaurant and tons of sculptures dotted in the grounds. When we first arrived we discovered the performers had taken a 'gig' elsewhere, so we headed over to see them somewhere else before coming back.

We ended up at the beginnings of a Machum (the famous Ansung brass. Btw, Machum translates as perfect so it's Ansung's perfect brass) competition. We saw the performers but I didn't take any photos because my zoom sucks. Ansung's mayor also came up to me, with his aide, to shake my hand and say hello. He also bragged to me, translated through Eunkyung, that the performers had been invited to perform in Athens. I got a kick out of the whole shaking hands and bragging bit. I actually didn't know who he was until he left and Eunkyung told me he was the mayor ;)

Since Bom Young's family are famous Machum brass makers, there were a lot of people there that he knew. So we had lunch cooked for us, which was very nice of them. We had Korean pizza and pork.

Back at the training grounds thingy... I got to be a bit of a tourist and watched a proper performance, including the old man and woman one (which I'd seen before at the dance group's performance place). Eunkyung and I also practised portrait taking on each other, something neither of us has really done before.

Translated through Eunkyung (what would I do without her??), my teacher told me that I should experiment on other types of photos since I typically tend to concentrate on zoomed in shots. I focused on that today but as they're new to me, the photos weren't really very good. I had tons of fun, so that's the important thing :)

Change of topic, the landlord had an air conditioner installed today - woo hoo!"

"event","Myungok and I had a Sunday romp in Korea's Rodeo Drive, in the Apgujeong district in Seoul. There's an official gate marking the entrance of the main shopping road and it even reads ""Rodeo Drive"". It started with a trip to The Lion hairdressers, famous for its great service for cheap prices, where I had a style and colour for just 17,000won! After lunch we shopped till we dropped, which was often. We were both so tired by the time we got back to Ansung that we needed to take a taxi home.

Overall, I was disappointed in the shopping on Rodeo Drive. The shops, while more spacious, were nothing amazing. They had all the 'branded' shops: Starbucks, Pizza hutt, Mrs Fields, Baskin Robbins, Athlete's Foot, Lacoste etc etc but then you can find any of these stores in other parts of Seoul. The main thing though, for me, was that I was expecting flash buildings and a bit of glitz'n'glammer and it just wasn't like that. Maybe my perception of what the real Rodeo Drive is like is seriously warped. Apparently though the area wakes up for the night life. A pity the last bus back to Ansung is at 10pm.

We spent a lot of time in the underground shopping centre by the express bus terminal too. We always end up there for the bargain hunting.

The tally for the day: two summer bags, two pairs of shoes (for summer again), makeup and the 4th Dark Tower book."

"event","Eunkyung invited me to join her photography class field trips every Wednesday. I used to be really into photography and learnt how to develop photos while at school. I jumped at the chance! Today was the first trip and we met the rest of the group early this morning. The teacher,Tae su, is a professional photographer here in Ansung and the students are a nice mix of people - all very friendly; Bom young is the son of a famous Ansung Machum (brass work) artist who sells his father's work, he's also a really nice guy and speaks a little English, and Hong kyun is a knowledge freak (Eunkyung's words). 

We drove out to a cactus orchard and spent over an hour walking through the glass houses (though they were vinyl not glass). It was a hot day already and much hotter in the houses but we endured it because they were amazing to photograph. Afterwards we drove out into the countryside and took some scenic shots.

I had a great time satisfying my creative juices and spent the morning concentrating on taking some contrast shots which are my favourite. I often forget how much I enjoy photography. This is a great opportunity to elevate it from once in a while to a full blown hobby. Next step would be to invest in a digital camera with a better zoom.

<a href=""http://casso.spymac.net/trips/photos.html"">My photos</a> - Some I like a lot more than others. I know there's some problems with my composition but overall I think they turned out good."

"event","Ever have one of those days that just seems to get better and better? I've had one of those good karma days - hopefully I didn't use it all up!

It started with a bit of shopping before having a nice lunch out with Sue and Eunkyung. We went to an Italian restaurant where I could indulge my craving for a salad. It was a great meal and we all had a great time chatting. The weirdest conversation was about Eunkyung's dream last night; she dreamt that she had four holes in her knees and pouring from each hole were bugs - ewww. 

During lunch Sue told me that one of my dreaded Saturday classes, the one with the horrible mother that hangs around the staff room, has been disbanded - yay! I was pretty damn happy to hear that!

After lunch, we walked back to school for my first class. I was welcomed to the school with Taeho telling me the letter from my University had arrived, I'd been accepted into the program. I knew I would be but it was nice to hear. THEN I was told that my remaining class was cancelled for the day because the student's were sick. DAY OFF!

I went home, ordered some summer clothing on the Internet and chatted to Myung Ok over MSN. She was bored so we decided to meet up at Hankyung University for a walk. We sat in the park area and talked while watching a soccer game. It was a bit muggy today so the fresh breeze under the trees was lovely. Greasy Jason spotted me and made an unwelcome appearance but soon (not soon enough) got the picture he wasn't welcome and left. Myung ok finally got to meet my stalker :P

We went for a walk and ended up in Club Alice, a board game cafe. We'd both been told to go and try it so we finally did. It was lots of fun! You pay by the hour, like a PC room, and have a ton of games to choose from. We played lots of different games, from jenga to make 5. It felt like we were laughing the whole time.

Then I took her to the Italian restaurant for dinner, since she hadn't been before. On the way we stopped at an arcade and put around 5,000 won worth of 100 won coins into different games. I liked the ones with the guns you could hold - tons of fun :) I suck at games I haven't played before so that's why I had to spend so much - buying new lives - but it was a blast.

Dinner was nice and even though we'd been talking for hours we still hadn't run out of things to say. We had a glass of red wine and shared our two dishes, one was a chicken risotto type meal (I think it was a fusion dish though as the main flavouring seemed to be curry) and the other was their spaghetti speciality. Both were only so-so in taste.

After dinner we did some bag shopping then, as is our tradition, we had a scoop of baskin robbins ice-cream. We felt like the night wasn't over yet so we went to Bear Camp, despite the name it turned out to be  a nice bar. I can't help but feel patriotic when I always order a KGB, nothing like a taste from home. We talked about everything, from racism to guys and from norrabong song choices to gossip.... nothing like the serious topics to make you feel stimulated ;)

Then finally my day was done, tired but happy."

"event","There's this dirt and gravel driveway that I use on my way to school to cut through a long block. Everybody and their dog uses this shortcut. On one side is a high retaining wall of an apartment complex; on the other is an iron fence, topped with barb wire and wound with a dead-looking climbing plant. This fence edges the back section of another apartment complex. It's not a pretty route to take and I usually find it a little depressing. 

When spring fever hit, the plant I thought was dead came to life with a burst of dark green leaves. They now cover the entire fence line and hide the barbed wire. Then buds started to appear and they gave way to lovely red roses that added more cheer to the shortcut. I stopped yesterday to smell the roses and while the scent was barely detectable, it had its own triumphant freshness.

I stood and admired one rose that had just begun to bloom and decided I would pick it to take with me to school. I turned it around in my hand and smiled at its beauty. But then I noticed it wasn't the perfect rose I thought it was, as it was infested with aphids. I dropped it by the side of the driveway and walked on, wiping my hands and wondering if some aphids remained on me. I also felt guilty about picking the rose in the first place and should have left it well alone.

Some perfect looking things should be left to admire from afar and maybe they're not as perfect as they seem."

"event","Today I discovered the ""joys"" of teaching very young children. I arrived to find one of the kids smelt like he'd poo'd his pants put wouldn't admit to anything and Myung ok didn't find anything on his clothes - strange. The smell was nauseating. Myung ok (their Korean teacher) sprayed the room for me with air freshener but all it did was make the room smell of poo and air freshener, which made it worse. So for 90 minutes, I taught the class standing by the open door and with their desks turned towards me. No way was I shutting myself in with that smell! The other boy in the class didn't seem to care too much, just told Myung ok in Korean that he thought Min Sang smelt like a bum ;)

On happier news, I had a good time out drinking lemon soju with Myung ok last night. I was just hoping into bed at 11 for an early night when she called to invite me out. She'd just had a disappointing date and wanted to talk about it. Apparently for a first date, the guy was coming on really strong so she told him she was uncomfortable and that he should go back to Seoul - my response was ""you go girl!""."

At Massey I can do a graduate's diploma which gives me a second major, without having to do a second degree. Basically, that means I just do papers in my major and not all the fluff'n'filling that normally goes with a degree. So what have I picked? I'm going to put all that people watching and time spent living in many different cultures to good use... social anthropology. It's a far cry from computer science but you only live once! The good news is that I can start it while still over here and even do my exams in Seoul - got to love distance learning! I'm all signed up to start in the second semester. I decided to do just one paper per semester - so I still have time to go out and do other things, aside from work."

"event","Tomorrow is teacher's day in Korea. In the past parent's used to give money to the teachers but it's since been banned because of the perceived bribery for the children's good grades (presumably an accusation by the parents who couldn't pay as much). Little presents are now the norm and today I got a cute ""I love you"" letter, a hairclip (because I've been wearing my hair up a lot lately), and a bunch of flowers. Some of the parents also bought gifts for all the teachers to enjoy, so yesterday and today, we've been eating watermelon, cake, cherry tomatoes and drinking bottles of juice. It's been nice! 

The sweetest was the letter because she doesn't do very well with English but she put a lot of effort into it."

It was a good movie as it didn't concentrate on this turmoil but showed it surrounding the life of a simple man (very simple in a lot of respects!), who was in the uncomfortable position of being the president's barber. There were a lot of funny moments in the movie, which were often back to back with gruesome scenes that stole the laughter away. Myung ok booked us in the one and only showing of the movie with English subtitles - without which I'd have had a tough time understanding it. I really enjoyed the movie, well worth going to see!

We spent the whole day in Seoul and arrived back in Ansung at 10pm. Before and after the movie, we spent a lot of time walking around different suburbs surrounding Jongno. It was raining all day which spoilt it a bit; but outside each major store was a special bag machine that you could use to cover your wet umbrella. 

We enjoyed a nice Japanese lunch in a quiet and cozy restaurante before the movie. I picked a shrimp fried rice, yummy! For dinner, we went to another district back on the other side of Han river, to a place called Captain Hook, an American restaurante. The  atmosphere was great, with loud music and bubbling conversations. Over this, we enjoyed Mexican food and a drink. It was the perfect way to end the night."

"event","While at work today, I was talking about weekend plans with Eunkyung. I said I wanted to relax and read but having read the Ramses book in just over a day (very good by the way) and now already half way through Stephen King's first Dark Tower book, I needed to go to Seoul to buy more books. She said she didn't have any plans but really wanted to do something, anything, even if it was just going to Seoul. 'Just' going to Seoul, one of the largest cities in the world with 10 million people... it fascinated me when I came to the realisation that it's how I see Seoul too. I'm now so used to going there that I don't see it as anything special, like I once did. I mean, I enjoy my trips there and go often but it's not the big deal it once was. It's just like going down town to do some shopping."

"event","I had a lovely day today. I didn't start work until 5pm so at 9am I went to Seoul with Sue. We jumped on the subway and headed to Gangnam. I forget the name of the shop now but we visited an all-English bookshop to pick textbooks. 

Last week, Sue went to a principals meeting for the school's franchise and learnt that the Seoul based students were much better at speaking naturally than our rural kids. So we're going to add natural speaking lessons to each class. I told her that since I don't have formal training in ESL teaching, I'd need a textbook to help guide me in what to teach them. We found a great book that covers all the basics like 'whaddaya'.

It was a great shop and we ended up browsing all the books for some time. They have a seating area with a drink vending machine, so I grabbed some good grammar books and browsed through them over an iced coffee. I was stealing their ideas for my classes...

Next we went downstairs to Marche's and had a great chat over a salad. I love that restaurant chain. It's a bit pricey, costing around 16,000 won for a chicken salad and cappuccino, but it's a lot of fun wandering around the cooking areas to pick out the goodies to consume. I'm embarrassed to say we did a lot of gossiping about one of our friends, Moon, who recently maybe/maybe not broke up with his girlfriend.

Sue had a 3pm class so after lunch she headed back while I stayed and had a wander around Gangnam. I'd never been to that area of Seoul before so I wanted to take the opportunity to explore - or as Sue puts it ""Katie's off on another adventure"". I didn't really see anything interesting so I sat down on a bench for some relaxing people watching - lots of suits that slowly dwindled and gave way to younger, University type young people. When I got home later, I looked up Gangnam on my 'Korea Rainbow' tourist booklet and discovered I needed to just walk one block up and I would have found a lot of shops - oh well, next time.

I tried to do some bag shopping back at the Youngpoon plaza by the express bus terminal, but my heart wasn't in it. Is it possible that I now have enough bags?? Maybe I need a new fetish, like shoes. I browsed the non-fiction section of the bookstore and ended up buying Ramses - the son of light volume 1 by Christian Jacq. I started reading it over an OJ in the in-store cafe, and didn't want to put it down.

Headed back to Ansung for my one class of the day, which went great despite being really tired. 

Next week, I start two new classes of 7 year olds - a bit daunting! I'm hoping they are good kids because it's hard work keeping their attention and getting them to learn as much as their parents expect."

"event","Yesterday was great! Taeho and Sueyoung took the two of us on a day long trip, which left the two of us tired but happy. 

We met them at the school at 9am then set off for the <a href=""http://www.koreanfolk.co.kr/folk/english/index.htm"">Korean Folk Village</a>, which is up near Suwon. It's a completely reconstructed ancient village with over 250 buildings (ranging from farm houses to nobel's houses and government buildings) and over 50,000 recreated artefacts.

<b>Korean Folk Village</b>
When we first arrived, the manager of the folk village came out and asked Mark if he'd spend 5-10 minutes checking an English draft of some tourist information. Mark quickly agreed so I spent 15 minutes reviewing the work! Ah well... Once inside, we kicked off the tour by writing a wish on a piece of paper and tying it to the village's rock pile - the rocks are to ward off evil spirits from the village. The rocks were criss-crossed with a straw-like rope made from rice grass. The next day a ceremony is held in which the dream papers and rope are burnt and your wish will come true. I wished that Mark would come to live in Korea with me so Taeho and Sue said that was their wish too - three of us behind that wish must up the odds! The grounds were lovely and with over 200 acres there was a lot to explore. The highlight for me was watching the special farmer's dance and music performance. A troupe of colourfully dressed musicians, holding different instruments from gongs to drums, walked, danced and ran around the performance area. There were 5 that wore special hats with a trailing ribbon; they moved their heads in special ways to make the ribbons twirl in circles. It was a spectacular show! We also saw an elderly man do a rope walking show. He's a cultural asset in Korea and did a brilliant performance - though I did get bored half way through. Next we saw a traditional wedding ceremony then headed into a restaurant for bulgolgi (directly translated it means fire meat) which is extremely tender meat cooked at the table - my favourite!

<b>Everland</b>
After the folk village we were off to <a href=""http://www.everland.com"">Everland</a>! It was a beautiful day so the park was <b>full</b> of people. We started with a drink by the tulip gardens then Mark and I took off to go on the rides. The first one we had to wait over an hour to get on (making me a little grumpy) but log flume was a fun ride. We both sat at the front of our log so we had a huge splash of water! We weren't in the mood to wait in line for another ride so we grabbed an ice-cream and walked down to see the animals. They had a white tiger, different monkeys, seals, penguins, polar bears, puppies, etc etc etc There is a vending machine by the polar bears where you could buy snacks for them. I got to feed the polar bear! He stood on two legs and I kept tossing the food to him, which he'd catch in his mouth - too cute. We met up with Sue and Taeho again and we went for Chinese dinner. The park was less crowded after 7pm, so when we split up again, Mark and I went in search of some more rides. We went on a suspended roller coaster which was a ton of fun. Then we had a romantic gondola ride before meeting up with T&S and heading home. 

We got in after 10pm and were sunburnt, tired and happy.

"event","My 'giggle class' (Miyun, Heeyeo and Sumin) gave Mark and I a tour of Ansung today. It started with the Ansung Machum Museum which mainly details the history of Ansung's famous brass ware. It was a nice little museum with lots of English to help the two of us understand it all. It had lots of models which were really well done. Mark and Katie say 'two thumbs up' ;)

Next we drove to the Taepyung-Mu Initiation Hall where we enjoyed a traditional dance show by the Kang Sun-young Dance Company. Each dance lasted from 5-15 minutes and had a different costume. The Korean style seemed to involve lots of twirling and purposeful yet graceful movements. We both thoroughly enjoyed each performance and we were treated to seeing:
<ul>
<li> the peace dance - playful and sensual with small dainty movements </li>
<li> the drum dance - perfectly harmonised and amazing to watch </li>
<li> the hyangbal dance - with castanets creating the rhythm of the dance </li>
<li> the exorcist dance - which shows a shaman communicating with the spirits </li>
<li> the granny miyal dance - which is a mask dance depicting an elderly couple </li>
<li> the male and maiden dance - ahhhh young love </li>
<li> the fan dance - flowers and waves created by the dancers with the fans </li>
</ul>

Afterwards we drove out to a suburb of Ansung where Heeyeo works and had a yummy barbecue beef meal with sansachun.

"event","We wanted to go visit Namsan Park in Seoul so yesterday Mark woke me up far too early; the morning period is still a fuzzy blur for me!

We headed to Seoul on the express bus and I managed to catch up on my sleep for the hour the trip takes. Once in Seoul, we hopped into the subway and headed to Hoehyeon station. The guide book said we'd have a 10 minute walk to the park but it wasn't sign posted and we ended up walking for an hour through the different side streets. We did find the Namdaemun market (which was a good indicator we were walking in the wrong direction) and had a brief look around.

At long last we found the park! They had a mini zoo with chickens, goats, deer, rabbits, spider monkeys etc. There were lots of class trips visiting the zoo and it was cute to see the children enjoying the chickens and rabbits - something we consider very common. Namsan is a small mountain and on the top is the Seoul tower. You can walk up to the top but we decided to do the cable ride instead so we walked through the park to find it. The trees were lovely with the different coloured leaves and blossoms. It really was a beautiful park. 

The cable car climbs the side of the mountain and gives us a stunning view for the three minutes the ride takes. Beyond the park trees we could see the cityscape, which was a little smoggy unfortunately. At the top we found a restaurant, The Black Orange, that had tables looking out on the spectacular view. 

The top of the tower was a little disappointing because of the smog. But it was really well set out with photo guides spaced out around the circular viewing tower. It was fun picking out the places we had already visited and finding them amongst the skyscrapers and other building. I ride the subway a lot so because of that convenience I forget how big Seoul really is - the tower's view quickly reminded me!

We headed back down the cable car and returned to the main park area. The 50-odd groups of school children had gone now so we had a good look around and visited the botanical greenhouses. They had some amazing collections of palms, cacti and citrus trees. Some of the cacti were huge!

We were going to walk around to the outdoor botanical area but discovered it was 2 kilometres down the road and we were getting pretty worn out at this stage. So we headed back into town to look around Namdaemun market. It's this huge section of stalls and shops spread out over several blocks and criss-crossed with roads. You could buy anything you wanted there! It was more of a touristy place though and the prices weren't as cheap as you'd assume. It was pretty crowded and I saw a lot of foreigners around, something of a novelty for me.

"event","The intention was there but the local establishments weren't coming to the party - hopelessly closing early on us! We all ended up going home before 4am, oh the shame...

It all started at Rush, an apt name considering the mad dash to consume alcohol and eat side dishes. All the teachers came along and it was a really fun night full of the usual soju, spicy side dishes and the smokers grouped at the end of the table being teased by the non-smokers. 

We lost some of the teachers to their beds when we moved from Rush to Tudali but we soldiered on with the party. From Tudali we were going to go have some raw seafood but the restaurant was closed, and the backup norrebong too. So we all went home. Mark and I decided to walk the 1/2 hour home which was nice for me to clear my head but Mark was really cold.

"event","This is just a quick update as I want to hurry back into Mark's waiting arms - who can blame me??

We're having a lovely time. The first couple of days were spent in Seoul where I got to show Mark the subway system and one of the palaces. We've also been to the massive Coex mall, which has the aquarium, several department stores and a ton of shops.

Back in Ansung again. We've taken Misu for a walk up Mt Bibong where all three of us got far too hot and I even got sun burnt. In hindsight maybe not a great idea for the middle of the day.... We've been back to Seoul again and this time spent a few hours browsing the underground shopping centre. 

Tonight the other teachers are throwing Mark a midnight to sunrise welcoming party. Hopefully we'll survive that in one piece, especially since I'd like to go visit the botanical gardens and zoo in Seoul tomorrow.

Since Mark brought my digital camera over with him there are a few pictures to view!

I think I've talked about my 'giggle' class before. It's my adult conversation class and it was given the nickname by other teachers because they could hear our laughing and giggling echo around the school. It has always been a female-filled class but tonight we had two guys join us.

One of the new guys owns a cafe in town, so after class some of us went to his cafe ""Mono"" for a drink. We chatted and had a good time, then headed to a restaurant for a barbecue dinner and some soju  - lots of fun.

He's an interesting guy. He's my age and has a scuba diving licence, snowboards and sometimes swims competitively. He wants his English to get better because he hopes to move to Australia for a few years and get a job as a scuba instructor. He also has a really flash car and gave us all a ride home afterwards!

"event","Myung-ok and I headed to the Dong Yaung oriental fortuneteller today. It was a tiny shop and we sat on the floor in front of his low desk. The outer walls were rimmed with packed bookcases and there were lots of important looking framed certificates on the wall space. He was in his 50's or 60's, it was hard to tell, and reclined on a beach style chair.

He worked from my birth date to tell my fortune, I'm a tiger born on the tiger hour and I have monkey legs! Basically my life boils down to the need to move around a lot - so true! So here's my fortune:
<blockquote>* There's lots of world travel in my life, from birth until death, and a need to keep moving.
* My ideal profession would be in childcare, other child related work or as a tourist guide.
* For the next 9 years there will be lots of changes then after that I will have a safe and secure life.
* My fortune is that I can have many children but the ideal number for me is 2, a boy and a girl.
* I can do what I want until I'm 70, with a 50-80% chance of success.
* In July/August I will have a big change or movement in my life but not purposefully directed by me.
* If I want to live overseas then Asian countries are my ideal match, with more wealth coming from Korea, China or Japan.
* After I'm 40, I need to be careful of my weakest health points: throat, lungs and heart.
* In my marriage, he said I will need to live apart from Mark a few more times in my life (not separated or divorced but living apart) because we don't understand each other yet and we'll argue too much. Otherwise he sees us living out our lives together.
* I have two base personality traits: being calm; being cheerful and active in order to form relationships with people.</blockquote>

Whether I believed the way he could read my fortune or not doesn't matter, I got a lot out of the visit and I will go back again.

Afterwards, we had a Cajun lunch then we hopped on the number 50 bus and headed to Ansung's nearest big smoke, Pyeong Taek.

There we saw the recent Korean movie release called Fly with Korean Flag (Taekuki Hwaenalimyo). It was about two brothers caught up fighting in the first year of the Korean War. It was a gritty movie with lots of realistic violence. It was also honest in that it showed atrocities from both sides; North Korean's executing entire villages of civilians and South Korean's executing surrendered POWs. Without Myung-ok's whispered translations during the movie I would have been extremely lost. At the end of the movie almost the entire audience was weeping, me included...

<lj-cut text=""More about the movie"">
From an article in Korea.net:
""An excavation team digs out the remains of what it believes to be Sgt. Lee Jin-seok, who is still alive as a 77-year-old grandfather. He wonders whether the remains are that of his older brother Lee Jin-tae.

The scene changes to Jong-no in Seoul on June 24, 1950 when Jin-tae (Jang Dong-gun) is a shoemaker, Jin-seok (Won Bin) is a student, and their mother makes noodles to support the family. When the Korean War breaks out, the family quickly flees, but Jin-tae and Jin-seok are forcibly conscripted into the army and sent to the front.

The ensuing battle scenes are bigger and better than anything ever before seen in Korean cinema. To a backdrop of ear-splitting explosions and thick artillery smoke, flesh goes flying and blood is splattered so vividly and graphically that the film almost takes us there. The sight of an American bomber crashing or the panorama of the Chinese army charging over a mountain is remarkable by any standards.""

Of course, no one told me about this until 9pm and I was heading home for the night. I think I've taken on half the school's heat for the summer! I did do a bit of mustering and walked into my adult's class (which Taeho teaches grammar to on a Thursday) and got them all to buy my heat ;) I don't think I broke even though..."

At dawn tomorrow, bite a shelled peanut and throw it outside my front door to ensure healthy teeth</blockquote>
I shared bags of peanuts with the other teachers in the staff room, which I enjoyed because it was a very sociable time. No rice though, wonder if Cajun chicken salad is a worthy substitute? ;)

I couldn't see the moon because it's overcast and snowing (!) tonight. I did, however, make my friend Moon Kyung-heun stand still so I could make a wish on him! Not telling what the wish is...

I have no intention of staying up all night so I have an eye pencil on standby for the morning ;)

Finally, I was sent home with a bag of peanuts for the morning. It's not going to be dawn but hopefully a few hours late will still work wonders on my teeth ;)"

"event","The calendar has clicked over and we're now in the year of the monkey. I hope this year will be a great one for you all!

<b>My Sol nal adventures:</b>

Just before lunch, I was heading to Seoul on the express bus when Eunkyung called to see if I wanted to do anything. I invited her to Seoul to see do some sightseeing with me, she accepted so I spent some time at the Youngpoong bookstore while I waited for her to arrive from Ansung.

I had a good browse of the English section and ended up buying:
<blockquote>Jonathan Livingston Seagull because I have never read it and I think it's about time
Bridget Jones's Diary by Helen Fielding because the movie was wonderful
Notes to Myself by Hugh Prather because it looked good
I Touch the Earth, the Earth Touches Me by Hugh Prather as well
Gitanjali by Rabindranath Tagore. This is a collection of Indian poems and it looked great</blockquote>

Eunkyung's bus was really late so by the time we caught the subway to Gyeongbokgung Palace it was closed and the New Year festival was over. I was really disappointed! But the National Folk Museum is right next door, so we went through that.

The museum houses over 130,000 pieces of art and archeological objects, with lots of displays on 3 floors. We got to see a number of Korean national treasures, including the 'horse rider' sculpture that appears in lots of history books - according to Eunkyung. There's only so much pottery or stone fragments that I can look at, so I went through a lot of exhibits quickly. I did spend a bit of time looking at the Buddhist sculptures, no surprise for those of you who know I've accumulated a small collection of Buddhas over the years. At the end of the tour, I bought a t-shirt with a Korean flying angel design on it - I couldn't resist!

Next, we headed to the big Coex mall, which is Asia's largest underground shopping area. We stopped for dinner first and chose Marche. It was an exciting experience because it's decked out like an alpine restaurant. The waiters and waitresses were wearing what I assume to be Swedish costumes and each one greeted you as you walked through to be seated. 

We were given a meal card then left to it. There were about 5 food court style islands in the middle of the restaurant, each offering something different from salads and a huge selection of mains, to deserts and drinks. Inside each island were the actual chefs, ready to prepare your food. You order, hand them your card for a stamp, then they cook or prepare your food. It was so much fun browsing the islands but it was a hard choice to make as the selection of different countries cuisines was brilliant - Japanese, Mexican, Italian, Hungarian, to name just a few! I started with a small salad as I still have salad cravings! Then for my main I had ""shrimp pilaf and hongking roll"" (not sure if it's a spelling mistake!) with plum sauce. The food was delicious. When we were finished we took our cards to the cashier to pay.

To work of our dinner we just had to do some shopping, had to... We only saw a small portion of the coex - didn't even have time to see the aquarium - but I came out with:
<blockquote>A many threaded leather bracelet with tiny silver beads
A new hoodie to combat the cold snap
2 teddy bears to share my bed
A pair of black going-out boots, since I'm sick of only wearing my brown clunkers because they were the only shoes I had capable of trekking through the snow and ice</blockquote>

We'd played it smart and bought return tickets to Ansung before leaving the bus station earlier that day. So the time quickly came for us to head back and return home.

It was a great day and I've earned a sleep-in. Now what am I going to get up to tomorrow...?"

"event","Early this morning I had to go to the dentist to have a broken tooth seen to. It was a nice office with a large wide screen TV in the reception area and a collection of English DVD's. I was so comfortable relaxing on the sofa that I was disappointed when my name was called!

The dental assistants were all dressed in matching uniforms, with navy skirt, matching vest and white shirt. A bit of a change from the uniform worn in NZ - shapeless white top and pants that remind me of doctor's scrubs.

From the dental chair I had a view of some lovely potted pants done in Korean style. They use black pieces of wood, which I think have been turned into charcoal and small plants grow on moss in the nooks. The black wood is supposed to take poisons out of the air.

Anyway, the dentist spoke English really well! That relieved me no end! 

I had an x-ray taken of my tooth and while the dental assistant was quick to leave the room while it was taken, I was given now protection. The x-ray showed I'd damaged my tooth too much and it had to come out...

During the extraction I had a face cloth over my head, with just a hole for my mouth. That helped a lot because even though I felt no pain the rest of my senses were very tuned into what was happening! 15 minutes and 4 stitches later, it was over.

I'm going to have to get a bridge done to fill the gap. You can't see the gap as it's one of the back teeth but I'd still feel better with it filled. The extraction of the tooth was surprisingly only 20,000 won, though I have to look 'forward' to paying about 1million won for the bridge...

Oh, and bless the dentist for giving me strong painkillers - they rock... though they make me very sleepy."

"event","Sol nal is coming up on the Korean calendar, the 22nd January, giving me five days off in a row! A pity the roads are two clogged to actually travel...

~ for the knowledge buffs ~
Sol means come or stand, and nal means day. Somehow this roughly translates to mean it's the Korean New Year. In the morning on Sol nal, the Korean children bow to older people (uncles, granddads etc), who in turn give the children money (if they're lucky) or best wishes for their future. 

Korean people also give chae sah, which is thanks to their dead relatives. They believe that all their good fortune and good health is due to their dead relatives looking over them. So the living make sure to thank their ancestors for keeping them healthy and giving them a good life. I wonder what some of the living would say to their ancestors if they've had a bad year?

Sik hye is traditionally drunk on Sol nal, this is a rice based drink that's not bad but a little on the strange side. The main tradition, food wise, is dok guk, or rice cake soup. It's believed that when you eat this on Sol nal you'll get a year older. In fact, in Korea everyone is believed to age on this one day. I told Sue Young I was quite prepared not to eat dok guk and stay 29 for a while longer but it's against the rules so I must comply. A pity as I thought I'd found an aging loop hole..."

"event","I finally have my Christmas snow! Yes, it's a bit late but beautiful nonetheless. I spent my time between classes yesterday watching the snow fall or trying to catch the snowflakes on my tongue. I was mesmerized...

~ later that week ~
The snow on the roads has now changed to ice, making it pretty dangerous to drive or walk. I haven't seen any cars with snow chains on their tyres. I'm not sure why they don't use them, as I see many cars sliding all over the road. As for me, I find it amusing that the safest place for me to walk is in the gutters that are now turned pure, clean and beautiful by the snow.

I think that's actually why I like the snow so much, it turns even the dirtiest place into a crisply-white area - renewed and cleaned."

It was a bloody good night, with lots of joking around, singing (of course), dancing and tambourines going into overdrive on some songs. Everyone had a great time!

"event","I reached the three month mark today, which is hard to believe! 1/4 down and 3/4 to go before I'll be heading home again. It's one of those moments that I can't help but reflect.

I've built a nice life here, I have good friends and for the most part I'm happy. My apartment is looking more 'homie' and 'warmer' since I bought some plants and a new bedspread, and rearranged the furniture. Plus it's lovely having Mi-Su to come home to.

I'm cooking at home more often now, instead of buying every meal, and I don't always cheat by buying 'heat and eat' foods. I went for a walk down a different street one day and came across a supermarket in my neighbourhood. So, I can now buy heavier groceries, knowing that I don't have to lug them for half and hour back to my place.

I like my student neighbourhood too. The restaurants and bars are always open later than in town so it's where us teachers head to for after work parties. I also have the university campus to use for taking Mi-Su for a walk, where someone usually stops to say hello while they give Mi-Su a cuddle.

My Korean is still at a stand still and I have every intention of picking up my studies.... My friends are starting to tell me that I should know more by now, so that friendly slap on the hand is good incentive for me.

So what's missing? Mark."

"event","Mi-Su, aka my lil angel, went to the 'beauticians' today for the first time. In true angel style, as we set off for the pet shop it started to snow, with tiny snowflakes drifting down around us. 

When I picked her up I couldn't believe this was the same dog, she was gorgeous! They had: shaved her feet and around her face so that the hair wasn't in her eyes; put in a little top knot with a tiny pink hair clip; shampooed and brushed her so that her fur was all clean and fluffy; and she smelt perfumed and delicious!

My lil angel and I set off for home with a free bag of treats for Mi-Su to enjoy. She got a lot of attention* from passing pedestrians, which she always laps up. But not five minutes after we left the shop, in true Mi-Su fashion, she seemed quick to want to point out to me that she's no angel. First she pee'd on the side walk right next to a lady who was wanting to say hello to her! Then she poo'd in front of the Hyundai dealers, while the salesmen were outside having a smoke break! In my heart I know she's a little fluffy demon so I always carry paper towels for such emergencies ;)

*Koreas favourite tv show is a period drama based on a true story in Koreas past. It's about the first female cook to a king and how she then became the first female physician. A week or two ago the king gave a diplomat a shi tzu as a present. Now Mi-Su's popularity has increased and I hear lots of people saying ""oooo shi tzu!""."

"event","It suddenly occurred to me that I've been slack and haven't written about the rest of my Christmas day. Well....

I packed up our picnic, put on my walking gear and we set off for Bi bong Mountain. By the time we had left, the clouds had disappeared and we were left with a warm winter's day with a clear blue sky - no snow in sight. To get to the mountain you need to walk through a maze of narrow residential streets. I had to stop and ask directions from an old Korean woman. She was so kind that she walked with us to the foot of the mountain. 

The path starts by the first school in Ansung, which is now unused but well maintained with the colourful decorations on the building remaining bright.  At first the path is cobbled as it winds up the mountain but then it gets very steep and the cobbles are replaced by dirt and cut-in steps with wood to reinforce them. Part way up this section is a gardened area with bench seating. We took a small rest here and looked down onto the monk's big vegetable garden. 

We set off again and made it to the half way point, this is where all the different tracks start from. I spent some time looking at the Buddhist temple by the crossroads. They have a giant statue of Buddha in their front garden and a pagoda type structure that houses a big, elaborately carved bell. I stopped and talked to one of the worshippers and he gave me permission to take some photos. He even took one of me standing in front of the statue. I'm lucky to come across so many nice people.

Up one of the tracks is the female's exercise area. There is a stone frog that has the underground water flowing from its mouth. Funnily enough, the provided drinking ladles are plastic with a cartoon tiger on the side. Anyway, we stopped here for a drink then walked into the woods a slight way to the picnic area. There are big stone slabs raised slightly off the ground and lower blocks of stone to sit on. Mi-Su was treated to a can of dog food and I had a small bottle of strawberry bubbly and a pastry from the bakery. Mi-Su had a great time playing while I sat and enjoyed the view of the trees. We both had a lovely time.

On the way back down the mountain, Eunkyung called to invite me to Pyeong Taek to meet up with her friend Song Il for a Christmas dinner. Pyeong Taek was crazily busy and many restaurants had a long wait before you could be seated for dinner. We decided on a Canadian bistro, ""TJ Puffin's Canadian Bistro"" and were lucky enough to only wait 15 minutes. The dinner was nice and I enjoyed my beef and chicken fajitas with a glass of red wine. I'm not sure what they were doing in a Canadian bistro. Then again I wasn't really sure what Canadian food would be but was expecting something with a French flavour.

After dinner, we went to a ""western bar"" for a beer. The lights were dimmed and instead of traditional barstools, they had high-backed padded chairs with long legs. It was nice and relaxing.

 For a change I was home before 11pm and had an early night."

"event","I've had a few mini Christmas parties this week to help put me in the Christmas spirit:
<ul>
<li> Bulgolgi, lemon soju and 2 hours at the norrabong with my adult students </li>
<li> Christmas cake and Christmas carols with one of my classes as their end of book party </li>
<li> Red wine and a table full of breads from the bakery, with Sue Young and Eunkyung on Christmas eve at ILS after work </li>
</ul> 

I was invited to spend today with Myung Ok in Seoul but I thought I'd spend it with Mi-Su instead. We're going to climb the mountain this afternoon and have a picnic lunch.

Still no snow! But things are looking promising because after a week of blue skies it is finally overcast - fingers crossed!

Anyway, I wish you all a very Merry Christmas!"

"event","I joined the video shop yesterday - finally! The tape covers are in Korean but all the western movies are kept in English with Korean subtitles. I was on my way to school so I didn't have time to browse for long but from what I saw there was a good range of newish to old movies. I grabbed the first Charlie's Angels film and headed to the counter. The lady was trying at length to explain something to me in Korean but I didn't understand... a quick call to Taeho to interpret for me - Because I'm an 'alien' I need to keep a 20,000 won deposit at the video shop while I'm a member there..... Ahhhh.

There are a lot of food street vendors in Korea and some of the stalls have stools where you can sit while enjoying a meal. A few examples of what you can buy: noodle soup, a type of Korean bread in a hot sauce, something that looks like a sausage on a stick, fruit on a stick (strawberries, slices of melon etc), and all shapes of soft dough-like snacks filled with a red bean mix. The smells as you walk past are mouth watering. I bought a bag full of red bean filled snacks to share with the teachers, so yummy.

My favourite type of meal out with friends is the barbecue. Set into the centre of the table is a gas or hot coal heated barbecue on which you cook your own marinated meat slices. Depending on what you order the meat can be different types of beef, pork, seafood or a mix. Slices of garlic go onto the plate as well. Then, lettuce leaf, meat, sauce, garlic, greenery ( a seaweed mix or spring onions usually), fold the lettuce up and pop it all in your mouth - YUM! It's a great sociable night out and most of the places also serve soju, sansachun etc

I recently met a Canadian woman I like through live journal. She teaches in Ulsan, which is at the bottom of the east cost, down by Busan. I have a week off from January 21, for the Korean New Year, so I'm going to head over to stay with her. It should be lots of fun :)"

"event","I was supposed to have a washing machine with my apartment (as part of the contract) but the apartment they found didn't even have a shared one. I had no way to do my laundry (I could have hand washed my clothes in the bathroom but I had no way of drying them) so Sue Young told me she would do it for me. So for the first two months, much to my slight embarrassment, Sue Young did my laundry twice a week. She would even playfully scold me if I forgot to bring it to school. I kept asking her where a laundromat was but she told me it was too far away.

The laundry saga took on a new direction when Taeho's mother became very sick and was hospitalised. She needed family around her to look after her while in the hospital but since her daughter was heavily pregnant, the job fell to Sue Young as part of her family duties (you don't just marry the man you marry the family). When she wasn't at work she had to go to the hospital and even sleep there most of the time. She still kept diligently doing my laundry even though she looked so incredibly tired. 

One day about a week later, much to my surprise, Sue Young finally said she'd take me for a walk and show me where the laundromat was. It's about a 15 minute walk from the school, right through down town and out the other side. It's not self service, which surprised me a little but the lady is really nice and we seem to communicate in hand movements without too many misunderstandings!

So now, for 5,000 to 7,000 won a time, I take a half hour walk to the laundromat where I get my clothes washed, dried and ironed. Bliss."

"event","Myung Ok and I went to Pyeong Taek at 11am by bus then hit pizza hutt for some lunch. They have this yummy variety that has a ring of mashed sweet potato around the outside. It definitely gave us the shopping fuel we needed as we then took the down town area by storm. I was surprised there weren't many people around considering it was the weekend before Christmas. The gift shops were full of people but then they almost always are; they sell lots of cutsie items from hair clips and stationary to soft toys and cell phone accessories.

It was shaping up to be a sweet potato day because over a coffee break we also tried a sweet potato cake. My verdict? Very tasty, not too strong and had a very slight savoury taste that kept the cake from being too sweet.

We're both used to the cheap prices we can get in Seoul so there wasn't much that we were interested in buying but we did do a lot of browsing. I did find a pair of olive coloured boots that I liked and they were on sale for 10,000 won so I had to get them, just had to!

After shopping we went and saw the third Lord Of The Rings movie, the Return of the King. The theatre was sold out for all the days showings but Myung Ok had bought us tickets earlier in the week - phew! Hmmm, to be honest I didn't enjoy it overall. Despite the terrific acting, scenery and story line, the movie was boring and slow. It also had a ending that just never seemed to want to end. Most of the audience seemed to feel the same way as there was a lot of sighing and fidgeting when they faded into yet another closure. On the bright side, it was wonderful to see New Zealand again :)

After the movie we went to a traditional Korean restaurant, complete with rice paper privacy screens, and had seafood Korean pizza (like a large omelet) and dongdongju. The dongdongju was another traditional Korean alcohol that I hadn't tried. It was sweet and tasted like honey, it's now my favourite as it's much nicer than sansachun.

I had made a bet with Myung Ok earlier in the week that half the audience would be American military. If we lost we had to buy the other person an ice-cream. So....seeing as how there were only 2 US military guys there, after dinner we went to Baskin Robins so I could buy us ice-cream for desert. (Note to Mum: I had pralines and cream - do you remember that from Saudi?)

We also stopped and watched a Salvation Army brass band play Christmas carols. All the members of the band looked like they were still in school, which surprised me because other brass bands I've seen all had older people. Anyway, with rosy faces from the cold they stepped up onto a makeshift stage and they did a good job so I emptied my coin purse into their bucket. A good dead just in time for Christmas, now hopefully I won't get a lump of coal from Santa ;)"

"event","Korean men spit in the streets. Based on just what I've seen I think it's a Korean-wide phenomenon. Not always discretely either but a big spit sometimes only a few feet from you. I haven't seen this happen too much in Seoul though, so I'm thinking either:
<blockquote>a) There's just not enough space in Seoul to spit without hitting someone!
b) Polite, citified folk don't spit</blockquote>

Maybe it happens more when the wind blows from the north... If that's true then I wonder if every time they spit they curse the Chinese for destroying the forest, which now allows the black dust to blow down into Korean and cover everything. I know I curse the Chinese when I have to clean my apartment more often. 

Eunkyung told me once that the Chinese government had asked Korea to pay for the re-forestation if they were that upset about the dust. Talk about cheeky...

On another note, my new claim to fame is scoring a perfect 100 at the norrebong for singing Don't Cry For Me Argentina. All well and good but my version of Radiohead's Creep got more people up and dancing!"

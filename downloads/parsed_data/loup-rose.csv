"event","I'm going to write up something on PoA - which I just saw a few days ago!- Why? Please see subject header for further explanation on that. Hopefully it'll help put me back into a good mood after getting my teeth cleaned. I hate going to the dentist...I have to get my wisdom teeth pulled next month. -Apparently in their sick little minds it's something fun for me to look forward to.

Anywho, on to the movie!

Personally, I loved the movie! (and BAH to those who complained wwwaaayyy too much about it.) Yes, of course there were a few instances I could be nit picky about, but I really did enjoy it. 

Besides, if you want that, the bestest best 'review' and such on it -in my opinion at least- is Ruthie's! Check it out, she's on my friends list...Ruthieb.

My favoritest scene, though mainly because I had eaten alot of sugar right before the movie and therefore had no control over my laughter, was when Harry first opened his 'Monster Book of Monsters' and the little thing ran under his bed waiting for him...*giggles* (ha! bet you all thought it was going to be a Remus Lupin scene didn't you? *smirk*) 

I actually liked how David Thewlis did Remus Lupin...though an explanation in the movie of who Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs was would have been nice...then I wouldn't have had to explain to my cousin how come Harry's last Patronus was a stag. The werewolf was a bit...strange looking to me. It looked more sad and in need of a hug, than scary or bloodthirsty.  I never thought it'd be so skinny!! Poor thing needs to eat! *hands it Ruthie's Sirius to munch on*  

Speaking of Remus, I really need to post in Mischief...the club looks like it's on its last leg! I'm so behind on everything it seems! *cringes as Jessica will probably kill her for not having this next thing done sooner* And since my computer came back...I can -finally- type up chapter three of 'From Summit to Abyss' and hopefully get my new story up 'Amnesia'.  

If, per chance, there are any slash fans out there reading this (whom, I'm assuming, probably went batty over the Remus/Sirius hug in the shack and Snape's quite humorous line ""Bickering like an old married couple"") feel free to check out my story 'The Magician's Curse' as I am finally working on chapter six of that one, too.

Hmm....back to the movie...some people complained about them wearing muggle clothing too much in the movie. To tell the truth, it actually didn't bother me a whole lot (might be b/c I paid a wee bit more attention to a certain professor - I loved how he played music while they took turns against the boggart *huggles moony*)

Wow, this is turning out a bit longer than I had thought it would.  Has anyone actually made it down this far without skimming? *grin*

Buckbeak was adorable...like a really big puppy! And Sirius looked kinda nifty in dog form! And I liked how when he was talking to Harry about it he said something about how his personality was quite friendly as a dog and that James had said they should make the look permanent. *giggles*

Alrighties, I really think I should wrap this baby up.  Um...bye? How do I end this stupid thing?  OOh! I know!! I'll end it with a question.

Did anyone take a really good look at the map during the movie when Harry was wandering the hall's looking for Peter Pettigrew? Care to explain the 'Room of Doom' labeled on it?  Is that such a good thing for that particular school to have?  -Jennie, please tell me that would NOT make a good story...i fear the seeds of creativity taking root with that idea...help me!"

"event","21! Hell yeah, baby! *dances around throwing confetti* 

Well, I'm able to check my mail and post again! My computer at home has taken to its sick bed (personally, I think my mother broke it...) I'm using the computer at my ""employers"" house - I babysit for them. 

The little ones (well, they aren't really all that little, being 7 and 8 years old...oh, excuse me, I'm being corrected. He doesn't want me to say 8 - he's *almost* nine)...anyway, they're watching Yugi-oh and playing with little beyblade toys - and apparently reading over shoulders. 

I'm taking them to see Shrek 2 today, so hopefully that'll be a cute movie.  

You know, as I read through this, I'm wondering if this matters at all to anyone. Seriously, who cares what I'm doing or plan to do for the day? 

I think I shall leave it at that then, though I'm not really leaving you all that much, am I?

Anyway, you've gotten the most important piece of information out of this anyway. What is that, you ask? Well, that would be that it is my BIRTHDAY!! 

*casts cheering charm on all her readers* 

YAY!!  Now you have to be happy, too!!"

"event","HA! If only...I, for one, certainly wouldn't be inside on the computer if that were true.  

As for the real weather...hot.  Humid hot.  Yuck. The summer bugs that infest SC will be coming out to play soon.  I've heard we're even do some rather noisy visitors this summer. 

It's always nice to learn that billions of Cicadas are going to emmerge, molt, mate and die in a six week period.  All the while, they will make noise.  Annoying, shutting-the-window-can't-block-this-sound kind of noise.

My friend Sara is coming into town tomorrow, so YAY for that! Me thinks we're going to see Troy sometime while she's in town (Orlando Bloom *drool*).

I honestly can never think of anything interesting to write in this thing.  Why did I even start one? *shrugs* One of life's many secrets I'm afraid.

Anywho, hopefully I'll figure out how to make one o' those cool little icon thingies.  Or find someone who can make one for me... *looks pointedly at all her friends* I know at least ONE of you knows how."

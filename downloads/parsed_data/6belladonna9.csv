he haunts me....
it has been three months, and yet 
he is still there, writhing under my skin
haunting me....when i am alone with myself
how easy it was at first....to break away
my temper there to fuel me on
but now.....now that the anger has dissipated
all there is 
is the void of him that cannot be masked
the emptiness i feel every night
this man that had the power to lift my spirit
was also capable of wounding me with a razor tongue
one that sliced me at will, and does....or did
and here i am......missing him
quite the masochist i turned out to be
there is no healing for this hurt
i love the king
and want to kill the tyrant
but they are two sides
of the same coin......."

"event","hmmmm.....my mind paused for a moment on the phrase.....what the hell?
what the hell......where could that expression have come from?  if you break it down word by word they dont really make any apparent sense.  so of course i had to know.....

i found this......
<a href=""http://www-personal.umich.edu/~jlawler/aue/thehell.html"">http://www-personal.umich.edu/~jlawler/aue/thehell.html</a>

""""What the hell"" is used to express disregard for conventional procedure and precautions, in varying degrees (the phrase has some of the same implications as ""devil-may-care""). It is usually a phrasal interjection, without further syntactic ramifications:

   What the hell, let's just compile it now and see if it runs.
   The odds were 100 to 1, so I said what the hell, I'll bet it all.

This is sometimes spelled in eye dialect as ""wotthehell"" or the like.  Don Marquis's character Mehitabel in ""archy and mehitabel"" immortalized this usage in the field of English (lowercase) letters:

   wotthehell wotthehell theres life in the old girl yet

""What the hell"" is sometimes seen with an exclamation point, but should not be written in this usage with a question mark (or pronounced as a question); ""What the hell?"", often with multiple question marks, is short for a true question, like ""What the hell is going on?"" or ""What the hell did you say?"".

Another fixed phrase is ""The hell you say"" (""*The hey you say""),expressing (often surprised) disbelief at the last thing the speaker has been told. It can function merely to express shock, or as an active challenge, equivalent to calling your conversation partner a liar.  Conventions vary, and one should not use this phrase in a speech context without having heard it used there before, and understanding its implications.

 (Note, parenthetically, that the use of the definite article with  ""hell"" is in itself idiomatic; like ""heaven"", ""home"", ""school"", and in the UK, at least, ""hospital"" and ""university"", these are locatives pure and simple.

     If you say a bad word you'll go to (*the) Hell.  )

The other uses of ""the hell"", on the other hand, have plenty of syntax. It appears to be short for ""in the hell"", which is also heard, along with ""in hell"", though less frequently.  Both ""in the hell"" and ""the hell"" are restricted to WH-questions, where they follow the interrogative WH-marker.  NB: either, but *not* both, of (in) and (the) may be deleted in these

    Who (in) (the) hell is that?
    What (in) (the) hell are they doing?
    How (in) (the) hell did she get invited?
    Where (in) (the) hell did he come from?
    Why (in) (the) hell did you do that?
    When (in) (the) hell is this rain going to stop?

This also  applies to embedded questions, which have different syntax:

    I don't know who (in) (the) hell that is.
    I don't know what (in) (the) hell they're doing.
    I don't know how (in) (the) hell she got invited.
    I don't know where (in) (the) hell he came from.
    I don't know why (in) (the) hell you do that.
    I don't know when (in) (the) hell this rain is going to stop.

Pragmatically, ""the hell"" functions as an intensifier, usually indicating at least surprise, and often unpleasant surprise, and there is almost always another word in the sentence that receives contrastive stress to indicate that it is the focus of the surprise.  Co-occurence of other interjections and topic particles like ""well"" is also common.  The idea seems to be to mark the sentence strongly, iconic with the strength of the emotion to be expressed.

Hell is considered by many (but not by as many as it used to be) to be a taboo word, like ""death"" or ""cancer"". Therefore it spawns euphemisms, which are words meaning the same thing as a taboo term, but considered safer for bystanders by experts in word magic.""


the word for today is paranthetically........"

"event","i had a most perfect halloween last night......

bill, a friend and co-worker of mine, had been badgering me all week to come to the ""trail of terror"" he and his friends have every year for the occasion.  knowing how much work he put into it it led my curiosity wandering to what exactly was incorporated in this trail of terror.  so me and chris....or christopher robbins as i call him....decided to go.  finding it was a task in itself, but we finally made it there.  

when we arrived they were taking a break, so we chatted some with bill and erica, his girlfriend, along with the others that participated in the event.  bill noted he had something to show me and led me to the entrance where there was a skeleton in a made up coffin standing against the fence.  he proceeded to tell me about how the skeleton was donated from a neighbor that day, knowing they have this shindig every year, he thought it would make for a nice addition.  at first they thought it was a fake, as most would.....but upon closer observation bill and the others were convinced it was an authentic human skeleton.  of course i had to investigate for myself, thinking they were just toying with me....so i ordered them to shine some light on it and i thoroughly inspected it with my natural discerning eye.  i felt the bones, they had an aged smoothness to them.....i noticed the slight erosions around the joints, which were porous in certain places.....but what sold me, was the broken rib bones, looking at the cross section you could clearly see the marrow cavities......this was an authentic human skeleton!  the first one i have ever had the pleasure of openly touching and exploring.  i became facinated after that, touching all the surfaces....i held the skeleton's hand in my own and remember realizing that thats what the bones in my own hand look like underneath all the flesh....i thought of african elephants, how when they come across other elephant bones, they stop and touch them.....just as i was touching these human remains.  it was marvelous....so much so that bill had to sort of pull me away because they were ready to start the trail of terror tour....the reason i was there in the first place.  

the trail of terror was impressive....they did an outstanding job.  i wasn't necessarily scared....it takes much more to scare me.....i was more amused than anything with all the props and creativity they came up with.  they even had a realistic animatronics dinosaur which i found out later one of the guys had done all by himself with his own ingenuity.  it wasn't just props either....they created entire atmospheres for each set with lighting, noise, and smoke.....and that is what made it effective.  i wish we had gone earlier so i could see the little kiddies screaming thru it....hahaha.  alas, we were the last tour of the night......

afterward, we gathered around a little bonfire they had made to get warm.  they talked about the behind the scenes and how things worked, and how drunk they were that night....apparently most of them had been drinking rum and coke's since the afternoon...hahaha.  just then someone pointed to the sky and as i turned around and looked up i saw a blazing falling star shoot across the night.  i had never seen one that clear or brilliant before.  a magnificent moment.....

before we left i had another session with the skeleton....i couldn't help myself....hahaha.  bill asked me what the best part was, and of course i said the skeleton, to which he pointed out that after all the hard work they did all week....the highlight turned out to be something they received that day.....we all had to laugh at the irony there.  bill came up with the idea to prop the skeleton to hold the cauldron of candy at the entrance so when the kiddies take the candy, they are taking it from the actual dead.....a great idea......but that will be for next year.......

a most magical hallow's eve it was......"

"event","<a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2005/LAW/10/21/vitale.suspect/index.html"">goth loner arrested for death of lawyer's wife......</a>

naturally this headline caught my eye immediately....
i had actually been keeping track of the case itself....the bludgeoned death of this lawyer's wife, simply because it seemed suspicious.  the spouse of a high profile televised lawyer killed suddenly, in such a way, with no apparent motives to be found.  not many are bludgeoned to death in this day and age.....which provokes the idea that it was done in a fit of rage.  of course the husband lawyer was my first thought....but after watching a video stream of an interview he did, i got the feeling that he was innocent.  the sorrow and anguish he displayed seemed authentic to me....either that or he is quite the actor on an elite level.  

and now the top suspect that has been arrested.....a 16 year old goth kid
the plot thickens......
and from the looks of it they are REALLY playing up the gothic factor, which is interesting in a way because it sheds light on how the media views and reports about us goths within a national headline context.  the above article was not actually the first one i read about this arrest....the initial one hadn't named the teenager yet due to his age, but it said much more about him from interviews with kids that knew him or of him.....they must have mentioned him being a satanist about 7 times, that he drew pentagrams, and carried around a satanic bible.  

so now the thing that has my attention is the fact that a gothic cross was carved into the victim's back.  notice they do not say inverted cross....just gothic cross.  now i am no satanist but of the few i know that would wear a cross i've never seen them wear it right side up.....it has only been inverted.  so for this kid to be such a hardcore satanist....you would think that in committing a crime this brutal, taking the time to carve a cross in the back of the victim....done to obviously send a message.....would it be right side up?  as a traditional gothic cross is.  wouldn't a devoted satanist, which is what they claim he is, want to leave a satanist's mark in sending his message?

now i understand there may be other factors to consider here, after all he is only 16.....but this cross carving is pointing me more in the direction of the possibility that this kid is being framed.  you would think that if he did it and made this effort to carve this cross he would be openly confessing to the crime, perhaps even boasting about it.  a goth wanting to evade arrest wouldn't leave such bread crumbs behind.......especially in a community with a very remote number of goths to begin with.....i believe even a 16 year old understands that much.....

*note* if by saying gothic cross....the media is meaning an inverted one....then they really do not know what the fuck they are talking about......"

"event","a comment i made in <lj user=""draugen"">'s journal.......on the subject of jealousy

jealousy is an all natural happening...it is a primitve reaction, a basic instinct within each of us. it can even be seen physiologically, the way the body reacts when in a jealous fit...it is more of a hormonal anger. when we choose a mate, one we become attached to and plan on spending part or all of our life with, our chemistry changes. our body says this is the person we will be mixing genes with and this person will only be mixing genes with us. in fact the body takes precautions to ensure this, without us even knowing. i could go further into that but i wont...hahaha

just look at the animal kingdom....it is why bucks compete for does, why lions protect their pride, and why stallions herd their mares....its all genetic ownership. we are part of that kingdom as well....HOWEVER....we are also animals of reason, we can take a step back and see it for what it is....primitive instinct. what we do from there is completely individual. i believe it is easier to suppress in some than it is for others.

so the next time u see two guys in a bar/club fighting over a girl, think of two rams butting heads for a chance to mate...they are about the same equivalent ;0)"

i want to write....i want to feel its flow, where my fingers find it hard to keep up with the spilling of my mind.....the giddiness....the not eating the whole day because i haven't the time or desire to do so.....the exhaustion and the early rising despite the lingering need for sleep.  i love it all.....where has it gone?

i need stimulation.....but finding it can be a tricky thing....tricky tricky tricky
it has to be just right to create that purely electric spark in my recesses
adequate enuf to liquify and stir the brew therein......

patience patience dear....i can see myself reprimanding me with those words along with a knowing eye and the shaking of a finger.....it is what i would tell someone with this same predicament.  cheap advice, tho it may be true......but my patience is running thin.....i wonder if that is due to my age now, i know i was much better at it before.....

i was called a liar the other day.....and tho this would normally not ruffle a single feather of mine it seemed to get under my skin....i suppose because of who it was and that they were so adamant about it as if it were fact.....and over something so foolish at that!  bloody bastard.....i should have known better.  a mule....is a mule....is a mule....

i digress....

perhaps writing about my need for bless'ed inspiration is just the thing needed to invoke it....t'would be nice t'wouldn't it...."

"event","i was watching a documentary the other night on understanding fire.  they did a segment on forest fires and why they occur.  i, like many, know that tho forest fires are devastating they are natural and needed.....but most dont understand why.  see when a forest lives untouched it goes thru the natural process of procreation....making seedlings every season creating other little trees.  with more and more facimiles a dense forest is then produced.  dense forests suck the ground dry of its minerals, trying to meet the supply and demand it now has to cope with...this then brings about trees of poor quality.  they become brittle and sickly looking with thinned out leaves and trunks.  with the amount of oxygen in the air and fuel at hand....all it takes is a spark, usually from a strike of lightning.....to burn it all to the ground on a mass scale.    the aftermath is then absorbed back into the ground over the years, replenishing the earth, and soon new forest grows back....stronger with greater vitality and durability.  

<img src=""http://www.userweb.suscom.net/~belladonna/web/fireflames.jpg"" align=""left"">now if this cycle does not happen on a regular basis the fire becomes all the more intense and will reach farther than normal.  yellowstone park made the mistake of preventing these from occuring naturally and they suffered the retribution when finally in 1988 a blaze started and wiped out half of the entire park.  no matter the thousands of firefighters and military and intellect.....man could not put out that fire.  the blaze itself got so hot it created massive firestorms....and let me say that those are the most beautiful and deadly displays of nature i've ever seen....they looked like white, yellow, and orange wisps of glowing phantoms, swirling with the wind.

after thinking about all this it came to mind that people are like these forests.  we grow and grow and sometimes become too abundant, spreading ourselves thin, then when it is all too much something sparks and we are burned down to the ground.  however after some time, when we rise from our ashes we see that we are then better than we were before.  there are those that try to protect themselves, by taking every precaution.....every prevention.....holding on to themselves for dear life, they soon realize that when they are finally burned, and it is inevitable, it becomes an inferno, and is all the more harder to experience and recover from.....

it is better to live life and sometimes play with fire while ur at it......"

<h2>Your Sexual Energy is <a href=""http://www.quizdiva.com/yellow.html"">Yellow</a>!</h2>
You have the sensuality of a goddess or spiritual temptress.
And you feel that your sexual energy comes from a deep source.
You love to tease and foreplay is by far your greatest sexual talent.
<br>
You feel the sun's light streaming through you 
and you reflect that energy into your partner.
You enjoy both giving and taking.
You feel completely equal and at peace during foreplay.
You have immense patience and love to touch in all of the right spots.
You tend to keep home lovers who have endured your seduction 
for extended periods of time.
You like to see your lovers over and over again to insure 
that they are completely yearning for you.
<br>
If you want to spice up your sex life, add a bit of raw sexuality.
Maybe a few silk scarves, or some erotica to share together.
Bring in fantasy and fun, and that will mix with your sexy spiritual 
self just delightfully!
<br>
Kate Hudson and Cate Blanchett both know how to light up a room 
with their yellow sexual energies.
<br>
People who have sexual energies of red, green, and pink 
are a good match for you.

"event","gothic rating communities........the phrase itself is an oxymoron
goths serving themselves on a platter eagerly awaiting either a silver spoon of ecstatic praise or the rabid feasting of vultures.  

i conducted my own <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/community/serpentinesiren/42840.html"">experiment</a>..........
me myself applied to one of the many to see exactly what entailed being rated.  i completed the survey answering all questions honestly and in my own manner.  then the jury was out......my yeses were for the most part well thought and i was given reasons pointing out what they liked.....my no's were anything but.....not once was i given a credible reason as to why i received the no, i could respect a rejection if it were fitting, but these were more flitty, for example.....i didn't enjoy what u said......or i'll give a yes if ur real name is belladonna.....my favorite was, ur trying to be way too cryptic.....hahahahaha.....such assumptions.  i pulled the plug on them before i was given a true verdict, i had enuf to produce a proper conclusion

rating communities on a whole are foolish.....but gothic rating communities?  gothic to me denotes a higher level of depth and intelligence....individuality.....we are one in ourselves and yet we are whole, with the attitude of ""i am who i am and if u don't like it fuck off"" yet here are those serving themselves for acceptance....and those wanting to judge thinking themselves of higher quality.....tsk tsk tsk.......so shallow there isn't enuf depth to even get my feet wet

since then....and this was a while ago.....i've received other invitations to join other rating communities......and tho i may be flattered in a slight way for being thought of in the first place, i declined and will continue to decline any such notions.........

i was wandering around in my head today.....staring at my computer screen.  all the while little message boxes flashing ""i have spoken!""  in an attempt to catch attention.....and we do speak in this cyberspace, offering suggestions of ourselves in the most subtle of ways.  take for instance the fonts we use to chat.  a slight expression.....but an expression nonetheless.  it is almost like an emotional gauge in a way.....on one end u have ur black arial 10 pt, the default for most programs....very no nonsense and by the book, no time no need for frilly notions or personal connotations.....bah....
and on the other end u have ur very artistic swirls and strokes of font.....monotype corsiva, tiranti solid, vivaldi, edwardian script......all in a myriad of colors.  blended shades, shadows, italics.....care is obviously taken in their selection, they are wanting people to know that ""this is me"" in a very small microscopic nutshell.....

recently tho....it seems it is now my turn to be left behind.  the number of individuals moving on being quite noticable....i feel as if i am getting a dose of my own medicine.  none is the effect of ill accord towards me.....at least i don't think.  it just seems our time together has to come to a close.....it is an unspoken matter.  tho it may make me sad, it does not depress me....it leaves me with more of a ""thats unfortunate"" feeling.  i do wish them well in their endeavors and hope they smile when they look down the path of their life behind them and see me among the many faces.

"event","i attended a private psychic soiree yesterday afternoon......donna, a friend of my mother's was throwing this polite shindig out in the peaceful country in their beautiful homemade house with extra large windows.  beautiful windows....i love windows.....yet these windows are so big the birds have a tendency of flying head first into them.  shame about the birds......

there were probably no more than say seven ladies other than myself and my mother that attended. most of them nurses, as is donna, that i presume worked with each other.  then i met barb, the psychic, she was quite friendly, open, and talkative.  so i watched her for awhile.  any other time i've gotten a psychic reading i had known of the psychics prior to going.....recommended thru close friends, i'd judge thru their experiences on how authentic the psychics they encountered may be.  being that i did not have this information available to me i came to the party a bit skeptical.  so i observed, and when the chit chat leaned into the topic of spiritualism and what exactly she does i was there with my questions.   my mother seemed to have many questions as well, and revelations of her own.  it seems my grandmother has been seeing spirits in her own house.  now that she is alone most of the day since my grandfather died last year i suppose she has had the peace needed to tune in, so to speak.  most of them from what i heard are benevolent, yet there is one that is a bit on the nasty side, that likes to scare her......or at least that is what she felt.  curious curious.....curious that i wasn't told of this prior, it seemed to have been going on a while, and well it is known that this kind of thing is my forte, so why i was kept in the dark i can't be certain.....

""i was always told growing up that anything mystical was of the devil""....mom
""most everyone from religious families was taught that growing up""....donna
""my mother taught that to me"".....mom
""yes and in turn you taught it to me"".....me
""yeah well u never listened anyway"".....mom
""hahahaha......and thats a good thing"".....me

thats not completely true.  i did listen when i was much younger, and i found it very hard to break away from that sort of thinking, especially when ur mother is so devoted.....luckily i also freed myself at a young age.  i think the fact that i didn't like church was the constant red flag that said all is not as i was told......to this day i can't stand plastic smiles.  so it was very interesting to me that my mother had all these questions.....i think at the age of 47 she is realizing now that all is not as she was told either.  

thru my observations i couldn't read any deceptive gestures in barb, she wasn't studying or prying for information....she spent most of the time talking about herself and this mystic mecca up in new york called lily dale, which is where she took the classes to enhance her ability.  a place i had never heard of before, so it caught my interest naturally.  its basically a small town where clairvoyants and mediums gather and they hold seminars and demonstrations for the public and each other.  it also includes a small school that teaches different spiritual practices and beliefs......i wouldn't mind investigating it myself.  after the chatting died down it was time for the readings to begin....so barb went downstairs and one by one we went down for our 10 minute readings.  i was the charming third to take my turn.  

i sat myself on the couch to the side of her and she explained that she likes to start with a prayer to tune herself into the spirits that surround me.  she asked to take my hands while she did this, and when i placed my hands in hers i felt this surge of energy run right up my arms.  when i felt that i knew this wasn't some flim flam con.....i reacted then and to provide my own assistance i began to resonate my own energies and i found myself go inside myself for the duration that she said her prayer.  when she was done we parted hands and she began receiving her messages.  the dominant spirit that came thru was a grandmother figure she said, she was very outspoken, jolly, and was a heavy set woman.  being that both of my grandmother's are still living i figured it was one of my great-grandmothers, none of which i knew very well.  the first thing she told me was someone was picking on me.....my first reaction being....NO ONE picks on me!  tho i didn't say it....hahaha.....after i leashed my brazen arrogance, i thought about it.....and bill popped into my head.  bill is a good friend of mine that i work with....he is intelligent and sarcastic like me so we have a fun time coming up with inventive insults for one another....and tho it is all in fun there is a certain topic he jives me on that i can never come up with an adequate comeback to, reason being that if i did i would be insulting the rest of the room.....so it strikes a cord with me....and on friday i left work a bit irritated about it all.  so i revealed some of that to her, and grandma said he is a loud mouth, which he is,  and she doesn't like what he says to me and to tell him to stop....which i was going to.  she went on about my job....that i sit in one place and work with my hands, which i do....i manage information into systems.....and she said that i want to break away from that and do something that uses my creativity and imagination since i have an extraordinary  one....which i want and have been trying to find a way of doing lately.  she asked me if i liked children because she sees me working with something with children.....and just the night before i was batting around a few ideas and the thought of writing a children's book came to mind.  she asked if i could draw.....i told her i can but i dont usually, i kind of put down the sketch pencil and picked up the quill so to speak......she said someone very close to u does tho and she sees me working with them on these books...that would be my sister, she is an artist and has been looking for a way to get her work seen.  she says i will definitely be published.  she then spoke of a cat, a grayish cat with darker stripes.....i couldn't remember any cat of that description, my cat now is black as midnight, so she said to keep it in mind and it may come to u later.  she said i am very into native american indians....which i am, and that she sees me taking a trip somewhere out west concerning something with the indians....that one i have no prior wanting of doing, but we'll see.....she told me that i have a problem with letting people get close to me, letting them in, especially men.....that thru my experiences with my father and past relationships, i've equated men with hurt......which is true to an extent and im always being told that i have a wall around myself to keep people out.  finally she went on to the person i hold in my heart.  she said it is a very sticky situation....with all the distance....that in a way it is good because i can do what i have to do to get my goals in order, but that its leaving me waiting for something that has little chance of happening.  i asked her why....and she said his heart is in the right place, but he lacks the courage to change his situation and be with me.  this part upset me to tears, because deep inside i felt it was true......

later that day when i told my mother about what she told me, she said the grandmother that spoke to barb was my great-grandma howard......my mother's grandmother.  she refreshed my memory on how she was and she did fit the description.....i remember she was quite the comical woman.  i also remembered the cat she mentioned......it was an orphaned kitten i found in the ditch back home, i saved it and bottle fed it.....it was gray with black stripes.  it ended up having worms, and at that age i didn't know how serious that was so i reluctantly handed him over to the spca, i was so broken up about it my grandparents allowed me to have a kitten.....and that little black kitten i picked out at the pet store back then is the lexus i have now......

who at this very moment is having a ball playing inside a big blue walmart plastic bag....hahaha"

"event","i watched a 2 hour documentary last week on the history of russia, it was quite informative and will probably be added to my collection sometime soon.  i found it to say the least, very interesting.....

<img src=""http://www.userweb.suscom.net/~belladonna/web/ivan.jpg"" align=""left"">tsar ivan iv (1530-1584)......ivan the terrible, was indeed terrible.....but he was crafted to be as such due to the harsh childhood he had.  the kingdom at the time of his youth was in complete chaos and the prince was practically a starving beggar in his own palace as a little boy.....no one really bothered to notice him unless it was to abuse him and everyone he loved was either sent away or murdered.  this intelligent, sensitive boy, that was an insatiable reader, thru such atrocities and suppresion, became in essence......a monster.  he participated in so many numerous brutalities keeping a tally of them would be futile.....and this is speaking of his years as a young man.  what most do not know however is that when he met his future wife anastasia romanovna in 1547, a calm fell over him.  she softened his heart and tamed the beast in him and for the 13 years she was in his life there was peace and bliss within him and within the empire, he reformed and rooted out the corruption in his government and created the streltsi, his elite army .....there was not one execution during that time.....it is said to be the golden era of his reign.  in the summer of 1560 anastasia succumbed to an illness....some say she was poisoned.....that took her life.....and life away from ivan, after her death he suffered a mental collapse, lost all emotion and from that point on he commited the acts that added 'the terrible' to his name, spilling the blood of russia in rivers......even that of his own son that anastasia herself bore him.  lesson learned.......love can make a ruler a great one, the loss of it can break him and his empire......

ivan's death in 1584 left russia in a great upheaval.....he had named no heir to be ruler before he died.  many tried to become the next tsar but they either died or was overcome by someone else.  during this chaotic time a man from poland imposing to be one of the children of ivan's from his philandering days after anastasia's death came forward....no one knowing the wiser....he became king for a single year before he was found out.  the people executed him, burned his body, collected the ashes, placed it in a cannon, and shot him back to poland.....hahahaha.....lesson learned......anyone can become a king with the right timing and know how....ummm, just don't get caught ;0)

i have another lesson to share.....but i think i'll save that one for later....."

""But I don't want to go among mad people,"" Alice remarked.
""Oh, you can't help that,"" said the Cat ""we're all mad here. I'm mad.  You're mad.""
""How do you know I'm mad?"" said Alice
""You must be,"" said the Cat, ""or you wouldn't have come here.""
Alice didn't think that proved it at all; however, she went on ""And how do you know that you're mad?"" 
""To begin with,"" said the Cat, ""a dog's not mad.  You grant that?""
""I suppose so,"" said Alice
""Well, then,"" the Cat went on, ""you see, a dog growls when it's angry, and wags its tail when it's pleased.  Now I growl when I'm pleased, and wag my tail when I'm angry.  Therefore I'm mad.""

one of thee best works of literature, and why not be made for children?  it is best to wiggle inside the head then, plant a few seeds here and there, to have them grow........so when we return to the pages as adults we may notice the irony and metaphors within the words.....its sheer simplicity and corelation to the mundane reality of the mainstream we find ourselves in now.  for instance take the tale of the walrus and the carpenter......it is said that the walrus and the carpenter characters are representations of world religions, and the school of oysters, the naive impressionable minds of the people.  what happens?  the walrus and the carpenter convince the oysters to follow them to shore only to devour them for dinner.   it is all just preparation concocted by a genius who went by the name carroll....lewis that is, with his cheshire cat and mad hatters to lead the way from boring ordinary and prescribed beliefs.  

i have always had an innate relation with the mad hatter and cheshire cat since i can remember.....they just made sense and seemed like good fun....change places!  one seat down!  would u like more tea?  certainly, but just half a cup......sliced down the middle if u please..........am i mad?  absolutely!  i present a reflection of myself.....sane people present themselves so they may reflect each other.......therefore i am mad.....

"event","i had quite an elaborate dream last night.....i thought it best to get on here while it is still fresh in my memory.....

i dreamt i was somewhere remote, seemed like a place in pennsylvania but not the town i live in at the moment.  perhaps we were camping, there seemed to be cabins or small houses around....i remember my mother and a few other familiar faces being with me.  

it was nighttime, and i was outside with two others casually talking, when we heard a scream in the distance....we searched for the source, and thru the darkness we could see the silhouette of someone being attacked by a very large beast looking animal....and there was another of them heading our way.  panic ran thru us, we screamed and ran to the nearest little cabin house which wasn't that far, thankfully.  once inside we became silent and shushed whoever was living within the house, holding our breath as this thing approached....it slowly inspected our dwelling, pacing by the doorway.  all that was between us and it was a screen door, but it couldn't seem to get past it.  it could see us in there and this caused it frustration.  i remember finding this odd, it would take this creature little effort given its size to take down this door, yet it wouldn't, or for some reason couldn't.  then it vanished, and i slowly walked toward the door to see where it went when suddenly something was flung at the door, once it dropped i saw it was the mangled bloodied body of a dog, which must have belonged to the occupants of the house because the little girl inside started to cry and said its name.   this made me very angry, and i could see the beast outside peering at us, as if taunting us......feeling secure that it couldn't get past the door, i walked up to it again which placed me about two feet away from the beast outside....it snarled, and i roared back conveying my rage to this creature, we stared each other down for a moment until it reluctantly turned and left with the other it had come with.  

at first glance u would think it was a supernaturally large black wolf....but upon closer inspection u would find it has a hunch to its back and a longer snout than a wolf, a rat-like tail, slightly shaggy coat, and its mouth was lined top and bottom with long slim shredder kinds of teeth.  its eyes, menacing and crafty, there was thought behind them...constantly plotting.  the only thing close to it i've ever seen before are the rat hounds of bavmorda in the movie willow, except these were much more efficient, larger, and smarter.  

they came back again...and again....killing all livestock, pets, and a few people.  they would sometimes bring their offspring which were just as vicious as the adults.  no one wanted to leave their houses.  somehow we got word to the outside that we needed to be evacuated but for some reason they couldn't reach us where we were.....we would have to meet the rescue at a designated location, and tho we had vehicles there wasn't enough room for everyone.  being that we didn't want to leave anyone behind we decided to gather together and make the journey on foot.  there seemed to be times that were safer to be out with less risk of attack....how they figured this i don't know....they attacked during the day and night time hours.  the beasts seemed to have keen eye sight but a lacking sense of smell, so our best defense when they were in our midst was either to make for the trees or to hide....and hopefully quick enough to not leave any moving traces of where we were.  as we moved we encountered other small towns that were being attacked, we helped them, and they came with us.....the number of our gathering was growing, yet everyday we lost handfuls of them to the beasts.  

i remember having to cross an open field, which we knew would be dangerous if we were seen.  we made our way as fast yet as unnoticable as was possible.  suddenly someone sounded the alarm....i looked back to see a dozen or so of the beasts leap from out of the forest from whence we came.....we all ran, gathering children in our arms, and made for the other side of the clearing as fast as we could.  however there is no out running them as swift as they are, and we lost a good number of people to them that time.  

i remember in one of the towns we ran into.......climbing up the side of a trailer to get a dog down for a crying little girl to whom it belonged to.  she didn't want to leave without him.....and i thought of the other little girl who brutally lost her dog to the beast that first night, if i could just help this little girl get her dog it would help me in turn feel better about that previous experience.  as i climbed and propped myself atop the trailer roof i heard my mother below in a candid voice ""look at her climb....get ur skinny butt up there!""  i managed to laugh then....our usual way for dealing with such a stressful time.  

finally reaching our destination....we could see the two large rescue buses in sight by the roadside.  such a sigh of relief....we were seeing our salvation.  right when our heartbeats began to settle, someone sounded the alarm.....we all panicked, we were almost there!.....if we could just make it to the buses it would be the last time we'd have to run for our lives.  with that in mind we ran faster than we had ever before and practically leapt into those buses.  we lost a few stragglers, but once those doors shut we were safe.  we watched them then pacing around the buses, trying to find a way in.  feeling we triumphed some were taunting them, gloating that we indeed made it....and alive for those of us who were.  the engines started and we were on our way....leaving behind experiences that would stay in our memories forever.  the bus grew quiet in this reverie, this reflection of what had occured.  sorrow written on the faces that had lost loved ones, on others the trauma was etched into lines on their faces.

we travelled along winding roads as is everywhere in pennsylvania, i remember noting they were oddly barren.....but it wasn't until we reached what seemed like a turnpike or freeway, that we rose from our seats and looked with astonishment.....lines of other rescue buses like ours filled with frightened people like us.  this wasn't just happening in the area we were coming from as we had believed....but was happening on a mass scale all over....perhaps even globally.  a feeling of dread washed over us then, hopelessness.....the safety we had just felt was fleeting.  it wasn't over after all......

then i woke up........"

"event","i had the pleasure recently of watching the lion in winter, starring glenn close....which is a film about the life of king henry II of england, queen eleanor of aquitaine, sons prince john, prince richard (later to be king), and the overseen prince geoffrey, their exploits and plots on one winter's holiday in england.  based on historic fact lived around 1150 a.d.  

first i must say i am shamed.....do i have a passion for ancient/medieval history yes, yes i do....did i know of king henry II and queen eleanor prior to this film....heard of them yes, know of them unfortunately no.....and that is very bad considering the delicious facts of this great power and dynamic relationship.

this is a king and queen that loved and hated each other.....each trying desperately to be the victor of the other's demise.....and would go about this by any means.  i never knew of an instance in history until learning of them that a queen could wage war against a king.  bloody fantastic!......oh how i would have loved to say  ""my dear, if u do not agree with me then i shall simply have to go to war with u"" .......i could do no less than grow a great appreciation for this woman....she indeed waged war against henry along with her sons richard and geoffrey by her side.   not only that, but to show her loyalties to her army she rode bare breasted in warrior dress along with 280 of her maids to the battlegrounds.  the history books tell u it is in reference to the amazons....but actually it is the valkyries that rode (or flew, depending on the source) to the battlefields bare breasted....that fact should change.  a gallant display yes...but they didn't engage in the battle itself.  had it been me, i would have had those maids trained and ready to charge!  so yes she fought her long time and long lived husband, and almost succeeded....but henry won that one in the end, and had her imprisoned in a castle located in a distant province, and kept her there for about 12 years only allowing her out on certain holidays...such as christmas, to be displayed next to henry as the queen she was.  

it was one of those christmas' that the film is based on....particularly concerning at the time which son would succeed henry on the throne.   i enjoyed the film aside from the history, for the simple fact that it was unpredictable....u never knew when someone was being deceptive or being sincere....or perhaps a bit of both.  it is one of those movies u have to pay close attention to otherwise u'll miss a plot somewhere......and there are many clever plots floating about.....

that is one powerful historic family, and more disfunctional than any i have known before....."

"event","i watched an hbo documentary today called shelter dogs.....it debated the question on if euthanizing animals in shelters, particularly dogs, was justified and humane.  they spent time in both kinds of shelters....those that euthanized and those that didn't.  

most would think that those that put these dogs to sleep were more insensitive and clinical, but on the contrary.....they invested much more emotion and care with the animals they tried to find homes for, and with every dog they put to sleep u could sense a feeling of sadness and loss by the staff.  they will try all they can to first make sure these dogs can be adopted out thru different trainings and exercises, then with as much advertising as they can try to find them homes.  if they are not adoptable, have health complications, or have just been there for a long time with little response they are then put to sleep...

with the no-kill shelter, tho the title may sound merciful.....most of them are not.  just because these animals are not killed does not mean they live.....these places are all cement and steel, a guilded cage with little or no contact by humans or even other dogs.  they say when a dog that has known a loving home is taken to one of these shelters they face mental insanity within a weeks time.  so what likelihood then do they face being adopted out?  a slim chance at best......they live in these cages pacing, barking, crying, they become aggressive, depressed.....some of them even start chewing on themselves.  they are lucky if they are taken out to run for 5 minutes.....depending on the shelter.  for a domesticated dog that was bred to serve and be loved by humans it is a most torturous existence.  it would be hard for any lover of animals to keep from shedding a tear looking at these poor creatures.....

i would think humans as a whole would sympathize greatly with these animals, shelter animals in general really.....some of us can be quite alike in this respect.  to be unwanted and discarded hoping someone will come along and see the good in us....or just see us.....hopefully love and protect us.....now imagine that behind fencing, atop cold cement, and without the ability to speak....."

it never fails everytime i attend....that everyone assumes i am native american as well, my ethnic appearance allows me a versatile appeal, and i have always found it flattering.  a part of me wishes i actually was.....to belong to such a small number of individuals with such a rich culture that dates back to the ice age.....it is the primitive root that is still with them that evokes my solemn appreciation.....reminds me we are from the earth and shall return to it.....dust to dust, ashes to ashes......

"event","i wish it were possible to take a true to life photo of the night i was out in last evening.  the moon was so bright it lit the sides of the mountains and gave everything an eerie glow.  i suppose that is part of the allure tho....its elusive quality, not to be properly captured thru any lense.  tonight is what i've really been anticipating.....the blue moon.  the second full moon of the month in leo......my sister and i will venture to the beach at the witching hour to properly consecrate it.  

today i am fairly certain i will be getting inked.  the eye of horus also known as the udjat, between my shoulders right below my neck.  a place i keep touching to measure how painful it will be, and i think it will be.....it seems like a sensitive spot and somewhat on a bone as well.  the eye of horus symbolises protection and the bringing of wisdom. the eye also symbolises our ability to see with clarity and truthfulness.  i've been meaning to get it for awhile now........and a blue moon is the perfect occasion for it.  

somewhere between all this i'd like to see ""the village"".....and I WILL

oh yes.....i met some man in my dreams last night named ""entyce love"".....i didn't know him and i cannot really recall his face, i was just casually introduced to him by someone.  i wonder what that is all about......"

"event","loneliness can make people do some rather crazy things....
due to my analytical nature it makes me think crazy things as opposed to actually doing them.....tho i have done my share of doing in the past.  reflecting back on them now some instances make me laugh outright.....others make me cringe....and then there are the few times that still shock me to this day.....

i have an opportunity presently that i've been thinking those crazy thoughts about, one that everyone else would say is a good idea....some have already said.  a situation that would indeed alleviate my loneliness for a time......but i know better.  despite my best intention the outcome would end in the destruction of a tender soul and i would rather not have that on my conscience.  loneliness is never a good reason to be with someone.....essentially and initially it is just a sweetened way of using.  thankfully i have no taste for such methods.......they only leave a trail of heartless monsters in their wake.....i've been attacked by a chosen few

so it will only be kept as a thought
i'd rather just remain the way i am....."

"event","the other day i went with my father to the movies to see king arthur.....and it was better than i expected.  they really only touch on a small portion of the arthurian legend in their own twist of events, the outcome reminding me more of a braveheart sort of arthur.  impressive tho considering there were no big name actors used for it.....it is something i look forward to watching again....

however......that was not the most interesting part of the day....

the most interesting part of the day was being in the truck with my father on the way to the movies.  i can't quite recall how we got on the subject, but he proceeded to explain to me about this cd he bought.  apparently a cd that when heard is supposed to fill you with energy and motivation by just listening to it.  the concept was not completely foreign to me, i've heard of such a thing before........it was the fact that my father was sitting there telling me this that was the shocking factor......MY father.......bought a new age/spiritual cd.......for $60.......ummm, wow.......it was a bit hard to believe, and he was so enthusiastic in his telling of it, even providing testimonials of friends he has that have used the cd.  initially he heard of it thru a friend that introduced him to the guy that sells the cds along with these crystal pendant necklaces........and he went further in explaining about the crystals.  the crystal is supposed to be placed over ur heart while sleeping and is claimed to energize and bring inner peace......they also cost about $100.  the cost and my knowledge on crystals has me a bit skeptical on that part of it......i know of no crystals that possess those properties and is also rare enough to hold such a hefty price......i would have to investigate further to come to any real conclusions.  

the experience really opened my eyes as to who my father is now, how he has grown and expanded......now if only my mother could be as open to such possibilities all would be well, however i am not holding my breath on that one....."

"event","i had a photo shoot today with my sister and cousin....something that previously i was not looking forward to especially due to the fact that the day before i had ventured to the beach and stayed out a bit longer than i should have, in effect a nice rouge mark was burned on my nose.....very unsightly!!!  a little more vitamin D than was anticipated.....

once we arrived at the studio it wasn't as bad as i thought it would be.....the pampering was actually soothing in a way.  at one point i had four little asian girls working on me at once, getting my hair and makeup done....it was a delicate feeling having these petite hands gently padding and brushing my skin and rolling my hair.  when all was finished  i rather liked the outcome......it was how i had envisioned it.  

we won't be seeing the proofs of those sessions for another week.....however after we were done at the studio my sister and i thought it would be fun to fool around with the digital camera........so here are a few candid shots she took of me......

"event","my my my.....im finally here.....here where home is.....
i had decided on a last minute whim to see my girlfriends in jersey before my long journey.  the time was well overdue.....so i made a call and was there the following day, surprising most of them......something im well known for doing.  all of them told me how they were speaking of me the week before, and there i show up out of the blue......of course i told them it was because i heard them, they in turn gave me the predictable rolling of the eyes, then after the discerning stare as if saying ""did u really?"".....hahahaha....they can never tell with me ;0) and i enjoy winding their minds.  it was a good time....as it always is with them....

so yes, here i am.....after a 10 hour flight thru the heavens, i arrived on familiar soil once again.  things have changed and stayed the same, as is always the case with time that passes.  the beaches, i can count on them to remain as i left them, tho the sands may shift with the tides....they will always be as they are.  all i have to do is dive into the crystal clear waters and i am seven years old again playing mermaid.  

i found that floating on the surface of the water makes for an excellent meditative state.  it can feel quite surreal to be suspended in water that way with nothing but ethereal blue sky in sight, and when the water plugs ur ears all u hear is ur breathing and the soothing sounds of the ocean........it gave me a taste of the universe....."

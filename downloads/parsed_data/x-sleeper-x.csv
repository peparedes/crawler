      Omg yesterday was the funniest day ever! I went to the Altamonte Mall theather to c a movie called the Terminal wit some of my pals rite. And the red hott n boom was rite next us, and it was really annoying cuz while we r watchin the movie fireworks were goin off. Anywayz when the movies was almost over some guy who was drunk from the red hott n boom ran over the electrical box thingy that controls all the power in the theater and it was pitch black. We were in the dark 4 like an hour. It was kinda fun, and when we finally got out it was like 1:00 am in the morning and we went over to this restruant called Ginas and we were so scared to go into it cuz @ first we thought it was a strip club. We all really had to go to the bathroom cuz the ticket guy at the theather is a dick and wouldnt let us back in so we had to go to Ginas. Omg and the girl at the front(hostess)was like a lezbo cuz she gave all of us candy and she would only give women who walked out the door candy! It was so funny! OmG, u guyz should have been there!!!And then we saw my friend Hilary who was at red hott n boom and she told me it sucked ( i already knew it would)and the hottest guy was wit her. But then we got picked up at like 2:30am. Then we hung out at Marisels house for a while. Then Dianna's mom called and and was pissed so we walked Dianna home. But then this guy who we gave Diannas number 2 at the movies called her cell, and it was like 3:30 am , WTF!!! CAN U SAY DESPERATE! He was really stupid and annoying, we hated him so we told him Dianna was seeing someone else and he asked who and i said me and he like paused and said he had to GO!!! omg we were like so hyper off candy cuz we were in the theater for like 3 hour and a half hours if u include the movie time and we got there early to begin wit. Well that was my day with no parents buggin me, not havin to worry about what time i gotta call (my rents are outta town) NO WORRIES! Thats about it haha, g2g ttyl guyz lata, u know how to reach me!

<p align=""center""><font face=""Verdana"">Motive, power, and action, arising from Inspiration and Impulse.</font></p>
<p align=""center""><font face=""Verdana"">The Lovers represents intuition and inspiration. Very often a choice needs to be made.</font></p>
<p align=""center""><font face=""Verdana"">Originally, this card was called just LOVE. And that's actually more apt than &quot;Lovers.&quot; Love follows in this sequence of growth and maturity. And, coming after the Emperor, who is about control, it is a radical change in perspective. LOVE is a force that makes you choose and decide for reasons you often can't understand; it makes you surrender control to a higher power. And that is what this card is all about. Finding something or someone who is so much a part of yourself, so perfectly attuned to you and you to them, that you cannot, dare not resist. This card indicates that the you have or will come across a person, career, challenge or thing that you will fall in love with. You will know instinctively that you must have this, even if it means diverging from your chosen path. No matter the difficulties, without it you will never be complete.</font></p>

Today we worked on music for the wedding. I like how it is getting closer and I haven't had anymore dreams yet. Had 2 dreams couldn't find the bridesmaid dresses and that I hadn't found the dress yet."

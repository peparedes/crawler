Really i'm only posting at the moment because of the intense case of bordom that has beseeched me lately. *sigh* 

Thus you ::being whomever <i>actually</i> does read this?!:: shall be bombarded with everything and anything that comes to mind...

So it looks like we are going to sell the house...it's not something we are really looking forward to.

 And if we don't sell the house mum is going to try and get a second mortgage and buy the house off my dad...*blinks* second mortgage...

<strike>how are we going to pay that off in our lifetime?! I'm going to be the only one working and i don't inparticular feel like paying extra to go to the mortgage, not that i'm going to be paid enough to really pay extra anyways.</strike>.


Ok so i guess i don't really have that much more to say, i'm just kind of spamming..plus in about three minutes i'm going to be kicked off so i may as well go now.

My mum had a nutrimetics party today, you know one of those horrible make-up parties?

I was planning on running away from it, alas...things didn't end up that way. |:/ *cries* So instead i had to do the shopping for it, pick up my mothers friends and also do some cooking for it. *yawns* I'm so exhausted!

It wasn't so bad though, D' and her mum came along so it's not like i was alone in the great bordom of it all.

You should have seen the lady who comes with the nutrimetics stuff...she was awful at make-up! After 35 yrs you would think she would know a little about putting the stuff on!

On another note---OMGosh it's so hot and humid here, i'm literally sticking to the chair and i'm not even moving about or anything...that is how hot it is. I thought we were going to get some rain...which would take away a bit of the humidity, but the clouds just passed by us. :(

Well yeah, i'm just rambling now. I'm so bored and have nothing to say...eXcept <B>i have to get out of this house damn it!</B> It's just to much for me, i haven't been out-out for quite a while! I must go out somewhere before i start working and tafe again!

"event","So...

I went to my great uncles funeral today, there wasn't as many people  as i had thought  there would be. Which is sad, 'cos i know he had many friends, it's just my nan didn't know how to contact them all. And the fact that there wasn't many people there made my nan even more upset, at her brothers passing then she already was.<small><strike>Did i mention i hated funerals?...</small></strike>

It was weird...<strike><i>kinda</strike></i>...today was the first time i had stepped into a church for a service in about five years, and still i knew the majority of songs without having to read from the hymn book! I stopped going to church because it just didn't feel right for me, i use to go for mum,'cos she felt like a <i>bad</i> Christian, i think, when none of her five children turned up with her. I wouldn't say I'm not a religious person, i mean i have beliefs...just not that of the Christian faith...

All through the service, the burial...the whole thing, i was kind of on auto pilot,i just wasn't... <i>there</i>. If you get what i mean. <strike> I suck at the eXplanations...</strike> All i could think of was when we had my pop's and my other nana's funeral... and somewhere in the back of my head was <i>""You had a dream like this...""</i> i mean i didn't dream that my great uncle passed away, but, i did have a dream of a funeral about a week ago...It made me feel so sad when i woke up, so depressed.

I really don't like all these weird dreams and night-scares i keep having, i feel like i'm going insane...which makes me want to stop with the taking of these pills, that are meant to make my migranes better!

That's another thing i really can't take anymore...the migranes. Yesterday i had to re-enrol for my tafe course. <small><small><small>Which took me five hours of waiting to get done!</small></small></small> And i had such a bad attack of pain in my head, like little <strike>though it felt huge when it happened</strike> electric blasts, that i fell against the wall and almost dropped all my things. I haven't had a reaction like that before from this on-going migrane...it was kinda scary. Hopefully all this medication i'm on will make it go away soon...
although my perscription for one of the pain-killers has ran out, and the other ones are too expensieve at the moment for me to get, so i don't have the slightest bit of relief during the day anymore. :'(

And...and to top it all off, the littlest things keep going wrong in between the big things...for example, my car--it keeps making these strange and scary sick noises, i can no longer hear music play through my computer..it just stopped all of a sudden while i was using it. *shrugs* And people keep telling me it's my fault we have a $130 internet bill for the last month. <strike> i haven't been home the last month, well barely!</strike> And that i called Switzerland..or Sweden and raked up some crazy bill...you know there reasoning?! ""Well your the only one who had a friend visit over there, or someplace like it...!"" Yes, yes i did...but that was quite a while ago...<B>not in the last two months!!!</B>

...

So yeah that is the bulk of my week, i knew life had to get worse! Last week was so good...job, RSA, B'day celebrations...all good things. The universe had to equal out a <i>bit</i> i guess."

However this constant bordom of mine is driving me insane...there is only a certain amount of time you can sit and play that helicoptor game, crashing it just as you get to 950. <strike>I question, is it so much to ask that people DO NOT distract you, just until you can get passed 1000?</strike>

And i just can't seem to concentrate on reading...i was reading this Harry Potter fic earlier, then this play, and when i gave up on that i started a new novel...surfice to say i didn't get that far. <small>once i passed the first hundred pages, i was like-Meh, it's started now i can put it down and loose it. <strike>as i do oh so often with reading material!</strike></small>

Apart from that i so can't wait till i go and see The Shins with D' and Chayne. :D *bouncy* Only about two weeks to go.

Speaking of two weeks from now, that's also when i have to go back to tafe...It sucks i went in yesterday because i had the wrong enrolment date, so now i have to go back tomorrow and wait around all over again.

Happy news though at least by the time tafe starts i should have started at my new job... <small><small><small><strike>I can't help but to mention the job thing, i'm so excited about it! I haven't had a good job for quite a while.

"event","I made a cake today, that's just how desperate i am of distracting myself from smoking...Oh yeah, I'm quitting. O.o I don't think i mentioned that before...

I hate this feeling, i never use to get it when i would smoke for a weekend, or a week here and there. Since i've been smoking almost everyday though for the last 2 months it has become kind of dificult, to not have one and be able to not think about it.

I think i'm faring pretty well though, i mean i haven't lashed out at anyone or reached for anything to throw...
I've just been pre-occupying myself with other things, like...well coking a cake for instance. I even went out especially to be ablt to have some ingriedients to decorate the bastard, and i haven't even tried it yet. <strike> I don't really like cake all that much...but cooking it isn't that bad.</strike>

And i'm spending a multitude of time on the computer. <small>which is seemingly, highly annoying to one brother of mine.</small>

In more somber news--->My nans younger brother just passed away, so i have a funeral to go to on Friday.I haven't spoken to her yet, but my mum has been staying with her and has said she is doing ok.

I have always hated funerals, it's not because i find them depressing or anything. <strike>'cos i mean, really isn't that expected of a funeral anyways? O.o</strike> I'm not really sure why i don't like them, i mean most people don't anyhoo, right?

I've only ever been to two funerals befor, my grandad * on my mum's side* and my nan *on my dads side*...I hated it, the preperation, everything. The worse thing was having to see my grandad in a half casket coffin...

My nan was cremated so that didn't seem so bad, but it does feel like she is just less reachable because of that. My grandad still hasn't spread her ashes, he wants to do it in England, where she came from...

Anyhoos, i have just noticed that i'm rambling <strike>as i do quite often</strike> and it's almost two and i havn't taken my medication, at this rate i'll not wake up till4 tomorrow afternoon. *<small>this stuff makes me pass out like <i>that</i></small>*

So i guess i'll say goodnight <strike> or morning if you want to be anal about it... O.o</strike>

I had almost finished my post too.

<strike>Damn this computer literate age!</strike>

So instead of re-writing the whole thing again here is a short re-cap of what i have been gettin up to--->

:I'm going to start the second part of my tafe course soon. 

:Oooo, I got me an RSA license, as did D' so we are both going to get jobs at the local liquer store near me, since my sister in-law is going to become store manager.

:We, as in Chayne, D' and I are going to go see The Shins in about a fortnight! *feints with eXciement*

:Also the other day We had to move D's brother's atuff down stairs into their mothers room and all of her stuff back up into his room...so eXhausting! But still it was kinda fun in a 'i never feel like doing that again' kinda way. :P

:I have to go to the specialist about my hands and back soon too. <small> 'cos i may have a form of childhood arthritis and I have a minimal scoliosis of the mid thoracic spine corvex...</small> <strike> I feel so old</strike> :(

:Also I have been suffering from these major migraines for about a month now <strike>at least</strike> These have to be the worse. Even with being pumped full of pain killers during the day and, what is meant to be, preventatives during the evening <strike> all have the tendency to knock me out like a log!</strike> I still have hardly any relief. They have been getting really bad again to this last week. O.o

:Speaking of being knocked out, the funniest thing ever! Since i have been on these medications and sleeping really heavily because of it, <small> I usually didn't sleep very well before taking these pills.</small> I have awoke three times doing weird things. I guess i'm still kinda asleep though when it happens, because i don't really remember it in the morning, just that i was really scared.

The first time I woke up screaming, then i woke up-sat straight up looking as though i had been trying to stab someone with a sword in one hand and holding up some kind of sheild with the other. The third time i just kind of spoke in my sleep. <small><small><small>well thats what i have been told i do anyways by D'</small></small></small> 

But yeah, i guess that's it.
since i can kinda use this now, i'm going to try to keep up-dating  whenever i can get to a computer for long enough. But for tonight this shall do, 'coz i can't remember what else i wrote before that little epoisode with the 'power' key. *twitches*

But today i was sitting at this assembly at school and this<br />guy and girl were holding hands and were so into eachother all i could think<br />about was Brian because that's how we were a few weeks ago. It sucks!&nbsp;<br />I like him so much but no one understands me...&nbsp;<br />I want to leave and get away from here as far as possible. I just feel like<br />I'm wearing a mask everytime im around someone...like i can't take that&nbsp;<br />mask off and no one really knows who the real person is...No one cares.<br />I don't know i'm so confused with life its unreal<br /></font></sup></strong></p>"

"event","So for some reason life doesn't seem to be getting much better
for me! So i was dating this guy for awhile...and we ended
up breaking up because he lives in Wickenberg and I live
in Phoenix..it's not that far only about 40-50 miles 
away. But he broke up with me cuz of distance relationship
but I think that he probably wanted to do some fooling around
with other girls..why else would he break up with you if it 
wasn't because of that. I don't know I like him so much...
We see eachother every Saturday so Its so hard not to have
feelings for him. He wants to be Friends with Benefits...
He said once he gets his car he thinks he'll ask me out again.
But I don't know if he likes me so much why hasn't he contacted 
me in two days..I going threw freaking WITHDRAWS! I'm not sure
what I should do..Anyone have any ideas? 
As far as good news...I'm excerising and losing weight so I can't 
wait till i see more results! So yeah I hope you all are doing good
Miss ya
Much love
Tiffers
SOON TO BE ACTRESS!"

"event","Well lately ive been in a good mood..it could be because i havent been at school for 3 days...
I just been pretty happy...i guess because the other day i cam across a sentence that makes
probably the most sense ive ever come across. because its true I read: EVERYDAY YOUR NOT SMILE
ITS A DAY WASTED. The quote makes so much sense i just had to smile. Because for the first time
in awhile i was with that quote. im so happy right now and i dont know why..theres nothing amazing
that's happened but im just so happy about my acting. Im finally motivated about something. Finally
i found my passion and no one can take it from me. ACTING. im going to be an actress...wither i have to
be poor until i make it...Im sorry ive decided im not moving to Tucson...ill visit as much as possible but
if i want to be an Actress i have to go to Hollywood! I mean i still have a whole year to think about it but 
i've never been more motivated to do anything and even if BJT have to split up we will find eachother later down the 
road! anyways just thought id share! 
ttyl
Soon to be Actress!"

Athough i was alone today at lunch, i wasn;t<BR>bummed out like i usually would be. Like normally i was always stressing about being alone I <BR>didn't like being alone. But today, it didn't bother me, Britt has her own life i have mine<BR>at lunch i sat in the hallway and did homework, and then catched up on some reading in my <BR>Acting book. I was finally independent for once.

Shes really fake so you can't really tell when shes being truthful and when shes being full<BR>of it.

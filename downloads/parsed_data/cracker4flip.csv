"event","The 2nd worst day of my entire life = October 26th, 2003 . . . the day my heart was crushed to smithereens :(((

The worst day of my entire life will be this Saturday, November 1st when my true love moves out :(  

I'm no longer a whole cracker, but a devastated and crushed bunch of cracker crumbs.  
  
Most of what follows will mean nothing to anyone except one, in which she understands it all :((( 
""The Kiss"" has dwindled, ""That Smile"" has faded.
The ""Mind's Wonder"" astray, The ""Sun"" has abated.
""Thanks Mom & Pop"" no longer the feeling,
""The Search"" has failed, ""Hunny I'm home"" no longer to be heard - brings me a kneeling.
To really falling down on the ice, it's not as nice by yourself.
No longer the ""MPP"" shivers my chin 
my worst fear comes true - let my ""Dream-Mare"" begin :((("

"event","My job isn't alot of fun!  I basically have to sit at a computer all day researching recruiting data (both $$$ and positions for people) and budget for them out to the year 2011 !!!  (kind of like a comptroller).  My job requires no need to interact or care about people :( . . . it's all about budgeting as few $$$$ and people as you can get away with. 

What I really like is teaching, working with people, coming up with ideas, being a leader or person in charge of a program or project . . . basically stuff that requires interaction with other people.  I'm soooooo not an individual worker and extremely dislike working in a ""vacuum"".

Hint - when people say ""location, location, location"" they mean where you live.  In your job, location is very important but so is your job satisfaction, and after 2 1/2 months here, I have ZERO job satisfaction."

"event","NAVY BALL - Our 2nd Navy Ball.  I was honored to take my Darlin' Berna to the Navy's Birthday Ball this past weekend (11Oct).  She, as always, look BEAUTIFUL!!!  We had a nice social hour before the dinner, got our ""official"" pictures taken, had a wonderful dinner (even though I didn't eat my crab stuffed chicken - haha but ate the filet), and danced.  We had fun and ended up going with 2 other couples to another local place.  It was a rotating club on top of a hotel, the ones that slowly rotate.  It was an awesome view (could see most of the Monuments, Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln, etc) although the music wasn't that good.  Even though, we still enjoyed ourselves and danced.  
Had a very cool/spontaneous trip home too!!"

"event","Trip to Tennesse:  I had to go to Millington, TN (right outside of Memphis on the west side of TN) for a 2-day meeting with the Recruiting Command.  I left Tuesday night for a Wed & Thur meeting and was suppose to fly back to DC Thur night, just before the Hurricane!  Wednesday's meeting was cool - learned all about how they do Navy Recruiting.  I had alot of senior people woo'ing me, mainly because I control all the $$$ they get for the annual budget.  Thursday's meeting was going to be all about how they do their advertising (Navy- Accelerate your Life! stuff).  BUUUTTTTT, after watching the Weather Channel & CNN on ISABEL's track, I decided it was better to cancel Thursday's meeting and go back to DC.  

Traveling back into the Hurricane:  I decided it was more important to go back home to DC before the Hurricane hit then stay in TN.  I wanted to ensure my Darlin' (and jewel) were going to be ok and in case anything happened, I'd be there to protect.  I had a flight back to DC Thur at 9am but they canceled all flights into DC that morning.  I thought I was going to be stuck in TN until Saturday but as I was walking down the terminal I saw a flight leaving in 1-hour to Philly.  Sooooooo, I got on the stand-by list and got on the flight - and flew First Class to Philly!!!  That was awesome too.  When I got to Philly, I just rented a car and drove to DC myself - it only took 3-hours but  it was worth it, I was back home in for ISABEL to hit.  And my Darlin' was happily surprised to see me come in the door!!!

And the ""Hurricane"" from my point of view was LAME!  Some wind, some rain but nothing major.  I guess it's because I've been 3 Hurricane's  {Hurricane Hugo in Charleston - - Hurricane Bob in Rhode Island - - and Hurricane Mitch ""the bitch"" at-sea in a Minesweeper off the west cost of Florida!).  But my Darlin' said the same thing, ""looks like a really good rain storm, at best"".  Anyway, Flip and I lost power at about mid-night (thursday night) for a little over 1-hour.  We had some wine, cheese & crackers and talked.  We were all happy the power was out - hahahaha, funny but true.  We went to sleep and woke Thursday morning to a beautiful sunny day.  We went out to check out the flooding in Old Town Alexandria, it was pretty cool with alot of businesses cleaning out there places.  I feel sorry for them, but they were lucky we didn't get hit much worse."

Football season is back!  My darlin' Flip and I went to the season kick-off for the NFL here in DC.  The NFL had a huge thing going on at the National Mall (where the monuments and parks are).  And on the opening kick-off night (Between Redskins & Jets) they through a huge FREE concert at the Nat'l Mall.  Aretha Franklin, Good Charlotte, Brittany Spears and AEROSMITH!!!  We were right next the end of the stage (where they walk out on).  Steven Tyler (and most of Aerosmith) came out on the end of this stage and played DREAM-ON.  They were like 10 ft away singing Dream-On !!!  It was simply AWESOME!

WORK - All settled into my new job (budget guy for recruiting & advertising) but still no idea what I'm doing, but hey - close enough for government work.  But really, getting a handle on my job and even moved into a better desk . . . which equates to being further away from the boss & more desk space.  Now I'm just putting cool things on the cubical walls.

WEEKEND - My Darlin (Flip4Cracker is you haven't realized by now) & I went to Atlantic City Saturday-n-Sunday.  Rainy drive all the way up, once we hit A.C., the sun broke out - yeaaa!  By the end of Saturday night, I was up $200 !!!  (some on slots - but mostly on craps & roulette) . .  even took a walk under the pier :).  But yes, we went back ""quickly"" on Sunday, which basically means I lost some of my winning.  I lost $100, but still left A.C. overall up $100, not bad and had fun watching my Darlin' play the slots.

STEELERS' BRADSHAW:  Terry Bradshaw (#12 of the Pittsburgh Steelers back in the Steelers' ""hay-days"" [1970's to early 1980's]) was at the Pentagon today for autographs!!!  Bradshaw is 1/2 owner of a NASCAR racing team (Casey Atwood is the driver of a Chevy, car is #14 Chevy).  The car is Navy Blue with gold letters saying ""NAVY"" and stuff lke like.  Well, because the NAVY is sponsoring Bradshaw's car (and by the way, I'm the budget guy for advertising which includes budgeting $$$ for Bradshaw's car - wooow, can you believe that!!??!!), Bradshaw & Atwood were at the Pentagon (in the center courtyard) to give free autographs.  I had him autograph my Steelers football (previously signed by Jack Ham too).  So now I have 2 sig's on the same football.  I also had my original NFL Authentic jersey (white Steelers jersey #12 with Bradshaw on the back) and had Terry Bradshaw sign it as well!!!  (He signed on the back, ""LT DAN, BEST WISHES, TERRY BRADSHAW #12"")  It was sooooo cool.  He is/was my football idol & I finally met him.  Now I'm never gonna wanna wear the jersey, guess I'll get it framed and stick it on the wall or sell it for $450 - hahahaha, hardly.

WELL, since in DC (actually a little before that but...) I've been back into beer (again, when I feel like drink).  My beer, and the only beer I drink now is Killian's Irish Red - It's awesome.  It's great irish beer . .  it's not ""piss"" beer (aka Miller), not ""raunchy"" beer (aka Heinken), not ""having to eat it with a fork-n-knife"" beer (aka Guiness) nor ""bandwagon"" beer (aka, you guessed it - Bud).

And NO, I won't have access to the $$$ so don't ask (hahahaha, hell I'd pocket a few dollars first anyway - j/k) . . . I'm just going to be budgeting for it.  Here's the funny thing, I don't have a personal budget of my own and I'm suppose to manage a budget of around $300 mil??? Hope I do't screw things up too bad.   

Well in short, the office is pretty cool.  I have an OK desk (cubicle actually) but it's right across from the ""boss"" and that is going to suck!!!  Need to organize the desk b/c it's a freakin mess right now, but it'll be cool.  I'll hang all my Steelers shit all over the place - yeaaaaaa!  The coolest thing is right next to my desk is a super comfy leather chair.  It's set-up so people can come by, sit in the comfy leather chair and talk with me.  I moved it in perfect position for this. I claimed the chair, may even take a nap in it from time to time.  I mean most Europeans and Spanish people take naps, we force lil children to take naps, I say ""why can't I!?!""  I'll see how it goes the first time, more to follow on that.

All the co-workers seem nice.  Overall had a very good first day at work.  Got the scoop on where everything is, although my head is still spinning.  3 other fellow ""LT's"" & I went to the Pentagon for my check-in.  They didn't have to go help me, just wanted out of the office for a while - hahaha.  Well, the Pentagon is a very cool place.  They have a huge strip mall inside (CVS/drug store, flowers, Dunkin Donuts, Barbers, mom & pop convenience stores, etc etc etc) hallways galore, we almost got lost too!  This place had it all!  And in the center of the Pentagon was a huge outside courtyard.  Benches, seats, grass, trees, etc.  Everyone walking around in uniform and regular clothes, very cool.  We ate lunch in the Pentagon courtyard at a Dominic's - had an awesome Chicken Philly to top off the day.  

Can't wait to see how things will be - new people, new environment, a shit load a responsibility.  But for now, my first day was a very nice one.   (thank you hunny! smooch)"

I got some stuff called ""Ka Pow"" and oh boy did it ever ""ka pow""!!!  That shit was hot as hell !!!  But so good I ate it all.  Then she walked around some while I got a drink at Sine's (pronounced Sha-Nay's) a cool Irish bar/restaurant.  I got my new favorite beer Killians Irish Red.

Washington DC Zoo - pretty nice.  My girl and I went on Tuesday and we had a pretty good time.  Seen most of the animals in 1/2 a day.  We were flying through that zoo - hahaha.  My favorite animal is the Otter - they bounce around, play and dive in the water, swim around each other, basically having a ball in the water.  Well, they did that and it was pretty cool watching them.  Seen a huge gorilla eating bark on a couple of sticks, and a big ole fat elephant taking a dip in the water.

"event","After getting more things organized around here and things have started to 'gel', Flip and I have ventured out to see what's around us.  We are able to hope the Metro-Bus (free for us 'cause of our rental agreement) and take it straight to the Pentagon where you can hop on any Metro-Bus and go most anywhere in the DC area!  Or you can hop on the Metro-rail (basically a very clean subway and everyone calls it the ""Metro"") and go basically anywhere also, just faster (but that will cost us some).  

Anyway, if we take the (Metro) Bus from within our community we can get off before the Pentagon at a Place called PENTAGON ROW (I call them the ""row homes"" - that oh by the way, rent for $2,000+/mo).  It the size of almost a huge city-block.  The ""Row Homes"" are on the 2nd floor and go up a few floors.  The whole first level (that's accessible to everyone) has a ton of stores (Harris Teeter food store, bed/bath/beyond, ton of cool restaurants (Lebanese, Thai, American, vegetarian, Irish) and a lot of little shops too for ice cream and stuff.  The center of this place is a gathering area with chairs and benches to people watch, sit n relax, etc.  So, sounds kinda funny to say ""LET'S GO DOWN TO THE ROW HOMES"" but it's a very nice place, and close!


Hooking up the Entertainment system!!!  Oh my God !!!  What a pain in the ass.  I finally got enough energy to try to hook up the entertainment system.  I had to hook up the TV, the Digital cable box, the Bose system, the VCR, and the PlayStation 2 !!!  I started on Monday morning and by the end of the day, I had a shit load of wires and plugs going everywhere and just a blue screen on the TV with no sound from anything !!!  I was not very happy with my inability to figure it out.  I was not a happy camper at all!  I ended up call a few entertainment stores for help but turns out they won't come out unless you bought the whole system from them.  

Well, with a little comforting, taking it very slow, really reading the directions, and wrapping up the wires as I hooked them up, I finally got it working!!!  Everything is hooked up and all sound comes from the Bose System, it's very very nice! 

So now I get to blast out our upstairs neighbors with our system - hahahaha!

The movers were great - packed slow, loaded everything carefully, and the delivery of our stuff was perfect!  It was an uneventful move with zero horror stories!  

MS MARTHA & PAULA did the packing for us, very nice ladies who wrapped everything and were soooo friendly.

The LOADERS (RONNIE - the leader of the misfits and the ""know it all"" in every topic of conversation;  ""1ST CUZ"" (First Cousin) who was likely the result of an incestuous upbringing, thus his nickname;  KENNY - the 24yo who smoked like a stack and drank beer every night kept talking about joining the Navy SEALS (uhhhh);  and finally the regular guy who was nothing but nice & smiling all the time (so what the hell was he up to I'll never know, hahahaha) so why the hell can't I remember his name! Oh well.  Although I'm calling them misfits I'm just making light of it and they were all nice people who loaded our stuff very carefully and all were very kind.

The DELIVERY of our stuff was done by ""BIG JOHN"" (a very tall n out of shape guy) and JAY (an old guy with 2 missing front teeth as he smiled all day).  Just the 2 of them to bring our stuff in the house and unpack everything!!  They were the best overall, nice n kind like the rest but the 2 of them did the work of 4-5 people.

Had 2 near catastrophic events (which turned out to be nothing):
1 - thinking our 'unique n eclectic' throw pillows for the couch were missing (but we found them in a small box),
2 - thinking Paula (who was a Steelers fan) took my 2 Steelers footballs (1 signed by Jack Ham & another given to me by all my co-workers after signing it (but we found these in a box packed in a different room, but who cares, they were packed).

Anyway, we're safe-n-sound in DC (Northern VA actually but it sounds sooooo much nicer to say DC, you know?)  Now starts the fun, figuring out where everything goes and filling up the Frig again.

We first went to Kings Dominion on July 3rd.  We got there a little late but it was ok.  It was drizzling but we were prepared.  We went on alot of roller-coasters.  The best one was a ride called ""Hyper""  It shot you from zero MPH to 100 MPH in less than 3 sec's....used a catapult like an Aircraft carrier.  Then you went straight up in the air vertical!!!  then back down vertically.  This was the best, but a cloe 2nd place was a ""Drop-Zone""...a ride that takes u about 350ft in the air, then you free fall most of the way down....thank God for the brakes!

The DC parade was prtty good.  We were going to volunteer for the parade but decided not to, but we got free T-shirts nevertheless.  The parade was good, alot of people coming up at the last few minutes trying to squeak in any crack or crevice.  The weirdest thing was their were 4 entries from Bolivian dances...ever time you looked, they were either just finished going past, or another Bolivian dance group getting ready to come up.  

The Fireworks were BEAUTIFUL!!!  We hung out a bit, walked around alot, sweated alot (hahaha) then finally parked our butts on the ground.  From where we were, the Washington Monument was right in front of us and the Fireworks were perfectly center on the monument.  It was an awesome location!  We both luv fireworks and the were awesome!  
But the whole National Mall n monument area was blocked off by the Secret Service and every single person had to go thru a security check and no alcohol was allowed in....that mellowed things out ALOT.  No biggy though, an overall very nice time.

Home now and only a few more days to prep for the movers to come get our stuff for the move to DC."

It was on the 2nd floor and the people next door we talking VERY loud with the TV loud.  Not sure if they were really loud are the door was that thin, either way we were not staying in that room!  Ended up getting a much nice room on the first floor that was very quiet!!!  Thank goodness for peace and quiet.

Jazz & Blues Festival @ WolfTrap.  We went to a Jazz/Blues festival at this park for performing arts here in Tysons Corner.  We went for 1 reason only - to see BIG BAD VOODOO DADDY !!!  It was on the Meadow Pavilion and these guys were AWESOME!!!  They music like the ""Big band / Swing"" stuff - but it's all jazzed up and modern.  Alot of horns, big bass, etc.  They put on a very good show, great music, alot of people swing dancing in front of them, etc etc etc.  A simply awesome show!

I also picked up a very cool and unique hat!  Finally got a cool hat to wear (something other than a baseball style hat).

I thought ""this asshole's drunk"" - and she was a chick no less (She was one of those strung-out 45-50yo's that lived life waaaaay tooo hard, dressed waaaay too young for her age, and was zoning out as she drove - she was definitely drunk or on drugs.  I followed her, called 911 to report it and stayed on the cell with them until this strung out lady stopped at a grocery store.  Cop cars & cycles came a few moments later and waited for her to get back into her sport-ute.  The cops followed her after she left the store and ended up pulling her over.  It took me a few minutes to find them - they lost me when they took off really fast after her.   

'DA RESULT OF MY EFFORTS???   About 3 cop cars and 2 cycle cops pulled her over in an alley-way and after about 20-30 minutes of testing and stuff, ended up cuffing and putting her in the back seat (ARRESTED - in the clink you go you drunk driving bonehead- oh yea!)

Note - this is my 3rd DUI person I seen on the road and made sure the cops got their stupid asses before they killed someone on the highways."

"event","HAIL & FAREWELL:  I'm leaving my work at the end of the month and as traditions go, my work has a HAIL (a welcome for the new people coming in) and a FAREWELL (a 'see ya later' for the people getting ready to transfer).  There were 2 new people coming in, and I was the only person getting a FAREWELL.  About 35 people turned out for my Farewell (the most for any farewell at this work).  We went to a Mexican place, food was pretty good.  Then we all went out on the patio and had everyone welcomed the new guys and said bye to me....People get a chance to say anything they want about me (no one really said anything funny, crazy, whatever), then they all gave me my going away gifts!!!
I got a standard plaque with stuff on it and on the bottom it said ""LT Dan"" (it was very cool).  
I also got the first Plankowner certificate of our command (Leadership Command) - I'll write later about what a ""Plankowner"" means.
Last thing I got (which was a total surprise) was a Steelers football with everyone signing it and writing stuff on it like take care, get outta here, good luck, etc - hahahha.  I was sooooo honored about this!  Alot of people at work chipped in a bought the football out of their pockets!  They didn't have to do this, they just wanted give me something more than just a plaque (most people only get a plaque so again I feel sooooo honored).  I am lucky to have nice co-workers like that.  I'm going to miss most of them when I go to Washington DC :(((

Then after all the gifts, I get a chance to say a few words.  Hahahaha and I gave them a reading from a book I've been keeping (a ""Hard Saying"" Log).  It's a book with all the memorable things that were said since I've been there - alot of funny shit was said and done I I wrote done alot of them - This got a ton of laughs.  And as I always do for my farewell - I wrote a ""Top 10 List"" on things I'll miss about this command . . . It was mostly VERY politically incorrect and sarcastic but in a funny way, and those that know me knew that so it was ok.  Anyway, this got a tons of laughs too.  

Overall - it was a very nice lunch to see me off and I again was sooooooooo honored that all those people turned out for me and chipped in to get me a going away gift from their hearts - Thanks guys - gonna miss ya....

LT Dan, over and out!
(more to follow when my fingers get a rest)

HAPPY FATHER'S DAY to all the Father's out there - you are blessed with a gift from God - never forget this!"

"event","I really enjoy getting my haircut.  It's relaxing, peaceful, and for some reason, makes me feel rejuvenated!  As I wait, I flip through a newspaper and/or some magazines laying around (usually a sports, car, or fishing/hunting mag).  I always wait for my favorite barber Manny  (a Filipino who's real name is Ben but he looks like a Manny, so he's ""Manny"").  I always have him cut my hair 'cause he cuts it the way I want it cut and does it the same way, every time without asking me.  He remembers me and just starts buzzing/cutting/etc.  Most guys like their haircut this way, nothing new or creative - just the samo samo.  Ladies generally like to get their hair changed in styles/colors/ect so it's different for them.

The last time I got my haircut by ""Manny"", this guy came in saying he had a hair cut about 4 months earlier (He was a Merchant Marine - a civilian who goes to sea on commercial ships delivering stuff like cars, oil, etc).  Anyway, he wasn't looking for a haircut but was looking for the lady that cut his hair the last time.  Turns out when he was getting his hair cut from her, she noticed an unusual bump on his head.  She told him he should really get ""it"" checked out.  He did & it turned out to be MALIGNANT  (a small cancerous bump!!!)  He was came back in to thank her but she wasn't there :(((   Anyway, he left her a note and a check in a sealed envelope.

So what do you leave for someone who saved your life?!?!  My God - was it a quick note saying thanks attached to a $20 check or a check for $1,000, or maybe his life savings???  (we'll never know).

WHAT WOULD YOU DO / HOW MUCH MONEY WOULD YOU GIVE, IF ANY?

>>> I think I would give my life savings, period.  At least I would hope I would.  If it weren't for her, he could be dead!  
ANYWAY, THIS GUY GOT ONE HELL OF A LIFE SAVING HAIRCUT!!!"

He's a very cool and awesome guitarist (latin/salsa/etc music).  He mainly plays down in South Miami Beach or Ft Lauderdale, but visits DC at times.  Flip & I have seen him in S. Miami Beach (our first time) and in DC too.  He plays his own music and jumps around while playing, and she just dances around, but mostly just shakes her ass while throwing her arms in the air (like a salsa dancer would).

The AWESOME - My lasagna - hahahaha.  I made a simply Awesome lasagna dinner last night for my love!  I worked kinda hard in getting it all ready:  Lasagna (duhh), garlic bread, a nice leafy salad, a very old bottle of wine I had from Germany, topped off with candles . . . Anyway, the Lasagna turned out sweet!  Actually the best I've ever had, really!  OK, I'm done bragging, just never made any food that I can brag about.

The TERRIBLE - My cat I used to have (that now lives with the ""X"") is doing terrible!!!  His name is Muggsy.  I got a call from her today saying he's been in the Vet since Monday.  They don't know what's wrong with him . . . he's lost a lot of weight, won't eat anything, and having trouble breathing and he's wheezing.  I went to go see him today - he doesn't look good at all.  Usually when he sees me, he comes right over to me, remembers me instantly!  I mean he was my cat for like 11 years!!!  It's been 2 years since he went with the ""X"" but he should remember me but he doesn't. :(((  (We'd have this thing where I could just grab his back a certain way and he'd fall over for me and play n wrestle n bite my hands and arms . . . Or I'd scratch the top of his butt [where his tail meets his back] and his back legs would tippy-toe and then he'd start playing n nibbling at my hand).  
But now, he just lays there.  He's wheezing loudly, just lays on his elbows n back legs, wheezing, not moving or wagging his tail at all and just hangs his head low.  She'll probably put him to sleep :((( I'm pretty sad - he was such a good and cool cat!!!   
Bye Muggers

  Friday night - we went and seen ""Bruce Almighty"" - Hilarious movie!!!  Jim Carey was very funny.  I'd recommend seeing this movie in a heart beat.  Next movie to see it X2 . . . but guess I have to watch the first X-men movie.

  Saturday - I was honored to take my love to a very elegant ball.  It was a Surface Warrior Ball, a Navy ball for the Surface Warfare community (in other words, officers and others that are on Navy ships).  Most everyone there was in Dinner Dress White (short white jacket, blk bowtie, cumberbund, etc).  Some civilians were there in a Blk tie tux but WE looked waaaay better.  My love was stunning, a true princess!!!  She had her hair done beautifully with the prettiest gown.  I was soooo honored to have her as my date (salamat guapino). 

Sunday - went to church and met Flip's Mom's new ""friend"".  He is a Father in a church in Cali and visiting Moma Luci.  He is very funny, always joking and talks really fast.  I took them around town some and showed them the Navy base, downtown, and the beach area with a band playing and people walking everywhere - a very nice time!

"event","It's been 2-weeks since my last e-journal . . . and I've been going crazy wanting to update it but haven't been able to, so here goes:

  Flip & I were in DC for a little over 1-week.  We were looking for our new place up there.  We started checking out individual townhomes/condos but the realtor was a bonehead, so we switched to apartments.  Must have looked at 15 quality apt's and they all blurred together.  We were able to finalize the 15 apt's into a ""Top 5"" list.  After checking out the ""top 5"" we were going back and forth on 2 (Potomac Yards & Arlington Square).  Long story short, Flip was right (again) Avalon @ Arlington Square was the best!  

  We'll be moving into a very nice townhome (2br/2bath, garage, yada, yada, yada) in a very nice community!  You can walk around at night - in DC!  Wow!  Anyway, July 11th will be day #1 in our new home - can't wait!!!  

  Flip & I stayed with my cuz (Meagan) while in DC.  She lives in Arlington as well, and my Aunt Peggy/Uncle Bill live in McLean (that place is way out of our league - homes start @ 400k!).  Regardless, it was nice to see my Aunt/Uncle and visit/stay with my cuz.  Didn't really know her that well, but I and Flip know her better.  We'll probably hang out when we et up there.

  Also, we shot up to Philly to surprise my Mom on her birthday!  She pretended to be surprised but I know her - and she knew we were coming up - my Dad blew it (hahaha).  It was nice to see her and everyone.

  The 2-weeks, and this past Memorial Day Weekend, was very nice. We hit a Memorial Day BBQ at her Bro's friends parents' house (did I confuse you?)  Anyway, awesome food/beer and people all over.  It was pretty cool, except for the roasted pig laying on this table with a corn-cob in his mouth!  I'm glad I ate before going to see him or her.  

  Oh, on the way up to DC, the M-Benz got 34.8mpg !!!  VERY cool. 
  Anyway, that's enough for now . . . now it's back to work (yuck!!!)"

Concert Update:
  Kenny Wayne Shepard - awesome guitarist!  Plays without looking, behind his back, and all kind of Blues music - He's awesome!!!  If you like Blues, get his CD now! 
  Ted Nugent - Very cool stage set-up! Guns/camouflage stuff/etc.  He called his part of the tour ""Shock-n-Awe"" HAHAHAHA.  Best part was his ""KISS MY ASS"" song . . . ""Dixie Chicks, Michael Moore, Bruce Springston, Al Gore, Jessie Jackson, et al can Kiss My Ass""  At the end, he shot an arrow into a Saddam billboard that was across the stage.  Very cool

I think we'll just tape Survivor and go see the concert.  I mean, I don't really care about ZZ Top, they're good and all but not like I listen to them alot.  The main reason I bought the tickets was for Kenny Wayne Shepard!  He's a like 20 or something and his music sounds just like Stevie Ray Vaughn - exactly!  Kenny is probably the opening act, he's an ""up-n-comer"" and ZZ Top isn't.

Woman's stuff can be all pastel colors of cloth, soft leather, etc.  Then buy some of those lip chairs/couches you see around.  Their reading stuff can be magazines (cosmopolitian, people, etc) and the art'sies stuff.

It's how you show your true-self that matters and not cloud the ""sunny day"" with unkindness, non-understanding, and disrespectfullness.  
But of course none of this applies to a person who cuts you off on the road or sits at a traffic light when its green and doesn't GO - hahahaha - joke.
Until the next time - I'm Dan, and your not."

"event","Well, here goes . . . My day's & life's events posted on-line for all to see.  This is my first time using this Live-journal (or any journal for the most part) so I hope it's cool.

  Hmmmmm, what's first?  So much has happened in my life up to now, I don't know where to begin - so I won't try to (maybe I'll list a readers digest version of my life later, who knows).  You will, hopefully, get to know me by reading my e-journal faithfully.  I'll give out a really really nice christmas present to the person who reads it the most, so good luck :)

  Well, shouldn't make this a long first entry.  Short, sweet and to the point is best.  Best part of my week so far has been Easter Church service on Sun, Buying my new car (Mercedes-Benz C230-SC) on Mon, Picking up the M-Benz on Tue, No idea on Wed, Volunteering with my GF and her sis at a homeless shelter handing out food on Thur, and now doing this Live-journal thing today (Fri).  Anyway, that catches you up for this week - more to follow.  

  Parting thoughts - What the hell is a Tapioca? (as in Tapioca Pudding) I mean I know Rice is in Rice Pudding but what the hell are those little round pebble things in tapioca pudding.

Until I write again . . . I'm still Dan and your not."

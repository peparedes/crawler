"event","I have come to the realization that I'm no longer interested in hiding, concealing, minimizing or otherwise downplaying who I&nbsp;am, what I think, what makes me happy and what I&nbsp;want to write here. Needing to worry about who will read what and who is on what filter and if things will get twisted out of context or repeated to others or used maliciously against me are all stressful things that I&nbsp;have neither the time, patience or inclination to deal with. 

If you are removed, most likely it was not done with ill-will, malice or with intent to nurse a grudge, simply I am no longer interested in sharing dialogue with you in the private setting of my journal. 

I will not entertain or tolerate cross-posting replying comments or any portion of my journal to any social media/networking site (ex. Facebook, Twitter). Zero tolerance on this. 

Thanks.                        

The rest of you miscreants and vagabonds I've decided to keep around, much love to you &lt;3"

"event","okay!

so as a part of getting back into livejournal as a regular thing, i've kind of culled out friends and communities that truthfully i either no longer read or have realized that i gain nothing by continuing to subscribe to them. 

to that end, i'm looking for you, faithful friends, to recommend possible new communities and friends to add!

i generally enjoy a lot of photo-heavy communities, most anything with animals, various cooking and baking things, random eclectic or silly things, animal macros, some design stuff, photography in general, and ummm, yeah! i enjoy SOME&nbsp;drama/snark/commentary-type communities, but will no longer have anything to do with WoW or pet comms, because holy shit, boring!"

"event","Pretty much without fail, every single person who tastes this stuffing declares it absolutely delicious, and it's an absolute staple at Thanksgiving and Christmas.&nbsp; Other dishes change, are added and abandoned, but this stuffing has been a family institution since my dad was a little kid. It's not hard to make, or even that precise, but it's fucking delicious, and you should try it. <br /><br />Itsyspy70's Family Stuffing<br /><br />1 1lb package of regular sausage<br />1 1lb package of &quot;hot&quot; variety sausage<br />3 cups of butter<br />1 yellow onion, chopped decently small<br />1 bunch celery, cleaned and chopped, leaves included<br />1 cup golden raisins<br />1 cup regular raisins<br />3 12oz boxes of seasoned dressing (not cornbread dressing)<br />6 cups chicken broth (one 49.5oz giant can is 6 cups)<br /><br />Equipment<br />Small saucepan<br />Wide and deep frying pan/saute pan<br />Giant mixing receptacle (we use a gigantic stock pot usually, but a very large bowl works too)<br />17x12x3 inch pan. You can use a glass or metal baking pan, but it's honestly loads easier to get the foil kind you can toss in the trash, less cleanup and you don't have to worry about leaving dishes at other people's houses if you take some to a party. <br />Slotted spoon<br />Sturdy paddle-type wooden spoon<br /><br /><br />Directions<br />On medium-high heat, crumble and brown both packages of sausage stirring occasionally. When sausage is sufficiently browned and delicious smelling, dump the sausage into your giant mixing container. Do not drain or dispose of the grease. Turn the heat down to medium, and add the 3 cups of butter, add the celery and onion. Cook the celery and onion until the celery is just starting to lose some of it's crunch, the butter should be totally melted. As the onion and celery is cooking, have a saucepan filled with boiling water. When the water is boiling, add both types of raisins. When the onion and celery are done, pour the entire contents of the fry pan into your mixing receptacle, drain the raisins and add those to the mix. Add all of the dressing to the mixing container, and then add the chicken broth. Grab your heavy duty mixing spoon, and mix everything well. When it's all evenly mixed, schlep the whole shebang into your big pan. Cover with foil. You can keep the pan covered in the fridge for a day or so to make Thanksgiving prep easier. <br /><br />When ready to bake, preheat your oven to 350F. When oven is hot, put the still covered pan in the middle of the oven. Cook for 25 minutes. Remove the foil, cook 5 more minutes. Enjoy!<br /><br /><br />* I realize brand names can vary in different parts of the country, but for the record, we use Jimmy Dean sausage, Mrs. Cubbison's Seasoned Dressing. Raisins and chicken broth brands don't really matter. <img border=""0"" alt=""Smiley"" src=""http://www.thepenitent.com/forums/Smileys/default/smiley.gif"" />"

Works great. <br />**** Screw tomato sauce, Prego is where it's at. I suppose you can do the actual recipe, but it's easier to just dump the jar, and it's tasty. <br /><br /><b>Directions<br /></b>In a large bowl, combine milk and bread crumbs.

Pour tomato sauce into pan; bring to simmer over medium-high heat. Add meatballs, reduce heat to medium-low, cover and simmer until cooked through, 30 minutes. Uncover, cook 10 minutes more. Serve over pasta with cheese. Serves 10-12. <br /><br /><b>THE VERDICT!</b><br /><br />WOMG tasty, easy, definite do-again. If you like meatballs, and if you like cheese, you will like this. Promise! I did take pictures, but I forgot to take a picture of the molten cheese core* of the meatballs, and I think it came out blurry anyways.<br /><br /><br />*And no, this is not some sort of uber-dorky WoW reference, thankyouverymuch."

When the liquid boils, add the raisins and couscous. Take the pan off the heat. Stir the couscous and place the lid on the pot. Let it stand. <br /><br />Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat and add the EVOO. Add the chicken in a single layer and season it with salt and pepper. While the chicken browns on all sides, trim the tough tops and the root ends off the leeks. <br /><br />Cut the leeks in half lengthwise, then cut them into 1-inch half moons. Place the leeks in a colander and run them under cold water. Separate the layers to release the dirt and grit. Rinse well, then drain well. <br /><br />Add the leeks to the chicken and wilt, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the wine and let it cook down by half, 3 to 4 minutes. The leeks should still have some color but should be tender and the chicken should be cooked through. Add the remaining tablespoon of butter and swirl into the sauce. <br /><br />Fluff the couscous with a fork and stir in the parsley.

Add the sliced chorizo and cook, stirring frequently, for 2 minutes. Add the potatoes, and continue to cook for another 2 minutes. Add the onions, carrots and garlic, season with the salt and pepper and cook, stirring frequently for 5 minutes. Add the white wine and cook for 3 minutes. Add the tomatoes, chicken stock and roasted red peppers, bring up to a simmer and cook for 5 minutes. You want the soup to be at a gentle simmer before you add the fish, so if necessary, turn the heat down a little. Add the cod. Gently simmer for 3 to 4 minutes, or until the fish is cooked through. Finish the soup with parsley, taste for seasoning and serve. <i>(I'm probably going to get a nice crusty/chewy loaf of bread to serve with this, and maybe I'll do some veggies as well)<br /><br /><b>Notes</b><br /><br />- I forgot to get the crusty bread, and didn't do the veggies. Oops. <br />- It ended up being pretty spicy, to tone down the spiciness you could sub in andouille sausage for the chorizo, and use some red pepper flakes instead of the chopped chili pepper<br />- This was insanely easy. Chop stuff, drop in pot, let simmer. It wasn't very fishy tasting or smelling at all, and was nice and not too heavy, perfect to counterbalance heavy holiday meals. I'm pretty sure this would also do well in a crock-pot or simmering on a stove all afternoon, and it made the kitchen smell awesome.<br />- VERY TASTY, definite do-again, though perhaps with the less-spicy modifications. We decided we liked the sweet potato stoup best though. <br />- We took some photos, but I am too much of a lazyass/tired (ha ha, remember how I was up at 5?) to upload them right now. <br /></i></div>"

"event","Recipe time again! This is really easy, really tasty, and great with a nice crusty hunk of bread. We'll be making this one again, no doubt about it. <br /><br />Makes 4 servings<br /><br />2 tbsp. EVOO<br />2 medium carrots, peeled, halved lengthwise, sliced into half moons<br />2 celery ribs, sliced thinly<br />1 large onion, peeled and halved, sliced thinly<br />1 large sweet potato<br />2 garlic cloves, chopped<br />1 chipotle chili in adobo, finely chopped<br />salt and black pepper to taste<br />1/2 teaspoon thyme<br />1 bay leaf<br />1 cup dry white wine<br />1 quart plus 1 cup chicken stock<br />1 package chicken tenders, cut into bite-sized pieces<br />4 scallions, thinly sliced<br />1/4 cup fresh cilantro leaves, coarsely chopped<br />1/2 cup sour cream, for garnish (optional)<br /><br />Heat a soup pot over medium-high heat with the EVOO. While the oil heats, cut the carrots in half lengthwise, then slice into thin half moons. Add the carrots to the pot, stirring to coat the carrots in the oil. Chop and drop in the celery and onion, chopping them as small as you can, but don't make yourself crazy <i>(Note: the book actually did say that, I'm not just adding stuff in).</i><br /><br />Peel and then cut the sweet potato into quarters lengthwise, then thinly slice them into bite-sized pieces. Add the sweet potatoes, garlic and chipotle and stir to combine. Season the veggies with salt and pepper, the thyme and the bay leaf. Cook the veggies together for one minute. Add the wine to the vegetables and reduce for a minute. Add the stock to the pot, cover the pot and raise the heat to high. <br /><br />When the stoup boils, remove the cover and simmer over low heat for 10 minutes. Add the cut-up chicken and simmer for 5 minutes, or until the sweet potatoes are tender and the chicken is cooked through. Turn th eheat off, discard the bay leaf, and stir in the scallions and cilantro. Serve each portion of stoup with a dollop of sour cream on top. <br /><br /><i>Notes: John didn't think this was all that spicy, but I think I'd leave the chipotle pepper out next time, he can spice up his own bowl. We got a crusty mini-loaf of garlic bread, heated it in the oven (350F for 10 minutes) and served the soup in oversized mugs with hunks of the bread for mopping up. The soup is hella flavorful, and the sweet potatoes are an awesome variation on the regular potatoes. And in case you're wondering what the heck &quot;stoup&quot; is, it's Miss Ray's term for a stew-like soup. </i>"

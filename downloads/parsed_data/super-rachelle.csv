"event","Well, I'm never on here, but I thought I would make a post because I have nothing else to do.

School is almost out, and I'm kinda sad about it actaully. I won't get to see the kid I like that much - or any of my friends for that matter, almost all summer because of UB. Idk, I'll get to see some of my friends there, such as my best friend and everyone that has become or will bcome my friend. Who knows.

So, this kid I like, his name is Aaron. He finally told me that he liked me too, but some stuff in his life is messed up, and he had been hurt a lot in previous relationships, so he doesn't want a girlfriend right now. But, the last thing I want to do is hurt him. Actually, I never want to hurt him, but Idk, I can wait.

My best friend and I have to go to a UB thing this weekend. After that, we're applying for jobs at a movie theater, then I think we have to go back to UB. We're gonna have fun.

I need to start calling around so that I can take driving lessons. I've been kinda lazy for the past 3 months and I'm not doing anything but school work. So, I guess I might just take lessons over the summer and all that great stuff. I'll have all of that done soon enough.

I think that's all I have to say for now, not that anyone reads these anyways, but it was nice to talk about it.

Untill next time,
Super Rachelle"

"event","Today was the second day of exams, and I only  had one! Which was choir, super easy if you ask me. Not sure why a bunch of people exempted though, it was an easy A. I only missed two. Go me! I think it might have been on the adding the notes together part. Oh well.  
  I exempted Latin II and Geometry, since I have A's. I'm so glad that I'm going better this year. My freshman year I used to goof off and not do my work, this year I'm not failing anything and I'm sure I have nothing lower than a C. I think the C might be in Bio, man I need to start studying for his tests more often.
  Tomorrow is that last day of exams (For me at least, because of the delay, the people who had 1st period exams have to make them on Friday)! Rachel and I are going to hang out during 4th period exams and go somewhere, since neither of us have anything to do. It'll be fun. We don't get to hang out much anymore since this school year started. All I can do is walk her to lunch, but I guess that's better than nothing.
  I have to baby-sit my cousins this weekend. I love Abigail, I call her my child all the time. She's so cute. But, her sister will be there to help me so, no worries. AND on top of that, I get paid. wOOt wOOt, maybe I can go to the show this weekend after all.... if my aun gets back in time that is.
  Well, I need to go study for my exams. I definately need to pass Bio and U.S. Studies. I will update this some other time. Later kids.

Always,
Super_Rachelle"

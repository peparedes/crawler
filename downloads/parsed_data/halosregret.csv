Dogs Being Walked Seized From Their Owners and Beaten to Death on the Spot
By CHRISTOPHER BODEEN, AP

SHANGHAI, China (Aug. 2) - China slaughtered 50,000 dogs in a government-ordered crackdown after three people died of rabies, sparking unusually pointed criticism in state media Tuesday and an outcry from animal rights activists.  

Health experts said the brutal policy pointed to deep weaknesses in the health care infrastructure in China, where only 3 percent of dogs are vaccinated against rabies and more than 2,000 people die of the disease each year.  
The five-day slaughter in Mouding county in Yunnan province in southwestern China ended Sunday and spared only military guard dogs and police canine units, state media reported.  

Dogs being walked were seized from their owners and beaten to death on the spot, the Shanghai Daily newspaper reported. Led by the county police chief, killing teams entered villages at night creating noise to get dogs barking, then beat the animals to death, the reports said.  

Owners were offered 63 cents per animal to kill their own dogs before the teams were sent in, they said.  

The killings were widely discussed on the Internet, with both legal scholars and animal rights activists criticizing them as crude and cold-blooded. The World Health Organization said more emphasis needed to be placed on rabies prevention.  

The official newspaper Legal Daily blasted the killings as an ""extraordinarily crude, cold-blooded and lazy way for the government to deal with epidemic disease.""  

""Wiping out the dogs shows these government officials didn't do their jobs right in protecting people from rabies in the first place,"" the newspaper, published by the central government's Politics and Law Committee, said in an editorial in its online edition.  

In an editorial, the official Xinhua News Agency said the killings wouldn't have been necessary if the local government had been more attentive, but called the slaughter ""the only way out of a bad situation.""  

""If they'd discovered this earlier, they could have vaccinated the dogs and ... controlled the outbreak,"" the editorial said.  
The killings prompted calls for a boycott of Chinese products from the activist group People For the Ethical Treatment of Animals.  

""We are urging everyone to actively boycott - not a word we use lightly - anything from China given the bludgeoning killing of thousands of dogs,"" PETA President Ingrid Newkirk said.  

She said the group had canceled all orders of merchandise it sells that are made in China. Will Wright, at PETA's European office in London, said the orders were worth about $300,000.  

""We believe other groups will join us in expressing outrage over the blatant cruelty to animals the world is witnessing,"" Wright said.  

Mouding County officials defended the slaughter in a region where about 360 of the 200,000 residents suffered dog bites this year, with three people reportedly dying of rabies, including a 4-year-old girl.  

""With the aim to keep this horrible disease from people, we decided to kill the dogs,"" Li Haibo, a spokesman for the county government, was quoted as saying by Xinhua.  

Calls to county government offices went unanswered Tuesday. Located in mountains about 1,240 miles southwest of Shanghai, Mouding is famed for its Buddhist shrines.  

Unlike in the West, where dogs have long been cherished as companions or helpmates, dogs have rarely had an easy time in China. Dog meat is eaten throughout the country, revered as a tonic in winter and a restorer of virility in men.  

Following the communist seizure of power in 1949, dog ownership was condemned as a bourgeois affectation and canines were hunted as pests. Attitudes have softened in recent years, although urban Chinese are still subject to strict rules on the size of their pets and must pay steep registration fees.  

About 70 percent of rural households now keep dogs, according to the Chinese Center of Disease Control and Prevention, and increased rates of dog ownership have been tied to a surge in the number of rabies cases in recent years. It said there were 2,651 reported deaths from the disease in 2004, the last year for which data was available.  

Access to rabies treatment is also highly limited, especially in the countryside, said Dr. Francette Dusan, a World Health Organization expert.  

Effective rabies control requires coordinated efforts between human health, animal health and municipal agencies and authorities, Dusan said.  

""This has not been pursued adequately to date in China, with most control efforts consisting of purely reactive dog culls,"" she said.

going to try to stop by my parents' today while out in lancaster to look at a new bike my dad has b/c mine is dying a quick death with all the riding i've been doing the past few days since taking my car off the road.  hell, the damn thing will probably die today on me and i'll have to beg a ride home from someone. haha  ahhh the biking.... while it takes me longer to get places i feel better, am getting exercise, and having fun.  between the riding and all the dancing i'm just gonna be one toned and lean girl in no time. (great just what i need stronger legs, as if dancing hadn't made my legs uber-strong as it is) haha

okay i so didn't have the time to do this and now i'm gonna be late. aaaahhhhh!!! good thing i found someone to watch the pets (sitting business) next week while going to my aunts and while cramming my 40 hours into a few days.  christ.  this just sucks. next week is gonna be hell."

"event","all i want to do right now is go to concerts/shows (some bands are too ""small"" to have ""concerts"", just shows lol) and be at home. 

anyway, all my money now belongs to the following people: tori, the dolls, rasputina, and, of course, trent and lets not forget all the money being siphoned out of me by the 38,000 people who's weddings i have to go to this fall, both in state and out, oh and those ""friends"" who are having kids which are due this fall.  stupid people and their happily ever afters with the marriage and the kids messing with my time and money.  grrr.... ;)   

anyway, this fall should have me ridiculously busy what with the classes, dancing, pet sitting, shows/concerts, weddings, baby things, traveling, and whatever else is going to be thrown at me on a daily/weekly basis.  well, at least being that busy will make me forget how miserable i am/can be ;)  it's gonna be a fun autumn.  

gotta go to registration at dancing now.  yay, its fun being screeched at by youngin's and their parents who are ""so glad to see you!! how was your summer!!! i miss your purple hair are you going to dye it back again?  you're dancing right?""  ::shudder:: lol  gotta go.



this entry was utterly pointless. lol  wait, so are all of my entries (which is why i don't update often) hehe"

"event","We are home from Wantagh.  The show was basically perfect.  I always forget what an amazing voice Tori has until I see her live.  The mood was totally set as well: perfect clear sky, nearly full moon shining over head, gentle breeze blowing in from the ocean.  aaaahhh... it was so relaxing and beautiful.  

Other than the concert the whole in Long Island/Wantagh blew.  I always forget how much I hate NYC and all that surrounds it. I get grumpy and uber-complainie (yes, i know that isn't a word, but it is now cause i said so).  First, when we finally got to the correct area of the island we couldn't find anywhere to grab some lunch. So, I thought hey, if we can find a health food store, they might have 1)some food or 2) know of a place where 2 vegans can grab some grub.  Wel, we found 2 ""health food"" stores. hehehe  The first was being operated by a very large and sweaty, stereotypical long island italian man.  The store was dark, very very tiny, and pretty dirty.  Along the shelves were tons of chips and cheese crackers, a meger selection of vitamins, and some breakfast bars.  I asked him if he knew where we could find some food, even though I knew I was wasting my breath.  Sure enough, his eyes kinda glazed over as he looked at me and said ""Zen Garden over on... ummmm... somewhere on ummm... Well, they might have some vegetables over at the Zen Garden on ummm....."" Yeah, dude. Got it ummmm... you have no idea.  We left there to go to another one.  This one looked hopeful.  It was a little bigger well lit and as soon as I walked in I was faced with a whole wall of supplements, no food even though the sign outside said ""HEALTH FOOD!!"" (just like that too all caps and everything haha). I asked the lady behind the counter where a vegan/vegetarian friendly resturant was and she told me the few that were around had closed and there had in fact been another lady in earlier who had inquired about the same thing.  Then she proceeded to tell me the pizza place next door could make me a cheese pizza with nothing on it.  I told her again, that I was vegan and didn't eat animal products of any kind.  She looked confused and said ""you don't eat cheese? What do you eat? That can't be very healthy can it?"" I bid her farewell and left.  We ended up finding some hummus and pita bread at a grocery store on Wantagh Ave (its just fun to type Wantagh, don't ask).  It was really a quite entertaining trip.  

Now I want to go to the beach, like Clearwater in Florida or something.  I just want to spend some time relaxing on a cabana looking out at the ocean.  ::sigh:: stupid poorness."

"event","okay, i had plans for an entry last night prior to watching a movie but since then, due to my amazing memory lately, i have completely forgotton what it was i wanted to write for the online world to read.  oh well.  must not have been very important. HAHA like anything i friggen write in here is important. so, watched the movie <i>wonderland</i>. it was very good.  the special features include the actual LAPD crime scene video. holy fuck! that is all that is needed to be said.  they weren't fucking kidding when they said that the wonderland murders were as gruesome as the tate murders. 

so, i have had some weird stomach plague the past few days.  not fun.  i think i might be better now. a little skittish though.  i am so fucking tired of stomach problems.  stupid body.

so, bliss downloaded the movie haute tension and has been trying to burn it to dvd.  this has been going on for a week and something is always wrong with the dvd she makes; either there is subtitles lacking sound, or sound lacking subtitles, or sound lacking picture, or everything but won't play on dvd player in bedroom (meaning only will play on the comp). so this is very very irritating to her but it is kinda funny for me. let me explain why. she says i obsess way to much about a variety of things, but i have never obsessed for over a week about something on the computer. hehehehe so, this is funny watching her go to the computer and mess around with this stupid movie for hours. NOW who's obsessed bliss? huh? huh? huh? huh? huh? yeah, that's what i thought you said. ;) hehehe

so, syd, i hear you want to come down. correct? when? call your sis or be online tonight so you 2 can chat about it.  

oh yeah, its the 4th of july! i forgot.  yay, fireworks tonight! i love me some fireworks. haha

wonka in 11 days!! woo hoo!"

okay... what dates are you thinking (sara, bliss, anyone)?? any dates we don't go to are the dates where <i>and all that could have been</i> will be played.  of course ;) hehe

i would looooove to do the whole west coast thing.  i'm thinking about how we could work that out. i have always wanted to drive up the west coast into canada and everything. that would just be an amazing trip. actually, it always played out in my mind as driving cross country to san diego and then up the coast to vancouver then taking the 1 all the way across canada to get home. nin optional. lol  someday. hehe

<b>edit</b> hey bliss?! if we go to san diego on sept 14 we can see tori and then on the 16th see trent! hehe"

i like my new job alot. i am actually not miserable going, or coming home from there.  wow!! shocker! lol  i am writing like a reject right now.  good lord. you'd never think that i am actually quite edumacted with the entries i have been coming up with lately. go figure. 

so, tori is going to be in toronto in august. fun should be had by all.  so, lets see... tori in long island on the 17th of august, then in toronto on the 27th (?) and then trent in (enter city), (enter city), (enter city), (enter city), (enter city), (enter city), (enter city), (enter city), (enter city) and in (enter city) throughout the fall.  interesting. i have no life.  

god, jennifer's horrific wedding is in october.  i really need someone to go with me.  preferably a guy with tats and/or piercings, cool hair (ie mohawk, etc), not afraid to wear make up, who likes to scare people, not afraid to be the center of attention (cause we will be. lol)  any ideas? anyone? lol  god, that would so teach jenn.  i'm going to be my ""normal"" weird self at the wedding anyway and that will freak her out (as normal) but having another fellow freak along for the ride would be totally enjoyable (just to see her face).  ::sigh:: 

okay, this movie (leolo??) bliss is watching sounds interesting. i should go check it out. nite all.

sorry about the horrific grammar in this entry.  yikes."

"event","okay, the psych center wasn't burned down. sara and i went there on the way to cleveland yesterday to see what the damage was and it turned out to only be what is known as the nurses quarters (even though it wasn't a nurses quarters).  i spoke to a security guard who said that the news grossly misrepresented the fire.  thank goodness.  ::big sigh of relief::

so went to see orgy with sara. great show. very hot. had lots of fun. went to the rock n roll hall of fame... awesome! they were having a Tommy exhibit!!  excited!!  woo hoo (i'm such a dork) found out that mudvayne is playing in cleveland on august 3rd so i went to check on tix this morning (have to go see mudvayne!!) and saw that there were now also dates for a show in toronto!!! yeah!!! that show is on wednesday july 30. soooo, excited!  might just go to cleveland too...wait $25 tix, maybe not. lol

"event","weirdest dream...

sara and i went somewhere (some random city to see a band and it wasn't nin). well, we are in a parking lot (come to think of it the scenery looked very countryside british) of some building and we see a van parked by the curb and then we see aaron come out of the building and head toward the van. we immediately start running to the van. sara jumps to the side door and says ""do you want me to give you a manicure?"" and the guys say no thanks but trent says ""no thanks. i'll give you a bite of my sandwich though"" and he hands it out to sara (who takes a giant bite) and then hands it out to me and i see that it is a veggie burger (amy's style, neat), i take a small tooth scraping ""bite"" of the bread and we get in the van.  the driver takes off, the side door is open.  now, there are 2 people in the front (driver and some roadie), and 2 guys next to trent (trent in the middle) whom both look like roadies (b/c aaron somehow turned into a roadie. hehe).  i ask if i can close the door and trent grins and says ""only if you promise to open it back up again"". laughingly, i tell him i can't promise him that. then sara starts talking about monkey's to one of the roadies, and i start talking about motorcycles with one of the roadies.  (best line from the dream complements of sara ""i think monkey's are the most underrated people in the world. they have the nicest legs."") then trent went, ""oh no!"" we immediately turn around (leaving our roadie friends hi and dry regarding our scintillating conversations). trent grins, says nice to have met you both and then exploded into a million shards of glass piercing everyone in the eyes, face, neck, you name it.  the driver immediately tried to stop, but managed to crash us into a pole. when the cops came they looked at the scene and the trent shards and determined that we had committed a crime. we were all arrested for breaking a celebrity, which is punishable by death....

yikes. strangest fucking dream. so wish you could have seen it for yourselves.  yikes.  monkeys. hehehehehe"

jerome kissed brian (from dresden dolls) last night and it was so fucking hot.  (sara: ""Am I gonna need to hose you off?"" lol)

eastern state penn.  gorgeous. enough said.

i hate philly. a lot. but i have to go back to see the mummers museum b/c it will just be fantastic. then i will never have to go back to that hell again (until the next leg of the tour). hehe

there are exactly 2 fucking hotels in philly b/c the place sucks.  we had to drive around forever after the show on wednesday before we found any hotels which, of course, since there are only like 2 in philly, all of them were sold out. took a fucking year to find a place to sleep for the night.

oh, last thing (b/c i am so not going to do the whole obsessed fan show thing b/c i don't want to type that much hehehe. although sara and i will be touring in the fall with the band. where ever they go we will follow. hehe)  oh yeah, so one last thing....

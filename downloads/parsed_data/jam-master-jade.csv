"event","So. I've come to a decision. Davey and I are going to have a baby together. As friends. It was Davey's idea, and I was a little scared at first. But, after much thought, I've come to one conclusion..

I want to be a dad. And I want Davey to help.

We haven't even planted it in there and I'm pouring over baby name and pregnancy books.

Davey - IT SHALL <u>NOT</u> BE NAMED ERROL!

Anywho, I'm Jade, I'm hot, you aren't, you should love me.

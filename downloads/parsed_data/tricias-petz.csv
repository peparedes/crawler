"event","<p>I have a certain problem. I'm not going to specify what it is, but I'm going to tell you how I feel about it.&nbsp;<br /><br />I am very confused about my feelings on it. I seem to be totally&nbsp;for it&nbsp;one minute, and then completely against it the next. Whenever I think about it, I get this strange feeling... I don't even know how to describe it.&nbsp;<br />The worst thing is, I highly doubt this situation will amount to anything. I think it's all it my head, and that makes it even worse! I don't think it's mutual at all. It makes me feel quite ill to think that it is all me. Only me that is thinking this way. Could that honestly be true? How could it?<br /><br />I'm sure you've figured out what I'm talking about. I will not say a name, but I will keep on going. If the person who I'm talking about understands this, tell me. Tell me if you feel the same way.&nbsp;<br /><br />I wish it could be easier! I mean, really. Why can't stupid relationships be EASY? Is it true that if it doesn't seem easy, it isn't meant to be? Or is that all backwards?&nbsp;<br />I don't know ANYTHING on the subject. I feel like a fish out of water when I even think about the concept... that sounded really retarded, but it's true.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />But hey- what can I do about it, anyway?&nbsp;<br /><br />I'll shut up now. This is driving me crazy.</p>"

"event","<p>I just found this again- it's crazy to read how my life was 3 years ago!&nbsp;<br /><br />As an update-&nbsp;I'm now 15,&nbsp;I have a 9&nbsp;month old Black Lab mix- Cash, 5 cats- Blue, Kiara, Sasha, Astro and Bing, 1 guinea pig- Zephyr, 1 mouse-Pixie, 1 betta- Sebastian, and about 32 sheep.&nbsp;<br /><br />My life has changed quite a bit since 2005.&nbsp;I won't really elaborate on that, but I like&nbsp;to think that I am more mature and hopefully more responsible. One thing I&nbsp;know for sure is that&nbsp;some of the experiences I have had can only make me stronger.&nbsp;<br /><br />In 2006 I started *real* riding lessons. I LOVE it even more than I had expected! Miracle, the horse that I ride, is amazing, and I couldn't hope for a better instructor. I haven't ridden in a couple months now due to weather and other inconveniences, but I will be starting again soon.&nbsp;<br /><br />I've had my ups and downs, I admit. I know that my ""downs"" are more often than the ""ups""- but I am working on that.&nbsp;<br /><br />I'll be using this blog to publically express my feelings- so read, if you dare.&nbsp;<br /><br />See you all.&nbsp;I'll be posting veerrrrry often, I'm sure. <br /><br />Tricia </p>"

A girl died in 1933 by a homicidal murderer. He buried her in the ground when she was still alive. The murdered chanted, ""Toma sota balcu"" as he buried her. Now that you have read the chant, you will meet this little girl. In the middle of the night she will be on your ceiling. She will suffocate you like she was suffocated. If you post this, she will not bother you. Your kindness will be rewarded."

Apparently Khyber still wants to go Super Saiyan on me at MFM.  Well, fuck it. I'll fight him. I wouldn't have gone to his place dressed as a ninja if I wasn't willing to fight. Khyber, I hope you've reached SS level 3 by now, because you're going to need every bit of your Saiyan superstrength to defeat my dragon punch.

"event","Something really sad happened to me recently.  It occurred to me that I hadn't seen the old internet acronym ""nmh"" in years.  I have fond memories of asking a friend ""Hey!  What the fuck does 'nmh' mean?"" ""nmh"" stands for ""not much here"", and it's the perfect response to questions such as ""sup?"" and ""what's shakin?"".  But sadly nmh's usage waned in the early years of the new millenium and it now seems that the once popular acronym has gone the way of the dodo and the autogyro.  

Computer scientist Dr. Emmanuel Hirst had this to say about the nmh's disappearance from the world of internet lingo, ""If you want to really know what killed nmh, I'll tell you what it is,"" said Hirst, ""It's blogging communities.""

 ""Blogs made it impossible for fuckers to not know what's going on in their gay ass friends' shitty lives,"" explained Hirst, ""It made nmh completely obsolete."

"event","I went to go see a friend a couple days ago who apparently lives in a rather shitty part of town.  And by shitty I mean that most people in the area don't have electricity, so when it gets dark out they just start wandering the streets in packs.  Well, I knocked on the door of what I thought was his apartment and immediately heard a young African American angrily reply ""Who is it?""  Instead of leaving I asked for Wes, to which the person living in the apartment replied ""What the fuck?  Aint no mother fucker like that livin here.""  I hear some shuffling around inside the apartment and a clicking noise.  The guy asked who I was, I told him I had the wrong apartment and left.  He probably thought I was a cop or something and I'm guessing that was a gun I heard.  

Later I found my friend's apartment and lo and behold him and his girlfriend are the only crackers in the complex.  I bet his rent is cheap as hell."

 ""Oh, and tell your friends, that first door you knocked on downstairs, was my landlord. He now has your face, plus the your sensei's face. Well not yet. I'm going to be giving him the video, and we'll see if he decides to try to call the cops on your ass. Hey, the statute of limitations isn't up yet, so there's still plenty of time""

 Chances are your landlord is gonna be like ""You don't need to be bringing ninjas over here, property values will go down.""  I should also point out that your landlord didn't look any older than us, in fact, he looked just like a regular tenant.


""Scruggs, you should have waited that night. Not twenty minutes after you left, I got home""

Uh, well... I straight up ask to stay until you get back in the video.  Your bitch also told us that you called him earlier saying you wouldn't be back until much later.


""Hey, Fredryk, should you ever get a brain, (and a facelift, for that matter, even Scruggs looks better than you)""

In the world of insults, this is what's known as a ""twofer"".


""He's already got the copyright on stupidity, get your own copyright on something better""
 
 I don't know.  Stupidity seems like a damn fine thing to have a copyright on, I mean if you get royalties every time someone does something stupid you would be rich as hell.  Think of all the gold cars you could buy with that money.

 
""I'm close to bending and abusing the laws of thermodynamics, you guys are sitting around not doing shit but pray that you get fucked up the ass hard by someone you've probably never once met in your life. Sad""

Why must all internet drama inevitably revolve around thermodynamics?


""Thanks for helping me write an essay on stereotypes with loads of references. I'm a surefire winner of this scholarship I applied for with this type of material""

Slow down, that scholarship isn't yours yet.  It's plausible that not everybody on the panel judging the scholarship essays will find ""Why I Hate Dudes on Livejournal"" as groundbreaking as you do."

"event","Like most people, I know that one day I'll be rich and famous; it's just a matter of time.  I'm doing ok, but to be honest I'd prefer to be crazy rich, you know, like solid gold top hats and diamond monocles.  So instead of waiting for my fortune to come to me like it surely will, I've decided to take a more proactive stance.  So here are three inventions, one of which (or possibly all) will make me rich and famous.

1) The snake gun - Guns are good and all, but they're useless against dudes who can dodge bullets.  The snake gun shoots venomous snakes instead of bullets, so basically there's no way to avoid getting hit.  There will also be a variety of snake gun that shoots poisonous snakes instead of venomous snakes, but you'll have to shoot dudes when their mouths are open, since poison has to be ingested.

2) The silent train - Like a normal train except you can't here it coming.  I can see no harm coming from this.

3) milk-flavored gummy snacks - Tell me that doesn't sound delicious.

Oh yeah, and none of y'all steal these ideas and get famous on them before I have a chance."

It was absolutely incredible.  The opening band White Magic was awesome and all the rich kids decked out in trucker hats and factory work shirts were like a bonus.  Anyway, Bonny Prince Billy is a folk band led by Will Oldham of Palace Brothers.  It's difficult to describe their music, but it bears more of a resemblance to mountain folk than deadhead hippy burnout crap.  The band even took a break from their more traditional folk songs to do a cover of R. Kelly's ""Ignition"". And let me say you haven't heard R. Kelly's ""Ignition"" until you've heard it performed by a folk band."

This isn't a contest.  Also, there's no way that dude was telling the truth.  If you had gone for two weeks straight without sleep you wouldn't be sitting there and talking to someone and acting normal.  You would be hallucinating and shit.  I don't know, I just don't consider people who have severe insomnia to be badasses as much I consider them people afflicted with a sleeping disorder.

Not surprisingly, the guy I was talking about is a compulsive liar as well.  He told me he got bitten by a moray eel while he was getting treasure out of a sunken ship and he also said he lost $800 playing poker with Nancy Reagan while he was in military.

"event","This whole ""owned"" thing has gotten out of hand.  At first, even I thought it was funny.  I remember dudes saying ""owned"" in seventh grade ha ha.  And then I fuckin moved on with my life.  

But apparently the world fuckin stopped for half the dudes on the internet when they saw that joke. They had to make it their own.  They had to use in every gayass conversation, especially when it wasn't funny or appropriate.  Everywhere I look on the web I see shit like ""I don't like your buddy icon. OWN3D!!!111"" That's about as far from ownership as you can get. You need to save that shit for when you kill someone's family or blow up a country.   Now, they don't even say OWN3D!!111 anymore, now it's ""pwned.""  I understand there's a lot of humor on the internet centered around common typos, but this shit has become the computer equivalent of jokes about golf or coffee.  

I hope the word ""buddy"" doesn't share a similar fate.  Buddy was a term used primarily when I was in 8th grade and denoted that something was sorta lame or gay.
For example, ""Those Vans are buddy.  You need to get some fresh kicks."" or ""Wicca is the buddiest religion.""  I really like the word ""buddy"", so don't tell any nerds about it.  I just don't want buddy internet dorks ruining ""buddy"" and making it totally bo-bo."

"event","There's something I've been meaning to get off my chest for a while and I've finally worked up the courage to do it.  This kinda of hard to say, but I'm a chocohalic.  It's like an alcoholic, but for chocolate.  I love chocolate so much it makes me question my sexuality.  All I ever think about is chocolate. There's probably been times when you've been baring your soul to me and I was just thinking about chocolate.  I've been living with this affliction for most of my life and I thought it was time to come clean.  If anyone has lived through this and come out on the other side, I would really appreciate your advice.  If any of you don't want to be friends with me now that you know I'm a chocohalic, I understand."

"event","Here are some illustrations I did for a children's song/poem my friends Stan and Matt wrote called ""Guerrillas of the Rodentkin.""  These are my first attempts at drawing anthropomorphic animals.  I was rather surprised by the amount of problem solving that goes into drawing things like this.  I think perhaps the toughest problem to solve is the one of not making it look gay.  Most of my artwork is of a more abstract or symbolist nature.  Justin scanned these, I'll post some of my other stuff when I get a scanner.

"event","The party on Saturday was one of the best parties I've ever graced with my presence. And that means a lot coming from a veteran of two 5-day parties. Bike Gang Knife Fight had a concert right in the fucking apartment.  It was bad as hell.  I would say around 30-40 people were crammed into apartment 10-H.  The party, dubbed ""Hammerfest,"" was a going away party in honor of my good friend and all around badass motherfucker Justin Ivancic.  He's leaving to join the Navy in a week, I hope he kills a lot of bad guys with his submarine.   Anyway, in addition to the normal party shit, the following also went down:
-BGKF concert
-art trade (I won a drawing of a dick and a drawing of a cyclops that said ""I'm gonna get you!"")
-screened Dimestore Hoods movie
-Sing along (included the hit song ""Let's Do Some Gaystuff to See What it Feels Like"")
-Stan tried to seduce several Korean girls, despite a promising start, he ultimately failed

I left at 2:30 in the morning drove 3 hours back to Memphis, slept for an hour and then went to work.  I am hardcore."

"event","I heard President Bush said if he gets a second term he's going to spend millions of Americans' tax dollars financing the construction of a time machine so he can go back in time and kill the guy who invented school.  If that's true, I think that would be a horrendous waste of the taxpayers' hard-earned money. The economy is bad enough without having to pay for the president's personal time machine.  Also, the president isn't even in school anymore so why should he even care?"

I think it's sad that the underwear boner community is so compromising in their taste, indiscriminately praising each new boner as the greatest and most beautiful boner they've ever seen. I'm not a gaywad, but I took a look at some of those boners and, in my humble opinion, many of them were subpar at best, but you wouldn't know that from all the gushing comments. The thing is, this is will wind up hurting the boner owners, thinking they all ready have a perfect boner they'll no longer feel the urge to strive for increasingly better boners. If anything, all this indiscriminate praise will serve as an impediment to the boner owner's talent, ushering in a new decade of mediocre boners. You brought it on yourselves underwear boner live journal community, so don't come crying to me when your wasting away in the midst of a boner blight."

"event","I don't know what the fuck is wrong with kids now.  I think you know what I'm talking about, they're fucked up as hell.  I blame Columbine.  Post-Columbine antibullying reforms altered the social heirarchy of American schools by effectively making it impossible for kids to bully each other and therefor not allowing the enforcement of social mores.  Kids were no longer rewarded with positive reinforcement for engaging in normal, socially acceptable behavior and thus had no reason to engage in healthy behavior.

For example, every other kid I see now is a fat as hell.  Fat kids at least tried to lose weight when I was younger, because they knew dudes would make rightfully make fun of them.  Kids need to quit supersizing their bacon double cheeseburger combo meals, get off their goddamn computers and start playing sports like normal kids used to. 

And these kids are dorky as hell, too.  There all about anime and warhammer and dance dance revolution.  Dudes weren't in to dorky shit like that when I was growing up because they knew dudes would beat the fuck out of them if they ever revealed any weakness.  I'm not saying anime fans, furries and otherkin didn't exist until recently, it's just that were a lot less of them and they knew to keep their mouths shut for their own safety.  And kids are gay now too.  What the fuck is with that?  If you're in junior high you should be afraid to look at dude while talking to him in case someone might call you gay.  But teenagers now are flaming queens and everybody knows it and nobody beats them up for it.  It's like the weirdos have hijacked youth culture.  It was better back when everybody was repressed."

"event","The only reason white people like Dave Chapelle is because they feel obligated to.  It's sorta of a reparations thing I guess.  White people think that if they pretend to like a racist black comedian, people will think that they're not racist.  The thing is Chapelle isn't funny or groundbreaking or subversive, he's just a stunningly untalented Richard Pryor rip-off who constantly tells us he is funny, groundbreaking and subversive.  He acts like he's the first black person on television.  He even says shit like ""Watch out America, black man on your tv"". What the fuck? He's a little late to be surprising people with his race. Does he seriously think he's the only black person who does anti-white comedy?  Has he never watched Comic View on BET?  What the world needs is an anti-black white comedian.  That would be funny as hell.  I bet someone reading this will find that idea offensive and I bet that person will completely unaware of the irony.  But my biggest problem with Chapelle isn't the racism, it's how fucking shitty and unoriginal his comedy is.  For example he had a skit where a dude got True Self glasses which allowed him to see a person's inner self (that's a gay ass idea) and he looks at a muscular dude and then he puts on the true self glasses and the dude is a midget.  That's not funny, it's just fucking stupid. If you like that shit I feel sorry for you."

"event","All you haters need to recognize Wallace's gant mason bee as your fuckin king.  Don't even come to me with your broke ass ghettoe bees.  Chalicodoma pluto, better known as Wallace's giant mason bee, was known only from a type specimen collected in 1859 on the Mollucca Islands by renowned naturalist Alfred Wallace.  It was over 120 years before another another one was seen. In the early eighties, several nests were discovered inside termite mounds. Wallace's giant mason bee is so rare that not even the natives had known about them.  It is also the largest bee, straight up.  The female's body is 1.6 inches long and its wingspan is almost 3 inches.  I know your thinking ""That's not really all that big""  Fuck you.  It's a lot bigger than a bumblebee and you know you run away like a sissy from those.  Aside from being the rarest and largest bee, Wallace's giant mason bee is also the objectively coolest looking.  So don't even try to be hatin.

Why is all next week going to be no snow in the pass. Every single day is cloudy and no snow. Then the only three days that matter are snow, snow, snow and then it goes back to cloudy on monday. I hate the weather right now! It sucks so bad!"

"event","I'm still sick! Right now I can't remember what its like to be able to breathe and to be able to hear things clearly. Everytime I go to work I get more sick. I think my almost 2 weeks off from work is going to be good for me. I went to the doctor the other day to see what was wrong with me and he didn't know. I got my fist anti-biotic though! The pills are huge and the cough medicine tastes like death. I don't feel like its working but maybe it is?? It's only my second day of taking it. 

Babysitting tonight for Jackson and Ilana. They are cute but I'm just not in the mood to babysit. They have at least 200 DVD's though so hopefully I'll be able to find a good movie to watch when they go to bed! 

Gotta go dry my hair and then leave. 6 days til Spokane! I'm so excited! yay! Pray for NO SNOW in the pass next weekend!"

"event","Finals so far have been pretty good. Calculus was interesting and I couldnt tell if I knew how to do the problems or if I was pretending like I knew what I was doing. I dont really care what I got on that one though because I'm all done with that class forever and it doesnt matter anymore. IB Bio 2 and Chemistry were today. Chem was really easy and Bio was pretty easy too. I didnt finish the written part though because I didnt feel good and I just couldnt concentrate anymore. TV production tomorrow.... watching a movie... then running 7 laps in 20 minutes for Raquet Sports. Can't really complain about finals this year. 

Schedule for next semester:
1. TV Production 
2. Health with Oprea
3. Chem with Dr. V
4. IB Bio 2 with Dr. V again!
5. Preschool T.A.
6. Creative Writing with McCombs

I woke up for school but realized that my head was pounding and I was going to throw up so I stayed home from school. Had to get up to go to 6th period though cause I had a speech today. That went pretty well considering the whole room was spinning. Came home from school and ate some chicken noodle soup and somehow that made me feel a lot better. Din din with my family and lots of Sims playing. My lady... whose husband died in a fire and girl died from no sleep, got married today. Now she is happy and I think they are going to have a baby soon! yay! I love how once you start playing sims you cant stop for like 2 hours. Its so addicting. Im gonna go watch a movie now.

I don't believe in the smile that you leave
When you walk away and say goodbye 
Well, I don't expect the world to move underneath me 
But for God's sake, could you try 
I know that you're true to me 
You're always there, you say you care 
I know that you wanna be mine 

Where is your heart, cause I don't really feel you 
Where is your heart, what I really want is to believe you 
Is it so hard to give me what I need 
I want your heart to bleed, that's all I'm asking for, oh
Where is your heart

I don't undertsand, your love is so cold 
It's always me who's reaching out for your hand 
And I've always dreamed that love would be effortless 
Like a petal falling to the ground 
A dreamer following his dream 

Where is your heart, cause I don't really feel you 
Where is your heart, what I really want is to believe you 
Is it so hard to give me what I need 
I want your heart to bleed, that's all I'm asking for, oh
Where is your heart

It seems so much is left unsaid
But you can say anything 
Oh, anytime you need 
Baby, it's just you and me, oh yeah

I know that you're true to me 
You're always there, you say you care 
I know that you wanna be mine 

Where is your heart, cause I don't really feel you 
Where is your heart, what I really want is to believe you 
Is it so hard to give me what I need 
I want your heart to bleed, that's all I'm asking for, yeah

Where is your heart, cause I don't really feel you 
Where is your heart, what I really want is to believe you 
Is it so hard to give me what I need 
I want your heart to bleed, and that's all I'm asking for
Where is your heart

I realized tonight when i was studying for my bio test that I really really miss vB's class. My dad was watching tv and the song ""lets get it on"" came on and it reminded me of having plant sex with our wisconsin fast plants when we had to pollinate them. I was going through my old ib bio binder and looking through stuff and realized what a fricking awesome teacher she is! I miss her lectures, and her excitement for everything that has to do with bio, and her entire class and everything about it. This year bio is just blah without vB. Vernons lectures are so boring and there is never anything exciting that happens. I wanna go back to ib bio 1!!!

Doesnt it seem like it wasnt that long ago when it was 1999 going to 2000 and the whole world was freaking out saying it was gonna be the end of the world. And remember when it was 2001 and we were all starting high school looking up to the seniors thinking they looked so old. I cant believe we are the seniors now and its already almost half way through our senior year. Its such a mixed emotion feeling. Part of me is really excited for college and experiencing new things and going off away from home while the other part of me is scared to death for what next year is gonna bring. New people, new places, new everything! My new years resolution... or at least one of them is to make the rest of this year before college the best it can possibly be! 

New years was fun! I went to Seattle with kk to watch the fireworks at the space needle. I'd say we had the best view in town! We didnt have to stand in the seattle center with the other 20,000 people looking straight up into the sky at the fireworks. We were up on the hill looking over toward the city! It was awesome! Then right after the fireworks were over all hell broke loose in seattle. We were right behind some drunk people driving on the wrong side of the road. Then when there was a car coming at them they swerved over really fast and then stopped in the middle of the road for like 30 seconds. Then on our way to finding the freeway we saw like 5 fire engines, police cars, and ambulances with their sirens on trying to get to somewhere on the freeway. I bet they just love working the new years eve shift!! In all it was a pretty good night! I loved the drive home and the little detour on the way home! It was pretty fun!!!

Time for me to get to bed now. One more day of break tomorrow and then its back to school...meh! I dont know where that break went to but it sure didnt stick around for as long as i would have liked. I dont know if im ready for another month and a half of school! eww! 

Goodnight all!

I still need to do more shopping but ill get it done sometime! Meet the Fockers is tomorrow! Im excited for that. Grandparents are coming today so i get to chill with them! First i gotta go to work... which i dont wanna do but its better than cleaning the house for my mom! 

The first stage of applying to colleges is officially done for me. Ive sent them all in and heard back from all of them. I got into all the places i applied (Gonzaga, Eastern, and Whitworth) and im really excited for that! Now its time for the next step to start which is scholarships applications so that i can get money so i can go to college. I cant wait for all of this to be over and to just be able to decide where i really wanna go to! That might be the hardest thing about this though. At this point i have no clue! Time will only tell! 

Gotta go shower and get ready for work now. <3 <3

I dont think this week could have gone any longer than it did and winter break is so incredibly needed at this point. I really dont wanna waste my time and go to school tomorrow for 3 hours but i dont really want the absenses either. I guess i will just go... i mean its not like we are gonna be doing anything anyways. Me and kt were just at target and i barely had enough energy to walk around the store and get all the stuff she needed. I love it when that happens. So right now i think its about bed time for me. At least a little nap cause i got a chem lab to do with lo later and maybe math hw but i highly doubt i will be doing that. Anyways... bed time for me! Goodnight everyone!

At lunch there were a bunch of firefighters clearing the football field and we were confused... turns out a helicopter was coming to land there to air lift someone to the hospital. Thats kinda random. Found out in 5th period that we had a fire drill 6th and freaked out cause i was gonna have rascal with me and he would freak out if he heard that bell. My speech went pretty good! Rascal was calm and didnt really meow which was kinda surprising... i thought he would go crazy. Im babysitting tonight for caroline and then gonna attempt to learn cellular respiration before the test on thursday. I hate it so much its so confusing and i need to do good on this test... i failed the last one! 

Im so excited for break to be here. This morning in first period my eye started twitching until 3rd period. I think its cause i didnt get very much sleep last night and i havent really gotten very much sleep in the past couple weeks. Break is well needed at this point. J's birthday was today and he made us cinnamon rolls and brought baby oranges... those were really good! Christmas is in 13 days! I cant wait. Christmas is the best time ever! And then its my birthday in 33 days! I wanna be 18! Its gonna be fun! Me and sarah riddell are gonna have the best 18th birthday party! 

Time to go babysit... farewell everyone!

Much love,

We found really pretty rings in the gift shop and i loved them but they cost like $5000 so that wasnt as fun anymore! Then we all walked down to pike place market and shopped for 2 hours. We made friends with the fish throwing man and he helped us find carla. Then we listened to a man play christmas songs using a bass bow and a saw... it was pretty dang cool! Came back home and then went to target to get some more christmas presents for people! I love shopping for christmas presents... especially when i am successful at finding what im looking for! So now im just sitting around and waiting for dinner to be ready! It smells really good so i think i should probably go and get ready to eat yummy food!

It never really happens for me much anymore and so im starting to get used to 5 or 6 hours a night. I guess thats sorta good cause then when school comes around maybe i wont be so tired when i have to get up early... ha ha JOKE!


I really wish that september 18 was gonna work out the way that its supossed to but everything keeps changing and getting messed up and now i dont think thats gonna be happening either which really sucks my ass. I hate how nothing can ever turn out the way that i want it to. If only one of these days i would be able to do what i wanted when i wanted without the parentals stepping in and trying to do what they think is the ""right thing"". What they think is the right thing for me is the exact opposite... they think that other things are making me depressed but its really them doing it to me. 

So thats my thinking process for this afternoon. Im gonna go eat some breakfast or lunch i guess it would be now.

studio b tonight i think! I hope that my tummy feels better soon cause i really wanna go.

I feel like each day is just taking a little bit more of my strong side and at some point its all gonna be gone and theres gonna be no way to stop me from dying. I dont know what it is about today. The past few days havent been too bad. I mean im still having one of the worst weeks of my life to this point in time but today just seemed to suck my ass. I feel like there is nothing i can do to defend myself from this evil demon called college that is always in my life trying to eat me alive. Im vulnerable as hell right now and ive never felt more alone in my life. I know that i have plenty of people who  could turn to but it always seems like i just end up wanting to be by myself. Jealous is another good way to describe everything thats happening. Im jealous of so many people right now its not even funny. Maybe im just being too self involved and i need to start being happy for people rather than jealous of them. There are some people though that i could never be happy for because they are part of the reason i feel like im going to be ripped into pieces anyday now. FUCK! i just wanna scream right now and then take something thats hella fragile and just throw it on the ground and watch it crumble into pieces."

Went to work and that was the slow part. I felt like it was never gonna end. There wasnt anything exciting that happened to make it good. Came home and had dinner and got into a huge fight with my dad. He made me stay home tonight ""to think about things"" haha sounds like something they tell you when you're like 2 and you throw a toy or something. 

Just like 2 more days and then grapeview! Holy @&^#% i seriously cant wait that long!! Its gonna be soooo fun and wow i cant wait! 

ive decided that worrying about everything that ive been worrying about isnt really worth it so im not gonna do it. I mean what is the point of dreading something cause then all you are gonna do is think about that and not all the good times that you still have! So that is my thinking for the day and i just hope that its the best way to think of the situation that im in right now.

I dont know if i am strong enough to handle everything thats gonna be coming at me. I really dont think that i am. Its coming way too fast and there is nothing i can do to protect myself from it. 

It seems like it was not too long ago that i met all of you and the time that you were going to leave was so far away. I dont know how it came so fast but it seriously has. It doesnt seem fair at all but i guess things in life never have been fair and never will be. 

I dont mean to always be complaining about this but its all that has been on my mind lately. I really cant think of anything else to think of when im sitting here at home. Home is the worst place to be so i try my best to avoid it but its kinda hard to do that at night. And that is exactly why nights are the worst. Its also the reason why im never up until about 12 in the morning. Getting to sleep is so hard to do which makes getting up in the morning even harder!

It made me kinda nervous the first time she pulled the foils out and my hair was WHITE basically but then when the red was added and it was all said and done its pretty damn cute! Not too big of a change. Then i went to work with kT hottness and attempted to teach Amogh (a non-english speaking kid) how to quack like a duck and oink like a pig.... the duck worked the pig didnt at all. The only thing he knows in engligh is the barney song! Good times at the club today without a doubt. Went to meggos tonight and watched family guy with the gang! Good times... i have to admit that i did enjoy it alot better that time than when i watched it before.... its not AS bad as i thought it was... kutzke im sorry for always bashing on it!

I guess i cant really complain about everything lately. Everything is going a lot better than i thought it could ever be at this point in the summer. Ive been able to keep myself busy hanging out with the best people ever! I want this summer to go on forever and never end! I dont know how im gonna live once it all comes to an end. Its gonna be such a hard time for me but i know that you guys will always be there to help me get through whats gonna be coming up! muah love you all!

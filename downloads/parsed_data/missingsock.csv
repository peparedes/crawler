Under 12: You are a kid at heart. You still have an optimistic life view - and you look at the world with awe.

20-29: You are a twentysomething at heart. You feel excited about what's to come... love, work, and new experiences.

"event","The first name of <b>Christa</b> leads you to assume considerable responsibility and to prefer to work independently, without direction or interference from others because you have very definite ideas of your own. Your mind is quick to comprehend and you can be depended upon to do any job well. 
Because you tend to be somewhat of a perfectionist, you might insist on doing too many things yourself instead of delegating jobs to others who might do less satisfactory work. This name does make you quite direct and straight-to-the-point. 
Your verbal expression does not reflect your inner thoughts and feelings, and you often wonder why people react to what you say. The influence of this name does not promote the friendship that you desire or the relaxation and naturalness you should enjoy with people. It is a name that makes you far too practical and serious-minded, and makes it difficult for you to act with spontaneity. 
You could suffer physically through head tension, with eye, teeth, or sinus problems, headaches, or mentally through worry."

what a night!  went to the Vogue with <lj user=ajka> and my girl <lj user=unlimnable> and had a great night.  was very packed at first, but once the danger of Grace getting trampled subsided, we had a fun time.  Also got to see my gals <lj user=anzu> and <lj user=moonfire> and revel in our girl-fu for a bit.  Got a late-surprise visit from <lj user=revseandoe> and his flashing chest.  is that a bomb in your pocket or are you just happy to see me?

Finally met Shawn, the bouncer guy at the front door that you all know - yeah, i know...see what happens when i stray away from the Mercury?  i also got to meet Neflm and Staxxy, a couple more of ""ours"".  i did like the Vogue and would like to go back sometime.  

an extra thank you to <lj user=geekalpha> for safely delivering me to my car - your graciousness and conversation were truly enjoyed.

i am currently surviving on 3 hours of sleep, however there is no hangover involved so i may just survive this day.  as long as nothing happens to the coffee pot.

in other news, i really want to punch Howard Stern's limo driver in the face.  those of you who listen to the show agree with me i'm sure."

we are still friends and roomates - and it seems to me like our relationship is better now, because we are not trying to be something we are not.

we were friends first, and that's the way it will always be.

"event","happy friday everyone! we made it through another week, barely, but we made it.

this morning i have some song lyrics for you.  i had this on repeat this morning.  besides the fact that it is an awesome song, the verse is some advice we could all use. 


Be still
through chaos rains around you now
only so much rain can fall at once
breathe in
and let the air envelope you
and slow but sure, serenity will come

(chorus)
close your eyes
try to breathe
feel the ground
beneath your feet
it's still there
the world still turns around

stand up
through circumstance has knocked you down
there is nothing gained by staying within it's reach
take strength
in every failure you endure
our mistakes have many lessons they can teach

(chorus)
close your eyes
try to breathe
feel the ground
beneath your feet
it's still there
the world still turns around

destroy
these walls you've built around yourself
you can't take another step until their gone
move out
no use in dwelling in the past
bid farewell to all your fears and carry on

(chorus)
close your eyes
try to breathe
feel the ground
beneath your feet
it's still there
the world still turns around

--------Ground by Assemblage 23

have a good day, everyone :)"

"event","I made her smile, I made her cry
Cleared her head and made her wonder why
I helped her live, I made her want to die
But she can't complain, she can't complain

She tried to date a friend of mine
I was at his house when she came to say goobye
He stood her up and she took it as a sign
But I can't complain, I can't complain

We took off for the weekend, had quite a time
Shared everything we'd ever tried
I told her I could love her, told her I could lie
So she can't complain, she can't complain

She didn't care if she saw me in her life
I left it up for her to decide
She couldn't see the end, neither could I
So I can't complain, I guess I can't complain

She moved here, bought the first house she could find
I moved in, we locked ourselves inside
I guess we just kidnapped each other's minds
So we can't complain, we can't complain, mmm

I cheated on her with a friend of mine
There are no days when we don't fight
But remember, I warned her, and I'm a guy
So she can't complain, no she can't complain

She knows she can't complain
She can't complain
No, she can't complain...

No, she can't complain, she can't complain
She can't complain, she can't complain
No, no, she can't complain, she can't complain
She can't complain, she can't complain
She can't complain"

"event","The future has got me worried, such awful thoughts.
My head is a carousel of pictures.
The spinning never stops.
I just want someone to walk in front
and I'll follow the leader.
Like when I fell under the weight of a schoolboy crush.
Started carrying her books and doing lots of drugs. I almost forgot who I was, 
but came to my senses.
Now I'm tryin' to be assertive.
I'm making plans.
Wanna rise to the occasion, yeah
meet all of their demands.
But all I do is just lay in bed
and hide under the covers.
I know I should be brave
but I'm just too afraid of all this change.
And it's too hard to focus through all this doubt.
I keep making these ""To Do"" lists but nothing gets crossed out.
Working on the record seems pointless now.
When the world ends, who's gonna hear it?
But Im tryin' and take some comfort in written words,
yeah Tim I heard your album and it's better than good.
When you get off tour I think we should hang and black out together.
Because I've been feeling sentimental for days gone by...
all those summers singing, drinking, laughing, wasting out time.
Remember all those songs and the way we smiled
in those basements made of music.
But now I've got to crawl, to get anywhere at all. I'm not as strong as I thought.
So when I'm lost in a crowd,
I hope that you'll pick me out.
Oh, how I long to be found.
The grass grew high. I laid down.
Now I wait for a hand to lift me up, help me stand.
I have been laying so low
Don't want to lay here no more.
Don't want to lay here no more.
Don't want to lay here no more.
Don't want to lay here no more.
But if everything that happens is supposed to be
and it is predetermined, can't change your destiny. 
Then I guess I'll just keep moving, someday, maybe, I'll get to where I'm going."

I got a sweet parcel from saddle creek this nigh. Its contents included: one Bright Eyes T-Shirts and the two new Bright Eyes CDs that don't even come out for 2 more weeks!!!! Wow I am a faggot. Yes I said Faggot. I love that word and no gay alliance deal is going to stop me. I'm not some ingnorant peice of trash (well maybe a little trashy) but you kids are ignorant for thinking you can change how people think. I love my gay friends to death, and I realize it must be shitty for them and hard, but life is hard. Everyone has ther own problems. I have a hard time getting out of bed in the morning and I like vagina. Thats my two cents from my ""ignorant"" mind. I drove around with koombsy tonight and that was a lot of fun I missed that kid. I hope that I will get to see more of those kids.
P.S. I have apparently gone of the deep end. (for more information please inquire with a one Christopher Moulton were you will get the 100% honest to goodness truth on Tyler Stephens

I'll turn around again, Paint over pictures on the wall
I can't believe she gave me alcohol
I thought of Jezebel
Hung from a wrecking ball to see a fashion show
I think you knew me so well

Juliet! You know you want it!

I've been receiving strange phone calls from the city
I will not extend my hand to the general
And I do not think the people will remember us
I hung from a wrecking ball to see your fashion show
I think you know me well

I've been jumping over buildings, I've been sleeping in the street
""Mr. Jones"" will be right with you if you would just have a seat
Well I'll meet you at the river where we both can clear our heads
I think we would look great dead.

I've got to find the princess, she's in another castle
I'm dancing with the Capulet
We're so ""crazy in love""

"event","It is fucked up/amazing how much one TV can affect your life. Some people have the bible or self help tapes. Others have therapists. I have the TV show Full House. As fucked up as that sounds I am dead serious. Watching the marathon on TV Land last night/this morning made me realize a lot of things. I realized that the past repeats itself over and over again (people just wear diffrent clothes). I realized that I am doing the same thing to Chris that I did to the Union. Forgetting all the good times we had, and just dwelling on the negative. And you know what? That is what is fucked up. Not light switches. My advice to all is if you are feeling glum flip over to TV land or Fox family in hopes of catching a glimpse of Bob Saget or John Stamos, because they are no diffrent than us. They have problems aswell. You can learn a lot from these men.

"event","I wish I could process my thoughts.
I wish I wasn't dumb.
I wish I was on good terms with my mom.
I wish downtown was like it was 2 months ago.
I wish every time I die was playing a show in maine soon.
I wish I was dead."

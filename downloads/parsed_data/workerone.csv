"event","Obviously, my husband wasn't listening when I told him at the beginning of the week that I was going shopping on Saturday.  Since the party for Matt & Sara is on Sunday night, I planned to pick up a couple of things for them still.  He informed me that he'd be busy making a shield for one of the grandchildren (not Jordan).  Sounded fine to me, and I thought we were on the same page.  Now I think Don's had a brain lapse or is choosing to have a convenient loss of memory.  As of tonight he's all surprised because I'm not going to be here, and he's invited the eldest grandson (12 years old) to stay with him while his parents go shopping.  However, now the younger grandson will now be upset because he can't stay unless I'm here too.  Well, I'm not rearranging my plans and jumping through any hoops.  Part of the day I'm hanging with Jennifer (wish Karen could be here and any other friends of hers too), and the rest I may just spend at the book store.  Enough ranting!"

Thank goodness they now have bumpers to keep the frustration level down for children.  Second, he had to learn to take his turn which seemed terribly unfair to him only after I allowed him to bowl a set straight through.  Short of CPR, he recovered.  I hadn't bowled in over 20 years and somehow pulled off a 159 and a 165 with no handicap - that's truly a miracle that should have been documented for a seal of approval from the Pope.

However, those left behind had to deal with the arrival of Sit and Spin, hubby, and grandchildren.  Grandpa kept the grandchildren while they went to the store.  The following events occurred in real time.  

1.  There was no Easter meal waiting for them.  Everything was put up when they arrived.
2.  The oldest grandson was a putz as usual.  Treated Jordan like dirt and was rude to the adults as well.
3.  The little grandson was cute, but you just can't help wanting to bathe that child.
4.  The little grandson taught us his newest word in his vocabulary - ""damn"".
5.  The oldest grandson repeatedly said ""crap"" until bluntly told to knock it off.  Jordan has no clue what the word means.
6.  The oldest grandson was told he would be frisked for toys that he may pocket just in case he ""forgot"" to return them. Jennifer followed through on that one as she sternly said, ""Empty your pockets now.""  She would do well at intimidating terrorists.  
7.  I asked the parents to pick up milk for us.  This is a first - I attempted to give him the money but he refused to take it.  If Sit and Spin knew that, she'd might have come off her seat to throttle him.  She was already furious that the littlest one didn't want to go with her and insisted on staying at our house.
8.  The last time we saw the grandchildren was the day before Christmas when the oldest grandson tried to steal some of Jordan's toys. Sit and Spin is still mad about the party incident where her child was caught lying so we are being punished.

1.  She was located 1 block from the fire department.  Hint:  Call 911. 
2.  She was located 1 block from the police department.  Hint:  Call 911. 
3.  Instead of using her cell phone to contact either of these departments, she calls her husband who is across the country. She had probably tried to call ""friends"" first but I guess they were just plain tired of being used too. 
4.  Don's idiot son, who is a volunteer fireman, decides to call his dad rather than insist his insane wife call 911.  Mmmmm....911, maybe he forgot the number.  How he ever passed the test for the V.F.D. is a mystery to me.   
5.  Don was the big dork who just about drove off before I ranted and raved at him that he was beginning to sound just as insane as to two of them.  His legs prevent him from getting in certain positions for leverage due to the extensive surgeries he's had.    
6.  Don does not want to call 911 because ""it's just too embarrassing"".  By now he has earned the title of Mr. Dork.  Mr. Dork then becomes angry with me for having the nerve to look up the phone number for the fire department and tell him to call it.  You'd think he could surely handle that, but alas....  
7.  Don proceeds to hone his dork skills by telling the fire department the situation, giving them a vague description and location of the vehicle, and then fails to give them the daughter-in-law's cell phone number or ours.  
8.  I have to call back and give the fire department ""Sit and Spin's"" number plus our phone number because Mr. Dork is insulted that I brought this to his attention.
9. I now insist that he call ""Sit and Spin"" to tell her the F.D. is on it's way.  He doesn't want to because he can't handle her nonsensical one-sided conversations.  Too bad - I refused to phone her.  During the course of the conversation, she informs him that she's had our 11 year old grandson trying to release the lift manually, never once considering that the child may injure himself in the process.  
10. F.D. truck arrives and it takes 3 guys to get the lift unstuck.  They deserve a medal just for having to listen to her babble.
11. I am miffed at Don, but I do apologize for using common sense.  He sheepishly admits he didn't handle things well.  Gee, I know who I won't count on in an emergency crisis.  This is so odd to me since Don used to run ambulances for a county back in the days before there were paramedics.  This is also the same guy who insists on watching doppler radar on TV when the tornado sirens are sounding rather than take cover.  Go figure!
12. The score is now 11:1 over the past 2 months on his son calling only when he needs a favor or to borrow something.

"event","I'm so tired of being tired and I hope I can stay awake at the drs.  Have to find something to read.  If I'm really lucky, the doc leaves the book of pills in all the pretty colors you can imagine.  It's no wonder pharmacists get confused with so many of them looking identical.  That's where the reading part comes in and online pill identification.  Trust no one.  

Now my eyes are messed up and I've been so careful.  Always use the hand sanitizer.  Wash, wash, wash.  Spray, spray, spray.  Bad germs.  When is it my turn to have a good day?  I've been waiting patiently in line for some time now.  It's like living in a nightmare at the neverending check out at Wal-Mart."

"event","Spring must have sprung in some other part of the country because it's cold here again.  The tulips are coming up but they may be in trouble if the predicted freeze comes to pass.  

Don had 3 appointments this morning and each time he has called to make sure he was at the right place at the right time.  Just goes to show how he depends on me to keep up with his business.  He rarely goes to the doctor alone as he doesn't keep track of questions to ask.  It's really true, people should have someone to speak up on their behalf in serious situations.  I have grown used to quizzing all medical professionals.  

With the doctor appointments complete, he's now being fingerprinted to make sure he's not a terrorist.  Of course, he's been hauling freight for many years and hasn't once exhibited terroristic behavior.  Don's even taken the course offered by his employer on how to spot terrorists.  Seems to me that what with dodging all of the nuts on the road who has time to be on the lookout for terrorists!  On the off chance that I find out that Don is a terrorist, I guess the $100 we had to spend getting his background check done was well worth it."

"event","I'm just as excited as J is to see the new exhibit at the Memphis Zoo.  He's a little sad that Grandpa can't come with us, but he's so anxious to see the polar bears that it will all work out in the end.  I believe he's trying to get the binoculars down by himself which is one thing that will not work at all.  Little boy, chair, and reaching in the top of the closet - just not a good combination.  He had a good work out at Taekwondo tonight despite not being back to himself after the bout with the stomach virus.  We'll also head to Memphis Pizza for some fantastic eats.  We're stopping at what I used to know as ""Cost Plus"" in California to have a brief shopping spree before heading home.  Thunderstorms approaching tomorrow evening so we'll head back hopefully before it hits.

I'm so lonesome for a new Veronica Mars and Lost!"

It also took 2 days for the other DVD to get checked in and it too was sent on the same day, but it only traveled 15 miles.  Just one DVD to go and I'm done :).  Still hasseling with taxes.

And what's with the weird anti-drug ad featuring a squished whiny girl babbling about giving in to peer pressure?  Are we going back in time to the totally stupid and unbelievable nonsense like the brain eggs frying in pan?

"event","After unwittingly contracting with the poorest online DVD rental business known as Netflix,  I have canceled the service (actually lack of should preface the word service).  I filed numerous complaints through email that either went unanswered,or were responded with a standard form reply.  

Initially, I was sent DVDs that were current releases for about the first 2 months, and that's when the ""throttling"" game began.  New releases were suddenly listed on my queue under the ""very long wait"", ""long wait"", and occasionally the ""short wait"" available column.  Only older movies and series were available to me.  When the DVDs were sent, the turn around time was 4-5 days and I live about 30 miles from the distribution center.  DVDs that were returned to Netflix at the same time via the same post office in the distribution area took 2-3 days before Netflix checked them in.  The ""throttling"" technique is common place and there are several news articles pertaining to this Netflix practice.    

Before I cancelled with Netflix, my daughter signed up and ordered the top 3 movies on my queue that were listed as ""very long wait"".  It wasn't too surprising that she received all of them within 2 days.  That was all the verification I needed to prove Netflix was using  ""throttling"" my account.  I called Netflix at a phone number I found elsewhere online (1-888-638-3549) and at last spoke with a ""volunteer"" about my dissatisfaction with the company policy regarding ""throttling"".  Volunteers are given free rentals in exchange for handling customer complaints at Netflix.  I like to think of them as DVD whores who will say anything just to keep those DVDs coming. When I told the volunteer I was planning to cancel my subscription, he immediately released a new DVD on my account. He attempted to justify  the horrible service I'd received from the local distribution center by blaming it all on the post office.  

I'm proud to say I'm no longer associated with Netflix and will continue to spread the truth about this company and the discrimination against supposedly ""high volume renters""."

It's icy and we're going to church tomorrow and I'm relieved Don's driving.  It does not put my mind at ease when I think about meeting up with other vehicles.  Of course, Jordan is praying for donuts and we're working on him considering the necessity to pray for other things that aren't quite so self absorbing."

"event","As someone keeps saying, ""Why haven't you written in your LJ yet?"", I'm at last going to do the deed.  As Valentine's Day approaches I've given in to my husband's incessant drooling over a See's catalog and ordered him the one pounder that will probably put ten pounds on him.  He's so pleased with his weight as of late so I've suggested he avoid the scale over the next couple of weeks.  We'll be traveling this week and my only request is to dine on calzone at Memphis Pizza, oh yeah, and a ring...with diamonds.  He's getting off cheap with the meal at least.  It really is true that men dole out far more on women on that one day of the year.  

Our dearly loved grandson is determined to go with us today rather than his parents.  I think it's mostly out of his love for his grandpa's inability to say ""no"" to anything.  Someday they will be surgically sewn together.  Ahhh....the arguing has begun with his dad over the subject of who our grandson wants to spend his day with and it's not his parents.  Our grandson is determined and refuses to budge one inch on the opportunity to worship at Grandpa's feet.  I do believe I hear his idol approaching so we'll see who wins the battle."

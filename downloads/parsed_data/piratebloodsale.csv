AAAnyway, woo turkey day soon i get to go HOME!! i never thought i'd be so happy about that. i'm not homesick, i just wanna leave, i hate the fact that i'm always in school, even if i'm sitting in my room spacing out, i'm technically still at school, that's disgusting. but in a week i can LEAVE and see my friends!! yay!!  i really dont see what the fucking hype on college is all about, the only difference from high school is that i live here, which is both good and bad, which neutralizes it, which basically reverts it to complete same-as-high-school-status. WHAT THE FUCK.  and everyone around me is hooking up, here, and my friends at other colleges, everyone has a boyfriend or girlfriend or has at least made out with random people at parties. why do i fail at life?? i'm so sexually frustrated, i thought getting laid in college was supposed to be fuckin easy..... ARGHHHH!! i'm so fucking sexually frustrated. fuck school, fuck a social life, fuck all that other shit, i came here to get some fucking action!! >.< BLEEh... so many other thoughts in my head that i'm not gonna put down because i've found that to be dangerous, no matter what. so i'm just gonna stop before i go too fucking far"

just came back from an exciting adventure in the woods of groton...

we went for a walk down a dark road, and a car came up with a searchlight so we hid in the woods, it passed by twice and so we got out and walked again, but then we saw the light again... the person was searching on foot... we hid in the woods and got eaten alliiiive by fucking squitos, when the person had gone fairly far away after a couple of passes by where we were, we ran through the woods until we hit a road, then we walked back to the car barefoot (FUCK shoes!!) so as not to make too much noise and drove away... weee for random summer adventures cuz we're bored!!

My Last Stab at Poetry
by me

*clears throat*(that's not part of the poem fuckass)

Spiderman is as cool as the fish of the sea
That come and play by the big tree
When they go off in their land of fantasy
And dream of what is and what could not be
And sometimes they come and swing with me
And we swing through the fields of crockery
Which are filled with the shrooms of ecstasy
That share their delight for all who see
The truth of the penguin who is friends with the key
That unlocks the well that grants needles to Shley
When she feels like being blue to agree
With the lilacs of the clouds that float by the ski
Of the Loilarm who chants obscenities to make the shrimp flee
So they can rejoin with their squirrels who are covered in pee
Because the aphids have not shown their true glee
And so cannot fix the vacuum that sits on the knee
Of Santa Claus.

"event","my sister is breaking up with her boyfriend so she's all pissy and bitchy and grr, i feel icky... we found a frog in the yard today, we brought it in and were playing with it, then we let it go in the forest, it probably hopped off to find some swamp weed and went on the trip of a lifetime: he met a rainbow boa constricter that was winding itself up a pink elephant's trunk, he followed them them into a cave where a siamese komodo dragon was blowing naked woman shaped bubbles, which he would then attack and eat, until one of the bubbles turned out being a lesbian and she ran off with another one of the bubble girls, so the frog decided to follow them into their lair where he found them having an orgy with the boa and some other bubble girls they had found on the way, the frog joined in for a while but one by one the bubble girls popped, and finally he was alone with the boa so he decided to sneak away before the snake realized the crevice he was in was only a hole in the rocks, the frog stumbled out and fell down a hole where he met a one-eyed bunny named frank, frank introduced him to a rabid penguin before hopping off and stalking some schitzo kid, the frog and the penguin went off together to hook up with the penguin's roommate who had a bong and some british little kid program movies, so they went off in search of the penguin's roommate, but on the way the frog got knocked out by a giant raisin that fell on his head, when he woke up he saw shadowy figures looming above him, each of them holding some reflective pointy thing, they brought the shiny-ness down and into his stomach, making incisions and cuts and taking things out, the frog was still dissoriented so he didn't complain, until one of the figures started ripping his muscles off of his bones, he tried to get up but he couldn't, finally he worked up the energy to twitch his foot, but it was too late, he was only a skeleton below his non-existent neck, only his head and feet were left intact, when he twitched the giant let go of him with a shriek, and he was dropped on his back.  He wiggled around and pushed himself onto his back, then proceeded to the nearest opening.  he stepped out the door but instead of entering a hallway he found himself in a circus ring with clowns and cannabalistic muffins running around on dying fish, he tried to go back the way he came from but he then realized the ring was on a tiny platform hanging in the middle of an active volcano, he tried to hide but then a clown picked him up by his tongue and started twirling him around, when the clown stopped he had turned into a bundle of ribbons and couldn't move himself, the clown then stuck him up his nose and pulled him out of his ass, when he came out he had been transformed into a japanese dung beetle, in this form he managed to crawl away undetected past the muffins who were eating each other (in more than one way), he then burrowed himself under the sawdust and kept digging until he reached  water.  He opened his eyes (they had been closed to keep the dirt out) and he was sitting on an island inhabited by millions of johnny depps (not johnny depp look alikes, but actual johnny depps), and they were all around playing guitar and drawing and writing, and in the middle of an island there was a tent set up with a girl named diana, and all of the johnny depps were waiting to have their turn fucking her and singing to her and talking to her and drawing for her and just having a wonderful time in general with her, anyway back to the frog that was now a dung beetle, one of the johnny depps decided he would make a cool earring for diana so he tried to poke a hole through him but as soon as the needle hit his side he transformed into a dolphin and knocked the johnny depp to the ground, giving him a concussion, then the former frog turned ribbon turned dung beetle turned dolphin flew away into the setting sun and burned up into a beautiful display of fireworks for all of the now extinct world to not enjoy...

<p>You look old for your age. Hygiene is just that thing that happens to other Pirates. You like what you like. Taking a cannonball to the head in your younger days hasn't helped. Not one to take risks, you enjoy quiet evenings on your bunk. You're a collector. You like things. Not, ""nice"" things- just things. Some people think of you as a blight on humanity - a carbuncle on the alabaster skin of man. You think of yourself as a swell guy with lots of friend - just the one, but lots of him. If you weren't a pirate, but rather lived in the 21st Century, you would be the kind of guy who has played a computer game for four days without thinking of showering and living solely on Mountain Dew and Cool Ranch Doritos.

as the darkness encloses me it feels like the warmth of a familiar face until i realize its coming in faster, seeping into every opening in my body suffocating me in its presence, leaving me all alone and mangled beyond recognition...

"event","yay cartman ripped butter's balls off.... grr i made a mix tape thing for the car cuz theres never anything good on on the radio and it was all cool and full of fun shitness, but when i tried to actually play it in the car it wasnt working, it died and then the stupid tape player thingy ate it and now i gotta make another but i'm to fucking lazy and now for some reason the cd rom drive thingy isnt reading the cds i put in it so i cant burn cds which makes me rather sad....aaa i'm suffering from severe pet deprivation syndrome, the other day i made friends with a cricket his name was fred and he didnt like the spider that ate his sister but decided that it was ok because the bird that had eaten his cousin sam ate the spider and then flew to conneticut where it flew into the window of a van carrying 5 tons of peanut covered gophers which went on to vermont and there squished a walnut that would have fed a family of chipmunks but wasnt there to feed them so they had to scavage for food so they found a patch of rasberries but unfortunatly they were poisonous so they all got herpes and died and then a fox came along and ate the remains of the herpes-ridden chipmunks and got herpes as well as leprosy and bronchitis but before it could die of its deadly case of chickenpox a hunter came and killed it for its wife's jacket who in turn got all of the above diseases as well as the black plague and turned into a werewolf so she went out and attacked the president of the idaho potato company who in panic pressed his little red button and blew up the earth and neptune.......... im gonna try to pass out now because the sooner i get it over with the more likely i'll be ok by tomorrow because im goin to a birthday thingy thing"

"event","went to the mall today... grr i hate cops especially mall cops they wouldn't stop following me around... i'll blow them all up as soon as my shipment of dynamite comes in... at one point there were 3 of them all gathered around, talking and staring straight at me, i moved and they would move, finally i had to give in and call my mom, as soon as she came they scattered... i'm so ashamed, but it was creeping me out way too much... chinese food is good yay for amazing chicken!!  grr my moms being a bitch she keeps trying to blame my nonhappiness on random crap, she doesnt believe that i'm the one thats fucked up and it has nothing to do with any outside influences...then as soon as i leave she blames it all on my dad who has nothing to do with anything... then she got pissed at me because i said i wanted a mindless job and not one that actually requires thinking or responsibility of any kind, i dont kno y she even cares, its just for this year so i can actually pay for all the stupid school trips, i hate having a fucking psychologist as a mom she wont stop analyzing everything... a nest fell out of a tree in my yard and the baby bird was inside, it was okay but its parents wouldnt feed it so i started feeding it eggs (slightly cannabalistic but its the only thing with the consistency of regurgitated worms as well as a good amount of protein)... anyway, after a while its parents started feeding it again so we stopped, but then a few days later i found the nest turned over and the bird was gone, a fox probably ate it... what a waste of eggs... once a few years ago we found a baby bird that had fallen out of its nest which happened to be on the light over the front door, so it was sitting on the stairs looking very confused, so we brought it in and fed it (another cannabalistic bird)and eventually when we saw that the birds still in the nest were starting to fly we taught ours to fly too... we kinda tossed him in the air until he got the hang of it, then tossed him back and forth to each other, then finally one day he flew away, it was funny... i saw part of the butterfly effect with julia and ben it was really cool and now i have to see the rest... ok i'm done...<*(((<"

"event","i was just randomly looking around at other peoples journals, just to see wat people write in these things, then i looked at alot that involved cutting... reading about it just got me even more... i hate using this word because it sounds like some stupid teen angst thing... depressed... all of the things they said were exactly like wat i feel and its kinda scary instead of reassuring... and at the same time it makes me want to... even tho i promised i wudnt... and it'll just get me into trouble, especially since i have a fucking physical soon and they always check me for some reason... everyone wants me to see someone or get meds or something but i dont want them even tho it wud probably help... i dont want to talk about it and they dont understand why... i dont understand why... its almost like i dont want to be happy... or im scared to be i dont know i dont understand i just want to get out of this... i dont kno wat i want"

"event","mmm my mom ran away today, she got sick of us and went back home...luckily we came in 2 cars...she threatens to do that alot, except she usually says she's leaving for ecuador, which is rather difficult so i guess she decided that now she could run away to somewhere closer so she would take advantage of the opportunity... i always thought the kids were supposed to be the ones to threaten to run away, but she does it more than we do... and people wonder why i'm so fucked up... 

we went to provincetown again today and some guy that worked in one of the stores started talking to me about my hair... why is it that the only guys that talk to me are gay and probably think i'm a lesbian??  my sister let me pick out my birthday present, she got me a shirt that says something... i dont remember what tho... soemthing about clowns or satan or voices in my head... 

i hate stupid trains of thought that keep me awake for hours because they progressively remind me of how much i hate myself, making me want to sleep more to stop thinking about it which of course prevents me from sleeping which leads to more hateful thoughts until self destruction is no longer a quiet but constant nagging thought in the back of my head but instead is a strong need that wont go away... and i cant stop it cuz i dont realize its happening until its too late and my head hurts from the stupidness of my thoughts, and then i try to change the train into something pleasant like johnny depp or stuey or cartman but it trails off and i end up thinking different things but with the same basic ending... im not quite sure what i just wrote or if it makes ne sense... stupid trains of thought......

and now for something completely different but not really because its still me writing it which probably makes it kinda the same... there are spiders in my bed or at least one, it keeps biting me and it itches... i made fudge today and it was fudgifull with fudginess... i want a pet again, i haven't ever not had a pet, there's always been soemthing but now we dont have ne thing because they all died... and i saw two pugs in a stroller today in provincetown and they were sooo cute and i miss having something there that doesnt get pissed off at me cuz everyone else does...even tho my dog probably did get pissed off at me everyonce in a while just for fun, and my guinea pig definatly did get pissed off because i would frequently forget to clean her cage, but at least they didnt show it much... cuz some people try to hide it but its always obviously there... i dont blame them tho, i wud get pissed off at me too, i cant stand being me i dont kno how people can stand being around me... its probably my ability of making people feel tall... ooo this keyboard has special buttons that do special stuff, i want to press them all but i'll probably break soemthing, that tends to happen around me alot... o well i'll expirement later

well this is now officially too long and no one is going to read it ne way so i might as well stop now.. squidness to all...  <*(((<"

"event","this morning i woke up allll alloooonneee, which i'm used to at home, but its strange on vacation because usually my parents are all obssessivecompulisivedisorderness when it comes to going out and doing stuff, so i went upstairs looking for a note or something but i couldn't find one...usually i love being home alone, but here theres nothing to do except maybe run around naked and sing to my secret agent lover man meatwad about the trauma of living apart in secrecy and having to send our bastard children to the care of rabid koalas who eat the cannabalistic leperchauns of guatemala when the sun sets over the bloody wars between the vampire penguins and the pineapples that think they are ancient elephants with leprosy, all because the dump wouldn't take the kids because of their similarity to racoons that look like bush babies....... but i do that all the time at home so i didn't feel like taking it up here... so anyway a couple of hours after i wake up everyone comes home and my mom started yelling at me for being a lazy ass and not going bike riding with them (again), even though i had no idea they had even gone... then she pointed out the note they had left for me on the door to the basement... because that's such an obvious place to leave a note, i had been looking on the kitchen table and the tv room, places where i actually go... so i got pissed off and did what pisses my mom off the most, i made fun of her english...for some reason she gets all defensive when i do that, she's all like well i can speak it better than you can because i actually learned all the correct grammer, so i'm like well that doesn't mean i can understand you... mommy say ""sheet"" hehehe anyway, she got all pissed off and started yelling and then my dad got all upset and he left, and my sister decided it was funny so she made fun of her more, and my brother started crying because ""its scary when u guys fight"", and i think i'm grounded now... i can't really tell though... and my mom threatened to ""sacarte la mierda, hija de puta, pendeja"" which translates roughly to take out your shit, daughter of a whore, pubic-hair...i don't quite understand the logic of ecuadorian insults yet and i've been listening to them my whole life... well we're going to the beach now, my sister won't shut up... woohoo... noooo i dont have a cd player ne more i'm not gonna make it noooooooooooooooo... <*(((<"

"event","i'm at my aunt's house on the cape, family time woohoo (*gag*)... today is my parent's anniversary so my mom decided we had to go on a family biking trip... unfortunately i've had the same bike since 4th grade so needless to say it really sucked- the bike is a 5 speed, but i couldnt even use them because it kept getting caught between gears, the brakes were completely dead, and it kept making wierd noises... the worst part, however, was the fact that my cd player decided to die, and so i couldn't even drown out my brother's complaints or my mom's random spanish insults.... grrrr....  yesterday we went to provincetown, which is always interesting, but kinda sad because all the hottest guys are gay and the hottest women are actually men dressed up as women, and they still look better than i do... but its still so much fun... mmm cant' think of ne thing else... soooo.... <*(((<"

"event","strangely enough, today is my birthday, i'm now 17... and of course the first thing i did as one who can legally get into rated R movies was draw a picture and paint it with my blood...  my second task was burning (literally, with fire and matches and a candle)a few CDs to decorate my ceiling with...  for some reason these new ones came out a bit more twisted and mangled than most of the others in my strange collection... after four CDs the fumes started getting to my head and i felt myself relax, i finally had released most of my aggression and no longer needed to destroy much... and now i'm writing  a live journal, even though i've never kept even a normal journal before... o well i guess i'm done now... don't let killer cockroaches get into your soup...

"event","So remember when I was bitching like hell about horse show classes for <I>people who don't canter</I>?  Right.  If you don't remember, it was 10-23-2013.  But anyway.  <lj-cut text=""Here's more of the same, this time for the 4-H set."">

The PA 4-H horse program just announced the following on facebook: <I>New for 2014 - There will now be Beginner classes available across the state in the PA 4-H Horse Program. This division is intended for the beginner rider who is not yet ready to canter or lope in a horse show setting. Beginner classes include Beginner Western Pleasure, Beginner Western Horsemanship, Beginner English Pleasure, Beginner English Equitation and Beginner Trail. These classes will be offered at the county, district, and state shows.</I>

No.  This is wrong.  We ALREADY HAVE walk-trot English and walk-trot Western at the county round-up level, so that the kids who are not ready for canter have showing opportunities.  There is ABSOLUTELY NO NEED to allow walk-trotters to progress to district and state levels.  If they want to progress, they should fucking learn to canter.  It's not really that difficult.

Demonizing the canter and making it seem super-difficult means that you wind up with adult fucking ""riders"" who do not feel comfortable at the canter.  That is not progress.  This mollycoddling in the endless realm of walk-trot classes fails to produce adults who are competent and confident horsepeople.

What's next, walk-only classes?  For people who feel insecure at the trot, you know, so that they can show and progress.  And we can have lunge-line classes for people who don't think they can navigate show ring traffic at the walk *and* ride at the same time.  Because, y'know, perfect equitation is way more important than being able to steer your animal by yourself.  We could even let folks use a saddle and a barrel (fits ""full QH bars"") so that they can demonstrate their ""at the halt"" equitation competitively, too.  It'd be great for kids whose families can't afford a horse but can support a 55-gallon drum."

"event","Supernatural (television show) is currently eating my brain. It's more fun than it has any right to be. <lj-cut text=""How did this come to pass?"">

I'm not sure how I missed Supernatural, but I totally did.  It existed happily in fandom without having ever hit my radar until December.  Because of the power of internet, however, I have a record of how it happened.  I was talking to Alyse in Facebook.

Alyse: why read not-porn when you could read porn?  i spend all my time reading shit people consider classic lit, if i don't have to read that i want to read the most unintellectual thing possible

Me: Because I want better porn than there is.  Because a lot of shit I read has been written by horny sixteen year olds who, to be honest, do not know a whole lot about, say, blowjobs.  I know an enormous amount about blowjobs* and it irritates me when they're written by people with no actual experience regarding same.  Plus also I can tell.

Alyse:  yes tell me more about rippleing abdominal muscles, adopted children, and awkward first dates.  hahaha i know almost nothing about blow jobs so i do not have this problem

Me:  If I am reading your fic and going ""Yeah, you've never actually done this"" you are failing as an author.

Alyse:  i do hate it when you can't tell what position they're in or if that position is actually physically possible

Me:  Legs don't bend that way!!

Alyse:  exactly!

Me:  I think visual porn (like filmed) is hysterical because of how the people have to be posed so that the camera can see the ""important"" bits.

Alyse:  hahah truth

Me:  It's so awkward.

Alyse:  also the faces

Me:  <-- totally not getting anything done at work today.  And the echo-y noises because this is being filmed in an empty house/room with dirty floors.  Porn outtakes are fun, though.

Alyse:  i just finished the very last thing for one of my classes so i'm riding that high.  oh my god that exisits?  porn outakes is thing?

Me:  (was watching gay (dude) porn a while back and the outtake dialogue was a LOT better than the voiceover shit)

Alyse:  HOW DID I MAKE IT TO 23 AND NOT KNOW

Me:  Hysterical.  ""Two hundred bucks if you let him fuck you harder.""  ""Slap his ass again.""  Lulz.

Alyse:  who do i give my money to?

Me:  I'll see if I can pull up the link.  I think I saw it on fleshbot about six years ago, but very pretty.  (many penises.  I did say that this was gay porn, right?)

Alyse:  it might be worth it for the comic effect, few things are funnier than penises

Me:  And like tv show ""reality"" how real is it anyway?  But it was good fun.

Alyse:  also the tumblr is good for porns if you can deal with the format of the site

Me:  http://gay.fleshbot.com/5115418/pat-bateman-should-lose-his-porn-career-over-this-video see what that does -- looks like it's still live.

Alyse: i should have read the link before i opened that in the library.  sorry people sitting behind me.


Me:  I thought you'd kind of notice that it was about porn.  Gay porn.  That we've been talking about this whole time.  and you'll need sound.  But it is funny.

Alyse:  you would think that wouldn't you?  not the case though

Me:  I'm still enjoying mocking the hell out of Sleepy Hollow (good times!) and enjoying the gratuitous shirtlessness of Arrow.  It's so... wholesome.

Alyse:  i've been curious about Arrow

Me:  Arrow is a CW effort, so superhero plot with sops to youngish female fandom.  It's doing a reasonable job of it.

Alyse:  I love Supernatural in a way that is.. not natural so i am more willing given the cwness of it

Me:  I haven't seen that one yet. 

Alyse:  WATCH SUPERNATURAL

Me:  I also have a soft spot for superhero-ic stories.

Alyse:  you will not be sorry.  it is superhero-esque even if not directly.
demons, angels, hunky dudes

Me:  Like, I don't have any trouble believing that a dude can get away with wearing what is basically a leather hoodie and some green eye shadow yet nobody notices he's the tabloid-favorite rich boy.

Alyse:  no female love intrests

Me:  female love interests are not particularly interesting to me.

Alyse:  well if your suspension of belief is that strong, get on the supernatural band wagon

Me:  (One of the major reasons all the Arrow pr0n is disappointing is that they keep having him fuck women.)

Alyse:  hahah don't worry, supernatural is literally the most homoerotic thing i've ever seen

Me:  (Boring.  Don't like Laurel.  Do like Felicity but we're not going to get that in any way I will find satisfactory.)

Alyse:  be ware though. some of the porn is the two brothers. so.

Me:  Lol.  I laugh at your concern for me.  Seriously, that one actually got an out-loud snicker.

Alyse:  wincest squicks me out

Me:  I do like be ware is two words, though.  Sounds more olde-worlde and impressively portentious that way.

Alyse:  it will be ickier to you when you understand their relationship

Me: Don't worry about me overmuch.

****(Time passes, in which television is watched.)

Me:  supernatural. Are they doing this on *purpose*?  It practically writes itself...

Alyse:  Yes. Just wait till season 4. You wouldn't even believe. The fic writes itself

Me: it's already angst-o-licious.  I am waiting for dinner roll dough to rise, watching tv until my eyes bleed. (wrapped up season 2 today, in which I yelled at the screen repeatedly and explained to nobody in particular that winchester family dynamics are totally screwed up.)

Me, again:  straight dudes just don't angstfully gaze at each other that much.  Also, I have two brothers who have four years between them.  I know a lot about what brothers are like.  This isn't it.

Me:  I am not complaining, just stating for the record that it doesn't look like any brothers I actually know.  (Cass's brothers Waylie and Evan resemble mine and not the spn dudes.)  but yes, it's getting funner as I go along.

On Castiel:  He's delightful.  Has gotten less dick-ish as things have progressed.  (He's offed Uriel, Lilith is dead, and we're reunited the boys, so early in 5.  Cas is currently briefing me about the antichrist.  Whoopie cushions are involved.  Cas really needs clothing besides the trenchcoat.  Does he own other clothes?

Alyse:  Hahahahaha  No we love the trench plus the god clean it

Me:  I think he needs like paper doll outfits.  And he's got great posture.

Alyse:  Divine isn't it?

Me:  I'm having a good time.  The pop culture nods are fun.  The dialogue is appropriately snarky.  Sam (my Sam, not the one on the show) is a bit concerned about my enthusiasm, but he'll work it out.  Oh, and he's an action figure now.  Cas.

"event","Rode mules down into Grand Canyon and then back out again.<lj-cut text=""How'd that go?"">

It was pretty awesome and, as with all vacation activities, you get things you were expecting and things you were not expecting. Let&#39;s look at both of those in more detail.

Things I was expecting:

Lots and lots of scenery. Holy fuck, there was scenery. You just can&#39;t see all the scenery. Way, way too much scenery. It is interesting colors and interesting shapes and it just goes on and on and on.

Hoary, hokey jokes from the guides. (Sample: What do you call a deer with no eyes? No-I-Deer!) The guides running the mules were pretty good and our lead guy was westernly photogenic in a greying-beard sort of way. He also wore leather chinks (probably to help stay warm). But his patter was clearly from the &quot;I flew in from Chicago and boy are my arms tired!&quot; school. &quot;See that rock formation over there that looks like a sombrero? Yeah. That&#39;s Mexican Hat.&quot; Apparently enough mule guides called the one section of S. Kaibab trail &quot;Ooh Ahh&quot; that there&#39;s now a sign referring to it. (I took a picture.)

Hikers with sticks. There were a lot of hikers with sticks. If you didn&#39;t remember to bring your own sticks, the gift shops were all selling hiker sticks so that you could accessorize for the trail. Probably if you pay enough for your sticks they become &quot;trekking poles&quot; but whatever. Still looked like sticks to me.

A river at the bottom. There is indeed a river at the bottom of the Grand Canyon. It is the Colorado River and it&#39;s green. And fast. And, apparently, cold and deadly. There are rather a lot of signs telling people not to swim in the river because of drowning. People still drown there a lot, though. The water is all the time cold because it comes out of the Glen Canyon Dam that makes Lake Powell up near Page and it never gets warm or floods like it used to. (We were in Page for to look at the Antelope Canyon slot canyon and were somewhat confused by all the boats and boat sales and whatnot. It was kind of like driving up past Huntington on 26 and going &quot;What the hell is up with all the boats in the middle of PA?&quot; because you didn&#39;t know that there existed a Lake Raystown. Same deal. Lake Powell is huge and in the middle of the damn desert and it supports a somewhat incongruous large-boat industry in an area that does not look like it should have one.) The Little Colorado River is apparently not dammed and still floods a bit, but nothing like the system used to work.

Fairly narrow pathways. These were narrow, but not nearly as narrow as you might imagine. They&#39;re wide enough for a mule and rider plus also hikers to past alongside. It&#39;s not horrible and a person can walk down comfortably the whole way. (Not me, mind you, but a not-afraid-of-heights person.) I was surprised by the invisibility of the pathway (you cannot see around the switchbacks or where you are going very far ahead because of the geography) but the narrowness was to be expected.

Tourists speaking non-English. Lots of non-English going on, some of which I was able to place and some of which I was not. First time I ever heard spoken Navajo, too. Lots of fun on the language front.

Things I was not expecting:

Ravens. There are a shitload of ravens in the general Grand Canyon area. (We started out thinking they were excessively large crows, but then I googled. They were ravens.) Somehow the ravens go unmentioned, but trust me, there are a lot of them.

Snow. We had snow on parts of the canyon where the sun does not shine. The &quot;South Rim&quot; is the part without the sun, by the way. The North Rim, where there is sun, is closed in the winter. Go figure. It was not deep snow (maybe a decorative inch or two) and it was definitely losing the persistence fight, but there was snow.

Signs about marauding squirrels. Apparently the most common cause of needing-a-doctor in the Grand Canyon is being chewed up by a squirrel. (This is probably because most of the people who fall off the edge or the trail wind up dead.) The tourists feed the squirrels, the squirrels bite the tourists. Lulz abound and there are warning signs.

Ease of falling off the edge. There are safety fences at the common lookout points, like Powell Point or whatever, and there&#39;s a low stone wall right at the village where the hotels are. But for a lot of the rim trail, if you just want to fall your ass right off the edge, you are free to do so. It&#39;s not even terribly difficult to arrange for a 500-foot instant-death splatter landing. The fact that not many people do this is kind of surprising.

Elk. We damn near ran over an elk looking at ruins on the way back from Page. Elk are a lot bigger than deer. We also saw elk at the Grand Canyon while driving to dinner in the little town thing. Also there are nearly-tame Mule Deer at the Phantom Ranch and at the Grand Canyon. Apparently there is no hunting and these critters do not fear the sight of man. It was a little disconcerting.</lj-cut>"

"event","We visited Antelope Canyon (it's a heavily-photographed slot canyon in northern Arizona) yesterday.  It was thirty-five dollars a person for adults and worth it at probably twice the price. <lj-cut text=""Read about what we saw?"">

We are staying in Williams, which is where the Grand Canyon Railway is. This is because we are riding the train (includes simulated robbery event) to the Grand Canyon today.  Antelope Canyon is about three hours distant, or two if you have Lala driving for you.  On the way there, you go through a lot of Arizona scenery, which is more interesting to look at than you probably think.

To get to Antelope Canyon, you drive out of Williams to Flagstaff and then head north on 89 for rather a while.  There is not a lot going on, but once you cross the line into the Navaho nation, you get to spend a lot of time driving through reservation land.  It is eye-opening.

Visible from the road, many of the dwellings are single-wide trailers that have seen better days.  The vehicle of choice is a pickup truck, domestic and older.  There are a lot of dirt roads.  There are not a lot of places to buy groceries or gasoline.  (Cell service is not terrible given the relative density of humans.)  Much of the economy appears to be roadside stands that exist to sell genuine indian artifacts to the people driving by... but those booths were empty because we were visiting in the dead of winter.  Probably in the summer, more is going on with that.

I did not see any reservation land that was not visible from 89, 89T, or 98.  Perhaps the land by the road is less desired and all the really nice houses and thriving business districts are located back rutted dirt roads, out of sight of us.  But that's not the vibe that I got, honestly.

The land itself is not at all like home.  It's not got very many trees and the trees that exist are twisty little junipers (we asked a park ranger).  You can use 'em for firewood, but they definitely aren't timber.  There's a lot of shrubbery, things like mormon tea and rabbitbrush and sage of various kinds.  None of it really screams ""edible"".  Hay, which we have an interest in, goes for twenty dollars a bale.  (It's four or five bucks per where we live.)  To be fair, it was absolutely lovely hay... but not cheap hay.  We saw some pretty skinny horses, as well.

There are elk and coyote, both of which we saw.  There are also rather a lot of crows or ravens, which we don't really know how to tell apart.  If they're crows, they're damn big ones.  Our crows do not get that big.

Antelope Canyon is in Page, more or less.  Because it is on Navajo land, you need to pay for permits and a tour guide to go there.  This is not a racket.  First off, it's not got a paved road to it -- it's a rutted dirt road that gets crappy when it rains.  You really don't want to try driving your rental car there.  Second, it's well worth it to see the damn thing.  Third, they keep you from dying when it rains upstream and water pours through the canyon at forty miles an hour.  They live there and pay attention to the weather locally.  You do not live there and need someone to keep your damn fool self from getting killed by a rainstorm you neither heard nor saw because it was seven miles away.  (Actual event in 1997.)  Pay the tour guide and be glad to do so.

I suspect that it is somewhat busier in the peak season, when the sun is high enough to shine down into the canyon.  (Tour guide said peak season was March - November.)  The sun just does not get that high in December, but the canyon is still beautiful and your experience will be uncrowded and relatively unhurried in the off season.  We looked at the Upper Canyon (there are two sections) because it is a lot more walkable and we had an 8 month old baby in hand.

Tour group was 11 people plus guide, and we did not feel hurried, crowded, or shuffled through.  This is an important consideration because the canyon walls are close enough that you can touch both of them at the same time pretty regularly.  Even if they wanted to, they couldn't get a million people in there.  The canyon has some larger rooms, but mostly it's kind of narrow.  The canyon floor is sand (like a creek bed) and mostly level.  We did run into one other group of people (with tripods) but they were almost done and we just went around them.

If you are in the area, go see the Antelope Canyon.  It's really, really pretty and not like anything you've likely ever seen before.  And it is way better in person, even if you've seen awesome pictures and not just crappy off-season point-n-shoots like this one:

<a href=""http://imgur.com/CoVvk20""><img src=""http://i.imgur.com/CoVvk20l.jpg"" title=""Hosted by imgur.com""/></a>

Unbeknownst to us, Lake Powell is fairly close by.  So we're driving up into Page and there are all these boats.  And we're ""WTF BOATS?!"" because this is, if not a desert, definitely not a place you'd expect to have a lot of boats.  It doesn't look water-enabled, if you know what I mean.  Dusty, dry, orange-red dirt, no trees, lots of rocks.  It looks, quite honestly, kind of like a Roadrunner cartoon if you mentally erase the sage and other shrubberies.  But boats.  Lots and lots of boats.  Boat storage (like at Raystown), boat sales, boat repair.  They are not small boats, either.  These are large boats that need a large body of water, so we were confused until Lake Powell was made clear to us.

Also there is a huge, like ginormous power plant kind of near the slot canyon but it is not going to mess anything up because you can't see it when you're doing the canyon thing."

"event","Busy holiday weekend.  <lj-cut text=""Let me tell you about it..."">

I had turkey at the Horse People and then turkey at my mom's on Thursday.  A lot of turkey was consumed.  After all that, Brother-the-Younger and I fired up the kiln and bisqued my crappy coil pottery.  It did not explode.  Firing the kiln is not a particularly warm activity even though fire is involved.  

Equipped with bisque pottery, now I have to mix up ash glaze, glaze the bisque, and then wait for another kiln-firing episode to see if we can for-real do watertight pottery.  Because that would be awesome, even if it's clear or grey-green.  

In pursuit of more information on ash glazes, I looked up some dude's masters thesis on the internet and he was all bitching about how difficult it was to obtain ""reasonable"" quantities of wood ash.  And I thought to myself, ""This dude does not heat with wood.""  Fortunately, no such difficulties on the availability of wood ash will be experienced on my watch.  :)  Especially not if it keeps being this damn cold.

On Friday, I played wood most of the day to clean up the huge oak tree that had fallen across the road.  (Wednesday we just cut out enough tree to get to work.)  There is still a lot of huge oak tree left to clean up.  :(  It doesn't look like we did shit, but we hauled two full F-250 truckloads of wood over to the horse people's and that should have made more of a dent than it did.  Very discouraging.

On Saturday, I went to a damn cold auction with Brother-the-Younger, who bought an anvil for his blacksmithing.  It was a fairly well-attended damn cold auction down Great Cove Road in McConnellsburg.  There were lots of people in Carhartt overalls because it was damn cold.  I should have worn mine, but instead I was damn cold for three hours.  We didn't stay to see what the 220 acres of valley land bought because three hours is about my limit for being damn cold.

After the auction, I played lathe for the rest of the day.  My shed isn't any warmer than the outside world but there is some windbreak available and when I'm interested, I get less cold.  The auction was not all that interesting to me, whereas lathe is currently white-hot in terms of my personal enthusiasms.

I am busily working on lathe projects for the holiday gift season.  Many people should expect holiday presents that have something of a roundish wooden aspect to them.

White oak bowl/vase thing.  I'm pretty happy with how this came out.  I am not saying it's flawless, but it's a good effort for where I'm at right now, or at least where I was at when I made this.  The problem here is that my skills are improving every time I pick up the tools and I'm getting better at figuring out what sort of design kind of works.  You'd think that would be a happy-making state of affairs, but it is not.  Instead, what happens is that I become dissatisfied with the stuff I have finished (because I will do better next time and I have all these ideas for how to do better next time).  Improvement, for me, brings dissatisfaction.  *sigh*  Anyway, I'm not ever going to be an <I>artist</I> but at this point I have a pretty good shot at not-horrible-craftsperson.  This particular effort is going off to Chez NYR for her house, whether or not she wants it.  It's 100% non-toxically finished in beeswax and mineral oil (both food-grade) so that should the children decide to eat it, there will be no problems.

Bowl, in cherry.  This is my first effort at rim decoration -- there's a bead around the lip of the bowl, and I think it came out pretty well.  The curves on this bowl are better (inside and out) than I've heretofore been doing -- I really worked at that on this effort.  Figuring out what sort of curves look good is a process.  Too, looking at this bowl, I think I can get away with a smaller foot on my bowls and I am going to have to try that going forward.  Finally, I'd like a more obvious transition to the foot of the bowl, like a beaded foot or a curvey dent or something.  That way the foot would look intentional instead of like a clunky afterthought thing.  I'm going to have to try that as well."

"event","As you know, Bob, I do stuff and then I write about it.  Here are some of my thoughts about clay.  <lj-cut text=""I was also an overly busy child."">

Brother-the-younger built a kiln.  It makes pottery into bisque.  It *may* make glazes + bisque into watertight pottery, but that remains to be seen.  Brother-the-younger read up on clay and dug some out of a creek bank in the valley.  He picked the wrong creek but asked me for input following his less-than-optimal experiences and I directed us to the right creek.  Go me!

The both of us wrote to Aunt Charlotte, who has a fine arts degree wherein she apparently learned rather a lot about pottery.  Aunt Charlotte wrote back with sort of a meta-dump of her pottery experience, being cut from the same 'more information is better than less' cloth as the rest of us.  It is preserved here for the edification of us all:

******************

I have lots of suggestions here.  Pots breaking in the kiln result from a variety of errors, and sometimes, they just happen.

When you mine your clay, dry it out completely in small fistfuls.  A sunny spot in a driveway is good, but be mindful of rainy weather.  This will take a couple of days.  Pulverize it and sieve it to remove stones.   Stones cause breaks in the firing process. Now you have a fine, powdered clay.  Save some of the powder; you'll need it for your glaze.  Pour some powder into a bucket of water and allow it to set for another day.  Pour off the excess water and set the clay out on the driveway again to begin drying.  This may take a day, but you need to check on it.  When the clay is firm enough to hold its shape, begin kneading it like making bread, until it's thoroughly mixed and plastic.  You can do this on a counter top, or better yet, on a thick slab of dried plaster.  (Do not let any plastic mix with the clay - it will cause the clay to break too.)  Wrap your clay in heavy plastic trash bags and be sure it is 100% air tight.  It will keep for a month or more.  You can also put it in a plastic paint container for extra insurance, but it's not necessary.  If the clay molds, it's not a problem.  Mold does not survive firing.  You can try adding finely ground sand and vermiculite into the clay when you're kneading (wedging) it to make your clay a bit stronger.  Vermiculite can be found in hardware stores sold separately in bags, and it is added to potting soil for aeration.  Look in the houseplant section.  Vermiculite is silica popcorn - all natural.  

Make your vessels no thicker than 1/2"" anywhere.  Myth has it that air pockets cause pots to break in the kiln.  That's true enough, but the greater problem is clay walls that are too thick.  Heated, excited water in the clay body cannot escape the clay's interior and causes breakage.

When you make your pots, dry them completely.  To test for ""doneness"", close your eyes, pick up your pot, and feel for a sensation of coolness on the bottom.  If the pot is cool, there's still water in the clay.  The clay must be ""bone dry"" to fire successfully.  Usually, in an average room at home, this takes 10-12 days.  Don't try to force the drying process with an oven or hair dryer - you'll have uneven drying.  You can turn the vessel over from time to time to let the bottom dry too.  Bone dry clay is ultra fragile.  Be careful!

I have learned the hard way that clay shatters in kilns when flames touch the pots.  Your pots have to be heated indirectly by hot air.  I don't know what you're setting your pots on, but you might try using an old grill or oven shelf set up on bricks inside your kiln.  Using that, the heat will surround the pots on all sides and will fire more evenly.  Now, you need to surround your pots with something that prevents flames from getting to them.  Old sheet metal, like cookie sheets or license plates will do.  Form  a teepee around the pots, but leave small spaces for air to get through.  You can set the metal directly against the pots.  I would shop for metal cookie sheets or old cook pots at the local Salvation Army store.  You can also buy and use earthenware, unglazed plant pots, the red kind, from your local hardware store.  Set each pot inside the larger, upside down red pot.  Stack your fuel around the pots and begin firing.  You should fire slowly, building up to the hottest temperature after about six hours.  You will need to continue to add fuel as you go.  You want a red-orange glow sustained for about an hour.  Cool down overnight.

You have two choices with surface treatment.  You can burnish your pots with the back of a spoon when the pots are leather hard, that is, when they are somewhat dry and inflexible, but still cool to the touch.  Leather hard clay looks like the original clay mixture; it hasn't lightened in color yet.  Leather hard clay is just past the point where it's flexible.  It's stiff.  You can use a rag with a bit of cooking oil on it to wipe down the pot as you burnish.  Burnishing takes awhile.  You want to really compress the clay by going over and over the surface.  Clay molecules are like shingles - they overlap.  The more you burnish, the tighter the surface.  Burnished pots do not hold water though.   Early cultures applied beeswax inside and out their pots to make them waterproof.  But every culture in the world eventually discovered ash glazes.

Ash glazes have to be applied after the pot has been fired once already, and they make the vessel waterproof and food safe.  Apply the ash glaze, dry overnight.  Fire again.  Don't allow the pots to touch or they will melt together.  Glaze the inside of the vessel, but not the bottom, or else it will melt to anything it sets on.

To make an ash glaze, collect your old wood ashes from your fireplace or your last kiln firing.  Sift the ash to remove bits of charcoal.  Pour the ash gingerly into a bucket of water - you don't want to breath this dust - highly alkaline.  Add some powdered, sifted clay that you made earlier.  The ratio should be 1 part ash to 3 parts clay powder by weight.   Stir, pour off the excess water and allow the glaze to thicken to the consistency of buttermilk.   Brush it on your pot and allow to dry overnight before firing again, the same way as before.  Different kinds of wood make different colored glazes, but mostly, they are clear to gray. 

You can go to YouTube or Google and finds loads of information on pit firing using wood and making and applying ash glazes or burnishing.  Do not believe potters who pile the wood directly on top of their pots.  They are using clay bodies especially formulated for temperature shocks.  Using local clay, you have to heat your pots indirectly.

It sounds to me like you are using a Raku method - removing the pot at maximum temperature and sinking it into flammable material such as leaves or sawdust.  This works best with glazed wares.  A metal trashcan with a lid works well.  Put the organic debris in the trashcan, bury the hot pots in there, and slam on the lid.  The lack of oxygen makes for beautiful effects.  This might be fun with the ash glaze.  There are recipes for Raku glazes online.  You'll need to order supplies from a ceramic supply house.  The Raku process also requires a special clay body to withstand the temperature shock.  I used to buy the clay already made to make sure I had something to show for all my effort.  It may not work with your local clay, and the temperature shock may be at the root of your problem. 

You can get some blackening of the surfaces by filling and surrounding your pots with sawdust, or wrapping them with several layers of newspaper.  You get interesting smokey effects on the surface this way.

You are right about the perils of adding salt to firing pots.  We used to do this at SIU.  Len and I lived in a little house along the railroad tracks.  The salt kiln was about 1/4 mile from our house and along the same tracks.  When they salt fired at night, we would about choke to death from the gases.  Finally, the city closed down the operation and SIU had to build a salt kiln out in the country away from town.

When Aaron was in 5th grade, he had to make a Colonial American handmade product for a history grade.  We made clay pots and fired them in our back yard.  We fired them at a very low temperature in our barbeque grill using wood.  It took us an afternoon to fire.  The clay did not vitrify, that is to say, to mature to a true ceramic product, but his teacher didn't know the difference.  He got an A and got into the newspaper with his little pots.  I know for a fact that I had more fun than he did.

************

Apparently graduate school in fine arts includes rather a lot about pottery.  So, armed with that infodump (and a sorta-sciency book about ash glazes that BtY bought), we set forth.

I started with a shovel and a creek bed.  I dug up the clay.  I dried out the clay and pulverized it and ran it through an old window screen to remove teeny thready tree roots and itty-bitty rocks, of which there were not many.  (We are nothing if not high tech around here, I must say.)  And then I took my clay dust into my house and mixed it up with water (a portion of it) to reconstitute it into clay, in a mixing bowl.  I used the one I also used for food but it's <i>stainless steel</I> and will not suffer any damage from dirt.  I messed with my clay on the kitchen counter, which was not nearly as messy as you are probably thinking.  (Again, just dirt.  Washes off.  Does not have that many germs.)

I have made pots.  They totally suck, being little, lopsided, unbalanced, heavy-looking pots made by coiling little snakes of clay around and around, the same way that eight year olds do.  My pots look pretty much like they were made by an eight year old except that I am forty-three and can understand how fully my pots suck.  Potter satisfaction = low.  (At least stuff I make on the lathe is fucking <i>round</I>.)  I am a beginner and I understand that a lot of my sucking is the fact that I haven't had any occasion to practice my pot-making technique since I was Play-Doh age.  The rest of my suckage is comprised of my complete lack of artistic talent.  (I can kind of manage craft, but I don't have any chops at all for ""art"".  One's delusions on this front get quashed pretty early when one's family includes fine-arts-degreed persons.)

As might be expected, I learned some things en route to ""shitty pots that look like they were made by an eight year old"".  Here is what I learned.

1.  When you go to make stuff with your clay, there is a degree-of-wet that is proper and a degree-of-wet that is WAY TOO MUCH.  The wetness needed is less than you probably think.  Your instincts are going to be wrong.  But, it's OK.  You mix the clay and then you take it out and mash it around with some of the leftover powdered clay and it will get to be the right amount of wet that way.  You want it to be only a little wet and not sticking to everything in huge gobs of sticky icky.

2.  If you heat with a woodstove, the air in your house is going to resemble that of the Sonoran desert.  It is helpful to put a damp paper towel or two over your big lump o' clay to keep it from getting too dry while you're screwing around with your teensy snakes of clay.

3.  A drywall knife is a very helpful tool for moving around clay, cutting off lumps of clay, etc.  A 6"" knife is probably fine.  (We do not have pottery stores or ""art"" stores around here, but we do have a halfway decent hardware store.)

4.  Keep a smallish amount of liquidy water+clay handy to smear things together.  Use a finger or two, it doesn't take a whole lot.

5.  Set aside a five gallon bucket half full of warm water for clean-up so that you don't run clay down the drain.  Septic systems do not like clay.  You can throw the clay-y water outside in the yard when you're done.

6.  If you stick your pot-in-progress to the countertop, it will not come off the countertop very well.  Use parchment paper or a ziplock baggie to set it on -- they are relatively nonporous and pretty flexible so that you can peel 'em off when the pot sets up a little.

If the little misshapen clay pots get dry enough over the holiday weekend, we're going to fire 'em in the kiln with Adult Beverages to hand.  (Also while kiln-ing, we have planned the following experiment:  Can we melt (empty) glass beer bottles into interesting shapes and/or a more-liquid nature?  We really know how to have a good time at chez moi.)"

"event","Got some quality time in on the lathe this weekend, which I had really been missing.  Also, last weekend the weather was warm enough to support playing lathe (the lathe outbuilding is unheated) so that helped a lot.  This weekend Saturday was ok but Sunday was miserably cold.  I played lathe anyway because all the pieces are handy (splitter, chainsaw, bandsaw) for generating blanks that are a reasonable size.

<lj-cut text=""Look at pictures?"">

Playing lathe is a work in progress.  It helps to start with ""Very First Bowls"" so that you can appreciate the fact that I don't suck that much anymore.  So, without further ado, here are bowls #1 and #2. 

<a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/which_chick/9115588598/"" title=""IMG_3011 by which_chick, on Flickr""><img src=""http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3734/9115588598_63515dd3bb.jpg"" width=""500"" height=""375"" alt=""IMG_3011""></a>

In case you could not tell, bowl #2 is on the right, bowl #1 is on the left.  These are green ash.

And then I did some more bowl-shaped things, some of which sucked less.  Here's a sampling of the ""sucking less"" products:

<a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/which_chick/9516096677/"" title=""IMG_3043 by which_chick, on Flickr""><img src=""http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2822/9516096677_a36b6e2a28.jpg"" width=""500"" height=""375"" alt=""IMG_3043""></a>

From left, front row is cherry bowl, cherry bowl, red oak bowl.  Back row is maple goblet, spalted maple pocket bowl, black walnut bowl mk 2(on top), ash box, black walnut bowl mk 1.

These were things that were ""better"" and not quite so beginner as bowl #1 and bowl #2.  A lot of other stuff also got made (but not photographed) along the way.  These, such as they are, represent the successes.

The first thing I made that I was mostly happy with was the black locust bowl that shines golden like the sun.  It looks like this:

<a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/which_chick/11035371626/"" title=""blbowl1 by which_chick, on Flickr""><img src=""http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2809/11035371626_30fea17bef.jpg"" width=""378"" height=""267"" alt=""blbowl1""></a>

I am keeping it.  It makes me happy.  Plus also, black locust is fluorescent under black light.  (No lie.)  It's about 6"" in diameter and about 3"" tall, because scale is difficult in pictures.  It's not *for* anything, just for having.

The second thing I made that I kinda like is another black locust bowl. This one is 5"" diameter and about 3 1/2"" tall.  I was going for kind of a clean, modern line.  Me likey.

And since it is holiday season and I need presents for people, I've started work on that.  Now, my dear friend loves red oak, it's her very favoritest wood in the whole world.  Yeah, I know.  How many of you even have friends with favorite woods?  But here in rednecklandia, we have favorite woods and Lala's favorite wood is red oak, which she thinks smells nice and splits compliantly and is the prettiest and makes excellent heat and so forth and so on.  For what it's worth, I pretty much agree with Lala regarding the virtues of red oak.  It is not, however, as pretty turned as black fucking locust, and who the hell would have ever guessed that?  Not me, cowboy.  But xmas is not about what I think looks the prettiest on the lathe, it's about making people happy.  To that end, we have Bowl, in red oak:

<a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/which_chick/11035380406/"" title=""roakbowl2 by which_chick, on Flickr""><img src=""http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3802/11035380406_cab65b2bf8.jpg"" width=""366"" height=""269"" alt=""roakbowl2""></a>

It's a y-trunk crotch so the grain is interesting.

I should have made it maybe half an inch deeper, but I am a candy-ass and I chickened out.  I need a better way to measure bowl depth anyway.  Here's hoping it does not crack as it dries as a result of the bottom being too thick.

<a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/which_chick/11035290125/"" title=""roakbowl4 by which_chick, on Flickr""><img src=""http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3701/11035290125_66ef9c2f68.jpg"" width=""500"" height=""405"" alt=""roakbowl4""></a>

The bowl measures 7 1/2"" in diameter by 4"" in height.

And there you go, illustrated progress in playing lathe.  Yay!  Wasn't that fun?"

"event","I was not impressed with the most recent (s2e6) episode of Arrow, which is my most current fascination.  The reason for my lack of impressed is mostly what they're doing with Felicity.  (Oliver is Our Hero, Felicity is his Girl Friday, Our Lady of IT.)  It's not a problem that they're dangling unrequited Olicity in front of us.  Everybody likes a good yearn, after all, and that's definitely the kind of fun that House spun out over six freaking seasons.  No harm, no foul there.  My problem is in the way they're doing it.

<lj-cut text=""Read more fandom wankery?"">

Last season we had Laurel, the old girlfriend from *before*.  Laurel is now friendzoned by way of ""It's way too damn complicated"".  This season, it looks like we're playing the Olicity angle.  Okay.  I like Felicity.  She color-coordinates well and she gets good lines, insofar as there are good lines in the thing.  She's also cute and has more than three facial expressions.  I would be rooting for Olicity except that she is so clearly an entire target demographic's stand-in that it pains me to do so.  I feel like my media-savvy chops require me to resist being pandered to so obviously.  (But still.  Felicity deserves Oliver.  They should totally be doing it.  Look.  I'm media-savvy, not made of stone.)

So this season, Oliver has Isabel, a chick who is his 'partner' in Queen Consolidated (Oliver's family's business). She was trying for a leveraged buyout or whatever and didn't quite manage it, so she is now partners with Oliver.  Fair enough.  Isabel is sorta-hostile regarding Our Hero, but apparently not hostile enough to stay out of the sack with him, as we saw (tastefully) in this episode.  Given the entire lack of boning scenery (There was not even shirtlessness, ffs.  We see more Oliver nudity in the club basement than we saw during this hookup.) it's pretty clear that the point of this episode was not voyeuristic entertainment (I feel moved yet again to point out that this show is totally not above voyeuristic entertainment.  They hired a guy who's built like a brick shithouse to portray Our Hero and they're not afraid to use him.  Yay.) but rather to beat up the Felicity/Oliver dynamic in a way that I find kind of offensive.

Oliver bangs Isabel in Russia (they're in Russia this episode) more or less right under Felicity's nose and then has the unmitigated gall (is there ever 'mitigated gall'?  Anyone ever see that used?  Gall is apparently *always* unmitigated.) to tell her that it ""didn't mean anything"" and that ""because of the life he leads, he doesn't feel he can ethically pursue a more-meaningful relationship with someone he could actually care about (with meaningful glance aimed directly at Felicity's heart)."" (I am paraphrasing.)  Felicity then says she thinks he ""deserves better"".

This is bullshit writing of the sort I will accept from fanfic authors because they're, like, twelve.  Where I come from, actual writers-for-television are held to a higher standard than fanfic authors.

Because apparently the writers-for-television are unable to provide Oliver with Better Responses to Felicity's ""Why did you sleep with her, besides the obvious leggy model reasons?"" question, I have provided some below...

1.  ""Isn't that reason enough?""  

2.  ""Stress relief.""

3.  ""We couldn't figure out the hotel's wifi.""

4.  ""She said she didn't have a gag reflex and I couldn't let that statement go unchallenged.""

5.  ""Stock options.""

6.  ""She reminds me of Laurel.""

7.  ""Have you seen that ass?  Seriously, Felicity, you need your eyes checked.""

8.  ""Boredom.  And vodka.""

9.  ""That's an interesting question, Felicity.  Here's another:  What grounds do you have to question <s>where I stick my dick</s> my choice of partners?""

But no, we didn't get any of those gems.  We got ""B/c of Life I Lead, I Don't Deserve A Good Woman (like you).""  ARGH.  Writers, you suck.  You suck a lot."

But sometimes it's not like that.  <lj-cut text=""Read whining?"">

Yesterday at work, we had a guy we know (friend, customer, business associate, contractor) come to connect a sewer line.  While he was there working on the project, he commented on one of our other employees, saying that one day in the summer while he was around, she was wearing a tank top with her tits on display.  He wondered aloud why she didn't just go topless and do things up properly.  (He seemed to feel that it was pointless to put 'em out there halfway where the male gaze couldn't really appreciate them fully.)  *sigh*

First off, she could hear him and hearing him discuss her tits pissed her off.  She felt it was ignorant and low-class of him to speak about her like that.  I feel that if you want to be able to quietly and politely keep on ogling whatever tits and asses you can manage, you had best keep quiet about your ogling so that you don't spook the prey.  But that's just me.

Secondly, that kind of shit generates a hostile workplace environment.  I get along with the man, socially and in a business capacity.  However, now I'm all wondering (as a tit-equipped and tank-top-wearing person) if he talks about me like that when he thinks I can't hear him.  Does he talk about his wife like that when she's out of sight?  How different is my other employee (whose tits are not any more ""out there"" than mine) from me?  Do all tit-equipped persons not have the right to wear tank tops without inviting commentary on our tits?  Seriously, when I wear a tank top, it's because it's fucking hot outside, not because I want men to talk to me about my breasts.  I understand that a fair number of men are gonna *look* at my breasts, such as they are, but I assume and expect that men at large are polite enough to remain mute on the topic unless very specifically invited to comment.

Third, I hate how this situation has two responses and both of them suck.  I can either go all explain-the-patriarchy to people (my dad, my professional plumber of choice, the plumber's helper) who are all dudes and will stand there looking at me like I'm fucking stupid and oversensitive and clearly beset by the problems of my gender OR I can to ignore it/pretend like it's OK.  As a test case, I separated my dad from the herd and explained the problem to him.  He did not understand why it was a problem.  *sigh*  He's kind of unreconstructed, but not an unfair example of how dudes think.

Damn it."

"event","Dear Arabian Horse people:  I'm kinda-sorta stallion shopping for an indefinite time in the future, some years hence (I like to be prepared) and I'm looking at videos and whatnot to see what I like.  News Flash:  You are not doing marketing very well and it's no wonder that your breed registration numbers are in the toilet.

<lj-cut text=""Read more?"">

Let me start by saying that I actually <B>like</b> Arabians.  I ride them, and Arab crosses, near-exclusively.  I have started four purebreds (besides Nick, who makes five) to saddle:  Whims, Peak, Te, and Fiddler.  I feel that I have some idea of what the breed is like.  The arabs I've met have been pretty good horses.  They're typically smart, personable, cute, hardworking (except for Te) -- good solid riding horses.  Some of them have been freaking outstanding in terms of depth, usability, soundness, trustworthiness, etc.  So I am a fan, here, and I'm trying to buy something I already know I like.

In googling, I came upon the <A HREF=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rB2r1C4R6oM"">Scottsdale Stallion Class 7+</A> which, I thought, would contain mature stallions that I could look at and stuff.  Y'know, to see what I liked.  Now, do note that I am already a fan of these horses.  I AM A FAN.  And I was appalled.  Yes, the horses are of quality, but... you do realize that I do not allow my 2 yr old gelding that I have been working with FOR THREE DAYS to behave like that in-hand, right?  Like, it's totally forbidden for him to proceed beyond me.  He is to STAY WITH ME, at all times.  He is NOT to bomb forward and slam into the end of the lead with his head in the air.  That bullshit is totally not allowed.  Obedience is a primary skill.  I want <B>attentive</B> and I want <B>obedient</B>.  If I'm having him circle around me in-hand, I don't want him looking at other horses (or ducks or four-wheelers or lawnmowers or passers-by or anything other than me) and having him bent to the outside while he's doing a circle around me is <B>right out</B>.

Maybe it was just that class?  Then I checked out the <A HREF=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOGdF9dYnMw"">Senior Stallion Championship</A>.  In the first thirty seconds of the video, the exhibitor showing the flashy chestnut with the FINE trot lays his horse down.  In the ring.  LAYS HIM DOWN.  Seriously, Arabian Horse People?  WHAT THE FUCK?!?!?  (Okay, yeah, I have laid down a horse I was handling in-hand.  Multiple times.  Mostly when that happens, the horse is under a year old and rearing up on its hind legs at me in a fit of pique.  Rearing up is totally 100% forbidden, so horses that go up in the air will be put on the ground if I can possibly manage it.  Baby horses that rear can typically be yanked to one side or the other, whereupon they fall over and get up substantially less starchy.  Typically, we like to have the ""rearing-up"" problem fixed before the horses are riding size.)

I thought, possibly, that the problem might be the <I>stallion</I> classes.  So I looked up the <A HREF=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fSuEvHxx3I"">Senior Mare class</A>.  Now, I *own* a senior mare.  Nick's 16.  If she behaved like any of the horses in that class, I would beat her and she would consider that she deserved it.  (Nick is not a halter mare.)

Maybe my problem is that I just don't understand how Arabian halter classes work.  After all, Scottsdale is a big show with very seasoned, quality horses on display. These are very expensive horses that are well-trained and heavily campaigned.  This is what is winning in the show ring, what people spend lots of money and effort and plastic-bags-on-sticks trying to get their horses to do.

And I suppose that when the horses are not spinning out at the end of of the lead, they are displaying lovely movement... but the classes make the horses look like idiots.  I'd really rather see a style of halter class that emphasized displaying good, controlled movement.  I would like to be impressed with the manners and <I>controlled</I> fire of the horse, rather than watch it dance around like an idiot.

So, here I am, Arabian Horse People, a pretty-solid fan of the thing you are selling.  And I go to look at videos of one of the pinnacle shows for the breed.  Looking at the videos, the behavior of the exhibitors and the horses disgusts me.  If I didn't <I>already know</I> that the horses are WAY BETTER THAN THAT... if I didn't already personally know Arabians and how sturdy and useful and kind and smart they were... I'd think they were crazy-assed idiots owned by people who were completely useless on the training and handling fronts.  Your breed shows are doing a serious disservice to the breed you are allegedly promoting.  I should not feel like I have to apologize for the way my breed is shown in halter.  I should not have to explain that the trendy halter style is, yes, disgusting and uncontrolled, but that <I>in spite of the halter style</I> the horses are honestly quite sensible, hardworking, smart, robustly sound, and delightfully fun to ride."

"event","Why I can't talk to men, part 1873.<lj-cut text=""Oh, really?  Do tell."">

Friend facebook posted about ""Free the ta-tas on October 13 to support being against breast cancer""  Setting aside for a moment the question of who is *for* breast cancer, let us address the issue of being braless.

Me:  Yeah, not doing that.

OP (man friend): Well my boobs will be free on Oct 13th! 

Me: You don't typically feel like murdering men who comment upon your nipples. I do. It's really in the interests of safety for all.

OP (he's gay):  I really like it when men play with my nips! Just don't get rough! My right one don't have much feeling anymore since the surgery so they have to get much more rough with that one! 

Me:  I don't mind when invited, pre-screened, approved parties play with same. But if I run around without a bra, random men I do not know or like or feel sexually inclined towards make stupid comments about my nipples. Bras make boobs look ""barbie""-like, featureless and safe (because then I don't have to kill men who thoughtlessly comment on my body). Yay bras.

OP:  Oh yes, uninvited nip play is the worst!

(This is a dude derail.  My complaint is that ""random men I do not know or like or feel sexually inclined towards make stupid comments about my nipples"" and I follow up with ""men who thoughtlessly comment on my body"")

Different man:  with your help, we can defeat UNP <i>(uninvited nipple play)</i> in our life time.

Me:  Apparently the commentary is ""my fault"" for going around braless and inciting commentary by virtue of being female with the audacity to display nipples under my (non-revealing) clothing. So, y'know, bras. It's just easier.

(Attempt to re-focus on the problematic commentary.)

Yet another man:  Jessica<i>(that's me)</i>.. be proud of your boobies...

Me:  I am perfectly happy with my boobies. They're fine. I am not perfectly happy with random men feeling obligated to comment about my body like it's fucking public property while I'm going about my day. It is not cute or flattering to get ""Hey, are you feeling a little chilly? Leave the 'headlights' on? Smugglin' raisins, there, darlin?"" when I am going to the hardware store or showing an apartment or unclogging a toilet or replacing the nozzle on a furnace. I don't want the male gaze. I don't want the commentary. I don't want the immediate assumption that I am sexually available because I have visible nipple silhouettes under my clothing. I don't want to freaking have to devote my life to the thankless task of educating every single man on the planet about the inappropriateness of nipple-related commentary directed at women they don't freaking know. The easiest way to avoid having to deal with the stupid nipple issue is to wear minimally padded soft cup ""t-shirt"" bras that make my tits look like they belong to a nipple-free Barbie. So, that's what I do. But thank you for thinking I am ashamed of or unhappy with my boobs. 'Cause that's totally the reasonable guess, given what I've said prior.

"event","Restaurant Review Time!  <lj-cut text=""I don&#39;t do this often because usually I don&#39;t go anywhere interesting to eat."">

I was going to use google's ""specific url"" search thing to let you know the last time I did an eatery review and linked to it (because that would probably be the Bedford Springs Omni where I went with my cousin Heather for lunch one fine Sunday apparently longer-ago than google would like to remember for me) but since I came up empty at google, I am currently pulling all my lj entries via <a href=""http://hewgill.com/ljdump/"">lj-dump</A> so that I can fucking well search them on my own damn computer using something useful like <a href=""http://tldp.org/LDP/Bash-Beginners-Guide/html/sect_04_02.html"">grep</A>.  I don't have enough lj entries yet for grep to fail me and I can generally come up with something useful for the reg exp part of the grepping because my lj is like Prego -- it's in there and it's all shit I wrote anyway so pretty much I know what's in there.  Not always, but sometimes.

So, while ljdump is finding all my lj entries, we will skip to the review part of the process.  The eatery in question is <a href=""http://www.1009kitchen.com/"">10/09</A>, which is the slightly-confusing (I thought it was 10109 for a while) name of the place.

The place is on Pitt Street, about three doors up from my office.  It's where the candy store used to be and then the short-lived greek place was after that.  Now it's the new Italian-ish joint with the kind of confusing name.  It is a tiny eatery with maybe ten or twelve tables, but this is not a hole in the wall.  Think more jewelbox.  It's very nicely decorated with understated, kinda-classy decor.  (The wine glasses were sexy, linens were actual cloth, everything coordinated, nice white plates in an interesting variety of shapes, very attractive sorta-square soup bowls, good heft to the silverwear, etc.)  Due to the smallish size of the dining area, if you have a loud group in there (The night we were there, a table of about eight or ten very enthusiastic ladies who'd been hitting the wine pretty hard sort of overpowered our efforts at conversation.  They did not seem to realize how rude they were being.) it can get kind of difficult to converse, but the setting is intimate and should typically be very nice for a high-end date night type experience.  It's certainly designed and lit for quiet, intimate dining.

They suggest reservations, and their website is STUPID SIMPLE for reserving, so totally do that.  It's like two clicks.  You don't have to talk to anyone or anything. Probably you can even use a smartphone.  I suggest reservations, too.  We had reservations for 6:30, we showed up at 6:30, and we were greeted and seated at 6:30.  Very efficient.

They don't serve booze b/c of Pennsylvania's arcane and backwards liquor laws, but they let you bring your own booze if you want.  We did not want, so I had water and a lightly-sweetened iced tea, Sam had a water and about three ginger ales.  Dunno about the ginger ale, but the iced tea was perfectly right, not that syrupy shit you usually get, light and crisp rather than the muddy flavor of Lipton.

Menu was pretty reasonable for choices available, especially considering that they don't have that many tables.  There's not a cast of thousands back in the kitchen, but the dinner pacing was very appropriate and we were never waiting long for the next part of our meal.  Whoever's doing the work in the back is quite competent and has excellent time-management skills.  I thought there was plenty selection, anyway, and the menu is online so that you can see what you might like beforehand.  Obviously, if nothing they serve appeals to you, you don't have to got there.

They give you a slack-dough bread with big glassy holes in it right off the bat.  It's very good bread and comes with a delightfully floral and slightly bitter olive oil that is way better than the basic grocery-store kind.  (The olive oil was more on the buttery side than the bitter side.  I could maybe have gone even a tad bit more bitter/peppery and been happy.)  The bread is still warm when you get it and delivered as promptly as it can be baked.  We were offered parmesan (freshly grated) for the olive oil, which we opted for, but on consumption, we did not feel that the parm added a whole lot to the olive oil.  Sam and I thought (in the post-mortem -- if the tab is over fifty bucks, there is a post-mortem for the dining experience.) that maybe a tiny drizzle of balsamic in the bottom of the high-end olive oil bowl would have been a better/more interesting option.  (We had that at an Italian joint in Baltimore's Little Italy, many many years ago.  It was bloody well outstanding.)

Despite being placated with pretty-speedy fresh bread, we also ordered an appetizer to split.  We got the fig flatbread with gorgonzola cheese and the Italian ham I can't spell.  Starts with a P, sorta rhymes with bruschetta.  (I am too lazy to google.)  The figs were dried but not dry, and there was an attractive but not overpowering drizzle of balsamic on top.  It was absolutely wonderful.  It was kind of toasted and warm and melty.  The whole thing was balanced between salty and sweet and rich and nicely crunchy and we were huge fans.  If you go, eat the fig thing.  It's awesome.  Maybe eat two fig things if you're a greedy pig.  Also as an fyi, if you have any desire to use one of your freebie breads to wipe up the remaining balsamic off the plate before it's taken away, hustle up about it because table service is prompt and the tray was whisked away before we'd had that opportunity.  :(  (Classier people than us do not try to sop up the last bits of balsamic so this probably isn't going to be an issue for higher-end diners.)

We then split a ""try the two soups"" thing because an appetizer each plus the very-good bread and olive oil plus a starter each plus an entree each plus a dessert each would have been too much food and thrown the bill over a hundred, which is kind of my limit for ""two people, no liquor"" dining experiences.  (I make eight bucks an hour.  It's a lot of hours to get to a hundred bucks.)  So we got the ""try the two soups"" and split that.  (Waitstaff is not nasty or snooty about people who order one thing and split it.  They are very nice about that.)  Soups were butternut puree and tomato-basil with croutons.  They were quite good.  The butternut was sweet, but autumnal, with hints of citrus (maybe orange zest?  It did not overwhelm, was just subtle and complimentary to the squash), ginger, and nutmeg or clove.  Whatever was in it, it was very good and silky-smooth in texture, garnished with toasted... seeds?  I could have done with more-toasted seeds (Like, browner-toasted, not more in volume of seeds.  I think maybe more toasting would have made a more savory, crunchier contrast to the sweet soup.  Of course, if they're too toasted then they're just charcoaly black and not good... but Indian cooking with hand-toasted spices has taught me that things can get a good deal browner than I'm natively comfortable with and that also there is much flavor at that end of the brown spectrum.) but that's just me.  The tomato-basil was also nicely thick and very good.  If it were me, I would have put bigger, more open-grained croutons in it, perhaps ones made from the same delightful lean bread that we got with the olive oil.  However, the chef may have felt that smaller, daintier croutons suited the bowl better and didn't distract from the soup.  (Probably also people doing fine dining don't want 1"" square massive golden-brown croutons even if I personally adore them.)  Splitting the ""try the two soups"" worked out VERY well for us in terms of portion sizes.  Unfortunately, with the bounty of The Fig Thing (for real, if you go, <i>Eat The Fig Thing</i>) and the soups, we did not get to try one of their salads.  Perhaps next time.

Entrees:  I had the rosemary chicken and Sam had the salmon.  Rosemary chicken was a moderately-sized breast, served skin-on, with shallot/mushroom sauce, on mashed potatoes with brussels sprouts.  Salmon was on green beans (very crisp, baby-size ones) on mashed potatoes with a light sauce that complimented the fish.  I really enjoyed the chicken, which was well-seasoned and perfectly done (moist, but not any hint of raw, skin crispy and delightful, rosemary-ed without being overwhelmed) and nicely paired with the mushroom-shallot sauce.  The mashed potatoes were very good and velvety-smooth.  The brussels sprouts were fresh, not frozen, and cooked to an al dente doneness.  I usually opt forthe baby-sized brussels if possible because they're slightly less bitter on average, but the full-sized ones I was served were quite good.  Also, the slight bitterness went well with the richness of the sauce (like hollandaise goes with curly endive), so no harm no foul.  Sam enjoyed the salmon and the green beans.  He likes his potatoes lumpier (his mom makes them that way) but he ate them all just the same.  Both entrees were well-prepared and quite good, we ate every bit of them.  Portions were <i>very reasonable</I> which was a damn nice change from the ""steak that covers your plate"" excess that too many places do these days.  We DID NOT go away hungry, but we also didn't feel overwhelmed by irrationally large portions.  We felt that we were served just the right amount and we didn't feel like we overdid sharing an appetizer and a soup course to go with our entrees.  (The sanity about portion sizing impressed the living hell out of me.  Two thumbs up.)

We stayed for dessert because my cousin Heather said the desserts were yummy but totally enough to share even though they tell you they're small.  So, we split a dessert.  (Heather was right.  Plenty for two people, especially if you split an appetizer and a first course and eat your whole own entree.)  We did the nutella crepes, which were good but not to my mind outstanding.  The crepes were nicely thin and served warm, with nutella (which is kind of heavy and sweet, but whoever spread it had a light hand so it wasn't overkill with just that and honestly the one mouthful of crepe I got that had molten nutella inside was divine) inside and then crushed hazelnuts and a frangelico sauce on top.  They were garnished with a strawberry, halved, that added a needed touch of color.  (Everything we were served was attractively plated and garnished, btw.  The food not only tastes pretty damn good, it looks quite nice as well and is presented on plates/bowls/trays that are suitably classy without distracting from the food.)  I kind of got the hazelnut theme that the chef was going for, but the overall effect was too sweet for my taste and I wasn't real enthused about the contrasts in texture (crunchy hazelnuts, smooth nutella, sticky frangelico sauce, papery crepe) going on there.  It was a just a bit too much, but we still ate it all.

All in all, this is a much better restaurant than downtown Bedford deserves, a high-end date night location where you can get big city food without driving for two hours.  We spent just about $75 for two people with non-alcoholic beverages, a shared appetizer, a shared soup course, two entrees, and a dessert.

Next time we do dinner out (it'll be a while) I'd like to go to that really nice place down in Berkeley that Sam says is bloody well fantastic (Lot 12).  Not sure it's affordable, but y'know.  Fine dining is fine dining.  Probably I'll have to wear dress-up clothing and everything.

As I mentioned at the outset, we went to the Springs in 2009, review is <a href=""http://which-chick.livejournal.com/478494.html"">here</A> if you'd like to refresh your memory.  We also went to the LifeStyle (they use bizarre capitalization) dinner in <a href=""http://which-chick.livejournal.com/489185.html"">2010</A> which I also reviewed.     And we returned to the Springs in 2010, for <A HREF=""http://which-chick.livejournal.com/505484.html"">dinner</A>.  This (10/09) is a better use of your dining dollars than was lunch at the Springs in 2009 or dinner at the Lifestyle place in 2010 and even a better dinner <I>for less money</I> than dinner at the Springs in 2010.  (Still mad about the wtf raisins, there.)"

"event","Back in high school, I was infuriated by teachers who wanted us to outline and plan and then first-draft and revise and so forth when we were writing a paper.  It seemed like make-work to me but since my teachers typically required us to provide the diagrams and outlines and rough drafts as evidence that we had actually followed the work procedure that was expected of us, I had to write the paper and then generate potemkin workflow evidence to ""prove"" that I'd done it the <I>right</I> way.

<lj-cut text=""I don't have quite the same perspective on this now as I did then."">

These days I look at that sort of thing as a tool that <I>may</I> help other people (and me, very occasionally, when I don't already know what it is that I want to say) organize and straighten out their thoughts so that they can be coherent on paper.  I've always written papers like other people get pregnant and have babies.  Like, there's a flurry of activity at the front end and then a pretty good stretch where it looks like not much is happening and then there's a flurry of activity at the end (typically in school, this was known as <I>the night before the paper was due</I>) involving a substantial amount of unattractive effort (possibly with screaming) at the completion of which I produced the finished product.

The gestational phase of writing a paper does not (in my world) have a whole lot of visible evidence that it's happening.  It does happen, but usually you can't see it and there is no paper trail.  For a while, I thought that having to turn in outlines and rough drafts and stuff was to ""prove"" that you were working on the paper in the middle, gestational phase.  It seemed kind of petty, because I didn't figure it was any business of the instructor how I got from A (the assignment) to B (the paper) as long as it actually happened and was my own work.  (I have never turned in someone else's work as my own.  Ever.)

But these days I look at the instructor's desire for a paper trail (outline, diagram, rough draft, whatever) documenting your paper production process as more a way to ensure that you are <I>practicing</I> the thought-organization tools that have been presented to you in class.  It is not going to fly for a teacher to say, ""Look, you dipshits are mouth-breathing bundles of idiocy.  You can barely compose a coherent text message.  In order to avoid sounding like the idiots that you really are, you need to practice using these tools to organize your thoughts and Imma make you prove to me that you are using them by demanding to see your <I>writing process</I> in order for you to pass the assignment.""  So, they don't tell you why they want you to produce workflow documentation.  They just tell you to produce it.  They tell everyone to produce the workflow documentation because it would not DO for them to say, ""Okay.  Tallie, Jeremiah, Blessing, Rlyeh, and Mary, you need to show all your process because you have no clarity of thought.  David, Remington, Shaniah, and Allie, you need to meet with me and go over your outline before starting to write, but you can skip the rest of it.  Trayvonne, Justinian, Maile, and Cybil, you can just go write the paper because your scary mechanical minds are already orderly enough.  Shantelle, Damien, this exercise is not particularly challenging for you.  Instead, I'd like you to use the research paper format for satire, your choice of subject.""  That sort of thing is entirely unreasonable to expect because it would lead to syllabi that read like ""Students will learn as much as they can in this subject.  Smarter, faster students will learn more.  Dumber students or students who are not as talented at this subject will learn less.  By the end of the year, EVERY student will be able to do the following skills (blah blah blah)""

And hell, if you're going down that road, then you might as well go for unschooling or similar bullshit where you have to perform competently at the end of each year to be promoted, or worse, you have to perform competently In Each Subject in order to be promoted.  And that way lies anarchy."

"event","Went to the PA Ren Faire (Mt. Hope Winery) with the fella yesterday.  Last weekend I went to the Pittsburgh Ren Faire with my cousin and her family.  So, I was hoping for comparison and contrast, of which I have some, but not tons.  There's a smidge amount about Having Your Hair Braided At The Ren Faire, if that might interest you, and a huge rant about long haired little girls and their asshole moms.  <lj-cut text=""Read On?"">

When you go to the faire with different people, you see different things.  When I went with my cousin, we had small kids, so we saw and did some small kid things.  When I went with the fella, we watched a variety of grown-up themed events with dirty songs, etc.  (I happen to think dirty songs are amusing and I particularly enjoy playing ""complete the limerick"" when they are singing limericks.  Limericks are kind of predictable and usually you can tell how the rhyme comes out even if you haven't heard that one before. ""Complete the limerick"" is when I can guess exactly the last line before the performers sing/say it.  My personal best at the game was ""There was a young women from Sader / Who had sex with an alligator / We never knew / The result of that screw / ...."" which I scored in front of a college-age friend's boyfriend when I was thirteen years old.  Go me.)  Anyway, so I didn't look at or do the same things on both weekends and it's relatively difficult to compare ren faires without doing the same stuff.  So, no.

The Pittsburgh Ren Faire felt slightly smaller than the one in Mt. Hope.  It had unpaved pathways and a less-substantial physical plant.  The Mt. Hope faire had better performers (but I also saw more performers, and more ""adult"" performers, while I was there because the fella sits through shows better than a toddler) and a very-complete physical plant with running water toilets instead of portapots.  Both places had overpriced food.  It's a feature.  There was no drinking (by me) at the Pittsburgh faire.  There was drinking by me at the Mt. Hope faire.  This may also have impacted my enjoyment.

Both of them were very passable functions if you enjoy that sort of thing.  The cousin's grade-schooler was kind of overwhelmed by the Pittsburgh faire, and I'm not sure that the Mt. Hope one would have been any better.  There's a lot of stuff going on at any faire and it's just a bit much to be taking in all at once for a kid.  Pittsburgh is cheaper, Mt. Hope felt like it had more to offer.  (I made a pretty solid effort to see/do stuff at Mt. Hope and I did not feel that I'd seen/done everything that was there in the time I spent.)

The Pittsburgh faire was not a themed weekend, as near as I could tell.  I watched a pair of guys doing comedy swordfighting that would have been a lot more funny in the early nineties -- gay jokes just aren't that funny these days, guys.  Times have moved on.  Update your material.  I didn't get to see the jugglers and stuff (though I do enjoy those things) but I did get to wander around a lot more.  I watched the joust stuff (mid-day, not evening -- we didn't stay that long) and that was well-done and gave me a lot of ideas for how to annoy my own horse.  Horses were well-trained and equipped with excellent ground manners and near-infinite patience with being-mauled-by-children.  Knights rode well and with accuracy.  Joust field is well-laid-out and scripting was pretty good.  I also saw a bit of the washing wenches show, which was... not my thing that day.  Perhaps another day I'd have liked it better.

The Mt. Hope faire was doing Pyrate Weekend, which I am all about.  If there is a Pyrate Weekend, I want there to be numerous badly-done Jack Sparrow efforts.  In this, I was not at all disappointed.  I also want there to be pirate humor.  There was. ""How to you get to be a pirate?...  It's easy.  If you want to be, y'arrrr.""  (I did say I'd been drinking.)

I watched a fascinating and informative glass-blowing demonstration.  I watched an ""UNtrained Dog Act"" consisting of high-energy border collies owned by people who had no business owning one high-energy border collie let alone three of 'em.  Fun, but totally disobedient dogs.  I should not expect quality dog training from people wearing motley, I suppose.  I watched comedy knife-throwing, which was fun.  I saw about half of the Human Chess Match, the tail end of the mid-day joust stuff (concluding speeches, the ""We will joust to the death this evening"" thing), some of the falconry show, and the Duo of Woo (very fun, if objectifying of women, which you have to expect).  I did not get to do a lot of walking around and shopping because I was too busy watching shows.

At Mt. Hope, I did spend $27.00 to have my hair braided up more impressively than I normally wear it.  Here's a picture:

<a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/which_chick/9762874972/"" title=""5strandcrown2 by which_chick, on Flickr""><img src=""http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7380/9762874972_bbf3b2e68c.jpg"" width=""500"" height=""462"" alt=""5strandcrown2""></a>

Now, before you start commenting on the amount of grey hair that I have (and there is rather a lot) or about the fact that I'm over forty and have ass-length hair (and?  Do you have a point you're going to make about the suitability of long hair on middle-aged women?  Come closer, so that I can club you senseless with my pipe wrench.) or about the fact that I paid someone to braid my hair but couldn't be bothered to wear something more period than a grey (to match my hair) hoodie sweatshirt, let me go on about the things I actually want to say.

Having your hair braided at the ren faire takes a while, depending on what you get done and how much hair you have to work with.  I had a five-strand dutch braid done that went into a bun in the back.  This was actually one of the less-complicated styles (""more complicated"" stuff had endless twee little decorative braids that take forever to do and are hard to take out without hair damage.  I opted out of those.) that was in the picture book of styles.  The braider was exceedingly skilled, had fantastic hand placement and minimal wasted motion.  Her tensioning was sufficient, even, and painless.  The style held (with gel, pins, and spray) without moving an iota all day.  Well worth the money, in my book, and a first-class job.  There was a sign-in sheet, and I looked at it near the end of the day (I was pretty early in the day).  If you figure an average style was $25.00, she did 20 people that day, for a daily take of $500.  Not too shabby.

While I was there getting my hair done (and waiting to get my hair done), I did see <i>the dark side</i> of being a ren faire braider.  Not to generalize, but... hell, who am I kidding?  I'm going to generalize all over the page, here.  If you are a mom with very short hair (pixie or bob or wedge or that kind of thing) and you bring your 3/4/5/6 year old long-haired daughter to the braider with a VISIBLE RATTY MATTED MESS at the back of her head, you are an asshole and a bad parent.  (Three moms did this while I was there to see it.  There is no excuse for this, you assholes.)  Each time the poor braider touched the child's head with a brush (and she was being very gentle and kindly) the child started screaming like as if the braider were trying to flay the child alive.  There was screaming, plus tears, plus kicking and flailing about.  Three times, three different little girls, none of them older than about six.  This has to be some sort of Asshole Parenting Trend.

Long haired little girls are pretty.  I get that.  They're fucking adorable.  And you, mom with very short hair (all the moms I saw pull this shit had very short hair, above collarbone length), have no idea how to get your little girl's hair under control but you <i>want it to be long</i> because it looks so cute.  YOU ARE AN ASSHOLE.  YOU DESERVE TO BE SHAMED and I am here to do that for you.  Glad to be of service.

Asshole moms, if you would like to do better with your long-haired little girl, read onward.

<b>Item the First</b>  Proper Washing.  You do not let your little girl wad her hair up on top of her head and smash it all around. You teach her to gently scrunch her fingers back from her hairline and down the length of her hair, kind of keeping it orderly, WITHOUT piling it on top of her head and shoving it around. I know that's what you do with your fucking short hair, but long hair needs different treatment.  The incomparable TorrinPaige has a video about how to wash long hair.  It's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzEjdmXaUUU"">here</a>.  Watch the damn video with your little girl.  Since Torrin is blonde, tell your daughter that this is Rapunzel, all grown up (because fairy-tale time was a long time ago) and that this is how she washes her hair.  Practice ""The Rapunzel Way"" of washing her hair with her so that she knows how to do it if she showers alone.  If you help her bathe, then watch the damn video and learn to do it right.  DO NOT turn your child's head upside down under the fucking tub faucet and rinse it all forward.  WHAT ARE YOU, STUPID?  You're never going to get that shit combed out now.  Asshole.  If she's a bath kid, then have a plastic pitcher and have her tilt her head back while you pour the water carefully over the hair with a pitcher.  D'oh.

<b>Item the Second</b>  Braid That Shit For Sleepy Time, Every Night.  If you braid it, it will be a lot easier in the mornings.  Use a simple nape-of-the-neck braid, with only one hairtie, at the bottom of the braid.  Do not send your child to bed with wet or unbraided hair unless you really want a short-haired child.

<b>Item the Third</b>  Invest in a <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Tangle-Teezer-O-HH-010210-Original-Pink/dp/B00264NW7G"">Tangle Teezer brush</a>, a pick, and some damn silicone detangling spray to make the detangling easier.  If you want long hair on your kid, you have to fucking put in the time to care for it.  Long hair is NOT super-difficult, but it needs some management that short hair DOES NOT NEED and the parent has to learn and perform these routines for little girls until they are big enough to do it themselves if the parent wants there to be a long-haired little girl around the place.  

<b>Item the Fourth:</b>  Learn several updo (bun, braid, ponytails, french braid) styles that will allow your little girl to run and frolic and ballet and horse ride and playground and whatever so that she can do all her major-muscle-group activities in spite of her long hair.  I have butt-length long hair and I totally do all the shit I want to do without having hair issues.  Your daughter should be able to do the same.  Also, hair that is up does not tangle.  :)

<b>Item the Fifth</b>  If there are so many tears that you cannot get a comb or brush through your little girl's hair EVERY SINGLE DAY AT LEAST TWICE A DAY, then you are Doing It Wrong.  Admit you are a failure at Parenting A Long-Haired Little Girl, cut that shit off and let her be a pixie until she's old enough to care for it herself.  It's only hair.  Nobody needs endless tears and fighting every morning.  Get over your issues and let the both of you get on with the more important things in life.  If your little girl really, really, really wants long hair, she will eventually be a big girl and she can grow her hair out then."

<lj-cut text=""Read about my hair?"">
In other news, I am attempting to wear my hair up more often.  Up being ""not in a high braided ponytail"" despite the fact that said HBP has been my go-to hairstyle for the last... ten years?  A good long while, anyway.  The problem with the HBP is that my hair (currently hangs to the tops of my jeans pockets) is now long enough that the ends suffer damage and wear from being in the HBP.  My hair didn't used to be long enough for that to be an issue, but now it is.  So, I need new hairstyles.

I'd <A HREF=""http://which-chick.livejournal.com/567051.html"">bitched previously</A> about the dearth of good updos for excessively long hair and so this is a thing, this finding hairstyles for uncommonly long hair.  While gloriously overdone Pentecostal hairdos are awesome, they won't hold up for my life at work or at play.  I need sturdy everyday hair.

Enter Torrin Paige, who has a <A HREF=""http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLF3508F6411A91FDE"">youtube channel</A> chock-full of styles for exceedingly long hair.  She demonstrates them on her own hair, which is well-behaved and impressively thick.  While my hair is not as well-behaved and nowhere near as thick, her videos are clear and helpful.  I particularly like the fact that she does her own hair instead of doing someone else's hair -- being able to see how the hands move when doing one's own hair is very important for me to ""get"" it on my own head.  (This is why <A HREF=""http://www.youtube.com/user/CuteGirlsHairstyles/videos"">CuteGirlsHairstyles</A> does not work well for me.  I do my own hair, not someone else's.  You'd think the problem would be more ""You're over forty and should not be wearing <I>young</I> hairstyles like that."" but no.  The problem is that I can't see how my own hands should be to make the styles.)

So now I have some hairstyles that are stupid simple and hold up well.  The nautilus bun held with one stick is quickly becoming my go-to hairstyle.  This thing is amazing.  It is robust.  It's fast.  It looks nice and tidy.  It's comfortable enough to wear all day.  I also like the braided chinese bun, also with one stick.  It's sturdy, secure, tidy, and a change of pace.  It takes longer due to the braiding part, though.  Today's effort is a cinnabun held with two hair clips.  It feels a bit less secure, but that may be due to the hair clips and lower tension of the hairdo.

Research continues, of course.  If you happen to have excessively long hair (and I know some of you do) and would like more ways to Do Things with it, check out Torrin Paige, who is chipper and upbeat while happily teaching the internet about styling long hair."

"event","Been riding Fiddler for conditioning, so the lathe is getting dusty.  I just can't manage to do everything all the time.  There are only so many hours in the day.

In other news, I'm making an effort to be nicer to my hair.  In pursuit of that goal, I'm all about buns and sticks these days -- they're gentler, more protective hairstyles.  And sort of along the way, I wound up watching Tyra Banks going on about good hair.  <i>Good hair</i> is a term in the African-American world for hair that is more curly/wavy and less nappy.  Nappy is the very tight kinky hair, the texture that is seen as not-so-good, sometimes.

Now, as many of you are probably aware, I do not have African-American hair.  I have dead-straight, baby-fine, boring white girl hair with a complete lack of body.  (I am a white girl, so me having white girl hair makes sense.)  But it came to me, watching Tyra Banks talk about ""Good Hair"" on YouTube with her hair in cornrows, that the amount of worry, expense, effort, and straight-up heartache that far too many black women experience over their hair is about what I would encounter if I tried to make my dead-straight, baby-fine, boring white girl hair act like the more kinky/nappy end of the African-American hair spectrum.  Like, it totally wouldn't work.  My hair wouldn't behave that way even if I processed the hell out of it.  It'd get stiff and dead.  It'd break off.  No matter how much I worked at it, it'd not be nappy or kinky in the same way that natural black hair was.  I could spend a bloody fortune on salon work and still I would not have ""suitable"" hair.  Trying to get my hair to act like kinky or nappy hair would be a hideously difficult proposition, if not downright impossible.  Imagine how much more seriously I would take my hair if I thought I might not get a good job or a promotion if I didn't have ""proper"" hair... or if people judged my worth as a person on my ability to make my own natural straight hair successfully mimic nappy hair... or if maintaining my natural ""straight"" hair was some kind of a political statement that could make people concerned about having me in their church/school/political party/carpool/committee.  Could you get me to agree to sew fake kinky/nappy hair into my head so that I could look more ""correct""?  Probably.

And I am telling you this, not because I think you are terribly interested in good hair or bad hair or Tyra Banks, but because I suspect that at least some of you have never, ever considered why on earth so many black women in the United States have such difficulty and expense with their black hair.  Heck, I went to a black college for four years and never considered the hair issue in the proper light.  (The proper light is <i>Try to imagine how much it would cost and how hard it would be and what arcane chemical processes would be required and how many hours you might have to spend in a salon chair to get limp, straight hair to hold in the sort of afro that comes naturally to kinky/nappy hair.</I>)  So, take a mental stroll in the mindset of an African-American woman who wears processed hair.

It ain't easy and it ain't cheap and maybe there are better things for a black woman to spend her money on."

"event","Lathe.  Lathe, lathe, lathe.  I feel guilty for not doing pony (Fiddler hasn't been conditioned at all yet and I really must get on that.) but lathe is currently white-hot in terms of interesting-ness.

<Lj-cut text=""Read more about lathe?"">

Progress has been made on making bowl-shaped things -- I should upload some pictures -- and I have some fairly large hunks roughed out and drying (for later) so that I can re-turn them in six months or so when they actually get dry.

I've learned about sharpening because sharp tools cut better than dull ones.  Some woods (Black locust) eat up edges a lot faster than other woods, but all woods will eventually blunt the tools, so sharpening is an important skill.  (I use a grinder for sharpening as do most other people who turn wood.  The shed already had a grinder, so this didn't have to be purchased.)

The delights of the band saw became apparent pretty early on, so one has been acquired.  (Band saws make raw lumps of wood more round so that they fit on the lathe better.)

In working with various woods (free woods that are free), I've gotten a bit of a feel for how different species behave and react when turned.  They have personalities.  Black locust's beautiful and strong grain eats tool edges.  Red oak is splitty and prone to tear-out.  Red maple cuts easily and has fine grain.  Cherry takes what you do to it with good grace and smells vaguely of cough syrup.  Ash dries with relatively low distortion.  Walnut turns like butter.  There are lots of other kinds of wood out there, but I'm sticking with the free stuff until I am more capable.  Gotta get to Carnegie Hall first, so my wood supply is (a) stuff we cut down in the woods for firewood (b) stuff that is offcuts at the lumber concentrating yard and (c) stuff that my tenant cuts for firewood/tree trimming.

I've gotten a bit better at the tools and the cuts.  My confidence at making the dovetail recess (where the chuck holds on) on bowls has improved.  My workflow (from log to bowl) is pretty settled, though I still need to come up with a good way to finish the bottoms of bowls once they come off the chuck.  I could maybe do them before chucking, but the occasional catch in the chuck scuffs them up again.  Maybe I should build a longworth chuck out of plywood... but there's time to think about that between now and spring.

Sanding has become an area of interest for me -- beautiful grain is not visible until the surface is smooth, and that means sanding.  Sanding (and turning) makes very small particulates that are bad for lungs, so I got a filter face mask and a big-ass vent fan to pull in fresh air and blow out the dust.

Once things are sanded, they should have a finish applied to them, and again, I'm working on that.  There are a lot of finish choices and I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed by them at the moment.

But all in all, I'm making progress and improving, which is really the important thing.  I'll try to get some pictures up a bit later today."

Horse -- took Nick for a spin today after a week off.  Took along Mia (a different Mia from last year, but again on Mariah) because she'd weeded for an hour in order to be able to play horse.  Any kid who will weed steadily for an hour in 80/80 weather in order to play horse deserves to play horse.  Two rows of the sweet corn look fantastic and if I can keep her going in this direction, the rest of the garden is going to look awesome in short order.

Lathe -- I have bitten the bullet and started on the stool project.  I know, bowls, but I still kinda suck at using the tools and I want to get better.  I also want to make actual things.  I think I can learn to make actual things and get better at using the tools at the same time.  

Hence, the stool.  Stools have lots of skills needed for success but they're not hugely complicated.  Some obvious skills -- making multiple copies of the same thing, figuring out and drilling repeatable angles for the legs, faceplate turning and spindle turning, selecting quarter-sawn wood for the seat and making it joined together to be big enough for a seat (so routing and gluing and clamping and so forth) plus also there's sanding and finishing, etc.  There is a lot to learn and a stool is a project that uses lots of skills (or helpfully illustrates how lacking the skills are as yet).  Oh, and I'm making it out of relatively green ash wood because I have that and it's free."

<lj-cut text=""Learning to turn wood on a lathe.  Via Youtube."">

Upgrades to lathe and lathe equipment have been happening because nothing pisses me off more than things that are incorrect.  The lathe has a 4' fluorescent shop light located directly above it for illumination without annoying shadows. (Plugs in at the moment.  I would like it to have a switched outlet, though.)  The lathe has a rebuilt floor (3/4 plywood faced one way and 1/2 plywood at right angles to the first) so that it wobbles less.  The lathe has a new live (turns, has ball bearings) center instead of the dead center that came with it.

And I've sharpened the tools.  Heck, I've learned what the tools are called and stuff.  The ramp up in learning is pretty damn significant at the outset, one of those graphs like y=x^(1/3) or thereabouts.  I also sent off for other tools so that I could make bowls.  (You need different tools for bowls than you need for spindles.  Here, ""bowl"" means ""thing turned with the grain at right angles to the lathe bed"" and ""spindle"" means ""thing turned with grain parallel to the lathe bed"".)

Here are my tools:

Spindle roughing gouge.  Makes quartered logs round so that you can do things with them.  The first thing you have to do is make things round.  The artsy shit comes later.  First, make it round.

Spindle detail gouge.  Makes nice little cuts in spindles.

Skew chisel (for spindle work).  Can be used to either smooth the wood to a mirror finish or make big ugly gouges in the wood.  Sometimes you get one when you wanted the other.  :(  Persnickety but powerful.

Spear point chisel.  Used for sharp corners and v-shapes.  

These were what came with the lathe, plus also a useless dunno-what that was handmade by someone not a lathe-tool-maker.  There was also a bench chisel that had no business hanging out with the lathe tools.

I should have gotten a parting tool but there wasn't one in the set.  I used the grinder (we already had one in the shed) to repurpose a flat-headed screwdriver.  Parting tools let you cut off something with a nice edge, so that you aren't stuck with the part that was on the lathe center or in the chuck (don't have a chuck) or stuck to the faceplate of the lathe.

In the bought tools, I got some bowl gouges... a littler one and a bigger one and plus also two bowl scrapers, one with a simple profile and one a little more complicated.  Currently they live in their shoddily-made box but I didn't buy them for the box.  They're M2 HSS which is fairly decent tool steel (there are several grades or kinds) but not so expensive as to be beyond my reach.  They ran me about twenty bucks per tool for the set.  (You can spend a lot more than this on tools if you want.  I do not want, particularly when I am freehand sharpening them myself on my grinder that is not slow speed and does not have a fine-grit wheel.  I think it would be a good idea to learn to sharpen well on the less-expensive but service-able tools before I drop a hundred dollars on a bowl gouge.)

The bowl gouges are for gouging out the middles (and outsides) of bowls.  The bowl scrapers are for cleaning up your gouge marks and smoothing the surfaces so that you have less sanding.  Bowl scrapers are less necessary as your gouge technique improves.

Now that I've bored you to death with all of that, here are some pictures.

This is a log being rounded up in the lathe.  It's going to be part of the stool project (I'm building a stool.) but right now it's only ex-firewoood.  I split a log into quarters, split out the sapwood for each quarter, and am here proceeding to turn the leftover round.  I just kind of eyeball the center of mass and throw it on the lathe.  Note grain going in line with lathe bed, so this is ""spindle"" and not ""bowl"".  The tool of choice here is the spindle roughing gouge, the workhorse of ""make-things-round, spindle division"".  This is a piece of ash tree, you can see the rounded surface on the right hand side, where the gouge is cutting wood.  On the left hand side, the dirty brown powdery stuff with tunnels in it, that's the torn up cambium left by the emerald ash borer, illustrating why the tree was dying.

These are two spindles showing me fucking around and trying to learn to use the tools.  In spindle work, tool marks are bad.  You can see tool marks on the left piece (the reddish one, which is cherry from my firewood pile) mostly in the hourglass shape.  The piece on the right is some kind of mystery wood from an apartment tree we cut down.  After two tiny pieces of pine 2x4, these were the first things I did on the lathe.  They're just for practice, to learn how the tools work, what they can and can't do.

And here we have bowls, version 1 (left) and version 2 (right).  These are end-grain bowls (bowl grain was parallel to bed of lathe), which is not really appropriate but is what I happened to have the ability to do at the time.  I should do cross-grain bowls and I will, here directly.  These are small bowls, about 4"" across at the widest part.  They are green wood and will probably split as they dry but since they were intended as practice pieces, I'm pretty OK with that.

That's what I've been doing besides horses.  Lathe stuff."

"event","Summer's almost here.  The days are light until after 8 PM and I've been trying to spend more time not-on-my-ass-in-front-of-a-computer-screen.  It's good for weight loss, good for getting-things-done, good on many fronts.

<lj-cut text=""And what have you been doing INSTEAD of sitting on your ass in front of a computer screen?"">

Well, ponies, of course.  That's going swimmingly. Punch is doing fine, about ready for cantering (should be by the end of the month).  Te put someone off but I have plans to fix the issue that appear to be working.  Fiddler is almost ready for real riding (certainly by the end of the month), and Nick is still talking to me.  I have been neglecting Peake, but I will get back to her.

Aside from ponies, I've gotten the wood lathe in the shed at the lodge up and running.  Turns out (this is a play on words, which I am mentioning for the people who don't know that making shit on a lathe is called <I>turning</I> and not <I>lathe-ing</I> or something.) that once you have a functional lathe (Delta Milwaukee 1460, 12"" max diameter stock, like 40"" bed, outboard center, four speed pulley drive) you want to start making things with it.

On a related note, our ash trees are currently undergoing an extinction event much like the American Chestnut underwent an extinction event in the early 1900's.  Not kidding.  This is a big deal.  There are rather a lot of ash trees in the forests of the northeastern United States and it's a widely used wood.  Emerald ash borer kills ash trees dead extremely quickly and we're talking millions and millions of trees.  *sigh*  

So I have dead/dying ash trees that really cannot be saved.  A homeowner with one ash tree can maybe spray their single specimen ash tree several times a year for the rest of its life to control the borers, but a landowner with hundreds of ash trees is not going to spray the forest several times a year for all eternity to control the borers.  

Some of the ash is going to be firewood.  It makes nice firewood, but it seems a shame for them to all end up ashes given that this is their one and only extinction event.  Also, we have a number of tall, straight, first-rate timber-quality ash trees.  They're not dead yet -- they have a few leaves clinging to them yet -- but the bark is chopped up by the pileated woodpeckers and the cambium is shot (that's what the emerald ash borer eats) and they'll be dead-for-real within the year.  :(

I am going to see what may be made of the ash trees as they are dying.  Hopefully I can learn fast enough to be able to accomplish useful things before the trees are all the way dead.  We shall see."

<lj-cut text=""Enter!"">

We are getting to the part of the year where I eat a more-or-less free vegetable-based diet that comes from assorted gardens.  We're not quite there, yet, but it'll be soon.  

I recently got a huge bag of ""thinnings"" from my mom's illustrious and wonderful collard patch.  (I <3 collard greens.)  So, dinner yesterday and dinner today have been collards-n-bacon.  You fry the bacon, see, then set it aside, pour off most of the grease, and then you sorta steam-fry the baby collards in the rest of the bacon grease until they're edible.  Add some butter and salt, maybe, if it suits you, and then put the bacon back on top before eating.

Baby collards are spicier (a bit) and more tender than grown-up collards.  They are still awesome.

I am also making Roasted Root Vegetables for work lunch.  Rutabagas, carrots, and onions in a roasting pan, with some knobs of butter.  I realize it is not exactly Roasted Root Vegetables season, but I was visited by Random Acts of Rutabagas today.  Allow me to explain.

Trysta's Matt is a useful fellow.  He has lots of guns and is an enthusiastic groundhog killer.  (Groundhogs are not good for the hayfield or the horse legs.  We are anti-groundhog in these parts.)  He came with his very own Bobcat (the piece of machinery, not a felid) and attachments.  And his stepdad (who is a preacher) is somehow involved with the people from the food bank, which results in strange and wonderful food windfalls coming in my general direction.

See, the food bank wants to have and distribute ""fresh produce"" to food bank customers.  (I'm in favor of this.  ""Fresh produce"" is better than canned crap and people who are suffering from food insecurity probably benefit from the better nutrition found in fresh produce, so yay.)  The fly in the ointment, here, is that the food bank receives all kinds of fresh produce, some of which they know (from experience) that food bank visitors will not take.  They do not like to refuse donations of fresh produce, so they accept whatever is given... but when they get, say, half a bushel of perfectly ripe avocados or a box of larger-than-softball-size rutabagas, they know full well that these will need to be rehomed to persons who are not food bank customers.  (They do keep some of the avocados and rutabagas and stuff, to try to hand them out, but nobody ever takes them and the food bank people feel bad about wasting donations/food.)

Apparently, if you are affiliated with the food bank people, they ask you if you know anyone who needs/will eat this strange produce before it goes bad.  (It has a short shelf life, being ""fresh produce""-- so it needs to be rehomed and consumed promptly.)  And Matt's stepdad says ""YES"" because the horse people (his stepson's woman and family and associates) will eat almost anything.  So that's how I wound up with four massive rutabagas and ""all I wanted"" on the ripe avocado front.  (I took four.  I can't eat more than four before they go bad.)  They don't really eat rutabagas, but I do and they know I do, so...  I have four.  Well, three now.  They're freaking huge.  I'm not sure how fast the horse people think I can eat rutabagas, but they wanted me to have ""enough"" to do something with.  :)  (I may try mashing some of them.)  The horse people also got fresh tomatillos (these are not something anyone knows anything about, but hell, they were free) because they seem to think food adventures are like travel, only cheaper.  I didn't have any ideas for the fresh tomatillos, so I didn't take any of those.

On the pony front, I trimmed Wren and Roxy today (feet) and took Te for a spin (noted in previous entry) and Nick for a different spin and worked on my pokeweed initiative.  It was a pretty good day."

"event","Went shopping for pony gear with niece Gwen today, in York.  <lj-cut text=""In other pony-related news..."">

Back down on the farm, Liss took some non-riders out for a ""trail ride"" today, on what she had handy that actually kinda-sorta rode.  The ""safe"" horses (Mariah, Ceres, Roxy, Spice) for non-riders were at the fairgrounds for the 4-H roundup today.  So, Liss used Cheops (follow-along horse, blind in one eye), Bacardi (kinda-sorta rides), Liss on SOMETHING (possibly Jessie, but I didn't ask), and then Te.  Te is not ready for a ""trail ride"" with a sack of potatoes aboard.  She needs some kinda-riders to ride her for a while, so that she gets the hang of the deal.  Right now her whole-life riding experience is me, Olivia 2x for photo ops of about five minutes each, and Trys 1x for half an hour.
 
But whatever.  Liss put a nonrider on her, in a western saddle.  (Te has never worn a western saddle.  Liss does not check saddle fit in anything like an observant sort of way.)  Liss did mention that the horse ""didn't like the saddle"" when being saddled with it but ""walked OK out the driveway with it on"".  I'm gonna have to look at the saddle tomorrow.

I don't know what bridle she put on Te, but she's never worn anything but a full cheek snaffle bit... and she has a teeny dainty little head so the bridle needs to adjust pretty small.  Te has never been ridden with anything other than a draped, loose rein and I am not sure how she would take someone who just hangs on the damn reins all the time.  Making the (reasonable) assumption that Liss grabbed the smallest full-cheek off the rack, the one with the ""game reins"" that don't have slack in 'em unless you shove your hand way forward, that could have been a problem.  

Also, I did Te's feet the other day.  I am not a good do-er of feet.  I am a beginner do-er of feet and sometimes I fucking suck at it.  Te had massively long toes which I removed in accordance with my (possibly insufficient) understanding of foot-trimming.  She wasn't limping when I was done, which I scored as a win... but I am not confident enough in my foot-trimming skills to swear up and down that there might not have been a problem with my trimming.  

I just... THERE ARE A LOT OF UNKNOWNS THERE.  At this stage of the game, I would not have sent that horse out with a non-rider in untested gear for a ""trail ride"" activity.  Liss said ""I wouldn't have done it if I'd had something else in the field to use.""  Er.  You have forty fucking horses standing in the field.  You are unemployed, mostly physically-able, and you know how to break horses.  So, tell me again, why aren't the horses broke?

So, put in that situation, Te violently bucked someone off and ""got away with it"" which is now apparently my problem to fix.  Liss says she just ""looked back and that mare was bucking hard with her head between her knees"" and she has no idea what set her off.  None.  I am going to have to work very, very hard to not be snarky or rude or mean to Liss for making some very questionable choices in putting Te out on a ""trail ride"" with a non-rider in untested gear at this stage of the horse's training.  In addition, I am somewhat miffed about being expected to make a horse ""trail-ride ready"" for non-riders when I am doing this by myself, without any other riders/horses along.  I can't freaking get anyone around to help me the first damn time I swing a leg over a horse, let alone go out on rides with me while I ride a greenie.  If I can't manage ""You ride your good horse while I ride my greenie"" then I don't figure I've got a line of people standing there interested in playing ""You ride the greenie while I ride my good horse."" so I haven't even tried for that.

I need to manage my anger.  I need to try to find out what set the horse off and fix whatever the horse's issue was so that she can go back to work, to learning to be a better riding horse.  She never bucked with me.  She never offered to buck with me.  She never did anything bad like that.  What the hell was going on?  What hole did I leave in her training that led to this?

Damn it."

"event","I recently verified and updated my master list (it's hardcopy) of passwords and usernames.  I have a lot of them, from livejournal and flickr to fitocracy and facebook, thence to reddit, metafilter, amazon and beyond.  There's online banking at three banks, a brokerage account, my EZpass (for the turnpike), my cell phone, my credit card, my gmail, my administrator passwords for home and work computers... all of them allegedly different, all allegedly some monster combination of numbers, letters, special characters, and so forth.

<lj-cut text=""Yeah, right.  Who does that, really?  (Look, at least it's not ponies.)"">

It turns out that there are, for me, passwords that <I>matter</I> and passwords that <I>don't matter</I>.  If you want to post to flickr as ""me"", well, OK.  If you are interested in claiming I do heavy lifts on fitocracy, fine.  If you want to make off with 50K of stock in my brokerage account, not-so-OK.  In fact, that might piss me off pretty seriously.  If you want to buy a shit-ton of books using the 15K of credit card that I have on file with Amazon, yeah, that's a problem too.

The internet recognizes that some security is more important than other security, as well.  As an effort to provide more ""security"", many of my financially-oriented sites have security questions.  Security questions, or (more realistically) ""security"" questions, are a waste of time and space.  First off, the space they suggest for you to use for your answer is insufficient.   Take, for example, ""Year your father was born"" -- for most people, the answer is going to be 19xx. My dad (71) has (currently deceased) parents who were born in 19xx.  I (43) have parents who were born in 19xx.  My brother's son (12) has parents who were born in 19xx.  So, the space that actually varies for the damn answers is the xx part.  That's 99 different things to put in there, which is trivial to get by trial-n-error.  How many answers do you think the cracker person has to decode to figure out that the ""security"" question is ""Year of *event*"" and that *event* happened in the 19xx's?  Ten?  Fifty?  If I got ten straight 19xx answers from a file of ""security"" answers, I would target my brute-force efforts on the 19xx answers, for real.  These guys aren't stupid.

""Security"" questions that don't ask for a year presuppose a rational, word-based answer, typically a short one.  This makes them extremely vulnerable to dictionary attacks.  For ""City you first lived in after college"", once you get a fistful of place names (Philadelphia, Baltimore, Seattle, Chicago, Dallas, Phoenix, etc) then the baddie can focus his or her efforts on ""place names"" of which I am sure there is a database somewhere.

By using words or years, the ""security"" questions are limiting the sorts of answers that one might give.  Sometimes they let you write your own question and answer, which is cute, but still it makes people put in answers that are not very hard to guess.

What's a security-conscious person to do?  I don't have a great answer.  What I currently do for things I actually give a shit about having stolen is use strong(er) passwords, insofar as I am able, answer the ""security"" questions however I like, and keep a paper copy of site/user/pass combinations and ""security"" question answers so that I can get into stuff I don't use *that* frequently.  (My brokerage account, for example, has my Roth IRA in it.  I visit it about 3x a year.  I do not need ""instant"" access to it.)  And I have a complicated gmail password that *sigh* I have brute-forced into my head so that I have it.

Strong(er) passwords:  more than fifteen characters, including numbers, letters, capital letters, and non-alphanumeric characters like ; or , or &.  They do not contain any combination of letters that makes a word or any ""l33t"" spelling.  They are ""randomly"" generated by virtue of me opening a magazine and taking the first letters and punctuation of a paragraph, with some numbers and crap thrown in there if not enough occurs naturally.  So, for example, a good password from the June 2013 issue of Equus would be <I>tro7T dwCatc,ws.Tds21</I>  (Sample password.  Not used for any of my accounts... but mine look rather like that.)

""Security"" answers:  They look rather like the strong(er) passwords.  If the question is asking for a date, I do not give it a date.  Ever.  If the question asks for a name, I do not give a name.  So, for example, if the site asks for ""favorite flavor of ice cream"", I put in something along the lines of <I>TLRos fAbt32yor,wtp dh,</I>.  I have yet to come upon ""security"" questions that make sure your answer is consistent with the question asked.  Like, if it says ""What year was your mother born?"" and you put in <I>TLRos fAbt32yor,wtp dh,</I> it never ever says back ""That is not a year.  Please enter a year.""  There's no sanity-checking for security questions, so do what you like with them.

I keep two paper copies of the master password list, one at the office and one at my house.  They're handwritten and photocopied and not particularly find-able, given the state of my housekeeping.  I realize that this is not particularly ideal, but it's how I roll.

Finally, for ease-of-life, I just don't give a shit about things that don't have money attached to them.  You could crack my facebook or my livejournal or my ao^3 or my reddit if you really wanted.  The passwords I use for that sort of thing aren't that hard to guess and I re-use 'em all the time (there are three that I cycle through).    Good luck getting into my gmail, though."

<lj-cut text=""A Pony-Free Post!"">

The beaver (legs and skull and two vertebrae, which was all that was left after the horrible ribcage theft incident) has been quietly decomposing in a lidded plastic bucket of water.  Said water has been changed as and when I felt up to dealing with the absolutely horrific smell of rotting flesh, which sticks to ones hands and is probably the substance that the word ""redolent"" was invented for.  But anyway, I've been busy playing horse here of late and haven't attended to the bucket of beaver for a while.  It's a white drywall paste bucket, so three and a half gallons or so, but more importantly, a very slightly translucently-white so that you can see if there's anything inside... like maybe suspiciously wine-colored water and random beaver remains that you have ignored for several weeks including a week of high-eighties daytime temperatures.

I poured out the wine-colored water (redolent.  scent still sticking to my hands even after a round of citrus-flavor GoJo industrial hand cleaner) and looked at the bones.  Pretty much we're down to bones, here.  Yay!  The rest of what was there (excepting some very tenacious ligaments) dissolved into the water, coloring it like a fine burgundy.  (Did not smell like a fine burgundy.)  Okay.  Time for fresh air and sunshine.

The smell of dead things eventually goes away.  If it did not, we would live in a world that smelled like zombies LOOK LIKE they smell.  I am of the opinion that fresh air and sunshine is what makes the smell of dead go away, so I have put the bones (there are a metric shit-ton of Very Small Bone Pieces in beaver feet.  I'm just sayin'.) on a piece of window screening, up off the ground on a pair of 4x4 boards and then covered that with a sheet of hardware cloth weighted down with three concrete blocks so that hopefully nothing can get in it and steal the damn bones which have no meat on them at all now anyway.  And that's in the middle of my tomato plants, in a fenced area.  Here's hoping nothing steals the damn bones which are now hopefully going to bleach to pristine and UNSCENTED whiteness in the fresh air and sunshine.

Eric may have bones by August, after all.  I'm off to scrub my hands again.  Ew.

In other news, there's a rosebush in Bedford that I envy.  I would like one for my very own.  I wonder if they would notice me cutting off a small piece to try to root.  (Plant is antique, not patented.)"

<lj-cut text=""In other, horse-related news..."">

I drug stuff (sticks, boards, broken fenceposts, bale string) out of the field and set it on fire.  A lot.  I like fire. I like fields with less crap in them.  It is sort of exercise-ish, this dragging of stuff.  So, huge amounts of win going on.

While I was doing that, I noticed the fairly large number of concrete blocks cluttering up the area below the run-in portion of the barn.  (Okay, they've been there for a lot more than sixteen years.  I did not <I>just now</I> notice them.   They've been pissing me off since the mid-nineties.) The concrete-blockscape is a steep hillside, but walkable, mostly covered in pokeweed and slightly-used concrete blocks with random hunks of scrap metal and dead roofing tin in the mix for flavor.  Now, I hate pokeweed.  A lot.  I also hate the blocks that are scattered about.  They're unsightly and take up surface area that could be used for growing grass.

Since nobody else has done jack fuck-all with the cement blocks and pokeweed problem since the mid-nineties (it is possible that nobody but me really cares about the blocks and pokeweed), I inquired today of La if it would be OK if I started removing the blocks from the field and doing something with them along with my dedicated pokeweed eradication project (about which a bit more below when I'm done talking about concrete blocks).  She said sure.

I am not really sure what I am going to be doing with the blocks, but I will think of something.  We sure could use ""gravel"" in the gate area of the upper field.  It'd be really nice if we had ""free gravel"" for that project.  It might solve some of the mud problem.  We could also put some ""free gravel"" around the water troughs so that they're not sinks of mud all the time.  We could maybe break up the concrete blocks with a sledge hammer or something.  I'll have to experiment and see what works.

Right now, I'm removing the blocks from the dirt (some of them are partially buried) and lugging them up the fairly steep hill and lobbing them over the fence (chest-high) out of the field.  I'm making kind of a pile, out of the way, while I consider my options as to what to do with the blocks.  (As mentioned above, the blocks are somewhat used, as in ""have mortar and cement on them"" and most are broken.  They'd been used to make a flat platform retaining wall thing back in the dairy farm days of the horse people's farm.  Once the dairy cows were gone, the platform fell to the elements and, subsequently, to pieces.  Gravity being what it is, the concrete blocks went in a downhillwardly sort of direction, which is why I am lugging them up the hill.  The field is also adjacent to another field except at the top of said hill, so if I lobbed the blocks over the fence anywhere but at the top of the hill, they would land in another field... not really the improvement I am hoping for.  I am only good for about ten or so of these a day -- they're reasonably heavy and it's a trek up the hill with 'em -- but that's progress and better than anyone else is managing.  Once I get all the blocks out of the field, I'll see what can be done with them.

Anyway, block removal is only incidental to the pokeweed removal project, though.  Pokeweed is a native plant species, an herbaceous-stemmed thing that nonetheless manages to make huge clumps of weed, some of them taller than a person, with more-than-1""-thick stems and dangling clusters of very purple berries that are poisonous.  It also has massively a huge taproot and comes back more often than Snappy Answers to Stupid Questions.

Since the field has, y'know, horses in it, I am not real interested in pesticides.  I am going to follow a non-pesticide approach to get rid of the pokeweed.  First, I am going to cut it down to the ground.  Second, I am going to wait for it to grow back and then cut it down again.  And maybe a third time.  Then I'm going to dig up its damn tap root and burn it.  We'll see how that goes."

"event","More horses.  I foreshadowed <I>horses all the way down</I> when the weather got nice and there was a reason for that.

<lj-cut text=""I wasn't kidding."">

I took Punch for a spin yesterday after work.  Someone was doing some sort of bizarrely loud machinery operating (sounded maybe like an atv) down in the holler, which made her tight.  I got off and walked a bit, until that went away.  She settled down some so we walked halfway around the buckwheat field until my helmet hit a branch, which upset her (the noise) and she leaped forward.  I got her re-settled down again and we practiced hitting the helmet on branches some more until it wasn't an issue.  And then coming up out of the holler to home, we encountered a groundhog.  Now, I know it's a groundhog because I've seen it before and I know it dens there.  Punch just saw/heard the tall grass rustling suspiciously.  Apparently it was very suspicious rustling.  She about blew a gasket.  

Note to self:  Punch's circles are not very effective when the entire horse is rigid like a board.  *sigh*  It was not one of our more relaxing outings and there was no intentional trotting.  On the plus side, there was no actual bad horse behavior and nobody died.  Just... it was tight and sudden and she never really settled all the way back down.

After that was Fiddler, who is doing a lot better at a variety of skills.  He's softer, faster, when I've hopped on him.  He bends better (neck) at bend-to-a-halt, he walks forward better when we're going forward, etc.  His whole body is more relaxed and his expression is nicer about the whole thing.  He's getting the idea.  He is still wobbly, particularly when I get on him.  This is probably at least partly due to the fact that he's a narrow little drink of water and I'm a hundred and sixty pounds of torque on him when I hop aboard.  (Still haven't tried getting on the wrong side.  I need to do this.)  Also, he is not really ready (balance) to trot out yet.  He's still too wobbly.  It takes the time it takes, I guess.

Also, both Punch and Fiddler have learned to ground-tie for reasonable amounts of time (two big circles around the horse, walked slowly, plus also some leaning against the pickup truck), which seems to have done wonders for their mindset.  If they can pay attention to me and hold still long enough to not-move for this, they are probably OK for getting on and riding.  I am kind of a fan of this skill.  It's easy to teach and good for their minds.

The entirety of the riding gig is related to respect.  If you have respect (and it is easier to get it on the ground than it is to get it on the back), you are not going to have near the problems that you might otherwise have.  Even if shit gets real, because the horse respects you, he will look to you for a solution to his woes.  Respect does not mean just beating the horse.  That doesn't work, exactly.  Respect means defending your personal space bubble, not letting the horse move you around, shoulder you out of the way, or make decisions regarding what he is doing when you're with him.  Seriously, he has like 23 hours of the day to do whatever he wants.  Expecting him to pay attention to you for about an hour a day is NOT an undue burden.  Also, horses are hierarchical.  Unless you're riding a boss mare, they're pretty OK with having to do what other horses say, 24-7, because they don't know any different.

So I get Fiddler out of the field and lead him up to the hitching post (for real, we have one) and tie him up, long enough to eat from the feed pan on the ground before him.  I go and get his feed (can't put it out ahead of time because random marauding calves would eat it before we got there) and make him step back from the feed pan before I pour his feed in.  I do not like being crowded or having to pour feed around the horse's nose.  It's a little thing to me, but it's a respect thing for Fiddler.  Making him step back, at this point, consists of a stern look, but if he didn't respect the look, I would have to enforce it as needed.

Also, I would totally fail Horsemanship Skills like in 4-H.  I was watching La train some hapless child on Horsemanship Skills the other day and realizing that I totally sucked at it.  Like, you're not ALLOWED to let go of the horse when you're bridling it.  Ever.  You're supposed to have a neck rope on the horse after you drop the halter and you are supposed to be HOLDING that neck rope while you are bridling the horse.  I cannot bridle a horse one-handed, so I don't know how eight year olds can do it.  As for me, I have the reins (loop reins) over the head of the horse before I drop the halter and the horse doesn't wander off because I will beat him if he does that and we both know it.  (Ropes in the mind are better than ropes in the real world because you don't have to hold onto the ropes in the mind.)  So I am there with the reins over the neck, headstall in one hand, bit in the other.  No hand is holding the horse.  Horsemanship fail.  But, I can't help but think there are a lot of disrespectful horses out there walking off from children who are trying to do things with them...

And I get off the horse wrong, every time.  EVERY TIME.  I get off the horse wrong.  Correct:  Remove right foot from stirrup.  Swing it over horse's butt while putting belly on saddle and removing left foot from stirrup.  Then, drop body to ground kind of along the body of the horse.  Incorrect:  Remove both feet from stirrups.  Lean forward, swing either right or left leg over butt of horse, land on ground.  It's very smooth, fast, and works fine.  But it's wrong.
  
Part of me is secretly thankful that Horsemanship Skills didn't exist back when I did 4-H.  I realize that they are helpful and worthwhile and provide a solid foundation for kids, but I would totally have hated Horsemanship Skills testing and its rather rigid insistence on the One True Way of doing things."

"event","Te and Nick for horse today.  <lj-cut text=""Read more?"">

Te and Peake (the ungrateful babies) are now on a 2x per week or 1x per week schedule.  The deal is that they each get ridden AT LEAST 1x per week.  3x a week is Ungrateful/Nick, 3x a week is Punch/Fiddler.  So, one week it'll be Peake 2x, the next week it'll be Te 2x.  The reason for this rota is to make sure that the ungratefuls are being currently ridden and do not need to be ""tuned up"" so that they can be sold.  They are currently in work and doing regular rides.  Nick is 3x a week because I actually like her.  And Punch/Fiddler are 3x a week because they need to be riding horses.

I am going to eventually run out of time/energy for as many horses as need to be regularly ridden.  But, Peake and Te still need practice -- they've only been cantering under saddle for a few weeks.  They need more outings.  I figure I can string them along until Fiddler and Punch canter under saddle reliably and then they can fade to 1x per month riding.  (It would REALLY be nice if someone else would help me ride the damn things once they were more-or-less broke.)

Te is... non-forward.  She has this pitifully slow and tiresome walk.  I just don't have time for it.  It's fucking boring, it is.  I realize that it was eighty-five degrees out today and all, but Nick walked like she always does (she has a Going Places walk -- it's nice) in spite of the heat.  I don't see why Te can't do that.  Peake Goes Places at the walk.  So does Punch.  I like an active walk on critters.  Unfortunately, I don't know how to GET an active walk on critters.  Mostly, they just have 'em out of the box.  I don't have a dead sack-of-potatoes seat, I am active and responsive and rhythmic up there.  But Te just... ambles along.  She picks up the trot easily enough, but her walk is so damn dawdle-y.  *argh*  I need to find out some way to improve the situation.

Nick was fine,though I really wish they'd mow the buckwheat field.  It's asking a lot to have Nick trot around the perimeter as the heads of timothy <I>hit her in the chin</I> and not get to eat any of it."

"event","Pony updates, totally interesting, I know.  <lj-cut text=""Click to read"">

Today I took Punch for her second spin over across the road to the exciting land of the buckwheat field.  I haven't actually ridden her around the buckwheat field because the grass is chin-high and I don't know that she really gets the whole 'riding' gig well enough to tolerate not-being-allowed-to-eat when the grass is chin-high.  We just go up to the buckwheat field and then back down again.

Today we did a hill and a half with two nice sets of sustained trotting.  She was reasonable, not overly forward, and rated pretty well.  She did engage in the lookie-lou and wandering behavior of green horses, but nothing bad happened.  We saw a fox on our way back up out the holler, but Reynard regarded us and departed the field of combat uneventfully without causing Punch to even raise an eyebrow.  As for me, I enjoyed the fox portion of the program.

Interestingly, Punch seems convinced that I am going to whack her in the teeth with the bit.  She clenches her teeth tight and raises her head during unbridling which makes it more difficult to not-whack-her-teeth.  Sigh.  Remedial work on that is needed.  I don't know if I whacked her once by accident (usually I'm quite careful about this) or what, but she is now convinced that bad things happen on unbridling.  :(  

I don't know how many more rides Punch needs to be canter-worthy, but I do like them to have several very solid walk-trot outings before I get all excited about cantering.  We'll see as we go onward.  The nice hot weather we've been having is awesome for making progress.  Nobody wants to be throwing a fit in this heat, far easier to just do what I want.

As for Fiddler, he's getting a little better at driveway riding, but he's not ready for crossing the road yet.  His turns need work and his body is still too tight.  On the plus side, I got on him without the help of a bucket today.  It is honestly hysterical how many times he sighs as a put-upon critter, though.  His life is so rough...

"event","(Ponies) I took Punch on her first real ride yesterday.  It went great.  

<lj-cut text=""Let me tell you how."">

I've been over the four super-basic skills you need for throwing a leg over -- start, stop, turn left, turn right.  When a horse has those and only those, he is not ready for ""real"" rides over across the road and up into the open fields.  Seriously, in two minutes, any horse can be doing those when you're on him.  Bare competence at the basic four are not enough for ""real"" rides.

Fiddler, for example, has the basic four.  You can get on him and sit on him and he's pretty OK with that as long as you work up to it sensibly -- he still likes a little foreplay first.  He'll walk forward (uncertainly and wobbling) if you wiggle and click enough.  But, he'll drift to a halt after five or six steps because he isn't entirely confident that ""go"" means go-and-keep-going-until-I-tell-you-to-stop.  He turns sorta-OK but he's stickier to the right and won't let go of his poll most of the time on the first try.  So, that's not real good yet, either.  Fiddler is a horse that needs more practice and repetition of the basics in the relatively confined and non-threatening space of the dooryard/driveway where there are people around and immediately to hand to see/save me in the event of difficulty.  (Posh folks would still be working him in the round pen.)

Punch has the basic four.  You can saddle her up and pretty much swing a leg over.  She knows the drill.  She turns left and right quite well, has a fine and non-pissy one rein stop, and walks out steadily and confidently.  She knows that go means ""go and keep on going"" and she does that in an unworried and capable manner.  She knows that ""go more"" when we're already going means ""pick up a trot"".  Punch is ready for across the road ""real"" rides.

So, last week I tried the pilot ride.  This is a short excursion to the land of the pear tree, across the road and up the hill.  Mostly, the horses have been there in-hand so they know about it.  It is not out of sight of the home fields, so the horses do not get super weird about being alone. (Not all horses give a shit about their buddies.  Some horses automatically know that ""work time"" means doing what I say and not caring so much about the buddies.  Other horses need specific practice at this skill.)  Generally, I make a human being (on foot) walk along with me so that I have company.  The human being is not really there to lead the horse or save me or anything like that.  The human being is there to provide reassuring and distracting dialogue for me.  That was a total snooze for Punch. 

There were a lot of circles on the way to the pear tree, but circles happen when beginner stepping-out horses go into the big world.  Punch doesn't know the ""don't trot unless I ask you to do so"" rule.  So, she offers me trot. I do not want trot, so we circle-halt and then we try to walk again.  If she trots, we circle-halt and try again.  It is very important for the human to not get nasty about this -- different species, grapefruit-sized brain, yadda yadda yadda.  If Punch is trotting instead of walking (and my posture and legs and stuff all say ""walk"") then it is clear that she does not know the rule.  Getting angry is not a helpful approach to solving the problem.  However, TEACHING THE RULE is helpful.

With a successful pilot ride under our belts, I took Punch out for a real ride yesterday.  We went up over the hill past the pear tree and down into the hollow and up to the buckwheat field and then back home again.  It took just about thirty minutes, which was the time frame I'd given my at-home people ready to save me.  ""Hey, if you don't see me back in half an hour, come a-looking.  Also, if horse comes home dragging the reins and wearing an empty saddle, come find me and call the ambulance/coroner, as appropriate.""  I honestly do not expect to die on the first real ride, but it is a possibility.

Right now, we have turning, walking forward fairly confidently, picking up a trot on request and holding it pretty well, halt, and back up.  We don't have ""stay on the road"" or ""thou shalt not attempt to eat whilst being ridden"" but that sort of stuff comes online through exposure."

"event","More thoughts on breaking horses.

<lj-cut text=""I know how applicable this is to the daily lives of most of my lexience."">

So you have (continuing from last time) the rudiments of steering installed on a horse that is comfortable with someone standing on a bucket, leaning over his back, and petting him while putting (some) weight in the saddle.  He stands there on a slack lead and doesn't take any steps.  His head and neck are relaxed, his eye is calm, and he seems entirely unimpressed by the proceedings.  He's easy to tack up and has seen the bridle/saddle enough times to not be interested in them anymore.

This is a horse that a forty-year-old might be interested in throwing a leg over.  Generally I do a certain amount of riding readiness from the ground before swinging a leg over.  Riding readiness includes the rider doing the following things... pick up the stirrups, flop them around a bit, put some weight -- using one's hand -- in the stirrup, rock the horse slightly off balance while standing in the ""getting on"" position (both sides) until the horse spreads his front feet and braces slightly to resist the rocking motion.  And then I get on using a bucket (or mounting block, if you're being posh) for the first couple of tries.  In a few days, I switch to regular mounting.

When you've swung a leg over and are sitting on the critter, pet his neck.  Talk to him.  Make sure he knows you're up there.  Once he is soft and relaxed in his body, you can pick up a rein and practice turning his head to each side (like you did from the ground).  He should keep his feet still for this part.  Keep it short, and get off again.  Give him a little bit of a break, lead him around a little, and then get on him again.  Repeat what you did the last time.  Maybe practice some one-rein-stops from your turning.  If those are OK, you can ask (gently) for some steps forward.  Sometimes green horses are a little sticky, like they don't know that they can walk out.  If you have one of that kind, sort of wiggle your butt and ask gently with a click or whatever for moving forward.  Be persistant, but don't up the voltage.  (This may take two minutes or so.)  If, after a reasonable interval, nothing looks to be happening, you can have a helper lead you out the driveway and back or whatever.  And then try again.

The first couple of rides are very much short, basic, and (hopefully) uneventful.  Get on, walk a bit, turn left and turn right, halt.  Stand.  Walk on.  Right turn in a circle.  Left turn in a circle.  Walk on. Stop. Stand. Walk on.  First rides are not more than five or ten minutes.  They should not have difficult questions that the horse does not have much hope of getting correct.  You want four skills.  Start.  Stop.  Left.  Right.  Horse should know all of these from ground work, so the ""new"" part isn't what to do, it's ""halp, a human is sitting on me"".

Once you feel pretty good about the first four skills (start, stop, left, right) then you can add back & trot.  (Seriously, back.  My horses back up on ride three or four. Early on, and quietly.)  With these six, you can go on rides, like real ones, out in the big, wide world.

"event","Many things to talk about today.  Cake and frosting.  Best time to visit the ER.  Boring first real ride on a horse (as it has mostly sort of stopped with the endless rain).  

<lj-cut text=""Let's get started!"">

Cake and frosting.  Research is proceeding on the Ur-yellow-cake with Ur-chocolate frosting project.  I think I have a winner on the cake front.  As suggested when last we met regarding cake, the Cooks Illustrated folks pulled through with a Fluffy Yellow Layer Cake that is delightful.  It rocks.  I used the recipe found <A HREF=""http://www.crumblycookie.net/2011/02/10/yellow-cake-comparison/"">here</A> in case you would like to play along at home.  The frosting selected for this go-round was a boiled flour frosting which did surprisingly well.  The recipe for that is <A HREF=""http://www.ourbestbites.com/2010/05/chocolate-frosting/"">here</A> and it is good, but not quite what I have in mind as the Ur-frosting.  Too fluffy.  Sweetness about right, chocolate-y-ness was spot-on, but it was too fluffy.  More research on those lines is needed.  Maybe I did it wrong, maybe I need more of a buttercream thing.  I'll get back to that again sometime, right now I am tired of cakes and their frostings.

The best time to visit the ER is when no other patients are there.  This is most easily achieved in a small rural ER on a quiet Sunday morning.  I know this because Brother the Younger had some cub scouts (and their families) out for a camping extravaganza near my house this past weekend.  The cub scouts (and their families) reside (normally) in the greater York metropolitan area and, as such, are used to the normal safeguards of playground equipment in a world where torts are a way of life.  

In particular, they are used to thick mulch on the ground and castrated merry-go-rounds that don't go fast enough to make anyone dizzy.  Lame.  I do not often discuss it, but we have a merry-go-round, an old one.  It is at least as old as I am and we have had it for as long as I can remember.  It suspends eight benches from poles and it goes <I>really fast</I> without undue effort, fast enough to make small kids throw up and big kids dizzy.  It is blissfully devoid of thick mulch underneath it (because that, you see, would impede the running necessary to get the thing up to what I think of as the ""fun"" speeds).  The merry-go-round is a wonderful thing indeed, being both quite enjoyable AND delightfully laced with the potential for bodily harm.  It looks roughly like this:

<a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/10707024@N04/5255934702/"" title=""OH Campbellstown - Playground by scottamus, on Flickr""><img src=""http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5005/5255934702_0c0999ed9d.jpg"" width=""500"" height=""375"" alt=""OH Campbellstown - Playground""></a>

Ours has a better paint job and is a slightly different model, but the general idea is the same.  It is still the Best Merry-Go-Round Ever.

If you don't have any experience with things that you could get hurt on, you might approach the Best Merry-Go-Round Ever with a lack of proper respect for its capabilities, speed, and sharp edges.  You might also approach the BMGRE with a complete lack of understanding of your OWN capabilities, having never encountered anything that might (in some way) exceed your readiness to deal with it on a physical level.  In a world where everything is safe and easily mastered (like modern tort-safe playgrounds), young people lack suitable opportunities to try and fail and learn about themselves and their world.  (I get that sometimes this involves trips to the ER.  Mostly, children heal quickly.)

So, when you assemble a group of suburbanite cub scouts in the wilderness (such as it is) and provide them with unsupervised and unlimited access to the BMGRE, knowing full well that they hail from a world where things have been made completely free of risk, it is completely reasonable to expect an ER visit to ensue.  One did.  A scout managed to unexpectedly part ways with the BMGRE and lacerate his leg immediately above the knee, making it something of an unsightly mess in need of some stitches.

I get that suburban peoples do not have as many opportunities for ER visits as rural people with more of a free-range approach to child-rearing, but even so they were quite worried.  In the words of my people, it was <I>a long way from the heart</I> and the kid was upright, able to answer questions, able to walk a quarter of a mile to summon an adult -- this is not a life threatening injury, it's a flesh wound.  No big deal.  

Anyway, in light of very worried parents in an unfamiliar area, I rode along to the hospital as a native guide to ensure that they got there on the first try.  We got to the ER in fine time and were ushered immediately into a treatment room.  Two nurses were on hand, one to go over paperwork with the mom, the other to get started on cleaning up the wound.  A doctor was there before the paperwork (1 page admission form) was filled out.  We were done, all stitched up and bandaged and equipped with antibiotics, walking out the door, in under thirty minutes.  (The parents were expecting hours of waiting and an ER cluttered with homeless people.  Our ER is not really like that, though mostly it's slightly busier that it was last Sunday morning.)

And boring first rides on horses.  Some folks were over at the horse people's the other day looking at young stud colts.  They bought one (yay) and took it away (yay) and were asking some questions about breaking horses.  To my way of thinking (and I am not an expert, being approximately six horses into my horse breaking career), breaking horses should be a complete snooze-fest.  It should be boring.  It should bore everyone, including the horse.  There should not be drama.

In breaking a horse, you start on the ground.  You're on the ground and the horse is on the ground and it's more difficult for serious injuries to happen with this setup.  It's not impossible, but it's more difficult.  On the ground, there is more room for all parties to remain calm, to recover calm, to take a deep breath and think things through.  If there needs to be a blow-up (you're doing it wrong), you have a twelve-foot lead rope to put space between you and the horse during that event.

On the ground, your horse should heed you in-hand, should lead where you lead, go where you go, stop when you stop, all like that.  He should stay *with* you while the lead rope droops.  You should not have to tug at him to get him started OR stopped.  He should watch you and stop when you stop and pay attention to you.  If you do not have this level of attention from the horse, you are really not ready to proceed.

If your leading skills are good, you can move him around and direct him and pretty much do whatever with him on the ground, then you introduce the saddle and bridle.  You bring them out, you let the horse inspect them, you put them on the horse and take them off the horse.  You make sure he's OK with the new tack being put on and taken off.  The horse should NOT be tied while you do this.  He should stand, of his own accord, on a slack lead (I drape the tail of it over my shoulder) while you put the saddle on and off of him.  Repeatedly.  His feet should NOT move when you bridle and unbridle him.  If you are backing the horse up twenty feet every time you go to put a bridle on him, you're doing it wrong.  My green horses (Punch and Fiddler) both bridle easily and peacefully -- it took about twenty minutes to teach them the drill, after which things were awesome.  (The whole thing will work better if you are patient enough to wait for the horse to be ready.  You trying to hurry him along is not going to make him ready faster.  Quite the opposite.)

Once you're good on the ground, you can proceed to what I refer to as the ""on the bucket"" stage.  When you're on the bucket, your horse is standing there on a slack lead (rope tail over your shoulder) while you stand on the bucket (so that you are tall enough to lean over the horse's back and pet the other side of him.  If your horse can't stand still on his own at this step, he's not really ready to go forward.  You stand on the bucket and lean over him and pet him.  You kind of lean on him.  You lay on your belly across his back and pet his hip and shoulder and down to his knees and stuff.  Pet the ears and neck. Pet the butt.  Talk to him.  He should stand there (being bored) through all of this.  (There may be initial wobbling around but he should not be sudden or excessive.  He should get his balance and hold still.)  Once he can hold still and be relaxed with this step, you are ready to go onward. It is not helpful to cheat and ""hold"" him still or to have him tied.  That is not what you need.  You need him to hold HIMSELF still for you.

At this point, I like to ensure that I will have the rudiments of steering when I am aboard.  So, I stand beside the horse and hold the reins in proper position (with an arm over her back to simulate the other side rein) and ask for turns each direction.  I pick up the rein and take the slack out of it and sit there and wait until the head turns.  Good horse.  Do the other side.  Good horse.  Okay, now what do you do if I take the slack out of both reins at once?  You back up.  Good horse.  I go to the other side of the horse and repeat this from that side.  Turn left.  Turn right.  Back up.  Good.  So, there is steering.  (I repeat this a couple of times on different days to make sure it works.)  Some folks do this with ground driving.  I'm not a ground driver, but if that works for you, fine.

More later, I have to go to work."

"event","The cold water pressure (and only the cold water pressure) at my house is soft.  Not sure why.  So I was investigating it this morning.

<lj-cut text=""This post is actually about an opossum intelligence test."">

The water gets to my house from a large tank on the hill.  It runs down the hill (that's where the pressure comes from) through the water line pipes until it gets to the joint outside my house.  The water line joint outside my house is located in an 18"" diameter culvert pipe (black plastic, completely smooth on the inside) that is about three and a half feet long and on end in the yard.  Most of it is buried in the ground, with about a foot or so sticking up out of the ground so that you don't fall into it by accident.  It has sort of a peaked roof on it, but the roof does not sit ""down"" over the top of the pipe.  It just perches across the top of the culvert pipe, such that, well, apparently things can get down into the culvert pipe.

In my investigating of the water situation, I went out to the culvert in the yard and flipped off its little roof to investigate what was inside.  Like, maybe the valve was leaking or not all the way on or something.  What I found, in the bottom of the culvert, was an opossum, a pretty good-sized, not-dead opossum.  It opened its mouth (containing many many freakishly small teeth) and hissed at me.

I investigated the culvert and the opossum.  Clearly around the top of the culvert, but SHORT of the top of the culvert, by about six inches, were lots and lots of muddy footprints that I really have to assume belonged to the opossum that was, at that time, quite physically present in the bottom of the culvert.  All of the footprints fell short of the actual lip of the culvert, short in a way that would eventually be tragically so for the opossum.  The way I figured it, the opossum's best efforts at removing itself from my culvert had already been made, though it yet seemed a fairly lively opossum.  (That whole playing dead thing, not so much.)

So then the problem before me, and I would like to state for the record that this problem was before me BEFORE COFFEE AND BEFORE 7 AM, was the problem of an opossum trapped at the bottom of the culvert pipe and going to DIE THERE unless I did something about it.

Neither of my college educations threw up any useful factoids about what to do with an opossum at the bottom of a culvert pipe.  Neither education provided me with any actual information about the physical capabilities of an opossum.  Can an opossum climb?  How well?  Can an opossum jump?  WTF can an opossum do?  How much help am I going to need to render to this damn opossum with its creepy beady eyes and moth-eaten-looking grey fur? Fucking marsupial, anyway.

After some thought on the opossum problem, I got two buckets, a short one (about 1' tall) and a tall one (5 gallon sized).  I put both buckets, upside down, into the culvert side by side.  There was just enough room left at the bottom of the culvert for the opossum, who was in no way pleased about the addition of buckets to its situation.  And then I regarded the (somewhat pissed-off) opossum and the buckets for a time, but not long enough because I had to go to work and do stupid boring shit instead of hanging out in my yard at a discreet distance from the culvert pipe to see if the opossum figured it out or not.

Stupid work.

First thing when I got home from work, I investigated the situation in the culvert in my yard.  Both of the buckets had muddy footprints all over them.  :)  The upper bucket was knocked slightly askew (it didn't sit quite level in the pipe because space was at a premium).  And there was no opossum anywhere in sight.  Success! 

SO.  Opossums are dumb enough to climb into culvert pipes on end, the depths of which they do not know until they have fallen non-recoverably-deep into them.  However, they are also bright enough, when provided with buckets to climb upon, to get back OUT of a culvert pipe.

Also, cold water pressure at my house is still soft.  :(  This is probably not due to opossums in the water line joint culvert, at least not anymore."

Today it's the price of food and what is termed ""poverty tourism"" -- that thing the NJ governor did, by eating on a 'food stamp' budget for a week.

Pros to doing the ""food stamp budget"" thing -- It might give people who do not receive the benefit some perspective on how much it really buys for a household.  It might temper a bit of the ""living like KINGS on SNAP benefits"" mindset, walking a week in someone else's shoes.  Mindful eating is helpful for people anyway.

Cons.  Non-poor people who have a stable middle-class life, a car, a working fridge/freezer/stove, the knowledge and leisure to cook well, a kitchen with pots and utensils to cook well *with*, cupboards full of spices and flavorings and ingredients to add to the ""food stamp budget"" food purchases -- these people are not going to have the same ""food stamp budget"" experience as a person who takes the bus twelve blocks one way to a crappy, poorly-stocked, overpriced grocery store and has a ""kitchen"" in her rented room that consists of an illegal hotplate, one pan, a can opener, plastic utensils from a fast food joint, and a small ""dorm size"" fridge, no freezer.  Can you and your middle-class kitchen cook better than our hypothetical inner-city resident?  Sure, with one hand tied behind your back.  So, it's not going to be all that realistic even if you try really really hard to suffer for your art.  

It's arguably disrespectful of the folks who receive SNAP because yer average middle-class person playing the ""food stamp budget"" game is not going to get an accurate picture of the life and he or she can quit the game at any time, whereas the SNAP recipient does not have that luxury.

And, well, people are going to claim that you're doing it wrong. They're going to claim that you have to start with NO FOOD AT ALL and NOTHING IN YOUR CUPBOARDS and NO SPICES and NO PANS and yadda yadda yadda.  You're not going to please anyone by playing ""food stamp budget"" because every single observer knows how to do it better than you and is just chomping at the bit to tell you how.y.

Fun as it might be, what with the poverty tourism and the catchy title, we are not going to play ""food stamp budget"" at my house.  First off, I don't qualify for food stamps because I make too much money.  Second, no matter how I do it, it will be ""wrong"". Either I'm doing it to show that it can be done (by well-fed, not-overtired, genius-level IQ me and my middle-class fully-equipped kitchen with working fridge, freezer,and stove, my extensive spice rack, my enthusiasm for and skill at cooking, my reasonably-well-stocked grocery store, my joyfully sharp knives, etc) and therefore the problem with all those obese, diabetic poor people suffering from food insecurity is that they are <I>so incompetent that they are failing at being poor</I> OR I'm doing it to show that it can't be done unless the person playing the game is willing to opt for the <I>filling white carbs</I> strategy.  which is something we already know.

Instead we're going to look at the price of food in my household, because I think it's interesting and I want to do that.  (I would honestly rather be breaking horses, but <I>rain</I>, yo.)  As a side note, the act of observing a thing changes the behavior of the thing, so there will probably be some modifications to my actual food budget because someone, somewhere, is watching me natter on about my food.

I went grocery shopping today.  Not sure how interesting it is going to be to look at what I buy, but what the hell.  (Also, do note that I get some food items more-or-less for free.  The dude presents me with ripe avocados in much the same way that other dudes bring fresh flowers.  The horse people basically give me all the eggs I can eat, for free, particularly in the springtime.  They have chickens, is why.  And also Trys gets free ""produce"" food from the food bank helper sorta-father-in-law, sometimes large amounts and always unexpected.  Some of it needs to be eaten right away, which is why it gets offloaded to me.  If it doesn't get eaten right away, it goes bad and the chickens get it.  I realize that these items are not typical in most people's food budgets, but there you go.  I sometimes get free food.  Today I have four eggplants.  Some of them are kind of scary, but I suspect I can get enough out of them to make something-eggplant today.)

What I bought:  

 3.11  5 lbs all purpose flour
 2.53  3.2 lbs medium rye meal (this is flour)
 2.44  2.24 lbs rye berries (whole grain, for grinding)
11.45 5 lbs. american cheese slices
 3.99 lipton tea bags
 2.69 4 lbs sugar
 6.38 ghirardelli 60% chips
 2.29 carrots
 3.99 limes (a whole bag, I use these in curries and stuff)
 1.50 head cauliflower
 1.06 kale (bunch)
 1.00 cilantro (bunch)

43.43, it says."

<lj-cut text=""You're lying, right?""?>

I hab a caud, so less horse time lately than you might otherwise expect from our near-seventies temperatures with crystalline-blue skies and whatnot.  Me personally, I have snot running down my face, the sort of sinus headache that makes thinking impossible, and a wracking cough that prompts bystanders to inquire as to my imminent demise.  So, no horse.

I have bought a car.  We recall that I had a '97 Chevy Cavalier with about 250K on the odometer, which I had happily owned for 13 years.  It would not pass inspection any longer, so I had to get rid of it and get another car.  This was a process somewhat fraught with fraught because I do not like change.  At all.  I also hate car shopping.  Car sales people try to be your friend.  They are not my friend and it makes me extremely uncomfortable when they be all friend and shit.  I wish they wouldn't do it.  They want to shake hands and eyeball-gaze.  They want to gratuitously validate my choices in sort of a rah-rah cheerleader fashion.  (Do people actually like this?  I mean, flesh people, not people like me.)  It's dreadful. If there was some way to buy cars, like, online or something and just have them shipped to my house, I would totally do that.

So, for the car shopping, there is the preliminary thing.  How much money do I have to throw at the project?  About 8,500, including tax, title, tags, etc.  (I do not finance cars.  It is never appropriate to finance a depreciating liability if there is Any Other Way.  As my work transportation is provided by my work and my personal car is purely a vehicle for what we can term ""non-work"" driving, it is not appropriate to finance it.  Persons who are not self-employed and do not have a work-provided car may finance 1 vehicle in order to have reliable work transportation, but they should certainly have the decency to feel guilty about doing so.)  Next -- how much vehicle can I buy for around $7500 (because the taxes and shit are another grand)?  Not a whole lot, as it turns out.

Given the budget, I was going to be working in the 5 to 7 year old range, about 100K on the odometer.  (The style of vehicle is ""small car"" like the Cavalier I had, like a Ford Focus or a Honda Civic or whatever.  I'm not averse to hatchbacks, but I prefer coupes if possible.)  This isn't a ""new"" car by any stretch of the imagination, but it should be a car with some life left in it.  Recall, I got 250K out of a Cavalier (one engine).  I am not hard on four-bangers, I keep them maintained, and I do not generally drive like an asshat. 

So, I got to looking.  A lot of the ""small car"" owners tend to be young people, so a lot of the used vehicles I looked at had aftermarket add-ons that suggested their lives-before-the-car-lot.  On Civics, particularly, spoilers were popular.  Aftermarket stereos with big speakers were also prevalent.  This sort of crap on the car screams ""I have been abused by a young adult who can't afford a real sports car.""  Unfortunately, these were the coupes that I could find.  The other sort of person who typically buys a small car is a heavy-duty commuter.  These cars have higher than normal mileage, but the vehicles are bland, stock, uncustomized, have back seats that look entirely unlived-in, and (for the excessive highway commuter) tend to be manual transmissions.  If it's a stop-n-go commute, folks get automatics.  If it's rolling down the highway 50 miles one way, they get a stick for the marginal improvement in gas mileage.

Those are pretty much the options on used small cars -- coupes that are beat to shit by young drivers pretending that their modest 4-cylinder cars are ""sporty"" and four-door cars driven on serious commutes.  Families usually want bigger cars for their kids and their kid crap, so they mostly don't drive these cars.

I drove some young-person-owned coupes.  The cars (which came in actual colors like red and blue and yellow) drove like they were beat to shreds.  I bought the red two-door coupe Cavalier but it had half as much mileage on it (68K) and half as many years on it (3 when I bought it).  Apparently 5 to 7 years is too many to spend in the hands of a younger driver. *sigh*  So I looked at the commuter car section -- four doors, mostly grey or silver or beige cars, stock interiors, high mileage, immaculate back seats.  And there, I found a 2007 high mileage (125K) Honda Fit with a manual transmission.  In silver, black interior, all stock everything.  No wear on any seat except driver's.  Mmm-hmm.  It drove nicely.  I paid $7700, which was slightly under kbb value.  I should be able to get another 100K out of it without too much difficulty, but as with all things, time will tell.  At least I'm done car shopping, hopefully for a while."

<lj-cut text=""It's gonna be mostly ponies until fall.  Sorry."">

I'm on a mission to get some damn broke horses.  Yesterday was Te (regular outing, total snooze except she bolted for like three strides and then lost interest) and Peake.  With Peake, I had planned to work on ""Don't fucking start walking off before I'm even in the damn saddle"" but that did not go as planned because instead of forty minutes of battle royale, what I got was two corrections and an ""Ok, you want me to stand still during/after mounting until you TELL me to leave"".  I got on and off that horse so many dumb and sloppy ways that I got tired of getting on and off the horse.  She stood there.  If I asked her to move, she did.  If I halted her again and then lead her around a bit and then went to get on, she stood.  She stood if I got on the wrong side (takes me a while) and she stood if I whacked her in the butt with my foot and she stood if I made her wait a whole minute.  I was done inside of ten minutes and there was no battle.  I got done early.

Today, it was supposed to be Punch and Fiddler but instead it was pictures (wren and te) and then Real Horse (nick over jumps) and then just Punch, basic riding.  It was a pretty good day."

Today was make-up day for the T/R/S horses.  Fiddler got to walk to the hayfield and help put away the jumps.  (We don't have a ring.  Jumps live in the hayfield except for hay growing season.  They are in the woods the rest of the time, but that's less useful because the trails are narrow enough that the kiddies don't have to aim the horses so much.)  Having a green horse come along to 'help' put away the jumps just means that I drape the lead rope over my shoulder and he walks along behind me and maintains the slack as I pick up and move the 55-gallon drums, the poles, the jump fills, the standards, etc.  These are large items that might be frightening (they were not for Fiddler) and it's good for the young horse to learn to follow along quietly while a person is leading him around and carrying large items back and forth.  So, we did that.  Also we looked at the walk-over bridge (not scary at all today, but on Thursday, it generated <I>standing on hind legs</I> refusals to walk over it) and enjoyed the rattly, empty plastic jugs for sacking out.  And we reviewed saddle blanket, presented this time with more enthusiasm than the first presentation.

It was pretty much a snooze.  In sacking out, Fiddler does look at stuff when it's brand new, but he settles down pretty quickly once a thing has been introduced.  I'm not sure if this is due to him being smarter than previous horses were or to ME being smarter than I was when I was doing this with previous horses, but more on that a bit.  

For the non-horse-people in the lexience, sacking out is the process of getting the horse mentally/emotionally able to judge when to ""ignore"" and when to ""attend"" to body touches.  See, not all body touches <I>mean</I> something. In the course of doing stuff with horses, sometimes stuff (rope ends, reins, saddle pads, blankets, coattails, fenders and stirrups, slickers) just touches the horse more-or-less accidentally and we want the default response for those touches to be ""Oh, that was an incidental touch, no response required"".  (Horses that do not ignore incidental touches are sort of sudden and not easy to be around.)  At other times, we are intentionally touching the horse and we want the proper response, which is typically ""Move away from pressure"" instead of ""ignore it"".  Sacking out can really help a beginner horse figure out the difference between touches that are ""move away"" and touches that are ""ignore"".

The burden is on the human to make sacking out successful for the horse.  After all, in horse-human interactions, the human always has the game plan.  The horse gets stuck trying to figure out the damn game plan by reacting and (mostly) being wrong, trying again, being wrong, trying again, being wrong, trying again until he's right... he's totally got the shitty end of the stick, there.

We do not want to discourage the horse from trying to get the right answer.  We want to help and support him, to set him up for success and build his confidence.  Critically, the horse should feel certain that (a) the problem set before him HAS a solution (b) we will give him time to find the answer by trying different things and (c) we will clearly and obviously reward the correct answer.  The human's job, being <I>the smart one</I>, is to support and help the horse and his grapefruit-sized brain manage this cross-species communication effort.

Sacking out starts with a scary item.  What the item actually *is* depends on the horse, but the item needs to be scary enough to be of moderate interest but not so scary that you can't hold on to both the horse and the item at the same time.  (The horse is at the end of a fourteen foot rope and ideally is expected to hold <I>himself</I> still with drape in the rope.)  There exist some horses for whom some items are so scary that you cannot hold them both at the same time -- these horse/item pairings are not suitable for sacking out.  

Then, you have a horse and a halter rope with a fourteen foot (or so) lead.  And you have a working area that is largely free of dangerous things to run into.  The working area does not have to be a platonic ideal of perfectly smooth and pristine footing.  It just needs to be mostly free from dangerous crap.  Distractions (dogs, chickens, kids on bikes, wood splitters, tractors, random cars pulling in the driveway, etc.) are not a problem.

Now, you'd think that you hang on to the lead rope with a death grip and try to put the horse and the scary thing in the same place.  Whoa, there, cowboy.  You're gonna put the horse and the scary thing in the same place, but not right yet.  Remember that the horse does not know the game plan.  He has NO IDEA that he's supposed to stand there and be good while you wave the scary shit around.  If you start by bringing some scary shit out and straight away attacking the horse with it, he's gonna be thinking you're trying to kill him.  And it's called a <I>death grip</I> for a reason.  That doesn't even begin to sound fun, really.

What you do, with your moderately-interesting scary item, is you give the horse a hank of slack, maybe eight feet, and do not attempt to hold him still.  You can't actually hold him still anyway -- he's bigger and stronger than you are.  Your aim here is to teach him to HOLD HIMSELF STILL FOR YOU.  So you take the moderately-interesting item and take it a little closer to the horse.  You're going to use approach-n-retreat with the scary thing to teach the horse that standing still and ignoring the scary thing is the correct answer.  For this to work, you have to be able to see the moment <I>before</I> the horse decides to move.  Your horse body-language skills need to be halfway decent, but it's OK because you will get lots of practice with this.  If you screw up, and he moves, and this will probably happen at least once, the fix is pretty simple.  Keep approaching in as quiet and gentle and non-threatening a way as you possibly can.  Eventually the horse will stop moving to re-evaluate the threat.  And there's your chance.  Retreat as soon as he stops.  Back up off him when his feet are not moving.  Make it your job to ""catch"" him not moving and then reward him by taking the pressure away at that moment.

Your backing up off of him is the release of pressure.  It's the ""Good Boy"" correct answer reward.  You can also say ""Good Boy"" if you want, but horses aren't real talky and they don't note that stuff as well as they see your body language.  (You can't usually pet him because you're holding the scary item and you have just retreated away from him for a reward.)  Don't worry -- horses are fucking savants at body language -- he will understand you just fine.  

Keep doing your approach-n-retreat thing until you can touch the horse with the scary thing on the shoulder.  (Best place for new touches is the shoulder.)  There should be slack in the lead rope, no pressure on the horse to hold him there.  He should be able to walk away if he wants to.  If he can't stand up by you, with a big ol' drape in the rope, he is not really in control of himself and his emotions regarding the scary thing.  Keep working at it.  For some horses, it may take several days of practice with an item.  You'll want to be able to rub it all over him and flop it around his feet, under his belly, over his back, etc. but this does not always happen instantly.  

Anyway, with Fiddler this is going surprisingly well... but I've had some practice since I first started sacking out horses and maybe I'm more clear than I used to be.  Maybe I'm better at seeing how far I can go before I need to step back and let the horse relax.  Maybe I am more patient or more definite about my approach and retreat.  Maybe I don't need to always try for that little bit more that actually breaks the horse's <I>hold</I> and makes the whole thing take longer."

I've been reading up a bit on starting colts.  (Or older horses.  I mean, we have very few colts, most of the crap I'll be starting is more than 6 and has been standing in the field eating for the last... forever.  Waiting to be 'in the mood' to start horses is not actually working, so I'm scheduling it.  Interestingly, this technique also works for people who would like more sex in their marriages but can't seem to manage it.  If they schedule it and follow the schedule, their frequency of getting laid increases and they are largely happier.  Go figure.)

I kind of have my way of starting horses under saddle.  It's not a perfect way by any means and I am certainly not the expert that an actual pro is. However, I have started Nick, Callie, Whims, Peake, and Te.  That's more than most regular (non-horse) people ever do.  It's more than many horse people ever do.  (Lots of horse people go their entire lives without ever starting a horse.  They just buy and ride broke stuff and there is nothing wrong with this any more than there is anything wrong with people who buy ready-to-drive cars instead of building their own.)  

The horses I do are not finished.  They are ""rideable"" at the walk, trot, and canter.  They halt and back up.  They turn fairly well.  They trailer load, handle all over their bodies, pick up their feet nicely, tie well, tack up easily, bridle nicely, and ride in company or alone.  They have decent ground manners.  They can hold a working gait without prodding and have enough miles/musculature to handle all sorts of terrain with confidence.  They cross creeks.  They have some idea of leg pressure for help with turning/steering and can do 20 meter circles that actually have bending in them.  They are good basic critters for riding, horses that can be enjoyed as-is or that can be schooled further and made into finished, skilled companions.

My goal is to produce a horse that has the basic skills needed for a 'normal' rider to enjoy it out on the trail or in the ring.  Ideally, the horse should be solid enough that a novice rider would be able to get along and not find himself in huge trouble despite lack-of-skills, but that takes miles and miles and miles and not all horses are suited to being that good on their own.  I want them to be horses I can enjoy riding, even if their skills are kind of basic.  Basic does not mean ""have to steer like a green baby horse and over-exaggerate things"".  Basic means ""Horse does not sidepass, does not work on contact, does not have one-step canter departures, etc.""  The skills he does have, the turn left, turn right, stop, back up -- those skills should be 5x5, working properly and not having to be exaggerated to get them done.  Horse should respond to subtlety for the cues he understands.

(More on this later, it's time for breakfast.)"

"event","Horse activities yesterday were delayed due to rain.  I worked on tile instead.  Today I took the Ungratefuls out (they were scheduled for MWF but today was a make-up day) for spins.  Te was a total snooze.  She's just not very interesting to me.  Her skills are improving, but she's boring.  *sigh*  Someone will love her, but that someone is not me.

With Peake, for warm-up we did the ""See New Places"" ride that I did with Te the other day and that was fine.  She failed at ""trot steadily around the buckwheat field"", kept offering a canter with the wind up her ass, so there were extra circles.  20 Meter oblongs, really, but they did the trick despite being only partially round.  To be fair, it was cold and windy and so the forward wasn't really surprising.  On the canter portion (after all that other stuff) she actually rated instead of speeding up when I sat up straight and said ""Easy"".  She went back down to a more rocking-horse canter before I had to touch the reins, which was a first for her.  And then she did a nice flat walk after.  Hill descents are still a work-in-progress but her leg-based lateral steering is showing improvement.

I did not get to the T/R/S horses, so that will be on Sunday.  

I also talked to Trys and got the list o' horses so that I could make a spreadsheet of horse skills.  Like, a thing showing what all they could do.  My game plan here is to see if I can recruit the kiddies to help work on ground skills (picking up feet, trailer loading, ground manners, touching the horse all over his/her body, doing basic rope work, etc.) so that some of the boxes can be filled in on the super-green stuff.  Anything I can get someone else to do is work that I don't have to do.  It's not exactly checklist-horse-breaking, but I think sometimes it is easy to overlook what all needs to be caught and taken out and worked with.

The list is... kind of daunting.  There is a lot of work to be done."

<lj-cut text=""And how did that go?"">

Punch:  snoozefest.  Bridle on, bridle off.  Bridle on, bridle off.  Put Cass aboard, led around.  Put self aboard, had Cass lead around.  Snooze.  Learned some about reins.  Got on.  Sat.  Got off.  Got on.  Sat.  Got off.  Snooze.  ZZZZ.

I know I said I would do more before swinging a leg over, but I lied about that.

Fiddler:  We went for a walk.  He walked in front of me some (and then went in reverse rather a lot -- it seems to help his brain engage) until he didn't anymore.  He was worried about the big horses going on a real ride instead of paying attention to me and the cross rail (in-hand work, this was) he was supposed to be trotting over.  I hurt him feelings by failing to attend to his neediness and insisting that he trot over the damn cross rail.  We looked at the very scary wooden bridge.  He stood on his hind legs (a little light on the front end, always has been) in an attempt to say ""No, thank you"" to the wooden bridge.  He got more going-in-reverse and then we re-addressed the issue of the bridge.  Like ten times.  And each time I'd lead him back to the bridge and stand next to it and gesture like he's supposed to walk over it (which he KNOWS) and wait for him to go over the bridge or refuse.  After the nth iteration, his ears flopped out to the sides and he looked all grumpy and then he flat walked over the damn bridge with each foot hitting it.  And then he turned carefully on request and did it again in the other direction.  So I told him he was a good boy! and we went home where I attacked him with the dog food bag streamer toy.  He flinched twice, then put his head down (lop eared and disgruntled-looking) and *tolerated* it until I was done.  Such a clever boy."

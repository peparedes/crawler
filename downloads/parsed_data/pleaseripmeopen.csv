"event","just puking thick ropey strings of blood into the gio ponti washbasin in hot painful gasps, not knowing whose it was. staring in the mirror. trying to focus on the whites of my eyes. 
he was smeared across the bed. he had his left leg tucked underneath. i could see his asshole in the mirror, hard-crusted cherry red.
sheets swiped with handprints like scars. 
i licked the back of my thumb and tasted blood and sweat and shit. hot like an oven. pretty like a picture. dripped dry.

i had to actually hold a hand mirror to his face to see if he was breathing. i had to rest a hand on his chest and feel it rise and fall. i kissed him, licking the red around his mouth, one eye swollen shut. gently pushing in against the resistance. he hardly made a sound.

a phillips head screwdriver pooling on a breuer side-table. 
i bought a memphis bay table lamp but i can't keep it in the bedroom.

i piss in the shower and drown out the sounds.

i've pinned black paper over the windows. fastened it with duct tape. i didn't want to know if it was daytime.
i remember he liked to spit into my mouth."

"event","he kept whispering oh my god shit man i've never done this before but you're so hot it's not like i'm a fag or anything while his cock pressed against mine, hard through layers of damp fabric while i fixed my mouth under his jawline and licked at the perspiration while he was making whore-eyes at any guy that looked his way until he was wasted enough to actually say anything, so i thought it may be worth my while. 
we snorted a couple of lines with no objection to us both doing them in the cubicle, and off my black amex 
have done ecstasy at some point because his jaw kept clenching and unclenching even as he strained his neck back when i thrust in and barely even reacted except mumbling harder harder even when my thumb was wrenching his asshole down and i was pulling my whole prick out and slamming it back in and i could feel something warm and wet against it inside but the morphine we did kept me from coming and him from feeling until at some point he 
i sawed through his right earlobe with silver asprey manicure scissors and stabbed him in the cheek with them. it was hardly worth it when there was so much blood i had to stop and wipe off the handle, and if they're so fucking wasted on animal-grade morphine i have to punch you five or six times in the fucking face to even get a reaction. then he started to feel and i was glad i had paid extra to have my bedroom soundproofed because even when i garrotted him against the bedpost with an hermes belt he still managed to scream, blood foaming between broken teeth like some kind of fucking animal while he clawed against my leg and i had to kick him again and again until finally i heard his wrist snap and blood sprayed across his torso. i grabbed his hair, stiff with blood and he was sobbing while i rammed my dick in his mouth and started fucking deep, hard, damp stifled sobs, barely feeling his teeth scraping against my shaft and my cock hitting against his esophagus, the morphine finally wearing out as i come over his chest and his head lolls over still weeping and daylight makes the blood glisten thickly, in coils."

"event","24_the visionnaire thing was at about eleven. it just finished.
i've never liked working with lamsweerde and matadin after something we did for arena homme plus in 1999 with karl plewka which really turned out awful. so i wasn't in the best of moods. 

i wore an hedi slimane sleeveless tuxedo jacket over white raf simons pants and an oversized simons deconstructed wool knit with a plain white gucci shirt.

the shoot ended up being something gothic with alot of yves saint laurent black and helmut newton lips. i remember asking them to play vive la fete, ironing rie rasmussen's hair and complaining about closed-toe rodolph menudier courts.

i am going to the end. i would have come later and gone to eletcric stew at the great north western, but it clashes with jace's birthday thing. 

which normally wouldn't be a problem but i don't know where we stand.

"event","last night i went out to lot 61, which was dead even for a monday night. they were practically letting in anyone who turned up at the door; the line was about four people deep when i got there at ten thirty and it cost me fucking fourteen dollars for an absinthe mule, but the bartender was cute and i took four valium and a shot of special k before i left. 

special k is a bit of a new experience for me - or at least a revivalist one - and reminds me of the summer in 1992 when jace passed out in the lodge my father used to rent in aspen and started choking on his tongue when i made the smallest incision - barely a pinprick - into his neck with a serrated kitchen knife and sucked out about half a pint of his blood and spat it into an old '85 cabernet sauvignon bottle. 

i still have that somewhere. although i usually siphon blood into merlot bottles now, as blood and semen reproduce the scent of a mature melot (say a '76) almost to perfection. or at least enough for a pleasant end to a fairly animated  dinner party.

the boy was called fabien i think. 

he was wearing a sleevless costume nationale shirt and drainpipe-narrow louis vuitton pants with yves saint laurent brouge-boots and asked me for a light. he had coke residue around his left nostril and his hair was tousled. he was 21. 

we got back to mine at 3.47. i fucked him as we walked through the door to my appartment, pressing him against the doorframe before dragging him in and throwing him against the wooden floor. 
he was strong enough to top for a while, before predictably i got bored of having him inside me and flipped quickly before he came, straddling him face-up. 

but everytime i closed my eyes my vision blurred and the time came when, as if by accident, my hand grazed against his nose, pressing sharply against the septum and unleashing a quick flash of blood against the white plaster. 

i leant forward. licked the blood from his upper lip. kissed him, hard.

he stopped. he touched his nose and brought his fingers away red.

he looked at me, eyes round with shock, whites finally showing in that perfect look of stripped innocence some can achieve as soon as they walk through the door. 
'...i have to be up early tommorrow...'

the trouble with boys is they ruin your moments. the ritual was gone. i leant in, to kiss him again, hand twisted in his thick mop of dark hair
quickly twisted to one side and slammed the left hand side of his head against the corner of the granite table, wound inperceptible behind his hairline.

date over.

i injected about half a syringefull of clorox into the wound and watched the flesh curl away from the skull and his breathing become slightly more ragged"

"event","all the days seem to melt into one long, endless day. 

i have been sleeping through the days on a combination of absinthe, halcion and the sleeping pills my mother was prescribed by her mexican doctor, which pretty much knock me senseless. 

i collapsed in the kitched yesterday, which wouldn't have annoyed me except i had been arranging various bones i found into a miniature model of the santa tome church in toledo.

when i woke up the pool of blood resembled in minutae detail the grunewald crucifixion. maybe that was just me.

i did four lines of coke after i woke up just to aleviate the boredom. i have a styling job tommorrow with visionnaire.

there is a thumb wedged under my laptop. this unsettles me but i am still not motivated to pull it out. the keyboard has something dark and sticky between the keys, and it take me three attempts to type a k so i will be avoiding that letter as much as i can.

i need to go out tonight. i fucked joshua last night, but even though he has taken ecstasy and acid and a gram of <i>my</i> coke and fuck knows what else he screamed when i went too deep and tried to ram three fingers up his asshole at the same time. 
joshua is a prick sometimes. 
i ground four painkillers into his kir royal after that, which otherwise he would have tasted, and fisted him with a quilted yves saint laurent glove while he was asleep.
he was still responding slightly - he moaned and ground himself against my knuckles, which i found quite amusing - especially as joshua insists he's always a top. 
i cut my initials into his perineum with a scalpel, which didn't bleed half as much as you might think. the sheets would be salvagable if that was the only blood on them.
it was 9 am by that time, so i rubbed a little table salt into it to wake him up and told him to get the fuck out and he looked at me with these eyes - although maybe the painkillers were just wearing off. 

i wonder if you can buy animal tranquiliser wholesale?

i am going to london on thursday.

british boys are so much more peverse."

"event","i met lydia for breakfast at le bernadin. except i wasn't eating because i'd been up since 5am. and i only went to bed at 2.

i have been sleeping less and less. and when i do sleep i can hear the blood thundering about in my ears until i have to stick pins in them until enough blood oozes out to lower the pressure. so its excusable. and i think i'm immune to halcion at the moment because i'm not sleeping at all. so instead i took some coke and did some pushups.

lydia was wearing a marc jacobs peacoat and carrying a Balenciaga braided bag. she had the chocolate souffle and i had a double expresso and a bagal i threw up into a garbage can two blocks later. i had to stop the cab.

today i tortured to death a small pug-dog belong to my neighbor and left it on her doorstep. its intestines had leaked out a little through the gash i made in its left haunches, but not enough to kill it. it even had enough life left to yip as she opened the door. i am glad the security cameras don't work on my floor. even though it meant my prada loafers got stolen two weeks ago.

i have to go and see my father tomorrow. we need to talk.

"event","terse breakfast this morning with jace. he picked at his food and it pissed me off more than it really aught to. i was wearing a pinstripe wool margeila jacket with levi jeans and a white hermes shirt i ripped the sleeves off last night because they were covered with flecks of someone's blood. and after all i didn't really want to throw it out as hermes shirts tend to have a finer fit than other houses. i worked out for almost an hour today, even though i try not to work out that much anymore after jace said i was becoming too much of a go-go boy and looked like a bruce webber photograph from 1989. 
so i stopped. 
jace was wearing an hedi slimane shirt over a gucci tank and rumpled ann demulemeester trousers that i think were a touch too big for him. his hair was kind of rumpled and there was a small bruise on his right cheek which, i suppose, was in some way my fault. i took two xanax at 10am so, you know, i wasn't really all that concerned. i was halfway through the times before jace pointed out it was upside down. 

i had some dried blood under a fingernail and it'd turned black. this would be my third manicure in 10 days."

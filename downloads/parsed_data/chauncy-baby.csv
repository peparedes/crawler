this morning i felt like such a loser. my mom can be beastly sometimes. 
the rest of the day people started to make me feel better.

anywoo... i like my group for the scavenger hunt. i will do anything, same with brandon and i could always get joanne to do anything, and try the same with cathy(depending on what it is). it should be alot of fun.

i also got my secret santa...fun fun:)

today i also relized that not ALL people think about themselves. and people are much happier during the holidays. today my locker was jammed, and i was kicking it, and this kid from are grade asked ""do you need help?"". it was so nice of him to do that. lol okay its dumb, but some people are just so helpful...and i def. didnt think he was one of them.

first week of driving to school... its nice.

"event","i havent listented to thursday in so long :( i wish i could see them in concert, but there concerts are such much rougher than the ones i've gone to(tbs, brand new). anywoo...

tonight i just had my first good cry of senior year. sometimes you just need to let it out. i had one over the summer with scott, but other than that... thats about it. i found out tonight that its possible that my grandparents might not be coming to NY for christmas, but going to Connecticut to see my two other cousins. normally, i wouldnt get so upset, but since they wont be seeing much of me when i go to college, i think i sort of have a right to be upset. i dont know maybe its just me getting all the attention over the years, and now i have to share it.

i dont know what the point of this is...

now that i think of it... the psychic was right about me not getting things in return in regards to people being nice to me. ever since 1st grade, people have been so mean to me... and then starting up again in 6th and 9th grade. it really just gets me down when i think about it.

i really miss summer. not having to give about anything, and just having fun. 

eh, bye."

"event","this day was so spooky...and possibly one of the best days, ever... period.

got my car. that was fun. i guess i can start to drive to school on tuesday.

got home, found out how to pump gas... it was fun.

called chauncy...and yes, we went to see the psychic.

i picked chaunce up, got to the psychic, and knocked on the door. this little boy(glasses, big teeth) comes out, and looks at us...and runs away. i just thought to myself... its an alien. so this man opens the door and is like okay tarot, crystal ball, and a bunch of other stuff. so i got the tarot card for $50, with a looking reading? which means she basically means she tells u your future. so, she comes out and tells me to sit down. she told chaunce he had to go inside and couldn't listen to my reading(and by the way, the family was fucking nuts and on herion...will disscuss later). 

so i sit down, she shuffles the cards, and tells me to put my right hand on the deck, say my full name, and birthdate. she then pulled out at least 20 cards, and tells me, you are very nice towards people, and like to do things for them, but alot of the time, you dont get that in return(which is very true,and happens all the time).  she then pulls out a card which has two people kissing and im thinking 'oh crap, luff'. she then said, is there any love in you life... ahh. she told me there seems to be no relationship in the next coming months. i then told her two names of people that im ""intrested"" in. the first name she said there was no way he was looking for a relationship, but maybe next year. then the next name and she said sternley no. then she told me... that the first person does stuff to pressure me into doing things...which made me... go into shock. she was frigging out target with that one. 

then she looked at me and said...you have to stay strong. and she also said i worry to much...alot...throughtout the whole reading...about the littlest things(which chaunce agreed with) and told me i need to focus on my future.

okay, on a brighter note, she told me college looks like its in my future, i will be married(not seeing me married in the next6 years...woot) and i will have 2 children, and the relatonship will be healthy. but she kept saying...be strong, and dont let people pressure or push u around. oh, and she sees no death in the future with friends or family.:)

yes, so that was about...20 min.? chaunce came out, we paid...and left, fast. i was so freaked out. and chaunce also bc suppsoly there was a needle on the counter...?! and the kids were little devils...oh yeah and the two parents are drug addicts.
anyhoo...she was basically on target with everything, a little high maybe...? but scary as hell thanks chaunce for the bday present:)


went to the mill, saw grido and kelly. visited brandon at work and thats about it.
still freaked out about the reading."

"event","this weekend has been interesting...
this weekend i went up to Horseheads for volleball.
during the second game i re-injuried my ankle... the trainer up there said it looked like i streched out ligaments. i didn't play the rest of the weekend, which sucked... but i was happy to come back home.

sunday, i didn't wake up till 12:15. i finally caught up with my sleep:)
but sunday ended up being a big mess and creating more stress in my life.

i've relized, that maybe i shouldn't get so upset over things that will just create more stress in my life. i don't really need it. from thinking of college, volleyball, school, clubs, homework... etc, its just SO much to think about and i dont need more problems to get pissed about.
on the other hand... i should be upset. why do i always get let down in the end?

...i suppose it will all work out in the end... if it was meant to be, it will eventually come around and surface."

everything never goes my way.
i don't understand the male race.
i got injuried in vball, and then HE has to tell me he found someone else.
i guess i just set myself up for this, right?"

"event","yesterday i went to this halloween trail. first thing i saw coming in was a clown. i began to cry. lol
and brandon and chaunce helped me throughout the whole trail, and by helping me i mean by dragging my ass through it when i was like no! i dont wanna walk anymore bc i was scared. hahah good times.

yes, and i hate clowns. when i was little, when my grandparents lived in nesconset, i used to sleepover all the time. they used to have a clown portrait that would stare at me. i still remember it, it was three clowns, that freaked me out so much that when i was about to go to bed, i made my grandma take it down and keep it in the other guest bedroom. yes, and to this day... im still freaked out by it.

we then walked to stonybrook diner. bombahs brother ran there, and thats about it.

oh yes, i had the smithtown classic this weekend. i thought i played well. i got all tournament:)

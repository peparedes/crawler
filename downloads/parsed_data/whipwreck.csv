<i>*The wind whistles through the empty room.*</i>

Well, I guess that's to be expected when you don't update your blog for massive periods of time.

As for why I haven't been, there's really a couple of reasons:

1.  My limited access to a computer.  Right now, I only have access to a computer at work, where I'm actually supposed to be doing, you know, work and at my mother's house.  Unfortunately, my income has been such that I can't really afford to replace my old piece of crap computer, so I haven't bothered getting internet access at home.  In the limited time I <i>do</i> get to a computer, I tend to want to spend it on doing entertaining stuff.

2.  I just haven't felt like I've had anything important to say.  Really, right now, my life revolves around work and not much else.  And, believe me, work is mentally draining.  

Say all you want about lawyers and how they're the scum of the earth, profiting from the ills of others, but believe me when I tell you that lawyers <b>earn</b> the money they get paid.  It's a lot of long hours dealing with problem people (both the people your clients have disputes with <i>and</i> clients) and it can be a pretty thankless task as well.  There are some clients who, no matter what you tell them or what the outcome of their case is, believe that they were right.  And if they lost, it's entirely <b>your</b> fault.

Honestly, if you don't like lawyers, there is a perfect solution to get rid of them:  Don't get into a dispute that you can't (or aren't willing) to resolve yourself.  The vast majority of clients I see wouldn't need me if they were willing to be reasonable or were willing to deal with someone who would be reasonable with them.

The reason why the legal system is so expensive (at least one of them) is that the fees in the system have been set up to discourage people from frivolous actions.  The courts are trying to tell you that it's not worth suing that guy for $100.  Just suck it up and deal with it.  (Don't get me wrong.  I think the system is too expensive, but I meet with a lot of people who don't seem to understand why they should have to pay to file a lawsuit.)

Anyway, my call date is right around the corner.  On March 23, I will officially join the ranks of lawyers in Ontario, which is pretty cool, all thing considered.  I'm looking forward to it, even if it's been a headache getting there.  I can't guarantee that I'll update before then but, who knows, maybe I'll finally have something important to say."

Quick update, though:

Job's going well.
Kid Rock concert was cool, but Bayfest sucked ass.
Wedding Crashers is an awesome movie.
Glad to have hockey back.
Jays should suck it up and start contending or give up and lose.  None of this playing with my emotions crap.

Hopefully I'll update a little bit sooner than two months from now."

"event","Howdy, true believers.  Now that I have a standard 9 to 5 (okay, 8:30 to 5), I thought you'd like to take a peek into what a typical day for me is like.

<b>7:00 AM</b> - ""Ugh.  Why the fuck am I up this early in the morning?  Oh, yeah.  Shit.  Work.""

<b>7:30 AM</b> - ""Well, I suppose I should start getting ready.""

<b>8:00 AM</b> - After quickly mixing up a bottle of Gatorade, I'm now on my way to work.

<b>8:20 AM</b> - ""Shit.  Why don't I ever make breakfast in the morning?  Oh well.  I'll just stop into Timmie's for a bagel on the way in.""

<b>8:25 AM</b> - After noticing the line of drones around the building waiting for their coffee:  ""Shit.  Why don't I ever make breakfast in the morning?  No bagel for me.  I'll just remember breakfast tomorrow.""

<b>8:30 AM</b> - Saunter into work, climb the infinite staircase, sit at my desk, check my email and begin work.  If I'm lucky, my boss has gone through his inbox and left me revisions of draft letters I did yesterday for me to revise.  If not, I better have left myself something from the day before.

<b>9:00 AM</b> - The morning radio DJ's on my office-mate's radio having finally gotten on my nerves, I pop a CD into my DVD-ROM drive and commence listening to the rock & roll.

<b>9:30 AM</b> - By now, I've usually gotten at least one phone call from my boss' secretary to give me jobs assigned to her that she doesn't feel like doing so, consequently, passes along to me.

<b>10:00 AM</b> - ""Shit.  What do you mean it's only 10:00 AM?""

<b>11:00 AM</b> - ""Can't I get out of here for lunch yet?""

<b>12:00 PM</b> - ""Fuck it.  I'm out of here for lunch.  Maybe work will appear on my desk over my lunch hour.""

<b>12:15 PM</b> - ""Legends has <i>got</i> to be the slowest place imaginable.  Why haven't they even taken my order yet.  I swear I'm not coming back here tomorrow.""

<b>1:00 PM</b> - ""Shit.  What do you mean it's only 1:00 PM?""

<b>2:00 PM</b> - ""I'll go use the bathroom.  That'll kill... hmm... at least 6 minutes.""

<b>3:00 PM</b> - ""Okay.  There's, like, nothing else for me to do on my files right now until the boss gets back to me.""  I proceed to wander around the firm looking for people with some extra work to do.

<b>4:00 PM</b> - The boss comes by having cleaned out his inbox.  He drops at least a couple of hours worth of work on my desk.  Where was this two hours ago?

<b>5:00 PM</b> - Another day done.  Hope to get home in time for P.T.I.

So there you go.  Obviously, that's not the sort of thing that goes on <b>every</b> day, but it's pretty indicative of a typical day.  Really, my day rotates around how much work I left on my desk from the day before.  If I've left myself some work, I can keep myself busy.  If not, it can be a pretty long day.

In other words, pretty much like everyone else's job."

"event","Ugh.  I fully intended to post a new entry today, but I'm <i>sooooooooo</i> tired right now.

Actually, scratch that.  I was just watching TV and saw that Discovery Channel is now doing The Greatest American.  Shit, can't Canada ever have something and just have it be our own?  By the way, yes, I know we stole it from the show Great Britons, but bear with me here.

I mean, we <b>rarely</b> get all patriotic and stuff.  ""The Greatest Canadian"" was a way for us as a nation to stand up, toot our own horns, and say, ""Hey!  We may not get credit for it much, but Canada has done its part to make the world a cooler place to live.""

Americans, on the other hand, can't go a day without proclaiming how they are the greatest nation in the world.  Thanks very much, but we really don't need you to start pontificating on who the 100 greatest members of your history are.  I would imagine anybody in literally the <b>world</b> could name 100 Americans without difficulty.

What really piques my curiosity is how many people on the list are going to be transplanted Americans.  You know what I mean.  People who were born outside of the U.S. and, had they had the option to be as successful as they have been in the States in their nation of origin, would have stayed.  Actors, for instance.  I mean, sure, those people are Americans in that they live in the U.S., but what does it really mean to be American?  Is it simply sufficient to live within the 50 states or does one have to buy into the mindset that is being American?

Anyway, I probably won't watch the show, but I'd be interested to take a look at the list afterward."

It was fifteen minutes of two guys <i>literally</i> giving every ounce of energy they had to kick the crap out of each other and live out a dream.  Just an amazingly brutal fight.  It was like when rams butt heads.  There were periods where they were circling each other and you just knew that a storm was gonna break and then, suddenly, <b>BAM!</b> and there would be a flurry where both guys spent everything they had built up during that downtime.  Just repeat that for like fifteen minutes.

The brutality, courage, and determination of the fight was only surpassed by the joy at the end when they announced that both guys would get a contract.  Seeing the whole place erupt (And I mean the <i>whole</i> place.  Even the ring announcer) for a display of such determination was amazing.

Seriously, get a tape and watch it.  Un...believable."

"event","Hey hey, buckaroos!

For those of you wondering, the first week of work went off pretty much as expected.  Getting up early in the mornings was murder for the first little while and I was anxious for the first couple days but, by and large, I'd say I'm settling in nicely.

Once the positive feedback started rolling in about my work, it was easier to settle down.  I mean, rather than sitting around saying, ""Gee, I hope I'm doing this right so I don't get yelled at for wasting all day,"" I was able to say, ""Alright, I'm doing more of the same.  They liked that stuff, so this is probably good, too.""  The fact that they're billing me out at $90 an hour probably doesn't hurt, either.

Honestly, though, I'm surprised at the amount of responsibility I'm getting already.  I'm meeting with clients on my own which, realistically, I can't say I agree with, but I understand why they are doing it.  I just wish that both I and the boss had the luxury of easing me into stuff like that.

On the concert front, Kid Rock's playing Sarnia in July, which should kick major ass.  VIP tickets (read, general admission, but down in front) are over $100, but there's no doubt in my mind it will be well worth it.  Needless to say, I'll be doing everything in my power to be there.  It might actually make up for missing him, Aerosmith, and Run DMC in concert a couple years ago.  Not likely, but it'll at least take some of the sting away.

Other than that, not much else going on.  I don't really have much time in my life right now to do anything other than work and then come home and unwind from work, but that's perfectly fine for right now.  There'll be plenty of time for other stuff once I'm financially secure again.

Hope life's treating everyone else well and I'll hopefully be updating again soon."

It just sort of came out of the blue, actually.  The partner that I interviewed with six months ago called me up on Thursday and asked if I'd be able to have lunch with him on Friday.  So I ran out, got my hair cut and my beard trimmed, and the next thing I know I'm getting an offer of a position.

So it's finally nice to be able to stand on my own two feet instead of having keep asking my mom for money.  I'm still actually finding it hard to believe.  I keep expecting to get a call next week saying that they're really sorry, but they've changed their minds.  But I gotta keep thinking positive.

Anyway, I'll write more about it once I know exactly what I'm doing.  Suffice it to say, though, that I'm in a good mood for the first time in a long while.  Now if I could just find me a woman.  Hmmm.... :P"

<TD>In popular folklore, a man who is transformed, or who transforms himself, into a wolf in nature and appearance under the influence of a full moon. The werewolf is only active at night and during that period, he devours infants and corpses. According to legend, werewolves can be killed by silver objects such as silver arrows and silver bullets. When a werewolf dies he is returned to his human form. The concept of werewolves, or lycanthropes, is possibly based on the myth of Lycaon. He was the king of Arcadia, and in the time of the ancient Greeks notorious for his cruelty. He tried to buy the favor of Zeus by offering him the flesh of a young child. Zeus punished him for this crime and turned him into a wolf. The legends of werewolves have been told since the ancient Greeks and are known all over the world. In areas where the wolf is not so common, the belief in werewolves is replaced by folklore where men can change themselves in tigers, lions, bears and other fierce animals. </TD></TR>

"event","Hey, folks.  Sorry for the lack of regular updates lately, but the fact of the matter is, honestly, that I haven't felt like sitting down and writing anything when I'm in front of a computer.

I've really been feeling shitty lately.  Mostly, it's the fact that I've been home for over six months now and I'm <i>still</i> unemployed.  It kind of sucks that I can't even seem to get an interview.  Throw in the fact that I now owe about $450 a month in payments on my loans alone and it really makes me feel inept.

Being single hasn't been helping the equation, either.  I'm not gonna get into it right now, mainly because I think I've played it out to death on here, but suffice it to say that being single, in my opinion, sucks ass.

Anyway, that's the main reason why I haven't been updating lately.

Going back to my last update, I think Megas XLR is an awesome cartoon and The Batman sucks, doing a disservice to the greatest superhero franchise there is.  I wanted to write more about it but, well, you know.

Hope to be back in the very near future with good news.  Later, gators."

Shows you need to be watching:

-<b>Ultimate Fighter.</b>  Boring fight this week notwithstanding, it's still a really great show with some generally good fight action.  Plus, you get to see the mentality behind these guys who are more or less paid to try to cause severe bodily damage to others.

-<b>Survivor:  Pulau.</b>  Yes, yes.  I know it's another season of Survivor, but it looks like a lot of thought has gone into this season.  First off, it has an overarching military theme, which is kind of cool.  It also looks like they're adding a greater element of strategy to the game as a whole.  Witness the first challenge where the winning tribe probably only won because they were willing to give up a chance at extra food, water containers, and shelter.

-<b>Deadwood.</b>  I feel so guilty saying this, considering that he beat out Denis Leary for the Golden Globe, but Ian McShane is fucking awesome.

Movies you need to be watching:

-<b>Million Dollar Baby.</b>  A great movie.  Just be sure to hide the razor blades and anything you could use to hang yourself before going to see it, cause it gets <i>really</i> depressing at the end.  Hilary Swank isn't too hard on the eyes, either.

Other stuff you need to be watching:

-<b>The Dunk.</b>  Those who've seen it know what I'm talking about.  Off the backboard, off Steve Nash's head, and stuffed.  Fucking incredible.  Find it on the net somewhere.

Other than that, not much else going on.  Still looking for work, still looking for love, likely in the wrong places for both.

"event","Hey, folks.  Nothing really new going on in my life, but I wanted to let you all in on some cool stuff you should be checking out.

First off, I saw the movie Secondhand Lions last week.  It was a really great movie starring both Robert Duvall and Michael Caine, so you know the acting is really good.  If I had to relate it to any other movie, I'd almost have to liken it to The Princess Bride.  Not that it's the same subject matter, but the story is kind of fantastic and would make a great family movie.

On the TV, I can't recommend the new CBS show Numbers (or Numb3rs) enough.  I'm not a fan of CSI, but I absolutely <b>love</b> this show.  Maybe because I'm a lot closer to the subject of math than I am to biology or chemistry or anything like that.  On that note, I'm really glad to see TV slowly moving away from a physio-centric ideal, with cops running down criminals over the length of multiple football fields while engaging in huge gunfights, towards a more academic ideal, holding up intelligence as the major trait of the heroes.  If only shows like that were around when I was younger and in public school, life probably would have been a lot easier on me.

Conversely, I think you should also check out The Ultimate Fighter on SpikeTV.  Yes, it's a ""reality"" show, but it tends to focus more on documenting the training of the fighters than on the relationships between the fighters.  Or at least it did in the pilot.  Plus it's got Ganyao, the Muay Thai trainer!  Any guy who can actually get away with delivering the line, ""Kick like a man, not like a little girl."" straight-faced is okay in my book.

Other than that, like I said, nothing really going on.  Hope everything's going well with everybody else and I'll talk to you guys again soon."

Anyway, nothing else really new going on.  I tell ya, though, Game Show Network needs to fire whoever's doing their teasers.  I mean, I was watching their new show American Dream Derby (only because there was nothing else on) and the commercial for next week's episode comes on.  Now, as far as you folks need to be concerned, there are two levels of people on the show:  owners and stablehands.  Owners are determined via the outcome of a game and get special privileges over the stablehands.  So what does this commercial do?  Why, show all the people who are going to be owners next week, of course!  Anyway, whoever put together that commercial just rendered the first half of the new episode unnecessary viewing.

"event","Hey, folks.  Just a couple quick thoughts on this Sunday before Christmas.

As for Survivor last week, I thought it was fine as far as last episodes go.  A lot less of the typical bitterness from the losers, which is fine by me.  In retrospect, I wish they had played up Chris against the women a bit more, as it really became the story of the second half of the season.

Interesting bit of game theory, though, this year, as the reshuffling of the teams actually ended up hurting the men in the long run.  Every time the male-dominant team won, the female-dominant team just voted off another guy.  Ironically, the only person who seemed to notice this, Bubba, got axed for it.  *Sigh*  I wish I had studied more game theory in school.  Oh well.  The next season looks to be military-themed, which should be cool, but Mark Burnett needs to lay off this whole ""Everything the survivors have come to expect will be wiped away in the first ten minutes!"" crap.  The ""revelation"" is never really that shocking and never really affects the game in the long run.

Speaking of crap, is it just me or are the contestants on Rock & Roll Jeopardy the biggest morons ever?  Like, seriously.  <b>Especially</b> the celebrities.  I mean, these people <i>work</i> in the music industry and can't get these dumbed down questions?  If you ever need to feel better about yourself, just watch an episode of Rock & Roll Jeopardy.

On a final note, I heard earlier this week that Electronic Arts paid the NFL something like $300 million for a five year exclusive license.  This basically means that, if you want to play a football game featuring NFL teams and players, you better like either Madden or Street.  Guess they felt a little threatened by Sega only charging $20 U.S. for ESPN Football this year.  Kind of sucks, really.  Oh well.  I only liked Street, anyway.

Anyhow, in case I don't get a chance to update again before the fact, happy holidays, everyone.

Oh, and P.S.:  50th entry!  Woo hoo!"

"event","Hey, folks.  I'm gonna try and update this here journal every time I get access to a computer, seeing as how I don't get at one that often right now.

Job search is still going negatively.  I'm basically down to one last hope here in town before I have to start looking in London.  Not that London would be that bad, but I'd have to move all over again and it would also require me to make a lot more money then I would have to make here.

It looks like the PS2 is on its last legs.  Which sucks major ass cause it's almost my only source of entertainment.  I think I could fix it given the right part and the proper time and enough information on what needs to be removed, etc.  Unfortunately, I don't have the money or that much know how.  What annoys me more than anything is how, when I took it in to get repaired, I got charged $40 and the guy really only put a band-aid on the problem.  That money would have put me a third of the way to a new PS2.  And what the hell is up with Sony only producing the new slim PSTwo now with a built in network adapter?  That adapter balloons up the price like $60.  What about those of us that don't want it?  Ugh.

Anyway, hopefully I can get a job real soon so I can replace all my broken stuff.  For those keeping track, the a-list currently stands at PS2, DVD player, and stereo.  Oh, and computer, of course.  Not that that's gonna be replaced anytime in the near future.

That's about it for now.  Hope everyone is getting geared up for the holidays and I'll talk to you soon."

The Metallica concert was absolutely awesome.  The concert was done in the round so that people could surround the stage and the band did a good job of making sure they played to everyone.  Add to that the fact that the stage itself rotated and that makes for a cool concert right there.  They didn't play many of my favourites, but they played a lot of the standards, and the pyro for ""One"" has to be seen to be believed.

That being said, there were two really big downsides to the show.  The first was all the pot smoking and the second was all the moshing.  Now, ignoring all the debate about whether or not marijuana is or is not harmful or should or should not be legalized, aren't we, as a society, beyond moshing?  I mean, seriously, folks, I didn't pay $100 so that some jackass could ram himself into me.  And the overwhelming argument that these people seemed to use was, ""Hey, man, it's a Metallica concert.  You should have expected this.""  No, jackass.  I expected to rock out to Metallica, and <i>maybe</i> having to cram myself into a pile of people to get as close to the stage as possible.  I <i>didn't</i> expect to have some doped-up loser bouncing around and into me for the duration of the show.  Assface.

Anyway, the job search is still going poorly.  I guess most firms in a small town really don't have the ability to hire a student, which kind of sucks.  First off, you lose a lot of offices simply because they don't have the office space for a student, whether they would like to hire one or not.  Then, the firm needs to have enough work to justify hiring a student.  Realistically, if hiring a student means that one of the lawyers themselves will basically be sitting idle, there's not enough work for a student.  When I get to be a lawyer, though, I'm gonna do the best I can to hire a student.  Nobody should have to go through the kind of crap I am.

Other than that, not much else.  Hope everyone else is doing better than I am and I'll hopefully talk to you all again soon."

As per usual, sorry for the lack of updates.  I'm still a little bit bitter over the job and I've been having family issues.  I'm gonna be keeping this update short, just cause I don't really have much to talk about.

First, and probably most importantly, I've been spending a lot of my time coming up with some strategies for finding a job once I get home.  Obviously I need to find an articling position to meet my BAC requirements but, more importantly, I need a source of income to start covering my loans.  Anyway, thanks to everyone who've expressed condolences.  I'll be back on my feet sooner or later somehow.

Second, hopefully I'll have my Summerslam/Raw journal up sometime before I move home.  Basically, I took a little notebook with me to both events and jotted down notes from the journey.  Not my funniest stuff ever, but some nice comedic moments.  Nothing from during the shows, since I decided to just enjoy them, but I might be able to throw in some stuff from memory.

Finally, as noted above, I'll be coming home Saturday.  Obviously, when I get home I won't have any internet access, so I can't be sure when the next update will be coming.  I'll probably be making arrangements with Rogers, but I'd rather give it some time so that I can clean up and not be <i>totally</i> embarrassed when the service guy shows up.

"event","So, it struck me when tonight when I got stuck behind three people who <i>somehow</i> managed to never have been in a McDonalds before and, consequently, didn't know what there was to offer, that life needs time limits.

The idea originally stems from, who else, Henry Rollins.  As a world traveler, Hank has to put up with all sorts of imbeciles when at the airport and it annoys him to no end.  Having had to take a plane at least once a week, he has the check-in routine at the airport down to a science, limited only by how slow the people in front of him are.  Consequently, people who can't seem to figure out they should take all the metal objects out of their pockets before passing through the metal detector invoke his wrath.

Such people, Henry opines, should be forced to use their own lines.  The idiot line, I believe he calls it.  Anyone who knows what they're doing and won't hold anyone up gets to do their thing and go right on through.  And that's when inspiration struck.  Why can't we extend this principle to everything in life?

You folks know what I'm talking about.  You get stuck behind that person in line who seemingly has no idea what's going on.  Maybe it's someone who waits until they're actually <i>on</i> the bus to go searching through their backpack for their bus pass.  Or someone who waits until they're actually at the counter of the fast food place to read the menu.  Or someone who's apparently never seen an ATM before.  Regardless of what it is, countless precious minutes of your life are being wasted because some mouth breather is content to waste <b>their</b> time.

So I propose we as a society implement time limits on activities that involve forming a line.  When you get to the front of the line, if you can't complete your task in a certain allotted amount of time, some penalty should be incurred.  Personally, I think a severe beating should be in order, but maybe we could just force these people to go to the back of the line.

Don't have your change ready, like, immediately upon getting on the bus?  Wait for the next one.  Can't take $20 out of a bank machine in less than two minutes?  Here's your card back.  This machine won't accept it until it processes another transaction.

Is this really such a horrible suggestion?  It's not like I'm saying people aren't allowed to be morons.  I'm just saying that us brighter people shouldn't be penalized for <b>not</b> being morons."

"event","What's up folks?  Quick update this time around, as I pretty much just want to vent on how people can really be pricks.

First off, yesterday, I was approached by one of my fellow students about the job interview I had last week.  (No, I haven't heard anything.)  Anyway, he pointed out that, when he heard they were hiring, he seriously considered calling up the place where he had agreed to work next year and quitting so he could apply for this job.  

Now, aside from the fact that we had been told since first year that that sort of thing was <i>extremely</i> unprofessional and should only be done in extreme circumstances, I had even more reason to be pissed off.  See, the job this guy was thinking of quitting was the articling position with the Crown Attorney's office in London.  To put it in perspective, if someone were to ask me what the one job I wanted more than any other was, it would have been that one.  So, aside from the fact that he had taken that job from me (not maliciously, of course), here he was saying he was thinking of quitting and basically taking another job from me.  What an asshole.

Fast forward to tonight.  I was taking my usually Friday trip to McDonalds for some cheap Filet-O-Fish action and a guy wanders up to wait for the bus as well.  Normally, I wouldn't think that much of it, but this guy was sporting an Orientation Staff bag.  I fucking hate O-Staff.  They are seriously the most egotistical people at Western.  

By was of example, I had a pretty important position at Western this year.  But <b>never</b> did I act like my position made me better than anyone.  In fact, I considered my position to be something like public service (kind of like professional assassination), making me subordinate to others.  By contrast, O-Staff not only <i>act</i> like they're better than everyone else, they pretty much tell themselves and anyone else who'll listen that they're better than everyone else.  Abuse of power and privilege, rampant acts of ego-stroking, and favoritism are all common occurrences with these fuckheads.  Basically, if you know someone on O-Staff, you have my express permission to punch them in the head.  (Note:  For the purposes of legal liability and responsibility, you do not have my permission to punch them in the head.  But do it anyways.)

Anyway, by the time the bus came a girl was waiting for it as well.  We all got on and the bus went along its way.  Until the next stop where the girl got off.  What the fuck?  How lazy do you have to be to take the bus a fucking block?  All you're really doing is slowing everyone else down from getting to their destination.  I swear, if I was the bus driver, I just would have kept going.  What a waste of everyone's time.  

And before people comment, ""Oh, but she paid for a bus pass.  She has the right to get on the bus and take it as far as she wants,"" I realize that.  She also has a right to get on an elevator and hit every button and then get off on the next floor.  Just because you <i>can</i> do something, doesn't mean it's to be done.

But all of this pales into comparison to the biggest asshole I know, my neighbouring roommate.  This guy has to be the most ignorant fucktard I've ever met.  I mean, it's readily apparent that he's never lived with anyone beyond his Mommy.  I say that, because it's readily apparent that he's lived with someone who's been perfectly content to clean up his messes after he makes them.  And, oh, what messes there are.  

Basically, whenever this guy is finished with something, he just leaves it where it is.  It's not that uncommon for me to go to use the kitchen and find his dishes and garbage all over the counter.  Once, I found a cookie bag and the tray that the cookies sit in <b>separate</b> on the counter.  The living room is regularly made to look like a garbage dump by all the shit he leaves lying around there:  newspapers, dirty clothes, textbooks.  It just never ends.

And the messes are just the beginning.  His music that he feels the need to leave playing in the kitchen loud enough so he can hear it from his room or in the bathroom or even down the hall, since he seems to enjoying turning it on and then leaving.  Speaking of leaving, dipshit has no problem leaving the front door wide open.  I guess he doesn't have any problem with the thought of someone stealing his stuff.  If someone wants a free DVD player or bicycle and is living in London this year, room 613 at Essex is your place.  (Note:  Once again, this isn't permission.  I'm just saying.  Leave the toaster, though.  It's mine.)

Anyhow, I'm done venting for now.  Hopefully by this time next week I'll have some good news about the job.  Talk to everyone then."

"event","Hey, folks.  Standard stuff.  Sorry for the lack of updates but nothing really's been happening, as per usual.

Biggest thing to happen in the last two weeks was a job interview I had yesterday.  I think it went really well and I really hope to get the job, but I won't know until at least the end of the month.  Don't ask.  I'll post information when I get it.  I'd rather not get into answering emails like every day about how I haven't heard yet since it'll only make me dwell on it longer.

Actually, getting ready for the interview was probably more stressful than the interview itself.  First off, I came home from class and I checked my email so I could make sure I had the address of the office.  It's a good thing that I did, though, cause the interview that I <i>thought</i> was at 2:30 turned out to be at 2:00!  So naturally I had to really bust my ass to get ready.

After a quick shower, I went to shine my shoes and, of course, the bottle leaked or something and I ended up with shoe polish all over my hands!  With time running down, it was back to the bathroom to try and scrub all the black stains off my hands.

Once that was out of the way, I got all suited up.  I noticed that, while my hair was generally pretty good, my ponytail looked really scraggly.  So I draped it over my shoulder and started taking a brush to it.  Of course, my hair was still damp so I ended up leaving a nice big wet patch on my shirt!  Luckily, I was able to dry it out enough that it blended in with the shirt before I left.

Anyway, like I said, I think the interview went really well.  It's the perfect job for what I'm looking for so I'd really like to get it.  I'll write more about it when I find out if I get it.

Take it easy, folks, and I'll update when I update."

"event","Hey, folks.  Just checking in so that everyone knows I haven't fallen off the face of the Earth or anything.  A couple quick points and I'll send you on your merry way.

First off, Movieguy and I saw Dodgeball about a week ago and, let me just say, that it's one of the funniest movies I've ever seen.  It's got a great mix of intellectual and slapstick comedy.  If you see one movie this summer, make it Dodgeball.  If you see two movies this summer, see Dodgeball twice.  Ha ha.

Anyway, some of you may have noticed the changed screen name to promote <a href=""http://www.micahelmoorehatesamerica.com"">Michael Moore Hates America</a>.  I'm sure I'll be taking flak (as I already am), for not jumping on the Michael Moore bandwagon.  Let me just say, that's not the point at all.  I'm not promoting a political stance in any way, shape, or form.  I'm not saying I love Bush or that I support war or anything else that could be remotely political.  I'm also not saying Moore is wrong or lying or anything like that.  

What I <i>am</i> saying is that I'm pretty tired of people taking everything that Michael Moore says in his movies and books as gospel and not thinking sceptically about the message.  Penn Jillette, my main man, puts it best when he says that all interviews and clips and such shown in a documentary are, of necessity, taken out of context.  Michael Moore makes either conscious or unconscious decisions about what to include in his movies and what to edit out and this leaves the viewer with a different impression than they may have had had they been there.

Anyway, coming back down off my apple box, I just want to say that I hope everyone has a happy Canada Day (or Independence Day, on the remote chance that I have American readers) and I'll be back with another update sometime soon."

"event","Yes, ladies and gentlemen, the Jackass of the Week Award makes a one time return while on summer hiatus for one very special person.

So, I was writing my Civil Litigation exam today and, in case you didn't know, the Law Society takes these exams <b>very</b> seriously.  I'm supposed to show up at least 45 minutes in advance to check in.  My ID must be on display at all times.  In the 3 and a half scheduled hours, you can only leave in a 45 minute window toward the end.  You get the idea.

Anyway, the exams are supervised by a bunch of people called <b>THE INVIGILATORS.</b>  You may think these people are proctors (they're actually strikingly similar), but you'd be wrong as they are <b>THE INVIGILATORS.</b>  But I digress.

There's this one girl in the class who I'm not a huge fan of.  You see, most of the people who teach seminars are, hmmm... how to put this... idiots who just like to hear themselves talk.  When I finally got a good guy who was like, ""I don't want to see anyone fail so, after we discuss exercises, I will read you exactly what the Law Society tells me in the notes they give me."" she gets him moved to a different seminar.

How did she do this you may ask?  Well, this guy made a joke about how the Law Society obviously fails students in order to weed out the riff raff.  Now, if you didn't have the mental acuity to get it was a joke (because who uses the words riff raff <i>without</i> making a joke, nowadays), he followed it up with a little laugh.  This psycho then proceeds to snap, having just found out she failed the first exam, loses it on the class, and storms out of the room.  Total overreaction.

Anyway, this psycho is writing the exam a couple seats down from me when she puts up her hand.  Seems she has a question about one of the questions.  <b>THE INVIGILATOR</b> comes up, finds out her problem, and goes to track down the person in charge to relay the question.  Now, in case I haven't mentioned it, this lady refuses to answer <i>any</i> question in case the imparting of that iota of wisdom should upset the balance of fairness that supposedly pervades this course.  So, <b>THE INVIGILATOR</b> returns with the answer which, obviously, didn't suit psycho's tastes.  So she sent <b>THE INVIGILATOR</b> <i>back</i> out to try to get an answer again.  When <b>THE INVIGILATOR</b> returned, still without an answer, the girl picked up her exam and stormed out of the room to go seek answers for herself.

Now, call me crazy, but in an exam where I have to be <i>escorted</i> to the washroom by <b>AN INVIGILATOR</b> to make sure I don't cheat, shouldn't walking out of the exam room with your exam and nobody else be grounds for an insta-fail?  I mean, seriously, what does this perfection freak need to know that <i>nobody else in the room needed to know?</i>

Hey, psycho!  Suck it up and admit you don't know the answer and move on to the next question!  I swear that she's lucky that after I finished the exam I didn't walk right down to the office and demand she be failed on the spot for that shit on the grounds that she could have cheated and skewed the curve."

"event","So, as I'm sure many of you know, I recently got The A-Team Season One and Quantum Leap Season One on DVD.  I was really looking forward to watching them, as I have fond memories of both shows from when I was a kid.  What I got was a mixed bag, though.

A-Team was wonderful.  It looks like it's been digitally remastered, so all the colour looks bright and vibrant as opposed to television where it looks a little washed out and faded.  Everything about the set is tremendous, right down to each disc having the face of one of the team, and the gatefold cover having the opening monologue written on it.

On the other hand, I had to scratch my head at what I ever saw in Quantum Leap.  First off, I'm not knocking the special effects or anything.  I mean, you do what you can with the technology you have.  I'm sure that, back in the day, the effects were really cool.  I'm talking about the cruddy writing.

With only a few exceptions, every episode contains the same elements:

1.  Sam needs to [insert task here], but he doesn't know how to [insert task here].  Luckily, Al is a [insert type of person who would know how to do task] and can show Sam how to do it.

2.  Either of the following:  Sam meets a hot woman who isn't interested in him in the least that he needs to romance <b>or</b> Sam ends up married to or dating a hot woman and is awkward at the prospect of sleeping with her.

Here's a quick recap of the entire season:

Episode 1 - ""Oh no!  I need to fly a plane!  But I don't know how to fly a plane!  Luckily, Al is a retired astronaut and can show me how to do it.  Also, I'm married to a woman and I'm feeling awkward at the prospect of sleeping with her.""

Episode 2 - ""Oh no!  I'm an English Literature professor and one of my students is throwing herself at me!  I'm awkward at the prospect of sleeping with her.  Also, my future fiancee is here and I feel the need to romance her.""

Episode 3 - ""Oh no!  I need to box!  But I don't know how to box!  Luckily, Al is a former Golden Gloves champ and can show me how to do it.  Also, I'm dating a stripper and I'm feeling awkward at the prospect of sleeping with her.""

Episode 4 - ""Oh no!  I need to break a horse's spirit!  But I don't know how to break a horse's spirit!  Luckily, Al is a hologram that animals can see and are calmed by.  (Huh?)  Also, there's a really hot cowgirl that I need to romance.""

Episode 5 - ""Oh no!  I need to speak Italian!  But I don't know how to speak Italian!  Luckily, Al's an Italian and can show me how to do it!  Also, a hot hairdresser throws herself at me repeatedly and I'm awkward at the prospect of sleeping with her.""

Episode 6 - ""Oh no!  I need to make chitlins!  But I don't know how to make chitlins!  Luckily, Al was a desegregation protester who ate lots of chitlins and can show me how to do it!  Hey, shouldn't there be a hot woman around here somewhere?""

Episode 7 - ""Oh no!  I need to win a drag race!  But I don't know how to win a drag race!  Luckily, Al is a car enthusiast and can show me how to do it!  Also, a 16 year old girl has a crush on me and I'm awkward at the prospect of sleeping with her.""

Episode 8 - ""Oh no!  I need to solve a mystery.  Oh, wait.  I can do that myself.  Not only that, but a hot woman is throwing herself at me and I've got no problem with that whatsoever.""

Gee, were the writers on vacation or something?  Talk about a general lack of originality.  It's weird too because, if you really wanted to generalize, A-Team <i>kind of</i> falls into the same pattern.  Every episode has Hannibal in a disguise meeting with the unsuspecting client, a warehouse or barn full of stuff welded together to make sophisticated weapons and/or vehicles, and either Murdock breaking out of the hospital or Hannibal tricking B.A. onto a plane or both.  Maybe I never got tired of it cause the whole episode never centered on these things.

Anyway, strong recommendation to get A-Team, mild recommendation to avoid Quantum Leap."

"event","Well, it's been over a week since my convocation, and it was a day of ups and downs.

The morning ceremony was really nice.  It was a tasteful, small affair with a nice speech by the dean, our guest speaker, and the valedictorian.  It'll probably be my fondest memory of the day.

The rest of the day was just terrible, though.  For one thing, the university seems to basically view this day as one last attempt to fuck you in the ass and take you for money.  As such, the cost for the rental of a robe and hood (both required) is <b>$25.00!  A rental!</b>  For what I've paid to this university, I deserve to get the use of it for free.

Not only that, but distribution was terrible, with the trademark Western neverending lines and idiots that I swear they bus in.  For instance, the two girls in front of me couldn't grasp the concept of ""cash only"" and one of them decided to debate with the cashier that she should be allowed to pay via bank card.  When that didn't work, she decided to <i>hit the line up for money!</i>  I swear, they should have just asked her for her name and revoked her degree on the spot for being such a fucking idiot.

The day was sweltering hot as well, so what better way to spend in than standing for two hours in a fucking gymnasium!  Can't entirely blame the university on that one though, since the vast majority of the grads seemed to be idiots who couldn't seem to grasp the concept of ""standing in alphabetical order.""

The guest speaker was <b>terrible</b>, seemingly only to have been brought in for the Ivey grads.  Instead of delivering the typical words of encouragement, however, the guy decided to talk, at length, about how great he was and how much he deserved the honourary degree.  It was a crock.

And, finally, as a capper, ignorant fucking parents and <i>grads</i> (yes, grads!) were walking out of the ceremony!  What the fuck?  Every student's accomplishment was just as valued as yours or your kids, so sit down, shut the fuck up, and show some god damn respect!  It really is an indictment of our society that we're so self-centred that we can't be bothered to sit in an air conditioned auditorium for a couple of hours on a hot summer day.  ""Well, none of this is about me anymore, so fuck all of you.""  I fucking hate people.

Anyway, back to the old grind.  More updates sooner, hopefully."

"event","Hey, folks.  Once again, sorry for the lack of updates.  As per usual, the Bar Ads. keep me pretty busy.

Wrote my Real Estate exam today, actually.  Boy am I glad that's over.  Probably the dullest, most confusing topic ever.  And they somehow think that 52 multiple choice questions will adequately prove how well we learned three weeks of material.  Yeah, right.

Anyway, also did my negotiation assessment on Monday.  How did it go, you ask?  Well, considering that my clients were willing to spend $6000 on a ten day closing date extension (don't ask), I'd say covering the other sides' expenses to stay at a relative's apartment with the cost capped at $1000 is pretty damn good.  (Oh, and don't forget to provide receipts.)  I went in, chewed bubble gum, and kicked ass.  And I was all out of bubble gum.

Ha ha.  Seriously, though, not a lot's been going on.  The Bar Admission Course has been keeping me pretty busy lately.

I did actually meet this great girl online.  (Yeah, yeah.  I know.)  Anyway, interesting story:  I told one of my other internet chums that I met this girl and she like <i>lost</i> it on me.  Just snapped.  Seems she was jealous or put off or something cause I hadn't offered to meet her or something.  (Apparently there's some rule that I wasn't aware of that says if you talk to one girl online, you're strictly forbidden from talking to <b>anyone else.</b>)

So, anyway, apparently she insisted that I was talking to this girl cause I was pissed off that she wouldn't put out.  I found that odd since I didn't think so.  I mean, I would think that I would know why I was talking to someone else, but there you go.

Interesting final note:  She told me early on in our friendship that she had a policy of not meeting guys in person that she met online.  And then would proceed to tell me like every other week about how she met another guy in person and how she didn't like him.  But <b>I</b> was the jerk in this whole thing.  Whatever.

Anyway, I was supposed to go out with this other girl last week but the longest string of bad luck <b>ever</b> kept that from happening.  Tuesday her dad came to visit her, so that was out.  Wednesday she took her car in to get new tires and found out she needed a new front axle.  Thursday she came down with some sort of flu or something and had to cancel all her plans for that night.  Finally, Friday she <i>broke her ankle!</i>  What the hell is up with that?  I mean, what sort of crazy ass karma did I (or she, for that matter) build up to merit that?  Oh well, we're gonna try to get together for next week.

Hopefully something interesting happens to me in less than 10 days this time so I can update a little bit sooner.  Later, folks."

"event","Just some short rants on a few random topics today, as I'm in a bit of a rush to finish all the reading I have for tomorrow (not to mention Smackdown! and the Survivor special, which I'm only watching to see where the next season will be and when it will start).

First off, in a sort of Jackass of the Week award, I've got to hand it to the ignorant bitch in my Bar Admission seminar who found her comfort more important than everyone else's ability to learn.

Now, I'm not saying this girl was fat (I'd be in the worst position to point the finger there), but she wasn't thin, either.  Let's just say she's the kind of girl who'd need to catch her breath after a particularly long flight of stairs.

Anyway, I guess Fatty McFatfat was breaking out in a sweat from all the typing she was doing, cause on the break she hunted down one of the coordinators and bitched and complained until they agreed to open the windows.  Now normally this wouldn't be a problem, except for the <b>fucking bus that drives by every five minutes!</b>  So, instead of getting to listen to the lecture and actually, you know, learn something, I have to listen to busses stopping at and leaving the intersection for the better part of two hours.  But that's alright, cause the poster child for plus sizes is comfortable.

Not much else going on lately.  I've finally acclimated myself to the bed in my room.  Interestingly enough, when Housing was buying new furniture for the residences, they decided to save on box springs and just put mattresses on top of boards.  Basically, these things have absolutely <i>no</i> give so I had to get out of the habit of just falling on the bed when I'm tired (as I frequently am).

Speaking of Housing, I really have to shake my head at the caliber of person that they hire.  Or at least some of them.  I bumped into the incoming manager of Saugeen today and, I have to admit, was a bit insulted by his conduct.  I smiled and said hello and this guy just ignored me.  Apparently, since I'm now completely divested from Housing, I'm not deserving of respect from its employees.  Hmm... interesting.  Hope they keep that in mind when they expect a donation.

Speaking of managers, turns out that I basically had no chance of getting the assistant manager position at Saugeen because my penis seemed to be getting in the way.  I was thinking about it today and noticed that, of the five candidates who got interviewed, the three I know (and the one who got the job) were all female.  Not only that, but, in living in Saugeen for eight years, I don't recall a single same-sex manager/assistant manager pairing.  Not that I'm saying that Housing's hiring practices are discriminatory.  That could be libel and I'd <i>never</i> do that.  Just putting some facts out there.

Other than that, not much going on.  Enjoying Law & Order Season 2 and awaiting my copies of A-Team Season 1 and Quantum Leap Season 1.  God, I have no life."

"event","So Survivor last night turned out, by and large, to be pretty hum drum, at least for a final episode.  The power couple managed to steamroll over Rupert and Jenna and get themselves to the final two, just like I figured.  Jenna played it right, though.  Why risk your guaranteed third place prize money when there's a one in three shot you could end up with less?  Of course, there could have been some backstabbage going on, but it was still the right play.

The jury questioning was the standard ""I hate you for how you played!""/""I respect how you played!"" crap that happens every year but I have to admit I was a bit surprised that Rob got as many votes as he did.

I even called Rob proposing to Amber, although I figured that would be the ""shocking twist"".  Even I have to admit that it was pretty sweet, though.  I may not have liked Rob as a person, but you have to feel good for someone finding their special someone.  That's worth more than a million dollars.  At least it is to me.  But what do I know?  I'm fat.

Even the reunion stuff was pretty crappy though.  It all just managed to center on Rob pissing people off and whether that was morally right within the context of the game.  Which is kind of stupid cause if Probst had the balls to ask the hard-hitting questions, he would have dove on the Richard/Susan wang touching incident.  Guess CBS sent down the directive to keep the show a fluff piece.

So, instead, we ended up with attention junkie Richard trying to steal the spotlight from the back row.  Note to R. Hatch:  Nobody cares about anybody in the back row.  You're just there to round out the reunion.  Sit down and shut the fuck up.  Note to R. Hatch #2:  Everyone loved you on Survivor 1 because you were the conniving villain.  You have since been surpassed a dozen times and blown out of the water on All-Stars by Boston Rob.

As for Jerri copping a hissy-fit and storming off midway through the show:  cry me a river.  ""We're real people, not characters.  Boo hoo.""  Fuck that.  She had no problem whoring herself out to whoever would pay her fee after her turn in the Outback.  As if that wasn't enough, she agreed to do the show that <i>cast</i> her as ""America's most hated bitch"" a <i>second</i> time.  What did she think they were going to do?  Make her out to be just like the beloved Elizabeth?  What a fucking moron.

Anyway, CBS is now <b>really</b> seeing how much they can milk the Survivor cow.  Aside from making this season longer with more contestants, there's now a <i>second</i> reunion special where they're giving away another million bucks to the winner of a popularity contest.  Yawn.

To close on a side note, congrats to Movieguy for getting his new job.  I know it's the sort of thing you're gonna have lots of fun doing and, though we're not gonna get to see each other as often now, I'm happy for ya."

"event","First off, sorry for the lack of updates lately.  Seems that I sent the power cable to my computer home rather than bring it to Essex hall with me.  That left me without a computer for the last couple of days.  It's gonna be a bit longer without access too, since it takes the ITS people one or two days from the time they get your request to hook you up.  That really blows.

Anyway, Essex is taking a fair bit of adjustment.  I have a <i>much</i> smaller room, which has some advantages, but mostly disadvantages.  I've got a nice bathroom, but I need to share it with one of my suitemates.  Yes, Essex actually put me in a suite with two other guys.  Now, don't get me wrong.  I was expecting one other guy, but not two.

They're both pretty nice guys, though.  I just wish they'd be a little bit more sociable.  Seems that I'm the only one who's spent any real time outside of his room.  Even the guy who's taking the Bar Admission Course with me is sort of impersonal.

And don't even get me started on the course.  I don't want to get into details here, but let's just say that I'm pretty underwhelmed.  I could have slept in like any day this week and, as long as I made it to the seminar, not missed anything.  Oh well.  It's their game, you have to play by their rules, I guess.

Anyhow, I'm home for some destressing this weekend and then back for my Professional Responsibility exam on Monday.  Wish me luck.  I'm gonna need it."

I spent most of that time sitting next to the computer waiting for (who I thought was) my girlfriend at the time to come online so I could find out what was going on in our relationship.  (Oh, by the way, it was over.)

Anyhow, it's been a mixed bag for me lately since being home.  I've had a lot of fun playing Hitman:  Contracts with Movieguy (even though I shouldn't have bought it).  I've been pretty nervous cause I start classes on Monday again.  Hoo-fuckin'-ray on that one.  I even took the opportunity to MSN with the ex for a little while.  She didn't mention the fiancee like she normally does, so that was a plus.  Still, I don't really know if we could ever be friends again.  I mean, there's always the whole ""I never thought we were anything serious"" thing hanging over my head.  Did I mention Christmas sucked?  Anyway...

If you get the chance, pick up The Cooler.  It's a really great movie.  Interestingly enough, I <b>really</b> identify with Bernie.  The movie plays out a lot like my relationship with the ex, actually.  Except Natalie doesn't leave Bernie to marry Johnny Capella.  Oh well.  

Like Bernie, I found it really hard to believe that someone as great as her could be interested in me.  Of course, I guess she wasn't.  There's the lesson to be learned from that one:  Hollywood's fiction, not real life.  At the end of the day, the lovable loser is usually still a loser.

Anyway, back to Western on Wednesday.  Seems I can't move into rez before then, which really sucks for the first three days of class.  And the exam I have next Monday.  Well, I made it through three years of law school, I can make it through four months of the bar ads.  The big thing is going to be finding an articling position.

In closing, I'd just like to say <b>leave more comments!</b>  I mean, I love writing on this board and making you folks laugh or think occasionally, but it would be nice to get some positive feedback.  Let me know what you think.

"event","Okay, so my goal is to make the phrase ""sitting next to Lemmy"" part of regular conversation.  I strongly encourage you readers to use it as much as possible.

<b>Sitting next to Lemmy</b> - phrase.  Describes a situation where someone, in thinking they are doing a favour, really does something to make a situation worse.  Usage:  ""Every time I go home for dinner, Mom insists on making haggis.  Am I ever gonna be sitting next to Lemmy tonight.""

As with most stuff in my life, this started with a story from Henry Rollins.  It seems that Henry was sitting on a small plane in Switzerland waiting for a flight somewhere.  For some reason, the plane wasn't leaving.  Turns out the plane was waiting for just a few more passengers.  Those passengers?  Motorhead.  

When the band finally gets there, Lemmy looks around and finds an empty seat next to Henry.  Seeing a fellow metalhead, Lemmy decides he and Henry with both have a great time spending the flight together.

Now, for those of you who don't know Lemmy, here is a picture:

<img src=""http://www.imotorhead.com/graphics/lemmyvai2.jpg"">

So, as you can tell, Lemmy's about the <b>last</b> guy on the face of the earth livin' the rock and roll lifestyle.  He was also one of the first.  He's probably the last guy you would want to sit next to on a flight.  But Henry get stuck cause Lemmy thinks Henry would appreciate it.  Hence, sitting next to Lemmy.

So there you go.  You now have a new toy in your bag of language tricks.  Use it as much as you can."

"event","So, it became official today.  Just about two hours ago, in fact.  I won't even be getting an interview for the position of Assistant Manager of Saugeen.  And so my time ends, not with a bang, but with a whimper.

I can't help but feel bothered by it, though.  Not only did I not get the interview, which, as outlined earlier, I felt entitled to, but the news came in an email from one of the peons over at the Housing Office.  Now, I'd <i>like</i> to think that the Director of Housing and I have a good working relationship, but this would seem to indicate otherwise.  I mean, she couldn't even be bothered to take the five minutes to write this email that was mostly form letter.  All of this got me to thinking, though.  Why am I so upset?

I mean, coming from a blue collar family, I heard this sort of thing all the time.  So and so worked for Whatever Company for X years and then they just fired him.  He deserved better.  They <i>owed</i> it to him.

I never bought into that, though.  I mean, all they really <i>owed</i> him was his pay, right?  That's sort of the idea of employment.  You work X hours a day for Y dollars an hour.  The contract could be ended at any time (subject to contractual terms and statutory limitations) and that was that.  So then why am I so bitter that I never got an interview or even an email from a specific person?  I mean, they don't owe me, right?  Or am I just some kind of hypocrite?

And I think this is sort of where the human element comes in.  I mean, the shareholders (or the management, for that matter) in a company probably don't know the menial labourers.  The guys who punch in at 9 and punch out at 5 everyday.  Ultimately, they're just numbers shuffled around on paper.

For me, there was that personal element.  I got rejected by someone who I was on a first name basis with that I've even worked side by side with on occasion.  I was essentially told by that person, ""You're not even worth the 5 minutes it would take me to write this email.""  Maybe that makes me different and maybe it doesn't.  I don't really know.

Hopefully something could will come out of this, though.  I've oftentimes heard Henry Rollins talk about rejection.  Rejection by girls, true, but I think some if it applies here.

Essentially, he said that, when you get rejected, you enter a sort of personal recession.  You get so depressed that you strip away everything from your life that you view as unnecessary.  You don't waste time on it because you simply don't want to.  You become focused on the important stuff so much so that you reach a level that you never could have while you were worrying about what rejected you.  Hopefully, I can do that with my search for an articling position.  More likely, I'll do it with video games.  Ugh."

"event","Well, stuff's been slowing down around here for me lately.  After finishing my last exam Wednesday of last week, I've basically been putting in extra hours at the computer lab and tying up council business.  I've also been busy on some other fronts, though.

I applied for the available Assistant Manager position here at Saugeen for next year a couple of weeks ago.  Now, I know you're saying this has <i>nothing</i> to do with articling and you'd be right.  Mainly because I haven't had the time to do a proper job search this year, I thought it might be nice to take a year off and properly exercise my options.

Of course, having been drilled on interviews by law school, I already started evaluating myself.  I can think of half a dozen reasons why I <i>shouldn't</i> get the position, the main one being that I have no experience as rez staff.  I bring a lot of stuff to the table, though, that I have to figure is unique to me, not the least of which is my presidency this year.

So, imagine my surprise when I haven't even been called for an interview.  Like I said, I know why I shouldn't get the job, but, quite frankly, I find not even being given the chance to plead my case, as it were, insulting.  It's basically Housing saying, ""You're not worth the half hour of time it would take us to give you an interview.""  

That's the annoying part.  After all the time I've basically <b>given</b> to Housing this year, I can't even get a lousy letter saying I'm not being considered for the position and giving some form letter reason why, like, ""We've had a lot of qualified applicants and, unfortunately, we don't have the time to interview them all.""

I've still got a little hope, though.  I talked to some people and it's apparent that Housing is staggering the interviews.  One person got their call on Tuesday for an interview Friday while another person didn't get their call until Friday.  So I guess there's still a slim chance.

Anyway, as for Penn & Teller:  Bullshit!, I'm really sorry it's not up yet.  The main reason is the sheer length of it.  It's really difficult to summarize each episode, without giving up too much, in a fairly concise manner.  It's turning into more of a report than a review and, since it's not like I get paid to do it, it's not much of a priority for me.  I <i>do</i> intend to complete it, though.  I'm just not making any more promises as to when."

"event","Yep, you read that right.  Your everbitter blue-eyed psycho is actually having a pretty good day.

I turned in my last university exam ever today at about 11:30, which was really nice.  It's not like it was a tremendously moving experience, cause I start the Bar Admission Course in about two weeks, but I'm basically done with Western for all intents and purposes.

When I finally ended up getting back to my room, I found an instant message from Movieguy.  Seems that Law & Order Season 2 is <b>finally</b> coming out in a couple of weeks, as well.  And, since I just happened to have a $15 gift certificate kicking around, I placed the order right away.  I'll have to wait a while because of the free shipping, but I'm not in any hurry.

Anyway, now that I'm done school for the next while, I <i>promise</i> that the review for Penn & Teller: Bullshit! will go up tonight.  A word of warning, though.  I really loved the show, I'm gonna end up gushing, and the show's gonna get an insanely high rating.

Here's how the new review system's gonna work:

Each episode will be either a plus, a minus, or a neutral.  I think it's self explanitory, but a good rule of thumb is that an episode is a plus if it's good enough that you'd watch it again on your own, a neutral if you'd watch it again with a friend, and a negative if you have no intentions of watching the show again.  An episode basically needs to be <b>really</b> bad to be a negative, acting as a detriment to the set simply by being there.

Basically, you add up all the ratings to get a score for the set.  From this you get two scores.  

First, there's the raw score, which is the base number you got.  This allows something like Law & Order Season 1 (with 22 episodes) to blow something like Best of Insomniac Volume 1 (with 5 episodes) out of the water (as it rightfully should) just because there's simply more content.

Second, you divide the raw score by the number of episodes in the set, getting a percentage of potential, or POP.  This is for people who want bang for their buck.  Smaller sets will tend to get a lower raw score, but can score high on the POP, indicating that it's worth what you're paying for it (depending on the price, of course).

As for extras, since they're generally stuff that you didn't get the set for, they can only be pluses or neutrals, but they also don't factor into the scores.  I've seen some really worthless extras, but I don't buy a DVD just for the extras, though they have been the deciding factor before.  Basically consider the total extra pluses a deal maker or breaker when you're sitting on the fence about a set.

Anyway, what did we learn from all this?  That I'm a stats nerd with <b>lots</b> of free time on my hands."

"event","Way, way back when I was in third year Computer Science, I took a course on networks.  As a special bonus one day, the prof had the university's system administrator, a modest guy who preferred to be called Magi, come in to lecture us.  He opened his lecture with a simple point:

""I am a system administrator.  All of you are users.  Therefore, I hate all of you.""

Boy, do I know how he feels.

I used to always tell my buddy Movieguy that I couldn't understand how he did it.  He's worked in retail for about as long as I can remember, most of it in probably the lowest level, a video store.  I always told him that I would snap on someone and try to kill them.  I nearly reached that point today.

Now, obviously, in my two current jobs, I <i>do</i> have to deal with people.  Just not to a very significant degree.  Today was the exception, though, as the computer lab was crazy busy for the last day of class.  But I'm getting ahead of myself.

So I show up to work, and the first thing I notice is a sign right beside the lab door at about head level.  It basically said something along the lines of, ""Lab will be closing at 4 PM today.  Sorry for any inconvenience.""  It was readily apparent that this would be <i>quite</i> the inconvenience.  The last day of classes means a lot of papers are due and everyone would be trying to get theirs in.

And busy it was.  In the four hours I was there, we did almost $150 worth of business.  The one printer was emptied of paper and I've <b>never</b> seen that before.  And, of course, more business means more idiots.  I actually had this conversation today:

Moron:  What does it mean when a file comes up as gibberish?
Me:  It usually means the file is in the wrong format for the application you're using.
Moron:  Well, it can't be.  I've used it before.  It's a .pdf file.
Me:  What are you trying to read it in?
Moron:  Word.
Me:  You... are a moron.

I mean, seriously, how did you get this far without knowing a .pdf file requires the use of Adobe Acrobat?  I was willing to let that slide, though.  As I said, the printer actually ran out of paper.  Someone pointed this out to me, so I went to get some more paper.  On my way, I actually had <i>this</i> conversation:

Jackass:  Hi, can I put some money on my account?
Me:  Sure, but the printer is out of paper.
Jackass:  Well, that's alright.  I'm not trying to print anything right now.
Me:  That may be the case but do you think maybe, just maybe, one of the other dozen people in the lab might be?  Including the guy who asked me a couple of minutes ago to restock the printer?
Jackass:  Oh.

The kicker, however, actually came at 4:00 PM.  Experience has shown me that you can make a sign as large and as flashy as you want, put it wherever you want, and people will still ignore it.  I mean, what was the first thing I noticed when I got to work?  The sign that said the lab would be closing at 4:00.  Not unreasonable, then, to expect that everyone would be aware of that, right?  <b>Wrong!</b>

I start telling people to log out and leave because the lab is closing and some of them were actually surprised!  How could you be surprised?  Did you just ignore the sign?  

They then followed it up with indignation.  ""How could you be closing the lab?  It's the last day of class!  I was relying on the lab to finish my paper!""  Hey, it's not my decision, it's not my fault, and it's certainly not my problem, so don't take it out on me.

Finally, at about 4:02, with the lab closed, I actually had <i>this</i> conversation when a guy came into the lab:

Me:  Sorry.  The lab's closed.
Dicksmack:  I've still got two minutes, right?
Me:  No.
Dicksmack:  One minute?
Me:  No.
Dicksmack:  How long then?
Me:  Um... negative two minutes.

I mean, hello, idiot.  The lab closes <b>at 4:00!</b>  Not later.  And there sure as hell isn't anything special about you such that the sign means ""The lab will be closing at 4:00 for everybody except Captain Dingleberry, who can work for as long as he wants.""

God, I hate people so much.  Contrary to what your parents may have told you when you were young, you are not special.  Rules apply to you the same as they apply to everyone else.  You can't just follow the rules as long as it's convenient for you and then fucking ignore them when they become inconvenient.

Cause, believe me, if life worked out that way, I would have smacked so many people upside the head by now.  It's sure as hell a lot easier than dealing with the brain aneurysms I get from having to deal with the brainless douche bags who pass for intelligent people nowadays."

"event","Hey, folks.

Sorry for the lack of updates lately but, being a student, this is obviously a very busy time of year for me.  In addition to my two exams next week, I still have work and I'm still trying to find a place to work next year.  Basically, don't be expecting updates for about another week.

As for what you can expect then?

*  Jackass of the week might go on hiatus.  Without the Gazette pointing out the idiocy of students, I might actually have to *GASP* do research to find a stupid person.  I don't know if I'm really prepared to do that.

*  Reviews are forthcoming for both Penn & Teller:  Bullshit! Season 1 & Best of Insomniac Volumes 1 & 2.  Yes, Futurama Season 3 is also forthcoming.  I plan to try a new rating system (which was originally going to be used for my rating system) where each episode gets a rating.  I'll probably try it on something smaller like Insomniac before taking on the daunting task of a 20+ episode season of Futurama.

Anyway, thanks for hanging in there with me, guys.  Most of the feedback I've gotten on this site is positive.  I always wanted to give people a laugh, and it seems like I'm doing just that.  If you do like the site, please pass around the link to your friends.  

Also, please feel free to leave comments.  It would be nice to start some discussion on here as well.  Yes, I do screen the comments, but not to the degree that you should worry about it.  Basically, you're allowed to disagree with me, you're even allowed to insult me (to a degree), as long as you have some basis.

Other than that, I just hope to be back soon, posting on a much more regular basis.

Later."

"event","Well, folks, this week was a real squeaker.  The Jackass of the Week award was originally going to go to this little crybaby:

<a href=""http://www.gazette.uwo.ca/2004/April/06/news1.asp"">The Gazette - Student upset over police investigation</a>

""Oh, boo hoo.  I'm so embarrassed because the police thought I might have committed a crime.  If I had the money, I'd sue the university.""

For what?  For the police doing their job?  Stuff a fucking sock in it, bitch.  This isn't the United States of Litigation where you can sue cause someone harshes your mellow.

You were the <i>suspect</i> in a case of theft.  The police questioned you.  Get over it.  I wouldn't care if I got pulled out of class every time a theft occurred.  Mainly because I got pulled out of class, but also because the police would actually be trying to <b>find the fucking criminals.</b>

God, I hope you don't throw this kind of hissy fit every time the clerks at HMV don't rub your CD against the demagnetizer enough and you set off the alarm.  Oh, but that's different, I suppose.  Cause they're only suspecting you of theft.... kind of like the cops.  Oh, I guess it must be cause they aren't drawing attention to you in front of your class... just the mall.  Gee, I really don't see any difference.

Anyway, the award for this week goes to these students in the Faculty of Medicine:

<a href=""http://www.gazette.uwo.ca/2004/April/07/news1.asp"">The Gazette - Historic donation dissed</a>

Gee, that's really fucking terrible.  In exchange for <b>26 million dollars</b>, there's gonna be some guy's name in front of the faculty's name.  Boo friggidy hoo.  

You know what?  If the med students have that much of a problem with it, they can just give all the money over to the Faculty of Law.  And you can call it the John W. Jackoff-Slurp-My-Balls Faculty of Law for all I care, cause I'm probably going at a significantly cheaper rate.

And to all the people who think it'll cheapen their degree:  Get your heads out of your asses.  Employers (the same employers who always hired from Western, mind you) will know that your degree comes from the same faculty that it always did at Western, just with a different name.  It won't make any difference at all.

Further proof that, in our society today, no good deed goes unpunished."

"event","my dad is so mean to me. earlier before docent traning i was going tanning and he asked if i could go get burger king for everyone. well i didnt have enough time and my mom just walked in the door and before i could even say anything she said ""no she has docent training"". i just planned on finding something around the house anyway to eat. i didnt expect them to make dinner before 5pm just for me. but then my dad said, ""well i guess i can go get it then"". and then he started complaining about it. and then my moms like ""well you have to eat before you go"" and i said fuck the grammar..lol..and i said i thought he just said hes going to get he burger king and then he started having a fit saying why does he have to live his life around everyone elses (me) and all of this bullshit. and he kept on saying o theres those frozen pizzas in the garage, i told her theres those frozen pizzas in the garage, why cant she just eat that. and i said its fine ill just eat something here. and hes like noo ill go and get it. and i said no i said its fine. and hes like no i can tell in your voice its not. well i didnt have time to fight with him so i just walked away to get ready. then it was about 4 30 and i came out of the bathroom and he still hadnt left for dinner. and my mom said youre never gonna make it back in time. and hes like fineee ill live my life around everyone elses this is bullshit bla bla bla and then he was leaving and i said yeah im just gonna eat something here anyways because i have to leave at 5 and youre never gonna be back before that. but it just really pissed me off and hurt my feelings. i didnt care if he wasnt going. but he told me at 4o clock that he was and then at 4 30 he still hadnt left and that pizza takes 20 minutes to make so it was too late. so i ate some spaghetti i found. then i just got home and he starts bitching at me again for no reason. and i dont even fucking live here. thats why i wanted to move out so badly and now hes doing it again that im here. if daven wasnt sleeping i would have left right then. 

anyways better news is docent training was great. i met some nice people. and my mentor is soooo nice. we were talking before the class started and then when they had to pick names she picked me as one of her students. hehe. then we had to stand up and introduce ourselves. which usually doesnt bother me. infact i wasnt nervous at all and was excited for it to be my turn. but then when i stood up and was talking i got really nervous and shaky. i hope they couldnt tell. lol. and there is this really wierd lady. she came in a bit late. and then she was just really jittery and quiet. and then after she introduced herself for about 10 minutes she sat back down. and then after that everytime the teacher said something she would crack up really loud. idk about her. lol. and then there is 2 other people around my age. one girl who goes to wayne state and one guy that goes there too. and then theres this other girl who used to work at mote marine laboratory in florida which is one of the places i would realllllly like to work. i think im gonna talk to her about how it was there. but when that boy introduced himself to the class he told the sweetest story that i almost cryed. he said his best experience at the zoo was that a couple of years ago his grandpa had died and after his grandpa died they always associted butterflies with his grandpa and kinda thought that maybe that was his grandpa coming to visit them in their yard. and then they took his grandma to the zoo and they went in the butterfly exhibit and a bunch of butterflies kept on landing on him and he thought that it might be his grandpa. 

after class i drove home in the pitch dark and i cant see without my classes. it sucked. and im not used to express way driving yet eathier. but i know ill get used to it. last year it was like that too. and then i just got used to liking it. 

pat still hasnt called me. he said that he might get done today and come home. i really miss him. i just want to know if hes still at work or on his way home. and christines at jimmys so im all alone here. which is ok. but i hope my asshole dad goes to bed soon so i can get offline and go downstairs and watch tv.

i have another docent training class on saturday and we are gonna take a tour around the zoo. im really excited because its supposed to be really nice on saturday.

bye."

"event","hi livejournal. i have missed you. i wanted to really write and since not many people read this as they used to, and everyones into your business on myspace...i decided to come home to you. lets see, where to start. o i start docent traning tommorow. im nervous and excited my my nerves are overtaking the happiness. idky. but it is. i hope i like it. eathier way i have to stick it out. if i ever want to become a zookeeper it is what i have to do. some people have college, i have this. pat is still in canada for work. he said that hopefully he will be done tommorow and come home. i miss him but i was really looking forward to this week to stay at my moms house. its wierd because it used to be just an every day thing of living here, and now i come to visit and its kinda like a little vacation. dont get me wrong, i absolutely looooove love love living with pat in our own place. i love our apartment. i love decorating it, keeping it clean, being on our own, cooking dinner, grocery shopping. its all great. but im homesick too at times. whenever i come over here now it is just so much fun. for one we dont have cable...just basic channels. so thats a luxery. also internet. plus now i know why people say that they are gonna go home and let momma fatten then up. when i lived here i used to think that we never had anything to eat in the house. but now i see that actually there is tons of shit here. at our house we basically buy for dinner and lunches. and here this is just shit everywhere. lol. i love coming over and just visiting with my sister and my mom. i love when my dad gets home and i get to talk to him. then he goes to bed and me and christine stay up late watching tv and weve been watching planet earth. gosh i love that show. its so amazing. im thinking about maybe taking some earth science classes at macomb. anyways, i was looking forward to having that couple of days here. and now its over with. because tommorow christine will be here during the day but then shes going to jimmys. i have docent training and then the next day pat should be home so i go home then. it makes me sad. but ill be happy to see him too. i hate when he goes away. when i dont talk to him im fine, but when he calls thats when it hurts the most. ive been so emotional lately, and no its not because im pregnant again. ive had that scare too many times lol but luckily thats all it was... a scare. i cry at everything. happy and sad. tonight we watched american idol and it was the one where all of the profits go to charities. i balled my eyes out. i tryed my best not to. but those poor little babies in africa. and when they started to cry i just lost it. its sad about us not having food here in america. but in africa, its like there is no hope. thats why they did the money drive and now hopefully they will be doing better. i wish i had money to give. they said even $10 will help a bunch. when i get a job im going to start donating here and there as much as i can. i always put my extra change in the charity boxes at the stores. but i want to do more. well christine finally got out of the bathroom so we are going to go and eat pizza rolls. bye livejournal."

"event","things have been good lately. i went back to work last monday. and i had to work with the lady i dont like. but i made it through the day. then on thursday i worked with the lady i dont like, melissa, and jen. i originally was going to work from 12 to 4 but i ended up staying till 6. i ate chinese for lunch and afterwards i just felt like i was going to die. so the last 2 hours of work sucked. then last night was new line. we were there until 1:45 am. i felt very accomplished afterwards though. i guess daven had a tummy ache last night and was crying a lot for pat. when i got home at 2 30 am they were both sleeping. that sucked because i missed pat all day. but i got to see him today :) daven got up at 4:30 and went back to sleep by 5:30. then i went to bed. he got back up at 8:30 so that there gives me 3 hours of sleep. he went to sleep by 9:45 and was back up at 10:30. then he stayed up untill about 12:30 and was back up at 1:45pm. so i got maybe 7 hours of sleep and they were very much broken up. idk something like that, you do the math. so needless to say when pat got home at 3 we were both exhausted. finally daven fell asleep so we all took a much needed nap. 

my face has started breaking out a lot on my chin. at first it was from stress, but i think that now it was because i rubbed tanning lotion all over my face. not doing that again. but anyways christine ordered proactive and it got here today so i used a little bit of it. i want to order some for me. its $45 for every 2 months. but idk if we can afford it yet or not. chloe is going to cost us $50 a month to live in the apartment. unless we sneak him in. but i would rather have chloe than proactive. 

i found my very first boyfriend on myspace last night. james grissom. we went out when i was in 7th grade and he was in 5th. we went out for about 2 months and the most we did was held hands and we had to play red rover to do that. lol. and im not sure if we ever hugged. we were dared to but idk remember if we did. lol. and then i broke up with him, well he came over to see me and i had christine and renee do it for me. and then he didnt believe them to i went to the door and laughed and said yeah. how mean is that. and then like a couple years later i saw him and apologized for being a bitch about it. anyways. i think thats funny. i also found 2 girls that i used to play with when i was really little on myspace. jessica and brittany quinn. they are so grown up looking now. i mean we were friends when i was like 10 and they were maybe 8 and 6. wieeeeeeeeerd.

we move out in 2 weeks. yay us!! im pretty excited. i just hope we can afford everything. pats b irthday is in about 3 1/2 weeks. im getting his birthday present probably not next week but the week after that. for his birthday i want to take him to see jackass 2 and i havnt decided if im going to make him dinner yet or take him out to outback. probably take him out. cuz im not the best cook. lol. but no one tell him these plans! they are top secret. im going to blind fold him that day :) but he never reads this anyway. so he wont know.

hmm what else. o dave is a month old today. that month has gone by quick. i cant wait until he starts reacting to things, and smiling a lot and laughing. 

renee got a job at hooters. shes so lucky. when i get skinny im going to try to get one there too. but ofcourse im still going to school to become a zookeeper. it will just be good money for the time being. gymboree is great and all but it just doesnt  pay enough.

anywho im gonna go. bye."

"event","today was fun. well not at first. daven wouldnt go back to bed. first he ate his bottle for an hour. then he was still hungry. so my mom said go back to bed and ill feed him. so i went back to bed and not even 5 minutes later she brought him in to his cradle because he fell asleep. well not even 5 minutes after that he was awake again. crying. so i changed him and then fed him a bit more and then he went back to sleep. well i lay him in his cradle and he doesnt want to sleep. ahh. so then i rocked the cradle and sang to him. well then chloe came in so i was petting him and like 15 minutes later chloe left so i laid down and daven woke up. so i got him up and his belly button finally fell off. so i changed him and then my mom took him for me. so i finally got in a nap. then when i got up i ate and started washing davens clothes and washing his bottles. then pat got home and me and him got ready and then we went to the dream cruise. it was a lot of fun. a lot of people liked pats car and asked him to smoke his tires and then they cheered. well davens waking up so i have to go and get him. o yeah these people had signs and they said stuff like ""get insurance"" ""needs work"" ""light em up"" and they gave pat the ""light em up"" sign and then they cheered. then on the way home there was this car infronte of us that was purple and had ""grape1"" on the license plate and it literally smelt like grapes. it was wierd. lol. i put more pics of daven up on my myspace. if anyone wants to see. its myspace.com/jesz8604. kk bye."

"event","yup i had the baby. this is how it went. tuesday i went to my drs appointment and she checked me and said that i was dialted to 4. well i didnt expect anything of it. so i went home. when pat got home i told him and we just layed around and then went to vgs and made din din and then did a little somethin somethin :) well after that i was having pains. but i usually have been after that so i thought it was no big deal. when my mom got home i was still having the pains so i said alright lets go up to the hospital just incase. pat was a bit upset with me because he thought that i was just excited because i was dialated to 4 and that the pains were from the other thing. so i said well stay here and if its anything we will call you. but we both really didnt think it was. i just wanted to be safe.

so we got to mt clemens general around 1am. they wheel chaired me up to the room. they hooked me up to this machine to see if i was indeed having contractions and sure enough i was. so they checked me and i was dialated to a 5 and they said that they were going to keep me. so we called pat up there. when he got there he walked in the door with a huge smile on his face. well we all just layed around and they had me hooked up to an iv and i had to go pee like every 10 minutes. then we fell asleep. the contractions seemed to go away. we woke up and they said that all of that time i was still having contractions. but i didnt feel them.  so we thought hey maybe we are gonna get to go home. well after that they came in and checked me and i was a 6. so they said that dr jones wanted me to stay and that they were going to break my water. i started balling my eyes out. they did that. and then we decided to get an epideral because they were going to hook me up to this liquid that was going to give me more contractions. so they put that in. it didnt really hurt. just felt like something rubbing on your backbone. an icky feeling. i cryed all throughout that too. lol. then they gave me the stuff and i still didnt feel any contractions. so i was on epideral and started getting very numb. every now and then i would feel the pain but i just pressed a button and got more drugs.

they came in and checked me said that i was a 7-8. so i was getting a bit nervous. then the nurse said if i felt like i had to go poop and pressure then i should tell them. well i did. and sure enough i was a 9. then they checked me a bit later and i was a 10. so they thought. so they had me start pushing just to practice and i was doing pretty good. then they checked me again and noticed that i was still a 9, not a 10. so they said that they would come back in a few hours and see if i was a 10. well i wasnt so they decided to give me a c section. they prepped me and then me and my mom went in the room. my mom was so great. her pat and christine were there for me the entire time. i dont know what i would have done without them. especially my mom. well anyways they started doing the c section and it didnt hurt. then i heard him crying and me and my mom both started balling. he sounded like a duck. lol. 

then they started sewing me back up and that hurt like hell. it felt like a bad tummy ache. and my chest was hurting too. finally they took us back to our room. and gave me some drugs and i felt better. i had to stay for a couple of days but we all came home on saturday. daven is such a good amd cute baby. he is 6lb 11oz and has light brown hair and blue eyes. i love him sooo much. 

well my dads babysitting for me right now. everyone has been such a big help. but i feel bad having them watch my kid for me. but they dont care, they want to. but anyways so id like to hurry up so i can get back to daven. kk byebye."

"event","i am so cold right now that im literally shaking :) im upstairs with the window open and the fan blowing directly on me. its the best feeling ever. the heats really been getting to me...BAD.

i havnt updated in a few days and a lot of good stuff has happened so heres how it goes. tuesday i didnt go into work because i was up all night feeling yucky. im lying in bed and at about 8 30am pat comes up stairs. i guess he had a tummy ache so he came home early. it made me really happy :) so we cuddled and went back to bed. later on when everyone left and i felt better we went for a little ride. of course pat had to surprise me again. he never tells me where we are going. we just go. and sometimes he actually takes different routes just to confuse me and surprise me. its really cute hehe. anyways we pulled into northport apartments off of hall road right before garfield. i guess its where billy and his gf live. so pat wanted to know if i wanted to look at them. 

we went in and the lobby/clubhouse is beautiful. it had a cathedral ceiling and then big glass doors leading out to this huge beautiful swimming pool. we asked the lady if she had any 2 bedroom apartments available. she said the next 2 bedroom apartment she has will only be available september 14th. so i told her our situation and how we want to be out before the babys born and she referred us to the harbors across the street. i guess they are sister apartments. so we went over there and the woman there was soo snobby. and they looked kinda ran down. so we decided to go back to northport. we told her that we were interested in the apartment and she gave us an application. so we came back in on wed with the $30 and the app. and today we got approved! :) it sucks that we have to stay here until the 14th with the baby and all but it will be worth it in the end. 

our apartment has 2 bedrooms, cathedral ceilings, a balcony, a washer and a dryer in the apartment, and gas heat and water are included in the rent. which the rent was $775 for this apartment but we got a special deal and its only $725 a month. its so beautiful. i cannot wait to move in!

yesterday i had to work. it went by pretty fast. when i got home i felt sick from the heat so i took a nap and then pat got home. so we just sat outside and then made dinner at like 10pm. i always do that. i need to start making it earlier. then today i had to work from 3 to close. but bj called me and said that that was a really long shift for me so if i just wanted to come in at 6 that would be alright. well i was already by the mall so i didnt want to have to drive all the way back home. so i went to my credit union by walmart. pat called me and he was on his way to put the downpayment on the apartment so i went with him. then he dropped me back off at the credit untion and i drove over to walmart. i ate there and shopped around for a couple of hours. it was air conditioned so it was nice :) i went in for sheets but couldnt find any really. so i was gonna get all of this other stuff. but then right before i left i found these blue pretty sheets. so i got those.

then i worked from 6 to close which wasnt that bad. when i got home i just talked with pat and showed him the sheets. we really need them. we just had a blanket we were using as a sheet, and it was so uncomfy and made us hot. so now we have nice cool sheets :) i cant wait to get our comforter set. but right now im saving my money so i cant get it yet.

tommorow i work from noon to 6pm and then its jaimies grad party. then sunday i have to work again. im getting a lotta hours this next week. which is good because i really need the money.

well im gonna try to go to sleep. byeee.-"

"event","this sucks. im really bored and not tired. but i want to take a nap before work because i got up early and got to bed late last night and i dont want to be tired when i get there. hopefully itll go by fast. i just have tommorow and then saturday. then next weekend i have to work the shitty hours on friday, but only till 6pm on saturday. yay. i really wish i didnt have to go to work tonight. i could clean a little bit. go to the dollar store like i wanted to. and then pat would be home soon. it sucks. o well. at least ill be in air conditioning.

on sunday we called on that house and i guess its $800 a month. thats a little bit too much for us. so instead of paying pat back i got him a pair of shoes at the mall. then we ate at bk and came home and just sat outside. monday i had to go to work from 6pm till 1am. we put up the new line of clothes. it was pretty fun though. until like the last half hour. we were all exhausted then. the past week i really havnt done much but clean and such things like that. yesterday i worked from 1pm till 7pm. it was the first day of gymbucks. which is a huge sale. so it was extrememly busy. it went by pretty fast. we had to wear black and white. i have to do that today too. 

today i had my doctors appointment. the baby is 5lb right now. me and pat really need to move out soon because daven really could come at anytime now. hes due the 26th and thats only a month away. but pat just got 2 weeks vacation pay so now we are over $2100!! but the bills have to go through this week. so hopefully next week we can go and look for an apartment. this girl at work is having a moving sale and is selling a lot of furniture. so we are going to go to that. 

well im gonna go go. bye."

"event","today when pat got home we went to gibralters. he got a sticker for his window for his mistubishi club thingy. it looks really nice. we walked around there for a bit. we looked at the swords. another birthday present idea :) after that we went to kohls. we looked for a comforter set but i found a blue one i liked and they didnt have it in a queen. there was another blue one too but it was too exspensive. then there was this red suede one that i really liked but they didnt have it in blue. so we went by the baby clothes. i got daven 6 pairs of pjs. plus the ones other people got him. he should be set on those for now. then i got him this pack of 6 bibs. it was only $7.20 so thats a good price. and at kohls but the counter they are always selling stuffed animals usually $5 a stuffed animal and all of the money goes to charity. well they had tigers, zebras, and giraffes. which is what davens room is going to be in. so i got all 3 of them.  o yeah and my bank wasnt open so i had to borrow this money from pat. i say borrow because i really dont want him paying for any of this baby stuff. im paying for all of it out of my paycheck that way his money can go towards our place. so i want to give him the money back so he can put it back in the bank. 

after that we went to arbys and got a thing of curly fries and a shake to split. we got his car washed and then came home. we ate toasted tomato sandwhiches outside. they were soo yummy. then pat decides to start a war. first he throws all of this ice down my shirt. so when i stand up it goes down my shirt, down my skirt, and looks like im pooping it out. lol. then he decides to take the glass of water and pour it all over me. so he started some shit. so i tryed getting him for a while, but didnt succeed. then i finally have the water squirt bottle to get him with but it was getting darker outside so i didnt want to be mean. but then he takes it and gets me SOAKED. i was so pissed. lol. so when he was coming up the stairs into our room i saw a glass of water sitting on the desk and i threw it on him. it was awesome. he was soaked. he tickled me for that one. but i got him good :)

there is a house for rent by jessica and dougies so tommorow we are going to look at that. i hope we like it. im excited. i cant wait to move out.

"event","we went and got my ultrasound done yesterday. everything looks good. i have to wait to find out the weight of the baby from the doctor. after that we were gonna go swimming with renee but it was too late. so i just came home and sat outside with mom and pat. then me and pat ate dinner and watched this movie field of dreams. it was really good. now im about to go to work. 2 to 6. im glad though because its so fucking hot and i want to be in the air conditioning. it sucks though because christine spent the night at renees last night and then they are probably going swimming today. that sounds really fun. but o well. at least i dont have to work the late shift. and i gont have to work tommorow yay. well im on call. but i would be pissed if i had to go in. since ive been working there theyve had me work every friday and saturday and it has all been the closing shift. the only saturday i got off was for my baby shower. and i had to ask for it off because they were gonna have my work the late shift. this pisses me off because there are 11 other people working there. so why is it EVERY friday and saturday im working the late shift. but atleast i dont have to this weekend. then i have to next weekend. and then the weekend after that i have to on friday but i work from 2 to 6 on saturday. 

i applyed for another job yesterday. its a cell phone store out in fairhaven. it was advertised in the bay voice. it would be 10am to 6pm monday and friday and then 10am to 3pm on saturday. which is not bad at all. its guaranteed 22 hours a week which is way more than i get at gymboree. i would be answering phones, selling accessories, and running the cash register. the only thing that sucks it is pays $6.50 which is lower than i get paid at gymboree. but id still be getting paid more because its more hours. but IF i got the job i would try to stay at gymboree too. but im not sure if theyd keep me because i wouldnt beable to work fridays or saturdays and it seems as if thats all i ever work so maybe the rest of the week is booked up and they wouldnt have room in the schedule for me. but sometimes i do work monday through thursday. so we will see. that would be awesome to have both jobs. it would equal a full time job. plus the cell phone store job is set on specific days. so i wouldnt have to get my schedule from each store and be like o i can work this day because im scheduled at my other store. so we will see what happens.

im gonna eat and get going.


welpers all of that ^ was from earlier. i typed it all out and then the power went out. gay huh. atleast lj now has that restore thing. i came back here and it said ""restore"" and i typed yes and it came back.

i got paid today. $160. so thats really good. but thats for 2 weeks which sucks. im going to put eathier $50 or $60 into my savings for pats bday present and then the rest has to go on baby stuff. i need to get the diaper genie, more pjs, the sterlizer, maybe a drying rack, and the thermometer. im getting the thermometer from meijer though because i have a $20 gift card for there. then we should be all set on the baby stuff. so the rest of the paychecks can go into savings. unless i dont have enough this time for all of that stuff or maybe i will need more pjs. o0o yeah i also need more little booties, and everytime i got shopping im going to pick up a couple of bibs. after the baby stuff is bought i also need to save for more furniture for our apartment. plus i want to get the decorations for davens room. but those i can even get after hes born because he wont be sleeping in there for a couple of months anyways. 

im getting excited but nervous too. im so scared to go into labor and push him out. but one of my friends just had a baby and she said it wasnt too bad. i cannot wait to be not pregnant anymore. and start losing weight and tanning again! omg today i only worked 4 hours and i felt so exhausted and sick to my stomach. i cannot wait to beable to work without feeling sick or drained so quickly. i just hope that if i get more hours after i have him that i will be up to working them. because im so used to working so little hours right now. but i used to work like 8 hour days at toys r us and i was fine. i mean i was tired but not as bad as now.

this is a list of things that i want to get. not that i need. but want to get.

couches for our living room (eventually a nice set, but for now it can be cheap)
slip covers for the couches (i know yucky, but its good enough for now)
end tables for the living room
decorations for the living room and bedroom
new sheets and pillow cases
new comforter
paint for the living room and bed room

then theres the stuff for davens room

the crib bedding set
the crib mattress
the mobile
the rug
the wall hangings
maybe the lamp
a dresser maybe
maybe a toy box


so yup im gonna go and price check stuff online. i think that maybe me and pat will go shopping this weekend for this stuff. i know that tommorow we are going to gibralters. so maybe after that. kk bye."

"event","im so frusturated and anxious. have you ever felt just like screaming or saying grrrrrrrrrrrr because everything is just getting on your nerves. maybe im tired. idk. but everytime i crawl into bed i cant fall asleep. i got so many things rushing through my mind. like shopping for the rest of the baby stuff. and getting our apartment. and decorating it. and getting the couches and slip covers. and all of that shit. i mean its not all stressful stuff. im excited about it. but i just cant sleep because im too anxious. its kinda like the night before the first day of school. except this is like this every night for me. today was just a pain in the ass. i was cranky all day. i only got up at 12pm. i got my room cleaned and all but it was a hassle. idk how im gonna go back to work. it sucks because i really dont feel up to working anymore. but i need the money. 4 hours was getting to me. now next week she has me on for a lot of more hours. idk how im going to handle it. at least it will be air conditioning. im so tired of being so hot all of the time.  i hate it because i have so many complaints and when im around other people im just in a bad mood and i dont want to talk because if i do then im just complaining. my body is so uncomfy. i feel so big and bulky. like my tummy its always really hard and he will be pushing out one side or the other. its hard to move around or bend down and stuff because thats when he moves around. 

on better news the other day me my mom and christine went shopping and they put all of this stuff in layaway for the baby. it really helped out a lot. i only need to get a few more things now. me and pat need to go shopping for that. 

im gonna go and maybe try to get some sleep. bye."

"event","happy 4th of july! not really doing anything much this year. cant get drunk. get go swimming in a lake. have no cabin to go to. it sucks :( but the weekend was pretty fun. friday sucked because i had to work. saturday was good because pat got off early and we got to hang out before i had to work. sunday we were outside all day just doin shit and then christines friend from highschool kenny came over and we hung out with him for a bit and mom bbqed.

today i had to work 10am to 2pm. it was pretty busy. sometimes it makes me sad that im not as close with the girls yet as they are with eachother. but i know that its just because theyve all been working together if not years then at least like 8 months. yup im the newby. but they are all really nice to me and most of the time we have fun together. so thats good. 

this weekend we are have a sale for employees. %30 off of sale items and %50 off of non sale items. so im definately going to buy daven some stuff. i guess my mom said we should get him more blankets. so im going to get him 2 more that are there right now. actually i can get him 3 maybe because it will be 50% off the full price one which is $19.95 so that means itll only be like $10. one has tigers. one has cute whales. and the other one has dinosaurs. i also need to get him some more clothes 0-3 months. so we are going shopping at walmart on wed. me and pat went out to a different walmart today. it was really nice. and it had more sales than the one by us. so thats the walmart i want to go shopping at for davens clothes. i also need to get him the baby monitor and diaper genie. those are the next 2 things on my list. im not sure yet if we are going to get the crib set or the swing and something else. i think i want to use the money from everyone for the crib set. even though we wont need it right away, i want to get it so we dont never get it. but idk because we could get the changing table and the swing. idkkkkkk. 

but anyways i also need to be saving money because pats birthday is september 26th. i want to get him something nice. i know that the new nintendo system is coming out around then. maybe i can get him that. but i also need to be saving for his christmas present which i want to be the ps3. but its $600! so yeah i need to get daven stuff, save for pats birthday present, AND for his christmas present. my moneys going for daven, and pats money is going for our apartment. pat wont tell me how much we have saved up but i know its more than $400 so i guess thats good. all we need for our apartment is the microwave, vacumm cleaner, and some stuff for the living room. but we are basically all set.

we spent money for the first time in forever today. i got a new wallet at walmart because mine was literally falling apart. and pat got some gummy bears and some new tires for his rc car from radio shack. he got the car about 2 years ago and i got him the hummer for christmas.

well i guess im gonna go. idk what im gonna do. i should be tired but its so muggy and sticky that i cant get comfy. and then i cant cuddle with pat because its so freakin hot and then hell roll over by me and cuddle and i want to and then i feel bad but i have to keep pushing him off of me because its so hot and sticky. 

happy 4th of july everyone! :)"

"event","welp i just did something that i have been thinking about but really didnt want to do. ive dropped out of my docent training classes. its just too much for me being pregnant. the classes are twice a week and i have to drive ALL the way out to royal oak. thats not really the bad part. but we have to sit in class for almost 3 hours straight and the whole time im just uncomfy and figity, waiting for it to end. then we need to go on these mock tours and walk around the zoo and ive done 2 of them and both i was just miserable. the 2nd one was a bit better because the tour lead was much more informative and fun and the heat wasnt beating down on us, but i still got soo tired. then today im rushing to get ready, not wanting to go to class, and then i think, hey this should be fun. i shouldnt be dreading going there. so i really thought about it. when i first started the classes it was fun. but at the same time i was only 5 1/2 months pregnant. being 7 months now its just way too much. not the studying or anything, but the sitting for long periods of time and the walking. plus with work, it just tires me out. so i called and told them i wont be coming anymore. i really do still want to do this though, so the next classes are in october. i dont think ill be ready then because daven will only be 2 months old. but there are also classes next spring that i think im going to take. i just hate it though because i was so close. there were only a few more classes to go. but then i thought, after the classes im still going to have to be there for 3 hours a week and with being a new mom and working and keeping up the house and everything i dont know if i would even beable to do that. ugh i hate quitting things. but anyways yup im just gonna keep studying to become a zookeeper and if we are still in michigan next year im going to try to become a docent again. kk i just needed to vent. bye."

cradle swing
gymni (you lay the baby under it)
bottle warmer
diaper genie
ear thermometer
stroller

and then here are a few things that i want to get but arnt necessities

mobile
rug
the wall hangings
the folding hamper
and then the crib set and mattress...which we need to get soon...but since he is going to be sleeping in the cradle for a while first, we dont NEED that stuff yet.

we got a cute changing table too. but i really want the one that we picked out to match the crib set. and its only $100. so my mom is going to keep the other one here, and i want to get the other one from the store.

today me and pat just looked at all of the stuff again and i started putting things away. i cant wait to move out and put it all up. then ill be excited about him coming. but im not excited right now because we are still living here and i dont want to be living here when he comes. its cramped enough, let alone with a baby. plus i want to raise him on my own. i mean help from mom is great, but i dont want to be here and her doing everything.

well im gonna go. its 11pm but i cant really sleep. maybe ill hang his clothes up. o0o yeah before the shower me and pat went up to my store and got him the whole turtle collection of clothes. its so cute :) kk bye."

"event","not much has been going on. i never got to audit that tour because come to find out there wasnt a tour that day anyways. i have just been working and thats about it. i got my first pay check the other day. it was only a 2 day pay check but it was for $50. thats better than i expected. i really need more hours, but at the same time i get so tired from just working 4 hours so idk if i could handle it. but i could always try :) well i spent that entire paycheck as soon as i got it. it was extremely hot out after work and pat was still working so i decided to go cash it and spend my time in air conditioning. so i went to kohls. and got daven, o yeah we picked out a name for our baby, it is Daven Aliah.  never dave, davey, or david though. i hate those names. anyways i got daven 6 outfits at kohls, me a shirt, and pat a shirt. that was my whole 50. 

sunday was fathers day. we went and got my dad a wheelbarrow. christine paid for it, so i have to pay her my half back after the next paycheck. then we went to walmart and pat got me 2 bras and a sprinkler and christine got some stuff. then we went home and gave my dad his present. 

i have all of this turtle stuff on hold at my store. there is a onesy, a body suit, a pair of shorts, a little t shirt, a hat, a pair of socks, a bib, and a really soft good blanket. yesterday i had my manager ring it all up for me with my employee discount to see how much its going to be. its going to be about $70. and for gymboree for all of that stuff that is NOT bad at all. so my next paycheck is going to be blown right away too. lol. cuz i cant keep that stuff on hold forever. so im going to buy that and then pay christine back the $30 i owe her. after that im going to start saving my paychecks. 

now we need to save for a dining room table. my aunt and uncle gave us this really ugly plain brown table with 4 chairs which are also dark brown and have like rose peddle cushions. its very ugly. and then they wanted us to pay $100 for it. well i told my mom from the beginning, then we are just not going to take it because i dont even like it. and shes like no just take it. well we gave them $20 and they are still complaining for the rest. so im just going to eathier have chrisitne buy it for herself or ask for our $20 back and give them the fucking table back. first of all i cant go into detail but both of these people are assholes and i have no room to respect them AT ALL. ESPECIALLY my uncle. so i really dont give a fuck about them. and then they are going to charge us for something they fucking gave us. because at the beginning they said that we didnt have to pay. only if we had it. and now they keep on pressuring us. well we can go to art van clearance center and get something a little bit more expensive but something really nice. im not going to pay for that fucking ugly table and i hate them anyways. UNLESS pat really is willing to pay for it, just to get the table out of the way so we dont have to buy a new one. but i asked him before and he said just give it back. so we will see.

im really excited for the baby shower. just to see everything that daven gets. im so busy this week. between work, school, studying, and cleaning house for the baby shower. i had my drs appointment today. and everythings fine i guess. i hate going there. its kinda a waste of time. but i guess its good to make sure. 

well im gonna take a little nap because i didnt sleep well last night at all and got up at 8 30 today. so im gonna do that and then start cleaning house. bye!"

"event","this weekend was pretty good. saturday i had class from 9am to 12pm. well that was crazy. i got no sleep the night before. i had to get gas in my car in the morning. the ramp on 23 to 94 was closed. so i had to go to the ramp on 21mile. i had to do 80 all the way to the zoo and i just made it on time. just so we could sit there for 3 hours talking about stuff. then we went for a tour of the vet hospital and of the kitchen. from there i had to go home and there was construction. it was so hot in my car and i felt like i was literally going to puke. finally i get home at 1 15. just enough time to change and rush to the mall. it took forever to find a parking spot. then i had to eat because i hadnt eaten since like 7am.  so i hurried up and ate and then rushed to work. which at first was really gay because it was busy but there was nothing for me to do because i wasnt trained on the cashregister. so i just jumped on and learned it pretty quick. the rest of the work day went by real fast. i got home around 7ish. me and pat went to meijer and got steaks and stuff for dinner and cooked out. then we ate and were both so exhausted that we went to sleep.

sunday we both slept in and then got up and just layed around for a bit. then pat went out to work on his car and i took a bath and filled out the addresses on the invitations. im almost done with that. they should be out in the mail by tommorow. which is crazy because the baby shower is june 24th, so its cutting it a bit close. then christine got ready and we all went out to eat at don pablos. it was alright. not as good as i expected. from there we went to walmart and got ALL of our kitchen stuff.  pots, pans, strainer, glasses, ect. the only thing we need to get is pepper and salt shakers and a microwave. and we are all set!! but that took a good chunk out of our savings. so we really need to just save up now for that down payment.  and i got the baby a onesy. its blue and striped with a little giraffe on it. me and christine both picked it out. and then i got him 2 bibs. one that says i love my mommy and one that says i love my daddy. then we came home home and me and pat played mario party and then just watched tv and we went to bed about 3am. craziness.

today i was ""on call"" for work. so i called and didnt have to go in. that was a relief. then i rescheduled my doctors appointment for next monday. the lady was such a bitch on the phone. all of the receptionists there are bitches. i went back to bed for a bit and then got up and watched the family stone. it was pretty good. and now im about to start cleaning. yay. and then studying too. and later on me and pat are making din din again and probably going to the store for blinds for my mom. we were supposed to get them yesterday but we forgot because we had so much shit ourselves to get. 

tommorow bright and early im going to audit a tour at the zoo to see what its all about. 
and thats about it.

"event","this week has basically been cleaning house. and shit like that. i need to get my insurance straightened around and they are giving me the run around and i need it by monday because that is when i have a doctors appoinment.  yesterday i had class at the zoo. it was fun. i need to study. we dont need to, but i want to. so im gonna do that in a bit. i was supposed to audit in the bird aviary today. which is where i would stand by a docent and watch them and see how they handle the public and everything. but last night, well actually every night since i dont even know how long, i cannot sleep. i wake up like 10 times a night. and i mean wake up where i actually get out of bed. its because of my allergies and my plugged up nose and when it gets stuffed up like that i get really claustrophobic. anyways this morning i still had every intention of going, but about 1/2hour before the alarm went off i just felt so sick to my stomach. and i know its because of lack of sleep. so i called and canceled. its not big deal. that person had to be there anyways. but i need to audit a stationary 3 times and 3 tours. i figured that id get that one out of the way, but i guess not. i thought it was only supposed to be in the lower 70s today. but it feels really hot. well im gonna go. i have to study for my regular thing and for the zoo. bye."

"event","this weekend my main goal was to keep busy, and i did just that. friday when pat got off work we drove down to the zoo and back so i could get a hang of it. and i finally did. then we came home and got pizza hut and then he left :( i just watched some tv and then tryed to go to bed but christine and mom got home so i went downstairs and talked to them for a bit. and then i tryed to go to bed again but i couldnt fall asleep. i think i got maybe 1 hour of it.

i got up and 6 45 on saturday and got ready and by 7 30 i was out the door. i was really nervous to drive to the zoo all by myself and i was just nervous for class period. but it was alright. there was construction near mound road which made us all go into one lane and go like 5 miles per hour which calmed me down because it gave me a chance to fix my seatbelt and just relax. i got to the zoo a half an hour later. at about 8 45 i went inside. and there were a bunch of the other docents in training. so i just talked to them. then we broke up into our groups with our mentors. i really like mine. shes an older lady and her name is eileen. the other 2 women in my group are in the late 30s and they are also really nice. i feel real comfortable around all of them. well then we walked around the zoo and looked at every single animal and eileen just told us what we could do if we were giving a tour or things like that. o and i heard a lion roar. i never heard that before in person. it was awesome. 

at about 10 30 am we all met up at the arl (artic ring of life) and the animal keeper there answered a bunch of our questions and we got to see the mommy and baby polar bears get fed. when that was done i thought that we were all going our seperate ways. well i was wrong. and i lost my group. so i caught up with another one and there was this retired teacher and shes about in her 50s and i was talking to her a lot. shes really nice. so really we were just talking and not listening to our mentor. im really glad that im in the group i am, because my mentor is really interesting...and this guy was kinda boring. and besides for that one lady...the group was too. 

at like quarter to 12 i ate lunch and then went to the tent set up by the otter house. there were 3 other ladies there from my docent group. they were volunteering for teddy bear day too. there were these little pieces of paper with teddy bears drew on them and the little kids would decorate the teddy bears by using buttons and things. i was making bows for them and helping them make tootoos for their teddy bears. at the end of that me and one of the girls went to the gift shop and i got a shirt and then when we came back they were cleaning up. so we helped clean up and then left. 

on the way home i was about to go onto 94 and the ramp was closed. so that sucked. so i got off the detroit ramp and got off at 10 mile road and went and visited renee and her boyfriend john for a minute. and she gave me mine and christine christmas presents. it was really nice to see her again. then i headed home. i took a little nap and then me and christine went to olive garden. it was sooo yummy. then we went to see an american haunting. that movie is so fucking scary. from the minute you start watching it, till the minute it ends. then we came home and i went to bed.

today pats coming home. yayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy. hes leaving there at about 3 pm which is in a half an hour so he should be home around 6ish 7ish.  so i guess im gonna clean a bit and take a bath. bye."

"event","my first day of work was wed. it was alright. i just priced stuff and helped people out. its pretty easy work. but the next time i work is not this saturday, but next saturday. i really need and want more hours. but hopefully i will end up getting more. i didnt go to school on wed. the heat was really getting to me. i planned on driving there, but it took me an HOUR to get home from the mall. so i wouldve been late anyways. i talked to my mentor though and she said its alright and hopes i feel better and my next class is saturday. we are going to be walking around the zoo. and then after that i volunteer for teddy bear day. christine told me that i should bring one of my teddy bears. lol. she thought it was the funniest thing that it was teddy bear day and cracked up about it for like an hour. lol. but that all is tommorow. today when pat gets off work we are going to practice driving there again. 

we got our hair cut yesterday. mines just a bit shorter and layered. im gonna grow it long now. it just needed a style. well im gonna go and watch the real world. bye.

o0o i think this is funny. me and pat saw this commercial for key west...not the real world...but just for a vacation spot...and in big letters at the top of the screen it said ""a great lesbian and gay community."" it was just funny how they put it out there. then on the jenny craig commercial with kristy ally. if you look at the bottom of the screen you will see something in little letters that says ""results not typical"". lol. 

o0o yeah my lj...the background pic dissapeared. which really pisses me off because i really liked it. so i need to find another one. but i dont have the time or energy right now. so bye."

"event","it is soooo hot. i cannot wait to go to work tommorow just for the fact that it will be air conditioned. i want to go swimming or something today but christine is at work and so is pebs and pat. yup. so im all alone. and i dont feel like really doing anything because its so fucking hot. i want to set up the little pool in the backyard. i want to do it today, but by the time pat gets home itll be late and i probably wont go in it today. and then tommorow im not going to be home all day. but something needs to be done. o yeah. we do have central air. but it broke yesterday.

my weekend was sooo wonderful. friday pat had to work on his car, so i went grocery shopping for my mom and then went over to dougie and jessicas where jaimie and christine were baby sitting the girls. a little bit later pat came over and brought some dinner over. and we watched the ringer. that movie is hilarious. then me and pat came home and went to sleep at like 1am.

saturday we got up and got ready and went up to my grandmas house. everyone was up there and they were having a bbq.  christine had to babysit the girls so i helped her a lot with grace. shes the younger of the 2. we ate and then we went for a paddle boat ride. i wish i was up there right now so i could just put my feet in the lake or something. when we got back we sang to my grandma and then me and pat came home and stayed up for a while and then went to bed.

sunday we got up and got ready and went to gibralters to get a sticker for pats car. after that we stopped at the game store and pat got mario party 7. then we stopped at dairy queen and went up to new baltimore beach to eat it. when we got home my mom had us go up to the store for her and then when we got back after a bit we ate dinner. we played a game of mario party. then we ate dinner. then we played another game of mario party. and then we went up to meijers at like 1am to get some pop and just walk around. then we came back home and played another game of mario party. we up till 3am doing that. it was a lot of fun.

monday i got up at like 9am and took a bath and then went back to bed with pat. then we got back up around 11 30 and went to the zoo. i drove the whole way there. i need to get practice in so i can drive myself. pat said that i did pretty good. we got there around 1pm and it was soo hot. but it was still great. we left there about 3pm and i drove home too. o yeah we got my car washed before that. then we came home and ate and went back up to gibralters. pat forgot to get a sticker for his brothers car that he asked him too. but gibralters was closed. so we just walked around the fair for a bit and then we headed home. we stopped at new baltimore beach first though. it was soo nice by the water. i should go up there right now, but i dont want to go by myself. then we came home and played a game of mario kart and ate again. we played that until about 1am. and then went to sleep. 

so yup that was my weekend. i loved being able to with pat allll weekend long. 

well now im just really hot and i have to clean my room so i might attempt that. bye."

"event","school was alright yesterday. it wasnt what i expected it to be. i think that ill like the actual part of being a docent, rather than the training. idk. i got there kinda late so i didnt get a good seat. maybe next week it will be better. it wasnt horrible though. it just wasnt what i expected. christine and mom got that job on afternoons which means from like 2pm until 5 30pm the house is all mine. which means i can study! im so happy for this. because i get so frustrated over it, and then with sound polution like the tv or ppl talking...i dont learn anything. so this is very good. o i found out yesterday that i dont have to work for memorial day weekend. my first day of work is the 31st. im not sure if i updated this yet or not. so im gonna anyways. and i wont be starting on the cashregister for like a month. but i wish that thats what i would be doing. id rather be doing that then just walking around the store bugging people. o well. i think i might get some more maternity clothes. because it feels like im wearing the same things over and over. but im gonna wait until i get paid. so i guess things are going good. i got a job. im going to school. i should be very happy but right now im just restless and i dont know why. i couldnt sleep all last night or this morning. and i am tired! it sucks. im gonna try to lay down in a couple minutes. christine has a horrible cold. i hope i dont get it. right now i kinda have the sniffles so i just took a sudafed. i have to clean my room today. yup. and then study. this saturday me and pat are probably going to drive to the zoo and home so i can practice. because i need to learn how to drive there myself. then hopefully we are going up to my grandmas house. i hope its fun. whenever i look forward to something it turns out not so great. im gonna try to go back to sleep. bye."

"event","sunday me and pat slept in, and then pat slept wayyy in. when we were all ready we went to babies r us to register. we got all of the basic things, but when we left we noticed a lot of things that would be good. well we are registered there and its all online and last night i was up until about 2am fixing it up. now i just need to have my mom come upstairs so she can help me pick out which diapers and bottles to register for. after we registered we went to see mission impossible 3. i felt really bad because 2 seconds into the movie i felt so sick. so i ran to the bathroom. but by the time i got there i felt better. that happened 2 more times. then finally i started feeling better. so pat got me a water and rubbed my back for me and then we finished watching the movie. i think it was because i ate 2 hot dogs there. i was starving and we didnt want to go out to eat, so i figured those would be cheap. wrong. $3.50 each! but we didnt have time to go to mc donalds or anything. so i got them, and then they made me sick. 

yesterday when pat got home we went got kfc and then watched the first half of the 3rd lord of the rings movie. all we have left is the second half. they are actually pretty good movies. verrry long though. today i have my doctors appointment at 3. i hope the stuff i have to drink to see if have diabetes or not isnt too gross. its supposed to be very sweet. but ive been getting nauseaus easily lately, so i hope it doesnt make me sick. i think ive just been getting an upset stomach because of nerves. good and bad nerves. i think that the woman from gymboree is supposed to call me back today. i hope that i dont have to work this weekend though because its memorial day weekend and its the first weekend that pats gonna have off in i dont even know how long. we might go up to my grandmas to celebrate. that should be fun. i wish it was hot enough to swim though. but i probably wouldnt beable to anyways because its a dirty lake and id probably get an infection. but she just got a paddle boat so we can go on that. yay i forgot about that. 

christine and my mom both got jobs today. its an afternoon shift job as injection welders. they are both gonna get paid $9.50 an hour. that fucking sucks. lol. im so jealous. i would hate afternoons though. but i want a full time job sooo bad. i need one. but even if i tryed i wouldnt get one, because they wont hire a pregnant person. but maybe after the baby comes i can try to get on day shift there. i just wish that maybe i could get paid a little bit more, or get more hours at gymboree...IF i get it. i guess i could always get more hours or get a raise. 

my first day of class at the zoo is tommorow from 6pm to 9pm. then i dont have class until next wed. and then i have it that saturday too. and that saturday pat is going to be in indiana for his cousins grad party. so if i dont have to work then after my class im going to volunteer at the zoo because its teddy bear day there. im kinda nervous for that. because i hope im good around the little kids and i hope that the other volunteers like me. well im gonna go. christine and mom went to get mc donalds about 20 minutes ago so they should be back soon. bye."

there are so many things coming up that are big to me right now. i have my interview tommorow. then next tuesday i have my 6 month check up at the doctors. i have to take a test there to see if i have diabetes and i have to drink this sick sweet shit. then wed i have my first day of school at the zoo. which im going to have pat have me drive and im nervous about that. in between all of this i might be working. i hope they dont have a problem with my doctors appointment or my school at the zoo. then june 3rd pat is leaving me for the weekend to go to his cousins graduation party. and i cant go because i might have work, and i have school. and im nervous about that because im an extremely jealous person and i dont like him going to a graduation party without other girls without me. even though i know hed NEVER do anything. its just the way i am. i HATE HATE HATE my jealousy more than anything. im also stressed because we are hopefully going to be moving somewhere in between all of this. pats going to leave me again in july to go visit his parents in alabama. i might go but im not sure yet. i might have to work. then the baby shower is in june. its so many big things coming up. and not even to mention we are going to be having a baby in august. lol. 

my parents fighting hasnt been helping eathier. idk if shes going to leave him or what. but i just wish the fighting would end. idc if they stay together or if he goes. i just need some quiet. i cant keep getting stressed out about them doing that shit. its not good for me or the baby. i cant wait to get out of here. id even know whats going on with the down payment money. pats the one with the job so he has the money. i know that we didnt spend any money last weekend. but the weekend before that most of his check went for the mattress. and before that it went towards stuff for the apartment. we need to finish getting the kitchen stuff. but i dont want to spend because i want to save for that downpayment. thats one of the biggest reasons i want this job. that way i can buy that stuff while he saves. plus when the baby comes we will NEED a second income. i need to get back into my studies too. never ever do homeschooling. it sucks. you need serious motivation. and i have it. its just there is no place quiet around here to study. and its really hard shit. medical terminology. by myself. just out of a book. without a teacher. i want to start back up but when i do i want to beable to have it all and keep going with it everyday. and right now thats not a possibility. but i need to get back into it. 

this sucks. its 8am and i dont want to go back to bed for the reason ive been in a really shitty mood and i dont want to have any wierd dreams about the shit that has been bothering me. i just want pat to get off work. hes like my rock right now and i really need him here. but i have to waiiiiiiiit. im so nervous for my interview tommorow. i think im going to get something to eat or something cuz im hungry. bye."

yesterday i pretty much spent all day in bed. i havnt been getting much sleep lately. it sucks. then finally i got up and did laundry. but for some reason i had to re wash the clothes 3 times because they still smelt like pats work clothes. so i got them done but i didnt even get to fold them because it was like 11pm when they were finished. i did dishes. and took a shower. and then helped with dinner. then me and pat went to walmart. for pop. but ofcourse we had to look at everything else too. lol. then we came home and watched ghost hunters, south park, and then it was beddy time. and i didnt get much sleep eathier last night. when pat left for work it was hard for me to fall back asleep. and when i did it was broken up. i think its just because im stressed now about not having a job. i dont know if i should call gymboree back agian. or just try someplace else. or just face it that im gonna be an unemployed mom and that we are going to have to live off of pats one paycheck. which would be fine for just me and him. but idk with a baby. and his fucking work...even though he is there just as much as the supervisors...they still havnt given him a raise. they didnt even fucking give him a raise for china. they piss me off so bad. but theres nothing he can really do about it. because if he fights it hill will lose his good relationship with them and or maybe even get fired. so fuck them. 

today we are going with my mom so she can pick out an outfit for saturday. i got my dress the other day. its blue with flowers and ties in the back. we will take pics. and it matches pats blue shirt that hes gonna wear. he looks sooo hot in this shirt. he got it to go to china in so he was looking nice when he rode first class. and incase he needed something nice to wear while he was there. damn does he look hot in it. but he looks hot all the time. but anyway so we are going to do that today. uh i could kill christine. she doesnt have a job right now, and although pat will give me money for whatever i need, we are trying reallly hard to save and only get the essentials. well christine had an extra gift card for the mall and i said good save that. she wanted to use it for my moms birthday present. and i said no save it for mothers day since neither of us really have any money right now. well she got my moms mothers day present and gave it to her that same day. so now we dont have anything to give my mom on sunday. it really pisses me off. so now IF my mom doesnt use the rest of the $17 from our jc penny card that we offered to her, i guess we can go there and get my mom something. but idk what to get her from there. we will find something. hopefully. and if all fails i guess i can ask pat for SOME money. but it wont be anything too nice. it sucks. i hate not having a job. 

im gonna go and eat and get ready for the day. byeeeeeeeee."

"event","bush is so fucking stupid. now why does he want to invade iran? power. hes a fucking asshole. the president or whatever of iran wrote bush a note, basically saying what would jesus do? how would he think of what you are doing? and bush basically responded by saying that that was tactics to change the subject because they do have nuclear weapons and hes probably going to invade no matter what. hes so fucking stupid. i hate him. hes TRYING to start wars. fucking bastard. come on 2008. i dont know who we are going to get in the white house next, but he sure as hell will be better than bush. i mean yeah clinton kinda fucked up by cheating on his wife, but the whole 8 years he was in presidency EVERYTHING was pretty much fine. as soon as bush steps up look at all the shit that goes down. idk if kerry would have been better or not, but i wish all of the southerners would have voted for him instead. they voted for bush. and look what he did for them during katrina. its sad. really.

today we went shopping with jessica and cathy. it was really fun. it was nice to just be with the girls again. the wedding is saturday. it sucks that everyone but me is going to be getting drunk. im really tired but i cant sleep. my parents woke me up at like 12 30 from fighting and i tryed to go back to bed but the baby decided that he wants to start kicking me and punching me. so i figured id get up and maybe eat something and maybe hell stop soon. i mean its cute during the day. but it sucks when im trying to sleep and hes doing it. or especially when i get all comfy cuddled up next to pat and im laying on my right side and then he hates that and starts kicking. its like hes saying. no youre not going to cuddle with my daddy. lol. 

k goodnight."

"event","yesterday pat got off work early and we went to get his windows tinted. well he had to make an appointment for today so that sucks because i really wanted to be the first to see them tinted but now certain assholes or i should say asshole at his work gets to see it before me. because his appointment was at 10am and then he had to go back to work right away. so i couldnt go with him to get it done today. 

anyways after the window tinting place we went allll over looking for mattresses. we didnt find any that was less than like $600. so we went to meijer and saw this temporpedic (sp?) mattress. its was only $250 and its huge and so comfy and you sink right into it! i love it. i got the best night sleep last night ever.

tonight is jessicas bachelorette party. i feel bad but i dont think im going to go because it only starts at 7pm and im exhausted by like 9ish. so yeah. it sucks. thats one thing about being pregnant. you get tired earlyyyy. i dont even remember the last time that i stayed up like 1. UNLESS it was just lying in bed. but actually up and socializing. nope.

now im about to clean our room, shower, and just wait for pat to get off work. hopefully we can go out today and maybe go out to eat or something. i dont want to waste the whole saturday just at home. too bad they couldnt start the party earlier. o well. bye."

"event","monday my moms side of the family came over. there were so many little girls running around it was crazy. they are all around the same age too like 2 years old. it was cute. when they all left we just visited a little bit more with moog and steve and abby and then they left. yesterday moog and steve came over to say goodbye. im really gonna miss them. i wish they lived closer. today i went to the stupid ass work first thing. the lady was such a bitch. so i decided fuck them. i dont need their cash assistance. if its gonna be a waste of my time. id have to go there 40 hours a week. for $300 a month. i dont think so. the woman i talked to, i asked her if i could be excused from the program because im almost 6 months pregnant and there arnt many places that will hire me. and shes like well where a big shirt and they wont know that your pregnant. so i said fuck that and left. well i didnt see that to her face. lol. but i left. so i came home and called this store at the mall that sells baby clothes and asked her if they are doing any hiring and shes said yes. then i asked her to be honest and asked if they would still hire me even though im 6 months pregnant and she said yeah. so thats great. so today me and pat have to go and pick up my necklace and then im gonna apply there. i have to wash my face. itll be the 3rd time today that i redid my makeup. i really want to go through the boxes in the garage to see what kitchen stuff we have and what kitchen stuff we need. but my mom keeps on procrastinating. and theres 2 mattresses from my sisters old bed on top of all of it so i cant get to it. speaking of mattresses we are getting our new one this weekend! yay. i have to take christine tanning now. i wish i could go :( byeee."

"event","im finally feeling better. i guess it was just a cold because its going away now. thanks to sudafed! its the ONLY thing im allowed to take. yesterday we didnt get the mattress which sucks but its because we didnt have enough money this weekend. we did have enough for a real cheap one, but we want a better one. so we will probably get it next weekend. we did go to walmart though and got the rest of our bathroom stuff. its seashells. a seashell garbage can, shower curtain, and tooth brush holder. omg brain fart. does tooth have an e on the end? lol. i honestly cant remember. we also got this final fantasy movie and watched it last night. i fell asleep though because it was really hard to understand. so cuddling with my sweetie and all made me comfy and i fell asleep. 

today my moms side of the family is coming over to see moog and steve. i wonder what time they are all going to get here. especially moog and steve. cuz i want to be up and ready. but im not going to get up early if they are only coming over later. i would like to take some more updated pics for my myspace later on too. maybe one of my belly. my mom has been bugging me to get a pic like that, but she never asks me when i look pretty. she will come up and ask to take a pic of me like at the end of the day when i look all shitty. lol.

sarah is making the baby a really soft blanket. that is soo sweet! i really miss my friends from highschool. but you are all invited to my baby shower and hopefully i can see you all then. my mom thinks that the shower might be july 15th. but we arnt positive yet. 

im gonna go back to bed for a bit. if i can fall asleep. bye."

"event","yesterday moog and steve came over bright and early. i got ready and then went to the dollar store where i got moog a balloon and a gift bag and i got her a dolphin candle holder and some candles like moms.  then i ran over to vgs and got her an oreo cream pie cake and the 2 and the 4 candles.  when i got home i put the gift together and then me mom steve and abby went to pick christine up from jessicas house.  from there we went to kohls. mom got abby a bunch of really cute outfits and she got genelle her bday present which was mixing bowls. after that we came home and sang to moog and gave her her presents.

the rest of the night was pretty boring because pat was in illinois and im used to him being here. but hes on his way home today. i hate when they send him away for work. but i know they only do it because hes the best at what he does.

now today i have a shitty cold. i think i caught it from moog and abby because they were kinda sick yesterday. o well. today i have to go to vgs and cash in change. i also have to fax something to my case worker. then me and christine have to go to kohls and get my cousin julia a cross necklace for her first communion this saturday.  my mom got it yesterday but the stupid ass bitch forgot to even ring it up. so i have to go back and get her one. 

tommorow its julias first communion/birthday party and my dads whole side of the family is going to be there including moog and steve so im going. its another chance to see moog and steve, plus my grandma who i miss. and no one on that side of the family has seen me since theyve known im pregnant eathier. so yep. and sunday idk what yet. but monday moms side of the family is coming over to see moog and steve.

i reallllllllly want to go and get a mattress today when pat gets home. idk if we are going to have the money this week though. i think we will. but hes probably going to be tired so we will probably just end up going on sunday because saturday ill be gone all dayyyyyyyyyy. i need to go through the kitchen stuff in the garage to see what we need and what we dont need.

"event","monday morning i was supposed to go to work first but i was trying to think of everything to get out of it. so i called my case worker but she wasnt there yet. then i tryed calling michigan works and the guy was a complete asshole. he ended up telling me that my name wasnt even on the list. so i didnt have to go. that was really good, but i have to figure out why they didnt have my name on the list. so i have to call my case worker but first i have to fax these papers over. 

after that steve moog and abby got in.  abby has gotten sooo big!! shes so adorable. they visited for a little bit and then they left. i took a nap and then when i got up me and christine went up to the store and got stuff for moms birthday dinner and went to the dollar store to get her a gift bag and a balloon.  when we got home we made her dinner, made her a german chocolate cake, and then sang to her and gave her her presents.  

yesterday we got up early and went to the mall with moog and steve. we got moog her birthday presents. a cute purse filled with lotions and body sprays and these really soft yellow socks and a baby pair too. they are called socks for mommy and me. and moog got my baby these little turtle pjs. they are so adorable.  after the mall we went to my drs appointment. everything is looking good. we got to hear the babies heart beat. it sounded good. from there we went out to eat at dimitris. its so fun hanging out with moog and steve. we were cracking up the whole time just at stupid shit. 

when we got home jessica and lilly and grace came over. then moog and steve left. so we had dinner with jess and the babies. and then they left and me and pat started watching the game but we fell asleep.

this morning my back started killing me. so i went back to bed in christines bed after pat left. we really need to get a new mattress because ours sucks! and now its literally hurting me. so hopefully this weekend me and pat can go get a new mattress. 

i have to go and do laundry. so byebye."

"event","tommorow morning i have to be to my work first thing at 8 30am. and it sucks because i only get out at 2 30pm. im going to be stuck there with a bunch of low lifes and all these instructors do is be completely rude to us, read the manual...not even explaining shit...just reading it...and then they are going to tell us how to make a resume and how its important for us to get jobs. no shit its important to get a job. but this is fucking stupid and a waste of my time. it wouldnt be that bad, but its 6 hours long and i have no idea where a restaurant is on hayes and im hypoglaucemic so im going to have to eat during this period of time. i just hate this. and i heard that i might have to go 4 times a week. thats bullshit. i wont do it. because i have my schooling for the zoo coming up soon. plus i have a lotta other shit to get done. and when we get our own place id like to start studying again everyday too. and im not gonna have this bullshit work first thing take time away from my studying. maybe i can take it there. now that would be cool. i just feel like its going to be a complete waste of my time.

ok enough complaining. moog steve and abby are going to be here tommorow morning at 6 30am. they are drivng from south carolina to here tonight. they think if they drive through the night that abby will sleep. because she hates car rides. i hope she sleeps for them. this week is gonna be pretty busy. tommorow is my moms birthday too. me and pat got her a $35 gift card from fashion bug yesterday. so we are going to give her that and giver her her tanning membership and christine got her a german chocolate cake that we are going to make her. tommorow also me and christine have to pick up the certificate saying that we got her the tanning membership and we need to get some bit o honeys. because she loves those candies and the little gift card holder i got her is this soft puppy with a camo back pack so we are going to put the bit o honeys in the backpack.

tuesday is my drs appointment.  thursday is moogs birthday. so tuesday or wed me and christine need to go to jc penny to get her present and go to bath and body works to get mom her mothers day present.  then this saturday is a big family party on my dads side of the family. and sunday is a big family party on my moms side of the family here. one day this week...maybe on moogs birthday...we are going to go to the zoo. and then next sunday me and pat also have to go and pick up my necklace because it should be fixed by then. AND when moog and steve stay up at my grandmas house...i think may 1st and 2nd or something, we are going to stay there with them.

so yeah im going to be pretty busy. and im not gonna have time to go to this stupid work first thing that isnt even going to help me. 

im gonna go and eat dinner. byeeee."

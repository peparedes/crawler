"event","this period sucks...but anyway, my life is finally going up hill...i mean, i have an awesome boyfriend, friends that actually give a damn, nad my parents are letting me go out more. but it figures that once my life starts to go better, all my friends lives are sucking. lauren has been my best friend for god knows how long and she told me today that her mom won't let her eat anything. i felt like crying my eyes out today when she told me that. i mean, she tortures herself like i used to...she doesnt need that too. she's an awesome person and i love her to death. i'd do anything for her. she's grounded too, otherwise she'd be at my house eating with me. i hate to see her hurting like this.
And lindsay...she's not dealing with the pressures of high school very well. I've always known her to be a strong person, but i guess she's just finally reached that point to where all the stress is getting to her. i try to be there for her and she knows that. she knows how much i love her and that i'm always here for her if she needs to talk. 
it just makes me really upset to see my friends hurting like this, when i'm finally happy, theyre all really upset. it kills me. idk...maybe i care too much. but my friends are all i have. i'm nothing without my friends. idk...i guess i'll go. bye"

"event","jenn is so freakin pathetic. i think she needs to come up with new insults that i havent heard a million times before. and if you think that i'm going to believe anything about tom and jesse, you're wrong. youre pathetic and immature. i think you and jesse both need to get your own boyfriends so you can stop your pathetic little attempts at getting mine b/c it's never gunna happen. my baby wouldnt risk catching anything that you might have, because everybody knows that you sleep around npr. i think you should take a class on how to pronounce the name ""JHERIKA""...if you say i'm stupid,then i must be a genius compared to you. its pretty funny how you try to get tom to fuck jesse when i dont see how anybody would wanna fuck that giant blob of fat you call a female. and if you think i have fucked up hair, you should look in the miror. at least mine isnt all one big dead frizzball. you're a pathetic excuse for a human jenn, and i will personally make sure that you rot in hell. have fun catching STD's."

UGH! idk anymore. i just want him to be happy. as long as he's happy, then i'll be happy (ok, so i just completely lied to myself there, but i'm tryin hard to make myself believe that so maybe i won't feel so bad anymore.) idk...if anyone has any advice PLEASE PLEASE let me kno b4 i go insane and tear myself apart."

"event","i got in2 an arguament with tm 2day about something stupid that he did last nite...the fact that we were arguing made my stomach turn. we haven't had an argument since my birthday. but i guess it's ok that we fought b/c we're over it now and i feel a little bit closer to him. and the fact that we can both be civilized and talk things out and get over it instead of holding grudges makes me feel a lot better about our relatationship. i mean, i felt great about it before, but now i feel even better than that. i hate fighting with him, but i guess, in the long run, each fight brings us closer 2gether. i mean, he couldn't come to my birthday party b/c of something stupid, and i was pissed, so we fought and i broke up with him a couple days after that...not 4 that reason, but still. and then i went out with this other guy and it made me realize how much i really do love him and how much i missed him. so in the long run, that fight helped us out too, ya kno? idk...i guesss it all depends on how you look at things. i mean, if you look at the negative, thats what the outcome of the situation will turn out to be...but if you look at the positive, than the outcome of the situation will most likely be positive. but people have diffrent perspectives of things, so i guess that wouldn't apply to everyone. i think it makes sense tho. 

in other news, i went tanning on the beach with my aunt 2day. my face is pink, but my body is nice and tan...yay! she got a nice tan, too. we were out there for 2 1/2 hours and we talked the whole time. we talked about everything, from smoking to family problems, even sex...it wa awesome...it felt good to be able to talk to her and now i kno that i really can talk 2 her about EVERYTHING. 

by the end of the day, i was ready to fall asleep...even tho i'll prolly be up till 1a.m. like i was last nite. lol. 

guess thats all for now...peace out!"

"event","this weekend was the best. Tom got here around 12:30ish on sunday. we most of the day just cuddling on the couch. i love that. around 6 we went down the street 2 bob's house and watched cody, eli, and darrin almost light themselves on fire. then we went back 2 the house and i went in the pool while he sat out there watching me and talkin 2 mom. so i got out and got changed and of course i was freezing from being in the a.c., so tom took me on the couch and cuddled with me till i was warm. it was great. then the fire works at weeki wachi started (you can see them from my driveway) so we went outside and were just kissin under the fireworks. he was telling me that i'm perfect and that he doesn't see why i'm with him b/c i can do better. i told him i really don't think i can do any better b/c you're the one who's perfect for me. he kissd me ass big time. lol. that was our first holiday together, and i think it was the best 4th of july that i've evr had. after the fireworks were done, we went inside and cuddled on the couch again. then mom sent the kids to bed and me, tom, pat, and mom played uno. that was soooo much fun. we all felt like so high and drunk, even tho mom was the only one drinkin and there was no m.j. around. lmao. pat kept sayin stupid shit like ""CHARLES BROCCOLLI!!!!!!!"" chrles is a black peice of broccoli with maccaroni and cheese for hair. tom and pat were laughin about that 4 an hour and me n mom were sittin there talkin tryin 2 figure out how it was so funny, but we came to the conclusion that it must be a guy thing.lol. i sat on his lap 4 the first time that nite, too. i've always been to self - concious to sit on a guys lap b/c i always felt like i would crush them. but i don't feel that way with tom. he makes me feel like the most beautiful person in the world. he's constantly telling me that. i have a very low self-esteam, but ever since i met tom, that level has risen. he never lates me forget that i'm perfect to him and i'm beautiful inside and out. but yeah, anyway, back to the story. after we got done with uno, mom wanted us 2 play trivial persuit. tom didnt really wanna play, so me n tom just went inside. i guess since we didn't play that mom and pat decided not to play at all. so pat followed us inside and woke his dad up by burping tooo loud. (before we came inside pat and tom had a burping contest. it was soo gross. tom kicked ass tho.lol thats my baby.) so we all just decided 2 go sit outside. me n tom almost broke a chair. lmao. the chair wasn't sturdy enuf to hold us both, especially since i kept slipping off his lap and had 2 keep moving to get back up. so we got a sturdier chair and we all just sat out there talkin, still feeling high and wasted from being over tired. lol. then mom said we all had 2 go inside and get some sleep. (it was almost 4 in the mornin!) so me n him laid own on the couch and were cuddling under the blanket. but mom made me get up and go sleep in my room...go figure. *rolls eyes* then the kids woke us up at 9, but none of us got out of bed until like 12:30. lol. we got up and went in2 the kitchen and i ate something in front of him 4 the first time.(i was starvin b/c all i ate sunday was breakfast) so i ate a poptart. wow. lol. then we all went outside and were talkin, but then me n tom got 2 hot so we went inside and cuddled. we cuddled 4 most of the day yesterday. but mom inturrupted us in the middle of it cuz she really wanted 2 play trivial persuit. tom hates trivia games, but he told me that he'd go out there with me and watch us play. so i said ok. so i sat on his lap while we played and it got really hot so i went inside and put my bathing suit top on. (i was wearing a white shirt with black pants) so i went out there and tom gave me this look like i did somethin wrong. i'm like what? i didnt do anything! but i kinda figured that it was b/c i was wearin my bathin suit top.lol. so he was sittin there kissin my neck while i was on his lap playin the game. then he started sayin it was really hot. so i asked him if he wanted me 2 get up. he's like no. it won't really help anything. it'll just make me get up and go inside. so we started playin again and i got hot so i went inside and put shorts on. then he gave me even more of a look. lol. so we were almost done with the game and it got waaaaay too hot so i quit and me n tom went inside and...you guessed it...cuddled on my couch again. we were sittin there watchin ed edd and eddy(best cartoon ever!!!) and talkin about who reminds us of which caracter. he said i'm a mixture of sara (her mouth and attitude) and naz (every1 wants her). he said he'd b edd and kyle would b ed and chris would b eddy. lmao. but if it were just me, him, and chris, i'd b edd, he'd be ed, and chris would still be eddy. lol. then mom came in and put on cheech and chong. (aka chris and him.) that was great, even tho i didn't see too much of it cuz i was falling asleep on his chest. lol. i woke up at one point and saw him and pat like mouthing stuff 2 eachother and then tom pointed at me. i'm like what? tom said, ""pat was givin me the sign that some1 was sleepin, so i pointed at you 2 c if you were."" (he couldn't see my face the way we were layin) lol. i was fallin in and out of sleep for about an hour. then we got up and went back outside 4 a little bit. then we went back inside and cuddled there till 9 just talking and kissing. it was great. you may think it'slame because we don't have much of a physical relationship, but that doesn't matter to us...(or to me anyway. lol) all that matters to me is the way he makes me feel. he treats me like a queen. no guy has ever treated me that way before. it feels great. i actually feel loved. i've never felt this way about anyone before. he's the best guy i could've asked for. but back to the story (again). we walked up to the park at 9 to go find vinny so he could give him a ride home. we sat in the car and basically talked and made out the whole time. then we got 2 his building and i walked him up 2 his apartment to say hi 2 his parents. i was there 4 like 15 minutes talking to them and then tom told them that i had 2 go. so he walked me back out 2 the car and we were kissin in the parking lot and i told him i only had 8 days left until i had 2 leave and he squeezed me and told me that he won't let me go. lol. i kno he's gunna miss me and i'm gunna miss him soooo much. i won't b able to stop thinkin about him. he told me that he feels like we're married b/c we both have rings on our ring fingers and every time we went to kiss while he was here, my brother and sister would go EWWWWWWW!!! lol. when i went to bed last nite i felt all weird and naked b/c i wasn't in his arms. i can't wait to leave so i can get back and be in his arms again...i love him more than anything in the world. he means everything to me. and i kno that i mean everything to him and that he would do anything for me. i mean, he told me that he hasn't had a drink in 3 weeks b/c i told him that i hate drinking and i shared some of my experiences with him. so that means a lot to me. but i miss him already. lol. i gtg. peace out.

I'm leavin here around 1. i should b home and on the comp by 2. yay! lol. i wonder y nobody ever reads my journal anymore...it pisses me off...i have my whole boring little life in here and nobody cares enuff 2 read it...people=shit. thats a good song...lol. i need 2 save up like 23 bucks 2 get my slipknot cd, and then another 20 to get hell's pit (icp) when it comes out on august 31st. and i need more $ 2 get tom his bday present. grrrrr...i need a job. it just sucks that im 2 lazy 2 get 1. lol. my grandma took me to the mall the other day...got some cool clothes. and of course my much needed new shoes. lol. i'm still gunna wear my old ones, even if they are all ragged and torn. Josh is officially the biggest dickhead i've evr met. he said that if my mom comes 2 the gathering with me that he's hunna get people 2 jump her and shit. thats fuckin stupid. just b/c my mom doesnt like him doesnt give him the rite 2 do shit like that (not like any juggalo would jump a mother anyway...theres 2 much love and respect to them) but still. he's so fuckin cocky too. he thinks that just b/c he's been to shows and met abk and blaze that he's the fuckin ring leader of our 3 person spring hill circus...boy does he have it comin 2 him...me and bryan have a plan. we're gunna over throw his fuckin bitch ass. as soon as school starts, we're both gunna go around school findin all the juggalos we can. josh said the only way he's gunna give up ""power"" is if some1 fights him 4 it...so b it then. hell, i'll fuckin take him myself and win, but bryan wants 2 make sure we have back-up, just in case anything happens. but either way, that bitch is goin down. he fuckin destroyed the big top that me and bryan fuckin put the most work in2, and then bryan rebuilt it and josh daestroyed it AGAIN! so me n bryan r gunna find another place 2 build it again that josh won't kno about. the only back-up josh has is that little nut rider gabe. and gabe's 2 much of a fuckin pussy 2 fight. so either way josh is fucked. yay! lol. as you can probably tell, im bored as fuck. theres nothing 2 do and no1 2 talk 2. it blows ass. i cant wait till i get home. then i can call my baby:) i cant wait till 2morrow. i'll let u kno what happens...maybe not everything, but some of it ;) lol. and if we run in2 josh, i think im gunna have a little word with him...its hard 2 believe that i used 2 b shy as fuck and wouldnt stand up 2 anybody...i wonder what happened 2 me...oh well. all i kno is that josh is gunna get whats comin 2 him 4 bein such a cocky little bitch boy. i hope me n tom run in2 him...i think tom mite have somethin 2 say 2 him 2...:D but yeah...ill let u kno if i do run in2 him and what happens...gtg...peace out...MMFWKL"

"event","i wrote this poem a couple days ago...i'll give everybody one guess on who it's about...it's called These Four Walls

I feel so trapped on the inside
with no idea of what goes on
outside these four walls.
I stare at them every day
with no hope of being rescued.
I have no idea of what the world is like,
and it's all your fault.
You're the one who keeps me here
for any little reason you find.
You love to torture me
and tear apart my insides.
You love to hear my screams and cries,
and the fact that you make my eyes bleed.
You kno I can't do anything to you,
so self mutilation is my only choice.
Every fresh wound drips with blood
from all the pain you've put me thru.
All the yelling and scraeming...
Your voice rings in my head day and night, 
telling me that I can't do anything right 
and how all I am is a big mistake.
I think it's time I pay you back.
As I take this knife
and slice open your chest, 
you scream in pain,
and I just laugh...
I  rip out your heart
and squeeze it full of pain 
just like you've done to me for so many years.
I watch you bleed,
and laugh at the thought of how pathetic you really are.
You never knew what was coming to you...
Now you're gone
and I can finally see
what the world is like,
outside these four walls.


lemme kno what you think of it..."

"event","This came from my father, from whom my siblings and I get all our cynicism and misanthropy.

Gratitude is the antidote. It is a specific against a variety of diseases, from something as vague as the discontents of civilization to something as specific as personal grief - but gratitude is the antidote. Thanksgiving is the holiday of gratitude, and I am willing to celebrate it. I haven't always been like that.

We are told frequently that ""it is what it is."" That's a tautology, of course, and an increasingly grating cliche, but it gained prominence because it's a real reminder of a real thing: What happened happened. You can't change the past. All we have is today. See you in the future.

But regret is real. Sorrow and pain and loss - all real.

I sometimes think of civilization or society or our life as a kind of floor, a patchy, rickety floor in constant need of repair. Much like the hardwood floor in my house. Below the floor is the chasm. Some people know that chasm well - those who have to scrabble to exist in war zones, those who have tried to cope after hurricanes or earthquakes, those who have lost multiple family members simultaneously. For them, the daily comforts of society are of little use. The network of routine, the solace of art, hope for the future - none of it seems real.

Only the chasm seems real.

The chasm is only metaphorical, of course, but sometimes we live our lives entirely within metaphors. Our choice of metaphors is just a matter of taste. There's no right answer on this quiz, kids.

But still we have to get through the day. And, I am convinced, the route through the day is gratitude. Because there is always something to be grateful for, and that something is not in the chasm, floats above the chasm, denies the importance of the chasm.

You choose: sunsets, apples, bedrooms in the morning, Bruce Springsteen, a child's second birthday, the smile on the face of a passing stranger, rivers, mountaintops, cathedrals, Shakespeare, Tina Fey, the curve of a thigh, the curve of a road, a castle on a mountain in Austria, the books of Jim Harrison, the Big Hole river in July, jumbo shrimp, Pascal's Theorem, Ockham's razor, clean restrooms, potable water, French kissing or peanuts.

Can you feel the floor beneath your feet get sturdier? Can you see the holes being patched? For a moment, the bounty of the world overwhelmed you, and you were grateful to be alive at this moment. See? Antidote.

So today, if we are at all lucky, we will gather with family and/or friends and eat food and talk of shared alliances and shared memories. Many Thanksgivings are family gatherings, and family gatherings are often fraught. My suggestion is: Embrace the fraught. You'd miss the fraught if it weren't there.

Besides, there's always the moment of escaping the fraught, going outside for a smoke or down to the store for more whipped cream or out for a walk with someone you love. You can't have the escape without the prison. Be grateful for both.

What I'm going to try to do this year is slow down. What I'm going to try to do this year is to try to understand and cope, if not embrace what goes on around me.

I love you guys.

Dad"

"event","Most of y'all know I'm a hard-core proponent of breastfeeding.  I breastfed Cora for over 2.5 years, and I'm attempting to breastfeed Fiona, but will pump all her milk for her for at LEAST a year.  I have helped several mothers start or continue breastfeeding.  I will be donating some excess milk soon.  I'm all about the boobie juice.

However...

I have seen a lot of judgement of mothers who don't breastfeed, or don't breastfeed for the two years that is best.  That's baloney.  (I mean really, there are so many better things to judge people for!  Like wearing crocs!)

I am sending Cora off to seventh grade in a few hours.  And I gotta tell you, by looking at and interacting with her friends and peers, I cannot tell you which were breastfed or for how long.  What I can tell you is which ones have parents who are involved with and care about their education, which ones have parents who make time for them, which ones have parents who think their kids hung the moon (not in a spoiled way, but in a good way; all kids should believe their parents think they hung the moon), and which ones have parents who take an interest in their child's interests.

Just my two cents for the day."

"event","Most of my friends fall into one of two categories:  from conventions, and from online. <b> This is not at all meant to be anything against my friends who I met in person.  They have been incredible to me, not just during this pregnancy, but throughout my life.  This is merely a commentary on the concept of ""strangers on the internet"" as friends. </b>  

So many people say, you can't really get to know someone, or form close attachments, when your main, initial, or sole contact with them is on the internet.

So far, in addition to all the support, gifts, and help I've gotten from my family and non-internet friendships, from ""strangers on the internet"" I've gotten:

-Daily support and bolstering
-Phone calls
-help with research
-several boxes of hand-me-downs
-a box of handmade clothes, sewn to the specifications to accommodate Fiona's special needs
-two handknit sweaters
-a box FULL of spare pump parts (really, really incredibly useful)
-various items off our registry
-a special, handmade gift for Cora, pretty bracelets
-a recommendation to the perinatologist I needed to see
-a ride to the doctor
-more, that I've forgotten, because there's so much!

And two women who Drew (and later, I,) met via an online community, and who, with their husbands, have become some of our best in-real-life friends, are throwing me a baby shower tomorrow, unasked, and with no help from me!  One of them spent today, and a better part of this week, doing crafty stuff for the shower, and the other one, in addition to offering her house to host the shower, is baking a carrot cake with coconut, pecans, apples, and pineapple as I write this.

One of those women is going to be Drew's support person when Fiona's born, going over to Children's with him, being an extra set of eyes and ears, and helping him cope in those first days when I'll be mostly stuck at the hospital where I'll be recovering from the cesarean.  She was also his groomswoman at our wedding.

Strangers on the internet, indeed."

(My mom and I, when I was pregnant with Cora.)

<b>Sixty five years ago today, my mom was born.  She would have been 65 today.</b>

Margaret Cary Kauffman was born in Bethesda, MD.  I don't know nearly enough about her childhood, but I know there was some moving about, due to being the daughter of a Naval officer.  My grandfather had posts (that I know of) in the DC area, the Philippines, Hawaii, Indiana, and probably lots others.  I believe he was still off at World War II when she was born.

She went to Punahoe high school in Hawaii, then National Cathedral School for Girls for her last 2 years.  She went to a bunch of different colleges, changing her major some nine times.

She worked as a librarian, a social worker, an english teacher in another country, and a couple other jobs, plus grad school, before going to work for the federal government when I was in early elementary school.  She continued to work for them, first for the Commerce Dept, then for USAID, until she passed away.  She was ridiculously well-liked by the people she worked with.  She also went back to school, attending seminary so that she could become a UU minister.  She did her internship quarter-time, as the only clergy for a fledgling fellowship nearby, helping them grow over a number of years.  She was ordained the same summer she was diagnosed with stage IV breast cancer, so she never got her ""own"" congregation.

She and my father separated and divorced when I was quite young.  They just weren't right for each other at that point in their lives, though they had at other points, been ridiculously in love.  I was a product of an intense and unique love.  For my father, she has always been ""the one who got away.""  My mother, even when she may have been mad at my father, was gracious and kind and knew that my father and I deserved a close parent-child relationship, too.  My parents gave me something wonderful and lasting with their divorce and how they handled it.  In addition to not screwing me up with the divorce, they gave me a template for how to co-parent successfully, without your child ever being exposed to any of the marital and post-marital hostility.

She parented me with grace and love and fun.  She was uninhibited in her love of play, fierce in her defense and protection of me, and I never ever for a moment doubted how much she loved me.  She sacrificed tremendously later in my childhood, giving primary school-year custody to my dad, because living in Seattle and with my dad and going to HNA was what was better for me.  I was Cora's age when I made that change, and I can imagine how horrible a decision that was, to sacrifice her parenting time, to allow what was right for me.

We remained close even through my crazy late teen years, when I rebelled and kinda went off the deep end.  She very cleverly gave me her calling card, so I could call her, or anyone long-distance, on her dime.  She used the bills to keep track of where I was and with whom and when, clever mama!  She never judged me, just kept on loving me and trusting that I'd come to my senses, and worrying, of course.  I think it was that trust in me that kept me from going completely off the deep end.  I knew that she knew I could always pull myself back from the precipice, so I did.

Once I got my act together, which she helped me do, we were even closer.  We talked just about daily.  She was a wonderful parent to a young adult me.  She and I really enjoyed each other's company, even when we couldn't see each other much.

That same summer that she was ordained and diagnosed with cancer, I became pregnant with Cora.  Initially, she wasn't supposed to live to see Cora born.  Instead, she was at Cora's third birthday party.

She loved being a grandmother.  I had a roommate who had 2 kids, and we raised them together, so my mother was thrilled to get three grandkids out of the deal!  She was so proud of Cora and the others, she would brag about them constantly.  Yet somehow, according to those who knew her apart from the family, she was never one of those boring grandmas when talking about Cora.  Her enthusiasm was contagious.  We (the whole family, me, Cora, my best friend, her two) had moved back to the DC area to be near my mom when Cora was just under a year old.  My mother spent a lot of time with us, and with Cora.  She babysat a couple of times a month, and we all spent lots of time together.  She always told me what a great mother I was, and how proud she was of me.  I think, again, her confidence in me was what gave me the confidence to be a good mother.  When I don't feel the strength or ability to be a good mom, I try to tap into that reserve of her endless love of and confidence in my parenting.  If she believed I could do it, I can.  I really could use her right now.  I miss her, and nothing can really replace the support I'd get from her right now.  But hopefully, I can channel her strength and grace and make it through this.

My mother's life was her ministry.  She blessed everyone in her life.  When she died, just over 9 years ago, the very large church was full to overflowing with people whose lives she touched.  But she was especially beloved by me.  <b>If I am ever half the mother and woman that she was, I will consider that my life has been an unmitigated success.</b>"

"event","So, we had an ultrasound, met with the new perinatologist, a tour of the NICU and surgical units, and then met with the pediatric surgeon. The ARNP at the Seattle Children's Prenatal Diagnostic Center guided us through every part, taking notes for us, and was super wonderful. Like, we were her only job all afternoon.

<b>Short version:</b> They're now concerned about the chest size, which is small, and that's a big deal. The fluid in the abdomen is probably not bowel related, but liver congestion. Many, many appointments and ultrasounds will follow. They can't give us a prognosis or any idea even what her chances of surviving to birth are. But they're all really concerned.

<lj-cut text=""Full story:""><b>Full Story:</b>

The ultrasound found new stuff, and was over an hour long (enough that I had to move around, because lying on my back that long makes my left leg go numb.) The peri came in about halfway through to discuss stuff with us and get more views.

New info: Baby's chest is small. It's on the very low end of normal, like at the edge between normal and not. This is very concerning, because omphalocele babies can sometimes have small lungs, and small chests, and both of those are bad. They weren't as sure that the kidneys were as perfect as my old doc was after the last u/s, but that's only a minor uncertainty. The fluid around the bowel (called ascites) does NOT appear to be from a bowel defect, because if there were something in one section, there would be dilatation in the section before it. Instead, the ascites, they think, is from hepatic congestion (that's the liver). The liver is kind of the big problem, because it's most of what's in the omphalocele, and it's about 2/3 out in the omphalocele.

I'd been thinking, this whole time, that we would really want to do everything possible to get the baby to 37 weeks. Apparently, I was partly mistaken. Of course, 37 weeks is the goal, but she said that at 32 weeks is when we'll start having really frequent conversations on the risks of prematurity vs. the risks of intrauterine fetal demise. She said we shouldn't make any plans, as far as people flying out to help Cora, or when Cora should go to her dad's, until at least 34 weeks. That's really frustrating. She said we may likely be looking at hospitalization for me, so that we can constantly monitor the baby, in order to try to get her as far along in utero as possible without risking her dying. I have no idea what we would do with Cora in that case. I'm going to talk to her dad about taking her early (because this could happen as early as late April/early May.) Apparently, 32 weeks is the ""tipping point"" for all this, as before 32 weeks, it's unlikely she'd survive all her issues PLUS the problems of prematurity. So we don't really have any control over the outcome until then, baby's going to do what baby's going to do.

That bit of news was really crushing and overwhelming. There's so much I need to plan for, but so much I can't plan for, and I'm a planner, dammit!

The new peri wants to see us every two weeks for now, with formal ultrasounds every 3 weeks, though she'll also be doing ultrasounds at the prenatal appointments to keep an eye on the chest and the ascites. So that means we'll be down there almost every week. I'm really not sure how DH could take that much time off from work, so I'm going to need to find someone to drive me and hang out with Cora.

On to the NICU tour. It was kinda rough. I mean, I knew what they look like, from pictures, but I just wasn't prepared for seeing it, and seeing those babies with all the tubes and wires. I broke down about halfway through.

They will probably not have her in the NICU the whole time if her chest is okay and she's breathing alright. She will probably be spending time also on the surgical units. That's a good thing, logistically, because the rooms are bigger there and have fold-out couches. For NICU parents, there are (on a different floor) sleeping ""rooms"" that have a twin bed and a lamp, and nothing else (and only just enough room for that bed and lamp.)

Then we met with the pediatric surgeon. We actually met with the head of surgery, I assume because he's been there the longest, and these babies are pretty rare.

He talked to us about the small chest, and about the procedures for a giant omphalocele (called ""Paint and Wait""), and about how we can't know what the outcome will be, what the prognosis is, or how long anything will take, until later, mostly after she's born. He talked about the variations in the shapes of giant omphaloceles, and how it makes a difference in treating it, and about all the things that he's concerned about right now, including chromosome disorders and Beckwith-Weidemann Syndrome. The 90% survival rate is much better than the less than 50% that it used to be. But, he stressed, the 10% is mostly the babies with small lungs and chromosomal disorders. We are, apparently, not as out of the woods as I thought with regards to chromosomal problems. I thought the combined screen screened for all of that, but apparently there are a number of others that we can't know about until she's here. He, and the wonderful nurse, kept stressing that they're ""very concerned"" about this baby.

We won't see the surgeon(s) again until after the baby's born, but when she is, it'll be mostly whichever one of the team is on rotation that day, with the big decisions all being made by ""our"" surgeon. While I'm still admitted over at the hospital where I'm getting the c/s, they'll call me and keep me apprised, and I'll be able to come over (there's a special Health Sciences bus between the two, because they're partners, and so long as I am stable and stay in a wheelchair, I can go over for a few hours a day).

</lj-cut>I think that's all. I know, it's a novel, it was really a lot to take in and very overwhelming. I wish it were better."

"event","(is there any other kind?)

Something I've been thinking about a lot lately is people's reactions to our bad news about the baby.  Some of those reactions are why, I think, I'm not sharing about it as much as I could.

First, there's pity/sympathy.  This is actually the least unhelpful of unhelpful reactions.  It's hard to deal with, but it's not the end of the world or anything.  It's just kind of, I don't know... de-personizing?  I don't know if that makes sense.

Then, there's the persistent optimism.  Usually, this is a result of just not understanding the reality of the situation, for which I can't blame people, and since it's always a result of people wanting the best for us and our child, I can't exactly fault people for it.  However, it is frustrating in its absolute lack of helpfulness.  This isn't something that appears on one ultrasound, then is just magically gone when the baby's born.  We're not going to have a healthy baby (a moderately healthy child, eventually, perhaps, but not a healthy baby.)  This kind of wishful thinking kind of hurts to read/hear, honestly.  Like, I don't want to be Debbie Downer, but when I tell people what's going on, it's frustrating to hear someone react with denial of our reality.

And finally, there's judgment.  The extreme of this would be the ""what Kate did wrong to cause this problem"" brainstorming session that a few ""friends"" had, but hopefully that will be a one-time thing.  But there's also the unspoken judgments that I can tell some people are feeling/thinking.  Like, I didn't manifest a healthy pregnancy/baby, or whatever.  I realized the source of this is fear, most likely.  If you accept that this can happen to anyone, even if you do everything you're supposed to (whatever you think those things are,) then it could happen to you.  And that's scary as shit.  I can understand not wanting to be faced with that reality.

I don't blame people for their reactions, especially not the first two.  It's all human nature.

I have more thoughts.  But they'll come later."

"event","I love nachos and really anything with tortilla chips.  Unfortunately, my body does NOT love corn, in any form.  A while ago, I got the idea that perhaps Triscuit Thins (the triangular, thin ones) might make a reasonable facsimile.  I tried them in place of tortilla chips with guacamole, and it wasn't good.  But then I experimented with a couple of ways to make them as nachos.

The way that works is this: lay them out on a plate in a single layer, alternating so they fit together.  put a slice of olive on each, then sprinkle green chiles on the whole plate.  Drop on a bunch of shredded cheese, evenly covering all the crackers.  Add chili powder and possibly a tiny bit of garlic powder.  Nuke for one minute.  Immediately run a knife between the crackers, because otherwise the cheese will harden and make it impossible to eat.  Top with whole milk yogurt (my low-lactose sour cream substitute, really delicious), and/or salsa and/or guac.  If I use low-fat cheese or rice ""cheese"", it's a pretty healthy snack, or exactly the right size meal for a squished pregnant tummy.

They've all been privy to all the details of this pregnancy, and have really bolstered me throughout.  It blows my mind how many of them have been so kind, so thoughtful, and really invested time and energy in sending me prayers and positive thoughts.

But it's not just prayers, positive thoughts, and other intangibles.  One is knitting a sweater for the baby, and one poster's mother is knitting a sweater, as well!  Her mother!  

Another sent me a message today that just totally blew me away.  I sat here and cried as I read it.  Her son was born with a serious health problem, and they spent a lot of time in the hospital.  There was this one blanket that she'd wrap him up in, and hold him and rock him and ponder their life.  This blanket has a lot of meaning.  He (her son) said at one point that it had helped because <b>""babies in Bob the Builder blankets don't die.""</b>  When she was reading online about giant omphaloceles after our baby was diagnosed with it, her son came up and looked at the screen and asked about it.  She told him that she had a friend online who's baby had this condition, and explained it.  <b>He wants to send us this blanket</b>, so we can wrap our baby in it and rock her!

I'm completely stunned at that.  It's shockingly kind.  So much for ""strangers on the internet,"" eh?"

We need every yes vote we can for Ref 71, and every no vote for 1033.  Consider this: I think that every one of you knows at least one gay couple.  If you don't vote, you're essentially voting no on their domestic partnership rights.  Will you be able to look your lgbt brothers and sisters in the eye on Nov 4?

"event","Strange dream.  Want to get it down before I forget it.

So, we're going to be having thanksgiving at the home of (nonexistant outside the dream) friends, a gay couple who just had twins.  One of the couple is played by John Barrowman, but is not John Barrowman, only played by him.  Attending Thanksgiving will be him, us, and my cousin Alison (real) and her boyfriend (?).  I am to prepare and bring all the food, which is lovely, because I do a mean Thanksgiving.

We get there, and I start putting stuff on the stove and into the oven to reheat.  Gravy on the stove, pans of sweet potatoes and mashed potatoes in the oven.  

I realize I've forgotten the pumpkin pie!  Luckily, the couple live right next to Safeway, so we (Alison, myself, and John Barrowman's character, which is too long to type, so hereafter referred to as HGG -- Hot Gay Guy.  I'm sure his partner was cute, but come on, it's John Barrowman) pop over there, leaving the less hot partner of the couple at the house to stay with the still-sleeping twins.  On the way, Alison and I talk about why she isn't at her parents' house for Thanksgiving, and also about the fact that this is the third dream of mine in as many weeks that she's been in, and could there be a reason for that, probably to do with her car?  Nope, that can't be it, as she doesn't have one.  So, we arrive at Safeway, and it's closing.  HGG convinces the very tired lone employee to let us have 2 pumpkin pies anyway, and she asks that we come back tomorrow to pay, as she's closed the registers.  HGG promises, and we leave.

When we return, I realize I've left the stuffing at home!  So HGG and I rollerblade (rollerblade?) back to the house, and we talk about the babies on the way, swerving off and on the sidewalk and street.  The babies are pretty new, and HGG has a lot of questions.  Although he has come along because the stuffing will be heavy (?!), I also get the feeling that HGG is just glad to get out of the house, because new babies can make you feel a bit housebound.  On the way back, I realize I only brought the jellied cranberry sauce, where I usually do both kinds (because jellied cranberry sauce is really a side dish, to be enjoyed on its own or as a dessert, and orange-cranberry sauce-style sauce is for saucing.)  John Barrowman and I get back to their house, with the stuffing (which was only regular basic stuffing, because it hadn't been made yet when we retrieved it), and I realize as I'm putting it in the oven, that I've left the green beans in the car.

As we're ALL (!) (except for HGG, because the twins woke up and it's his turn) retrieving the green beans from the car, I apologize to everyone for such a crappy thanksgiving, because usually I do so much better at thanksgiving.  I tell them, ""I do the potatoes, the sweet potatoes, the pie, a wicked sausage stuffing, green beans, gravy, two kinds of cranberry sauce, and an incredible brined turkey.""  At which point, I realize I've forgotten the turkey.  Apparently, that was the last straw, because I woke up.  But then I fell back asleep, and we walk back into the house, greeted by John Barrowman's character, with the two sweetest twins in matching blue Moby wraps, <b>who assures me that it's okay that we don't have turkey, because at a proper Jewish thanksgiving, you don't eat turkey, you eat hot dogs,</b> and they have hot dogs.  I am much relieved, and the dream ends for good.

*********

The only part of this dream that makes sense is John Barrowman's appearance, because of having just watched Day 4 of Torchwood: Children of the Earth right before sleep.  Everything else is just odd and out of place."

We have lost 13,000 loyal servicemembers to this travesty, loyal and brave Americans who could and should have otherwise been serving their country.

When Bill Clinton was elected, my roomate and I did the One Sock Dance of Joy(tm), largely for two reasons: healthcare, and the rights of gays in the military.  He, and the congress of the day, let us down big time.  I was pissed when Don't Ask, Don't Tell happened.  I mean P.I.S.S.E.D.

The previous chief sponsor had to step down from the role because she's gone to work for the State Dept.  So Patrick Murphy, a ""blue-dog"" democrat, who won by a very small margin in 2008 in PA, (a tough area for Dems), has taken over charge of rallying the forces and getting support for the bill.  I suggest anyone who wants to donate to a tight congressional race in a year, this man may need it, and sure as hell deserves it!

There are currently over 150 cosponsors (218 will cinch the deal).  <a href=""http://www.obamaers.com/congressman-patrick-murphy-fights-against-dont-ask-dont-tell/"">Is your Rep on the list?</a>  If not, why not?  <a href=""https://writerep.house.gov/writerep/welcome.shtml"">And what are you going to do about it?</a>"

"event","So, last night, I made Alton Brown's Swedish Meatballs.  There were three notable exceptions to his method.  First, I have 1oz springloaded ice-cream scoop, so I had to guesstimate size.  Second, I have no stand mixer with which to ""beat the tar"" out of the mixture.  Third, I used buttermilk to soak the bread in, instead of milk.

Difference one:  well, he said he made 30 meatballs with this recipe.  So, when I was at 34 meatballs, and only 2/3-3/4 way through the mixture, I made them all bigger.  It was against my better judgement, as I thought the were too big.  I was right.  They took forever to cook.  I would have preferred to make 4 batches that took 2/3 of the time to cook, than 2.5 batches that took too long.  I think I was right the first time, about size, because the larger meatballs took 12-14 minutes, instead of his recommended 7-9.  Must listen to my gut more often!

Second: I tried really hard to mix the meatball mixture with my hands as best I could, for twice as long as he said to do it in a stand mixer.  But they still had more of a rough, regular-meatball texture that the fine texture of a swedish meatball.

Third, the buttermilk added a really lovely, very slight, tang to the meatballs.  Yum!

I served the meatballs and gravy over egg noodles, and it was delicious!"

"event","I made 5 lasagnas yesterday.  One has already been demolished.  1 will be delivered tomorrow to a friend from church who recently had a baby.  2 will be delivered on Tuesday to Amber581 (I can't do that linky-to-your-lj thing) for after her baby.  And the other will be nom'ed early this week.

I LOVE the no-boil lasagna noodles!  They make lasagna something that doesn't require a crapload of time and patience.

This is what I made:

1 ginormous organic yellow onion
3 lbs hormone/antibiotic-free leanest ground beef
Balsamic vinegar
4 lbs ricotta cheese
4 eggs
8 c. shredded mozzarella
~12 oz. shredded parmesan
Garlic powder
2 lbs spinach
4 jars pasta sauce
5 cans tomato sauce
Basil & other herbs
2/3 head of garlic*
No-boil noodles


*would've been a whole head, to be v. v. garlicky, but I don't want to make gassy newborns for breastfeeding mamas.

I cooked the onions, beef, garlic, and balsamic vinegar in 2 pans (1/3 to go in the non-spinachy lasagna, 2/3 to have spinach.)
I mixed 1 jar pasta sauce and 1 can tomato sauce in a saucepan, with a little garlic, and other seasonings.  This sauce was just for the bottom of the lasagna pans, so the noodles would be resting on just sauce.
I added sauces and spices to the meat mixtures, and 2 lbs of chopped spinach to the larger one.
Mixed ricotta, eggs, half the mozzarella, garlic powder, and some basil.
Layered:
Plain sauce
Noodles
Ricotta mixture*
Mozzarella (light sprinkling)
Meaty sauce
Noodles
Ricotta mixture
Meaty sauce
Noodles
Meaty sauce (less than other layers)
Mozzarella
Parmesan

*since the noodles weren't cooked, I could just spread this on the noodles, like spread on a cracker, before putting them in the pan -- much easier!

And that was it!  No messing around with trying to boil noodles, and keep them separate, and keep them whole, and trying to maneuver these big slippery fragile sheets of pasta!

And the bonus:  it's delicious!  And healthy!  You can't even taste the spinach, but I left it out of Amber's anyway.

Now, I just need to find some whole wheat no-boil lasagna noodles..."

Then, we were looking at the breakfast menu.  You know, the ""put this on your door by midnight, and we'll bring you really expensive breakfast"" menu?  And we realized that if we ordered off the ""sides"" it was no more expensive than going to Denny's.  And considering how crazy expensive the hotel restaurant is, one less Denny's trip per day is a good thing!  So we got really yummy oatmeal and bacon for me, and a bagel with cream cheese and bacon and ham for Drew, all for less than going to Denny's.  And we didn't even have to leave the room!

Surgery went fine, and the doc said he thought it looked benign, though we still have to wait for pathology reports, which will come Thursday or Friday.  I'm trying to be really happy about that, but I'm so out of it and emotional from the anaesthesia that all I can muster is vague relief.

I slept most of the afternoon, and now I'm awake off and on.

I'm in a lot of pain now.  The incision is a lot longer than I thought it'd be, and touching any part of my breast hurts.  I assume there's a decent amount of damage in there, because everyone talks about how incredibly dense and tough the area is, so it might have been a little more work to get it out.  

I'm really hoping this doesn't affect my ability to nurse future children.  The incision is from about 11 o'clock (maybe 11:30) to 3 o'clock position along my very large areola, and the bad area they took out was about 2-3cm x 1.5cm x 1cm, located a little ways out from the areola.  He said, in the consult, that he'd try to do as little damage to the rest of the network of ducts and lobes, so as to preserve my future breastfeeding ability.

There is a definite dent, which he said he'd be able to avoid, so I'm hoping that means that the rest of my copious breast tissue will take over and fill in the area sometime.

I'm also on an emotional roller coaster, coming down off of the general anaesthesia.  I'm Miss Crankypants Weepsalot.  Hopefully, that'll go away in another day or two.  My sister has had a lot of surgeries, and she's usually really cranky for the first day, then weepy for a couple of days.

I'll post again when I have pathology reports, presumably saying I don't have cancer!

We dropped Cora off at her friend's house last night, along with some Rescue Remedy and instructions for calming her down.  Cora has been really stressing about this surgery.  I've just kept trying to reassure her that even though I'm going under general anaesthesia, it's a minor surgery, and I have basically the best doc in Washington for this type of thing, and nothing's going to go wrong.  But she still worries about it.  So, at her request, I wrote her a note with the key ""why not to worry"" points that she can keep with her, and then we prayed about it, and she felt a lot better.  Cora's friend went through stressing out over HER mom having surgery last year, and everything turned out fine, so I'm hoping she'll be a comfort to Cora as well.

We check in at 5:45am, and they'll do some prepping up at surgery.  Then at 7:30, they'll take me over to Radiology, numb up my boob, and thread a wire through and into my breast, which will mark the area for the surgeon to take out.  Then, with a wire hanging out of my breast, they will <i>walk</i> me back over to surgery.  Then at 9am, they'll prep me and put me under.  I should be out of recovery by noon.

Unless they want to biopsy something outside the area that the surgeon is already going to yank, my vote is for no.  Lidocaine wearing off mid-biopsy is not my idea of a fun time, and it'll probably happen again, because lidocaine just doesn't do enough for me.  So I'd rather wait for them to look at the stuff all at once, ya know?

On the name front, I'm trying out using the names.  Hopefully, I'll get more votes from MDC."

It is hard to understand a privelege you have had your whole life, when not having it is not part of your own life experience.  But it is very real.

<b>This is Your Nation on White Privilege</b>

By Tim Wise

9/13/08

(http://www.redroom.com/blog/tim-wise/this-your-nation-white-privilege)

For those who still can't grasp the concept of white privilege, or who are constantly looking for some easy-to-understand examples of it, perhaps this list will help.

White privilege is when you can get pregnant at seventeen like Bristol Palin and everyone is quick to insist that your life and that of your family is a personal matter, and that no one has a right to judge you or your parents, because 'every family has challenges,' even as black and Latino families with similar 'challenges' are regularly typified as irresponsible, pathological and arbiters of social decay.

White privilege is when you can call yourself a 'fuckin' redneck,' like Bristol Palin's boyfriend does, and talk about how if anyone messes with you, you'll 'kick their fuckin' ass,' and talk about how you like to 'shoot shit' for fun, and still be viewed as a responsible, all-American boy (and a great son-in-law to be) rather than a thug.

White privilege is when you can attend four different colleges in six years like Sarah Palin did (one of which you basically failed out of, then returned to after making up some coursework at a community college), and no one questions your intelligence or commitment to achievement, whereas a person of color who did this would be viewed as unfit for college, and probably someone who only got in in the first place because of affirmative action.

White privilege is when you can claim that being mayor of a town smaller than most medium-sized colleges, and then Governor of a state with about the same number of people as the lower fifth of the island of Manhattan, makes you ready to potentially be president, and people don't all piss on themselves with laughter, while being a black U.S. Senator, two-term state Senator, and constitutional law scholar, means you're 'untested.'

White privilege is being able to say that you support the words 'under God' in the pledge of allegiance because 'if it was good enough for the founding fathers, it's good enough for me,' and not be immediately disqualified from holding office--since, after all, the pledge was written in the late 1800s and the 'under God' part wasn't added until the 1950s--while believing that reading accused criminals and terrorists their rights (because, ya know, the Constitution, which you used to teach at a prestigious law school requires it), is a dangerous and silly idea only supported by mushy liberals.

White privilege is being able to be a gun enthusiast and not make people immediately scared of you.

White privilege is being able to have a husband who was a member of an extremist political party that wants your state to secede from the Union, and whose motto was 'Alaska first,' and no one questions your patriotism or that of your family, while if you're black and your spouse merely fails to come to a 9/11 memorial so she can be home with her kids on the first day of school, people immediately think she's being disrespectful.

White privilege is being able to make fun of community organizers and the work they do--like, among other things, fight for the right of women to vote, or for civil rights, or the 8-hour workday, or an end to child labor--and people think you're being pithy and tough, but if you merely question the experience of a small town mayor and 18-month governor with no foreign policy expertise beyond a class she took in college--you're somehow being mean, or even sexist.

White privilege is being able to convince white women who don't even agree with you on any substantive issue to vote for you and your running mate anyway, because all of a sudden your presence on the ticket has inspired confidence in these same white women, and made them give your party a 'second look.'

White privilege is being able to fire people who didn't support your political campaigns and not be accused of abusing your power or being a typical politician who engages in favoritism, while being black and merely knowing some folks from the old-line political machines in Chicago means you must be corrupt.

White privilege is being able to attend churches over the years whose pastors say that people who voted for John Kerry or merely criticize George W. Bush are going to hell, and that the U.S. is an explicitly Christian nation and the job of Christians is to bring Christian theological principles into government, and who bring in speakers who say the conflict in the Middle East is God's punishment on Jews for rejecting Jesus, and everyone can still think you're just a good church-going Christian, but if you're black and friends with a black pastor who has noted (as have Colin Powell and the U.S. Department of Defense) that terrorist attacks are often the result of U.S. foreign policy and who talks about the history of racism and its effect on black people, you're an extremist who probably hates America.

White privilege is not knowing what the Bush Doctrine is when asked by a reporter, and then people get angry at the reporter for asking you such a 'trick question,' while being black and merely refusing to give one-word answers to the queries of Bill O'Reilly means you're dodging the question, or trying to seem overly intellectual and nuanced.

White privilege is being able to claim your experience as a POW has anything at all to do with your fitness for president, while being black and experiencing racism is, as Sarah Palin has referred to it a 'light' burden.

And finally, white privilege is the only thing that could possibly allow someone to become president when he has voted with George W. Bush 90 percent of the time, even as unemployment is skyrocketing, people are losing their homes, inflation is rising, and the U.S. is increasingly isolated from world opinion, just because white voters aren't sure about that whole 'change' thing. Ya know, it's just too vague and ill-defined, unlike, say, four more years of the same, which is very concrete and certain.

White privilege is, in short, the problem."

"event","Well, got my initial results yesterday, but the way it all happened, I was too full of pissed to write about it last night.

At first, I got a sort of good result, but only because the guy who called me with the biopsy results (the same guy who did the biopsy) didn't tell me the whole story. He told me it was just fibrosis, but that because of my family history we should take the whole mass out just to be on the safe side.  So he said he'd call my doc, and I'd see my doc a few hours later to schedule the lumpectomy and an MRI (my insistence, due to recent research about dense breasts and MRIs vs mammography)

<b>He told my doc something else (or rather, more) than what he'd told me,</b> basically that they still think there's cancer in there, and we're having a lumpectomy. I was pissed when I read the report, which said something very different than the ""just fibrosis, no worries"" that he told me.

 Quote:

 ""While the biopsy was felt to be more than adequate and certainly the appearance on ultrasound can be consistent with extensive fibrosis, <b>it also is considered suspicious for malignancy and therefore this must be considered a discordant result.</b>"" 

Basically, they can't call it just fibrosis because the other signs (see quote, and other stuff from the pathology report) point to malignancy. 

I'm scheduled for a breast MRI on the 23rd, and a surgical consult on the 25th. 

But my dad, who knows a whole bunch of the medical community in this area, is going to try to get me in sooner, and with someone better.

When I get the full written pathology report Monday or Tuesday, I'll make a whole new post, though it'll say essentially all the same stuff.  <b>As it stands now, from what I've been told and read, it sounds like they believe I likely have something malignant</b> (Precancer? Cancer? Spoiled turkey sandwich?), <b>but we won't know what/if until they yank said chunk out of me and look at it.  So, weeks, unless my dad bullies someone into helping me sooner.</b>"

<b>To get you up to date, here's what I've posted so far (just somewhere else):</b>

<lj-cut text=""Written Friday Afternoon:""><b>Written Friday Afternoon:</b>

About a month ago, I felt a painful lump in my left breast. So, I dutifully went to the doctor.

My mother died of breast cancer. She was diagnosed at stage 4 at age 53, died at 56, but they figured the initial tumor was growing since her early 30s. She had really dense, fibrous breasts, as do I. Her breasts were tiny, and her tumor was close to the chest wall. (My breasts are far from tiny.)

Her doctors said I needed to start getting mammograms yearly at 30 (I'm now 33, this was my first, I know, I know, bad Kate!) and also ultrasounds every other year, because of the dense fibrous breasts issue.

So my doctor scheduled me for a new, spiffy, digital mammogram and ultrasound at the best women's diagnostic place in Seattle.

Neither of us expected anything to come of it, especially as I discovered yesterday that the lump is actually my rib (d'oh! I feel like a dork), and the painful spot is exactly where the underwire ends on the bra I wear the most (double d'oh!)

But, I went for my mammogram & ultrasound anyways, because I need a baseline.

So this morning, I go to the Women's Diagnostic and Wellness Center, and it's like a spa. Except for the painful breast yoga (if you've had a mammogram, you know what I mean.) The mammogram lady did her thing, and set me in a waiting area to wait for my ultrasound while she showed the mammogram to the (radiologist?). A few minutes later, she came back, saying ""the doctor wants a [close-up, but I forget what she called it]"" This is when I started to worry just a little. After more breast origami, she sent me back to the waiting room, and the ultrasound tech came and got me.

The ultrasound went pleasantly, but I was noticing that she was marking some places on the screenshots. We chatted and laughed, and then she said to wait there, and she would get the doctor. Dr. E___?___ came in, and looked at the screenshots, and did some more u/s herself. Then she showed me the area and spot that concern her. By the way, it's nowhere near the painful spot! She said she'd like to schedule me for a biopsy.

So I'm having a biopsy Monday morning.

And I'm scared. 
</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Written Saturday Evening:""><b>Written Saturday Evening:</b>

My doctor called in some valium. It helped me a lot last night. I'd been so anxious that my stomach was really upset. DD and DH microwaved some beans for their burritos last night, and the smell nearly made me puke. I took half a 10mg valium, and it made me feel calm enough to eat and not crawl out of my skin, but didn't make me loopy.

I've been out, keeping busy all day, so that has really helped.

I emailed my stepdad, and he told me <b><i>my mom had </i>an adenocarcenoma of the breast, with a poorly differentiated primary and with metastases to the liver</b>.  I'm not sure what it all means, except the metastases, but I'm sure I'll look it up soon.

Can I just sleep through the next 40 hrs, please?
</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Written Sunday Afternoon:""><b>Written Sunday Afternoon:</b> 

Thank God for my husband, who has taken care of Cora while I hide in my room all day. She gets freaked when I cry.

For future reference, if this happens to you: don't go looking at breast u/s images on the internet and try to compare them to yours. You may be very smart and perceptive, but you are not a radiologist (unless, of course, you are), and you will just freak yourself out!

I've been reading all sorts of literature and stats and I've calculated all sorts of my personal chances based on my family history, what the u/s and mammo looked like, what type of biopsy they ordered, my age, what type of breast tissue I have... I'm very very silly.  
</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Today, Monday, Morning:""><b>Today, Monday, Morning:</b>

So the tech had the audacity to get sick on a day when the other is on vacation.  So I've been rescheduled to 11am Wednesday.  If I'd had the biopsy, I'd probably have gotten the results before the end of the week (they say 48-72 hours).  With the backup due to the tech being sick, I assume I won't hear in 48 hours, so I won't hear til next week.  Sigh.

I know it seems like jumping the gun to be looking stuff up and doing research.  But information really does make me feel better, and I'm mostly looking up stuff about the u/s and mammo I already had done, what the biopsy will be like, and how to interpret the results.  Also, knowing what the chances really are, and knowing what will happen, should things not go my way, and having the beginnings of a plan, makes me feel more in control, even if that's a false sense of control.  And we all know what a control freak I am.

My doc is calling in a bunch more anti-anxiety meds, since I have to wait so much longer.  Thank you all for your good thoughts.
</lj-cut>

I don't have a problem answering questions, so feel free to ask me or talk about it, I'm just doing this to keep people updated all at once, because it <i>is</i> exhausting trying to figure out who I have and haven't told what."

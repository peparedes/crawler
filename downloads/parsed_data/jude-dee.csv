I'm trying to keep my newspaper dry
I hear myself say
My boat's leaving now
So we shake hands and cry
Now I must wave goodbye
Wave goodbye, wave goodbye
Wave goodbye, wave goodbye

You know I don't want to cry again
I'll never see your face again
I don't want to cry again

We leave to their goodbyes
I've come to depend on the look in their eyes
My blood's sweet for pain
The wind and the rain brings back words of a song
And they sing wave goodbye
Wave goodbye, wave goodbye
Wave goodbye, wave goodbye

You know I don't want to cry again
I'll never see your face again
I don't want to cry again

So I read to myself
A chance of a lifetime to see new horizons

"event","1 The LORD said to me, ""Go, show your love to your wife again, though she is loved by another and is an adulteress. Love her as the LORD loves the Israelites, though they turn to other gods and love the sacred raisin cakes."" 

2 So I bought her for fifteen shekels of silver and about a homer and a lethek of barley. 

3 Then I told her, ""You are to live with me many days; you must not be a prostitute or be intimate with any man, and I will live with you."" 

4 For the Israelites will live many days without king or prince, without sacrifice or sacred stones, without ephod or idol. 

5 Afterward the Israelites will return and seek the LORD their God and David their king. They will come trembling to the LORD and to his blessings in the last days."

But if I don't come back, then I won't look behind me
All of the things that I thought were so easy
Just got harder and harder each day
December is darkest and June is the light but this empty bedroom won't make anything right
While out on the landing a friend I forgot to send home
Who waits up for me all through the night
Calendar girl who's in love with the world Stay alive
Calendar Girl who's in love with the world Stay alive
I dreamed I was dying; as I so often do
And when I awoke I was sure it was true
I ran to the window; threw my head to the sky
And said whoever is up there,please don't let me die
But I can't live forever,I can't always be
One day I'll be sand on a beach by a sea
The pages keep turning, I'll mark off each day with a cross
And I'll laugh about all that we've lost
Calendar Girl who is lost to the world
Stay Alive
Calendar Girl who is lost to the world Stay Alive
January, February, March, April, May I'm alive
June, July, August, September,October I'm alive
November, December, you all through the winter, I'm alive

Four aspirin morning, and I dive in
I put on the same clothes I wore yesterday.
When did society decide that we had to change
And wash a tee shirt after every individual use:
If it's not dirty, I'm gonna wear it.
I take the stairs to the car
And there's fog on the windows.
And I'm Fighting the words...

if i had a pet mouse, i'd name it albert.
if i had a pet giraffe, i'd name it henry.
if i had two pet goldfishes, i'd name them hootie and the blowfish...
(ok, i already had two goldfishes names that...)
if i had a pet penguin, i'd name it fredrick.
if i had a pet dog, i'd name it pookie.

winter afternoons have been swell. (:
it's been warm, so i've been unwinding from my long day at uni...
at the beach! or at mat bay.
although, i'd only get the sun for another 2 hours,
and the blasted wind is soo cold...
it's always relaxing to get away from the world
and just dwell in my solitude.

sam said that i'm a lonely person.
hmmm, maybe i am.
i love doing things on my own...
I'M A LONER.
oh whatever.

so anyways,
i don't really know why
each and every time i'm at this certain part of mat bay
(deeper in, near the big soccer pitch)
HEAPS of dogs will run up to me!

today, there was this really sweet white fluffy doggie 
it's about knee-to-waist-high...
i was sitted on one of those benches, facing the river...
and it came running up to me and it stood in front of me and started licking my hand and my face! 
and i could hear its owner screaming from behind
and i turned around, and realised the owner was like on the other end of the field!
that doggie ran all the way to me so i could cuddle it!
soo sweet...
so anyways, i cuddled the doggie and it wanted to jump onto the bench, but its owner ran fast enough to stop it from jumping onto the bench...
awww...

there's other dogs,
that will walk right up to me and start licking my face
(i'm sitted on the grass, so it's just perfect height for them to dribble their drool all over me)
but they deserve a nice cuddle and i'm sure they love to have their fur ruffled

and there's those who just wanna play,
they'd run up to me and leave their saliva-engulfed tennis balls next to my legs,
turn around in circles...
and wait for me to throw the ball some place else...
i'd move the ball near to them and further away from me,
but they'd pick it up and put it closer to my hand...
they are SO CUTE! (:
but too bad, i never dare throw the ball,
just in case their owner comes up to me and scolds me for having made them walk heaps...

and then, there's those REALLY irritating dogs,
who probably thought,
""Hey! That thing on the grass looks suspicious, it might be a good pee-ing spot""
so they'd walk curiously towards me without me noticing them,
and start SNIFFING me... 
and they'd stare deep into my eyes...
and poke their noses into all my things...
pesky doggies i tell you...
and when they're done sniffing, or when their owners have finally caught up with them,
they'll just leave...
how rude!

so anyways,
it's always good to have time alone...
today was pretty productive,
cause i managed to finish a chapter of my readings... which was horrendously long...
and i had heaps of time for my own reading!
i kinda read hosea...
and now i'm even more determined to understand the context and meaning of what the minor prophets were talking about, and to see how it's relevant for today and my life...
i'm so going to find a minor prophets guide to help me with it.

so now, i'd better start on my lab assignment that's due tmw...
boring.
funny how i'm actually in the mood to blog these few days..."

"event","i just got back from dinner with edmen...
as usual, LAVINA TAY SIERRA THE PANG-SEH QUEEN.
Dinner with edmen was good...
(: 
i don't really know how to express the joy that i feel whenever i get a chance to talk to a friend, to share stuff, to listen, to feel comfortable...
it's just such a blessing to be able to spend time with people...
yes! 
that's why yesterday was such a good day!
hmm anyways, yeah...

i saw a shooting star while waiting for edmen outside reid.
it probably lasted for 2 seconds?
it was nice and orange...
and it seemed like it was only 2cm long from where i was sitting...
obviously it's heaps bigger
(:

anyways, so i told lenard i saw the shooting star!
cause he saw one the other time, while we were walking towards my car
and he tried to tell me there was a shooting star in the sky
but as usual, i didn't trust him... so i refused to look up
only to realise immediately after that raymond and the rest saw it!
and i didn't!!!
):
i should learn to trust lenard...
ahh oh well.
so anyways, back to the story...
so lenard said to make a wish.
and i wished that my tummy will be better...
and it did get better!
HEAPS BETTER!
maybe cause i had dinner right after i saw the shooting star...
but it's good so i'm happy!

i had to have 2 tablets of bismag this morning, cause it was feeling so strange...
and i guess i made it worst by not having much the entire day...
seriously! I CAN'T SURVIVE WITHOUT FOOD...
i'm going to bathe and find more food to munch on while i do all the crappy work i have to do.

I WANNA GO MUSEEE

and cause i was blasting it...
it hung on the APPLAUSE and it RANG non-stop...
i panicked and pressed everything i could press to try to shut my lap top down or mute my lap top...
i ended up using my pillow to buffer the noise...
MY DEAR PILLOW...
):
oh wells, anyways, it's kinda cranky, so i better start backing up all my files at the end of each week...
just in case my lap top crashes on me anytime soon...
HELP.

i am currently... hungry again.
if you guys know how much i actually bring to uni for lunch...
you'll know that i don't actually have much for lunch...
i'm like some poor kid who eats from a mini lunch box.
and i mean MINI.
so even though, it's only been 2 hours since i had lunch and my medium soya flat white, i can feel the emptiness of my tummy...

i need to rest.
and everyone knows i don't usually blog about my life... in such detail.
but i really can't seem to sleep,
so i'm using whatever energy's left to rant about my exhuasted body.

but anyways, yesterday was a great day...
at least i think it was.
although i missed two lectures in the morning 
(what's new, i can never seem to wake up for them! even when i don't have clashes)
but it was... good speaking up in BOTH psyc labs/seminars...
i never usually say much in psychology classes... cause i usually don't know anything to say anything...
but i managed to say heaps yesterday, at both classes,
and FINALLY,
the whole ""i'm an asian, therefore i'm quiet, and i talk to myself and nobody else"" stereotype's like GONE...

and i must say, i really do enjoy having group work with every other member being caucasian and myself being the only asian...
really takes alot of courage to speak up and yet at the same time, KNOW MY STUFF so i don't talk crap...
yeah ok, i'm just rambling...
but, i never felt this eloquent before.

it's always easy talking to caucasians individually,
and i do have pretty good coursemates/friends who are caucasians...

anyway, enough rambling about that...
i guess the next most impt thing that made yesterday such a GREAT day...
was that i smsed most of my closest friends in singapore.
people whom i really missed.
and those, whom i haven't had much updates from...
so i spent like $30 just chatting with them.
(:

quotable quote from stir,"" I was so happy when I found fake crunchy nut at aldi! and it tastes just like the original!"" hahaha! (: ok, i deleted my whole inbox yesterday, cause i had no more space, so i can't remember your exact words...

quotable quote from jia,"" I'm going for counselling for wearing shorts and slippers to school again."" Then she mentioned something about giving herself valium and giving the counsellor something else... ahh i can't remember...
but i was laughing to myself... i'm a mad kid.

i should be having dinner NOW..."

"event","'People ask me, ""What is the purpose of life?""  
And I respond: In a nutshell, life is preparation for eternity.  
We were made to last forever, and God wants us to be with Him in Heaven.

We were made by God and for God, and until you figure that out,
life isn't going to make sense. Life is a series of problems:  
Either you are in one now, you're just coming out of one, 
or you're getting ready to go into another one!

The reason for this is that God is more interested in your character than your comfort.
God is more interested in making your life holy than He is in making your life happy.
We can be reasonably happy here on earth, but that's not the goal of life. 
The goal is to grow in character, in Christ likeness.

When I get up in the morning, I sit on the side of my bed and say,
God, if I don't get anything else done today, I want to know You more and love You better.  
God didn't put me on earth just to fulfill a to-do list.
He's more interested in what I am than what I do.  
That's why we're called human beings, not  human doings.

""Happy moments, PRAISE GOD. 
Difficult moments, SEEK GOD. 
Quiet moments, WORSHIP GOD. 
Painful moments, TRUST GOD.
Every moment, THANK GOD. ""'"

Coming out in blue
All your fountains, all your lovers
Are the first to bloom

And you get away
Running at the break of day
Head down, nose to the ground
Running with your eyes closed

Dragonflies and buttercups
Chinese burns and rubber mats
Spring is gone and summer's fleeting
I found the whispers of your leaving
Judy, where's your smile today?"

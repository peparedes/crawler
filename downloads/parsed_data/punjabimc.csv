heres anotha song i luv... by anthony hamilton -- comin from where i'm from

Verse I 
Sittin here guess I didn't make bail 
Got time and a story to tell 
Started when I was nine years old 
Woke up my daddy was gone 
I started hustlin they couldn't tell me nothin 
Frontin in the hood tryin to be somebody 
My soul was on empty 
I was searchin for something 

Pre-chorus 
Tried to be good; Tried to keep from trouble 
Livin too fast; Tryin to make good on a hustle 

Chorus 
Sometimes it gets rough 
Comin from where I'm from, I'm from 
Times got hard 
Comin from where I'm from, I'm from 
Some times you gotta walk to work (yeah) 
Comin from where I'm from, I'm from 
Sometimes you gotta do a little dirt 

Verse II 
Wasn't really lookin guess I found it 
Five foot three, light brown skin 
Comin from the university 
Nice style, lookin kinda lovely 
Didn't know she had much game 
Down to ride out, even take the train 
Even took her to a poker game 
She's top notch from fried chicken to sushi 

Pre Chorus 
Tried to be good, (I tried) tried to treat you like a lady 
Tried to be a friend, turned out that you were shady 

Chorus 
Sometimes it gets lonely 
Comin from where I'm from, I'm from 
Thangs aint what they seem to be 
Comin from where I'm from, I'm from 
Sometimes you get a little angry 
Comin from where I'm from, I'm from 
Sometimes you get the best of me 

Bridge 
Well, tried to be good (I tried) 
Wanted nothing but to love somebody 
Didn't wanna die young 
Steady hustlin tryin to feed my family 
Too scared to have kids 
And do like daddy did 
Cuz I'm so scared of failin 
Sometimes it gets hard 
Comin from where I'm from 

Chorus 
Comin from where I'm, I'm from 
Sometimes you gotta moan 
Comin from where I'm from, I'm from 
Sometimes you gotta cry a little bit louder 
Comin from where I'm from, I'm from 
Sometimes you gotta fight the pain 
Comin from where I'm from, I'm from 
Sometimes you gotta walk alone 
Comin from where I'm from, I'm from 
Sometimes you get a little worried 
Comin from where I'm from, I'm from 
Sometimes you get lost outta touch 
Comin from where I'm from, I'm from 
Sometimes I think I pray a little bit too much 
Comin from where I'm from, I'm from 

Sometimes I get a little scared 
Comin from where I'm from, I'm from

Some people live for the fortune
Some people live just for the fame
Some people live for the power
Some people live just to play the game (luv that line lol)

Some people think that the physical things define what's within
And I have been there before, and that life's a bore
So full of the superficial

Chorus
Some people want it all
But I don't want nothing at all
If it ain't you baby 
If I ain't got you baby (very cute lines!)
Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything
But everthing means nothing
If I ain't got you

Some people search for a fountain
That promises forever young
Some people need three dozen roses
And that's the only way to prove you love them

Hand me the world on a silver platter
And what good would it be
With no one to share, with no one who truly cares for me

Chorus

Chorus

If I ain't got you with me baby
Nothing in this whole wide world don't mean a thing
If I ain't got you with me baby"

There are places I'll remember
All my life though some have changed
Some forever not for better
Some have gone and some remain
All these places have their moments
With lovers and friends I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life I've loved them all

But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new
Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life I love you more

Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life I love you more
In my life I love you more"

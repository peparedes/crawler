"event","I'm getting burnt out. Everyday I've been spending in a lull of job-hunting. Spending hours filling out the same tic for tat information. Name. Birth date. Address. Education. Work Experience. Even after spending hours applying for things, I still feel unaccomplished and anxious. I feel like I've wasted my day, and, when you get down to the real logical/utilitarian kind of thinking, I, in reality, have. 
Reducing yourself down to numbers and stats is depressing too. Applying for jobs with poorly written job descriptions (grammatical errors and misspellings abound) is kind of adding insult to injury. I've been avoiding craigslist for this very reason. My parent's friends and relatives scoff at my religious studies degree, and now I preemptively shrug and offer up the fact that yes, I know it wasn't the most practical degree to get and everything. There is no job title ""heremenutrician,"" I know, but fuck it. I've worked hard. I've probably read more books in the past year than they have in the past ten years. But no one even cares. Apparently, some employers will skip your resume entirely if it's in good old Times New Roman. That font shows ""unoriginality."" It's almost funny in a Vonnegut-esque way. I went to school for four years, paid somewhere around the neighborhood of 20,000 dollars, only to have my resume tossed aside for an unoriginal font. Or have my cover letter casually cast aside because it was too long (and I usually spend a preposterous amount of time on those bad-boys: It takes me a long time to write letters because I am overly cautious about what I say). Get this, I applied for a job as a Barista and was rejected because I had no Barista experience. I have a fucking bachelors degree. I'd say that that kicks the living shit out of Barista experience. What does it take to make a fucking coffee drink anyway? All you need to do is push buttons! 

I somehow need to make it clear to the world that I'm not just a collection of numbers and statistics. I'm a person. I have thoughts and ideas. I'm complex. I have something beautiful to offer the world. I think. I hope."

The FSO test went quite well. It was much easier than I thought it would be. So, I'm crossing my fingers. Driving back to san diego was absolutely beautiful and great. I stopped in Santa Onfre beach and walked around for a while; everything was green and the skies were all clear. 
When I got home I took a personality test on okcupid and it basically told me I was an asshole and no one liked me. Which is really funny, because I was just trying to be honest. Literally, it says ""if you were the last guy on earth women still wouldn't want to date you, or fuck you."" I thought ""hey! fuck that I am a desirable dude!""

eventually, the juices from the raw ground beef will find a way through the spaces between the woven threads of the sock that the meat has been stuffed into. at this point, we will invent a game using the sockmeat similar to the game of foxtail where there is a ball connected to a length of fabric and it gets spun around and eventually thrown where it will then be caught by you or i.

or

sockmeat as a perverse way to curb foot odor.

Directions:
1. Buy ground beef
2. Find a lone sock
3. Spread a thin layer of beef onto the bottom of the sock, creating somewhat of a meat sole.
4. Put your foot into the sock
5. Place sockmeated foot into the shoe
6. The meat in sock will absorb the naturally occurring foot odor
7. Unfortunately, now you smell like you have rotting meat in your shoes (which you do)

Spring Valley. I was thinking about it today, and all my favorite places were the ones that felt halfway real. Their vagueness lets you fill in the blanks, like a poem you love but don't understand.

They don't know a damn thing about me but I won't argue with them. I am sort of an asshole, but not for the reasons they tell her I am. 

This whole situation is bringing out everything I've hated about our relationship. The misunderstandings, the fights, the drama, all this self destructive bullshit, most of it designed to make the other person feel bad. Throughout this whole affair I start feeling more lonely, start thinking that she never understood me. I broke her heart and she will be sure that I am in a world of pain for it. She will stomp and tear that little part of me that still cares about her until it is no more. And it's almost gone. I wasn't over her when I gave her a ride home, or spent the night, or called her to see how she was doing. 

she is over me. that's what she doesn't realize. she doesn't give a fuck about me. she wants to succeed just so she can rub it in my face. she hates me. she will remind me, constantly, of how difficult I've made her life and how unhappy she is and how cynical i've made her and how she can't go on without me. and she knows that it hurts me to hear that. it sucks to have someone blame you for all this negative shit in their life

she doesn't love me anymore. if she says she does she is lying to you or herself. 

and then I wonder if she ever did love me, or if I was just some Thing that made her happy. There is a difference. when you love someone you trust them. you ask questions before screaming ""asshole!"" When you love someone you don't try to hurt them. You do what you can to make them happy, even if they hurt you. 

Maybe her mom and her ex boyfriends were like that, always trying to get back at her, like some kind of fucking game. But that doesn't matter. She should see that and be bigger than that.

I've been feeling like a Thing lately. A Thing who is warm and gives her rides and makes her feel good and cuddles up close and sleeps. A Thing who's emotions need no consideration. A Thing who is as predictable as other guys. A Thing who needs nothing in return. And she's mad at me for taking that Thing away from her. she wants me to pay. and i have. I've paid with the part of my heart that cared for her. and I'm done. I'm done with taking it in and taking it in and not getting pissed off about it. I'm done with feeling shitty. I'm done with caring, because right now she is using that to hurt me.

I'll have had the best sex/blowjob/orgasm/whatever
I'll have had the most fun in a single night
I'll have taken my most satisfying shit

I'll have attended the worst party
I'll finish the most beautiful thing I will ever create

Who was the smartest person to ever live?
Who was the best fucker to ever live?
Who was the most attractive?
Who took the most satisfying shit?
Who had the most fun in a single night in the history of mankind?
What was the best party, again, in the history of our species?
The best dinner?
The best album made, ever? (probably Neutral Milk Hotel's Aeroplane Over the Sea)
The best song? 
Most badass dude?
Best Movie?
Biggest asshole?
The most beautiful place in the world?

Thus, beginning this Monday, July 14th,  2008, I will begin said experiment. I will buy only the cheapest of food. I will drive as minimally as possible. I will allot a finite amount of cash for cigarettes, beer and coffee. Needless to say, this will suck ass hella bigtime. However, at the end of this incredibly conscientious 30-day period, I will compare financial records and discover if this self-discipline  makes any goddamn difference. 

So if I come your way smelling like spaghetti-o's and unwashed clothes, don't turn away. Offer up some encouragement. Gimme a pat on the back. Buy me a drink. 
Cheers!

*thanks mum and dad for making summer extra care-free and fun."

""What a welcome change it would be,"" McCain wrote in his invitation, ""were presidential candidates in our time to treat each other and the people they seek to lead with respect and courtesy as they discussed the great issues of the day, without the empty sound bites and media-filtered exchanges that dominate our elections.""

I also like McCain. Maybe I am less cool because of this. But that is also OK."

1. Live in santa cruz
2. Make lots of money
3. Forget the pain of being a man



here is a list of questions I would have to answer ""no"" to:
1. Can I borrow some money?
2. Will you marry me?
3. Have you ever tasted your own semen?
4. Do you like the music your co workers listen to *subquestion* do you like cramming poop into your ears?
5. Given the history of mankind for the past 10000 years, do you think there is any hope for our species?
6. Is catcher in the rye a book about the coming of age?
7. Is belle and sebastian a good band?
8. Isn't science just another kind of religion?
9. Do you have anything besides dairy products in your fridge?
10. Can we get coors light instead?
11. Lets tango!
12. Aren't you getting sick of Mac and cheese?"

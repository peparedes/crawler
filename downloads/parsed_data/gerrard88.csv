Vienna was to visit my friend Caroline and her twin sister. I met Caro in NZ and we stayed in touch. She came to visit me in Prague and so I visted her in Austria. <br /><br />The following week Chop and I met up with some of his American friends in Venice. Had a great time, riding on the water, drinking the brew and getting covered in Pigeons.<br /><br />Enjoy.<br clear=""all"" />"

"event","I'm off to Vienna for the Long weekend. We've been working night shifts so I'm pretty whacked. Get to sleep in which is good. Taking the train down on Saturday morning. I'm also thinking I might go to Budapest next weekend. Work is going well and it looks like I'll be finishing up in June. Then onto an exciting new project. I'll post more when I have details.

Apparently Angelina Jolie is in town at the moment. I spotted Rachel Weisz wandering round the streets of Prague the other weekend. She had baby and husband in tow. 

I've also booked my wonderful mum a ticket to come visit me in Prague for her 60th birthday. She'll be here for a couple of weeks and I wanted to share Praha with her. I think the last time she was in Europe was when I was a baby. So it's been a while."

"event","So on the day after Easter there's a Czech tradition of whacking girls on the bum with a stick. Basically you have to have a special stick and if you see a girl you whack her on the butt with it. She then has to say 'Thank you' and give you either an Egg or a Shot of Alcohol. It means she will be young and beautiful forever.

Someone ran up behind a kiwi friend of mine and whacked her on the arse (after looking at the other guy she was with to see if it was OK.) Apparently the expression on her face was priceless. Consequently there are not a lot girls on the streets of Prague on Monday... apart from confused pissed off tourists. ;)"

"event","So over the weekend I brought a sketchbook. It's been a long time since I filled a sketch book. I feel like it's something I've grown a part from, but drawing and animation is what lead me here in the first place. It's like a long lost love. I miss it. It feels good to be sketching again... exploring. The last time I felt like I drew properly was in LA at this crazy underground Life Drawing class my good friend and talented artist <a href=""http://www.vozart.com/"">Mike Vosburg</a> lead too me too. (Mike is the guy that did the awesome sketch of Ash on his <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/ashleighsoutham"">Myspace page.)</a>

There are so many amazing little bars and clubs in Prague.. all over the place. You could eat at a different one each night. In spite of it's name, my local, The Blue Light Jazz Bar... doesn't seem to play any Jazz. Last night I ventured out (a whole block down the street.) and found <a href=""http://www.malyglen.cz/"">U Maleo Glena</a> (Little Glen's) What a place! and what a great place to listen to Jazz. I stayed there way too late (1.10am) and my cold seems to have taken advangtage of the situation. An early night in for me. 

Then there's the fun of trying to work out the cooking instructions of the dinner I want to make. Trying to venture away from meals that are... 1. Put in Microwave 2. Set to four minutes 3. Push START. Exploring new things seems to be my theme for this month.<p>

"event","So our gear arrived from New Zealand looking like the crap had been kicked out of it. My computer is OK, but my monitor as you can see has a cool new spiderweb screen saver. It was packed pretty tightly, but yet it still got totaled in transportation. Something hit it sooo hard that it warped the back of it. OUCH

Chop's(Andrea's) computer is a dead duck. Production will pay to get everything replaced, but this slows us down a little bit. No worries, We'll catch up... we always do. I'm working on my back up 20 inch monitor at the moment. (always carry a spare.)

This is the second these monitors I've had mauled in transit. The first one died in action coming across the Tasman to New Zealand on a plane. Something managed to hit the one weak spot in the packet and puncture the screen. Cursed I tells ya... cursed!

Most importantly it is near one of my favourite places, The Blue Light Jazz Bar. A great little low key place that I thoughly recommend if you are in town. Not too touristy. I'll post some more pics from NZ real soon. Looks like our gear is not getting here until Monday, so we have a couple of days of sitting around and throwing paper darts at each other.

The boys are all here. Chris fucked himself up on St Patrick's Day. Great to be sitting here back in the US. Basket Ball playing on the big screen TV, everyone messing with their laptops, drinking, eating advanced junk food. America has such advanced sacks. It's awesome, there are so many ways to distract yourself. It feels really fun to be back in The States. I do really like this country for all it's misgivings it's a great place.

I'm in the process of repacking my bags. I always get a little paranoid about excess luggage at the moment after getting screwed by British Airways to the tune of $1000 for one extra bag. I'm still smarting from that one, even though the production helped cover the costs for that one. Very soon I will be on my way back to Europe, via the United States. I'm stopping over in LA for a couple of days to see my good friends and stay with Chris Garnett. I'm looking forward to seeing the Playa's Del Ray again and spending some time with them. I'm thinking I need to check who's picking me up from the Airport or whether I just get a rental car. Funny the important things you leave out when you are getting ready to go. Feeling pretty spaced out. Tired. Returning to Prague on Wednesday. But good to see everyone, but there are dramas to sort out. I have so many things running through my head at the moment. So many things shouting for my attention. I should make a list, that always helps to process stuff. Clear my brain. Take care all while, I'm gone, good to see everyone and hang out for the past 10 weeks. I'm planning to keep this damn blog more up to date."

Well we all brought first class train tickets and Mike, Rpin and our tour Guide Swiss Chris, set off on our journey to Austria. Heading south.<br /><br />The train trip was uneventful and I survived my brush with Czech Train cuisine. It's always fun looking into the kitchen cart to see the Chef's friend chatting away while having a ciggy together over the soup.<br /><br />We knew we had arrived in Vienna when we swapped our slightly dumpy Czech Customs Policewomen for ridiculously hot Austrian Lady Cop in tight pants with German accent. (Mike did his best to get arrested.)<br /><br />Lucky for us the multi lingual Swiss Chris speaks German and he was able to translate for the whole weekend. We stayed at a VERY swanky hotel which was a fine example of Modernist design. We met up with our friends Jillian and Mandra (they're teachers... yes... I know! I know!) and went out on the town.<br /><br />We ended up at a club called Passage. Lots of pumping Euro techno music, stunning women and really tall men. Mike and I both felt short and we realised that this really was the place that Terminators and future Governors of California were born.<br /><br />Girls if you like 'em tall... Go to Austria.<br /><br />The next day we hit the Museum circuit and checked out an impressive Picasso Exhibition, Saw Gustav Klimt's The Kiss (which is huge.) and went to the Modern Art Gallery (pictured). The highlight of the exhibition was a full sized 'overweight' Ferrari and a self aware, talking, 'overweight' house, that moaned about being a work of art and wanted to be outside.<br /><br />That night we travelled up into Wine Country and had an amazing evening. Sampling different wines. Eating amazing food and chatting away into the night. Chris hit it off with a local artist who he met at the hotel and was hanging one of her paintings. Unfortunately although she was quite delightful, she spoke only limited English and her and Chris spent the evening chatting in German.<br /><br />She was a nice lady, and it was a bit of a surprise when her hair caught fire. Leaning across the table to toast me, her hair brushed a candle and there was a flash. She patted it out instantly, smiled politely and then continued talking (while I stood there with my mouth agap). That is one cool European lady. If that had been LA, there would have been 20 minutes of tears and consoling in the bathroom.<br /><br />We went back into town, visited a few more bars before retiring to the hotel bar for a nice class of port and some blues music. The boys shared a cigar and I retired to my room.<br /><br />The next day we visited a couple more galleries and the museum before heading back to the hotel to catch the train back to Praha. It rained most of the time we were there, but it did not dampen our spirits. More photos of night life in Prague to post soon.<br clear=""all"" />"

I've been pretty slack as work and social life have been keeping me busy. We are catching the train down to Vienna tomorrow for the weekend. Should be alot of fun. I'm enjoying living here but it is cold. We had a little snow the other day and I fear it is going to get a lot colder. <br /><br />Planning to go backpacking with my American friend Chris over the christmas break and will be back in New Zealand in early January. Then two months work back home, then back to Prague and then I'm trying to get on Post Production which will be in London.<br /><br />I am practicing my local Czech and can say a few words. I've been on a few dates with some local girls and they have helped me a lot. Also the beer here is amazingly good and only costs about fifty cents US. It's actually cheaper to buy beer than water when out at a resturant. Speaking of which I have to go get some dinner. Love to you all.<br clear=""all"" />"

My good friends, Gerardo, Anthony, Elliot, Emily and Lu, gave me a great send off on the Tuesday night. They took me out to the Whiskey Bar to see Hardcore Rock Band Mushroom Head. Not my usual cup of tea, but a great time none the less. Whiskey Bar was a great venue home to where The Doors played and Jim Morrison lived right around the corner. <br /><br />I sold my car on the way home after this picture was taken. The guy got it for a steal, but it was out of my hair. He tapped me on the window and said pull over, there was some haggling and he tried to tell me a sob story. We'll see what happens. He was looking very pleased with himself until it stalled on the way out the driveway. He looked over at me and I smiled... you brought it without taking it for a test drive... it's your problem now.<br clear=""all"" />"

I sitting in our new spacious office trying to shake my jetlag, surrounded by one of the most beautiful cities I have ever seen. I really feel like I've stepped into a children's story book world. We are right in the centre of town surrounded by old Gothic buildings and cobbled paving stones. The people here are brisk but friendly and I have a great little hotel room. We are staying at the Intercontinental. If you have been here before, you need to see this place. It's like time walked past it (and added cars and tourists.) I will post more detailed posts soon about the mischief I got up to in the US just before I left, but Jetlag has turned my brain to custard.

I had a blast and got quite totaled.  <br /><br />One of the cool things about being in a different timezone is I get to have a 48 hour birthday. Friday here is Saturday in NZ and then Saturday here is the 30th (my birthday) see how that works... extra birthday lovin.<br /><br />My good friend Sarah and I went to Santa Monica pier for my New Zealand Birthday on friday and went on all the rides. We got quite compeditive and the highlight was a ride on the Ferris Wheel.<br /><br />I got some beautiful presents from back home. Mum brought me a gold kiwi broach and a copy of 'The Incredible Lightness of Being'.. Ash sent me an amazing CD with his cover of 'Hello Operator' by the White Stripes (he's an amazingly talented lad) and Dad's present came wrapped in the same timeless fluro orange 1970's wrapping paper we've been getting presents in since we were kids. Chris gave me a framed pic from Kernsville and Emily gave me a head massage that resulted in my new hairdo for the evening (see pics).<br /><br />After realising that our BBQ belonged to the room-mate who was moving out, we were saved by our neighbour, Geof, who leant us his and dropped by later armed with photos of his trip to South Africa.<br /><br />Everyone came and for the first time, LA has really felt like home. (and I'm leaving in three weeks.) We ventured off to another party of my previz co-workers, Chop (Andreas). Spent the rest of the night running around with my mad drunk Afro. Taught everyone the ""Yee Har"" Drinking game and had a blast.<br /><br />Off to San Fransico this weekend and then planning a trip to Los Vegas for the following one, and then I'm off to Prague. The United States has treated me really well, and the sad thing about my birthday is there are now more friends to say good bye too.<br clear=""all"" />"

I've got used to the idea of telling people I'm 29 instead of 28. 28 was a good year. I had alot of fun. Some wild times and I feel like I've grown so much recently in the last six months. I feel like I've grown bigger, if that makes sense. 

Exciting things are on the cards. I'll be sure to post lots of cool pics from my party. I miss you all who can't be there and will be thinking of you all, friends and family. I just got given a beautiful drawing for my birthday by one of the storyboard guys, Mike Vosburg and am quite touched. Take care all. Wuv G.

"event","11/9 doesn't have the same ring to it, does it. But that's what I'm used to. Not 9/11. Adjusting to the dates and remembering to write week before day is just how they do things here (and has caused the accounting department no amount of confusion when I fill in my timesheet. ""What, you mean he's been working here for two months already?"")

I'm not watching TV while I'm here, apart from pausing by to watch American Football in Lionel's room and scratching my head trying to work out the rules. So I feel no real effect on me of the day in question. My reason for not watching American TV? It's scary, terrifying and VERY addictive. They have a Military channel here on cable... wow... and it's REALLY interesting. I was about ready to sign up and go fight the Jihardists just to use some of those cool gadgets, when I remembered I don't like exercise or getting up early.

The thing that will always strike me about 9/11 is it's our version of the Kennedy Assassination, everyone can pretty much remember what they were doing when they heard. I was half asleep, about to get up early to shoot some photo reference with James, (I remember because talking to him later, his dad had an office in downtown NY.)

I was awoken by my English flatmate screaming ""OMG"" and me thinking it's one of her overseas friends and wishing she'd shut the hell up. I got up and went outside to get something from my car. She rushed outside and said ""America's just been attacked!"" ran off, and my first thought was 'Nukes! Oh Shit"" I turned on the TV a just say people covered with dust, and thought... this is it... World War Three. Then we found out about the planes. Glued to our TV for the whole day. Everyone scared, ringing people, telling Ash, telling Miriam. People who knew, people who didn't. I guess it's important to remember the shock of that moment, when you thought the world might end. Everything changed then. The world got that little bit more darker that day.

I know others are being a bit more critical of the whole memorial thing, but it's important an important moment, that we were actually there for. I guess working on WTC reminded me that. I still haven't seen it yet. I'll get it on DVD, seems more appropriate to watch it on the telly, the way I saw it when first time round, safely tucked away in NZ."

"event","So last weekend was Labo(u)r weekend. I only found this out just before that I had the Monday off work. My good buddy from work, Chris, who works on Caspian as a PA invited me to go camping with his buddies. So we set out on Friday into the Hollywood traffic. Chris has a built in GPS system in his car, he punches in the address he wants to go and satellites and CPUs do the rest, no brain/map required. Destination: KERNSVILLE, USA. 2.5 hours north of LA.

We arrive slightly before midnight to a rousing welcome from Chris's brother and buddies. There was a total of about 14 of us packed into the camp site and there was much merriment that followed. The next day we floated down the the Kern river in Inner Tube Tires, drinking beer, singing songs and riding rapids. Gentle cries of ""ahhhh my ass just got raped by the rocks!"" and ""Sweet Mary Mother of God, That hurt"" echoed around the peaceful valley, as we bumped along the river.

While hanging by the river in our individually named River Rat water tubes, we met a curious fellow, by the name of AJ. AJ, who seemed to have taken a shine to the ladies in our party offered to show us where this amazing natural water slide. Naturally we were suspicious when some half cross between ""The Dude"" from the Big Lewboski and John Kerry, offered to take us up into the mountains, alone.

The next day, AJ shows up at our campsite, convinces us to go and our convey of three vehicles, heads out. Much was made of our winding half hour trip into the rocks, many horror film scenarios filling our conversation.

While on route, the boys and I thought we had discovered the universe's most kick ass radio station. 88.1 FM, after grooving along to Weezer's Beverly Hills, we were stunned by the progressive strange mix of Micheal Jackson, Tom Petty, Eazy E's Boys in the Hood and a healthy dose of Glam rock. We speculated on the pirate radio station we were listening too, cheering when we had reception and booing respectively when it seemed to fade. Amazing by the lack of censorship and DJ chatter. Upon arrival at our destination we demanded that the other vehicles in our convey listen to this great radio, only to find out the Ipod in Ginger's car was broadcasting on that frequency and we were picking it up on our radio two cars back. So much for Pirate radio.

After a twenty minute walk up a mountain, certain that bandits were waiting for us around the next bend, we arrived at this amazing natural rock slide. Several families were already enjoying natures Slip'n'Slide running down the rocks and leaping into the pool at the bottom. We took turns leaping down the rocks and splashing around (I'll post the photos on my Flickr account.) A local police officer dropped by to film some people leaping in the water and was good enough to take our group photo. We walked down to another rock pool and stopped to take some photos, by the Sheriffs cop car, which he had left parked at the top of the hill.

After jumping into the rock pools and nights spent drinking, partying and fire walking, we returned to LA Monday morning, batter, sun burnt and bruised. (Some more so than others.) Chris, who managed to ride the rapids sans Inner Tube has a hairline fracture on his knee and busted his elbow. He's fine, but he hobbles around the office and he and I share a secret smile. He's proud he showed me a good time, and keeps asking how I enjoyed the part in the tent, when the girls decided that bikini tops were over-rated and needed removing. As with all good times it came to an end and as we returned to civilization to find the Crocodile Hunter is no more. Crickey!"

There's a thought in the back of my mind that I might spend christmas in London. Still working out the details.

Been going out lots and having a blast with my new local friends. Found a pub that was playing the All Blacks vs Australia a couple of weeks back, completely random, stopped in to watch and was the only one in the bar yelling at the screen. ""GO you good thing!!!""

My buddy Chris is intrigued by the idea of cricket, although I suspect that he is more intruged by the idea of drink for a whole day... you should have seen his eyes light up when I told him about test matches. He has a cool place on the beach and I have been quite a beach bum recently.

Planning to check out some more of the music scene, went to a street music festival yesterday and have been to one block party.

Saw Snakes on a Plane, finally. In an old hollywood theatre, kinda like a mini-civic theatre in Auckland. The film's a lot of fun and more violent than I first thought, It's very silly and is about what I had expected.

I'm flatting with four other guys and it's a massive place. An airhockey and pool table take up the front room and the lights are a bit iffy in my room but I have Cable TV. The house has air conditioning which is standard in LA and left on most of the time. Which is a relief as yesterday the temperture here sky rocketed to 114 degrees fahrenheit (44 celsius!) But lucky I was not here, no I was in SAN DIEGO!!!!!

Yup I made the 3 to 2.5 hour drive down south to the nerd Mecha. I was indeed a site to behold. <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0942331/"">Dean Wright</a>, our VFX supervior was giving a presentation so I borrowed <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0840493/"">Rpin's</a> (My lead's) Professional ID and hacked my way in. Nerds and nerdettes abounded, there was much flirting and fun. Everyone assumed I was Rpin and I deminded free stuff accordingly. Saw Scott Kurtz of PVP fame and brought loads of junk. Some of which I am wearing right now. Got home last night around 8.45pm in time to watch my new appartment descend into maddess as the other new roommate threw himself a party. I can smell beer soaked into the carpet and I suspect he won't be here much longer as the others are none to happy with him.

Last weekend was spent with Erena and Chris at Disneyland going on rides and getting wet. I was alot of fun and we managed to avoid most of the long waits with the use of Fast Passes which I recommend. I was hoping Erena would do a full write up about it on her blog and I could link to that, as I am a lazy sod. Although I am a jaded 28 year old, my 9 year old self had a great time. Highlights being Space Mountain, Indianna Jones Ride, that Pirates ride and the company of good friends.

I've been working pretty solidly full time and am pretty tired, but seem to have got all the domestic stuff out of the way (social security, bank account, Place to stay etc.) and can start enjoying my time here. I think I shall have to return to San Diego, it seemed like a fun place and people were more relaxed there."

Work is pretty small at the moment, and I'm begining to suspect that part of the reason for my being hired was to help balance out the Call of Duty 2 teams of Previz vs. Everyone else in the office. (mind you, we got schooled at lunch time.)

Right. So nothing really says ""I don't know where I am"" Like big fold up maps. They are great, they fill the drivers side of your right hand drive rental, like a giant, paper air bag. So far LA is a giant grid, the streets go on for miles and provided you are going in the right direction, can take you where you want to go. 

There are shops EVERYWHERE, in fact it's overwhelming how many different stores there are. Everything is low and flat and hot. Nice to be here in summer, the weather is a stark contrast with back home. People seem very focused on what they are doing, although the folks around Venice are pretty relaxed. 

Now all I have to do is, get a bank account, find somewhere to live, apply for a social security number, order my new computer box, assemble it, go shopping, not get mugged or fat (seriously chocolate flavoured pretzels), renew my rental car, work out my cellphone, drive on the right side of the road, get woken up in the middle of the night, get hit on by gay guys at parties and in between all that, get some work done on this movie.

I found a great radio station, this morning they were playing the soundtrack to the new movie Snakes on a Plane. I wonder if we can add snakes to Narnia, or would be getting way too biblical?

I have a place to look at tonight. Hopefully all will go well. Miss everyone already."

"event","Hey all. So this morning the courier dropped off a little bag with my passport in it and an entire page now taken up by my shiney O-1 VISA. Finally. My flight leaves on Wednesday night NZ time and I'm arriving Wednesday afternoon LA time. I have almost everything sorted and can finally start work on Prince Caspian. Feels very strange after all this waiting to know that I'll be working in another country by the end of this week.

For those of you who don't know, my mum has come through her shoulder operation without any complications and is on the slow road to recovery. At least one of the benifits of being around is that I can spend some time with her and take care of her while she is recovering. My uncle Nige is arriving the day after I leave, then Ash comes up to spend some time with her.

Thanks to everyone who came to my going away drinks on Friday at the Chapel Bar in Ponsonby. Edited pictures of the evenings antics can be found <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/gerrard/"">here.</a>"

"event","So I am now doing the dance of the Visa. ""Where was the Alien Born, What is the Alien's address..."" they have a lovely way of making you feel welcome in the US. A tentative start date for me working on Prince Caspian has been set for June 12th or 19th. While that happens, big high powered expensive LA lawyers are trying to convince US immigration that I am a valuable commodity. This involves me pouring through my scrapbook and trying to convince them I'm the next Peter Jackson.

Last night went to see <a href=""http://www.audreyniffenegger.com"">Audrey Niffenegger <a/> talk about her book The Time Traveler's wife. I think I was the only single male in the audience and now I know how a girl feels at a comic convention, except without the BO and the poor chat up lines (Ask Claire). I found Audrey's illustrated book The Three Incestuous Sisters really facinating (NOT because of the title.) while I was in Sydney and brought it. Unfortunatly it's not very travel friendly and is sitting in my lock up in Waterloo.

Weekend. Did the harbour bridge climb with the lovely Sarah. I do recommend it, although climb is a bit of a stretch, more like a leisurely tour with some beams to avoid and a lot of stairs. After lunch on at the Westhaven Marina. I joined Claire and Sarah later in the evening to watch the rugby, or rather attempt to peer through the dense layer of fog surrounding the grounds. It was definitely the best game of Rugby I never saw. We wandered the various haunts of Ponsonby and did a little dance. After the girls went home I ended up in Sponge. I made it back to The Shore wearing someone elses lipstick and with a new number in my phone. So I guess I was on form. Cheers"

"event","Currently in Nelson, after ye olde scenic drive through the Lewis Pass through from Christchurch. A tad warmer here, the highs been about 16-18 degrees, which is a big step up from Christchurch's balmy 12 degrees. I know that's not cold where you people in sunny England are, but none-the-less I fear Sydney my have soften my hardened exterior. (Yeah right)

My cousins are all big now, real big, the youngest Jack who we affectionately nickname the Little Noise Machine now plays for the Nelson Giant's basketball team. <siff> they grow so fast.

Just went out for lunch with Erin's friend Lee Ann, lovely girl and spent a good couple of hours shooting the breeze over drinks. Next planned stop over is Wellington, sometime towards the end of the week or maybe weekend. Need to get onto that now."

"event","Well I can report it's very cold in Christchurch. Dad has the fire going in the background and my belly is full of fish and chips (They really don't do them right in Oz). Flew down on Friday morning to surprise my brother's band who where playing on Friday night. <a href=""http://saintjudetheband.com/""> Saint Jude.</a> It was a battle of the bands, but Ash's main thing was to get their first gig out of the way. It was great to see him play after all this time practicing and preparing?

Went to see an fascinating film this afternoon after catching up with Ash for lunch. <a href=""www.imdb.com/title/tt0365485/"">The Matador</a> Really worth seeing and not what I expected. Catching a bus up to Nelson tomorrow. Be great to see my cousins, family and Uncle Nige. I haven't been there in well over ten years. Then I'm thinking of heading to Wellington, before turning my sights back Auckland."

"event","Well I'm back in NZ. Been back for the past week. Left Animal Logic on good terms and many good friends behind. Had a big leaving bash at The Australian Rose in Erskinville. Staying with mum which is cool. It's her birthday on Wednesday. 

Went away for weekend with Tamara and the crew (Dave, Helen, Claire and Tamara's flatmate Sarah.) Rain on the way up, but skies parted once we were on our way. Lots of fun had Horse Riding up at Pakiri and seeing Mahuia's band <a href=""http://www.exiles.co.nz/"">The Exiles</a> play at the Sawmill. Claire is considering becoming their manager, coordinator and I think fashion consultant.

Stayed the night at the horse riding place. Bucketed down with rain after gig and there was a mad dash from car to cabin lit only by the light of Gerrard's Cellphone. Alas on arriving at said cabin after sheltering under pizza box from the rain, we found out we had the torch which was still in the car. Next day beautiful fine weather, pools of water everywhere.

Country looked beautiful and it felt good to be home.

Still waiting to hear updates from LA, at this stage looks like kick-off sometime in mid to late May. So until then, I keep circling."

Before that was Mr. Cranky pants. Moving, cleaning and selling all my stuff. (Yes Halo is gone!) Even after that I have still ended up with six rubbish bags labeled... clothes and stuff.

Works trying to get me to stay. Still no word yet about start date or start location for Narnia 2. Better get back to it. 8 Days left to go at Animal."

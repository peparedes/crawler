"event","....some person shoots dead one person and critically injures two other people right in front of the intersection that faces my workplace.

The scene that I was greeted with this morning was something out of The Bill, sans dodgy British accents. Loads of cops, helicopters flying overhead, paramedics and the firies. Those of us that were waiting around to be let into work this morning were sent home. 

Pretty screwed up situation. :("

"event","I remember you. How long ago was it? Four years? Maybe five? It seems so long ago that I can't remember. You were still in uni and I was...I was...""interested"". I wanted to meet you but it was just.....just me...nervous and shy. How old were you back then? 19, wasn't it? I was secretly falling head over heels but I couldn't say a word. I mean, who goes around saying ""hi, i like you. wanna meet up over some pricey caffeinated beverage in a classy part (Carlton?) of town?""

The years went by and I stopped using this thing. There was so much to write about but past experiences made me feel so disconnected from this medium. I hung around Hosier Lane with my digital camera, snapping stencil art or walking the streets in search of beauty. A drain here, an old building there. If the footpath beneath my feet could talk, it would no doubt have a million and one stories to tell.

I still thought of you every so often when I was riding the train out to Box Hill. Going past Glenferrie station always seemed to make me smile wryly and I'd lean my head against the window, daydreaming about you.

That was a long time ago and so much has happened since then. Work, music and being a drunken lout on Friday nights makes up much of my life at the moment. My 10 to 6er pays the bills. I haven't hung around Hosier Lane for so long and my digital camera sits in its bag in the corner, wondering when it will be let out to play for a while. I'm fast approaching 30 and with it, I'm a lot more cynical about life. I look back and try to recall those nights we used to msn each other silly and I can't help but smile. If you knew where I was working now, you'd probably spit on me or worse still, diss me to the high hills. If you could talk to me now, you'd notice that the bounce in my voice that was there five years ago has long disappeared. I'm sounding exhausted and husky these days. 

There I was, trawling LJ and there you were. A sparse amount of words, a lone picture. Everything's changed. Or has it.

I remember you. I wonder if you remember me."

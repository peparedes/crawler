"event","HEY YOU ALL!
Summer is so awesome. Last night I went to the Kenney wedding and it was sooo much fun. Unfortunately I had to get up EARLY today to go swim/run. Not fun. I went fishing with my brothers this afternoon and they caught this brown thing.I am not even sure it was a fish, but stuff like that happens all the time. Then I went home and took care of the lawn/pool. Our report cards came today ! I am so relieved that I passed chemistry *sigh *...

oh this thing is so awesome...for me anyway :D

YOUR AGE BY CHOCOLATE MATH
(DON'T CHEAT BY SCROLLING DOWN FIRST!) It takes less than a minute....... Work this out as you read the instructions line by line. It's fun, easy, and you will never believe it when you get the results!!

1. First of all, pick the number of times a week that you would like to have chocolate (more than once but less than 10)...

2. Multiply this number by 2 (just to be bold)...

3. Add 5 (for Sunday)...

4. Multiply it by 50 (I'll wait while you get the calculator.......)

5. If you have already had your birthday this year, add 1755; if you haven't already had your birthday this year, add 1754...

6. Now subtract the four digit year that you were born...

The results should be a three digit number...

The first digit of this three digit number was your original number of times a week that you would like to have chocolate.

The next two numbers are YOUR AGE! (Oh YES, it is!!!!!)

THIS IS THE ONLY YEAR (2005) IT WILL EVER WORK, SO SPREAD IT AROUND WHILE IT LASTS.


(I know, I am easily amused....)"

"event","Thank God school is OVER.
Thursday~Field day was excessively dull; I only stayed for the food and the movie. It wasnt REALLY field day as it was raining outside, so we had to stay inside the whole day. Maria and I left after a while to go shopping and laura decided to stay(don't ask..).After shopping we came home in a horrible storm. I usually like storms, but this one was freaky.The lightning almost struck Maria three (3) times while she was at the computer. I , however, was unaffected and sat motionless in front of the tv because the chemistry test left me deprived of energy.Then the power went out for a while, but not before the lightning almost struck Maria again. I swear, she wins the unlucky girl of the year award.

Friday~ We went to the graduation Mass at Kindred Hospital. The chapel was right next to the labratory which had mulitple biohazard signs surrounding it. Why would you put a labratory right by the chapel? Sheesh.Anyway,Graduation lasted about 3 hours, but it was a very nice ceremony. The food was very delicious except for the nasty punch (haha Ben & Jake). Big murph got his hair hacked off, I didnt even recognize him!=O
Prom was extremely fun, although it didn't seem to last long enough.Ben is such a great guy to take to prom=D Oh, and someone had the gall to show up in an ORANGE shirt. It was a disparaging sight, and an utter travesty of everything good and holy.

Today~ Slept and did NOTHING! I love summer... 
Tonight I am going to a grad.party. Hopefully that utterlygrossfreewillybigmurphbeemer whale won't be there. If he could even fit in the house. Ciao for now.

"event","Okay, today was really wierd. Classical studies was weird. Oh and this morning a certain someone (maria) was approached by the certain someone's sister. Her sister was successful in getting the info, I shouldn't wonder if there will be a big fight about it soon.We didn't do anything in english , other than to read this dweebish play she wrote. Its so gay, and we have to perform it at graduation! I am soo thankful this is our last week of school. Geometry was worthless, I am not looking forward to the final...or any of them. Laura is having her confirmation tonight, so I better go. bye!"

"event","Today was part one of my chemistry test(chp. 1~8)! Only it wasn't. She ended up giving us the multiple choice section of the AP chemistry test, which covers the whole book. Which we didn't study... We all failed miserably. And when I say ''failed'', I mean that the highest score was 19/50, or 38%. Luckily she curved bc a) we werent prepared (duhh) 2) some of it was material we hadnt covered. School was dull except for the part where we went to java and got smoothies. MMmm I lovee mango-strawberry smoothies. Well I need to type 3 pages for my stupid CSIII. 

PS.pools are so annoying"

"event","Today started off okay...just a usual ''yes AND no'' CSIII class.Hilary brought these awesome chocolate covered expresso beans to school, which are the best. And then in study hall Mr.Wheatley raises ticket prices by 9 $...to buy his drugs, for sure.Then a certain someone **coughMARIAcough** was approached by another certain someone. The latter someone was trying to extract information from the former someone, but she failed miserably, I am glad to say. Blah Blah. English was awesome; we got to go to Java! Blended mochas are yummyy. Alison had a mango smoothie, and Ruth drank some kind of chai tea while stressing over chemistry.Not that she shouldnt be stressed, but stressful people make me even more stressed. It's a never ending chain... Anyway, I became really sick in geometry. Fever/stress/sick stomach/headache all sort of rolled up into one. You name it, I had it. I came home and collapsed for about an hour, then dragged myself to the Chemistry Book. Mrs. Christensen's only hint to our final was '' About anything in chapters 1-8 could be on it...'' Like that even HELPS me!UGHUGH"

"event","hello everyone. well, the first week of grad school is in the books. my classes are pretty cool. i have an independent study with a visiting artist, Fred Stonehouse, who is actually quite well known in the art world. his work is pretty cool, so i'm excited to get the chance to work with him. 

yesterday there was a grad student/faculty picnic where we got a chance to mingle with everyone in the department and eat sandwiches. and later that night there was a show opening that one of the professors curated. it was pretty crazy, and lots of fun. after that i went out with some fellow 1st year grad students for a round of beers. probably the best night in Madison since i've moved here.

today however, was not so great. we had a lottery for picking studio spaces, and myself and another guy kind of got the shaft. we were the last 2 to draw - specifically because of a shortage of chips in the lottery bag. so we got stuck in what is mainly considered the worst space on campus. add to that, there's tons of shit still in there from some student who has negligently left her crap in numerous spaces. 

so tomorrow morning i'm going there to try and clear out some of the shit that's in my spot. not looking forward to that. but there may be some help with the whole situation. we'll see..."

"event","hi everyone. i'm coming up for a few days today. i figured now is as good a time to take a break from Madison. i had an interview at the public library so they'll be getting back to me next week. it went well, so hopefully i'll get it. but i thought in the meantime i'd go home and see some friends and family while i can. so far the plan is to stay until tuesday, although that could change, depending on what comes up.

see you soon."

"event","i walked about 15 minutes down to the air conditioned environment of the union. my back is soaked with sweat, since i was carrying my laptop in my backpack. but since i plan on being here the whole afternoon i *should* dry off eventually. you know it's hot when you start sweating right after you get out of the shower. that's always nice. 

so i got a call this weekend from my boss telling me that we're done painting houses for the summer. the last place we were going to paint this week backed out of the contract. so while i won't be getting another week's paycheck, i don't have to work in this hot-ass weather. because today and tomorrow are supposed to be in the 100's. so, i guess that kind of worked out for me. 

yesterday i finally saw X-Men 3 at Madison's budget theater (which is actually pretty nice for a budget theater.) it was good, but it seemed to go by way too quick. they could've filled it up a bit more, but oh well. the ending was interesting, though. along with the scene after the credits. but it made me hope rather than making a 4th movie they make a tv show. there'd be so much more they could do with an hourly tv show than with the standard summer blockbuster every 2 years. i mean, the X-men universe is filled with plenty of characters they could utitilize in the show. okay, i've talked about this too much and i'm feeling really nerdy now.

i'll be moving into my new place later this week and hopefully i'll end up with a job shortly thereafter. i've already applied to the UW libraries and i've gotten a letter from the city library about setting up an interview. once all that is settled i'll probably come up for a visit. hopefully sooner than later."

"event","so yesterday was probably the worst day of work this summer. to start off, we knew it was going to be into the 90's and humid. so that sucked. then we had to scrape old paint off the entirety of the house we were working on. a few spots of which were lead. but screw the spaceman suits because we would've died in those. but whatever.

so after lunch - which we were able to eat in a cool garage - the shit started to happen. first off, i was pretty much soaked through my work clothes. which really makes working uncomfortable, and i got to have a thousand paint chips stick to my sweaty skin. hooray. 

now upon a high ladder, i start to put primer on a gutter when all of a sudden a wasp stings the back of my leg. fuck. so it hurts, but i figure i only have this little spot left so as i reach for it, another goddamn wasp flies around my head and stings me somewhere inside my sideburn. so i pretty much lose it and start swearing up a storm that the whole block could here. so i finally embark down the ladder and - keep in mind, still swearing - walk over to my cooler to put ice blocks on my leg and face. fun. 

when i get back to work i try to move the huge-ass 32-ft extension ladder. i lose control. BAM. hits the ground. by whatever luck i had at that point i avoided hitting the girl i was working next to and the house nextdoor. at least i had that going for me. so after i hoist it up again, i'm trying to raise it up, when i lose control of the rope and it slams down on my foot. oddly enough, it didn't hurt that much. but it's not like it landed on the steel toe of my shoe. it landed on the top part. but no pain. whatever, i'll take it. 

it's now about 4:15ish and i'm in a pretty foul mood. so being that it was humid as all hell, 90-plus degrees, we decide to call it a day early and head home at 4:45. 

so i shower, clean myself up, get dry clothes on. turn my computer on to connect to the internet. i need to check my email to see if anyone has emailed me back on apartments/rooms for rent that are available (by the way, most people are assholes at replying back to at least tell you that no, it isn't available. would it take that much effort to reply?) anyhow, i open IE and nothing. so, i re-start my computer. still nothing. unplug the modem. restart computer. nothing. unplug the modem. restart. again, nothing. finally, i give up. i call Liz and she says hers is out too. so apparently Charter must have had something fuck up in the extreme heat. so i don't even get to entertain myself on the interweb for the evening. 

yes, it was another classic Monday."

"event","helloo everybody. it's been a fairly enjoyable weekend down here in Madison. Friday night Liz and i took in an art show (which was a bit disappointing) and browsed the fine establishment that is <a href=""http://www.b-sidemadison.com/home.html"" target=""_blank"">B-Side</a>. I was looking for the new <a href=""http://thetwilightsingers.com"" target=""_blank"">Twilight Singers</a> album, which they have sold more copies than expected, so I'll have to wait a few days for them to get a new order. Earlier in the day i took a look around Best Buy for said CD and noodled around on about a dozen guitars in Madison's very own Guitar Center. it was extremely tempting to just blow my first two paychecks on the first guitar i saw. I figure at the end of the summer if i have enough money saved up i'd buy a new guitar. the problem is i can't decide on whether to get a <a href=""http://images.misupply.com/products/original/Gibson/gJ200Elite.jpg"" target=""_blank"">Gibson jumbo acoustic</a> ($$$) or a cheaper nylon acoustic ($)....or whether I should get a unique, flashy, original looking guitar or go with something a bit more classic looking like an <a href=""http://www.alternativasmusicales.com/catalog/images/DOT.jpg"" target=""_blank"">Epiphone 360 semi-hollow body</a>. So we'll see what my bank account looks like at the end of the summer.

Back to my weekend, though. Today i played my guitar for a while, went to the mall with Liz, and saw then we saw '<a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0398027/"" target=""_blank"">Down in the Valley</a>' featuring Edward Norton. It was pretty good. Although the twist they put into it sort of breaks it into 2 separate movies. it was cool to see the type of movie I usually have to wait a year for on DVD. Madison's got some nice ""art house"" theaters. I had originally thought I'd go see X-Men 3 this weekend, but after hearing about the disappointment from a few different sources i figured i'd wait on that. 

tomorrow the plan is to go to a family reunion just up the road from me. my mom is coming down for it, and my grandmother, aunt, and uncle will also be there. so i should get a nice visit and a good meal out of it. then i need to go see the <a href=""http://www.artnet.com/artist/17874/john-wilde.html"" target=""_blank"">John Wilde</a> exhibition that's opening tomorrow afternoon at the Chazen. He was a Wisconsin artist, and oddly enough was recommended to my by my painting teacher, Charlie, just before i started my whole ""cowboy"" themed work. So some of his stuff influenced a lot of recent work and i can't wait to see it in person. 

well, i hope everyone is doing well. i've heard from a few of you in the past few days, which is always nice. i'm planning on coming up for a visit around the end of June/beginning of July, so when i figure out something concrete i will be sure to let you all know. 

have a relaxing, lazy Sunday."

"event","hey everyone. so i've been in Madison just about 2 weeks now. things are going well. i'm figuring out where things are slowly but surely. 

painting houses has gone all right so far, about as well as i could hope i guess. we started our first house on a beautiful, clear day and when we finished it, the homeowner gave us a $25 tip. pretty nice. the guy played college football at Brown University. normally i'd be more impressed with him playing college football, but that fact that it was at Brown seemed really impressive. we started a new house today and the guy brought out a cooler filled with pop and bottled water and then went and bought us some sandwiches for lunch. we've gotten a pretty lucky start.

the down side has been working pretty longass days, and then getting rained out so we don't get our 3-day weekend. also, we had to work today - Memorial Day. i was in Illinois from Friday night thru Sunday for my cousin Megan's wedding. i really wanted to stay until today though, as my uncle was having a big cookout. that would've been nice, but...what can you do? 

anyhow, hope everyone back in the EC area is doing well. i'm thinking i'll come back in a couple weeks for the air conditioner i used to have in my room at the old house. it's crazy ass hot up here on the 2nd story. 

adios amigos."

i had borrowed mike's bass for the week and finally decided to use it. i came up with the bass line and had the electronic keyboard play a generic drum beat and recorded those two together. then i plugged some headphones into the keyboard so i could listen to the drum beat to play along with the guitar in the same time frame. it surprisingly worked out well. the hardest part was syncing the two separate tracks together, but it only took a few tries.

and if you <a href=""http://photos.yahoo.com/ntv8"">click here</a> you will find all the work i got done just this past semester. lots of stuff. i'm glad i finally figured out yahoo photos.

i hope everyone i know has a good holiday break, and i'll see you all in the New Year."

"event","i went to the senior show for some classmates of mine tonight. all their work was really good. they brought lots of fancy food. and all of a sudden i felt uncomfortable and out of place. i then realized my own senior show will be five or six months from now. and there will be people looking at my work and seeing what i show as the culmination of my time as an art student. 

and even though i have a lot of time to prepare for it, it really isn't that far away. 

i've become incredibly aware of time."

jose - we had frog eye salad at thanksgiving. other than that it was kinda boring. it did snow though, which was strange to see in illinois first."

"event","my week started out pretty shitty for some reason, and it should've been a sign of things to come. coming home from school on tuesday evening around...6pm or so i was headed down the hill on the North Crossing just before the bridge when i a truck turned right into the side of a tiny, little car in front of me. as i pulled off to the side of the road i started to think, ""what the hell am i gonna do?"" there were already other cars that stopped to help. what's the etiquette for a situation like that? so as i stepped out of my car, i realized ""well, it looks like someone's got it under control.""  there was a guy who had a cell phone out already so i got back in my car and went home.

it wasn't until wednesday morning that i realized ""i was about 3 or 4 seconds away from possible death last night."" if i had been out a little bit further and one lane over i could've gotten slammed into by some moron in a pickup truck. but at that point in the morning i was also thinking ""how the fuck did Bush win?""

boo. boo, i say."

"event","last night i decided to go out by myself and watch some bands play at the Stones Throw. they were okay. the best part of the night was probably talking to one of my sculpture classmates about how pissed off our instructor has been at everyone's assignments.

speaking of which, i worked on my sculpture project a bit today. i've stripped off all the laminate from the top of the table, and most of the paper-like shit on the bottom. i was also able to get off the strip that goes around the circumfrance of the table. all i really need to do now is sand the hell out of it and get it nice and smooth.

i was lucky enough to watch Jon Stewart on CNN's Crossfire yesterday. i've never seen anything so funny as this:

<img src=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/liveonline/images/carlson_tucker_l.jpg"" alt=""""> 
CARLSON: I do think you're more fun on your show. Just my opinion.

STEWART: You know what's interesting, though? You're as big a dick on your show as you are on any show. 

i was laughing my ass off. he also made a crack about him being a 35-yr-old man who wears a bow tie. 

here's the entire <a href=""http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0410/15/cf.01.html"">transcript</a> and a link to a <a href=""http://www.ifilm.com/filmdetail?ifilmid=2652831&htv=12&htv=12"">video</a> of it."

"event","so last week i'd felt a little sick and gone in to the Health Center at Stout. i got some Sulfa to treat my cold/sinus infection/whatever the hell it might've been. i started feeling better. saturday i went out to eat with Justin and the kids and picked up some stuff to work on for my construction project.  but i start feeling kinda shitty when i'm working on my project outside. i quit about an hour into it after feeling completely wiped out and having a massive headache. so the next morning i wake up with hives and a high-ass fever. 102.9 according to the nurse. yup, i was so bad i went to the hospital. i got hooked up to an IV to feed some antibiotics into me and felt a little better. so my fever went down a little, but once i got home i still threw up a few times. this morning i woke up feeling better and only threw up once earlier. so right now the only thing that's really bothering me is the hives. they're a little itchy and at times it feels like i'm being poked. my strength is a little weakened too, but that's no big deal. 

hopefully, this is the end of this fucking sickness though. sunday was the worst i'd felt in about four or five years. i just want to get over this shit and get on back to school to catch up on everything."

that's right, pj harvey. last night was excellent. she must have played for about an hour and a half. lots of good stuff. big exit, meet ze monsta, 50 ft queenie, and a fucked up the letter were some of the highlights. lots of singing along, lots of bobbing up and down and back and forth. it was a rockin' good time. she came out for two encores and ended with Mr Badmouth, if i remember correctly.  

she was wearing a red tube top dress with white seagulls on it, and had some unattached sleeves that she wore for about half the show.  i didn't get a good view of Rob Ellis, which is a shame because he has become one of my favorite drummers. the bass player, dingo, looked like he really enjoyed himself and josh klinghoffer was kickass, too. he played drums on a lot of stuff, and when he and rob were doubling up at the same time it was really fucking good. 

even though i AGAIN had someone taller stand right in front of me it was still probably the best show i've seen. i swear each concert i go to keeps getting better. getting out of Mpls sucked, as mapquest led me to a road that DID NOT merge onto 94 East, but turned around to another oneway street. then i asked some nutjob for directions and he refused...so i drove around until i finally found my way out. 

now i didn't start listening to pj until a few years ago, but i wish i'd started when she first came out. to anyone who hasn't listened to her, i strongly recommend anything she does. 

oh and go see her if she's near you, it's worth it!"

painting is all done with now. i got a B. :/  B's get pretty damn disappointing after getting only that in every class for the past year and a half. meh. but i brought all my work home. i'll take some pic's and probably put them up on my art page within the week."

"event","i saw fahrenheit 9/11 today. it was very, very interesting.  i went in a little skeptical, as it's been over-hyped and i've heard that michael moore wasn't quite balanced in his argument.  but even though it was obviously demeaning to the g.w.b. a lot of it had validity. the ties to the Saudi royal family and the Bin Laden's is just freaky. one of his final points is how sad it is that the country's poorest go to fight for freedom that they barely get to enjoy. 

it's pretty sad, too, with an interview with a woman from his hometown who lost her son in Iraq. there were also some very disturbing images from the war. 

the most laughs obviously came from many of bush's stuttering, stammering speeches. and sure, some of them are taken a bit out of context and were one's i'd seen on the Daily Show. but i've also seen them on CNN. 

i'd like to see any republican or any politician for that matter watch the movie and explain all the findings that Moore has dug up."

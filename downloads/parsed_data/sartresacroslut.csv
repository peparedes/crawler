"event","<font color=""#cc99ff"" size=""1"">i give up. i dont know what to do. i am so lethargic and empty, i dont even motivation to go upstairs to get any food or water or anything. i honestly would love nothing more than to lay in my bed all day until i finally die of thirst or starvation. katie doesnt notice how much our stupid little plan is killing me. she has kendall. kendall and her are in love, or so they say. could fool me, the girl never smiles when she talks about her. i give up. i am done trying to be with katie, she doesnt even care. she doesnt see how much i care about her. im done. i would like to shoot myself in the head, or shoot up so much heroin i die instantly. yes.</font>"

"event","well, i have no idea how to use livejournal except as a plain journal so here goes. i completely give up on trying so hard for everything to work somewhat good. i dont even want perfect, i really dont even want great because i dont believe it can happen. i want it to be good enough for me to deal with. thats all i ask for. right now she wont even talk to me. i didnt do anything wrong, i told her how i feel. she is the one who isnt ready to accept responsibility for her feelings. she is too worried about hurting everyone else but not worried about how she is hurting herself. if she really does feel the same way about me that i feel about her, it is only a matter of time before she cant take being apart from me. and then there is him. he loves me. he truely loves me, but i just dont love him. i like him dont get me wrong, but its not love. i love the idea of him. i love the fact that he loves me, but thats all. and thats not enough. i love her. i want to be with her for the rest of my life. i would give everything i have to be with her. i would sew my body to her body to be with her forever. i would sell my hypothetical soul to be with her. i can live without her, but i wont. i wont."

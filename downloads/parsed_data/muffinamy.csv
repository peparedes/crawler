"event","A friend of mine thinks keeping public journals/logs is all for the writer, not the reader.  I suppose that's true to some degree but I disagree in that anything that is truly personal to me would never end up in a public journal!  Hell no.  I'd only put truly personal things in a SONG   ;-)"

"event","Saw Lost in Translation last night at The Grove - excellent, but rather slow.  Fit the tone of the movie, though - definitely worth a viewing.  Bill Murray is as excellent as the buzz says.  Random thought:  I really hate when people talk about ""films"" instead of movies or flicks - I mean, those people (you know who you are, mostly-industry-people) who, no matter what kind of movie it is, even trashy crapola like the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, still only refer to them as ""films"".  Dunno why it bugs me, just seems so effin' pretentious.  Ah well, we all have our little irritations.  So, go see this ""film"" hehe"

"event","So, the old adage exists for a reason - when you're in a contended/happy romantic relationship, potential dates just seem to come out of the woodwork!  Matter of fact, people (specifically men) I haven't spoken with in forever have suddenly popped up and called me.  Weird.  Makes me wonder how that really works - are we really connected with some sort of energetic/psychic umbilical cord to people with whom we've had sincere interactions in the past?  Yeah, yeah, I know I sound like a dirty hippy(!) but wtf?  I don't have any other explanation for it...  Regardless, it's always nice to feel desired, or at least be thought of with fondness."

"event","Been procrastinating actually using this, thinking ""why would anyone care what I'd put in an online journal?""  But, then again, I read my friends' so, I guess I'll put entries in occasionally after all.

My parents escaped VaBeach on 9/16 just ahead of Hurricane Isabel's arrival.  They came back from Raleigh, NC on Sunday only to find they still didn't have power - the power just came back today, matter-of-fact.  It was nice to talk to them Sunday, though, with them all full of piss and vinegar and loads of scotch with neighbors, apparently.  Party on, Senior Citizens...I forgot their anniversary and my dad's bday, both in the last 2 weeks - what a crappy daughter! Not like I ever buy them anything, but they didn't even get a phone call this time (oopsy)  Ah well, 'least I talked to them about it Sunday when they were all liquored up and in a great mood hehe.

So there it is, then, the first oh-my-god-isn't-my-life-exciting-journal-entry YAAAAhooo"

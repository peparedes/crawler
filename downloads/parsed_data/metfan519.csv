"event","Ok so Homecoming weekend was SOOOO MUCHHHH FUNN!! TONS of drama..but still so much fun. Yea ok so the actual homecoming dance was really good.. of course everyone was drunk and no one even knew who was dancing with who but that made it even bettttter.  Yea so i voted for John Kraine for homecoming king and he won, and then some random girl Erin Roth won queen?? Its probally b/c Becca and Korin's votes were split but w/e it was still goood.  there was some drama between me and the friends there but honestly it was so stupid and i love them so much so yea haha.

So After homecoming we did some massive chinese food eating at Gillians house so that was awsomeeee... but then there was drama deciding on where we should go after that b/c Rob and all of our guy friends were at a Japanese resturant in Nanuet and then RYANNN and the rest of the football team were having a party at this kid Sam's house so i wanted to go there, but that diddn't work out so we just went to robs but OMGGGG his house is GORGEOUS.  He has 10 acres of just like..gorgeousness.  its so funny...we've been like really good freinds since kindergarden and ive never even been to his new house.  His yard, tennis courts, basketball courts, and his pool were like AMAZING.  Seroiusly i felt like i was at a hotel his house is so sick lol.  After that we all piled into cars and slept at Allisons, yet we left Ali Rosenberg and Gillian at robs?!? yea so they had to get a ride back to allisons so that added to the drama, but that wasn't mentioned for the rest of the night so yea that was good. And then of course we all watched our favorite movie MEAN GIRLS which toped of such a fabulous night.  

And in the football game yesterday (shocker we lost... Clarkstown North Football Team 0-7 baby!! haha) Ryan gave me his away jersey to wear, so yea i got to wear that to the game and everyone got to see i was wearing Ry's jersey :)  so cute. and he made the SICKEST interception ever so that was awsome and he pointed to me after he did it so that was even better :) yeaaa he was upset that i coudln't hang out w/ him after and so was i, but he got drunk and called me so it was all fine from there haha

now its time for a birthday party at Batter Up!!! haha i love my job

"event","You know what i just realized... ME AND MY FRIENDS HAVE NO CLUE WHAT WERE DOING AFTER HOMECOMING THIS WEEKEND!!! like...ok we alll know the drama that has occured and now there is no PIMPED OUT PARTY BUS TO WESCHESTER and NO LIMO TO THE CITY..so its pretty depressing.... girls are such bitches its beyond comprehension...

...yea but whatever, its just the fact that it was 35 of us all going to have the sickest night ever, and then people decide to like bail and totaly ruin a completly sick weekend... not to mention i wont have another excuse to show off my ridiculously cute outfit that makes me look skinny :) i told my friends from other schools an towns what me and my freinds were doing..and for some reason they were all in awe... like they all just go to afterparties... but heres the problem with that:

1) its NEW CITY...there are no afterparties here
2) its NEW CITY... when we do party... its extreme, with style

but whatever like honestly... homecomming is just another reason to get in fights with your best friends and call eachother bitches behind everyones backs and pretend to be having a good time with them when homecoming starts.. but by the end of the night be back in love with every single one of them and forget all about everything.  

Ryan isn't going to homecoming... b/c for some reason many of the junior football players aren't going?? i have not a clue why..but hey, at least im invited to the ""party"" they are throwing which will be broken up by the cops in 10 minutes... i love ittt :)

What is with all the tests tomorrow... i have like three and there all massive.  Like honestly..why are my teachers trying to prevent me from going to college.. i really want to know. (although Mattock's Global test today was NOT bad at ALLL) but im going to the mall tonite to get jeans from abercrombie b/c im in desperate need, and some more shoping, and i REALLY want a cute fitted RED SOX shirt just to wear b/c clearly i hate the Yankees... like my friends that are into baseball are like HOW CAN YOU NOT LIKE THE YANKEES...or HOW CAN YOU ROOT AGAINST NEW YORK IF YOU LIVE HERE? ...its easy... im a headstrong Met Fan who loves any team that rivals the Yankees (aka RED SOX) and just dont like them..end of story :)  

time to go study so i can end up somewhere besides RCC..

<3 always, Di


PS!!! IF YOU WATCH THE REDSOX / YANKEE GAME TONITE..LOOK FOR A GUY ON THE REDSOX W/ LONG BROWN HAIR.. HE LOOKS LIKE JESUS!! ITS SO GREAT!!"

JOHNNNNN :) like seroiulsy we go to the bathroom at the exact same time every day hahaa. yea so i was walking and i was like HEY 24 (thats his football number b/c the team wore them to school yesterday for the game) and he was like HEYYYY whos jersey is that?? and i explained and he was like laughing and then we were just talking about the game and i made him laugh a few times so that was goood :) then he left and after 8th period... ryan settler drove me home... hahaha my friends were like flipping out like HES HOT but idk i think he is but idk haha 

so last night... at the North vs. Suffern game i saw my loveeee Arielle Becker and since she's the whore of suffern h/s she introduced me to every single hot guy and that was funn :) it was the funniest thing..she was like ""oh yea..i fucked this guy, i gave head to this guy..."" haha it was sooo great.  Well we clearly lost 28-0 and i saw ryan and john playing (the times i acutally looked over at the game) so that was cute, ryan was reallly mad tho.  yea so after...every one that i was w/ went to this place called the Knoles?? its like this gated community that everyone hangs out in so yea it was kinda sketchy b/c some of the girls that lived there were like ""UM YEA JUST B/C UR FROM NEW CITY DOESN'T MEAN THAT U CAN LIKE BE LOUD AND NOT CARE ABOUT THE PPL THAT ACUTALLY LIVE HERE.."" so yea she was a bitch lol but w/e who cares... and beth h/u with my bffff Alex Greenspan's old camp friend from Summit, this guy named Mike. idk he was pretty cute.. 6'2 (hmm.. my type) and then my friends started pissing me off so much... Gillian and Ali rosneberg are soooooo fucking clicky, like i had no clue where they were the whole night, and Jen was like complaining the WHOLEEEEE TIME...like ""diane can we leave now, diane im bored, ughh im sooo cold, im soooo sick, no one is talking to me, what the fuck why are we here...WAIT UR MOM INS'T COMING FOR ANOTHER 15 MIN?! WTF U SAID SHED BE HERE BY NOW"" like seriously i was gonna smack her..i was liek SERIOUSLY JEN IM SORRY SHE WENT OUT THATS NOT MY FUCKING FAULT and she is such a bitch sometimes i can't take it.  and then i yelled at ali rosenberg for some unknown reason but yea haha, so my good nite turned bad b/c of my friends :( but i was w/ alyssa fliesher most of the time..and i fucking love that girl shes awsome and i was w/ allison gottleibe and arielle too so yea w/e haha. o yea then RANDOMLY adam chaitin, mike kleinberg and craig kolwitz show up in the Knowles when they live in new city w/ me?? idk so weird..they were so high and ughh criag was so annoying..adam i didn't talk to, and mike was like all over me so that was kinda annoying 

yea so then on the way home i sat in the way back of my mom's car away from everone and i cried the whole way home it was HORRIBLE... then chris called me and i told him to call me back... and then i cried more over him b/c i miss being w/ him?? idk for some reason he made me cry, and then Mike Zodda (HIMMM) his fave song from the summer came on and that made me cry even more too... ugh such a weird night... so i get home and i cried to my mom for 10 min and then i called chris.  Its so annoying..like i can't help calling him or liking him b/c hes just like..MY CHRIS and i can't get over him..no matter how hard i try...and even if i wanted to..how could i ever tell him i have a new b/f when me and him talk for hours every nite and tell eachohter how much we miss eachother and how i loveee him so much and i wish we could see eachother more so we could be together.. i did that once b4 to him and i can't do it again.  but i wish i could get over him so i can find a new guy... but i really have no clue what to do.. im gonna make my desicion on whatever i need to decide after homecoming. idk why after homecoming but thats waht im gonna do b/c i can't deal w/ all this confusing shit any more.... but w/e im still happy :)

"event","its 11:33... got home from jen's at like..11:10. i could not be in a more depressed mood right now, and its SOOO WEIRD b/c if ur reading this, you obviously know me, and its ME...diane luisi... happiest girl ever.  Like when am i EVER in a bad moood, like i smile constantly and im always so happy and bouncy and i hate it when ppl are upset and shit, and im like so depressed tonite. I think its all about guys..and i know that sounds retarted but its so fucked up right now and i hate it.  OK so john... SO HOT... but im trying to make him into somehting he's not, or someone i want.  Hes so sweet, but like.. i tell myself hes this AMAZING guy and hes so sweet and nice, but really i have no clue if he is.  When we talk, its about football, or something stupid like guy stuff, and its for a max of like... 20 min.  We walked together to second period, IN COMPLETE SILENCE...i tried talking but it didnt' work.  And i have no clue how he feels b/c either 1) i never get to the chance to ask him   2) when i get the chance, im scared and i dont do it.  I want a guy whos amazingly nice and will be a great b/f...whos wierd like me and will get my humor and my stupid comments and retarted jokes, and who will apreciate me.  Not a guy who cares about getting ass everytime we see eachother and isn't into being FREINDS.  I want a b/f who can be my best friend and we can hang out and have fun.  clearly John isn't interested b/c if he hasn't done anything aobut me liking him by now..theres no point.  And then theres Bon... one of the sweetest and funniest and best guys ever... like he says the funniest stuff and the most random stuff too and its so great, but yea we never see eachother. i want a b/f i can see, not ones that i have to try and break plans w/ just to see once a week (hmm... i NEVER did that one before...). i want a cute guy...its so annoying... i feel like one of those girls who always needs a guy, and yea right now im sounding like it, but hey thats just me and im gonna have to deal. ANYWAY... yea guess who's home...HIM. HE's home... but clearly he wont come see me, and he doens't have to.  Thats not his responsibility... but sometimes i wish i never even started talking to him.  Like.. i love it, i mean obv, its HIM.. but like... i miss him so much and like... i know he just says the things he does to hummor me and make me think like i have a chance, when i know i dont.  I say nice things b/c to HIM b/c i mean it, and he seems to like it... but then when i didn't say something super nice about HIM for like 2 days, he like asked me about it.. i mean i do it to make him happy but i dont think that i need to say it all the time ... he knows how i feel and it wont change.  I just miss him so much, and when HE comes home i get so excited, and then i realize hes not coming home for me and i try to forget but its too hard.  I wish it could work. w/e. u know what i realized too... i love chris. like im in love with him, but i dont like him.  fucked up, i know.  u can't like someone like him, its too hard, u wont get what u want.  but i love him way too much to forget about him.  Looking past all the shity stuff that i hate about him, i really do think hes an amazing person. I cry when i think about him.  So much shit went on in our relationship, and half the time consisted of me crying at the computer or on the fone or to beth at like 12:30 at night, but i loved every aspect of him still... he could have came in my house and took Molly away (that wuold be HORRIBLE) and i still would have no way of hatting him.  but i hate so many things about him.  Like how he makes me jelous on purpose. and how he acts like he can get so many other girls and thinks nothing of it. i dont even belive him most of the time, but it still hurts.  I hate how we never just really sat down and laughed and like..had a good time w/ out hooking up. i mean im sure we did but i just dont remember it... and that sucks.  We dind't really have inside jokes that he liked, like id do somehting that he'd hate, and id do it on purpose all the time just cuase it was funny how he reacted, but that wasn't fun.  all this stupid shit and i still love him. or.. i love him when im talking to him, or about him, or when someone brings him up. IDK ITS SO FUCKED UP... I HAVE NO CLUE WHATS GOING ON!!!!  i just want a good guy to like...take me out places and not care to kiss me in front of his friends and to give me a hug for no reason, and to be happy to be w/ me..and to make me laugh and laugh at me and think im funny and a great person...and to watch football w/ me and not care that i watch sportscenter.. hahaha just reading all this is making me laugh... getting out of my DEPRESSED mood...dont worry u wont see one of these depressed things for a while..or at least till i get my period haha... LOOK IM LAUGHING...getting back to normal haha nite nite <3

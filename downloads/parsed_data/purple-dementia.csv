<center><lj-cut text=""cut for size"">wtf they put in a link to my stupid info then took it out. wut the hell is wrong wit these ppl?!?!?! ahhhhhhh ok anyway. shit sux an i havent dun anything lately... i had 2 jobb interviews, both at 2 different mcdonalds... =/ ima b stuck workin at mcdonalds for the rest of my life. anyway... my parents think theyre gunna find shit out about me by lookin at my journal... mwahahaha nikkas good luck cuz im makin this friends only.. this will be the last and only entry u will read that will not be friends only so take wut i say and implant it into ur heads and never look here again cuz this will be the only thing ur eyes will b able to read! if u dont know me by now, u will never know me. as much as u think u know me and u think u kno wut goes on in my FUCKED up head, your wrong. u hav ALWAYS been wrong. and neither one of u can deal with the fact that after 18 years you still dont know who ur only daughter is.  i know that neither one of u are ever there for me and whether u kno it or not, it fuckin hurts. the only time u ever gave a shit about me wuz wen i wuz doin sumthin wrong. so u can yell and bitch an wutever else u do... and juss tell me u were right and i wuz wrong. well u kno wut?? fuck that. im done bein treated like shit by ppl who dont giv a fuck about me and they only pretend to care in front of other ppl. both of my parents either got or r getting married in different states and in return, i could not and can not attend either of them. not like i want to be there or anything. well at least my dad told me he wuz getting married. my mom has yet to inform me. well i hav another thing to say... in less than 4 months, i will be 18 and on my own... i will hav a license, a car, and hopefully an apartment. and since neither one of u giv a fuck about seein me now, u will never hav to worry about seein me after january 21, 2005. if u dont want anything to do with me then fine. i rlly dont care. juss stop tryin to check up on me an stop tryin to figure me out cuz it aint guna happen. NO ONE can figure me out. i dont even kno me so how the fuck do u expect to?? anyways... im done and from now on anything i write in here is friends only... so comment if u wanna be added... and to my parents... if u wanna kno sumthin about me... fucking ask me dont go snoopin around my shit. and if u DO decide to ask me about sumthin, i will be the one to decide whether or not u will get an answer. so this is the end... comment to be added</center>"

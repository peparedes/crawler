Past months have been complete Arashi-world hahahha... nothing new in that. This month has bee&nbsp; nice though Anime Evolution was last weekend *_________* so awesome~~ i haven't and that much fun in a while xD I was staff as always and boo no cosplay this year Dx I did get a Yukata ( as b-day present) I wore so it was still good :D .. This year I manage to embarrass&nbsp; myself&nbsp; hahahah I participated in anime's best dance crew.. yeah.. why.. I blame Rukia-chan ;;&gt;.&gt; lol oh well it was fun nonetheless.. but if that was not enough I went to Anime Idol auditions on an impulse and guess what??? I forgot the lyrics hahahahahahah oh well still it was fun... but no surprise I was not there for any more rounds hahahha but still i enjoyed it xp.. AE was so much fun :D and to top it Monday after was my b-day yatta \(^^)/&nbsp; so they got me a cake on Sunday at AE and i got another one at home on Monday *__________* so yummy and fun~~

Other than that not much new.. new LJ layout and yes it's Arashi &lt;3 Aiba Masaki ^^.. not my best work but good enough for my lack of photoshop practice =/

Currently alive in Venezuela hahahaha just until sunday...

What can I say?? coming back is nice.. but it feels so different from before.. i might say, even a bit sad... Now that my mom and dad moved to the US and we come to stay in my auntie's house it feels more like i'm a tourist now... hahahah i even got laughed at when i was taking public trasportation =_= by my mom... yeah i look THAT lost here... The saddest part is my dog Lizi ;_; i think she is deaf now....shows no reaction what so ever when ppl call her.... plus she looks weak and even kind of sick... I should have expected it.. she is almost 12 years old.. but she looked fine last year.. now she is even loosing her teeth ;_;&nbsp; It really worries me :( .. at least Suki still looks fine a bit skinny but sweet as always..

On the bright side my family still looks good.. even on the decaying situation of our country my family still seems to hang on, the young ones growing so fast, the old ones looking the same,, a bit crazier some of them.. but still fine i guess...

Though I'm happy to see my family and eating all the venezuelan food i've been missing out on.. coming here always makes me come to the same sad realization, I can't live here anymore.. -.-

oh well... i think this i'm alive msg is depressing so far hahahahha ^^;;;;;;;

About th rest of my life well in august hopefully i'll be able to apply for rescidency :D, and my current job is ok... my parents have a house in Houston and it's so pretty i wanna visit them there soon :3.. My sis graduated&nbsp; last friday, the party was fun even when i was weainf very very high heels hahahah :D

Current obssesions not many.. Books: a lof of Meg Cabot ^^;;;; embarasing truth. Best book in a while though was The Hunger Games, I highly recomend it to those that like teen books xD.. and the latest not bad either was the mortal instruments series by Cassandra Clare which i'm currently reading. Tv wise... not much.. other than every Arashi show that comes my way hahahah yup suffering a very high Arashi fever hahahha. Lots of asian dramas as always.. weirdly enough not watching much anime... sad... but i ahve no idea what's good that's new.. only watching Axis Powers Hetalia.. why? cause it's so weird and random... I wonder if Venezuela will ever show up hahahahah I highly doubt it..

I don;t really need to go but i think my ramble is kind of boring kind of pointles by now hahahah

hm.. other things lately... living alone with my sis is not easy .. she just wants to do whatever she likes and i have to be the one scolding her.. and I personally hate it but what else can i do if it affects me what she does... =_=;;;.. other than that things are ok... still getting a little sick lately =_= weird.. and awfully annoying ... on the family well everyone is doing fine it seems... as always it's growing .. Turns out I have a 17 years-old cousin we never knew about lol so soap-opera like... but he seems like a pretty cool/nice kid ^^ My dogs.. well Lizi and Suki are the only ones left at home.. &gt;w&lt;..Lizi looks the same.. honestly I wonder if she took some anti-aging potion ;;&gt;.&gt; turning 11 soon and still as annoying and loud as always lol.. Suki.. she is a sweetheart , thus her name, but she is pretty dumb =/.... *how mean*...

I should take some pictures...

I had been thinking about making a BP background for such a long time!! but considering i only have scans of the manga covers .. well there was not a lot of choice.. xp I still like the final result.. though the full body pics the have weird expressions.. the closeups are way nicer <3...

Now that I'm talking about this ... when i was making this look i realized smth.. I always use very similar colors O.o.. last look (TRC) was the same yellow/turquoise/bright pink/green/red.. now is the same minus the red.. and i used to have one with same colors +electric blue/purple for Ouran... the weirdest thing is i don't really like bright colors ;;>.>.. maybe I'm just going insane.....

"event","hello there ... *just posted hello ;;;&gt;.&gt; so this is an edit lol*.. hm... Well my plan was to write for a little longer... lately i've been way to lazy to post.. and kinda busy/tired/sick&nbsp; X_x.....&nbsp; i really need to get&nbsp; more studious&nbsp; this semester if i want it to be my last semester at here...though i would still need the field school one ._.&nbsp; so i NEED to study to do WELL on french and not well fail.. or loos the possibility of french proficiency... =.= gambatte me...<br /><br />ok the rest of my life .. not much... seen a couple of ppl from the latin american club ^__^ always nice to see them they are sooo nice and friendly.. sadly i only see them at club days ;;&gt;.&gt; ... <strike>cause i'm no social...</strike> because i don't have a chance to go to the <strike>parties</strike> meetings they organize ^^U.. still nice to see them and talk to them ^^.. <br /><br />This semeter clases... French 301.. scary.. LOTS of writting.. in french T^T... French230.. sounds interesting.. and still on my level.. kinda.. probably the class i'll like the most by the end of semester.. Engl 327.. sounds fun.. like the period &lt;3.. but the class seems like group therapy once in a while O.o;;; yeah... <strike>(maybe it's because i've never been in group therapy).</strike>..and Engl 359.. sounds.. ^^;;;;;;;; a bit boring.. mainly because it's a 4 hour class on fridays Dx... oh well.. some thing will be fun..<strike> or terrifiying.</strike>.. like the creative project...<br /><br />On the anime/drama/manga side... anime same as before D.gray-man, death note, saiunkoku monogatari, yamato nadeshiko shishihegen, nadja(but it's been stuck forever).. i think that's all o.o;; sadness .. (plus taking too long to translate them ;_;.. can't blame them though).. manga.. same as before.. though i'm missing to update like half ;;&gt;.&gt; fav: Tsubasa, xxxholic and Kobato still &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3.. dramas.. well i've been dl LOTS xD.. latest.. hana kimi, hana yori dango 2 &lt;3 &lt;3, it staterd with a kiss (i decided to finish dl it after soooo long ._.) gokusen 2 .. that finished a little bit ago, smiling pasta (about to finish) and goong S.. seens less good than last season.. but stil going to watch it ^^;;;.. i think that's all.. in other.. i dl a couple of movies &lt;3 soo fun.. on top of my mind densha otoko =3 so fun.. kinda liked it better than drama ^^;;( was a bitt too long for me).. and for some reason it amused me they made guy cuter.. and girl uglier in movie.. compared to drama =p *hides*.. oh YEAH and my fav movie i dl lately was Lovely complex .. ZOMG i read the manga .. and i luff it &lt;3 ,,, but the movie was sooo cute and funny.. i watched it 2 days in a row ^^u it was cute.. and the cast.. kinda look like manga characters lol... oh well .. other movie..*thinks* oh.. Blue spring (aoi haru).. iono... that one was ok... very artsy.. and very emo ^^u.. and for some reason i think it gave me nightmares O.o;;; (never had nightmares because of movie..) but i'm probably wrong.. probably got that impresion because&nbsp; i slept bad cause i was sick.. (had fever on monday ;_;)<br /><br />all for now.. time to run and read stuff for my class in..... 10 mins O_O.. shoot... *runs*"

On the 3rd and 4th we went on a trip to the beach.. it was not so good.. we had to go too far and we didn't have that much on the beach plus we went all around cause my dear family wanted to eat lobters ;;;;;;&gt;.&gt; but it was not the season... so after the whole back and forth.. it was useless.... and they ate fish =p 
&nbsp;
On the 5th i basicaly stayed home and packed... lots of ppl at home.. and i watched Howl's Moving castle.. it was fun =3... the 6th was all traveling back ~_~ long trip as always but at least we got here on time and&nbsp; with all our bags ^^..&nbsp; and sunday to rest/buy food... (wow.. scary things can come out of your fridge after 2 weeks ;;&gt;.&gt;)

Today.. First day of class .. yippei =_=;;; i bought my books... but maybe i came too early ;;&gt;.&gt; now i have to wait for another hour before my one and only class today =/ but at least i bought all my books (oh my pocket Dx... well my dad's).. and i saw smone i knew on the line up ^__^

Liz is the same &lt;3 &lt;3 cute as always... maybe less energetic considering she has to deal with the 2 little demons ... oh yeah they break/tear/bite everything they can find and annoy poor Liz non-stop ^^;;;;;;

My family is ok.. granma made Hallacas yesterday .. they were awesome *______________*... oh and yesterday was the Xmas dinner with the ppl of my highschool &lt;3 that was fun and food was awesome &lt;3 i got to see ppl i only see once a year.. ^^

"event","yey i finally got a new look for my lj <3 i was wanting to change my ""a hundred years of snow one"" because i made it for halloween ^^;; not xmas though it kinda worked too its a story related to.. well winter.. and snow.. but still .. a vampire pic for xmas feels a bit weird ^^;;

So i made this one ^^ the pic is from Hanakimi ^^.. i never would have expected to make a Hanakimi look for lj.. but the pic is very pretty and then again i need pics easy to edit because i only have paint ;;>.>   and it ended up lovely... in my opinion ^^;

now.. back to making dinner .. (yup at 10:50pm ;;;;;;;>.>)"

<lj-embed id=""7""/>

""Rock DJ"", Robbie Williams. Listen, I didn't say I was going to do these consecutively, alright? Anyway, this song reminds me of Cami. To be honest, I kind of forget why it reminds me of Cami. For some reason that is pretty vague in my memory, this is our theme song. And really, why shouldn't it be? The music video features Robbie Williams stripping down to his skeleton, and if that doesn't encapsulate everything that makes Cami Woodruff who she is, I don't know what does.

Interestingly enough, I have never listened to any other Robbie Williams song. As far as I'm concerned, this song comprises his entire body of work.

And now there's a 30 Day TV meme I want to do. Goddamnit. Maybe after this one. Or during. I really have a lot of free time this summer."

<lj-embed id=""6""/>

""The Happy Birthday Song"" by Andrew Bird. Quite possibly one of the saddest songs to have the word ""happy"" in the title. It's about birthdays, yes, but it's about the point in your life when your birthday stops being something to celebrate and starts being just another day and just another reminder that you're getting older. That first minute, where he's just going through the motions his daily routine, is just so mindless and depressing. And the talk of ""it's going to be your last day"" is such a morbid thought, but something that absolutely goes through your head on your birthday. 

The whole song is about him wanting someone to sing him Happy Birthday, but he sounds as if he finds so little comfort in that, and it's as if he wants to hear it for no other reason than that's just what you do on your birthday. 

Also, ignore the stupid picture the guy used for the video. It kind of kills the mood."

<lj-embed id=""5""/>

""The Best Day Ever"" by Spongebob Squarepants. If this song doesn't at the very least put a smile on your face, you may just be a goddamn robot. Seriously, I don't even like Spongebob Squarepants, but that doesn't stop me from appreciating the line ""Spent the last two hours just tying my shoe"" for being the work of lyrical genius that it is."

<lj-embed id=""4""/>

""In The Air Tonight"" by Phil Collins. I actually thought this was the only Phil Collins song I liked, which is probably due in no small part to <i>The Hangover</i>, but listening to the whole song made me realize this was the one I despised the most. I can't even rationally explain my dislike for the song, because for whatever reason it just makes my skin crawl. It's just so slow and synthesized and miserable that I can't make it through the whole thing without wanting to claw my ears off."

"event","I saw <lj user=""vanetian"" /> doing this and am too much of a music snob not to do it myself. So if you have both of us as friends, now you have two assholes posting YouTube videos of songs. 

I know it's kind of weird to not post anything for roughly seven months only to come back and do 30 days of a meme, but I think it's obvious this journal has long ago become less about me seriously discussing the details of my life and has become more a product of my absurd, flippant whims.

<b>Day 1 - Your Favorite Song</b>

<lj-embed id=""3""/>

""Styrofoam Boots/It's All Nice on Ice (Alright)"" by Modest Mouse. If anything, this song serves as a decent summation of my musical tastes. The term ""acquired taste"" comes to mind, because Isaac Brock does not have a voice most would consider pleasing to the ear, but it absolutely fits Modest Mouse's music. And the music is really what this song is about, seeing as how the majority of the vocals are simply Brock yelling variations of ""It's all nice on ice, alright"". I don't have the musical knowledge to adequately describe the sound and the instruments, but I do know that those last few minutes are beautiful and tense, and Jeremiah Green goes at the drums like a man possessed. I also dig the lyrics, as I always interpreted them as Brock, an admitted atheist, accepting the possibility that a higher power does exist, but that it's just this completely selfish, apathetic entity. 

I used to always try and make this the last song I listened to when I was coming home from a long trip, because it's the closing track on ""The Lonesome Crowded West"" and makes for such a good closing song in general."

"event","I met a girl. 

<lj-cut text=""MY PENIS WAH""> Like, <i>met</i> a girl. You know, the romantic sort of met.

So, I met Kat. The girl. And proceeded to fuck things up grandly, as I am prone to do. And it's so insanely frustrating that it's the first (pretty, funny, intellectually stimulating) girl to show an honest-to-god interest to me FROM MY STATE (!) and I just... froze. Panicked. And it's such a goddamn representation of how I handle every other  social situation I find myself in, which is to say I don't handle it at all.

Kat's in my English class, and she's the sort of girl who I usually spend months pining after without ever approaching. However, she found me through Facebook (lolz, welcome to college) and I decided to talk to her the only way I knew how; over the internet. After a few back-and-forths we finally get to talking over AIM, and I find myself having an emotionally fulfilling conversation with someone from this school for the first time ever.  And much to my surprise, she starts flirting with me. I'm talking high school puppy dog shit. Blushing, double entendres, endless fawning. And it's mutual! And it ends up translating pretty well over to real life when I finally get a chance to talk to her after class one day.

We only talk for a couple of minutes, but I had picked her up one of those microwavable bowls of chicken soup after she told me she'd been feeling sick as of late, so needless to say she was smitten. And I'm feeling like the smoothest motherfucker on campus, and for the first time actually feeling validated. Which turned out to be founded, as she invited me over to her apartment later that night to watch a movie.

I drive over with speed I was previously unaware my car was capable of reaching, because it's 2AM and a pretty girl has invited me over to her apartment. The laws of physics are no match for my sheer desperation. We spend the night sitting on the couch, growing increasingly tired and increasingly closer, barely paying any attention to the movie and talking the entire time. I am thankfully too out of it for my brain to comprehend the impracticality of the situation. After two hours, I began sensing a desire to get intimate. This was based upon the fact that our faces ended up right against each other's and a sort of gut feeling. It isn't long before we begin to kiss, and for the first time since 9th grade or so I am making out with a girl.

... a fact that becomes glaringly obvious to her. She asks me if this is my first time doing something like this, to which I immediately reply, 'Yes.' Though it isn't really me who answers, it's the eight-year-old child inside me screaming 'WHAT DO YOU THINK?' So, for a couple of minutes I'm still running under the assumption that mouth + tongue = SUCCESS, but I'm getting the feeling that the equation might be slightly off because she keeps telling me to relax. Under the circumstances, ie another person's tongue being shoved down my throat, I'm not sure that is a possibility. Then she starts waxing zen about making out.

""Sometimes it's not about doing, but feeling.""

Lacking a pen, paper, and a book on proverbs, I have no fucking clue what she's talking about. So after a solid five minutes of the most awkward mouth mashing ever we stop. She proceeded to tell me she was really tired and promptly accompanied me on my walk back to the car. We shared a brief kiss goodbye and I left to suffer through the five stages of grief during the fifteen minute ride back to my dorm.

I texted her an apology the next morning, but by then things have already taken a turn for the worst. In my head, at least. She tells me it's fine, but after a few sparse conversations and the cancellation of the plans we had made for Friday, I decide the most obvious course of action in our relationship is to avoid her at any and all costs.

I haven't talked to her in a week, and I feel like such an utter jackass. I just don't even know where to approach the situation from, and by the looks of things she's already moved on. It's not even the fact that I fucked up a potential romantic relationship, it's the fact that I can't even salvage a friendship out of it. She is one of the most interesting people I've met here, and I feel terrible for so utterly screwing things up. I don't know why I always move so fast with these things. It feels as if I've let my only chance at a true friendship slip through my fingers, and I'm exactly back where I started.</lj-cut>"

"event","Prom was: Fun! Despite my intense, serious doubting prior to it. The following things took place and are documented here for me to pull up when I'm old, lonely, and trying desperately to remember the days when the doves of youth sang ever so sweetly.

<lj-cut text=""Comprehensive List of Going-ons at Prom"">
- Caitlin Roberts asked me to go with her, and I practically jumped at the opportunity.
 
- My entire family and Caitlin's mom and Grammy lined-up in a row to take pictures of us. I'm sure half of those pictures are of me looking like a deer in headlights.

- I had to repeat everything I said for the first half of the night, because I was mumbling too softly to be heard above the blaring music that accompanied us wherever we went.

- It took place at the Sheraton in Philadelphia which, incidentally, was the same hotel as AnthroCon 05'. There were a lot less furries, and a lot less frightened bystanders.

- Sarah said I cleaned up nicely.

- Tiffany's boyfriend looked like a Japanese pop-star. Or yakuza.

- Cocktail hour was weird. It sort of felt like mingling at a wedding. We totally had polite, adult dinner conversations.

- Caitlin loved her corsage. Like, <i>loved</i> her corsage. It made me happy to have done something right for her.

- We danced. We danced all night long. Seriously, we tore up the dance floor while looking like the whitest couple in the room, an impressive feat considering our school is full of rich, white teenagers.

- One of those circles formed where people go into the middle and bust a move. Caitlin tried to push me in, but there were a few people (thankfully) blocking the way.

- First time I ever rode in a limo! It was nice, especially on the way back when we were listening to John Coltrane while Brian Dempsey told us a story about some college party he went to where two kids were trying to kill each other.

- Corey grabbed my ass while I was dancing. After the last song was over, I called him a bitch for not having asked me to prom.

- Caitlin and I kissed each other on the cheek, because the DJ told everyone to do it.

- The theater kids asked to do the Time Warp, but were booed off the stage three-quarters of the way through the song. I was (not so) secretly singing along.

- Caitlin kept asking to see the back of people's dresses, because it was the only ice-breaker she knew.

- The fire alarm went off, which obliged everyone to start singing ""The Roof is on Fire"". It's possible that it actually was.

- We got into Andrew's party, which involved Andrea, Sharon, Pat, JT, and Brendon. We sort of asked to come, but we really didn't want to go home.

- The party wasn't exactly exciting, per se. It was supervised, so all we really did was play videogames and watch a movie. It was the best we could do, cause neither of us really belonged to any particular social group.

- I rocked Caitlin out at Guitar Hero, but she plays real guitar, so I guess she technically won by default.

- We watched Tokyo Drift, which was.. just what you'd expect from a movie about drift racing in Japan.

- There was a character named Morimoto in the movie. Andrea grinned at me when I squealed out ""Iron Chef!"" I explained to her that I actually hated Morimoto, because he was nowhere near as hardcxre as Sakai and Kenichi.

- I slept for roughly three hours, though I kept slipping in and out of consciousness.

- In the morning, JT was totally having a conversation with Andrew's parents, as if he were an old business partner or something. It was hilariously adorable.

- We all played Mario Kart on our DS's in the morning. I annoyed the hell out of everyone by singing the invincible music every time I got a star, because we all had the sound turned off. Everyone started doing it after me. Trend setter!

- I dropped Caitlin off at around 11:30 or so, then came home and took a five hour nap.

- Caitlin surprised me. I was really dreading prom, because we never really could manage a conversation with each other. But by the end of the night we had no trouble at all with talking to one another. She's the reason I went, the reason I danced, and the reason I had a lot of fun. I'm entirely grateful.

- Prom, overall, was great.

- As great as it was, Cami still owes me a second prom at AC. <3 </lj-cut>"

Otakon was a lot of fun, probably the most fun I've had since Anthrocon last year. Convention wise, it's a lot more fun than Anthrocon, but socially it wasn't as nice without our entire group being there. But we stayed with some really nice people and we still had a good time.

I actually bought stuff! Manga and comic books! And a Kiba keychain! And a kunai, because Naruto and various ninja crap made up about 50% of all merchandise!

Lani and I sat in on a lot of crappy anime shows. We saw Power Puff Girls Z, which was absolutely terrible. We saw some show where two kids had to save all the fairies so they could make flowers for the world, which reminded me why I hate Japanese people.

Some other shit happened, but I'm not about to recount it all.

A) Go on the senior trip with my fellow peers and visit Disney World for the first time in your life, although the majority of my friends are not going on it and I'd probably have to find a group of kids I'm only slightly acquainted with to leech off of.

B) Ask my parents to put the money toward a new computer, despite the fact the computer has long been a social crutch for me and a new one would probably result in only further distancing me from any attempts at enjoying my teenage years (ie, World of Warcraft).

C) Don't spend any amount of money because there are kids who can't afford shoes in third world countries while your only economic concern is which overpriced endeavor you want to put your parent's hard earned money into, you selfish fucking prick."

"event","My Health teacher Mr. Cuozzi recently gave my class a very thought provoking assignment. He asked us to look deep into ourselves and think about what we'd do if we found out we only had several months to live after contracting AIDS. Many of my peers wrote about achieving lifelong ambitions, fulfilling childhood dreams, sharing their last days with family and friends. After contemplating the topic for a day or two I think I've found the answer that best suits me.

<lj-cut text=""If I had AIDS..."">If I found out that I only had three months to live after contracting AIDS, I'd most definitely create a time machine to go back in time and stop myself from sticking it into that hooker. [See Diagrams 1 and 2]

I'd go back in time and kill the hooker, which would probably only result in one or two stars, which I could easily escape. But, in doing so, I'd create some sort of time-space rift, which would cause Biff to become my stepfather in the future where he controls a gambling empire after acquiring a fortune from using the Sports Almanac 2015 that old Biff gave him. [See Diagram 3]

I'd then be forced to travel back in time trying to set things right. I'd no doubt have a variety of wacky adventures and crazy capers throughout the world's history and future. I could stop the assassination of Abraham Lincoln and do a musical number with John Wilks Booth. I could foil Adolph Hitler and his race of Jew-hating super robots. I'd meet a host of crazy, smart-mouthed sidekicks ranging from a seductive Russian spy in the Cold War to a Time Fairy named Twink. [See Diagrams 4 and 5]

"event","I've found myself in a rather peculiar position. That is to say I've found myself in a completely normal social situation, which is perhaps why I'd consider it peculiar. You see, I had the unfortunate fate of being placed in a lunch where the only other juniors came from the European Studies class I have the period before. This left me with very little options in the way of seating, as I wasn't particular friendly with any of my fellow students. I require a middle man if I'm to create any new friends. A person I'm already on close terms with who will allow me to leech on to them until I'm ready to break off and situate myself with their group of friends. Unfortunately, the only person I was even on an acquaintance level with was a nerd who sat with other nerds.

Now, don't get the wrong idea here. I don't mean 'nerds' in the affectionate sense. These aren't your 'cool nerds'. These aren't the nerds that I'm actually proud to consider my friends. These are your true-blooded, pasty faced, video game playin', anime critiquing, fantasy lovin', wheezing nerds. The only topic that would ever circulate the four of us revolved around either video games or anime. Sure, I'm a fan of video games. Hell, you may even consider me a gamer, but let's get one thing straight: I do not like to talk obsessively about video games because of what it does to my self-esteem. Talking about it for a prolonged period of time reminds me of the sad fact that it's one of the only things I do with my free time.

So, deciding to stay within my social comfort zone rather than risk a venture outside it, I doomed myself to this fate. I spent the majority of lunch in silence, shooting contemptuous looks at those tables around me that bubbled with the conversation of normal teenagers.

However, European Studies afforded me an atmosphere in which I could come out of my shell a little. Debates and roleplays allowed me a chance to garner a few laughs from my classmates, which I always enjoy. I was beginning to adjust to my surroundings and getting to know new people. My efforts at social grace eventually paid off, as last week my partner in a European monarch project invited me to sit at her table for lunch.

That's right, <i>her</i>. A <i>girl</i>. She has a <i>vagina</i>.

So, now I sit with a group of people I enjoy sitting with. Normal teenagers who like to make jokes and laugh and sometimes even gossip. The funny thing is, it seems to be a page right out of an after school special. I betray my original group to hang out with a more 'popular' group. I suppose they'd eventually offer me drugs and I'd learn that popularity isn't all it's cracked up to be, thereby being forced to return to my former friends severely humbled, but that's not the case. I never liked those kids. I never had any loyalty to them. I've merely upgraded my status in the social hierarchy. 

I'd like to end the story there, but unfortunately one of the people from my original table has decided to come follow me to this table, a table that he surely does not belong sitting at. Listen here, fatty. This ain't no free ride on the popularity train. I'm not you one-way ticket to a conversation with a girl. I had to work to get where I am now. I'm not going to let your greasy ass screw things up for me, or so help me God I will do everything in my power to awkwardly suggest that I do not want you sitting next to me.

I knew my social flower would bloom eventually."

I dug up my very first journal entry, which seems to build the foundation for years of humiliation, torment, and sexual frustration.

<lj-cut text=""Let's take a look, shall we?""> Greetings! Welcome to the first of many long, annoying, big and blotchy journal entries!

::hears people leave::

Eh, I mean every entry comes with its own free hooker.

::people come back::

Anyway, I, as you guessed, am the infamous Popkin. Creator of such characters as Lil' Devil, future MAD employee, and pr0n lover. Well, enough with the welcoming and on with the day!

It started out like anyother day (mainly because it was just any other day). School was hard to concentrate on because the new-line up for Toonopolis (www.toonopolis.tv/) was out. 

What is Toonopolis you ask? It's a wonderful e-fed that has to do with toons, and I handle two people from the roster. You're also probably wondering what the line-up means. First off it means the floodgates of my mind open and ideas pour out like crazy. This episode is especially important, since my cheif character (Lil' Devil) is out for the Slapstick shot. I lost this shot one time when I was a rookie. This time around it'll be different.

On with the day... again! After a long painful day at school, I returned home to check out my favirote IRC channel, #farmboy. Jen and ShirtGuyLom were in there, and we soon found out Jen had a pic of her ass.

You'd be exicted too, lemme tell ya. Anyway, she only said we could get it if we both joined up for livejournal. I got a nifty code and here I am! And I'm waiting for the butt pic. Yep.

::taps foot:: I should come on later tonight with another post. With some more on Toonopolis, and the pic. Maybe if my girlfriend comes on I'll have something to say about that too. Till then, make comments. Lots of comments.

The Decemberists - Leslie Anne Lavine: Not exactly the best Decemberists song, but definately the most poignant. Everything about it has this subtle sadness to it that reflects the lyrics so well. I find myself singing the first verse a lot whenever it pops into my head.

Neutral Milk Hotel - Oh, Comely: Brilliant. The most captivating lyrics I've ever heard in a song. Those, mixed with how they're actually sung, if just beautiful. Ilovesitso.

Harvey Danger - Flagpole Sitta: Quite possibly the first step to the long road of my alternative/indie kick. Of course, that started a couple of years after the song was actually made, but it nonetheless led me to discover a lot of bands I wouldn't have known about otherwise.

Robbie Williams - Rock DJ: Obvious reasons. (I don't wanna be a rock DJ. :/)

"event","So. Today wasn't exactly what most people would call a good day. In fact, some people may consider this to be a bad day. I, however, would like to believe that it was just ""another"" day.

School started off with me nearly falling asleep in gym. Attempting to, at least, but the floor is too hard to do that. Then in Social Studies we found out that one of our classmates tried to kill himself the night prior. 

Now this was a weird situation for me. I wasn't exactly good friends with the kid, nor was I really friends with him at all. However, it wasn't like I didn't know who the hell he was. I've had him in my classes ever since middle school. He sits in front of me. We know each other's names. How am I supposed to feel? I was caught in the middle. I wasn't devestated, nor was I really in a position where I could say ""Wow, that's a damn shame,"" and move on. Needless to say, the entirity of our grade was hit pretty hard, whether they knew him or not. I kept waiting for someone to say something really insensitive, cause I know some of us were thinking it. Suicide is fucking stupid. It's a terrible thing when it happens, but it's just really fucking stupid. I spent the day just wondering why it happened. I hate to say it, but it took someone's near suicide to get our English class to behave (dead silence).

Came home, took a nap, went to work. Went to work. I open up the first cage, a cockapoo, and try to coax the dog out so I could put the leash on. We were just sort of staring at each other before I finally reach in to put the leash on. The dog snaps, lashes out, and takes a bite out of my hand before running off screaming. I curse the little bastard to infinite hell before finally managing to wrangle it into a run, with it still shrieking like I was trying to rape it. I get it checked out by Dr. Ezzo and she tells me to go to the ER. Well, a good three hours spent in the waiting room later, I'm all cleaned-up and bandaged with a tetanus shot to boot. My two fingers are now bulbous bundles of gauze and medical tape, but at least I got some pills out of it.

It's funny, one of the best things it's got going for it is common ground. I mean, the people who are reading it are just as desperate and just as geeky as Piro himself is. It's got a real positive message to everyone who second guesses their every step, that perhaps it be best if we trust our own instincts and stop doubting what we're capable of. If your interested in a girl, what's saying you should hold yourself back from pursuing her?

Of course, this doesn't mean I myself am going to start doing this. I'm far too negative. Most of things occuring in the comic are chance and fantasy, but it's appealing none the less. Sometimes I wish real life was as wonderfully fateful.

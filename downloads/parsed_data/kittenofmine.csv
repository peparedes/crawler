"event","It's been awhile, trust me I know. I've spent many nights just worrying if i'll ever just get away. Finally it happened, I got over myself and chose to move up North. In this case, it's to Wisconsin. I'll miss those who I am leaving behind though I know they always will be close at heart.

A good friend of mine is leaving me tomorrow, going off to college for his first year. Living life the way he wants to live it. I'll miss him greatly, but knowing he'll try and call and i'll do the same, I think it will work out. I won't ever let him go fully without a fight. I can't and won't stand to do it.

A lot has gone on lately, from moving schools to moving homes. From fighting to hearing others fighting. To dancing on the beach with probably one of the cutest guys i'll ever meet in my life to watching others dance on the beach under a bright sky filled with fireworks. It sounds like heaven, but it really isn't. 

Heaven On Earth is finding that one person and dancing barefoot on a beach with fireworks going right after they tell you that they love you. But then it also can be dancing in the local beer tent with friends and family around you after a few too many drinks. 

Heaven On Earth is many things, and it took me just about my own life to find that out. Tonight, the family picked Mark up from his store and went to this food place. Mark and Niki went to get some food since it was a buffet and Mother told me that Niki asked what we were going to get her for her birthday.

She was in New Jersey for her birthday so we didn't see her on top of fighting the money issue with the bank. It took me a few moments before I realized that is what I always wanted. I've always had this empty place in my heart and what Niki has, what I always wanted. I told my mother that she is lucky she has a father who is there for her. 

Yeah, he is not always there everyday but i'm lucky if I can call my so-called father. He hates me and always has. The last time I saw him was last summer and he shoved me out of his house before I could say goodbye. I don't really know what goes through ones mind but I realized tonight that it sometimes takes a younger step-sibling joining your family to realize what you really wanted all along. 

I have what I need, and I have more then many do, but somewhere, I know i'll never fully be complete. I always wanted that fairy-tale family life. Growing up in one place with a father and a mother, then having blood siblings around me. Kind of like Amanda's family. 

I have always wondered what it would be like to have that feeling that you know your father or mother would come home at night. Knowing that out of no where you won't be on the streets, or thinking about being on the streets. Not having to worry about moving boxes across the United States three-four-five times in 2 years.

Maybe it's just all ramble, but it's something I always thought about but never took time to write about. I guess this wraps this entry up, I promise to write more sooner or later. It's late and i'm sick, on top of being dosed with medication to fight whatever I have.

Sleep well everyone and remember one thing..

""There are only three people in life you can trust..God, yourself, and family. You can't live without any of them."""

"event","This I try to answer but I can't find it. Besides a lot of love, happiness and contentment..Nothing. Or is that the problem? Who knows. He's just everything I dreamed of for the last few weeks and it's just amazing.

I'm afraid though, at the same time. Afraid that this will stay for like a week then disappear and totally twist me up to where i'm gone. Who I wanted to be with this guy, is gone and left. Maybe that's just the issue..I have to take what is coming and hold onto this while I can. 

It's an interesting feeling, not knowing what tomorrow will hold only knowing my love for one is so strong to where the pain of loss of another is mostly gone. Who knows. Many phone calls change that, day and night. He would know, I think he does know. Is there such a thing as too much love?

What has been going on lately besides that? 

Everything. Got my pictures and almost ready to send all of them out. Having to write letters and such to where it's a mess. Too much going on with too little time to handle it. Sadly.

Mother says i'm a flake for breaking up with a certain someone and not knowing what I want. It's not really my fault, you see. I feel that I need to be another person and doing what I always have done got me no-where. Yeah, I feel horrible for breaking up with him. But I need to do it. 

Something that I find is needed and I feel happier now that I have my worst fear out of the way. He hates me, *shrug* Oh well. I do not feel sorry for the guy I am with now because if I wasn't with him he would have anyone. I was worried that things would screw up so I did what I felt was needed. The lord told me to do it, so I did.

Understand anyone? Or am I just rambling? Eh. I'm done, needing to get stuff off my chest so I stop freaking out so quickly. Mrawr..Still scared of the thing with John. Time to go.

"event","<center> Another version of me..</center>

I hurt someone last night, so badly it reflected on how bitchy I am and why I shouldn't be here typing this. I want to apologize for how things went, but I can't. I apologize for hurting that person, trust me I do. But I don't apologize for saying my mind after so long and that person biting my head off for it. I'm not a friend to you, i'm nothing more then a person who was a part of you and took you somewhere you never thought you would be. I don't know why you are trying, I told you what I felt. I answered your questions..But I can't find my own faith. 

And I want so much for you..I would give it all for you. But trying to scare me with saying you would give your own blood for us to be friends again, is not the way to go. You can go and not finish reading this, or you can finish reading it..The choice is yours. But it's going to get really deep here soon...

-----------Stop reading here if you don't want to hear about my conversation and what i'm thinking..I'm warning you, STOP HERE-----------

If you are brave enough to continue reading, give yourself a pat on the back. I'm going to go deep into what happened, and spill probably the most I have ever in my life onto a journal. Here I go..

Giving your own blood for someone who is only a distant memory, is not right. Threatening someone with the fact that you are WILLING to do it when you have so much to live for. I lost everything you know in me..Everything. You fought for me for an hour or so and got yourself no-where. Only crying. That's where you find yourself..Crying and wanting something that will never come along because it hurts too much to see it happen.

Do you see how I feel now? Being left in the back of the room, back of your mind and expected to go and crawl back, wanting you to be with me again. I would love to have you as a friend, I would die for you..I almost did. You say that you think I want you to pity me..That's not even the point..I don't want anything from you, that's why I told you what I did about my heart..You can blame me for making you look like a fool, you can blame me for screwing you over for so long..But you did it also. You added your part and tore this friendship up just like I did. I can't do it alone..But then, you wouldn't help me either?

I want to make it..I want us to be friends..I want my life back. But as you said, it's like coming out of Rehab and seeing this person you never saw before that lost everything you once had. You did lose all you had..So did I. I lost myself, when I fought for you. When I fought for anyone, I lost it all. 

I want to hug you, I want to hold you and tell you we will make it. I want to kiss your cheek and rock you to sleep the nights you are feeling down. I want to be there for you. I want to be that sister you never had but always wanted. If only we could fall asleep together, curled up while watching a movie. But that's not enough. You being in Texas with me, will not help..It is not righting all the wrongs..It never will. What we did, we did and we can't turn back time and change it.

Trust me, if I could have all the dreams I had when I cried in my sleep, to come true..I would. But I can't. You moved on, you have your own girl and your own daughter. Now, why do you still push for me to stick around? You blame me for not knowing another version of love..I do. I have two brothers I love with all my heart, and I care so much about them. They are not even blood-related. One of them I have never met in my life, but he is STILL my brother. Don't start saying I don't know another version of love. 

Before you left last night, you told me to sleep well and hope that I find blessings where I never had before. I can't decide to have faith, you have to understand this. I can't just decide one morning and go, ""Oh yeah..I have this person who wants me to be something i'm not and never will be again, so I need to go and have faith.."" I'm not that type. I changed. I moved on, and I have too much damage to make it over that cliff. 

You never knew I talked to my father after two years, and maybe, before I did that, we could of had a chance. But now, I don't have enough strength. I got pushed out of his house and literally heard him say ""She's just a bitch. Her mother is fucking bastard. I hate them both. And she shouldn't be allowed in the house again."" That was my FUCKING father! The guy that is suppose to take me in and hold me when i'm upset, the person that is suppose to help me overcome things I never would alone. But instead, my own boyfriend has to give me that shelter. 

I want more then I can get from you. But I want you to have more then what I can give you. So I don't think you should keep a part of me in you. Reecee does everything I can't..and that's everything. Keep me as a faded memory, and when your birthday comes around..When our anniversary comes around..When you find yourself crying over hurting another person..Remember me. Know that i'm still looking over you, and missing you, and loving you. I want you to be happy..and i'm not in that. I can't make you happy, i'm not a friend to you.

You say that a firned doesn't care what the other one does wrong, they still love them and always will..I'm not that person you think I am. I'm not the Mellie you once knew and once loved. I'm her twin, the other person that changed when life failed and just fighting for one person, she lost. I'm the one that was defeated and screwed over until she had to turn bitchy, had to turn this way to just stay sane for a day. I'm not a friend, you know it. You just want it so bad you are not looking at the overall picture.

I don't see hope for us. I want to see it so bad, but I don't see it. I don't see faith in my own relationships working out, i'm just praying everynight they do. You have something, you have actually more then just one thing..You have plenty and I have none. If your plan is to go and share what you have, it won't work. You can't share something that one person has to help another. I tried that..I failed. The last few months here in three simple words..<b>I hurt. I fought. I lost. I fail. I changed..</b>

I love you, in ways I shouldn't and never should of in the first place. Remember me when you are finding yourself at a dark abyss and you don't have faith to know that you will be taught to fly or have something solid to walk on. I wanted to be better for you. I wish I could be better for you. But I give in, you have defeated me..and I have defeated myself. We lost this fight, honestly, we lost it. I wish you the best..I pray that you will make it alright on your own and you will always remember me. I can't find my own faith right now..It is not possible. I wish you the best in life. Tell everyone hello for me if you speak with them..And remember, memories are better then nothing..Just remember, if you feel something hugging you in the middle of the night. If you feel something crying out for you to hold her. If you feel a hand brush down your cheek, it's me. I'm sorry..I would love for you to hold me again..I would love for you to kiss my cheek like you always did. But I can't have it..You say I will never have what you had wanted before..What exactly was that? Or wait, should I even ask? I'll fade sooner or later..I know I will. If you just let yourself, I will. And I think that's for the best..

Goodbye..I have did my duty in your life and I have failed on making you the happiest you can..Please don't cry for me..Don't waste your tears on something that is not worth it..When I die, please don't cry..Promise me that. Remember that we had some good times..and the bad times just over-ruled it. I care, I always will..But it's not enough to get us anywhere. I wish you the best..And I will always remember you holding me, you kissing my cheek, the times I cuddled up against your chest crying from being hurt..But then I can never forget, being used by my best friend with another good friend..Times have passed..and we have our seperate ways finding that for us..I love you. You know my email address..I hope you have your life placed in front of you. And if you think you can get me to believe otherwise then what I do right now, I wish you the best..But I don't see it happening. My faith is gone. I don't have it anymore and I can't find it. I hurt you enough, you don't need it again..Once again I say..Goodbye.

-The Kitten who fades..but the Mewwie who will always be around forever in distant memories..

""When you reach the end of light in your life and you find yourself standing before a dark abyss, faith is knowing that when you take the next step there will be something solid to walk on or you will be taught how to fly."""

Well, John and I ended it fully last night. He told me that he wanted to help me with my letting go problem and is going himself. He doesn't want to hear from me again. Though he wishes me luck in life. If i'm not already confused as it is, that really adds up to it. I'm still making it, went to bed crying last night but woke up and I had a certain attitude..""I have Jesse, he loves me and he wants me to be happy. So I will be. I can either cry all the time for John or I can live with what he decided and go on with my life. I want to go on with my life."" Good attitude, no? 

Mother lost her job, so she's cleaning up the house and getting ready for a garage sale. We need the money and i'm kind of glad that we are spending more time together. We danced all night last night together, that was a blast.

Andy and I finally danced together. The last dance of the night which was special. The song was ""There we were."" I just about started crying, it was so sweet. He left me on the dance floor earlier in the night but I got over it after a bit. Just kind of pissed me off. He made it up to me though. Sadly, he's moving. I'm hoping to spend time with him before he leaves. Mother took pictures left and right with him and I dancing, it's nice to have his arms around me again. I called him after I got back home from Willies Ice House also. I should go by his house today, I don't know though. Niki is over this weekend possibly, I might have to stay around here. 

Prom was great. I enjoyed it immensley and got my photo's for everyone. Jesse will just smile his heart out when he recieves them. I might make him wait, we'll see. I'll send him photo's of Andy and I dancing of course. As soon as I get them. That was a great night, i'm still smiling from it. Brian got yelled at by his date since he was dancing with me most of the night. Sucker! Hehe. 

Not a whole heck of a lot is going on elsewhere. Just keeping up the place and getting ready to have that sale of stuff. School is ending here in 8 days, I can't wait. ^^; Jesse graduated yesterday, I won't see him until Monday but i'll make it. I might spend time with Garrett tonight if he calls. That or invite Andy over to spend time with. Who knows, we'll see. I need to work on my scrapbook, i'll write more later.

Only 11 days of school left. Thank the lord almighty. Then I have a whole summer off, well besides camps and such. Grandma is suppose to come down at the end of June, and stay through July. Going to the beach everday, yeah! ^^; 

I'm starting to doubt John is coming down, Jesse or Josh. Josh still might, I dunno though. J.B and I got back together. My sweetie. Good lord I care too much for him. He's graduating this Friday. 

My dance is this Friday. Prom is this Friday, rather. I got my ticket today. Pretty excited. My dress is done and ready. I have to go out tonight to get a few things to finish it all up but it's going to be a blast. I think we are going to Willies afterwards and then a party. I dunno, I need to talk to Gladus about it. 

This Saturday I have my AID class thing. That's going to be interesting. 10am-3:30pm. Non-stop. It's going to be a long day. Jesse won't be around all weekend so i'll probably work on the last minute projects and get those out of the way. Then hang around Courtnee for awhile. 

Sunday, who knows what i'm doing. I think i'm going to church and then having another ""Work on Projects"" day. Will be annoying but it needs to get done. Scrapbook thing is due the 24th of this month. Next Friday. I get out of school the 30th. Hmm..

Things are going okay, it's a mess but it's going. I can't miss any school, for the fact we have too much going on and no time to do it in. This Friday my quizes and Energy stuff is due. Next Friday I have more stuff due. It's just going to be continuous these days.

I haven't gotten a chance to talk to Josh in awhile. I'm starting to wonder if he is trying to get away from me. I hate losing contact with my brother. God, I care so much about him and love him so much, and it hurts everytime he hurts. I don't think I have felt this strongly about family. EVER! I just hope he knows that.

Those I haven't talked to lately:

-eXit=Robbie
-Geoff
-Fie
-Pellie
-Michael
-Jeff
-Brett 
-Amanda
-Richard
-Ravenz
-Chris
-Chad
-Daniel
-Julie
-Jenn
-Krusis
-Leo
-Reddish
-Tess
-Sommer
-Nicole
-Ronica

Hm..I hope they all are doing well. I really hate losing contact with people. Just not feeling all that social. Feeling the need to hide again. Oh well, Jesse will kick me out of that soon enough. I have no doubt. *giggles* The cutie. 

Anyway, Mother wants to go out. We need to get stuff like I mentioned. Anywa, Audios! Have a great weekend all. I probably won't write again until Monday, as usual. hehe. Ni ni.

Everytime I try to write, I can't. I have this feeling in me that something is not right and like I shouldn't write what has happened. I'll start out with what has been happening, hoping that i'll find out what's going on to get me back to where I want to write. 

-I got an award at the ceremony Thursday. ""Outstanding yearbook advisor for 2002."" Really nice award, i'm proud of myself. I worked my butt off for it. 

-I've been feeling really odd lately. Just kind of anxious, I guess. Wanting something that I don't know is coming. Maybe i'm just paranoid again. Wouldn't be the first time, hm?

-The prom is coming up here in a week. I'm making my dress today, and tomorrow. Hopefully it will be done. I'll post pictures around when I get them. 

-Mark is sick, and so am I. Mother is just tired. Seems like it's a family again. *shudder* Wait, we have no family. Anyway..

That's all i'm in the mood to write. If I get up to it i'll write more later. Other then that, nevermind it all. You can't force your heart to type your feelings out when you don't have any. 

Don called me yesterday, for the reasons of why I don't know. But i'll find out sooner or later. *shrugs* Nap time soon it seems. I have another 7 hours to mess around with. Later.

<b>Friday's Fanatics</b>

Just stayed home all night until 8:30 or so, mother came and picked me up to go out to dinner after she took cold medicine and pissed off the Dish Guy. Apperently, they need someone to be over 18 to work on the house when they are only dealing with things in the backyard. *snickers* I don't understand that, but whatever.

1. Car broke down
2. Stuck in a car, with a bitchy ass female, who was frightened about the gate being closed since our car was parked inside the gate of this Formal Gallery
3. I drove a car..
4. I almost ran straight into the building
5. I slapped my mother
6. I starved myself
7. I'm still tired from it
8. I learned why people are such dumbasses
9. Life is a pain in the ass..and last of all;
10. The tow-truck dude was a MORON!

<b>Sunday Strikes</b>

I got up at 8 and went to work with Mark. We were driving down the road, just passing up the toll-booth and this 5 year old started slamming his head against the car, staring right at ME. If that isn't annoying, then only god knows what. I worked from 10 o'clock until 8 o'clock. That sucked. I missed seeing Brian though, he's a sweetheart. ^^; Mark and I got home around 9 o'clock after I found out someone lied to me, yet AGAIN. Oh well. 

And that's all that has gone on since Thursday..I'm going to go to LCH tonight which is going to be cool and then just go to bed afterwards, probably. Do projects and such. Kind of neat. ^^; Anyway, life is just life. I'm waiting on Jesse, I can't wait. *giggles* I missed him Sooooo much.

There are always choices in life that we can live by. Believing in them, or hating them, is always our choice. We can choose to move on from a love, and ignore them, or we can figure out another way to live with that person. I firmly believe that no one can make us choose any choice, enless they have the power over all humanity. And we all know, no one has that power except our lord...

Holocaust Poem~Unedited and quickly written

<center><i>""Screams at night,
 She hears without warning,
 Everywhere she looks,
 There are other visions.
 Will she get out of this?
 Is it possible to escape
 The world that follows your every move?
 
 The time has passed,
 And she continues to follow.
 Those who suffered, kill her
 Those who lived, miss her.
 Is it possible,
 To escape a world that follows,
 Your every move?""</i></center>

A poem about a couple and life~Unedited and quickly written

<center><i> ""She grew up with little,
 Suffered a lot.
 He grew up with a lot
 But suffered little.
 They both lived quietly,
 In a house that no one saw.
 Now the ages hence;
 When you can live a world without,
 Why live a world with regrets?""</i></center>

"event","<center> It nearly killed me..but it only opened my heart for the road ahead. </center>

It hurt to see this guy leave, though with how much I care I know he'll come back sooner or later. Every morning and everynight I pray to the lord to take care of his soul and keep him going on. With me or without.

At my lowest times, he always knew the way to go and make me smile. I guess it takes distance to see it. Many don't understand my ways, others don't seem to care. That's fine with me. I don't seem to really care about my own either.

But through everything, this guy never gave up. He told me to continue on, and if I ever did fail, then I can say I tried. It was more then what others could say. I believed him, I fell in love with him, and I still love him. Though that just doesn't seem like everything at a time like this.

It amazes me at how much I could learn in a year from one guy that showed me there is a point to life. I guess we do come across those by following your own path. A quote I know, and love to death and will always live my life by, is this:

<center> <b><i>The Road Not Taken</i></b>

Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
And sorry I could not travel both
And be one traveler, long I stood
And looked down one as far as I could
To where it bent in the undergrowth;

Then took the other, as just as fair,
And having perhaps the better claim,
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
Though as for that, the passing there,
Had worn them really about the same.

And both that morning equally lay
In leaves no step had trodden back.
Oh, I kept the first for another day!
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
I doubted if I should ever come back.

I shall be telling this with a sigh,
Somewhere ages and ages hence:
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I-
I took the one less traveled by,
And that has made all the difference.
                          -- Robert Frost </center>

<center> <b>""Two roads diverged in a wood, and I-
I took the one less traveled by,
And that has made all the difference.""
                        --Robert Frost</b> </center>

Makes you think, doesn't it? Makes me smile when I realize that all my dreams will continue to come true because of one person who knew I was worth something more then what everyone else attempted to tell me.

Jesse left Saturday to go to Florida. I'm upset, missing him, and wanting to be near him again. It makes me think and wonder how I could love him so much but then not be with him and hurt him like I am. Though he says that he doesn't mind just being friends and having the ""relationship"" we have still. I don't know, i'm lost and confused in it. 

I saw my father on Saturday. That was a stupid thing to do. Ryan and Richard are still hot as hell, I would really like to say hello to them again but i'm not allowed to because I don't live there or something. That shit. My dad is an asshole, that's just offical. I'm sick of him, all of him. I recall why i'm not there all the time now-a-days. 

Mary told me don't be a stranger, and my reply was ""Trust me, I will."" They haven't changed their ways. Pushing me out the door, dad not wanting mother to see the kids. I'm sick of it. Lets just say, i'm not seeing them for awhile. Mother picked me up around 6:30 and I cried to dinner. I couldn't help it. I was pissed, upset, and missing Mechenzie and Madison. 

They have grown up so much, and it just hurts knowing it will be awhile before I will see them again. *sighs* I just pray that the lord watches over their souls and keeps them healthy and happy. Even if it does mean, I will never talk to them again. I'll be praying for them. As always, I love you Madison and Mechenzie.

I found out that i'm getting my dress the 12th of May for Prom. That's going to be interesting. Though, knowing mother, she'll still be pissed about the phone-bill and not let me. Apperently i'm going to be grounded longer now since they never gave us the full-bill at once. It's another 345 dollars or something. Screw it. I'm being blamed for everything when I did nothing.

I'm going to go and do projects, possibly sleep and shit. I need to rest up for school tomorrow. Grandmother's leaving. In a way i'm glad, otherwise i'm a little nerve-racked. Oh wel. I'll see later on.

I might not be writing until next Monday. I don't know. I'm waiting to see how I feel. Here I go, living in the world without any place. Lord, take away all of this. Please. I need the strength right now, and i'm not finding any.

<center>..And I never thought it would happen to me. </center>

First off, the school day went fine. We got done with the last exam today around 9:45, end of 2nd period, and just went onto the regular schedule. You can't really blame us for wanting to get out. Hehe. 

The day went on as usual and then I found out I started my ""friend"" early so that pissed me off a bit but i'm fine. Bouncing off the walls, like normal. Anyway, I got ready after getting myself home and taken care of to go to Rick's. 

That was cool, spent a lot of time listening to Andy play his stuff and such. Was kind of neat spending time with boy. I messed around with the animals a lot which was fun. Then this lady came by Rick's house and needed to use the phone. 

Apperently she was locked out by a friend that went to the park with a two out of the three kids. She had one little boy with her that got left with her by the real mother who is only 20 and is only 80 lbs. It's pathetic. *shudders* Pissed me off some but anyway. I carried the little boy back home and got the suckers that she gave to me and all that. I walked her little girl into the kitchen with her and then she asked me if I wanted I job. 

Well, duh! So I said 'I wouldn't mind one' and she said to write my number down on the fridge. I did so and she said that I am hired to go and watch her children. Again, my time online is going to be dropped considerbly for the fact that I -need- this job and such but it's cool. I can't wait to start. ^^ Her kids love me and I love them. They all are adorible. 
She has three with her so i'm getting paid big-bucks. Probably 8-hour shifts. Weekends-8 hours and then weekdays probably 4-5 or so. It depends, of course. I have a summer job too. ^^ *bounces* 

Anyway, i'm poofing now. I think I have annoyed everyone far enough. Hehe. I can't wait to start it. Yay. Also, I got a letter saying that I was in the Athletic trainer program. That's good snuff. Hehe. I can't wait, today is great. *bounces more*

It's Thursday, the 18th of April, the year is 2002. Don't ask why I put that up here, I just did. Hehe. I'm tired, worn out, sick as hell, and just mentally drained. I've had a major exam all week, (Tuesday-Friday) and then I can't sleep much Friday night for packing to do and then i'm leaving Saturday morning for a day to San Antonio. 

It's been a long week, and it's not quite over yet. For the first time in two years, i'm going to see my father. Lord save my soul, i'm about to blow. >< He's still upset with me about Josh, Jesse, and John. Oh well, he can live. He decided to yell at me about coming to see him and then I told him no one is down here except G-ma, Mom, Mark, Niki (sometimes) and me.

Jesse and I are really close still, and the last few days I don't think I would of made it without him. He's been there through thick and thin and it amazes me how much I throw on him and he still comes back. True friends do last forever, I guess. We'll see here in a few weeks.

I haven't talked to mother about the whole flight thing yet but i'm thinking about pitching in. Since she's having to still pay off the phone bill (Sowwy Mother..>< ) it's the least I can do. Not like there is much I can do but I mean, I could see how much the trips are and then pick in like 50 a month. *shrugs* We'll see.

Josh, Jesse and John are suppose to come down. I'm doubting that John will, but I don't know. John promised me that he would if we still were ""together"" or whatnot, but he's kind of screwed me over in the last week. Josh is most likely coming down, yay! He'll probably stay for a bit then go back up to Ohio. You little bugger. *giggles* Jesse, i'm not too sure about. I would love for him to stick down here with me for a bit but i'll get lucky before that happens. *starts praying...wait, continues praying*

There isn't much else going on. Monday grandmother leaves, that's going to be a change for me. She's been here since the beginning of March and it's been nice, well, for the most part. We keep having WWIII in the house and that's getting a bit annoying but oh well. 

Jesse is going to Florida here coming Saturday, the day that I leave for the weekend, so I won't talk to him until the 29th of April. Only a week, i'll make it. *sniffles* Oh well. Lots of time to just go and get my grades up. Suprisingly I passed last grading period also. Yay. 

I have a cold or something, keep coughing and sneezing and having allergy problems. I'll get that checked out here in a few days if it doesn't get any better. I have been spending a great amount of time on my school work, which is really impressing the family I think. Kind of nice being noticed again and not ignored. 

I need to try and clean the room up, the carpet guys have still not came. I'm going to get my couch to somewhere else besides the middle of my room. Possibly fix my bed and such. Then do the kitty litter and then probably screw around watching TV. Maybe time to talk to Jesse somewhere in there.

I think I am finally able to admit that John did break up with me. No matter how much it hurts, and how much I try to cry over it, I don't see a future there. He has hurt me more then any other guy I know, and yet doesn't seem to care in the least. From this, I laugh when someone tells me to ""F--- Off"" or whatever. Words don't bother me, he does.

That's the update on that pretty much. I don't know what is going on with Jesse and I, sometimes I just feel so happy with him and others I think i'm messed up. I had to write a speech about my most important relationship, and all I could think of is his and I's. He's still close to me, i'm starting to worry if that's bad. 

I might actually stay single for awhile. I was reading through some stuff earlier and I can across this saying..""Before we set our hearts too much upon anything, let us examine how happy they are who already possess it."" ---Francois de La Rochefoucauld

It really made me wonder if i'm fit to have a guy. I haven't been single in over two years now or close to it, and i'm just liking the freedom. I might have a date to the dance, then I might not. Really depends if he asks me. Him and I have been eyeing eachother for awhile now and just continuously flirting. 

It's nice to get to flirt again and not have to worry about your guy (girl's) feelings towards the subject. Don't get me wrong, I do love John and I. But I can't love someone who just wants to haunt me. I know he's going through a lot but there is always a line to draw. Sadly, I had to draw it after his comment yesterday stating..""How can you be there for me? You are only words on a screen."" 

It's sad, honestly it is. Makes me wonder about guys and why I feel the way I do. Maybe i'm just an idiot. Though I have to remember what Josh said, ""Just because one of us screws you over, don't judge all of us on one person."" No matter how much I still am upset with him, I feel that we bonded closer now. Everything was going great between Josh and I until he blew up at me and I just reacted defensively. 

My life is just twisting and turning, but thankfully I have one person who still cares so much about me. Only an hour and a half just about until I can talk to him. I miss him so much, but then can't at all. It's confusing. My mind is elsewhere and the only thing I can say is, ""A friend is someone who dances with you in the sunlight and walks beside you in the shadows."" Isn't this the truth?

Time to go and put the bike up before it gets stolen. I'll write more later on. God bless.

First off, I can honestly say that I have yet to find a ""perfect"" relationship. Because, hell, if there is such a thing out there, send it my way. When I finally reached John after many days, I blew up at him. Not because I was upset, because I was not wanting our relationship to go where it was headed. 

He told me a friend of his was dying so he wasn't around much and started yelling at me. My heart sunk when I heard this news, but no matter how much I fighted it all, I couldn't bare to let myself get hurt so I took action. The action lead him to continue yelling and then me hanging up on him. Let me tell you, don't do this first of all.

I have little less then a month until he's suppose to come down, and I need to find a way to get through this with him. Just can't reach him half of the time. I told him he had until next Monday and if he still hasn't called or made up his mind on what we are going to do to keep this going, then he can count himself single. 

I'm engaged to this guy, I love this guy, but I will not under any oath, risk myself to be hurt. I see it coming, and I know it's there. I'm scared to do this, honestly I am. But if he cares about me like he says, he'll try and keep us together. I sent him an email before I left the message on his machine and then he picked up. Maybe that wasn't a smart move but oh well.

I'm going to just start crying when I hear the name all week, I know it. I hate myself for what I did, but I had to do it. I had no other choice in the matter. Maybe this was a mistake, trying to find another relationship when the one I had was just normal to me. We all wonder why we never attempt things at times and it boils down to being afraid of <i>change.</i>

Maybe i'm stupid to try and make this work, and maybe i'm not. Isn't the world full of ""maybe's"" Hm? I might try and find Garrett's number and ask him to come over. I need someone to just hold me that's not John. Then, he can never hold me either but whatever. I don't think Garrett would mind. I need someone to just calm my fears down. And having Mark part of the family just isn't cutting it.

Oh well, if not then i'll just sit here and cry. Good long cry. Feel guilty, want to kill myself, die. It's nothing new compared to every other time something goes on. I just pray that John takes care of everything and gets ahold of me. I'm worried about him, i'm worried about us. Most of all, i'm worried about me.

What if i'm not good enough? What if i'm stupid to try and do all this? We can do this all day if I really wanted to. Questions on my relationship when no one out there really cares. Hm, seems like my life is a soap opera. ""The world turns"" or whatever that show is called. Equals this up pretty good.

I'll write later, possibly not. We'll see. Just need to do something to get away. Figure out life and all.

This is one of those entries that I want responces on, maybe some help from those who know or care enough to take time and read this shit that I put up on here. So, if you care in the least, please drop a note by and at least let me know that i'm not a waste of time. It will help. I promise you.

Anyway, back onto why I bothered getting -back- online and posting some shnit up and talking about my problems. It's been a month and two days, so much has happened and none of it makes sense. I love him, honestly I do. But i'm lost. Maybe i'm just letting myself get hurt, ""clam up"" or something. I don't know what I want to do. Right now, just get away.

It got me thinking on the way to drop Niki off. Just thinking about things, and why I miss having a guy -right here- to be with. John is closer to me then any other guy, this I realize. But he's not right here. I still miss that connection. Like Garrett and I had, the always touching thing. There wasn't a day, that Garrett didn't try to kiss me or show me that he did give a damn.

Hey, don't get me wrong. I know John cares, and I know he trys to show it. But for heaven sakes, being female and having to live with only knowing guys, it grows on you and you get annoyed. The fact that I <i>still</i> try to be everything but <b>ME!</b> It's driving me past the limit here, and off the cliff. 

Maybe i'm just out of my mind. Maybe I need to get a clue and just leave. Wouldn't that be amazing? I have this thing with saving certain conversations and keeping them. I kept one from Friday-Saturday with John. It said something like ""I love you deeply, but Kitten (My nickname), you need to take a breath here and there."" Maybe he has a point, I guess I do take on too much. Gives him a right to be worried sick about me. ><

I guess life just isn't being nice anymore. Makes me worried about things. Is it possible that, maybe, i'm not meant for this? I dunno. My mind is wandering. Hopefully John will call soon. I pray. If not, well, i'll just have to live to see another day. Hell, either way I have to. Damn. 

Just about 11:30, i'm going now. My mind is off and just fried. Maybe i'll do something productive. Maybe not. We'll see, won't we? Yeah, leave it up to me to figure out everyone else's life when I can't even understand mine.

A beloved friend, companion, and mate for life. </center>

Dear Journal,

The day is April 6, 2002. Exactly one month since my best friend and soulmate started dating. Some say that this is just another one of my ""Stupid Relationships That Fail"" but i'm starting to think otherwise. 

I love this guy, and hell, I think I broke my wrist to not hurt this guy. I almost lost him, but then, I didn't have a shot at having him either. Earlier, I was reading through some conversations that I had saved and I started crying. I lost all self-control and drove myself crazy trying to figure out where it was.

Have you heard of the saying ""You don't know what you have until you lose it?"" Well, that's everything but lies. And after a damn good long mental break-down, I think I believe in it. I can't lay in bed without wanting this guy right there with me. I can't sleep at night. 

Even though the rest of the world will let me down, I always believed that he will pick me back up. But finally; he, himself let me down. Nothing that he said, nothing that he did. He probably doesn't realize it himself. Sure as hell I didn't right away. It might be the fact that I let myself down and i'm blaming him, but I don't know anymore.

I cracked fingers, and took major pain for myself yesterday (Friday.) And I have yet to find out why. I had to get my anger out, had to find a way to hide my fear. Yet, it didn't help. I came back in the house, felt it all and had to go back out. I threw that volleyball up on that roof who knows how many times. And did not stop. 

I lost the point of this, but no matter what I do, i'll always love him. Why? He's everything to me. And anything more. I just hope he realizes this. I will go through hell just to be with him, and I did. I'll fight for it again, just like I already have. And until the day he is happy with himself, i'll be beside him to make sure he knows that he is loved.

I love you. Remember that.

Been talking to John for hours at a time..Mother hasn't yelled at me yet, so whatever works. I miss him..*sighs* Badly. I enjoy listening to his voice, hearing him say that he loves me, singing to him, hearing him laugh, hearing him say that he wants to be with me and kiss me. *smiles* I dunno. Life is just confusing these days, I guess. Not sure what to do.

Leo wanted me to write about him, so I guess I will. Even though we get sick of eachother constantly, annoyed with facts that maybe and possibly we still have feelings for eachother, he's a sweetheart. There's a lot to write but I don't feel like really typing everything. I might go and lay down.

Yeah, i'll write more later. Just waiting around for Chris to call and such. Might go to the park..*snicker* I dunno. I might go ride my bike..Do something productive while I wait for 9 o'clock to come around. Hmm..

I'm not going to go into the thing with John and Jesse. This is going to be a short entry, I don't feel good and am really tired. I was suppose to call John at 9 and it's past 9:30. Oh well. Randall answered and he's not around. Hasn't seen him. It's not good.

I'm stressed, to say the least. Scared of things again, worried about life. Just kinda blah.  Leo is trying to help me out with things, i'm just flat out scared. Wanting to go and hide. Get away. 

I dunno. I'm leaving this open for whoever feels the need to contact me..Have fun.

"event","<center> I'm starting to think that maybe..just maybe..I'm screwed. </center>

As I read through the days' entries in Livejournal, I come to think that maybe my ""perfect"" life isn't all that ""perfect."" I saw Mrs. Mamoux today during 4th period and I told her I needed to speak with Mr. Bush. Well, I did during 5th period and life took a turn from there. 

The day was fine, honestly it was. Maybe i'm just screwed up and I have no hope for me. It saddens me to see how many others are failing, and it's reflecting on me. I don't know how, but it is. It's like, <i>I</i> did it. Even though I know I couldn't have.

Josh called me last night, that helped yesterday out. I made it a order to try and have a good day, but then I failed again. Oh well. I'm starting to just give in again. Some are saying that i'm just too damn lazy, others are saying you just need someone to push you back up. Either way, I think there is no hope.

I got bitched at for calling my man last night. Oh well. *shrugs* One of these days, I swear. It's counting down. Probably the beginning of May or end of July. Jobs and such are getting in the way. *crosses fingers* I pray.

Easter is this weekend, save me. I don't think i'll hold up without breaking down. I get off Friday, I might go to work with Mark. Stay there all day, come home, talk to Jesse and Josh, go to bed and get up on Saturday, go to the library with Ashley, talk to Jesse/Josh/John and then go to bed. Wake up Sunday, go to church, worship, come home, make lunch, go to church again, go to bed. 

I might be off Monday and Tuesday for Chris' sake. I <i>might.</i> Mark is off so those are the only days I can see him. The days I have a ride. I'll explain more of that later. I need to go and do research and then call John and go to bed. I'm tired and bitchy. Rawr.

I was reading this book that my mother wanted me to read and it said that just laughing once a day will help you get through that day. Maybe I should try that. Loosen up and just laugh. Find something to laugh about. Laugh at myself if I have to. *giggles quietly* And you wonder why i'm always giggling..

Hehe. Anyway, 3 more days of getting up really early. Yay!! I have a three-day weekend this week so i'm bouncing for joy with that. Cramps came back early >< I need to figure out what's going on. It's only the 25th. I'm not due for another two weeks. Ick. Mother and I need to talk soon.

Well, I got woken up around 4:45am, and that sucked. Fought with AOL for most of the morning until 5:30 and then finally got it working. Stupid thing wouldn't balance. Mother's going to kill me for using her debit card but I needed AOL working. Not my fault it's stupid.

I'm suppose to be getting ready, but since I feel like writing my thoughts, i'm not going to. I only need to put my shoes on and such. I've done everything else. My make-up really looks good. Explains the theory of not putting any on all weekend. Hehe. 

I'm feeling a little better then the last two days. Allergies got the worst of me with Spring and all. Life sucks at times. Oh well. I need to be poofing, i'm going to go and laugh at Josh since he finds it fun to love-tango with his work. *snickers* 

Write more later on!

"event","<center> Recap..</center>

<b>The last four days..</b>

<b><i>Thursday..</i></b>

2nd day of Spring. Allergies had a major effect on this day. Drove me crazy. Not a whole lot went on. The roleplaying thing I was suppose to do didn't turn out right so I went shopping around 7:30 when Josh never showed up. Came to find out he got on thirty minutes after I left. 

I went shopping. Got this $50 dress from my grandmother for Easter, it's pretty. I'll be taking pictures here shortly. As soon as I get a chance. I was thanking the lord that I passed my math exam. Finally has me thinking i'll possibly pass the year. ^^;; 

<b><i>Friday..</i></b>

The day went by fast. I had a good day and enjoyed it. That night I went to the Comedy Club and just relaxed. I missed seeing Michael Bartle around during the day. He's funny when he puts his mind to it. 

Being the Mellie, I just about had coffee but then forgot my freakin' money. Stupid dumb ass. *growl* Oh well. Hehe. I might get one later on tonight. Well, I got home and got sick. Had a fever and just was cold. Went to bed at 9:30 and got up around noon on Saturday.

<b><i>Saturday-Sunday...</i></b>

We cut down trees. Hehe. That's what we did. Cut down trees, chopped and saw'd, became sore and mother got sunburnt. Poor her. We went to Denny's for dinner and just kind of munched. Stopped by the closing K-mart and that was a pit. NEVER go there when it's closing. I had my boots on and was pushing the wheelchair, constantly fell over and such. Got real jittery. 

I called John after he got online and gave me his number. I left it in my locker and then Anthony took the cell anyway so whatever. Hehe. Noah's a sweetheart though. Hmm..I'm suppose to call him (John) later on tonight. Try and contact him in his dorm. He's off of spring break which is good. He might come down here around the 11th of May. I dunno. Only a few months. ^^

I spent the night with Jesse and got up around 9:30, stayed in bed until 10 or so. Kind of didn't feel like moving. Took a shower and got ready to go cut down some more trees. Got done with that around 2pm. The day was long, and i'm sort of looking forward to tomorrow. School, away from the house. Fun. 

Mother is bringing home some drinks and we are going to grill Pork Chops. Yay. Good things. ^^;; I'm tired of typing so i'm going to leave you with a funky little blob. Enjoy.

"event","<center> Quick Overview..</center> 

Honestly? The day was fine. Annoying and disturbing as always but fine. I found myself dozing off during 3rd period just from boredom and such. Then I had that conference this morning. Athletic Trainer. Signing up for a 4-year thing which thankfully will work around my Volleyball schedule. 

They have this thing where I can take just the class during the Volleyball season and then the main course after that season is over. Which is kind of cool, in my opinion. I'm going to be doing a lot of after-school stuff. Possibly not getting home until 6 or 7 most nights. It's going to be a lot to handle but i'll make it. 

A lot is going on, and i'm giving in soon. It's going to the point where life isn't fun anymore. I need to make it fun. I haven't talked to John lately, i've been trying to contact him but he's not answering his cell. Something or another will happen and i'll reach him.

I found out one of my good friend's is coming down to Houston here in two weeks. I get to see him, ^^; Yay. Just need to set time away and all. It's going to suck but oh well. His grandfather is dying so he needs to do the house stuff and all. I'll probably take off like a day or two and see him. Mother won't mind. I have to check on what's going on and such but oh well. 

Life is just flying by as always. It's 9 o'clock and i'm praying i'll pass my exams tomorrow. I hate to see what I made, that's probably the worst part. That's just me though. Oh well. Well, i'm tired. So this is goodnight.

Honestly, don't screw with me anymore. It's not going to happen. People want me to be honest, and when I am, they don't want me to be. It's called make-up your life. I have given in to the world for far too long, and i'm sick of it. Leave me alone. 

I'm going to be with John for two weeks tomorrow. That is something whether I think it is or not. He means the world to me, but unlike someone who parades around talking about him, I don't. So screw her.

Knowing my family, I need to be the ""perfect"" daughter and such. Well, it's just not going to happen. I'm not perfect, i'm never going to be perfect, so help me god. *snickers* Anyway, some say i'm my worst enemy, that's how little they know.

Enough of that rant..Moving on. The day sucked. *shrugs* I think we cleared that now. Mark and I went out to do errands and such after I got off of school and then we went -back- out again. Kind of cool. Turned up the music loud with the sunroof open. Yeah! ^^;;

Jesse has been helping me out a lot. It took me awhile to go and get calm again. I just about blew it earlier. I haven't been able to reach John but when I do, it's going to be the ""Pissy Kitty"" mood. He's in for it. If he reads this, and he better, he will know what to look for.

Well, the night as come to a close. I'm tired and sick of my computer. Tomorrow is yet another day that I have to deal with the world. Maybe life will make sense. Or maybe not. We only can live one day at a time. Sadly.

Sleep well, all. Another day is here.

"event","<center> What do I feel? </center>

Honestly, nothing. I feel people wanting to know me, I feel people wanting to love me, but then I feel nothing all at once. Is this possible, you say? Well, if it isn't then apperently i'm just jack-shitting you all. Hehe.

Well, it took me 6 hours to finish my language project but I got it done. And boy did it feel good to have that off my hands. If only I did it like two weeks ago. *snickers* I went back to school today, it sucked. 

Some might say that i'm jealous of Chris and Rachel, or Ashley and Cody, but I don't care anymore. You see, i'm sick of seeing two make out for three hours straight and then expect me to be perfect and dandy. It just isn't going to happen that way. I'm dead serious. Life is not meant to be a love-fest. 

You are suppose to pick your shit up and go on. Look, I might sound like a rude bitch, but honestly, why kiss someone for three hours and then all of a sudden think that your <i>best friend</i> won't be angry with you. This hasn't just started, it's been going on for awhile now. Our friendship is a ""talk on the phone, weekend, screw around, last minute"" thing and i'm sick of it. I'm bringing it up to her tomorrow. Screw this shit. No need for more pain.

It disgusts me when i'm suppose to put up with all this also. *shakes her head* I dealt with it long enough. I don't go around ranting about John to everyone I know. Hell, I got told that people don't believe i'm dating John. I flat out said ""Fine. Don't believe me. See where not trusting gets you."" She looked at me like I was a flying-ass bitch but oh well.

I've put up with it long enough. All of it. The days are counting down until I leave. April 6, 2002 is the day i'm gone. Gone for good. I'm leaving Toc's, leaving everything. As I said, i'll leave my journal's up and AIM, but that's all. It's now or never.

Too much pain, too little time, too much damn stress. I'm risking my life for people and I get jack-shit in return. Screw it. Life sucks, get used to it. Damn I sound like a good friend of mine. >< Oh well. Maybe he just is rubbing off on me finally. Took him long enough. 

Besides all that, nothing happened. Did the diary of Anne Frank in English, had to do an outline for Plate Tectonics in Geology, Found out I passed my quiz in Algebra, Played soccer and pulled something in my knee. Screwed up my foot yet again, oh well. 

Oh, I called John. Let me tell you how that went. *sighs* I'm close to just giving up. I hate saying it, I love him, but love and life shouldn't be this way. Show me the way, Lord, just please. I look to you now more then ever. Don't screw me into this again, I don't need it. I have enough problems.

W.W.J.D: If life failed on him? If he found out how much hate there is in this world? If he saw the pain we all go through to believe that there is someone up there? If he had to live one day in the life of the worst person, and see what <i>he</i> has made for that one person?

So what, i'm screwed. Lay in peace.

"event","<center> Another entry about a dear friend..</center>

When I first met this guy, my heart was just gone. He's so full of life even when he is feeling so down. He would try and cheer you up just to see you smile. Life didn't seem bad anymore. He knew how to make things work and he lived up to them. He's something special.

Our friendship grew so quickly, and it never stopped me from feeling things for him. The first time this guy lied to me, it killed me. But one main thing I believe in is ""Forgive and forget."" It took me a week or so, but I knew I cared about this guy extremely and I forgave him for what he told me. 

This guy is amazing. There is no doubt about that in my mind. He knows so much about me but then he barely knows me. He's one of my close friends who I will always look up to and always be beside. I can't imagine life without this one either. It would be like living but not living. 

The first time he called me, my heart melted. I had been waiting for weeks beforehand and here it was. He always thought that he sounded dorky or something, but then he probably never will know how much I do care about him. No, I don't <i>love</i> him. I love him like a brother, best friend and companion, but nothing more. Why? Because I feel the pain I put him through. 

You all are probaly wondering who this guy is, well, his name is Robbie. Amazing roleplayer, an amazing friend, amazing guy. I do have to say what I mostly love about him besides his attention he gives to me and that sort..His purring. He's cute as hell, I have to admit..*grins* 

Though he has had some major rough times, he'll always be close to me. I will stand up for him until the day that I think he doesn't need me anymore. Even then, I think he'll force me to stick around. 

Earlier, I was worried about him and asked him what was wrong. Here is part of our conversation:

<i>""The Organic PSS: sorry.  just been wierd.
Mellie Vellie: How so?
The Organic PSS: just have been.
Mellie Vellie: Do you not want to talk about it?
The Organic PSS: not sure how too... just inside me stuff.
Mellie Vellie: If you don't want to talk to me, just say so, alright? 
The Organic PSS: no I'm fine.
Mellie Vellie: Sweetie, i'm not talking about just now. I just want to make sure you are okay and you know that i'm here to talk to or just cuddle whenever is needed. *nudges* Also the whole phone calling thing if i'm not online. Okay?
The Organic PSS: kay.  thank you.
Mellie Vellie: *nods* You are welcome. It's the only thing I can really do.
The Organic PSS: I understand... it means a lot.
Mellie Vellie: *nods softly and hugs* If you want to know the truth, you mean a lot to me.  It's only fair that I return it all.
The Organic PSS: thanks doll.  Just saying that is all the return I need *hug*""</i>

He and I went on cuddling and such that I won't bore you with but he's a sweet guy and I do wish him the best. 

Ni Cutie. *tickle*

Naw, i'm happy. Perfectly fine. Just about to kill my boyfriend but i'm good. That little shit ran off and disappeared, then decided to yell at me for calling his house when -he- never told me that he was going to his brothers. Then of course he said that he wouldn't recieve his cell again for awhile (which <b>he did!</b>) That little..

Okay, i'm calm down..A <i>little</i> calmer..Not much..Don't get any ideas. Anyway, I called Justin and he's suppose to call me back here soon. He was apperently watching ""two little brats."" They were cute. I just started giggling, listening to them talk back at him. Cute! ^^; 

Another one of those things that i'm worried about is the fact that John actually thinks i'll cheat on him. I mean, it has been awhile since I actually got called that, but still, it's odd. I mean, he never had to worry if I was cheating on him before, and all of a sudden, he's like ""Well i'm worried you are cheating on me.."" and all this other shit. Maybe this just isn't made to be. I'm not going to just give in, it's only been just about two weeks. I love this guy, he is my world. I'm just scared that he'll go and do something that just isn't right. 

<b>Some Bad Things:</b> 
~He drinks and smokes, <i>a lot</i>
~His attitude is sometimes not appreciated 
~He is never sure that I love him (But then this is both ways)
~He's not as sensative at times

Those are actually the only bad things about him. That's pretty good for what him and I have been through. I mean, I can help him work on all that, it's just sometimes I get a little upset. Sometimes feel like giving in. But then there are those times where I can't imagine life without him. It's like, I would die or something.

*smiles* Life is so confusing, but i'll make it out. He's worth it, always have been and always will be. I love you, John H. You are my heart and soul, with everything else.

The party was great. I had a lot of fun when I didn't think I would. Mostly we just played Volleyball/Football/Soccer and hung around. Honestly, I enjoyed it. Being an outsider, I found out that there are people who are worse then I. It was a blast.

Those who were there: Ashley (Of course), Me, Youself, Luke (Church dude), David and his girlfriend (forgot her name..I knew this girl for years I swear..><), Casey, Jennifer (Really cool person), Brant (Little brother of Ashley), Millicent (Sweet girl). I think that's all of them. It was a really interesting party.

<b>HighLights of the Party</b>
1. I tackled Brant to the ground and still managed to not get the ball from him..This was funny as hell. He wouldn't give me the freakin' ball.
2. I up-handed the volleyball and it knocked Cody off his feet and onto his back. He's <i>still</i> scared of me. Ashley was laughing so hard then she threatened to go and hit me with the ball but I ducked out of the way and it hit Jennifer. I'm mean, so what. ^^;;
3. Youself, Luke, Brant and Millicent were all calling 1-800-collect and being really odd. Youself actually started moaning to scare people. *giggles quietly* Good lord. That was another funny part.
4. I didn't think it was possible for two people to kiss through-out the party. Well, I was proven wrong.
5. The gift and letter I gave Ashley made her cry. Lets just say, I got a lot of love from those. Happy Birthday, Hun!
6. Ashley and I were hugging and standing next to eachother. She had an arm around my waist while I had my arm around her shoulders and here came David, moving in to hug us both. That was sweet of him. It scared me but it was sweet. I haven't had a guy do that in awhile it seems. His reply was ""I'm just that kind of guy.."" Ashley and I giggled quietly.

Once again, I had a blast and i'm just looking out for Jesse. I can send my love to him to keep him happy. Hehe. Food. >< I'm looking for food. They had hotdogs and such at the party but I only managed to keep a hotdog down. Just didn't want everyone to see me sicker then a dog. The stupid candles on the cake kept blowing out because of the wind. Ashley's party was at Bear Creek Park. Nice outside. It kept raining on us though. Hehe. 

<b>In other news..</b>

I don't know where my boyfriend is. I swear, I kept calling his dorm but he never answered. He went out last night to his brothers I think but I dunno. I'm afraid to call his parents house but knowing him, that's where he is. That little shit. Oh well. I'll call him again tomorrow and if he still doesn't answer i'll just hurt him. 

Going to roleplay tonight with Josh if he ever gets back on. That little pain in the butt. I'm tired, very tired. *yawns* Might go nap for a bit again. I dunno.

Called John earlier around 11:30 or so. Woke that poor thing up. He enjoyed talking to me though. I told him to think of it this way ""Be happy you got to talk to your girlfriend (and hear her voice) before anyone else's."" He just laughed and agreed that it was a good thing. 

I think the whole ""9 weeks"" thing has gotten to me. I'm getting out of school in 9 weeks. Just gone and poofed from Truitt. It's scary to think about. Getting me a little nervous for another grade and my grade average. It's not doing so well. I'm having a rough year. Oh well.

Anyway, I went to work with Mark. Worked my ass off and talked to Chris and Brian today. They both are sweethearts. Strolled the mall and then helped out with the shelves and such in E.B. Kind of cool to just stroll without a care. Took a trip to Bath and Body Works, then to Walden Books. Got this book called ""Pride and Prejudice"" or something like that. 

Personally, i'm a horrible speller when I worked 8 hours and such. Well, I didn't work all that time but I did do a lot today. So it's time for bed soon. *grins*

I spoke with John tonight..I think I finally explained myself to him and it took a lot out of me. I told him stories, told him why I cared about him, told him he's my world..Most of all, told him to <i>never</i> lie about cheating on me (if he does, of course.) 

Though I know I have plenty of guys that will kill him (or beat him down) if he does and I get upset by it. *grins* Thanks guys. You all are the best in the world, remember that. ^^;; He's amazing, and I truely think i'm lucky to have him. Just to be with him, eh? Love him..*smiles* Good lord.

He brought up the whole day I asked him to be with me and i'm like ""9 days"" and he just stopped mid-sentence and laughed. He's like ""Are you counting or <i>something??</i>"" I giggled being me and nodded. ""Yeah, so what?"" Him and I put eachother in holes left and right. He made up for it though. Put up with me. 

This is yet another ramble about the love of my life. Good grief it's nice to say that. Anyone else have the joy in saying it also? Please IM me at MellieVellie or something..I would love to just talk to someone who is going through the same thing. Makes me smile.

The world is so lonely to some but then everything to another. *nod* Cute as hell. Hehe. Hmmm..did I say anything?

<center> <i>Nah...</i> </center>

It's after 1am and i'm tired. Quick recap on what went on today..Well, I got my hair colored finally. Josh is going to kill me when he finds out. *hides* My own brother is going to shoot me. Hide. Hehe. It's a nice pretty ash brown, John was a sweetheart and replied with ""I bet it is."" He's amazing. As i've said many times.

That was all, just kind of coughing and loving at once. Very tired. Time to go ni ni.

"event","<center> I might be sick again..</center>

I'm coughing continuously and it's not stopping. I've been trying to drink stuff and it feels that i'm slowly but surely coughing up blood. This isn't a good sign and my voice is fading. *sighs softly* I'll be fine though. Hopefully it will all pass over. *nod* I pray. 

Well, Josh is so sure that i'm crazy over John. It's not always a bad thing. *grins* I guess I am in a sense, I love him, he's a sweetheart. My world and so much more. But maybe this is just me, maybe it's a crush. I don't know. We'll see.

Hm, spent the last few hours talking to Joshie Washie. He's loveable, lets leave it at that. You can -not- not love him. Don't hurt yourself thinking about this guy, he's amazing. My brother and companion in one. I can go to him when I need someone to bitch back at me, tell me where to go, or just be there to cuddle with.

He's actually my only Christian friend which helps me out a lot. He brought faith back into my life and told me to keep going on because the lord is right beside you even if you think he left. I actually have looked at the mark's i've been leaving with my bike on the dirt and such, and I think I see his footprints. It's amazing. Thank you, Josh. Honestly, thank you.

Lets see, what's the best thing about him? I can honestly say he's -very- religious and enjoys making people happy. But that's not the best thing about him. I can't honestly pin just one thing on him. It's just not possible. He's an amazing roleplayer and enjoys doing many things. 

If you honestly had to break apart this guy and recieve one answer to what is most special about him in my opinion, it would probably be his heart. I've known this guy for awhile now and his heart has grown so much. It's amazing. No matter what goes on, he can always find a way out of things. Even if it does mean that he has to think negative and then change to a positive. 

He's a type that will make people happy but not because he feels sorry for them. He can stand to see people upset if they deserve it, even when he believes they don't. This guy has been amazing and brought ""life"" back into my life. He's changed me considerbly. He's a sweet guy.

Talking with him on the phone, is also a great thing. Him and I will just rant at eachother for hours and it wouldn't effect anything. Him and I are <b>extremely</b> close. I met this guy through roleplaying and he's had a major effect on me since then. 

I have many names for him. Joshie-Washie, Joshers, JoshJosh, CutieJosh, and many others. I think the word ""Amazing"" sums this guy up so well. He knows what to do and how to do it, and if he doesn't, he puts on a good show that he does. 

Whoever gets this guy as a husband is damn lucky. Trust me on this much.

"event","<center> What phone conversations do to you..</center>

Oh yes, what a joy. Well, it turns out I blew everything out of porportion and whatever someone did say to me (they said that he was screwing me over and didn't love me) isn't true and he -does- love me. We discussed the race thing, and he agrees that it's no use worrying about it when neither of us cares. Race is only skin-deep. You see it but then you don't feel it. 

And what I feel for John is something way more then skin-deep. It's in the heart, all of my heart. As I said, he's my world and so much more. I love him dearly and just gosh. It's amazing. I love him. I'm -in- love with him. I get both things. Love and family. It's a great thing. 

Him and I discussed -us- and how much we love eachother. Then flirted some and all. *giggles quietly* Flirted some more. Then I started watching ""Schindlers List"" again and that brought me into the whole ""Holocaust"" mood and such. It's a great movie, just scary. He said that he wanted to come and watch it with me. ^^ Then he also added soon after that he would have his eyes glued to the TV and be eating popcorn. *snickergiggles* That little pain in the butt. 

See how happy I am? This is good, no doubt. I don't know what was up with me. I get that way from time to time. Not too sure about things. One moment with this guy, my worst day turned into the best one. It's just amazing. His eyes, his voice. It all adds up to one thing. We all know what that is. And no, it isn't ""sex"" or ""porn"" for all those males out there reading. *eyes* Yeah, I know what you are thinking. I do have a -<b>boy</b>-friend dearies. It's love.

I should of taken care of this earlier, trusted my gut a little more, but it's all fine now. Jesse and I are happy, John and I are -extremely- happy. It's all perfect. Just..*smiles* it's just there. I feel it and I see it. He's amazing. He was actually pretty nice to me tonight. I told him what I wore to dinner and then mentioned how everyone says my unraveled blue/brown/tan sweatshirt brought out my eyes and his responce was ""Yeah, I bet. I wish I could be there to see you."" And I just melted. *smiles* 

Race is <b>only</b> skin-deep. No need to worry about a black dating a white or whatnot. I'm a little racked up about the whole thing with his father wanting him to marry a African American but it's not like i'm going to marry this guy. It's just how he grew up and how I grew up. I was attached to my mother like a bug, and him, well, he just was a trouble maker. We are a good match though.

I know, i'm rambling. I'm happy enough to ramble. This is what I needed, a new fresh start. Regather my life and just live on. *smiles* Oh yes, live on. See the sun rise and set. Just perfect. Life will never be totally perfect but I don't think it can get any better then right now. Knowing i'm loved and loving someone in return. That's what life is about, eh? Love, life, friendship, companions. It's all one thing. It's taken me already twenty minutes to write all this out. I might never stop. Way too much to write but not enough time to do it. I need to head to bed, i'm tired. *yawns* 

Well, it's safe to say that John is sweet, handsome, adorable, cute, cuddly and my precious teddy bear. I'll never give him up if it's up to me. Thank you John, thank you lord. Sleep well all. For another day is just around the corner.

Yes, this is what watching ""Crazy/Beautiful"" does to you. You start wondering if your life is worth it in this world when you actually are dating another from the opposite color. *snickers softly* I'm ashamed that i'm even -thinking- about this but I am. And it has me worried.

I'm dating a black-guy. African American to be correct. And sometimes, with my family and such, it feels that you know, possibly I shouldn't be with him. I love him, he is the world and so much more to me, but he's different. I'm never one to look at ""colors"" and now I am. I'm scared, is this normal??

My last African American guy I have dated, or even Hispanic, was two-three years ago and his name was Andy. I tell you, I just never thought about it until now. I hate being one to think about colors and even genders, but I guess it all is coming back. Being afraid since i'm white and then my family is Hispanic. It's a mix of things and *sighs* Just nevermind..

~The Gender Issue~

Honestly, i'm starting to think i'm Bi-sexual. I hate admiting it but i'm starting to think it. The whole ""Get the best of both worlds"" thing has gotten to me. Nontheless my attraction to any human out there that is willing to hug me, cuddle me. I don't know. The whole thing with John has now gotten the worst of me. I need to talk to him about this here in an hour. Discuss life with him. Possibly understand things.

First entry, first rant, first love..Well, some might know me as Mellie or possibly Mel(anie), depending on who you are and how well you know me. And this is my -other- journal since I needed a chance to just throw out everything in my mind and not have my mother all over me to read it. As i'm slowly telling everyone, soon i'm going to be posting my last entry which will finally explain everything I have ever felt about the people who were in my life. I'm starting over, fresh and new. Living a new life and opening up. It is too stressful on me, very stressful. My life has became a soap opera not a person's life. We all go through things and I think I have finally made up my mind. I will be posting this also up at <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/mellievellie/""></a> livejournal also to those who care to keep looking there. I will keep my livejournal's up, and well updated, but i'm leaving those behind who it doesn't really matter. You all know who you are. Sometimes we just need to vanish and live, and sadly, my time has come.

<center> Those flirty feelings..</center>

Well, isn't this something else we all go through. Spent at least two hours each night (Monday and Tuesday) talking to my boyfriend. Do you want to know how happy I am? Good lord, it's past the ball-field. I just feel happy and like i'm flying. My heart skips a beat -everytime- I hear his name. And I just fall. It's like i'm too happy or something. Is that possible? I don't know. Who knows anymore. It's all a blur when i'm around him. But it's one of those things where it is like I don't believe I have it. I just pray he feels the same way and is not leading me on. I need to take Ms. Mott's advice. ""Filter out all the negative things about a person and help them make them into a positive."" She's right, no use worrying about something that is just there. Help, is always better then not. Or in my opinion it is at least.

"event","Man, working at Tapex on campus is incredibly tiring. So. Many. People. There is an endless line...no breaks...just continuous drink-making. I don't even want to work there anymore because of the low pay! &gt;&lt;&nbsp;

But at least I'm never bored, since I'm always so busy. Three hours passed by without me even noticing it. Today seemed to have passed by in a blink of an eye. I don't like my schedule to be filled up like that though. It makes me sad to be too busy because I feel like life is passing without giving me time to enjoy it. I really think I need to organize my schedule out. Or at least try to become less stressful. 

I wonder if I'm living my life the way God wants me to. I wonder if I'm making the right decisions.&nbsp;I really wanted to focus on studying this quarter because I felt that my duty in college was to get an education. Yet... I don't feel like I have enough time to study. Maybe I just need to adjust myself to the loss of time that comes from working. Working for 3-4 hours today means that I don't have those 3-4 hours to watch tv, or goof off, or whatever. This idea makes me sad. XP 

Whatever. 

I will work hard and pray that things will work out! :) What can I lose anyway?"

"event","I've become pessimistic lately because I've been assuming the worse in things. Maybe it's due to things not going right.. so I just don't think that this part will go right, either.

I've been looking for a part time job all of fall quarter, but I kept getting turned down. I understood the reasons for them, though, but to get turned down after so many attempts is really discouraging. I still haven't got a reply from even Canyon Vista (a dining hall) when I&nbsp;turned in the resume a few days before winter break began. 

I've received the opportunity to work at Tapioca Express, but apparently, my schedule during winter break was not free enough for me to receive training on campus... so my ability to work has been questioned.&nbsp;The owner is also really busy, so she hasn't had the time to really try to schedule me in or keep me updated on the availability of the position. She didn't even&nbsp;call me when she told me she would.&nbsp;I began to wonder if maybe she didn't want me to work there because there were enough employees, and she was trying to quietly let me know that I was not going to get the job. I felt really sad and a bit of turmoil on the inside. Uncertainty causes anxiety... so I e-mailed her, asking her if I should still go in. I was quite surprised that she e-mailed me two minutes later. :) And it seems like she is really considering me working! I feel satisfied. I hope things go well.

I know what I really need to do is to give up everything to God, to know he will provide. There could've been reasons that I&nbsp;couldn't get a job, and no matter what, I need to praise God because he has blessed me. But it's difficult. I can't help but feel scared and continue being pessimistic. I came into school, this school-year, thinking that getting a job would be very simple. It wasn't, so I just don't want to fail in this one oppotunity that I was given. I have to remember, though, there are always other things I can do. I can always volunteer, or I can always just study more. I can spend more time developing hobbies. I can enrich my time with other things besides watching TV or going on the Internet. 

I really want to love and appreciate this gift of life that God has given me. Even though life in heaven is for eternity, life on Earth is not only a test, but also a gift. Most importantly, I need to love God. 

I need to focus on that. Love. God. 

Then I won't feel anxious and be pessimistic. :)"

If that's how it is, maybe I should look for more friends who will appreciate me. At least I do have a few who really do accept my personality. Or maybe should I just downtone my personality? I don't know. I miss being home. Funny thing is, I never had these sort of issues at home.&nbsp; Maybe my issue is with one person only.

"event","<p>So in response to Steven's post about anime women, I will make a post on hot Korean celebrites. I hope this will be enlightening.<br /></p><div class=""ljcut"" text=""Read more...with pictures...lots of them""><strong>Hyun Bin<br /><img alt="""" src=""http://i3.photobucket.com/albums/y65/aznwhitefire/HyunBin2.jpg"" /><br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://i3.photobucket.com/albums/y65/aznwhitefire/HyunBin5.jpg"" /><br /><br /></strong>Hyun Bin is an actor, and he may be best well known as the rich restaurant owner (aka the male lead) in ""My Lovely Sam Soon"" / ""My Name is Kim Sam Soon"". I have to admit. He is very CUTE. &gt;&lt; His role as a rich boy fit him well because he looks good dressed as a rich boy. He looks very good in suits and dress shirts and slacks. He's waaaaay too cute. T-T I wish I was&nbsp;this cute.<br /><br /><strong>Siwon Choi<br /><img alt="""" src=""http://i3.photobucket.com/albums/y65/aznwhitefire/Siwon2.jpg"" /><br /><br /></strong>First of all, I have to say, this guy has killer abs. Yes, it is true. Just look at the <a href=""http://www.asianbite.com/KoreaImages/Super-Junior-80-Choi-Si-won.jpg"">pictures from Super Junior's Don't Don photo shoot</a>. I won't post it here to keep this post rated G. :) So Siwon is a member of Super Junior, the popular 13 member boy band in Korea. Now, he is also part of Super Junior M, which is the Chinese group of Super Junior, but this group only has 7 members, where 5 are from the original Super Junior, and 2 are new. He also has a major part in the Chinese movie ""A Battle of Wits"" with Andy Lau. I first really started to like this guy from watching Super Junior Full House, which is about how a few of the Super Junior members had to host a visit for 2 American girls/women. Siwon was a gentleman, and really sweet and funny. XD I like him . :D<br /><br /><strong>Big Bang<br /><img alt="""" src=""http://i3.photobucket.com/albums/y65/aznwhitefire/bigbang10.jpg"" /><br /><br /></strong>I love Big Bang. They are just so ADORABLE. They're a Korean ""hip hop"" group. Their music is okay, but ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=57GPGTOwSPE&amp;feature=related"">Lies</a>"" and ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGgPeAew_T0"">Last Farewell</a>"" are really good.&nbsp; Truthfully, I don't think Koreans&nbsp;can be&nbsp;truly hip hop because hip hop embodies so much American culture, and I'm not so sure if Koreans have really made a ""Korean hip hop"". It still seems to copy a lot of what the Americans are doing, which some don't even consider hip hop anymore. Koreans can DANCE, though. And breaking, which is a serious part of hip hop culture, Koreans can do... well...like fantastically -I love them so much - well.&nbsp;But anyway,&nbsp;I like the way Big Bang dresses, and they're&nbsp;really cute and silly. I watch too many <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqPMy2n0Mg"">youtube videos</a> of them. XD&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>G-Dragon (Big Bang's leader)<br /><img alt="""" src=""http://i3.photobucket.com/albums/y65/aznwhitefire/G-Dragon.jpg"" /><br /><br /></strong>So this is the guy who wrote and composed ""Lies"". Pretty talented. I think he's pretty immature considering how he's the leader, but I love him so much! &gt;&lt; He's really adorable... lol. He may not seem incredibly good-looking at first, but he has a lot of charisma, and he's funny. I enjoy watching him speak on the Korean show <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_04QjBYDD2E"">Ya Shim Man Man</a>. And dude, he's only 19 years old...<br /><br /><strong>Tae Yang (Big Bang)<br /><img alt="""" src=""http://i3.photobucket.com/albums/y65/aznwhitefire/TaeYang.jpg"" /><br /><br /></strong>This&nbsp;guy has mad singing skills. I believe he's the main singer for Big Bang. He's also opening for Alicia Keys at her concert in Korea. I don't know much about his personality, though. He seems to be pretty mature, since he doesn't really get caught up in G-Dragon and Seung Ri's antics. I just think he's really good-looking in this picture. &gt;&lt;<br /><br /><strong>Seung Ri (Big Bang)<br /><img style=""WIDTH: 636px; HEIGHT: 412px"" height=""428"" alt="""" width=""667"" src=""http://i3.photobucket.com/albums/y65/aznwhitefire/TaeYangandSeungRi2.jpg"" /><br /><br /></strong>Seung Ri (the guy on the right)&nbsp;is the baby of the group (meaning he's the youngest). He's only 17 years old right now (December 12, 1990)! Personally, I think he's the cutest in the group - lookswise - but G-Dragon is still my favorite. G-Dragon loves teasing Seung Ri. They seem to get along well. :)<br /><br /><strong>DBSK<br /><img alt="""" src=""http://i3.photobucket.com/albums/y65/aznwhitefire/DBSK.jpg"" /><br /><br /><img height=""511"" alt="""" width=""680"" src=""http://i3.photobucket.com/albums/y65/aznwhitefire/DBSK2.jpg"" /><br /><br /></strong>These are pretty good pictures, but not their best pictures. I'm too lazy too look up pictures now. Anyway, I think Hero (Jaejoong) is the best looking, and I think YunHo is the coolest. (Hero is the guy with the blonde hair, second row in the second picture, and YunHo is the guy with the red jacket, second row in the second picture). DBSK is pretty cool. My cousin laughed at me when I told her that I liked them because now, they're pretty popular in Japan, too, known as Tohoshinki. Yunho can also dance. Ah... he is a good dancer. :D And a good leader. I think it's funny how Korean boy bands have ""leaders"". <br /><br />So yes. Korean guys who I think are really hot. Truthfully, I don't know of many Korean male celebrities.. well, I do learn a lot from watching Korean variety shows, but yeah. These guys are hot, and mostly just ADORABLE. &gt;&lt; I wish I was acquainted with them or related to them or something. They are just too cool. :D <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>&nbsp;<br />I really like how Korean male&nbsp;celebrities dress up a lot and do their hair nicely. However, if I was to meet a guy who was as extravagant looking as a celebrity, I would probably think he's gay. I don't know. I guess it would depend on his personality. I can't imagine a guy who would spend hours dressing up and doing his hair to talk about anything other than clothes and hair. But maybe I am stereotyping. :P Anyway, I would forgive the celebrities for this because they have their own stylists. I think most of the celebrities walk around in normal clothes most of the day. :D But those are just my thoughts because I never met one before. &gt;&lt;"

"event","Just today, I sort of realized how fortunate I am that my parents are willing to pay all of my college tuition. A boy knocked on my door today, and he asked me if I could buy a subscription to Mercury News that lasts only for 45 days. He says that if I buy the subscription, he can receive scholarship money. He seemed so timid and nervous when he explained the process to me, and I just felt so sorry for him; he does not seem like he's used to going around door to door, selling subscriptions. And he was really desperate for me to buy the subscription. He wouldn't stop talking, saying how he'll be the one to send the newspapers at 4:30AM, and if I don't pick them up, he'll recycle them, and that he'll leave his phone number in case there are any problems. It really made me sort of sad.&nbsp;
So I bought the subscription, even though my dad said no.&nbsp;
And now, I just feel a little bit worried. I wonder if I'll be home to cancel the subscription (since I'll be in China), and I wonder if my dad will get mad at me if he has to cancel the subscription for me. Not only that, but I realized that I'll be receiving the newspapers when I'll be in China, so the whole point of getting newspapers... is pointless. ahahah. Oh well. I shouldn't worry. Things will work out. At least I didn't give out my credit card information, so the newspaper company can't automatically charge me money. Cash is the way to go.&nbsp;
I just tend to worry over new experiences.
Ah...
And this kid just made me realize that I should make better use of my time than just watching tv all day. :T"

"event","What was I doing 10 years ago? 
What grade was I in when I was 9 years old? Oh well. I was in elementary school and my days seem to all mesh together back then. Elementary school was pretty awesome, but since I was 9, i think I was in my first elementary school in Richardson before I moved to Plano. I used to play tag a lot, and&nbsp; I had been the fastest girl in my class. I had a crush on this one Asian guy, and funny thing is, he turned out to be the childhood friend of one of my friends in middle school. She showed me a picture with a bunch of people, and I recognized him. LOL. It was interesting. :) She asked him about me and he said that he only remembers this Asian girl with glasses. My best friends were Jasmine and Aurora. I wonder if they still remember me. When I moved, I told them that I would keep in touch, but I never did. It's my fault because they would have no idea how to keep in touch in me.&nbsp; In our playground, there are these massive cylinder- like things we could climb onto. We would either hide inside it and just talk, or&nbsp;climb on top of it and talk. :) Man, I miss elementary school. I wish I could find a way to meet up with my old friends. I wonder how they have changed.

What are 5 things on my to-do list for today?
1. Go to dance class for 3 hours
2. Work on my paper for archaeology class and write in the discussion board.
3. Go to the library
4. Call Kexin
5. Read the Bible

Snacks that I enjoy. . . 
Jasmine milk tea with pearls, chips, peaches (because it's like the only fruit my mom buys), French fries, Dr. Pepper soda, Grilled cheese sandwiches, Yan yan crackers... I'm not much of a snacker because my parents don't buy me snacks unless I asked for them specifically.

Things I would do if I were a billionaire: 
Buy a house for my parents, put aside some money for college, either give to charity or start up my own charity, and invest the rest.

Places I have lived: 
Texas: Richardson (near Dallas), Plano
California: Fremont, San Diego (because&nbsp;I go to school there now)

Jobs I have had: 
Great Mall: I worked in this really shady toy store that I forgot the name of. It sort of sucked because I had to work really hard for very little pay. I felt really sad for one of my coworkers. He was this really cool guy from Germany, and he was sort of helping my boss out by working for him, but he really didn't get much from the job. I also met a girl named Tamina from my job who is the freaking NICEST person in the world! OMG. I love her. But I never kept in contact. :( I hope I'll see her around if I walk around the Great Mall.
Great Mall, Vitamin World: I worked there for like 4-5 months when I turned 18 (because you have to be at least 18 to work there). My manager liked me because she's my neighbor, and I really like all my coworkers. They were really cool and we would always talk about stuff - like personal things. :)
Great Mall, my mom: So my mom opened a cart-thing that sells jewelry, and I was forced to work for her. I started working for her the summer before senior year started. Working there was pretty boring because there wasn't much to do. It was only fun when I actually sold something. And I never actually got paid. My parents would give me money if I'm like ""Can I have money to go to ..."" but they never actually paid me a salary. LOL. Oh well, not like they actually made money, and I got a whole lot of free jewelry loot, anyway. :D

So considering how the only places I've worked at were at the Great Mall, I hate the Great Mall. I really hate it. :P

Okay, well, I know the reason is because I don't practice and I have terrible upper body strength, and I still need to learn the actual footwork that don't require hands.....but I still feel frustrated. :( I just wish I had an empty dance room where I could practice. Or at least a dance room containing people I feel comfortable with.&nbsp;In this respect, I miss SD. I sort of want to as my dance instructor how to break, but I don't really know what I want to learn. I just want to learn EVERYTHING.
And I realized that I don't love breaking because I think it looks cool. I think it's BEAUTIFUL. like a freakin piece of artwork. Sometimes, I like it so much I want to cry at its beauty. And it's something I really have an interest in learning. After trying out both popping and locking, I figured that both look freaking cool, but I don't have much interest in learning either extensively; well, popping can be used for everything... so I guess I would learn it nonetheless... I just don't have the same passion for those as I do for breaking. &gt;&lt; Ah.

"event","<p>so... i think a long time ago, i either made a post about manga or anime saying how empty i felt after finishing the manga/anime. well, i also feel the same towards drama. maybe i just end up to emotionally attached to it since i end up watching all of it at once, not giving myself any breaks. i finished ""my name is kim sam soon"" just now; i finished 16 hours of korean drama in 2 days... i pretty much didnt do anything in between. and it frustrates me that the drama is over. ahhh!&nbsp; i just feel so sad when this emotional rollercoaster is over.&nbsp;<br /><br />i dont know why i watched a drama. it just makes me feel depressed and tired. but it's a bittersweet feeling because my heart hurts so much for the characters... lol. i really dont have a life. &gt;&lt;&nbsp;<br /><br />well, i feel better after typing this out. i dont think im going to watch drama in a while.&nbsp; it's too draining. and i still need to get started on that summer school homework that is due tonight. o_O i cant get over procrastinating.<br /><br />ahh. so much to do in such a short summer!&nbsp;<br />i want to :<br />read NT<br />learn how to play the guitar - even though i would really rather play the piano... ahh.. i want to so much that i want to stab myself. with something blunt. i think piano &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; guitar. ok. <br />draw things for friends - i told steven that i will make him a comic book<br />practice the violin<br />learn more on breaking<br />practice japanese. and dude, it would be so amazing if i can learn some simple korean. <br /><br /><br />but i procrastinate on these too. &gt;&lt;<br />darn korean entertainment is just too impressive.<br /><br />i have 6 weeks to accomplish my goals before CHINA. woot! im really thankful that i agreed to go to china when i didnt feel like it some months ago.<br />and my mom tells me that it's good she bought my ticket earlier. due to high gas prices, airplane tickets skyrocketed. o_O yay me.<br />if only i can work. then i can make some money. :P<br />and yay! japan over winter break. hopefully.&nbsp;<br />AHHH i want to play the piano.<br />typing out my plans really encourage me to start on what i need to do. :) i should make schedules and lists for myself more often. </p>"

"event","<p>i don't really like dramas all the much. in the beginning (for the first 4 episodes), they are usually pretty addicting, but i can never actually finish watching one. i get bored with it and i just stop. but man. ""my name is kim sam soon"" is so SWEET. im totally addicted to it, and i want to finish it through. it's so well written... and the scenes just make a lot of sense. i also like the character developments. there is really no person that the viewer can actually hate. all of the characters have their own problems, even if the problems are because of each other; i.e. the viewer would feel really sorry for the male lead's ex girlfriend even though the viewer may want him to get together with the sam soon. the viewer feels so much pity for the ex girlfriend that the viewer may actually want the male lead and the ex-gf to get back together. &gt;&lt; ah... it's so sweet of a drama. and it makes me want to go to a cake shop and each cake and drink coffee. how come there arent shops like that in the u.s. but they have them in asia?&nbsp;<br />the drama also makes me want to marry a nice rich man. lol. the drama is hilarious&nbsp;and hyun bin is incredibly good-looking. o_O&nbsp;<br />i just feel like crying every few minutes when i watch this drama.<br /><br />i have to admit though. it's pretty funny how all dramas are based on love, and how hard humans try to find love, yet the only love we really need is from God. God can give us this love that we thirst for.&nbsp;<br />i was thinking about how nice it would be to fall in love like in the drama, but then i began to wonder why i wanted to fall in love. and i&nbsp; realized that i always disregard God's love. :P</p>"

"event","i really need to start unpacking. mostly, i just unpacked my clothes, and i separated the summer clothes from the winter clothes. :) but man, there is so much more to unpack.
when my parents put all my luggage in the car, the car was so packed, that it looked like i was moving my house or something. the whole window in the back was blocked, so my dad couldnt see anything behind him. he had to ask me mom and me to look at the side lanes to see if there were any cars so he can change lanes. it was crazy. and a little bit dangerous. i prayed to god that we would get home safely, and we did. :D
friday night, i learned about in n out's secret menus from clive. im excited to go to in n out now. animal-styled hamburger with chilis ftw.
i am level 69 in wow, halfway to level 70. im excited. :)
and surprisingly, when i came home, my parents didnt even mention my weight. they didnt seem to mind when i ate sweet things... and they didn't really say anything about losing weight at all. the only thing my mom talked about was my skin. :T she said that she'll buy me this $70 face wash kit for my face, and it's not pro-active. weird.
i think i've improved in brawl.
and my dad is awesome for updating the graphics card for this humongous monitor. he tells me i can play wow on it. it's strange how accepting my parents have become over my gaming ever since college started. :T&nbsp;
and yeah.. my mom is making 7 dishes now for father's day. lawl. i didnt give my&nbsp; dad anything; well, except for my time. i went shopping with him FOR him yesterday... i was so tired. and the only reason i went with him was because i told him i wanted to eat pho, and he was like ""okay, and i'll stop by the mall, too."" i didn't expect everything to take 5 hours. T-T"" the pho was good, though. and i got to go to sogo, too. :D :D :D
im so excited&nbsp;for my socal + norcal friends who dont live in fremont, to visit. :D :D :D :D :D :D my mom is already wondering what food to prepare. korean bbq? hot pot? any suggestions? and of course, anyone living in fremont is welcome, too. except for hobos. *cough, ernest, cough* j/k! XD and ernest doesn't even read lj.
i just feel like&nbsp;writing some random things since i want to take a break from wow."

And Jesus is just so humble and faithful, that he follows his Father's commands. Dying on&nbsp;a cross was not something that Jesus wanted to do.

"event","okay, so after reading steven's comment in my xanga, i begin to feel like writing. 
Did I even doubt God's existence? No. Never. 

""how strong is your faith if you don't even question it? 

A healthy dose of doubt can prove healthy, especially for testimony. 

That's why I know God exists, and that's how I can tell non-believers why I think God exists."" 

But how can I force myself to doubt God's existence if I just don't? I guess I can think why I do believe in God because that is an important question, but oh golly, just imagining that God doesn't exist makes me want to cry. If God didn't exist, then my life would have no meaning... I think I would die for my belief. 
There are times when I doubt if God would pull through for me. I sometimes lack faith in God. I lack faith in school, the reason why I'm in school, my future, the person I like and what that means. Most of all, I lack faith in that he will fill up my loneliness. That is why I rely only on my friends most of the time. There's nothing wrong with relying on friends. But, again, I think it is sin when time spent with friends is placed before time spent with God, that I rely on my friends more than God. This is worshipping another idol, which sounds strange because the most popular idols are school and money. One never really imagine spending time with&nbsp;friends - especilly Christian friends - can be considered idolatry. But how is that different from spending too much time on facebook? XD 
Anyway, back to my point. So why do I believe in God? I guess because it does give me a purpose. When I was little,&nbsp;I tried to imagine my life and I was actually able to schedule it all out: I will go to college, go to grad school, work, get married, have a family, grow old, retire, die.&nbsp; 
It just sounded terrible and boring.&nbsp; 
I then began to understand one of my friends who said that he wanted to die when he becomes twenty-something. I would want to die when I turned 40, or something. Life just seemed so dull. Actually, I would probably want to die right now if there was no God. There is just too much pain in the world to go through, knowing that there is no love like God's. I don't need human love, but I need God' love. And I can see God's love in people, but it isn't human love. It's still God's. 
Do you know that everything we have is God's. Anything we give to him is not our's but still his. Yet all he asks for is our trust love faith. And he means the best for us. Why can't we accept that. Why do we doubt? 
I will try to stop doubting now.&nbsp;

John 12:25
""The man who loves his life will lose it, while the man who hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal life. Whoever serves me must follow me; and where I am my servant also will be. My Father will honor the one who serves me."""

"event","The story of Steven's Future:

grace: my mom was telling me to eat healthy on the phone 10 times.&nbsp;
me: i'm just going to make my kid play sports, then he cant be fat.
steven:&nbsp; well, my kid is going to be a fatass. i'm going to feed him twinkies all the time.
me: *to grace* we should tell his future girlfriend this. then she won't like him anymore.
steven: well, what if my future girlfriend is a fatass, and she admits it and is okay with it.
grace and i look at steven shocked.
me: this reminds me of a nursery rhyme where there's this one really thin guy who can only eat thin things and a really fat woman who can only eat fatty things, and they're married.
grace: my sister has a nursey rhyme that goes ""fat and skinny when to bed. fat rolled on skinny and skinny was dead.""
(LMFAO)
me: steven's going to die.
steven: wouldn't it be funny if the guy's like *makes choking noises"" and he's saying, i love you too honey.
grace and i laugh at steven.
me: steven, if you really marry a very very fat woman, we're not gonna be your friends anymore.
steven: it's okay. i still have my fatass lady.
me: actually, i think steven's going to be a fatass when he grows older. his mom said that there was a good possibly, since his uncle used to be thin like him but is now fat. he's going to have a fatass family.

---- some time later... i forgot what went on here... multiple things were said and&nbsp; thrown. j/k about the thrown part. ---

me: we should tell steven's future girlfriend that he called her a fatass.&nbsp;
steven: i never said that she'll be a fatass. just that there's the possibility. im leaving my choices open.
me: she's going to be a fatass. akekekekeke.

Steven is going crazy because he is editing a video for DTAB, and he hasn't slept for three days. he had to edit the whole video 3 times because after almost finishing the first time, his laptop crashed. and today, when he completed EVERYTHING, his external harddrive was accidently disconnected from his laptop when he was saving the video, and everything got automatically thrown away into the trash and he had to restart again...
which is why he is becoming frustrated and is going crazy.
he even said tuck.
poor steven though. :&lt; it's already 4:53 am, and he's not nearly done at all...."

"event","<p>I've been trying to find one beast to kill for the past hour... and I still can't find it. It's really pissing me off. :T<br />Oh well. I just downloaded cosmos. Maybe that'll help me... I'll just play some more tomorrow.<br />Anyway, yesterday, Steven gave his shoes to a homeless man named Robert. We were at the bus stop, just coming out of the movie theater and then Ralph's (a grocery store), and Robert was by the bus stop. Vannie seemed to know who he was, and we greeted Robert. Robert then began to lament to us about how someone stole his shoes and how much it sucked since it was memorial day, and he was a veteran. We all looked at him, agreeing with him over how much that sucked, but not really knowing what else to say. When the bus came 10 minutes later, Steven took off his shoes and toed them towards Robert. Robert was incredibly joyful. What worried me was if the shoes would fit.... but anyways, I think it's the love shown that was important. At least Robert will know that someone cares. :T<br /><br />This reminded me of this one story I heard in church about&nbsp;a missions trip. Some people were making a routine trip to Mexico and they brought some sandwiches and basic stuff (socks, I guess), but when they got there, the people questioned them. The people asked if the missionaries would give them the shoes they were wearing or the clothes on their backs. The missionaries were hesitant.&nbsp;<br /><br />While looking at Robert, I was thinking about this story. Would someone give him shoes? I didn't want to give him my shoes. First of all, I knew that they wouldn't fit him. But mainly the reason was because I was wearing my Air Force 1s. These shoes are NICE and EXPENSIVE and LIMITED EDITION. I did not want to separate from them. If they were Robert's size, I probably wouldn't give the shoes to him.&nbsp;<br />But thinking about that, why wouldn't I? Truthfully, I don't have that much of an attachment to my shoes right now because I had them for a year. I would probably gladly give them away if I knew that the receiver needed shoes and would really appreciate that these are Air Force 1s.&nbsp; Yet... I don't think that's a good enough reason. Appreciation should not come before need. Love will not always be appreciated or even wanted, but it still must be given. I need to be humbled.<br /><br />I also need to rely on God. Right now, I'm beginning to feel worried about biology. I have to thank God for my amazing math grade, but I'm really fretting over biology. This was the class that I was supposed to be GOOD at. - the class that I was suppose to LOVE. Yet I never read or bother to go to lecture and discussion. I know it's my fault. But I don't know how to right it. I just really need to rely on God... I'm just too afraid to. I can't rely on myself, though, because what can I do? I can study, but how will I know that studying will let me pass?&nbsp;<br />Why are grades just bothering me so much? I thought that I had already given that up. There is still so much for me to let go.<br /><br />I also need to let go of some of my friends. These days, I spend more time with my friends than God. When I feel lonely, I yearn for my friends. I spend hours with them... I can't seem to do anything without them. I don't want to talk to anyone but them...<br />My loving relationships are beginning to hinder me.&nbsp;I rely on them more than God. This is definitely a problem that I need to deal with. Because I just feel so helpless when I'm not with my friends.&nbsp;<br /><br />God please help me.<br /><br />Right now I just feel so helpless overall. I feel helpless in school, in my relationships, in my life. I just don't know what to do. And the only reason I'm falling apart is because I don't rely on God... I feel so scared.&nbsp;<br /><br />And maybe from an outsider's view, nothing even seems that serious. Everything seems to be going fine enough that I shouldn't worry. But I do. And I need God.</p>&nbsp;<br />-----Edit-------- (like 1 hour later)<br />After reading a hilarious blog&nbsp;post by one of my friends, I realized that friends can really pull you up. I should not put them in place of God, but my friends are still indispensable. GOLLY. I love everyone so much.<br />The most important commandment is to love God. But it's impossible to not love God's children, while in loving God. XDDDDDDD I feel so happy now.<br />but I'm still really uncertain about my grades... :T must pray some more. sometimes, it's good having friends who do not care about grades.. okay, maybe having one friend who doesn't care about grades."

Doesn't that really remind you of Hitler? It's sad that the Israelites are being blamed for not doing anything wrong. :T<br /><br /><span class=""sup"" id=""en-NIV-1544"">11</span> So they put slave masters over them to oppress them with forced labor, and they built Pithom and Rameses as store cities for Pharaoh. <span class=""sup"" id=""en-NIV-1545"">12</span> But the more they were oppressed, the more they multiplied and spread; <strong>so the Egyptians came to dread the Israelites <span class=""sup"" id=""en-NIV-1546"">13</span> and worked them ruthlessly. </strong><span class=""sup"" id=""en-NIV-1547"">14</span> They made their lives bitter with hard labor in brick and mortar and with all kinds of work in the fields; in all their hard labor the Egyptians used them ruthlessly.&nbsp;<br /><br />Were the Egyptians just afraid of the Israelite's numbers?&nbsp; But why?&nbsp; I guess this could connect with slavery in the Americas.&nbsp; In some places, (I forgot where exactly, but we learned this in AP US Histoy,) the slaves greatly outnumbered the white people.&nbsp; The laws above slaves were really strict, I guess because of this fear.&nbsp; The Egyptians do not want the Israelites to overrun them in numbers, but then I wonder why the Egyptians just don't run the Israelites out of the country, like through war or something?&nbsp; Earlier, the Pharoh did not want the Israelites to grow in numbers because he feared that they would join the enemies, but I don't think slave-driving the Israelites would help the situation... Instead of slavery, he could have been like Hitler and did some mass killing.&nbsp; I guess the Pharoh tried, just not in much of an extreme way:<br /><br />&nbsp;<span class=""sup"" id=""en-NIV-1548"">15</span> The king of Egypt said to the Hebrew midwives, whose names were Shiphrah and Puah, <span class=""sup"" id=""en-NIV-1549"">16</span> ""When you help the Hebrew women in childbirth and observe them on the delivery stool, <strong>if it is a boy, kill him; but if it is a girl, let her live</strong>.""&nbsp;<br /><br />But why let the girl live?&nbsp; Maybe the Egyptians did not mind that the women married into Egyptian families, and I guess the girls could still be servants.&nbsp; That would be useful in a way.&nbsp; I wonder if the Egyptians also enslaved other groups instead of the Israelites.&nbsp; A class on this would be so good....<br /><br /><span class=""sup"" id=""en-NIV-1550"">17</span> The midwives, however, <strong>feared God and did not do what the king of Egypt had told them to do</strong>; they let the boys live.&nbsp;<br />...<br />&nbsp;<span class=""sup"" id=""en-NIV-1553"">20</span> <strong>So God was kind to the midwives</strong> and the people increased and became even more numerous. <span class=""sup"" id=""en-NIV-1554"">21</span> And because the midwives feared God, he gave them families of their own.&nbsp;<br /><br />I really liked how they feared God.&nbsp; I try to imagine this in reality, and even though the word is ""fear"", I'm sure that they felt their hearts stirred when they saw the helpless infants. :T I dunno.&nbsp; This is what I imagine, and they do risk their lives in letting the boys live since the Pharoh can easily kill them.&nbsp; I'm surprised that he didn't.&nbsp; It must be of God's doing.&nbsp; But yeah...<br /></div><br /><br />Truthfully, I don't know if I got much out of this passage except that a lot of similar things happened in the past.&nbsp; But all of those connections have already been made. :T&nbsp; I remember reading how when African slaves became Christian, they connected themselves with the Israelites. and so on.&nbsp;<br />Anyhoo.. yeah. :P"

"event","<p>dang i love korean celebrities. :D they are just so freaking adorable and good-looking. even though 1tym is a hip hop group, they're soooooo ADORABLE. XD XD XD<br />anyway, i really believe that&nbsp; i love dancing. but only if i can find people to teach me and do it with me. i even stopped playing WOW. when i go on WOW now i get so bored. :T<br />also, i think God works in a funny way.&nbsp; Two days ago, i told 4 of my friends who were also doing Kunfusion that i thought this one guy was cute (and I was really embarrassed about telling them because the guy was shorter than me, and it's harder to tell others who know and see the guy all the time that he's cute). lol. it was pretty uneventful, no one really reacted...except now, everytime the guy is mentioned or i see him at a KF practice, scott keeps poking me and giving me weird looks. lol. &gt;&lt;&nbsp; yeah.&nbsp; well, after i told them this, i kind of dont feel as interested in the guy anymore... so... yeah.&nbsp; and im glad that im not as interested anymore because i never even talked to the darn guy before, so i really dont know anything about his character or even him. i just think he's a freaking awesome dancer. too much charisma, man. XD<br />well, i realized that my true love is God.&nbsp; :T<br />golly, but sometimes i do want a boyfriend to hang out with and hold hands. lol.&nbsp;<br />but i also dont think i really want one.&nbsp; it seems too time consuming. yet this might be because i just havent found the right guy.&nbsp; ahaha. i wonder what god's plan is for me.&nbsp; maybe i wont get a bf until im 30....&nbsp;<br /><br />YAAAAAAAAAAAAYYYY! 1tym and big bang are so hot. :D :D :D<br />my goal is to marry g-dragon from big bang... but it'll never happen. :( because i cant speak korean. dang, i wish i was half korean.</p>"

"event","It's been awhile, so I think I should post about something.&nbsp; It's always good to write thoughts down.
Anyway, hum... I'm REALLY excited about Kunfusion.&nbsp; Dude, I realized that&nbsp;I really like practicing dancing.&nbsp; I also realized that I'm a bit of a perfectionist, so I'm really into practicing until everything is right. I'm in such a mood for dancing right now that I don't think I can study.&nbsp; Kind of sad... Anyway, yeah.. I don't know.&nbsp;
I have to work on my facial expression when dancing, which is kind of funny.&nbsp; I realized&nbsp;that it's really hard... because sometimes the feeling that I believe dances are supposed to give off... maybe need more.&nbsp; For example, we have a tetris dance that's pretty funny, but it's mostly about locking, so I thought we were supposed to have a sort of blank expression, since we're tetris pieces. :P But I guess we're supposed to smile and look like we're having fun, or the locking would just be to bland?&nbsp; I dont know.&nbsp; I guess I need to practice in front of the mirror.&nbsp;&nbsp;
I really wish I was good at dancing.&nbsp; I guess I'll work in it more.&nbsp; But I shouldn't be worried about impressing other people.&nbsp; I should just make myself happy.&nbsp; Today, we were split into groups and we performed in front of everyone else in the group.&nbsp; Some people got complimented, and I was like...&nbsp;"" Why don't I get complimented?&nbsp;""&nbsp; Yes, the people who were complimented were good, but I dont know... :(&nbsp;&nbsp;
SO I will practice more.&nbsp;&nbsp; Because I really think I want to dance.
I think I'm most frustrated and most excited with Kunfusion!!!&nbsp; Mostly excited though. :D"

"event","<p>&nbsp; So I was reading this book for women's group because&nbsp;I cant concentrate on studying:<br />""Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.&nbsp; Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls"" (Matthew 11:28-29)<br /><br />Finally, I was able to give up my burdens of school to God.&nbsp; I realized that everything that has happened and will happen is in his hands.&nbsp; I shouldn't wonder why I didn't get into Berkeley and ""what if""'s.&nbsp; I should not worry about my finals, and about failing them, making myself sick with anxiety in studying (which doesnt help anyway, since it prevents me from concentrating).&nbsp; If I fail, then God meant for it to be.&nbsp; There is a reason, and I should and will follow God through ""failure"", in the world's sense, or through success.&nbsp; If I am to get just average grades and to not get into a grand graduate school, or to not even go to graduate school, or to fail school right now... it is all God's plan for me.&nbsp; If I fail now, I can go to community college. Whatever.&nbsp; </p><p>And with this burden off of my shoulders, I feel so happy.&nbsp; I feel like I can write and study however I want.&nbsp; I am in no hurry to get things done.&nbsp; God will provide all.</p><p>I still have to study, though.&nbsp; But I now study with the intent to learn (since I must be in college for&nbsp;a reason) rather to get that A.</p><p>Thank you, God.</p>"

"event","OMFG OMFG OMFG. i love my family. my cousin is in the U.S. right now... AND IN MY HOUSE! i so want to see her. :( she called me and we had such a nice conversation. i feel like when i go back, im not gonna do anything except hang out with her. lol. sorry shane, matt, and clive, i might ditch you guys. &gt;:D lol. j/k.
dude, my cousin's husband likes m-flo, too! WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYEEEEEEE! ehehehe. im so happy. :D
and i get a yukata.

anyway, hm... im getting more and more hyped up about breakdancing.&nbsp; whenever i see people do it, im happy. however, when i try, it's still so hard for me. :( i mean, that's expected, but it's just so frustrating, especially since im really weak. i mean im REALLY weak. i have no upper body strength, so i get so tired even doing the simplest moves such as the coffee grinder or the 6-step.&nbsp; and i cant even do my freezes too often cuz my wrist gets tired. i know i should just practice a lot and work out a lot.... BUT I JUST WANT TO GET BETTER NOW! i will practice though. i just need to vent a little. lol.

yeaaaaaaaaaaah. i think i care more about dancing than school. school's not important at all. but when i talk to my parents, i feel so guilty. my mom was like ""you're gonna get all A's, right?"" and i replied ""Don't expect too much, mom.&nbsp; It's bad for your health."" I only dared say that because my cousin was there. truthfully, i felt awful.&nbsp; i knew that it was possible for me to get all A's during the school year if i tried.&nbsp; argh. but i just cant get myself to open my book. im serious when i say i put my lowest amount of effort. i dont even read my damn books until the day of the midterm, and i can still make it out with a B.&nbsp; Now if I had actually read and reviewed and studied... i dont know.&nbsp;
my mom said for me to get all A+'s on my finals... I said I'll try.&nbsp;&nbsp;

I think I'll just try my best.&nbsp; No need to worry about A's or whatnot. My best is probably even better than that. lol. probably not.

so this week, i will only concentrate on eating (free food), working out.breakdancing, and studying! NO ANIME AND DRAMA AND GAMES! and only very LITTLE facebook. i must live in the library. *sigh*
i only study for the love of my parents. :T&nbsp;"

"event","&nbsp;yay! finally finished my last midterm. :D it's crazy how i have a chem midterm the week before finals. i think i bombed this midterm, though, because i didnt really study the concepts, just the math... and i only did the reading today (the day of the midterm), so... i dont expect an A. maybe a C. :T oh well.&nbsp;i'll just try harder on the final. and an 85% in my class is a A-.&nbsp; 

im getting more excited about dancing. :) i went to practice breakdancing with justin. yesterday was the first time i actually practiced for like a whole quarter, and man... did i suck. LOL. but justin was nice about showing me some moves and telling me what i was doing wrong. i also met a guy named ron. this guy is AMAZING. he learned wushu for only 4 months, competed against other colleges, and got gold for his division. breakdancing can be useful. :D anyway, he was really nice to give me tips and teach me how to do a cartwheel.&nbsp; i still cant do a cartwheel right though... part of it is fear. part of it is that i need more practice... on something soft. XD 
im just happy because he invited me to the body rock meetings. body rock is a breakdancing club. :D :D :D :D i was like ""oh, maybe after i practice some more... cuz i really suck."" and he was like ""don't worry about it. there are a lot of people new to it. we just teach them. and no one is cocky or anything; we kick those type of people out. everyone's really nice."" :D :D :D&nbsp; i wanna check it out... like maybe just watch. ehehehe.&nbsp; the guy i admire (from the post before the last post) is in that club. XD XD XD XD and he looks really cute breakdancing. 
yeah. i realized that the guy im attracted to looks a bit young. he's definitely older than me by a year. but he's short and has such a baby face... he can probably pass as a high schooler.&nbsp; Hm... do i have a problem? lol. j/k.&nbsp; 
yay! 1 and 1/2 week before spring break, and one more quarter before a whopping 3 month break! :)))))))))))))))))))))))"

"event","<p>I'm feeling a bit frustrated with dance right now. :T<br />I thought that by doing Kunfusion (an exhibition dance group where we've been meeting once a week for the past 8 weeks) would help me improve, as well as taking beginning dance lessons at ucsd's recreation. i have improved, but oh man... i am so far from getting good.&nbsp;<br />today, someone (luke) offered a workshop. he's in a competing dance group, and this workshop was for fun; it was to show us something more challenging, like something that we should try if we were thinking about auditioning for a competing dance group, or just to see what something more challenging was like. OMG. it was so hard. i really couldnt remember the dance routine.&nbsp; the choreographers for Kunfusion (they were in a competing dance group) were amazing. they learned the whole routine and memorized it in one hour.&nbsp; what really bothered me was that there were some people who were also a bit new to hip hop who were able to remember it. considering how there were only like 5-7 people who werent in competing dance groups there, i guess it's not that big of a deal.. but it bothered me. i thought i had improved, but this workshop REALLY lowered my self-esteem.<br />i told scott that i was really frustrated. and he told me that he felt the same. he wanted to quit the routine in the middle. i told him that i felt like maybe dancing just wasnt for me... that i must really suck at it. sometimes i feel like i just look awkward in my movements, or just plain ugly. but scott said that i looked fine dancing. he said that these people are good because they practice all the time... they practice for hours. i have to admit that he's right... but i dunno. it still frustrates me. im still trying to remember the dance. thank goodness joseph actually remembers it, so he went over it with me and elaine. but golly, i was really jealous that he memorized it and was able to do it quite well.<br />yeah. and i find that i think breakdancing is my first love. there are some routines that i dont enjoy dancing, but i always get excited if breakdancing is somehow involved. lol. the problem is, i dont practice. at first, when i first tried breakdancing, i thought i just sucked. but after reading some stuff online, i found that you're supposed to practice like a few hours a day to get really good at it, and im like ""dude, i hardly practice, and when i do, it isnt even for 1/2 an hour."" lol. yeah. so reading that gave me some motivation because i guess i dont suck. i really just need to practice and be patient.&nbsp;<br />the good thing about joing kunfusion is that i met one guy who is willing to help me out with breaking! yay! lol. well, at least i have someone to practice with. we exchanged phone numbers, and he told me that he just tries to practice breaking whenever he can. :D so i guess that means i can bother him with it. yayayay!<br />on another note, i think guys who dance have a lot of charisma. there is actually one guy who i'm attracted to... and dang, when he dances, it looks good. :D what really caused me to notice him was his dancing. well, at first, i noticed him because i thought he was really short. like, i never saw an asian guy so short... even though he's asian.. like he's short even for an asian. but when i saw him dance, i was like ""&lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3"".&nbsp; he looked so darn cool. lol. yeah..... guys who want to get girls... learn how to dance..... like REALLY WELL.<br />i think dancing is good because it shows self-confidence, without being cocky, so i guess that's what makes it look so good. and people look so happy doing it. it's crazy. dancing is really something to just have fun with. :)&nbsp;<br />so..... i guess typing this out makes me less frustrated. :T<br />i am a bit nervous though.&nbsp; when we perform for the Fusion event, i'm gonna be in the front... and the middle for one dance. like, im gonna be the most conspicuous person on stage. dude, this means i hella have to practice, and to hit all the moves perfectly. :P the sad thing is, im not even put there because of skill or anything. it was all random. lol. i was like ""ehhhhhhh?!"" when i was placed there. XD but im a bit excited and proud. i mean, how often do people get put in the spotlight, especially randomly? ehehhe. please, God, help me out. :D it wont be my first time performing for an audience, but it will be the first time i'll have to face the audience and perform. lol. and i have to make eye contact with the audience. LOL. i dont think im ready. &gt;&lt; o well, i'll see.<br />now, i just need to work harder in school. 1 more weeks before freaking finals.... LOL. i am so not ready. :P</p>"

"event","&nbsp;okay, so i think my dream in life is to become a famous popular music composer/song writer who owns an enterainment industry (or is married to someone who owns one... or at least is related to someone who owns one. xD)
that would be so freaking awesome. x) but my parents want me to be a doctor.
why do i want to go into music? i dont think i have much talent. but music makes me very happy. when you listen to music, you're being taken our of reality, and all you have are emotions. like when i listen to a really sad song, i would cry, or a really happy song, i would smile, and sometimes there are just those really stimulating songs... that just really excites you. like there isn't a specific emotion for that. :D yeah. music gives me so much happiness that i want to create it and share the happiness with others.&nbsp; that's my dream.
being a doctor really doesnt excite me very much. i would only do it to satisfy my curiousity about really gross deformations and diseases.&nbsp; but i wouldnt be a doctor to serve others at all... and i dont feel like im being called to be one.&nbsp; it never made me happy thinking about being one... and i had planned to be a doctor for the majority of my life. :T i dont know what to do.&nbsp; i think i have to find&nbsp;a major that will satisfy my parents without forcing me to get into medicine.
yeah.
i'm thinking... should i major in music? the idea really excites me!!!!! xD and maybe business too... or something.&nbsp;
yeah..
do u know what was wonderful? yesterday, at large group, we were having a bit of worship at the end, and it was amazing because there were so many people and since large group was held in a lecture hall, the seats were sloped down, so it sort of looked like we were this humongous choir or something... and i thought... this is what we would do in heaven, huh? and that made me very happy because i have never felt so satisfied or happy.&nbsp; i used to be afraid that i'd be bored in heaven, just singing and praising god, but man... yesterday, those few minutes, i felt i could do that forever.&nbsp; it was so cool.... lol.&nbsp; yeah. xD"

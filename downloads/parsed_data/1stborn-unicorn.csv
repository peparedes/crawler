"event","Hi, I'm ok !

It was the army. They told me to stay indoors upstairs and turn off all the electrics. They also gave me food and water so staying put seemed like a good idea.

I haven't seen anything today but there was another truck going round with a message saying everything has returned to normal so I decided to plug the computer back in.

C rang. Apparently he couldn't get close to home so he headed back to work. Its a warehouse with forklifts with big spikes on them. They had to spike a few of the warehouse staff but mostly everyone is ok.

I think I'll be keeping my head down for a few days, but its quiet here now and well my friends list seems to suggest that everything is getting better all over.

Here's hoping."

I think I can hear cars moving around. I might be imagining it though. I'm going to try and peep out the curtains again. See if there is anyone moving about.

I can hear what sounds like loud hailers. Shouting voices. I wonder if its the police or the army, there has to be some benefit to being the biggest town close to a huge Army base."

"event","Its quite quiet here. This is good. I can stay here with the internet and find out when it is safe to come out. If I have to find food before then, well I'll have to find food. At that point I'll find a vehicle too. 

There is a car alarm going off and screaming. It just started as I started typing. Christ I wish i had the jeep. Its daft and little and blue but its a 4x4 and its strong. I hate hiding here in the nearly dark, waiting to see what happens. With a bloody larp sword as a weapon. I feel like a stupid hippy and I'm getting a baseball bat if the world survives. Or a gun depending on how things turn out.

Someone is still screaming. It sounds like a woman. Is it bad of me to be glad its not a man ? I've got my phone with me but I dare not ring anyone in case they are hiding. Or in case I can't get through. No answer would be bad right now.

I hope zombies can't look up. Or don't want to eat cat. I wish Milly would come off the window sill. Maybe I'll get a big savage dog to go with the baseball bat. I wonder if the comet did it ? I wish we shopped better, at least I'd have food.

I'm rambling. I'll stop and see if any of the news sites have anything more for me."

But I can't. Its insane.

Lets try it.

There are zombies in the garden. Dead people are eating other people in my garden. 

And there is no food in the house. So even if I manage to survive today, by some miracle, with no weapons, no car and two cats, I'm going to starve to death.

I guess I can worry about that later. If there is a later. Me and the cats are going to hide upstairs. I'm taking the computer up with me so at least I can get some idea of whats going on.

C hasn't made it home yet. I'm not thinking about that."

The bloke in the back garden seems to be doing something to the next-door neighbour that fell asleep on their lawn.

It doesn't seem to be a good thing.

I wish C would hurry up. I'm not liking this and America seems to have gone mad judging by my friends list."

I sort of peeped through the curtains and I think there is someone in the garden. The back door is locked though so I'm just going upstairs until they've gone away.

Its a bit cowardly but this isn't really the sort of area you call the police in."

But now its pouring down.

There is no point in putting the telly on even as it'll just be doom and gloom about the UK being washed into the sea or flooding us into the dark ages or whatever. They never take the opportunity to discuss global warming at a time people might actually take note.

I think I can probably get away with doing some sewing now. Its late enough that the neighbours can't really complain if the sewing machine wakes them up and anyway they kept me awake most of the night."

How did the country get to the point where some seem to view people that DRESS differently to them as not even being people anymore.

They are CLOTHES, they do not somehow make the person less of a human being than you."

<TD>What, are you a first generation gamer? Did you own the brown box?! Whatever you do in your spare time, gaming seems to be your job.

<br><br><u>Alignment:</u><br><b>Lawful Good</b> characters are the epitome of all that is just and good. They believe in order and governments that work for the benefit of all, and generally do not mind doing direct work to further their beliefs.
<br><br><u>Race:</u><br><b>Humans</b> are the 'average' race. They have the shortest life spans, and because of this, they tend to avoid the racial prejudices that other races are known for. They are also very curious and tend to live 'for the moment'.
<br><br><u>Primary Class:</u><br><b>Bards</b> are the entertainers. They sing, dance, and play instruments to make other people happy, and, frequently, make money. They also tend to dabble in magic a bit.
<br><br><u>Secondary Class:</u><br><b>Mages</b> harness the magical energies for their own use. Spells, spell books, and long hours in the library are their loves. While often not physically strong, their mental talents can make up for this.
<br><br><u>Deity:</u><br><b>Oghma</b> is the Neutral Good god of knowledge and invention. He is also known as the Binder of What is Known, and is the Patron of Bards. His followers believe that knowledge reigns supreme, and is the basis for everything else that is done. They wear white shirts and pants, with a black and gold braided vest, and a small, box-like hat. All priests of Oghma are known as Loremasters. Oghma's symbol is a scroll.

I have a front and a half sewed of the monster kit. That I want for sunday. That I won't get to do anything with on Saturday. Hmmm. No sleep for me tomorrow night :(

I now I could do more now but I'm tired and I have to get up in the morning for work. 

On a slightly sureal note I was proposed to by Private Message tonight. Well more accuratly Izzy was and I did propose first when slightly tipsy at Sintel Fest. It's strange how these things happen but it means I get to be a Baroness and thats one in character aim fulfilled. 

Don't know whether we are going to do a wedding yet. It would be a good excuse to wear a big frock (which due to crazy typing just came out as fonk) and I suppose historically quite ok to still wear the dress for best, but I'm unsure what'll happen. Have to wait and see.

Work is still good. The people who I'll be working with that have been in America since I started might be back tomorrow. That'll be nice to see the people I keep talking to on the phone. And C's mum is coming out of hospital tomorrow ready for her birthday on Saturday.

I wonder if tiredness is terminal. It feels it at the moment and I don't know why. I'm mostly happy, mostly sleeping ok (despite elbow in eye situations) and only background level stressed (I think, I might be wrong there though), its probably from not eating properly but hopefully I'll get my head round that next week.

Except work is sending me to Oldham for Wednesday + Thursday so that might not happen either.

Me tired - must sleep now."

"event","Your Existing Situation
Physical illness, over-tension, or emotional distress have taken a severe toll. Her self-esteem has been reduced and she now needs peaceful conditions and considerate treatment to permit recovery.


Your Stress Sources
The situation is regarded as threatening or dangerous. Outraged by the thought that she will be unable to achieve her goals and distressed at the feeling of helplessness to remedy this. Over-extended and feels beset, possibly to the point of nervous prostration.


Your Restrained Characteristics
Willing to participate and to allow herself to become involved, but tries to fend off conflict and disturbance in order to reduce tension.
Believes that she is not receiving her share--that she is neither properly understood nor adequately appreciated. Feels that she is being compelled to conform, and close relationships leave her without any sense of emotional involvement.

Clings to her belief that her hopes and ideas are realistic, but needs encouragement and reassurance. Applies very exacting standards to her choice of a partner and wants guarantees against loss or disappointment.




Your Desired Objective
Needs to feel identified with someone or something and wishes to win support by her charm and amiability. Sentimental and yearns for a romantic tenderness.


Your Actual Problem
Depleted vitality has created an intolerance for any further stimulation, or demands on her resources. This feeling of powerlessness subjects her to agitation and acute distress. She attempts to escape into a substitute world in which things are more nearly as she desires them to be."

It'll keep me busy over the winter and I mihgt even get C's grey velvet cassock done. I have some velvet for it but I'm not sure if there is enough so I keep putting it off and he doesn't bug me about it (which is nice) and I have other thing's he make that he probably would want more - hughly bagged red tarten trousers where being mentioned on Friday and branch monster kit was mentioned this morning. I'll really have to get started with something ! Even if its just sending off for fabric samples from <a href=""http://www.fabricland.co.uk"">One of the only fabric sites I could find in England</a> so I can think about what fabrics I'm going to use."

<a href=""http://store.sewingtoday.com/cgi-bin/voguepatterns/shop.cgi?s.item.2714=x&TI=20003&pageNum=2&M=&UK=31180561"">I love this sooo much</a>

The plan is velvet (obviously for me) - either purple, if I can get some that's really dark, or black. I may make the frog fastenings if I get really keen in which case they will be purple otherwise they will be black. I have cloaks but I wanted something different and this is it. 

I do worry about it being a bit huge - I'm only 5'2"" and, whilst not beng the skinniest person in the world, I could still end up looking swamped. When this pattern actually arrives - I had to order it but as they where all half price and had the other two in stock, I didn't mind too much - I'll have a better idea about how big those sleeves really are! 

This uses a small ton of fabric (seven + yards of outer, lining and interling and more for ruffles) but I just love it so very much. It's also an advanced Vogue pattern which should be a challenge but that'll be nice as I manage to keep interested longer the more difficult something is. 

I've just thought about having to sew that much velvet and I'm starting to waver on that as an option. My sewing machine isn't that good and seems to particularly dislike velvet. Maybe brocade could be an option after all! (It'll end up being velvet and I'll end up shouting but I'll like it better in the end)"

<a href=""http://www.simplicity.com/s2b.htm"">No. 5843</a>

Again better picture later. I'm making the yellow version and the top tunic of the white one. So basically tied sleeves, bustier, lightweight over tunic. This is going to be next years banquet kit.

I've changed my mind on trim and fabrics 80 million times already but it'll be purple and the trim will probably be diamante/gem stone of some description. I'm thinking some sort of iridescent/shot silk or taffeta for the dress and chiffon or organza for the over tunic. But this is subject to change when something else catches my eye. Or I decide that beading the bustier is actually a reasonable option in which case the dress will end up being something dull (as in not shiny) as I'm scared of too much fuss."

I'll try to put a better picture up later but basically add long sleeves and take out the side slits to the one on the right. At the moment the front pattern is a main bit with a extra piece filling in the right shoulder but the idea is to make two full fronts turning it into a jacket rather than a top. I intend to use a decent fake suede and a removable thin fleece lining so I'll probably make it a size too big to allow for the thick material. The only thing I'm not settled on is whether to fasten it with silver buckles or try and find some big skull (or something similar) buttons - I imagine it'll depend on what I can find.

Anyway this is the first plan."

"event","Nobody reads this anyway so I'm going to fill it with my costuming nonsense! I keep having ideas and then promptly forgetting them so hopefully if I out them in here it might stop.

Due to just getting a new job (Yey!!!) I should hopefully be able to buy what I want and not just whats in the local remnant shop for a change so I can plan a bit more than usual.

Firstly I should say to anyone reading this - IT'S FOR LARP - it's not in the least historical and based on Big 3 Patterns. I have mad historical stuff - 2 Elizabethan corsets, a chemise and 3 quaters of an Elizabethan but they don't really fit with what I want. I want something that the none costume orientated can go wow at rather than just people that now that it maybe a wonderful recreation of a painting. I want to make beautiful recreations but I'm just too lazy !

I shall now split to new posts on the three different things that are awaiting my crazed planning ..."

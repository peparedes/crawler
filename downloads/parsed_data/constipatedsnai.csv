Aww...how cute! You're the puppy with the bow that<br>everyone drools over. You don't quite get it<br>sometimes, though. Ditzy, impatient, blonde, or<br>immature are words which might describe you.<br>One doesn't know how you made it this far<br>without hurting yourself, but you have.... and<br>that's a scary thought. Yep, you're a puppy!

You really enjoy<br>Christmas, and you like your Christmases<br>conventional.  For you, Christmas is about<br>family and traditions, and you rather enjoy the<br>rituals of going to church at midnight and<br>turning off the lights before flaming the plum<br>pudding.  Although you find Christmas shopping<br>frustrating, you like the excitement of<br>wrapping and hiding presents, and opening a<br>single door on the Advent Calendar each day.<br>You like the traditional carols, and probably<br>teach the children to sing along to them.  More<br>than anyone else, you will probably actually<br>have a merry Christmas.

oh yeh i saw a clip of placebos new vid... yay. it looks really cool. can't wait til it's released. will have to get a ticket to see em in november, but i don't wanna go to london on my own and i doubt laura will have enough money since she spends it all the time on make up :P

"event","<P>yay my pc is fixed... so im happy :D<BR>spoke to laura c on msn last nite... i'm not pissed at her anymore just dissapointed (hehe how mature does that sound?)</P>
<P>okies heres what happened... on tuesday nite she was sposed 2 b comin to mine with laura h, but she phoned me on monday or tuesday or whenever saying she had 2 go to a mcdonalds induction (mcdonalds have inductions all the time, she coulda gone to an induction on a day when she wasn't suppost to be coming to mine instead of letting her friends down again... right?) she said she could probably still come after the induction though, just wouldn't meet us in town before hand. Anyway on tuesday nite me and laura h get a phone call from laura c at 8...(yes 8). saying she can't come... implying that it was too late to come and that she had just got home (hmm wonder if brad was with her when she phoned?).. it takes 20 mins to get to my house on the bus from her house so it wasn't too late to come. So i got pissed an just passed the phone to laura h so i didn't get pissy at her. Anyway the next day we saw her shopping in town (with the money she didn't have to get the bus to my house). So i told her on msn last nite that i saw her in town (i meant that we saw her on wednesday with her mum an sister...not with brad when she was supposed to be with us).. and she was all like ""yeh on tuesday after my induction me and brad went into town"" (SHE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE MEETING US THEN)... and she had enough bus money to get into town and buy shoes??? huh?! so it turns out when she was suppost to be at mine, she was in town with brad. So i had a bit of a go at her (in my stupid non aggressive kind of way... need to learn to stop being a push over).. and her excuse for not coming to mine was she didn't have the bus money.......... but she had the money for shoes and to get into fucking town. blah if ya readin this laura c im sorry for bitching but i kinda think im right for once in this case... sorry... there i go being a push over again lol.</P>
<P>and heres my rant about chris....</P>
<P>he said he would fucking look at train ticket prices to come to preston and he promised me he was comin.... but i was at my grans at the weekend and he was askin me to come c him cuz my grans is near his house but i told him it's his turn to come see me.. and he said ""well find out train prices for me then"".... so he can't even make the effort to look at train prices?! like when we were going out he couldn't make the effort to not go out one night a week so he could come see me... grrrrrrrrr asshole. i bet i forgive him within a day though. bastard. but im not sorry for bitching about u chris cuz u probably fucking cheated on me while i was in hospital (when u didn't visit me).... need to find more mean names to call u other than asshole and bastard, does poohead sound ok? lol</P>
<P>okies i'm done with ranting. :) i'm going to pick up holly from the kennels later yay. </P>
<P>jason fucked up my leg on thursday... i was riding him and he decided to have no breaks and kept going until i yanked at his mouth, then he rammed into a wall sideways and scraped my leg along it, i have a massive bruise now, i need to ride him more so i learn how to control him better. and he stood on my foot while dragging me to another horses food bucket later lol.. hes such a cutie though i can't be mad at him... he licked me to say sorry.</P>
<P>oooooooh and now i have dark browny reddy hair :) it makes me look tons paler yay.</P>
<P>just hav 2 add a random picture or david ryder prangley from rachel stamp :D hes so trashy n cute...and scarily old i think. but not going bald like brian molko (still luv ya tho brian)</P>

"event","<P>ok, yesterday was weird.. went to meet sam and laura and liam. </P>
<P>laura thinks i'm mad at her for leavin me on my own with sam, i'm not mad :P she's silly. but it was very awkward and i got bored and had to stop myself from looking at my watch lol. and then we were outside later and he kept spitting, ok i know thats a normal guy thing but it just seemed really ick... and he came out with the most random things (which was cute on certain ex bfs that i won't mention... ahem... lol) but it was like he was trying to impress me or something... anyway he seemed nice, i wouldn't mind being friends with him. but when we got to the bus station he said he'd call me about doing something on wednesday, so naturally i invited alex and jemma over on wednesday so i could be busy lol... oh dear i sound mean :(</P>
<P>friday night was weird too, ended up staying at liams cuz we couldn't be bothered getting a taxi back to lauras. they were very well behaved though... i didn't hear any dodgy scary noises lol thank god. laura c didn't phone us to let us know if she was coming or not, and didn't answer any of my phone calls. wonder if she's avoiding me?! lol</P>
<P>i had the strangest dream last night, that i was in the hospital again cuz i'd lost weight again n my eating was fucked (again lol). and the toilets had doors that kept closing and opening so the nurses were watching us but then sometimes the door wud close and they'd freak out and then all the people would start puking... i dreamt that stephen was still there n he was a normal weight, which was weird. and everyone kept force feeding me deep fried grapes?! meh maybe this is gonna mean a relapse. doubt it though... hope not</P>"

"event","okies i'm just gonna explain something and i'm sure someone will take it personally, but i want em to know that i didn't take anything they said in a bad way (partially because i don't care to be honest.. and that isn't out of spite), the only thing i dissaprove of is the constant noseyness, but fair enough that particular messageboard thing was saved on my user info, although i tried to not get it put on there.
there are certain things that others perceive to be fucked up about me, that group that i had joined in particular... i have never said i shared the veiws of those people in that group or the stupid little 16 yr olds that asked silly questions (she probably was fucked in the head to ask ""how to cut"" or ""how to ed"" in the first place and would have the thoughts behind it already there). i know one of you thinks alot of things about my way of life are strange, however i would like to say there are alot of things i thought are strange (or completely scary) about you too, which i have kept inside in the past but since you have expressed yourself saying that something i do is fucked up then i think i'm not out of order by saying (ok i decided not to write it cuz it's personal to you blah blah etc etc)... anyway. no hard feelings, i'll stop being a bitch now.
hehe i wrote this here instead of email so the person that it's aimed at won't be sure if it's them :D

ooooh i'm going out tonight... dunno if im goin to the mill tho
arg just got a txt from lisa n she aint comin. i really can't b bothered goin out but i wanna get pissed anyway. bet ya laura c can't come. she never can."

<P>i had a 3 day long asthma attack too and had to go to casualty today. i got put on a nebuliser and have to take 8 steroid tablets a day now.&nbsp;it wasn't too bad though, and a nurse said she liked my shoes lol... aren't they cute?</P>

<P>hmm... fathers day 2moro, stuff like that's always awkward. dunno if i should go to where we sprinkled my dads ashes or just forget about it all. i have the familiar feeling of abusing pills, but i'm sure the people in casualty wouldn't appreciate another visit from me in the next few days, no matter how cute my shoes are lol. plus i'm yellow enough from past stupidities or however u spell it. </P>

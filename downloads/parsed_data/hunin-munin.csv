"event","Just wondering, sons. Hello and good day. This is the Raven speaking to you again. I may or may not be with you in the nights to come. 

I had another dream about dead things. Animals this time, actually; to be specific, a dead rat. For some reason, in my dreams, I often have many, many rats in a few rather nice and complicated cages. Only recently have the numbers of these dream rats dwindled to only a half dozen. I think it is obvious that I miss having a little troupe of rats, instead of three bunnies hopping about in their cages. I think, perhaps (getting back to the dream) my mind scape is getting a little healthier, if the only dead thing I have had in the past couple of nights in my dreams has been one rat. I used to have piles of bodies in the style of Holocaust disposal photos. 

Well. Who knows. I am sure that the dead will be crawling back again. My poor subconscious is having the hardest time these days in trying to frighten me through nightmares. I tend to think reality is worse, and really, it usually is.

My icon says it all. Though, strangely enough, despite these words glowing on my screen, I am actually feeling rather positive. Even though I smell ferret shit and have one of the said ferrets chewing a hole in my toe. It's time to pull out the old easel and paint up some canvas with something macabre."

"event","Another sleepless night in Kentucky.

Times when the mind is free to wander, lost in echoes of dreams and memories from a time that's hard to remember beyond the hear say of your brain. You know you have done things in the past, you are here now, after all, aren't you? We remember and write down the past, but beyond that, it ceases to exist. It's a pity that we let it rule so much of our lives.

So, I'm just drifting on the haze of a few shots of lime vodka in tonic, my eyes barely focused as I type out these words. It's all right; my fingers know where to go most of the time. Every now and then there is that Freudian slip, and something from deep in my brain comes out. Or else it's just my fingers belching and forgetting their place on the board, or how to spell a simple word from the language I grew up with.

Cried again tonight, not that I am much surprised by that. There was a reason, at least, as I was watching the touching bit in <i>RENT</i>. As no one was around to see, I was able to just let myself feel the moment. It's like the writer of <i>Goth Craft</i> says, people like me don't just listen to the music, we feel the music. It's easy to get lost in it.

I think back now to dancing at Vertigo on Monday nights when the all ages show began with goth night. The music, the kind DJ, and his sweet girlfriend Trixie who liked dancing with me. Charming people, lovely and loving people. Dancing. Men that would kiss the hands of ladies, boys who wore beautiful long skirts, girls who pranced about with fishnet and wine in their hands. Red Bull driven nights, making sweet with the bar man to get a drink, even though you're underage. Undulating bodies, black light dance, deep heavy tones, and Bela Lugosi's dead. Undead, undead, undead, undead.

<i>You know what flows there like wine...</i>

I'm working on the idea for my next tattoo. It'll be another piece in the chronicle of me. On the right shoulder, a pentacle. I am not sure how it will look yet, as I can't decide which direction to go with it. It will most definitely be organic in some way. I want to get another sleeve done, as with the left arm decorated I feel unbalanced. I think I need some positive strong female figure there to remind me to be myself. Perhaps Ianna/Ishtar or an old traditional image of her handmaiden, Lilith. I've been studying where the religions of the world coincide way too much lately. It's getting in the way of my creative juice.

Of course, the cure for lack of creative juice is some kind of euphoric help. Sadly, all my connections have gone on without me. Of course, I am the one that abandoned them, aren't I?

I want to go out tonight."

Finally getting over this cold. I haven't felt all that bad, as I refuse to, but being forced to hack and cough up wads of tasty, thick, sometimes crunchy phlegm is not exactly the most enjoyable way to spend an afternoon.

I found myself doing some study on Ianna/Ishtar over the past couple of days, in an attempt to make some kind of connection between characters in the first bit of the Bible with the people that were already around. Lilith is listed as being the handmaiden of Ianna/Ishtar, which I can't help but find very fascinating. It's interesting to look up the actual history behind Judeo-Christian myths to see where all this insanity fits in with the rest of the ancient world.

Mind you, everyone was freaking insane in those days, by our standards today.

So. Mesopotamia and Sumeria... I am such a paleoanthropology geek... Maybe I should actually go to school to study? What you all think? Not like I am doing much else. It's just the getting myself worked up enough to go and do it."

Does it really have to be so specific? It can almost make a person feel bad. Almost. Course, I'm the person who can't even keep up with a private written diary, so... Yeah. 

I do want to see persons again (online or however). Really, I do. I just...have no follow through and am never sure if anyone wants to talk or hang or whatever.  WHEE. Um.

Right, so not much has been going on in this place that is my head. Got a pretty nice job working at a privately owned bakery here in town, which I am not sure will survive this economic poop shoot. If that turns out to be the case, well... I'm going to have to get a second job if business continues to be as slow as it has been. Thankfully, Easter is coming up, and that is usually a good time for bakeries.

Don't sound too convinced, do I? It's just my new strategy that I have adopted; I keep myself in a constant state of 'whatever', often expecting nothing to come of anything. Every now and then (more often than when I used to get my hopes up) I get a nice surprise out of life. Hell. I even smile and joke more now.

Like most of America, I am in debt, but I'm not horribly buried at this point. As long as I continue making money and payments, all is good. I'm glad I only have one credit card, though I still feel like an idiot for spending as much as I have in the past. On the plus side, I have clothing I can wear comfortably that is not full of holes.

We'll see if that's accurate. And by special order, I mean, the people who order them are SPESHUL.

Wow. Humans. Are. Stupid. You realize this as you are attempting, again and again, to take someone's order. No one knows what they want, yet they call in:

"event","I figure I can get in a short post before I have to leave for work.

So, been decorating cakes and such this week. Started on Sunday, and have been doing all right so far. I think the only complaint about me is that I am not fast yet. Cos, you know, starting out, all people move with the blazing speed they learn from working in the same department for the past four years (or however long Robin has worked in the Bakery).

It's...odd. I don't have to deal with customers, really, which is nice. I just stand behind the counter, which is almost as tall as I am, hide, and decorate. There really aren't any guidelines as to what I should be decorating the cakes and cookies with. Or, if there are supposed to, I haven't been given them yet. I really haven't been given much instruction, to be honest. Most of this is by the seat of my pants, as Manager Chris keeps sending Robin off to do random errands (that Chris could do herself, but is too lazy to do), and I am left without anyone to train me or tell me what needs to be done and how to do it.

So, I'm just making stuff up. I look at what needs to be done. Try to remember what those blank spaces in the cases were, and fill them back up. I don't know where half the shit is stored in the freezer, so I spend a fair amount of time in there, dazed and daydreaming, staring at the dozens of boxes, hoping to see one that looks about right. For instance, today I need to bake and decorate the colossal cookies. I have no idea where these are kept, and today is, of course, Robin's day off, so I also have no one to tell me.

Guess I'll just go surfing through the freezer again. It's so stuffed back there, I can barely squeeze in around things. Seriously. I wish this was an exaggeration. If things were better organized, I wouldn't worry about it, but, sadly, things are shoved in there, often without the labels showing, and I have to search through carts and shelves for what I need.

At least I got the two kit cakes done yesterday. Special orders for a Spider Man cake and a Winny the Pooh cake, both for the same lady, both due to be done today for her to pick up at 1:30. I had to mix up special icing colors for both, airbrush them, and curse a blue streak as the icing kept sliding around and fucking up the airbrushed colors. Also, the lady wanted the full images, but also wanted to have the 'Happy Birthday (random Russian name here)' on each cake, when there was no room for the inscription. 

But now I know how to use an airbrush. And that is freaking sweet.

And I made a monkey out of miniature cupcakes. I must say, it is the best monkey I ever made out of miniature cupcakes and icing. Lots of icing. I mean, a shit load of chocolate icing. OOH. And making that cake for the funeral was pretty sweet, too. BLACK on BLACK MUAHAHAHAH. 

It's...oddly fun. I just wish I wasn't always rushed for time. Though, today, I should be able to take more time. No special orders, unless more were taken last night. I can just slice and decorate cakes. If only my feet didn't hurt so much."

But not before they give me their money, preferably.

So, I spent the past weekend drinking and hamming it up at the Ashley's before going back to work until I get a day off again on Saturday. Getting weekends off seems to be the trend now. I suppose that is because the college kids that are working in my department can work the weekend. Hey, I'm not going to shit on good fortune like that. Two days off in a row is fine by me.

I'm making some advancement in becoming the new cake decorator at work. Dixie has moved on (either quitting or moving back up front) and I picked up the slack on Friday, baking and decorating the colossal cookies in UK colors. It's good practice. I had a little extra time (I don't know how or why it takes the other cake decorators so much time to bake a few cookies and decorate them; I was done in less than 2 hours) and was able to specialize a couple of the colossal cookies for customers. It was an excuse to play with icing, and, yes, I'll admit it, I like seeing my customers happy. It doesn't take long for me to pull out one of the blank colossal cookies and decorate it for someone, even if they are a sorority chick and want it in their sorority colors with their sorority logo written in.

Damn. Now I want cookies...

Work is slow on my Halloween costume. I finally found the skirt I need for it (I hope) and am expecting it within the next week or so. If not, well, I'll live. I just need the top to go with it, and all shall be well. I'm not really expecting to be done and ready for this year. Money is lacking, bills need paying, as does rent. It's cool, though. This costume has been in the works for the past year or so. It can wait a bit longer. Besides, I want to be able to wear it out and about, and not just be sitting at home in all my glory, handing out candies to little brats. There is talk, just talk, of perhaps planning something for next year's Halloween, as I will probably be working this year's.

Working on Labor Day. I keep hearing people going on about how we shouldn't have to work on this day, but why not? I mean, most holidays are pretty much pointless these days, especially holidays like Independence Day, Easter, Labor Day, or Thanksgiving. The only good thing I can see about these days that all you high class persons get off is that I can work and get time and a half pay.

Call me a Scrooge if you like, but hear me out first.

It's not just the commercialization that makes holidays pointless now. The lack of family in this American culture (as well as those countries that have been infected by us) makes the holiday pointless. A holiday is now the only reason most of us even bother seeing our families anymore. There are many who don't even bother with that much, but will give in and give family a call to make sure they are still alive. I imagine there are many out there that curse their family being still alive, their mothers and fathers and grandparents, as they are expecting a pretty nice sum of money when they are finally dead. How many of you out there call your parents to check if they are dead yet? I bet a lot more than will admit it.

I know I, for one, would be glad to hear of a couple of uncles being dead. I may not rejoice as much as I did when my grandfather died, but I will still be most pleased.

Anyway. We all know what a cold person I can be.

Most businesses are open now, simply because people complain when they are unable to get what they want on a holiday. God forbid you should have to plan ahead, and have things bought and ready to go. God forbid you not be able to go out to eat at a restaurant on Labor Day. Never mind that other people might want the day off. Yet, it's these same damn people who are shopping, or are going out to eat, who then look at me and ask why the hell I don't have Labor Day or Thanksgiving Day off. I had seven customers ask me today why we were open, while I was getting them their deli meats and cheeses.

Retards, the whole lot of you.

...

Of course, getting pay for twelve hours when I worked eight is very nice. Very nice, indeed.

Mind you, I still have to wait an extra day to get my paycheck, because those who handle the paychecks get Labor Day off. They probably went to eat at a restaurant, too."

I happen to work for a grocery chain now, the name which shall not be uttered as we all know what happens to people who utter their company names on the internets. I am under enough pressure without having to worry about being canned as well. (this has been a food joke. was it not funny?)

Carrying on.
We do not have many people working the night shift where I am. To be exact, there are three people, myself included, who work the night. As a result, we do not get days off very often, and when one of us needs to go on vacation, the other two have to work the entire time non-stop, or, we can have our day off, but the other person working does so ALONE. This is the sad reality of having the hours in our department cut to the point where, even if we had another night worker, we would not have the hours to give them. Thankfully, my manager will be pointing this out to the head god manager of the store in a 'what the fuck is your problem?' method tomorrow morning. This will be good to do, as one of our people is returning to go to school at UK, and will need his job back. I look forward to this.

At any rate, as one of the night closers, Larry, is on his vacation, the last chance he has to take it before school starts again, today was my day to work alone, and Taura's (the other night person) turn to take the day off. I haven't worked a deli alone for a year, and never one this busy. I can honestly say, IT WAS A FUCKING NIGHTMARE.

OMIGOD. WHY DO YOU PEOPLE NEED FRESH FUCKING DELI MEAT? WHY DO YOU COME IN HERDS? WHY CAN'T I HUNT EACH OF YOU DOWN AND MURDER YOU, YOUR FAMILY, AND YOUR PET DOG, WOOFLES??? WHY? WHY?? WHY???

Ahhhh.... It was annoying. People kept piling in, and I needed to get things done. Trash taken back to the compacter, dishes washed, the two slicers cleaned, the chicken packaged for marked down sales, the fryer bottom washed, Satan sucked off, sandwich station closed up and cleaned, floors swept and mopped, deli meats wrapped and stowed away, temperature reports taken, sinks rinsed and cleaned out, etc etc. I don't know how I got most of tonight done. I really don't.

There were some real gems of customers, too. One lady in particular, who looked as if she was slowly swelling up and smelled foul (perhaps she was starting to decompose?), will forever be in my memory for her sheer stupidity and annoyance factor. 
She wanted pulled bar-b-cue beef, or whatever, in small tubs. I told her where they were, in the Grab-n-Go. She said she didn't see them there. I then told her if they were not there, that we did not have them, that perhaps the meat department would have them. She continued to stand there, fouling the air, and explaining to me that she wanted bar-b-cue meat that you put on sandwiches, either not comprehending, or convinced that I was hiding the meat from her flabby, swollen, stinky ass. DEAR GOD. If I had the meat, I would have given her as much as it took to get her to GO AWAY. OMIGOD she smelled so BAD. My eyes were actually stinging as I spoke to her. MY GOD SHE WOULDN'T GO AWAY. I WANTED TO CRY. HER FACE SCARED ME. She was just so...puffy. 

There was a cool customer and her cool kid, though, that stuck with me, too. She was really nice and considerate. I treated her real good as a result, then asked if her boy wanted a cookie. She asked him and he got all excited.

Cool Lady: (to kid) Do you have room for a chocolate chip cookie?
Cool Kid: Chocolate chip cookie??
Me: Freshly baked. *grinning*
Cool Kid: *bouncing up to the counter* Why, I most certainly do!

I love how he talked. It was cool. 

Anyway, I don't want to close alone again. I now feel sorry for the people that have before. Bleh. Great. Now I have guilt."

With the slow realization and admittance that being a mortician would probably depress me like an old tube of tooth paste, not to mention a few other embarrassing factors, I was left for a time with no idea of what direction to take. Got another job working in the deli at Kroger, which I have been at for...hm. Since...wow. April, I guess. Feels longer than that. Anyway, working there made me realize that I love to cook. 

I'm slow, okay? 

Further thought into this revealed that a certain Sullivan University (or whatever it is) provides a good culinary program. I just need to ...er... bother myself with looking into it more. Not going this year, understandably. I'm going to see if I can get all the financial aid I need first. Take it slow and lazy. Besides, they have a fountain at Sullivan and crows. That's cool.

I fear that I may start playing D&D. Someone needs to cattle prod me up the ass (ooh, please?) for considering this. Er. And I hunger for gas station hot dogs. Aw, fuck, why? 

I think I lost weight. People say I have and my pants keep falling off. DAMN YOU, MY ASS! I AM POOR! I CANNOT AFFORD NEW CLOTHINGS FOR FAT LADIES! Uhh.... Yeah.

I just spent a shitload of money for the holidays. I feel lightheaded and very orange. God. All that propaganda...eating...soul...tastes salty... Hopefully I will be able to make good my plans for gifts, the ones I am handmaking, that is. Those of you who I've already bought something for, ALL OF ONE OF YOU, I am sorry... I came up with this in a drunken stupor. I thought to myself, 'Self! If you MAKE presents, you will have more money for booze and cigarettes! Holy shit! I am a fucking drunken master of genius!' At which point I promptly fell asleep. So, yeah. This is a new idea that I kicked around after I made something really fucking awesome in the space of two hours. TWO HOURS and the awesomeness occured. YOU WILL LIKE IT, ONE AND ALL.

Unghh..... Writing so much. Ass falling asleep. Have not sat around like this in long time. Talking more and more like Tarzan. When me get me Jane?

In other news, I've had a friend fall deep into depression, attempt suicide, get checked into the crazy nut house (the third floor of UK's hospital, actually. Not all that nutty, but some of the people are quite crazeh. there is only one door that sepperates the nutjobs from the baby ward. I find this amusing.), have spent nearly every waking moment contemplating my role play characters, and wondering why, oh why, I don't have more black clothing that does not sag off my disappearing ass.

*sniff* Ass vanishing... *sniff* Can no longer jiggle at people and terrify them. *sniff*

Mind you, I am still a fat bastard. Yay, me. And hate the internets. I am sorry. It's true. I do. I get bored very easily... Though, I do miss talking to people. Really, I do. 

Anyway. Uh. Yeah. That's about it. I need to repot a plant, too... Hmm. And...oh, fuck. HAHAHHAH WOW. FUck.... Don't you hate when you realise that you are forgetting to do things that you now have the money to do??? HAHHEHEHHEH.... Okay. I need to go to Liquor Barn again soon. 

So. I am working all days of the week at random times, save for Fridays and Sundays. Uh. Save for this weekend apparently. No, this weekend I am working Sunday and am off Saturday. Hmm....

I'm, yet again, working on a gothic grimoire. After this will be my book of shadows, or whatever. If I can find a hard covered bound book with black pages, it would be perfect. All I can find is spiral bound, though. I got a bunch of skulls and a cross made out of skulls, so this will (hopefully) be awesome.

Man. I've been off the computer for so long, I'm almost having to retrain myself how to type and where all the keys are at. Sad, sad, sad.

It's another rainy night/day here. Maybe I won't have many customers tomorrow. I wouldn't mind that after today. Lord, we get the crazies coming in these days. The people that REALLY want stuff. They get downright emotionally attached to the idea of owning something and when we don't have it, they get in an uproar.

"event","Starting yet another morning with cider and a ferret run. After this, I get to go clean out my closet some more. I'm trying to get a semblance of storage space in there. This means eventually getting a set of little drawer thingies for my drawers (pants, panties, whatever) to keep in the other corner of the closet and eventually freeing up the top shelf, as well as the second shelf. Whoever lived there before really liked putting shelves in closets -all the closets have them.

I've been in this house for three years and it's only now that I feel like I am starting to settle in. Got to be careful. In the slight chance that I manage to move out of my parents' house and get my own place, I'mma gonna have to pack all this shit back up. 

And my grandparents need money again. This is so ridiculous. If I wasn't such a nice person, I would kill Greg (my useless uncle) and sell his blood (type O negative, anyone?) and organs on the black market. Perhaps send off slabs of his meat to China for soup meat. That's about the only use that cesspool is to my grandparents anymore. The very least I can do, sadly, is try and send the loan companies after him so he can be put in jail and forced to pay off his own debt, instead of causing my grandparents to have higher debt. But it's all really too late. Unless I can sell off his organs for a nice price...

I'm mostly kidding. Don't send the gov after me yet. I'd need connections, first.

Nah. I've been looking at useless junk I've collected, hoping to sell it, as a method of helping them. But it's the same old case of feed a man a day, or teaching him to fish, and I'm afraid that the river has dried up.

So. I try not to think very often on my family. I've more or less estranged myself from one side (finally!) and the other side I just don't like being around anymore, as I am always depressed to be around them ( <lj user=""asabear""> excluded, I still like seeing you). I find it sad that a place that used to make me so happy to see and visit is now this pit of growing madness and despair. I don't even like to think of it anymore cos it makes me so depressed, and adding onto my constant depression means it gets me pretty fucking depressed. The very idea of possibly launching myself further and further into debt has kept me from even considering college for years, as well as knowing that going to college doesn't help you get a job in the slightest anymore; not unless you go into business, and even then it's not sure.



And, Dad? Don't you dare give them that money. That's your money. It won't help.

I feel like I have become a very fucked up and cold person. And, yet again, I feel sick to my stomach. I think I'm going to go drink."

"event","I will never be the last to say this, but customers really, really suck.

The first instance didn't happen to me, so much as to one of my coworkers. As happy little cashiers for a home improvement store, dare I say department store, where <b>we can help</b> you, cos <b>you can do it</b>, we have been instructed to take checks and accept signatures that may or may not actually correlate to the charge card used. I wish we didn't have to, and after I witnessed this, I really, really wish I could just refuse some things.

<lj-cut text=""The two things you should never carry in your pocket on a hot day..."">My poor coworker (henceforth known as PC) and I were comparing stories as she came over to give me a bit of relief from cashiering, alone, in the wasteland known as Lumber. As I was pulling out my checks and paperwork, I showed her a check I had just received from a customer that one of our head cashiers (as they wandered by) said I should accept. The check in question looked as if it had been in the pocket of a pair of jeans that had been washed repeatedly, then dipped in a healthy dose of ass sweat. I could barely make out the routing numbers. However, as it was the 'only check' the man had on him, I had to take it.
PC did me one better, and made me go 'ew'. She pulled out a check, barely holding one corner with her fingertips. It was wet all over the middle of the check, and smeared with something brown. At first I feared it might be what you all are probably thinking, but the explaination wasn't much better. Apparently a woman had been carrying this check all day in her pocket, alongside a chocolate bar. Nasty Woman (NW) pulled the check out, looked at it, then licked all the chocolate off. She then asked for a paper towel, which PC gave her. After wiping it off, NW asked if it was still all right to use it to pay for the purchase (as apparently this was the only check she had on her, as well). Of course, just at that moment, a head cashier (funny how they are never there when you need them) came by and said that yes, we would accept that. Unfortunately for PC, that was the first customer of her shift, and she was randomly chosen to give the rest of the cashiers breaks throughout the day. She had to pull out all her paperwork, including that nasty check, every fifteen or so minutes, and carry it around all day.</lj-cut>

Yuck.

Usually it's the women customers I have that cause me the most grief. I am a woman, myself, but it's true, ladies. Women are the most bitchy and impossible customers when they get it in their mind to be so. However, men like to prove that they can be just as impossible! As you can see below...

<lj-cut text=""Snap your neck."">It had been a very busy day, but, as it was a Wednesday, few cashiers had been scheduled. The lines were full, and we were all just barely keeping up with the flow. I work pretty fast, I won't give you a deep, personal experience, but I will make a joke or try to make you feel better as you come through my line -it is my job to do so, and if I do it, hopefully the managers will not notice me- and try to get you out in a speedy/friendly way. But I will slow down for those special cases.

There were two that stood out and shall stay in my dark little heart for ever and ever.

A couple of Japanese girls were milling about, looking around at the flowers, chattering and laughing every now and then.

Eventually one of the girls noticed me and came over.

"event","Back online again. Sorry. Internet has been dead, and apparently there is not a single person working who knows what to do with a Macintosh's connectors.

I burn with hatred for my job. Yesterday was Derby Day, apparently (I don't know, or care, and don't pay attention) and nearly everyone asked for the day off. For some reason, the managers approved their time off, and there were only two cashiers, often one (meaning MOI) at a time on the front end. 

Next time there is a Derby, I will be sure to shove a bomb up one of the horses' ass and detonate it as they come in for the finish. I may  live in Kentucky, have lived here all my life, but I am not excited by the Derby. Yes. Horses run around in a circle repeatedly. As one of my customers yesterday put it, 'Here comes Glue! Followed closely by Dog Food!' Things going around in circles many times over is such a boring concept, I can't understand how anyone, especially people today who want Immediate Satisfaction, can stand to watch it. It's like car races, save that with car races there is a distinct possibility that someone will blow up without the aid of a horse being detonated. 

So, yesterday was not fun. And tomorrow I get to work again. I can't remember what time. I think it's early tomorrow, which is sure to be fun. Hopefully, tomorrow the head cashiers will work instead of sitting off to the side babbling to one another while I am calling them over and over with a customer question or a transaction that I cannot perform without one of them.

Oops. Um. 

HAPPY STUFF. I SING OF JOY. WHEE. I AM HAVING THE GOOD TIME HERE. WHEEEEEEEEEEEEE.

I did watch Silent Hill earlier in the week. That was fun. It made me want to buy and play all the games. And, as I allowed myself some spending money, I set out to do so. However, as the new movie probably gave everyone else the same idea, there were no copies available at EB. So. I bought the new Kingdom Hearts instead and the game guide, and a copy of Red Dragon, as it's the only one I am missing in that trilogy. But, man... Pyramid Head... AWESOME. I wanna be cool like him and carry a huge knife thingie and rip off people's skin and ESPECIALLY fling said skin at corrupt churches.

Um. But, yeah. I am back. Whee. There is no one online. Which is okay. I have to go out today anyway, I think...Maybe...?"

Gawd. I am too into the 'excellent customer service' that Home Depot likes to pound into our brains. I am applying that even when I come home from work now. JEEBUS. SAVE ME JEEBUS.

My sickness seems to finally be going away now. This is great. I have been working nine (am) to six (pm) since Monday, and I have been SICK for two of those days. On Tuesday I was very, very sick, but still had to go to work out of fear that they may fire me. However, thanks to some peoples' idea that the A/C should be turned down to 60 degrees, I was frozen. Even when I peed it felt COLD. It took me several hours after getting home for me to warm up completely, so apparently I had mild hypothermia without realising it. I was sick, very sick, confused and barely understanding the online training SICK, so I was not thinking clearly when it came to the cold. Except to shiver and stare balefully at the thermostat and try to find some warmth beneath my work apron. 

Speaking of the apron, it's ORANGE. I wear nothing but black, so with the orange apron, I look very Halloween indeed. That makes me awesome. More awesome than you.

Oh, and did I mention that I am on a LOT of drugs at the moment? I mean, A LOT. All to keep me semi-alive and semi-alert. Apparently, it's also made me very PERKY. However, that might just be the job doing that.

I was taking the urine test yesterday, which is always enjoyable. I used to be pee shy, though that seems to have completely disappeared now. Or, perhaps, it was the need to wee wee for the past HOUR that had me ready to go. It was complicated. I had to hold it cos I had to finish up some paperwork at Home Depo, then walk back and forth in damp weather while wating for my father to pick me up as, yes, I am still a ride bummer. We hope to change this soon, though.

When I asked the doctor if I could get extra points for not getting piss on my hand, he laughed, but looked at me strangely. Perhaps one day I'll learn who to say things to and who not to.

Oh. And Good Foods sent me my 'Incentive Bonus'. Um. Seems it would have been more of an incentive if they had given it to me while I was still working there... But, hey, $155 is a good amount of money. It'll pay for Tam Lin's check up in May."

And if all of that doesn't work out, then I might have a job at Lowes.

The little arrow of my life is slowly starting to point upwards. Especially now that I have managed to spend the weekend at home doing nothing. So very, very relaxing. Of course, I think I offended my friend when I told her that I need to take breaks from all the running around we had been doing. That's just how I function. I'm not so young anymore, though I'm not so old, either. But I like to have some quiet time where I can do nothing but pet my cats and do a little gardening.  And not have to share space and air with closed minded fools who make me uncomfortable.

Today I get to go over to my uncle's place to help him plant a few things. After all, when I plant things, they grow well. Blossoms everywhere, onions larger than your head, and height that they shouldn't be able to achieve in such crappy soil. Not that I am full of myself and my amazing plant prowess. Used to do it better when I was younger, of course. When I really believed it all unquestioningly. 

Another one of my rats died. Down to just Mao Yin and Kwan Yin now. But they seem happy in the new/old cage, so that is good.

It was one of those baths that show you just how gross and disgusting you really were as little balls of lint from your feet, toes, navel, ass, whatever, collect on top of the water. Along with scum that makes those nasty little soap piles that gather along the edge of the tub, threatening to become soap scum that you will have to scrub with all your might to remove later. All of this literally congeals together, and you wonder to yourself how the hell you got that filthy. 

You didn't think you smelled nasty. Certainly not nasty enough to result in that much grossness. No one mentioned your stench at any time, and you don't soak yourself in body spray to hide stench. You are not a dirty hippy, and it hasn't been that long, really, since you last bathed.

Yet, somehow, there is that cruddy sludge floating about the edge of the tub, covered in hair and lint and what appears to be little gnomes who have evolved from your dead skin and old sweat and general grossness. And the cats are all staring at you, and you wonder just when it was that you, apparently, began oozing goo and if they are wondering the same thing. However, it is at that point that you are about to lose hope of ever getting clean, that one of them begins drinking your filthy water, and you begin wondering how toxic that Old Spice soap you used was.

It's not your cat, however, so it won't be your vet bill.

I wonder if all that grossness is the result of hanging out with mixed persons today, one of them being the friend who is fresh from Germany. Riding around in a filthy, stinking car that has pure ass coming out of the air conditioner, and going to, ugh, Walmart. And various filthy things, like hanging around males, including on a couch that has a fine veneer of old semen all over the cushions. So...a bath was in order.

I got an application from Halloween Express, today, that I would like very much to turn in tomorrow, as I was told to talk to people. I love it. A Halloween store that is open all year round now. This makes me so happy, I am still twitching with glee."

And Jezebel seems to be amusing herself by tossing ferrets from the top of the cat tree to the floor. Oh, dear... Poor Loki. But as she is still responding to  her name and came to me and is now kicking Sev's butt, I suppose she's fine. 

I feel like playing Zoo Tycoon for some reason. Good thing I didn't wipe it from the computer's memory, I suppose. Whoever made City of Heros and City of Villians are not going to make it for the Mac, so that's fun. I didn't think they would. Paranoia or |33t p0w3rz or some shit like that. Really, the only reason to play it would be so that I could actually spend some time with friends who are always playing it, but I know I would get bored with it very, very fast. Super powers: K, whatever. Fighting the forces of evil/good: unoriginal. Playing a game which is filled with a bunch of mouth breathing little boys: sounds like fun. 

Of course, at this point, I am seeing very little sense in much of anything. Unless it is cute and fluffy and can curl up in my lap.

Gaz, our secretary ferret, is finding all these nice little papers, pulling them out, and lining the poop stop with them. So thoughtful of her, as the newspaper isn't enough, obviously. There is this one box that just fascinates her, and she spends hours going through it, pulling out choice little items. Just the other day she found my chains, which made me happy.

My ear decided to explode in pain and blood yesterday. The thanks I get for putting pretty studs in it, I guess. It's just one hole, but it seems to convince the other holes that they need to ache and hurt, too. It's all in just one ear, so it's amusing, but it's the side I like to sleep on, which only makes me smile and nod my head in the 'that figures' -ness of it all.

So, applied for another job. Yee. I couldn't get the online application to work on my computer, so went straight to the source. Of course, they don't have actual paper applications anymore, and so I had to apply online. Thankfully, they had an area right there in the store where I could do it. I've pretty much given up on Hot Topic, as my repeated returns to there to check on how the hiring is going has been fruitless. Apparently the managers are not doing their job, or something. So, that's fun.

"event","So. My ability to procrastinate is teetering off, allowing me to start actually doing something now. Isn't that nice? Maybe it's because I don't have a job yet. Or that I am able to find jobs in Cincinatti and cheap housing while here there is very little. 

Of course, I could have taken that job at the call center, if I didn't know, for a fact, that I would kill everyone in the building, burn the place down, and pee pee on the ashes. The test they had me take to see if I could do the job was bad enough. Entering, I didn't know exactly what kind of calls I would be taking. I had assumed, from what my friend who works at the center said, that I would mainly be redirecting calls. What I got was a test to see how many words per minute I can type (43, all right) and how I did on taking people's orders for crap, taking phone numbers and names and addresses and credit card numbers and etcetera. I got passing scores on the tests, and was told to come in for an interview the following day. I thought about it throughout the rest of the day, realised that, no matter how good the pay, I would not last long if that was the sort of work I would be doing. And neither would the rest of the country MUHAHAAHAHAHHAAHH BURN BURN IT ALL.

Now I just need to find someone to live with me so I can afford living in Cincinatti so I can go to college, get my freaking bachelors in mortuary sciences, then get a high paying job pickling dead people and selling overpriced caskets to mourning relatives of the dead people. Maybe if I repeat this enough to myself, I will manage to actually do it. And then, I will have ...um... money I guess. Job security as people are always gonna be dead. Mmyep.

If I do become a mortician, I will give my friends discounts. You know those little domed bits of plastic they put under your eyelids? With the little hooks that stab into your pickled eyelids and keep them closed, so that when your eyes sink into your head it looks like you still have eyes? Yeah. You get those for free, cos I am that sort of nice person. 

Oh. And I am wearing my skinny pants today and they are comfortable. I...actually have an inch of leeway all around which is pretty aweseome. Granted, my skinny pants were never that small to begin with, but it's a good feeling. DO NOT LESSEN THIS FOR ME. *sob* xD"

Must be all the slang. I know i missed on much of that. But I'm one to call it what it is, even if it is fun to use the not so technical terms. 

Baked more cake! HAHAHAH. Though, this one is out of a box, as I am lazy today. Still, it sounded good... I don't know if it will be. I have been so clumsy today, dropping shit and making messes and almost dumping half a stick of butter onto the floor. Jeebus. I'm surprised I am not smeared in cake batter."

"event","In my last post, I mentioned how it was a nice 70 degrees (about 20 celsius) here. It was sunny and beautiful and a person could frolic about in their t-shirt and flip flops. 

Now, that is only a dream.

There is about two inches or more of snow on the ground, and still snowing. Which is further proof that Kentucky is a schizophrenic state with random weather. Or, maybe it's proof for those psychotic little scientists that the Earth is cooling down/heating up. Perhaps they would stop gibbering and rocking back and forth in their corners for a moment to watch the weather here.

Which brings me to global warming/cooling. No one can agree if the warmer winters is a sign of global warming or the entire planet getting ready to freeze over. And, then, they also say that the winters are colder. This also can mean that the planet is warming/cooling, apparently. They don't really know. They just want something to to be frightened of. The thing is, darlinks, that none of this is going to happen in our lives, so no need to worry, really. Who cares about the next generation, or the one after that? I mean, look at the state of things now; obviously the generation before us did not care about what this generation would have to deal with.

Though, I am disappointed that we've nearly used up all the carboniferous forests that were thoughtfully laid down for us several million years ago. I wonder how much one of those Go Yellow cars would be, and if there would be any gas stations around here that would have that new fuel they're making from corn now... But you just know that all of those would be in California.

Mm. Corn."

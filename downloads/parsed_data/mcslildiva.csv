"event","Well, today was fun. Not. Actually, it wasn't too bad...

Had Survey of Music at 9--we talked about Leonard Bernstein today, the guy who wrote West Side Story. Of course, Dr. Dipree calls me out in front of the class and is like ""Heather's probably done West Side Story before. She's done pretty much everything!"" And then he was totally surprised when I told him I hadn't done it before. It was funny. It's cool he's got faith in me like that.

Then I had to go upstairs at 11 for One Spirit rehearsal...we ran through the pieces we're doing at the Show Choir concert tomorrow, it went okay. Bridge Over Troubled Water...my solo sounded like shit. But, I've been REALLY flemy lately, don't know what's up with that but, whatever. Left a little early to rehearse for the student recital I'm singing in on the 21st. My voice was still weak but, the song went okay: we ran through it once and it was perfect. I hate Mrs. Gibson as a piano teacher but, as an accompainist, she seems to follow me perfectly.

Then I went to theatre and nearly fell asleep. I'm still worn out from yesterday, lol. Dr. B understood though, I told him all about my day. Then I had a break where I got to eat (YAY) and went to Sociology, which was pretty pointless. Mr. McCormick didn't grace the class with his presence today. Then, Concert Choir...which went well. I wish I could sing soprano all the time...but, the altos need me. Anybody can sing loud, it's just a matter of hitting the right friggin' notes.

Directly after choir, I went upstairs to Show Choir rehearsal. People were really pissing me off with all of their talking when they didn't need to be but, everything looks alright. It's going to be a good show. I'm really kind of dreading the girls' ""Stop In The Name Of Love"" because they changed a movement on us like TODAY and the show's TOMORROW. People still don't know the words...so Ian, because he's in charge of the mics and sound and everything, cut the mics on half the girls. So the only people who are singing are ME, Marianne and Celena: all in One Spirit. My solo in Bridge Over Troubled Water sounded hella good this afternoon, Betty Neill had to yell at everyone in the group to stop looking at me, it was funny. People were like ""That was awesome"", ""That was one of the best times you've ever sang it""...so it made me feel better. I hope it goes well tomorrow night. I get a mic for that too, oh boy, lol.

We got out of that rehearsal at 6:50...and I was so bummed because play practice was at 7 and I had wanted to take a quick shower and everything (dancing under hot lights = SWEATY)...and all of us except one person in the play are in Show Choir...so our director gave us a 30 minute break before rehearsal to chill...I went and got some food, changed, and came back...to dance some more. We blocked the ""Sex"" scenes (which are reall dancing scenes)...yay for me burning lots and lots of calories, lol. I freak dance with Ian to ""Hot In Herre"" by Nelly, then dance with Justin (country line dancin...) to ""Who's Your Daddy?"" by Toby Keith, then mambo/tango with Bobby to ""Maria, Maria"" by Santana, then do the bunny hope with Ben to ""Let's Get It On"" by Marvin Gaye....we haven't done the second dance with me and Ian but, it's going to be good.

The weird thing was, when Ian and I were going through it, one part he's in front of me and I'm acting like I'm spankin' him and everything...then I get in front of him...and he's touching my shoulder and grinding against me...and whispers ""Yeah, move that ass""...I was like ""WOAH there buddy"". Not in public ;-) But then he was getting frustrated and he's tired and grumpy and blah blab blah. But I had fun during that rehearsal.

Then, we had dance rehearsal for ""Bye Bye Bye"", which is part of the Best Of The Boys (boyband meledy) we're doing for the show. Ian was being a dick and on a power trip and totally pissed me off: Ryan should be the one giving orders, not him. But, ya know, whatever....pissing me off makes me work harder so...:-) He didn't give me a hug or jack shit today, which was kinda weird, but whatever, it doesn't bother me. Let him do his thang, I'll do mine. But the boy is a talented beatboxer...I'll give him that...and a talented drummer.

Had a good talk with Ryan after the rehearsal and now I'm back in my room...chilling...getting ready to go to bed in a few....hope yall had a great night, much love!

Quotes of the Day...(stealing from Michelle)

""No....no.....HELL NO""--Ian in a break of his beat-box, holding the microphone to Matt to let him say something then taking it away each time and saying that, then breaking into beat-boxing again

""Baby cakes""-Nick
""More like 'my calves ache'-Me
(Baby cakes is a nickname Nick gave me because I call him sugarlumps...and I was commenting on how it should be 'my calves ache' because of all the dancing I did today!)"

"event","So yeah, definately had a long long long day today...woke up at 7:20 after going to bed at 4...had a One Spirit performance at 9...everybody was kinda tired and everything, our blend kinda sucked but, the people enjoyed it and that's all that matters...and they FED us! They had this awesome Brunswick stew thing that's like a Southern tradition or something...it was hella good. Of course, I didn't really wanna eat anything...still kinda insecure...but I did anyway.

We got back to the school around 2ish...and I had an hour to chill and relax before the Faculty recital at 3...that was nice. Roomie wasn't in, that made it even nicer. Of course, after talking to Ryan for a lil bit on the phone, I got to thinking about the whole Lindsay thing and everything...and it really brought me down...so I was kinda off for the rest of the afternoon.

The recital rocked, everyone was really awesome. Then, after the rectial, Bobby, Ryan, Andy, Bry and I went out to dinner at KFC. I told them all about the thing with Lindsay and that I thought she was right...I got YELLED AT, it was kinda funny. Bry's going to get me the book for the Atkins diet after Easter...I really want to make a change. Especially if I want to do all the things I want to do in my life. Then I came back around 6, changed into my One Spirit garb and went BACK up to Reeves to hand out programs for the orchestra concert. Negative feelings and all.

After the recital, I was just concentrating on putting my energy into moving music stands and chairs off the stage to set up for the show choir concert on Tuesday (which I'm in). And that's when TOTALLY cute Ian moment happened. He'd been watching me on and off all day, putting his hand on my shoulder when he approached the group, hugging me whenever he saw me...it was a nice reassurance that somebody did love me and was true to me...anyway, cute moment...

We were setting up the stage and people were moving the percussion off the stage and I was standing on the stage watching...the boys were taking care of it. We were both helping since we're in One Spirit and were helping out at the orchestra concert. He comes up behind me and touches my shoulder. When I turn to look at him and he just wraps his arms around me so I wrap my arms around him and my head is resting on his shoulder...and we're just swaying...and he's like ""Hear that music?"" and I go ""No"" and then he goes ""Me neither but that's what we're dancing to"" Then we both laughed and let go...but it was CUTE AS EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!

It was really nice...and it really made me feel like everything was going to be okay...he just let go too fast :-( I could've stayed there forever.

Anyway, after we got the stage all set up, we had an hour break and I came back and the roomie was here. Wasn't happy about that one. But what can ya do? I grabbed a change of clothes, talked to some peeps on-line, and left to talk to Emily and Ashley. Then I left, after changing in Emily's room and talking to her and Ash, and went up to Reeves for show choir dance rehearsal. I love dancing when I'm aggrevated...I put a lot more 'UMPH' into it.

So, Ian's like ""Call me when you get done up here so we can do that line through"" (he had to leave because he had an RA meeting to go to)...we have to be off book for the play by tomorrow....so I called him when we got done and me, Bobby, Ian and Ben had a line through....I'm pretty good on my lines except for two of my longer monolauges...I feel bad for Ian,he's got like TONS of lines because his character is nuts.

But now, after such a long day, I'm going to bed. Tomorrow's gonna be HELLA long too....I'm looking forward to it...."

"event","So yeah, I'm up at the friggin' butt-crack of dawn because I bave a One Spirit performannce at 9. I'm not excited, only got like 3.something hours of sleep...but that's because I was over at Ian's until 2:50ish, lol. And I'd REALLY fucking like to know why the hell my roomie just got out of bed. Ugh, my day will be great if I have a very limited amount of time with her. But, I don't think I'll be in my room a lot today. YAY!

Well, I'm gonna go get ready, let's hope I don't fall asleep at the performance, lol"

"event","Hey what's up people? Welcome to the new series of My So-Called Life....starring me. This week's episode is all about real friends.

So I was going through my computer today deleting my AIM logs. I have DeadAIM and it saves all of my conversations so, I was deleting them. Because, ya know, some of those are kinda personal shit I don't want the wrong people to find, ya know? It's common sense. Anyway, my roomie had been using my computer on Thursday and her conversations were all saved. I was going through them and deleting them when I came across one.

My roomie was talking about how she didn't want me to come back early and, yeah, sometimes I get like that and don't want her to come in so I didn't think anything of it. Then the person she was talking to said ""Well, just push her out the window and call it a suicide."" The rest of the convo went something like this:

Roomie: live on the first floor
Girl: Oh yeah
Roomie: too fat
Girl: LOL
Roomie: couldn't fit her through the window
Girl: oh yeah
Roomie: I couldn't pick her up 
Roomie: I think I would need a forklift
Girl: lol, yeah you probably would
Roomie: drama queen

And that's where it ended. Then she started talking about how this guy we thought was cute (he's a friend of our friend's) told our friend to give her his number and was all bragging about it...but still...

This from a girl who claimed I could go to her about anything? This from a girl I've roomed with for a year and a half who always encouraged me whenever I needed it? This from a girl who on our Random Acts of Recognition called me a beautiful person and all this other shit? 

It makes me wonder who the real her is. I honestly don't know anymore. Then, after I find out today, she comes in and is all happy-pappy and butting into my conversation with Ryan on the phone...griping to my friend Ashley how I take 45 minutes to get ready and you have to call me in advance for anything...laughing when I was fussing over my hair b/c Ian called and I couldn't dry it and said ""Ian called you? Why would he do that?"" Because he wanted to talk to me, gee, I don't know.....

I told some people about it--Ryan, Heather, Ashley and Ian knows part of it--I'm trying not to get paranoid over it...I just think that everybody feels the same way deep down inside....what if they do and they just aren't telling me? What if all they do is constantly badmouth me behind my back? I really don't want to tell Ian the whole thing because I'm scared he'll agree with her--HELL, I think everyone will. *sigh* I know I'm being stupid but...that's really how I feel right now.

People wonder why I have such big self-esteem issues and such a hard time completely trusting people. Because of SHIT LIKE THIS!!!!! Because people I think are such good friends of mine say shit like this and tear me up inside. Does anybody HONESTLY have any idea how low I feel everyday? How I can't stand to look in the mirror because I hate what I see? How everytime I go to a restaurant, the cafe--eat anything anywhere--I fight back the urge to run to the bathroom and puke it right back up? Does anybody have ANY FUCKING IDEA AT ALL?!?!?

I don't see myself like everyone does. Or maybe I do if everyone sees what Lindsay sees. I see a hideous beast staring back at me in the mirror, a blob...something I shouldn't be. And I really am trying to better myself, become the person I want to be. Trying to get past this negativity about everything and be happy. But god, it is so hard....especially when stuff like this happens...

I feel so down right now....but all I can do is hide it behind a smile...."

"event","<P><STRONG>Haha, so yeah, I havent written in here in a while. Basically cuz I got sick of everyone knowing my business, but oh well, everyone thinks they know whats going on anyways. so whatever.</STRONG> </P>
<P><EM>Last night me and April went to the show at the community center. Okay... Why are all the bands from our school Screamo? its really kinda lame people. But yeah it was kinda fun at times...No one was really there, so we all just left early. Me and April downloaded Kazaa so I could find a song I wanted, but we couldnt find it...So after she left I uninstalled it and downloaded Morpheus, which really hates my computer, but at least I got my song. Merril Bainbrigde's State of Mind. Its a <STRONG>really beautiful</STRONG> song.</EM> </P>
<P><EM><STRONG>Man, halloween is gonna suck this year. I dont think im doing anything. I'll probably end up giving candy to little kids. oh yeah thats insanely fun. whatever.</STRONG> </EM></P>
<P><EM>For some reason, i really want to hang out with certain people lately. Like Tiffany, i really want to visit her soon. and Ally and Maria, i want to hang out with them too. </EM></P>
<P><EM><STRONG>Haha, last night at the show, me and april saw this girl and she insanely reminded us of Steph. She was dressed like Steph dresses and she was playing with her hair the same way. i was like AHHH steph?! haha. it was kind of amusing.</STRONG></EM></P>
<P><EM>hmm...what else to say? My sister is leaving today, she visited from college this weekend. Shes so lucky, she goes to a culinary school, eats everything she wants, and is still so skinny. drives me insane!! lol she so lucky, she has a boyfriend, and theres so many guys at her college that want her too. shes so perfect, pretty, loved, smart, everything im not. and i have to be compared to her all the time. UGH! but i cant hate her for it, cuz shes so modest, and she doesnt think shes any of those things, but deep down she has to know shes lucky. she doesnt do the stupid things like i do.</EM></P>
<P><EM><STRONG>oh, last night i made a huge mistake of telling benjamin something i shouldnt have told. but of course im just so smart that i do shit like that.</STRONG></EM></P>
<P><EM>Where do i go from here? Or am i just like a clock spinning round? everything seems unclear, confusion is raising its head and i cant make a sound. I feel it tearing at my soul while I'm asleep. I feel it driving me to something I'll regret... Thats part of the song state of mind. <U>I LOVE IT</U>! im like, listening to it inccesantly over and over again. hehe.</EM></P>
<P><EM><STRONG>You see that I'm ferocious, You see that I'm weak, You see that I'm silly, and pretnious, and a freak...</STRONG></EM></P>
<P><EM>Okay, this is getting really lame. Bye. <STRONG>&lt;3 Jessi</STRONG></EM></P>"

"event","Ugggggh have i said lately how much i hate myself?! well i do. i hate everything about me. I hate my personality, i hate my legs, i hate my face, i hate my body, i hate my voice, i hate my hands, i hate my feet, i hate myself. I WANT TO DIE ALREADY. i mess everything up all the time. I cant look people in the eye. I have to get over these stupid fears of mine. Its not my fuckin fault though, i didnt do this to myself. ahh i need to cry. im just gonna cry myself to sleep before i do something stupid again like last night.

oh yeah i went to the doctor today and it was better than i thought. oh well. im still upset about today.

i also got 4 new books today. i think i still have one on the way, Wasted. but im not sure if i ordered it or not...man thats sad. i think i only ordered 5 books, and i got them all already, but im pretty sure i ordered wasted cuz it was the expensive one. ah fuck it. im going to go read my book and then cry myself to sleep."

"event","I have such random thoughts...i was reading my new book Ravenous and I couldnt concentrate on it... hmmm. well i was thinking about my strange lil habits. like take last monday for example. me, tara, mom, and david went to a restaraunt, and i realized that if what i order is the most expensive thing on the check, i feel so unbelievably guilty. I always have to have the cheapest thing on the check or else i feel so bad. i dont know why. 

I'm such a bad person...i went to the school today with stacey, and also april caught up with us. well, i was supposed to meet up with ben, and i did find him, but i was kind of a bitch to him cuz they were there. i really hate myself sometimes, i am such a bitch. josh and ryan and that other guy idk who it was were right, they were talking to ben and they said im gross and ew and shit. well ya know what, i fucking know that, they dont need to tell me, i already hate myself enough and i dont need them saying shit like that. im so fuckin fat today, it was prolly one of the worst birthdays i've ever had. and it was supposed to be my sweet 16. not so sweet. oh fuckin well. i dont even care anymore. stacey and i both took 2 pills today, and it didnt affect me at all, i think it made things worse. whatever. oh well. i actually kinda cant wait till i go back to schoool, cuz then i wont be tempted by this nasty shit.

but i really dont want to go back cuz i know its gonna be terrible. i hate going and putting on a mask, or a show for everyone. im such a fuckin liar, and i hate myself for it. i wish there was some way to tell everyone the truth and not have everyone hate me, and think im stupid.

ugh i really really really hate myself right now. im so weak and rude. ahhhhhhhhhh i just want to scream as loud as i can.

heres my schedule, if anyone cares. i doubt anyone even reads this, which is just as well cuz i really shouldnt write this shit in here, cuz im basically just digging myself in a deeper hole. but here
 
per 1- math- VanHorne
per 2- english- Moyer
per 3- gym (odd) Pietrocarlo study hall (even) Chambers
per 4- history- Meyer
per 5/6- Lunch
Per 7/14- Cosmetology

its gonna suck for cos, cuz all the preppy slutty bitches are gonna do it. and i already know i suck at it, im not good at anything. i'll prolly flunk it. at least i was able to drop chem, but i only wanted to drop it so i could take chorus, which is the one thing that would make me happy. im only happy when i sing, but no, i cant take it, and i definately cant take it senior year, cuz ill be at cos. in the morning when chorus is. fuck. these next 2 years are going to be living hell... oh well, hopefully i'll die before then. i really just want to, it would be so much fuckin easier than dealing with all this. 

on the 31st, i have to go to the doctor, i dont remember what for. my mom thinks its for my physical, but i dont need one now...i think it may be for a checkup on my medicine crap to see if its working, but oops, i havent taken it in...months. hah, screw it, im better off without the stupid shit, it didnt help me and it made me feel miserable. i just love taking other peoples medicine, even if that doesnt work too. man i fuckin hate taking pills, i choked on one today when stacey was here. but i still keep taking pills, just to see if something will work. ugh im so dumb, watch me end up dying one of these times cuz the pills have a fuckin bad reaction. hey, i wont complain. hah.

well, this is kind of boring and pointless and idk if anyone will read this. bye."

my kitten (nahche which means troublemaker) keeps trying to get on my desk which means she keeps jumping on my chair and scratching me to get up. shes a pain in the ass. well i know something she doesnt know, she has to go to the vet tomorrow for shots. hhehehe

my birthday is in 8 days. im not doing anything for my fuckin sweet 16. my mom and her bf arent going to be here which is a plus, but his stupid mom is gonna be here so i still wont be able to do anything

oh, on my bday i have to go to the school and change my schedule cuz i want to take chorus and i dont want to take chem. so oh freakin well

man this fuckin cat! i keep having to like throw her on my bed..lol

i went running with the dog tonight. did really well too. mr benedict called me today and was asking if i wanted to do cross country. i thought about it and im only gonna do it if stacey does cuz i dont like other people in my school. oh well, i dont really want to do it, i run enough at home and having to do it for something would take the fun out of it

i want to watch breakfast club, but david is up and if i go watch it he'll sit there with me and i hate watching tv with people unless i like them. and i definately do not like david.

"event","Okay, this is really pissing me off. Everyone is complaining about my whole little dieting thing. Well ya know what, its my body and my life and I can do whatever I want with it. If I want to kill myself I will damn well do it. But I'm not stupid enough to make myself lose that much weight. Um fuckin hello I'm not fuckin stupid. Get the hell over it, I wont listen to you. Now if you have something supportive to say, you can tell me, if you're going to tell me that I'm stupid for dieting, or I'm already thin enough, I really don't want to hear it, cuz I know what I want and I'm gonna get it. I'm willing to break myself, if thats what it takes.

Anyways...

Me and John had a madd fun chat today, he's so cool, we really have to get together soon, and have a staring contest. *wink wink* gotta love it.

Eliot is having major issues, he said to me- Capin S*****: i have mono cancer im subcontiously annorexic and bulimic and ppl think im a girl 

i laughed at that. Now I'm kind of worried. The doctors say he has mono...which ya know...is okay, i guess, he'll live. but the cancer thing he has stuck in his head, and he could have it, i dont know. and i think hes just making fun of me with the eating disorder thing. and i did the girl thing, i called him ma'am, cuz it was funny.

hmmm...sure, theres nothing else to say so byebye."

She's gonna come up for the Sauerkraut (OR HOWEVER U SPELL IT!) festival, so that will be fun. OMG we had the funniest thing happen to us on this one ride at the kendall carnival! We went on this ride...and it goes around and upside down, and the first time i had to ride with her bro Ridley and she rode alone, anyways this carnie held my scarf and was like whippin it at each of us when we came around and it was very odd. then me and steph went together and of course we were dressed like hooches, so our boobs were falling out of our shirts when we went upside down and that same guy was like woo everytime we passed him, and then we all rode together and when we passed the carnie hes like woo keep em in! and stuff like that, then when he goes to let us out he&nbsp;goes to steph ""them are some powerful guns ya got there"" it was hilarious! except for the fact that the belt thingy bit me and now my hip bones are sore. :( sad LOL. </P>
<P>i saw cait b, heather k, Steph B, and Hannah B at the carni so that was cool, havent seen most of them in a loooooong time especially heather and steph.</P>
<P>im kinda mad that i came home, now i gotta deal with David, the fat asshole. Hmmm...what else is new? Oh i was playin with stephs hair while she was playin some video game and i twisted a lil piece and it got all tangled so i tried to brush it. She hurt me. haha. I think i have bruises on my arm cuz she kept kicking me. I wonder why...its not like i was tickling her or anything haha! yeah so me and steph reconnected and im glad. and i really think that all the so called ""popular"" people in Kendall should get over all that shit about me being friends with her. She has no problem with me being friends with them...so get over it. I'm so glad I got out of Kendall, I actually grew up and learned that no matter who someone is friends with, it doesnt matter. SO I DONT CARE WHAT ANYONE THINKS I WILL BE FRIENDS WITH WHOEVER I WANT!</P>
<P>hmm...i wanna put a pic in here. of what, idk.

"event","<P>well...yesterday was fun. not. first of all, me, ally, fes, and allys brother david went to see dodgeball. of course ally and fes didnt want to see it, i told them we could see what they wanted to but no, they went and saw it and had a terrible time. oh wait, no they didnt, i did. okay i was supposed to be kinda like with fes. of course, ally and him went out before...and hes still not over her. so i spent the whole time talking to fuckin david, and trying not to cry, while ally and fes flirted. that was pleasant. ugh, i should have known, i know i cant compete with ally, people just love her, and im not as good as her. what the hell its not my&nbsp;fault im just a fuckin idiot who doesnt know what the hell shes doing. i hope i never do something as stupid as that ever again. i actually believed someone could like me... haha im so dumb. </P>
<P>anyways, i took my last final today, spanish. it was easy. haha before it, me and april went to the cafe. cuz she wanted breakfast and i stole a thing of golden grahams, and then christine showed up and got me another box of them, so im good. </P>
<P>hmm, im supposed to go shopping with ally and ben tomorrow, that will be fun, except that ben like, doesnt like me. what the hell, he probably loves ally too and just thinks im obnoxious. haha.</P>
<P>ugh this is depressing. bye.</P>"

In other words, you're a total (brilliant) geek.
It's difficult for you to find people worth spending time with.
Which is probably why you'll take over the world with your evil robots!

Personally I want to believe him because it would just make everything go away, but part of me tells me WTF he's never done anything right for you to believe him now. Oh well....who knows.

"event","I read an article today about a guy and his buddies found some money burried behind one of their homes. At the end of the article is says, ""I'd rather just burn the money than cause problems with my friends."" Sometimes I wish you could do that with people.  As all of you who read this know, Jenny and I are fighting like an old married couple, but whenever I ask anybody for advice I get the same answer. Is fighting over a guy really worth your friendship? Of course I say no, but I'm sure she is getting some of the same advice and if she thinks I am worth losing over a guy, shouldn't I think she is worth losing over a guy?  Though I can't feel that way about somebody I've been best friends with for like 6 years, I wish I could sometimes. I don't think any of my friends are worth losing over a guy, even my friends that I'm not really that close with I wouldn't think are worth losing for a guy. Somebody once told me, ""a best friend is somebody you'll always have around,"" I guess if thats true, I never really had a best friend then. Not that at the time I didn't think that we'd be friends forever, but right now, it seems like we'll never be friends again. Who knows anymore 'cause I sure don't, 'cause right now my life feels like I've spent the last 6 years being friends with somebody so that they could get to the next mountain top, just to throw me over the edge."

"event","Ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah
I'm giving up on everything
Because you messed me up
Don't know how much you
Screwed it up
You never listened
That's just too bad
Because I'm moving on
I won't forget
You were the one that was wrong
I know I need to step up and be strong
Don't patronize me

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Went back home again
this sucks gotta pack up and leave again
say goodbye to all my friends
can't say when I'll be there again
It's time now to turn around
Turn my back on
EVERYTHING.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

And I wanna believe you,
When you tell me that it'll be ok,
Ya I try to believe you,
But I don't

When you say that it's gonna be,
It always turns out to be a different way,
I try to believe you,
Not today, today, today, today, today...

I don't know how I'll feel,
tomorrow, tomorrow,
I don't know what to say,
tomorrow, tomorrow
Is a different day

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 wake up in the morning
Put on my face
The one that's gonna get me
Through another day
Doesn't really matter
How I feel inside
'Cause life is like a game sometimes

But then you came around me
The walls just disappeared
Nothing to surround me
And keep me from my fears
I'm unprotected
See how I've opened up
Oh, you've made me trust

Because I've nver felt like this before
I'm naked
Around you
Does it show?
You see right through me
And I can't hide
I'm naked
Around you

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Are you aware of what you make me feel, baby
Right now I feel invisible to you, like I'm not real
Didn't you feel me lock my arms around you
Why'd you turn away?
Here's what I have to say I was left to cry there,
waiting outside there grinning with a lost stare
That's when I decided 


Why should I care
Cuz you weren't there when I was scared I was so alone
You, you need to listen I'm starting to trip,
I'm losing my grip and I'm in this thing alone

Am I just some chick you place beside you to take somebody's place
when you turn around can you recognize my face you used to love me,
you used to hug me
But that wasn't the case
Everything wasn't ok I was left to cry there
waiting outside there grinning with a lost stare
That's when I decided 


Crying out loud I'm crying out loud
Crying out loud I'm crying out loud

Open your eyes
Open up wide
Why should I care
Cuz you weren't there
when I was scared I was so alone Why should I care
Cuz you weren't there when I was scared I was so alone
Why should I care
If you don't care then I don't care were not going newhere
Why should I care cuz you weren't there when I was scared I was so alone
Why should I care If you don't care then i don't care were not going anywhere

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

""Take Me Away""  
I cannot find a way to describe it
It's there inside; all I do is hide
I wish that it would just go away
What would you do, you do, if you knew
What would you do

All the pain I thought I knew
All my thoughts lead back to you 
Back to what was never said
Back and forth inside my head
I can't handle this confusion
I'm unable; come and take me away

I feel like I am all alone
All by myself I need to get around this
My words are cold, I don't want them to hurt you
If I show you, I don't think you'd understand
Cause no one understands

"event","It's 2 AM and I'm the only person up.....go figure. Of course I'm at work and that makes a difference. I'm starting to get really tired though since I haven't slept much. I think I need to go get some M&M's. I bought some dill pickle chips and mt dew though so that should do me, but it's not working. I keep yawning and my eyes are REALLY heavy. I guess being on this probably doesn't help matters though. Oh well."

So I am giving up all belief and chance of finding happiness. My chance came and went, and I couldn't come close to the competition. Nobody else I ever meet will come close to comparing to such a perfect flower. But it's time to move onward and find consoling, since happiness is ever eluding."

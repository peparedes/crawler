"event","So I think I've finally figured out the way to make this thing work pour moi.  I mean in a looks like a fun thing to do sort of way.  Anyhow so here's what's been goingn on.
I have discovered that LSS has been taking money out of my wallet... and when I say taking I mean stealing.  That, and she has been lying about absolutely everything, I mean she admited it, but lied about why she did it, which makes things needlessly complex.  GREH it pisses me off like a piss offing thing on piss off tablets.  I wish she'd just admit that she's been taking it cause she has a problem and let it drop.
Next.  Mook found a cd by a band called Llama at Sonic Temple and it is now a part of my ""Ode to Llama"" collection.  It's a pretty good band surprisingly.  Not what I usually listen to, but good in a chill-out sort of way.  I really like the second song on the album... I don't remember what it's called I think it's something along the lines of ""Back Where We Began"" or something. 
Bleh... my life is actually the most boring thing in the world.  I think I'll eat a banana and make everything better."

"event","Hmmm...
What to say when you don't er... know what to say.  I figure since this is my very first ever entry it should be pretty damned awesome.  Alas I have absolutely nothing to say.  It'd be one thing if I was full of crazy anecdotes about various different things... of a er... funny-ish type nature, however it seems that I am at a lack of things to say.  Nothing... nadda.  Isn't that just how these things go.  And yet I seem to have typed out a lot so far... which just proves the point that although I talk a lot, I say very little.

Pursue thy conquest!"

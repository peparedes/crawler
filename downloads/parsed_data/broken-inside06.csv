"event","A Good Friend 

*In kindergarten your idea of a good friend was the person who let you have the red crayon when all that was left was the ugly black one. 

*In first grade your idea of a good friend was the person who went to the bathroom with you and held your hand as you walked through the scary halls. 

*In second grade your idea of a good friend was the person who helped you stand up to the class bully. 

*In third grade your idea of a good friend was the person who shared their lunch with you when you forgot yours on the bus. 

*In fourth grade your idea of a good friend was the person who was willing to switch square dancing partners in gym so you wouldn't have to be stuck do-si-do-ing with Nasty Nick or Smelly Susan. 

*In fifth grade your idea of a friend was the person who saved a seat on the back of the bus for you. 

*In sixth grade your idea of a friend was the person who went up to Nick or Susan, your new crush, and asked them to dance with you, so that if they said no you wouldn't have to be embarrassed. 

*In seventh grade your idea of a friend was the person who let you copy the social studies homework from the night before that you had. 

*In eighth grade your idea of a good friend was the person who helped you pack up your stuffed animals and old baseball but didn't laugh at you when you finished and broke out into tears. 

*In ninth grade your idea of a good friend was the person who would go to a party thrown by a senior so you wouldn't wind up being the only freshman there. 

*In tenth grade your idea of a good friend was the person who changed their schedule so you would have someone to sit with at lunch. 

*In eleventh grade your idea of a good friend was the person who gave you rides in their new car, convinced your parents that you shouldn't be grounded, consoled you when you broke up with Nick or Susan, and found you a date to the prom. 

*In twelfth grade your idea of a good friend was the person who helped you pick out a college/university, assured you that you would get into that college/university, helped you deal with your parents who were having a hard time adjusting to the idea of letting you go... 

*At graduation your idea of a good friend was the person who was crying on the inside but managed the biggest smile one could give as they congratulated you. *The summer after twelfth grade your idea of a good friend was the person who helped you clean up the bottles from that party, helped you sneak out of the house when you just couldn't deal with your parents, assured you that now that you and Nick or you and Susan were back together, you could make it through anything, helped you pack up for university and just silently hugged you as you looked through blurry eyes at 18 years of memories you were leaving behind, and finally on those last days of childhood, went out of their way to give you reassurance that you would make it in college as well as you had these past 18 years, and most importantly sent you off to college knowing you were loved. 

*Now, your idea of a good friend is still the person who gives you the better of the two choices, holds your hand when you're scared, helps you fight off those who try to take advantage of you, thinks of you at times when you are not there, reminds you of what you have forgotten, helps you put the past behind you but understands when you need to hold on to it a little longer, stays with you so that you have confidence, goes out of their way to make time for you, helps you clear up your mistakes, helps you deal with pressure from others, smiles for you when they are sad, helps you become a better person, and most importantly loves you!"

"event","At approxamently 7:45 this morning on the way to school I was riding with Jillian and her Mom and we hit an ice patch and lost control of the car. We ended up going ass end first into a snow bank. I was in back and so i went in first. It was probably the most scariest thing of my life. It wasn't her fault though it happens to the best of us. We had to wait for the police officer Bill Laughlin then the Tow guy to come pull us out. WE were all very upset and scared. EVERYONE IS OKAY THOUGH SO THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS. Now i am at home because i missed MEA""s so there is not a point in going to school. ahh well"

<h2>Gemini - Your Love Profile</h2>
<b>Your positive traits:</b>
<br><br>
Your lively, outgoing attitude attracts people to you everywhere you go.<br>
You can talk your way into - and out of - any situation you desire.<br>
You're adaptable enough to flirt with anyone - and people tend to fight over you.
<br><br>
<b>Your negative traits:</b>
<br><br>
You get easily bored in relationships, and tend to jump from person to person.<br>
You tend to be a bit of a player - and have a high tolerance for drama in relationships.<br>
Not the most emphathetic person, you tend to tell lovers to ""get over"" their problems.
<br><br>
<b>Your ideal partner:</b>
<br><br>
Is intelligent and quick witted enough to keep you interested.<br>
Is a bit of a shape shifter, providing you with the variety you crave.<br>
An open minded person, who's willling to have a non-traditional relationship.
<br><br>
<b>Your dating style:</b>
<br><br>
Exciting. If your date shows you a new experience (like Egyptian food or scuba diving), you're very happy.
<br><br>
<b>Your seduction style:</b>
<br><br>
Experimental: it's rare that you try the same thing twice.<br>
Ultra kinky - you do stuff that's not even in books yet.<br>
Hot and cold... sometimes you're just not into the whole sex thing.
<br><br>
<b>Tips for the future:</b>
<br><br>
Settle down a little. Sometimes good things come with time - so don't let people go so fast.<br>
Acknowledge that you're a player and flirt. If your mate can't live with this, find someone who can.<br>
Give your partner a little more attention. You don't have to be a social butterfly all the time.
<br><br>
<b>Best place to meet someone online: </b>
<br><br>
<a href=""http://blogthings.com/match.html"">Match.com</a> - enough sexy singles for you to find a new playmate when you get restless
<br><br>
<b>Best color to attract mate:</b> Sunny yellow
<br><br>
<b>Best day for a date:</b> Wednesday 
<br><br>

in Serenity. Calm, inspiring, and nearly always<br>level-headed. You have a

You probably have a soothing and beautiful voice to<br>match you and you are seen
as a mature, motherly figure. You don't show much<br>emotion which may make you
appear emotionless and distant at times, but you<br>are most likely a very
empathetic individual. You keep your head in bad<br>situations and are calm even in
good ones. You probably wear more flowing clothing<br>in light pastel colors and
one of your most beautiful feature is your smooth<br>and young face. Some people
may even be inspired simply by your presence, you<br>would make a great mediator or
negotiator as people know they can trust and count<br>on you for a peaceful

"event","Well i am at the wondful hermon high right now sitting in Computer Concepts bored off my ass.  I always finish my homework within the first 20 mins and then I have an hour to sit and do absolutely nothing at all.  I just got done texting adam and craig and stephanie.  Now, i texted Jill god I am bored and I cna't wait to talk to Adam on the phone.  It should be great fun.  Anyway here are some lyrics ot uhh spice things up?

EMINEM LYRICS

""Mockingbird""

Yeah
I know sometimes things may not always make sense to you right now
But hey, what daddy always tell you?
Straighten up little soldier
Stiffen up that upper lip
What you crying about?
You got me

Hailie I know you miss your mom and I know you miss your dad
When I'm gone but I'm trying to give you the life that I never had
I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh
I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you want to cry
Cuz you're scared, I ain't there?
Daddy's with you in your prayers
No more crying, wipe them tears
Daddy's here, no more nightmares
We gon' pull together through it, we gon' do it
Laney uncles crazy, aint he?
Yeah but he loves you girl and you better know it
We're all we got in this world
When it spins, when it swirls
When it whirls, when it twirls
Two little beautiful girls
Lookin' puzzled, in a daze
I know it's confusing you
Daddy's always on the move, mamma's always on the news
I try to keep you sheltered from it but somehow it seems
The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me
All the things growing up his daddy that he had to see
Daddy don't want you to see but you see just as much as he did
We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me
But things have gotten so bad between us
I don't see us ever being together ever again
Like we used to be when we was teenagers
But then of course everything always happens for a reason
I guess it was never meant to be
But it's just something we have no control over and that's what destiny is
But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep
Maybe one day we'll wake up and this will all just be a dream

[Chorus]
Now hush little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up little lady, i told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
We feel how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But i promise momma's gon' be alright

It's funny
I remember back one year when daddy had no money
Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up
And stuck 'em under the tree and said some of 'em were from me
Cuz daddy couldn't buy 'em
I'll never forget that Christmas I sat up the whole night crying
Cuz daddy felt like a bum, see daddy had a job
But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom
And at the time every house that we lived in
Either kept getting broke into and robbed
Or shot up on the block and your mom was saving money for you in a jar
Tryna start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
Almost had a thousand dollars till someone broke in and stole it
And I know it hurt so bad it broke your momma's heart
And it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart
Mom and dad was arguin' a lot so momma moved back
On the Chalmers in the flat one bedroom apartment
And dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara
And that's when daddy went to California with his CD and met Dr. Dre
And flew you and momma out to see me
But daddy had to work, you and momma had to leave me
Then you started seeing daddy on the T.V. and momma didn't like it
And you and Laney were to young to understand it
Papa was a rollin' stone, momma developed a habit
And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand
Cuz all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud
Now I'm sittin in this empty house, just reminiscing
Lookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out
To see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now
Wow, guess you pretty much are and daddy's still here
Laney I'm talkin' to you too, daddy's still here
I like the sound of that, yeah
It's got a ring to it don't it?
Shh, momma's only gone for the moment

[Chorus]

And if you ask me too
Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird
I'mma give you the world
I'mma buy a diamond ring for you
I'mma sing for you
I'll do anything for you to see you smile
And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine
I'mma break that birdies neck
I'd go back to the jewler who sold it to ya
And make him eat every carat don't fuck with dad (haha)

  Aww man i love that song ""Mockingbird""  err maybe i have time to add one quiz :)

"event","Well there are a bunch of people here for the Superbowl but I am in the Computer Room being Anti-Social as usuall beacuse I don't really like football and my family is all crazy over it. My dad is like PATRIOTS all the way.   Being anti-social kinda sucks but i don't want ot hang out wiht a bunch of old people either.  So today my mom gave me her digital camera today.  Well i am going to make payments on it but still I am quite excited. This means tommorow I can bring my camera to school and get some pics of people.  It should be fun.  Anyway here are some quotes that relate to me that i found. 

You see her in the hallway, laughing and smiling, you wouldn't know that she cried herself to sleep last night.

*don't regret something that once made you smile*

I'm always the FRIEND never the GIRL.

-Only a True Friend Know's What's Behind My Tears-

I want to HATE you so bad but I can't.

LIFE is like a PEN you can cross out your PAST but you CAN'T erase it.  

)(but nothing seems to be important anymore)(

*sometiems it's the tears that make you laugh, and the smiles that make you cry*
===========================================================================================
Wow something just came to my head. Am i spoiled?  I just caught myself telling a good friend of mine I get anythign I want.  Well not anything but I really think my parents try to buy my love.  I wanted my mom's digi camera and in reality i probably won't pay for it.  She won't make me.  If I want to go somewhere most of the time she will take me or let em use the car without putting gas in.  Maybe I am not spoiled but am i selfish?  My sister said I was today because I made a whole slideshow revolved around me and my family.  All these questions keep poppin in my head.  I don't want to be spoiled and I don't want to be selfish.   
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You know what I really want?  I really want to be loved.  I have loved people and got nothign in return.  Or i have loved people and have gotten heart broken.  There is one person I care abotu greatly and he is 3 hours away.  All the way in Masardis Maine.  It's too abd really because he's cool and I havn't seen him for 2 years and I miss him.  I also miss his cousin who never talks to me anymore.  Crystal if you ever read this I MISS YOU!  
<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3

Today When I made the slide show, I came across a picture of my GReat Grammy Vicnaire.  I realized how much time changes things.  God I miss her.  R.I.P. Grammy.  I knwo you're watching down on me.  I know i have done some things wrong but I know you'll forgive me.  

All this writing bring sup so many memories of peopel i miss so R.I.P. Grampy willey too...i love you and miss you

You<br>are constantly hurt and depressed... No one<br>seems to understand how you feel because<br>everyone is scared to get close to you... You<br>long to be able to reach out and tell someone<br>everything, and all of your problems... But you<br>have no one to tell, or they just don't seem to<br>want to hear what you have to say. You've been<br>hurt many times that you don't seem to have any<br>tears left to shed, or if you do, they're an<br>endless river flowing... You've started to hide<br>and bottle up all or your problems and<br>feelings, hoping that maybe they just will go<br>away... You want company, but at the same time,<br>you're scared of it. Your sanctuary is your<br>room where you can just be alone and try to<br>throw away all of your aching pains. You're<br>dark and mysterious and people like you for<br>that reason. Even if you think you're all by<br>yourself in the dark, someone is always there<br>with you. Your special someone wants to admit<br>and show their feelings towards you, but<br>they're afraid of how you'll take it. Get out<br>more and enjoy life because, it is far too long<br>to frown your way through :)

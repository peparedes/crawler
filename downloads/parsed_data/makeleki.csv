I've picked up 3 additional shifts this week. Eeee!

Next week is Winter Music Conference! Super excited for some crazy shifts and cute outfits ^^

Next on the Red Bull list are Eshots. Eager to taste them.

Tommorow is going to be madness for me:
Shadowing, Mini Lunch break, Lab, Work, Poochie.

Well, I've received all my furniture. Now it's a matter of assembling it. Can take an entire weekend -_-. I'm still missing a mattress since I upgraded to full ^_^ I had no idea mattresses would be SO expensive. But I guess it's valid since we spend about 1/3 of our lives in it. Best invest in a real good one. 

I'm taking the last two courses I need for the PA program. So far I like both my professors. One is quirky and the other one is very optimisitc, though I may probably need a hearing aid -_- I've been waiting for a course like Microbiology. I really miss biology courses. The only downside is that the campus is so far from my house and my lab happens to be the same distance from my house but north. I despise Hialeah for its consistently atrocious traffic.

My sister's coming in April :) She's walking for graduation. Not sure how long she'd be here though. I'm so eager for her to meet Bongo. She'd totally fall in love.

I started a diet to reset my body. I'm like a fish that doesn't know when to stop eating. Therefore, I'm constricting my eating habits and working out a whole week, everyday for 30 minutes. I'm ridiculously out of shape that it shames me.

I need to work more.

Finally, we saw this piece. Karen fell in love cause it reminded her of Harry Potter.

I took my only final last night. Easiest thing ever. Forty minutes and I was OUT. 

Tuesday, Aly was so nice in accompanying me to do my Christmas shopping. I knocked off more than half of my list and we only went to one place. I'm still unsure of what to get my Dad. 

Bongo is psycho. I'm going to have to sedate him and take him to a professional pet groomer cause it was impossible to cut his hair last time. He was biting and growling. I'd never seen him in that state.

The Red Bull holiday party is tommorow. We have yet to receive any details on it -_-. So much drama going on at the moment. I can't wait for it all to be over.

Bowling with Pilar tonight. This weather is slowly removing any desire of me to go out.

I think I want to take a trip to Disney.

I've had a cough for the past three days.
Last night I almost choked from how dry my throat was.
Apparently, my mother and father have the same symptoms.
It doesn't seem like it's going anywhere. It's just there to make my life slightly miserable."

Honestly, where does time go. I ask myself this every time we reach the end of the week.

Unbelievable.

Bongo has gotten quite big. He's starting to grow out his darker hair, although his face still looks like he ran into a paint brush XD I hope he's more pepper than salt /crosses fingers

I had accompanied Aly yesterday to the pet shop I purchased Bongo from, and I don't know why the owner was compelled to tell me that they're receiving a black, female Miniature Schnauzer next week. WHY? If I had the money and time, I'd take that bitch in a heartbeat!

/sigh

My sister finally got her house. It's sooo nice and modernized. She's super thrilled, naturally.


No more updates to share.

"event","When I first met my SpottieOttieDopalicious Angel
I could remember that damn thing like yesterday
The way she moved reminded me of a Brown Stallion horse
With skates on, smooth like a hot comb
on nappy ass hair
I walked up on her & was almost paralyzed
Her neck was smelling sweeter
than a plate of yams with extra syrup
Eyes beaming like four karats apiece just blindin' a nigga
Felt like I achieved a whole O of that Presidential
My heart was beating so damn fast
never knowing this moment would bring another
life into this world...


I <b>love</b> Outkast."

"event","So yesterday I got <i>another</i> surprise from Poochie. 
He, Aly, and Ary took me to the movies. I honestly, thought we were going to watch <i>Iron Man</i> or possibly an early screening to <i>Indiana Jones</i>. I was obviously wrong.
George walks me to the theater and as we get closer, puts on the biggest smile. I looked up at the marquee and read <i>DEATH NOTE</i>. I died and came back to life. 
WHAT.THE.FUCK.
I was in absolute awe pretty much the entire night thereafter.
The movie was great! Even though the events played out in different ways in relation to the manga/anime, they did a decent job of carrying it out. I did wish it hadn't been English dubbed. Japanese acting does it justice. But, I can't complain cause it wasn't horrible either. 

I can't wait for the second part :D

Off to do some studying!

"event","I GOT A PSP YESTERDAY!
I've always thought it was cool but I felt like I really had no use for it. That's why I bought a DS. But it's considerably functional and I'm mostly looking forward to watching anime on it. So thanks Poochie! ;)

I took Bongo to the Vet yesterday morning for his vaccine follow-up. He gained 1.2lbs and now weighs 6.4lbs. He eats like a beast and poops like crazy; expected from a pup -_-. I'm quite happy that they offered a health plan for dogs cause I was on my way to going bankrupt with all the vaccines and preventative measures. 

Aly and I ended up at Kid Robot yesterday XD I have this crazy compulsion of buying something every time I show up. <i>Everyone</i> pretty much knows me there and expects me to bring a Red Bull lol. It's sad really. They also want me broke >_<. Aly is ON HER WAY to the same. Lawl. <3.

Today, more studying. I'm 1/4 away finishing my notes for chapters. I have the Physical Chem section left to do. After that, memorizing for 2 months straight. /dies

I'm off to see what mischief Bongo is up to!

p.s. I'm currently obsessed with Fedde Le Grande's DJ/mixing skills. The guy is <i>sick</i>.
& Tiesto made a remix of Late Night Alumni's ""Empty Streets"". It's sooo good :D"

I <i>need</i> to see his upcoming film."

His name is Bongo (courtesy of my father), although I had wanted Roxas. But Bongo is both English and Spanish friendly lol. He is 3 months old and  is the perfect balance between playful and calm.


I'm the happiest girl ever!
<333.


p.s. I'm, honestly, debating whether to cut his ears or not. I'm a sucker for floppy ears -_-."

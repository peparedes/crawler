If shape it might be call'd, that shape had none,
Distinguishable in member, joint, or limb;

For each seem'd either; black it stood as night,
Fierce as ten furies, terrible as Hell,
And shook a dreadful dart; what seem'd his head
The likeness of a kingly crown had on.
Satan was now at hand; and from his seat
The monster, moving onward, came as fast
With horrid strides; Hell trembled as he strode.""

"event","<P>In life, we are always setting goals for ourselves and working to make them happen. This gives us focus and ensures that we use our time and energy efficiently and effectively. It also provides us with a sense of purpose and direction. We know where we are going and what we want to do. But quite often, due to forces outside our control, things do not go as we had planned-the flat tire on the way to the wedding, the unforeseen flu virus-and we have to adjust to a postponement or create a whole new set of circumstances. Even positive turns of fortune - an unexpected influx of cash or falling in love - require us to be flexible and to reconsider our plans and priorities, sometimes in the blink of an eye. This is what happens when life throws you a curve ball. </P>
<P>The ability to accept what is happening and let go of your original expectations is key when dealing with these unexpected turns of fate. We have a tendency to get stuck in our heads, clinging to an idea of how we think life should go, and we can have a hard time accepting anything that doesn't comply with that idea. The fact is that life is unpredictable. The trip you thought was for business - and when the deal fell through, you got depressed - actually landed you at the airport two days earlier than planned so you could meet the love of your life. Your car breaks down, and you are late for an appointment. While it's true that you never arrive at that important meeting, you end up spending a few relaxing hours with people you would never have met otherwise. </P>
<P>In order to keep us awake to opportunity and to teach us equanimity, the universe throws us the occasional curve ball. Remember that curve balls are not only life's way of keeping us awake, which is a gift in and of itself; they are also often life's way of bringing us wonderful surprises. Next time a curve ball comes your way, take a deep breath, say thank you, and open your mind to a new opportunity.<BR></P>"

"event","THE FOUR STAGES of BURNOUT: PART I
by The ""Stress Doc""
Mark Gorkin, LICSW

Years ago, a magical moment whirled me in a mystical web. I was consumed by the path of ""academic flashdancing."" I succumbed to the ""burnout tango."" Now let me not just walk the talk, but deromance the dance: ""Burnout is the gradual process by which a person, in response to prolonged stress and physical, mental, and emotional strain, detaches from work and other meaningful relationships. The result is lowered productivity, cynicism, confusion...a feeling of being drained, having nothing more to give."" Whether at work or school (or even in a marriage), to prevent it you must get it. To provide a framework both for understanding and, hopefully, inoculating against future burnout, let's begin with ""The Stress Doc's Vital Lesson of the Four 'R's"": 

If no matter what you say or what you do, Results, Rewards, Recognition, and Relief are not forthcoming, and you can't mean ""no"" or won't let go...trouble awaits. The groundwork is being laid for apathy, callousness and despair. 

Have I captured your attention? Let's examine some of the progressive signs of being caught up in this erosive spiral. Here are the first two of ""The Four Stages of Burnout"": 


1. Physical, Mental, and Emotional Exhaustion. Maybe you are still holding it together at work (or school). Still, can you relate to this sequence? As soon as you get home, you head for the fridge, get out the Haagen-Dazs or Ben and Jerry's, turn on the tube, collapse on the sofa, and you're comatose for the rest of the evening. Doing more with less, having plenty of responsibility but not enough authority, or juggling an unmanageable schedule is taking a toll. (For those grappling with all three stressors...automatically proceed to stage two, if not three.)

Normally, you pride yourself on doing a thorough job, a high quality performance. Now you are looking for shortcuts, if not cutting corners. And this gnaws at your self-esteem. There may even be pangs of guilt. A case of the ""brain strain"" is developing, accompanied by an energy shortage and feelings of exhaustion. If stress levels continue unabated, you may be ripe for the second stage. 

2. Shame and Doubt. Perhaps this scenario is familiar. A supervisor (or professor) asks you to take on a new assignment. You want to...but this voice inside silently screams, ""Who are you kidding!"" So what's happening? You're not feeling confident about the future; and you're feeling pretty lousy in the present. Not surprisingly, you may even start discounting your past accomplishments. Beware...This is not a logical process; it's a psychological one. Now you wonder if colleagues, friends or family members will detect that something is wrong. While projecting a competent image has been the norm, now this voice inside is relentlessly shouting, ""Impostor!""

And then you catch yourself emitting heavy, labored sighs. When do people often engage in deep, labored breathing or sighing (other than when calling those 1-900 numbers)? When experiencing a deep sense of loss and change perceived as uncontrollable. Is chronically grappling with a profound sense of vulnerability or uncertainty anyone's favorite state? Certainly not mine. No surprise then that some folks will ""progress"" to the third phase: ""Cynicism and Callousness."" 

Are you starting to feel I've been looking in your window? Or, as a reader recently e-mailed: ""Have you been a fly on the wall in my house?"" Let's not be premature. We still have two more stages to go. And next time, we'll check out your attitude. Until then...Practice Safe Stress!

***How to kill using bamboo rods**

Well take a bamboo stick or better yet a knife and put any type of animal excrements (shit) on the knife or the sharpened bamboo rod... Plant the knife or rod in the ground firmly... When someone steps on it they most likely will die of blood loss or the foriegn elements(shit) which been put in they're blood stream will definetly kill him.

---> hand to hand combat <---

Get an 2 ace bandages and 2 knifes with blades on both sides... wrap the knife to the top of you hand using the ace bandage, be sure to be able to clench your fist so you can climb & punch. This is sick to do... So I wouldn't suggest doing it unless we are under a russian attack.

===> The bog trap <===

When in a bog... You can remove the stumps in the bog and be left with a large hole... Now throw the stump away and cover the pit with the dry grass which be found anywhere in the bog most likely... You can even put this grass on top of a still pond as long as it is still! If it moves forget it!

And lastly remember that when either having a pretend war or a gang war use the bogs to your best advantage... They are usually warm water and hide you quickly and easily... Trees are never to be used! They can be fatal to the climber... think of how you can be surrounded in seconds and not be able to get back down..."

I  have been unable to sleep since I forced my daughter to break off her engagement to you.  I am ashamed of myself. I don't quite know how to begin this letter of apology. It is my sincere hope that you will bring yourself to forgive and forget what has passed between us in recent months.

I was much too sensitive about your Mohawk hair cut, tattoos, and nose piercings.  I now realize motorcycles aren't really that dangerous. I really should not have reacted the way I did to the fact that you are 24 years of age and have never held a job.  I am sure, too, that some other very nice people live under the bridge in the park.Sure, my daughter is only 17 and wants to marry you instead of going to Harvard on a Fulbright scholarship. After all, you can't learn everything about life from books.

I sometimes forget how backward I can be. I was wrong. I was a fool. I have now come to my  senses. You now have my full blessings to marry my daughter.

Sincerely,

Your future father-in-law.

P.S. Congratulations on winning the Powerball Lottery"

  While this was on the edge of intolerable, she kept silent.

  The next morning, the man woke his wife with a pinch on each of her breasts and said, ""You know, if you firmed these up, we could get rid of your bra.""

"event","<P>Joint research by the Australian Institute of Criminology and South Australia Police Major Crime Investigation Branch has examined 163 attempted and completed contract killings in Australia between the period 1 July 1989 and 30 June 2002. The research showed that the motive of the instigator varied between attempted and completed contract killings. The most common motive for attempted contract killings was the 'dissolution of a relationship' (n = 28) followed by 'money' (n = 17) and 'silencing of witnesses' (n = 17). Of the completed contract killings where the motive of the instigator was known, the most common motive was criminal networks (n = 15). In such cases, the murder is committed in the furtherance of a criminal enterprise or to facilitate criminal behaviour. Typically a killing is ordered in relation to organised crime, against a rival drug trafficker or member of an established criminal network to silence them from interfering with business.</P>

Those<br>that think they know you tend to place you<br>closer to evil on a scale of good and evil,<br>which might not be true. What people see may<br>not be who you actually are.

HEE HEE.....

  You are indeed a scary person. You kill for<br>sexual gratification, or in some cases you are<br>taking out your aggressions on innocent victims<br>for feeling rejected. You have thought about it<br>for a long time. I would most compare you to<br>Ted Bundy or John Wayne Gacey ( my favorite<br>)Gacey was beaten by his father all the time,<br>and Bundy always felt abnormal since he<br>discovered his older sister was his mother.

         Men women, or children which ever you<br>prefer, will live in fear of you. People such<br>as yourself may never change, but when when<br>caught ( which the majority are ) your foul<br>experience can help a great deal in catching<br>future serial killers, and who knows, you might<br>get a plea bargain. It's happened before.

"event","According to a news report, a certain private school in Victoria, Australia, recently was faced with a unique
problem.

A number of 12 year old girls were  beginning to use
lipstick and would put it on in the bathroom.

That was fine, but after they put on their lipstick they
would press their lips to the mirror leaving  dozens of little
lip prints.

Every night, the maintenance man would remove them and the
next day, the girls would put them back.

Finally, the principal decided that something had to be 
done.

She called all the girls to the bathroom and met them there with the maintenance man.

She explained that all these lip prints were causing a major problem for the custodian who had to clean the mirrors every night.

To demonstrate how difficult it had been to clean the mirrors, she asked the maintenance man to show the girls how much effort was required.

He took out a long-handled squeegee, dipped it in the toilet, and cleaned the mirror with it.

Since then, there have been no lip prints on the mirror. There are teachers, and then there are  educators....."

"event","We always hear ""the rules"" from the female side.

Now here are the rules from the male side. These are 'OUR' rules!

1. Learn to work the toilet seat. You're a big girl. If it's up, put it down. We need it up, you need it down. You don't hear us complaining about you leaving it down.

2. Whenever possible, please say whatever you have to say during commercials.

3. A headache that lasts for 17 months is a problem. See a doctor.

4. Sunday = sports. It's like the full moon or the changing of the tides. Let it be.

5. Shopping is not a sport. And No we're not going to think of it that way.

6. Crying is blackmail.

7. Ask for what you want. Let us be clear on this one: Subtle hints do not work! Strong hints do not work! Obvious hints do not work! Just say it!

8. Yes and No are perfectly acceptable answers to almost every question.

9. Come to us with a problem only if you want help solving it. That's what we do. Sympathy is what your girlfriends are for.

10. Anything we said 6 months ago is inadmissible in an argument. In fact, all comments become null and void after 7 days.

11. If you won't dress like the Victoria's Secret girls don't expect us to act like soap opera guys.

12. If something we said can be interpreted two ways, and one of the ways makes you sad or angry, we meant the other one.

13. You can either ask us to do something or tell us how you want it done. Not both. If you already know best how to do it, just do it yourself.

14. Christopher Columbus did not need directions and neither do we.

15. ALL men see in only 16 colors, like Windows default settings. Peach, for example, is a fruit, not a color. Pumpkin is also a fruit. We have no idea what mauve is.

16. If it itches, it will be scratched. We do that.

17. If we ask what is wrong and you say ""nothing,"" we will act like nothing's wrong. We know you are lying, but it's not worth the hassle.

18. If you ask a question you don't want an answer to, expect an answer you don't want to hear.

19. When we have to go somewhere, absolutely anything you wear is fine. Really.

20. Don't ask us what we're thinking - unless you are prepared to discuss such topics as baseball, sports, the shotgun formation, or monster trucks.

21. You have enough clothes.

22. You have too many shoes.

23. I am in shape. Round is a shape.

Thank you for reading this; Yes, I know, I have to sleep on the couch tonight, but did you know men really don't mind that, it's like camping.

Pass this to as many men as you can - to give them a laugh.

Pass this to as many women as you can - to give them an education!! 

That is all.........."

"event","Two women are walking home after a night out with the girls. They are very drunk and as the walk home was taking longer than expected, they find themselves desperate for a wee.

As they are passing a church with a graveyard, they decide to go and relieve themselves behind the headstones. As they finish, they both realise they have nothing to wipe themselves with.

The first woman decides to use her knickers and throw them away afterwards, which is what she does. The second is wearing expensive underwear and doesn't want to lose it, but notices a grave behind her that is very recent and still has flowers all over it. One of these is a very lavish bunch tied together with thick, expensive ribbon. 'Just the job' she decides, and reaches over, drags the flowers towards her, and uses the ribbon.

Their task completed, they continue staggering home.

Next morning, the husband of the first woman phones the husband of the second.

""We need  to keep an eye on our wives. Mine came home with no Knickers on last night!""

""You think you've got problems!"" exclaims the second husband.

""My wife came home with a card stuck up her arse that said 'We'll never forget you -from all the lads at the fire station'!"""

"event","Karen was only half thinking of how her hair looked as
she used her comb to meticulously sculpt her new haircut.
Her mind was on the Manager of the Year award she was about
to accept. As she re-applied her lipstick she ran through
her acceptance speech in her mind. Karen stepped back from
the mirror to admire her new navy blue suit. Stunning. She looked great, felt terrific, and marched out of the ladies room with an unmistakable glow. As she waited offstage she was more excited than nervous. In a few moments she would be honored in front of 2,000 employees. When she got her cue, she strode confidently across the huge stage toward the company president, trailing two feet of toilet paper from her left heel.

All of us have trouble seeing ourselves accurately. We often need an objective source to give us honest feedback. Karen sure could have used it!

How about you? How accurately do you see yourself in terms of the job market? Can you list your top five motivations? How about your key talents?

Research shows that we only see ourselves accurately about half of the time.  When it comes to what makes you tick, it takes an unbiased source that knows what to look for to give you an 
accurate picture of yourself."

"event","If your job could use a tune up, if you feel there's 
something amiss but you can't put your finger on it, 
or if you supervise someone who is struggling, use MAPP 
to help you identify the source of the problem. For example:

Bob had been with his new company for less than a year, 
and he was struggling.  Neither he nor his boss knew why.  
Bob had years of success as a software developer, and moving 
over to project manager was a natural next step for him.  
He liked his company and the people he worked with, and yet 
something wasn't right.  He just couldn't put his finger 
on it.

Then Bob took the MAPP assessment.  It confirmed that he 
was motivated to manage projects, that he enjoyed working 
with others, and that he was goal oriented.  So far, so 
good.  Then he read that he was highly motivated to work 
in steady familiar activities.  He needed routine and 
structure in order to work effectively.  He favored organized, 
methodical procedures.  That's when it all clicked.

Bob's new environment was filled with change.  It was a 
new company, and he was developing new software.  There 
were very few guideposts, and even less structure.  To him 
it felt like he was working in a blender.  All of his 
energy was being drained away trying to cope with it all.

He shared his findings with his boss; a gutsy move to be 
sure.  But Bob knew he couldn't go on, and wanted to 
find a solution that was good for him and the organization.  
And that's just what happened.  After some discussion, 
Bob's boss helped him make a lateral move that was a better 
fit for him, and provided a badly needed service for the 
company.  Now Bob leads a team that develops procedures 
that allows everyone to work more effectively.  He's doing 
what he does naturally well, and his company is becoming 
more productive as it adopts some structure.

MAPP isn't just for people contemplating a career change.  
It's also a great diagnostic tool. Especially in today's 
job market, you want to work with what you have and not 
start over."

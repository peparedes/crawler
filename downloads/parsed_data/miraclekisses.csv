This morning I was woken up by vacuuming. Ok, cleaning is great! Cleaning at 9am on a day I want to sleep in? Not so great. I can not control the people that live above me, but Marc has already gone to them once asking them nicely to be conscience that there is someone living below them. It sounds like they are walking around with cement feet! After the vacuuming, they decided to turn on some r&b nastiness. ""Baby please, baby please, baby please..."" I could hear the lyrics! I have often yelled out loud that they are being too loud, and I wonder if they can hear me. I doubt when I yelled ""Your music is too loud"" this morning that they could hear me, I doubt they could hear each other (and I could hear them yelling over the music as well). Are the walls really that thin? I can't hear the people downstairs on either side of (that I know of). I am always so glad when they leave the apartment because I don't hear them stomping around.

I saw the girlfriend/wife/woman thing that  lives upstairs with the guy. I had received a piece of her mail. I really hope I don't start to dislike her because her name is one that I have wanted to name my daughter (I am not having a child, it's just the name I have had picked out for one).

Other than that, the apartment is great!

I was watching America's Next Top Model, which is a guilty pleasure kinda show for me, but Marc is playing Gears of War right now, which I suspect he will do until right before he has to leave. I want to go out to the grocery store to see if I can find this ""Cherry Blossom"" flavored Lipton Tea water packet thingies (you know, the ones you add to you water to make it tasty)."

"event","Hey everyone! Hope your VDay went well, and I hope your Friday is even better! I am so glad it is Friday mostly because I am so sick of this place! Time tends to just stand still here. It is only 11:00 am. Bah!

I have to look for an apartment because Steve and Jenelle are moving out in May because she is pregnant now. Dave, here at work, knows one of the women who works at one of the apartment complex's I wanted to move into before, so she is gonna cut is a deal (maybe. I have to go there tomorrow to check it all out). I am mostly bogged down with that because well, finances scare me and this would be the first place I would actually be paying major rent bills. Right now my rent is very little. Very little. Ah well, I know God will see me through this.

I have been reading a lot. I went out and got Neil Gaiman's ""Coraline"" and I finished it in a day (granted it is not a big book) and I loved it! Now I am reading 3 books at once. ""The Third Policeman"", ""The Dark Tower Series"" and ""The Chronicles of Oz"". I was reading the Oz one first, but then went to DT, and now TTP because I joined a Lost Book Club, and that is the book we are doing. Too much reading!

Work is madness. Did I say we were going to be moving our space over to another office? Yeah. It has not happened yet. It's February and it was suppose to happen at the end of Decemeber. Well, knowing this office, how could you ever expect it to happen when it is suppose to?

I want to move back to Texas so bad. But now, I think I will really miss New Jersey and the convience of being close to Philly and NY even though I never go over there."

So, what has been going on with everyone? Good holidays? Fun stuff? Sun stuff? This winter has been a very very mild one in NJ. Very little snow. And by little I mean flurries for 30-45 minutes a couple days. Very unlike NJ.

Dave here at work got me a NEW Dunken Donuts White Hot Chocolate and it has offically burned my tongue/throat. But somehow, it stays delicious. This is by far the best thing that has come out of that horrible place.

Hmm, so I guess really I should just post some pics, cause I don't have any real exciting news right now.

I know I haven't updated in a while, so I will do this fast.

Marajean is coming up! Yeah! Tomorrow! And then on Friday, we are going to see Radiohead in concert. Woooo Hooo!! The concert sold out in seconds, even though I was ready to buy them as soon as I woke up (which was before they went on sale). So, I had to buy them on ebay, but I got them cheaper then everyone else on there because the seller was in PA, where the concert is and they can't sell them over a certain amount when you live and sell the tickets in the same state as the concert. SWEET!

It is so hot up here, and I hate it! It was feeling so nice last week. I hope it's not this hot for the rest of the week. Which reminds me to check the weather forcast for this week.

Anthony is a new guy here at work. He is nice....but there is just something about him I just don't really like. maybe it's that I wasn't invited to his ""birthday party"" when everyone else was. I wouldn't have gone to it anyway because he is way too Italian for me, and probably has connections to the mob or something."

Last nights episode opened up a lot of new things! First, there was the commerical during the break (1-877-HANSORG) which I did call and finally got through today, which was very cool, and very confusing. Ana Lucia did it with Sawyer in order to get the gun from him. Why Sawyer, Why???!! Then later on in the episode, Ana Lucia, who I hated in season one when I saw her at the airport was shot, as well as Libby. I don't think Libby is dead though. Michael shot himself and possibly let Creepy Henry go. I'll have to wait until next week though to see that.

<url>http://thehansofoundation.org</url> is back up again and more confusing than ever! So many links, so many hidden things, so many passwords! I love all the things that are linked to this show!

Also, <i>Bad Twin</i> the script that was found in the hatch is now available to buy. <url>http://www.bordersstores.com/features/feature.jsp?file=badtwin</url> An excerpt from the book on Borders.

"event","double update? Are you 4 seriousssss?

Yes.

But only because one of the most jaw dropping thing that has happened all day just...well...happened.

Constitution Title hired a receptionist. I have met said woman, and spoken to said woman, but I don't <i>know</i> said woman. But, everday she seems to get louder, and..what's the word I am looking for...oh, LOUDER everyday. She's copying something...""KELLY, DO YOU WANT THESE CERTIFIED COPIED??"" or ""YOU HAVE A CALL ON LINE 3. IT'S A MAN FROM SOME COMPANY"" What's that? I couldn't hear you through the walls and doors omg you could use the Intercom system that is in the phone right next to you for that specific purpose. And it happens everyday, multiple times. Now, since I am off in my own kinda windowish office because the walls that were being put up are now, indeed, put up, I can't <i>see</i> her do this, but who needs to see when you can hear miles and miles away that Lisa has some papwerwork on the fax machine. But no one tells her not to do this. No one tells her, and I don't know why. But today, just moments ago, I hear:

""BrrbbBrbbbrrBBbbrrbbbrrrbbbbbrrrrBBbbrrrrrr""

What is that you ask? Why, it's her finger and lip making the loudest noise ever. I could hear it over the copy machine, over the loud trucks driving by on the noisy street outside my window and I hear it over Tom swearing to the high heavens about his printer. And I stop. And drop my jaw. Because things like that during work make me want to update my journal."

Am feeling tired, achey and bloated. I kinda feel ""hgot flashish"" but not really. I want to go home really really bad, but not to watch ""24"" which Marc really wants to watch. I can not stand the wife on Season 1 (because we are so far behind the times and didn't start watching it until Marc's dad kept asking ""Have you seen it, have you seen it? It's soooo good"") So, if you know who I am talking about, she has got to be one of the most annoying characters I have ever been forced to watch on a show. ""Where's Jack?! I need to talk to him?? What? You need me to help you carry this man that has just been shot into this van? But what about MEEEE??? And where is my daughter? She's dead!!! I saw the car blow up!!! What? She's ok? Where is she? Can I talk to her? Waaaaahhhhh!!! I'm pregnant, but I am going to be whiny and annoying and I'm not going to tell Jack."" There have been so many missed oppurtunities to kill her, and every single one has disappointed me.

Ok, enough rant about why ""24"" is not <i>the best show on television</i> *cough* LOSTis *cough*

2 new guys are going to be working here. Anthony and David. No comment as of yet on them. However, I should be working on appointing them with our other companies, but instead I would rather read things online. And wish I was home. And not watch 24. Instead I am here and Tom is really getting on my last nerve, but then again, isn't he always?"

"event","So, here is an update! Yay, everyone clap your hands!
This weekend was pretty good. On Saturday, Marc and I went and saw the movie ""Stay Alive"". It was pretty decent for a ""horror"" movie. There were 2 teenage girls that did nothing but scream really loud and kick the seats. I can't really remember anything more than that. I guess that's because Sunday really sucked. I am sure everyone can understand that when something happens that absolutely ruins your day, you kinda go blank on things that happened the day before, right? Like if you are driving and your car dies or even worse, you get into a car accident. Well, that's what it was like.

Sunday I woke up around 10. Marc came in, kissed me, got me up and dressed so we could go see ""Benchwarmers"" (it was a movie weekend!)So, we went there, and he pulled up so I could check the times. I came back to the car and told him and he said ""Go in and get in line, I'll park the car"" Well, I went in, and there were only 2 people in line. Marc has a card that gets rewards whenever you buy tickets, so once it got to 1 person, I looked out to see where he was. He was walking up, but really slowly. I go to duck underneath the ropes that wind around to form a line, and as I do that, my right knee slips out of socket. Have no fear though, it wasn't a ""total dislocation"", it slipped back in place. <lj-cut text=""Here is a background on my horrible knees""> Both of my knees have dislocated twice. The first time: I was in Jr. High and I was ""skipping"" to the vending machine and my right knee dislocated. By this I mean that my knee cap slid out of place and to the side of my leg. I couldn't straighten my leg, and there is a ""dip"" where my knee cap should be. It stayed out pretty long mostly due to the fact I was FREAKING OUT. After getting x-rays and all that other stuff, I started to relax, and when they were trying to get me down from the stretcher and into the car, my dad grabbed my leg and did something and it popped back into place. My thoughts? ""That felt good"" The second time: I was in the swimming pool and I jumped up in the air to pass a balloon we were playing with to someone. As I jumped out of the water, my right knee went out and I sunk to the bottom. Paul, my stepdad, pulled me out of the water and popped it back in with his hand. From that time foward, I would always want Paul to take care of my knee if it went out. I can remember that when this happened, we didn't tell my dad about it. The Third time: I was in my bed room and I was getting out of bed. I lived with my dad (ha, when he was at home) and my grandparents. I stepped out on my left leg and turned and my knee dislocated (ok, just thinking about this is making my knee hurt and making me feel a little sick) I yelled for my grandmother (nana) to come and she finally did. I remember wanting Paul to come to push it in, but obbles (short of obviously) he couldn't, so she called 911. The ambulance came, had to cut my pants and gave me ""the gas"". As I was breathing it in, I started to relax, and my knee started to go down. The EMT pulled a little on my leg, and it slid into place. After that, I knew the key was to stay relaxed! The Fourth time: (aka - ""the last time"") I was in High School Dance class. I think I was either a sophmore or a junior. At the beginning of class, we always had to ""jog around"" the area 3 times. I was with my friends and I said ""Come guys, it's time to run!"" As I took a couple of steps, I felt my left knee dislocate. I was was calm as I told one of the girls ""Go tell Ms. Royal that my knee dislocated"" I guess it was my calm dimeanor that made them not understand what I was saying, so I said it again and pointed to my knee. Of course, they were freaked. I think the Vice Principal or a Coach came and got me into a wheel chair. I knew I needed to relax, but the stupid nurse wrapped my knee really tight in a wrap. Way to go nurse. Since then, it has occasionaly ""slipped out & in"" but not ever as bad as staying out.</lj-cut> But it was worse than just slipping out. I could feel my knee dislocate and then slip in, but at a slower pace. I was on the ground, the ticket person not noticing me. I looked out, and Marc was still walking slow. I pushed open the door (I had fallen a couple inches or more away from it) and I called out to him ""MMMAARRCC!!"" He saw me and started running really fast to me. After telling him that I just wanted some ice and to watch the movie (it would give me a good 2 hours to rest and keep my leg elevated) he helped me up and we went to see the movie. 

On Monday I stayed home and on Tuesday I went to the doctor. I have an appointment to see an orthopedic specialist in May. (Dr. Gray)I am at work, with a ice pack on my knee and no shoes on. Even though Tom and Keith both know about my gimping and hobbiling, they still ask me to get files and papers that they could easily get. Another thing I will be asking the Orthopedic Specialist about is that since moving to New Jersey my knees have started creaking when I bend, which is bad, and the last time my knee went out, the specialist doctor said if it happens again, I would probles (short for probably) need surgery. I am really afraid of that.

In other non-knee dislocaring news, Anthony, who has a huge ego and is very Italian hasn't really started, but will be soon. And now they are looking into hiring a new guy. I don't know how I will like that."

"event","So, COLDPLAY WAS AWESOME!!

Although our seats were higher up than I would have liked, we were right across from the stage. The lighting and everything was excellent. I was not able to bring in a camera (it says it on the ticket) and although I know I could sneak one in, marc didn't want to have to risk getting caught and then having to walk back to the car to take it back. I did try to record some sort of video on my phone, which some did actually look ok, I can tell what song is playing, but it's not clear. Nice things about it was that the tv screen behind Coldplay was so huge, I had no problem seeing the band on it. During ""Talk"" Chris had a cellphone and was singing into it. I <i>think</i> it was an audience members. If so, very cool. Chris said that he was sick and was in NY that morning, and almost thought they couldn't play, but that a doctor in Philly made it possible (the show was in Philly) before playing ""God Put a smile on your face"". He changed the first few lines to talk about the doctor making him better to sing. He did say that this was their last concert in the US for a long while. But, but BUT he did say ""We'll be back and we'll be better than ever!"" So there is hope. (I had heard rumors of this being their last concert ever - but they are not breaking up) The bad thing was, the guys sitting next to Marc were smoking the worst smelling ciggs ever, and that's not even allowed. They were so drunk and were flirting with the girls in the seats behind us. At one point in the show, one of the guys passed out and slept through the rest of the concert. Jon Ashford (formally from The Verves) was the opener. Honestly, not really that good. He kept saying in between songs how he hates advertising, and how he doesn't like certain things. I don't have a problem with that per se, but I couldn't understand him mostly because of his accent. While he was talking down at the stage, someone told him to ""shut the f*** up"" So he said ""Don't tell me to Shut the f*** up. If you're such a man, come up here on stage and tell me to shut the f*** up!....here's a song you all should know. Bitter Sweet Symphony!"" 

So, the concert was great, Marc loved it, and we had a great time. On a side note that is kinda concert related, kinda not. In regards to certain people that work with him - I think they are all dicks. They might be nice to your face, when they ""see that you are there"", but I see through that. There are many times that I have been in the resteraunt, and sat there for more than a few minutes, maybe at the bar with Marc bartending, and then only after someone says something to one of them do they say ""Oh, hi! I didn't see you!"" How do you not see someone bartending at a place you work at? I just think it's fishy. And I am not mad that they don't see me sitting there. It's just they are the type of person that would get mad at <i>you</i> for not seeing them there. A few other instances that just make me mad about them is that they are always going off in a little group without including Marc. Maybe they do this because 1. he might say no that he doesn't want to go 2. they don't want me to go with him or 3. they are just dicks. Sometime after Christmas, Marc and I mentioned that we were going to go to this concert. One of the guys said he wanted to get tickets for one of the girls as a birthday present, but he couldn't find any tickets. We said we would get her a shirt from there. Well, turns out yesterday, they got tickets but ""forgot that we were going"". They didn't forget to mention that they asked other people if they wanted to come though. Which means at that time of her asking people if they wanted to go, she did not know we were going, yet didn't ask us. Marc and I did meet up with said person in question before the concert (while we were in the parking lot) and I may have been snubby, but who can blame me? If they did it once, ok, but this is multiple times. Aggrr! Rage!"

Today is payday and that is glorious. Tom is being annoying - as usual. I swear, that man does not listen. Or if he does, he does not retain information very well, and I am, quite frankly, tired of being his ""rememberall"". Why should it be my job to remember what someone paid on a policy and not his? Grrr!

Marc and I got new phones. RAZOR phones. And, in suit of all things I must have, I got the pink one. And I love it. Loves it, loves it, loves it. He got the black one.

Last weeks Lost episode was so good. I loved how they left us hanging at the end with the Henry ""Other"" Gale. And then last nights episode was so good as well! I got Marajean hooked, which I am glad she liked it and was able to watch the season 1 since I sent it to her on dvd. I am anxious to see the rest, and I will be sad when the season finale comes up, but I will be jumping with excitement when the next season starts. Oh Lost, how I love you.

I have a lot of crocheting to do. Blah.

I think I am slowly but surely becoming addicted to Sudoku. I go to www.websudoku.com for free games of it!

That's really what is keeping me from doing what I want to do because that is when I normally get my computer time. Other than, I have been busy with everyday life things. Nothing too extreme, but when I have a busy day, I rarely feel like doing anything when I get home, which I assume everyone can relate to. 

I have been doing a small bit of reading, I <i>tried</i> to teach a girl I know how to crochet, but I think she is a little...slower in the ""learn to be crafty"" area. She seems smart otherwise, she just wouldn't hold her hands like I told her to! I have been crocheting a little myself, but it just seems like I just don't have the <i>erge</i> to, you know? I have to make a hat and scarf as well as a ""fun"" hat for <lj user=""ennervation""> and I am a complete slacker on it! I am so sorry. I was suppost to go see ""The Colbert Report"" in New York, but I dropped the ball there, too. I am so sorry. Other than that, mostly is getting my room dirty and not cleaning it all the way, which is getting on my nerves, so I may do a ""real"" clean next week.

Suprisingly my hair is being better than it normally is. I thank Marajean and her christmas blow dryer for it.

Last night I did make what I like to call ""banana fudgesicle fudge"" It tastes like a...can you guess...BANANA FUDGESICLE! (aka - chocolate covered banana) everyone loves it and everyone wants to know the recipe which is SO EASY IT'S NOT EVEN FUNNY. I made it for Marc's boss James who is having surgery (on his finger).

I am so excited about seeing Coldplay in April. Which reminds me to check a playlist of what they will be playing.

Marajean may be coming up in August for her birthday!

According to Kelly at work, I am ""bouncing off the wall"" today. I would like to say I am ""playing the light fantastic"". Yes. Exactly."

I was reading someone journal, and there was this <a href=""http://prillalar.com/drabbles/"">Drabble Matic</a>


Here's one I did. I think I have found the best thing to do during work! 

<u>Hun Lang Syne</u>

Marc sipped tremendously at his drink and stood hun behind a hun. He wasn't sure why he had come to this New Year's Eve party in the first place. He was no good at parties anyhow. They always made him feel frozen and he ended up like he was now, hiding and hoping nobody noticed how tasty his toe got when he was nervous.

Well, truth be told, Marc knew very well why he was at the party: to see Amanda.

Ah, Amanda. Just the thought of her, the chance of a glimpse of her smooth ear made Marc's heart beat like a hun that is the best!.

But tonight everyone was masked. Marc peered stupidly through the crowd, trying to guess which guest was Amanda. There, he thought, the woman over by the rainbow, the sweet one with the elephant mask. It had to be Amanda. No one else could look so cloudy, even in an elephant mask.

She began to walk Marc's way and Marc started to panic. What if she actually talked to Marc?

Amanda came right up to Marc and Marc thought that he was going to faint.

""Hello,"" Amanda said lovingly. ""What are you doing over here all alone?""

""Oh, just looking at the candle,"" Marc said and immediately wanted to die because that sounded so rough.

Just then, a lovable voice began to count down. ""Ten ... nine ... eight ... seven ...""

Marc's heart leapt. If they were together at midnight, that meant that Amanda might ...

""Happy New Year!""

Amanda swept Marc into her arms, bent him in a room, and kissed Marc carelessly, slipping him the tongue and groping his nose.

Marc could hardly believe it. How wonderful! And now that it was after midnight, it was time to take their masks off. He reached out huningly and pulled Amanda's mask off her face. It was Amanda! ""I knew it was you,"" Marc said and took his own mask off.

""And it's ... you,"" Amanda said. ""You know, I'm just going to go get some punch.""

Marc watched her go. She would be right back, Marc was sure. Just as soon as she had her punch.

And then they would fall in love."

Yesterday, <lj user=""ennervation""> offered me 2 tickets to go see ""The Colbert Report"" which, after finding out exactly what it is, I was happy to take! But I couldn't just take them! So, I am making him a hat & scarf set, a ""fun hat"" (which is a suprise),a couple of other suprise items, and a Coldplay t-shirt when I go see them in concert. Even though he doesn't have to, he said he wanted to send me some things too! I am so excited! ^___________^

In less exciting/more embarassing news, this morning, as I was walking to my car to go to work, I slipped on a patch of ice and fell down on the driveway. My butt/lower back and hand (that braced my fall) hurt. As embarassed as I am, I am more thankful that nothing happened to my knees. I get this warm/tingly feeling wash over me whenever I think ""My knee could have dislocated."" Marc was thankful too. And then, I was telling him ""I hope my coccix isn't broken"" I can't believe I even remembered the name, let alone that it is at the tail end of your spine that curves into you butt area and that if you break it, you can't where a brace or cast, you just have to let it heal. I was amazed. MY MIND IS EXTRODINARY!!! I learned that my senior year of high school and never had something like that just come to me. 

Well, I have a lot of crocheting to do, and I can't wait to start on it when I get home. Marc had ordered me all of the seasons of Sailor Moon on DVD, and some of them came in, so I will be watching those!"

"event","This weekend was not long enough! On Friday, I got my long awaited for, ""Yarn ball winder"" which is very nifty, and time consuming. I wound up a lot of yarn, but got mad when the yarn started to tangle (not from the winder - because the yarn was a mess!)

Marc and I cleaned my room a little bit. There was a chair that had been in there since I moved in, that kinda just turned into the ""pile chair"". Need to put something somewhere? Throw it on the chair! It was a mess! So, we cleaned out that area, bought a small bookcase, moved some stuff around, and now it is much neater. We also bought 2 19 gallon tubs for my yarn....and I still have yarn lying around. Oy! And I don't have anywhere in my room at this time to put them. Some of the clutter that was on the chair, is now piled on the opposite side of my room waiting to be cleaned. We need to get rid of a stereo, a computer and some other things, then there will be much more room. That won't be happening though until later this week. We did all that Saturday, and it took up the entire day, it seemed. 

Sunday, I went and got a pedicure, which was nice, and then we ate some chicken, and laid around the house, which was also nice. I have finally gotten back in the crochet mood, which makes me happy. The only thing is, I don't want to do the scarf I have to finish, and the project I <i>am</i> doing, I need new yarn, not any of the yarn I have right now! Oy x2! What am I going to do with myself?? I have an idea for something else I want to do, but for that, I need NEW YARN! No more yarn, I can't do it!

Sunday, we also watched a lot of Lois and Clark. We had already watched a lot of it earlier that week, but we were on the last 2 discs this week. At the end of the last episode, it brings you to the ""special features"". One of them was titled ""Fans of Lois & Clark"" We watched it. It seems the ""F.O.L.C."" (FRIENDS of Lois & Clark) is a group still together now, and consists of....10 members.  8 of them old women, 2 younger women and 1 man. Marc and I laughed the entire time. It was great. I said ""This group of people are like the huge Buffy/Angel fan base. You know, the people who wish everyday that Joss Whedon would bring Buffy/Angel back on the air (new episodes). Except there are only like 10 people in this fan club, and they devote al their time to Lois & Clark"""

<lj-cut text=""WARNING...New Credit Card Scam.""> 
Note, the callers do NOT ask for your card number -- they already have it. 
This information is worth reading. By understanding how the VISA & 
Master Card Telephone Credit Card Scam works, you'll be better prepared to protect yourself. 
One of our employees was called on Wednesday from ""VISA"", and I was called on Thursday from ""Master Card"". 
The scam works like this: Person calling says, ""This is (name), and I'm calling from the Security and Fraud Department at VISA. My Badge 
number is 12460 Your card has been flagged for an unusual purchase pattern, and I'm calling to verify. This would be on your VISA card which was 
issued by (name of bank). Did you purchase an Anti-Telemarketing Device for $497.99 from a Marketing company based in Arizona?"" 

When you say ""No"", the caller continues with, ""Then we will be issuing a credit to your account. This is a company we have been watching and the charges range from $297 to $497, just under the $500 purchase pattern that flags most cards. Before your next statement, the credit will be sent to (gives you your address), is that correct?"" 

You say ""yes"". The caller continues - ""I will be starting a Fraud investigation. If you have any questions, you should call the 1- 800 number listed on the back of your card (1-800-VISA) and ask for Security. 

You will need to refer to this Control Number. The caller then gives you a 6 digit number. ""Do you need me to read it again?"" 

Here's the IMPORTANT part on how the scam works. The caller then says, ""I need to verify you are in possession of your card"". He'll ask you to ""turn your card over and look for some numbers"". There are 7 numbers; the first 4 are part of your card number, the next 3 are the security Numbers' that verify you are the possessor of the card. 

These are the numbers you sometimes use to make Internet purchases to prove you have the card. The caller will ask you to read the 3 numbers to him. 

After you tell the caller the 3 numbers, he'll say, ""That is correct, I just needed to verify that the card has not been lost or stolen, and that you still have your card. Do you have any other questions?"" After you say No, the caller then thanks you and states, ""Don't hesitate to call back if you do"", and hangs up. 

You actually say very little, and they never ask for or tell you the Card number. But after we were called on Wednesday, we called back within 20 minutes to ask a question. Are we glad we did! 

The REAL VISA Security Department told us it was a scam and in the last 15 minutes a new purchase of $497.99 was charged to our card. 

Long story made short - we made a real fraud report and closed the VISA account. VISA is reissuing us a new number. What the scammers want is the 3-digit PIN number on the back of the card. 

Don't give it to them. Instead, tell them you'll call VISA or Master card directly for verification of their conversation. The real VISA 
told us that they will never ask for anything on the card as they already know the information since they issued the card! If you give the 
scammers your 3 Digit PIN Number, you think you're receiving a credit. However, by the time you get your statement you'll see charges for 
purchases you didn't make, and by then it's almost to late and/or more difficult to actually file a fraud report. 

What makes this more remarkable is that on Thursday, I got a call from a ""Jason Richardson of Master Card"" with a word-for-word repeat of the VISA scam. This time I didn't let him finish. I hung up! We filed a police report, as instructed by VISA. The police said they are taking several of these reports daily! They also urged us to tell everybody we know that this scam is happening. 

Please pass this on to all your family and friends. By informing each other, we protect each other!</lj-cut>"

On my way to work this morning, I was on I-295, in the passing lane(now known as the 1st lane). I signaled that I was moving over into the right lane (2nd lane). At that time, another car, in the 4th lane was signaling to go left into the 2nd lane. Without signaling, or even looking over, that car started moving into my lane, and into me! Thankfully for me, I was watching that filthy driver, and moved over and honked. After moving back into the lane after the monster passed, the old man that was behind me in the 1st lane sped up to catch up to her, rolled down his window and started yelling at her. All she did was wave her arms around. When I passed her, I gave her the ring finger. Stupid girl!"

Nothing too exciting has happened. I've been sniffing a lot - and suggested by my Dr. Marajean, I have been drinking Emer-gen'c.
<img src=""http://pics.drugstore.com/prodimg/78611/200.jpg""> 
I need the vitamin C. It says it's fizzy, which it is, after you mix it. It's not very sweet, and has a slight ""vitamin"" taste. I've been adding the packets to bottles of water, which seem to be working fine, but after I'm done, the vitamin smell is almost over powering. But, yay for vitamins!

I have been on a huge Cardigans kick. Not the sweaters, the band. I believe it was in October, I stumbled upon one of their Cd's that I didn't have. I didn't hear of them coming out with a new cd, but then again, I'm not really keeping up with the music buzz. I bought it, and loved it so much (and I still love it). After further inspection - this cd that was very very new to me actually came out in 2003! After a little more of what I like to call ""during work inspection"" (which is when I look on the internet while I am at work) I discovered that they had another NEW cd (yes, actually new) that had just came out. Sadly, it was in the UK and Japan. I searched nearby stores to see if they had it - but they didn't. Just last week, I orded some on ebay. YAY! I needed my Cardigan's fix! But then, just this Saturday, when Marc and I were on our way t see Memoirs of a Geisha after eating a scrumtrulesant lunch at The Olive Garden, we stopped by Tower Records, a store I don't normally go to because it's kinda far. There - in the Cardigans section - were 3 copies of the cd I just ordered on ebay! While one that looked like a normal cd ($17.99) the other two had a dvd and extra songs. Oddly, they were prices $20 something and $30. Hmm..and I paid $6.00 for mine (and yes, it's the one with the dvd.) 

After Tower Records, we went to the movie theater. We were there kinda early, so I suggested that we go to the mall and just walk around. We left and right as we pulled into the parking lot, there was a weird noise. A ""thumppp a thumppp a thumpp a"". ""Do we have a flat??"" I asked Marc. We pulled over, and checked the tire. We had ran over some large nut and bolt thing. It was so deep into the tire. Thankfully, there was a Pep Boys across the street. We were hesitant because of our prior meeings with the Pep Boys (3 floating heads is a little creepy, don't you agree?)They weren't really busy, and they fixed the tire for free! (while we played Nintendogs).

We did see the Memoirs of a Geisha movie - which I did like. They changed things that I didn't really think needed to be changed. And I firmly believe that if I didn't read the book, I wouldn't have understood a lot of it. Marc liked it, up to a certain point - which I told him never happened in the book (no spoilers here!)

I would update more, but I really need to get to work! Everyone have a good day!"

Mine was wonderful. I got a lot of things I wanted (which I will list later - maybe next week)

Tom brought his son into work today. This kid loves to eat. Back anf forth, back and forth from this room to the kitchen. He's been kinda quiet except for when he wants to know where Tom is going (yes, even when he needs to go to the restroom).

30 more minutes before I get to leave. Maybe even sooner! I hope. I hope.

I am very excited about giving the people at Marc's work thier gifts. I love giving gifts!!!

"event","So, for Christmas, even though I don't get paid a lot, and I have to deal with Marc thinking I spend too much money - I bought everyone (kinda) in the office a Christmas gift of sorts (like I mentioned in the post below) I bought Santa and Snowmen mugs, filled them with candy, and added a candycane. (for the girls, I added a pen with a christmas-y furry top) The girls all said thank you, and Keith and Tom did. Jeff and Mark did not. Even though I saw Jeff and talked to him, nothing. Whatever JEFFREY! YOU LIVE ALONE AND PROBABLY HAVE MILLIONS OF CATS. Anyway - I come in this morning, and Keith says ""Wanna see what I got the girls downstairs"" Ok. He shows me. For Barbara and Clare (the woman who ALWAYS parks in the handicap parking space) it's a long thing (imagine the boxes that normally have long stem red roses in it) filled with chocolates and chocolate covered things. For Judith, Barb, and Naz, a smaller box (think corsage (spelling?)) with the same stuff, just less of it. Ok, that's very nice of you Keith. WHERE IS MY GIFT?! I work with you! I got you something, even though it was small. But I remembered you celebrate Hannakah, so I gave you a snowman instead of Santa. I remembered you don't like chocolates, so I bought a bag of non-choclote candy, just for you! (well, I used it in all of them, but whatever). And I don't think they got you anything! It's ok for me to be jealous, just a little, right? I am human, and a girl. I wouldn't have minded if he just didn't get anyone anything. *le sigh* I am probably doing this, and then he shows up tomorrow with something for me. Hopefully? I wouldn't mind being wrong about this, lol."

Tom and Keith are in a meeting. Tom's chair is fixed (as of right now *crosses fingers*) and if I am lucky, they will be in the meeting until after I leave.

For the people who know tons about computers and such, I have a question - I remember at one time there was a way to bi-pass the whole ""you're not allowed to right click"" things. Either by pushing ctrl or shift before or after clicking. It's driving me nuts. I used to know all the html codes, and things, but now, I have completely lost all knowledge. Please! If anyone remembers, can you tell me? 

Marc and I only need to get 2 more Chrismtas gifts. Both for girls he works with and that I don't really know. Any suggestions? Price range is around $10.

I gave out cups (santa and snowmen) filled with candy out for work. I gave some to the people at constitution title, and Mark and Jeff never said thanks for theirs. Hurrmphh! It's not like they don't know where I am. Oh well, I bet when I <i>do</i> see them because I walked where they were, they might say something. 

On my desk, there are 2 flowers(plants). A violet, which I have had since I was at the office, and always blooms. And when it <i>doesn't</i> because I didn't water it or something, it always fixes once I do. The other plant I got at the stockholder meeting last month. It was doing great until I came back after my small vacation when Marajean came up - it was all dried up! I tried giving it more water but it's not improving. I guess it just isn't one of those plants that can be fixed easily.

I still want a really cool layout. And I am still without the skills or time, lol."

Tom was bugging the crap out of me. He has this thing where he will sit in his SQUEAKY chair (I should say ""SCREECHING"" because that's more like the sound) and turn towards me, look through his window and say something to me. 1. My hearing is not very/as good, and I can't always hear him. 2. I would try lip reading, but the glare from the window behind me bouncing off his window covers him face. I am always poliet in asking him what he said by either saying ""I'm sorry? I didn't hear what you said"" or ""I'll be right there Tom, I couldn't hear you"". What does he do when he YELLS something for me to hear, and then I YELL back to answer him, but he doesn't hear me? He turns his head slightly and cups around his ear with his hand. He has done it so much that it makes me cringe when I see him do it now. Not only that, but him SCREECHING all the time. 2 weeks ago, I called the chair place to get them to come up and fix it. But they went to the wrong company (one of our sister companies). Tom called them to get them to come back and repair the RIGHT chair. Did they show up? No. I had to call 3 times, and finally, the woman said the person that comes to fix the chairs is sick. I asked her to call when he gets in. No call yet. JUST SCREECHING. so, today, during a screech, Tom YELLS ""CALL THAT PLACE AND HAVE THEM FIX MY CHAIR"" and I yelled ""YOU HAVE THE FILE"". Maybe he will call - I doubt it. So, I will be calling tomorrow. Please, please, PLEASE, I hope someone will come.

Marc and I still need to do some Christmas shopping. Not too much. I have a buttload of things I need to crochet, but being sick makes me just want to lie around and do nothing.

What is everyone doing for New Years? I know it isn't even Christmas yet, but last year, I had a great New Years. Some friends came over, I drank more than I normally would, and we played Mario Party 6. I HAD A BLAST. (ok, and Marc and I had our own time). I want to do that again. It was safe and fun. But this year, it seems like almost everyone has changed. One of the friends we had over is all about smoking now and is hanging out with bad kids, and I don't want him over. And his EX Girlfriend is a PSYCHO and even though we are not good friends with her, everytime we see her 9at the grocery store she works at) she is asking us to hang out. And she wants to hang out with us on New Years. Please, no. (I wrote about her before - her name is Sara(h). And I am sure Marc's friends from work will try to convince him to ""hang out"" with them = smoke everywhere and people getting drunk and possibly drugs. Yes, I know about drinking and New Years is all about it, but EVERYTIME they ""hang out"" it's always drinking. And I feel like sometimes I can't be myself around them. I want to have the small group of friends having fun."

My throat was killing me this morning. It could have been because I was up reading to Marajean (Harry Potter **side note, I just typed ""pooter"" instead of Potter - hahahah** HBP) and I kept coughing so bad and needing to spit. I went to sleep later than I wanted to, and then woke up not wanting to get up at all. I took medicine, and brought Throat Drops. It did not help. I took a Hall's cough drop (strawberry flavor) and drank a cup of throat coat. Once, done, I felt like I needed another cup, so I got up to do that. On my way to the kitchen, <lj-cut text=""kinda sick stuff under cut"">without coughing or doing that noise thing that makes people want to throw up - I felt stuff coming out of my throat and into my mouth. I rushed to the kitchen, ready to spit whatever it was in my mouth out. But as I walked in, there was Mark and some other guy I had never met. I kept my moouth shut, but the gook was still in my mouth. The guy I didn't know said ""Hello"". I nodded to him and made a noise that could be taken as a greeting. Mark said ""Hey, it's Amanda!"" like he always does, and I nodded and hummed a ""hi"". The other guy then said ""Hello Amanda"". I had no choice but to swallow whatever it was, shake his hand and say ""I'm sorry, my throat hurts."" while still feeling and tasting the metalicness of whatever it was. Mark then says ""From all that late night partying, huh?"" Yeah. I grabbed a napkins and wiped my mouth. Why was there red on there?? I spit into the sink. It was RED. WHY?? I started to semi-panic. I made me Throat Coat tea and then ran into the bathroom. I spit until it was clear again. I was either bleeding from inside, or it was the strawberry cough drop. But it wasn't pink like the cough drop. UGHGHGH </lj-cut>

"event","Since I am at work, and can't do much other than work,this is just a quick summary of the Marajean visit!

So, Marajean came up! It was great. It snowed on Thursday night, so that was great - it snowed just for her! We went to Macaroni Grill, had yummy pasta. And then I drove us to Pennsylvania. I did not get lost! We saw Chronicles of Narnia in the United Artist building, that was very tall. Then, we escaped the $10 parking fee by coming early. We saw Fiona Apple and it was the best concert ever! We had made glittery shirts and everyone loved them. Afterwards, she had autographed cds for sale for $20. We both got one. Then, I drove us back, but I got lost. But only for a little while. Marajean kept me sane, because I would have normally gotten so freaked out. I did start to cry a little, and then we found the way! On Saturday, we went to New York. It was so cold, but we were bundled up. We walked down from Penn Station (Madison square Garden) and walked up to Times Square. We bought some $5 Pashmina's and she bought a $5 watch for her brother that looked really cool. We went to Rockefeller Center and saw the huge Christmas Tree, and ate some pizza. We stopped by the Nintendo World store mostly for Marc(and me). It was so cool! Then we went to the NBC expirience store, and did a video thing with Conan O'brien. We bought the tape. I need to make a copy onto a dvd for Marajean. Then, as we were walking back down to Madison Square Garden, we saw WESLEY SNIPES!! They were filming a movie. Maybe we will be in the backgroound! On Sunday, we went to the movies to see Harry Potter GoF since she hadn't seen it yet. The rest of the day, we hung out and watched Sex in the City. She is addicted to that show now. Monday was my birthday! Thank you <lj user=""kimothy""> for your card, and the entry in your journal! and thanks <lj user=""paranee""> for the shout out in your journal as well! Marc gave me tons of great gifts, including Animal Crossing for DS, Karoke Revolution Party for PS2, some movies, comics, and some other things I wanted. It was great!!!

We went out and got one of Marc's presents last night. Because I had lost my card and gotten a new one that morning, it declined my card when I went to buy it. How embarrassing. We did get it though.

Last night we did a test drive. I was so frustrated. I was scared of driving there. Marc, thw wonderful man, agreed to drive as I wrote side notes on the mapquest directions. We did get lost, however, I don't blame mapquest for knowing that they are working on a very busy road and we had to take detours. I was so upset because I am so bad at directions. But, my very nice directions make me very sure we will get there fine.

We need to buy marajean some sweaters when she gets up here, because she doesn't stock up on winter gear in Texas.

She will be getting in tomorrow, and I am taking a half day so Marc and I can pick her up from the airport. Then, tomorrow night, the forecast is that is snows into Friday. She will get to see snow! That is, if the news isn't lying. And by news I also mean www.weather.com because that's what they said! Then, on Friday, we are going to eat food at Macaroni Grill, then see The Chronicles of Narnia in the morning. Then, we (and by we, I mean, me) will drive to Upper Darby, PA to see Fiona Apple. I should mention I have no clue how to get there other than mapquest directions. I have never driven outside of the state of NJ. I leave all that up to Marc. So, I am quite scared of how it will turn out. Maybe Marc and I can drive up there Thursday night. That's what I want to happen.

Other news, my legs are so tired from DDR:MM. My pants feel a little baggier, but I don't know whether to credit it to DDR or that I haven't washed these pants yet for a week and they are just ""lived in"". What I do know is that I dropped something and when I bent to pick it up I had scary pains and groans because it was sore. (mostly scary because of my knees). And the bone that is on the inside of my foot that is by my big toe hurts. I pop my big toe, and the pain goes away for a little while. I blame it on my shoes.

""Dumb Amanda"" strikes again by losing HER OWN DEBIT CARD. Yes. It was just like losing my work one, only I didn't disappoint anyone but myself. I canceled it and got a new one this morning, along with a ""brochure"" in case I want a job with the bank (given to me by the woman who gave me my new card. Apparently, I seem very ""mature"". Did she not remember I was there because I <i>lost</i> my card?) I was upset though, because when I found out I lost it, Marc and I were out and I was buying one of his Christmas gifts. So, now I have to go back out tonight to get it. Marc is such a sweetheart though. Because I was upset, he decided I needed ANOTHER early birthday gift (one he deems as ""one of the little gifts""). This time, it was ""The Rocket!"" a really nice shower radio. I had been wanting one since, well, last Christmas. Very sweet of him."

Tom and Keith are yelling at each other and slaming doors and I feel like the kid and the parents are yelling. *sigh* I hate that. 

3 more days until Marajean is here! Heeyah!

So, this weekend was good. On Saturday, Marc and I were suppost to go to a tournament for him, but he came over late, and I was still asleep, so we didn't go. We did get in a slight argument, because I was frustrated that my room was messy and that I wanted to play DDR, but the PS2 wouldn't read the PS1 disc, so that meant we would have to plug up the PS1, and I was just so frustrated. I got even more frustrated that all the dvd's that I had stacked in the corner kept falling and I was throwing them around in total fury. So, Marc, in his sweet ways, offered to go out and get a dvd holder thing, and we could clean up my room, and all would be well. As I was getting in his car, he got in, and had a suprise for me! 

<img src=""http://www.digitalgames.fr/wp-content/images/castingddr1.jpg"">

It's an early birthday present. You can guess what I spent all weekend playing. Marc also mentioned it was already discontinued! I am so lucky to have such a wonderful love in my life! You're my everything, Marc!

P.S. My legs are so sore!

"event","Before Thanksgiving, the elevator that we use in the building was freaking me out. As it would come to the 3rd floor, the doors would open before the elevator reached the actual floor (not by much, but enough to freak me out) and it would GROAN to get all the way up. Of course, I mention it to a few people around the office, and they all say ""Oh, I haven't noticed anything"" or ""Well, that's why I always have a cell phone with me"" What a dumb answer! I'm not afraid of getting stuck in there, lady. I'm afraid of the support cables snapping and me falling to a horrible elevator trap death! What is a cell phone going to do?! It won't help unless you are talking on it as you are falling down. and even then, it won't help you. Unless you have a special one that transports you through space and time and you aren't harmed. Well, it's fixed now, and I am much less scared. 

Our building is built weird. It's like we park under the building which is the ""ground floor"" also known as FIRST FLOOR. The ""first floor"" in our building is the SECOND FLOOR and I work on the THIRD FLOOR. The best parking spots are under the building. (there are other parking spots, but your car is more exposed) You don't get rained on, when it snows, you don't get snowed on (which means you don't have to clean your car off - YES!) There is a total of 14 spots. 2 are handicap spots and another has a sign that says ""FOR LOADING AND UNLOADING ONLY"" I often see Bill, my old boss, parked there. I hate it. What I hate most of all though is that Clare, an older woman from the 2nd floor always, ALWAYS, <B>ALWAYS</B> parks in one of the handicap spots. Always the same one. I can't imagine that she doesn't see the handicap wheelchair painted on the ground. At first I thought ""Well, maybe there wasn't another one available"" But no. For the past few weeks, the non handicap parking spot 2 spaces over is always available, and I see her, I <i>watch</i> her park into it. She waves at me, I give her a small smile and wave back. What I want to do is ask her why she parks there. But I don't want it to become this big huge thing, but seriously, when there are other parking spots - just as good - why doesn't she park there?? And the handicap spot isn't even that good! It only covers the front part of the car. 

Seeing as how today is December 1, I have finally given in to listening to Christmas music. It wasn't even Thanksgiving and they were playing it. I have no problem whatsoever about Christmas music. The thing is, I don't want to listen to it when it's not cold. And I cry during it! I don't want to cry everyday about it. But I did listen to it a little this morning. 2 diffrent stations playing Christmas music. Both playing that Josh Grobin song. o.O"

"event","Thanksgiving pet peeve - calling it ""Turkey Day""

I loved that I had 4 days off. I had envisioned it with my, snuggled in my bed, crocheting and watching dvd's.

Thursday - Thanksgiving. Slept in but not a lot. Marc came over earlier than I expected. Got dressed and ready to go to Marc's house to meet his dad so we could go to ""Old Swede's Inn"" the place for our Thanksgiving Feast. It certainly wasn't like a home Thanksgiving. I had:
- Crab Bisque (the appetizer)
- Cold bread
- Salad
- Turkey (white and dark)*
- Stuffing*
- Mashed Potatoes (with the skin - ewwww)*
- Peas (blech)* 
* All items with this means I COVERED IT IN GRAVY!

All in all, it was ok. I thank Marc's dad for inviting me to it, and paying for my meal. His fiance and her family are a little odd. Andrea (Marc's sister) and I thought up a whole sinario where Michael and Kathy (the fiance's sister and brother in law) steal a little girl to raise as Kyle's (their son) bride to be. 

Then we went to Marc's, and fell asleep. We woke up at 10:30 so we could get in line to wait for Stormwatch comic's early black Friday sale. It was freezing, but we were first in line. And we spent way too much money - on ourselves.

Friday - Marc woke up and went shopping! I slept in. How much of a reverse is that?! He went to work, and I got ready to meet Andrea at Macaroni Grill to eat lunch and then go to the movies. We saw Rent (...I give it a B+. Of course, I have never seen anything regarding this, and I liked what I saw to an extent. Andrea said it could have been better) and Pride & Prejudice (A+++++++++!!!! OMG, it was so good. And I am glad I saw it with her, because she loved it just as much - it was one of those movies where you are just dying with emotion. And Mr. Darcy is to DIE for). 

Andrea dropped me off at Macaroni Grill and I ate some dinner and went to Best Buy to buy a few gifts before they closed. I went home and waited for Marc.

Saturday - Went shopping for some Christmas things. We went out to eat and made a list of things we still needed to get. $250 worth (approximatly) yuck. Christmas, you suck!

Sunday - nothing. Marc and I watched Friends all day long. Until it was time for Desperate Housewives and Grey's Annatomy. It was great. 

<lj-cut text=""a bit of a rant"">

I miss the old times. I am very happy where I am at now, but I miss the OLD times. When I would spend Christmas with Marajean and Sara. And I would go over to Sara's house every night and have fun. Now, Sara doesn't call me. I am sure she has her reasons, as I pretty busy after work doing small things, but over all, it's just that it slips my mind. And I know that it is that way with her too, so I have no anger. Just sadness. I miss it. I miss a lot of things. Ok, but this isn't the rant. The rant is, I hate people who do drugs. Seriously, it has got to be the dumbest thing anyone can ever do. And what's worse is when people say things like ""I am soooooo high right now"" or ""Man...I am SO wasted"" like they thing it's the greatest thing in the world and everyone should know and give them money or something. And then something bad happens and they say ""Why do bad things happen to me?"" Well, maybe you shouldn't be such a stupid druggy! Huh? What about that, you stupid coked up freak? Did you ever stop to think maybe it's because of you?? Nope, you wouldn't, would you. Gawd, people like that make me wish bad things.

I wish I had thought of it sooner to make one of those countdown things, you know what I mean? Like one where it's ""9 months, 3 days until my birthday"" and it keeps track of it for you. Then again, I scribbled all the days on my calender as a countdown, so that's good enough. I got paid today, which is awesome. Also, I had a nice long talk with Judith downstairs. She is such a sweetheart. She gave me her phone number to call her if I ever wanted to hang out. Of course, that would have to be after Marajean comes! I am too busy with stuff I have to do. I know I will be crocheting all this weekend. I have too many things I have put aside for people who are paying me.

$25 - Danielle's hat and scarf
$20 - Cody's scarf
$25 - Molly's hat and scarf
$10 - Molly's Apple Hat

I need to do Jeff's hat and scarf ($25 and he already gave me the money), Lori's hat and scarf($25) (for her daughter) Kristina's hat and scarf($25), Nicky's hat and scarf($25) and I know there was one other one. That's some money making though.

Ok, off to go fax, and then Happy Thanksgiving vacation for me! WOO HOO!!"

I hope labor isn't this bad. There were some people who were waiting since 4:00pm yesterday! We barely made it (we were number 44 out of 46 premiums). Marc stood out there all night in the freezing rain. I went home and slept for about 4 hours, then woke up and went back out there. For Best Buy being the official sponsor, they did a CRAPPY job! I must remind myself to give them a horrible, horrible review/complain to Microsoft. I am kinda wet and cold now that I am in the office. An office of people who wouldn't understand or appreciate the fact that Marc and I have an XBOX 360. I would say it might be surreal, but I would be speaking for Marc because I feel too cold, and my hands hurt because last night, without knowing, I dropped both of my gloves outside of my car, and I found them this morning soaking wet. YUCK. 

Anyway, kudos to all those who also got one! We made some good friends while we were out there. (one of who didn't want the premium package, only the core, and someone bought his premium ticket (he had the last one) for $150. Luuuuuccckkkkyyyy."

<b>MARMERIES</b>

It must have been a Friday or Saturday night. Maybe during a hot Texas winter night. Marajean and I were in the living room on the couch bed, watching ""Little Women"", a movie we had both watched many a time, and loved greatly. I don't know what came over me, but as soon as I heard Jo (or Beth, or any of the other Little Women) say ""Marmy"" I went into histerics. Why? I don't know. But I said it over and over again. Marajean, at first laughing, got tired of the constant ""Marmy""-iage. She remembers me agreeing to stop if she rubbed my back. Yes, I will pretty much stop doing anything if you rub my back. 

I hope this does the ""Marmery"" justice.

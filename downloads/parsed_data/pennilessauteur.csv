...and what better to start things off than with the latest big news from the show that in that time has joined <i>Lost</i> and <i>Battlestar Galactica</i> to form a 3-way tie for my favourite: <i>Doctor Who</i>.

<lj-cut text=""The (11th) Doctor Is In"">I must admit that a lot of my love for this show is due to the delightful David Tennant and his marvellous, endearingly quirky portrayal of the Doctor. So it was with some dismay that I heard the news last October of his retirement: how could any actor ever fill the ratty old Converse of MY Doctor?

After months of wild speculation -- my personal choices were James Callis or Hugh Laurie -- the Eleventh Doctor was announced on January 3, in a special <i>Doctor Who Confidential</i>, as this guy:

By lucky coincidence, I happened to be in London at the time, & was able to watch the announcement live on telly whilst getting ready to go watch My Doctor pop his clogs as Hamlet -- by <i>unbelievably</i> lucky coincidence, since I showed up at the theatre expecting the understudy. Before the announcement that David Tennant was making his triumphant return to the boards of the Novello Theatre that night, the New Doctor was, unsurprisingly, the main topic of conversation amongst the audience. The main reaction was largely the same as that of headline writers the world over: ""Doctor <i>Who</i>?""

The next day, browsing for something to read at the airport, I was amazed to see that the New Doctor was front-page news. Can I just say how much I adore the immensely wide-spread love for DW in Britain? I can't think of a single TV show in North America for which a casting decision would earn a front-page mention in pretty much every newspaper, not to mention a highly-rated special on prime-time TV to announce it in the first place.

On my 9-hour + plane ride, I had plenty of time to read the articles and form an opinion of this young interloper. I struggled mightily to give him a fair chance -- after all, all I was judging him on was a single interview and a couple of photos. He didn't seem like a <i>terrible</i> choice: he was delightfully eccentric in the interview, after all. But still! He was so young! He had emo hair! And, worst of all, he was Not David Tennant. I remained ambivalent, but granted him a grudging sort of acceptance. 

Time passed. DT returned to film his final episodes. <i>Planet of the Dead</i> aired, and My Doctor saved the world once again. This Matt Smith guy faded into a distant future. Until this morning that is, when pictures were released of him as the Doctor, costume, assistant and all:

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/newdoctor1.jpg"" />

And you know what? Ambivalance be damned, I kind of love him! I mean, just look at how adorable those two are. (And so what if as of Sunday the Doctor and I will be the same age. Well, not ""the Doctor"", who is after all 900-and-something, but the actor portraying him.) I love that they've given him a old-man look, to contrast his youth. He looks like a rather uncool sort of teacher, which seems quite appropriate. And while he's kept his hair it's been tamed just enough, into a style I'm rather fond of. Overall, thumbs-up from me. Plus, bonus points for the braces even if they are the clip-on kind. (What would Captain Jack say?) I do love a man in braces, strangely enough.

And even if his companion does have the somewhat questionable last name of Pond & look relatively contemporary (I had been hoping for a historical companion), I like that she gets to keep her Scottish accent -- and bonus points for being a readhead. (Gingers represent!)

And they look even better in the <a href =""blogtorwho.blogspot.com"">filming pics</a>. (Spoilers!) Seeing him in costume next to the Tardis, he really <i>does</i> look like the Doctor.

My first thought on seeing the costume was John Smith, my second was Indiana Jones at his day job. Both references seem appropriate, adventurers disguised as schoolteachers. So complain away, everyone, but I like it. With all these new photos, I'm actually really excited to meet the Eleventh Doctor; I think the way they've been introducing him is perfect. Announce the casting over a year in advance, so everyone has a long time to get over their inevitable negative reaction, then six months later announce the costume and companion; repeat negative reaction, & coming to terms with. By the time the first episodes actually air more than eight months from now, pretty much everyone will have gotten over their fear of change & be feverishly anticipating the New Doctor. 

Of course, we've still got the bound-to-be-heartbreaking finale for the Tenth Doctor to get through first...</lj-cut>"

"event","To celebrate the return of <i>Lost</i>, a picspam recap of epic proportions!<center><img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/BOTErecapgraphic.jpg"">

<lj-cut text=""Previously, on Lost...""></center>So far, all three premieres have opened with an eye...er, opening:
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/premiereeyes.jpg"">

And in seasons 2 & 3, the owner of said eye put on some music...
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/premieremusic.jpg"">

And went about his or her day...
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/premierelife.jpg"">

Until something weird happened, and then it turned out we were actually on Craphole Island. SURPRISE!
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/premierereveal.jpg"">


But, that was before <i>Lost</i> went ""Through the Looking Glass"" and forward to the future in the last season finale.
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/wehavetogobacksm.jpg"">

So this year, after almost nine months with no <i>Lost</i>, millions of people tune in, expecting eyes, music, and cunning misdirection, and the first thing they get to see is... a pile of papayas on the beach? WTF?
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/papayas.jpg"">

Psych! We're back in Kansas, Toto: they're actually outside a warehouse in Los Angeles! And also involved in a high-speed car chase.
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/carchase.jpg"">

And then things get a bit meta, because the car chase we're watching on TV? Well, now we're watching on TV as someone on TV watches...on TV.
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/carchasetv.jpg"">

But who's watching it? Here's a hint: he likes to top off his morning OJ with a splash of vodka.
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/screwdriver.jpg"">

Only a splash? Well, then it can't possibly be Jack. He'd be drinking it straight out of the...
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/jackdrinking.jpg"">

Wait, it IS Jack! And he doesn't have the hideous beard yet! So, does that mean we're not in the future? But, that car DID look awfully familiar. And Jack seems to recognise it too... So, who could be on the run from the law? Kate? Sawyer?
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/hurleyunderarrest.jpg"">

...Hurley? Oh, right: that's his vintage Camaro, limited edition Daddy Issues model. Jack should really look into getting one of those.
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/littlehurleycamaro.jpg"">

So Hurley tries a foot-dash away from the fuzz, bless him, but not surprisingly he doesn't get very far. And then we find out for certain that it's 2007, because he tries on the whole 'But I'm a Celebrity!' defense for reckless driving. At least he's wearing underwear.
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/oceanicsixtext.jpg"">

Hope you're not drunk, Hurley. Jacob does NOT approve of drinking and driving.
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/dddeaths.jpg"">

And speaking of Ana-Lucia, the detective interviewing Hurley is none other than her old partner, who is apparently the one person who misses her. I almost feel sorry for him, and then I remember how much I hated her, so...nope.
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/BotEdetective.jpg"">

Anywho, the important thing in this scene seems to be that Hurley lies about having known Ana-Lucia. Unless he just mentally blocked her out because she was so unpleasant. Plus, he looks really, really sad:
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/hurley1.jpg"">

And then, a mere 5 minutes in, we get the first WTF, freeze-frame moment of the year: the 2-way mirror into the interrogation room turns into a window to the ocean, and Charlie appears with a message on his hand -- just before the glass breaks, flooding the room with water. (Not unlike the way he died.)
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/charliemessage.jpg"">

So, Hurley starts freaking out, as you do when when death seems imminent. But when Mr. Ana-Lucia comes back, everything's back to normal. He threatens to lock Hurley up in the nut house, and Hurley hugs him with gratitude. ...As you do when forced incarceration in a mental institution seems imminent.
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/hurley6.jpg"">

...But back on dear old Craphole Island, Hurley is still his lovable old self, engaging in some expository banter on the walkie with Jack.
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/hurleyvan.jpg"">

It's just as well he can't see the saucy wink Jack throws Ben's way though. Oh, Jack -- Tom isn't even in the ground yet!
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/jackwink.jpg"">

Then we get a sequence where everyone says how happy they are to be going home, just to up the dramatic irony, because we have seen the future, brothah, and some unspecified Terrible Thing has happened to make everyone miserable and/or dead.

But for now, Kate can be happy about going home to death row...
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/kate1.jpg"">

And Rose can be happy that her cancer will come back; Claire that she can be a single mother on welfare; and Sun... well, Sun is the only one who really DOES have a reason to be happy, because leaving the Island means she might not die after all.
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/sunclairerose.jpg"">

But Jack doesn't have time to be happy about going home to his dead dad and ex-wife, because he's too busy being thrilled to bits that he finally gets to kill Locke. That's just one of the many sacrifices he makes as leader, and don't you forget it.
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/jack1.jpg"">

Even Alex has decided that the fact the mother she thought was dead turned out to be the crazy lady living in the woods, and the man she thought was her father actually kidnapped her as a baby and is now beaten bloody and tied to a tree is a great reason to ignore both of them and have a romantic picnic with her boyfriend. Teenagers.
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/alexkarlpicnic.jpg"">

But one person who refuses to join in the happiness, for fear that he might be stripped of his membership in the Evil Genius Club, is Ben. He will insist on telling everyone that they're going to die, for which Rousseau thanks him by punching him in the face. Ah, happy families -- they're all alike.
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/benrousseau.jpg"">

But Hurley can always be counted on for some happiness. Back on the beach, he's telling Bernard that he can't wait to get home & go back to being poor. (He'd better hope Walt doesn't find him, to collect his backgammon winnings.)
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/hurleybernard.jpg"">

Then, to show how happy he is, he re-enacts a scene from <i>Baywatch</i> by running in slow motion across the beach.
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/hurley2.jpg"">

He cannonballs into the water, and as the happiness builds, so does the tension: there's too much happiness! Too much! Something has to go wrong soon, this is <i>Lost</i>!
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/hurleyunderwater.jpg"">

Sure enough, when he surfaces, the bad news has arrived in the form of Desmond, the Angel of Death. The sexy, sexy Angel of Death. Everyone's very excited to see him: usually characters away from the beach camp at the finale take several episodes to make their way back!
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/badnews.jpg"">

But Desmond's all worked up about it being Not Penny's Boat, and wants to stop Jack from contacting them. Only Hurley notices the obvious, and wants to know where Charlie is. Duh, Hurley: didn't you watch the recap that was just on? How about the pop-up video rerun last night? The previously? (I swear, I've watched Charlie die four times already this week.) Apparently not, so Desmond breaks the news.
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/desmond1.jpg"">

This causes great sadness all round. Hot, smouldering sadness.
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/sawyer1.jpg"">
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/sayid1.jpg"">

Meanwhile, Jack's chatting to his new BFF Minkowski. But Minkowski totally gives him the brush-off, and asks to speak to Naomi. But Jack doesn't want Naomi to take away his new friend, so he does the worst job of lying ever, & tells him that she went to...uh, get some firewood! Yeah, firewood, that's it!
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/jackphone.jpg"">

But when he looks over to check on Naomi, she's run away! So he just HANGS UP on Minkowski. Now there's no-one to be his friend. And also no-one to rescue them. Great plan, Jack.
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/jackkate1.jpg"">

After the break, the folks at the beach are faced with a dilemma over what to do with Charlie's warning. And I am faced with a dilemma over whether to side with Sawyer (who wants to tell Jack) or Sayid (who doesn't).
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/beachgroup1.jpg"">

Hurley solves the argument by throwing the walkie into the ocean. Simple AND effective! The others (& The Others) could learn from him.
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/hurleysawyer.jpg"">

Back at the radio tower, Rousseau interrupts Jack's handing out of sticks to redshirts to tell him that she's found Naomi's trail.
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/jackrousseau.jpg"">

And this is his reaction: (yes, this is vital to the plot, & no, I'm not just putting this in as an excuse to laugh at Jack's ridiculous faces. But as it is here: Ha-ha!)
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/jackface1.jpg"">

So Jack takes one last opportunity to boss everyone around before heading off with Rousseau & Ben to find Naomi. (Is that blue-shirted redshirt smoking? If he's been saving that cigarette til the moment of rescue, he is going to be PISSED OFF when the boat people kill everyone instead.)
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/jackgroup.jpg"">

But then Kate comes running up with an idea so great, maybe this time Jack will finally let her in his secret fort.
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/jackkate3.jpg"">

""Jack, Jack! I found a different bloody trail leading off into the jungle. I think we should follow both of them because we don't know which one's Naomi's.""
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/kate3.jpg"">

""Silly Kate! Tracking's for boys. Now give me a hug, then you be a good girl and go with the other women and children down to the beach. Leave the tracking to people who know what they're doing: a surgeon, a Crazy French Lady, and our shifty-eyed <strike>dog</strike> prisoner.""
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/jack3.jpg"">

Ben likes to watch. (Note: This shot seems so weird now because it will BE IMPORTANT LATER.)
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/jackkateben.jpg"">

Back on the beach, the villagers have gotten up a posse to warn the good doc about the folks on Not Penny's Boat.
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/posse1.jpg"">

Sawyer's got a big gun. (Also: <strike>Gratuitous explosions</strike> heroic pose with gun & pithy catchphrases? <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/08/opinion/08lindelof.html?ex=1341547200&en=e6fca553f2464adc&ei=5124&partner=permalink&exprod=permalink"">Sounds familar</a>.)
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/sawyergun.jpg"">

Hurley shouldn't be so worried, though: look how happy he is in the future, wearing his pyjamas all day long, and playing Connect-4 without a care in the world.
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/hurleyconnect4.jpg"">

...That is, until THIS guy shows up. He doesn't look at all ominous, does he?
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/abaddon.jpg"">

His name is Abaddon, which means 'Destroyer', but hey, I'm sure that's just a coincidence, right? Anyway, he and Hurley have a nice little chat over a (Symbolism Alert!) chessboard, and in front of a chalkboard with a drawing of (Easter Egg Alert!) an island, a boat, and a shark.
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/hurleyabaddon.jpg"">

He works for Oceanic, and he just wants to offer Hurley an 'upgrade' to a nicer nuthouse, that's all, no strings attached. Only he must have 'forgotten' his business cards at home. Then he asks Hurley if they're still alive, and Hurley's like, I left that damn island because I couldn't deal with this level of creepiness, damnit!
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/hurley3.jpg"">

But when everyone looks over at him, he's vanished. Maybe he left a trail (or two) behind they can track?
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/abaddongone.jpg"">

Back on the island, it's Freaky Friday time when Sawyer wants to help Hurley by talking about Charlie's death, while Hurley's all strong & silent man of action.
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/sawyerhurley.jpg"">

So Sawyer catches back up with the rest of the posse, but it doesn't take Hurley long to regret his ""I vant to be alone"" stance as he gets lost in the dark jungle, a creepy breeze picks up, and the mysterious whispers start.
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/hurley7.jpg"">

And then he comes face to face with the Shrieking Shack. A light comes on inside. And, unique amongst these characters, Hurley has the only rational response: ""Uh-oh.""
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/jacobsshack.jpg"">

Elsewhere in the jungle, Rousseau has reached a dead end on Naomi's trail, and Jack has a little difficulty comprehending the fact that he was wrong.
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/jackbenrousseau.jpg"">

Of course, Ben can't pass up the opportunity to put Jack in his place with  one of his brilliant lines: ""Better call the boat, and tell them she's getting a <i>really big</i> bundle of firewood."" Awesome.
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/jackben1.jpg"">

I'm more shocked here by the fact that Jack actually reaches for phone, seemingly to take Ben's advice & call the freighter, than I am by the fact the phone's missing.
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/jackben2.jpg"">

And really, Jack makes himself such an easy target for Ben, who's only too happy to tell him that Kate took the phone when she hugged him goodbye. And that she found the right trail. ""But you wouldn't listen to her, so I guess she's taken matters into her own hands."" The Others must have satellite tv -- Ben's seen this show before! 
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/ben1.jpg"">

""But look on the bright side, at least somebody around here knows what they're doing."" Is it weird that I like the villain so much more than the hero right now?
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/ben2.jpg"">

Sure enough, Kate has redeemed herself from the role of Jack's doormat that she played for much of last season. Not only is she hot on Naomi's trail, she's having a good old chinwag with Jack's pal Minkowski on the phone.
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/katephone.jpg"">

But this Minkowski guy must be a real jerk, cause Kate hangs up on him too. If I was him I'd figure that these people don't want to be rescued, and just leave. But Kate has bigger problems than that right now: a tree has just started bleeding on her.
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/kateblood.jpg"">

Oh, that's okay, it's just Naomi. She must've taken a cue from poor Charlie & been hanging out with Treebeard. But she manages to undo all the smarts Kate had just managed to build up for herself by taking her captive. 
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/katenaomi.jpg"">

For a professional fugitive, Kate sure does seem to get caught a lot.
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/katescaptures.jpg"">

Anywho, Minkowski just happens to call back right then, and Naomi gets Kate to give her the phone. While she doesn't let on about being stabbed in the back, she does ask Minkowski to tell her sister that she loves her, which could either be vitally important later on, or totally meaningless. It's hard to tell sometimes. 
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/naomi.jpg"">

And as luck would have it, Naomi has just enough time to fix the <strike>plot device</strike> technical problems before she snuffs it for good.
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/naomidead.jpg"">

FINALLY, we get back to Hurley, chez Jacob. He doesn't look as surprised as you might think to see a spooky cabin in the middle of the jungle, but hey, after the polar bears & black smoke monsters and all the other craziness, this might be the most NORMAL thing they've found on the island. So he goes to peer in the window.
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/hurleychezjacob.jpg"">

A bit depressing, no? Too bad Tom's dead, maybe he could've fixed the place up a bit for Jacob, and then he might not be so angry. And Kate could make him some new curtains, I hear she's quite the expert at that.
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/jacobswindow.jpg"">

So at first, the place looks like it's empty, despite the lit oil lamp on the table.
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/jacobslantern.jpg"">

But then -- fingers on the pause buttons, everyone! -- the second WTF, freeze-frame Easter Egg moment of the season: CHRISTIAN SHEPHARD IS SITTING IN JACOB'S CHAIR.
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/jacobchristian.jpg"">

Of course, Hurley doesn't know who Christian Shephard is, or even that only very special, Chosen One-types can see Jacob at all, nor, unfortunately, can he hear everyone yelling this at their TVs. So he very sensibly just stands and stares with his best WTF expression on.
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/hurley8.jpg"">

That is, until this scary, mysterious eye suddenly pops up right in front of him. 
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/jacobseye.jpg"">

It is at this point that Hurley loses it & runs for the hills, screaming for help. Meanwhile, the audience at home starts yelling out the names of every character who's ever appeared on the show whose eye that might be. Jacob! Charlie! Locke! Mikhail! Steve! Scott! That one guy who was in the background for a second in Season 1!
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/hurleyrunning.jpg"">

Hurley looks back to make sure no ghosts are chasing him, only to see that the cabin has completely vanished. Not one to look a gift horse in the mouth, he turns back around to continue on his way -- only to see the cabin has MOVED & is now right in front of him. And for full horror-movie effect, the door slowly creaks open.
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/hurleyshack2nd.jpg"">

This time, he tries closing his eyes & counting to five. Man, is Kate going to be angry when she realises that Jack tells their special story to anyone who'll listen.
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/hurley4.jpg"">

When he opens his eyes, the cabin's gone. (Teach me your secret sometime, Hurley?) He's so relieved, he trips over a log & falls on the ground. This time when he opens his eyes, Locke is looming over him. Damn, thinks Hurley. I asked for Libby, naked.
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/locke.jpg"">

Hurley fills Locke in on the whole Not Penny's Boat deal, & Locke spies an prime opportunity to use some of his newly-acquired, Benry-patented mind trickery in order to win Hurley over to his side.
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/lockehurley.jpg"">

Locke & Hurley catch up with the rest of the beach posse at the cockpit. Hurley gets an enthusiastic welcome; Locke, not so much.
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/cockpit1.jpg"">

At this point, Locke's done so much crazy shit that I'm having trouble keeping track of who wants to kill him for what. Good thing Sayid clarifies that HE's mad over the blowing-up of the submarine.
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/sayid2.jpg"">

Luckily for Locke, he's interrupted by noises in the jungle, which means it's lock and load time, boys.
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/cockpit2.jpg"">

It's the radio tower refugees, who have managed to stumble upon the beach posse's exact location. This can only mean one thing: happy reunion montage!
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/sunjinreunion.jpg"">
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/rosebernardreunion.jpg"">
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/julietalex.jpg"">

But not everyone has someone to hug:
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/sawyer3.jpg"">

And, saddest of all,
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/claire.jpg"">

Desmond goes to break the news to Claire, but Hurley cuts him off, and approaches Claire with a grim face & accompanied by rising swells of Sad Death Music.
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/desmondhurley.jpg"">

She's already guessed by the time he gets to her, but he confirms her fears, and they have a good cry on each others' shoulders.
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/hurleyclaire.jpg"">

Most traumatic experiences on the Island bring on a flashback, but this one induces a flashforward. Hurley's still at the sanitarium, sitting outside & painting an Arctic scene.
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/hurleypainting.jpg"">

Just when we're wondering what this has to do with Charlie's death, a fellow crazy tells Hurley that someone's watching him. And when he looks up, it's not the expected Creepy Guy from earlier, but...
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/charlie1.jpg"">

CHARLIE! Wow, death sure has been kind to you! And it looks like Boone got you in to see his hairdresser. Anyway, he's all, ""Hey man, just popped round for a chat. And I wouldn't say no to a cup of tea if you've got one.""
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/hurleycharlie1.jpg"">

""By the way, I had a dream once where you were wearing a robe just like that.""
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/hurleyvision.jpg"">

But Hurley doesn't seem to be very glad to see him. Probably, you know, on account of him being dead and all.
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/hurley9.jpg"">

A way to tell that Charlie's dead? He doesn't get all huffy when he recounts how Hurley ran away from him in the convenience store. A way to tell <i>Lost</i> has seriously picked up the storytelling pace? It's only 3/4 through this episode, and already a question posed at the beginning has been answered.
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/charlie2.jpg"">

""I am dead. But I'm also here,"" Charlie paradoxes. <i>[Excellent. That just won me 10 bucks in a bet with my sister.]</i> But Hurley has had experience with imaginary friends, and won't believe him. So Charlie proves his existance by slapping him.
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/hurley10.jpg"">

I guess Hurley doesn't remember how his other imaginary friend was also able to slap him (and throw coconuts at him) even though he DIDN'T actually exist.
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/dave.jpg"">

Anyways, they finally sit down & have quite a touching little chat where Hurley gets to achieve some closure in Charlie's death.
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/hurleycharlie3.jpg"">

But then Charlie reveals the real reason he's there: to serve as Hurley's conscience and/or an emissary from the Island. There's something Hurley has to do, but he's hiding from it.
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/hurleycharlie4.jpg"">

""They need you.""
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/charlie3.jpg"">

Hurley tries the old ""I'm not listening, lalala"" trick, before he breaks out the big guns of closing his eyes and counting to five.
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/hurleynotlistening.jpg"">

Once again, it works: he's left on his own at the mental hospital.
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/hurleyalone.jpg"">

Back on the Island, I'm not sure whether Claire's sadder over Charlie being dead, or that awful wig she's now wearing.
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/clairesad.jpg"">

And then Jack barrels into this touching emotional scene, and kind man that he is, he thoughtfully decides that this is the moment to finish his vendetta against Locke by knocking him to the ground & holding a gun to his head.
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/jacklockegun.jpg"">

Juliet briefly tries to reason with Jack, but alas she lacks Kate's ability to break up a fight with a single word.
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/juliet2.jpg"">

Locke's pretty confident though, cause he knows that Jacob will sic Ol' Smokey on Jack if he tries anything. But Jack's not about to let Locke out-crazy him, so he does, in fact, shoot him.
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/jackgun.jpg"">

...but luckily the gun's not loaded. Jack, if <i>Ben</i> couldn't kill Locke, I hardly think you're going to manage it. Jack resorts to some good old-fashioned punching instead, until Sayid & Sawyer finally pull him away.
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/sawyerjacksayid.jpg"">

We've sure come a long way in three months, haven't we boys?
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/sawyersayidfight.jpg"">

Welcome to what is sure to be an intelligent & mature debate between your leaders, the Man of Science & the Man of Faith.

Up first, the Man of Faith: ""Everything I did was in your best interests.""
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/locke1.jpg"">

And with the rebuttal, the Man of Science: ""You're INSANE!""
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/jack4.jpg"">

Hmmm, present events seem to suggest this is a case of pot vs kettle, so point to MoF for appearing the MORE resonable of the two.

MoF: ""I never did anything to hurt any of you.""
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/locke2.jpg"">

MoS: ""All you ever did was blow up every chance we had of getting off this island.""
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/jackface2.jpg"">

Well, there's no denying the truth in that statement. Point to MoS.

But Jack loses the next point: when he accuses Locke of killing Naomi, lawyer Ben reminds everyone: ""Well, technically he didn't kill her -- yet."" Ben sure has great comic timing.
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/benrousseau2.jpg"">

Then Kate appears, just in time to say, ""Yes, he did. She just died."" I can only wonder how long she's been standing off in the shadows, waiting for the best moment to make a dramatic entrance.
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/kate4.jpg"">

So, Kate's all proud that she's gotten the phone fixed, and brought it back for Jack -- and she can also report that Naomi covered for them (well, for Locke).
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/katephone2.jpg"">

But Locke rains all over her parade by remaining convinced that it's all just part of some master plan to get the rest of the freighter folk to the Island so they can begin wreaking havoc.
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/locke4.jpg"">

He plans to go to the barracks and live in a house lined completely with tin foil so their mind rays can't get him. He makes his case convincing by utilising the knowledge from all those nights spent eating dinner in front of the TV: <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088247/"">""If you want to live, you'd better come with me.""</a>
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/locke3.jpg"">

Jack makes his case against Locke by utilising the knowledge from all those days spent being beaten up at school: ""No-one's going anywhere with you, John, because they're not <i>crazy</i>.""
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/jack5.jpg"">

We are saved from another scintillating Jack/Locke schoolyard yelling match when Hurley speaks up, much to everyone's surprise. ""He's not crazy."" Well, Hurley should know from crazy.
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/hurley11.jpg"">

Hurley also knows how to win over a crowd much better than the other two <strike>crazies</strike> leaders, so he launches into a heartfelt, emotional speech (backed up by Ye Olde Sad Death Music again) about how Charlie died to save them...
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/hurleysad.jpg"">

...But that he realised something at the last moment, so his final act was to warn them. <i>[Charlie's death scene count: 5]</i>
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/notpennysboat.jpg"">

""So I'm not listening to you. I'm listening to my friend. I'm listening to Charlie,"" he concludes before going over to stand with Locke.
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/lockehurleysides.jpg"">

In what should be no surprise to anyone, Jack is moved to tears by this. I was going to say that this is because everyone isn't following his orders, but Hurley's speech <i>was</i> very moving, & I just realised that this <i>is</i> the first Jack's heard of Charlie's death, so I'll give him the benefit of the doubt.
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/jears1.jpg"">

And besides, it just wouldn't be a season premiere if Jack didn't cry at <i>least</i> once:
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/premierejears.jpg"">

So the survivors split into two tribes. Joining Hurley on Team Locke are:
Claire,
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/clairesides.jpg"">
Rousseau & Ben (Who hilariously asks Jack's permission first),
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/benrousseausides.jpg"">
Alex & Karl,
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/alexkarlsides.jpg"">
A bunch of redshirts who don't get closeups, cause no-one cares about them,
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/sides1.jpg"">
And finally, agonisingly, Sawyer:
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/sawyersides.jpg"">

When Kate, with a note of desperation in her voice, asks him what he's doing, he replies, ""Same thing I've always done: surviving."" Something else he's always done, & looks like he's right back to doing here? Hating himself.
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/sawyer4.jpg"">

Kate's not used to those she loves leaving her -- usually it's the other way round. She looks betrayed, abandoned -- and like she kinds wants to go with him. She stays with Jack, though.
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/sawyerkatesides.jpg"">

Also on Team Jack:
Desmond,
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/desmond4.jpg"">
Sayid,
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/sayid3.jpg"">
Juliet,
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/juliet3.jpg"">
Rose & Bernard,
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/rosebernard.jpg"">
Sun & Jin (although we don't see them), and the rest of the redshirts.
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/sides2.jpg"">

Once they're divided, it starts to rain -- never a good sign on this island. ""You know where to find us when you change your mind,"" are Locke's confident parting words.
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/rain.jpg"">

I'm betting those who chose Team Locke are feeling pretty smug right now, knowing they're heading to warm, dry beds, hot showers & rooves over their heads. For better or for worse, though, the decisions are made, and the two tribes go their separate ways. With a few last longing glances.
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/kate6.jpg"">

Hurley walks off right into the future, where it's sunny, & he's shooting some hoops by himself. Even though he's wearing slippers & a dressing gown, which I would think might get in the way, he never misses a shot.
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/hurleybasketball.jpg"">

Then his third visitor announces himself, & this one is neither creepy nor dead, but a relaxed and happy-looking Jack.
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/jackff1.jpg"">

Aw -- what a difference from both his own flashforward, & his present on-Island self. He exposits that he was in the neighbourhood on a consult, & thought he'd drop in. He suggests a game of HORSE.
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/jackbasketball.jpg"">

As they play, they make expository small talk. Jack sucks at basketball, and it isn't long before he's an H-O. Unlike Island Jack, Future Jack seems cool with not being the best at everything. I like Future Jack. He also drops this gem: ""I'm thinking about growing a beard.""
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/basketball1.jpg"">

""You'd look weird with a beard, dude.""
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/hurleybasketball2.jpg"">

Yeah, I'm going to have to agree with Hurley on this one.
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/jackffbeardwig.jpg"">

But just when it looks like Jack only stopped by to rub in how much better his off-Island life is than Hurley's, Hurley cuts to the chase: ""You checking to see if I went nuts? If I was going to tell?""
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/hurley12.jpg"">

Like Abaddon, once his bluff is called, Jack gets straight to the point: ""Are you?""
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/jack6.jpg"">

Hurley doesn't answer, so Jack goes to leave. (Ah, now <i>there's</i> Island Jack.) But Hurley stops him with an apology -- a mysterious apology (Is there any other kind on this show?): ""I'm sorry I went with Locke. I should have stayed with you.""
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/hurleyjack.jpg"">

Jack graciously(!) accepts the apology, but Hurley keeps going, hinting around the Big Secret that the Oceanic Six seem to be keeping. ""I don't think we did the right thing, Jack. I think it wants us to come back. And it's going to do everything it can...""
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/hurley13.jpg"">

""We're never going back!""
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/jackff2.jpg"">

Watch out for falling Anvils of Dramatic Irony!
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/jackgobacktext.jpg"">

As well as Anvils of Foreshadowing, as Hurley calls after him, ""Never say never, dude!""
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/jackleaving.jpg"">

Back on the Island, Jack thanks everyone who stayed with him by abandoning them to stand alone by the cockpit, listen to Morrissey , & cry.
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/jackcockpit.jpg"">

Kate joins him, and they reminisce about all the good times they had there, back when Charlie was still alive, and they all saw the pilot get eaten by the monster, and then had to run for their lives.
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/jackkate2.jpg"">

But just when they're thinking that maybe the Island is so great they don't want to leave it after all, OMG! The rescue chopper appears.
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/searchlight.jpg"">

Naturally, it's flying a bit erratically, as though it might crash. As they watch, someone parachutes out.
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/helicopter.jpg"">

Jack and Kate run to find their rescuer -- and hope the rescuer won't need rescuing.
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/jackkate4.jpg"">

First of all, it is of course part of the flight number of the doomed plane itself, Oceanic 815:<center><img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/planecrashjulietsm.jpg""></center>

<lj-cut text=""It's been playing over...and over...for 16 years"">16 doesn't have as many interesting occurances as 23, despite being the safe-deposit box no. of choice for both Kate's marshal & Locke's dad, but the couple times it does turn up, it seem fairly important.

First off, it's how long Rousseau's been on The Island (or so she says...) which means that:

Her distress signal has been playing for 16 years, something the Losties are not too pleased to work out...<center><img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/rousseausmessagesm.jpg""></center> 
And Alex is 16 years old:

Also, according to the printout from the Pearl Station, the first system failure, that caused the crash of Oceanic 815, started at 4:16 on 22nd September:
<center><img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/systemfailureprintoutsm.jpg""></center>

And again I've done screenshots of the 16th second of the 16th minute of the 16th hour of each season. We get a break from Jack this time, as it's Hurley x2, and Sawyer.

From Season 1, ""Outlaws"":

So, in the <i>Lost</i> countdown I've had going in my head for quite some time now (exactly <i>how</i> long, I'm a bit embarased to say, but it's long enough that I've had to adjust it several times to allow for new premiere dates) has hit 23 days. And 23, as any <i>Lost</i> fan worth her salt knows, 23 is one of The Numbers. In celebration of this milestone, and in conjunction with me being rather bored due to a) being currently unemployed; and b) there being NOTHING on tv -- seriously, nothing -- I thought it might be fun to look at all the signifigant uses of the number 23 in <i>Lost</i> -- with pictures!

<lj-cut text=""The last new episode was aired on 23 May..."">In Season 1, it was the gate from which Oceanic Flight 815 left...
<center><img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/gate23sm.jpg""></center>
Meanwhile, Jack & Rose (& Bernard, til he went to the bathroom) were seated in Row 23...
<center><img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/row23sm.jpg""></center>
And Ray the farmer got a $23,000 reward for turning fugitive Kate in to the marshal.
<center><img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/katesmugshotsm.jpg""></center>

In Season 2, it was Penny's address in London when Desmond wrote to her from prison:
<center><img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/desmondsletterssm.jpg"">
<font size=""1"">(I just noticed that even though Desmond's return address is in Essex, the letters are postmarked in Knightsbridge, their destination. I think that's an oops, prop people!)</font></center>

And in Season 3, who could forget creepy Room 23, used by the Others for brainwashing horny teenage boys!
<center><img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/room23.png""></center>

And, because I had just that much time, I also took a screencap of the 23rd second of the 23rd minute of the 23rd hour of each season. (Yeah, I think I really need to find a job. Soon.) Interesting that it's all closeups of main characters -- and that, as usual, Jack is over-represented. Still, I think it's a good reflection of where the show's at in each season.

In Season 1, ""Exodus, Part I"":
<center><img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/ei232323.png""></center> It's Jack. Crying. Over his Daddy Issues. Hooray. Actually, it's right after the (rather touching, even to my cold and shriveled heart) scene where (shirtless, sweaty) Sawyer tells Jack about the conversation he had with Christian Shepherd in Sydney, thus letting Jack know that his dad is proud of him after all. Aw. Well, at least I <i>think</i> that's what was going on there. I was a bit distracted by all the shirtlessness and sweatiness going on with Sawyer. Plus the exquisitely tortured look in his eyes as his better instincts won out in a fierce internal battle. Oh, and this is immediately followed by a scene in which Kate begs Jack to allow her to tag along on his adventure to the mysterious Black Rock. Which he patronisingly agrees to. So, I reckon that's a pretty good snapshot of the show. Or, at least the love-triangle piece of it.

In Season 2, from the first hour of the finale, ""Live Together, Die Alone"":
<center><img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/ltda232323.png""></center>It's drunken Desmond! Drinking some more! And looking like a pirate! Very suitable for his first flashback episode, a 2-hour extravaganza during which he became one of my favourite characters. So this actually seems like a pretty good snapshot of where the show's at at that point: new characters have been introduced, the contents of the hatch have come to light, and we're moving beyond the plane crash and deeper into the island mythology. Plus, I'm sure that Desmond, Penny, and esp. Penny's dad are all much more involved with the Island than we currently know.

And in Season 3, from the second hour of ""Through the Looking Glass"":
<center><img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v158/pennilessauteur/ttlg232323.png""></center>And here again we have Jack crying! Only this time, it's beardy flash-forward Jack, strung out on prescription pain meds. I think what I enjoy most about the flash-forward is finally seeing Jack admit he was wrong -- and Kate being the one to spurn him when he begs her to accompany him on an adventure. So we've got a nice circle here: at 23:23:23 in Season 1 AND in Season 3 there's teary-eyed Jack, but the circumstances and even the characters are quite different. Which just goes to show: 1) <i>Lost</i> is awesome; and 2) Jack should really think about financing his trip back to the Island by buying some stock in the Kleenex company or something."

"event","So it might just be me, but today totally feels like a holiday. All week I've been looking forward to today, and now something just seems...special about it, somehow. Maybe it's the thought that right now, all over the world, thousands (or even millions? Hundreds of thousands at any rate) are all sitting reading the same book. It's quite a beautiful thought, really, to be a part of something so huge and uniting. Just now, when I was coming back from getting my copy, this little girl comes tearing past me up the street, clutching her own copy. She obviously couldn't wait to get home and find out what happens -- and neither could I.

Anyway, so I'm about 12 hours behind, but I just this minute got back from the bookshop with <i>Deathly Hallows</i>. I've also got a venti (which is so stupidly huge that I was embarassed to order it) London fog tea, and a pumpkin scone (not quite the same as a pumpkin pasty, but it will have to do). I am all set for a marathon reading session.

It's funny, years ago when I first read Harry Potter, I thought ahead to when Book 7 might be published (& so far away did it seem) and thought that by then I might be living in London. I would be all grown up by then, I thought, and I pictured myself sitting on the Tube on my way to my exciting and glamourous job reading the final book. Well, I suppose I was very nearly living in London at this point, but nearly isn't the same as actually, and actually here I am exactly where I was those 7(?) years ago: still living in my parent's house, with the rest of the family away on holiday. I had planned to sit out in the garden to read, like I did with all the rest of the books, but the weather isn't cooperating. It's pouring rain out, which does seem strangely fitting somehow. The perfect day to curl up inside with a good book, at any rate.

And very suitable that it's raining for The End. Like how it's always raining for funerals in movies. I am completely unspoiled, btw, and for the record, I <i>don't</i> think Harry's going to die. (Though I wouldn't be surprised if he did.) Some things I do think will happen: Dumbledore will come back in some way, shape, or form to help Harry. Snape will ultimately be good, and will die in the end. Neville and Ginny will have very important roles to play. And Neville or Ron will die. Which is very sad to me, as they're two of my favourite characters.

But enough of all this: time to crack open that book and find out what happens at last!"

"event","Went to see <i>Order of the Phoenix</i> last night -- almost went to a midnight show on Tues. night, but no-one else was very bothered, and I was really tired, so the thought of staying up til 3am, then having my alarm go off at 6:30 the next morning was not that appealing. Still, I really must to the midnight show of at least one of the final two movies. (If only <i>Australia</i> would have a midnight show when it finally opens! Seems highly unlikely though)

<lj-cut text = ""In which I fangirl (AND go on long digressions on the strengths & weakness of various media?)"">Anywho, I really liked it. Probably the second-best of the movies, after <i>Prisoner of Azkaban</i>. Although, it's a good thing I haven't read the book in over a year, because of all the things they left out. The scenes I most missed from the book were all the ones from the big Ministry of Magic battle -- the brains, the time-turners, and that. I can understand why they cut them out of the movie though, and I can appreciate that there's at least one movie this summer that knows less is more when it comes to emotional impact and keeping people's interest. Speaking of emotional impact though, WTF was up with Sirius's death? He's supposed to just get knocked off-balance and fall through a curtain -- NOT get Avadra-Kadavra-ed and then dissolve into some frakking mist. I suppose they felt they needed to make his death a bit more obvious,  but I think it would've worked well the other way.

As usual, the casting was brilliant: Imelda Staunton was simply marvellous as Umbridge, I reckon she's the best movie character to date. Luna was great as well. I'm only sorry that there isn't enough time to spend more with all these characters. (Another scene I would've loved to have seen in its entirety was Snape's Worst Memory. I'm glad they left it in, but it was like 30 seconds long! It just seemed a bit perfuntory here.) At least they gave Sirius a few good scenes  before he snuffed it, even if movie!Sirius is a bit soppier than book!Sirius.

Speaking of soppiness, I don't know what it is about these movies, but while I don't exactly burst into tears at them, I do tend to get very misty-eyed whenever there's the speech about the importance of love, and friendship and sacrifice and all that. I'm not usually a crier, but there's just something about it all that seems to get me. And moreso in the movies than the books, for some reason. I think here it was all the flashes of those things that we saw whilst Harry was possessed bu Voldemort: they really brought the idea home, in a very visceral and effective way that I think movies are better at than books. I mean, I love the HP books a lot more than the movies, because nothing beats them for immersion in this fantastical world, the details of everyday life, the access to the characters' intimate thoughts so we can understand them and watch them grow, but there are some things that the movies can do better.

I think, actually, that that possession scene is a perfect example of how to translate a book scene into a movie scene. The problem with making OotP into a movie is that so much of the book is spent inside Harry's head as he's being a Horrible Teenager. Without the access to his thoughts the book allows, the movie has a big task in dramatising all this. I think they did an admirable job (in fact, I prefer this new screenwriter; I wish he were staying on for HBP, as his dialogue is also a lot sharper) although it would've come off even better with a stronger actor as Harry.

As I type this, I've got the <i>Jericho</i> recap show on in the background -- I thought I should give it another chance, as I saw the first few eps last autumn & thought it was fairly silly, but when there was that whole hullaballoo when it was cancelled, I thought that maybe it got better. So far, ""What's this black stuff?"" ""That used to be Denver."" isn't really going to win me over. Granted, it's still on the beginning episodes, but so far all this is doing is reminding me how ridiculous it was: Daddy issues, pen (well, straw) tracheotomies, mysterious pasts, morally ambiguous character, food and water shortages -- remedied by supply drops from the sky --, love triangle -- I've seen this before, done much better -- and without the hokey small-town America vibe. Maybe I'm just bitter, because this is what I used to watch on Thursdays while waiting for the new ep of <i>Lost</i> to download, and that it was promoted (in Australia at least) with ads that made it seem like even more of a <i>Lost</i> clone than it did already. (The v/o would talk about 'the others' coming, the mysterious sickness, etc.) Plus, why the frak was this shown concurrently with the States when none of my favourite programmes were?

...okay, now they've gotten past the ridiculous 'radioactive rain' episode, so things are getting a bit more interesting, with these <strike>Others</strike> mercenaries.

...so, I suppose I'll give it a proper chance by watching a real episode, but still, I'm hardly riveted...something's missing...and I think that something is great characters. Because, when it comes down to it, that's what makes or breaks a tv show. Movies can get by with cardboard cutouts, because they're only an hour and a half or so long, and as long as there's sufficient amounts of action and explosions and generally cool stuff to look at, well, we can overlook a minor detail like a bland template of a hero/heroine/villain -- or even sidekick, as long as their jokes are funny enough, their one-liners quotable enough.

But on a tv show, the characters must be interesting enough for us to want to spend time with them not just for an hour or two one night, but every single week, for years. Movies are about events, Big Things Happening; tv shows are about people's Everyday Lives. Family life, work life, social life; the characters are friends who phone every week to update us. In the case of shows like <i>Lost</i>, <i>Battlestar Galactica</i>, or, yes, <i>Jericho</i>, those lives are predicated around a Big Event: a plane crash, the genocide of the human race, atomic war -- but that is gotten over with in the first hour; it's the prologue not the climax. The remaining hundred or so hours we spend with these people is all about who they are, how the event will change them, how they will rebuild their lives. The decisions, and consequences, mistakes and triumphs, relationships and moral questions that they deal with every day as they struggle to rebuild their lives.

So. The characters better be interesting, and the writing better be good if I'm going to care about any of this stuff enough to keep tuning in week after week a hundred times over. From what I've seen of <i>Jericho</i> so far, Our Hero is rather too bland for his Mysterious Background to seem very gripping. With his introduction as the prodigal son returning from parts unknown, it seems as though they're trying to make him into a sort of bad-boy anti-hero, but with his Daddy Issues and angst and romantic quandry between Girl Next Door and Temptress, he's stuck at just the traditional reluctant hero. Skeet Ulrich's lack of any real charisma, and his mostly one-dimensional portrayal don't really help, either.

But, look at me, saying I'd give it a second chance, then bashing it for paragraphs. Blank slate, open mind, and I'll try again."

"event","...so it's already been five weeks since the <i>Lost</i> finale. Only just over seven months left to go! I was going to use this time to, you know, get a life -- but then who would watch my TV? -- so instead I just seem to be finding more shows to watch.

<lj-cut text=""Ramblings of a TV Addict"">My original plan to spread BSG over the summer failed; I finished 'Crossroads Part 2' last week. I had wanted to wait for Season Three to come out on DVD sometime in August, but I just couldn't leave humanity enslaved by the Cylons on New Caprica for two months, not when I knew I could find out what happened with no waiting at all. There are drawbacks to watching a series all at once, but not having to wait for eight or nine frakking months after a cliffhanger is...would 'sublime' be too strong of a word? Unfortunately, now thanks to my impatience, I have to wait six months for the resolution to a much more shocking and dramatic cliffhanger. (OMGWTFCYLONS! STARBUCK?!)

On the drawback front, watching a show that has long since aired means that spoilers are much harder to avoid -- despite my best efforts, I managed to accidently spoil myself for the time-jump, and, worse, Tigh and Anders. (Though not the less-shocking Chief & Tory) At least Starbuck's death(?) and return were a complete shock.  -- Although, I was a bit worried about her as I had heard about Katee Sackoff being on the new <i>Bionic Woman</i>.  Also a drawback (for me) with having all the episodes to watch at once is not having that week in-between to think things over and theorise. I feel like watching several episodes in one sitting allowed less to really sink in. So, I think I will have to have a BSG rewatch over the rest of the hiatus, along with my Lost rewatch.

At least they've already started filiming the next season of BSG already -- a couple weeks ago, I drove past a sign to the set on my way to work. (Which made me wish I was going to work there, instead of my actual, boring job) I was trying to figure out what places were in that part of the city that they could've been using as locations, but really had no idea due to my crap sense of geography. Possibly some sort of waterfront/docklands area? Between that and the blue VW van I saw a couple days later that was identical to Roger Workman's (well, sans the Dharma logo, sadly) it was the most exciting week of commuting, well, ever.

I was looking forward to catching up with episodes of shows I'd missed (<i>The Office</i>, <i>Grey's</i>) and maybe getting hooked on some new ones (<i>Heroes</i>, <i>Ugly Betty</i>), but thanks to the networks' brilliant new plan of showing nothing but crap reality shows all summer,  guess I'll just have to find other ways <shifty eyes> of watching...or just, you know, not watch those shows at all. Way to cultivate an audience, networks. Sigh...whoever would've thought that the day would come when I'd miss summer reruns?

Well, there is <i>Doctor Who</i>, which I've started watching...just downloaded the series w/ Christopher Eccleston to catch up with, but am loving David Tennant as the Doctor. This week's ep was particularly exciting, as they were standing in practically the exact spot I stood in at the Globe Theatre! Plus, I'm a sucker for time travel, so I'm really enjoying it. They manage to throw in just the right amount of past/present/future irony and jokes I think, without it becoming annoying. (Oh, Book 7, you can't get here fast enough!)

Oops, this was <i>way</i> too much to write on TV. Am going to my boss's wedding tomorrow, so hopefully something interesting will happen there. The odds seem good, as apparently her fiance has allowed for <i>17</i>(!) drinks per person."

"event","Carlton: Assuming that they can get that radio to work, our guys can call that freighter, and they can get rescued.
Damon: But that's never going to happen... *Cunning sideways glance at Carlton*
Carlton: Well, so you say!
Damon: If they get off the island, the show's over.

<lj-cut text=""Curiouser and curiouser"">So, way to drop a subtle hint, guys. I totally guessed from this that the big, super-crazy reveal might be them getting off the island, because? What's the one thing that cannot happen on a show about people stranded on an island? Oh yeah, they GET RESCUED. Plus all the hints -- Jack's futuristic phone in the 'flashback', all that stuff about what he'd 'been through', how everyone kept calling him a 'hero - twice over'. (gag) Plus, I totally called that Kate had something to do with it. At first, I thought he read in the paper of her execution, and that's why he was all upset, then I thought that the woman in the car crash was her, then I went back to being convinced that it was her in the coffin. (WHO WAS THAT??? It has to be Locke. Or Ben.) So I was glad she wasn't dead. But way to mess things up, Jack. When will you learn that you are ALWAYS WRONG. ALWAYS. I bet everyone's lives back in the real world suck big time. And now I know why everyone's had different hairdos on the talk shows that last two weeks. But I am sorely disappointed that it doesn't seem to have anything to do with parallel universes, or time travel, or anything like that.

I'm SOOOO glad Sayid didn't die. I thought for sure he was a goner. Yay, awesome Sayid!

But CHARLIE!!! NOOOO!!! ;_____________; Although, I'm not really surprised, after last week's tragic-hero flashbacks. I'd sort of resigned myself to the fact. And at least he got an heroic death. I thought he was writing 'Tell Claire I love her' on his hand, so when it turned out to be 'Not Penny's ship', I got all misty-eyed as his last action was helping the rest of the Losties. So between that and the Tragic Death Music, I was having trouble keeping it together.

And speaking of such things, OMG, WHY WILL PATCHY NOT DIE????

HURLEY FTW! When Sawyer told him to go back, I totally called it that he would save the day somehow, so it was extra-awesome when he came charging in in the Dharma van.

Naomi's ""I am not alone"" = Walt? OMG, what if that freighter was Widmore looking for the island, and they came across Walt & Michael's boat? But I'm confused as to what Penelope has to do with all this.

WHOSE FUNERAL? IS KATE WITH SAWYER? DO THEY HAVE A BABY? IS JACK'S DAD REALLY ALIVE, OR IS JACK JUST EXTRA-SUPER CRAZY??? OMFG, HOW THE HELL CAN THEY GET OFF THE ISLAND IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SHOW? WILL THEY GO BACK NEXT SEASON? ALL OF THEM? HOW WILL JACK CONVINCE EVERYONE TO GO BACK? OR IS IT ALL JUST A BIG FAKE-OUT AND THEY WILL STAY ON THE ISLAND BUT WE WILL GET FLASH-FORWARDS INSTEAD OF -BACKS FROM NOW ON??? THERE'S SO MANY ISLAND MYSTERIES STILL TO SOLVE!!!!! I DON'T WANT THEM TO BE BACK IN THE BORING REAL WORLD........


HOW CAN THEY BE RESCUED????????????????????????? AND MORE IMPORTANTLY, HOW THE HELL CAN I WAIT UNTIL NEXT FRAKKING FEBRUARY TO FIND OUT??????

More later, when I've processed it all.

PS- Is it wrong that I didn't totally hate suicidal, alcoholic, drug-addict  beardy Jack? (Although, I kind of wanted Locke to shoot shouty leader Jack, WHO WOULD HAVE KILLED SAYID, JIN, AND BERNARD, DAMN HIM!!!!"

<lj-cut text=""Liar, liar, pants on fire, BENRY"">

OMGOMGOMGOMG, I can't believe it! I may say this all the time, but this time I really mean it: that HAS to be the most shocking end of a <i>Lost</i> episode, EVER. I TOTALLY did not see that coming, and I am seriously shaken by it.  I mean, the 'you're all dead' ending a couple weeks ago was a great bit of WTFery, but for pure dramatic shock value, nothing tops this. The closest would be Michael killing Ana Lucia & Libby last year, but I NEVER thought they'd kill LOCKE. Although...

Instant crazy theory of the week: Locke will be 'reborn'. Last week I said I thought he resembled Jesus carrying the cross (& thus, in hindsight, going to his death.) And goodness knows, this show has more than its fair share of Christ imagery. (& his mother's claim that he was 'immaculately conceived') We have only just seen a character return from the dead, and renewed evidence of the Island's miraculous healing powers with Naomi. The Island has already magically healed Locke once. It seems as though the Island can only heal if there's no interference (Mikail had to remove the branch from Naomi) but Locke was shot at close range; could the bullet have gone right through him? I'm thinking that we won't see him for a while, but he'll make a return, either at the end of the season finale, or next season. Evidence against? Well, Locke HAD just started being totally awesome again, and when people start being totally awesome, it's usually a sign of their impeding doom. And, well, Damon & Carlton DID say that once people were dead, they were really and truly dead. (until the zombie season!) And I was convinced that Libby would make a miraculous recovery too, but she snuffed it in the next episode. But, of course, Locke is a much more important character. And he seems to be the only one who can work the Island's magic. But, now that we know how he ended up in the wheelchair, is there much more of his story to tell, in flashbacks? But, that doesn't seem to have stopped them with Jack, or arguably many other characters as well...

Okay, enough of this debate. Moving on...

BEN. Wow, he really is well and truly EEEVIL. The more we've seen of him this season, the less threatening he's become. But now we see that not only did he murder his own father, he collaborated in the murder of dozens more innocent people, all to...get back at his BadDad? When  they were sitting in the van, I totally called it that he would off his father, but I did not see the Dharma genocide coming. So that was the purge Mikail told us about, with the help of Ben, killed all the Dharmites, and moved in. Eventually, it seems, they became the people they killed, and then had a group of 'hostiles' of their own to deal with in our Losties. And now the  Losties are planning a little purge of their own... The pigs are walking, indeed. But, as usual, more questions raised: did anyone else survive the purge? I wouldn't be surprised if there's a rebel group living in the hills, or somesuch. And what about Annie? Was she killed off too? Or will she magically appear at some point? How did Ben become leader? I'm guessing he was fairly young when all that went down (20?) and Alpert seemed to be the Hostile's leader. Who were the Hostiles in the first place? Obviously not the native inhabitants of the Island; they dressed in the same ragged 'dress up' clothes the Others used, but Richard was clean shaven, and wore an expensive-looking watch. Was that hut where they used to live? What happened in the intervening years? Was Ben's mother Smokey? Richard seemed very interested in weather she'd on the island or off... ARGH! SO MANY QUESTIONS! But poor little <strike>Harry</strike> Ben. I did feel bad for him, with no mother and his crap father. Speaking of which, interesting that he had such a lowly father, especially in contrast to so many of the Losties having rich and powerful fathers.

More thoughts about Ben:

-He is SUCH a liar. The Psych! opening totally got me, as they always do. I wonder what it is with Portland and the Others... So his mother died in childbirth, just like his Biblical namesake's. But I was kind of hoping that he and Locke would be twins, or at least brothers...

-Ben's story had very interestng echoes of Kate - childhood best friend in love with, who gives present of great emotional value; goes home to drunken awful father & removes shoes; kills father

- His mother has the same name as Locke's: Emily

-Interesting parallel between Ben's killing of his father in order to join the hostiles, and Locke's inability to kill his father in order to join the Others. It really drives home the point that Locke is the 'anti-Ben': the good to Ben's evil, the white to his black. The Island healed Locke and made him walk again; it sickened Ben and left him crippled. How can a parallel this interesting be left unexplored? Locke has to live.

-The Dharma caste system - a bit unusual for a 'utopian society', no? Ben's father was a 'Work Man', so Ben becomes one too. And the way everyone's job title was embroidered right beneath their name on all their clothes.

-Ben's father being Roger Workman: LMFAO!!! After his badge was shown in the preview last week, I said, half-joking, 'just watch -- Roger will turn out to be Ben's father.' And then he did! Every time I saw him in his uniform, I LOLed. And who would have guessed that 'Tricia Tanaka Is Dead', The Happiest Lost Episode Ever, would have foreshadowed such a grim and pivotal event?

-Little Ben's pet bunny!!! I LOLed. And he carried it in a messenger bag too.

Damnit, Juliet & Jack <i>are</i> good...I think. It looks like the Others <i>are</i> turning against Ben. I thought last week that Richard giving Locke Sawyer's folder so Sawyer would kill Cooper was all part of Ben's master manipulation plan, but now it looks as though Ben DIDN'T want Locke to kill Cooper after all; he really did want to discredit him as he saw him as a threat to his power. And Juliet's flashcard video, which I'd doubted all along also seems to be real too. And, it seems that Ben really didn't want Locke to take that tape -- but then why was he so sloppy and obvious with it? Did he just really underestimate Locke, and believe that he truly was 'One of Them' now? At any rate, it seems that Ben is getting verrry desperate, and things are really falling apart for him. He is rapidly becoming more dangerous, and less Evil-Mastermind-like with the overly-elaborate schemes. Damn, damn, damn. I hate it when Jack is right.

Random theory: Jack and Juliet were off recruiting Rousseau! That's why she came to get the dynamite!

JACOB: WTF??? What was going on in that cabin? I was thinking that Ben was making him up when he started talking to the empty chair, but then there was all that crazy poltergeist stuff: was it all a show that Ben had rigged up, just in case? Or that someone else had rigged up to fool Ben? Or was it real? Because it seemed a little...lame. Like out of Scooby-Doo or something. At any rate, Ben was reeeaaalllly bringing the crazy in that scene: I think he believes Jacob is real. But what's gotten into Locke that he's suddenly laughing in Ben's face? All this kind of stuff seems like exactly what he would have been worshipping before. I wonder if something happened to him in the hatch implosion, to give him a deeper knowledge of the Island. Hopefully he will come back from the dead to let us know? And even though I'm sure many people will be crying foul that the big reveal of Jacob was that he is the Invisible Man, I am glad that he wasn't just someone we've already seen walking round the Island, like Jack's dad or something. And I never bought into the whole 'Richard Alpert is Jacob' theory.

WHY DOESN'T RICHARD ALPERT SEEM TO AGE??????

Volcano - mentioned in school, then was that the river of ash Locke & Ben crossed? Might this be what wiped out the original inhabitants, the ones who built the ruins and the statue?

The Hostiles killing the Dharmites with the gas cannisters. Surely this wasn't the same gas that they used on Kate and Jack? Because it seemed to kill them instantly. And Kate and Jack aren't dead. (Or <i>are they</i>?) Looking back though, that scene where they don gas masks and exit from the village does seem like a creepy reversal of the way they arrived there. At any rate, I <i>really</i> want to know what's going on with this whole 'You're all dead' business.</lj-cut>

SUCH a good episode, so much to think about. I think it was the perfect ratio of questions to answers. How can the episodes just keep getting better and better like this? Although, this week's was great in  a very different way to last week's grown-up drama that was almost like a stand-alone play. (If I was in charge of picking an Emmy episode to submit, ""The Brig"" would be it.) This week was more <i>Lost</i> at its WTF, crazy-Island, vaguely-supernatural, mythological best. Both: A++"

"event","Just finished watching ""The Brig"" for the second time...

First of all, WOW. <i>Lost</i> is really on an awesome streak at the moment; each episode is even better than the last. And this one...it was just so dense with references and symbolism, while still being all about the characters of Locke and Sawyer, and furthering the plot, all at the same time. I know a lot of people make fun of Damon and Carlton, but I really don't think there can be any disputing their talent as writers. I've always thought that one of the best-written and most well-constructed epidsodes of <i>Lost</i> is 'Deus Ex Machina', the first one they wrote together, but 'The Brig' has to rank right up there. (Interestingly, they've written the majority of the Locke episodes, but the upcoming finale will be their first Jack episode, except for the Season 2 & 3 premieres, which Damon wrote seemingly as a matter of course.) And backing up that brilliant writing was some absolutely wonderful acting -- Josh Holloway has really just shone this season, I hope he's up for the Emmy come September; Terry O'Quinn & Michael Emerson are reliably fantastic as ever -- and some good directing as well.

That final scene with Sawyer and Cooper...there are no words. I was so emotionally involved, I didn't know whether I wanted Sawyer to kill him because he's so obviously the biggest bastard ever in the history of the world, or to forgive him instead. But in the end I was glad he killed him, because I don't want Sawyer to come to terms with his past, which of course = death on Craphole Island. But the obvious emotional toll it took on Sawyer was heartbreaking. The confrontation came at the worst possible time for him: he was finally starting to allow himself to relax and be a nice guy, to let himself be vulnerable, instead of being a dickhead all the time to protect himself. And, just when he's let his defences down, his past blindsides him. So I'm guess no more Mister Nice <strike>Gaius</strike> Sawyer for a while. Which I'm fine with. I'm totally fine with pretty much anything as long as they don't kill him off. Plus, it would be awesome if he told Kate to just smarten up and get the hell over Jack.

Speaking of Kate...STFU, Kate. It's like anytime she's within a hundred meters of Jack she becomes this annoying, submissive, desperate, needy, suckup. Sigh. She's so much better when she's far away from Jack and goes back to being all kick-ass and awesome. If only Jack is one of the ones to die in the finale. But I'm sure it will instead be someone totally awesome, like Sayid.

And speaking of Jack... I finally realised what's been different about him since he got back from Otherville: he's been Otherised. Gone are his crazy eyes, his Jackfaces, his shouting fits over nothing every episode, his over-reactions to everything, his charging off on thoughtless missions doomed to failure. Instead, he has the eriely calm demeanor all the Others have, with a friendly though unemotional response when people talk to him. Ooooh, I do hope he's been brainwashed or converted or SOMETHING interesting, because if he's still just regular old Jack, biding his time until he can put another stupid-ass plan into action? So, so lame, like: ha-ha! You, viewers, fell for Jack's Other act just like the simple, unsuspecting Losties did. They distrusted him, and they paid the price. It's just as well Super!Jack is a forgiving man, and has come to the rescue of all and sundry. Blargh. BUT, how happy am I that all the Losties (well, except, apparently, Kate) no longer trust him, and have finally seen the light and put their faith in Sayid. YES. Desmond is not only hot, he's also smart.

As for Locke...interesting how, after being conned all his life, he manages to manipulate Sawyer into doing what he can't. He's obviously been watching Ben closely and taking notes. Because, so much manipulation still going on there. The whole thing with the tape player was clearly staged by Ben: he wanted Locke to have it, but why? I wonder if he might want the Losties to come to them, and by learning of an imminent attack they will make a pre-emptive strike. I just adore how overly-dramatic all his plans are: Cooper tied to a massive pillar? I was expecting Kong to appear out of the jungle and scoop him up. And there was a noticable lack of guns: Ben has taken Locke's words to heart -- though Sawyer's was conveniently out of bullets, forcing a much more dramatic and symbolic kill. And Locke struggling through the jungle at the end, under the weight of his father's body: I got a distinct 'Jesus bearing the cross' vibe from that shot.

So, Cooper thinks they're in Hell? (Although, a pirate ship in the middle of the jungle sounds more like Disneyland than Hell to me :P) Makes sense: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUEIRVHlFp0"">'We know ALL your sins...'</a>(And doesn't this sound just like Benry? <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqRRvxIQ7DM"">'Ah, my ridiculously circuitous plan is one-quarter complete...'</a>) Although, seriously, while I'm (pretty) sure it's not Hell, this is the second recent conspicuous statement that the Island is not what they think. Not to mention the 4,815,162,342 various other hints. I really have no idea where they're going with this, but I'm def enjoying the ride.

CAN'T WAIT FOR NEXT WEEK, OMFG!!! BENRY FLASHBACK!!! WHO IS JACOB??? (I think it's really Benry, he just made Jacob up to keep his minions in line) And I can't wait for Juliet to be revealed as the mole she is..."

LMAO! Unfortunately, the other girl in my office who watches <i>The Office</i> isn't in today, so no-one else thought it was really that funny when I explained why I was laughing.

Then I got to the fax from the D.O.C. -- no, not 'Date Of Conception', but 'Department of Corrections'.
 
And -- when I went to the cafe next door for lunch, the first thing I hear when I walk in the door is a Scottish accent saying 'Celtic has the ball...'. Lord knows why that was on the tv here, but it certainly made me do a double take. Unfortuately, there were no hot Scottish guys who are so preoccupied with their visions of the future that they forget to button their shirts anywhere to be found. :(

To cap it all off, when I was just watching <i>The Office</i>, I sudddenly gained much sympathy for Angela. Why? When she was sentenced to training with Kelly, and then we cut to the talking heads --

Kelly: This day is bananas, B-A-N-A-N-A-S. This day is bananas, B-A-N-A-N-A-S.
*Angela gulps a handful of asprin*
Angela: No, I don't have a headache. I'm just preparing.

I had spent <i>all day</i> sitting next to our office's very own Kelly. I wish I was joking or exaggerating, but alas I'm not. Apart from a slight heightening of her personality for tv-comedy purposes, she's the same. Singing annoying songs to herself? Check. Talking nonsense in bad English accents? Check. Baby talk? Check. Not shutting up about her desperate quest for a husband? Check. She's not a bad person, so I don't want to hate her, but the days I have to sit next to her are very long days indeed. To keep from going insane, I've taken to making Jim faces at an invisible camera when no-one's looking. ...Wait, did I say 'keep from going insane?' because I think it might be too late."

If that's not proof that I should be writing for Lost, I don't know what is.

But speaking of that ending: CLASSIC. One of the best ever. <lj-cut text=""OMGWTFPOLARBEAR"">

First: afnljfna;rnv['2ef4inv;RKFJDLFJKA;EJV.N/kdwmclvkj LOST HAS TAKEN WTF-ery TO ALL NEW AND AWESOME LEVELS

Next: 

-I just have to say this: <i>Lost</i>, I love you. I am totally your bitch. I have always loved you, even through the mini-season when people were jumping ship left right and centre. BUT, you need to FREAKING LET ME KNOW WHO TO TRUST! Is Naomi a lying liar who lies and working for the Others/Dharma/whatever else crazy group is running round this island? Or is she telling the truth, and was sent by Penny to find Desmond? But okay, I'll give her a break as she only has had like 2 lines so far. But Juliet, I was loving your ambiguity, but it is starting to grate on my nerves just a bit. I can't believe anything you say, and it's starting to get old.

-I WAS RIGHT ABOUT KATE!!! (possibly) And the Others did totally have a plan all along for her to get pregnant thanks to the Island's SuperSperm. I'm just glad she said Sawyer's name first so we didn't have to watch Jex. YES. I knew the Others had to want her and Sawyer for something more than just to manipulate Jack. BUT...I don't want Kate to be pregnant, cause like I said before, how lame is it if ALL the women are pregnant?

-There might as well have been a flashing 'Caution!' sign at the bottom of the screen when Juliet was all, 'I just have to go back into the hatch alone, to, um...make sure we didn't forget anything. Yeah, that's a good reason, right?' So no surprise there that the whole thing's a huge setup and she's leaving reports for Ben.

-Desmond letting Patchy go because he 'gave his word'. Where have we heard that before? OH I KNOW, BENRY SAYS IT ALL THE TIME. I mean, not that I think Desmond's an Other or anything, but interesting choice of words all the same. I guess it could just be him trying to be noble and all that, as we know from flashbacks that he's cowardly and never sees things through and all of that, so maybe know he's just over-compensating-- but I'm sure he'll pay for that later.

-I'm loving how everyone's all suspicious of Jack now. HOWEVER, this probably means that he isn't working for the Others, as that's just the way <i>Lost</i> likes to play things.

-We now have two characters with their own impending deaths hanging over their heads. Although, Sun's doesn't seem as urgent as Charlie's, because 2 months Island time=2 years show time.

-Jin's dad is the ONLY nice dad out of all the Losties', so of course he might not even be his real dad. (But his bitch mother makes up for his lovely dad in the Awful Parent department)

-Sun & Jin are joining Sayid on my Awesome Team. Jin for going all kung fu on Patchy, then being the only one smart enough to realise that he'd taken the phone (+ super-extra bonus points for his Korean ghost story last week); and Sun for being such a bitch to Juliet, & not taking any of her no-answers crap.

-Have the writers been reading the forums?  The Losties shared more info tonight than in all the other episodes put together. Kate and Claire telling Sun about the medical hatch; Charlie & Hurley revealing that Kate told them about The Flame, and Patchy, Kate telling Sun what Jack said about his time with the Others, and what Juliet said about pregnancies. At last, they're getting their act together-- and it only took 3 seasons.

-LOL at Hurley continuing to be the worst liar ever. Way to almost get the satellite phone stolen as soon as you found it.

-Also LOL at the secret Others room behind the wall that swung open when a lever was pulled. And in the same room where they keep their fake beards & Dharma Theatrical Glue, no less! The only thing that would've made it better was if Juliet pulled a book off a shelf, or leant against a candlestick to get it to open. Oh Others, I love how crazily theatrical you are. (+ bonus points to them for disappearing in a cloud of smoke in 'Left Behind')

-I loved Sun's flashback. It tied in pretty well with her island plot, and was so sad, how she was only trying to do the right thing because she loved Jin, but it totally ended up screwing them both over. Which, come to think of it, is the case for an awful lot of the Losties, particularly Kate.

-I'm liking how this is probably the first episode all season where both the A- and B-plots were really exciting and plot advancing. Because, awesome as I think <i>Lost </i> is, they could do with spreading the plot out a bit more evenly.

And now, back to the ending. The way I see it, these are the possibilities. (Given that D&C ruled out purgatory.)

1. Naomi's lying. (See above.)

2. The Others somehow...staged a fake plane crash? (I have no idea how even even they would pull this off.)

3. The crazy electro-magnetic energy around the Island somehow created a double of the plane as it was mid-crash. One plane crashed in the real world, and everyone died. The other crashed on the Magical Healing Island, and there were survivors.

4. Time Travel. The Island exists on a different timeline to the Real World. In that timeline, the plane crashed and everyone died. On the Island timeline, something happened differently, so there are survivors. But, 'The universe has a way of course-correcting.' They should all be dead, but aren't, hence why they all seem to be dying off. Possibly what caused the different timeline is Desmond not pushing the button. Maybe the plane was crashing anyway, but when he started the system failure, the electromagnet pulled the plane down to the island instead of it continuing on a bit further and just crashing in the middle of the ocean somewhere.

5. ???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????

Lastly: Next week's preview! Looks like the run of kick-ass eps continues! Locke's back! With more hare-brained schemes! Plus, I hear there's ANOTHER super-sized twist next week too. And the week after that: BenBack! Hooray! But: I hear lots of people are going to die before the end of the season? NOOOOOO. Sawyer, revert back to your dickhead ways at once. Sayid, find a plot, PLEASE. I fear for you, you are too kick-ass to get killed off.

Just as well this episode gave me something to think about, as work is even more super-boring than usual right now. Oh -- and because I'm in full-on nerd mode at the moment? <i>Battlestar Galactica</i> Season 2 marathon this weekend!"

"event","The moral of this week's episode: Sayid is always right. Jack is always wrong. Oh, how I wish Locke hadn't blown up that submarine so Jack could have left. (But, the look on Sawyer's face when Jack said that he had been going to leave, LOL) And Sayid is totally my hero, the way he lists all the things he wants Juliet to tell him -- basically, half the things the audience is dying to find out. Then Jack is all, 'Everyone is forbidden to ask Juliet any questions, on pain of death. I don't need to ask her any questions because I saw in her eyes that she wants to leave, and that is all I need to know, ever.' Argh, what a DUMBASS. I seriously hope he is working with Juliet and/or the Others in some way, or has been brainwashed, or SOMETHING, because otherwise he is just the stupidest person EVER. And supposedly we have to sit through ANOTHER of his flashbacks in a few weeks. It damn well better show what happened to him when he was with the Others, because I have no interest in sitting through the three millionth Jackback that has anything to do with his dad, his marriage, his super-surgeon-ness, or especially his tattoos. Unless it reveals that his dad is actually Jacob, or something like that.

Speaking of Jacob, he seems to have been upgraded from the Others' leader to their god. What with the way Ben spoke of him to Juliet, you could hear the capital-H 'He', and then all of the 'Do you doubt Jacob' business Ben was spouting. Creepier and creepier.

And speaking of creepy, it was must've been creepy guest-star theme night or something: Ethan! Richard Alpert! Patchy! Goodwin! (Oh Juliet, unmarried sex, that means you're due to be shot before the season finale...) The Others are honestly the creepiest group of people I've ever seen. I think Juliet has been practicing the patented Creepy Ben Stare in the mirror.

And Juliet. Juliet, Juliet, Juliet. I've been suspicious of you from the start. All of last week's episode, I totally though you were lying, that you had been 'left behind' on purpose, as a mole. Then, with your sympathetic back story this week, I forgot all about that, and was starting to think maybe you weren't so bad after all. But then, guess what, you are a mole after all! Well played, writers, well played.

SKATE!! The look on Sawyer's face when he saw that Kate was back safely! &hearts &hearts &hearts And the hug! I just melted...the way Sawyer (& Kate, but espcially Sawyer) closed his eyes...I just melted into a big pile of goo. (Oh, I am secretly so sickeningly sentimental.)

Oh, and my super-geeky easter egg and related theory of the week: on the tree where Juliet went to get the case of medicine, there was a wooden plaque with a mark carved into it. A mark that looked very much like the one Juliet had branded onto her back. I was suspicious of that whole trial business all along, and now I'm thinking that maybe that mark is the sign of the Others, and that maybe Juliet getting branded with it signified not being exiled from the group, but finally becoming a fully-fledged member of them. Or was that all for real, and she's just pulling a Michael, doing whatever it takes to get off the island? At any rate, I hope we haven't seen the last flashback about her three years with the Others.

Bonus second super-geeky theory: The 'implant' the Others put in Claire: is <i>this</i> at last the source of the mysterious 'sickness'? And, when Jack, Kate, and Sawyer had bandaids on their arms in ATOTC, had they perhaps been implanted with them as well?

And going back to the Golden Triangle's stay in Otherville, what with all the pregnancy talk in this episode, and last week's Kateback, where she unknowingly teams with Sawyer's pregnant ex-girlfriend, I'm wondering if Kate might be pregnant too. I really hope not, because I tend to think that that would sideline her from all the actiony goings-on, and how lame would it be to have all of the women pregnant or have babies to look after.

Line of the week - Juliet: ""I had the day off.""

AND OMFG, the trailer for next week (and, I presume, the next few weeks as well). HOW FRAKKING AMAZING DOES THAT LOOK!!!!! Was that a helicopter I heard? Does Penny FINALLY show up after the whole season? Are Kate and Sawyer having sex again? (Please use protection, kids) Was that Claire hanging from a tree? Is that Sawyer trying to kill Locke? Does Sawyer find out that Locke's daddy is Real!Sawyer? Is someone trying to kill Jin? Is Juliet trying to turn the Losties against each other? What is that ruin-y looking place? Is that where the Others disappeared to? That Epic Trailer Music, while a huge cliche now, makes everything look unbelievably exciting and brilliant, so please, please, please evil ABC promo monkeys, do not trick me again. BUT I have high hopes, as according to TV.com, there is a Dharma episode in a month called ""The Man Behind the Curtain"", AND the finale will finally be the long-awaited BENRY FLASHBACK! HURRAY! And it will be called ""Through the Looking Glass"". So assuming that that info is correct, I don't see how those episodes can lose: awesome titles + awesome flashback subjects = Made of awesomeness.

 So yes. <i>Lost</i> is back, everyone. Back with a vengence. Not that I thought it ever went anywhere, but I was in the minority. (Okay, maybe it went out to lunch or something for ""Stranger in a Strange Land"".) And now I must go to bed, because I have to get up for work in six hours."

"event","Before I get to the main point of my entry, I just want to say: Holy. Frack. I finally decided to see what all the hype was about and watch <i>Battlestar Galactica</i>. I've had a Season 1 marathon this long weekend, just finished 'Kobol's Last Gleaming, Part 2' two minutes ago, and I am officially hooked. Commander Adama staged a coup then was shot by Boomer who just found out she is a Cylon! Dr Gaius has a Cylon baby! Apollo realised that as a central male character of a television drama series he really ought to have more Daddy Issues, and betrayed his father! Various other exciting things are happening back on Caprica involving Starbuck kicking Cylon ass and pregnant Cylons and prophetic arrows that may save humanity from extinction! And back on mythical Earth, I apparently can't get hooked on a t.v. show that I can talk about without sounding like the world's biggest nerd! (More on this later.)

Right. Now that I've gotten that somewhat out of my system, on to what I was originally going to say. Which is totally unrelated, and is: sometime back around October/November, I had one of my periodic panics about my life going nowhere, and there I was arsing around Australia spending all my hard-earned savings, and where I nothing I did really mattered in the long run because my visa expired in a few months anyways. So after doing a lot of research for probably the first time ever, I came up with a plan. My plan was basically, Be Kind, Rewind. I would head back home, with a week or two's holiday in London and Edinburgh on the way, get my old job back, and sign up for night classes at a local university so as to actually get some sort of qualification that might be somewhat useful when it came to getting a real job.

And what do you know. <i>That</i> plan, out of all my plans -- was a success. <lj-cut text=""Blah blah blah, angstcakes.""> Perhaps a little too much so.  Once I set things in motion, evrything just fell into place. I wrote a tenative email to my old boss to see what the situation there was, and she wrote back to say that just that very day put out an ad to hire a new person, and that I was more than welcome back. I changed my flight to London to late January, and after Christmas I told I my Australian job and my landlady that I was leaving. I got in touch with the English relatives and arranged to stay with them. I got in touch with my friend in Edinbrgh, and arranged to visit her. I booked the train up to Edinburgh, and my flight home from London and before I knew what was going on, everything was set in motion, and it was too late to change my mind.

I was able to continue in my Australian job until a few days before I left, so I had lots of money, and I tried to make the most of time I had left in Melbourne to do all the things that I'd been meaning to do. (Though I did have an absolutely wonderful and useless Christmas week when I was on holiday, and the weather was awful so I stayed inside, sitting by the heater eating decadent Christmas food and working my way through Season 2 of <i>Lost</i> and <i>House</i>, only venturing out to see about 4 or 5 movies in less than a week.)

But then all of a sudden it was the day I was leaving, a beautiful warm sunny day in January, and I was walking to the post office in the morning, and all I could think of was how much I didn't want to leave. Because while Australia had been tough going, there had been a lot more good moments than bad, and I finally felt as though I was getting somewhere. I just had to keep reminding myself that it would all have been over in a few months in any case.

So off I flew to London, where I had an absolutely wonderful almost-two weeks there and in Edinburgh, getting to pretend I was a student again. (only this time with money!) Back down in London, I treated myself to a luxury hotel (which I got for 1/4 of the real price!) and three shows in two days. I ate lunch outside in Covent Garden, and shopped til I dropped (much to my later regret when it came time to weigh my suitcase at the airport).</lj-cut>

And then...and then I was back home, and back to work two days later, and before the end of the week it was like I had never left. Just like I had wanted. Only now, a large part of me wished I was back in sunny Australia, working for the proper company that paid better, and going sightseeing on the weekends, and all the problems were completely forgotten. As usual, Oscar Wilde got it right when he said, 'There are only two tragedies in life. One is not getting what one wants; the other is getting it.'"

"event","...well, technically it's the equivilant of June in the Northern Hemisphere, but as 'Christmas in June' isn't a saying, I'm going with 'July'.

Anyways, my point is that <i>this is so weird.</i> I mean, here it is, 7pm on Christmas Eve, and not only is it still light out, I'm wearing a short-sleeved top and sandals, spent an hour earlier sitting outside reading-- and it's actually a 'cold day' (ie, somewhere around 20). I was actually hoping for a really hot Christmas Day just for the contrast of it, but it's apparently going to be the coldest for 60 years. Typical. 

So, needless to say, it doesn't feel the slightest bit like Christmas. After a failed attempt at the beginning of the month to feel Christmas-y, I gave up, but yesterday I decided to give it another go, as I was officially on a week's holidays. Oh-- and the office Christmas party on Friday? A picnic! Luckily there are several English people who work there as well, so I wasn't the only one excited about the novelty of it all. Though as Friday was a really hot day, and everyone was doing random bits of work in a mad rush to finish everything up, it totally had a 'last day of school' feel to it, which I guess is at least a holiday of sorts. Anyways, yesterday I headed into the city to do my Christmas shopping (last-minute as ever) & had a lovely time wandering through all the fantastic arcades. After I'd actually managed to find some nice presents, I thought I would brave the ignomity of Starbucks in Australia to have my annual Eggnog Latte. Only to find that they don't actually make them here, which seems a bit dumb. I suppose it's because Australians (well, Melbournians at least) are such dreadful coffee snobs. It can't be because they don't have eggnog here-- I know they do because I've seen in in the supermarket. Anyways, I settled for a Peppermint something-or-other Frappucino, and sat outside in the sun drinking it, looking at the huge Christmas tree & listening to a band somewhere play Christmas music. It was all very surreal. You know, even though Australia's pretty much as far away as you can get, it really doesn't feel that way-- except for moments like that. But on the whole, Australia doesn't seem to go in for Christmas as much as the northern countries, I'm guessing because it sort of blends with summer. I've hardly heard any Christmas music, decorations seem to be largely a token effort, and there's only been a couple Christmas movies on TV. It's all a bit disappointing, really, cause Christmas is usually a highlight of the year, and such a big, exciting event.

So tonight, instead of the traditional port & mince pies by the fire with Christmas carols playing, I'm going out for drinks with J and some friends. Not very Christmas-y, but should hopefully be a nice night out. Then tomorrow I'm going round for Christmas lunch with her extended family, which I'm very glad they took pity on me & invited me to, as Christmas dinner by myself would be sadder than sad indeed. So that at least should be Christmas-y, as they have a real Christmas tree, and hopefully also crackers and Chrismas pud and all of that. And I will finally get to open my pressies in the morning, which arrived from my parents 6 weeks ago, and have been sitting, faithfully unopened, on my bookshelf ever since. (can you <i>believe</i> how good I was not to have cheated, esp considering no-one would ever have known if I'd opened them early?) I just hope that the big parcel is big enough to be both DVDs of <i>Lost</i> and <i>House</i> seasons 2. Because I've been looking forward to some Christmas Day viewing of season 2 <i>Lost</i> eps for ages now, and purposefully timed my rewatching of season 1 of both shows to finsh this week. But I'm sure Mum & Dad came through for me."

"event","And, it seems that after five loooong years, he's finally going ahead with a new movie, called...drumroll, please...<i><a href=""http://www.smh.com.au/news/film/epic-begins-to-take-shape/2006/11/22/1163871482069.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap1"">Australia</a></i>...

...would you like some wine to go with that <strike>cheese</strike> <a href=""http://www.smh.com.au/news/film/corn-of-a-new-era/2006/07/16/1152988404933.html"">corn</a>, Baz?

Seriously, though, when I first heard him say that, my immediate thought was that he was joking. Then he went into one of his famous explanations, and he's almost won me over - because, my God, if ever there was someone who could sell his ideas, it's Baz. I mean, I understand where he's coming from with this title - film history, metaphor, grand scale, etc. - but I'm just picturing myself at the box office opening night, going 'one ticket for <i>Australia</i> please,' and the clueless teenager working there going, 'um, the travel agent's two shops down on the left.' Oh, who am I kidding? By next week I'll be passionately defending it to friends & family, with a dozen good reasons why it's completely perfect & utterly genius.

But, wait a minute: '<i>heard</i> him say?' I (don't) hear you asking? How did this come about? Well, for once in my life I was watching tv at the right moment. This very am, as I glumly ate breakfast with the morning show chattering inanely away unheeded on the telly, I happened to glance up as the words 'latest Australian epic' were scrolling off the bottom of the screen. 'Surely they couldn't mean Baz will be on?' I thought. But, they did! And, even better, he would be on at 8:10, meaning I would have just enough time to watch before I had to leave for work. After I recovered from choking on my museli, I got ready in record time, so as to be perched on the edge of my seat by 8:10, super-excited be watching what must be a world exclusive. I spent all day thinking about how lucky I was to be in Australia, because surely I would never get to see this back in Canada - only to arrive home, and find the interview posted, in its entirety, on Nine's website. <a href=""http://ninemsn.video.msn.com/v/en-au/v.htm?g=538fe4b7-d1bc-4df6-aec5-e5bad9a88221&f=39&fg=copy"">Damn.</a>

Some more thoughts:

1. I love Australia - check out those identifiers (or whatever the actual term is) on the screen: 'Oscar-nominated Director' and 'Legendary Director'. They even corrected history so Baz got what he deserved.

2. Blunnies! Hee, Baz wearing Blundstone boots with his suit totally cracked me up. Obviously he wore them to accentuate his 'Australian-ness', in the rugged outback sense, but worn with a suit, and while sitting for a television interview, they carried the slightest whiff of pretentiousness with them. (And, to accentuate his 'artiness', the unbuttoned collar & loosened tie.) Don't worry Baz, I love you for always looking the part.

3. Who is this mysterious third actor? I've been wracking my brain all day. I assume he'll play the third corner in the love triangle I've read about, which would put him age-wise in his 30s to 40s. He's Australian. And it sounds like he's well-known. Russell's out, obviously. There've been rumours of Heath Ledger, but he was supposed to be out as well - and, he seems perhaps slightly young? I just wish we knew more about the plot. It sounds like the husband might not be dead after all, or maybe like he dies at the cattle station? Because he would make an obvious third corner: the uptight, upper-class Englishman, representing the past. Fair, and with a finer build to contrast with Hugh, he would be a bit of a dandy perhaps, and completely out-of-touch with the land, thinking himself, and English society far superior. But then maybe there'll be more of an actual emotional choice involved for Nicole's character, with both men having both virtues and flaws. Oh, I don't know. All I know is that it sounds awesome, and I can't wait. Though of course I'll have to-- filming for 5 months starting in March takes until August, so odds of a Christmas 2007 release seem slim to none. Summer 2008 is possible, but I'm hoping the studio will see this as a prime Oscar contender, and thus hold onto it until the autumn, so my guess for a release date is... November 2008?! Sigh. It's already been over 5 years since <i>MR</i>, and I was just thinking the other day that it was this time <i>ten</i> years ago that I went to see <i>R + J</i>. I know genius takes time, but this is getting ridiculous!

4. 'The Chanel commercial's been getting a real flogging lately.' HAS IT? WHERE? Why is there a global conspiracy to prevent me from seeing the damn thing anywhere other than <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj7s90v2gAw&mode=related&search="">YouTube</a>? (Swoon. Oh Rodrigo, why must you be so useless & annoying on <i>Lost</i>?) I had hopes last weekend when I went to see <i>The Prestige</i>, as I've noticed new Chanel No. 5 print ads with Nicole, and that seemed like the sort of film they might show it before, but no such luck. Also, interesting, how Baz seemed to go on the defensive about the cost of it, and then was quick to switch to talking about benefits to the Australian film industry. It seemed as though he might've had a fair bit of criticism in that area, but I haven't really aware of any.

Anyways, I can only assume this completely unexpected (& somewhat random) appearance by Baz signals the official beginning of <strike>his new film</strike> *ahem*<i>Australia</i>, and hope that after years of nothingness, his <a href=""http://www.bazmark.com"">official site</a> will finally be open for business, perhaps with lots of behind-the-scenes goodies?"

The day of the biggest race is even a public holiday, about which I have to say: a) only in Australia would people be given a paid day off work to, basically, drink lots and gamble; and b) total genius! 

I ended up up going to Stakes Day, the last day of it all, but it turned out to be the best day to go, because the weather was absolutely gorgeous-- unlike Tuesday, the holiday, when it was absolutely freezing. It was all a bit last-minute, so I ended up having to go shopping after work on Friday to buy an outfit meaning I was rather limited in time & selection. Still, I decided to go all out, and damn the expense! (well, to an extent) I've been looking for an excuse to buy a nice dress for ages now, and I figured, how often do I get a chance to get really & truely frocked up? As a result, I actually was excited about shopping for the first time in a long time. I had lots of fun trying on dresses and turning piroettes in the fitting room to make the skirts twirl out. That is, until the zipper got stuck on one dress whilst I was trying to take it off, so I got stuck with it over my head for five minutes as I panicked and only managed to get the zipper more stuck. I managed to get it off eventually, of course, and funnily enough that's the one I ended up getting. (Well, not that <i>particular</i> one-- I snuck that one back onto the rack, and swapped it for one with a non-broken zipper) So I ended up with a gorgeous dress (that cost way too much money), fabulous shoes, a cute little clutch, a necklace, and, to top it all off, a veddy proper hat! These are the posh people's races, you see, and that's what one wears. I felt pretty funny sitting there on the train dressed up like that though! (oh dear - could this paragraph sound any ditzier?)

Anywho, the races themselves were heaps of fun. We drank champagne, ate sushi, and lost money betting on the losing horses. (well, I did. S got to shout and jump up and down as his horse came from behind to win.) I didn't really care though, I was just thrilled to be there. (lol, really!) I mean, this is just the sort of thing that I read about in newspapers or magazines and wish I could go to, but never get the chance. 

Well, after that glimpse of how the other half lives, it came as a rather unpleasant shock on Monday morning to be rudely awoken by my alarm and have to get up, put on boring work clothes, bolt my breakfast, and run for the train in the rain. I was in a foul mood all day, completely hating work, and seriously ready to throw in the towel. Today, however, I was feeling very much improved-- helped, too, by getting to have free fancy cake in the afternoon as it was someone's birthday at work, and also by the fact that I was trusted enough to take the company car (!) and go to the bank by myself. Okay, so I got a bit lost on the way (<i>quel suprise</i>) and by the time I actually got there the bank was shut, but at least I managed not to crash the car. I was a bit nervous, what with still not being entirely comfortable with the spatial relations of driving on the left, and not having driven at all since July, but I managed all right. I even managed not to turn the bloody windshield wipers on every time I went to signal for a turn.

So, lesson of the day: much like school, work is immeasurably improved by cake and a field trip."

"event","...Spell it any other way, and it's just not funny. Case in point:

Just finished watching HL on SNL, which makes me want to go pop in my <i>BOFL</i> DVD to watch Hugh's comic genius actually be put to good use. Oh sure, there were were <i>some</i> funny bits-- I did enjoy the monologue. I'm almost certain Hugh wrote most of that, and in his delivery there was more than a little of his old <i>BOFL</i> persona. The map was a particularly good touch, I thought, that got the loudest laugh from me. I'd like to think he didn't have too much input into the rest of the sketches, though, as they weren't especially funny. (Although I'm sure he gave them some help-- how else would a word like 'peccadilloes' end up in there?) Must admit though, I did get a bit of a giggle from the 'Most Haunted' sketch. Fart jokes-- now there's an English comedy favourite he forgot to mention in the monologue. Also cross-dressing. Can't have an English comedy show without a man in a frock. And really, that's the only thing that kept me awake during that scene. ('Humina-humina,' she said while maintaining eye contact with his <strike>legs</strike> fake, lopsided breasts), which was dreadful, apart from the bit at the end about handsome tv doctors. (hee!) Enjoyed the protest song <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR3pJ5dD6fs"">again</a>, though I got the feeling that most of the audience just thought he'd forgotten the words, which was a bit embarassing. And the final sketch would've benefitted greatly from extensive use of the word 'damn', heavy drinking, and many references to someone named Marjorie.

Anywho, enough about that-- I've got to get to bed, since I've got work again tomorrow. (groan) I was only supposed to be in for 2 days last week, but everyday they ask me to come in again tomorrow. Still, mustn't complain, it's nice to have money again, and it's better for my mental health to feel somewhat useful. And hey, I had reception duty today, which I managed to survive, so after that going back to non terror-inducing work should be a treat, right? Actually, it wasn't so bad-- I had worked myself up for a day of staring at the phone out of the corner of my eye, thinking 'don't ring, don't ring, don't ring...' all day, but I hardly had to answer the phone at all. So really, the worst part of my day is getting up. Once I'm out of the house & plugged into my iPod, I'm in quite a good mood.

Speaking of good moods & iPods (& Hugh Laurie, of course): <i>House</i> returns tomorrow! Huzzah!"

"event","Well, I have finally gotten a better temporary job, only to immediately start loathing having to get up early, and wishing that I could go back to being unemployed and bored. I don't know what it is about me, but whatever I have, I always want the opposite. I know that as soon as I don't have a job to go to, I'll go right back to wishing I did. So what do I want?!

Anyways, I'm back at the second job I had here, so obviously the only reason I got it was because I'd been there before. Sigh-- even with temp work, it seems that it's not what you know, but who you know. They originally wanted me only for Tues & Weds, which I thought sounded perfect: I'd earn enough to cover another week's expenses, but still have Thursday free to sleep in and watch <i>Lost</i> in the arvo whilst eating my new favourite lunch of a grilled cheese sandwich. These last two actions are now seemingly inextricably linked in my strange brain, due to the fact that I was really hungry when I watched the premiere of <i>Lost</i>, and so the grilled cheese that Juliet brought to Jack looked extra-good, with the result that once the ep had finished, I went and made myself one, and have eaten them for lunch every day since. (I have this weird thing where I always get cravings for whatever food people are eating in movies or tv shows. I once walked all over the city looking for a nice noodle place after watching a movie where the characters were eating noodles.) Anyway, the point of this extremely long digression is that when I was asked to stay on & work an extra day, the fact that I wouldn't get to do this flashed across my mind. Luckily, common sense (& greed) won out, so I ended up working Thursday, then Friday, and they've asked me to go back on Mon and Tues as well. I agreed, with inner reluctance. As long as I have Wed and Thurs free for the return of <i>House</i>, and <i>Lost</i> ;)

To be fair though, my dislike for working is not entirely (or even, I would like to think, mostly) due to television-related reasons, but mainly because the work is <i>so</i> mind-numbingly <i>boring</i>. I mean, I complained about my real job at home, but I also never woke up and didn't want to go to work, which is exactly what's happening every morning here. I guess it comes down to the fact that for all its problems, my real job had advantages as well. Nice people to talk to all day. Being able to spend large amounts of time checking my email, and reading about tv shows, movies, and other entirely un-work-related subjects on the internet. Paid lunches and longer-than-usual breaks. The truth is-- and I never thought I'd say this in a million years-- I really miss it. So much so that I'm seriously contemplating going back. That is, if they'll take me back. If only my replacement would quit in the new year, so I could go back and pick up where I left off. (With the addition of some night classes, so I could get a better job at some point. Because, whilst I'm nostalgic, I'm not completely deluded.)

In the mean time, I'll just go back to trying to figure out the time difference right now (daylight savings has me extra-confused) so I'll know when I'll be able to watch Hugh Laurie on SNL. And hope that they let him write some scenes, because the last time I tuned into SNL it was so dismally unfunny it was embarassing. And I hate having to watch actors I like do unintentionally embarassing things. I just hope they don't make his monologue all about how 'Guess what?! He's actually English!!!! OMGWTFPolarbear!!' Because that got old about 2 years ago. On the plus side, he's apparently both singing AND 'dragging up', which would seem to bode well."

"event","...okay, so this time I'm <i>totally serious</i> about going back to updating my LJ at least semi-regularly...

Well, we'll see how we go. I am, at least, back to being unemployed, with my own internet-enabled computer, which is a step in the right direction. Or, not. But hey, at least I'm bored, unemployed and poor in an exotic foreign country!

So, this Australia thing doesn't seem to be working out quite as well as I'd hoped, in other words. I mean, Melbourne's a great city, and I'm totally loving the fact that it's summer here (well, technically still spring, but I call this summer weather. It was 36 degrees the other day. I don't think Vancouver's ever been that hot!) but autumn at home. Although, it does tend to make me feel strangely out-of-time, speaking to my parents having Thanksgiving dinner whilst I'm sitting there in a sundress. 

But, yes. It turns out that my fears of being just as unemployable in Australia as I am at home have, sadly, turned out to be totally justified. Add to that the fact that looking for a place to live-- which I had thought would be a total walk in the park-- was actually a long, drawn-out soul-destroying nightmare of making phonecall after phonecall only to be told that the room was no longer available, then when I did manage to get a viewing, wandering lost round the Melbourne streets-- usually at night-- searching for houses, only to get there and find a dark, dirty, depressing dump of a house inhabited by strange people. (I'm exaggerating here, but not by much.) The few decent houses I did manage to find, the people living there always picked someone else, and the one house where they did pick me, there was a huge drama with the estate agent which resulted in my application being denied because I had no job. All this time, I was living in a hostel, which, while the nicest one I'd ever stayed in, was still a hostel. So, at this point -- mid-to-late August I was very close to packing it all in and going home.Fortunately, it was the darkness before the dawn, & things managed to work out for the best, as, with the help of J, I managed to find a nice house that was not dark, dirty & depressing, but bright, clean, and cheerful. With normal people living in it. And no popularity contests to win or beastly estate agents to be approved by before I could move in.

So at this point, I thought, 'right, things are finally turning around for me here.' I'd just signed on with a temp agency for work, and everyone I'd spoken too had said how the agencies had just heaps of work, I wouldn't have time for it all. So I moved in to my new house, finally unpacked everything, and sat back and waited for the work to start flooding in. And waited. And waited. (Note to self: People LIE. Or, they don't mean to lie, but the rules which apply to them don't, for some reason, seem to apply to you.) No work appeared, and my savings were dwindling, as were my fantasies of all the nice things I could buy for myself once the money started rolling in. At last, the call came. (hee, I love saying that, it sounds so dramatic!) It was quite dramatic as well, because they called at 10am, and wanted me to start asap. So, I lept out of bed and got all dressed up in my new suit, which I was so excited to wear-- with the heels and tights and everything, the overall effect was very, 'take a letter, Miss Smith'-- and dashed off to the train station. Standing on the platform I suddenly thought that here I was, fufulling my teenage ideas of being a proper grown-up going to work, standing there waiting for the train in my suit. The thing was, I didn't feel like a proper grown-up at all, more like I was playing dress-up. I certainly felt strange dressed like that, like an impostor, partucularly when I caught sight of my reflection in a shop window.

An hour and half and two train rides later, I was no longer feeling very grown up or sophisticated at all. I just felt lost and panic-y. Like so many things in my life, this had ended/begun with me dashing round, completely lost and increasingly late. In my haste to catch the train, I had only given the map on the computer a cursory glance before I dashed out the door, and so when I exited the train station and confidently set out in the direction I thought the office was in, I was dead wrong, and spent over an hour getting progressively more lost in the hot sun, and as my wrong turns had taken me to the middle of a residential neighbourhood, there was no-one around to point me in the right direction. I didn't even have the number so I could call for directions. Finally, when I almost 2 hours late, and on the verge of giving up, I finally stumbled on the right street. Luckily, my supervisor was very understanding about it. 

Anyways, that job was only two days, but a couple days later I got another that lasted for six days (& I managed not to get lost on my way there), so it seemed as though business had finally picked up. But the week after that, I only had one day of work, so I thought that perhaps I had better renew my online search for slightly longer-term jobs. After some inner debate, I applied for a job that went until the end of the year, in a mailroom, as I decided I couldn't afford to be too picky. It was through an agency, and they called me the next morning to go in for an interview. I had a bad feeling as soon as I walked into the office. It was hard to put my finger on exactly what, but something seemed a little off. It might have been a combination of the slightly worn though over-enthusiastic decoration, and the other people waiting in the reception area, most of whom were older and slightly strange looking, in the way that older people with temporary menial jobs tend to be. (oh dear, that totally makes me sound like a terrible snob...) So, it turned out that the job was only 4-6 hours a day, not full-time, but at least it was every day. So I though I'd better take it, at least until something better turned up. But when they called to confirm my start time, it turned out that it wasn't every day, just when the company needed extra help. And when I went in for the first day, it turned out that it was just 4 hours every day, no extra. Three weeks later, and I've had six half-days of work. So much for that idea. I'm now thinking that I might to go home much earlier than planned if something longer-term doesn't show up, because I'm just not making enough money. And I'm starting to go a little crazy with nothing to do all day. Well, I'll just have to see how it goes. Maybe with summer and the holidays coming up, there'll be more temp work available as people take more holidays.

Speaking of holidays, after all this whinging I almost forgot to mention how fantastic my month-long holiday round Oz with J, U, and V was back in July. It was great to meet up with the girls again and catch up with everything. As always seems to happen when we get together, we had some crazy times, particularly as we left civilised Melbourne and Sydney behind and drove up into wacky Queensland. Man, there are some weird towns and people up there. We'd rented a car for 3 days, so we could see some more out-of-the-way places, but it turned out we'd vastly underestimated the distance we'd need to cover, so there was a lot more time spent driving each day than we'd planned, in order to get from Byron Bay up to the Whitsundays in time. But we got to see country towns when we stopped for the night, and for meals, and whilst I was very impressed by how they were unspoiled by rampant development and big-box stores, they did have an unmissable aura of strangeness about them. Maybe something to do with being so isolated. Then, the island we stayed on in the Whitsundays was extremely undeveloped (there were no roads or anything, just the run-down resort where we were staying), and also had a very strange aura to it. Walking around one day, we all agreed that it had a sort of <i>Lost</i>/<i>Jurassic Park</i>/Evil Genius Lair feel to it, like we were about to stumble upon some dastardly secret experiment. There was even a mysterious cable coming out of the ocean and running across the beach into the jungle. I was going to follow it to see if it led to a crazy Frenchwoman's underground home, but I was wearing flip-flops and was frightened of all the deadly Australian snakes and spiders, so decided that it was better to just pretend that it did.

Anyways, the rest of the trip was mostly your typical tourist stuff, but it was heaps of fun, and we saw some amazing things: all the sights in Sydney, Byron Bay, snorkeling on the Great Barrier Reef, the Daintree Rainforest, Uluru, and lots more. In fact, I had such a great time and was so busy that I didn't see a single movie for the whole month of July. I have made up for this since, of course, what with being mostly unemployed and all, but that's the longest I've gone without feeding my cinema addiction since I started uni lo these many years ago."

"event","...to bring you a what's-happening-now post of randomness.

So, here I am at work, super-early again (I can get a ride in with Dad, but only if I leave at 7:10am-yikes! Which means I've been setting my alarm for 6:15- double yikes!) But it's worth it, cos it saves 40 mins vs getting the bus, & means I can leave at 3:30pm, which makes up for it. Anyways, the novelty of having a job has def worn off now, but I guess I'm still glad to have something to do during the day-- & I'm super-glad for the money.

Speaking of which, I went shopping on the weekend, & got myself some new clothes (a cool Twenties-esque skirt & a few tops) plus the DVD of the first series of <i>Upstairs Downstairs</i> (yes, I'm that cool that I really like old British tv programmes), AND, finally, a really nice leather album for my pics, etc from Edinburgh. I've been looking for an album like this ever since I got back, to no avail. My plan is to make a scrapbook-type-thing, & I wanted the old-fashioned sort of photo album, with the thick card pages, where I could stick the photos in with those cool corner things, but they're really hard to find. Anyways, this one came from Chapters, & was on sale for less than $20! I think I might go get another, I have so many pics it'll probably take at least at 2.

So, I had a lovely weekend. The parents were over on Mayne, & it was so nice to have the house all to myself. I stayed in bed til noon, with a cup of tea, reading, I spent as long as I wanted on the kitchen comp--so I had a downloading binge, including all my favourite music from <i>House</i>; see music ^), & I spent ages lying on the living-room floor listening to music cranked up loud. It was so rejuvenating, it really bucked me up immeasurably-- I feel better & so much more cheerful than I have in absolutely ages. I feel like I've finally recovered not only from the week where Mum was away & I had to look after Dad & J, but going back even further to all that time when I couldn't find a job, & even before that, when I finished uni, & wrote exams, & all of that, I think I must've been mopey & out-of-sorts since then at least. Which has left me with a window of 2 1/2 months since returning from Edi that I've actually been <i>in</i> sorts. By the time I'd recovered from that, I was hit with the trauma of finishing uni & being expected to do something useful with my life. Sigh. Well, at least I don't see any more imminent traumas.

Ha-- as usual, I only wanted to make a quick post, & look what's happened. Anything to avoid working. Well, a quick re-hash of my recent pop-culture experiences & thoughts. For some reason, I haven't seen too many movies recently, but now there's loads out that I want to see. This weekend, I saw <i>The Corpse Bride</i>, which I really liked, it was so imaginative, & also <i>The Constant Gardener</i>, which was quite good, though a bit upsetting in its subject matter. Have also become addicted to tv shows on DVD, having bought also <i>House</i> & <i>Lost</i>. Have worked my way through House, & am just getting started on Lost, so am quite obsessed with both those at the mo. And, am angry with Fox for putting House on hiatus for a month for bloody baseball-- this reminds me of when I was obsessed with <i>The X-Files</i>, & they used to do the same thing to me then. I should be glad for the 3 new eps, though I'm sensing a change of tone from last season...really liked 'Autopsy', but 'Acceptance' & ""Humpty Dumpty' felt a bit off. I'm ready for my House fix tonight, but will have to make do with the repeat. At least there's a new Lost on Weds-- that's even worse when they throw in a bunch of repeats as its so cliff-hanger-y. I'm desperate to find out more about The Hatch, & those people who capture Michael, Sawyer, & Jin."

"event","As it's been so long since I updated, I thought I'd catch up over several entries, rather than my usual single ginormous entry. The reason I haven't updated for so long is primarily laziness, mixed with being back home and therefore having to use the family computer in the kitchen where everyone can see what I'm doing (or so I feel; my mother insists I'm paranoid & no-one is looking over my shoulder. Don't tell her, but she's probably right.) However, now I have finally successfully (more-or-less, anyways) manouvered the soul-destroying process which is more commonly known by the name of 'job hunting' with the end result that I now spend 8 hours a day, 5 days a week in front of a computer, and (since the novelty of actually having a job is quickly wearing off) am searching for ways to distract myself from said job while still maintaining the illusion of working, I forsee a return to frequent updates.

But enough of this: let's return to late April, and my surprisingly difficult farewell to Kingston & university...

<center>*Insert ""wobble-glass"" effect here*</center>
I managed to survive my remaining exams, despite having to fight off plagues of fruit flies to get to them-- no joke, every time I ran my hands through my hair during the exams, my desk would become littered with their tiny carcasses. Prehaps they were a punishment for my deadly sin of sloth-- I did not, needless to say, spend the whole time swotting madly. But I did alright, somehow, & my reward is a lovely degree which I cannot read, it being in Latin (the extent of my Latin being pretty much 'carpe diem' & 'caveat emptor') & which is now rolled up in its mailing tube on the dining room sideboard.

The moving-out business was its usual highly stressful near-disaster. I managed to sell most of my stuff, only to have the extremely spacey girl who was going to buy my bed (& whom I had stupidly said could pay me when she came to pick it up) pull a no-show, then e-mail me some incredibly feeble excuse. So duped out of $90, I had no choice at this point other than putting it out with the rest of my random bits for the Salvation Army to pick up. I would have been angry, but I was beyond caring by this point. Then there was my near panic attack, when I got into a cab with 2 huge bags of stuff to send home on a Greyhound bus in an attempt to avoid paying excess baggage fees, & when I told the driver my destination was the shipping depot he replied that had closed down. To cut a long & panicked story short, it turned out that it had just moved down the road into the main bus station, so I was able to send my stuff off.

All this-- packing, shipping, & selling-- was happing on the day before I left, in the rain, & by the evening I was completely knackered & collapsed in a heap on my suitcase in the middle of my empty room. But I managed to pull myself together enough for a farewell dinner with Maggie at Le Chien Noir-- the same bistro my mother & I eaten at the very first night I spent in Kingston--as I thought it would lend a lovely sense of closure to things.

We had planned to go out for breakfast the next morning too, but in the frantic last-minute rush, completely ran out of time. And so, before I knew it, I was sitting on an aeroplane watching Kingston disappear beneath me.(& I was sitting next to a Scottish man going to Scotland, so I thought was a neat summing-up of my entire 4 years at uni.) And I must say, despite all my complaining about Kingston over the years, I was not a little sad to see it fade into the distance. It was, after all, a siginifigant part of my life, I had a lot of memories there, & in the last year had finally 'come to terms' with it, as it were, discovering some nice places there. (I especially miss the video store down the street, which was the best & nicest I've ever been in)

And so, 10 months to the day I'd arrived home from Edinburgh, I was back home again, still not entirely sure I wanted to be there, & still without much choice in the matter. The difference was, this time I would HAVE to find a job, as I had my entire life before me, an utter blank, and a rapidly creeping panic of what on earth was I going to do next..."

"event","...because mine on Thursday wasn't the absolute and complete utter torture that I thought it would be, particularly when I realised that in the last 2 years I have written exactly 1 exam, and that was 10 months ago, so my exam-taking skills, rather questionable at the best of times, were bound to be a bit rusty, to say the least. This was also my literary criticism exam, the one I was dreading the most as is all bizarre abstract theories which are impossibly dense, and which I am supposed to understand at 8:30 in the morning not having read the article the night before because it was so boring it put me to sleep. That is, on those occaisions when I actually made it to class, which became increasingly rare as the year dragged on, and my immunity to my alarm clock grew alarmingly (harhar). At any rate, it's all over now, and I managed to write a decent amount on all the questions before time ran out, so I don't think I bungled it too badly.

Essay writing, on the other hand, is not the least like riding a bike. It is like... well, it's like something which the more you do it, the worse you get at it. Which perhaps isn't like anything else at all, because I can't think of anything like that. It's just that, when I look back at the essays I wrote in high school, they all seem to have been better thought out, better structured, and just generally better than the ones I'm writing now. (though perhaps that's just my bad memory?) My take-home exam essays for Art History, which were due Thursday I just turned in this afternoon, having finished them this morning. Ooops. Anyways, thank Baz that's the last essay I have to write, ever, for my entire life (fingers crossed!), so hurrah with brass knobs on!!! Not a moment too soon is all I have to say about that. I'm sure that if I had another year at uni I would completely fail everything. Usually the desperation I need to write an essay kicks in at least the day before it's due, but this last term it hasn't seemed to kick in until <i>after</i> the blasted thing's due, if at all...

Well, enough of that. I've an entire week of freedom before my next exam and it's a beautiful, sunny, warm day (warm enough for sandals, short sleeves & bare legs!) which I celebrated by walking round to the ice cream shop this afternoon. I must make the most of this before I head home in two weeks and will have Mater & Pater breathing down my neck until I find a job.

Oh, and just because no week's complete without a bit of drama: the insanely frightening gigantic unidentifiable bugs with about 6 million legs, including an especially huge back pair, are back. I was in bed last night watching a DVD, & as I reached for my cup of tea, out of the corner of my eye I noticed something on the wall. Upon (slightly) closer inspection, this something was reavealed to be one of those terrifying insects. So I did what any sane person would do: I screamed and ran out of the room, scaring the life out of my flatmate who was watching tv in the living room. Anyway, I enlisted her help, and the two of us went back to capture the beast...only to find that it had vanished. Well, there was no way I was going to bed with this thing on the loose, so we tore apart my bedroom looking for it before it finally skittered back into view and I was able to capture it in a glass, then throw the whole thing off the balcony. No sign of any since, fortunately, *knocks on wood* but I'm still a bit twitchy. These are seriously frightening bugs, and I have never seen them anywhere before, I have no idea what they are, nor do I particularly want to. Just when I was starting to feel quite warmly about Kingston, & was getting a bit sad about leaving forever, this happens, & now I can't wait to leave & be as far away from these things as poss!"

So, I officially had my last university class ever on Friday morning, how absolutely thrilling & terrifying is that? I cannot believe how quickly uni has gone past. Four years, only a year less than high school yet seems to have taken hardly any time at all, whereas high school seemed to go on for an absolute eternity. I've just gotten over my quarter-life crisis at turning 20, and now I'm having another one brought on by the shock at finding myself through uni with no idea what to do next & the feeling that time is going by so fast & I never seem to accomplish anything. Help!!!

I have calmed down a bit since my last post at least, and gotten another essay  (complete crap again, AND a day late, again) done. Plus I discovered yesterday that while I thought I had a take-home exam, & an essay due, and an exam, all on Wednesday, it turns out that they're actually all due on Thursday instead. The reason for all this confusion is because my calender is completely arsed up: there's no 10th this month, but two 23rds!? Lol, twas quite funny actually, I got in an argument over the phone with Mum, she was reminding me to phone Dad on his birthday next Sunday, but when I looked at the calender it said that the 17th, his birthday, was on Saturday, yet Mum insisted it was Sun-- so then I had a closer look at the calender & noticed all the mistakes. <i>Well</i>, that's the last time I rely on a calender that comes free through the post courtesy of The Honourable Peter Milliken, MP. I'm not going to be voting for HIM, I can tell you that. (well, not that I could anyways, not living here...) All I can say is, it's a lucky thing I noticed this now instead of turning up for my exam at 9am Weds & it's not on, I would not have been pleased.

Meanwhile, my plan to be organised & productive during these last three weeks does not seem to have gotten off to the best start...instead of getting up at 9am yesterday to do the timeline for my work project whilst watching the Royal Wedding, I woke up at 11:15, finished my novel in bed for an hour, then just as I'd gotten up & was sitting down to work, Mum called. I ended up dashing off the timeline in about 20mins, and being late for our meeting at the library. This job is turning to be not much more than a nuisance, I'm hardly earning any money from it. Ah well, every little helps I supposed. I was quite proud of myself this am though, as I did get up at 9:30, had a shower, then went out to buy a pain ay chocolat, cafe au lait, & strawberries for breakfast. After breakfast, I even managed to finally post my advertisement about selling off my furniture...and that's where the productiveness ended, really, as I don't seem to have gotten very far in writing the first part of my Art History exam, which was the task I'd set myself for today. Well, there's still plenty of time, so enough of this procrastinating, & off I go to get writing..."

"event","...and is now huddled in a heap in the corner quietly having a nervous breakdown. (yes, it's time again for another whingy self-indulgent post about the horrible stress/stressful horror of uni...)

I have come to the conclusion that essays & exams were invented with the sole purpose of making uni so unpleasant as to drive students out into the real world & actual jobs. If it weren't for essays <i>et al</i>, I know I would probably be sticking around at uni (although one somewhere a bit more exciting) for a few more years, not having to work, sponging off of the government & my parents, sleeping in, having most of the day to spend as I please-- going to the coffee shop, going to the movies, reading, watching tv, on the computer, etc-- then just spending a few hours a day having a nice discussion about books & other interesting stuff. It's just the essays that ruin everything-- they're always hanging over my head so I can't enjoy things, then I inevitably wind up spending a simply agonised & torturous evening/night writing the damn things, plunging into an abyss of depression where I feel as though I'm stuck in some sort of unending hell & will never be happy again... (oh, the angst!) Anyways, I know I bring it all on myself, which is all the worse really cause I simply <i>can't</i> seem to do it the 'proper way' w/ stress-free weeks of preperation & research. Ah well, only 2 more to write (plus a take-home exam, plus 4 actual exams...) and then I'm free forever!

Anyways, this was all brought on by first an essay that was absolute agony to write-- I never got into the rhythm of the thing, so every word was an effort to wring out, so of course it's really crap, AND I ended up handing it in a day late; then another seminar this morning that I was up until all hours preparing, only to sleep through my alarm this morning, and awake in an absolute panic at 8:05, leap out of bed, get ready in 10mins, then speed-walk to the library in 10 mins (half the usual time), attempt to catch my breath while the handout was copied agonisingly slowly, snatch it up, and sprint over to class, somehow managing to arrive only a couple minutes late, & luckily it hadn't started yet. Anyways, the whole thing was rather sick-making (to borrow some fantastic slang from <i>Vile Bodies</i>, which I'm reading at the mo) as I loathe seminars, I'm always terrified that I'll totally misinterpret whatever & look like a complete idiot, but at least I got it over & done with...

Other things stressing me out: all the essays & exams still in the extremely near future, hovering over me like a giant boulder suspended in the air above me; having to get the work project done by the end of the month as well; and having to pack &/or get rid of everything here.

*Deep calming breath* Okay, how about some happy things now? Well, the weather's finally picked up, & we've had some quite lovely spring days at last (though I simply cannot get used to the completely bizarro seasons here, as even though it's sunny & (relatively) warm, the grass is still all dead, there are no flowers, & no blossoms or anything on the trees, so it still looks like the dead of winter). Hmm, what else? Oh yes, well, there's  good tv on at the mo: <i>Lost</i> was so intense on Weds, it just keeps getting better, and I have also been officially addicted to <i>House</i> for a few weeks now, due in large part to the fabulously talented & sexy Hugh Laurie. I still don't think that I've completely come to terms with the fact that House is the same person as Bertie Wooster & the Georges in <i>Blackadder</i>: adorably thick & bumblingly British-upper-class vs intelligent, cynical, snarky American, I must say they both have their appeal! =P Ooh, which reminds me, I must rent the 3rd Series of <i>Jeeves & Wooster</i> when I'm at the video store later. Well, that's not much compared to the stressful stuff, but I'll take what I can get, plus hopefully lots of exiting stuff is in my essay-free future!"

"event","It's times like this when I wonder if I'll ever make it out of uni alive...

For the last two nights I've had less than 4 hours sleep (& I'm a person who needs 9 hours usually) due to having yet once again left my assignments to the last minute. I didn't make any plans for the weekend, so I could work on them, but of course the result was that I completely wasted 2 days stuck inside doing nothing whilst I waited for inspiration to strike, then finally having to force myself to begin my essay Sunday night. And, as soon as I got my Modern British Fiction essay done for Mon afternoon, I had to come back home & get stuck straight into my seminar presentation for 8:30 this morning. And by 'stuck straight into', I mean of course faffing around until almost 10, then having a slight panic attack when I realise the article I was supposed to explain to the class is impossible to understand...I finally managed to get what I hope is the main gist of it, but not a fun night. Then, after getting to sleep sometime after 3, had to get up just after 7 so I could go photocopy the sodding handout before class. I don't really think I helped anyone's understanding of it that much, but at least I got the bloody thing over and done with-- Baz, I hate having to give seminars. =[

Anyways, 2 glorious weeks of freedom now-- then another Assignment Hell to get mired in, when I have 2 essays & another seminar within a week. Then, in another week and a half, I have an Art History assignment, my Studies in Criticism  essay due, AND the final for that class, all on the same day. Then a week off, followed by 3 final exams in a row. I am seriously going to die...I MUST learn to get things started ahead of time. (Yes, because if I haven't learned from my experience on every major assignment since I was 10, I'm certainly going to grasp this concept with 3 1/2 weeks of classes left in my school careeer.

On another tangent,  I think I've finally calmed down enough from the Oscars to comment without going off on a huge rant. Suffice it to say that the only time I wasn't bored silly was when I was outraged at who was winning. Seriously, the Oscars just seem to get worse and worse every year. The last 2 years seem to have been especially bad because there were absolutely NO surprises, or interesting speeches in either ceremony. I doesn't help, I suppose, that I haven't been very excited about the nominees for a couple years either. I mean, it's hardly even worth my while writing out my thoughts on the winners, it's the same as the <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/pennilessauteur/7774.html"">Globes</a>. I just want to say that Annette & Marty Scorsese were SO robbed; I can't believe Hillary Swank won, her perf was easily the weakest of the nominees. The only person I was glad to see win was Cate Blanchett (& she had a lovely dress as usual, unlike Hillary who looked as though she'd put hers on backwards) And I hated all the changes to the ceremony. And...I could go on and on, but I'll restrain myself. After all, there's always next year, right?

Between my frustration at the Oscars getting all wrong yet again, & the inevitable post-vacation malaise from my long weekend in Toronto, I've been a bit mopey lately...I'd just been starting to pick up a bit before all this work that I'd put off hit the fan. I should savour it more, really-- after all, this is my last month and a half at school, possibly ever-- yikes! T.O. was pretty fun, though-- H&J were so nice to me, esp considering they're just family friends, not relations. They took me out to dinner & to see <i>Death of a Salesman</i>, which was really good, and up the CN Tower (another to add to my list of Really Tall Buildings Visited). Plus I had a day in the city by myself, of shopping (got some good bargains at H&M, hope they make it to Vancouver soon) & the afternoon at the art gallery. All in all, a nice break from the mundanity of Kingston."

All well, only 6 more weeks to go (yikes, that's actually a really frightening thought!) & hopefully this week off will pick up my interest, so I'll actually start going to all my classes again cause I've been a bit, erm, slack the last few weeks. But, starting after Reading Week, I'm back to going to ALL my classes, and am going to get started on my assignments ahead of time as I've got so many due. (Er, yes, well we'll see how this plan works out, shall we?) Plus work now...not that I can do much until the other girl does some research for me. What I am supposed to be doing is reading this Grade 3 science textbook to get an idea of what sort of writing style kids of that age understand, plus any other books for kids of that age. Hmm, getting paid to read children's books, this job kicks ass! (The only thing is, BECUASE I'm getting paid to do this, it automatically becomes a chore & so much less fun than when I'm supposed to be doing something else. Damn non-sensical human psychology!)

In other happy news, my Amazon order came today, depite the fact that according to the website they haven't shipped it yet. (???) So now I've got <i>Eternal Sunshine</i> and <i>Bright Young Things</i> to watch this weekend, yay! Good timing too, 'cause we've been reading Evelyn Waugh in my Modern British Fiction class this week (thank Baz I finally finished <i>Pamela</i> for my 18th Cen Lit class), so I'm in the mood for a little debauched Twenties decadence! =)

Oh yes, and today is the 2-year anniversary of both my first trip to New York and my seeing Baz's <i>La Boheme</i>. OMB, that seems so long ago now, so much has happened since then...I'd so love to go back in time & see it again (without the <a href=""http://www.geocities.com/lamourfoumr"">drama</a> this time!), I was so upset that it never came to London last spring like it was supposed to. Well, I guess I'll just have to put my CD on & reminisce. Lol, I remember on the anniversary of it last year, I was up most of the night writing an essay & went slightly insane & put on the same clothes I wore when I went to see it (plus my pink beret!) & took a half-hour out of Essay Hell to sit there listening to the CD with my eyes closed, pretending I was back in the Broadway Theatre.

"event","Wow, things have really turned around in the last couple of weeks: finally my life is starting to get interesting again! Chronologically:

Monday Last: Got around at last to phoning family friends H&J to arrange to <strike>sponge off of</strike> visit them for the second half of reading week. So now is arranged to go to Toronto from Wednesday to Sunday of week after next. Not quite as exciting as the trip to New York two years ago, but much better than slobbing around here all week with nothing to do. Must try to find some guidebooks at the library so I can be all touristy there! (for some reason, the only place it's not embarssing to be a tourist is in one's own country...)

Thursday Last: Actually got a job interview for Work-Study Program, first since <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/pennilessauteur/6548.html"">previous disaster</a>. This one was, natuarally in that same building (why can't the office just across the street be looking for help?) but at least now I was well acquainted with the layout-- & I remembered to bring the office number with me (just--had to run back to grab it as I was going out the door). Turned out that the office I was looking for this time was right next to the woman's who  gave me directions the last time, and I managed to find it w/ no major crisises.

Anyways, I have concluded that there are two types of job interviews: the first kind, where the interviewer sits on the other side of the desk with their checklist of questions straight out of <i>The Idiot's Guide to Conducting Job Interviews</i> which require as answers copious amounts of complete BS from the interviewee. I am total shite at making up BS answers to rubbish questions, so these interviews usually involve long, gabbled, repetitive answers which trail off into excruciating silences. Needless to say, I do not get those jobs.

The other type of interview is the sort where the disorganised interviewer keeps you waiting while s/he searches everywhere for your CV, sometimes finding it, asks you to 'tell me about yourself', then spends a long time giving a detailed monologue about the company and the job, which gradually evolves into a discussion of your duties, the unspoken assumption that you got the job gradually  working its way into the speech. These are the sort of interviews I like, because: a) I'm not required to 'sell myself' which I utterly loathe, and b) I get the job!

The second sort of interview was what that one was, so I now have a job at last! (better late than never, that's my motto) The best part is, the job sounds actually really fantastic-- all those people who didn't hire me can keep their filing and data processing, I'm going to be writing a child's diary from the settler period! It's part of this education project the prof is working on, so it will actually be used in classrooms for kids to read, then answer questions/do projects, etc. on. Think of the potential to mold their little minds! *evil cackle* Lol, seriously though, I'm supposed to make it an interesting story, with historical info about flora & fauna in Eastern Canada. Sounds like heaps of fun, esp as I won't have to do the research, & I can work from home so I won't have to trek out to West Campus very often. Can't wait 'til the money starts rolling in!

And, saving the best for last...
Tuesday: The phone rang in the middle of the afternoon, & I almost didn't answer it cause I thought it would be a telemarketer telling me I'd won a free trip to Florida, if only I'd give her my credit card number (um, yeah right...). Anyways, I did answer it, & just as well, cause it was my mother calling to see what my schedule was like in May...because she was just on her way out to the travel agent's to book a holiday! Yep, to celebrate their 25th wedding aniversary, & my graduation from uni, my parents have loosened the purse strings enough to allow for a family holiday: three days in Disneyland, then a cruise back up the West Coast from L.A. to Vancouver, with stops in San Francisco (somewhere I've always wanted to go) & Victoria.

So, that's exciting! (if nothing else, twill be interesting to see if I can survive 10 days in close quarters with my family after 4 years away from home-- I was 16 the last time we went on a holiday like this.) I could tell that something was up-- my parents are not the best people at keeping secrets-- so I'd been trying to think where they might be planning to go. Part of me wanted to go back to the UK & Ireland (Ewan being in <i>Guys and Dolls</i> in the West End plays a tiny part in that, I must admit), but a trip like that for 4 people would mean an awful lot of time and money. Perhaps if I earn lots of money & can manage a budget visit in August, to catch the Edinburgh Festival as well... I must admit, though, California sounds awfully good to me right now, stuck as I am in the middle of an Ontario winter.

So, that's my exciting news for now! =] I just hope this good luck keeps up now it's back. *crosses fingers*"

"event","Firstly, it's slightly pathetic, but I actually skipped my first class on Tues to watch the nominations live...I wasn't going to, but it's a really boring class so I was looking for an excuse to miss it, plus it was really cold out (surprise), plus this is the last year I will be on the East Coast, and therefore will watch the noms since there is no way I'm getting up at 5:30am unless I myself am nominated. And all the fun's in watching the names get read out one by one, with the suspense. Adrien Brody really needs to give the kissing thing a rest though-- his spontaneous marathon kiss with Halle was great, the joke at the ceremony last year with the breath spray was amusing, but the same thing again? It's just old.

The noms themselves were really boring with hardly any surprises. Still, ceremony can hardly get any more boring than last year, so maybe they're saving up the upsets til then? Fingers crossed. Wow, really nothing to say other than I unusually have only seen 2 of the Best Picture nominees, which means I'd better get moving to see the other three before the ceremony-- I make it a rule to see all the Best Pic nominees before the ceremony, and have managed it the last 3 years, so don't want to spoil my streak. <i>Million Dollar Baby</i> starts here tomorrow, so perhaps I'll go see if my loathing has been justified, lol. Rather see <i>Sideways</i> (I knew I should've gone at Christmas) but of course that's just a little too sophisticated for The Town that Culture Forgot. Would also still like to see <i>Vera Drake</i>; perhaps with the 3 major noms it'll finally come here...

<b>Random Bits:</b>

* I am SO addicted to <i>Lost</i> now, it's been building for a while but after last week's ep I think I'm officially obsessed. I can't believe there's another TWO bloody weeks before a new episode. What happened to Claire, damnit?!! (& how adorable was Charlie reading her diary? <333) Which brings me to my next point...

* What has happened to February sweeps on tv? As I remember, from the last week in Jan to last week in Feb, it was all new eps with guest stars, dramatic plot lines, miniseries, etc, but here we are and it's all repeats-- did they change the rules while I was away last year? (this has therefore forced me to spend money renting DVDs as there's nothing on tv except American Idol which I'm fed up with-- people singing really badly are only funny for so long before they're just boring and repetitive.)

* Why does everyone have birthdays at this time of year? J, T, & U all have their birthdays next week which means I've spent a fortune on cards & stamps. Also this has caused depressing comparisons with my life this time last year, when I'd just gotten back from a week in Dublin & we were all going down to London for the next weekend for their birthdays.

* My life is so boring compared to everyone else's-- J just got back from Malaysia, T is going to Rome with her boyfriend for their birthdays, U is going to Prague and just got back from Edinburgh, and T & V are going to vist U in Vienna next month. Strangely, all this has not made me incredibly depressed despite the fact that the only even remotely exciting thing in my forseeable future is a possible long weekend staying with family friends in Toronto over Reading Week. This is most unusual-- good in that I'm relatively happy, but bad in that my expectations have seemingly been lowered so quickly I no longer expect excitement?

* In my Modern British Fiction class, we've just read Virginia Woolf's <i>To the Lighthouse</i> (the more of her writing I read, the more I love it) & learned that her birthday is 25th Jan, which is the day that I first saw <i>The Hours</i> two years ago (I looked it up)-- how cool is that?"

"event","My belated comments on GGs:

<b>Best Picture, Drama: <i>The Aviator</i></b> - Yay, this is what I would've picked as well. The one I really didn't want to win was <i>Million Dollar Baby</i>, which is this year's Film Which I Have an Unrational Grudge Against. (funnily enough, last year's was <i>Mystic River</i>, also by Clint Eastwood. Well, I guess I can't *really* criticise as I haven't seen it yet. (hasn't stopped me yet though :p)

<b>Best Picture, Musical/Comedy: <i>Sideways</i></b> - No surprise here. I haven't seen this yet either, but it sounds deserving. Out of the ones I've seen, my pick would've been <i>Eternal Sunshine</i>, but that was probably a bit too quirky to win.

<b>Best Actor, Drama: Leonardo DiCaprio</b> - Yay, my pick again. Actually, I've only seen his & Johnny's perfs so far from this category & liked both, but I'd say Leo was better. Is it weird that when he talks I still picture Jack Dawson?

<b>Best Actor, Musical/Comedy: Jamie Foxx</b> - And in the upset of the night... Yawn, not much to say here...haven't seen his perf yet, but he's supposed to be great so it's all fine...did think he milked his speech though, esp when he brought in his dead grandma for the tears.

<b>Best Actress, Drama: Hilary Swank</b> - Booo. The actress I don't like in the movie I don't like. I wanted Imelda Staunton to win, cause I like when nice character actors finally get a chance to shine & are rewarded. And she's supposed to be great, winning all the critic's awards. As I've only seen 1 perf in this category (Nicole), suppose I can't really comment...hasn't stopped me yet though ;) Would've been nice if she won, but little chance w/ this film.

<b>Best Actress, Comedy/Musical: Annette Bening</b> - YAY! I loved this movie, and Annette was so great in it, I'm so glad she won so now she can kick Hilary Swank's arse at the Oscars.

<b>Best Director: Clint Eastwood</b> - Booo! Clint, step aside & let a really great director win for once. Poor Marty Scorsese, always the bridesmaid, and he's so nice (even though he lost at the Oscars, was first on his feet to applaud Roman Polanski) & such a talented director. I mean, Clint's films are fine, but they're just well-made, not exceptional.

<b>Best Supporting Actor: Clive Owen</b> - This was a nice way to start off the ceremony, I like Clive & he was so good in <i>Closer</i>, in a horrid way. (I mean that in the best sense, of course, as he was acting)

<b>Best Supporting Actress: Natalie Portman</b> - Another upset, I thought for sure Cate Blanchett would get it, she was so flawless as Katherine Hepburn, but if she didn't win, Natalie's lovely, & great perf as well. (& how funny was Meryl Streep's comment later? lol)

Ceremony in general: I love the Globes, they've usually got better taste than the Oscars (Best Pic for MR, noms for Baz & Ewan, heaps of noms & awards for Nicole, etc, etc) even if the ceremony isn't as interesting (well, depends on how much people have been drinking!) And such a great crowd of stars, Nicole AND Ewan, haven't seen him at an awards show in forever. And my Baz he looked sexy. Loved Nicole's dress as well, that woman's got such great taste.

Ahh, it's great living vicariously, since back in The Real World, I had an essay due today, and my study habits continue their downward spiral. I started it at 10:30 last night, sitting in bed, after finishing my DVDs which were due back today [can I just say that <i>Blackadder</i> is *so* incredibly funny, & I can't believe how many great actors are in it? Jim Broadbent, Miranda Richardson, Stephen Fry, etc, besides Rowan Atkinson, of course. I think my fave line from the second series (what I was watching last night) is: ""Your head is as empty as a enuch's underpants."" ROFLMAO!] Anyways, I could not get inspired to write anything, severe writer's block, so in the end I came up w/ a vague idea for a thesis, and decided that since 1) it was only 1,000 words; 2) it wasn't due until 2pm; 3) I hadn't done my readings for my classes today; 4) I had incredibly crap 'homework' assignment (for no marks, I might add) to hand in in my first class which I hadn't done; and 5) it was supposed to be -25C in the morning, I would just get up at 8 and write it then instead of going to class. Which I did, with the added desperate time constraints giving me the motivation I needed to get going. At 1:30, I printed it off, got my 18 layers of clothing on, and sped-walked to campus to hand it in. (even at this time, it was so cold that my hands were so intensely painful from the cold I was almost crying after 10 mins) Up to the prof's office on the 5th floor, and there's a note on the door, saying he'd given us an extension until class tomorrow morning. ARRRGH! Anyways, it's done now but maybe I'll revise it a bit (after <i>American Idol</i>, that is) And if I'd known about the extension, then I'd have a crisis tonight instead, so all for the best. And I consoled myself by going to Starbucks-- though by the time I got there, my face had frozen so I couldn't talk properly, and I think the girl thought I was a bit slow, lol.

There is still a thick layer of ice on my window from last night, that's how bloody cold it is. [/randomness]"

"event","FINALLY got to see <i>Birth</i> today as it was on at the artsy cinema in town (I love that cinema, cause it feels so avant-garde though the films they show aren't; if there was cigarette smoke drifting through the projection beam I could almost pretend I was on the Left Bank in Paris or somewhere. It's upstairs in this random building where the ground floor looks like an Underground station, and the auditoriums are these tiny rooms with curtains taped over the windows, and beat-up old seats on home-made wooden platforms, then the projectionist runs in late finishing his meal & appologising.) But I digress: <i>Birth</i> was... well, interesting. Not in the 'I don't understand it', disparaging sort of way, but in the 'I need some time to think about it' sort of way. I do have one major complaint, though, and that is the fact that in so many of the shots the boom mike was visible, sometimes even the pole as well, and in a couple shots the top of the set where they hadn't built a ceiling. It was really distracting, and I just can't believe that in a professionally-made film they could keep making such a basic mistake as that. Apart from that though, I really liked the look of the film, the sort of heightened, un-real feeling it had, and Nicole's performance was incredible, as always. And I liked the ending, I was wondering what would happen, and I thought it was good how they explained some things but left just enough unanswered to keep you wondering... 

Slightly off-topic, they were actually filming this when I was in New York 2 years ago, so I found that quite exciting, esp during the opening sequence, since that was what Central Park looked like when we were walking round it, all snowy & kind of surreal-looking.

I've just been finishing up my list of all the movies I saw last year (yes, I'm very OCD & actually write down all the movies I see & when), so I thought I'd just stick it up here for reference:

TOTAL= 55 (trips to the cinema; 53 different films)</lj-cut>

Believe it or not, that's actually 1 less trip to the cinema than last year (when i started this obsessive list), though I saw more movies this year since I had lots of repeat viewings in 2003 (mainly <i>The Hours</i>, <i>Down With Love</i>, <i>Chicago</i>) We'll see how I do this year. January tends to be my month with the most viewings, and I'm not doing too badly so far, with 4 movies (<i>Spanglish</i>, <i>The Aviator</i>, <i>Ocean's Twelve</i>, & now <i>Birth</i>. My fave so far would probably have to be <i>Aviator</i> edging out <i>Birth</i>. I'm just a sucker for big glossy glamourous movies.

Not too much happening in my life. So tired from getting up early every day; I almost fell alseep in my last class on Fri. The weather here's been crazy: hot, cold, rain, snow, sun, wind. One day we had freezing rain & everything was covered in a sheet of ice, I literally skated to class, that being the best way to get there without being covered in bruises. Now we're back to being bitterly cold. I simply cannot understand why people live here, I think I'm insane for living here for 3 years while at school, & cannot wait to get back to a proper climate, where you don't need to put on 15 layers before you can go outside in the winter!"

"event","Okay, sorry for my depressingly whingy last post, I am in a better mood now, just rather cold cause it's bloody freezing out today (something like -10C) and for some reason it's always colder in my room than the rest of the flat (probably cos while I have a really big window I don't get any direct sun and it's really draughty, being old with large gaps at the side)

Anyways, am slowly getting back in the uni routine, though yesterday had a weird sort of feeling all day, beginning with having to get up before it was properly light ( then consequently falling asleep midday so I couldn't get to sleep again last night) Had a dilemma in the afternoon, as Nicole was on the Ellen Show at 4, which is when I have a class...what to do? In the end, I decided that as I hadn't missed that class to chat longer w/ the girls on MSN, I couldn't miss it to watch a tv show...hopefully I can catch it in reruns. When I got back from class, M was back & her dad took us both out to dinner (Yay, free food!) then drove us to the big Loblaws to stock up on groceries. Of course, I hadn't made a list, so I forgot half the stuff I needed to get, but at least it saved the bother of having to go on the bus. So instead of having to do that this afternoon, I can go to the coffee shop & finish the book I was supposed to have read for class yesterday, much nicer.

Had to get up at 7:30 again this morning, then as I was walking to uni, remembered that my second class was in a different room this term,but I wasn't sure which one, & of course now it was too late to check on the computer. Luckily the room I vaguely remember the professor mentioning last term turned out to be the right one, though I was a bit reluctant to take off my coat until the professor walked in & I knew for sure I was right, in case I was in the wrong room & needed to make a hasty exit before anyone noticed.

No class until 10am tomorrow, hurrah!

<b>2 Hours Later:</b> Why, oh why did I think it would be a good idea to go outside? The coffee shop is only 10 mins away, but by the time I got there my hands & feet were completely frozen, to the point where I was crippled by stabbing pain, and my legs were well on their way to being numb as well...note to self: next time must venture outside, must add at least thermals & extra pairs of socks & gloves, poss extra sweater.

Also: finally got courage to look at mark for Literary Criticism essay written in bed at midnight night before it was due, and I can't believe it but I got an A-! That's incredible, esp when added to A+ on Art History assignment written under similar conditions. I don't know what's happened to my profs but I like it! (mustn't jinx two essays still to get back though)"

"event","Lol, the title refers to the fact that I've just been eating chocolates & drinking Chardonnay by myself, which is what Bridget spends most of the book doing. So yes, I am a bit sad at the mo, in both senses, as I find myself back in dreary grey Kingston with nothing to look forward to for the next three months except getting up at 7:30am four days a week...

I know I really oughtn't to be so disgustingly self-pitying, after all this is my final term at uni so it should be quite exciting, but this year just feels so anti-climatic after last year, and things here, while they really aren't all that bad, just seem that way in contrast. Right now, for instance, instead of having a cup of tea & talking about Christmas hols with the flatmates, I'm drinking wine by myself & watching the really quite boring People's Choice Awards (side note: Golden Globes next week, which should be good!) as M strangely isn't back yet...

At least the trip back went alright yesterday, for once. Plane not delayed, my suitcase turned up (eventually) & I got the bus, which took an hour less than normal because everyone on it was going to the same place. And tonight I had a nice roast dinner, Mum gave me a frozen pork roast to bring back in my suitcase, with a icepack-- it's really funny when I think about it, and lucky I don't have to go through Customs, I'd have a job explaining that if they searched my bag!

I had a nice holiday though, five weeks off, how luxurious! Didn't do anything too exciting, but wasn't bored either-- and for once, no arguments with the family, which was lovely. I did have to patch up a tiff of Mum & Dad's though, about painting the kitchen, she was fed up w/ him being so perfectionist & finding fault with her painting, so she'd stopped & when I got back the kitchen had been in a total mid-painting shambles for a week!

Well, this entry has been a whole lot of nothing, just my bored ramblings. Better go to bed really, as I have to get up so freaking early tomorrow..."

"event","HOORAY!

After 12 weeks of classes, 8 painful papers, and more early mornings than I want to think about, it's finally Christmas hols! Er, well I guess technically I still have that Art History paper to write this weekend, but I'm not going to count that, cos classes have already finished. AND we had the first snow of the year this morning, which was so lovely and Christmas-y.

So anyways, life's been pretty dull for the last while. (didn't even get that job after that whole production. All well, wouldn't have wanted to trek all the way over to West Campus all the time anyways.) Basically periods of boredom interspersed with intense days of panic whenever an essay was due. And my study/essay-writing skills continue to decline, it will be interesting to see just how bad they can get...well, as long as they hold out to the end of April, we'll be alright. 

But the essay that was due this morning, for example: written last night, in bed, at midnight. With absolutely no prior preparation. I don't have very high expectations for that one. It was such a crap topic though, just some completely vague theorising with no analysis of texts to pin it down to. Figures, cos this is the course I had that fab first assignment for, to write a cliched narrative. Well, now the prof's making us pay... Argh, I hate having things due at the last minute, my brain always takes an early holiday. My essay was just painful to write & is just incredibly boring. My only hope is that it's so boring it puts the professor to sleep reading it, then when she wakes up she thinks she's finished reading it, mistakes it for someone else's, interesting, paper and gives me a decent mark. 

But anyways, that's all done now, and I can complain about the next thing: all the movies I have now completely missed cause they're STILL not showing them here. The list is now this:

<i>Being Julia
Birth
Closer
Stage Beauty
Vera Drake</i>

It's just completely unfair that the cinema even had up posters for <i>Birth</i> and <i>Being Julia</i>, the 2 I esp want to see, and then they didn't show them. *deep calming breath* It's okay, I'm going home in 3 days, to a *proper* city, which actually shows good movies. And hopefully I'll be able to catch some of the ones I missed at a rep cinema. AND, while I'm on this whinging paragraph, I STILL haven't gotten to see the Chanel ad 'for real', only on the internet. But it is so fantabulous & luhrvely that I just can't wait to be completely blown away by it on the big screen.

Anyways, movies I have seen: <i>Alfie</i>, with Sexiest Man Alive Jude <333 He's just so yummy and adorable, it was hard to think of him as kind of a bastard-- though he wasn't as much as Michael Caine in the original. Jude again in <i>I <3 Huckabee's</i>...except he looked all fake and American in that. Otherwise, interesting movie but left me v depressed as it was on at the Nightmare Cinema in this horrid 'mall' of cement nightmare box stores, and it took me all bloody day to get there and back on the bus. A little too apropros for a movie about existential angst. <i>Bridget Jones: Edge of Reason</i>, with sexy Colin & Hugh. Cute, fun movie but not as good as the original, as there wasn't really a plot, just lots of wacky things happening to Bridget. Oh, and <i>Finding Neverland</i> last weekend, which was sooo good. I just love Johnny Depp as well, esp with that Scottish accent! And the movie was just lovely, it managed to be happy and sad and heartwarming without being sickeningly sentimental.

So now I'm off to the video store so I can have a movie night (for as long as I can stay awake! --2 hours sleep last night) & then back here for a much-needed gin & tonic!

Tomorrow I'm staying in bed til at least noon. :) :) :)"

"event","So, the job interview from Tues. Didn't happen because I could <i>not</i> find the guy's office. Seriously. I looked for almost 1/2 hour too & just had to give up in the end-- how pathetic am I? Lol... 

Well, first of all while I'm waiting at the bus stop I realise I've forgotten the piece of paper with the actual address/room number on it. But if I go back to get it, then I'll miss the bus & be really late, so I figure I can sort it out when I get there, as I can remember the building name, and there must be a directory there, right? So anyways, I manage to get off the bus at the right stop (off to a good start!) & luckily the building's right there. I go in, and sure enough, there's a big directory in the lobby, and there's the name of the man I have the interview with, and his office number. Excellent. And I've still got 15 mins before 4, so I go for a walk around the building, then come back and set off down the corridor to find his office, which according to the directory is on the main floor. 

Only problem is, there don't really seem to be many offices along this hallway, and not many room numbers either. On my second pass, I find a door with the right number, kind of tucked away in a little alcove. But there's no nameplate or anything, and it's shut, looking pretty deserted. So I knock, and there's no answer. Thinking that maybe it's a back entrance or something, I head off down another corridor to try & find another door, and end up getting totally lost, eventually coming back out where I started. To make matters worse, it's this huge building that's almost totally deserted, and I'm wearing boots that make clicking noises that echo around as I walk. After some more aimless wandering, I come across a tiny room with a sign that says ""general inquiries"", and there's a couple of women in there, so I ask them where this office is, and one directs me just around the corner, to this little cluster of offices. But when I go in there, none of the doors have the right name on them. After getting lost again, I find my way back to the office, and the same woman this time actually escorts me to the cluster-- where I still cannot find the office. 

At this point, a woman whose out-of-the-way office I've walked past at least 3 times finally asks me who I'm looking for. ""Oh, his office is just 3 doors down,"" she says. So I walk 3 doors down, but that office is shut & has a completely different name on the door. ""Er-- this one?"" I ask. ""With this name on the door?"" ""Yes, that's right,"" she says in a manner that suggests I'm a total idiot. Just as I'm wondering if I've wandered into some sort of weird twilight zone, she suddenly turns back to me. ""Just a minute, which M did you say you were looking for?"" It turns out that everyone who'd been giving me directions apparently had stopped listening after I said the first name, and had directed me to the office of someone entirely different, but with the same first name. I'm so relieved to hear that I'm not going completely crazy, and even better this woman then gives me very detailed directions to the office of the ACTUAL person I have the interview with, which turns out to be upstairs. 

I follow her directions no problem-- only once again I find myself in an empty corridor with random unnamed rooms. After a couple futile wanders through, I finally find someone else to ask for directions, but she has no idea what I'm talking about, and a map on the wall only confuses me further by showing many corridors that don't seem to exist. Eventually, I find myself back in a stairway, and as by this time it's almost 4:30 I admit defeat and just go home. By then I was just glad to escape from that creepy building, cause I was starting to feel like I was trapped in a nightmare!

I then had to write an e-mail to the interviewer explaining why I hadn't shown up. Quite honestly, I was expecting to hear no more from him, because someone not showing up for an interview then offering some feeble-sounding excuse about not being able to find the room does not really seem like someone who would be very organised or competent in a job. (although I did conveniently  leave out the part where I forget the address in the first place) But yesterday I had the nicest e-mail back from him, saying how he felt terrible that I hadn't been able to find his office, and rescheduling the interview for tomorrow afternoon-- and this time he's even going to come meet me at the main entrance, lol! And he even signed it with a happy face! So now I feel really pressured to be really good at the interview & get the job, because how sad would it be if after all this I'm total rubbish in the interview?

Okay, well enough of that epic story. At the moment I'm just glad to have gotten my essay out of the way, was shite as usual though not quite so tortuous to write as some, at least was relatively short. I'm giving myself the day off before I tackle my next assignment, as I need some R&R after being up so late last night. Except, Jude is on Conan tonight, which I really want to see, esp after skipping him on Letterman to watch Ewan. So we shall see if I can manage to stay up that late. Oh, and hopefully I'll be back from the interview by 4pm tomorrow, cos I had this e-mail from my mum today, with the subject ""Huge News!!!!!"" I'm wondering what on earth this could be, when I open it up & see this:

<i>You must watch Oprah on Friday.  4pm here.  Could be different in your part of the world.  The cast of the new Bridget Jones will be on!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I am so excited.

I will phone at the weekend once I have recovered.

Love Mumsy xxxx</i>

ROFL, Mum really cracks me up sometimes. But at least the subject of the e-mail makes sense now, tis a pun on Hugh Grant, whom she jokingly calls Huge... Yes, well, bit of an in-joke in our family, I suppose. (Along with ""I beg your parsnips,"" which Hugh once said in an interview we were watching, much to the confusion of the American interviewer & our amusement!)"

"event","Just got this week's EW (w/ fantabulous Nicole Chanel ad on the back!) & was flipping through the TV listings when discovered a crisis: Ewan on Leno & Jude on Letterman AT THE SAME TIME tonight! And me without a video to tape one! Grrr.... I think I'll have to go with Ewan, cause his appearences on Leno are usually so funny (top marks to his story about appearing naked onstage & slipping on a puddle of water, rofl!) plus, now that I think about it, Letterman usually has his first guest on a bit later, so might be able to catch end of Jude's interview? (Plus, Jude hosting SNL this week, so will def watch that!)

Excellent forecast for hotness this week then! [lol, please excuse terrible pun] ;) I need it too, it's been bloody freezing here the last few days, I have to put on about 15 layers before I can set foot outside. Am v worried about winter this year, if I can't even deal with the cold now...might have to break down at last & get some thermals...

Job interview this afternoon is all the way over on sodding West Campus... have avoided going there for 4 years-- in fact, I'd better get the bus cause I'm not even sure where exactly it is to walk to & what with my excellent sense of direction, I'm sure I'll get lost & miss the interview. So unmotivated today, I just want to crash & watch tv. But must get my arse in gear & think up some BS answers for wanking interview questions. Plus have an essay to write for my Post-Colonial Lit course on Thurs, & a take-home exam for Art History due Mon. How can I be expected to go to class AND write all these papers?! (AND have a job interview?) Last year spoiled me so much-- one day of class a week, and only 2 essays total each term-- I've now lost any vestiges of work ethic/motivation I had to begin with. (but shhh, don't tell the interviewer that!)

Right. Will stop procrastinating.... now."

"event","Why I'm an English major:
Everyone else is stressed out with essays & midterms & heaps of reading, but all I had to do this week was write a 1,000 ""narrative of cliches""-- which I really went to town on!  I enlisted M's help, and we had loads of fun making up this v elaborate story involving love overcoming all obstacles and evil plots and penniless poets and greedy D...Counts ;) and in the end I couldn't fit half of the things in. But it was the most fun I've had doing an assignment since Grade 12 when we wrote a chapter of a romance novel-- kind of the same thing when you think about it! And in one of my other classes, we spent Wed talking about the ""Incomplete Enjoyment"" genre of poems. In plain English, that's poems about premature ejaculation, lmao! From the 17th Century, no less. I now know an incredible amount of euphamisms for penis, thanks to the late Earl of Rochester-- soon to be played by Johnny Depp in an upcoming movie. Talk about your naughty words! And then in another class, the prof was trying to help out the ickle second years (they're a bit slow, poor dears) with their essays by showing what NOT to do, using the genius example of a 'poem' by Bush. LOL...well, not really, tis things he has said, arranged by a journalist (Richard Thompson). Too funny...

<lj-cut text=""For your amusement..."">Make the Pie Higher

I think we all agree, the past is over.
This is still a dangerous world.
It's a world of madmen and uncertainty
And potential mental losses.

Rarely is the question asked
Is our children learning?
Will the highways of the Internet
Become more few?

How many hands have I shaked?
They misunderestimate me.
I am a pitbull on the pantleg of opportunity.
I know that the human being and the fish can coexist.

Families is where our nation finds hope,
Where our wings take dream.
Put food on your family!

Knock down the tollbooth!
Vulcanise society!
Make the pie higher!
Make the pie higher!</lj-cut>

In other news, I have a job interview next week, so not looking forward to that...tis for the assistant to the coordinator of some programme here at uni, and I suspect it may be the sort where they ask rubbish questions I'm useless at answering. Ah well, supposedly since I've been accepted in this work-study programme someone MUST hire me. So why I have to go through this interview nonsense I don't know...

And, to start what I'm sure will be an on-going list:

Movies I Really Want to See But Aren't Out Here Yet
<i>Being Julia</i>
<i>I <3 Huckabee's</i>
<i>Stage Beauty</i>
<i>Vera Drake</i>

AND, the release date of <i>Alfie</i> has been postponed 2 weeks to 5th Nov... not pleased.

"event","Ahh, I love long weekends, they're such a treat-- esp at uni, where we get a measly 1 a year (well, 2 if Easter happens to fall early-- which it has yet to do) It seems like all I've been doing this weekend is sleeping, starting with Friday afternoon, when I thought I'd sit and read on my bed, then proceded to fall asleep for 3 hours! I must really have been short of sleep, cause I've slept almost 11 hours for the last three nights. Prehaps not so good in the long run as now I won't be able to sleep tonight, and have to get up tomorrow for my 8:30 again...grrr. Still, only 3 early mornings this week, not 4!

But apart from getting to lie in bed all morning, I've never liked Thanksgiving weekend here, cause everybody goes home, which means I'm here all by my lonesome-- even worse than usual this year, cause I still haven't gotten used to not having 4 flatmates always around to chat with. Truth be told, I'm a little miffed with M for not inviting me to stay this weekend, but what can you do? This town really creeps me out sometimes though, the way it gets deserted even on weekend afternoons. It's been just empty as soon as you get off the main shopping street where the tourists are (the only people in town)-- yesterday when I was walking to the grocery store along residential streets, I felt like I was in one of those horror movies where the hero wakes up to discover they're the only one left alive in the world. And the weather didn't help either, dull grey skies but no rain, just creepy. Cold though, so I'm just glad the landlord finally decided to turn the heat on yesterday, it was almost to the point where I was going to have to burn old essays to keep warm! (or at least I could if we had a fireplace...)

Then I decided to give myself something to do other than moping around and cook a fancy Thanksgiving dinner for myself. Rather than going the traditional turkey route though, I thought I'd do roast beef with all the trimmings-- and a pumpkin pie for dessert. 'Why don't I do this more often?' I thought to myself as I started to prepare things. 'Why the hell did I decide to do this at all?' I thought to myself hours later as I simultaneously tried to fan the smoke away from the smoke dectectors for the 15th time while attempting to keep both hands over my ears to preserve what was left of my hearing. But at least I now know that our safety-conscious landlord has installed not 1 but 2 smoke detectors, meaning that as soon as you manage to shut up the first alarm, the smoke you fanned away reaches the second and you then have to run over there before dashing back to the kitchen to save another dish that's started burning while you're dealing with the smoke dectectors. And then the whole viscious cycle starts again... Well, nothing managed to get really burnt in the end, but it was about 9:30 before I finally sat down to eat. And it was a nice dinner, but eating by yourself is never any fun, no matter how nice the food. So tonight it's leftovers-- including the remnants of my Thanksgiving bottle of wine. Nothing like a glass or two of wine to make everything seem a bit rosier!

Oh yes, and how great were the ET snippets on the Chanel commercial? I always love having a chance to see Baz selling his latest vision, plus Nicole looks absolutely gorgeous in this ad, and Rodrigo-- yum! As Baz put it, 'women want to be Nicole, but they want to be wanted by Rodrigo.' Couldn't have said it better myself! But where was the sneak preview of the entire ad on Wednesday, like they promised on Tues? And when is it actually coming out, I keep hearing different dates? But I have made a pwetty new icon from it-- is it just me, or does Nicole look a little Audrey Hepburn-esque in that pic?"

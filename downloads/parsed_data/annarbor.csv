You know when you had one of those nights that is just so hilarious that you never want to forget it? Well last night can definitely go into the history books!!

Last night one of my bosses threw a ""Decade Party"" for all of the senior staff at work.  The theme was that you had to dress up like your favourite decade and then we were going to her house to drink and go to Joe Dogs.

It was one of the funniest nights i've had in awhile... so i'm making this entry so I never forget it.

Lets start off with a classic ""BEFORE"" picture.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v28/annarb0r/lj1.jpg"">

Here we are BEFORE... I was from the 80's (it's funny because everything I have on I wear regularly except for the shirt haha) and Ads was from the 50's.  Through the course of the night, everyone started calling him LEATHER instead of Ads.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v28/annarb0r/lj2.jpg"">

It turned out that there were a bunch of 80's girls there too!! AND a mad shout out to Chrissy who went 90's aka Stephanie Tanner attire.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v28/annarb0r/lj123.jpg"">
There were TONS of men at the party.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v28/annarb0r/lj3.jpg"">

Sarah and I split a 40 of vodka.  I was DONE... it was messy.  We walked over to Joe Dogs and got in without waiting since we were VIP.

I can't even explain the looks that we got from people in the bar. It was hilarous.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v28/annarb0r/lj4.jpg"">

Lisa goes ALL OUT... shout-out to the SURF STYLE jacket.  Second shout-out to my awesome arm positioning.


There was a live band upstairs setting up.  I went behind the drums and yelled ""TIME FOR MY SET!"" and as I was searching for some sticks, one of the band members came and REEMED me out.  So my friends bought me a shot to cheer me up. 

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v28/annarb0r/lj5.jpg"">

There also was this older man in a tye-dye tank top.  As I Was leaving to go to the bathroom I told him ""THOSE GIRLS OVER THERE REALLY WANT TO DANCE WITH YOU!"" and brought him over to the girls and then left aha.  Apparently he told them "" I have a 27 year old grand daughter!""

I also love how I am pulling his tank top. 

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v28/annarb0r/lj6.jpg"">

We decided to go to the bank.  I decided to go for a hike.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v28/annarb0r/lj7.jpg"">

Lisa went to the bank and I climbed up on the shopping carts at No Frills.  Apparently I was yelling ""THIS IS SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO COMFORTABLE!!!!"" 

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v28/annarb0r/lj11.jpg"">

I wouldn't shut up until someone else joined me.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v28/annarb0r/lj8.jpg"">

I picked up!

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v28/annarb0r/lj9.jpg"">

Lisa told me she was going to the pool tables, but I thought that she said Poacher. So we all went to the poacher and Lisa was at Joe Dogs! but then she met us there.

They wouldn't serve me at the poacher because I was using coasters as frisbees.

Then we went back and I passed out.

but, there is definitely one thing that can brighten my day...

KINDERGARTEN RELATIONSHIPS!

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v28/annarb0r/cute.jpg"">

"event","how come it seems that shitty things all happen at once? like you'll have a few months where everything goes awesome, and then in one week everything just comes crashing down and 2345908 things go wrong... or is that just how things seem to happen to me?

so in 2001 my grandfather had cancer in his throat... he only smoked cigars back in the day, but he worked in the steel factories. he had a 49/51 chance of surviving and he did! he had radiation... but the radiation made it so that he no longer had any salvia or taste, which meant he couldnt eat many solid foods and had to drink those ensure drinks for the rest of his lives. but he beat it! and they say that after 5 years if there are no signs of the cancer coming back, you can say that you are cured!!

so now it's 2006, and he went for his last x-ray, and he was pretty confident that he had beaten it! but now, two months later, they said that the x-ray showed that he now has lesions on his lungs.  i think thats so sad! i mean, how must it feel to think that you have beaten cancer, and to have lived the past five years drinking milkshakes, having no saliva and no taste... and then they tell you that its back.  it makes me so sad. and for lung cancer you can't go to radiation, you have to go to chemotherapy (i dont know if i spelled that right). but if you were 77 years old, would you want to go through chemo?..... i dont know. 

to add to that, my job is so stressful. it's my first time being a boss.. and i have 10 staff that i have to train everyday from 9-5 by myself. I hvae to think of topics and ideas and lessons.. and its just so stressful!! on tuesday i forgot all of my lesson plans at home, so when i got there i just had to try and remember what i had planned, and yesterday i planned an hour and a half with a guest speaker... and then 5 minutes before we were about to begin they told me that their car broke down and couldnt make it! i almost had a heartattack.. what was i going to do with my staff for 1.5 hours to fill in that void?

i just feel like nothing is going my way latley. it seems to always happen to me like this... i'll feel pretty happy, and then i'll go through 2 week period where EVERYTHING goes wrong, and i can pretty much come up with a list of 25 things.  i'd rather have my bad luck spread out then having it all happen at once. 

grrrrrrr."

for my job this summer we've had to run one playday EVERYDAY this week and they are killllllling me... its sooo long and hot, and you never get a break! theres always kids constantly coming and you have to explain the same thing 12 times in a row....

i did the parachute station for 2 days in a row but that almost killed me.. so i moved on to the obstacle course... but after having to demonstrate it 12 times yesterday my whole body is killing! I'm going to fall apart..

i decided to stop trying.  

i really need to get out of this place. sometimes i feel like it suffocates me here, as stupid as that may sound.  i always feel so much pressure from everything.. i just want to go out and be free.  being in school totally sucks.. it traps me here for another year.

"event","do you know what sucks? when you start to feel old.  i never thought that i'd see the day! i guess thats just something that happens to the best of us...

lately when we go to hess or other bars i always feel so old compared to most of the people there... but i guess i am turning 22 so a three year age gap can be a pretty big difference.

i was looking around my room the other day, and it was the first time that i felt like i had really ""grown out of it.""  i have tons of posters and pictures from magazines on my wall still, and a big collage of pictures from highschool... but as i was looking at the pictures i realized that i only still talk to about two of the people in them.  so i think that im going to take everything down, paint, and just put up a few frames and some modest mouse and postal service posters.

today i realized that this is the last time in my life where it will be acceptable to do nothing without being considered a bum.  i start my summer job on may 23, after that its back to school for another year, and then i graduate and am forced to find a full-time job for the next 40 years.  ive become such a sloth since school has ended and i love it! adam and i have been riding our bikes everyday, its so fun.  we rode to mapleview without taking into account how far it actually is! im going to miss doing stupid things like that when im working everyday. 

growing up is scary!"

since when did livejournal become so high tech? Voice posts? what the hell is that? where have I been?

anyways, i decided to reunite with this livejournal, or LJ, as i like to call it at times because i had the WEIRDEST night and i want to remember it as long as i live. whenever i have a bad day and think that live sucks, im just going to look back on this night and realize that everything is okay.

so, let me organize this highschool english class style.

setting: fiesta mall / bowlerama parking lot

characters: myself, adam, mary & enzy.

how come it seems that the weirdest stuff happens when you are fucked up?... has anyone ever been really messed up and then something happens and you think ""WHY is this happening NOW!!!!""? well that pretty much sums up my night in a nutshell..

so i guess we decided we wanted a blast from the past, because we went to bowlerama for the evening.

i think that i knew that the night was going to be pretty weird, since it started off with adam going to take a pee behind bowlerama and him coming back yelling ""YO!!! THERES BIOHAZARDOUS WASTE BEHIND BOWELRAMA! LETS CALL THE POLICE! LETS TELL SECURITY!!!""

we walk into bowlerama to see... girls dancing on chairs to barbie girl by Aqua.  okay, first off, is it even possible to look hot dancing to barbie girl by Aqua? and secondly, if it is possible to look hot, would you still look hot if you were dancing at BOWLERAMA?

we were waiting in line, and the girls infront of us were dancing like beyonce. 

but anyways, we get our shoes and i realize i didnt have socks! which is probably the worst thing to realize when you are going bowling. 

mary and i decide to go to the washroom.. we walk in and realize there are PEOPLE HAVING SEX IN THE STALL.

okay, since when did bowlerama turn into a night club??? dancing on chairs.. now sex in the bathroom?...

once then people realized that we had come in the stall, they tried to cover it up like they were just talking. ""soo.. what are you doing tomorrow?""... because you know, whenever you want to have an intimate conversation, bowlerama bathroom is definitely the top choice.

so we left the bathroom, and went back to bowl.  I put on bowling shoes over my shoes... i pretty much looked like i had GINORMOUS feet.

we started bowling... then i thought that I heard Enzy say ""im going to bowl overhand!""... and for some reason i found the thought of overhand bowling hilariuos. i told ads and we were howling. so when enzy went up to bowl, we started chanting ""OVERHAND!!!!""

well, apparently enzy has overhand bowling experience, because the he threw the ball sooo high that it hit a sign hanging from the ceiling and cracked down to the alley... soo funny.

as i was waiting for my turn, i turned around to see adam throwing coathangers in the garbage for no apparent reason haha. 

then adam decided that he wanted to dive down the alley with the ball, so he slid, and got up and came back and was like ""ITS SO GREASY! THE ALLEY IS SO GREASY!!!! I CANT BELIEVE IT!!! MY HANDS ARE SOO GREASY!"" haha it was funny.

well our bowling time came to an end, and as we were leaving we were like ""what if we just leave our shoes on the table and walk out?""

but no one had any balls to do that.. then i realized i forgot my shoes, so i went back, and adam thought that i was going to put my shoes on the table, and he got all excited ""i knew you wouldnt disappoint me! lets go!"" haha but i had to burst his bubble and be like ""oh i just forgot my shoes""

so we go outside to see that people needed a boost.  so we went to get adams car, and he showed me the biohazardous waste (IT DOES EXIST!)

adam went to boost the car, and this guy came up to us as we were waiting and was like ""YO! im going to take 15 painkillers in my car, BRB!""

by this point i couldnt even understand what was going on... hazardous waste, ""CLUB BOWLERAMA"" complete with chair dancing & bathroom sex, painkillers... WHY doesnt any of this happen when you're normal??

so the boost was unsuccessful, so the people started pushing their car up and down the parking lot.. which looked really funny. we stood and contemplated what to do...

then we decided to go back to fiesta.  there was a weird car parked, so we parked at blockbuster. adam started talking about the biohazardous waste, and mary and enzy didnt believe him. so he was like ""im going to PROVE IT!""

so we went back down highway 8 and parked at PETVET. we went behind petvet into this ""hills have eyes"" alley.  we walked back to the hazardous waste. everyone believed us now. 

adam was like ""LOOK AT THAT CAT!""... and he went to see this ""cat"" across the parking lot which turned out to be a skunk.

we walked back to the car and started driving. then we were like ""LETS GET ICECREAM!!!"", or for all of you dane cook fans, ""LETS GET SOME YUM YUMSssss""

we drove to the new mcdonalds, and as we were going to the drivethru, we looked in and saw that there is a FIREPLACE with ARMCHAIRS!!!!!! SINCE WHEN does mcdonalds have a FIREPLACE????... and how come i didnt notice it BEFORE???

i couldnt stop laughing about the fireplace.  ordering was a mess, we were like ""can we have one mcflurry... make that two. actually, make that three. and oh, one more... size.. small"" .. 

i decided that i wanted to treat everyone, but all i had was my visa. so we put 4 ice creams on the visa. 

then we parked, and threw our lids out the window. ""FUCK LIDS... i feel so much more free this way!""

then adam started talking about the garbage can at eastgate mall called ""ricky recpricol!"" ... no one believed him.  

as we got on to highway 8 to drive back to fiesta, adam was like ""I feel like im driving a space ship!! who cares about the rules of the road!"" ... thats always a good sign. haha

so we went to fiesta, and went into enzy's car to watch the christopher walken dvds on SNL.  that was hilarious. 

what a night! it may not seem that crazy, but if you were there you'd understand!!!!

as for other news, the teachers strike is over. i'm real glad that they went on strike for smaller class sizes, since my class only has 4 people left in it... lets downsize that to 2!

"event","I'm convinced that I have the WORST LUCK of anybody else and I can prove it.

Take today for example..

I have this  HUGE presentation that I have to present in sign language for 10 minutes on Deaf Education.  I have actually prepared for this assignment, and I memorized my whole speech!

I have a class at 9, but I take the 7:55 train even though it gets me to the station at 8:50 and I have to rush.  I arrived at the station, everything was peachy keen.

On a sidenote, I have been wanting a pair of jeans from Guess that have some rips in them.

Now back to my story.

So everyone gets off the train and theres a HUGE mob trying to get down the stairs.  I decide that I don't have time to waste, and follow some people who are crossing the tracks to get to another staircase where there are no people.  I start crossing the track, trip over it, and fall, slamming my knee into the curb, and alas, ripping my jeans. (hey i said i wanted ripped jeans didnt i..)

Since I wiped out infront of a HUGE mob of people, I didn't want them to know that I actually hurt myself. So I went downstairs, and on to the street. Then I decided to check out the damage. It was GROSS! My shin was gushing blood everywhere, my jeans were all bloody.

I went to school and went to first aid where they bandaged me up.

To make a long story short, I did a shitty presentation because I was in so much pain, with my one pant leg rolled up, and a huge bloody piece of gauze covering my ginormous gash for the whole world to see.   My teacher hands me my mark and I failed by 1%.

Then I go back to first aid to get them to change my gauze, and he looks and my leg and says ""eeee i think you need stitches!""

GREAT.

so now to make this horrible day even worse, im going to get stitches. AND im afraid of needles.

 

how's that for bad luck?"

"event","Wow... it feels like its been forever since I've updated this.  I've started to update it in the past, but then I always delete it as soon as post it.  I used to have so much fun with this thing, and it's awesome to read back on all of these entries that I probably would have forgotten have even happened since I smoke too much weed.

I think I used to write in this more when I was more naive and thought that everyone was a good person, and just read my livejournal because they were my friend and wanted to know what is up with me. Now it's almost like I don't want to post anything remotely personal becuase I don't really want anyone knowing my business.  As bitchy as that may sound, recently I've learned that the more people know the more trouble it gets you into.  

Anyways, enough with that.

I'm at school right now waiting for my 1 o'clock class to start. I love the wonderful go-train schedule that arrives at union on the :07, so if I have a class at 1 I have to catch the train at 11:20 to get me here at 12:07.  Why can't they make trains come in on the :30.. doesn't that make more sense?

In other news, theres this really cool thing at the ex starting this weekend.  They have all of these haunted houses and halloween-themed attractions, and a midway with a ton of rides that you can go on as much as you want once you get the bracelet. I think that it's called Fear Fest or something.  Wonderland has something similar to it, but Wonderland is soo far to drive, especially with this shitty weather and gas prices. 

I'm also going to the leafs game on December 7. I've never been to a hockey game, and I've never really been interested in it, but I watch them with Adam and they are actually pretty entertaining! He jokingly told me to get him a Halloween present, so I bought him hockey tickets just to be fun and cute. 

Since my school is so messed up, I'm only taking half of the classes this year.  I only have to go to class on monday, wednesday and friday.  Tuesdays and Thursdays I have off and work for the YMCA after school program again.  Then I'm off from the last week of October until the first week of December becuase my year has a block placement that I can't take because I failed a class.  A month off of school.. what more could I ask for!! (wow that was cheesy).

My birthday is coming up in two months... hopefully I actually make it to the bar this time! I'd be satisfied with even the enterance, and then maybe next year I can actually go in.  Anything is better than a stairwell !!! (Mad props to cometty for taking care of me that night haha... SCHMITTYYYY)

Anyways, I'm going to go and check what kind of soup they have in the caf.  Keep it real live journalerrrrrrrrs.

so i failed my interpreting course at school because of this big discrepency with my exam, and the teacher ended up giving me a big fat ZERO which = FAILURE. i tried to johnny cochrane my way out of it, but the teachers didnt believe me.  so alas, i'll graduate in 2007.  BOOO-URNS.

im working at STAR & YMCA after school program until july, and then i'm interpreting at the YMCA camps for july/august for the deaf campers.. should be interesting.

last night adam and i went to see AMITYVILLE HORROR! i was sooo scared. i had to cover my face for most of it.. it was creepy.  we decided it was definitely crazy.scary.cool (CSC)

ITS 4.20 today which means that me, squid, and furry bear are going to smoke our faces off at club st.clare.  and i'll probably go and buy candy from big bear, much like i've been doing for the past 2 months.  sometimes vern gives it to me for free because he's awesome and recgonizes that i'm awesome. other times he puts porn on in the store. you know how it goes. 

im turning nocturnal again... i dont work everyday until at LEAST 4 which means that i don't wake up until at least 12... 

i think i smoke too much weed.. if thats possible? I honestly think that i'm losing my mind.

fuck your words for sounding so sweet
fuck my mind for comparing you to everyone i meet
fuck your lips for always kissing me just right
fuck my eyes for making you the only one in sight
fuck my stupidity for falling for your lines
fuck your personality for perfectly matching mine
fuck your hands for being so addicting to hold
fuck your comments for being so cold
fuck my heart, my feelings, my dreams -- im through
i think that the underlying meaning here is FUCK YOU

"event","so last night i lost my mind...

here are a few examples to prove it...

* kristen and i bringing the kitchen table onto the front lawn as a ""gift"" for kristens roomates, complete with chairs and kraft dinner waiting... they werent too happy

* turning into a clepto and walking out of a guys house with a chair cushion, vase, gel, roll of toliet paper... feeling bad about it.. putting the cushion in the tree... and the vase on a pole and painting an arrow pointing up under it just so that they werent confused as to where it was

* this guy being a really big jerk, so me seeking revenge by getting the toliet brush and touching all of the door handles in the house with it... and sticking the plunger to the mirror

* a guy asking us if we wanted a ""cock sandwich without any bread"" and me saying ""I DONT EAT ROOSTER YO"" and then having him say ""oh so do you eat pussy"" and me saying ""NO I AM COMPLETELY A-SEXUAL""... and then screaming walking away screaming ""YOU ARE PROBABLY WEARING LEVI STRATUS JEANS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!""

* walking around with the broom and leaving it in the front bushes

* painting SV on kristen's car, recycling bin, tree, TV....


and if you dont believe me..

"event","last night kevin and i randomly went to niagara falls... it was SO RANDOM haha.  we stayed at this motel right on clifton hill. the guy that worked the front desk was sooo boring.. his name was kern.  he became the punchline of many of our jokes throughout the night.  we also had quite a few cracks at the bounty hunter. 

i have honestly never smoked so much in my life.  we were so high.  everything was ice, and we walked (slid) down the falls.  i took a MAJOR wipeout haha... we were playing bumper cars on the ice and being SOO loud and we didnt even notice this huge group of tourists behind us... im sure that they thought that we were insane.

then we went back up the street and went into this funhouse... the girl was like 'it's 10.00 each'... and i was going to pay for us, so i was willing to pay 20.00... then i was like 'we need discounts!"" so she went onto the computer (which took FOREVER) and finally was like ""16.00 is the lowest i can go)... and i was like ""NO THAT IS TOO MUCH ... LETS LEAVE"" and kevin was like ???? then i realized that 16.00 was actually LOWER than the original 20 i was going to pay.  im such an idiot.

the fun house was CRAZZY hahah it was fun.  i dont even remember half of it.  then we went back to the room and arranged all of the furniture into a giant fort.  we got really high again.. then we decided to go to the casino. 

i dont even know how they let us in... my eyes were soo small i looked like i was chinese.  kevin actually won 9$.. i lost all of my money.  

we got whoppers.. and then came back and smoked more.

IT WAS SO MUCH FUN.. AHhhhhhh. thats all im going to say. ""AHHHHHH""

here's hoping."

"event","going on the theme of my last entry, GIRLS ARE FUCKING LAAAMMME.

yo check out this situation

my exboyfriend dates this crazy girl for 3 years and she wont let him talk to me... like once i said hi to him at kingdom and she was like ""DONT FUCKING TALK TO HIM.""... then they break up and i see him and we hang out.  HANG-OUT.  not date.. not makeout.. not nothing.  JUST HANG OUT.  

so today i was bored so i got high, and i was like ""I am going to relax."" the whole afternoon was peaceful. it was like deer were coming in my room and i had squirrels on my shoulders and there was a giant rainbow outside... THEN all of my peaceful relaxfulness was SHATTERED when my phone rang.  it read: UNKNOWN NAME PRIVATE NUMBER.  since my mind was a giant fog, i wasnt suspicious

then the girl was like sarah?

and i was like oh brother here we go.

yes it was the ex's CRAZY exgirlfriend. she proceeded to tell me if i ever talk to justin again, she is going to, and i quote ""slit my throat, bend your knees backwards and rip your tits off""... this quite impressive quote was followed by making sure her point was clear, ""you got it bitch?""

since i was high out of my face, and entirely in shock, i just hung up.  then she called back but i picked up and hung up.

and i'll be honest, maybe i was alittle scared by this.  OKAY maybe i was really scared. maybe i called kevin and work and told him i was going to die.  

this does make me kind of edgy.  i've never been threatened before.. and no one has ever wanted to kill me (at least that i know of).  like i dont want to be scared to see her at kingdom or something.  

so back to my main point.. GIRLS ARE LAAAAAAAAAAAAME.  i'm so sick of immature games that girls play. like i could neeeeeeever call some girl my ex was dating and be like ""YO IM GOING TO TIE YOU TO A TREE AND BEAT YOU WITH STICKS"".... sooooooooo gay.  i'll never understand it."

"event","so new years is tomorrow. we're going to adrift for the rockbox.. it should be okay.  im not expecting much, since ive never really had a good new years. they started going downhill in grade 10 when i got thrown out of the hall by myself for drinking wine underage.  

so im going to make the best of it.  making the best of it means actually showing up.  unlike my birthday party, which im sure everyone knows by now i didnt make it to because i was passed out in a stairwell.  but i still had a wicked time after i had an epiphany and woke up, and mad props to emily and karl fuckin wojiechowski for making my night fun.  i'd also like to thank whoever took the picture of me post-fight with the christmas tree, where i had an evergreen branch still hanging from my scarf. 

everyone can check out the hilariousness here: http://public.fotki.com/annarb0rr/my_birthday/

theres 9 people left in my program at school.  one of these 9 people is this girl who is incredibly lame.  is wanting to be civil at school instead of engaging in stupid highschool drama really too much to ask? apparently it is.  shes from like 3.5 hours from here, but she goes to school in toronto.  i used to be friends with her, until she lost her mind.  so anyways, shes dating this guy from here that i used to like.  i knew all along that she was, but she didnt tell me, instead she took the incredibly mature approach of making her msn names about him.  obviously, im not 13 so im not going to respond and be like ""BIIIIIIIITCH"" because i honestly could care less.  i havent liked this particular guy since september.  but this girl is so insane that she is convinced i am SO jealous, and that their relationship is eating away at me.  so she made her msn name ""NEW YEARS IN THE CREEK"" and i was like oh brother.  so i asked her about it, and she was all like ""JEALOUS ARE WE"" and i was like whaaaaaaat.  and i proceeded to say, ""im not mad that you guys are dating, i could care less. i just think its lame you couldnt tell me and just made really stupid msn names"" and to this, she had the intelligent response of ""you're not worth my time."" this is when i officially gave up, and all hope of being grown up about this went out the window.  so i blocked and deleted her, and she responded quite maturely by changing her msn name to ""SOME PEOPLE ARE SO IMMATURE"" which obviously, is not immature at all. so now im going to have to go to school, and watch her prance around thinking that i am so bothered by this.  i dont understand how some people are... it really blows my mind.

ah well, i guess thats just how it goes.

you know it kills me to see such a pretty girl so tired
you've got your mothers cheekbones and your fathers crooked smile
forget all those places that you've never really been
and all of those situations you somehow found yourself in
let your body sink into me like your favourite memory
like a line of poetry or a fuckin fit of honesty
i'll do my best to keep you, keep you sleepy as the south
with my old watch on your wrist and my thumbs inside your mouth
suck on my finger tips and until you kill all my prints
so your boyfriend has no clue of how much ive been touching you

my problem with me is my problem with you
it doesnt take much for me to come unglued
i put my headphones on and hear your favourite songs
and it kills me to know that this wont be one of them

you know it saves me to think that even for alittle while
i own the set of shoulders that you came to rely on
like in that movie theatre when you whispered in my ear
""I almost didnt make it, this has been my hardest year""
your job is killing you faster than a cancer could
so now you're giving up just like they said you would
you've got that old map out now
and you've found the farthest town
you hope that if you're lucky this is where you'll settle down

i dont care where you move
i dont care if its far
all that i ask is that i know where you are
incase our timing is right
incase you need more from me
than a bit of advice
or a tongue full of sympathy"

"event","im so lazy to clean my room that i have absolutely nothing to wear.  the clothes pile has escalated into a mountain.  you'd think i'd learn my lesson when i had a party a few saturdays ago, and i was in my room feeling sick and people kept coming into check on me, and they were like ""so, you know theres underwear on your floor.  I love those orange ones!"" and i was like AHH

my mom told me that shes going to start bringing a cell phone into my room with her incase she gets lost in the clothes pile. 

i just have no motivation to do anything.  i dont think its because i dont have any time, because i do have time.  i just waste it.  i waste it on msn,sleeping, and dewitt tim hortons. and reading my new stack of books that i went out and bought after i broke up with kevin.  

everyone is dating someone now.  and i thought that summer was the time for love!! even karl.  i decided that im dating school.  its definitely a non-physical relationship.  

i also bought another confessions of a shopaholic.  even though i find alot of it far-fetched, its pretty cute and funny.

today me and bean handed out halloween candy.  although shes the cutest 7 pounds of fur i've ever seen, i think that she came across as a scary beast.  a kid would walk up our walkway, and see bean and say ""AW!! THAT DOG IS SO CUTE!"" then as the kid came within 2 feet, bean would have a HEARTATTACK.. like she was barking sooooo loud. then the kid would jump, look like it was going to cry, and run to the next house. i felt bad.  but it was kind of funny.  maybe i was laughing alot.

okay this is pointless. im going to shower and get gas. (I'll just clairfy: FOR MY CAR) i was talking to this nerd on msn and i said i needed to go and get gas and he was like ""what are you constipated?"" .... people are so funny these days. :/"

"event","man.  is livejournal even cool anymore? am i losing cool points by posting in here instead of my ultra punkrockxcore to the max extreme myspace account? 

i was reading back through some of my entries, and now i kind of regret not posting in awhile.  it was cool to look back and read all of the stupid things i've done in the past few years, and also realize how hilariously funny i was/am.

so i havent posted a real entry in about two months.  so lets cover the basics, shall we?

school started.  its alot better this year, and also alot harder.  we're actually interpreting now, but only consecutively.  that means that we watch someone sign, and then they stop the tape and we have two minutes to translate it into english.  its kind of hard but i love it.

i had a boyfriend for about a month.  it was really fun while it lasted. his name was kevin and he lives in etobicoke.  i met him at emilys birthday party in september.  as i was making cheese sandwiches out of bread for fondu, and wrapping myself in streamers, he appeared.  then, when this guy at the party put cheese in my pants and i FREAKED, kevin backed me up and it was love.  it was a fun relationship, we used to have sleepovers a few times a week. we went to this improv show and this comedy show. we would hotbox the bathroom and watch movies.  but alas, that all ended on the cold night of two fridays ago, when someone came between us.  yes, this relationship destroyer was an old friend of mine, who i hadnt hung out with in awhile.  FIRST NAME: GOLD, LAST NAME: SCHLAGGER.

i got reaaaaaaallly drunk and we got into our first fight.  THEN, when i said ""NICE RANDY RIVER SWEATER"" that was the last straw, because obviously it wasnt randy river.  he told me to FUCK OFF, and walked away. i continued walking, and then i turned around and realized he wasnt there. and i was lost. and alone.

so, to make a long story short, there was a woman and her husband, a man driving my car, a big fight, me being a big bitch.  then came the phone call at work the next morning, ""I dont think this is working out."" and that was the end of that.  okay, maybe it didnt end so easily.  obviously there was alot of me saying ""WHY!"" and trying to imply that he was making the biggest mistake of his life.  but as we can see now, by my SINGLE status on myspace, it didnt work.

do i miss him?  kind of.  i moreso miss us. i miss writing cheesy emails, and alphabet poems. and having him think i was funny and cute.  but i mean, i guess maybe i just miss having a boyfriend.  we got along well, but there are people that i've dated that i've been much more into.

ben is back from BC for a few weeks, but he has a girlfriend. yes, its the ben you're thinking of.  and since im laying it all on the line here, i had the biggest crush on him for at least 2 months and 17 days.  

im interested in a few people, but its all deadends.  

I still hang out with this guy that i met in may.  we're friends now, but we like eachother and cant understand why. 


im on reading week, and my last three nights are a blur.  

there was the sambuca in st catherines with kristen, consisting of drinking the whole bottle by myself, smoking a joint, and us laying on the floor laughing hysterically in a ball before we went to the club.  then i went up to this crowd of ginos and told them that i was the biggest gino EVER. and i love euro house and all i wear is diesel.  they thought i was so cool, but let it be known, i was a FRAUD.  

i guess i really liked sambuca, because i hung out with it again, on thursday night.  at humber, with emily and gwynne (WHITE WOMEN!!!!!!!).  i think that we white women-ed half the bar.  i was dressed like a school girl.  i kissed a guy who was dressed like a girl, and then told kevin's friend ""DONT TELL KEVIN THAT I KISSED THE GUY/GIRL!"" so now kevin probably thinks that i was so distraught over our breakup that ive moved on to transsexuals.  and on a side note, a big THANK YOU to emily for putting up with me when im drunk. i  know its not an easy task, and many people have quit.  but for some reason, you've stuck around, and dont even cringe when you see me drink a whole bottle like a tank.  and for that i owe you (along with the 100$)

and then there was last night. i was planning to stay home because i felt like ass. but then ines showed up with gold schlagger and rum.  we were trying to go to kingdom, but of course no one listened to me when i said ""WE HAVE TO GO EARLY!!!!!!!!!! OMG!SFDSsakflj"" my friends were like ""MEH"".  so when we rolled in at 1030, and the line up was hueg and there was no parking, we obviously didnt get in.  so we went to splash.  this guy that liked me from humber night was there.  but i kind of ignored him.  oh well.

so thats my life in a nutshell. as of now.

today im going to the library.  im making joel come with me.  and then im taking him to value village. its a reasonable trade-off.

and then my grandma decided she wants to be up to date with technology, so she ordered a sympatico high-speed modem because it came with a cell phone.  and she NEEDS a cell phone, because she calls my grandpa to pick her up from the grocery store, and you know, pay-phones are SO last season.

i'm out

take care kids"

today's lesson is on friends and ""friends"".  lately, some people have been moved into the ""friends"" category

let me illustrate what a ""friend"" is

- mysteriously stops answering their cell phone when they used to answer it all the time before; (also, when you were out with them, you watched them not answer it when certain people would call, and now they think that you won't realize they are doing the exact same thing to you)

- are superly fake nice when they see you, and are so ""happy"" to see you, but you know that they were just talking about you for the past 47 hours before you showed up

- don't call you to come out, but when someone else invites you and you show up they are like ""IM SO HAPPY YOU CAME"" 

- ask you where you've been and why you haven't been out with them lately, like they care, but the whole time you've been trying to get a hold of them but they mysteriously haven't been around.

FUCK THAT SHIT.

i'm sick of all of the fucking fake losers that live around here.  get some balls and tell me you have a problem with me.  it honestly pisses me off so much that people can't just be straight up and we have to play all these games like we are still in highschool.

apparently if the kids at work crack open the firehydrant and turn the street into a giant pool, and new kids see this new pool and open fire hydrant and before you can say ""DONT GO INFRONT OF IT!"" the kids run infront of the water and the pressure is so high that it knocks them over and they get carried down stream and you have to fish them out continuously for 2 hours, and then a children's aid society van drives by and sees you playing in this big street-pool, and tells your boss, your boss won't be too happy.

life is great!

this weekend me sheena maryanne went camping!
it was kind of last minute... so we forgot a few things... such as... oh i dont know.. forks, spoons, knives, sleeping bags... pillows..

we also arrived at our campsite at night. so it took us 2 hours to set it up, and we set it up wrong.  it was so wrong that it wouldnt even close.  so you can imagine the bug nest it turned into at night.

we also couldnt start our fire, so we waited until the neighbours went to bed and then we put their fire.  but then i realized i had nothing to serve the hotdogs with.. so i stuck them in beer bottles and saranwrap and served them like that.

the rest of the weekend was just hilarious.  somehow 4 girls managed to drink a 24, 12 woodys, 4 pur source and a 26er of rye, and smoke a quarter of weed.  nonetheless, my mind is still in a fog.



so i love my job.  i get there, and i get a half hour break.  then i do a game... half hour break. another game, half hour break... an hour and a half lunch.. etc.  did i mention we get paid for all our breaks? HA!



SO.  i was talking to my friend fuz from pennsylvania.  did i mention how crazily beautiful fuz is? anyways, so i was talking to fuz and he was like ""YO you should come down for boston warped tour i'll get you in!"" and im like WHAAAT.  and there are 2 dates in boston, the 19th and 20th of august!! hes like ""come and party with me and bigwig and a bunch of other bands."" but i'd much rather just party with him. SO.. im going to go on a roadtrip to boston from the 19th to 21st of august!! and im bringing my hot, trusty friend emily along for the ride :) its going to be AWESOME

he also might come down for wakestock for august long weekend in wasaga, since im working at it. :D

anyways, thats about all thats new.

now im going to bond with jamesy pie.  have a nice night everyone!"

update eh.

i'm not seeing that guy anymore. he told last week before i went camping with my staff for training that we were never going to date. and then i was like oh, okay. and then he proceeded to say that it was frustrating because he didnt know any girls that he wanted. and i was like AHEM!?!?... so then he walks me to my car and KISSES ME GOOD-BYE? and im like uh, what are you doing. and he said ""i'm still allowed to kiss you!""... NO.. actually you ARENT. and then he's like.. ""call me when you get back from camping""

WHAT THE FUCK is that?! 

so then yesterday i was on msn, and he messaged me and was like hey, im sorry about last week. i really did like you but our personalities are too different, and so are our interests.

all i had to say to that was ""i hope you find someone more like you.""

then he's like. ""so do you want to get together soon?""

and i was like ""maybe. im busy. i'll see what i can do. my ride is here.. later!""

i'm sorry.. but if you're going to break it off, break it off. don't attempt to kiss me goodbye and hang out with me a week later.  


ANYWAYS>

camping was great.  the staff aren't as loserish as I originally suspected. camping was actually pretty fun.  alot of swimming and campfires and eating, and not alot of training, which was awesome.

the funniset thing was when we were doing a scavenger hunt, and one of the things to find was ""something that stars with Q!"" so me and my partner found a dead bird and brought it back and said ""its a QUAIL!"" but they didn't accept it due to grossness.

another funny thing was when we were in the lake and the waves were HUGE and i thought i was going to die, so i held on to my boss, and i thought that he kept going underwater just to bug me, but it turns out i was really drowning him.

then there was the time when i wanted to make the camp fire so huge that everyone was sitting around the fire and this HUGE gust of wind came and blew flaming pieces everywhere, and everyone almost caught on fire.


i came back on friday.  on friday night me, mary, sheenie, ines and val went to mardi gras at hess. i saw alot of people i knew. but besides that, i thought that it was WAY too packed to have fun.  i didnt like all of the people.

but even though it sucked so much on friday, we decided to go back yet again on saturday.  this time was better. i met a guy.. he wasnt my typical guy.  he's italian, and he was wearing a split jacket and puma shoes. but he's kinda gino-ish.  which is strange for me.  but he was really cute and nice.  we hung out with him and his friends last night, so we'll see how that goes.

in family updates, my dad sent me this wonderful email. he was obviously drunk when he wrote it, since his typing was all weird.  but to sum it up, he stated that he was 'giving up on me' and that i only go and visit him 'when i want money'.  that statement pissed me off the MOST, because he doesnt pay child support.  and the only time he gives me money is my birthday and christmas.  my fucking GRANDMOTHER pays for half my car insurance, and my go train passes to school.  thats something that your dad should pay for.  parents are so stupid sometimes.


but anyways, on that joyous note, im going to bed.

have a good one!


ps. everyone go to funky munky on wednesday for kristens birthday! 2.50 beers.. you cant go wrong!"

i fell asleep tonight !! and i woke up now.  how much does that suck? I wasted my whole friday night.

ive realized that with having a huge group of friends, comes a whole lot of politics.  I'm kind of sick of it all.  I also realized that people I thought I knew so well, I dont really know at all.

so that guy that i really liked isn't going anywhere.  i dont understand how a few weeks ago he said we were seeing eachother to see if we should go out or not, and then on monday he said we were both ""enjoying the single life.""  so ive basically stopped calling, texting and messaging him all together.  it was a really big kick in the ass because i was trying so hard, and i thought that we were actually getting somewhere. once again i was wrong.
..

one of the kids at work told me i had clown hair. i was pissed :@ then they all started pointing at me and saying ""CLOWN HAIR""
..

so i hung out with eamon.  hes back from bc.  hes such a breath of fresh air... sooo random. i love it.  its such deja vu from last summer though.  

..

on wednseday kristen and i smoked so much weed and then went to eastside marios. i ate a whole funnel cake, 2 pieces of bruschetta, some chicken wings.. it was a diaster.  i wasnt just eating though.. it was all over my face. i was eating like a wolf.  i really need to stop that.


..


so yeah. thats my life right now.  im kind of getting bored with it, i need a change. something new to think about.  im doing my best to block out that guy but its so hard.  whenever im bored im so tempted to call him and be like, im bored im coming over.  :(


ah well.  im used to be screwed over :D


<i> and its just my luck to end up getting stuck to everything you are. <i>

<b>"" so dont go worrying about me.. its not like i think about you constantly [so maybe i do]... but that shouldnt effect your life anymore. i knew it the moment you walked into the door. and i let you get the best of me.. because there's nothing else that i do well.  i'll be the giver and you'll be the taker, i guess thats how this one's gonna go.  i'll be the giver and you'll be the taker... you've got me down on my knees and i'll proclaim all hail the heartbreaker..."""

i love my friends

what a great night!

i think i had too many shots though.  rum > fireball > beer > butterscotch something.  wow.  

we went to splash! i lost my fucking cell phone though.  it really sucks becuase if i found a cell phone i would so give it to the bartender or something. so now i have to buy a new one, which is awful since im SO BROKE.  i just HAD to buy those volcom jeans and WE sweater on friday.  

<u> highlights </u>

> ordering 5 shots and forgetting to pay
> me laughing and accidently spitting all over the subway window
> anita's playtex man
> the teacher
> walking back from splash to the hotel
> maryanne sleeping and eating a sub at the same time
> the doritos


it was so much fun. it was one of those great nights where you wake up the next morning and are like ""LIFE IS GREAT!""

then on our way home we went to shoppers to pick up our pictures. i was wearing flowered pyjama pants and my hot pink dress shoes.  some man told me that my butt crack was showing. shoppers had free hotdogs, so there we were, with our makeup on from the night before, eating hotdogs infront of shoppers. 

then we went to the beach.  and then we had a BBQ! what a weekend of bonding. even though i get frustrated sometimes, i love my friends! im really looking forward to the summer now.



....

so everyday when i drive home from work, i pull out this street. and people are always looking at me weird and honking at me, and i can never figure out why.  so the other day, i was driving and someone honked at me again.  then some man stuck his head in my car and was like ""WRONG WAY GIRL!!!""

i found out that for the past week i've been driving the WRONG WAY on a one way street.

only me.  onnnnnnnllllllllly me."

20 minutes later, we're in burlington booking a hotel.  random? I LOVE IT!!! haha. the front desk girl gave us a room in the basement all the way at the end of the hall, which will be perfect so that people dont complain about noise.

ive just been casually hanging out with this guy, but we always dont hang out until at least 12, or 1 in the morning because he works.  

sooo... i dont really know anyone of my friends who want to go out at 1am.  

therefore, how am i shafting anyone? 

tonight i asked my friend to go out, and shes like ""why dont you just go out with him""... i was like ""WHAAAAAAT."" grr

anyways, i saw shrek 2.  it was HILARIOUS!!!!!!! i recommend it to everyone. definitely go and see it.  pure hilarity. and i had the best banana slushee EVER. woah woah.

so i cant believe its june already.  may went by SO fast.  it seems like i havent been to school in EVER.  and yet im still handing in assignments that my teachers apparently ""lost."" 

the cutest thing ever, this really chubby kid at my work, he was standing on the front mat. and im like ""what are you doing"" and hes like ""i keep saying abracadabra but it just wont fly!!"" i was like AWWWWWW holy cute.  so i told him to keep trying.

"event","so i havent updated this thing in so long that my background picture doesnt work, and now i have this new snazzy angelfire background.

i dont know what it is.  me and livejournal have drifted apart.  

not much has changed so much.  i work three jobs > LS, STAR and the YMCA.  the YMCA and star are with kids after school.  its alright, i think by the summer im going to be really sick of kids though haha.

so my mom gave me the jetta. which is awesome. I've been driving around like jeff gordon.  the ironic thing was as soon as i got my car, gas prices went up to 89.5! i pulled into the station all excited to fill up my first tank of gas, and then i looked up and was like WHAAAT?!?!. only me.  im convinced that im cursed. maybe its because i saw that black cat a few days ago.

this weekend i went to deaffest in toronto. it was pretty fun.  i bought a shirt that says ""ontario govn't opresses deaf"" with a giant shoe.  i think it makes a statement.

everyday me and bean have been walking 4km.  its awesome.  i lost some weight and now all of my pants fall off. today i put on my jeans, and then i went to do them up and i realized they were already done up! haha so i just like slid them on. i was like uhh.  im telling you though, you dont need atkins, nothing.  this is what i do:

*eat what you want (except fast food)
*only drink water
*dont eat after dinner
*exercise.

i swear it works.  


my lovelife is okay......... i like someone but i dont konw if they like me. and its really weird because before when i liked people, i was like meh. it was that i liked them but i didnt really care so much.  (aka mike, ben).  so when those didnt work out, i was like ah well.  but for some reason i actually LIKE this guy.  its weird.  i dont know if its going to work though. hes a tough nut to crack. :(

ah well. life goes on....... la la la life goes on."

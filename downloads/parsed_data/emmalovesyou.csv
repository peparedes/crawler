"event","greatest night ever last night i swear.
after school dana ryan and i layed in the back of dana's car. it was hot. i enjoyed it. then ryan's all HEY GUYS CAN I RIDE IN THE TRUNK? so he did.....but it was for longer than he expected. oh yeah. so people were concerned as he was screaming HELP HELP HELP ME SEXUAL ABUSE and oh god. not proud of it. you should've seen the faces guys.....ohmygoodness.
then we went and played dress up ryan and jeff in the gap. i must say, ryan can totally pull off zip-ups and jeff can totally pull off tight jeans. then they played dressup emma....that didn't go as well. emma learned that she doesn't have the rack for crossover tie thing shirts. 
met justine's boy allan. he's very nice. 
then i didn't try on a short white skirt with my white zip up and make ryan go crazy. thats absurd. and dana and i definately did not try on black boustiers and i wasn't wearing hot pink microsatin pants at the same time. also absurd.
then we saw meet the fockers. AAAAASSSSHHHH HOLE. hahahaha baby. i loved it.
and then!!!
we had.....
ORGASMIC CHEESECAKE
seriously i was excited. mocha kalhua cheesecake would excite you too i assure you of that.
we had such a good talk at the cheesecake cafe. it doesn't get any better than 4 friends having serious heart to heart conversations over cake in the city.

le sigh.

today ryan came over. i was going to go help mom and dad chop down trees at the property but yeah....mom gave us the option to stay home so thats what we did. but that was after ryan's blazer broke down on the gravel service road. mom let me take the envoy to go meet him. twas great. then trampoline fun times horray and pizza and now tatrina will be coming over for a sleepover. today was le great and makes up for yesterday morning ten fold.
.....and the masters are on and weir went from +1 to -3. great day."

i haven't updated in like a month.
its not like anyone will read this entry anyways, just for future reference i suppose. i'm very sad right now. so yeah, need stuff to do: write down everything thats happened in the last month it is.

- went to steph's birthday and it was only us two. woo i bought a white zip up because HELL ryan said he enjoyed the other one. i also bought pretty earings and a starbucks travel mug on whyte ave. does not get any classier than that my friends. then we went to her house and had cake and katrina was there and wow stephs green bra equals amazing
- went to ryan's house for the first time. yeah. i like his house. his mom is weird. she knows everything? makes me nervous.
- GOT A JOB WOHOO! i'm employed! oh em gee!
- had friends over last week. jeff dana tatrina jeff eva and steph. first, ryan came over and i can't remember what we did. OH RIGHT! cleaned my house. then jeff and dana came over. i lit candles and we had a classy dinner with strawberry daquiri's and panago pizza. then we spooned in my bed. that was marvelous minus the hands that were everywhere. then we had margaritas in coffee mugs. oh yeah. and then we watched A DIRTY DIRTY MOVIE with no sound and irish drinkin music. it was so disgusting. i hid under the blankets and didn't really watch it. then jeff and tatrina came over. then eva. went for a walk outside. eva jeff and dana smoked. ryan and i were like 'oookay, lets go get steph?' so we did. and she did the lurkin rapin thing to him. and he was creepered out.
blah i'll finish this later."

*jumps up and down repeatedly*

TODAY WAS GREAT.
so i wake up to lights across my wall BECAUSE DAD WAS DRIVING UP THE DRIVEWAY!!!!!!
but for other reasons for which i will no relate as they make me VERY UPSET/MAD, my morning sucked. but then i got to school. and ryan came up to me which made my day 100x better. but i couldn't yeah because i'm not for the whole third wheel business. then i met some of his friends. and then math. argh math....couldn't do anything right. and then french- every answer i gave was like wrong. the morning was so freaking long. 
but then for lunch ryan, tatrina, jeff, and i went out for pie. ryan always says that he likes pie and he wrote that in my year book so i was like WELL. it was wonderful. and then social class. all we did was watch funny video comercials and clips on the computer and look at some medieval and renaissance architecture and paintings. then i had a spare.
oh yeah. the grand am, shania twain, tatrina's sexy glasses, camomille tea, kiddie cones from dairy queen, and walking on the pond in the rotary park= such the wonderful hour.
and then i come home. kassidy was on the bus. HORRAY. shawn wasn't though......shawn i miss thee.
and yeah. i'm on the computer just doing nothing and thinking about how wonderful the text message i got from someone was and then the phone rings.
I HAVE A JOJB INTERVIEW ON FEBRUARY 23 @ 4:30!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I'M SO EXCITED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

AND LOST COMES ON TONIGHT."

KILL MY FEET. then i had to go to the garage to exchange my sweater. as soon as i got in there a girl working there is like 'hey hows it going!?!' and she just started talking to me about how her boyfriend bought her new shoes and about other stuff. her shoes were hot. then we did laundry. there were a bunch of creepers starin at me (not trying to get all vain)....i was like mom go buy some dilly bars and i'll watch the clothes and she's like i'm not leaving you alone here. don't want you to get raped in the laundromat :O then i drove home. i backed out of the parking lot in such a stupid way. it was so stupid and wrong. it was bad.
and now here i am. eating cheesecake. and talkin to not my lover. whatda weirdo. its fun.

i'm so upset that kiwi died. i feel even worse for chompers. he hasn't been alone for 4 years....awe. now he keeps chirping like he hopes that he will hear his buddy call back. breaks my heart it does. last week when the cat was in the house she jumped up onto the cage and knocked it over so we think kiwi broke something when that happened. then when i jump into the vehicle after leaving tatrina's yesterday, amy was like 'ooo emma dad says that you shouldn't go behind the garden shed'.... i was like wtf amy how dare you say that.

today after the dentist mom and i scowered 3 liquor stores looking for wine she had on a list recommended by the wonderful kevin brauch. i love that guy.

i must say dana and tatrina, your journal entries were v. deep.....

this mornin i was going to go to the doctor but i felded better and well enough to go to school and since i had madame m. permission to stay home for french i did :) and it was JUST MY LUCK that jude was on the view and was doing his last interview from his 6 movies. it was quite enjoyable. and clint black was on live. ah *sigh* went to school. we are starting to learn organic chem. EEK! oh my bio sucked soooo MUCH! so i finish my test, go back to me desk and my thumb is bleeding (quite a bit-blood all over work)so i get a kleenex. then like 5 minutes later, my eye starts tearing up for no reason. and then i get plauged with a bad cough and of course the room is sooo quiet so i try to surpress the coughing which makes the tearing a lot worse! AND THEN! 5 minutes later my nose was runny! AAAHHHH!!! it was like 'hey emma guess what? you were feeling fine but now that you have to be quiet you will welcome an onset of various embarasing ailments.

AND THEN! mom picked me up from school and we went to the property. *sigh* i'm so very excited guys. then i had to babysit ben. woo $12! for 4 hours. i was jipped. meh. hahahaha and then i called dad,
'so dad when are you coming home? cause like i would like to know because we need to know if we should start christmas-ifying the house and getting ready for a tree and since we need your truck...yeah...and we need to get mom presents'
'don't worry next weekend we will have a family day, maybe go see a movie on sunday, and get everything ready'
'so we can get a tree?'
'we can get anything you want'

today i degraded myself by buying a People magazine. well jude is the sexiest man and and i saw him and ty on ellen today so i thought i'd buy it.

""You can't have forgotten that steamy wet-shirt business in the BBC's Pride and Prejudice?(v.v.good)...""

it was supposed to be my day too. had a lot planned for me.

it started okay. i was happy because today was s'posed to be good. i saw mr.darcy smile, every answer i gave in french was right, and i had a very good laugh at lunch. but then in chem warren laughed at me(so of course all his gay friends laughed too), the dentist found cavities and disked another tooth. this time it was uncomfortable. went to safeway. saw amanda adam lacey and auntie linda. walked by these people in the produce isle to stand by mom and pick out peppers. didn't realize those people were the possbergs. god i'm an idiot. then i had an appointment and i get there and guess what! the lady forgot about me so she left(because she ripped her pants apparently) 

fucking lady ruining my day. so i made another appointment but i'm not going to go. or i will and say 'you forgot me' and then leave. i don't respond well to being forgotten.

mom is doing my hair right now. hahaha i did half of it myself but then got busy with homework and then was told it wasn't good enough so now i'm being proadded (hey stephanie correct me!) and in pain. drats.

just got off the telephone with dad. baha i told him i want to take french 30 next semester and he said it was okay with him and that he is cool if that is my choice and i said but dad you hate the french. he said yeah but i don't get in the way with your choice and i said but dad yes you do because you will not let me go to quebec. he then proceeded to laugh for quite a bit at his own hypocracy and my ingenious response. and then i told him how stephanie and the bus driver thought mom was him. he said 'hahahhaha no i don't waddle. be sure to make fun of your mom every day for that one.' *sigh*

k you are all thinking emma shut the hell up i don't care. but you know what? i haven't seen my dad in like 2 weeks and probably won't until like december. i envy you people who see your dad's every night. this conversating meant a lot to me. :P

i hope the teachers do not go on strike. it will screw EVERYTHING up. and cut into christmas....NOT CHRISTMAS!

dear tatrina: BOO! i have realized why jeff and i do not get along. it is a silent competition for you i think. perhaps he is jealous of our time together. this was most evident when we were fighting for shot gun....but but he always gets shotgun. and he like lives at your house. so thus i fought for shot gun so much :)

dear shawn: :O you and evan eh?

dear stephanie: shuld i sea hwo meny tmies i can speall badder? mahwahahahahahahahahaa fize its fiz itd!

dear dana: sooo....you and travis eh? sean gave me a hug today. he asked me for my diskman and i said that he only talks to me because he is using me for my diskman and homework and he was like aww no and gave me a hug. DANA I DO NOT LIKE HIM IN THAT WAY B.T.W. there is a difference between a crush and thinking someone is cute ;)"

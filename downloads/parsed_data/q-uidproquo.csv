"event","<i>reasons like seasons, they constantly change</i><br /><br />After lurking around eljay and its various communities for awhile, i have at long last decided to update. <br /><br />school was a bore. <br />I wish there was GP- Mr whitby's snarky/witty/sarcastic comments never fail to perk me up. <br />Ahu had a mixed doubles match after AEP, so Jianhao and i turned up to cheer him and lauren on. <br />We ( jianhao xiaoyun lauren and i) decided to play around abit in the free courts and ended up in a 3 on 2 situation. was hilarious when we hit a high one to Jianhao and he gave his racket this powerful swing intended to smash the shuttlecock,&nbsp; but the racket didnt have any contact with any part of the shuttlecock in the end and ended up landing neatly on the floor, and then Jianhao turned to us with this shocked look, still in mid-smash stance. CLASSIC. <br />that happened quite a number of times, by the way, until ahu decided to keep on hitting high balls to him for entertainment value. hur hur<br />&nbsp;Played 2 on 1 (jianhao and i against ahu) afterward, got thrashed since that moron decided to keep smashing. He actually smashed the shuttlecock straight into jianhao's gut twice and once into mine. (apologized, but with the lame excuse of ""but i told you to move away!"". in his defence, he DID say that, but between the time he hit the smash and the time when it hit me, there was no bloody time to move -.-) <br />&nbsp;I have decided to cut off his welfare benefits (im welfare head, hahaha) and jianhao (pres)is gonna kick him out of art club for that. &gt;:D mohohoh what blatant abuse of authority. we're bullying the meek librarian. <br /><br />missing out on touchrug camp over the weekend, damn. <br /><br />AEP combined schools workshop at nyjc on saturday. tape art does sound intriguing. <br /><br />back to doing va."

Went back to ij today to collect my olvl cert! It was so nostalgic, and made me miss IJ, rodents, 4/3 and mr teh all over again. 
I visited ms low and ms ho at the studio :D god i miss that place! As usual, they were rather stressed outand looked as if they'd want to be anywhere else. Dont we all love AEP. 
And, i found out from them that it was marking day =.= no wonder the entire place was so deserted! That killed my plans to hop upstairs to visit mrs fam and mr teh, meh. 

rewinding a bit, half-day was not such a half-day after all. AEP sova lessons right after formal dismissal, which dragged on. what's more, we have another essay to add to the pile of uncompleted assignments. Just&nbsp; as we happily handed our goya essay up today, reveling in the feeling of a lifted burden only to have another one crash down on our weary shoulders almost immediately after.

for the past three or so days, i have been leaving school at bout 730pm, coming home and sleeping after 1130 due to the fact that i cant complete my work, and my hair's still damp. 
not that ive completed much work. 

leadership symposium has been wonderful :)
apart from the fact that we're legally excused from lessons throughout the day, we get to sit in dialogues with ex-njcians who are now serving in the public sector.It really has been enlightening and a real eye-opener, especially for people like myself who dont dabble in politics or even current affairs, preferring to wallow in our own little bubble, insouciant and ignorant of whats happening in the world. There's always something special about sharing your own immature 17-year-old&nbsp; views about a world you know so little of, with a peer, a senior, who is mature enough to provide insightful comments yet youthful enough for you to relate to them. Little anecdotes&nbsp; of their school days in NJ, comments on how the uniform hasnt changed, opinions on governance and politics in singapore- it has been, so far, the most enriching two days. 

of course, the highlight of the programme is the FOOD, in which, i am glad to announce, we have in abundance. today alone, we had two tea breaks, and one lunch hour where all the food was catered, and no repeat dishes spanning over all three meals! divine. 
although i must admit, the mee goreng leaves much to be desired. hurr.

symposium ended at around 530, 6 today. headed for aep after that to continue the easel sketch. as it turned out, i ended up doing more crapping, friendstering, and pikachu volleyballing with them than anything else.
typical. :D

val and i called up ms low today, and we had a little chat with her over the loudspeaker, although she was having dinner at that time. i miss meeessss looooowww! and all her pet fish.

"event","so,
my tuesdays run late, but have multiple free periods slotted in between the lessons. 
my timetable went something like this: chem, free period, break, math lecture, free period, PW, lunch, PW, free period, PE. 
2/3 of them were rather productive, i might proudly add. dont you just love the feeling of completing all of those damned tutorial questions? 

we got mr ng as a chem tutor. godsaveus. he was ohkay as a CT and all, but i doubt i'll enjoy having him as a tutor. he s just such a rigid, stuffy old man! to quote, ""if you dont do your tutorials twice, i ll be calling up your parents."" DUDE, who even says that to JC students any more?? its the freaking 21st century. 

anyhow, math lecture was... interesting. especially if the lecturer is also your math tutor, and happens to be very familiar with your name. i swear that laser was cursed. it was LONGHAO! -points. i feel so misunderstood. 

hahahaha. 


PE was total trash, apart from CELLE, my sole friend in the IP-dominated OG1 PE class i have been thrown into, and the fact that for once, i felt good after height and weight taking. :D 

met some of olds13 in the canteen after that, and went down with honghu, sndrew and daph to play a little bball. poor honghu actually ended school promptly at 2pm, but was still hanging around even at 4pm. due to a twist of events. heh. 

(conversation is abridged and para-phrased.)

me: honghuuuuu you end school at 2 right?
him: yeah. :D you have pe!
me: yeah, at 250. free period before that, after PW. 
him: -points and laughs mockingly
me: since youre so free, you can keep me company during my free period. -GRINS

and so, he ended up staying. aww. 

(later on)

me: PE!
him: ohkay, maybe i ll just go home
grace. honghuuu! my training only starts at 430. -GRINS

AND SO, poor ahu stayed with both of us. after which we all headed down the courts. it was the reds, me and daph, against the greys, ahu and andrew. it was SUCH an amusing game! i think i worked my abs from all the laughing more than arms from shooting and dribbling. reason being, daph and andrew SCREAMING/ SHOUTING all throughout the game. it was SUPER HILARIOUS! 

met longhao, jeffrey, shoo and ailin soon after, and played a spot of street soccer at our very own nj street soccer court! although we had a loser football (those plastic, brightly dyed ones) it was another very amusing game. 
old07s13!&lt;333

headed home, after hovering around the track, and cheering ""GO GRACCCEEE!"" at grace who was doing track warmups, everytime she jogged passed the spot we were standing at. funnyy! i think she was embarrassed. and pretended that we were mere spirits on the track, neither seen nor heard. haha.

mr low just sent me a msg, telling me to see the HOD of math tmr, about transferring back to s13, and that there are only 3 vacancies.
aww, mr low is such a nice ct! (:

"event","<font size=""5""><b>monday. </b><font size=""2"">it was a rather draggy day, which ended terribly late because i kept dilly-dallying. Lessons were per normal, with mrs koh tutoring a class of unresponsive people, last-minute econs presentations and sleep-inducing lectures. Blame LT5 for being that conducive for an afternoon siesta. We had our most rigorous PE session today, which consisted of running and more running; one round for warm up, then 2.4 time trial. Mr tong dismissed us straight after 2.4 though, he s nice that way. I guess he was feeling merciful and decided not to torture us any further. Trooped off to the student lounge with honghu and jianhao to purchase council application forms, and hovered around afterward, gossiping with adeline, our dear OGL, after they both left. It was a good chat :) <br /><br />I went for the funeral wake at st joseph's at night. <br />We arrived just in time for the service. The atmosphere was heavy, with a melancholic chorus mourning hymns. throughout the service, we stood respectfully at the back, but could hear his mother wailing from inside the room. At the end of the service, we joined the queue to pay our last respects, and to offer up condolences to mrs low. Words failed me when uni and i gave her a tight hug, because there's just nothing you can say to someone that would help ease that pain, that loss; nothing helps, and all you can do is pray for them, hoping for the best. Mrs Low was so strong, smiling while thanking everyone for coming and offering support, although her pale face and lack of verve betrayed signs of heavy grieving. <br />I felt terrible that the wake hosted several mini reunions, with groups of students huddled together and exchanging amusing little anecdotes about JC life. It was good that our positive energy lightened the mood, though. <br /><br /><br /><br /><font size=""5""><b>tuesday. </b><font size=""2"">one word: slack. With only two tutorials and a math lecture, tuesdays would be the prime choice as the perfect day to pon school. However, because i actually enjoy math tutorials with my math tutor and classmates, I still haul myself to school early every tuesday morning for school. today was no exception. <br />Lessons for me ended at 1140 (HOHO!) much to the chagrin of other S13 people, who still have lessons at 250. went for a jog with jianhao qinrui and honghu, first to qinrui's place ,with val, to drop off our valuables. He has the most adorable dog, cookie (!!!!), but cruelly fences her into this small area in the front yard, with some other dog who kept barking. poor cookie :( <br />Then, we proceeded to cluney park and did a round, ran back to qinrui's and then to corro plaza to buy lunch. headed back to school by bus after that, since they had lessons at 250. Sat around with my DEAREST classmates at the grandstand, now our fave haunt on tuesday afternoons since IPW only commences in term2, and had my lunch. <br />Left for home when they headed for lessons.<br /> hur hur.<br />i love tuesdays. </font></font></font></font>"

- doing a huge ""YU YUAN"" for fishball, in similar ahbeng fashion as long hao's. they did the gangster walk down the canteen and cracked jokes about extorting protection money/ getting free food/ etc etc. 
fishball's joke about ms sharon phua noticing his tatoo: ""you think you look damn cool with that tatoo?? you ll look even cooler with one arm. (insert anguished cry)""

HIGHLY entertaining, and the video was hilarious. we broke off into our new OGs, according to the civics classes. im in an odd combi class, no surprise there, since my choice of subject is pretty abnormal. <br />pfft, normal is overrated. go 07S13!<br /><br /><br />had mass dance practice in, of all places, the parade square, directly under the scorching sun. it was fun, nonetheless, although i have already completely forgotten 3/4 of the steps already, not counting that im totally lost throughout half of the moves in the first place.  grace and i kept cracking up because we were both moving in the wrong directions/ standing still/ turning wrongly etc etc<br /><br />clan bonding session after that, and we played games, learnt the aerius house song (which is a hell lot simpler to grasp than the school song) and did the rhythmic clapping thing along with it. house games were pretty hilarious as well. they are funny people. <br />i am so lazy to elaborate<br /><br />anyhow, currently burnt red and having a terrible t-shirt tan, im contented with my new civics class and the whole NJ thing. <br />hey, im adapting! hur.  <br /><br /><br /></font></font>"

"event","today was the best day among our pre-orientation week orientation, firstly probably because it was the end of long boring talks in the hall, and the beginning of our week-long orientation activities. 
the OGLs tried to teach us NJ cheers and motivate us to cheer along loudly to arouse some NJ spirit but to not much avail, since they chose the wrong times (short breaks between sleep-inducing talks). seeing them so enthusiastic and passionate about cheering for their school struck a cord though: its just like how we were in IJ. It made me think that after a year in this school (hopefully), i might be able to cheer as loudly and with such gusto, like i would have for IJ. 
its so useless to wallow in a past, when youre stuck in the present.
i miss IJ hellalot, and i know that i always will. I'm truly thankful for that opportunity to have enrolled there for a decade, hence taking the IJ spirit along with me as i move forward into the NJ community. 

enough prattling, ive got a busy week ahead of me. 
tmr- OG outing!
sun- studybuddy thingo :D
mon- orientation till 4
tues- orientation till 4
wed-&nbsp; ODYSSEY external hunt till 5
thurs- orientation till 5
fri- war games, dance party cum campfire cum bbq till 10

frankly, even though its going to be bloody tiring, im kind of looking forward to it. after 3 days of dry talks and introductory lessons, i think we deserve a little week of fun."

"event","so i was just watching the google video link to NJ mass dance val kindly put up on her LJ. 
i swear, their sock tans draw all the attention away from their dance moves. i was sniggering quietly to myself throughout the video, terrible, i know. i should try not to laugh at others to myself all that often. 

NJ day one can only be described by one word: TIRING
gathered in the hall at 730, before that meeting up with isabel and then scooted over to sit with val, shu and delle at the canteen
OG25! i suppose i could have winded up with more boring, taciturn OGLs&nbsp; but julian, jo, jolene and charmaine seem like a nice bunch of friendly people. (HA val i remember their names.) i somehow managed to get acquainted with a few others in my OG. 
overall, its a rather interesting mix of people. 

NJ was dominated by RV white and speckles of CHIJ blue, more so than previous years i should reckon, since a record high of more than 15 ijtpians were posted here this PAE. its nice to see a few friendly faces among all that distance and unfamiliarity. 

I sat in for a few introductory lessons- econs, lit, KI
They were more informative than anything, although i did enjoy the sarcasm and funny antics of the lit teacher, which actually sparked off a keen interest in taking lit in me, until i heard that he was going to resign soon -.- (that, and ive got too many subjects for my h1-h2 combo) 
econs was rather dry, i was falling asleep and my mind was wondering elsewhere most of the time. 


It could have been worse for a first day at a new school.
NJ is great, but its no IJ.

meh. IJ should establish a junior college."

travelled to bras besar art friend with moooom in the late morning. the moment i stepped in, i was gretted with a whiff of turpentine and the smell of brand new art materials. i made a beeline for the COPICS. they restocked! so there were dozens of pretty new shades available. i spent a good half hour trying out the shades but didnt purchase any in the end, although i did take note of the colours i wanted, and since im holding on to the art friend privilege card i could just pop by any branch to get them. 
anyhow, saved up my cash for basheer. spent a happy hour browsing through the graphic design and fashion illustration books. i never get tired of that place. met my dad at the bookstore and he very kindly paid for this month's issue of territory :D 

headed down to taka afterward, met nic and danny at mos. uni was around taka as well, so she popped by for salutations.
we headed up to kino next, since i was also holding on to the kino privilege card, which means 20% off storewide.i finally got saikano vol4 and emily the strange #7. was sorely tempted to get one of those rather expensive graphic design books but theyre so expensive; definitely worth the splurge, but it still burns a large hole in your wallet. ouch. 
we left kino happy, with bags in hand. 

headed out to the starbucks adjacent to paragon after that, to grab a quick coffee. we initially squeezed four chairs around a puny round table at the pillar, but shifted to the couch seats after this moby-lookalike finally left (he took the entire 6-seater area to himself)
stayed around till it was time to leave and meet prem. 
left with nic, and met her outside breadtalk. took a bus to my place.

we were rather lazy to go all the way to adam road for dinner (sambal seabass, yum) even though theres a straight bus, so we ordered in KFC and watched death note while munching. 
i havent had KFC in a long time, and whilst attacking my second piece i recalled my brief boycotting of KFC chicken because of the video where they exposed the evil means KFC farms used to slaughter the chickens.
putting that aside, i thoroughly enjoyed eating the chicken.

danny came by after the church meeting, and we migrated to my room for more entertainment in the form of daidi, gin rummy and cluedo. we wanted to do mahjong, but were too lazy to drag our asses downstairs to set up the table. theres always next time, anyway. 
gaming till bout 130am, and then we decided to crash the couch and watch moulin rouge. halfway through the first disk, we were all falling asleep (NOT because it was boring or anything, moulin rouge is a fantastic movie) hence decided to go back up to bed. however, once we got all comfortable and ready to sleep we werent sleepy anymore. 
contemplated going back down to continue with the show, but we ended up playing ""have you ever"", minus the alcohol, using a black permanent marker instead. a very mild and less risque version. ahaha

went to sleep after that, at approx 3am. we broke the chalet record.



thurs

i woke up early,much to my chagrin ,despite sleeping at such a late hour.nic got up soon after, and then we shocked prem up by telling her it was already 10+ and that macs breakfast would be over if she didnt get up (it was actually only 8).
headed to coffee bean for breakfast (cafe cartel wasnt open yet!), and i split a break-0-day and garlic bagel with nic (what would i do without garlic bagels and cream cheese.)

stuffed and happy, we took the mrt and bus to YMCA serviced apartments. met sheeni there and roped her in for singstar on PS2.
its pure FUN. i swear the blue mic was jinxed at the beginning, but blues emerged champions anyway. hoho. i would go into details, but im lazy and nothing could accurately describe the experience. one things for sure though: im never listening to TAKE ME OUT for as long as i can help it. hurrr. 

it was raining when nic's mom dropped us off at wheelock. it was fun annoying cactus. heh heh. he fully deserved it, if you ask me. making you brave the damn rain."

"event","i felt like such a slug today.
the minute i woke up and washed up, i headed downstairs and plopped myself down, talking up the entire length of the sofa and watched some morning news on the teevee.
i felt so lazy and my hair was all chunky, hence my entire morning was spent on the couch lapping up smallville season 3 (my bro bought the dvds in melbourne), although half the time i was just stoning.
anyhow, thomson plaza for lunch with my family, and went supermarket shopping. 
loaded the basket with junk and philidelphia cheese spread (spelling unkwnown). i ve been addicted to that stuff since yesterday at coffee bean.

church at one, plopped myself on the table top and snoozed before the rest of the people came and we did the dnd decor.
drew out a few different masks and painted them, along with audrey claire hannah fran keith and anthony. the guy's mask was hilarious. it looked like a darth vader/ petrified monkey hybrid, and they slopped black paint in the middle of nowhere.oh well. all in good fun. 
i drank a double dose of yakult today, although so did most of the others. blame the new yakult vending machine in church. 

aunty liz bought us chocolate 'n spice bakery muffins! split mine with audrey, since im not too fond of chocolate muffins, i was just being greedy.
decor isnt done, people are coming over again some time to finish it all up. thus, joel and andrew very kindly delivered the syrofoam boards/paints etc over just now, shifted from 02-01.

we had our long awaited studybuddy outing at east coast park, cycling our asses off from 11 till 5. started off by meeting them at j8 for breakfast, then taking a long 55 bus ride to VJ and then walking to eastcoast. rented our bikes and cycled out.

(i am rather lazy to type out the entire day in prose format soi ll go along with bullet ponts.)

-cycled from bike rental shop to bedok jetty
-cycled till end of jetty for a short break, spied blackened banana peel/ dead starfish lookalike floating around
-planned on making noise to scare the fish away but sticked to simply cycling along as silent observers; we are nice people (:
-cycled out till we reached a (rather) dead end and turned back
-breezed pass other cyclists, happily ringing the bicycle bells at those blasted pedestrians annoyingly taking up the entire length of the cyclist/rollerblader track
-stop along a more deserted part of the shore, and walk into the sea to cool down.
-feel like tanning, and debate on stripping off top but presence of three workers looking at us over the grass deters us from doing so
-move away from three workers to another spot on the beach, but still in view of the workers
-cycle away, sticky with seawater and sandinfeet, to the nearest shower area and wash off a tad
-cycle in opposite direction
-reached eastcoast hawker centre, reluctantly left bicycles outside the centre because of the no-bicycle signs
-had coconuts and satay. happy.
-see other group of cyclists blatantly wheeling their own bicycles into the centre. feel rather dumb and prig-ish
-cycle on, all the way to the other end, pass the bike rentals and macs
-found a nice airy spot, a bench shaded by the casurina (sp???) trees
-we lie down and gossip/ramble/rot
-nic decides to be masseuse of the day and gives each of us a back massage.  
-muscles relaxed and untensed, we feel ready to hit coffee bean.
-cycle to coffee bean, park bikes at scruffy murphy's ""for patrons only"" bike lots. heck, the place isnt even open
-enter coffee bean. revel in the shade and air con
-order drinks and munchies. garlic bagel <333
-cycle off after tummies are filled, to the far end of east coast
-stop at prem's ""emo spot"" to soak in the atmosphere.
-decide to return bikes before rain pours down
-walk to the bus stop and take 55 back to j8.it was an interesting bus ride. hmmm.
-home. 



my back is red. it has the spag tan and sportsbra tan so i might as well have been wearing a tee and not tan at all -.-

the weather there was fantastic! its like perpetual air-conditioning. and the shopping was awesome.i spent so much O__O like the whole lot of allowance my dad gave plus some. 
oh oh and how could i forget: the BEEF. 

anyhow, we all thoroughly enjoyed the trip and were so reluctant to leave. my parents have decided that they want to send me there or apply for a scholarship for me there to study so that they have a valid excuse to fly there all the time. hur. 


yesterday was fun! met my parents for lunch at j8.
 it was great catching up with nirasha prems and uni in town after that. we catched trust the man at cine. it was rather hilarious and eyecandy-filled, but there were a couple of UHHHHH parts-i guess thats why they rated it nc16.the french guy was hilarious.(yous stayss away from hersss"") tobey is an ass. 
shopping for ms ratulangi's wedding gift after that. we settled on a beautiful necklace from chomel, after scouting around for something which looked ms ratulangi-ish. starbucks after that, toffee nut latte <333"

chalet day! 
spent most of the morning packing my overnight bag and making a huge tub of potato salad to take along. Left for aranda at around 2, with joel making the backseat a tad more squashy than the norm.it was a long ride, but i had the historian to keep me company and block out his and my bro's annoying remarks. 

reached aranda country club, and checked out the unit we rented. it had a  spacious hall, with nice parquet, two rooms and a balcony just after the back door leading to the yard where the bbq pits were. first thing we did was set the food down in the kitchenette, dump our bags and set up the game cube console we dragged along and played sonic :D omg, i got so so so bad at the blasted game. even joel the noob got further in the game, when i died like 2 minutes into playing. hur hur. i blamed it on the headache.

danny came soon after, and helped us start up the fire, which was being stubborn and refused to heat up the charcoal. the neighbouring pit wasnt doing all that much better, though. prems and evelyn arrived next, and then came over to help start bbqing, since we were all getting just a little hungry. shenn's little friends came and then the whole lot of them went elsewhere to play soccer -.- 
shaun arrived, and then nasha, and alex. introductions all around. 
kristen, jamie,and the other shaun came soon after, met them on the pathway while making my way to the carpark and on the phone with uni giving her directions. 
the food was good, bbqed by joel, eve and danny (thanks <333)
while i hopped around trying to be a good host, introducing my schoolmates to church friends and parents, and trying to stuff everyone with food.
prem was hilarious.

me (to oliver, my bro's classmate): we're done here, you guys can take over the bbq.
oliver: yeah, whatever (which is probably what he says all the time in place of ""yes"" or ""okay"". must be a caucasian thing.)
prem: (frowning)so rude!
oliver: (looking perturbed, and kinda scared) im sorry, sorry. i mean, yes ohkay/

his expression was priceless. and every subsequent time he answered with ""yeah, whatever"" he quickly continued with "" i mean, ohkay.""

as usual, uni and prem were lusting over ""jason scott"". pffttt. its so embarrassing. he's my brother! its so so wrong. ahahaha.and eve was going around with tong-in-hand and kept giving them more food. 

my friends seem to like terrorizing poor little sec one kids. hurrr 

michael and adrian came at night, just as the rain was coming down and everyone shifted inside. 
school friends went to our designated room while i played mahjong with rciy-ians. damn michael won every single game. bish. and the posture and angle at which he sat made him look like some seasoned gambler. ahahaha. 

retired from the mahjong table after a few games to watch she's the man in the room, on my mom's laptop. it was rather cold so nasha prems evelyn uni and danny all snuggled under the two quilts. so comfy. 

anyhow, people started leaving and then there were five. (not inclusive of my bro and his 5 friends, or my parents)we watched some other movie, about hiphoppers and dancing but it was rather dry in my opinion. took a warm, deserved shower and then we all went to bed.
prem kept making noise since we were all snuggled and ready to sleep when my brother and his croonies were making noise and were very much awake. ah, the vivacity of youth. they have such energy. we felt so OLD and UNCOOL falling asleep that early (1am) so we got up and gossiped for a bit. soon we were all lying down again under the covers with the lamps off. 
my brother and his friends were up the entire night. thats just mad.
in the wee hours of the morning i heard the door to our room opening and some boys talking (they camped out in the huge hall). even now i have no idea what they were planning to do since before they could enter or whatever, uni stirred in her position and they got all alarmed.(i found out soon after that she did it on purpose) their reaction was so amusing ""oh no. i think one of them is awake""""EH. SHIT which one."" ""oh no no shhhhhhhhhhhh""
HAHA. and i decided that if they stepped in i would just sit up with my hair and bangs all covering my face.too bad they chickened out after that and left the door open, continuing thair gaming outside.
uni and i awoke, went to the kitchen through the interconnected bathroom. she left soon after, to take the long train home. 


20th

we all woke up rather reluctantly.had to drag danny up.
the four of us played daidi for a bit, then decided to head out exploring downtown east for a good breakfast spot. went for mcafe in the end. the muffin was great, but the hot coffee was terribly bland and had no kick. although michael buble crooning  in the background was nice.  
wove through the shops and stalls and then decided that we were lazy and unadventurous so why not just head back to the chalet and watch more movies?
watched howl's moving castle. it was three votes against one. 
val came soon after, at about 230pm and joined us halfway through the plot.
prem fell asleep. i took pictures. meh heh.
we watched shrek2 next! and rain was coming down hard, so val was stuck with us a while longer than expected. my bro's friends left so we had all the unopened ruffles and doritos plus the dark chocolate bars prem and nasha brought. junk haven. 

danny and i taught nasha and prems how to play mahjong after that.i had to write the sequence of chinese numerals on serviettes with my mom's microns so they could play. it was fun, played a consecutive 2-3 hours, just the four of us. we conclude that mahjong is terribly addictive. 
it was 7pm, GOONG TIME. i thank heavens for the TV. we shifted the mahjong table across the hall till it was just right in front of the tv and watched while playing. hur hur. 
nasha's mom came soon after so prem and her had to leave. 
my parents went out to buy some dinner back so danny and i watched goong. (ohkay maybe i was watching while she was staring, wondering how i could endure and hour of lame-romance-plot korean drama) oh well, what can i say. KJH is such a show stealer :DDDD

packed up, (my dad and bro were lazy to bunk in another night, so decided to go home too.)and sent danny home first before heading home ourselves. i had a good sleep. 


21st

i had to wake up early. daddy sent me to school for PAE. 
mrs how-yip gave us prom-briefing (the norm, no low-backed, plunging neckline, inviting of other people, strict entrance criteria yadda yadda)
and then the PAE briefing. collected our cca records, prelim result slips and the school official leaving certificate.
i feel sad. im not a secondary school student anymore.
more than anything, i feel OLD. -.-
anyway, met uni who conveniently arrived after the entire thing was over and mr teh was leaving.
we headed for town after that. speant a good half-hour and starbucks first (it was so nicely quiet and empty) since the heeren shops werent even open. 
headed for shops to look for evening gowns/ formals skirts. we entered chaos, where while looking at the whole array of black stuff available, the salesgirl came up and asked us to stay just for a bit more because there was this male customer (who was concurrently trying something on in the fitting room) who was a perv and just touched her thigh and the place was so quiet. so, we stayed, under the pretense of looking intently at the clubbing-clothes on sale. we chatted with the lady, who was really really nice and she told us about all the pervs hanging around heeren. it was really... enlightening. ahaha. i wonder how such people can actually exist to do such shameful acts. the dude left, reserving a pair of pants and telling her that he would come collect it later, so hung around a while more, talked to the salesperson and then left. made a round about the level and then headed towards the escalators.
while walking past chaos again, we spied the same perv guy in the shop. i suspect he came to ""claim"" his reserved pair of pants, just after we left. so uni and i loitered on the outside of the store, until we saw him re-entering the fitting room and hence we wnet back into the store. she was so glad to see us, it was a good thing we checked while walking past. the guy came out of the fitting and took an awfully long time to finally put on his shoes and purchase the pants. all the while, i sat directly opposite them, in full view of the counter while uni tried on some stuff. i daresay he didnt do anything else while we were both hanging around. 
he left and then we stayed to talk with the saleslady awhile more. we are friendly people. hur hur. 
spent the entire day searching for s prom outfit, but ended up with a nice new belt and black leggings, both of which i have been pining to get since a long time ago and fortunately found today. 
i am happy :D 
rushed home just in time to catch the final episode of GOONG.T-T nooooooooo yul turned himself in in place of his mother. so filial<33 


val! the black leggings are sold at zara for $16.90, mango is a ripoff at $30."

Yesterday, June 1, 2005...I boarded a plane at 7:00 am in Tallahassee. I finally arrived at Washington Reagan International Airport at 11:00 am. I had two 50lb suitcases, one big carry on bag containing all of my DVD's including three seasons of West Wing (yeah I am that far behind), and my laptop case. 

Drs Lori and Bari Ripps, a friend of mine through B'nai Israel in Pensacola, arranged for me to spend the month of June and July with Lori's childhood and adult best friend Barri and her husband Keith in McLean, Virginia. 

The McLean neighborhood is gorgeous. It appears that Colin Powell and several current and former cabinet members as well as several Supreme Court Justices and government officials live here because of McLean's quietness and beauty. The George Bush Central Intelligence Agency Headquarters is just up the road. 

The ride home from the airport to McLean was pretty eventful. For starters, Marine One flew by as we were driving, either en-route to the White House to pick-up or drop off President Bush. Secondly as we were driving past the CIA there was a big accident in front of the entrance, FBI, CIA Law Enforcement, and DC Police were standing by with Machine Guns in hand. Bari was telling me that whenever accidents or other security events like this occur, including Presidential, Vice-Presidential and Cabinet motorcades, it is a serious inconvenience to the Washington, VA, and MD commuters.

As we drove through the McLean area, my eyes became real big and my mouth dropped at the huge and gorgeous homes that lined the streets. Houses around here range from 200,000 to the numerous million dollar plus estates. It appears that land and homes are quite pricey. 

Bari and Keith have two kids, Jake (4 1/2) and Sydney (90 They are adorable and full of energy. They also have a one year old, male, Boxer named Tunney. It is nice to have some Boxer love and energy in my life again, as I have missed Missy terribly. 

Sydney and Jake took me on a nature walk on a trail behind their property. A little stream with plenty of beautiful trees were along the path providing a well needed and relaxed moment. Sydney likes to collect specimens of glass, plants, and other things. Jake likes to look at the water and run along the path.It was a task to keep up with the two of them, wish I was in better shape. 

For the rest of the evening I talked with the family, relaxed and went to sleep for twelv hours.

More to come soon...."

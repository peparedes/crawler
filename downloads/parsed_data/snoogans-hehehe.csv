"event","hey, i did something stupid.
ok what i did was take ben of my journal friends list so this couldnt be read.looks like it could.

you all know me, i need to let off steam.i wanted to do it in a way that wouldnt hurt anyone, wouldnt have um repurcusions.
well it did, and now you know why iv been depressed all week. or you would if you know id been depressed all week. month. 

thanks ben for forwarding it to everyone, now we have a crisis.
and thanks for swearing at me instead of asking me to talk about it and explain myself.but thats never the way with us lot huh.

thanks everyone else for not leaving your names so i couldnt see who it is that has such a problem with james staying here.the petulant child bit made my day.after three days work is exactly the time i want to be called a child.

i want to clear up the way i mean used. i dont mean used in a concious way, i dont mean used in a monetary way (the way you seem to), i mean used by the fact that now you have girls you dont need me.its true. there hasnt been a ben, aaron, amy, kelv, andy day this term or last. i dont want the world to revolve around me, i just want to be in it, not on the outside.

ben im going to argue with you, you have no right to accuse me of hiding in my room. that has been the case this week becuase i dont feel welcome, because i know how hostile you all are toward jam.but it is not how i generally live in this house. like it or not you havent been here and dont know.i am not going to back down on this, im not the only person complaining about it.

im fucking crying, youv made me cry and that can have been your only intention or you would be here tonight to talk about it. you wouldnt have shown it to everyone so you could all get your goes in.
yeah, poor fucking me.because i seem to have been proved right.

if im a petulant child then you be the adults an sort this out because i cant."

"event","im upset i think because of a few things.mostly the boys.
kat told me that she excitedly asked them (ben, aarron i think)what they had planned for my birthday. 
apparantly they 'ummed and aaahed' and generally whined. she said she gave them a telling off, strangely enough later that day ben asked me whats happening for my birthday. ha
today i got up an ben an han were up an they merrily told me they were off to preston, 'fair enough' i said, 'have fun. when you leaving?' ben slopishly answered 'um when andy an kayla are ready'.
at this point i had a bit of a strop, 'lovely' i said slamming a plate, 'just the four of you, have a good time together'.

over reacting?

i dont think so. for example the other day hannah had told ben that she wanted the evening to herself to read and stuff. instead of taking this opportunity to chill with his friends and be social, he sits in his room with the door locked playing guitar angrily and moaning at her over msn. 

is this the loveable, friendly, funny, cool ben i felt best friends with? nope.this is a shit, whiny, possesive, obsessive, jealous, boring, selfish and fucking unthoughtful ben.ben, half of 'benanhan'.

its the same with them all though. now they have girlfriends they dont need me anymore.i have no use to them. that makes me feel fucking angry. worse it makes me feel used. i. feel. used.

so what is going to take place on my birthday? well I have organised a meal at a restaurant, I am running round trying to find out whose coming, I will be making the reservations.I.ME. im organising my own birthday.apparantly after the meal wel be coming home and getting pissed. what a barrel of fucking monkeys thatl be.cant mess up the precious 'communal space' though can we...

so basicly im moaning because my birthdays going to be shit again (i think i made a post about last years big day,similar story except they all met me gave a card and then said bye we'r all going bowling). and also because i dont like my friends anymore.i feel sorry for jam, hes got to sit and watch this shit happening to me, must be fucking frustrating.to me it feels like a waste of time an effort. a little unhappy person inside me is saying 'oh look, i was proved right, maybe you were better off not having friends'.

roll on september.theres no way of this getting better."

had a great day today...went to ashton memorial an stomped round the woods. atea caramel shortcake slice and drank some overpriced hot chocolate. sooooo lovely up there, makes me look forward to summer.

house is meh.

looking forward to next year, me an jam gonna own th top floor of a house, massive room! an a liitle one for studying.

studyin at the mo is slightly better than last term, having wednesdays off work was the best thing really.unfortunatly sue the new boss is shite an is cutting everyones hours so we'r pretty skint at the mo, iv decided that if jam gets more work somewhere we'l put him through driving lessons, its about time one of us started and also we'r saving twenty pounds a week on rent so we can afford to give it a go. when he gets more work of course though.

its really annoying that my space bar is shit.

got a looooong day tomorrow. uni 9 till 1, work 3 till 7, potentially going out till 2...? work again next day at 12. oh what a wonderful life.id go loony if james wasnt here an stuff wasnt nicely falling into place for once. the stuff with the mega bitch (james' landlady)is sorted finally, woooohoooooo.

she was a bit of a tit.

moneys a little tight this month, so to compensate i keep buying stuff. makes sense huh.well whatever keeps the monkey on the doorstep thats all i can say.

i made jam fried breakfast in bed this morning, brought it up with a tea an a paper (nuts magazine), would have been a perfect vision of dutifulness but i was upset cos the bacon was overcooked an my egg tasted like his mushrooms. damn fine though. an he seemed happy.

getting on so well with hannah at the minute, its nice. i appreciate the influence shes had on me. theres changes in me, tiny subtle changes, that i can thank her for.just hope she knows that il be there for her as much as she is for me when i need a rant.like she is for everyone haha.

anyhoo hollyoaks has started so im off before i break into song. laters

we were walking home with ben, i had three bags of presents for callum kim laura an nick. we also had some cheap munchies to eat after dinner. as we walk up the hill out of no where a bloke jmps in front of me and before he ran past he screamed in my face. i screamed. more out of surprise than fear. james turns as the get past us a shouted at them, called them nobheads.  that stupid little meaningless word, nobhead.

they turn around. the larger starts shouting at us. he walks back up, james tries to back down. the man (5'10, white male, short blonde hair, white shirt, blue jeans, aged about 23)comes back and hits james, im screaming and crying. he hits jmes again, im still screaming and crying i beg his friend to make him stop. james falls down and the man swings for ben. he misses and as he turns to leave, to run off with his friend, to go into to town to drink and laugh and sing and screw, as he turns past he punches me in the face.

we'r home now, the police an ambulance came quick we answered questions questions questions. i couldnt/cant feel any pain, im crying in shock and fear because james is bleeding.his tooth is broken.the hospital was tiring but they gave james some (rubbish) drugs.bens mum an phil picked us up an brought us home.i needed to be back. im not telling my mum,she cant find out till i go home. i have a week left to work and cant afford for her to freak out and get me home.its shit because apart from james i need her most right now.

i need to write this down so i dont forget, ben just took photos incase anything proper comes of this.macabre.

im calming down a bit, im surrounded by the presents iv bought, luckily they arent damaged. i just want to get this week over with. james is going to the hospital dentist tomorrow which is good and quick.we have to drink some hot chocolate, the sugar will do us good.

"event","well well well.
firstly im annoyed because james was sweet and bought the sims2 for me,at first the laptop managed to support it and now BLAM! cd drive decides it no longer functions in that capacity. i can imagine the little goblin that makes it go, is siting in his living room...perhaps with a warming relaxing mug of ovaltine and a copy of something like the idiots guide to diy and is planning a nice corner shelving unit or maybe one of those table nests.

either way the little sod is not making it spin and therefore not playing disks. youd have thought itd be a matter of pride that kept the thing going or maybe a bigger goblin with a stick or maybe lots of hungry little goblins that need the absent goblin to bring home a pay packet of some sort. what kind of malicious sod neglects that kind of responsibility, in the face of fatherhood vanishes off, probably told the wife hes on a 'business trip', a business trip to a cheap motel with the hussy from the accounts department no doubt. 

um, my cd drive is broke.

also i recieved a scary letter from the lit department, iv missed 4 seminars an have to go talk to him tomorrow.i dont think dissolving into a teary mess is going to help in this situation, i think il be apologetic and concerned about my progress, il be honest and tell him hes intimidating and make sure he understands that i know taking time off like that was irresponsible of me but i didnt want to turn up unprepared and be told to leave. i cant be th only one that found it hard to keep up, and even if i am is not like we are all the same.

i had a dream that i beat the shit out of that ugly smart arsed girl in the seminar. it felt good.

im slightly nervous but i know iv had valid poblems and things. hes just a sarcy pretentious wanker, i dont think hes mean. should be ok.

im worried about james.
gonna take comfort in my cheerful hollyoaks omnibus.

"event","well. have work in hour and a half. 

me an james had a great couple of days together, just like in the holidays just me an him. we went for brakfast, stayed in bed, stayed up late, watched telly, played games, wandered round town, spent to much, slept in a double bed, drank tea, went cinema. it was perfect. i miss the simplicity of the summer.

im worried. everyone seems down at the minute. kelv is down cos hes busy all the time an has no privacy an nowhere to escape to, bens down cos he has a job, kats down cos she misses paul and hannah, ash is down cos of something that happened at the weekend,lindsey is down cos shes just like that. im trying not to let rushing an tiredness and getting behind on my reading get me down. im trying.

the worst thing is that sometimes it seems easier to just pretend i dont notice or hide at jams for a while instead of try an help anybody.

anyway. back to normal me. im having second thoughts about getting the net for my laptop. i mean it was awesome having it last year and helped me loads but i do all my work here now where i dont have to pay and plus i never use my laptop at home an im never there in the first place, i dont know if i can afford to buy wireless equipment and pay this extortionant charge they want every month. on top of that me kelv an ash need to get together and approach the others about this bill thing. its only fair.

dont wanna piss them off but dont want to be paying for things i wont use.

gotta go buy another fucking book."

i forgot to complain about the shitness of my student loan this year. nobheads.

i wonder how long i could stretch out a wander round the library, i still have half an our to kill.

work is going well i spose, im constantly exhausted at the minute though and crashing out whenever i have more than 10minutes of sitting down (say for example on my break or in a lectre).im a bit worried cos im pretty sure i used to be able to stay up later than midnight an manage to be both functional and literate after less than 7 hours sleep...am i getting old? am i unhealthy somehow?

after getting in from work yesterday at about half 9 and falling asleep instantly on the sofa, i only managed to wake up for five minutes to let james throw a bit of food down my throat before i went unconcious again.im a loser.

and im thirsty.

so many books here, i bet if i came in when it was completly empty except for me, id be able to hear a quiet rustly buzzy sound.me and james should come in half an hour before close one day perhaps..."

"event","well last week went perfectly, i went to every lecture and also did things like come in early to do work and shit. this week however thats all gone to shit. i missed yesterday due to a mixture of feeling llike shit and wanting to spend a day with james for once, also despite going to my first lecture today, i completly forgot about my second one an came straight to the library. i have no idea why either. im a nob. a giant nob. 
also iv put my drink down somewhere on campus and cant for the life of me remember where.

i worry about my memory.

really.

home life is ok at the moment. the boys are getting a bit anal with the dishes but i can hack it.i just wish that theyd stop playing that game for five minutes and do something else, go to the pub, wander round town...anything!

 so now instead of an hour in the library before my lecture iv got two hours. i should do some work i suppose...as a punishment.

we still havent got the net sorted in the house, the boys are too busy trying to get some souped up super connection mega wank thing. nice.
went to karens bday party the other night dressed as little red riding hood. due to the size of the dress i shocked myself to find that i have knees, and thighs. eek.i got drunk.

my reading list for lit looks about 30 books big.on top of that i spent way too much at asda last night. i missed my credit card payment date . james made me buy some jeans (a size 10, the 8 fit i spose but i agree with what he sed about me getting depressed at straining to get them on, even though when i tried them on it was ok, i know that after a few washes (and pies...?) itd only get me down)the 8 fit me best leg wise with length and cut but the 10 arent that much bigger i dont think. longer mostly. oh yeah AS I WAS SAYING, im skint.my loan might not come for a month. thank fuck i have a job huh.

a month!!!

im not that bothered i spose, the only thing that could be a problem is tuition fees. itl be ok though. 

um tonight im having curry for dinner and also i want to sleep at jams cos he missed college today (he was poorly). we'r a pair of nobheads.

well thats all thats interesting really. an not much interesting at that. i might go off in search of my drink."

 shame its only for one week.
 maybe seran will like me an keep me on longer....?
 i am lovely too i think, so she has to.if only to maintain the overall loveliness of the place.

we went out with james' new housemates. the actual people hel be living with are great. unfortunatly their friends are nobs. i wont go into it but i left early with lindsy and watched eddie izzard at hers for a couple of hours in borrowed pajamas. it was nice.

at the moment im happy but oversensitive to hidden motives and implied meaning.

this week im working in the venue! quite exciting, nicer place than the restuarant. however its unfamiliar teritory with unfamiliar faces and on top of that i have to use a till.never done that before. i get my own ID code for it too like a pin number, i hope i dont forget it as easily as i forget my bank numbers.

everyone doing resits the next couple of weeks, good luck. if you'v revised youl do well.hope to see everyone next year.  not that far away really though huh. HOPEFULLY tim will be nice an let me stay on through term time. its a big possibility, must ask him next time i see him.thatd be one major weight off my tired shoulders.

james has a place sorted already for term time. so stop 'worrying' boys. from the sound of it its an amazing room and cool housefull of people, im letting him have the playstation an tv...its looking like il be spending alot of time there instead of in my box.

had a lovey weekend, we 'did lunch' with the girls and vic's boyfriend andy who is lovely, and then convinced her to pull a sicky and host an evening in. i didnt get drunken but had a great evening.im worrried bout lindsy but cant do anything about it so gonna not get involved.

this is gonna be an expensive month, rent, loan, deposit, credit card.if i paid everything all off at once in full itd come to bout 600. aaaargh, i hate money. i dont know how im gonna pay it all. but im going to.

eep start work in 35 minutes. scary shit.

"event","well its the day. uni is now over an im moving my stuff out into the house. i say that but what i mean is im finishing the packing while james ferrys stuff over...perhaps we shoulda found some 'man with a van' type thing. i just hope i can catch becca for car use.

so what can i think of to write, looking back over my time here at uni. well for a start: its true what they say about the loan, dont spend alot all at once. an also when they say that you dont need to study to pass first year, BOLLOCKS. you do need to study and the more the better it only makes it easier on yourself. social wise i can testify that the people you meet in the first week can both be the people you stop talking to after a while and say hi to in passing. also these people you meet can be the ones you spend the rest of your time with, youl eat with them, live with them, laugh with them an cry with them. these are the people who you will know for the rest of your life, whose phone number you will ALWAYS know by memory.its these people who get you through uni an its these people who you get to rely on as friends.

uni accomodation is as bad as its made out to be, but hey ho fuck it.no bills for a year kinda makes up for porridge brease blocks an hideous curtains. the kitchens are both too small and minging and the bath rooms never the right temperature, the shower smells funny. who cares its what you do in these walls that counts.

the porters. all im saying is if they hadnt laid off towards the end of term i was considering complaining about harrassment. apparantly its not like this in all colleges but the way we were treated in bowland tower was atrocious at times.

so WHAT HAVE I LEARNT?   in WHAT WAYS HAVE I GROWN?    what do i think to THE EXPERIENCE? these are all questions, cliches that echo big brother bollocks ('i was in here to learn something about myself blah blah blah...')i reckon im ok at the friends thing now and i can take my alcohol like a micron less than a vegitarian albino feng shui loving tip toed pansy. an thats about it. sorry kelv or whoever might object but its true. id already had life experiance, id already lived out of home off my own money etc. ok i learnt a bit more tolerance for dicks but iv also learnt how to fight my corner more effectivly. i think it gave me a chance to to sod all for a while before i get my arse back in gear.

anyway.i should be packing the last suitcase an starting to clean.

ben youv been a star, the best buddy in the world. its been the best thing in the world to watch you grow into your personality and confidence. your alot differant to how you were at the beginnning an its deffinatly a cool thing. i love you an hannah, like i said its like when you bite two jelly babies in half an then squish them together.thats how i see you two in my head hehehe. i hope you can come round lots in the summer.

kelvin you have been a fellow bitch when iv needed one an a constant source of entertainment and debate. despite my initial fear at how intense and psychadelic your personality was i did get on really well with you an enjoyed every facet of your shiny self.i hope your summer and mine isnt anywhere as grim as we suspect it will be an il look forward to seeing you soon for the punk festival.hopefully il have monkey rage echoing through my brain hole for eternity. hehehe love ya dude.

aarron, dude from that first night when you dropped your pants in my room to last night seeing you all smoochy woochy with karen you have been the pain in the arse brother that iv always needed to beat me up and shout me down.im sure wel fight lots in the house next year and to be honest im kinda looking forward to it hehe.im gonna miss you loads and hope you get to do all that exotic shit you plan to do over summer. live the dream buddy.

ok so theres a shitload more people, andy, hannah, kayla, the girls on my floor, my chick jess, paul on D. an i wanna tell you all youv left a mark i promise. we are the main core though. poor and tired and lazy and smelly and stoopid and argumentative and all the rest. hehehe as kelv says when sozzled, ""i wuv yo guys man""!

well unless i think of more stuff to add later im done for now. gonna get packed up and shipped out or james will shout at me. laters people"

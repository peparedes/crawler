I decided that I'd like to buy some anime soundtracks.... Cowboy bebop for one... I definatly want the Hellsing soundtrack too. I think anime is actually great for about 5 reasons....

1.there are some excellent japanese bands that get introduced to you through anime soundtracks.
2.the fandom gets huge... in google there are over 3,000 hits for the most popular anime pictures.
3.it can provide a good topic of conversation... e.g. ""want to come over and watch Hellsing tomorrow?""
  ""Have you seen what happens at the end of read or die?"" ""what do you think about Neon genesis evlangeon?""
4.you can have flaming matches with your ex by shouting how much you thought his fave giant robot/mecha anime is really, really stupid and strange.
5.they are great for drawing practice. copy all the nuances of a screenshot and you will have learnt something.
I'm sure there is more but right now I can't be arsed to put them here."

"event","I saw a person on the bus today who looked just like Enrico Maxwell from Hellsing.
Exact face shape and everything! they were wearing jeans and a t-shirt though.

besides that, my school has us going back to school on a thursday. Why? because it's the second of the month. what about letting us have two days off, huh? 
it's as mean as making people stay at school when there's only a week till christmas.

grrrr.  all work and no play makes Raven an unhappy student. I prefer school to work experience though... You only learn how to use copiers and staple in an office. the food was good though, although the dumb A3 copier kept getting jammed. 
well I didn't mind indexing stuff.... it was calming, as opposed to annoying when the fax machine stopped and I threatened it (with the prospect of a screwdriver in the guts) and made the receptionist laugh. franking letters was fun too. if you didn't watch out you could end up with a label franked twice. and there was a nice guy I met in accounts who used to walk me home... he was 22 though, so I didn't want to egg him on. I'm about five years younger than he is.

I want to do a comic online, but I don't know what to do it on. I have an idea for a person who gets a mask that transforms her into a beast-girl and fights evil, or one about a group of people who are given superpowers so they can kick super-villain's butts, but I'm not good at drawing villains. I end up thinking : 'hey, this is a good design, I'll make him/her a hero instead... so now I have 6 heroes when I started off with 4. (and growing by the week...)

I was going to have the name of the characters in the second one as : Falcon, Mia,Woody,Insin,Bethany and Raven. I know that the last one is also my screen name, but my real name isn't Raven, I just WANT it to be."

"event","yesterday I saw a guy... he was wearing what looked to be a business suit and was holding a clipboard.... we (nan 'n me) were eating some toast when there was a knock at the door. I looked outside, and about 3 doors down, the guy was singing in a tenor voice something like ' the last goodbye'............ he must have knocked on our door trying to sell something, but got sidetracked. 

and people say I'm weird."

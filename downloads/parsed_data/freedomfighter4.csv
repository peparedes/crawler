"event","sorry i haven't updated in a while. i've been busy. i just wanted to leave you this note:

this is a time to reflect on the past year. the 365 days that flew by as if nothing. the important and the not so important.

i'm taking this time to really look back at the year. all the great people i've met and the wonderful things they've done. i realize how lucky i am to be me. i wouldn't want to be anyone elce. you all make my life complete! even tho there are days when i think life isn't worth it anymore, i can always count on a smiling face to lift my spiritsa and carry me through another day. 

this world is what you make it. the people i've met this year made my world a much better place. the things you all have done to help me cannot be repaid in materials. if i don't give each and everyone of you a hug, then i'll personally beat myself up! lol.

this is yet another extravagant thank you note to each and every one of you! there are many more who will never see this journal entry! to them i send my best wishes and will personally tell them! 

YOU GUYS ARE THE BEST!! 

love eternally,
Melissa
aka- the most loved person in the world!"

"event","hey guys... i am soo sorry that i haven't posted in a while. things have been hectic. we've been cleaning like crazy to get ready for Thanksgiving. i can't wait!! it is soo much fun when my family gets together!!! its one big party!! lol
-------------
ok... update on the guy issue... he totally understood where i was coming from. i don't think he stopped liking me tho.. but he called me shallow. HELLO!! doing drugs is a big thing.. how can you call someone shallow for not wanting to be associated with that. ok.. i just needed to say that. but he and i are cool now! lol... OTHER GUY PROBLEM!! ok.. earlier.. WAY earlier.. i told you about mike. well he came up today. it took me a lot of energy to stay away from him. if he thinks that i'm gonna fall on my knees and kiss his feet, he's got another thing coming to him. he uses me for whenever his romantic life is at a slump. I'M TIRED OF IT!! he needs to eigther stay with me or not because i'm tired of waiting for him. grr.... i hate him! you know how theres that one person that you can't stand what he/she does, but ur drawn to them anyway. thats the way i feel about mike. and i hate myself for it. ok.. done with that.. END OF STORY... NEXT PAGE IN MY LIFE PLEASE!!
------------
I GOT MY LETTERMAN JACKET!! i was soo excited when i got it... its nice and warm. i'm wearing it now. i have a phobia that if i take it off it might burst into flames or something.. i know.. i'm weird... well.. i guess that's everything thats happened to me!! i'll respond later!!

(you're the only people i have in english! lol.. jp.. u mean everything to me even outside of english.) i just wanna know that i can still talk to them, that they will treat me like a human again... to know that i can talk to them and they won't get mad. i wanna let one of them know that the reason i didn't confess to her face is because it's impossible to tell her ANYTHING to her face without causing the third world war. i also wanna let her know that she DOES have friends that care about her. i care about her even tho i did what i did. i wasn't thinking strait. she sould understand. she even told me that when she's frustrated or sad, she doesn't think strait, so i guess you'd understand. if you ever read this, respond or call me! i need to talk to you!

Youre the type of girl<br>who always has a crush and is writing their<br>name on all your books. You are a hopeless<br>romantic. Waiting for that prince charming, you<br>take love seriously, but still play any chance<br>you get. You can have a lot if boys who are<br>friends, but waiting for that perfect<br>boyfriend. Sometimes you are discouraged<br>because there are no sparks but even if the<br>smallest thing happens, youre on Cloud 9.  You<br>believe in true love and wait for it. Just dont<br>be afraid to take a chance. Love is all about<br>risks.

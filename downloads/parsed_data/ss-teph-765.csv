"event","ok so i haven't posted a real entry in such a long time, and i dont feel the need to review everything in my life. but there a few things i need to mention;

-senior year is more than halfway over. i graduate in almost 4 months. that is unreal
-ive gotten into every college i applied to so far, 2 more to go. although i have so many options, i know exactly where i want to be.
-im currently in my longest relationship, ever. almost 4 months and i couldnt be happier, honestly. 
-the lingering questions of afterprom in montauk loom over my head, i promised joey i'd ask by the end of vacation, so we'll see what happens
-alyssa came for a couple days and we had so much fucking fun. 
-i'm happy

and ive realized over these past couple of weeks how much i've grown up. its really nice. and not just me, everyone. there's no drama anymore (except with dumb boys), we always have a good time, we know our limits (well, except for birthday girls but its allowed), and i think were realizing (or at least i am) that high school is going to be over in 4 months. thats something you'll never get back so im trying to have the best time and not let stupid shit get in my way. hopefully the next couple months will be as good as these past couple have been. honestly, i love our class. playfest was the epitome of our class's perfection and honestly i love how close our grades been getting. im going to be 18 in 2 months."

life can get depressing, upsetting, sad, long, confusing, tiring, stressful, and everything else that we complain about...but it's nice once in a while to htink about everything we had, have, and will have in our lives. 

i dont know why i'm feeling phylisophical tonight. maybe it's the fact that i'm finally realizing how much people mean to me, and how much my life would be different if they weren't in it. and how much people and things meant to me, and even though they might not be here now, something about their presence still lingers within me. maybe it's the fact that i am actually going to college, and nothing will ever be the same after this summer, and i'm completely ready for it. i'm ready for big things to happen. maybe its the fact that i've spent completely too much time with my family this weekend, but it wasnt half as bad as i imagined.

walking into your house expecting to feel comforted and welcomed by a dog jumping on you, so excited to see that you've come home to see him... and then him not being there and instead, an empty cage. the house feels cold and empty without him. i really miss him. whats worse is dropping food on the floor and expecting an automatic clean up by him. bending down to get the dropped food makes me so sad. i cant even explain why something so insignificant such as picking food off the floor makes me sadder than a lot of things, or maybe i just did. i dont know."

"event","one of the saddest things to ever witness is your dad crying. dads are not supposed to cry. theyre supposed to stay strong and hold everything together. but, in reality, theyre only human. on saturday we had to put jasper to sleep because he couldnt move and his pulse was barely noticable. saturday morning was also the day i left for syracuse, for my final, senior championships trip. saying goodbye to my dog, my best fried, my confident, my protecter, my pups was the hardest thing ive ever done. i know it was for the best though. i know it was. but seeing my dad cry and seeing him lay there so helpless. god that is one image i dont want to remember. going to syracuse and being surrounded by friends was definitly a good thing, a good way to forget that my baby was no longer there. but once i came back, all i could think about was how quiet the house was and how it felt like there was this empty space. i keep coming home and thinking about having to take him out, or feed him or him running up to me and jumping all over me. but then i walk in and its quiet and empty. i dont feel confortable being alone in the house anymore. 

this is an especially touchy subject for me. the main reason being that no one knew him like i did. except my dad. we were basically the only ones that cared about his existance. i wish my friends couldve seen him the way i did. or anyone for that matter. i remember in 1st grade when i stole 10$ from brandon for snacks at lunch i came home sobbing and my mom told me to go let out my emotions to jasper because she was too mad at me and i was sobbing and i just layed next to him and cried and fell asleep and i still havent forgotten that and it was 11 years ago and i never want to.

its just so fucking quiet around here, i never thought i'd miss his bark so much."

"event","i have to say that this weekend was quite a good one. 

friday was pep rally/float night. pep rally was in the auditorium which was weird but since the bleachers are getting redone, there was no place else. it was alright. then went slut shirt shopping with ray to mandees, had a little fun. successful. then float night. our float turned out pretty sick. we were new years. except me and aimee's devil which we spent a good 2 hours on fell over, but i'll get over that fact. because we won anyway.

saturday was homecoming. parade was terrible as usual but what can you do. LAST ONE! football game at csh was weird also, they lost =[. halftime show was actually not too bad. katy and brad won homecoming king and queen. i saw tommy, lisa and kelly and it made my day. ive missed them so much. after the game it was basically, time to dress up to get messed up. operation:success. except for megan. which i felt really bad about but didnt really realize what happened until afterwards and her not being there anymore. fucking 25 people got suspended and 11 went to the hospital (or so say the rumors) thats fucking insane. a record. huntington at its finest. supposedly no more dances in the future. too bad we're graduating! still sucks that it was our senior year where all this happened. oh well. we went to rachel's beforehand which was fun and then made our way to the dance. i somehow made it in and held myself together. i can honestly say ive never had so much fun. to say the least. i accomplished a very important goal. and im happy. hahah. afterwards plans got fucked up but we still had fun at bridgets. 

arlington the next day at 8am was an experience in itself. i love arlington. that is probably the best thing about marching band, that show up there. i just love it so much. its hard to explain. the show, the people, the scenery. me and dan want to drive there next year. we'll see how that plays out. we didnt play our best but we got 3rd out of 5. not too bad but we can do better. 
after i got home i hung out with tommy and aimee. ive missed him. seeing him and being just as close as we were before things got messed up makes me realize that everything always works out. it really does. 

today ive just been working on applications and work all day. wrote a draft of my essay that i actually really like so thats good. 

but right now. life couldnt be better. and im loving every second of it.
honestly, what a good weekend."

"event","ok so basically. i'm stressing over college right now. this application process is making me crazy. i have 11 schools that im applying to definitly. here's the final list:

SUNY Geneseo
SUNY Buffalo
SUNY Cortland (safety, i dont really want to go here)
U. Maryland
U. Delaware
Boston University
Northeastern University
U. Pittsburgh
U. Mass Amherst
Syracuse University
Ithaca College

even though i have this whole long list, there isnt one school that i am like, dying to get into. theres always a negative. i wish there was one i was passionate about, but there isnt. Geneseo is right now that one, but i hate where its located aka middle of nowhere. I havent been to Boston yet, but im sure once i go there i'll probably love BU and Northeastern, but too bad theyre both really quite expensive. Then there's Maryland which is great but so big. I havent been there either. Who knows. im just stressing about these. And my essay is going nowhere. i keep changing my mind every second. jeesus.


besides college, senior year is quite stressful as well. homecoming this weekend, i dont even know what is going to happen with my mom and what she's going to let me do and what not. im mainly stressing about that right now. and on top of it, arlington is the day after meaning a 6 am bus ride and possibly my mom being like ""earlier curfew since you have to be up early tomorw"" and im going to kill her if she does that. its my fucking senior year let me ahve some fun. honestly. she needs to realize this.  what else. band it going well. indoor show the other day, we got outstanding which was good. fasted today, shitty as usual but got through it. this has been such a jumble of an update. whatevs"

And will most likely only live another 6 months, if that. We have to give him these steriods to prevent it from growing bigger, but they make him thirsty, and as an effect, he has to pee about every 2 hours. its all quite sad, and i dont want to see my dog in pain, but i dont want to put him to sleep either. =[ So sad i love him. he makes me feel safe. and although no one else can attest to it (besides the vet and our cleaning lady) he really means well and is sweet. ugh im just getting myself upset right now. stop

We are proposals in a cosmic nursery 
And these massive stars -- they're just little twinkles 
If I can't possess them at such magnificence 
So if you can really hear me, 
And you really think you believe in it 
Then there must be some kind of privelege here 
To putter around with such an existence 
And if you see me on some stage 
And you believe it's really me over there 
Well, there's a chance it's not really me 
Maybe we're not ourselves at all 
And maybe being is simply believing that each breath we take in 
Must lead to another breath out, one more breath away from yesterday

"event","so, after last week being a little rocky on a certain front...these past couple of days have been amazing and completely made up for it. ive been making a lot of money this past week which is excellent. saturday night was such a good time...until i got too drunk and that's a whole other story. but it was fun for the most part. i had a first time experience with something and it wasnt bad at all. it was alyssa's birthday i love her to death. she's leaving too soon :(. i wish i had a piece of that cake. we sucked so much at pong but by that point we were too drunk to notice i think. it must happen again soon but this time i don't want to be the only asshole. i wont allow it. 

sunday denise, aimee, greg, kailene and i went on rachel's boat. i think it might have been the best day of the summer so far. i really enjoyed it so much. we went to this marina, parked the boat, went to the ocean/beach for a long time, ate alot, played kemps (no comment), jet skiied (and fell), and jumped off high boats backwards eyes closed. it was such a good good day. a little while back rachel posted a lj about if she was to name a few points in her life where if she died, she would be completely happy, and i think that might have been one of those days. that sounds weird when you think about it, but its just that good. i hope we do it again soon, it was amazing. such a good day.

today was very good as well. picked up greek salad and dunkin donuts for aimee and myself and we ate, played cards, chatted and swam. it was beautiful. and i love her a lot. then band tonight which, could have been so much worse. we got pizza and bonded. we are also making SUCH good progress with the music which is so so hard to play. its making me feel really good about this season. we're almost done with movement 2..which at first attempt, i almost cried because it was so hard. getting through it really makes me feel better about learning the rest of the show. just one ballad which shouldnt be bad but movement 5 is a killer. (there's no four) At the end of this summer though, we are going to be the sicked pit ever. playing these shows is going to be so fun, im pumped. then after we had this whole talk with our new tech, melissa, (who is pretty good) about how if we focus better, we have potential to be the best pit on long island. and considering this is a compltely pit oriented show, thats a huge compliment and something work towards.. im excited!

i got my AP score today...4!! so happy about that. i feel like everything paid off definitely. especially since brandon got a 3. heheh

jasper is doing better. still no results from the biopsy..but i'm hoping for the best. 

if the rest of summer can be just as good as these past couple of days have been, i will be so unbelievebly happy."

(besides finding a job etc)


i saw some camp girls last night and it made me so happy. i just don't realize how much i miss them until i see them for the first time in months. it makes everything so much better. theyre so much fun, grr why dont i see them enough? like molly said, i miss being at kenwal everyday during the summer, but it is nice to not have the commitment but still see them (hopefully) a ton on weekends etc. we are going to have sick parties this summer, im so excited. and alyssa is here! so good to see her. 

in other news, besides the two regents i have coming up which i havent studied for whatsoever, summer is here and this past week has been great. things are so good, and for the first time i actually have someone to care about/someone that cares about me just as much. its such a good feeling. and i can't get enoughh...

if this past week is a glimpse as to what summer will be like, i can't be more excited. i have the best of everything. im so thankful

now off to watch some soccer with my father, seeing as it is father's day and it's actually interesting.

"event","so i have come to the realization that this year is just full of one disapointment after another.
i honesty can say that this is by far the worst year of school i have ever had.
and hopefully nothing will ever come close to this again.
if i didnt have my friends in my life, i can bet you that i wouldnt be here right now. i would probably be in an institution or something.
i love them so much.
i drank a large coffee tonite at 9:00. im sure that this will keep me up way past my bed time.
i still cant get over how much i hate this year right now. 
lets recap
-decision to quit swimming (worst thing i ever had to do)
-oboe auditions (big disapointment)
-sat practice tests= all below 1200 (bigger disapointment)
-winter track, try hard - no improvement.
-ap us, studystudystudy much more than anything ive ever studied before - no improvement
-spring track- getting replaced on my pride and joy ""temporarily""= biggest disapointment yet.
-whats next? i dont even want to think about it.
i hate letting myself/people i care about down and i have no one to blame anymore but myself."

last weekend was milrose and playfest. milrose was awesome, so good. i wish i was good 
playfest was amazing we did so great. the seniors really got it together this year though, and their play was equally as good, so we thought they deserved it. ours was so close though. it was real funny. my hair was pretty insane. i loved it
this weekend we went to jersey. it was REAL GOOD. i love them so much. me and rachel bonded, i love her.
(""Im not tired, are you tired? no are you tired? no.."")

so much stuff has been going on.
lauries sweet 16 a few weeks ago was amazing, i love all of those people so much. 
and every time i see them i second guess my decision of not working there and being with them for every summer again.
yeah i love lifegaurding, and im almost positive im doing it again this year, but i just miss them and i feel so left out all summer. expecially on weekends when they all hang out and i have to work. it sucks but i try as hard as possible. i'm so damn busy.always
i dont even want to get started on how much these next couple of months are going to tire me out.
caffeine is starting to become my best friend.  
track is going ok. i havent gotten better (or worse for that matter). just the same. which i mean its better than sucking, but id rather have drops in my times. 
so i was talking to my dear frien gil the other day
and he might not be able to do spring track this year
if he cant, im going to be pissed
i miss that man. even if he is an ass, says inapropriate things, and is jsut gil
he knows what he's talking about 
and when i do shitty he's like big poppa. 
hahahah not so much
but he's nice
and most of the time he's not so bad
i just miss him more since i havent done swim
and tate has no idea what to do when it comes to sprinting.
and he's an ass.
it was meg's birthday yesterday. saturday we had so much fun. 
ive made a bunch of closer friends this year and i'm really happy about it. 
i love them
and once rachel gets her stupid pictures online maybe ill put some of the tamer ones up here. 
we had fun, thats all i'll say.
and jersey is going to be sweet, i can't wait to spend a weekend with my best friends partying it up.

"event","i have too many responsibilties. i'm commiting myself to too much. i have no time to relax. i have too much work. i need money; therefore a job, but i have zero time. drivers ed will start in a while. sat classes start next week. physical therapy is once every week or more. i have to build a bridge by monday. dbq is monday. essay and project for english on the worst book imaginable, due friday. along with the take home test in apus. monday i have practice and a sat class. a long one because we have a test. tuesday i have a late late meet. wednesday i have practice and haircut. thursday i have practice and physical therapy. WHEN WILL IT END. honestly. once i think the worst is over, it comes on twice as bad. i have so much shit to do, its never going to get done. and im stressed because of fucking band which always has to be a problem so i had to change an sat class to mondays. and i have to learn a new instrument. and supossidly winter percussion is not even a option for me to bail on ""if i want to be section leader next year"". which is such bullshit because lisa didnt do it and she was section leader this year. they piss me off so much. and ngojsagkankv;a. im just stressed. you probably didnt want to read all that. but i dont care. and arizona, what most would think to be a relaxing week off, was just the opposite. so that didnt help either. all i want to do is be in my bed. thats ALL."

"event","rent was beautiful. absolutly amazing. i cried so much, i was a mess. i think everyone was. and i loved how looking around you saw so many people mouthing the words and it was just amazing. i loved it, of course things were changed but thats what you have to do for a movie. they did a really good job though. of course, the play will always be better, but i love the fact that when this comes out on video, i can watch it WHENEVER i want to, and not have to pay like 50 bucks to go into the city and whatnot. especially if the show closes soon. how greattttt

yesterday a sweet day. we did basically nothing in school, shortened periods, early dismissal. we did like nothing at practice. then captains, which is a whole other story. theyre theresa, me, meghan rhodes and erin fritts. mixed feelings about it. whats done is done though, im happy she chose me, but in other ways its just weird. dont get me wrong though, im excited. and then i get home and i have a thing from the yacht club, they gave us all $50 as a thank you for the summer and a holiday bonus. what good timing. then we saw RENT which was just a really amazing time and thats about it. loves it"

"event","im so boreddd. no ones home for the whole day. i have work and shit to do that i dont feel like doing at all. but ill leave that for later. 

harry potter came out friday. let me just tell you, i LOVED it. although it was rushed and they cut out a lot of important stuff, it still was amazing. i think it was better than the first 3, theyre so grown up i love it. rent comes out on wednesday, so excited for that. im so interested to see everything from a 3 dimensional view, things they had trouble showing on stage will be like unbelievable in the movie. (aka la vie boheme) 

i am bored with life. i need something new and exciting."

"event","track sort of started. technically starts tomorrow, but there's been ""open workouts"". and boy do i need them. im so out of shape. i Need to get better this year. i know i can if i take it seriously. blaaaaaaah.

hm. what has happened? i cant even remember. last week i saw the Fray and Ben Folds with aimeeeee. it was pretty sweet. we werent too happy with ben's song selections; he played a lot of the newer stuff which isnt as good as the old-ish ones...but overall he was and always will be amazing and i loved seeing him again. 

hmm. oh yeah ladies night was grand, 3 hour tv marathons at rachels was pretty swell. 1st quarter is over thank god. and im actually doing really well.

hahahaha i promise i didnt mean for that to rhyme.

ahhsfhgsfhnh i got a typrewriter, from my grandparents theyre moving and had to get rid of it. its so amazing, i love it. hahah

hp4 comes out fridayyyy so excited, obviously already got tickets
whice brings me to my final thought of the day:
theres this whole awkward situation that needs to got away right now. its so weird, and at this point a little ridiculous, becase quite franky its never going to happen and it needs to stop. only certain people will know what im refering to, and i hope other people read it and get a clue. thank you and goodbye"

"event","so i just cleaned my room . i dont know. i love cleaning. haha once i get started i just do every sinlge thing. i did my closet, desk, floor, everything. it looks so much better. i still have a million pictures in frames that arent on the wall yet, so ill do that soon. and i love finding things you thought you had lost like 49275 years ago. 

and i also love being able to make plans without being like ""oh no i have band tomrow"" ahah its the best. i love being free.

me and jasper had bonding time before, i loved it.
last night he got a lttle carried away and tried to climb onto the couch with me. hahaha sorry your like 75-80 pounds. thats a no go.

and um. mr dumar is a little shit and i cant stand him. ive hated him from the first day of school and it hasnt gotten any better. let me just say that as of now im doing the worst in english and the best in physics. when does that ever happen? im supposed to be good at english and shitty in any kind of math/scinece. but when he gives us these piece of shit essays, nOIFshaouahdgjla i cant stand him. impromptu today he wasnt even there to clarify, it was weird. and i dont hate him just because he gives me bad grades, its because i feel like he's constantly judging me. and others. and he even says it himself, him and his lover mrs irvolino or wahtever the fuck her name is are the ""mean girls"" of the teachers andd talk about their students. i jsut dont like him. he can't teach. he DOES'NT teach. and i think i could probably write more on HIS life than i could on the book we are currently reading. how fucked up is that? 

ah. rants are completly neccesary."

"event","ok. so much has happened. we went to syracuse, and came in 7th. out of 7. but i played my best show and we can blame the score on mr evens. actually, blame the whole show and everything on him. he basically ruined the season, but we made the best of it i suppose. had a lot of fun though. im going to miss lisa and kelly so much next year, its going to be so weird. 

few things learned while on the trip:
 potato soup is good. so are lunches that come in BOXES 
 there was no pee in the toilet, it was just yellow lights. 
 how to check to see if mirrors were double sided or something. (miss p is physco.) 
 we bring way too much food and never eat it all. 
 ""quality inn"" does not actually mean quality.
 mista b and dave ARE IN FACT twins.
 aaron evens is a dousche. (and unemployed)
 copaigue sucks and will always sucks whether they got 1st or not.
 im a huge loser, but i love every minute of it.
 bus rides with speakers+ipods are more like dance parties.
 ""my humps"" will be the official song of the season.
 i say the word ""poop"" extrmemly funny if you ask some people. me personally i dont understand. poop
 syracuse is beautiful
 and most of all, you can never take too many pictures.

awesome.

we took a vote whether to march the show in pheonix which would mean SO many rehersals or just to do the parade. vote went to a yes, but then to a no. thank goodness. its going to be sick, looked at the hotel website today - its suite. (hahah i crack myself up..sweet.) and yeah. things are good at the moment i love this MONTHHH:

monday: BEN FOLDS WITH AIMEE!!<33 SOOOOO excited
tuesday: no school aka knit-o-rama
friday: no school
next friday (18th): HP!!
23: RENT RENT RENTTT.

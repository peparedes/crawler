"event","yes. christmas is so so so close. i absloutely adore christmas and the holiday season and shopping in the crowded malls and the decorations all along Barrington st and Spring Garden and peoples parties and the last day of school when people are giving each other cards and little gifts and carrying a tree home in the cold new years eve and i even love those annoying family functions you're obliged to go to every year. i thikn my favorite Murphy-Barteaux tradition is evenry christmas eve me and my parents sit on the coach, in the dark watching tv and eating cheese. we do it every year, it's unintentional but i love it.

      this is going to be a sweet weekend. tonight me and adam and my folks are going to get a christmas tree. than on saturday i ride in the morning than in the afternoon adam and i and my mom are going christmas shopping. and than on sunday adam and i are baking cookies for everyone. =) i'm excited, this should all be awesome. and on tuesday, the last day of school, we're going to mary-dan's formal, potluck party. i am so excited for that, i get to dress up and everything. ^.^

"event","we got a christmas card in the mail today. atcually, its just a post card posing as a christmas card with a picture of john lennon on it sent to my mother by one of her burnt-out hippy friends. but, its cool none-the-less.

 so i guess i suck at this livejournal thing, i haven't updated anything in a while. but its not like you're missing much. i haven't been up to much lately, but i'm tired. this next film is driving ym crazy, i don't know what i'm suposto do. i'm done my huge chem project which is due tomorrow. i did the ""Chemistry in Music"" cards. i like it. today i borrowed zonia's dog and walked around for 2 hours. it was very cold but it was fun, lotsa time to think. great company too =)

 yesterday i had my apointment...at that place...to get those things....
i got birth control pills. i told adam and i told my mom. i only told my mom not because i trust her or i want to be honest with her or anything, i only told her so i could get them for free on her medical plan. i thought she'd freak out more than she atcually did so that was good. very good infact. i don't tell my parents anything usually, i dont trust them at all. especally not my mom.

 so...i'm gonna go. call adam, listen to music and try to get inspired for a film.

   yestreday i was on my way to see my tutor and i saw the coolest thing. there were these 2 crows ripping appart a tim hortons bag on the median in the middle of the street. so i went over to them and watched them for a second. i relised i had a granola bar in my bag so i took it out and gave it to them. it was so cute, they both came hopping over as soon as they relised i had food. and they let me get really close to them too. anyways, one was just picking up the pieces and eating it but the other one was walking around, picking up pieces and holding as many as possable in a row in his mouth. when i got up to leave the one with all the pieces in his mouth flew up ahead of me, stuck his face in some leaves and burried his food. i guess saving it for later. it was really cool, i got so close to them and they were both really beautiful.

 other than hanging out with crows, i'm trying to get an idea for my next film. we either have to do a music video ro a western. i am doing a music viedo. i could just work with peter but i'm not so wild about his idea so i'm trying to think of an idea to do on my own. so far, the leading idea is kinda simmilar to my rope,""Completely"" film. i wanna do it for ""i got a girl"" by the tripping daisys and i'd have a girl who keeps her boyfriend on a leash bascally and than at night when she's sleeping he plots to escape. i haven't decided if he escapes yet or not. if anyone has any ideas, please tell me! it's really hard to have to be so cr3eative over and over again in a very specific way and within very small time confindes. 

 anyways, i'm off to find some music..."

"event","it means porn star in itallian and its the name of my most recent film. we had to do comedies in film and video. peter, mal and i did a film about a guy who is addicted to porn so badly that everything he sees he fabtasises into a porno situation. its pretty funny. and i have a cameo. after he tries to grab ay me, i kick peter in the crotch at a bus stop. zonia played out porn star and she was awsome. i spent all day editing, i didnt go to a single class which was a bitch and i'm not even finished.

 i saw the best movie ever on the weekend. i saw RENT and now i know why so many people are in love with it. it was just so damn good!it was fablous, we all loved it. i want the soundtrack for christmas *hint*hint* i wish that in real life, every emotion could be expressed so fully and fluently in elaborate group singing. it was so sad too. i cried in public and in front of all my friends, thats not something i do very often. when it was over i just started crying and crying and i couldn't stop. it was great! what made it so emotional i thikn was that, in the end all the happy songs the couples and friends sung together or to each other, they sung them sadly and that deffentally got to me. i love crying in movies. Adam refused to go see ti with me and he deffentally missed out. 

 other than that, not too much has been going on. we jumped in my lesson on saturday, i rode Norman and ihave deffentally forgotten how to jump. my body just totally forgot and flops around like an idiot. hopefully we'll jump a bit more so i can remember. =)

"event","i had an awsome A-block free yesterday. after i came out of the library, i went to find people. they were in the youth health center so i joined them. turns out they were in the midths of this huge group discussion about depression, peoples issues, OCD, self-immage, heartbreak, boys, relationships, drugs etc. it might sound kinda depressing but it was really awsome. it was wicked to have all these people listning to you and contributing. it was a real female bonding, girl power moment. i wish all my frees were that eventful.

 i also had this super intence riding lesson list night. i rode Good Intentions (Peter) and he's a great horse but i am not very good at riding him. i've only ridden him twice so maybe i just need to figure him out a bit more. anyway, it was pouring and all the wind and rain was so loud in the arena and jill was yelling at us and pete was running around...i thought i was going to die.

 Star Quest tonight, i'm excited. its bascally a coffee house turned into a tallent show turned into an americal idol style thing which is kinda stupid. i like coofee house because its so chill and relaxed and people feel free to play music or whatever. but with this, they're being judged which i'm sure turend a lot of people off. i'm just excited because jessi is mcing it with garfie. adam and i are going and so is pratically everyone else i know so it should be fun. i'm stoked.

 in closing, i would also like to say that mr.mallay is the worst film teacher ever. i could teach that course better than he is.

"event","i wrote most of this next post on the bus on the way to adam's house yesterday. i was so pissed off and frustrated that i just kinda ran off and didnt return to school that afternoon. plus, film and video is so ill conducted that it's just a waste of time anyway. in the end, i had an awsome afternoon/evening with adam, alex and loreal but i guess i'll back track and explain why i was so pissed.

 i found out yesterday that sean, the boy i dated for a good chunk of last year, has been telling a certain friend of mine that i was ""sooOOOoOO mean to him"" and what a ""terrable girlfriend"" i was. i'm pretty sure he's telling her this in attempts to get a pity date out of her (which she is too smart for anyway. she doesnt need crap like that.)but it really bothers me that he would say that. i was mean to him? i don't think so. at most, i rightly defended myself. i was the one who gave him more chances than i could count, i'm the one who pratically developed an eating disorder/neurosis over that relationship, i'm the one who was lied to and ditched so much that being betrayed became pratically a normal way of life to me. and whats sad is that i'm the one who could have put a stop to it anytime. but i didn't. i gave him chance after chance thinking that if only i had more time, if only i could get skinnier or prettier or smarter he would like me again and treat me better. obviously if my own boyfriend wouldnt pay attetion there was something secriously wrong with me. i never once thought maybe he was the one with the porblem. it was obviously because i was fat or stupid or ugly. i honestly believed that for the entire legnth of our relationship.

 after screwing up oh-so-badly on the ""probation-win-me-back-from-this-cute-kid-with-a-mohawk"" week i finally called it quits and i have moved on. when we broke up he was the one who suggested we remain friends and i was very much open to that idea but he's been the one who's been imature and remains bitter towards me. i dont go around bad mouthing him and i don't use our crappy relationship in attempts to get sympathy or dates and neither should he. it's over, done with and dead. my only regret is that his presence tantes so many of my memories of last year, which, in spite of him was a pretty good year.

 November 25 of 2004 was when we first got together. almost a whole year ago. if he is still pining over me, i hope he gets over it soon. but if he wants to bad mouth me to my own friends, i hope he chokes.

   <3 Courtney, he doesn't even deserve the time of day from you.

"event","yeah, i really don't like indian food. or at least the indian food my non-indian family tries to make. but than again, i'm not a huge fan of spicey food to begin with. 

i didn't do too much today so unfortunally i can't have a super-exciting first livejournal entry. and that hurts me deeply :'( i went to my tutor today. if you didn't allready know i have a tutor who tries to teach me chemistry. please send her your deepest condolences. i meet her at the Kilam Library, Dal's library and i always feel like such a lame-wad there. it's full of these cool looking university student (well, duh...) who sit there looking so smart and so hip drinnking their expensive hipster coffee drinks with their cool, smart hipster firends and i'm just a dork. i have no coffee. i'm still in high school. i'm barely legal for crying out loud. anyways, thats the price i must pay to pass chem. =p

yesterday was Adam's birthday. atcually his birthday was on the 17h but we celebrated it yesterday. He got presents and cake and everything. On friday night we were invited to go to his mom's house for dinner which i though was going to be terrably awkard. you see, the first time i met his mother i was on my way to get a tattoo and the second time i met her i was the drunkest i've ever been in my entire life. obviously i am a good influence on her impressionable, innocent Adam. but dinner went well on friday. maybe she didn't remember when i was drunk? we had dinner, played board games, Adam and i drew her a picture that imediately got put on the fridge and Adam's mom was very impressed with my ability to tie knots in cherry stems in my mouth. obviously i'm a good girlfriend if i can do that ;) i even got a hug on the way out so i think i have been accepted by the LeBlanc's. =)

 anyway. i must be off. i have a chem lab to do. i must keep up my awsome 72 average =/

You say that we've got nothing in common
No common ground to start from
And we're falling apart
You'll say the world has come between us
Our lives have come between us
Still I know you just don't care

And I said, 'What about Breakfast at Tiffany's'
She said, 'I think I remember the film
And as I recall, I think, we both kinda liked it'
And I said, 'Well, that's one thing we got'

I see you...The only one who knew me
And now your eyes see through me
I guess I was wrong
So what now? It's plain to see we're over
And I hate when things are over
When so much is left undone

AnD I said, 'What about Breakfast at Tiffany's'
She said, 'I think I remember the film
And as I recall, I think, we both kinda liked it'

"event","um time for a little rant..and whoever wants can get mad...cuz well i dont care this is my opinion and my jurnal, so yea. umm i was looking at a few old and new entries of my friends on this thing and just started laughing about how they all complain and make fun of the whole bush thing. Um well first of all this pisses me off because well im a republican(or atleast will be techniqually when i can vote) and what pisses me off the most is how ignorant and uninformed many of them are. im not saying all of them..but so many of them. I try having a mature debate with them and they have no TRUE information of why they hate bush so much. And they think clinton was amazing..umm yea ok his affair doesnt effect the whole country..but he fucking lied under oath!!! thats purgery! hmm...i always thought honesty was a good quality for a president..but i guess mayhbe im wrong. And as if kerry would make an o so amazing president...umm he didnt get the nick name ""flip-flop"" for no reason..and his plans for plans? yea ok those are great to. and lets umm fuck the rich people because they have money. guess that sucks for his wife then.... you all think bush is so stupid and will make a horrible president which is so completely off. lets see..the things they make fun of for bush: choking on a pretyzl(have u never CHOKED before??/), mis-pronouncing nuclear(have u never said something wrong before?) cmon now..he cant be that stupid he fucking graduated from yale. And the fact that hes been elected and RELECTED shows something now doesnt it? I dont know, i mean i know and i understand that we all have our opinions. and thats fine...but what annoys me the most are two things: 1. whining and complaining how ""the worlds gonna fall apart and were all doomed"" and 2. when people are so misinformed and end up hating bush because there friends do..or cause its ""cool""

1. If the world was gonna end, it would have been when clinton was president. its sad bush has to take over and clean up clintons mess. Bush was raised in the heartland of america and atleast is down to earth and not in fucking hollywood getting his botox and fake tan done. He wants whats right for this country and is working his way to take care of it in these hard times. he wants to stand up and defend and take pride in our country..and well if you dont want that, dont call yourself an american.

2.this one is really frustrating. i just listend to eminems new  song mosh..WHAT THE FUCK?!?! i'll admit i used to love eminem..but i hope that song gets fucking banned. All he does is influence young minds on his opinions. i understand music is a reflection of the artists feeling and opinions..but cmon now. thats ridiculous. I had a friend who used to be republican and what not. all of a sudden he/she started hanigng out with a different crowd and suddenly shes/hes hardcore liberal..and the sad part is..its just because her/his friends are. its actually kinda funny because i really dont think they even know what theyre talking about. and i mean my best friend emily who i love very much is also like that. i tried to get her to give me ONE reason why she hates bush and she couldnt. so then she sent me some website which is what i was hoping to be a good argument for her case. instead..it was a fucking site made up by some bored teenager. So i dont know thats just really naive and ignorant. 

ok, now that ive done my rant..i just want you to all know that i still love my democrat friends lol..and this was directed to all liberals. there are some democrats who actually have real reasons and stuff. i just want the fucking complaining to stop. Bush won..get over it.

have a nice day."

hm so went to the barn, nothing really exciting happened. but my good mood has ceased to exist.
Me patty and vix went to 7-11..and that was fine. so came back, helped vix tack up Annie. then watched jenn ride nelson outside with Dave. then helped vix untack. and then while annie was cooling out we hungout with dave and jenn. ::::sigh:::: i dunno..its just. vix has what id do anything to have..and she doesnt even want it persay. i mean they were hanging out each other, hugging, joking around, flirting..and i want that so fucking bad. and i mean i know vix wasnt rubbing it in my face on purpose..but it sorta felt that way. and like i dunno....id do anything jsut for like his friendship. and a part of me sorta wishes vix would help me out some. i mean its not her responisibility but like shes close with him and she knows that i really like him. i just sorta wish she would atleast help me talk to him and stuff.. but i dunno w.e ugh i had so much to say in my other entry but now i def dont feel like typing it all out..so w/e. so umm then we were driving home and the roads were really slippery and well we sorta skidded of the road and almost hit a tree. LOL..so then we are driving along and theres some random guy walking in the rain, in the dark, on a curvy dangerous back country road...did he have a death wish? lol...yea so anyways..me and vixy had a long talk and it put some things in perspective for me. but iono. she took the long road home. i like that :) i wuv car rides. but yea ive just got a lot of shit on my mind. i really need someone to talk to. as i was walking back up to give friday a treat after talking to jenn and dave i started crying. it kinda sucked. oh well..tomarrows anohter day. and im thirsty anyway. so bring on the rain."

Haha i think me and katie are twins. like seriously its freaky how much we have in common. haha GO BUSH...ok wow im so hyper and its like 11:30 pm haha im a dork. So yea i have a lot of hw though..which sucks. Lets see....monday katie gave me a ride to the barn and it was soo much fun. We blasted awesome music and went into 7-11 and i spilled slurpee everywhere and omg we saw ths hot guy and we screamed and told him he was hot..haha were such dorks. yea so i attempted to ride friday today but he totally kirked out and went nutso..so that didnt work. yea so that stupid clique at my school that hates me is still there. they are probably reading this and are gonna make fun of me for talking about my horse. well too bad for them. yes i have a horse. get over it. no im not in love iwth him and no he his not my only friend or w/e so wtf. a lot of people have horses and unless ur a horse person u dont understand. but get a life. they must have ntohing better to do then make fun of other people for stupid shit. w/e not worth my time or energy. so yea my guidance counselor is making me see her once a week and ihaveta stay after school sometimes to work on math shit. oh well...atleast my grades will be better then hopefully.

Vix drove me home. we talked about a lot of shit. it sorta made me feel better. but iono i stil feel like shit. so while vix rode annie i layed down outside on the benches and looked up at the sky. it was sorta cool...cuz mike was out galloping in the field and i could hear java..and i love the sound of a horse galloping. and i was just sorta imagining being a bird and just flying around doing as i please. woldnt that be nice.? REALITY SLAP!!!!! ok...so that was like a 2 minute euphoria. and then real life came back.I swear, im fucking poison. i attract people and then drive them away. you take a taste of me and u think o wow shes cool i like her...so u bond with me...and boom. ur dead.

"event","so just got back from the pool. it was boring. Its funny to see all these kids i went to school with all growed up lol. Its weird. I mean i grew up at that pool...brings back a lot of good memories when we were all so innocent...:::sigh:::

""i wish i was a kid again, skinned knees heal easier then broke hearts""

but its weird, cuz i want to grow up so bad too. i dont know what i want anymore. im in such a numb, empty mood. these are the dangerous moods...cuz these are the moods where i dont have much fear. so i'm spontaneous and unpredictable..but i mean its not a bad thing i guess. i believe it was a mood like this when i bought the almost black hair dye...but then my mood changed so i didnt actually go thru with dying it...yet. 

ok well im off to montgomery mall...my parents are openin up there belgian resturaunt place in the food court so we have to go check it out. alrighty...well see yasss xoxo"

"event","Alrighty...so this weekend i went to my weekend house. It was ok. i love the country so i cant complain. ok i can, but i wont. theres a lot of shit going on...but i wont go into that. i want to , but i cant. lol. so summer school is almost over woot woot..and kenny chesney is coming up! WHOOP WHOOP! haha devon its gonna be so much fun! yea..my cell phone like broke, for no reason...so i will be getting it replaced tomarrow. cuz well i cant live without a phone. sadly. Wow this is a very pointless update...and right now im in an ok mood, but let me just point out that this has been an absolutly HORRIBLE week....and i could really use a hug. and maybve some chocolate..or even just a simple. I love u. yea. thatd be nice. guess this is the hard part of not having a good boyfriend or best friend for that matter. Ugh..i hate being so alone!!So basically, i hate people. They really fuck things up. And ya know what, i think i like holding on to feelings. I think i love being in love..or infatuation atleast. i think thats why i held on to david for so long. because i liked the feeling of having someone. ithout that i felt empty,so instead of getting rid of those feeling..i just stuck them on to someone else. now im sorta over this someone else...except..well i cant stick the feelings on to anyone else...i mean i ahve a few crushes on some ppl..but not like this. that was...wow..and its still a part of me, not sure if ill ever get over him.but theres just no way. I dunno, i mean...part of me still is madly in love with him lol..the other part is just eh.I mean, i wouldnt be online right now if i wasnt waiting for him. im always waiting. its like i rely on him..and thats NOT good. god..im such a codependent person. i rely on other people soo much..which is why i get let down so much. i need to be more independent, i need to be able to make myself happy and not rely on other ppl for happyness.ughhhhhhhhhhhhhh I HATE ME!! ok sorry..just had to let that out...god i need a hug. not that i deserve it cuz well, im a shitty person.

NOICE. yea this entry is pretty pointless. i dont feel good. my jaw,back,neck,stomach,head,tooth,and chest hurt. wow thats a lot lol. ok well im madly in love with someone i cant have..but thats nothing new right? o yea.....but i temporarily got my mind off of him cuz i met my bros best friend(one of the 3 that i havent met yet) and hes so cool. i have the biggest crush on him. hes not that hot..but omg his eyes are fucking gorgeous..which is always the first thing to get me. and hes the swweeeeeetest guy ever. awww hes so cute. ok well enough about that. im gonna take an advil and sleep.

Except, i cant have this one. which sucks more then anything in the world. Oh well. GRRR its just so frustrating. and no one understands how i feel. I just melt when im around him. grr...ok. so anyways today i went to the barn expecting friday to 1.not have a shoe 2.be lame..and to my surprise..he wasnt either!! so i rode. he was a good boy. So tomarrow i leave for 9 days to North Carolina. i guess itll be fun. Its just this is the longest time ive been away since ive had friday. And i dunno....i just...i miss being home when im away...specially when i dont have a friend going with. O well. So last night i was up late just crying. im not quite sure why i was. i guess it was just everything. ive been saving it in for a while and i just let myself cry, for hours. I keep wanting someone to come comfort me and rescue me..but no one does. Sigh...i miss having a best friend. i miss having somone i can call at 2 in the morning. i miss someone inviteing me to everything, i miss knowing everything about someone(including their shampoo) and i dunno. lol. everyone has a best friend except me. everyone. and now its too late to get one, cuz everyone already has one. its just so weird. i go to the barn,everyone has someone. katie has vix,kim has david,lindsey has nikki,emily has casey,lori has jen,everoyne has someone. i guess im just lonely. and ugh...this summer is going by WAY to fast, i wish i could stop time. its just not fair. grr. i dunno. im in a good mood i guess, just....kinda pissed. kinda mad at the world today. lol. i just sound so ungreatufl, i mean there are TONS of people that have life a lot harder then mine yet im constantly complaining. well. i shuld work on that. ill add it to the list of things i should improve. ok well. im done updating.

"event","the wind blowing in my face, 
the nice big truck rollin on the road
the almost full moon,
the small town,
the laughs,
the good country music,
my favorite song,
the smell of fresh country air,
that sweet ice cream place,
but best of all....

you were there.
and then it ended..
door shut,
said goodbye
i cried."

"event","ugh. i dont know. im so confused right now about everything. about i feel for someone, about my life, about my goals, about my friends...i dont even know who i am anymore. This is so difficult, and i dont have a best friend to cry to anymore. i dont have anyone. im just stuck.im alone. and my worst fear is being alone...yet here i am. this is the first year of my life where i dont have a shoulder to cry on. i dont have a best friend to call at 1 in the morning and cry all night to. i dont have someone who knows im not ok,even when i say i am. i want that back. i want my past back..and i have soo many regrets. and they eat me alive. and im trying so hard to work on this complaining thing. i really am. its just so difficult when u hate everything about urself. and i try to help other people feel better, but i realize ive been so selfish lately. so self indulged..and thats not the person i ever thought i would be. theres so many things i need to change. but i feel like im in a huge hole.a huge hole i keep digging deeper and deeper and its gonna cave in any minute. like i dont even know....i cant even find a single thing i like about myself anymore. i just want someone to care about me. and people say they do, but eventually i turn them against me..im like..poison. i poison people. omg...i just. i dont know.im so stupid...i dont know where to go from hear. i hate my fucking school, i hate me. i just i dunno. i wish i could just start over...like change my personlity completely. ah well i g2g...im going to the barn..maybe ill come back in a better mood. hopefully. god this whole depression thing sucks."

Your Gone

my eyes are filled with tears.
my mind,scrambling with fears.
my heart is broken and will never heal,
i am hurt and scarred, yet unable to feel.

your gone.

i'm dying inside.
my heart is still beating, but my soul has died.
i long for you, even though i know your not there,
i cry for you, though i know you dont care.

your gone.

my tear drops fall down like rain,
this loneliness has caused me so much pain.
my heart is broken,my emotions dead.
this overcaset of darkness won't seem to leave my head.

your gone.

when it rains, that is my heart bleeding for you,
my heart is broken and theres nothing i can do.
i wish you were here, to hold me tight,
and save me from this desolate fright.

your gone.

you made me who i am, you made me somebody i wanna be,
but without you, i cant stand being me
when you walked out that door, you turned my world upside down.
you turned my smile in to a deathly frown.

without you, im gone."

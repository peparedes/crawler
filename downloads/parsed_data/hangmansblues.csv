"event","i just erased a page and a half of thoughts i just wrote because i dont understand them myself. its 5am & another late night from lauderdale.  maybe i'll elaborate more later, try to get my mind off of things.  i've found myself amongst people i honestly enjoy & respect & i feel the same in return.  i also read about our ""click"" in the papers & it freaks me out.  almost makes me laugh reading it.  besides that i'm glad to find myself around drug free people even though at the same time i'm surrounded by people drugged out of their minds.  lauderdale never changes it seems.  ten years ago or today i find myself looking around thinking how the fuck do these people not learn.  i have never done coke & i will never do coke, not only from my personal beliefs, but from the things i have seen & learned first hand.  aside from all this why cant i meet a girl since ""that one girl"" who i can actually see myself dating?  i usually dont pine over this kind of thing but with everything thats going through my head that i cant, and shouldnt, put in print.. i find myself wondering how every girl who flirted with me (or even gave numbers) was either married or had a boyfriend.  i try so hard not to become what i used to hate so much.  i've always been mr. nice guy.  i've even tried my hand at being a fuckin' prick & succeeded (why are girls dumb & into this?).  but when its said & done & i have it done to me & i realize i've hurt someone it kills me that i gave in & did it to others.  i'm desperately trying to find middle ground.  i'm walking a lonely path right now with so many things falling apart around me yet i've never felt so apart of something in a long time.  dammit, so many things, so many thoughts, its 530am & my early night has gone to shit.  time for bed.  need to recoop.  try to think this night & weekend through & what it all really means.  i'm so happy yet so depressed."

"event","it's one horrible feeling waking up four minutes before you're supposed to be at work.  i thought it was funny when dane cook made a joke of it but i ended up proving this theory unfortunately today.  top it off by crashing at a friend's house & being in the same clothes from the night before.  i'd kill for a toothbrush.  

i won't complain though since it was a good night.  with my roommate mike pretty much missing in action except for one or two nights a week my compulsion to get out has grown. so i hit lauderdale with katrina meeting up with all the lauderdale crew at mcguires pub for a party & ac cobra rockin' the back room.  the night polished off at poorhouse (of course) bullshitting in the back with tommy (who's trying to assasinate my liver, that's my theory) & brian.  good times.  

i'm starting to love this new click of people i've fallen into.  i just feel.. comfortable.. some i've known for a short period of time & some i've known for years.  it's just a good thing for me that's well needed right now to feel like i belong somewhere.  i'm sure that sounds strange, especially coming from mr. loner, or something more then it is but i guess it's just something well needed in my life right now.  i'm tired of being alone."

"event","one of my favorite groups is the reverend horton heat & tonight the culture room offered me, once again, the chance to open for him on sept 9th.  how very tempting.  i'm always irritational & go for the gusto but i have to lay this one in the hands of the others to let them decide if we'll actually be ready or not.  dammit i want to play.  i always had to play with bands i didn't like such as ""dope"" & other whatever acts that never become anything & now i have the chance to open for someone i not only respect but someone i listen to allllll the time... hell, even my mom thinks rev. heat rocks ass!"

"event","good lord what a night. i should be updating & refreshing regarding all the nights that have passed this week but i just dont have it in me so i'll just recap on tonight.  shitty day swamped by rain trying to get out as many pallets of people's shipments possible just in case of rain followed by trying to de-stress myself by cleaning the apartment as much as possible.. some reason this helps.. followed by.. 

snapping & going to see CLUTCH at culture room in lauderdale.  little did i know the opening band cancelled so they did three sets!! two clutch sets & one opener set of instrumental stuff.  got there part way into the second set & the night was awesome.  they played so many good songs.  not as good as last time though but more.  as always.. free beer despite paying to get in - but worth it!

ran into my buddy who recently made boynton beach SWAT team & two other SWAT members he was there with including the team leader.  very good times mixed with the music.  nothing like the SWAT team looking at you & confessing to being fuuuuucked up, haha.  upon leaving somehow they all adopted me into going into a ride along... not just a police ride along but a SWAT ride along.  thats some hot shit.  we're talking signing insurance papers & wearing SWAT jackets so i'm still ""somewhat"" bulletproof, haha.  

from there to a mile down the road to ""crush"" night at kalahari bar for a couple weeks straight & i just can't get enough of that place.  such a sweet place to feel at home & i always meet some very nice hottie gals.  got too talk to one girl i shouldn't be talking to a couple times tonight & another girl who's just smoking hot who i exchange jokes with everytime but always gets nicer & nicer.  unfortunately i will not be driving to miami to hear her dj tomorrow night.  

after this week, especailly tonight, i think pete needs his rest... gonna try to do SWAT team ride along next week!!!"

"event","i just spent half an hour updating day by day what ive been doing & how ive been feeling since the last entry.. i hit one stupid button & *zap!* all gone.. FUCKER!!!  

blah.. so i'll stick with tonight update.. started off suddenly getting the surprise of loading a semi truck with a freight pallet shipment for two hours.. visited mike's ex wife katrina to help her plan her big move, drink coffee, smoke cigarettes, & bullshit.. watch 'rescue me' - amazing & hilarious show.. hauled ass up to the lounge to see the mission veo.  only saw one song but they sounded great.  hung out for a bit with the boys & talked the update talk.  

damn i have so much goin on right now & i've been so many places this last week.  i can't sleep.  i might be wearing myself thin but i'm loving it.  i need it.  

i also can't stop writing music in my head & then trying to find something around to try out on asap.  

**i got that new band smell baby!!!**"

"event","there's something really shitty about looking at someone & suddenly realize you have completely wasted your time.  just spinning your wheels.  even worse when your friends have been telling you already."

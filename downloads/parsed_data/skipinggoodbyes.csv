"event","but when i look in the mirror, i see a girl who's been
through so much, and yet, still finds a way to smile at
the past. she still loves with all her heart, or what's
left of it. and when you see her walking in the hallway
i can guarentee you she'll have her head up high
faking a smile just one last time. and for all those
people who try to break her, trust me, you never will

No matter how careful you are,
there's always going to be the sense that you missed something,
the collapsed feeling under you skin that you didn't experience it all.
There's that fallen heart feeling that you rushed through the moments
where you should've been paying attention.
Well, get used to that feeling.
That's how your whole life will feel someday.

You're old enough to know it's not your fault. You're strong enough to face your darkest conflict. Now you've woken from your nightmare, and now you're fighting back. And nothing can survive when you attack. This road to healing hurts more than anything.

I cry myself to sleep most nights. Some nights I drown myself in my music, listening to the words spoken to help me get through each day. I am so fragile, but of course I put a brave smile on everyday, not letting anyone know what I do. I'm so good at it, you know, pretending. I have my whole family believing me. When things get good, they crash down and puts me down even more. One day maybe I will get better, but it's not like a puzzle, you can't just put it back together and create a pretty picture; you have to work at it.

I got a lecture about behavior & how if we wanted boys to be gentlemen
We should act like ladies, which was idiotic because we didn't want
The boys to be gentlemen. We wanted them to think we were pretty
& Ask us to dance and hold our hands & maybe kiss us in the corner
And send us clever instant messages.

i hope you always find a reason to smile.

there will come a day
when you'll feel like shit
& you'll want to give up
on this life and everything
else. when that day arrives
save yourself some trouble-
and don't do a thing, just
take a nap.

What I want is to be needed. What I need is to be indispensable to somebody. Who I need is somebody that will eat up all my free time, my ego, my attention. Somebody addicted to me.
A mutual addiction.

I was trying not to get too attached so
I wouldn't fall too hard, too fast. but I 
realized that I fell a long time ago, &&
now I'm loving you with all that I have.

And that's the thing about life, it's fleeting. Nothing lasts.Love? Yeah, if you're lucky you find that in your family and a few good friends, but anything beyond that is a risk and as much as you'd like to think it has the potential for forever, it doesn't. People die, they grow up, they grow apart or they just simply walk away. There is no such thing as forever.

Someday someone's gonna come along and put the pieces of my heart back together. I'm just worried about the one little piece that they're not going to be able to find, the one that makes the puzzle complete, the one that you took the day you walked away."" -unknown

The reason God put spaces between your fingers was so that someone else can fill them up

When you're right, no one remembers, when you're wrong, no one forgets
I will:
- pack you lunch
- make the bed
- always kiss you when you're mad
You will:
- catch spiders
- get the mail
- hug me all the time

He called me and said that he is sick of me talking about him behind his back(I have no idea what he is talking about.) Some chick got drunk off her ass. Everyone was freaking out and cosidering calling the cops. Someone did and hung up. When they called back, Valerie told them that it was just someone messing around. So obviously they came over to check it out. Val told them it was just someone messing around. They left. However her father proceded to press her. Val ended up telling him that I was the one that called them because i was upset about Keri and that certin someone. The thing is that me and keri had just disussed that situation and were almost ok with it. Like i said i am drunk, got bitched at, and worse of all i was completely discarded from valeries list of friends and was betrayed altogeather. I may be emo and i may be crazy. But that is not right! and then when i went to check on the dying chik i got yelled at by some dumb hoe that she didn't know me and to go away."

"event","So it's christmas, i have no money, and there is even more drama.

So we have been fighting since the play and life was actually ok. I wasn't emo and depressed. He had hurt me and it was over...Or so i thought.

The past week or so he had been having trouble with his G/f. So he was of coarse talking to me about it and we just kinda started talking again, then hanging...etc.

And of coarse we are us so we flirt like no other but of coarse it doesn't mean n e thing o him. So we were talking and he admitted that he had feelings for me before and was just afraid of what his mom would think..etc. But he said that he doesn't anymore...which i find to be total bull shit! Which is why we are fighting again..... already.

We were txting while i was on the bus to and from swim practice and i told him that i didn't believe that he didn't still have feelings for me and he freaked. And now him and a female friend of mine are flirting and txting eachother even though he still has a g/f and i am all like wtf! and it is just gay. ha ha totally and completely.

I really wonder when he is going to have hurt me for the last time, I am getting bored with it truely. My heart kinda just cant take anymore. Idk i am angry, hurt, and ok with it all at the same time. I just don't know."

"event","Have you ever just wanted to scream at the top of your lungs and break down and cry? Like in RENT when Collins is mourning Angel. It would be easier if the reason i wanted to scream was because i was mourning him but it's not. He is going out with her, and he told me today in class. ""Oh, didn't i tell you?"" Was the only thing he said but he knew i was upset about it. He knows me."

"event","So it's been like half a year now since i updated.

He kissed me again. Well we kissed again. It was spin the bottle and it didn't mean n e thing but if it didn't mean n e thing to him and if he dosen't have feelings why would he agree to do it?

That was a while ago at a friends party. 
I tried to get him to do it again b4 a certin event that he was going to with his new ""interest"" and i thought that he was going to but it never happened. I said that it was probably his last night as a single person and we should do it b4 he wasn't n e more...he said he would think about it, i guess he did.

I love him, even if he drives me crazy, i love him and i have told him that.

he pretty much refuses to touch me n e more, and flinches or pulls away every time i touch him.
I just wish that it could work. that it could all be great but that is not the way it goes.

Love,
Damon"

"event","Oh so here's the situation there is a kid that i like that i have been after for a few weeks now. The night i told him that i liked him he was actually ok with it, i mean i wasn't sure if he felt that way at all, and he had just got a new girlfriend, But yeah he was ok with it and we ended up staying up all night talking about if we would make out, if we didn't......etc Well we ended up not cause i didn't want to do it unless he was sure he wanted to.

So a few days later we spent the night with eachother again but this time when we talked all night but ended up like yelling at eachother! It was horrible, somehow we got into like morals and personal values.... and then i just gave up talking and tried to go kiss him well.....lets just say that didn't work, i kissed him and he said that he just can't....... 

So yeah this kid is like around me everyday because we were in a show at my school togeather and of coarse his new g/f was on the tech crew for the show so i would walk around and see him making out with her etc... So i was obviously getting pretty hurt and there was never a time i could talk to him, so i just kind of began to ignore it or at least try......

Then i left for tenessee for a few days and went to see him the instant i got back of coarse so i went to his house and we just sat there texting eachother cause we were watching a movie with his sister and mom. I told him that we could make it unofficial and keep it a secret. So then eventually we went up stairs and kissed......It was amazing i swear to freaking god i was sooo happy.....but then i went home and we were still texting eachother and i asked him what excatley it meant to him and he said that it was a one time thing and it was like playing spin the bottle or something.

*Crack* Oh yeah sorry that was the sound of my heart breaking.

So then last night i stay at his house and we were talking and i asked him if he even liked it when we kissed, and he said it was weird.

And people don't get me wrong, i know this is tearing this kid inside out because i mean he's feeling things he never has before and i understand that it freaks him out.

So then he told me that he was sorry for leading me on and he felt like an ass 
and that he just wanted the kiss to make us kind of even and that mabye just one would make me forget or something. And obviously that's not true!!! 

And then he brought out the big guns and said that being bi/gay is against what he was brought up to believe and that he wasn't sure.

So then because i want him to change his mind i was like well if you felt these things toward me then you obvioulsy feel something, but i mean if that's your decision then i can't change your mind, i mean i know i am gonna keep trying but.....

Then i decided to tell him that i didn't know why i liked him so much, and that i can't help what i feel.

So....... yeah the whole point is just, I think part of it was to get it out and also to see if anyone has any input on my situation, i just feel so horrible everytime i see him and i get in this like super depressed state and i really don't like it...

Idk, please help"

Well last night my mommy found a kitten and brought her home for me, i was so excited she's real cute, she's really effectionate too, it made me so happy...

So today i woke up at 7:00am from being in some god forsaken uncomfortable position but unfortunately tuck (my kitten) was lying between my legs so i picked her up and moved her with the prospect of her just going back to sleep, but of coarse not, now she was wide awake and nudging my head with her face and so on and so forth......so i gave up and got up and took her outside to see if she'd go to the bathroom(didn't have a litterbox yet) but of coarse she didn't and secretly wnt on my mom's b/fs sons bed, i cleaned it to the best of my abilities however it will prob still smell.....so the rest of the day was filled with me packing some more until 11:30ish when we left for PETsMART to pick up food, litter box etc.....
after that we went to my aunts who gave me a haircut... after that me and my mom were on the road to here(my dad's) i had my ever so normal psycological breakdown, however still less extreme as it has been in the past ( you see i hate my dad and my step mom, but i would miss lewisburg too much, i mean i've lived here insince i was born and have never gone to any other school...however a perm. move to maryland is a possibility for next years agenda, i'm using the nice PA school system and getting drives ed for free, instead of having to pay like $300 that i don't have to have the same coarse(in Md drivers ed isn't a in school class).... ok well after i came and threw my sit in my room and had my wonderful mommy help me move my stuff around, we went to her ex-boyfriends to get some of her stuff, after that we came back here and said our goodbyes :-( and at nine o'clock amanda me and her bf were supposed to go to the vault, but something happened and noone even called me, so my night has been pretty much taken up with working on the currnt state of my room(ewwww) so that's all for now i have to go job hunting and hopefully see alison tomorrow, love you all, bye"

It has been a very long time insince i have updated..almost a month...Alot of things have happened and i am going to try to start from the beginning.....First i believe was the day in American Cultures that me and Jessica turn to eachother at the same exact time and go: ""GRRRRRR"" doing the secret hand move that annoys me extremely...hahaha.

Then there is me going to Gettysburg to recieve an award for losing 20 pounds since last july in TOPS(If you are fat, I would suggest joining- it's fun..and it works;)

Oh yes and lets not forget prom *BOOM*..I will explain he boom in a second...The prom was great,I arrived at Jackies house around 4:30pm on april,1st.From here the story is just made up of jackie screaming that dougie isn't allowed to see her and pictures(LOTS OF PICTURES!!!) So from Jackies house we(Laura""my date"", Jackie, Dougie, and i set out for dinner at The Fence, But it was packed so we just ended up down the road at ""DJ's"" i would really recomend this place if you have no money!!! So after that we drove down to the gazeboo in town to take, what do you know (MORE PICTURES!!) from there we finally went to the silver moon banquet hall where it was being held. Before we walk in this one lady makes us stand for (ANOTHER FUCKING PICTURE).HAHAHA...So were finally inside...From here the activities consist of many things: Dancing(alot), Breaking couches, Eating, and shrimp battles...Now here comes the ""*BOOM*"" aroun like 20 minutes before prom ends Kayla decides to get really pissed off(Kayla really likes Dougie, Jackies b/f) so from here Sara gets pissed then i get pissed then everyone gets pissed....so then on the way home i get a lovely text message from sara saying 

Quote:""Tell Jackie to have fun making her drams come true fucking Dougie in the cabin, And tell dougie i hope he feels like hell"":Quote

So this really upset Jackie and everyone so...yeah, the rest of the night was filled with Jackie and dougie bawling, me and laura singing, FIRE, and Prince of Persia.....Ok well it was fun in the end.

I guess that's all i really have to write for now, i'll try and update more now.

And sara if you or Kayla read this i don't give a shit.

I was woken at 9:30 by my older sister Courtney,who was visiting from pitt. We got on my computer and checked out some funny stuff....After that we decided to go to dunkin donughts but unfortunatley we never got there...Reasons: (Court didn't have cash had to go to walmart to develop film, then get cash back), So then we went to trav's house to get this camera.....but of coarse i thought we were going through the drive through so i just went in bare feet,so we came back to the house and got me some shoes.....

So after we get to walmart court buys a shirt to hide the cat scratch on her chest considering the shirt she has on does not cover it...We also find out that the camera wasn't used up all the way...So we paid for the shirt and headed for dunkin donughts, but we drove right past it.

So then we went to my grandpa's to check if we were still going to lunch...but he had gone fishing...Considering it was like 11 now we decided to skip DD and just go for lunch...so of coarse now pop pop wasn't there we had to go find aunt allie but she wasn't home she was still at church.So we drive out to the church to see if aunt allie is there(she was) So then we decide that were gonna go to dinner just the three of us so we go to aunt allies and me and court stay downstairs to wait for her to get changed, While were waiting i decide to roll dow the window in her car so it's not so warm...so i roll it down all the way and as it shuts the window shatters into tons of pieces. It was interesting....my mom suggested that it may have been of it's track or something.

So then we went to lunch came home i mowed the lawn and watched some tv and now i'm her eating dinner...Dad got home a few minutes ago and already he's being a mother fucking ass hole..Alot of it is about the window too.....Ok well bye"

friday, My step mom woke me up at about 11 and said that 
insince I was goin to the all-nighter at the skating rink i 
might as well got to the mall while she works and then just 
go from there. So i said ok i got up and took a shower; threw 
shit in a bag for the all nighter. So we got to the mall and 
i walked around for like 2hrs before i went over to the movie 
theater and watched 50 first dates, which by the way is a 
very good movie. After that i was just walking around when 
who do i see but AMANDA!!!! We then decided to go on a 
mission and the mission was to go in every stor in the mall 
so half way through our mission we stopped at gordons and 
went to arbys to get lunch so while we were in arbys damian 
showed up. Well now our mission pretty much ended there =( So 
after that we went around with damian and went in clairs for 
like an hour and a half, but we stole some stuff so it was worth it(p.s. there r no camera's in that store, the bubble thing in the celing is a fake...he he he) so then amanda and damian went to pick up my love sara so i walked around a lil while i wated for them, when they got back we walked around for a while going in random places and just having fun......I have to go now for dinner and some hw i'll finish updating later ;)"

            I'm sick of the way they stare,
         Criticize my clothes, my shoes, my hair.
         The ""perfect"" people have problems too
       theirs' just don't show as easily as mine do.
           I'm sick of this shit everyday;
              Suicide is the only way.

"event","This is jst great i think i lost my cell phone..This morning i know i took it off the charger but i don't know what i did with it after that, so then i went all the way back to school seeing if it may have fell off my pants on my way to school or something. And i called it like one thousand times, but the weird thing is that it's on, but i never turn on my cell in the morning, only after school, i know it's on cause when it's off if i call it it goes right to the answering machine but it's not it's ringing so idk, i hope it shows up soon...i'm suddenly really tired....goin now bye"

"event","Today I wrote a poem, i don't like it...the original idea was great and it was gonna be a fucking awsome poem but then it slipped away cause i couldn't get paper out quick enough...AAANNNNNDDDD i just realized i don't have the notebook that i did it in with me so i guess i'll write it down tomorrow....So things are getting better and worse round the life of well ME, My grandma who a month ago was diagnosed with brain and lung cancer is now back in the hospital, for like the third time since she was diagnosed, And my grandmother is the most wonderful person in my life and i couldn't stand losing her....She has given me and my family such support, if i lost her i don't know what i'd do, i would just die...But on the bright side i think i may be on the verge of a girlfriend, a girl named Emily Lynch she's a friend of one of my friends she's in eighth grade and she's a cutie...i think i'm doin something with her this sat, we'll c.
So i'm definantly feeling a lil better than i did last night. Oh yeah and supposedly my father is having an affair with a women that is calling my stepmom at work telling her about it...it's all very interesting. Ok well that's it i guess i'll have my poem tomorrow... ~byes~
Oh yeah i also made cookies today for spanish tomorrow it took me 5 hours to fucking do...Bye"

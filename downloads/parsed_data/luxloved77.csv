That is what beauty looks like.<br>
<br>
I can't describe last night because nothing I say will do it any justice.<br>
<br>
The 8 of us lined up in the front, singing every single word, dancing
to every single song, screaming at the top of our lungs... I've never
felt anything like it. Bailey, Virginia, Ashley and I were seriously
the ONLY people there who could literally sing every single word, new
CD and old, and that felt so cool, because they totally saw and they
knew that we were genuine and not some stupid art fuck hipsters like
basically everyone else there.&nbsp; How goddamn lame can you get. Why
do you stand in the front row if you're not going to dance and you're
going to judge everyone who does?<br>
<br>
I can't describe how I felt during Calculation Theme.&nbsp; Or Dead
Disco.&nbsp; Emily has this power and it's indescribable.&nbsp; She was
saying things during Dead Disco and I just wanted to start sobbing
because it was things that I've been feeling so much lately and I loved
knowing that this person that I basically idolize completely agrees
with me and knows how I'm feeling. And it was so comfortable being
surrounded by the people that I knew also agreed and felt the same way.
My support system.<br>
<br>
Last night may have been one of the best nights of my life.<br>"

"event","Hey look at me, I got a new layout.  It's not that different but I've been obsessing over this David Lachapelle picture for like, 3 years so I decided to make good use out of it.

I think I'm going to make my journal half friends only, half not.  So we'll see how that works out.

Mkay bye."

"event","So I finally snagged an invitation code for AO3 and have now started moving some of <a href=""http://archiveofourown.org/users/redtoes/works"" target=""_blank"">my old fic</a> across, and have posted 3 chapters of my <a href=""http://archiveofourown.org/works/760819/chapters/1423592"" target=""_blank"">current Veronica Mars WIP</a>.

This weekend I finished revising chapters 14-19 of the novel (11 to go), but kept getting distracted by my LoVe fix-it fic. Hence why there&#39;s now 3 chapters on public display.

Ever since I donated to the <a href=""http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/559914737/the-veronica-mars-movie-project"" target=""_blank"">Kickstarter</a> I&#39;ve been consuming VM fic like crack. Anyone out there have any good long plotty recs to throw my way?"

"event","So a slightly weird thing happened to me yesterday. As part of NaNoWriMo I found a local write-in that was happening up at Alexandra Palace which is a comfortably 30 minutes walking distance from my house.<br /><br />Locally known as Ally Pally it&#39;s a huge glass and stone complex on a hill where the BBC used to signal boost from, and maybe even still do - I&#39;m not sure. I saw the Afghan Whigs play there earlier this year so I know the way from my house.<br /><br /><img alt="""" border=""0"" src=""http://www.victorianweb.org/art/architecture/johnson/2.jpg"" title="""" /><br /><br />Anyway I walk up there, and it&#39;s bright but there&#39;s plenty of dark clouds threatening rain. A nip in the air but a nice day for a walk all the same even if parts of that hill are fricking steep.<br /><br />Because there&#39;s supposed to be a write-in happening there. Meet at 12.30 at the ice rink, said the forum, and we&#39;ll be in the cafe-bar. So I was at the ice rink for 12.30, in fact I was there for 12.20 and I went on through to the Ice-cafe (as it was called) and there&#39;s a kid&#39;s birthday party happening and no laptops.<br /><br />Huh.<br /><br />So I ask around and it turns out there&#39;s a bar at the other end of the complex. So I trundle along (it&#39;s BIG complex) and go into the Bar-Kitchen and again, no laptops.<br /><br />I check with the bar staff and they say there&#39;s another cafe out past one of the car parks, and I walk down the hill to check it out but it turns out to be really quite a distance and anyway it&#39;s called the Grove Cafe, so it&#39;s definitely not the cafe-bar. I talk to a security guard and she tells me of a fourth cafe (4 cafes!) over by the boating lake. I have to pass the bar-kitchen and the ice-cafe to get back there so I check on the way and still no laptops. I make it to the cafe by the lake and it&#39;s literally empty - not only are there no laptops, there&#39;s no people.<br /><br />I&#39;m a bit lost at this point, so I post on the Nano forum and also on Twitter, but get no response. I check with the husband, agreeing to meet him in the coffee shop underneath his gym, and wander down to it. But when I say wander what I really mean is 45 minute walk through crowded shopping streets because Ally Pally to Manor House - 3 tubes stops and no small distance.<br /><br />At this point I&#39;m a little bitter - have just 2 hours wandering around an English Heritage monument and NOT WRITING but I suppose my laptop in its nice laptop case did get a day out.&nbsp;<br /><br />So I finally make it to the Costa (a big UK chain) and despite the nip in the air I have a lemonade because I&#39;m just too damn hot from all the walking and I notice, over in the corner, at the table which is the perfect height for working on a laptop a girl working on a laptop with a NaNoWriMo sticker on it.<br /><br />I go across, introduce myself and it turns out she&#39;s one of the MLs for London. We have a nice chat and she clues me in to several local writing things - a bookshop turning publisher and a local writers group - and I finally get to add to my word count.<br /><br />Only 600 words but then I&#39;m only there an hour before the husband comes down from gym and then we go on with our day. So in the end despite not finding a the write-in I was looking for, I did in fact, find a write-in where none existed.<br />"

"event","Having a lazy weekend, with the exception of yesterday afternoon where the husband and I went into town for 30th birthday drinks (likely my last 30th birthday party in this friend group - wow now we&#39;re all *old*) at Wahaca on Charlotte Street where we ate Mexican street food and I was introduced to Mezcal (or possibly Mexcal?) a kind of proto-tequila you drink with a spicy tomato chaser.

The birthday girl did this really cool thing where she made party bags for the entire group which included chocolate, homemade badges, seeds, fossilized shark teeth (!) and temporary tattoos. So we all ended up getting truly trampily tatted with tats on necks, arses and in my case boobs. I got a real kick out of it, but when I woke up this morning I was worried because tomorrow night I&#39;m shooting video at a pretty high class awards evening and all my party dresses would reveal said fake tattoo. So I had to scrub it off with nail polish remover this morning. Shame.

I&#39;ve recently been getting very into Veronica Mars - bought all 3 season boxsets, but from a dodgy Amazon UK seller which meant that the box art and episode descriptions are in German, even if the DVDs are in English. But a third of the price of the English language box art so I&#39;m not too bothered. I&#39;m halfway through the 3rd season currently and am kind of dreading the end. I know the season doesn&#39;t end with Veronica and Logan together - I&#39;ve read too much fix-it fix to know that, and I know there&#39;s 3 storylines in the season and I&#39;ve just seen 2 of them, so there are so few episodes left...I like it too much to want to get to the end, but I really want to see the episodes.

Catch 22.

Today I&#39;m also spell-checking my way through the second half of the book ready to submit for the Harper Voyager no-agent-submission - though I&#39;m a little concerned any monies are royalties only, no advance payment. But still better some but none."

"event","<p>Three nights in a row I've had elaborate movie style bad dreams. Three nights in a row my husband has been in LA and I never sleep well when he's not around. </p><p>Night 1: the Tsunami<br>This started out as a kinda buddy movie thing with a hero and heroine (who was sort of me but then very not) having to work together to get to a beach before a tsunami hit. now if that doesn't make sense to you, don't worry because it didn't make a great deal of sense to me either. My oh so logical brain tried its best to come up with solutions for how being on the beach would save them from the giant wave but they (or at least she) kept drowning, so my brain rewound time and made it so they had to climb a mountain instead. Much more logical. I assume there had to be an element of lucid dreaming with this one because I can remember thinking ""no that would kill them they need to get up high"" before the dream changed.</p><p>Night 2: zombie rage/possessed people<br>There were work drinks earlier that evening so I think this started with my brain replaying the events of the day. Then the people in the office stopped and their eyes turned black (ala X-files & Supernatural but behaviour was more Croatoan virus than demonic possession) and started attacking each other.  And then the dream was all trying to get away/trying to get home in a London filled with rage zombies with black eyes and horrible grins. And I never got very far. So my brain kept rewinding and replaying and I was caught or trapped in a variety of different ways, none of which ended well.</p><p>Night 3: foreign prison & torture<br>Husband and I are overseas somewhere like China with rigid state laws and a language I have no knowledge of. We're trying to get into a concert and are advised to go around the back and say we're with catering. We do this and run into some friendly cops who have me remove my bag/coat and put all my belongings into Husband's bag. Then they have him touch some money. Then we are separated and a friendly police officer informs me Husband is to be arrested for money laundering or carrying more cash than is legal and I'm being done as a nonperson because I'm not carrying my papers anymore, husband is. I try to call out to husband but he's too far away to hear me and I know I'm not going to see him again for a very long time and I panic.  I'm allowed a phone call and manage to tell family what has happened but they're on the otherside of the world and so we're arrested and imprisoned. Then timeline gets screwy as are conditions in prison, some torture, some solitary confinement and all I can do is worry that neither husband nor I are strong enough to get through it. </p><p>My brain is a fucked up place, filing me with dread over these imaginary scenarios and walking me up in the middle of the night half panicked thinking that they have come true.</p><p><span style=""font-size: x-small;""><i>Posted via <a href=""http://m.livejournal.com/iphone/link"">LiveJournal app for iPhone</a>.</i></span></p>"

"event","So today I&#39;m going to a funeral, which sucks on a number of levels.

Firstly it&#39;s a family funeral for a relative I haven&#39;t seen in ten years despite the fact we live in the same city, so there&#39;s guilt.

Then it&#39;s the fact that she, who was a moderately large part of my childhood, seems to have spent a lot of the past few years alone and may have actually died alone, following years/months of demetia, suspected TB and Pneumonia, so there&#39;s fear of ending up like that.

And finally, it&#39;s the fact it&#39;s a funeral - in the past 12 months the number of funerals I&#39;ve been to is now higher than the number of weddings. &nbsp;In fact I&#39;ve only been to 1 wedding this year and that&#39;s practically unheard of for me. I suppose Christenings (or more likely given my crowd, non-religious naming ceremonies) will kick in at some point soon given how many people we knnow are pregnant or hangin&#39; with newborns, but still. Have I really entered that stage of life where funerals are more numerous as weddings?

I know this whole post is probably making me seem very cold. And I do feel loss - it&#39;s just been such a long time since I saw my Great Aunt - ironically enough, at another funeral, that of my grandmother - that I&#39;m really having trouble dealing with the day."

My husband has just left for the airport. There&#39;s a birthday BBQ for a friend happening but it&#39;s not til 4. I have ideas I want to work on, but I don&#39;t like the idea of spending all day on the laptop on the kitchen table, but I&#39;m down to my last &pound;20 for the month and going out to a coffee shop to work will eat into that.

Especially as wifi is free at home.

So what to do, what to do. &nbsp;I finished a latest draft of my novel yesterday morning. It&#39;s something beyond a second draft - the first draft was written in NaNoWriMo last year - but it doesn&#39;t quite feel like a third draft. &nbsp;Even though I suppose it is. &nbsp;The second draft&#39;s changes were primarily in the middle and the beginning of the manuscript, the third draft&#39;s changes were all about the end. &nbsp;

Maybe I should call this draft 2.5. &nbsp;Drafts 2 and 3 combined show changes to the entire story.

Draft 2.5 it is. &nbsp;Anyway, the husband has been bundled off to the airport with it downloaded onto my kindle to provide feedback on his return. &nbsp;And also to see if he would like a kindle of his own. &nbsp;I&#39;ll have to make do with the app on my phone for now.

I have some ideas for a sequel. &nbsp;Nothing concrete but a few things I could work on. But should I work on them here or elsewhere?

Or should I get out my semi-new sewing machine and make that damn pillow I&#39;ve been planning to make for weeks? I could make on the perfect size to be a lift for my laptop, ease this crick in my neck.&nbsp;

Or do I go to the cinema?

It&#39;s a strange thing about being married. You forget what it is to do things on your own. When faced with a day without your partner, the time stretches ahead, begging to be filled, and all you can do is prevaricate.&nbsp;

Still I can&#39;t make up my mind. I hope something occurs to me soon or I&#39;ll lose all this time to DVDs or reading my way through AO3. And I really would like to do something meaningful with this day I have to myself."

But I still think the damn thing is too short.

It&#39;s an urban fantasy, the genre made popular by Jim Butcher, Charlaine Harris, Kelley Armstrong etc, and I really have no idea how long one of those should be.&nbsp; Does anyone have any guidance?&nbsp; Would 75,000 words be about right?&nbsp; Currently it&#39;s about 51,000, so obviously I need to grow it a bit, but how much?

"event","Originally posted by <lj user=""halcyon_shift"" /> at <a href=""http://halcyon-shift.livejournal.com/687492.html"">Say No to ACTA</a><div class=""repost"">(taken from <lj user=""agirlnamedtruth"" />, originally posted on <lj user=""vidding"" />)<br /><br />If you&#39;re from the UK and you believe in freedom of speech and an uncensored interenet, you really need to sign <a href=""https://submissions.epetitions.direct.gov.uk/petitions/20685"">this petition</a>. There are others floating about, but that particular one is the best way to ensure that your voice gets heard. It&#39;s hosted on the directgov website and addresses parliament directly. If it gets more than 100,000 signatures, it becomes eligible for discussion in the House of Commons.<br /><br />Everyone&#39;s been getting so worked up over SOPA -- and rightly so -- that ACTA seems to have slipped under the radar. This is hugely problematic, because ACTA is a similar bill, but it has the potential to be far more damaging than SOPA ever could be.<br /><br />Some people seem to have this misconception that ACTA is the &#39;European SOPA&#39;, but that simply isn&#39;t true. It&#39;s a global treaty, and it&#39;s already been signed by eight countries, including the US, Japan, New Zealand and Singapore. Europe votes on Thursday. If they vote &#39;no&#39;, the bill will have to be taken back to the drawing board and reformulated, which should buy us some time at the very least.<br /><br />If you think this doesn&#39;t affect you, you&#39;re wrong. If ACTA passes, it could well signal the end of the internet as we know it, and that isn&#39;t an exaggeration. It&#39;s not just about watching movies and television online. If ACTA passes, sites like YouTube, Livejournal, Tumblr, Twitter, Facebook and even Google and Wikipedia could become impossible to maintain. ACTA would allow ISPs to monitor your net activity and cut off internet access for your entire household if one person is suspected of breaching copyright. Think Big Brother is Watching. I don&#39;t think I need to emphasise just how damaging it can be to be without internet access in this day and age, when we rely so heavily on technology.<br /><br />It&#39;s not only bloggers and fandom that would be affected, either. Small businesses, independent film-makers and unsigned musicians who have previously found their niche online would also suffer hugely, and would be at risk of being bullied into submission by Hollywood and multinational corporations under accusations of copyright infringement. All those artists who found fame by uploading covers of songs to YouTube would never have had the opportunity to do so under ACTA, as those cover versions would be prohibited.<br /><br />I know the internet has its problems, but to my mind it&#39;s the single greatest invention to come out of modern times, and it would be an absolute travesty if we were to lose that now. From a personal point of view, I can&#39;t even put into words how important this is to me. I&#39;ve met some of my closest friends through the internet and online fandom, people whom I would likely never have met without it, and it&#39;s given me this amazing social support system. I don&#39;t want that to end here, and I want to preserve it for future generations so that they can have the same experience and opportunities I&#39;ve been given through my online interactions.<br /><br />I know that opinions on the seriousness of copyright infringement and online piracy vary wildly, but that isn&#39;t really the point. Internet giants such as Google are opposed to this bill, and it&#39;s pretty safe to say that they&#39;re not in favour of copyright infringment, as anyone who&#39;s ever had a fanvid taken down from YouTube will be painfully aware. Whatever your stance on copyright, this isn&#39;t the way to go about dealing with it. This is dangerous legislation that impeaches on some of our most basic human rights, such as the right to privacy and freedom of speech.<br /><br />So if you&#39;re from the UK, please, please sign the petition. If you hail from elsewhere in the world, there may well be similar movements in your own country, but I think the most effective thing anybody can do right now is to keep talking about this. Talk about it on Livejournal, on Twitter, on Tumblr, on Facebook, and anywhere else you can think of. Make sure this issue is never far from people&#39;s minds. The internet is an amazingly powerful tool: let&#39;s utilise it while we still have the chance.<br /><br />Please repost and spread the word :)<br /><br /><a href=""https://submissions.epetitions.direct.gov.uk/petitions/20685"">SAY NO TO ACTA!</a><br /><br /><lj-repost button=""Post this to your journal!"" /><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: smaller;"">This entry was originally posted at <a href=""http://lithiumdoll.dreamwidth.org/673963.html"">http://lithiumdoll.dreamwidth.org/673963.html</a>. <img alt=""comment count unavailable"" height=""12"" src=""http://www.dreamwidth.org/tools/commentcount?user=lithiumdoll&amp;ditemid=673963"" style=""vertical-align: middle;"" width=""30"" /> comments</span></div>"

"event","<p><lj user=""nick_jeeves""> and I watched <i>Mr Smith goes to Washington</i> this weekend and were completely and utterly delighted by it. I put it on the rental list out of a combination of a long term admiration of Jimmy Stewart and the fact the film is continually listed as a classic. Plus US politics is kinda like catnip to me. </p><p>Needless to say, we loved it, but as soon as it was done, I just had to watch its spiritual successor - ""The Stackhouse Filibuster"" episode of <i>The West Wing</i>. </p><p>But once we start watching <i>The West Wing</i> we rarely stop and so now <lj user=""nick_jeeves""> is watching the rest of season 2 from TSF onwards. These were always done of my favourite episodes of the show but in thinking about this I thought I should make a definitive list of my favourite eps to see if I can remember them all in one sitting. </p><p>And so, in no particular order:</p><p>""The Stackhouse Filibuster"" - because everything about it is lovely. The senior staff writing emails home, Donna figuring it all out, Bartlet's grandfather speech, and George Coe as Stackhouse himself, who was so memorable in this role they brought him back in season 3 as a third party candidate. </p><p>""The Supremes"" - the only part of season 5 worth watching. William Fitchner and Glenn Close verbally sparring, bonus Robert Piccardo, Donna's parents' cats. ""Don't try to keep up."" Classic. (My only niggle is that the staff seem to have all forgotten Mendoza, the judge they got on the court in Season 1 - one reference is all it would have taken guys)</p><p>""17 people"" - in his script book Sorkin describes this one as a play, but it's the kind of episode I've always liked - the quiet after hours episode when it's just the key characters and nothing happens. Stuff does happen here but it's all understated - Toby finds out about the MS, we get more insight into Josh & Donna, Ainsley provides a very irritating reading of the ERA, but it's still a very quiet ep. Perfectly understated. </p><p>""Mr Willis of Ohio"" - my favourite episode of season one, though it's a close run against ""The crackpots and these women,"" which we will get to shortly. Thinking about it now I guess it's the first TWW successor to <i>Mr Smith</i> but it's different in many ways. It's one man can make a difference but it's also how the argument very rarely matters anymore. Also the senior staff play poker. And that's just a win for me on several levels. I don't even mind Mandy for once. </p><p>""The crackpots and these women"" - the wolf, the aliens, the NSC card. Ave Maria and that first glimpse into why Josh is just so driven and socially inept. Plus despite all the heartbreaking news it's very funny, and it's the first time Charlie meets Zoe. </p><p>""In the shadow of two gunman"" - how the gang all got together.  Perfect backstories all. Plus Josh & Sam and Josh & Donna. </p><p>""Bartlet for America"" - Leo McGarry and the hearings, his lawyer being kickass, Cliff ceasing to be creepy and annoying and threatening to ""wait in the tall grass"" for the republican senator orchestrating the whole thing. John Spencer earning an Emmy and then some. </p><p>""Debate camp"" - if only for Sam's Bartlet impression. And the flashbacks to the senior staff all nervous in their new jobs. And Toby. Poor Toby. </p><p>""lockdown"" - when Donna realises she has to get out, Bartlet's new secretary reveals herself to be a crash shark and it was all a drill explanation, only to then reveal it was someone trying to kill Charlie. Wow. Bonus Reed Diamond too which is always fun. </p><p>The episode in season 7 where Josh and Donna finally kiss. I can't remember the name but I'll google it when I get to work. It's just perfect - especially their frustration in the obstacles thrown in their way. We waited 7 years and it finally happened. </p><p>I'm sure I'll remember more as soon as I post this, so I expect to be updating it several times today, but for now, that's all I've got. </p><p><span style=""font-size: x-small;""><i>Posted via <a href=""http://m.livejournal.com/iphone/link"">LiveJournal app for iPhone</a>.</i></span></p>"

This amendment would grant fertilized eggs and fetuses personhood status.<br /><br />Putting aside the contentious issue of abortion, this would effectively outlaw birth control and criminalize women who have miscarriages. This is not a good thing.<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.jacksonwomenshealth.com/"">Jackson Women&#39;s Health Organization</a> is the only place women can get abortions in the <i>entire</i> state, and they are trying to launch a grassroots movement against this amendment. This doesn&#39;t just apply to Mississippi, though, as Personhood USA, the group that introduced this amendment, is trying to introduce identical amendments in <i>all 50 states</i>.<br /><br />What&#39;s more, in Mississippi, this amendment is expected to pass. It even has Mississippi Democrats, including the Attorney General, Jim Hood, backing it.<br /><br />What to do?<br /><br />- Read up on it. <a href=""http://www.wakeupmississippi.org/"">Wake Up, Mississippi</a> is the home of the grassroots effort to fight this amendment. <a href=""http://www.dailykos.com/story/2011/10/07/1023558/-Occupy-My-Uterus-My-Ass!-Fertilized-Eggs-Are-NOT-People!"">Daily Kos</a> also has a thorough story on it.<br /><br />- If you can afford it, you can donate at the site&#39;s link.<br /><br />- You can <a href=""http://www.democrats.org/contact"">contact the Democratic National Committee</a> to see why more of our representatives aren&#39;t speaking out against this.<br /><br />- Like <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/pages/WakeUpMississippiorg/237684486281516"">this Facebook page</a> to help spread awareness.<br /><br /><br /><lj-repost button=""And you can always push this button to repost on your LJ and spread the word"" /></div></div></div>"

"event","I had what could be described as a very stylish weekend in London.&nbsp; Generally <lj user=""nick_jeeves"" /> and I tend towards hermit crabs in this city of ours, only venturing out to places we know that are near at hand, but this weekend was different.<br /><br />We started on Friday with drinks at the <a href=""http://www.individualpubs.co.uk/pembury/"" target=""_blank"">Pembury</a> in Hackney, which is if not my favourite pub in London, then definitely on the top five list.&nbsp; It&#39;s a laid back pub with a very bar-like feel and a huge array of independent beer on tap and very few branded drinks.&nbsp; It&#39;s not the cheapest palce ever but you pretty much get what you pay for and the food is pretty decent.&nbsp; We were meeting a friend there and before long two more showed up, so we had quite an evening of it, then made our way back home on the overground train.<br /><br />Saturday started early with several errands to run in the morning.&nbsp; My work colleagues back in March gave me two tickets to <a href=""http://www.vinopolis.co.uk/"">Vinopolis</a> as a 30th birthday present, and as March was six months ago, the tickets were about to expire!&nbsp; So I booked us in for tastings from 2pm, in order for us to grab some food from <a href=""http://www.boroughmarket.org.uk/"">Borough Market</a> before committing to some serious drinking.<br /><div style=""text-align: center;""> <img alt=""Borough Market"" src=""http://www.whatsjamesdoing.com/Blog/Borough-Market-Entrance.jpg"" style=""width: 400px; height: 325px;"" /></div><br />Despite past experience which has generally ended up with us both pretty sloshed within 20 minutes, the wine tasting didn&#39;t hit too hard - three premium tastings at 25ml each, and six standard tastings of the same.&nbsp; So really it&#39;s only actually about 225ml of wine in total, which less than a large glass of wine in a bar.&nbsp; Admittedly, last time we were there with DoctorSis and her other half and the tasting tickets includes Champagne, Absinthe, Beer and Rum in addition to the vino.&nbsp; But we were happy with out 9 tasting tickets (and a Bombay Sapphire cocktail) and were sober enough to choose a few bottles to come home with us (all from the &pound;7.99 or less section of the store, which bodes well for our budget).<br /><br />We wandered across London Bridge with a vague idea of making our way up to Shoreditch for a cocktail, but instead ended up in Spitalfields market, where I drank margueritas and ate tapas while <lj user=""nick_jeeves"" /> nursed one beer and knocked back two tequila shots.&nbsp; Tired, and by then, a little drunk, we made our way home via overground train and then watched <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1188729/"">Pandorum</a> on DVD and drank one of new bottles of wine.<br /><br />Sunday was another early start, but this time it was about Hyde Park and boating on the Serpentine.&nbsp; Or at least a boat on the Serpentine - a <a href=""http://www.treehugger.com/files/2006/07/serpentine_sola_1.php"">solar powered boat</a>...<br /><div style=""text-align: center;""> <img alt=""solar powered boat!"" src=""http://www.treehugger.com/solar-boat-01.jpg"" style=""width: 468px; height: 325px;"" /></div><div>There we and 36 other people celebrated a friend&#39;s 40th.&nbsp; They&#39;d rented out the entire boat, we sipped buzz fizz and ate bacon sandwiches and marvelled in how green and environmentally friendly we were on the solar boat - at least until a little petrol powered boat made three tips between the dock and us delivering, seperately, a carafe of coffee, a load of coffee cups and finally taking the empty carafe back to port.&nbsp;<br /> <!--/div--><br />We sailed for an hour and half which was lovely, then made our way back to their nearby flat where we all drank too many drinks of too many types and nibbled on an array of picnic food.<br /> <br />Home via tube and bus.<br /> <br />I should also say I spent Sunday in my new dress from Seattle which makes me look very girly and curvy and completely hides how huge my tummy is looking these days.&nbsp; I would have taken pictures but the camera was completely drained of battery, and unfortunately the shop does not yet have a website so I can&#39;t link you.<br /> <br />All in all a lovely weekend - and one of the first for a long time when we saw more of London then just a local neigbourhood.</div>"

"event","It's Friday once again (&quot;Friday Friday gotta get down on Friday&quot; - and now I'll have that in my head for the rest of the day) and I'm in work and London is having grey and miserable weather.&nbsp; 

Non -UK residents may wonder when London is not grey and miserable as popular culture suggests we have never really been blessed with sunshine.&nbsp; Admittedly we are a country who apparently pissed off whichever of the pantheon it is who looks after weather. Not as bad as some other countries one might say - extreme weather is a rarity here - but perhaps we did something nationally on about the same level of irritation as door to door salesmen or annoying advertising jingles on the TV, which results in our Summer being broken up with patches of cold miserable grey weather better suited to the opposite side of the year.

There's an old joke about Northern European Summers:

&quot;Do you remember last Summer?&quot;

&quot;Yes, it was a Tuesday wasn't it&quot; or &quot;That last weekend in May&quot; or the old favourite &quot;No - there was a summer?&quot;

And it's no less true for repetition.&nbsp; 

There has, to my recollection, been one weekend of Summer so far this year.&nbsp; It was early, as Summer's are wont to be, around that first weekend in May, and I spent it with friends - sitting out in Regent's Park on the Saturday and barbequeing on the Sunday (or it might have been the bank holiday Monday, I forget).&nbsp; But I spent it, as I do each year, thinking &quot;Wow Summer's great - hope it like this the whole time,&quot; and it never is.

Never stops me thinking it though.&nbsp; I guess I never learn."

Life can be so very strange, I was just reading through the back catalogue here and seeing NewJob, NewJob 2.0, NewJob 2.5 - all of that seems like such a very long time ago.

This time I'm moving on and moving up - proper step forward in this strung together list of employments I call a career.  I wasn't completely looking for it, but in the past few weeks when I was negotiating (Negotiating!  Hark at 'er!) for the best deal possible and consider jobs both old and new it became clear to me that I really did need to move on.

I leave behind me a final salary pension (an act I'm sure will cause any accountants out there actual physical pain) and a whole bushel of friends I hope to be able to keep in touch with.  I'm not generally brilliant at keeping in touch but we shall see - the glorious interweb does make it easier.

I've got pre-new-job apprehension at the moment (What if? What if? What if?) but on the whole I'm doing okay.  And it's enough of a pay rise I'll be able to clear my immediate loan and credit card debt pretty sharpish which is nice.   I'd be using up almost all of this year's holiday to be able to get Stateside for a wedding but I think I'm okay.  It's a whole new thing now, and as much as I wonder and worry, I think this is the right thing to do, and I hope it works out."

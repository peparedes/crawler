"event","<P>I just took a quiz that rates your life and aspects of it, but I can't figure out how to get it to paste here right, so I'll just sum it up. I was exactly the average in general for my life. I ranked below average on mind and on friends and family, which I found surprizing. 5.6 and 3.5 respectively.&nbsp; I scored above average on body (also surprizing) and spirit.&nbsp; I scored very high on my financial score 8.4 which I thought odd, since I feel so insecure in my job and said that I don't really like it. My love score was a 0. Absolute Zero. How cold. The quiz said there's hope and not to give up. Then it gave a bunch of links to dating sites.&nbsp; I generally feel pretty good about life right now, I'm convinced I'm secure in my job for the rest of this semester and that I need to organize myself greatly in order to be hired back next year. This defined gives me a sense of security I don't usually have, even if the news is not good. I figure it gives me a challenge, a goal that is clear. I simply need to organize myself. According to this internet quiz (not to stress it too much, I place little importance on such things) my mind score will go up by uncluttering my thoughts.&nbsp; I imagine, finding love would bring my love score up, so I'm just a good day away from living an above average life.&nbsp; I miss you all, my friends. I want to spend more time with you. We are in desperate need of another party sometime soon. Maybe with the holidays. Feel free to message or call me, I need it. :-)&nbsp; Later!&nbsp;- Billy</P>"

I'll be moving out to Winter Haven later this summer and I'll be a full time teacher next year. I'm sad to be leaving my friends at Emerald City and I'm nervous about being an actual teacher, but I'm also very excited and relieved that I can stop looking.  I'm not done organizing myself by any means tho. Still have to move, fill out a ton of paper work, get a physical, and plan lessons (yikes).  There are some people I'm not sure how to say bye to.

"event","Stressful, but good.  For those of you who know me, you may have picked up that this entry was written on my birthday.  Now I know me having a good time on my birthday seemed impossible, but here it is despite my curmungeonly self. 
 Teri made me vegan cupcakes! She couldn't even eat them with her gluten allergy! I love her so much. Brad said something to me which really jumped out at me, but it made me realize how special all my connections to everyone at work are. Neil bought me lunch which was great. Thru a mix up I procured an extra pizza from hungry howies which I was able to give to Zack, and since I enjoy doing that it worked out pretty well. A lady let me cut in front of her in traffic just when I really needed to, and its the little things that count.That really stood out to me as a sign of luck.   Jen and Cary gave me a vegi-cookbook which was way nice of them. Before she left, I hugged Teri which may be the first time since her birthday last July, another wonderful little thing. On the way home Drew called me. Before work David had IMed me. I got a message on facebook from Tony Magenello (sp?) which is just crazy, and also from Julie, Sergio, Leah, and Quyen.  Natalie (in Virginia) IMed me and Heather Winger and Sara Bodack and Karen did too. I really made Karen happy when I called her and interupted her date on her birthday the 1st. I think she wants me to call her tonight. not sure. I have no one to go out with tonght :-/ but that's ok cause I love everyone in my life today and I just feel so radiant! More than in a long time. Well, that day with Jenny made me feel that way a couple weeks ago at the beach. But before that it'd probably been years. Today I know Teri put me in the mood for this wonderful feeling and for that I'll love her forever as well as the rest of you too. I can't wait for my party at Drew's. See you soon!"

"event","Well, first I woke up on time unlike yesterday.  Then I took a shower in which I had time to relax and think unlike yesterday.  I got everything done at work that I wanted to unlike yesterday.  Ok so maybe yesterday was just a bad day. 
But thanks for reading.  

So tired of being boring. I think my silence has given me an air of mystery or at least people ask me stuff they should know about myself.  Teri made a comment the other day not realizing how lonely I can get. As if she didn't know. Just because I don't gripe doesn't mean I'm not feeling it; I just got tired of hearing the same stories and words comming from my mouth dooming me to failure so I stopped repeating the same old tune.  I still self-defeat in socializing, but I tend to be more quiet about it I think. Only my closest pals know.  So I thought I'd lay that out here because now I'm tired of being silent. I'm fucking lonely. The loneliest person you can imagine. And there's no solution. Just have to wait. Despite wanting to be a teacher, despite wanting to learn to cook, despite wanted to write or learn or excercise, these are all things I want to do, but they are not things I truely care about. The one (or two) thing I care about is having someone to share all these components of myself with. And my friends are great. I love all you guys. It just isn't enough for me. Never was. So yeah, if this strikes a cord with any of you just give me a shout out. I don't know exactly who reads this even, but I bet most of you are taken or guys, maybe there're two single girls out there at the most I dunno.  I just don't want a repeat of a few years ago where Janene asked me about me and girls.  At the time I was a virgin, which she didn't know, and I had never had a gf, which she didn't know.  That was absurd. I wear my heart on my sleeve, and on top of that, I'd had a crush on her for years. Had she ever taken the moment to wonder about these things, she's have had her answers. But I guess that's it, no one I'm into cares when I'm still into them.  Teri is my closest friend around here, I tell her everything about everything (with words or otherwise) and her wondering if I was lonely just shocked me.  If I don't go around bitching about myself does everyone just forget or care even less? Oh well. Renee's been calling me. I'm afraid to meet with her.  I want her to do well in life, but I cannot allow her to become a part of mine. She was more dangerous to me as well as herself than I'm willing to cope with. It kills me not to play the hero, but I'm growing tired of all of my games. I need new metaphors. New brains. Oh well. Night ya'll....    I was done there. Then IMed a friend. I like my fucking games. God damn it. I enjoy being silly, and sensensical and using double entondras (sp?) and I just wish it didn't always leave me with the damn bitter aftertaste of lonliness and isolation. But what else can nonesense build besides walls?  Here's to conversations that make us drunk with delight and fancy! Here's to the only guy in the room laughing!

"event","I saw a bulletin on a website I frequent asking if I anyone knew anything about gnosticism. I responded and was emailed asking about my religious views. I ranted for a few minutes and since it was enjoyable I figured I'd repost it here for my pals. Now read on:

RE: Gnosis
I know very little, but I may be able to help a little or at least give you more questions, which, when exploring such things, can also be a blessing. -Billy 

haha, isnt that the truth :) wel llet me ask you a few easy questions. where did you learn about it, what do you like about it, what do you dislike about it, what other relgious thoughts and ideas have you ever researched and/or subscribed to :) 


I have always been interested in religion and read about ones I would not otherwise have been exposed to, but I minored in religion at University of Florida. Learned a lil about gnosticism in my Christian Gospels course. What do I like about it? I like how arcane it feels. Lost knowledge and all of that. Of course that was always its appeal in the ancient world as well as in the New Age religio-babble we see today. Aside from the mystique I think studying gnostic text carefully can reveal more of the early church to us. What do I not like about it? It was just another failed cult it appears. Hard to give it more merit than any other. They all have their charm and their doom, don't they? As far as my religious thoughts, I was raised a not too devout reform Jew, but have never really seen God so much as a diety figure. No bearded old man in the clouds for me. In fact, I hate that guy. Too micromanaging and fierce. I never saw God much as a sandal-wearing revolutionary zealot either. Or a blue guy, or a race of aliens or any of those things. I just beleive that there seems to be something about human nature that we ought to do the best we can, and we know when we're falling short and when we're not. Do no harm or at least minimize it. That's all that can be expected I should think. What powerful force is out there should celebrate that effort. If that's not good enough, I wouldn't want to serve that force anyhow. I call it ""Good"" but it can go by God if you'd like. just don't confuse it with any incarnate thing. Rant over :-)


Other than that, I'm happy cause I'm currently reading Transmetropolitan which is wonderful.  A little disturbed because the number of people I loose contact with is increasing daily. I want everyone to do well.  I tryed contacting one a few minutes ago to see how she was doing but got no reponse. I just hope my long silence is not interpreted as any form of abandonment by her or any of my friends. Sometimes I just get a bug up my ass and need to not make phone calls. A conversation with Chad and Teri at work combined with a wonderful day with an old friend (whom I've always been interested in but who's moving away) have got me feeling a tad lonely. Still not eating meat. My workshop is fast approaching for the substitute thing.  I'm a bunch of jumbled thoughts and feelings. I guess that's the whole update. Later, guys."

I had to be at the admin building (they call it the Taj Mahal cause its funny shaped) to be finger printed and fill out tax formsand stuff. It appears I am going to be a substitute teacher. I have a 2 day workshop in may before I can start. May 17 and May 20. They're going to go over rules and stuff. As it turns out for the summer they have kids selected for drop out and adult classes that may need subs. In august I'll be able to start with the regular classes. I figured it out and even if I worked every single day, I still won't quite make enough to live on my own. Not sure what the future holds.Either way I'm excited and can't wait to get in the classroom."

It's half protest, half test of my own willpower, and half an atempt at enlightenment and about 10% a crack pot scheme to eat healthier. I know it doesn't add up, sue me.  

Thing number two, a few days ago I got a good phone call. I'm going in wednesday to be finger printed and go over county policy and all that rubbish and then barring an FBI file, I'll be a substitute teacher for Pinellas County. Should be neat. Its a step in the direction I wanted to take. I'll keep all of you updated. I'm waiting for Teri to call me back and finalize out lunch plans. I'll probably see Richy later. Adios

"event","The other day, I went to Adam's party. We started telling each other about brushes we or our friends have had with the supernatural. Adam said that when his home was used as an assisted living facility, a woman died in his guestroom, and he has since seen her spirit. We all got ourselves a little spooked talking about all this, but I began taking pictures. Apparently ghost hunters look for these little blps of light that appear in pictures called orbs. Many of the picture I took had these. My skeptical impression is that it is caused by the flash or the camera not being able to process the information its fed, as these orbs were occuring only in crappy light conditions. On the other hand, I felt that there were more of them when we felt a possible spirit presence and especially around plant life. I posted these pictures for all (well, the ones in which blips and orbs show up).&nbsp; I think they may be faeries, since they have no human shape and appear near plants mostly (but not exclusively). Lemme know what you all think.&nbsp; <A href=""http://community.webshots.com/user/zargon840"">Here's the link</A>"

"event","Hey ya'll. I'm sleepy and in a good mood, but I have a rant and I am not in a rantful mood. So here goes. I hate when the only thing that seperates me from a woman is god. God should never be used to divide people, but nothing makes me feel more alienated than this kind of treatment. The worst offenders are protestants, I'm not sure why, but catholics and non-christians tend to not write people off just because their views differ on religion. Here are two example paragraphs from girls profiles on singleme.com explaining their perfect match:


My mate would have to be athletic and enjoys the out doors. Not a couch potato. Good looking with a sense of humor. A good christian boy who does not mind getting up to go to church on Sundays. Someone who does not look at the little things about a person but looks deeper in the person to see their true side. Also someone with a nice body.


I truly believe in God and try my hardest to put Him first in everything I do.I would love to find a guy who also believes in the same things I do. The qualities I would like him to have would be honesty, loyalty, and most of all trust, because if there is no trust...there is no love! I know he's out there somewhere. Its just a matter of time and the faith in God that He will bless my life with love!

Now, the thing that bothers me in example 1 is the blatent hypocracy. I don't think I have to explain it further. Now, in the second passage, the girl decribes many virtues her perfect mate would have, all of which are qualities I have. Honesty, loyalty, trust. The problem here is because I use a different name for the goodness I ascribe to, she would never consider me as a mate. This bothers me. I've met far too many women who treat me this way, and frankly it sickens me. In fairness to protestants, I once had the same problem with a Mormon. (Member of the Church of Jesus Christ and the Latter Day Saints, for you PCers) Anyway, that's my rant. It won't be popular and it won't make you laugh, and I'm sorry for that. I generally try to be more entertaining. LIke I said, this isn't bothering me much right now, I'm in a good mood. I just wanted to share that with you all, so you understand me a little that much more."

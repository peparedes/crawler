"event","yea i have been really busy lately. me and jaron are talking again and we havent hung out alot lately but i think thta its for the  better because if we are around each other alot then we really start annoying each other and then there are alot more fights but no fist fights that was only once and never again. my back is a lil better but i still get random pains. Last night was ALOT of fun. Carrie threw a surprise party for one of our friends SAM and everybody was there. we all just pretty much sat sround and hung out. but it was really fun but then again there was a lot of drama going on because charlie called me and was like reallllllllyyyyy pissed off and it kinda scared me i dont like it when my guy friends are mad because it scares the hell outta me but it did scare me a lil but not too bad because i know that charlie would never hit me or anything like that. i trust him. for all of u peopel who want to graduate dont do it because when reality really hits u that u have to grow up it sux. my parents are making me pay them rent its 100 dollars a month but its not that bad because then they cant tell me what to do as much anymore and i have  a lot more freedom like before if i was going to tell my mom that i was going to a party she would freak out but niow she doesnt care and i drink with her like last night after i left the surprise party i came home at about 12:00 because i had o pick up my sister and when i got home i had a drink with my mom and linda and carrie (my big sis)there was alot more alcohol in that one drink than i thought becuz when i went to go stand up i couldnt walk straight.yes i am a ligthweight but still there was alot of  alcohol in the drink. i have been drinking alot lately. but im not becoming an alcoholic so no body worry. jaron is still smoking but i am HOPING that she will quit soon. work has been normal work. tiring and everything like that. me and sam sisco were talking today and we were talking about how me her and kelly need to get together because kellys last day here is aug 13th before she leaves for melbourne and we were thinking maybe going to the keys or to orlando or soemthing just a weekend thing because none of us can afford to take off of work for too long. i am already going to lose a lot of money from going to north carolina with my parents and everything like thta because we are going to be gone for almost an entire pay period and that is gonna kill me with my plans and everything. ok well g2g

"event","Ya my life has really sucked lately becuase i dont have one. i mean i work all of the time and if i am not working i am too tired to do anything else. which really sucks and i had to work today from 10-5 with only one 15 min break and thats what sucked the most and my back and everything was killing me but then my manager mrs. vicki put me and crystal on register the rest of the day and then it started to not hurt as bad but i was still tired and everything in that nature. crystal is a really cool girl she's really fun to talk to  and she understands me more than i think anybody could. but anyway ya i have been feeling like jaron and me are drifting away. She never wants to hang wiht just me anymore now she always wants to be with casey or charlie and im happy that she is starting to hang out with some of her other friends but still she shouldnt leave me out of everything. i feel like i am not wanted anymore in thins place which is why i have decided what i am doing wiht my life and i will have to update later on that because i am not ready to say yet. Somedays i just wanna pack all of my things and leave. never look back but then again i love my family and i couldnt hurt them like that. but thats how i feel sometimes especially when i am actually home and everything and i call my friends and they dont wanna hang. Me and sammi have drifted too i feel because we never see each other anymore but we both promised that we would hang during spring break sometime because we never see each other anymore i really miss her because she works all of the time and she gets off work at 8 and i work all of the time and depending where i am working depends on what time i get out. sometimes 10 sometimes 11 depends. and i am also really lonely and jaron is trying to get me with guys who like her. i think that she just feels bad for me because i cant find a guy on my own or something but the truth is that i really am lonely but i dont want a commitment right now because it wont work out becuase i dont have time for a boyfriend or anything like that. but w/e. i have lived this long w/o a b/f why not make me wait longer. but w/e i can deal with it. One day during spring break me and jenn are gonna go get our tattoos. She is getting a tattoo on her foot and also she is getting her tongue pierced. i am just getting a tattoo. which is awesome i think i am either gonna get a chinese symbol that means sun or one that means love but i am leaning more towards the sun one because later on in my life i am going to get a picture of a sun and moon behind the symbol its gonna lookm bad a** OMG i cant wait until then. but first i have to talk to my parents bout it becuase its not gonna be big or anything like that. my mom says that if i wanna get a tattoo while i am still living under  their roof then it cant be any bigger than a quarter. which i am perfectly fine with becuz seriously who would want a BIG tattoo. i am a girl i dont wanna look butch or anything like that so i am sticking wiht a little one. ok well i g2g

whats goin on? notin much here except i started my new job at Tj Maxx and it was very tiring and i am very tired and then on top of it i have to interpret today at the play and i also did it last ngith and my arms felt like they were gonna fall off and they still feel that way. but w/e and i was sooo mad last ngiht that mrs. p didnt show up becuz we could have not been there and could still gotten credit but then again she could have had somebody come that she knows that we dont know and try to trick us to not do our jobs but w/e me and carrie dont really like mrs. p anymore we all think that she pregnant or something like that. but w/e that will be scary having a lil mrs. p running around someday. SCARY!!!! but me and carrie are also pissed off at chelsea becuz all of a sudden she changes everything about the play becuz she didnt like the way that we had everything set up. .but u know what screw her becuz she wasnt at any of the rehearsals and if she really wanted a word in what was going on then she should have showed up and spoke her mind rather than changing it 5 mins before the play started and everything. last night was much fun becuz scott yuken was the person seating the audience and he was making them all laugh sooo hard and everything like that. but then after the play henry was upset and wanted to get drunk and everything and i wanted to but i had to work soooooo i couldnt but all well i will prolly do it after the play tongiht. HOPEFULLY!!!!!! i am sooooooo tired right now. its ridiculous. but i will just have to get over it. so ya i have been really stressed out lately and everything like that but i am not anymore. ok well i g2g

It was fun and really funny at the same time. Then jaron had to be home at 11 so we dropped her off and we went home and my mom was freaking out becuz our ""eyes were glossy"" she thought that we were all high becuz of what JARON said bout her getting high and seeing alex's penis. Ya my mom pretty much told me that if she was gonna keep doing smoking pot that i wasn't allowed to hang with her anymore and she was more worried about the pot being in my car than anything. but she hasnt said anything bout it yet today but i dunno whats goin on. Me and jaron have to work today and i am already looking for a new job becuz i cant take being at coldstone any longer becuz matt and lauren need to stop being so immature about everything and to stop blaming everything that goes wrong in their on jaron me and cori. it's not our fault that something happens and makes them have a bad day. i really dont understand anything that goes on in their heads. but i ahve had a good day today i took care of pop and everything and it was fun i got to talk to my realtives that i havent talked to in like 2 years or so and that was fun and i also talked to aunt trish and that was interesting. ok well i am gonna go

We are just getting along really well or at least thats what i am thinking in case shes thinking something else. but i dunno. Cori and alex are happy as ever. Im happy for them. He seems to be getting in good with my parents and i was having a good day until my dad just informed me that i if i go to cancun then we cant go to cape hatteras and if i go to cape hatteras then i cant go to cancun. So right now i am stuck between a rock and a hard place. Which is just great becuz i hate being in these kind of predickaments. My dad is always putting me down and always trying to make me feel bad to do whatever he wants me to do. and it really sux becuz i really wanna go to cancun but i dunno what i am gonna do.once again my father has ruined a perfectly good day for me. OMG alex grabbed my boobs today while i was driving to coldstone to get money and stuff and i didn't like it one little bit.their not his their mine and hes not allowed to touch them especially grab them. but cori gave him permission and i really cant believe that she did that.ok well i g2g

They are an awesome band and i bought one of their cd's and its an awesome cd. They are like the band sublime. Then we all got tired of the concert and it was really cold. We all went to Grant's house and we just stood outside and hung out and talked and everything. It was fun and when i fell asleep mike pushed my hand and made me poke myself in the eye and it hurt really badly. I almost cried it hurt so bad. He just thought it was funny.Which it wasnt.

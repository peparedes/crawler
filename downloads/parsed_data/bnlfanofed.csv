What am I talking about - I'll be that old in April! 

I have to get my ass in gear and do a quick bathroom cleaning, and dust the living room and then shower and get dressed so I can run to the store and get a small birthday cake, and stop at the ATM. 

His brother is coming over today and I am sending the both of them to Maine Indoor Karting for a day of brotherly bonding and fast go-kart racing. Should be fun!

Then later today Dave and I are going to Vinny T's for dinner.

Seems I have another sinus infection and allergies (which I've never had up until now) and I have some sort of icky bug war raging in my sinus cavities.

So she prescribed me an antibiotic, a nasal spray and some allergy medication which I need to take for a ful month to see if it helps me out. THen I have to stop taking it for a week or so to see if any of the bad feelings come back. If they do, take the allergy stuff again. Yay.

So I go to the pharmacy and ask for the generic brands of all 2 medications. (I remember it costing abot $50 for 2 medications the last time). I am told there are no generics for these meds. Great. I ask how much it will be and am told they can't tell me untilt hey run it through to change me (or some shit like that). Fine, whatever.

I pick up my precriptions and it comes to EIGHTY FUCKING DOLLARS!  Buh!?!?!?  Am I suddently elderly and needing to go to Canada for my medicine?? Jesus H. Chist.

Yeah. I better fucking feel super fucking great after this medicine if used up. For real. I mean like birds better chirp, fairy dust must fly, and I better win the lottery the second I swallow that last pill.

"event","Dave and I just went back to the accident site. Now the rescue crews have spotlights all over  whats left of the house so you can see it better. It's completely devastated. The rumor from the onlookers was that there is a 24 year old girl trapped in the rubble. I don't know if that's true or not. 

I crossed the street this time and went around the back of the house diagonal from the wrecked one so that I could see it head on from the parking lot across the street from the exploded one. I kid you not, almost half the house is scattered across the intersection and into that parking lot I was standing in back of. The rest of the house is barely standing. The house immediately to the left of the blown up one has most of its windows blown out. Miscellaneous window frames and screens are strewn about the street and stuck in bushes. The house diagonal from the wreckage has windows blown out. The Cumberland Farms convenience store before you get to the one I just mentioned has a shattered window. I've never seen anything so devastating up close in my life. I never want to again. 

I'm still so shaken up, and now I'm wide awake and I really need to sleep. I feel like puking.

When I was leaving I passed a lady I vaguely recongnized, smiled politely at her, then noticed the guy behind her with the camera tripod. Then I realized who she was and blurted out ""Hey! She's the nice lady from Channel 13 news!""  Duh.  She laughed at me. :/

And the damn Yankees lost. Again. I really believe the Red Sox will win the whole damn thing. At this point, I will not put it past them.


*Can't sleep, house might blow up*


My cat is still too scared to move from when the explosion happened. Its been over an hour and the poor thing has this terrified look on his face and he's hiding under the end table in the living room. My poor homeboy. :("

I was just ironing and running back and forth watching the game when there was teh biggest explosion sound and the whole apartment building shook like an earthquake. It was so fucking scary! The shaking blew the window fan right out of the window in my bedroom!

I threw some clothes on really quick, and Dave and I headed into the hallway adn downstairs to see if anyone knew what happened. Everyone was up, because the noise/shaking woke up those that were already sleeping. My knees were knocking and I was shaking all over because I was so scared.

Dave went back inside the apartment but I was super nosy and headed off up the street to where the police cars and other people were heading. I cut through a restaurant parking lot that is right up the street from me and I saw a ton of flashing cruiser/ambulance/fire truck lights in the intersection up ahead.

They had blocked the street off and were yelling at all of us to get back. As I looked closer, I realized the entire street was filled with glass. And walls. And insulation. A house had blown up. Half of it was scattered across the street and the rest of it was in ruins. Someone mentioned it may have been propane. I don't know what the fuck happened. I feel so terrible. I hope the people made it out unharmed. Though looking at what was left, I don't have high hopes of that. :( 

Explain to me how an explosion happens and there is a lack of smoke and or fire???

I had just finished dinner (or so I thought). Dave took the Pyrex baking dish out of the oven that I cooked the chicken in adn placed it on the stove. On the back burner I was steaing some asparagus. Or so I thought. I had turned the burner up because it was taking too long and the chicken was almost done. 5 monutes after Dave put the baking dish on the stove top, he realized I had turned the FRONT burner up and not the back one. Immediately after he shut it off, we heard a weird noise and the Pyrex dish EXPLODED all over us, half the kitchen and intot he living room!!! Holy hell it was friggin scary!

Neither of us moved or breathed for like 3 minutes because it scared us so badly. Luckily, and amzingly, we weren't hurt at all. I don't even know how that happened. There were millions of pieces of glass everywhere! We tried to sweep them up but most of them had melted into the linoleum floor. So, now we have a completely ruined kitchen floor with lots and lots of ugly burn marks all over it from the hot Pyrex glass. Our landlords are going to be SO PISSED. There goes any chance of getting back a security deposit if and when we move, huh? 


BW, as a reminder to myself: I need to lose 1 more pound to make it a total of 10 pounds (I think) lost since I started ww a month ago. I can do that. Though, I feel like I am losing so slowly. The past 2 weeks I have been really bad about snacking. I need to be better about that. Also, eventually, when I feel better about myself, I will need to work in some real excersize. Yes. Until then, slow and steady. Indeed."

Interestingly, I have not had my beloved iced coffee in 3 days. I fugured they would not calculate well into points and are bad for me anyway because I take them with cream and like 4 sugars. But today I really needed caffeine. My brain is in slug mode. I knew that Starbucks was on the list of things I can have so I got a grande mocha light frappucino which is only 3 points! yay! FOr shits and giggles I calculated a 16 oz dunkin donuts iced coffee with cream and sugar and it was 7 points! OMG, that's a lot! So I feel good knowing I can have the starbucks frap light and still stay in my points range, but I feel bad knowing that they are on teh expensive side and I can't have them as often as I'd like. I kicked my everyday Starbucks habit a while ago becuase it got too pricey.

Today is the day one mouse lost its tail. And by lost I mean IT WAS FUCKING EATEN OFF BY ONE OF THE OTHERS!!!!!!

So gross. I feel bad for it. It doesn't look like it bled much at all. He's running in the wheel. I can't tell if he's in pain. It just looks damn gross.

And, I'd like to know where the rest of the tail is. Did on of the other mice find it and think ""ooohh, spaghetti!"" and eat it??

It must have happened in the few hours Dave and I were gone to the movies and to dinner. Poor things tail was looking a little beaten up the past couple of days and this morning there seemed to be a large cunk missing from it, and now there is all but a tiny stump left of his tail.

I hope it'll be okay...


Saw Garden State today. I thought it was really good. Dave actually liked it, too, which I was surprised to hear.

Then we went to the 99 Restaurant for dinner because there are no restaurants in the immediate area. Bah to that. I actually had some adult beverages, which I hardly ever do. I had a margarita and a pina coloda. Usually after drinking that much I'd be well on my way to being loopy. I didn't even feel anything. How disappointing. :(
And the damn waitress didn't card me. I always get carded for everything. I was crushed. That must mean I finally look my age?

Then we came home and Dave watched the race and I wastched New York Minute. I didn't think it sucked like everyone else did. It was a cute movie not really intended for adults, but more for the normal Olsen twin crowd of 12 year olds. Of which I am one even though I am 26. ;)

Well as of yesterday it was really bad and it looked all white like he was going blind. So Dave dropped him off at teh vet this AM and I picked him up after work. Apparently, Scooter somehow got a piece of the wheat-like part of the  hay in his eye and it managed to work itself way in there. They let me bring it home in a little jar thing. /dork!!
Now we have to put this goopy ointment on his eye for 10 days and he should be okay. I forgot to ask the vet if it will affect his vision at all, because the whiteness over his eye is like an ulcer from being so irritated. I really hope not. Poor pig.:(

Last Friday I woke up to a very painful very swollen left pointer toe (for lack of a better decription at the moment).

I do not know what happened to it. The previous night Dave and I walked on the beach, but I did not stub it, smash it, or hurt it at all to my knowledge. I'm sure I would have felt it had I hurt it at that point. I went to bed and it was fine, but I woke up to a gross painful toe.

Fast forward to today, almost a week later, and it is still swollen and painful. Except I was wicked smart and smashed my toe this morning  walking in the dark which now has my toe the most swollen its ever been. I mean, its gross looking. Like a deformity, even.

Today while at work, I could feel the pain moving over to underneath my big toe. That can't be good can it?

Yes, this weekend that is supposed to be hot. I feel bad for Dave. Jocelyn + Heat + Long Car Ride - Air Conditioning = BAD TIMES.

Not good dude. Not good.

So yes, my mommy is moving this week into her new 6 bedroom home. Mind you, it is just her and her finace. His kids visit every other weekend if all goes well. So they each need their own bedroom. Fine. So at the most, they need a 4 bedroom house - One for each of the kids, one for my mom and her fiance, and an office for them to share for their businesses. But Nooooo. Mommy also needs a ""sewing room"" and a ""TV room/spare bedroom"". Okaaay. She currently has a ""sewing room"" that houses her sewing maching, all the quilting stuff and lots of junk because she does not use the room for its intended purpose. It has become a storage room for JUNK. That is what the room in the new house will be, too, mark my words.

So yeah, the new place is too huge for them, but whatever. There are also 2 living rooms. Sorry, one is a living room and the other is the ""family room"".

They currently do not have enough furniture to fill all these rooms. So frniture shopping for almost all new furniture except for the bedrooms and the office will be forthcoming, I am sure.

I can  hardly wait to help my mom unpack all her crap. Can you just feel the excitement?"

To tell me about the Friendly's in Arlington that was closed due to Hepatitis outbreak.

Her and her fiance ate there last week. Now they have to go on Friday for a vaccination thingy.

Go mom. Rock on with your hepatitis from someone's poop or whatever. SO fucking gross.

Let this be a lesson. Don't eat at Friendly's, and always wash your hands before returning to work.


My sister-in-law just sent me pictures of her first ultrasound today.
I can see little tiny babies in there! On Friday she will be 7 weeks along, so its just a tiny little baby peanut! She's picked out good names, providing that the twins are 1 boy and 1 girl. Emma and Dylan. I like those names.

This will be my second set of twin nieces/nephews! My sister and brother-in-law had twins almost 2 years ago. 

It's weird how both my sister and sister-in -law had to get in vitro, huh?
My sister tried getting pregnant for 2 years before the went the in vitro route, and my sister-in-law has been trying since she got married 5 years ago!

My cat puked on the new couch a little while ago. I almost killed him. Asshole cat."

"event","Spiders.

One of my biggest fears in life.

HATE THEM.

Dave and I were just lying on the couch watching the MTV Movie Awards in the semi dark.

He gasps loudly and points up. I follow his finger to see the HUGEST MOTHERFUCKING SPIDER EVER dangling over us!!! Gah! I freaked out, jumped up, and dashed across the room while the evil vile creature climbed up its fucking ass web string to the top of the window. 

I stood there across the room frozen in fear while dave yelled at me to get a paper towel. I couldn't move and I could barely breathe. He got the paper towel and went to kill it, while I freaked again because it looked like it was going to jump and I ran back farther into the hallway.

I am barefoot. Already fucking freaked out and shaking, I happen to catch something moving to my left. I looked down to find ANOTHER HUGE SCARY SPIDER of the SAME HUGE creepy variety scurrying across the floor towards my BEDROOM!! 

NOT ACCEPTABLE.

So I squished the fucker with a big boot.

Both carcasses were promptly flushed down the toilet. With a double flush. Always double flush the bugs for fear they may live and crawl out and bite my ass the next time I sit down.

So I am still shaking, my heart won't calm down and I am paranoid that we have a colony of huge fucking spiders living in the apartment with us and we just killed mommy and daddy. I'm scared the babies will come eat my brain while I sleep.

SO SCARED. :(


This tops off a day that started with me alone in the house with a HUGE inch and a half long BEE that tried to fly up my towel this morning. The cat was watching it  crawl around instead of trying to kill it like a REAL cat would.

Then the bee flew to the ceiling where I am too short to reach it. Smart bees are even scarier. I continued to get ready for work and I glanced across the hall to see what the bee was doing and to see if my cat was still watching it.

The bee was GONE. Vanished. Poof. And so was my cat. Couldn't find him anywhere and he wouldn't come when I called for him. 

I left here this morning convinced that the bee ate my cat and then took off.


I hate bugs. HATEHATEHATEHATEHATE.


HATE.


So freaked out. I have the willies now. SO bad.


Hold me."

As nice as it is to have a visitor, I do not like you.
You showed up uninvited, and you hurt.
You are a burning knot of anxiety pain and you should go. Now. Shoo.

Never come back.

Love,

Dear Mommy's doctor person,

Please give my mommy good news on Friday.

She is a good person and doesn't deserve cancer again.

I will be forever greatful.

It's sick. You'll go blind.

Leave it alone or I'll cut it off.

Dear Max,

When I leave in the morning, you are on the chaise.
When I come back at night, you are still there.

You need to leave the couch sometimes. 
Please. You are starting to freak me out.

You need to eat and drink and pee.

Movement is a good thing. Be a normal cat and cause trouble or something.

Hugs and smotherings,
Mommy

Dear nice Pepsi driver at work,

Stop hinting things and saying things that make my mind stray.

"event","That question isn't relevant to anything. I just saw one floating around on the turnpike on my way home and wondered.


I could throw up right now. I have had a huge knot in my stomach all day. Ever since my mom called me at work to tell me she was on her way to the breast surgeon for a biopsy. :9


Back story (I don't think I posted about it yet?)
Last Monday my mom went for a regular yearly mammogram. (is that how you spell it? I don't even care..I'm too distraught). No problem, until they called her Tuesday morning to tell her that she needed to go back for a more complete, better one (or whatever) the following week.

So she calls me that night all upset because now she's really nervous and scared because what if something's wrong? I calmed her down by telling her she'd be fine and that they just needed to see her again because she had great boobs and they wanted to see them again. ;) But really, she's very upset because she doesn't want to be told she has cancer again (she had a raical hysterectomy when she was 25 for cervical cancer. She was so happy when they 20 year cancer free mark passed at Christmas) and have them remove something else from her body.

Fast forward to today when I get the call fro her saying she's going to the breast surgeon. I had totally forgotten she had her second appointment for another mammogram today. SO this was a complete shock. She said they found some lumps that looks fishy today and needed to get them biopsied. She started crying, and I wa already crying. She should find out Friday what's going on. 

I am so fucking scared for the results. You have no idea. My worst fucking nightmare would be for my mom to have breat cancer (or any kind of cancer again). I can't even think about it. I get a pain in my stomach everytime I think about it and I want to throw up. I can barley keep the tears in just thinking about it. Today sucked, trying to put on a happy face at work.

I know there is a great chance that she is going to be fine, but the chance that she might not be okay is what scares the living hell out of me.

All this, and its not even what she went to the doctor for about her other issues that's she's been having. We're still waiting on more tests for that which was making us all nervous because it could also be something bad. Now she has this to worry about, too. It's not fair. My mom is so small and sick with heart problems, thyroid issus and some other stuff, too. She doesn't need something worse hanging over her tiny little head.

Someone tell me she will be okay. Please?"

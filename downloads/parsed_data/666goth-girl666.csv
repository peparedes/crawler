"event","Ok.  Here's what my morning was like:

Got up at 11.
Realized it was Saturday.
Kinda freaked out.
Took a shower.
Dried my hair.
Freaked out some more.
Got dressed.
Changed.
Changed again.
Changed a few more times.
Freaked out some more.
Changed again.
Did my makeup.
Took off my makeup.
Did my makeup again.
Put on shoes.
Put on different shoes.
Collected all my DVD's (and by all I mean Clerks, Clockwork Orange, and my two Eddie Izzard DVD's).
Got my dad to take me to the Cast party.

The party was pretty fun.  We watched the animated Clerks DVD because we decided Clockwork Orange wasn't a very ""party""ish movie.  After the party, Clark and I went to meet up with Paul and Iris at Riccuti's (sp?) for our double date.  The food was yummy.  The silences were awkward and plentiful.  But we still had fun.  After dinner, we went to go see Cursed (it sucked pretty bad).  
No kiss or anything.
But oh well.
It was the first date.
Maybe next time?  Definitely next time.
Overall, I had a really good time today.
I'm hoping for some more days like this."

Because of the halfness of the day, I went with Max, Paul, Zack, Clark, Ian, and Scott to Soles for lunch as a kinda cast party.  It was super rad.  Then we all went back to Paul's house (except for Max) to hang out.  We played video games and such.  Then everyone except for Scott, Clark and I left.
We played some more video games while Clark and I flirted some more.  Which was pretty cool...
I still don't know if he likes me or not, though.  Like I said, he could just be flirting...just for the sake of flirting.
Sigh...I wish I knew...I don't like taking chances....

Opening night was awesome.  Outside Looking In was almost perfect except for when Scott's chair collapsed and the back part of the stage got pushed backwards and Scott fell off the stage.  At least I'm pretty sure that's what happened.  I was backstage at the time.  But in a way, it made the play better.  Because it was really funny.
And the next day it went pretty well, except I forgot to run out really fast during the ""soda explosion"".  So I was a little late on that.  But oh well.
And today was the first night of Falling From Grace.  I worked so hard memorizing my lines and cues.  But because Juniper is in like three or something other plays, she couldn't practice with us much.
So basically, some of my big lines were skipped and some of the play didn't make sense.  But oh well.  But I was so nervous before it and during it that I was shaking and asthma-ing and freaking out.  Even afterwards I was breathing kinda funny.  
It ended up ok...but I'm hoping that we'll do a lot better tomorow.  And I'm actually gonna be fairly pissed if we don't."

So here's my weekend so far:

On Friday I stayed after school for Dinner Theater dress rehearsal.  I'm kinda pissed because a few minutes before we went on, Gina ran up and said ""Juniper doesn't know her lines!""  so a lot of lines were skipped or screwed up and I don't think any of us did very well at all.  Especially me.  I think I did really bad. 
Then my dad picked me up at 4 and drove me to my hair appt and I was there from 4:30 to about 8.  That's how long it took to get the black out.  Marilyn had to bleach it 4 times to get it this light.  
After my appt, my mom picked me up and we stopped to get pizza because my awesome little cousin Alex (except she's not really my cousin, but kinda...) and her parents came over.  I had a lot of fun.
Yesterday Becca and I went to a bunch of thrift stores.  I got a neat little poka-dot shirt, a lime green spaghetti strap shirt that's really long and has a layer of mesh on it (the straps were waaaaay too long so I had to take the threads out and re-sew the straps onto the shirt), a mandarin dress which is really funny lookin because it has shoulder pads, and a crazy pattern green-ish button up shirt.  Oh, and some black pearls.  I got all this for less than 20 dollars.  I fucking love thrift stores.
Then Becca and I went back to her house for dinner theater practice (to which only me, Becca, Gina, and Jeremy came) and we did the second scene over and over again until it was perfect.  But I'm really worried of us sucking at the real thing.
When everyone left, Becca and I watched TV for a while.  Then Becca's brother had a friend over to get drunk with.  And Becca's brother isn't pleasant drunk.  He was making an ass of himself.  And some girl came over too.  I don't remember her name, but whoever she was, she and that other guy were still there this morning.  Becca and I went upstairs to bed at about 2 and stayed up until almost 4:30 talking.  And of course, Jon came up in the conversation.  And we ended up talking about him.  And I just started crying.  It was really hard staying quiet.  I didn't want Becca to feel bad about bringing him up so I stayed silent.  Besides, his name probably would have come up sooner or later whether Becca mentioned him or not.  So I just cried for a while.  I fucking hate guys.  Because I realized that even though he was special to me, and even though he was the one boyfriend I've ever felt so strongly about, and even though I still think about him a lot (even though he dumped me about 7 months ago), I honestly don't think I meant much.  I mean, maybe I did at the time when we were going out, but now I'm probably just another notch in his fucking belt.  I don't think he thinks about me anymore.  I doubt he even cares about whether or not I still think about him.  I doubt it matters to him how much he meant to me.  I was just another girlfriend.  Just another girl who he told he was going to fucking marry.  Yeah.  He said he would marry me.  Bullshit, right?  But I fucking believed him.  I did.  And that's how stupid I am.  I bought that bullshit.  ""We're going to be together forever and nothing will tear us apart blah blah blah fucking blah.""
I really am an idiot.  And guys really do suck.  But for some reason us girls keep falling for them.  
But whatever.  I'm trying to forget.  Plenty of guys have broken up with me.  And I've broken up with a few, too.  And it takes some time, but I get over it.  But for some reason, he was different.  And I can't get over it.


Going out for Dim-Sum and to the mall with Sam soon.  I better pull myself together.  Maybe it'll take my mind off of things."

I'm going to Boston to see my bro bro.  There's an extra bed in his new apartment, so I'll be staying there while my parents sleep in a hotel.  
Ben says he's gonna show me all the cool places in Boston.  He's even gonna take me around to all the awesome stores to get some rad clothes to fit my new rad attitude.
These stores include a kick-ass TWO STORY THRIFT STORE where you pay for clothes BY THE POUND.  He says they have some really interesting girl's clothes there.  And his friends might come along too.  Which is cool because I'm excited to meet them.

Too bad we'll only be there for two nights.

But anyway, that movie sucked something horrible.  The three of us were talking most of the time so people threw something at us.
It was SO BAD!
If you're thinking of seeing it, don't waste your money.  Seriously.  It was shit.
After the movie, we came back here and ate apple crisp and ice cream.  We hung out for a while and had fun.  Eventually Chaz left. Then Allie and I watched some of SNL with my parents.  Then my mom and I drove Allie home.

Today my mom decided to keep her promise and took me to the mall.  I found a pair of jeans that are actually comfortable.  They're kinda baggy, but they fit my butt nice. ^_^

I also got a cerulean blue ""Hugs Not Drugs"" t-shirt and a white fishnet undershirt.  I also picked up a copy of the Scissor Sisters CD so I could have the liner note and such even though I already have the songs on my iPod.  Oh, and I also found a super inexpensive fake pearl nekclace on pretty black lace.  This way I can stop borrowing my mom's pearls.

I spent the rest of the day writing writing a paper for English class about All Quiet on the Western Front and an essay for sociology on the conflict theory and functionalism theory applied to the Iraqi election.

This weekend turned out to be not as bad as I thought.
And I don't hate anyone.

So my mom said she would take me to the mall today.

When a girl calls you with a custom tone and it's ringnin' on your brand new phone, you get SPRUNG!

I can just imagine the people who really ordered that tone.  Just think of some rich white kid's phone ringing with that song;

*Raises hand!*
I know there's no chance of having a date this year.
*Sigh*

In about 15 minutes I'm leaving for my first night school class.  I'm kinda nervous.  Most people there are gonna be older than me.  I'm really not good at meeting new people.  At all.  I get shy at all the wrong times.
Hell, I still haven't talked to my new neighbor who walks home right behind me EVERY DAY.  But I don't think she really wants to meet me...
But hey, I don't blame her.
If I saw myself dancing down the side of the road against traffic to really loud bouncy music, I would definitely think I was a freak too."

I really like sociology so far.  It's fun.  And I have Cole which is cool.  We have little discussions about random  things.  Yesterday we discussed Micheal Jackson; whether he is black or white and if he is innocent.  Today we debated if Ashley Simpson sucks or not.  Luckily, sucking won and I didn't have to lose all faith in human society.

This week's psychiatrist appointment has been cancelled.  Which is kinda good because as much as I like having someone to talk to, something life changing doesn't happen EVERY week.  Sometimes we run out of topics and just sit in silence for a half hour or so.

Babysitting Dominic was super fun yesterday.  My dad asked to hold him at one point, and as soon as he picked him up, he threw up all over his shoulder.  Haha...baby likes me better..."

We're supposed to be ""learning to type"" but I already know how to type...so fuck it.
Besides, this requires typing, right?  Right.
I can't wait until next period because I have Child Development.  I love teaching those kids!  They're awesome.  But since it's the last period of the day, our class has to walk the kids down to their parents and the parents obviously don't like my...style.  I don't exactly get the nicest looks.  
And then after my psychiatrist appointment tonight, I get to babysit little Dominic!  Yay!  He's so adorable.  If livejournal were actually safe, I would post pictures of him.  But...no.

Today is shaping up to be pretty awesome.

Haha the sentences in this typing program are so stupid.  But use for a semicolon is kinda limited...

""He has a jak salad.""  What the hell is a jak salad?!  I suppose we'll never know.  
It's one of life's great mysteries.


Class is almost over.
Lata, biotches!"

Still single, still sucks bad.
I really like one of my friends, but he's on a ""break""...so that's not happening.
I also kinda have a crush on one of the guys in Becca's play with me.  

I think I'm gonna be single for a while."

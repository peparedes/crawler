"event","I've been wondering something for a very long time now. I've been wondering why you all live in Heather's system knowing how they feel about me and the simple fact you were created for me and Renee and those in my system and Renee's. But yet you do not reside here... You reside elsewhere. Is there a reason for that. If so I would like an answer as well if there isn't then I will release you from the bargain you've made with me because I honestly do not want any help from anyone in Heather's system any further since I'm blamed for everything that goes wrong. Including the bs about Monica being my fuck up. Which isn't the truth because I didn't make Monica a nyghtmare she made herself on years ago. *shrugs and sighs* just shakes her head and goes back to spending time with hubby before bed. I would like an answer to my questions within the next week or so. Because if I don't get an answer by then I'll just terminate our bargain under the pretense you have no reason for not residing in my system.

Bargain has been terminated. I've been managing fine on my own for a while now. I will do just fine.

"event","We have done as you've asked. However Nikki will never step foot in Heather's room ever again. She has cut all ties with you and everyone else. She's tired of the fucking bullshit and the fucking games. As well Nikki has banned Renee from speaking to sj or any of sj's alters period. Because of the childish bullshit.

*shakes Her head as She watches Nikki fume because of things she's over heard lately. Nikki feels like she's being blamed for everything that's going wrong. Just shuts up and goes back to spending time with Her children and hopes Justin's alright since Myself and Tyrone weren't able to find Him.

Renee can speak with anyone in sj's system or whomever she wishes at this point."

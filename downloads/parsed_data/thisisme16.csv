"event","sometimes I wish I could stand out over the peer and examine myself. I would look out over my ocean and decide that I am too full of salt and seaweed. Maybe I might run myself through a filter and come out the other end pure and flawless. which is a useless concept because I know that somewhere down the line someone will step into me, find themselvs too cold to swim and just pee in me to keep themselves warm. 

I was looking through a kelidescope today and noticed that the light doesn't bend on its own. when you change yourself the colors mold to you and form shapes that suit your mood. when you look through the tube you are staring at a visual representation of the world you wish you knew but cant seem to find because everyone seems to be too narrowminded or situations are too embaressing or maybe conscience gets in the way or maybe you are so close to splitiong in half the you fear that the light and colors are too intense and your skin will just fall off of your bones. I wish I was bonless. I am easier to consume that way.

12345678910111213141516forever. some numbers are hard to handle. like nothing and never and forever and somtimes. no one really can grasp the conscept of forever or nothing because it is beyond our reahlm of comprehension. nothing just seems like a waste and forever seems like a bore. For me never seems like a bold statement because no one really knows what they will do in the future unless they are living in the past in which case the future which is yet to come could be the present or may have already happened. Which leaves us with maybe.An inconsistent pile of safety which calms the mind and grates the soul. It stands alone as the one word which could quite possibly send this shadow of a man to a place where he could very logically ask his own human counterpart ""boy, why are you crying?"""

"event","good day for a fuckin update. I feel good like really good and I kinda haven't felt that way for a while. I think its because I left my phone at andy's so no one called me so I just got to hang out at my house with my dog and eat icecream and fall asleep on the couch. I think every once in a while one has to tell their friends to go fuck themselves for a night because tonight one may just want to be alone. Uhhhhhhh good day though. went to ailis and worked on lyrics. Saw kati and gave her a hug  and her hair was wet but hey she just got out of the ocean so ya know... that explains it. Saw jessica and aillison and Krista and some other girl at subway for like 37 seconds and then went to go get my schedual at school. Had to get somthing at home before I could get it so i went home and got it and then came back and got it again. hehehehehe eahhhh you had a be there...whooo. yes. so then andy and dusty and I went to the beach and went boogie bordin yeahb. Haven't done that for a while good times. then dusty had to leave and andy and I spat at the same time and had a nice moment then we showerd off and went back to his house and sat in a hot tub for a while and realised that we really needed bitches to accompany us but it didn't happen. then I came home. so basically X=sex."

"event","kinda didn't do much today i think. or maybe i did alot but just didn't accomplish anything significant. I had a band practice where we didn't really write anything new. Picked up aili and then me and she trucked on over to special K's house and escorted here via my car to her work. then Aili and I hung out with steph and then we went back to my house where we met Jessica and Allison. Which soon became Me Jessica Aili Allison and Harry and then that morphed into Me Jessica Harry Aili allison and Devan. Then we all hung out outside and watched the sunset on a blanket surrounded by three candels and an electric Lantern and I played guitar. were hippies I know. it sucks. Oh yeah we predict that harry is gonna get West nile virus ( sorry buddy...we'll miss you) but hey shit happens! So I thinks its so cool how Im all sick and so I cant talk, or sing, or sleep through the whole night, or work out, or bath in a hot tub filled with marmalade...gosh.Idiot! So sorry my journal isn't verry interesting but I don't really know how to change stuff so you guys are just gonna have to be entertained by what i have to say rather than abunch of pictures of friends or flashy lights or whatever. Im not feeling very poetic today. too bad this could have been an interesting journal. Maybe next time."

Today woke up, or rather was woken up, at 5 in the morning while i was enjoying a rather deep sleep in kati's jolly jump. A bunch of us then purchased some early morning nourishment at the international house of pankakes and then kati and I went back to katis house where kati eventually fell asleep and I trucked on over to Johnny's pad to where I found an unconcious asian on the floor and a quite drowsy pacific islander on johnny's bed. Johnny Devan and I watched glowsticking stuff and then we left and I took devan and cory home. I went to a little gathering at the park with the cast of my show and we played some games, one of which was to see who could hold an eight pound wheight above them the longest and I won so hooray for alex's deltoids. Came  home and saw my brother and Tiff for a few minutes and then they cruised on back to santa cruz. My daddy and I then saw the movie Dodgeball which was really stupid but kinda funny somtimes. and then i hung out with mike and harry and ned and a bunch of other random people that I don't know, for about an hour but then they went to the beach and i decided to go home and sleep instead.-------------------------------------------------My thoughts for now----------------------------------------------------------------I miss my love-Im really tired-I love kati-I wonder how jessica's date went?-what the shit happened to the movie that I was supposed to be in? -my shoulders hurt.-shmehhh!"

Met entracing italian girl. Ate a bunny.-------------------------------------------------------Came home. Saw Aili. Things are clear now. Things were explained. I Feel better.----------------------------------------------------------------The idea that We might really break up for good is starting to sink in now. I love her so much that it hurts and it is with that love that I can let her go. I have to let her work things out with herself. She needs to be happy. I will be happy if she is happy, with me or without. Until then I will try at least not to be miserable. Im am not going to activly try to meet someone else but if it happens then it will. What I need know is good friends who can comfort me....God Im such an asshole, trying to be the victim! Look at this Im being a whiny bitch. Forget about what I need. This really is what we need. Both of us. I see now what the break up was for, and I understand. We have nothing to fear. Now i just await the day that I can open the ""Aili droor"". That day will come when she is happy."

I can't pick up fine bitches with this little love tat on my neck. Damnit! Alright alex just calm down count to ten....Hgokay Im better. So I talked to my brother and he made me feel better yesterday. He has the same hair as I do. He looks hot. He looks like me.   You should hook up with him cause then I would know that Im hot. Wow bad Idea..scratch that. Chris doesn't think that we will stay broken up the whole summer... I kinda hope he's right. Let's just not screw this up because I do believe that it is the best thing for us. Alright I need to stop dwelling on the past (you) and start thinking about the future (bitches) I think I might start hanging out with Doug because he always goes to parties. Im gonna call him today. Good Idea alex, way to use people! Have a good day. Ill right before I leave from rehearsal because Im going directly from their to long beach where we will stay in a hotel and get on a plane the next morning. YAAAEEAAAHH."

I guess nothing really changed except that know I know that we wont be a couple until the end of the summer, which kinda bums me out but if it needs to be done then im full throttle... except how about this? why don't we discuss our status 1 week before summer ends. That way if we decide to be a couple again we can have that week to be with each other. If I become your boyfriend I want a few days of you to have all to myself and I want to be able to devote all my attention to you. What do you think? Whatever think about it and write back. By the way my head hurts. Partly because I have been crying but mostly due to that headbut woman, god! I hope you get that job. I care about you so much so ...fuckin...be happy this summer. Get some sleep, be with your friends, be open to new people and be your own Aili again. Im glad we got to say goodbye today. It was what we needed. Just know that your lips are forever burned onto mine."

"event","yesterdays rehearsal sucked! it was the whole cast standing next to the piano learning really difficult songs for 4 hours! It was useless because after the first 2 hours I was so swamped with new music that I couldn't absorb anything else. Plus i've just been mentally exausted anyway so by the end of the rehearsal I felt like a fucking puddle of mush. Anyways I hope your day went better. My bro is comming home today at around afternoon time so im gonna ""hgang with hgim"" (that was in Greek accent if you didn't pick that up)...My abs hurt...alot...like...nrrahhh. Harry showed me this ab excercise that he does in the weight room during track. I certainly feel like it's working. Yesterday I put on your ring. I also put the one on that I bought when I was with you. They look good. I like having things that remind me of you nearby because now I can look at them withought crying. It's kinda empowering to know that I don't have to cry at the thought of you. I can smile. And I do."

It cant go anywhere but uphill from here! Think about it, if this works out and in a few weeks or months or however long this takes we are together again as a couple, as lovers it will be the best thing that has happened to us as an ""us"" yet. If it doesn't work out and we decide that we should break up for good(I really hope that that DOESN'T happen) but if it does we will still be able to see each other and there is know way that we will not continue to be best friends! Our relationship,romantic or not, will be the strongest ever. I will love you forever (or until the earth runs out of food) We just have to hang in there. In the mean time Im going to go have alittle ALEX time. Maybe make a cake, go bowling, shop at Pier One Imports, Whatever! The point is that this doesn't have to be as depressing as I thought. Don't think this means that I don't care about what is going on by not be depressed.

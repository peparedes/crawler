Heaven is a place of beauty where you feel loved and everything is good.

Hell is a place of torture and hate.

Or so that is what we are told.

The life you live gives you certain thinking patterns and defines how you act and behave.  People who are 'good' tend to live more positive lives and have things they love and are happy.  People who are 'evil' tend to live negative lives with little love and lots of hate.

When you die your brain is active for about 6 minutes.  In dream time... 6 minutes can be 100 years.  I think that your brain does one of the following things while you're dead:

A) Your brain panics, it tries to compute all the data it holds at once and that results in you reliving your life in 'flashbacks'.  Which would explain why people have their life flash before their eyes when they're in a near death situation, their brain begins the panic sequence.

B) You are dying peacefully, so your brain continues to act as it normally would.  If you were a 'good' person who lived a happy life, your thoughts would generally be happy and when you die your brain will continue to function on that level and you will see loved ones and things you've done that make you happy.  That is heaven, that is the heaven people talk about who are brought back from being dead by doctors.

C) You are dying peacefully, or violently and are just acceptant of the fact you're going to die.  You were an 'evil' person who lived a miserable hate filled existence.  Your thoughts are generally negative and filled with hate, so as you die your brain continues to function on it's normal wavelength and your hate filled images are what you experience... In other words, hell.  And once again it explains why people who are generally 'evil' and are brought back from death by doctors speak of seeing such horrible things.

The key to going to heaven or hell isn't in how you act..  It's in how your subconcious view your actions, and how often positive and negative thoughts cross your mind.  A man who slaughtered 100 babies and had happy thoughts his whole life will go to his version of heaven.  But a man who did nothing bad his whole life but had negative thoughts because he always repressed his urges would go to his version of hell because he would die with a negative thought pattern.

Think about it... :)

"event","Secret battle, eternal
Blind are common eyes
Do you see? No, you never see
A battle you never fight, a battle you never see
Invisible claws maul and scar
Warriors fight alone
Warriors fall alone...

Common mouthes call weakness, call shame
Commons are not aware
Commons never open their eyes; their weapon is Ignorance: the axe
Great Warriors battle the blind
Great Warriors battle the demons
Beheaded

Ears which hear no sound
Common ears; deaf ears
Cry for help
Deaf world

The Hero stands
Alone, shamed
What is a hero without a reason to fight?
The hero falls.

"event","What is the difference between an animal and a human?  Humans build off of each other while animals do not.

Let's say there's 2 people and let's name them Bud and Joe.

Bud learned to break branches off of trees.  Bud teaches Joe how to break a branch off of a tree, so Joe breaks off a branch and then proceeds to hit the ground with it and squash a bug.  Bud watches Joe squash the bug and then uses the branch to kill an animal for food.

This is a very simplistic example.  I do not feel like making a complex one, and I doubt you would have the patience to read it.  

So anyways, people build off of each other and that is how we have come to the societies we have now.  We are all one, everything we know is derived from the people we interact with and the people before us, going all the way back to good old Bud and Joe, as well as the people we interact with.  In a way... You are everyone, and everyone is you.

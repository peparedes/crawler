"event","well, it finally happened... they found out that i was going to rock valley collage during my lunch break. what i did though <i>was</i> pretty stupid, looking back on it i mean. to explain it all id have to go back a little... 

last week or so there was some fairly good 60 mph winds that bent parts of this gate that separates my school from rvc. and because this one girl tried to get in a little too hard (she was fighting to keep the door open while this teacher was trying to close it) they increased the security a little and closed the gate. how they closed it i have no idea, cause the latch was broken in a way that stopped it from being able to move. but thats beside the point. the point is that they closed the gate and it couldnt be opened. so i jumped over this other gate and rolled under another to get into rvc, which i was told i had permission to be in, but apparently not... yay. so to add to the fun a hall monitor saw us (my friend and me) and alerted whoever and a so one thing lead to another and a cop from rvc found us in the computer lab and we almost got arrested. even though my friend had only tagged along for the ride.

i feel like an ass hole for him getting suspended for a day. i got suspended too but he shouldnt have. they pissed off that they cant find some guy thats been doing shit thats been fucking up their network. so they take it out on my friend and me.

you know, some times it can be fun having a slightly higher intelligence than most... sometimes its nice to know exactly what the other person is really trying to accomplish, like when they play good cop bad cop their trying to get you to confess. now i didnt necessary for them to use more mentally aggressive techniques like staring right at us or separating us because we werent showing any signs of aggression. hell, my friend kept on saying sir.they were pretty good at it, i just realized that if any authority figure had asked me anything i probably would have told them the truth.

they were even trying to get me worried about what my parents might do. like they could really do much more. i havent been allowed to talk to anyone that even pretends to give a shit for over two months, and now they take away the phone cord that was used to connect my computer to the internet so i cant even type to anyone. i dont have a door on my room. all that they have left to steel from me is my computer, which is my only form of expression anymore. so when they take that away the only escape ill have to turn to is drugs, and there wont be anything for them to punish me with. arent my parents smart. im surprised that they didnt already take my computer away, actually. its getting harder for me to make coherent sentences now so i better stop now..."

"event","wow. my ""parents"" have the best timing. heres the what happened...
first i've been insane for almost all day. i didnt stop moving for for more than 2 minutes, didnt stop eating for more than 5 minutes, and had to struggle get a coherent sentence together. oh man, it was real fun shit. then i decide to go in my room and watch a movie. i was laying there finaly becoming stable (i hadnt eaten in a half hour, was able to stay still for about 25 minutes, and was able to think straight), when my poor excuse of a father walks in and asks ""so how were you able to get online yesterday?"" take a guess at the reason for this question. oh, this is great. you gotta here this one. ""the phone cord was plugged in."" yes thats right, because my computer was physically plugged in to the phone jack i had to be on the internet. never mind that we had messages that were left on the answering machine when they were gone. or that i didnt know the password to log on. cause i was on the internet... FUCKING RETARDS!

 hahah... just remembered an even better part. i found out what the password is today, and youll never be able to guess it... its my ""mothers"" maiden name. yes thats right, they were actually stupid to use her maiden name. when i found out i couldnt stop laughing. of course i <i>was</i> a little out of it at the time. but still <b><i>her maiden name!!!</i></b> god, thats worse than using your birthday as a password! at least with a birthday theres more than one way to put it! i cant believe that they were that stupid! i almost tried that as a password yesterday too. i wish i had tried it... at least then he would have had a reason to yell at me. hahahaha OH JESUS hahaha.

well, at least something useful came out of all of this. i found out that i like scratching myself so hard that i bleed more than cutting."

"event","i finally had a fairly good day! only 2 things didnt go my way. not going my way is a lot better than going wrong. and they were little things too. first i didnt get this really small and really old computer. the only reason i wanted it was so i could make it better than my dads and laugh at him. so that was no big deal. then this one guy took my graphing calculator and was being a little bitch about giving it back. then i found out that there was no reason to get it back. its alright though, cause the day started out pretty good. first, when i woke up it was raining. then i got to talk to <lj user=SilentRegrets> for a little bit during my second hour. so its all good. hehe. :)"

"event","well, it finally happened. my parents caught me on the internet. so im not going to be able to update for a while... at least until i can get one of those free earthlink accounts. but im still going to have to use the phone line, which means more sneaking. oh well... i wish theyd realize that going on the internet is helping me, but that is too much to ask for i guess..."

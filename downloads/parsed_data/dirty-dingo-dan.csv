My name is Daniel Johns. I'm 26 and I hail from the lovely Australia. I grew up with my mum, my dad, and my younger brother and sister and with my best friends, Chris and Ben. 

From the very beginning, I knew I wanted to make music. <lj-cut text=""Yes kids, I was your age once, too."">

And an ugly 16 I was, too. I played in little bands with my friends off an on, and still write my own music to this day. By 16, I knew I wanted to teach music to others, sharing the joy and peace I'd found. I would have achieved this sooner, but, unfortn=uantely, I ran into a few setbacks.

Around the age of 18, I began suffering from <lj-cut text=""anorexia."">

I'm not ashamed to admit that I was sick. I <i>am</i>, however, ashamed of the fact that I denied it for so long. I seriously believed that I was in control of the process, but I realized I wasn't. I finally recovered at the age of 24, but not without consequences. I developed unbelievable painful ulcers. My asthma became more active. Starving myself had caused havok to my immune system and I was often sick with different viruses. One of these viruses, combined with my already weakened immune system, lead to a condition called Reactive Arthritis. I spent nearly a whole year in a wheel chair, unable to walk, barely even to sit up. The pain was unbearable and at many points, I'd hoped to just keel over already. But with the help of my family, friends, and the best doctor's I could find, I've made a near full <lj-cut text=""recovery."">

I'm still on anti-inflamitory medications and I occasionally need a cane, but other than that. I'm perfectly fine. I'm able to play guitar and piano again, and most of all, I cam play with my baby, <lj-cut text=""Sweep.""> <img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v346/super_cyrus/Hot%20men/Daniel/sweep1.jpg"" alt=""Image hosted by Photobucket.com""> </lj-cut>

Well, that's about it, I guess. I look forward to meeting all of you and enjoying your talents.

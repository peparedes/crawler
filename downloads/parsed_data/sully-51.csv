"event","...to a dear and loving friend, one who stayed with me through elementary school, junior high, high school, and now 3 years of college. He was at many times my only friend. Buddy, you will be sorely missed, never forgotten, you are irreplaceable in my life and in my heart. Goodbye, old friend.

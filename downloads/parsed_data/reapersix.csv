"event","Well its 2:06 and i really don't mind all that much.

Main event of today was being in town and then going to work.

Came back home and my P.C was broken but it appears to be fixed. Lets hope it stays like this.

I'm talking to Erin, shes so cool, but she lives in Canada :(. Shes ace, and i'm staying up until crazy times in the morning to talk to her lol. But its definately worth it, she found my secret smile.

I haven't really eaten much today, can't seem to force it down. Its strange. I ate a lot earlier though so that may be it. I've drunk almost two litres of coke since about 9 though, i'm impressed with that.

Erin is going now, so i think i'm going to aswell, although i may just stay up all night and get really black eyes for the photoshoot tomorrow, that looks pretty sexy in my opinion lol.

I bought new boxers especially for the photoshoot thingy with Fallon, and i have to wear my black cords, and my boxers and my converse, nothing on top lol, apart from my cross. Will hopefully be sexy, i hope they will. And i'm gonna get some pics of Fallon looking pretty aswell so i can edit them and get some new stuff on D.A.

I was also reading some of my early stuff on D.A and found the piece that i wrote about Sebastion out of Cruel Intentions, it reminded me of things and it showed me how much i've changed just in the last 7 or 8 months. So i re-wrote it and changed most of it around to show how much i've changed.

I have a new t-shirt, its yellow lol, but it has Lost Prophets on it so its good.

I realised today, everyone will be leaving or moving away, or doing their own thing next year, including me. Some of my friends are going to college and i'll still see them a lot which i'm greatful for, and some are staying where they are so i'll see them less, but hopefully some. And then some of my older friends are going to be getting full-time jobs or going away to University so i'll hardly see them. All that scares me, because this means i'll have to do my own thing again, and make new friends and get settled again. All this life is about is getting settled and then shuffled and then settled again.

And Erin has been gone for about ten minutes and i already kinda miss her, this is strange i know she lives in Canada so i shouldn't be feeling like this, but i really do like talking to her a lot, and i just wish she lived closer than Canada lol. But she has my secret smile and i got hers so thats ok i guess.

Its now 2:21 lol, and i'm still not really finished, all this is, is randomness thats been building lately and because i haven;t updated for a while its resulting in a really super long entry.

Apologies.

Anyway, yeah, i'm going to The Mill today (Its Sunday morning technically). That should be ace, The December Fall are playing and i hear they are pretty good, and there are lots of people going to so it should be pretty fun. Then Notts on Wednesday with Fallon if i can get out of school anyways. We're gonna sit in the square with my camera and take pics of pretty people.

Thats really all i have planned for next week, lots of work and editing of photos probably on the agenda too.

Then Next Monday i should be having my hair coloured black and red, wOOt. And then that Friday its the last day of school, again, this will be twice now lol. And i've been invited into town by some friends that i haven't seen or spoken to that much so this Saturday coming i may go into Notts and buy a new shirt and some new trousers just for that *hints at group trip*.

No-one will still be reading by this point lol, this is really really long.

Still sorry.

I'll stop it here, i could go on for a lot longer, but i'll refrain now.

Hope everyone is good.

Love Danny XxxXxxX"

In short terms thats life at the moment, its not as bad as it sounds, i'm not ill anymore, which is good, i'm just uber bored right now, when i would have been snuggling Lisa or laying in bed with her, its going to be hard getting over her.

Really hard.

No-one will read this so i'll end it now.

If anyone does read, how are you?

"event","Hello everyone, sorry i haven't updated for a while. It's been pretty weird lately.

Firstly Christmas, it was cool, i spent it in Clipstone and it actually wasn't that bad for once. I think my Mum must have been smoking weed or something because she was pretty mellow. But it was cool.

Then on the Saturday it was the BOTB Final at The Mill and it was pretty poo band wise, the only decent band were Monkey Fist and they came second again!!!! Stupid judges, it had to be fixed.
Then that night Lisa came, it was only as friends, but i that night something just clicked inside me and i realised how much i liked her. This led to me finishing it with Alice. Which didn't go down too well. Nothing against Alice, she was and still is a great lass, but i just felt differently about Lisa, something felt better. It's hard to explain. Anywho, it resulted in Charli (Alice's best friend and proffesional bitch) slapping me round the face. It didn't hurt but it's safe to say i was pretty pissed off. This went away by the end of the night though.

Me and Lisa then got together on Monday after she finished her boyfriend. Which i felt kinda bad about, but supposedly it was coming so :). And i've spent most of the week with Lisa. It's been so great, i missed having her in my life when she left school. But shes back again so yaya.

New Years Eve was fun until i kinda had a little too much to drink. I went to meet Lisa from her best friends, Charlotte, house and Charlotte's Brother was there, who was playing guitar. And supposedly i insulted him, but i don't remember so hehe, i feel kinda silly though.
Then i slept through 12 o clock and wouldn't get up. Which is pretty good because usually i'm unconcious, but this time i was sleeping :). Fil was wrecked beyond belief and almost had to go to the hospital lol.

Then last night a few of us went up to Fils again, finished off some beer and watched one of my new favorite movies ""Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back"". That is one of the funniest films in exsistence ""Snoogins"".

Well thats pretty much it i guess, it a lot but meh, thats life. It's been a cool week, hope everyone is good and i hope you all have a good new year, i'll try and update more often lol."

LOTR ruled, Legolas is the MAN. He kicked some major butt, and looked good whilst doing it lol.

I should be at school, but i have Media homework to hand in and i don't even have the question nevermind the answer. So my plan is to get the question from Matt in my next lesson which is a free, do a quick 4-5 side answer in that hour then hand it in ASAP, and tell her i was at the doctors or something lol.

I got 6 new albums too, wooo!!!!.

Chillis - Greatest Hits
Static-X- Shadow Zone (rocks)
HIM- Love Metal (Ambers Chrimbo Present)
Limp Bizkit - Whatever Its Called ( i only wanted it for Behind Blue Eyes, So Pwetty.)
Muse- Absolution (Figured i'd see what it was like)
Funeral For A Friend- Casually Dressed And Deep In Converstaion (Rocks A LOT!!!!)

Well thats all i can think of to write about. It's the stay awake tonight also, which will suck because i'm knackered and if i fall asleep i'll get ass raped or something. But the risks we take i guess.

I'll update soon, maybe lol."

"event","Well i didn't updae last night when i said i would, mainly because i forgot but i was also quite tired so meh.

I'm cool at the moment. I went in the Monkey Fist pit for two songs last night and i now have a nice lump just above my eye :). Chicks dig battle scars lol. School was alright a little boring but hey wahts new?

I'm just awaiting my dinner, then i'm going for a bath and i'm gonna wash my hair and hopefully have time to get it straightened.

I still don't have my bag :(, it wasn't at the pub where i left it so i'm hoping someone from work picked it up, fingers crossed because it had all my media work from this year in and also my C.D player which i'm really missing. I shall soon find out i guess because i'm at work at six.

I also have a histiry essay to do for Wednesday and i'm at work everyday this week except for Thursday and Sunday. I don't have time to do it tonight due to hygene reasons, and i'm meeting Ally tomorrow, so looks like i'm rushing it on Wednesday in my free period :).

Ally is cool at the moment, a little confusing at times but she is cool. About 9 year 9's fancy me lol, i remember what having crushes was like lol. Bless em. And supposedly a girl from my year (Upper Sixth) who left in year 11 that i really liked but never got with because she had a boyfriend is coming into school tomorrow to see me. :S. Supposedly she misses me and she came to see the play last week, now she wants to see me more, i don't think she means in anything other than a friend way, but what if she does. :S. Will be a little awkward because shes really cool, but i go out with Ally and i did really like this girl. We shall see tomorrow i guess.

Thats it for now, i need food (Pasta Bake and Sausages :)).

I'll update tomorrow probably, this is actually quite cool, i thought it would be silly but it's easy to write down feelings than talk about them, i dunno lol.

"event","Well last night i went to work and then went to the work Christmas party afterwards. I wish i hadn't.

I got very drunk, i didn't do anything stupid or anything but i feel really ill now. I've drank a lot before but it never affected me like this before. I lost my hat, i left my bag at the pub so i have to go back later and hope that it's still there and no-ones stolen anything. I had my C.D player in there and all my A-Level work for this year :(.

I get to see Ally later though so thats cool, i have to walk into town though, and i feel like poo. It's all moaning today really thats all i feel like doing.

I woke up at about 8, after going to bed at 3.30, then i checked some stuff on D.A and went back to bed lol. I got up again at about 12.30 and just decided to make this account because everyone had been talking about this place and i wanted to see what all the fuss was about.

Lifes pretty cool at the moment on a whole though. I got a cold from the walk home last night and i need to learn good money managment and have my bank card taken off of me so i can't spend my wages on alchohol. I'll apologise to any of my friends who i was supposed to be buying presents for, if i don't get them before christmas i shall definately get you extra special ones after because you guys rule (Fil, Emilja, Dani 5, Krun, Laura, Jess not in any perticular order).

So yeah, i have a cold, i lost my hat, i feel like i'm gonna barf, i have not much money left (thankfully enough to pay for the cinema on Thursday ""LOTR 3"" Wooooooooooo) but apart from that  i'm good, christmas is nearly here, usually not a good thing but i am aquiring a digital camera this year so i am looking forward to that :). I get to see Ally and my friends tonight and i'm eating weetabix, lol. I'll update again after battle of the bands :)."

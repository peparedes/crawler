"event","I had the most epic experience today. So I was at work, riverwalk stadium. For those of you who dont know i work for the montgomery biscuits. I dont know if this is standard practice at baseball stadiums everywhere, but we have a tarp that we use to cover the field in case of rain. This sounds like a good idea, except for the part where the warehouse staff gets called in to pull said tarp. Normally how this works is someone looks at the weather ( i guess we have people who do that) and determines its gonna rain. So we get called to the field and usually wait another 10-20 mins until we actually pull the tarp. Then, since the administration at the biscuits only cares about making money, once someone thinks the rain is gonna stop we uncover the field. Then it starts raining and we repeat the process. Its a pain in the ass and just stupid, but thats how it usually works.<br /><br />Tonight was different.<br />We pulled the tarp, and kept it down there. It was one hell of a storm. Still is as i'm writing this. Then there's the stupid game they play with how long to postpone the game. If it only rains for 20 mins, then they're gonna play the damn game. Games start at 7:05. So unless it rains past 8:00, the game is on. Tonight was different. It stopped raining around 7:30, but the wind, thunder, and lightening was constant. So there I am, sitting in the warehouse, dreading the moment i'm called to pull the tarp and uncover the field. All of a sudden, it starts pouring again. Now i'm thinking ""hell yeah, no way there gonna play tonight. now i just have to wait for them to call the game"". So i wont bore you with those details. The game is canceled and we take care of everything. Then i leave, and things get interesting.<br /><br />Its still raining pretty damn hard as i leave the stadium. There are some of the players leaving as i do. I couldn't believe it, they were running to their bus as if they were gonna melt. I guess thats why they're only in the minor league. I'm just casually walking through the downpour. I've been soaked before, no big deal. The only thing I was worried about was my phone. So i get to my car and am faced with the task of driving through this maelstrom.&nbsp; I could hardly see anything, and have pretty shitty windshield wipers. I had this truly epic music playing. I just got it today, so i had no idea what to expect. It was Bobby Previte, the album's called The Coalition of the Willing. I can't even begin to classify this music into a genre, so you will have to suffice with knowing it was epic. The specific track i was listening to when i first started my journey was the 4th, The Ministry Of Love, which i know recognize as a 1984 reference. Now i think its even more badass!!! Anyways, this shit was hardcore. It put me into a very strange state of mind, Instead of being scared shitless of driving through this horrible storm, or worried about not being able to see, i had some strange sense of excitement. It was like a trance of sorts, I was jamming with the music and thinking ""i should be freaking out, but i'm not"". The sky was pitch black, with flashes of lightening every 5 seconds. Some of the lights along the interstate were off, and a strip of fast food places off of an exit were pitch black, without power. The whole situation was quite epic, it was an intense journey thanks to that music. I wonder if i can upload it here, that would help this make more sense.<br /><br />Well anyways, i got home safely, and had to write this.<br /><br />----------------<br />Now playing: <a title=""'Bobby Previte - The Ministry Of Love' - open on FoxyTunes Planet"" href=""http://www.foxytunes.com/artist/bobby previte/track/the ministry of love"">Bobby Previte - The Ministry Of Love</a><br /><span style=""color: rgb(153, 153, 153); font-style: italic; font-size: 10px;"">via <a title=""FoxyTunes - Web of music at your fingertips"" href=""http://www.foxytunes.com/signatunes/"" style=""color: rgb(102, 102, 102);"">FoxyTunes</a></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"

Tonight something wonderful happened. I got the opportunity to play with a jazz quartet. My friend Joel has this quartet and they were playing downtown. So I come to listen, but brought my sax just in case. They happen to ask me to play with them once they hear I brought my sax. This is where the fun begins.
 
 At first I sat out on some tunes because I didn't know them. I took the occasional solo and tried to add to the overall sound. But in the second set I played, I was a bit more bold. I played on unfamiliar tunes, and at times played some downright stupid stuff. And it was cool. They said I did well, and there's a chance I will be playing with them on a regular basis.
 
 It had always bothered me that I wanted to be a performer for a living, but never had played at a true gig. I had no idea where to start. Tonight just happened randomly, but I see it as an opportunity from God. It just so happened that the day after I get back from college my friend is playing a gig in town. The whole experience felt great and I can definitely see myself doing more of this in the future. Tonight gave me some serious motivation, and kind of validated what I'm trying to do at college, and with my life."

"event","I've been thinking of my future alot recently. Thinking about actually surviving as a professional musician. Thinking about what it takes to get there. That question is easy; practice. Which leads me to a conflict. I see all these badass players in the music school, and I know that I can be just as good as them if I practice enough. So to a normal person its a no brainer. Just practice your ass off.

But there are other things in my brain too. I like playing video games. I am currently picking parts for a new gaming pc. But I wonder if I will actually have time to play it once I get serious about music. And why aren't I serious about music now you ask? Not sure. I have a major lack of discipline. Its extremely hard for me to convince myself to practice. I know that I have to practice, but it takes such a monumental effort to get me into the practice room...

I see my friends, and they're serious about music. They can talk for hours about a specific artist, his style, the way he hits a snare drum, all sorts of crazy shit. I want to be like that. But I don't want to give up video games. I wonder if a balance between the two is possible. Why don't I spend all those hours looking at technology reviews and articles looking up music info, gaining knowledge on the market for professional musicians? Are my priorities totally fucked up? I'm worried. About myself. If I truly devote myself to music, which I want to, will I remain myself? If not, will I like this new James? Will my friends like him? Or if i don't... if I simply continue my musical training as I am.... what will become of me? Well for one Noffsinger will kick me out of the studio. Am I seriously going to be living in a cardboard box? There are just so many things on my mind. I've grown very good at ignoring them or distracting myself from them. When will I face the facts?

I'm not sure if I can make a commitment to a life of music. Take that back. I know I can. I don't know if I'm willing to..."

"event","Okay. The state of my life has changed dramatically since the last post. I am now in college. Myspace now sucks, and xanga is non-existent. Facebook has turned gay because of all the 3rd party apps. And so i return to livejournal, to post my reflections on college life, and that which accompanies it.

I'm doing laundry now. This is the first time i have done so ever. I think i turned all my underwear and socks pink. I washed them with some red boxers. Oh well. Could have been worse.

I've met lots of new people, but have noticed something interesting. In this new, more mature environment, i have found naive, less mature people. This is not true for all of my new friends, but it definitely applies to a few of them. This is a place where my teachers curse and my friends get offended when i do so. weird.

So anyways... thats all for now."

"event","Well, my journey to Chicago is complete. It was a great trip. I went with my church youth group to the Archbishop James P. Lyke Conference. Don't worry if this makes no sense, its a catholic thing.

Anyways... I learned quite a bit, about myself, others, and my relationship with God. But I got very little from the conference itself. I now have a better understanding of the relationship between secular and sacred music, and have a found a new outlook on my seemingly hopeless relationship with the opposite sex.

Speaking of the opposite sex, I observed many situations that lead me to believe that the saying about girls maturing faster than boys isn't always true. Of course there was drama, but this years drama was so much more messier, and so much closer to me. My sister was one of the key people involved. I have always had faith in my sister. I know that for the most part, I don't have to worry about her doing stupid, adolescent shit. She has more common sense than me, and has been above influence and peer pressure, for the most part. So this is why i was so shocked when i heard what she did.

Basically, she let two girls into her room, and the two girls then proceded to pour fruity pebbles on the floor and otherwise trash the room. Then they called the front desk to get somebody to clean it up. Now, to me it doesnt matter whether they trashed the room on purpose or not. I was just concerned about my sister. So the whole situation gets blown up to some ridiculous degree, and I don't really wanna talk about it anymore.

So i found the best restaurant in the world, Bubba Gump's Shrimp. It's sooooo good, you might get a heart attack. Not from the taste, but from the sheer state of bliss your food will put you in, simply because said food exists.

And, as a final note to the wise.........
Monster Khaos + Absolut = :)"

"event","So... I was on zelda road going to starbucks cause my sister wanted starbucks. I was in the left lane, when suddenly out of nowhere this old ford ranger slams into my Cougar! The driver was some young girl with her son. I was really mad, but then I noticed the girl was horrified. My sister was trembling because the truck hit my Cougar on her side. She called my mom, and I got out to check the damage. My right headlight is busted open, and my right side mirror is hanging by a cable. My bumper is dented too. But the truck wouldn't even start. So i guess i was lucky. The girl that hit me was really scared, so I couldn't stay mad at her. Her son was just fine. She didn't look much older than me. So anyways... i call the police and we take care of all the business. The worst part was when one of the guys from Krystal (cause the girl just came from the drive through) gives the girl and her son some fries and krystal burgers..... and I didn't get any!

So anyways.... my life truly sucks. This has been an interesting summer so far. I am seeing a pattern. First a girl (who will remain unnamed) dumps me for another guy (that i don't know) and tells me that I am the worst guy she ever kissed. Then a girl (whose name I don't know) slams into my Cougar. If this keeps up, by the end of the summer, some girl is gonna burst through my window when I am sleeping and chop my balls off with a butter knife!

I think this is a sign from God..."

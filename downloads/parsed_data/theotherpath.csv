"event","so i had a cold that lasted FOREVER but now i'm all better.  thank god for my 300+ dvd collection. 

No woman no cry :(  things aren't working out with my ex. She won't be honest with me about how she dosen't want to get back together.  and i'm tired of always being the one to call. if she would have just said ""i don't want to get back together"" i would have no problem with it.  it's no big deal. but to not say anything and leave me hanging every time we make plans just pisses me off. so whatever. back on the open market WOOHOO! 

my shirt has a spot on it.  i didn't notice till i got to work.  ain't that a bitch?

still nothing to do at work. hence my long entry. i even made a myspace account cause i have so much free time.  blah blah blah.  petey needs friends :)

well that's all for now.  i'm sure i'll update again later"

"event","well another year gone and another ahead. of course nothing really changes. well, almost nothing.  i've decided to quit smoking. hopefully it will save me some money.  plus my lungs should stop hurting, so that'll be a plus. i'm gonna try doing it cold turkey, cause all those things like the patch and the gum are fucking expensive. can't save money if i'm spending 60+ dollars on gum. so i should turn into a raging animal in a couple of days. at least, thats what happened last time i tried to quit.

christmas was nice. i really don't celebrate it much as i am an atheist, but my family bought me gifts so i bought them gifts. my brothers came up from virginia so it was good to see them again.

new years was fun.  went to a party where i saw a bunch of old friends i haven't seen in a long time.  drank until 4:30 am. beer, shots of jack, and sangria... ahhh what a lovely combo. i kept the party going on new years day as well.  was the last day of vacation so what the hell.  i'll take my partying when i can get it. 

might have a date on friday. trying to work out the details. keeping fingers crossed.

back at work, with nothing to do again. it's gonna be real slow until we get closer to the primary in june. so here's to another couple of months of no work to do. 

have really taking a small break from writing over the holidays.  i'll probably start again today. if nothing more than to pass the time. we'll see what happens

see ya"

"event","so it seems that my soon to be married sister has picked a different song to walk down the ilse to at her wedding.  instead of using the traditional wedding march, she's walking to a leonard cohen song.  it just so happens that the song is my favorite song and happens to be tattooed on my leg.  my sis and i hate each other and i'm not going to the wedding.  but it still bothers me.  it seems everything she does has something to do with me, advertantly or not.  i'm kinda pissed because i have been a fan of the song since 1994 when it came out and i guarantee that anna heard it on the shrek soundtrack.  i'll also bet that anna doesn't know the true meaning of the song, she just likes how it sounds.  i'm kinda pissed about it, but whatever. i know its a coincidence. it just figers"

"event","finally they brought back my favorite comedy special/telethon: Comic Relief.  i made it a point to stay in Saturday night and watch hours and hours of it. it was great.  some comedians were great, others bombed.  but it was all in the name of charity.  this year they raised money for hurricane Katrina victims.  usually it was a benefit for the homeless. anyway, i made a donation.  a donation of more money than i ever thought i would give away. but it felt good.  its not that i'm a cheap-ass, it's just that i really don't have extra money to throw around. but i'll probably get a tee-shirt or something.  woo hoo! the website is still taking donations, if anyone wants to help.  it's:

like i said it's a great cause and they need all the help they can get to help re-build New Orleans.

m meds are working pretty good. we up'ed my antidepressants and i seem to be on a good level. can't really complain, which is very good for me.  i'm a big complainer.  one of the first things i have to do when i move to VA is (besides finding a job) finding a psychiatrist. gotta stay on my meds.  i know that if i ever stop taking them, i will be doomed.  the biggets mistake any mentally ill person can make is to stop taking their meds. i'm better because of them, not ""so good i don't need them."" it doesn't work that way.

man i can't wait to move outta jersey.  i really do hate it here.  i can't wait for the calmness and slow pace of virginia.  i can't thank my brother and his wife for the opportunity.

HUNTING!  SATISFYING MY URGE TO KILL!  it's not that i don't like animals, i do. well, some animals.  my theory is, if an animal is dumb enough to get shot, then it deserves to be eaten. so for all you anti hunters out there, beware. i'm coming with gun blazing.  we'll see what the body count is. the land i'm looking at should be near water, or rather, it had BETTER be by water.  i want to walk out of my house and be fishing within minutes.  that way i can do it every day :) fish hunt kill, a pirates life for me.

work is still crazy. only 3 weeks till the election.  i fucking tired! i actually come home exhaused from work, which is something i haven't felt in years. but in a month it will be over.  finally.  i'll be gladwhen it's a'll done, cause i'll be closer to virginia.  i ran into an old friend last night.  she was working at the banquit hall where we were having a meeting. anyway, she walks in and in front of my boss goes ""so you're moving to virginia, huh!"" i guess my parents told her parents.  so the cats out of the bag, even though my boss hasn't mentioned anything. it was a big ""Doe!"" moment that even Homerwould be proud of.  ok, this wasted 10 minutes of my day.  only 50 more to go.

"event","i am sick and fucking tired of driving in New jersey.  i'm fucking tired of the bullshit, the 3 lane change, the illegal u-turns and the fucking tourists.  i'm sick of having to stop short  cause some asshole wants to look out his window at an accident.  i fucking hate it here.  i can't wait to leave. everyday i see at least to ""possible accidents"" narrowly avoided.  i think i'm gonna put big spikes on my bumper and just start ramming people.  i fucking hate jersey. i hate the people and i hate their bullshit. it's no wonder our auto insurance is the highest in the country.  and we're the most densely populated state in the fucking country.

fuck america fuck new jersey and fuck you.

i'm tired of starting out my day like this everyday because of incopitence.  thanks for listening to me vent.  i feel better :P"

well, the last week has been pretty good. The Geodon that i'm on is starting to help.  the only side effects are blurry vision and tremers.  yeah!  i love how ever pill that helps has to fuck you up to do it.  oh well.  better than nothing.

Worked in the studio a lot last week. me and jay and chris wrote 2 new songs.  i don't know why i keep writing with them, since i'm leaving the band as soon as the house sells, but oh well.  i love writing too much. found it hard to stop.

fell asleep on time last night, which is crazy if you know me.  the unfortunate part was i was awake at 6:30, instead of 8.  whatcha gonna do

alright, back to work

"event","went out last night with everyone from work.   had bowling night, which was actually fun.  i definatly shouldn't have drank though. i know it's one of the worst things i can do while unstable. but for 2 hours it was fun.  of course, when i got home i felt alone and like shit again.

dreamt of killing my dog again.  makes no sense to me. i love her to death and she's the best dog i've ever had. but the violence i have under the surface comes out in my dreams, if not in reality. so i sacrifice 1 for the other.  i'd rather have violent nightmares than be violent in life.  especially since i've had such a problem with my violence in the past. but so what?  who cares, if you feel the same way after either a real fight or a dream fight.  found a mark one my hand again.  that means i've been punching in my sleep again.  

raise your hand if you hit things while sleeping... oh it's just me... ok, nevermind. ok, enough pity.  back to work"

"event","so i'm off lithium now, finally. the shit kept giving me stomache pains and sickness.  plus it didn't help anything. On a new med now, but i'm still getting sick.  hopefully it's just the Lith. leaving my system. i feel a little better, considering. i haven't cried in a few days, which is good news. i still feel depressed though. i feel like i'm a waste. oh well.

i just read about some kid with Hodgkins disease who doesn't want to undergo kemotherepy anymore.  he's being sued by the state.  figures.  for a country that boasts about ""freedom"" so much, it's no shock to me that the government is telling him what to do with his own body. god i fucking hate it here."

"event","OK, this is getting really rediculas. if i could get one night of sleep that actually FELT like sleep. i would stop bitching for at least a day. My dreams are all nightmares, usually involving some kind of violece.  First i kill 6 people in the street (remember, its a dream) in another one i stabbed my dog to death. then last nights, i wrapped my fingers around my sisters neck and started squeezing, hard. The violence in my dreams is so vivid and real that i actually throw punches in my sleep.  i almost broke 3 knuckles in my hand about 3 weeks ago and they still fucking hurt!  maybe i should check mysef in.  my only fear in life is that i will one day kill for real, and probably over nothing. 

the forth of july came and went. i'm glad it's gone.  i fucking HATE this country almost as much as life.  the 4th is just a day to hang your flags out the windows and drink and be merry, and then take the flags down a week later. a time when we celebrate the birth of this country, by slave owners who wanted to be free. yeah, what wonderful pride.  i need to rob a bank so i can afford to move out of this shithole. Fuck Bush, Fuck America and Fuck You."

"event","another weekend gone by and im still feeling shitty.  Jimi came home from Buffalo and we hung out all weekend.  it was great seeing him again. 

my stomache is really becoming a problem. i'm getting sick almost every day.  i got sick 2 already today and it's barely 9:30.  i'll have to talk to my doctor about it.

turns out i really enjoy world cup soccer. i love all sports, pretty much, but the world cup this year has been really good. GO ITALY!  it was great watching the american team SUCK and get kicked out. They only scored 1 goal the entire tournament.

oh well, i'm sure i'll update later

untill then...

P.S.  This girl is amazing.  i must have her

"event","well i'm back at work again after taking the last half of last week off. this week i'm on 1/2 days till the new meds kick in.  i'm feeling pretty sick today, probably just my body adjusting. i'm still getting twitches, which i hate, but oh well.  whatever makes me feel better.  don't really care about side affects right now.  

Fridays rehearsal was better.  not great, but better.  Chris still needs a lot of work on his vocals.  we just need him to stop ""preforming"" and just sing, the way we recorded the demo's.  when we play live he just screams and yells.  if something doesn't change, i don't know how much longer i'll be in this band.  i would like to play out and we have enough hook-ups to get a few gigs, but it would be too embarrassing to preform right now.  we're nowhere near ready (vocals)

had to come to work early today to set up for photography.  can't believe i made it in on time.  didn't get much sleep last night (shocker)

oh well, until then..."

my dreams continue to scare me, to the point where i'm afraid to sleep. the other day i had a dream so violent that in my sleep in punched the coffee table, hurting my hand pretty bad. life really sucks when you can hurt yourself from sleeping. i can't even flick a cigerette now.  practice is friday, so this better get better. 

called the doctor again. gotta find a way to not cry at work. i'm too depressed to think anymore. my mind never shuts off or slows down.  and when i sleep it seems to go faster. damn you seritonin! why won't my brain produce you? it's hard coming to grips with this handicap. everyone tells me it'll get better, even though they know it's only wishful thinking. i'm really afraid one day i'm going to hurt someone, seriously. i have a problem, and i feel like i'm futally searching for the answer. oh well, untill then..."

looks like i'm back in the band, for now. that's cool (was planning on moving, but that fell through.) the only thing i'm worried about is my lead singer who won't take direction or lessons. ain't that a bitch. wants to be a rock star, won't do anything to get better. weird.

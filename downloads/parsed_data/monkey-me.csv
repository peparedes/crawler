I can only imagine
What it will be like
When I walk
By Your side
I can only imagine
What my eyes will see
When Your face
Is before me
I can only imagine 

{Chorus}:
Surrounded by Your glory, what will my heart feel
Will I dance for You Jesus or in awe of You be still
Will I stand in Your presence or to my knees will I fall
Will I sing hallelujah, will I be able to speak at all
I can only imagine

I can only imagine
When that day comes
And I find myself
Standing in the Son
I can only imagine
When all I will do
Is forever
Forever worship You
I can only imagine

-No Diggity-


You know what
I like the playettes
No diggity, no doubt
Play on playette
Play on playette
Yo Dre, drop the verse

[Dr. Dre]
It's going down, fade to Blackstreet
The homies got RB, collab' creations
Bump like Acne, no doubt
I put it down, never slouch
As long as my credit can vouch
A dog couldn't catch me ass out
Tell me who can stop when Dre making moves
Attracting honeys like a magnet
Giving em eargasms with my mellow accent
Still moving this flavour
With the homies Blackstreet and Teddy
The original rump shakers

Shorty in down, good Lord
Baby got em up open all over town
Strictly biz, she don't play around
Cover much ground, got game by the pound
Getting paid is a forte
Each and every day, true player way
I can't get her out of my mind
(what)
I think about the girl all the time

East side to the west side
Pushing phat rides, it's no surprise
She got tricks in the stash
Stacking up the cash
Fast when it comes to the gas
By no means average
As long as she's got to have it
Baby, you're a perfect ten, I wanna get in
Can I get down, so I can win

[1] - I like the way you work it
No diggity, I try to bag it up, bag it up
[Repeat 1 (3x)]

She's got class and style
She's managed by the town,
Baby never act wild
Very low key on the profile
Catching catichin' vilians is a no,
Let me tell you how it goes
Curve's the words, spin's the verbs 
Lovers it curves so freak what you heard
Rolin' with the phatness
You don't even know what the half is
You gotta pay to play
Just for shorty, bang-bang, to look your way
I like the way you work it
Trumped tight, all day, every day
You're blowing my mind, maybe in time
Baby, I can get you in my ride

[Repeat 1 (4x)]

[2] - Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo
Hey yo, that girl looks good
Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo
Play on, play on playette
Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo
You're my kind of girl, no diggity
Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo
Hey

[Queen Pen]
Cause thats my peeps and we row G
Flying first class from New York City to Blackstreet
What you know about me, not a motherf.. thing
Cartier wooded frames sported by my shortie
As for me, icy gleaming pinky diamond ring
We be's the baddest clique up on the scene
Ain't you getting bored with these fake ass broads
I shows and proves, no doubt, I be takin you, so
Please excuse, if I come across rude
That's just me and that's how the playettes got to be
Stay kicking game with a capital G
Axe the peoples on my block, I'm as real as can be
Word is bond, faking jacks never been my flava
So, Teddy, pass the word to your nigga Chauncy
I be sitting in car, let's say around 3:30
Queen Pen and Blackstreet, it's no diggity
[Repeat 1 (4x)]

"event","So, this week has not been exciting at all. I don't think i've ever said ""i hate school"" that many times in one week. Finals are this week and oh gosh, i'm scurred! i also really need to find some new friends because they seriously embarass me. They fall down stairs, say ""hey baby"" to hot seniors, and then have a weird thing with L.A.M
It's crazy! The highlight of my week was probably seeing Chicago. I would do anything to be able to sing and dance around half naked. The half naked part really excites me, fo sho! This one time, i had a really long nail...Bryan took me to Jamba and that was fun, except he seems to have a weird infatuation with TARZAN...maybe its the loin cloth?  I'm happy he came down and did some bondage. Good times. I'm going to be really happy when this semester is over, chad is back, and i can start saying ""i love school""

since everyone is sick or injured or something (and not at the dance) i am home.  i went to dinner with my family and got really annoyed.  i dont know why, i just did. out of nowhere i really didnt want to be there.  i hate it when that happens.  
since i dont want to snap at them, im trying to stay away which is why they are next door and i am home taking emo pictures of my dogs..

this was a tough week. i was just sooo tired for some reason. and so i would come home and my mom would freak out about ""what's wrong, did you have a bad day, are you okay?"" i mean it's nice that she's asking but i really am just tired. the people on soph...oh how jealous i am. i wish i could have gone again. :)  ya'll were missed too*

I love drama so much. there really is nothing like putting on a show. the rush you get onstage and the (for lack of a better word..) drama that goes on backstage. despite some technical difficulties it went very well.  
bryan came to visit! that made me happy. :)
on friday after the show, me, colleen, bryan, arielle, and derek went to denny's and memorable times were had...
""who's jerry?"" lol
""there are always people and they are always looking!""
 yeah then back to my casa for some sleep.
the next day we had to be there at 3. derek was right..i was tired. so me, colleen, arielle and robert went and got starbucks. it smelled like christmas in thurr. i liked it!
(38 DAYS TIL CHRISTMAS)
back to school for warm-ups and then curtain!
once again, i love doing shows!
and today i went to jessica's house for a project and then shopped with my mom for a bit.
i got most of my christmas shopping done so yeah. that was good.

"event","man this fire is really scarey...they told us to be prepared for evacuation.  no school tomorrow, everyone's like ""yay!""...but dont they understand the circumstances...to me, school being cancelled makes it even scarier. wow. it seems like it wasnt real until today, when in between classes everyone would stop to look toward the smoke to see who's house is burning down. wow."

Hey Tracy, my mom is hosting a platter party up on North Avenue. Wanna ""check it out""? 

PENNY 
May i also ""check it out? 

SEAWEED 
Oh, you surely may! 

TRACY 
I've never been to North Avenue! 

LINK 
Ya think it'll be all right for, you know... us? 

SEAWEED 
It's cool, cracker boy! 

PENNY 
Being invited places by colored people! 

TRACY 
It feels so hip! 

SEAWEED 
I'm glad you feel that way, friends, 'cause not everybody does. 

I can't see 
Why people look at me 
And only see the color of my face 

And then there's those 
That try to help, god knows 
But have to always put me in my place 

Now i won't ask you to be color blind 
'Cause if you pick the fruit 
Then girl, you're sure to find... 

The blacker the berry 
The sweeter the juice 
I could say it ain't so 
But darlin', what's the use? 

The darker the chocolate 
The richer the taste 
And that's where it's at... 
...now run and tell that!! 

ENSEMBLE 
Run and tell that! 

SEAWEED 
Run and tell that! 

ENSEMBLE 
Run and tell that! 

SEAWEED (& ENSEMBLE) 
I can't see 
Why people disagree 
Each time i tell them what i know is true 

And if you come 
And see the world i'm from 
1 bet your heart is gonna feel it too 

Yeah. I could lie 
But baby. Let's be bold 
Vanillajian be nice 
But if the truth be told... 

The blacker the berry 
The sweeter the juice 
I could say it ain't so 
But darlin', what's the use 

The darker the chocolate 
The richer the taste 
That's where it's at

Now run and tell that!!

ENSEMBLE
Run and tell that!

(The scene shifts to Motormouth Maybelle's record shop dance party where her daughter Li'l Inez and her friends are already in full swing.)

LI'L INEZ
Hey, you're Tracy Turnblad! You're my favorite dancer on the Corny Collins Show.

SEAWEED
This is my sister, Li'l Inez.

TRACY
Sure. I saw you at the auditions.

LI'L INEZ
Well, you're the only one who 
did, 'cause they kicked me out 
on my young, gifted and black 
behind.

SEAWEED
Tell 'em about it!

LI'L INEZ
I'm tired of coverin' up all my pride

SEAWEED & ENSEMBLE
So give me five on the black-hand side

LI'L INEZ
I've got a new way of movin' 
And i got my own voice

SEAWEED & ENSEMBLE
So how can i help
But to shout and rejoice

LI'L INEZ
The people 'round here 
Can barely pay their rent 
They're ""try'n to make dollar
Out 'a fifteen cent"" 
But we got a spirit 
Money just cant buy

LI'L INEZ & ENSEMBLE
It's deep as a river 
And soars to the sky!!

SEAWEED & ENSEMBLE
I cant see
The reason it cant be 
The kinda world where we all get our chance

The time is now 
And we can show them how 
To turn the music up and let's all dance

'Cause all things are equal 
When it comes to love 
Well, that ain't quite true 
'Cause when push comes to shove...

The blacker the berry 
The sweeter the juice 
I could say it ain't so

But darlin', what's the use 
The darker the chocolate 
The richer the taste 
That's where it's at

SEAWEED
...Now run and tell that!!

ENSEMBLE
Run and tell that!

SEAWEED
Run and tell that!!"

"event","retreat..::sigh::
i dont know what i can say and what i can't say about it (i dont wanna ruin it for those of you who havent gone on it yet).  but i feel awesome!
i feel so much closer to my friends. i feel i know alot more about who i am. and i feel closer to God (yep i said it).
to me, soph is something that completely depends on you: if you go to escape from pressures of home/school/family life..you are enabled to do so. but if you come for the experience, you can get that too.
I love you all, i really do!
I'm such a dork..im probably the only one walking away with this feeling, but i dont care; i love it!
so this is what they mean by retreat high..
hehe.

"event","on monday, while i was thinking about all kind of crap and bored to death fixing my stupid project, rachel calls me and starts rambling about really random stuff..
10 minutes later the doorbell rings and rachel's there with a big thing of flowers and i was just like ""OH MY GOSSH!!"" it was so sweet, and seriously just what i needed.
then i went to school today and everyone told me they tried calling and stuff but i think there was a phone off the hook. i felt loved.
after school today my mom and i went to best buy and bought my digital camera and then to joan's for my costume fabric. 
i feel like such a  [L]dumbass (lol steph and colin) for being soooo upset one day and then realllly good the next. geez it makes me feel like such a typical teenager..i hate it!
im really excited for soph.. i need it as well
i get to get away from my house (which is still a mess) and just chillax.
i gotta go finish packing.."

"event","i'm never gonna get hyped for my birthday again..i always end up upset or disapointed. yesterday morning a few people told me ""happy birthday"" and i was glad to hear it. but it bothered me was when people who really meant alot to me forgot to say so... and when my mom called my confirmation class saying i wasnt going to go to the day retreat since ""they wanted to spend time with me on my birhtday"" and then proceeded to clean out the house, do the laundry etc. 
i mean i know the world can't stop for my birthday but everyone deserves to do something else than clean their room on their birthday. when my sister came to pick up my nephew, she offered to take me to the mall. i said yes!!! and put on my shoes. we went to kb toys and my nephew got a toy and i took him to the sweet factory and rode on the little ride things. thats when things got a lot better..we went back to Julia's house and chillaxed and her and daniel got ready for dinner. i went online and say megan's away message and it said happy birthday to me~ i felt special! than i look at my phone and it says new voicemail. i listen and it was bryan! he said happy birthday and that was so great! so then i went to cheesecake factory with the fam..o man it was soo good! 
i guess my birthday wasn't that bad..i was expecting way too much.
i kinda wish i had gone on retreat..i could have seen my friends and not be so bored. that was really dumb on my part to stay home. but i thought my mom, dad and i could like go somewhere and do something, but that didn't happen. i even suggested it..
i really should never place any expectations on anything again."

"event","Yesterday after school Stephanie, Devi and I went to the topanga mall for costumage/matching shirts for football gameage.  we didnt have much luck for our wonderful fairy costumes...but we have and idea now.  we went to charlotte rousse and got these shirts..so perfect it was ""buy 1 get 2 free"" that worked out nicely hehe. so then we got patches and letters and stuff and came home and discovered that there were three of us...and only two ""n""s for ""nade"" so i decided i could be ghetto and cut the W and yeah it came out backwards.  its okay..it was ghetto and tight fo shizzle.

Devi brought her backpack to the game(even though she could have picked it up when she dropped me off on the way home) and she looked like a drug dealer...so she made me carry it lol. this was ghetto fabulous as well..

the game was great! We won!! horrrrraaaayy!
tonight me and steph and colin are gonna have our own homecoming. we are so sexy."

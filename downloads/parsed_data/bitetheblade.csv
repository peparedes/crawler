A night in the ER for their 10th anniversery
Dosed up on sweet bliss nitrous
Together, Happy, and deep in Concrete. 
Finally sharing the dreams of endless love...
After all its only a game...
Wake up, Wake up... Baby yeah.
Tonight We'll fall head over heels
In this game you need a pretty box
A pretty girl
And to hell with the rest...
Are you game, or not?"

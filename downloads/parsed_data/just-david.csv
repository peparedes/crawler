Stupid trick, why'd you need to go off and say that?

They were pretty good stuff.

I guess the morning crew thinks I'm a crappy manager... John F's been off telling everybody that I suck cause I haven't been trained because they haven't got around to sending me to school yet. I was tempted to tell that they can't critque the management until they can do their jobs right... Josephina's been off from 15-20 dollars a day every time I check her til.

 So anyways, my accounting class is becoming too tough for me, so I'm busting out with some hidden tequniques... like getting Sundays off from work so I can do that homework with Diana (no she's not part of my drama... Diana {note the 'a' at the end} is old enough to be my mamma ;)

 Can't remember what else I was going to write about. Everybody's going through a lack of sleep so that's nothing worth complaining about. No female trouble or events since I posted last...

 It sucks when you fall for an atheistic girl who has a long distance boyfriend who if she broke up with him you'd never consider picking her up in the fallout.

 It also sucks when one of your friends is in love with you and you need to make sure she dosen't think you're leading her on or recropricating her feelings by spending time with her.

 It really sucks when you don't hear from another friend who you'd change the world for... I was with her when? The Thursday before Disneyland?

 So last night I found another psycho parent. There's Kyle's mom, my Mom, and now one of my employee's Mom. I was talking with her on the phone and she sounded very controlling and nearly tried to pick a fight with me over me saying ""I'll see what I can do"". 
""What does that mean?"" (her)
""That means that I will not make a promise or a guarantee that it'll be done, but I will do my best to see that it happens"" (me)
""Why wouldn't it happen?"" (her, sounding angry and annoyed)
""For all I know I could be hit by a giant rush at 8:45 and I wouldn't be able to let her go until 9:01. Because I don't know the future I don't make promises about it.[at least not at work]"" (she wanted her kid to get off at 9 on the dot... her kid didn't want to go home with the mother)

 I mean shoot, big rush or not, I can think of a dozen little things that could keep someone working a little later... Probably because I've been caught by each of them more than I care to count...

 Oddly enough that was just like a conversation that I'd expect to have with my Mom. Her being frustrated that I'm not sure if I can follow into what she wants and me getting frustrated because she's trying to control me into following her will.

 And now she's making some comments about how I'm controlling her life, as she's giving me a list of stuff to do. How am I doing that? Having a broken car and needing to be picked up from work doesn't cut it. Not washing my Dog? Come on! If I did half of the crap to her that she's doing to me she'd hang herself by her violin strings."

 Life is awesome again, Mom wants to kick me out of the house, but in the meantime I'm paying $100 a week rent, which I can get reduced by finishing a specific list of chores... which I'm paying my brother about $20 to do ;) I will be looking for a room mate at the end of the month... probably an appartment while I'm at it.

 I could move in with Ronda's family... Mom thinks she's my girlfriend, so if I move in with her I'd be living in sin. Problem is that she's not my girlfriend, and in fact, she just paied about $200 to get her lover-boy flown over here from Ohio. I've been so gentmanly with Ronda that her Mom is convinced that I'm a homosexual (I have never even tried and touch her daughter).

 End of the summer's coming, a lot of people are suprised that I haven't hooked up with anybody... I guess I am too, but then again, it isn't like there's a huge demand for boys like David around here anyway. I think that's a good thing, cause there isn't anybody in Tacoma that I really want...

I'm a manager now, I'll have my pay raise on the next check (not this one, the one on the 5th) of course, my boss is majorly ripping me off, but... After I'm running shifts and am compatent at my job I'll quit if I'm making less than $9.16 an hour. If I go to Advanced Shift Management Course the minimum he can pay me is $9.00 an hour, and because I'm going to be a closing manager he needs to pay me aproximatly another 6%.

 So anyways... management... that means that I need to press my uniforms before I go to work. That means ironing... I don't know how to do a good job ironing clothes... so I wait for my Mom and hopefully she'll show me when she comes back home.

My legs are sooo tired though, I've been chasing too many people in games like capture the flag... my team won ;) I also won in the obsticle course... another fatiuge giver.... Why does  everybody around here live so far away from me?

sorry for random comments... I just gotta get some stuff out... I don't expect any of you to actually have a clue about what I'm talking about... Except for Dustin and Jeanette ;) I gotta hang out with Mike, Shauna, Andrew, Jess, Rhonda, and Courtney (both of them)...

A lot of people I'll neglect to mention on purpose; betty, apples, threasea... Dude, I gotta get out of my house and hang out with peoples... But that'll happen when I finish camp. I think I'll try to call one friend a night, but mostly I'll focus on peoples at camp. Relax, let stuff happen--------------------> I'm taking a break... as soon as I finish these books ;) always something else to do... okay, after I finish this stuff Mom wants me to do, maybe if I want I'll do more stuff."

That picks up my GPA to the 3.0 that my Scott made me promise to try for... There's no way I'll be able to get my average up to a level that looks good, but... All A's and B's... I never get A's and B's at TCC, the grades hate me and the classes bore me. I think I need to talk with my teachers about this... Something isn't right. Did somebody bribe them for me? I even got an A- in ASL 2, and we all know how much I suck with my signing. Whoops... this means that my parents will feel justified in their high standards for me in my grades.

 Oh well, it beats the crust off going the other way and lowering my GPA even further :) Maybe now I won't feel academically ashamed around the parents of the ""smart kids""."

After I finish with this McCrap I'll be in position to be like an assistant manager or something. Unless I miss my guess that's what Mike is grooming Paddy sue for... I couldn't go through with gettingher fired, by the way... Mike should find out but... I just want to distance myself from that.

 Right now I'm reading through the Local Store Marketing demographical information for my McDonald's and the surrounding region. I'm also reading through the Hamburger University Management book that Mike took with him. Pretty soon I'll be going through the videos and the regular Management video, then I'll probably read Eric's Management Development book (only like 5 billion pages...) then I'll come back to Mike's book to make sure I didn't forget anything.

 This is so cool, I actually feel my brain getting bigger! So everything would be great if I could get that transfer to Bridgeport through... I not ornery enough to go over Mike's head and talk to Ed or to just quit and get rehired over there. At least he got blunt enough to tell me that he wouldn't transfer me unless it were to his advantage... Oddly enough, this is kinda like breaking up.

   You were the biggest mistake I could have ever made. I regret every moment I spent with you, I wish it never happened. You are a lying, backstabbing, reputation destroying, guilt giving, grudge holding, sick and twisted young lady. 

   You two-faced, overweight, (that's right, I said it) spoiled wretch. I'd feel sorry for you but you worked your hardest to ruin everything that I've worked to achieve. You took my management position, you even took the Training Manager position that I worked hard to be in position for. I sacrificed it for you so you could move ahead, even though I know that I was more ready that you were. 

   I broke up with you when I figured out that things weren't right. I did everything I could to make it easy on you, I responded to every pain-filled E-mail that you sent with politeness, sympathy, and gentleness. You wrote at least two (maybe even three) them a day. When your Grandma asked me what went wrong I even spend hours composing a reply, making sure it clearly explained what happened, how I felt, and that I hoped to cut down on the pain that you would feel. Hours were spent making sure I put in the right mix of clarity, firmness, and care. That's right, I cared for you, I kept standing up for you far after we broke up. The romantic feelings weren't there, but I still valued you and your reputation. 

   I know that you're dating J. C. (it's been about a month now) and honestly I'm happy for you. I'm glad that you've moved on. I am not happy that you've dragged my reputation through the mud with J. C. though. You've made up lies, and he believes them and is now telling other people what horrible things that I did to you.

   I treated you like a queen, I have never said a word about you that wasn't true, even then I was careful with the people that I said the negative stuff about. How do you repay me? You make up lies about things that I would never do to anybody.

         <center>Patricia, I'm going to sleep, and tomorrow I'll ask you for a reason I shouldn't get you fired for dating a crew member.... It'd be especially evil because he's about to break up with you...</center>"

 -POD, some CD some song... Don't remember and I don't feel like looking it up ;)

 So I think I'm finally getting a strong backbone. I've always had a backbone, but now it's growing. I'll still keep stay soft when I need to, but it's also time to stand up for myself.

 Along these lines... I've finally put in for a transfer at McDonald's. I talked with Kym at Bridgeport, and she'll gladly take me on as a manager.

 I also talked with Mike. He doesn't want to let me go, but he figures it's better that I go without quitting and getting rehired. He wants to be my coach for BSMC (Basic Shift Management Course). I'd like him to be my coach, but I also need to be on top of things for myself.

 I'm trying to get ahold of Will so he can show me more Planned Maintenance stuff before I leave. If I can get that learned.... PM is the only in store stuff that I don't think I'll be able to easily learn. Will can teach me, but I couldn't get a hold of him today.

 Maybe I am to nice, but... I think I'm finally being nice to myself for a change. I wonder how long this will last."

"event","Not 5 minutes ago I thought my world was collapsing around me. I thought that I would be wounded for life, scarred by memories of a dance that I went to long ago. I wrote an E-mail about that, while I was covered in a shroud of pain. I apologize for that.

 My emotions are overloaded, I'd take a nap, but... I'm a little behind on my work. I'm going to get to bed at a decent time tonight, in the mean time I get to work, work, work.

 I need to take some time off and find my heart, but that needs to wait until I get my life caught up. I know the next step in locating it, I just need to clean up this clutter so I can walk on the path.

 Slowly I've getting separated from the life of several friends. Deb was the first to go, and now I'm losing others. I can't pretend not to notice, but... I wonder if they are acting or if they honestly don't know."

"event","Haunted by the ghost of what I had, I struggle to make a new life for myself. I'm being cut down before I have the chance to gain momentum. Neither one of them are far from my thoughts these days. The pain happens more often.

 Last night I closed. I was supposed to work from 4-8. I ended up working from 2:00PM to 1:00 AM. Never stop working hard, I need to keep my energy level up. I got a little flower from a couple of girls who came through and ordered water. Little, ugly, and stinky; yet it managed to capture my attention. It's complexity, the pattern of the pollen... it served as a momentary distraction. A moment is all it lasted.

 Get out of my head, I can feel you stalking me. I fight off your offer, yet each time it comes back to the forefront of my mind. Get away from me, I don't want to be with anyone like that! I remember what I had before, and the memory of it constantly mocks me. I refuse to get trapped in another parody of a real relationship. Equal feelings, she must feel the same way (hopefully to the same degree). For it to be worth while what we feel must be love. Love, not lust or infatuation. Love, something worth sacrificing for.

 *David walks off, tormented by his internal demons; those memories that were most cherished are now the only weapons that can (and are) searing his soul. The viewpoints that he once held are being challenged. They are a rowboat upon the storm-tossed waves of the ocean, his mind.*

 Is she out there?"

"event","I am a virgin, and ever since I can remember I've wanted to stay that way until I get married... or at the very least to wait for someone that I love. I want my first time to mean something, I believe that sex is special.

 Yesterday I met with a friend and had a conversation that I never believed would happen to me. She wants to be really good friends.... that could fall into bed together. She's had a kid (very experienced) and is really nice and all that.... but she would like to take my virginity without any real commitment.

 So I say ""no"", right? That's what my plan is so far. I want a girlfriend, not a 'bed-warming' friend. I'm losing my focus though, I'm having trouble remembering why this is so bad. I don't want to lose it, not with her. I want to give it to someone that I belong with, not with a play thing for convience... I don't even want a play thing, but yet... I do. I'm so full of lust sometimes, and then every now and then I will feel stabs of pain. The pain so mind-numbing that I feel like an emotional cripple.

 I fight it off, I overcome and at least seem happy. I either force myself to cry it off or act happy until I no longer need to pretend that I am. At this moment I feel stressed... but I think I'm going to write a story (not one I intend to act out) to release pressure... I hope it works."

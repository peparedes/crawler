"event","all right...

it's about time i get these last few things i want to say off of my chest... so anyone who knows me... was i a good girlfriend? cuz i think so... i fucking dated the worst person in the whole entire world for almost two years... i look back at the whole time and i really cant figure out why i fucking stayed with such a piece of shit... this bitch left me for the nastiest person i have ever seen and it makes me love my life more and more everyday... and i found out the other day that she has been dating this thing for like three months right... so fuckin' while she's cryin to me on the phone everynight, writing me three page letters telling me how she cant live without me, she's with that..thing? heh heh... the part i love the most is while she was with her, I WAS OVER HER HOUSE FUCKIN HER EVERYDAY! how bout that one, just went over there to do that, and the best part is, that's what i told her, i told her the only reason why i was comin over was to FUCK... and then after i did, she sat there and cried, as i ignored her and fell asleep for a minute before i left... i fucking love it... what she got wasnt what she wanted, she doesnt want her, she wants me and she always will, but i left her so that's what she got stuck with and i think it's fucking hilarious... i hope her new girlfriend knows she will always want me back, she will never mean what i meant, she is with the biggest liar in the world and i cant wait for her to waste her life too... she can fuckin have that, i'm over this shit, done... don't care, i can do what i want, where i want, when i want, or is it I CAN DO WHO I WANT, WHERE I WANT, WHEN I WANT... actually this is a big thankyou to her new girlfriend, because holy shit, you saved my life, or maybe you just fuckin gave it to me, cuz i didnt know what life was when i was with her... 

Kerri, i should have listened to you the first week... damnit... *slaps self* i love you man!

Julianne... thankyou... i love you too homie!


so now that i have a life, now that i'm single and i can have fun, let me give this bad boy out, 279 5670!

Niki drove me everywhere in her car... went to Kash n Karry with Niki, Brea, n Jen... watched Jen and Brea fall in the middle of the store (Jen broke her flip flop lol) went back to Brea's... me and Niki left... and basically... she made me feel so much better... i dont know what i would have done without her today, SHE was there for ME... i dont know what i would do without that girl period... and just her being there for me today like she was... she's just so amazing... </P>

So basically, i have to find someone with jet black hair that they shaved off and had a missing body part and also just got out of
jail and unfortunately got an std in jail and happened to be a different race than me and had an accent because i had to go to a different continent on a boat to a graveyard located on a beach because their band was playing there and i wanted to see them because they were my close friends sibling but after meeting them for the first time i would feel uncomfortable and give them the excuse that we couldnt tell anyone because they were too old for me to legally have sex with... and man i'm fucking bored... if you're bored you should take this and try to find out how you can kiss one person to be able to fill in the rest of the x'es..."

Kristen was the ""mom"" type figure, and i was the ""dad"" she cooked side dishes and made me a mixed drink while i tended to the grill... it was funny... OMG i almost forgot, we filled up a pool, and we had the best times ever in that bitch... and well, that's as far as i'll go with that story, hehe... later that night, we chilled, and did the usual you know... i ended up staying the night at Kristen's with Murph... we were so exhausted...

You love being around people, and you are deeply committed to your friends.
You are also unconventional, irreverant, and unimpressed by authority and rules.
Incredibly perceptive, you can usually sense if someone has hidden motives.
You use lots of colorful language and expressions. You're qutie the storyteller!

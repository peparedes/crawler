"event","yesh, last entry ever. because no one cares enough to read. 

so basically, all my emotional pain ever was always my fault, and i am deeply apologetic to anyone and everyone on whom i may have blamed it on.

um...so it hurts. because i feel like my person puts his entire life and anything and everything else that he has to do in front of me, whearas i put him in front of everything else. and this is true, but its hot his fault, its mine, because as usual i turn everything into something way more serious than it really is and cause myself more and more stress. And im getting scared because now that i think about my person predicament...i have come to realize that i am so much more into every aspect of our relationship than he is, and its so incredibley unbalanced. i mean, its already been established (several years ago) that im crazy obsessive, incredibley dependant, and have a serious problem with getting incredibley attatched...but maybe i need someone equally like that. and its not that im not happy with my person, i love him more than i have ever loved anyone before, but maybe this wasn't meant to work out (gee what a surprise). on to the subject of love...today a stunning realization came to me. i know that i love because i have so much to compare it to. when i say 'i love you' i mean every single last bit of it...how can u know wat love is if you have nothing to compare it to? does he know what love is? does he know what he's saying? does he mean it? 

i just read it over and it seems like im blaming it on him but im really not...its just that im beginning to realize some things that i hadn't realized before and it all comes down to emotional experience vs. lack of emotional experience. i overlooked that when i was fretting about the age difference. 

the problem is, i need alot, ALOT alot, maybe too much even, emotionally. but whatever it is, its more than he can give me. i am an emotional avalanche, and he is an ice cube. or something of the sort. yay comparisons, SUCK MY BIG BLACK COCK BITCH.
...anyways, not getting what i need causes me to feel extreme disappointment which causes me to cry and i hate crying...

i wish i could explain myself, i wish i could grab him and shake him and cry and beg for him to notice when im hurt, when im sad, when im crying and to DO something about it, not leave me sitting there in a room full of people who dont give a fuck without even saying goodbye. so what if i'll see him in 45 minutes, every minute stretches on for a century, maybe more. and i can guarantee that every minute does not stretch out for him, never has. 

i should be glad. lucky him, i wouldn't want anyone to feel the way i do most of the time, but my selfishness gets the better of me sometimes. its not that i'm too good for him and he can't give me enough. its that he's too good for me and i want too much. 
which has always been my problem. which will never have a solution. this one is just lasting longer because he has more patience. i wonder how long, i really truly wonder. and im scared because what will come next will not be pretty and i really dont know how im gonna get over it. *sigh* 

on with my life...

"event","so i started writing a story like a million years ago...and i finally finished it. 
here it is. yay. 


<i>
She thinks of the rain and how it always brought a smile to his lips. It seemed to her cold and uninviting. But he saw its beauty, connected with its purity. What was to her tears from the sky was to him the memory of a warm embrace, a comforting moment from his lost childhood.

Those days are long gone for both of them. Even as they make their comeback from the world of needles and veins, they are alone. No one to rely on but each other, they stumble through the cloud of clear vision, confused by their functioning minds. Their feeble lives depend on each other. Grasping hands tightly, they emerge from teh bloody sea into the sunlight.

They are one. A solitary creature, yet born of each other in a time when the world was falling down around them, adn the ground threatened to swallow humanity into the depths of hell.

~

Lost in oblivion, they viewed life through a thick fog, squinted eyes able to focus only on that which was not too bright. There was nothing bright in their lives. No glimmer of hope. Nothing but the ultimate search for a vein, the urge to be back on the bed, sprawled among the dirty sheets with nothing on their minds.

It was the two of them against the world that they weren't really a part of. It was the steadiness of the daily routine. Like a heartbeat, it continued on.

But all steadiness gets interrupted. The heartbeat ceased, started back up again, and froze. The convulsions began and it was not too long until bright red lights were in her eyes, empty faces crowding over her.

It was the thrill of losing control, the adrenaline rush that comes with something new and painful. It was the climax of her life, that which she had been hoping for, that which she had only brushed up against in her exploration.

But they didn't understand. And they took it away from her. And they told her to stop, and she felt like death was slowly making its way towards her. She didn't like this kind of pain. It tore at her, making her scream in sweaty fits of torment in the middle of the night. She couldn't understand why he let them do this to her. But she was in no condition to ask the one time she saw him, through sweaty strands of hair, as she passed him in the hallway of the strange place they were both confined to.

Love. Though the chaos surrounded her, attempting to drown her in need, love broke through at times, bringing a gasp of comfort. When seh thought her sanity was slipping from her fingertips, it was there. Love was there. In tiny doses, but enough to sustain her. Love was all there was.

~

Love is all there wll ever be. And she hopes that it is enough to get them through it all.

The rain is cold, but it puts a smile on his face. And that is all that matters.

<b>IN OTHER NEWS </b>

i was supposed to post this quite a while ago... but i forgot.

BUT!!!

MAKE WAY, WORLD, BECAUSE THE AMY AND EUGENIA FAMOUS RAPISTS ARE COMING. and no, i do NOT mean rappers, i mean RAPISTS

these are the first two songs (written by Amy La*lor) (the * is there so u dont look her up in the fone book and try and rape her cuz shes so hot...cuz i did that and she knida got mad for a littel bit. and i wouldnt do that if i were u anyways, cuz her boyfriend will saw your penis off. yes. saw.)

anyways... heres the first one

<b>nigga grow sum BALLS </b>


all this pressure is causing me to fall, everytime i get up i stumble so i start to crawl, it's such a long way thru this empty hall, when i reach the eng it's your name i call.i don't think of anyone elses name, your lack of reply causes me pain i can feel the anger running thru my veins it's a shame that two people cant get along, shit used to be good i thought we were strong, or stronger then that, but we've been togehter for so long that i'm goin crazy and pretend it's me when you don't call bvut you're just lazy.you can't ready me like this. i won't take it anymore, the respect i don't get, and how you treat me so poor, and it;'s always my fault when we;re apart, you broke my heard from day one.the start of a friendship which led to a relationship but it;s over and all we have now is ""ship"" and that sunk when you began to thinhhk you were too good for me but i'm better because now i'm free to see and feel things i never had before you almost opened up a door but i caught it before you let go and slammed it in my face and now it feels like i'm winning the race of getting over you because i am and now i know i don't need a boy, i need a man.



<b> empty promise</b>

every empty promise you make, causes my heart to break, and my tears go from drops to lakes, i can't take it anymore, i wanna put this shit in a room and lock the door, throw away the key, please help me stop thinking of you, make me realize ""us"" is thru, over with done, i don't wanna walk away from it i wanna run. i can't stand the way you treat me, like i'm yours i don't have the right to be free, but then you leave and my lifes a breeze no pressure causin me to fall to my knees i don't know what you want from me but i do, i want promises that arent' empty 



<b>nick costarelli is a bastard ass motherfucker and i hate him</b>



i think of you while i'm pacing my heart raching my ming tracing to thoughts of us embracing and i'm facing another day, trying to figure out this game you play while i'm home alone starin at the phone acting like theres nowhere else to go, i'm thinkin of you and how you made my heart black and blue, you rode in on your white horse and just the force of you cased me to call i negin to crawl then i pick myself up just to keep the ball roling, i wish i could say it was done, take a gun and make it all go away but instead i take it and say no way he;ll call, he;s not like them all there's always an excuse i pretend to put a noose over your head and fall on my bed pretend i'm dead i can't even hear what you said or are going to say not today,  you're thinking it's all a game you're driving me insane i want to get on a plane and leave for a far off place then i start to pace my heart starts to race, my mind begins to trace to when we embrace and i face another day

"event","so there was this girl
and she had problems.
she also had this boy person who loved her alot, and she was really happy when she was with him...happier than she's ever been before, and she loved him back just as much, maybe more. but that was the problem...the girl had a very bad and unfortunatley uncontrollable tendency to over-do things. over-analyze, over-care, over-worry....ect. u get the picture. and this ruined stuff. badly. and it made the girl sad, which made the boy sad, which made the girl even sadder. and although part of her wanted to blame the boy, she knew she really couldnt because it was all her fault. and then she felt even sadder because she caused the boy worrying and she didnt want him to be worried because she loved him. so then the girl was sad because she fucked things up and couldnt do anything right, and something that started out so good turned into something so messed up and unbalanced, and the girl didnt know how to balance it out. and (as in algebra) unbalanced things tend to fall apart, and this made the girl incredibley sad. but then she realized, hey...wtf, its not like a relationship ever worked out for her anyways, what was she expecting? but she was still sad, because she thought everything would be nice and dandy but it wasnt and it was her fault and even though she tried to stop being stupid and gay, it didnt work. she knew she had to stop being so selfish and thinking about herself all the time and think about the boy and his feelings and about what he wants to do.and then the girl was about as sad as you can get without spilling tears because she felt so bad for this wonderful person who cared about her, and she definitley thought that she did not deserve him and that he was way too good for her. and that just made her so sad that she cried. and she cried and she cried and she didnt know what to do and she just kept on getting sadder and it was sad and she called her stoner friend and he was like 'i dunno' so then she cried some more. and there was a new river, and it was salty.

this NEEDS to stop.

or maybe im turning into a hippi...drugs sex and rock n roll baby. 
im not sure yet.
but ill let you know as soon as i figure it out.


on another note, ive written a few...uhm...""poetry"" pieces....heres the first one (by far the best):

<b>
There once was a boy named John
He liked to have lots of fun.
He liked to smoke rocks, and dust, and weed
And he smoked lots of stoggs because of his need
For nicotine in his blood.
One day there was a big flood
And in it John lost all his coke,
His dust, his weed, and all his smokes.
He cried for a while and then he thought
I'll buy some more, and then he bought
Five pouds of crack, ten pounds of bud
A carton of stoggs, but he slipped in the mud
And broke his finger before he got to Jake's crib.
So Travis and James got first dibs
To smoke out of Jake's new glass bong
Then chill out and listen to some Jedi Mind Trick songs.
But then John thought, he its all G,
Ill just sit here in the mud and smoke all my trees.
So he rolled a fat blunt and sparked that ish.
Then he smoked it, got hungry, and ate some fish.
Because John was Asian, as everyone knew.
He was a smart Korean crackhead, and so are you. </b>


oh man how fucking cool is that. okay heres the next one, its not that good, but becky thinks its awesome. i wrote in in chemistry class today cuz i was bored out of my fucking mind, so now all you lovely people get to read it:

<b>
Oxygenide, said the chemistry teacher.
Mr. Lagos is mean, I waqnt to beat <i>her</i>.
My body hurts, Im dying, I hate chemistry.
Im going to cry why dont you see
That school makes me sad
And thats just bad.
I am a goat.
In a moat.
With a boat.
Whos got the crack?

I wish I had drugs
Or maybe some bugs
This poem is by far the worst ive ever written
Those black, scary birds, on the wires they sittin'
By that i mean phone wires stretched between poles
In soccer and other sports you can score goals.
But in volleyball you cant cuz its teh best sport.
Jacob had a good idea when he said to build a fort
And cover it with clothes from teh lost and found
Then it would look like a big mound
Of clothes.

Oh baby
You drive me crazy
Not.
Smoke crack.
Kill Britney Spears, shes a stupid ho.
Then we'll get rich cuz we'll have all her dough
And go shopping cuz shopping is fun
And we will never ever be done.
Well shop forever until we drop
Well shop and shop and shop and shop.

Laryssa is cool
But she thinks I'm a fool.
She told me tis like green eggs and ham but with sex.
What rhymes with sex?
Nothing.
Empty.
    Black.
       Space.
Fall into a void and dont come back.
And we'll all rejoice and smoke crack
Cuz no one likes you
Oh man its true.
You should die cuz you're a waste of space
You can't even make first base.
Cuz you're stupid.
Die!

Goodnight sweet crackhead of mine.
I hope youre feeling fine.
And if youre not, well that sucks a bunch for you
THeres really nothing you can do.
Except cry in a corner and make yourself bleed
Believe me it feeds to your every need.
Addiction.
Confliction.
Drip.
   Drop.
     Drip.
        Drop.
Run away from the cops.
Run away to the magical forest.
Yay.
LSD. </b>

and then you pull yourself together, have a cigarette, and realize you might as well play it by ear cuz there really is no better way to play this game. and you just hope, hope really hard, that something good will come out of this and maybe you'll be happy.

"event","<i> I am oblivious to the rain outside as your skin moves against mine. All I can feel is the smoothness of your body. Your skin is so soft, softer than mine. And it makes me wonder.

I am driven to believe that its not all smiles, rainbows, and laughter. It is nothing in the end. A hollow emptiness, a stabbing pain. But for some reason we never learn. I never learn. I make the same mistake over and over again, like a blind animal following a blunt instinct driving it to do that which it can't. But that's exactly what it is. In the end, that is exactly what it comes down to. Instinct. And it drives us over the cliff. Over and over and over again utnil you are so numb from the pain you just don't feel it anymore. And that's when you learn. 

And it makes me wonder. How much longer? How long is this treck to the top of the hill, the top of the mountain, the top of the world? It's too late to turn around and I'm scared. Scared that the fall will hurt even more than it has before. Scared that maybe, this once, I'll break too many bones. Scared that my heart will burst from the impact, shatter into a million rose petals, each dripping an icy cold tear...

But solitude is forever my one and only friend. I reach out but you are gone. I am left with memories of your fingertips touching mine and I am too alone to cry. I am too numb. And I am alive.

I cannot move, but fueled by your energy my heart is racing. Back to a place where I have not been in a thousand lifetimes. I am losing myself, losing my mind, losing my body. I grab on to you for safety, hoping that you will not let me go.

This is a new world. A strange new world. And I prod around like a newborn kitten, excited by its sense, but too dumb and blind to know what's going on. I am alone. In my corner. My hands are shaking and I wish there was someone by my side...

Your innocense is your beauty. Your beauty is your innocense. And I am the plague. And I am death.

But please don't push me away, for I am the kind death. One that comes with peace at heart. One that comes with love. My kiss will be pleasant, though it'll bring your corruption. I'm sorry.


I am the moon, silent in the dark, night sky.You are life, beauty, purity. Your skin is softer than mine, and I am alive. </i>"

the people here are awesome tho, and by people i mean my friends. seriously, theyre just nice and not stuck up and not annoying self obsessed bitches like every single american i have ever come across. no offence, i love you kids despite your typical americness, but my people are my people and my people rock the hizhouse.

anyways, now that im actually here im really glad that i came because i was getting really sick of glen ridge. i miss everyone alot tho and i wish you could all come out here and visit me for a few days and buy as much alcohol as you want cuz theyll sell to you.

i have a bitch. his name is alex. i own him cuz he wants me but hes not gonna get me cuz im in the process of getting with this other kid who is seriously the nicest person i have ever met in my entire life. and hes hot. speaking of hot, i am suddenly attractive. as in long legs and skinnyness is a good thing. im still getting used to it. strange.

oh yeah and i acquired some mareehooannna today, it suuuuuucks. and its apparantly their best shit. oh well. silly ukrainians. i havent tested it out yet so im not giving any final opinions but i'll let y'all know. and by y'all i mean the 2 people that actually read my livejournal. :)

I SNUCK OUT OF MY HOUSE YESTERDAY!!! for the first time either. i sound like such a loser but please let me point out that its physically impossible to sneak out cuz ALLLL the floorboards creak and my whole house is creaky floorboards, my parents bedroom door is always open and i have to walk past it to get downstairs, there is no way to get out of the house from the second or third floors, and my stupid dog barks if i leave the house.

"event","okay so obviously no one cares enough to read this but ill write in it anyways.
umm...im a stupid immature brat for getting all emotional about my summer ending so quickly and having to go spend so much time in ukraine and not seeing mariel for a million hundred years but then...i slapped myself a few times and snapped back to normal.

so, while telling you all about this im sort of convincing myself of the following:

1) although i will miss mariel, i have other friends. like amy and nicole and jacob and becky and a bunch of incoming freshman and joe and some of his cronies. (hehe i just said cronies)

2) okay so my summer is over but i cant do shit about it so i may as well make the most of what i have and get trashed. if i could get laid that would make it even better.

3) so im not too excited about going to ukraine but seriously, how bad can it be. ill be allowed to do whatever the fuck my little white ass wants. and my grandparents are old and they miss me so what the hell. besides i gots some cool relatives out in the countryside.

4) even though im not really admitting it to myself i really need time away from glen ridge. seriously, being in glen ridge is like a disease. a horrible disease that eats away at you and eventually drives you to either severe alcoholism or suicide. or both. or you can turn into mike zink which is even worse. so basically ill come back (with hopefully a few days left before the school years starts to get trashed) with a new outlook on everything and a ""fresh"" not glen-ridge-clouded brain. hopefully i will also become un-attatched to certain people to whom i am too attatched for my own good. seriously though man, glen ridge...its like a disease. get out of here while you still can. 

5) umm...i hope my friends dont forget me. 




yeah thats it. so...goodbye all you people that dont read this.

<b>VINDICATED</b> by <b>dashboard confessional</b>

Hope, dangles on a string 
Like slow spinning redemption 
Winding in and winding out 
The shine of it has caught my eye 
Roped me in so mesmorizing 
And so hypnotizing 
I am captivated 
I am... 

Vindicated 
I am selfish, I am wrong 
I am right, I swear I'm right 
Swear I knew it all along 
And I am flawed 
But I am cleaning up so well 
I am seeing in me now 
The things you swore you saw yourself 

So clear 
Like the diamond in your ring 
Cut to mirror your intention 
Oversized and overwhelmed 
The shine of which has caught my eye 
And rendered me so isolated 
So motivated, I am certain now 
That I am.. 

Vindicated 
I am selfish, I am wrong 
I am right, I swear I'm right 
Swear I knew it all along 
And I am flawed 
But I am cleaning up so well 
I am seeing in me now 
The things you swore you saw yourself 

So turn up the corners of your lips 
Part them and feel my finger tips 
Trace the moment, fall forever 
Defence is paper thin 
Just one touch and I'd be in too deep
to ever swim against the current 

So let me slip away, so let me slip away 
So let me slip away, so let me slip against the current 
So let me slip away, so let me slip away 
So let me slip away, so let me slip away 

Vindicated 
I am selfish, I am wrong 
I am right, I swear I'm right 
Swear I knew it all along 
And I am flawed 
But I am cleaning up so well 
I am seeing in me now 
The things you swore you saw yourself 

Like hope, dangles on a string 
Like slow spinning redemption

i found a cure for my fake depression....BEING PRODUCTIVE.
a.k.a. school work, cleaning (GASP!) and other such things that leave me not a worthless piece of something wasting other ppls air.
i feel so much better once i know i've done something productive. seirously. 
also, it makes my highs better. most of my highs have SUCKED this past year...seriously 80% of my highs were bad over the past about 7/8 moths. 
but like...since i feel like i've worked and i deserve it my highs rock my socks. 

haha wow.
im gonna go babysit now...and eat my neighbors kitchen cuz im fucking starving...and do my incredibley long HISTORY LIST and my math homework.
and then maybe after im done with all of that and if im only babysitting till 7:30 i'll go somwhere with hannie and spend SOME of my well-earned money on starbucks or something. 
but only some...cuz im saving the rest up for getting my hair done at the end of the month and the bux county trip. and i want atleast half of that money earned and not stolen from my dad.
i also have to set aside money to go tanning this weekend with mari-L. TWICE. cuz im a pale-ass motherfucker. so who CARES if its bad for your skin...i wont go tanning during the summer. A DUR HURRR.

yeah...so thats life.
bye!

I NEED TO GET LAID. sucking penis just doesnt cut it...sorry. even tho im definitley in a sucking penis mood right now cuz im not horny. note to attractive males: if you want head from me catch me when im not craving sex. 

the end.

p.s. mariels got a good thing going there...IF YOU READ MY JOURNAL COMMENT. I WANT TO KNOW WHO READS THIS SHIT. thank you for your cooperation.   :/"

then i was bored for like an hour and a half and then i went to meet nicole half way walking to my house and we sat on someones front lawn figuring out wat we were gonna do (we wanted to get drunk) but then realized we had no friends. so we went to my house.but we were locked out cuz i left my keys inside.
n my parents werent home.
so we went to my daddys store...assuming my parents were there cuz thats where they said they were gonna be.
but they werent
so we went back to my house and they werent there either
so we walked around.

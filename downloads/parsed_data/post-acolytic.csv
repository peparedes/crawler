"event","i am sick today.  but will feel better tomorrow.  and even better the day after.  knowing this makes today bearable.

3rd week of the fall semester, my last year in undergraduate courses.  i'm nervous.  the thought of applying to grad school is overwhelming, a congenital pressure that waits to be released.  i've come so far and i'm simply not the same person i was before.  i enjoy this truth.

i'm better, closer, faster, stronger.  good things abound, and the future is dappled with hope.  i'm trying to embrace this, trying to remember this through the immense stress and isolation i feel.  i'd assumed that loneliness would be precluded by this hectic life.  but ""busy"" is so often a solution for ""lonely"", and an inadequate one at that.  i realize this now, fortunate to have learned it so early.

and do i fight the urge to be overly dramatic about this?  mos def.

there's just too much to go into right now.  and though i border on being ovewhelmed, i feel secure.  so things are good.

"event","and not like a sheep.

i don't want to go home tonite.  my brother and his girlfriend are coming home from a week-long trip to Houston and i don't want to deal with it.  i've had the house to myself (and my kitty) for a little over a week now and it has really reminded me of how much i used to enjoy living alone.  now they'll be back, and i can say with no doubt in my mind that when i get home from work tonite, their luggage and their trash, and all of their shit will have filled the living room.  the kitchen will be covered with take-out boxes, trash, and whatever dirty dishes they've created will be left in the original cooking position.  their dog will be going apeshit, will probably have pissed on the carpet 3 times since their return, and it won't have been soaked up or scrubbed away.  

i say this and i sound so hateful when i do, but it's sadly the truth, and though i love them both dearly, it is difficult to live with them at times.  i compensate by making my bedroom an island apart from the rest of the house and spending most of my time in there.  but it's hard not to feel like the hired help at times because i'll clean and get things to a point where i'm comfortable with them, and before i've had a chance to enjoy it, it's wiped out.  and there is no thanks for how hard i work there.  it's taken completely for granted.  but before you pity me, or condemn me for whining in such a way, realize that i am aware of the extent to which i enable their behavior.  i could speak my mind about their cleanliness and insist they try harder, but i was aware of the state of their disarray before i moved in with them, for one.  and also, this is by far a temporary arrangement.  come the following spring, i may well be in another state and this will be ancient history.  it's not worth spurring ire and malice into the air for the last handful of months i'll be staying.

suffice it to say, i am in a bitter and resentful mood as it stands and i don't want to deal with this situation.  

on the plus side my financial aid money comes in tomorrow which always feels like i've won the lottery because suddenly i can pay my bills and the prospect of spending over $3 on something doesn't scare thoughts of budget constraints into my head.

it should still provoke such thoughts, though.

wah.  back to the dungeon.  back to my hole.  i do not want to go home tonite.  any other night is fine, but not tonite."

"event","whew.  i've recovered from my spaz-fit yesterday.  but, man.  i spent so long and just gushed.  now i don't know if i want to recap or not.

i guess, to fill in the gaps from my previous postings (okay canyons would be a better term), i have decided what i want to be when i grow up.  (yay!  and it only took me 25 years...)  i've decided to get my master's and my doctorate in clinical psychology (or counseling psychology depending on finances and program opportunities) and then specialize in art therapy from there.  that way i'm truly getting the best of both worlds (seriously, i'll make good money and get to utilize all of those skills and talents that matter most to me.  it's kind of a blessing to have decided on such an interesting and appropriate solution to my career decisions or simply to have such an option.)  oh yeah, but first there's the schoolin, and the financial aid-in, and all the not-so-fun shit.  i'm not concerned though.  i enjoy the subject matter so much that i quite honestly just absorb it in class, and so far, things seem to be rolling right along as planned.  

so that's school.  fall semester doesn't start for another week and a half but i'm ready for it (believe it or not).

family matters are at an oddly positive stasis point.  mom is living here in town and now dad visits every weekend.  they are engaging in this sort of courtship that's genuinely touching to witness, if nothing else, because they have never been so tender and considerate of eachother.  they spend every weekend together talking and laughing.  i'm proud of them.  and in some small way, i'd like to believe i helped to make it possible.  so 1/1000th of a yay for me.

personally, i'm feeling well and centered.  i was ill for about a week recently and that sucked the life out of me in a nasty way for a while.  i've only had about 3 weeks off from school altogether because i took summer classes.  but it's made me appreciate this time so much more.  my brother and his girlfriend are out of town this week as well, so the apartment is all mine (and my kitty's) and we are living like kings.  

i've been reading.  playing some video games.  listening to music (seriously, jacob!  rilo kiley, mirah, and radiohead b-sides if you must know.  i've even sampled some others but nothing has really grabbed me by the nads and said ""Stop what you're doing and listen to me now!"" like these have.)  i'm working on some paintings (actively), and altering photos at the request of some friends.

i'm going to cut this here.  i plan to post more tomorrow.  hopefully no more recrap after this."

"event","Well, it's been over a month since I've updated, and it seems I should at least check in here.  

School has kept me busy, most certainly.  My grades are great, and I'm learning shitloads.  I feel I may actually be ready for graduate school at this rate.  Now, it's coming down to a different kind of decision though.  I'm really torn between going straight into a master's degree program for art therapy and going through the master's and doctoral program for a clinical psychologist.  I know I would really enjoy doing either one just as much.

Hmm... pros and cons time.

Art Therapy:
Pros-
Involves art
Would serve two functions simultaneously--art practice and social work.
Seems a less rigid environment and structure than typical therapy setting.
Love divining meaning in art.
Certainly a natural progression from a BA in Fine Art/wouldn't feel like BA degree was quite so much a waste.
Cutting edge field with vast room for advancements.
Less money in student loans overall.
Enjoy all aspects of this study.

Cons-
Won't make as much money as a clinical psychologist.
Not nearly as many job opportunities.
Not nearly the recognition.
Still have a lot of art work to complete for applications.


Clinical Psychology:
Pros-
Good pay!
Get to help some of the most desperately in-need people.
Lot of time and work to get this degree will make the accomplishment that much greater.
Many job opportunities allowing for greater living location flexibility.
High recognition.
Truly enjoy the subject and work.
Could still do art in the side.

Cons-
5-7 more years of school.
5-7 more years of student loans.
I will be 30 before it's over and possibly still living in Oklahoma!


That didn't help..."

Arg.

I am at work and even though this is a call center-type environment, we are somehow allowed to listen to the radio, but it is not mine and so I have no control over the station.  On rare occasions it's the oldies station and I think, by far, it is the most tolerable.  Otherwise, it is on some crap station where I have to hear the new-ish No Doubt song 20 times an hour along with the Outkast song that I used to enjoy but now soundtracks my nightmares.  I don't know which is worse.

-- end of rant

So school is fine.  Err... um.

Okay, well I skipped class today.  I'm a bad boy.  I can't even feign some reason I deserved it.  I just did it because I could.  But I won't let this become a habit.  Stupid 500 student classes and their lax attendance policies...

I still spent 2 hours reading the chapters covered, so it's not even like I was that delinquent.  Oh, the inner turmoil.  No, I'm lying.  I seriously don't care.  

I quit smoking sunday, and so far, barring a few cheating moments, I am sticking to it.  The patch is, however, making it harder to get up in the morning, and I'm going to have to reconcile this problem with an earlier bedtime, but of course that doesn't exactly work because the patch makes sleep less restful in general.  ""Well, take it off at night,"" you might be saying.  My answer to that is ""Mind your own goddamn business.""  

Take that you voices in my head.

I'll eventually have to take it off and catch up on my REM sleep, but in the meantime I'm enjoying the hell out of the dreams.  

The other night I had a dream that a tooth broke off exposing a 2 foot long silky thread of a nerve hanging out of my mouth which I then cut with a pair of scissors to get it down to a manageable length.  Gross, huh?

There was another one where I went back to college but just happened to bump into some of my friends from my first round of school who were now enrolled in this entirely different (but strangely similar) school.  All were actual people except for David who, for all intensive purposes, looked exactly like a newborn infant and yet was driving a minivan by means of some complicated contraption of pedals and levers around the driver's seat.  As I recognized him, I suddenly remembered the unfortunate disease he possessed that would keep him that size for his entire life even though he was now almost 30.  Long story short, we all met in a restaurant later and on my way to the table I became trapped by a herd of waitstaff carring trays of exotic foods and when I couldn't get past them and they began to shove the plates in my face all at once, I yelled ""You are really going to have to get the fuck out of my way.""  And then I woke up."

"event","School has started well.  I'm over-achieving and that's something I haven't attempted in some time.  But it's only the first week, so I should probably pace myself a bit.  Either way it's a good thing.

My schedule is fine, but my days are just completely tied up.  There are a few decent gaps here and there where I get to catch up, study, or chain smoke (which will soon be solved when I finally give up the little bastards).  I look forward to getting into the routine so that my free time can be better utilized.

All in all, I'm looking forward to a good semester. 

The major long-term dilemma right now is, as always, actually doing art, which will be absolutely necessary if I am to apply for an art therapy master's program.  I just don't know what's wrong with me.  I've developed my organizational and time management habits into a decent system, so that, when it comes to most things, I seem to be capable of handling anything that pops up.  But when I set out to work on some sort of art project, any sort really, I bombard myself with doubts and criticisms and, ultimately, fall short of ever completing anything.  With each successive failure, I'm further disheartened, and it's been this way for 2 years now. 

I should mention now that it wasn't always this way.  It used to be that I couldn't help but work on art.  It was exciting and extremely rewarding to complete a project, to learn some new technique or refine an old one.  Everything I owned was covered with sketching and there was a therapeutic quality to the act of art-making that propelled me further.  

I suppose some of my current difficulty stems from the guilt I still harbor at not having accomplished more in school or even after graduation.  I'd wanted to be working as an independent illustrator by now, but this mood disorder (as I've chosen to call it) has severely hampered my drive.  And being an independent artist requires so much courage and self-motivation that it's probably no wonder I haven't made better progress.  Self-doubt has conquered me and made every advantage of my weaknesses.  I am my own worst enemy.

I say all of this now with a bit of critical distance (I'm not whining. I swear it.), and it does not feel daunting to imagine getting back to work on my art, but it always feels more feasible at times when it's impossible to actually do the work.

For now, I guess, I'll just enjoy that it's Friday and continue in the manner I've begun.  Here's to a fresh start..."

"event","There is so much to catch up on, and the days since Christmas have been ludicrous and bipolar.

I suppose I'll start there.

I spent Christmas with my immediate family at my parent's home, and, for what it's worth, I enjoyed a few very cozy comfortable moments there.  The majority of my time, however, was spent in nervous anticipation of the many obligations I was under with friends who also happened to be in town for the holiday.  Each day was packed with phone calls and scheduled get-togethers that end up feeling more like business appointments than anything joyous.  I'm sure it's selfish to have felt this way, but all I really wanted to do was relax at home and spend time with my family there.  But it's less selfish when  you consider that it's the same way every year.  The previous Christmas I had a friend in from out of state and I tried to spend as much quality time with him as I could, but no matter how much fun it is, I end up feeling guilty because I've effectively neglected someone else.  I realize this probably has more to do with an anxiety disorder than anything else, but healthcare is not exactly an option right now, so I'm trying to ""tough it out"".  

To end the bitching on that fact, I did have a few good moments with friends.  For one, eye-yer-mind came over (how strange to call him that) and we got to spend some time with a mutual friend who now lives in England and just happened to be home.  There was some drinking involved, some Mario Kart, and cards.  All in all, a good night.  

(Not to retrace my immediate steps here, but looking at it now, I should not be complaining about having too many obligations with friends.  It's a blessing to be surrounded by people who love you and want your company.  It can also be overwhelming, but in retrospect it's worth it.  Note to myself:  stop with the whiny bitch thing already.)

I returned home the Sunday before New Year's and spent the next day with some friends.  On New Year's eve, eye yer mind, our friend from the good Queen's underbelly, and the same group I mentioned before, all came down to visit and we spent the night at another friend's house in what was later called ""a white trash orgy of violence"".  It was aptly named.

The details are sketchy, for one reason or another (stupid whiskey), but I'll simply say that frozen turkeys went missing, domestic violence ensued, lawn furniture was piled into cars, sinks were ripped from walls and bathrooms were flooded.  Soon after which, taxis were called, Denny's was eaten, and to our beds we finally arrived.

On the next day, my brother, his girlfriend, and I drove to Houston to see her family (whom I had not yet met).  Why I agreed to go, I'll never really understand.  It seemed like something I should do as they will more than likely become in-laws sooner or later.  But it was awkward (for me at least).  Everyone was friendly enough, and I didn't have to do a damn thing, which is always beautiful, but I felt very out of place.  It was probably inappropriate for me to come down and stay with them, but truly, it wasn't my idea.

There was one glorious zen moment where I got to lay in a hammock enjoying 70 degree weather in the middle of winter, reading a book (Fast Food Nation for any curious minds) and dozing.  I also got a whirlwind tour of parts of Houston and there are some really amazing places down there.  

We drove home on monday (a 7 hour drive), and I went straight to work after that.

Since then I've been bombarded with preparations for my return to school, a car window that wouldn't roll down in sub-freezing temperatures and plenty of highway driving to go with it, cat barf, and high drama with my family including a brutal argument with my mother.

Okay now I'm done with the whiny bitch thing."

I'm like a rabbit in a vegetable store carrying a credit card with no limit.. .and teeth that... break bones and... okay, I'm done.  Nevermind.

So I'm a bit looney today.  That will just have to be understood as I have no intention of changing it.

Work is chugging by slowly and I'm stuffing my face with holiday candy and pastries in the meantime.  Obesity, here I come.

Word I use too often:  ""Exactly""

Need to work on that.

I'm becoming a little too involved in a video game.  I find myself looking forward to every opportunity there is to play it.  This will be a bad thing once the semester starts, so I may have to cut myself off now.  Ohhhh but I don't want to.  It's pitiful really.  The worst part about enjoying video games anymore is the massive amount of time required to play through them, and when you finally come into adult-hood, and you make all of these goals for yourself, there is this tremendous guilt associated with time spent on meaningless entertainment.  I can give it up anytime!  I'm not addicted!  But I'm not quitting yet.  Thank you, oh ""Golden Age of Entertainment"".

Too aimless to continue any further.  I'll wait until my blood sugar drops a bit."

"event","Feeling better today.  I think lack of money, sleep, and the usual stress of christmas/etc. got the better of me.  This is not to say that I don't still on some level believe my previous conclusions.  I just don't see it simply as the end.

And speaking of Christmas, I'm trying desperately to work myself into the spirit of things.  In a somewhat landmark decision, we decided as a family to draw names and only buy for one person this year(with the exception of my ""down-and-out"" brother who can't afford to buy for anyone) and I feel this is a positive move.  There's so much less stress overall, less spending involved and, I feel, it holds true to this greater christmas legacy of appreciating time spent with family.  When I have a family of my own someday, I really want to strive to create family traditions that don't revolve around consumerism and dollar value.  Maybe I'm just dreaming though, and when it comes time, I'll just buy the little demons' love and affection with killer new toys.

Meanwhile I should be designing my Christmas/New Year's cards(late as hell, I know), working on some artwork that will be a belated present for one of my roommates, and so many other hyper-practical things.

"event","Well, life has been insane lately. But to wrap it all up into one cryptic nuttshell, here is some Pedro the Lion lyrics:


Have you ever seen and idealist with grey hairs on his head
Or successful men that keep in touch with unsuccessful friends
You only think you did
I could have sworn I saw it too
But as it turns out
It was just a clever act for cigarettes

'Cause if it isn't making dollars
Then it isn't making sense
If you aren't moving units
Then you're not worth the expense
If you really want to make it
You had best remember this
If it isn't penetration
The it isn't worth the kiss"

After binge drinking saterday night, waking up sunday morning with the worst hangover ever and then not sleeping yet, the ipod is the only thing holding my sanity together at work. If it where to fail I would collapse in a wretched tweaked out heap. hour and a half to go.

When I don't sleep for over 24 hours I get really worried. I don't know, paraniod, anxious, deppressed. And then I want to have sex with things, but besides the last part, all bad.

My lungs feel like burning."

Supposed to be researching federalism, and I stumble across one article about over 23% of the money earmarked for AIDS prevention was given to Christian groups so that they can teach ""all those dirty fags and niggers"" not to have sex.

What the fuck. How the hell do you ""teach"" someone to be abstinent? Are there fidelity textbooks out there?

He looks kinda young. I guess I won't feel that bad when I beat the bloody shit out of his fuck-face.

By the way, if you didn't know, Timmy is responsible for the $30 tabs, cuts to social services, and just recently, at our state capitol, stood up and opposed a law that would make it illegal to discriminate against homosexuals. You know, just like it's illegal to discriminate against blacks, women, and OTHER HUMANS. It's actually the same bill. They just throw the word fag on there and call it good. BUT NOOOOOO not good for Timmy. Churches and Christian Institutions across the state are already voicing their support for the anti-Christ up there. Which I lump into the doucheness. Maybe the discharge, yes. THEY ARE THE POST-DOUCHE DISCHARGE.

I see. So that warrents a 16/20? Especially since you didn't state any criteria except for ""Write a paper on the differences between state and federal constitutions"".

I think it might have something to do with the fact that I pionted out he was all but absent from the first weeks discusions.

Sorry, you can only come if you work for Arlington Public Schools.

So I have to plan that and still go christmas shopping and send presents.

I also have to be at Sea-tac airport tommorow at bloody 10 in the morning for a big union delagate meeting and go to josies party in Tacoma in the evening (wich I need directions to).

Got my textbooks in the mail yesterday. I'm stoked for classes to start.

Played Sarah a song last night. ""I will follow you into the Dark"" by Death Cab for Cutie.

Pragmatic is playing a christmas show on the 23rd. Hopefully the guys will come through and learn some christmas songs.

Hopefully I'll see some LJ friends there as well. It's at the Chrome Cafe in Arlington.

For more info: www.myspace.com/pragmatic

I have to order a new power adapter for my hard drive (blew up), get a christmas tree, pay more bills, put up a new mailbox, and get a copy of Microsoft word for my lappy. pLus much more that I can't remember now.

Even though I have all this stuff to do, and my head is pounding, it makes me content. I seem to like stress."

It seems I have been rushing feverishly to attain something that is monitarily useless to me. It is more of a conquest. Maybe spirtual or maybe just to say I could achieve it.

"event","Yes, I purchased a Pro Tools M Box on Friday and I finally downloaded the software after many painstakingly dreadfull processes today.

Now I can go home and use my new Groove Tubes condenser mic and actually record something. Woot!

On another note, thanks to the Arm for the two full disks of mp3's. Including albums by the likes of Wolf Parade, Criteria, and Clap Your Hands and Say Yeah.

Also some atrocious radiohead demos from back in the day."

why then recently, have I been so negative and deppressed?

Why do I ask questions that I know the answers to.

Why am I awake at 3:30 am

Why can't things be fun like they used to.

Anyways, moving out of Baltimore(Windsor Mill) to Germantown. I'm really excited because I will be closer to my family and able to work full time since I have day care lined up out there. So yeah. Next weekend is the big move. Packing all this week. Packing is not fun but at least I enjoy unpacking a little. 

On a side note, I am a little jealous of my son's room. His closet is a walk in and mine is kinda small. I guess my lolita clothes will just have to live in my son's closet. He is only 3 so I don't think he will mind much."

i was really eager and willing to do a shit ton of crap at work over the weekend and of course, i get super busy with customers who can't pick out their own shampoo. seriously, my 2 year old son can tell me which shampoo he wants to use so how is it that an adult is incapable of doing so without help? half of the time i just want to ask these women if their husbands/boyfriends/significant others bathe and dress them. people fucking irritate me sometimes. 
and lately i've been super duper paranoid that i'm gonna die at any second now. the fact that my cousin's husband died suddenly a while back doesn't help either. 
there is a lot more explanation to go with the death thing but i don't want to get into it. i'd like to be able to get some sleep tonight.

on top of everything, i've been wanting to start counseling to help me sort out my crazy. but then extra bills pop up followed by a couple of shit paychecks and i'm starting to think that maybe counseling isn't exactly a priority anymore. feeding my child is more important and all i can really afford right now.

thanks life for once again, being an asshole."

"event","I hate the holidays. I really do. Its the time of the year that people either become huge assholes or insanely depressed. But then there are people who are obscenely cheery. These are the same people who obsessively clean their homes, wake up at 5 am everyday and have a general sunny disposition. To these individuals, fuck you. You make my life hell by giving me unrealistic ideals of what I should be. You are not real, you are robots. 

Most of the time during the holidays, I am crazy-stressed with gifts to give, budgets to manage and generally not feeling that I am up to par with the expectations of the holidays. This year I am gonna try something new. I am gonna stick to what I know, just do what I originally plan and give a mental 'fuck you' to anything/anyone who tries to change this. I will not feel inadequate because I do not have loads of cash to spend on lavish gifts for my loved ones. I will feel proud of my handmade creations and baked goods that I will be giving. Just because they did not cost much does not mean I didn't make them with lots of love and consideration of the recipient. And I WILL NOT BE LISTENING TO HOLIDAY MUSIC. This shit bores me to tears and irritates my soul. This year Santa Claus is staying out of my town and that sleigh can run right off a mountain with all those fuckers inside it laughing all the way.

I feel much better now that I have expressed my thoughts on the holidays. Don't get me wrong, I like getting together with my family and giving gifts but I do not like the bullshit pressure that tends to come with such a widespread commercialized holiday."

the swatch shows it is pink. goldwell's rep says that they are true to tone and what you see is what you get. sure it is. 

so i mixed conditioner with pravana magenta and red (mostly to cancel out the purple tone magenta tends to have). i'm sure it will be bright for a little but hopefully it will be closer to the pink i've been chasing."

"event","I hope that things are heading in the right direction. There are things that lay within my future that may bring much joy and contentment. I really hope it works out. I don't want to go into detail and jinx my chances. But for now, its giving me something to work towards. 

My little man is growing up so wonderfully. I hope he always stays this sweet and nothing crushes his dreams. He is dancing to vnv nation as I am typing this. Cute!

Got lots of ideas concerning girly crafty bits. But first I MUST finish all the amigurumi I am making as holiday gifts. I have one somewhat finished (I need to buy stuffing and put it together) and have not even started the second. I think I&nbsp;have 4-5 total I am making. Macarons are also on the holiday baking agenda and I&nbsp;really wanted to practice a little but I don't think that is gonna happen soon. Not before November at least. I need to get up on it though, September is almost over. 

My pink hair is becoming a reality in just a little under 2 weeks. Goldwell 9pv plus a glossing with either pravana light pink or matrix prism plus light pink. I can't wait!!! Its gonna look awesome. Depending on how the glossing goes, I may end up having to stock up on some pink color such as manic panic. Buuuut that's only if pravana or matrix doesn't work. Manic panic is the only one that has worked as far as actually showing up on my hair. Longevity is still an issue but I'll deal. As long as the color is right, I'll deal with frequent application. I really want my cotton candy pink hair.

Speaking of hair.... my mom has finally agreed to let me do some gray coloring on her. I'm gonna be using wella color touch 8/81. Because of it being a demi color, I may have to prelighten a little but I'm sure it will all be okay. I'm just doing it as 'highlights' for now to see if she likes it. The ghd rep that comes to my store said that wella's 8/81 is the perfect 'meryl streep in devil wears prada' color. My mom happens to like that particular style. Or at least that is the impression I get from her. I'm also excited to be doing a body wave for her, it will be a new perm technique for me. I've done it on a manniquin before but its been a while. I&nbsp;feel confident though, my sister's hair was the first straightener/relaxer service I did and that came out well. So I am sure I can do this too.

That is all for now, I really don't have much else worthy of speaking about. Going back to my coffee now. Tasty, tasty coffee."

first off, my car was on its last leg so my dad and brother tell me its time to give up and move onto another vehicle. that's fine, except i lack the funds to do so. so my father helps me with that as long as i pay him back for EVERYTHING starting now. at this rate, i owe him an organ, my next child and a place to live when he gets all old crazy. (at least that's how i feel) nothing better to send me into a self-loathing depression cuz i can't pay for my shit on my own. i'm 23, i should be able to take care of things like this on my own by now. at least when i get back my amended taxes and taxes for this year, i'll be able to speed things along by handing over larger sums to get me out of this debt. 
THEN.. barry decides to start passing a kidney stone and act like a huge pussy in the process. alright, i shouldn't say that. i understand that it can be very very painful. lets just say that it was the second trip to the hospital that made me sour cuz of his 'can't do a thing cuz i have lots of pain and i'm gonna act like a huge douche about it' attitude. at least he let me sleep until 4:30 am'ish instead of making me take him at 10:30 pm when i was just starting to get comfy in bed.
the next day at work wasn't much better. my manager ends up in the hospital cuz of her gall bladder. so she has that taken out. that leaves me at work on a friday with shipment by myself all day. fun.

I should be doing laundry right now, buuuuuuut.... I just don't feel like it. 
And seriously, I really need to stop with the meat. Ever since I&nbsp;started eating fish again, my weight has gone up almost 7 pounds. I&nbsp;know, whoop-de-doo, right? Because I am vertically challenged, 7 pound gain looks like 10. Either that, or I need to quit the cheese. Fucking cheese has a hold on me like no other. One or the other. I&nbsp; think I'd prefer the quit the cheese though. More beneficial to quit cheese than fish for nutritional reasons. Maybe I'll quit cheese....

A few weeks ago I actually sought out and bought banana clips. Yes, those horrid hair accessories from the 80's that made it possible to look even more ridiculous with crimped hair, as if the crimped hair wasn't enough. The strangest part is all the complements I get on my hair when I do wear it to work. Barry makes fun of me for it. He teases me about a lot.

- I'm pretty sure that Barry didn't save my gta 4 game because he thinks&nbsp; it auto saves. I've told him that game lies. Lots of progress lost.
-I've discovered how awesome Netflix is.

Maybe I just spend too much time at home and over exert myself at my two jobs so that I am too tired to really do anything on my days off. But my life is far from what I had always hoped for. I know it is not too late to turn things around and make it what I want but my biggest issue is that I am more than certain that I do not know what I want. I'm clueless as far as what I want to do professionally and the man I love is less than whom I had always hoped for. He is becoming a better man everyday and I adore that he tries as much as he does. I don't know... I guess it is the fact that he doesn't believe in marriage and is only marrying me because he wants to give me everything that I want. But knowing that makes me think that the marriage is only going to feel hollow and eventually turn to divorce. Again, I know I have control over how things go down between us but I can't help feeling this way.

What I really need to do is finish the blanket I've been crocheting for almost 3 months now. I don't work on it a little everyday and that's my downfall. I tell myself everyday to do something with it and I never do. Maybe I should just finish the skein I'm on and say its done. But that would be cheating. I want my blanket to be cuddle worthy. 

This weekend is meh. The expected pool party tomorrow should be loads of fun but I still have lots of stretch marks and loose skin. I know I could have prevented the loose skin by losing weight at a slower rate but.... I'm not gonna get into that right now.&nbsp; But.. something fun now... VEGAN TRUFFLES! That's right I am gonna make vegan chocolate truffles for the party and not with that nasty soy cream cheese crap either.&nbsp; The recipe calls for cashews blended into a creamy consistency instead of soy crap.&nbsp; So I expect it to be super tasty. I'm not telling anyone at the party they're vegan either. I'm scared that no one will eat them then. Except maybe for this one woman, Marcie only because she is really into all that organic shit. I'll post pictures of my culinary triumph later. 

Speaking of parties.. my son's first birthday is on the July 6th. A party on each weekend. Nice.

Not just because mom and dad are there but most of my friends (the ones that really care and actually come visit me) are there and I miss them soo much. I would be closer to my sister too but I would be closer to her in Silver Spring as well. And there is the issue of my job as well. Right now I work in Owings Mills. That's a hell of a drive.

I fell asleep earlier (4 PMish on 3/31) and planned on staying in bed until a reasonable 7 or 8 AM but I was unable to stay unconscious thus ruining my plans. I got up around 10 PMish and have been up since. James woke up around 2 AM and after an hour of trying to rock him back to sleep, I threw in the towel and brought him downstairs to hang out with me. I love how cheerful he is all the time. I couldn't imagine being without my sunshine. James is the main reason I haven't killed myself yet. I just hope when he grows up he doesn't hate me. 

A friend of mine and his wife are moving to Germany. I'm gonna miss them. They were the people I invented drunk sunday movie night with. That was great fun. I can't drink like that anymore though. Not just because of the responsibility of being a mommy but also because the pregnancy did something wicked to my body and I have not been the same since. Not to mention the dramatic weight loss I went through probably messed it up a good bit too. But hangovers were never fun anyways. I do enjoy and appreciate my new found sobriety but a good hard drink is nice to have but only maybe a few times a year because I cannot stand being hungover that much. That and I don't want to be a bad role model for my son. I want to be able to tell when he steals my booze. Geez, I am awful.

I don't like the neighborhood I live in. I feel unsafe and I also feel there should be more sidewalks. Strange things happen at strange hours and the homes are poorly maintained. The leasing agent we worked with while getting this place was nosy and rude. There is some sort of graffiti on almost every building and playground.

Angry Cookies

*2 cups Jiffy mix 
*1 tsp vanilla
*icing that comes in a tube so you can write with it - any color/colors
*1/3 cup soy or almond milk - unsweetened vanilla or plain
*1 tsp cornstartch
*1/4 cup silken caramel flavored tofu - i used the kind made by pete's tofu2go
*2/3 cup sugar or splenda(for the calorie conscience)
*5 tbsp butter, soft

Mix the liquid ingredients with the silken tofu in a blender until smooth. Then mix with the solid/powdery ingredients. Congratulations, you made cookie dough. Grease cookie sheet, place balls of dough on cookie sheet(about the size of a tablespoon type balls). Bake at 350 degrees for 15 minutes or until you think they are done. After baking let cool for 10 minutes. Take the writing icing and write your favorite obscenities on cookies. Yay! Cookie fun!

The reason for needing the health insurance, my baby. Yes, that is correct. I reproduced and spawned me a little minion of my own. A boy minion to be exact. My due date was June 17 but didn't actually have him until July 6 because of my cunt-bag doctor. His name is James Alexander. A week or two after we(my boyfriend, his daddy, and I) brought him home, I was watching America's Next Top Model and noticed that the runway coach is named Miss J. Alexander. Figures I would name my child after a man whom prefers to wear dresses.

As for work, I finally left Simply Wireless and I now work as a security guard for Columbia Mall. Go ahead and laugh. My parents had asked if I met the height requirement when I told them. There is no height requirement for that job, in case some of you were wondering.

Besides all that, really nothing new in my life. Well, I do live in Ellicott City now but thats about it. All I do now is go to work, stay at home with the baby, cook, clean, and occasionally see a friend or two.

She makes me hurt so bad. Stephanie works me hard enough and now I have to deal with Michelle a.k.a. pregnant devil woman. All I can say is I better be a pro by June if I am gonna hurt this much.

Somnuk comes home in November! Yay! I miss him so much."

"event","So tomorrow is my last day at Victoria's. I am so fucking excited. And almost everyone I work with is leaving soon as well. Haha, manager has to hire a whole new staff before the end of the month. Sucks to be her.

I failed to mention last that I will be selling cell phones. Fun stuff.

My feetsies are cold. Oh so cold. So are my hands. Oh so cold.
Hmmm, not much else to talk about. Trying not to be stressed about the sister's wedding cuz I figure if someone is gonna go crazy, someone has to be there to help calm them down. I think I will be that person.

Beaker(the kitty) is a fat bitch. That is all."

"event","Hello everyone!!! Don't really know what to say to start this entry with just for the sheer fact that I haven't posted in a very very very long time. So... lets begin.

New job! It will probably suck just cuz it pays comission but then at the same time I am confidant that I will be sucessful. So please, don't rain on my parade by telling me negative things about it like, ""are you sure you want to do this?"" and similar comments. I got offered the job cuz I am good at selling not because I impressed someone during the interview. So now I get to go to Fairfax for my training for 4 days.

I miss my sister right now. I feel like she is either a)too stressed out from everything to try to keep in touch(which is completely understandable, i had a kitty die before too. it is not fun) or b) just doesnt want to talk to me. I hope it is not B cuz that would make me extremely upset and sad. I love my sister and would be destroyed if she didnt like me anymore.

Finally went to the doctor after being sick for a week. I asked my parents to help me but I really didnt want to because I do not want to be a burden upon them anymore. This also translates into needing to move out and become independent. I would be able to if I made enough money. Hey, that is what this new job is all about. I'm so clever!(sez the retard who wears little dresses with pants, a trend I really need to rid myself of)

The store manager at Victoria's begged me not to leave. But at least I am always welcome back if I choose to go back.

Eh, I guess I am done for now. I'll try posting more often cuz I know how much you kids love reading about me(not!). Love!"

"event","I'm not really much for posting anymore. Maybe LJ has lost its alluring power. Perhaps its cuz I really don't want to talk about my feelings or anyone for that matter. I'm just really tired of me, of life, everything. Done, just done.
Anyways there is a widespread shortage of orange essence cleanser but I was able to find some on the internet and ordered it. Yay for oranges!
Going now to do things. I will post again someday. Maybe..."

Anyway, I hate Psychology and Chemistry- they are evil! Not to mention my Chemistry teacher is a complete IDIOT!!!! I get to go have an MRI done today- yay! I really dont want to, but apparently I have a bone sist (sp?) in my thigh, not to mention all the crap with my knee. I cant wait until the 25th. We have that dance and its the day after my birthday and the day of mine and Wes' 8 month- whoo hoo!  Though I am a little scared to dance because of what happned last time, but I think I can get over it as my knee gets better.  Okay well that's all i have to say! Later!

"event","<P>Hi! Man I never knew before how much I HATE babysitting!!!! I had to babysit for my church on Saturday.&nbsp; Me and my brother and another girl were all going to babysit the kids of the people who were going to the Christmas dinner.&nbsp; We figured that there would be about 10 kids and that it would not be to bad and we were getting paid $20 each.&nbsp; Well I'll tell you- it was not worth $20.&nbsp; Instead of 10 kids there were 20 and we had to watch them for 4 hours and there were no toys for them to play with! The only thing there was a TV with movies that they did not want to watch and some stuffed animals.&nbsp; Usually in a group of kids there is like 1 or 2 trouble kids and when you get them to calm down then everyone else is ok too, well not thind time- oh no! There were 7 trouble kids! One I eventually got to settle down after he was kicking me and kicked my knee out of place.&nbsp; The other 6 were just trouble the entire time and this 1 girl wanted to be held the entire night so I was holding her then her brother wanted to be held so I was holding both of them and one was complaining and wining in my ear then this one kid had an issue with sound and I had to keep taking him out of the room to a quiet place because he was going nuts with every sound and they were throwing the stuffed animals so we had to take those away and we had to take the tables out of the room because they were climing on them and wouldnt get down, then they were running around with the chairs and kept running out of the room because they all wanted water like every 5 seconds.&nbsp; And thats not even all of it but I really don't want to remember anything else from it.&nbsp; That night I actually dreampt about them and woke up at 3 in hte morning because of it.&nbsp; I will never babaysit again!&nbsp; Anyway on to the better things that have been going on, I have an 86 in Physc, though I'm not doing the best in my other classes, I'll have to bring those up.&nbsp; I'm really annoyed because I got up early today to go to school to make up a quiz for Mr. Flamm, but when I got there, he was not there.&nbsp; I got to spend half an hour running around the school looking for him and I couldnt find him anywhere, he told my teacher that he was in the social studies office but I looked there and he wasnt so I'm a little ticked at him and they decided to cut ASL out of the Christmas assembly- which really sucks and we are all mad because of it and we are going to try to get chorus or band or someone to cut out one of their songs so that we can perform.&nbsp; So ya all of that stuff sucks but Wes is keeping me from getting to angry and hitting my head against the wall because all that stuff is really stupid.&nbsp; Anyway ok I really think that I have written enough, especially since almost all of my friends have heard all of it already.

It's really keeping me busy and I'm kinda having a lack of sleep but it is worth it, I actually have a life and I am emjoying it. Oh yea, my daddy found out how old Josh is and is making me break up with him, so now I have to do that next time I talk to him. I think he is in Philidelphia or something right now, I don't really know, I was not here to take his call, but that is what I was told. I really don't know how I kept his age from my daddy so long, but he was bound to find out sooner or later. Now I have to find something to do today. Maybe I can go to the mall or something with De, I was supposed to have her come to the mall with Cody and me yesterday, but it was a really short notice thing that we decided we were sure that we were going to go. Maybe we can hang today, that will probably be nice. Later</P>

We hung out in the zoo for a while and then got some Starbucks and went on the metro again for another 45 min ride. It was funny though because the people on the metro thought that Tory and I were deaf. It was really loud on the train so we started sighng. It's funny how people treat you differently when they think that you are deaf. Then we went to the mall, which&nbsp;sucked because I had like no money to spend. Then &nbsp;yesterday, I got to spend all day with Josh. We had a lot of fun. We hung out at the mall until we met my mom and than we went to dinner and went to some other stores with my mom and then home. So we got to spend a lot of time together. We had fun, it was nice.

"event","<P>Hi. I am pissed. I am so mad at that Heather chic. We are not doing anything in fourth period because we all passed the SOL, so we are all just sitting there adn talking. Well, my friend was having a party in his class and asked his teacker if he could come get me and my friend to come to his class with him and she said okay. So he came and told our teacher that his teacher needed us for something so she said we could leave. Well his class was in the vocational and to get there we had to go around the school, which made it look like we were going into the woods. So then, this bitch (who does not like me very much... at all really) looked out the window and saw that we were going in the direction of the woods and told my teacher that we were skipping and going into the woods. So she sent a message to the principle and some guy came looking for us. He found us in the class room where we said that we would be. The bell rang then so we diddn't get in any trouble just then, then my other friend told me what Heather did, so when I saw her I started yelling at her telling her how it is not right to wrongfully accuse us of that when we actually were doing exactly what we said and she started yelling back at me that she diddn't care what I said and all. (she is sooo annoying and stuck in the elementary school stage). So then we all got called to the office and the principle was asking us all these stupid questions that we obviously were not going to answer. So so far we arn't in any trouble and the teachers found out that we were wrongfully accused so they are trying to get us out of punishment as well. Oh well and theres only 3 days left to that sucks, get in trouble on the last week.</P>

"event","<P>Hi peoples. Today really REALLY sucked! The day was bad even before I woke up. I had an unpleasant dream that woke me up at 4:30 in the morning, then I couldn't get back to sleep because I was so cold. Then I got in the Hummer and apparently I said something wrong because my mom started yelling at me for it- I don't even remember what it was now. Anyway then I went to school and was cornered talking to a girl who I don't really like at all. Then David really pissed me off, and a couple of my other friends pissed me off as well, until they noticed how pissed I was and then they were comforting me. Then I got to go to syco-bitch's class- Whoo Hoo!! (note the sarcasm there). Ya so then I got home and I was on the phone with Josh and I&nbsp;was walking into the kitchen and I dislocated my knee when I took a step. I kinda screamed and fell on the floor whick pushed it back in place. Then I couldn't even stand up for&nbsp;a long time, so when I finally could I went and sat in the chair for a while to kep off of me knee, well when I thought that I would have been better by the time, I got up and went upstairs, just to find out that it was a useless trip and I hurt me knee more by doing that. Then I remembered that I have a big paper that I have due tomorrow on euthanasia and so I asked my brother to go get me my papers so I could start it, but he diddn't want to, so I went up the stairs and got it and fell down the stairs on the way down because my knee hurt so much. So now I'm sitting here writing this while I'm supposed to be writing that paper and I can't get up because I can't move my knee because it is killing me. So ya that was my sucky day, but I suppose I can stop complaining now. Bye!</P>

"event","<P>I am sooooo bored!!! I finished my project for science and now I have nothing to do! Oh well, life goes on. My mom is officialy regreting ever introducing me to Hot Topic. She thinks that I have become all weird and sad and mean and gloomy. She is happy that the summer is coming soon because I'm usually more preppy in the sumer, but I don't think I will this time, or maybe I should just to make her happy at least until school starts again anyways.&nbsp;Well anyway, I don't have any more to say, so&nbsp;BYE!!</P>

"event","<P>Well I was just told something extremely interesting. My mother just told me that if I wanted, I could go live in Belgium for a month as a foreign exchange student. I would be living with a man who works with my daddy and his family and while I'm there, his son will come live here. I was also told that if I can speak french well enough to be a translater, then when I'm older I can get a job at FN and they would set me up with my own place in Belgium for the summer.&nbsp;Isnt that awsome!? I don't know yet when the foreign exchange thing is going to happen, or if I'm even going to do it, but I might.&nbsp;Wow, just thinking about being able to live in Belgium and by myself is just awsome!</P>
<P>Okay, well on to another subject- this is actually kinda weird to me. Josh called me today because he said that at about 11:00 (same time as my lunch) he got some funny feeling and it made him think well somethings wrong so I'd better call her today. Well when he called me, he asked me if there was anything that I wanted to tell him, and I was like nothing really, just that Joe kissed me at lunch as a joke to our friends. He wasn't to fond of hearing that, especially cuz he kissed my mouth, but it was just a joke and I knew that, and so did everyone else,&nbsp;but regardless Josh still wasnt happy to hear it, of course.&nbsp;I just thought it was kinda wierd that he knew that something was up. Well not much more to say so bye!</P>

"event","<P>Okay.&nbsp; I'm happy now.&nbsp; I did get to go to church and I am going back out with Josh- and that makes me quite happy, though my father has absolutely NO idea.&nbsp; I don't think he would be happy at all to hear about it.&nbsp; I'm glad that I got to talk to Matt because he cleared up many of my last questions.&nbsp; </P>

"event","Well, I finally decided what I am going to do.&nbsp; I am going to go back out with Josh- if <EM>he </EM>wants to, that is.&nbsp; Though at the moment I can't go to church tonight to tell him because I can't get a ride.&nbsp; I don't know if he still definately wants to go out with me, so before I tell him, I'm going to see what he has to say first.&nbsp; And your right, De- I am a lot happier with him- just don't tell him that I intend on going back to him.&nbsp; I hope everything works out alright. I hope that I can see him and all.&nbsp; And hey- if everything works out, people won't have to listen to my complaining/bitching stuff and all. Well bye to all. With happiness for a change..."

"event","DAMN IT!!! I am SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO confused!!! I thought I knew what I wanted and what I was going to do, but now I have to start thinking about it all over again!&nbsp; I had decided to go back with Josh (if he wanted to that is) but now I dont know.&nbsp; I dont have very long to decide either, Josh wants an answer as soon as possible and I'm seeing him tomarow.&nbsp; I'm sure everybody is sick of hearing this stuff, but its really making a problem in my stupid little life.&nbsp; It would be a lot easier if I wanted it one way- if I either wanted to go out with him or not- but its not that way, my mind is going both ways.&nbsp;&nbsp;I do miss him and I do still love him and I want to be with him, but I don't want to made a fool of.&nbsp; I dont want him to lie to me or talk about me behind my back and yet still be able to do whatever he wants with me when I'm around.&nbsp; If he really does love me and care about me like he says he does, thats another thing, but if he really dosent care and does so that stuff when I'm not there, then it's a problem.&nbsp; I can't go out with someone who is going to hurt me like that. I don't really believe that he would hurt me like that, but I can't help but worry.&nbsp; I guess I'd better decide soon though..."

Sometimes Long Island seems so boring especially when your best friend falls asleep on key at ten oclock practically every night...cough RJ...Im sure that there are so many things to do but we're just all too lazy to get up and look for those things. I was supposed to go canoeing today with arj and company but obviously due to this crazy ass windy rainy weather thats outta the question. Hmm so last week I went to the pool hall with adam tim kim and brian, saw Wicker Park with Sean, went to the mall & pizza hut with Arj and Tim, and hung out with Robs and RJ yesterday. We saw the girl next door and that movie was so dumb. 

Everything else is going pretty good. I talked to Meg and we're good now. I hung out with her and Kim and it wasn't weird at all. I talked to Christina about some stuff and got a new perspective on a few things. Last night I was driving with RJ to get bagels and we had the best conversations which I was really happy about because altely we havent been talking about important stuff as much. Im just happy with the way things are going right now. My life isnt bad at all and my friends are amazing. If the next couple weeks go as I hope they do things will just get better and better from there. This is the hard part and this is whats gonna change the future."

I know I messed up alot and I know my consequences and I havent dealt well with them at all. I've gone through life thinking that I'll be forgiven for whatever I do and that if I just try my bare minimum I'll get by just fine. Well its not that way anymore. Somehow minimum is not enough and neither is just getting by. I wat to succeed in whatever I do and I wanna give everything my best shot. No more Jenna that waits for things to come to her, or puts herself before other people. I've taken so many people for granted and have even considered myself better than others. That is the stupidest thing ever. Am I such a great person that I judge others because of how they dress and look. I recently talked to someone that I was close with a few years back and what he remembers most was no matter where we were I always found something about everyone that I didn't like. I think its about time I started looking for the things I do like in people and start sorting out the things I don't like about myself. I was reading my yearbook the other night and there were so many people that were like ""I never thought I'd meet someone that was a bigger bitch than me"" and they all thought it was funny. Ugh Ward Melville is so stupid. And now its time to change."

"event","So I never need to drink again. Last night was alot of fun though. Me RJ, and Dave started off taking a few shots and watching Wild Things. Then Robby joined us, then shortly after Meg and Kimmy. By then I was retarded drunk. I called Sean because I couldnt text anymore and talked to him for like 10 minutes which was cool. Then Jeremy and Pete and Dead Society came. I took a few more shots and then got sick. So I was outside sitting in my car with the guys from the band. They brought me water and talked to me and now they are my favorite because they are the nicest boys ever. Jeremy came outside to tell me I was fine and to come drink more so I went back inside and hung out. People started leaving and once again me and Jeremy were the only ones up so we found a bed because daves couch wasnt very comfy and we crashed. We got bagels and dropped Jer off and now I am clean and tired and bruised everywhere...Freaking biters. Ohh there was also a conversation about how Sams cds skip which I thought was funny because I thought it was only me that realized that. I dont feel like getting up yet but I'm going out with Kim RJ and Jer soon which shouldn't be fun because were all ridiculously hung over. Stupid alcohol..."

I don't know whats been up with her but shes being kinda weird, not really like herself at all. Blehh. Sometimes girls are very stupid. Which is why I prefer all male company...and on the note I hung out with RJ, Jeremy, Tim, Adam, and Kim last night and went to guitar center. After we went to Kims and they jammed for a spell, maybe a 2 hour one. After Kim went out with Brian and it was just me and they boys so we went to applebees of course. We ran in Matt Summers, DLang, JKapps, and of course my personnal favorite (ugh) Sean Power. It was umm interesting for all of them to be standing in the same vicinity, and by interesting I mean awkward, so I left them all and sat down far away. OK I lied I sat on the other side of the glass but definetly with my back facing them. After we dropped off Jers car and him and RJ took a ride with me to bring Tim home. RJ of course fell aslepp so we just hung out at my house for a little while then I brought him back and me and Jer actually had a really good conversation the entire way home and even stayed in the car when we go to his house to finish it. Im so proud of myself. Of course I went and ruined it by mocking him about not hating me but ya know Im still Jenna. Tonight me, him, RJ, Meg, Kim and a few other people are gonna hang out. Jers idea was to get a hotel room, talk about setting the mood for an orgy...come on now 6 hot people all in one room. All I wanna do is go to the park, I've had this craving for swings since mid last night. I put 16's in my ears last ngiht and ow it hurts. I thought it wouldbt be that bad. I'm only gonna strech them to a 10, possibly, and I didn't get plugs I go hoops so it doesnt look the same as everyone. I have to preppy a look for plugs anyway. So i'm gonna go call Megggy and make her love me again. This day better get better.

"event","The Evergreen Terrace show was sick. I missed some of Dead Society because me and Kim decided to see Garden State before the show then we picked up Tim and then went. I pretty much chilled by the merch table with Kim, Jer, and Tim while all the other bands played but when i finally ventured out for evergreen I realized I knew pretty much half the place. Those osnas kids sure know how to pack the downtown. Yesterday I hung out with Meaghan and Daina for a little bit and then went with Keri and Billy to get my car back finalllly. I picked Tim up and we got RJ and I drove them to random places. Did I mention that the yoohoo airfreshener that i got at warped tour made the entire car smell terrible. UGH it was almost unbearable. As much as I didn't want to I had to let it go. Soo we went to bird sanc and then we went to sevs and then to visit Christina at work so RJ could act weird and Tim could get his blood pressure and then we went home cause there really wasnt anything to do. Adam called then so we met him at Wendys and proceeded to sit in the parking lot unitl 1230 and it was fun. My mom decided to be crazzy and wake me up at 9. And now there is nothing for me to do because what logical person is awake at this hour..Grr"

This semester everyones gonna be there, I pretty much have somebody I know, and like,&nbsp; in all my classes. After all this time I've been there I still haven't taken freshman seminar so&nbsp;I'm taking it wednesday nights (ughh) with Meg and Kim. Tim drew my tatttoo up last night and it looks so good. Im excited to get it now...its a good thing I don't really remember the pain I was in my other time. This weekend was cool. I saw Without A Paddle on friday with RJ, Dave, Tim, and Jeremy. It was funny I liked it. We went to the bees after and then to the driving range. I honestly don't remember anything about Saturday night. Wow. Im shot. Sunday I went to Heart and then after I dragged RJ,&nbsp; Kim, and Tim to Sarahs house for her birthday party. I never realized how many people that I didn't know that knew everyone else. I think the highlight of that night would def have to be Chris and Tim changing pants in the front yard. Yesterday I finally got to see Megs. She got soo tan. I went picture crazy yesterday and took every picture I have out of every photo album and every box and organized them. It was kinda sad especially pictures from last summer and graduation night. I started the scrapbook that my mom got&nbsp; me for christmas. It looks cool so far. I went crazy and wrote the lyrics for #3 on a page with me tim and stina on it but other than that when its done it should be cool. After that I just hung out with RJ, and Tim till they got tired. I think I definetly need to start looking into finding friends that don't get tired before 2. Mine are fired.</FONT></P>

I went to the Witches Brew twice last week that place is crazy. Its so cool. Last night I went to Fridays with RJ and Tim and I actually met a guy with a tattoo on his ass. It was hysterical. Dead Society is playing with Evergreen Terrace on Tuesdayyy. And Meaghans home. I woke up to Barbie Girl and got soooo happy. I missed that girl so much. Its Sarahs birthday so we're probably going over her house after hearts with a bunch of people. Its almost sad cause its probably the last time we'll all be together before school starts.

"event","<P><FONT color=#993399 size=2>So the past week I've had the house pretty much to myself...along with RJ and whoever else was hanging out with us. VBS is over. It was really fun, the kids were adorable. I was talking to Mrs Gallagher and she wants me to do crafts with her next year which will probably be a lot of fun. The ending thing was so funny. Mike made a slideshow and a movie and you see me acting like a complate fool with 3 &amp; 4 year olds. Its hysterical. After I went to sundevil and met Pete, Nick, Eamonn and Tim there so Tim could get his tat but they were busy so he just got his lip pierced. Friday I saw Alien Vs Preditor with Robby and RJ then I left them to meet Tim, Jeremy, Pete &amp; Nick at Sundevil. Tim got yet another tattoo, its really cool though. After we met RJ &amp; Robby and went to Applebees. Matt Danny Casey Adam Jacob and Joe were all there it was crazy...we really need to find a new place to eat people. Sooo then Pete went home and I drove Jeremy to his house to get a movie and then we stopped at sevs and got beer and went to my house. Jess ended up coming over too so we all watched Fight Club which I have never seen and some of us drank. After the movie Tim wanted to go home so since I didnt wanna drive by myself Jer came with me and when we got back nobody was left but arj. So we just hung out and talked and then RJ fell asleep on the couch so me and jer just talked and then fell asleep at the crack of dawn. I dont remember what woke us up but it was loud and it was annoying. So we went and got bagels and then brought Jeremy home and then took showers and then Jer came back over and then we went to the mall and the bank and Best Buy and then Blockbuster. It was very hectic. So we watched this movie thats supposed to be the prequel to Snatch...it was like stop drop smoking barrells...yeh no clue. I fell asleep for like 10 minutes and apparently missed the entire point of the movie sooo I thought it was stupid. We met up with Adam, Aaron, Dave, and Noelle and went ice skating. Talk about being 15 again, without the broken wrist of course. Then once again back to my house to watch Pirates Of The Carribean. I think I watched most of it then fell asleep on Adam...good stuff. Yesterday me and RJ picked Tim up and we hung out did stuff...went to church, the usual. After we came to my house and Tim made me ravioli and it was good. My mom came home and now I realized why I love it so much when nobodies home....</FONT></P>

"event","The other day I went to Smiths Point with Meg, Kim, and JC and we learned how to surf. It was sick. Hurricane Alex was coming or something and there was this huge rip tide and I definetly got my ass kicked by the waves. But it was amazing and now I am in love with the beach. every part of it. There ya go people. Everyone thats complained about me complaining when we go...Its all over now. Try and make me leave. I went to Satellite after and watched the end of the Louie Giglio thing. It wasnt bad, it probably would have been better if I saw the whole thing. After me and Stine had a huge ass talk on the way to getting Tim, it wasnt over by the time we got all the way to guam to get him a so we continued it with him in the car. It was kinda awkward but things are really good now. She left after and me and Tim hung out and did nothing. Yesterday I picked him up and he was crying like a baby cause he didnt feel good so we just layed around till stina got there and then we went to friendlys to get food. I drove down to the harbor after cause we were bored then we got this idea to go canoeing, well me and christina wanted to not Tim, but it was too late because of the tide or something soooo yeh maybe another time. We met up with Pete who took Tim away and me and stine took Alex to smiths point to go swimming again. It was seriously amazing. I've never been to the beach to go in the water after 6. Yehh it was really cool. After I went home and ay called me so him and John stopped by and I hung out with them for a little bit, then after went to Tims to sit on his porch and talk about his Mustang for 4 hours. This weekend Warped Tour!!!! Me and Christina are driving to Randalls Island Saturday morning and then from there me her and kimmmmmy are going to Jersey. Its gonna freaking amazing. I cant wait to see Petes band play. Annnd yeh thats about it. Christinas coming over soon and then were meeting Mike to go over VBS stuff. Which is next week. Which somewhat scares me. Bleh."

"event","I ended up seeing the village instead of Supertroopers (which was absolutely horrible). After we went back t my house and my mom made Tim play the piano and RJ sing for my aunt. They got food out of it though so they were happy then they helped me pick out clothes for church and they kinda just layed there while I got ready. Tim helped me straighten the back on my hair which was hysterical to watch. Needless to say I ended up putting it up. I got the coolest poem ever and I cant get over how true it is lol. After hearts me Christina and Robby went to my house and then met up with RJ Keri and some other people at friendlys. I droppped Stine off at her car and then I drove Robbys car around blasting FATA for a little bit. It was fun. I was almost sleeping when Tim text me so I talked to him for a little bit and then woke up to Jacob calling at 330...which he should never do again! Since Im not really in to the mood to get into a thought provocing journal entry I'll just leave you with the amazing poem Ms. Leute wrote for me...of course leaving some personal parts out.<3

I made a mix cd of all my favorite songs,
with sappy emo tracks and screaming sing alongs.
With such random choices scattered on the mix,
I feel like its my duty to vindicate my picks.
""Dilema"" is for Robby, and the titles kinda true,
because now that you've hooked up, you don't know what to do.
Tims ""Forget My Name"", although he never will, 
he'd be an awesome friend if he didn't love you still.
I put Room2 on there, knowing you'd get mad,
but a .... Holy shit thats sad.
""Aqueous Transmission"" would be your lulleby,
unless I put it on repeat, in which case you would cry.
I put in a medley of all the songs we've sung aloud,
whether in your living room, or for the coffee crowd.
I put on ""You Gotta Lick It"", I knwo it wasn't right.
I did it for Christina, and all the boys that bite.
The cd stops for a minute and someone yells ""Let's GO"",
we'll leave that part for you, you do it like a pro.
It's 5,250,600 minutes, all on one cd, 
the covers Rico Suave, a lovely sight to see.
Theres a perv section for RJ sqeezed somewhere inbetween,
I know that he would love it, the singers seventeen.
I threw some songs in just to make you smile,
like ""One Minute Man"", I hope Robby lasts a while.
I had to put some Spice Girls on, or Aaron would break down.
The last thing I need is to make a gay kid frown.
I put a few on for memories, hoping you would cry,
like songs from Tuscarora and the fourth of July.
The last track was important, more so then the rest,
It was meant for you so it had to be the best.
I searched for countless hours, but never found a song,
and every one I tried somehow sounded wrong. 
It suddenly occured to me, to leave the last track free,
and once you hear my reason I know that you'll agree.
Instead of just one track, or 2,4,5, or 6,
I named the whole cd ""The Jenna-Take-It-All-Bitch-Mix"""

My grandma really misses my grandpa and she'll be way happier up there then down here in pain. Im going to get Tim with RJ now and were renting SUPERTROOPERS. I havent watched that in so so long and nothing else then spending time with my two favorite boys and a hysteically funny movie would make this day any better. I'll probably go to hearts later with them and then possibly leave with Mae Mae to go to South Carolina for a few days to get away. I need a break so bad. Ok I take that back I have it really good but theres a lot going on. Me and Stina were talking yesterday on the beach and I came to realize this summer has been really awesome but not like fun drunken awesome. I've learned so much about myself and it brought me so much closer to my friends. They really are the best people ever and I love them so much. RJ, Meg, Tim, and Christina have seriousy changed me alot, and for the better. I feel so much better about myself now then last year. I really grew up and it feels so much better then being the petty immature bitchy Jenna that I was. So yeh Im done babbling now...oh and new TBS I looovvvvvvve it.

Then Robby went home and Danny and KC called so me and Kim hung out with them at my house and watched Van Wilder and Kim slept over. We woke up at like 10 so we woke Meg up and went and got bagels. Then me and Megs went to the mall and tried on hoochie dresses and really ugly ones at JCP. Megs was sad so i took her on an adventure we went into sevs to check my balance to see how much I had and there was a miraculous 40$ that was there from nowhere. It was crazy and we were sooo happy. So in the random town of Sayville we walked around for an hour and met interesting people that liked my tattoo and it was fun. Then we went to see if I had more in savings but there wasnt but there was another 48$ in checking again...it was just weird and the government will probably call me today and tell me I robbed the bank bc theres no way I have money. I went home after and got ready for church and met Stina there. It was good...especially when Bert was talking about that person that fishes for compliments and Aaron and Stina look at me and laugh. Come on guys I dont do it that much and my hair really is the best ;) After me and Chrsitina left right away and met Kim and Megs and got food. Then we went to the beach and then the sex toy park then we harrassed the guy at Wendys and ate fries. Tim called me a little while after that and wanted to talk so I went home and called him but ended up going to his house to talk instead. It was the quiestest 2 1/2 hour conversation we've ever had. Kinda weird but whatever. So yeh everythings good now and I only got like 7 hours of sleep which is way not enough. You people have to start calling me after 12 thank you. Yeh ok now I have to go get Tim and I think take him to court?

The other Seans still in Cali till the end of the week. Lucky jerk. I wanna be in Disney. Bailey is absolutely adorable. Except for when he gets all loud and barks too much. My grandmas back in the hospital. This time probably for good. Great more hapiness. I feel so bad for my mom, she never seems to get a break. And then here I am complaining about my friedns being gay and problems with my exboyfriends. Life is so dumb sometimes. This being one of them for me.

It was really boring and hot and I got a little sunburn. My family bbq'd and then I got Jacks and we went to visit Robby cause he was playing basketball and I gave him the sticker I bought him. We ended up seeing Mike and they needed help setting up for Hearts so we just stayed and helped. Saw Jer who is no longer pale! Its a miricle. I made Robby come back and after me him stina and jacks went to bees and ate a lot. We drove back to the church to get my car and then Jackie stole it and her and Christina drove around the parking lot for a million years. I think Stina was scared. And that is the end of my boring weekend...i guess it was kinda fun. I went to breakfast with Jackie this morning and later Im going out with Robs :)Tomorrow is Jackies birthday and Friday Im going to Robbys house for his party thing which is gonna be fun...and that is all."

Not all of it was. I picked up Tim, yess Tim, and Jackie and we got Burger king and went to my house to start practicing for the coffee house thing that is tonight at the church. We did that for not very long and then just hung out till Christina came over. Then came the serious practicing and the serious sucking lol. My God its def entertainment people. So we did that for a few hours then brought Stine to her lifeguarding thing. Vinny came to get Tim for his leagues and then Robby came over to look at the piano stuff and see if he could do it. So yehh we all did that and then me and RJ got Stine and came back againnnn. This time Adam was at my house practicing guitar which I was soo so happy about. They sounded really good but Robbys gay and a huge piano perfectionist so I really dont even know if we're gonna do this tomorrow. So I dont even have a clue about whats going on. I think so far the things that are definite are me stine and jackie doing something and then me RJ, Stine, Tim and Noelle doing something else, which is gonna be cool. Hopefully. We'lll see how it goes. Everyone except Stine and Tim left around one and then we had this really big/long talk/fight. I thought it was good. Then at 230 I drove them home and gave an inspirational speech, it even had a formal ""The End"". It was amusing. So now I have to go on a full day search for piano music which is gonna suck because Im somewhat skeptical...and extremely tired"

So we get there and have to walk like 18 blocks and then wait on a line for like 15 minutes. When we got in we met up with Sherri and her two friends and then like 5 minutes later Bill, Bethany, Mike, Danny, James, and the other Mike and James came tooo. We were standing in the back and I saw Jon from ALFE so like 5 minutes later he was standing next to us and had the same shirt on as Bill so they started talking and I was a dork and was like hey I know you...it was funny though and we talked for a while during the show. Sakuna Coil(?) was ok. The girls voice was good, kinda Evanescencey but the guy was sooo not good. Ruined the songs. Hazen St. was once again horrible. Blindside was amazingggg. Danny, Aaron, James and everyone where going crazy. It was funny. POD was even good. Better than I expected. I spent the whole time carrying Danny gross sweaty shirt that smelled sooo soo bad. At one point he threw his hat on stage and Sonny wore it for like a minute and then put it with the drums, which I think Danny was extremely excited about. Haha. Yeh so it was really fun. We walked back to Penn station and got pizza then everyone else showed up. We were on the train with James, Danny, Mike James, and a couple other people. It was really funny.

"event","So I totally stole this from someone but its pretty much how I feel anyway. I edited it a little bit anyway, not like that matters...


I know it's tough. I know I'm an unlikely Christian. I know I still falter, I still fall. And while your words hurt, they just add fuel to the fire. The ashes have been smoldering over the past few years, but now, they have become a roaring siege, blazing its way through my spirit. You want to see me fail, I know. You can't wait to say ""I told you so."" Well, tough.  I won't let you. I won't fail. I know I'll make mistakes; I know I'll stumble.  But I will always get back up.  No matter how many times I am beaten, I will go back for more, and more, until I defeat whatever is taking me down. 
Just because I've never done it before doesn't mean I'll never be able to do it. Start believing in me. Stop walking away to make things easy; it only makes it more difficult in the long run. Start trusting in me. Stop cutting me down. Start supporting me Stop making me feel like I'm still who I used to be. Start having faith in me.


So besides that not so very happyness things have been getting better and better. Things are getting back to normal with Sean which I am soo soo happy about and me and Sar are cool again. We'll probably talk soon which will make things even better. Tusc is in 4 days. This is gonna be such an amazing weekend and I think we'll all get a lot out of it if we go in with an open mind and heart. From what I've gathered this talent show is going to be soooo so good. And now I gotta go to my grandmas with Arj cause she is once again all sick. Bleh."

"event","Last night my mom was still in Jersey so Jen, Kristen, Robby and Aaron hung out for a little while. We drank a little bit and played Cranium lol. Kristen is possibly the worst team mate ever but me and Robby kicked ass. We got pizza and then RJ came home. Someone brought up how many people me and Jen hooked up with so we started a list which wasn't bad. It was funny. Well kinda. Bad memories...ew. Anyways I got tired around 3ish and so Aar and Robs left and Jen and Kristen slept over. But then I got really hyper and I started bothering Kristen, she thinks Im crazy now, and Jen. Then Jen got hyper and we fought. Haha. I was awoken at like 930. It was really gross. 930 who does that? Bleh. So we just drove her to wrk and now Im awake and bored. I think Im gonna clean my room and wash my clothes. Yesss thats right me clean. I lovvveee my blonde hair <3 ahhh its so refreshing. Everrryone is making fun of me though. Everyone being Jen and Meg. Not so much making fun of me, just reminding me what a bitch I am with blonde hair. Oh well. Its not the hair color that does that, well maybe. Annnnd Im getting attacked by Rj..........."

"event","Blehhh today was sooo long. I woke up at 10 to take ker to teh doctor. After that I hung out with Meg we ran to a few places, ncluding WM where I got to see my brother, and then decided to do a little excersize. That didnt really wrk out though because Meg fainted from dehydration. So her mom picked us up because we got to Guam and then I went to Jens. She got her windows all tinted they are very purty. We went tanning and then went to Olive Garden and then to the carnival!! It was very fun even though we were going on all these rides in our skirts. She started to feel sick so I went home and called Megs who picked me up again. We drove around got starbucks orange oped RJs truck and called Jeff. Jeff Duncan and Alex were drinking at Jeffs so we stopped by and talked for a bit. They wanted to go to the bar so I called JRock and we all headed over there. It was really gross like everyone I used to party with was there it was really annoying and the old reputation was still in their heads bleh. Borella and Duncan were really skeezy. So me and Megs took a break from the bar to go to Zacks house down by west meadow, when I got a phone call which I am <i>extremly happy</i> about. We got to this kids house and Brian, DT, Sawiki, Jackie, Tarrick, Greg and a bunch of other people are all ridiculously wasted. So we hun gout there for a bit and headed back to the bar. People bought me shots but I wasnt drunk it just made me kinda tired. Everyone was getting reallllly annoying so me and meg left and went to Zacks once again. So yeh neither place much fun but a long ass night. Im kinda tired now extremly hungry cause all I got to eat was Olive Garden. It was real good though. Yeh def going to sleep now....&lt;3"

"event","Sooo today was funny. Me Megs and Jen planned this scavenger hunt but that didn't go so well. We filled up some water balloons and drove around looking for the people that were no where to be found. We did see my brother though and Louis at WM so we got them. We went down port for a bit and on the way back to my house some girl starts going crazy on Jen it was weird..so shes yelling in the window calling her a bitch, someone was on the phone calling her a bitch, and it just wasnt very nice. So we get to my house and just as Jens rolling up the windows a billion boys from all over start flinging a million water balloons at me and Meg bc Jen didnt get outta the car. It was fun. After we were soaked we decided to fill more and drive more and get ppl..that wasnt very successful either. Jen had to go tanning so me and Meg got her car and went to the beach and attacked Aria and Jess..we got em good. Then we got money from my dad and went to get hair dye food and stuff. We talked about some stuff that was bothering me and then she made me text somebody and I was scared and it wasnt fun. We headed back to the bizzeach for sunset and got Aria and Jess again, but this time in front of a million people and they were so embarrassed. Good times. Meg just highlighted my ahir and I have to keep it in for another 15-20 minutes...uhhhh I dont wanna. I think Im going to sleep early tonight and then Im going running in the morning with Mae. Fun Fun."

"event","So I was in an incredibly good mood today compared to the past few crappy ones. It started off with watching Pirates Of the Carribbean, which I had never seen before, and the Grosse Point Blank with Aaron and Jackie. They were both good movies. We also ate ice creamw hich was really yum. Funny, we were watching Pirates and Orlandos going on about how he'd die for this chick and I'm all well no guys ever gonna say that about me...when my nice little brother chimes in ""well that cause you're a bitch""...everyone else thought it was hysterical. I think hes stupid. After they left the other Leute came over and we went out all pretty in our skirts. First we headed down to the beach and it was all pretttty then to the church to grab something outta rj's truck then to eat. We went to Mikes fridays and the waitor was hitting on us it was funny...then some guys near us dropped somehting so I decided it was my chance only I thought it would be funnier to just throw a spitball at them lol soooo I was a loser, but they did laugh. Aaron found us there and it was fun. After me and Jen went to Steve Cirillos to say hi and ended up talking forever while I had to pee realllllly really bad. Then she showed me whose number she got today...not a very happy Jenna after that but its ok bc I dont care...right? right. k now im mad. gnite"

I think I have the flu or something all I had today was water and like 5 pretzels but I've been throwing up like crazy and I feel all crappy. I've done a lot of thinking and some people have said this isn't my fault at all, but in a way it is. At least part of it. I did something wrong and I should at least own up to that. Other people of course were a part of this too and whatever they wanna do with it is their business. I hate how this is getting to me though, it really sucks. And Meg and Jen were supposed to call me today and they haven't. Cute. Ew I feel really gross. I wanna get outta here so bad. I can't wait till September. I'm sure there will be drama in S.C. but its really getting ridiculous here. Jackie told me about more people talking shit in Applebees last night. Thats awesome. You people are really getting to me, thanks alot I appreciate it."

Thats between us. Thanks. Also don't talk about me behind my back cough both sarahs eh hem. Its really pathetic and makes you look bad. Grow up and either take your problems to me or just don't say anything...especially when you're around my friends helllllo they are going to tell me. I'm really frusterated right now and I could have done five hundred mean things tonight and started so much crap but I didn't. I sat there and tried really hard to focus on the sermon and not worry about my stupid insignificant problems. I woke up all sorry for myself with thoughts of not leaving my bed when I find out that Ashleys dad died that morning. That got me up. Some things are just more important than drama. How can I possibly feel bad because somebody I care about is mad at me when another one of my friends just had her dad pass away. Anywayyys Mike Brennon gave me this book he got for me sooo Im gonna go check that out."

I'm really mad at him but I'm more mad at myself for letting him get to me like this. Cause I swear I don't like him anymore...right guys? Thats the thing. I am over him as a person but now who do I have to constantly talk about? I always feel like I need that replacement guy to start talking to or get attention from or something and I havent found that yet so yeh I'm still stuck on him. He called me last night to hang out and I was going out already so I couldn't and I'm so happpy soooooo happy because I would have been retarded. Uhh so on a ""different"" note Saline Red is playing tomorrow. Um it'll be fun? Maybe. I doubt it'll be fun for me but uh everyone else will have fun.

"event","I tried to go to sleep like 2 hours ago and I can't fall asleep for anything. For some reason no matter where I was, who I was with, or what I was doing I was constantly thinking about someone. It really got to me, aparently Meg notcied too cause I kept bringing them up and she was gettting fake mad. Maybe its because today was like summer or maybe its because a million old songs played, it could be anything but it sucks. Theres a million questions I have that I feel will always go unanswered and its so frusterating. It was always hard to fight and fix things with Tim for some reason but I never thought it would be anything like that for anybody else. Maybe I'm just really regrettful because I'm starting to realize the full extent of what I do to people. I didn't even go to the carnival, instead I went to the driving range with Meg Rj and Robby. Then we went and ate. It was like last summer only with like 4 less people, the best 4 at that. :( Tomorrow me megs and robs are going tanning and then were meeting rj to go see Van Helsing or whatever...yay for vampire/demon hunters. He won't be as good as Buff though...Then tomorrow nights Burbs birthday partyy! Shes so cute. I got the title for my truck from my dad tonight and me and my mom are going to put it on the road and take care of all that crap on Monday so watch out people I will be driving again next week. Bleh theres got to be a way to fall asleep besides Meaghans recomended 3 caps of NyQuil (gross). I have yet to find it though.

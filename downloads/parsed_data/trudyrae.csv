I got a shredder for Christmas that will also do paper clips and staples and even CD's and have been happily making confetti of all the crap I have been saving for years. Wow is that fun."

"event","Ok I broke down and finally had my brows waxed today and yes it did hurt. But the results are worth it. I didn't cry just winched a bit. Also got my hair cut so I am cute again haha.

"event","We had a wonderful time celebrating the 4th of July. Our party didn't start until after 5pm so had all day to make preparations and get the pool up and filled. The potato salad was a big hit and we decided to do hamburgers and smoked sausage instead of steak. (less dishes to clean) 

We did some minor fireworks in the back yard and I ran around with a bucket of water puting out little fires on the grass haha. It was nice and hot and sunny all day yesterday so our party was a hit. 

We finished at about 11pm and the young ones went out to the country to shoot off the big fireworks that they had bought. Reports are that they had a great time and didn't burn anything down. 

So now I get to clean all the leftover stuff up today before it rains and I won't end up with a bunch of soggy goo to clean up so must get to that."

"event","I forgot that I had to verify my e-mail address before I posted anything so I lost my first post. Not surprising sense I am barely human as it took me 10 tries before I got that question right. I tried both the audio and the sight test and failed over and over. Almost decided not to do this after all but that wouldn't have been any fun now would it."

"event","It took about 10 tries but I finally got the answer to the question and they recognized that I am human. 
I will try to write in here everyday so that I can get used to posting. But I am not sure what kind of stuff to write about. I can think of things about my day but as we all know our day seems boaring compared to anything someone else is doing even if they are just sitting around. 
So this is my first post hope I get it right and don't lose it."

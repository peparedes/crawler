"event","SO my manager mrs johnna offered me the job today..... so i am now the team lead of infants and boys.. i have to get it finalized by the HR person like to find out what im going to be making and all that jazz.. but its 3 dollars more an hour.. tehy just have to tell me it.. its exciting...

i really wanted this job.. it was absolutly perfect for me right now

with matt leaving to santa cruz.. the fact that im going to have every other weekend off is amazingly perfect so i can go see him...
the fact that they are going to work with school.. so im going to have tuesdays off and thursday is going to be my closing day...makes me realllllly happy

and the rest of my shifts are going to be day side.. so im going to have a normal schedule.. i am full time.. required hours.. i dont have to worry about only getting 20 in a week because i will finally have full time status..

im just really excited ..

ever since i got my wireless modem i have meant to go outside and try to use it.. and finally.. forever later im actually doing so.. My room is super hot and i cant sleep so i decided to come outside for a little bit... fun i tell ya.. although im a fraidy cat so i keep looking around like someone is going to pop out of the bushes or something, possibly even a troll.  

a month until my birthday and vegassss how exciting.. i cant wait to wear my funky outfit i bought.. im sure ill post tons of pictures when i get back so beware of that when it happens.. mabye there will be some fun ones to see...

why am i so sccccred... giggle.. i live in a good neighborhood.. i swear.. :)

im scared to find out when matt is going to leave to go back to school.. sounds lame.. but i just wanna know.. i like being prepared for everything....

my mommy bought a new digi cam so .. maybe ill post even MORE pictures now.. yeah i know.. lame.. 

so i cant wait until the next day at work so i can get my promotion .. since my ETL already told me and i just have to wait for my human resources girl to officially ask me.. i just am 'cited :) 

ok all done.. i guess i cooled down.. so im going to bed.. its 1 15 and im tired...  ok

im sad
my boy is gone... im so sad...
its ok.. but still... ever since the first day i laid eyes on him.. the first time i saw him.. ive never had to go 10 days without seeing him... and now.. im totally in love and its gonna be sad.. but i guess i have to get used to it....becauseeeeee

we went down to santa cruz because he had to do a learning plan to get his admission back into that school.. and he found out he has a year left... it goes from september to june.. so 9 or 10 months.. and im worried about 10 days... i guess its just because its the first time he has left.. and also i will get used to only getting to see him sometimes when he goes to school. im just sad.. and happy.. and relieved.. i mean true it could always take longer if something goes differently or he double majors or minors or SOMETHING so its not like im counting on it only being 10 months.. gosh im rambling.. 

the point was to say im going to miss him.. but 10 days will fly by :)
i hope

ok ok byebye

"event","i havent updated in awhile so i figure i might....

yesterday i applied to work in one hour photo.. as a specialist... i guess target is taking over our photo department.. it used to be outside owned.. so we have to staff it.. so up went the postings... its like a level 2.. so its not too much more an hour.. but the hours are good.. they said they would work around school because basically i would make the schedule if i got it there.. just everything it seems like it could be fun.. and im very interested in change.. it was that or applying for AP in Manteca.. and although it might be good for my future.. the fact that i have some sort of experience (not good though) i still dont want to leave.. i know everyone where i work and im comfortable with the managers and stuff.. so i realllllly hope that i get it.. i turned it in yesterday and my HR manager said she would get me an interview today with our ETL.  so.. cross your fingers for me :D

other then that not much is going on.. matt goes on vacation next week.. so the first time without seeing him almost everyday is gonna happen.. but i guess its good since hes leaving and im gonna have to deal with it anyways.. oh well.. have fun in iowa and minnisota (cant spell it) MATTHEW...

ok.. i worked the last two days in the day so i had to get up early and today i wake up and 9 and im mad :) it was my day to sleep in and i got up at 9.. poop... 

ok love you all.. hugs

my love goes back to school on november 17 ( well thats when the quarter starts)  if he goes to the fall quarter which i hope he does...

ill be sad.. but i continue to tell myself that its just a year and a 3 months.. and he will be all done.. at the end of 2006 he will be home free.. cross your fingers everyone..

he went to UC santa cruz and he took about 2 years off and now he is going back... im excited.. way way excited that he is going to finish. but im still sad...

its scary when your so used to seeing someone almost everyday to going to where you dont get to see them at potentially weeks at a time.. but i have 116 days to strenghten our bond even more then it already is :) (that would be kinda hard) 

we are going to be great.. we are going to work with what we have.. and we are going to do whatever we have to ... yes

ok im done.. i know its far ahead of time and i have to live in the moment.. but sometimes.. its really hard to live in the moment when you know in the near future that everything is going to change

love you

april had her baby.. such a cute little boy.. i hope he grows up to be a sweeeeeet one (im sure he will)  i need some baby love so he cant be afraid of me or something.. 

anyways...
work is getting more and more annoying everyday..  i think im going to need to find something new before i go crazy.. just the people and the shit people get away with drives me crazy.. i cant understand why people are the way they are.. and its so angering to not be able to tell people how completly shallow and ignorant and stupid they really are..  PHEW that makes me feel better..

oh and im gonna go see star wars on wednesday .. im gonna be one of those lame people waiting in a line for hours to see it at 12a.m. on wedensday.. the first showing.. well that doesnt cost 500 dollars :)
matt likes dorky stuff like star wars and star trek.. so i guess going the first day is ok.. i definatley would have wanted to see it in the theatre.. so first day it is lol..
fucking infomercials have been playing all night and its MY FAULT  because im not changing the damn channel.. that would take too much energy .. ok not really but im really starting to get annoyed with the stupid things

sigh.. well i guess ill try to go to bed now because if im sleeping im not sad...

im missing something everyone.. anyone wanna tell me what it is so i can be happy again

i have a life.. i have a job..  when i am home im sleeping and thats because im fucking tired
i worked an ass of hours last week and then this week they wanted me to work from 8 pm to 4 am.. i did that two days and i dont know i got ill. i dont know if its because of the hours or because of what i was doing.. but i felt disgusting.. 

i just seriously hate the fact that my brother is so fucking wasting time and space..what does he do.. nothing.. and to call me lazy...  his biggest concern is what time something comes on the television.. or his 9 o clock bedtime.. id love to have it so fucking easy..

am i lazy? maybe.. but at least i do fucking something.. school(woo hoo for christmas break).. work.. and an actual life...

.
so my houses christmas was on the wonderful eve of the carpenters birthday.  
I got off work at about 8 so from there me and matt came here and had christmas with the family.
mom waited to serve dinner for us so when we got here we ate and then we all exchanged gifts 
mommy got me some money.. a shirt.. a cd i wanted and a gift card to get a jacket that i asked for that she couldnt find.
then matt got me some pretty earrings and a ring with my birthstone... which was totally sweet of him <3 <3

some of my friends and i exchanged gifts... which included a frame and some scarfs and some other stuffs (some i dont know yet because we havent exchanged yet) but over all i had a good christmas..
on actual christmas my mom had to work and matts parents invited me over for dinner so i went over there and met his grandparents... it was nice to finally meet his ""other"" family that he has.. they were sweet.

then today i was so mad... i looked at my schedule for today and it said 8 to 4.. assuming it was the morning because i had never worked a night shift like that i get there at 8 this morning (driving a half an hour to get there and having to get up at 630 sucked ass... 
i get there and they tell me i am supposed to work at night im like HUH i work 8 to 4.. they said yeah 8 pm to 4 am   so im totally cranky.. im tired.. and i dont want to work until 4 because then i have to come home go to sleep and be back at work at 430 .. 12 hours later.. blah.. christine is mad when it comes to the beautiful target store.. i mean i guess its my fault for not looking.. but i think part of the reason i didnt is becausei have to work at night on monday.   its like not logical for them to give me overtime liek that considering ill be working 12 hours that day.. but i guess tehy just dont care... oh well.. im gonna finish watching the terminal.. take a nap.. go to the mall.. go wiht matt to exchange gifts and hang out with april and ryan.. then go to freaking work.. BOOO

I love you all and i hope yu got everything you wanted for christmas...

went to the lab yesterday to try to start it and ta da... it was closed .. it closed the 10th.. wouldnt i have loved to know that info...

thank god i got the program at my house to do the assignment

not good that i had to work last night so i couldnt start until this morning...

also  not good that matt had to work at 430 so he left to go to work and i couldnt let him not finish his assignment so i helped him with a little of it... 

and god.. im just so tired of computers right now that i cant believe i am sitting here on one right now...

the only good thing that came out of this .. is that matthew is taking the assignments in and turning them in for us, so that saves me from getting up at 630 this morning... he has to.. hahha.. you win  some and you lose some..

i think today was a little of both...

oh and to top it off.. i set aside a bunch of hours tomorrow to go to school and study for my history final thats on thursday.. so great, today was wasted on school.. and a bunch of tomorrow will be wasted on school.. way to go days off during the hell season at work going to shit.. ok done venting..

oooh ooh tomorrow me and my april girl are going to go see closer.. im soooo excited..

then katiann.. shes making me something (it makes me sad that i dont make things for people) and she mentioned getting matt something so i think that we are just gonna buy her like a scarf and matching hat thing.. yeah.. heather.. sigh i love that girl and i havent the slightest idea hehe.. oh well.. ill figure my gifts out.. la la la

but yeah.. ive been feeling really ick.. like reallly ick.. im usually a lot more happy.. just feel sort of not appriciated.. and maybe i dont do anything to be appriciated.. but id like to think i put people before me a lot and thats not a way to get something back for it. but its now i guess expected.. whatever.. be nice to me im fragile ;) LOL.

but anyways.. i gotta get ready to do this christmas shopping done before work.. wish me luck"

"event","<center>so just like april, i have been lagging on writing in here, so today thats all gonna change 

last weekend was a busy one for me.. so lets start with friday

so i went to aprils at like 9 a.m. (stupid b****) and we were on our way to yosemity.. id never been and her friend from florida alexis (<3) was here to visit and obviously yosemity isnt in florida.. so off we go.. so after being in the car and feeling like i was going to die in the mountains (april learn to drive ;) Kidding) we finally arive... we went around hiking (damn im out of shape) and played in the waterfall and took silly pictures which your gonna love.  it was a good time with some great girls indeed. After yosemity we came home and went to fuzios and i swear there was a so a guy dressed in drag.. ok its mean to point it out and someones gonna get mad at me for saying.. but i swear it was halarious we were sitting right next to each other and she/he was sitting with their back toward us.. we just kept trying to figure it out.. but there was too many signs pointing at the fact that it was a guy to let it go.. anyways.. all done.. then went home and went to bed it was overall a great day.. wanna see??

Then on saturday matt katiann michael and i decided to go to the snow.. we drive and drive and there isnt any snow.. we drive farther no snow.. finally we find just enough to say we found snow.. at dodge.. we played for seriously maybe 20 minutes and headed back home. then we went to flicks and let me tell you i have never been so mad at a restarunt in my life.. they were all laughing at me because i was so mad and just couldnt believe i was being that way.. so  michael talked to the manager and hte manager said they would bring us back and take care of us and that they would call tomorrow.. and can you believe its a week later and the manager never fucking called back.. i really just wish i didnt pay for that shit.. it would have been so easy to not pay considering ""did you ask"" (sorry you would have had to been there) phew i just will never eat there again.. anyways.. then we went to a hooka bar.. it was an interesting enviornment.. its a place were you go and smoke flavored tabacco.  id never been to one of those and it was actaully just a nice kick back enviorment.  but yeah that was that day.. 
ok well i really tried to write in here.. dont hate  me for failing at being intersting.. ok more pics of snow and hooka bar then im out.. peace

"event","ok so seriously, before i go off on my rant.. i have a few notes to self..
1- you are not a concern.. so dont for one second christine think that you are..
2-6.... and 376 are impossible...
3- you are in control of your own life.. and when things happen, just know you set yourself up for them.. ok thanks...


ok now on to the craziest news of my life.. (ok not really but let me embelish) So... Scott peterson is guilty????? are you sure?  Since when in life is it ok to send someone to jail for the rest of thier life, or better yet to death on mere circumstance.  I dont care if 90 percent of me screams and tells me he did it.. there isnt proof.. there isnt anything set in stone telling me he killed his wife, nothing to show me he dumped her body into the san fransisco bay.. only things screaming how did she die.. screaming ok well the entire world knew that he was fishing at that same marina that day.. ANYONE could have put here there.. (including scott peterson and i know that) but anyone.. yes logic shows maybe he did it.. yes logic shows that he had motive.. but my heart.. and my mind tells me without true proof.. proof without a reasonable doubt he should not be spending his life in jail. What exactly did they convict him of?  Killing his wife and unborn child, or being a horrible excuse of a man. Ive heard more about his affairs and his disconcern with lacis dissapearence then i  EVER needed to know.  I needed witnesses.. i needed forensics.. i didnt need to know that scott was a bastard.. because we all already knew that..   talking to people who agree with the outcome of this case amazes me.. because most of the reason why they agree is because of his attitude and disconcern.. not everyone reacts the same way to things.. not everyone in the eye of the world knows the right things to say.. and he did wrong.. he isnt perfect.. but is he a murderer i dont know?? I really hate to live in a country where people can send someone to death over something they cant prove, i hate that people dont open their eyes and minds to the fact that there was reasonable doubt to every peice of evidence the prosecution has.. and i hate that he will rot in jail.  I hate that jurors were dismissed time and time and time again.. and what.. 6 days of deliberation.. then the two get booted out and suddenly in 7 hours they have a verdict when told to start completly over.. what was the hold up the first time.. the 2 jurors they dismissed?? i hate having questions no one can answer.. and most of all

i hate feeling guilty that i couldnt fix it.. 

thanks bye

(sorry i know im passionate over something most people will disagree with me on.. but i really dont think its fair.. and when it comes to subjects like this..it really gets to me) 

*christine*

all i can say.. is if he gets the death penalty.. i will be very disappointed with stupid american people lol.. horray for appeals lol"

class this morning seemed ok.. computer graphics. We had to take a picture and we are going to manipulate it during the year.. fun .. not.. i always feel weird taking pictures by myself.. so it wasnt the best fun.  

Yesterday i had humanities and history post civil war.  and im really excited and history.. a college history course seeming exciting for me is very different.. ive tried taking like 2 different ones and the teachers are so boring that i just end up dropping because i cant take it.. but this teacher seems really cool, he has life in his lectures.. and yeah just yeah.. and humanities seems like it will be a fucking drag.. the teacher seems boring and there arent even desks.. its in the small theatre on campus and shit.. i need a desk haha.. I dont know two of my classes are like big classes like over 100people  each and im not sure if i really like thiat. I think i like the more intimate classes better.  Its nice when a teacher knows your name ;) .  Computer graphics will be fun because matts in it.. wooo.. and because ive always really liked to play around with graphics on the computer.  God im rambling. Im hoping that matt will get the hint soon. He looked over once but he just kept playing.. mean mean boy.  

So yeah other then being happy that school finally started (and a little sad it started too) nothing much is going on.  matt and i are going to see Garden State tonight and go to Sho-mi so wooo to that.  I also decided that tue-thur are probably going to be hard days for me .. reguarding the wonderful thing called sleep. Ill get home at like 130 or so take a showerr and end up getting 4 hours of sleep or so, in order to get to school.  BLAH.. but ill live.. yes yes i will.  Well he just turned the volume up, hes not getting my hint is he :)

ok im done.. ill talk to you all later.. sorry for the boring entry, i just needed something to do...

school starts on monday...  woo hooo.. im ready.. uh huh, i usually dont want school to start, but im actually excited.

blah to matt :) he works during the day all the time and i work at nights so say hello to ""christinethegirlwhorarleywillgettoseeherboyfriendexceptatworkforfiveminutes"" but as i over reacted yesterday when i said bye, that wont be happening again.  Maybe its a good thing.. who the heck knows :) 

Work makes me cranky.. I like my job.. but it makes me veryyy cranky (enough said about that) 

April.. when are you gonna be home... damnit.. hey call me whenever you do so we can all hang out...

blah im not in the mood.. bye everyone

"event","its the funniest thing ever when your favorite dog ever is crawling all over you then decides its time to start humping.. then you push him off and he immediately jumps right back up to hump.. and the cycle of pushing him off and him jumping back on repeats itself like 10 times before he gets in trouble and put in his cage.. but needless to say.. it was realllllly funny..

so yeah my birthday went well.. ill write more later.. gotta get ready for work. byebye

"event","how can you even  wear them (as to say how do you figure them out or somethign hehe) !?!? your supposed to wear panties.. i think its tacky.. because your butt cheeks will get cold.. your supposed to cover your private parts, thats why you wear a bra and PANTIES... it was the most halarious 5 minutes of my morning.. my mom talking to me about thongs.. shes like that with other various things and its funny.. she cracks me up...

anyways.. im sorta down right now.. but definately not out dont worry.. ive just been cranky lately.. and i dont like that.  And then other stuff but its ok..  all i can ask people is to try to stop doing somethign.. right? and all i do is work.. and i dont like that either.. but i have the next two days off.. so that will be fabulous.. i think im going to the fair on wednesday.. and who knows what im gonna do tomorrow.. im a lame ass.. so probably sit on my butt unless someone cool is available for stine to hang out with.. uhh huhhh.. 

if johnna isnt lying.. shes gonna be giving me wednesdays and every other weekend off.. that will be exciting.. because honestly i dont know what its like to have weekends off.. but hey.. its nice.  

my birthdays is two weeks... too bad i dont have any friends haha or i would throw a partay!!!! <3  in fact i dont know what im doing at all for my birthday.. but i guess i have awhile to figure it out.. i wanna surprise.. surprises are wonderful things.. hehe

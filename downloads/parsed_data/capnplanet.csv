"event","Mr Excitement is now 2-1/2 years old, and thus... a toddler.  And thus... the tantrums and the emotional rollercoasters that are the domain of the toddler are a daily feature of our lives.

This can be quite frustrating, and on a few occasions I've found my interaction with Mr E in a rapid downward spiral as I try and guess what it is that he needs to get back on track (being a toddler, he's simply unable to express what is upsetting him).  If I do nothing, it gets worse.  If I guess wrong, it gets worse.  On at least one occasion, he screamed nonstop from the time I was getting him dressed for daycare, all the way in the car over there, and only stopped when he saw the teacher he liked, who was able to distract him into forgetting about whatever it was that was upsetting him.

And as all parents know, distraction is an essential tool for dealing with a toddler.  I sometimes forget this or else I'm simply unsuccessful at using it.  But <lj user=""smokingtoaster""> has a real knack for calming down Mr E.  On several occasions recently, I've simply thrown up my hands at trying to placate him, and passed him over to her.  And virtually every time she has managed to quell the storm in just a few moments.

I don't know what she says or how she does it.  But she is, without a doubt, the Toddler Whisperer."

"event","Last week I voted in my first American election after becoming a citizen in January.  The presidential race wasn't too exciting, but I'm glad Obama won.  I was much more emotionally invested in the outcome of California Prop. 8, which sought to ban gay marriage in the state.  Sadly, it passed.  At the time I was disappointed, but nonetheless afterwards I waxed philosophical about it.  It seemed fairly clear that this was merely a temporary setback for the gay community, and I couldn't imagine that as a nation or as a state that things would still be the same, say, 20 years down the road.  In addition, I later learned that similar propositions have been on the ballot in the past, and it's clear that prejudice against homosexuals is gradually falling out of favor.

Today, though, I'm reading all kinds of news items about protests across the country decrying the discrimination against gays.  Others have pointed out that in a way the passing of Prop. 8 may have been a blessing in disguise, in that it seems it is motivating everyone to say ""enough is enough"", and bringing the issue fully to the forefront of the national consciousness.  I hope that the current economic crisis doesn't overshadow this.  In any event, it is exciting to see everyone putting their collective foot down and standing their ground.

40 years ago, interracial marriage was illegal; now it is commonplace.  Today, the fight is for gay rights, and it seems inevitable that tolerance will ultimately prevail.  Now if America would collectively learn to relax its obsession with religion, I'd really feel like I was living in a nation with its head in the 21st century.  I predict that will be the next major battleground -- one can only hope."

"event","I thought I was pretty smart the other day.  Google has a $500 benefit for take-out food for parents of new children.  To get the benefit, you have to photocopy and fax in the receipts.  The form that goes with the receipts has fields for ""total value of receipts"", and a bullet list that includes a term stating that you acknowledge that the total value of the receipts is not over $500.  I've been saving receipts since our new guy was born, and I decided it would be an amusing diversion to see if I could find a subset of those receipts totalling exactly $500.00 (yes, we definitely went over...).  The problem is probably a good example of a typical Google interview question, and I basically knew how to solve it anyway, so I figured I'd better defend my family honor and just write the code.  And remarkably I was able to get exactly $500.00 out of my receipts.  Yes, I was feeling pretty smart.

So the next day, I went to photocopy all of my receipts in preparation for sending them in to get the credit.  Trying to use as few trees as possible, I collected several receipts per page.  For some of the receipts, I was able to fit more of them on by turning them sideways<sup><small>*</small></sup>.  However, there was a problem -- the photocopier I was using thought it was being ""smart"", and (apparently) when it saw that all the text had been rotated, it assumed that the image should be rotated too, so the region I wanted to copy wasn't right, and some of the receipts got cut off.  We wrestled for a while; I searched through all the settings on the copier but couldn't find anything that controlled the paper orientation.  Plus, for some inexplicable reason, the lid of the photocopier doesn't quite open up far enough to stay up on its own, so as I'm arranging the receipts I'm also holding the lid open with my head.

So, yeah, now I'm not feeling like such a smart guy.  I finally ended up getting the receipts photocopied the way I wanted them, but I'm not sure how I cajoled the photocopier into doing my bidding; I wasted a lot more paper than I should have, and I had to hold the lid open with my head while I arranged things.  So I bet to an outside observer I probably looked more stupid than smart.

I guess it's all relative.

[*] This is another optimization problem like getting exactly $500 from a set of receipts, but quite a bit harder; I wonder if that ever comes up in our technical interviews."

"event","Everyone seems to know about the great (not to mention free) food at Google, but I never really cared much.  Over the years, I've gradually adopted <lj user=""smokingtoaster"">'s point of view that the need to eat is largely an inconvenience which should be satisfied as efficiently as possible.  She dreams of a day when one can bypass meals entirely by simply taking a small pill that would provide all the nutrients your body needs.  This is not to say that we don't appreciate good food; it's just that 3 times a day is way too often.  I think (and I suspect she'd agree) that a really interesting meal perhaps once a week would be more than enough, kind of like going out to a movie for entertainment.  But spending half an hour to an hour 3 times a day?  So inconvenient.

So when people ask me how the food is at Google, I usually have to tell them that I don't really know, because I don't really pay that much attention to it.  But the truth is that there's a huge variety of different foods available, and recently I found that there is a different way I can turn that to my advantage.  For a few years now I've found that my weight has been gradually creeping up on me.  I'm still fairly slight, but I'd really feel better if I could lose 10 pounds or so.  I'm also well aware that my diet really isn't all that healthy; I read the Berkeley Wellness Letter and they're constantly reminding me that I should be eating more fruits and vegetables.

So finally I decided to take this to heart, and I realized that the Google cafes were the perfect place to put this plan into action.  You see, I know I should eat more fruits and vegetables, but when I shop for groceries or cook meals, they either don't seem that appetizing (vegetables) or I think of them as too high-maintenance (fruit -- too much preparation and clean-up, and sometimes just too messy to eat conveniently).  But at Google, they're right there -- no prep, no clean-up, just eat and forget.  It's perfect -- it's lowered the barrier to eating the stuff that's good for me enough (and I've convinced myself that it's important enough) that I just help myself.  So now every day at lunch I make sure I get at least one vegetable, sometimes two, and I always grab a cup of fresh fruit.

So, working at Google is good for me in ways that I didn't plan for and didn't expect.  That's kind of cool.

Here's another way that working at Google has changed me for the better.  I hadn't written a line of Python before I started, but it's one of the three core languages we use, it's very easy to learn and I use it quite regularly now.  One thing that I initially thought strange is that block structure is completely defined by indentation -- there are no begin/end tokens or braces.  Naively this makes a lot of sense, since well-written code will always have indentation that reflects its block structure, so in some sense the block delimiters are superfluous.  However, in practice, the delimiters are actually helpful because they make it easy to see where a block begins and ends.  So at first I was not liking this aspect of Python.  But I had a little Eureka moment the other day when I realized that this is really only a problem as your methods get large; for small methods (say, less than 10 lines), you can visually absorb the block structure from the indentation with no need for delimiters.  This creates a subtle, perhaps subliminal, pressure to keep methods quite short, and I think that's a good thing.  It's not uniformly a good thing, but that's fine because Python doesn't enforce it, it just encourages it.  So lately I've been on a bit of a crusade writing super-short methods, and I'm finding that in general I really like the result.

The other thing I like about Python is that everything seems to be so easy to do.  I can't count the number of times I've sat down to write some little script, and thought ""conceptually this is easy, but it's going to be a pain to actually implement"", only to find that Python has some construct that makes it totally simple, or else someone has already written a library that solves the problem.  If you've written any Python, you might know this; if you haven't, then <a href=""http://xkcd.com/353/"">this xkcd comic</a> will give you a taste of what I'm trying to say.

So Google, in its infinite wisdom, somehow knows better than I do what is good for me, and is helping me eat healthier and making me a better programmer.  There's got to be some good in that."

"event","After almost a year at Google, I'm finally starting to get some schwag.  For a long time after I started, I'd get this impression from talking to people that free T-shirts (nearly synonymous with schwag in my view) were everywhere, everyone had more of them than they knew what to do with, but I couldn't seem to get any.

Last week I finally started to see the light.  Our hardware depot put on a recycling event -- if you returned something previously checked out from the depot that you no longer needed, you got a VIP pass for some silly on-campus event (the details of which are neither important nor interesting), and included in the VIP pass benefits was a free T-shirt.  I had to line up for half an hour to get it, but I got it, and it's reasonably nice.

I think there was a time when the T-shirts were much easier to get; there is actually a T-shirt cabinet on campus where you could often get T-shirts left over from such an event.  There are even signs saying effectively ""be considerate -- don't take more than one"".  However, I've never once seen a single T-shirt in that cabinet -- I think it's a holdover from the days when the company was a lot smaller (long before I came).  Now the T-shirts can still be had, but you have to work a little harder for them.  Watch the right email lists, be prepared to wait a bit, or maybe do a bit of volunteer work, and the T-shirts will come.

For example, a few months ago the Google for Doodle finalists came on campus, and they wanted a big crowd to cheer them on as they arrived.  So -- spend a bit of time, get a free T-shirt.  Likewise, I got shirt sponsored by our mobile search testing group for speaking 300 queries into a blackberry.

The shirts all have the company logo on them, of course -- and that's almost the point in a way.  Google T-shirts are almost a fashion item on campus; every day there are lots of people wearing schwag, and I almost feel like I belong a little bit more now that I can do the same if I choose."

"event","This weekend I went to Home Depot to buy some kind of support system for a listing tree in our yard.  In such situations I typically look for a complete ""kit"" that has everything that I need to solve my problem.  I couldn't find what I was looking for, though, and when I explained my situation to a store employee, he immediately started describing a solution involving cables, something called a ""turnbuckle"", flexible tubing, and other parts.  Basically, he envisioned building a guy-wire system from scratch.  He explained it well, though, and I realized that I'd seen a turnbuckle before, I just didn't know what it was called.  After a few minutes I knew exactly what he had in mind; he helped me get all of the right parts, and pretty soon I was on my way home with all the raw materials I needed to build my support system, along with a clear understanding of how it worked and how to put it together.

I have to admit I was kind of psyched; I've been a homeowner for 5 years now, and I've gradually learned to fix little things here and there, but I'm still pretty green in the grand scheme of the handyman universe.  This was an opportunity to take home-handiness to the next level, though, and I felt pretty confident about it.  I didn't really have time to do the whole project that day, but Mr Excitement was up from his nap and pretty insistent that we do some kind of ""project"" (see my previous post), so I figured I could assuage him by at least starting to cut the cable to the right length, looping it through the turnbuckle and fastening it.

Unfortunately, I quickly realized that another trip to the store would be needed.  Nothing I had in my toolbox was heavy-duty enough to cut the cable I'd bought.  So we had dinner, and then got ready to head out to the store.  I wanted to at least follow through on the project I'd promised Mr E we'd do -- he gets disappointed (read: throws tantrums) pretty easily these days.

I can't remember if we were still getting in the car or whether we were already pulling out of the driveway when I noticed, but in any case before we got the car onto the street I took one last look at the tree, and my heart sank -- I had fought valiantly to keep the tree alive, propping or pulling it up using various ad hoc mechanisms, but this time, sadly, I was too late -- despite having trouble holding itself up, it had grown quite a bit of foliage and had become more top-heavy than usual.  And I guess it had finally had one gust of wind too many; its trunk had snapped and it was lying in a pile on the ground.

Oh, what a disappointment.  I had fought for weeks to keep that tree alive, and just when I was finally ready to fix the problem for good, it just gave up.

And yet, and yet -- because of that tree, my eyes were opened to a whole new way of looking at handyman projects.  I am not a slave to prepackaged solutions to problems anymore.  I can build anything I need from basic materials.  I can fashion anything I want with my bare hands and simple tools.  I am MacGyver!

Well, not quite.  But maybe it's a start."

"event","Mr Excitement has become quite the talker (he's just over 2 now, BTW).  He's also really, really into tools, particularly if they go in a toolbox.  He has his own toolbox, which has a few basic tools like screwdrivers, a hammer, etc.  But that's small potatoes for him -- he can name almost everything in my toolbox, no kidding, so even though he can't recite the alphabet yet his vocabulary includes things like ""vice grips"", ""stud finder"", ""socket wrench"", and my favorite, ""voltmeter"".  (Actually it's always ""yellow voltmeter"", which he probably thinks of as ""yellowvoltmeter"".)

Ever since he started talking a lot he's had this little thing which makes me call him my little robot.  When I go to wake him up in the morning or after a nap, as soon as he gains consciousness, he goes straight into his spiel of whatever thing he's into at the moment.  Like a little robot, you see -- waking him up is like turning on a toy robot that just starts babbling whatever it's been programmed to say.

Anyway, for him, the thing that really encapsulates what he's into right now, including the tools, is ""projects"" -- I think the reason he's so into tools is really that he's so into ""helping"" me with the little handyman projects I do around the house, and those often involve tools.  So every morning when I get him up, he says ""more projects?"", every day when I get home from work it's ""more projects?"".  Today when I put him down for a nap he was upset that he had to do that instead of doing ""projects"".  I assured him that there were projects to be done but we couldn't do any of them because I need to go out and buy a few things needed for them (which was true).  He finally agreed that he would nap and daddy would go and ""buy more projects"".  So cute.  And sure enough, when he woke up after his nap, the first words out of his mouth were ""daddy buy more projects?"".

And I have to say, even though all my projects take twice as long as they used to, they are way more fun."

"event","I went to work in my pajamas last week.

So, one morning last week, after having our sleep interrupted repeatedly by Baby Brother, <lj user=""smokingtoaster""> and I woke up late, and our morning schedules clashed.  I was about to take a shower when I noticed that she was already in there.  Realizing that I wouldn't have time to take one myself, I resigned myself to going to work without a shower (when you're a parent, this is frankly a pretty minor crisis), and went ahead and got dressed, all the while dealing with the various distractions that naturally arise when you have a two-year-old and an infant in the house.  I took Mr Excitement to day care, and then went on to work.

Which is where I realized that I hadn't quite finished changing out of my PJs and into my work clothes -- I had put on jeans, but I was still wearing my shouldn't-be-seen-in-public pajama T-shirt.  At work.  Apparently one of those distractions I referred to was sufficiently distracting that I forgot I hadn't put on a clean shirt.

In the end, it wasn't as embarrassing as it might sound; I rather doubt that there's anyone at work who pays close enough attention to what I wear to notice the difference.  But to me it felt like I was having my own grunge day at work -- wearing a slightly beat-up shirt that probably had been worn a few times since it was last washed.  I doubt anyone really noticed, but I felt just a tiny bit gross about it all day."

"event","I took Mr Excitement to the park today.  We go fairly regularly, and he's always been a little unfocused, which is fine.  It just means that instead of going up and down the slide a gazillion times or playing in the sand, we just end up meandering around the park exploring everything there is to see.  Girls warming up before a soccer game, a pine cone that hasn't opened up yet, steps to go up and down, grass to run on, boys playing basketball, airplanes in the sky, helicopters in the sky, birds in the sky, trash on the ground, cars of many different colors, talking to daddy, talking to other grownups, talking to other kids, talking to himself...

It reminds me of the Sunday Family Circus comic, where there would often be a single panel with a bird's eye view of a large landscape and a dotted-line path of one of the kids as they went from one end to the other, stopping or taking a detour every two steps as everything on the way was patiently discovered and examined to as much depth as seemed necessary.

Now this hasn't made me a fan of the Family Circus, but parenthood just changes the way you look at everything, and if nothing else I can now at least appreciate its point of view.  In any case, I'm really glad that my son has developed the ability to ""smell the roses"" -- there's no agenda, we just go to the park and see how things unfold; he loves it, and so do I.

I think <lj user=""smokingtoaster""> and I agree that on the whole we are very lucky; he is a pretty happy kid, he behaves pretty well most of the time, he is a truly awesome sleeper, and he is just a lot of fun to play with.  As he's matured and his speech has developed, we're both really amazed at what an incredible joy it is to watch it all unfold.

What's just a little sad about all of this is that while <lj user=""smokingtoaster""> and I no doubt will have many fond memories of this time, Mr Excitement will probably forget virtually all of it.  I certainly don't remember a single thing from my toddler days -- do you?  The only things I know of from that time are things my parents and relatives have told me, and while they're mildly amusing, they don't really mean much to me, because it feels as though they happened to someone else.

I guess the consolation here is that it won't really matter that he won't remember any of this; eventually he'll be old enough to form permanent memories, and then we'll share some common experiences.  I can only hope that those times will be just as amazing as the times we're having now."

At first it disappeared from Safeway, so I would make special runs to Raley's every once in a while and stock up (I really like this cereal!).  But a few weeks ago Raley's also stopped stocking it.  So I figured I better go online and find some other stores where I might be able to get some.

Which is what I did this morning.  I picked a couple of other grocery stores whose names I knew, and found nearby locations.  I also looked up some locations near work.  But somehow this seemed like an indirect way of finding what I wanted, and it finally hit me -- why not go to a website for the thing you actually want, and see if you can find out where they sell it?

And lo and behold, the <a href=""http://www2.kelloggs.com/"">Kellogg's website</a> is totally awesome.  In just a few clicks I'm on the Complete Wheat Bran page, and I can enter in my zip code and found out where <i>just that product</i> is sold.  OK, whether they honestly have availability information at that granularity might be suspect, but it's significant that the Safeway stores in our area don't show up, even though I'm sure they sell at least <i>some</i> Kellogg's product.  Disappointingly, the Raley's do show up, but maybe that's just because the database is out of date.

The web is amazing.  I can't imagine how difficult it would be to get that kind of information before we had the web."

So <lj user=""smokingtoaster""> and I were lying in bed yesterday morning, waiting for Mr Excitement to wake up.  Somehow the conversation drifted towards orchestral instruments, in particular the bassoon.  I have a life goal of learning to play all the wind instruments, but the bassoon is probably last on my list; not because I don't like it, but because it's probably one of the more difficult ones.  But <lj user=""smokingtoaster""> is not a big fan; she's a brass player, so wind instruments are already somewhat low on her totem pole, and she just thinks the bassoon sounds funny and doesn't have an useful role to play in the orchestra.

Anyway, knowing that she likes to contradict her good-girl image to comic effect by using vulgar language and scatological imagery, I asked her how she would describe the sound of the bassoon.  I guess she was still a little sleepy though, because (atypically) she didn't respond right away.  I was a little more wide awake, and I know her schtick pretty well, so I decided to try my hand at it, saying ""well, you have to imagine a very large duck, with a diarrhea problem"".  This got quite a good laugh from her, but not to be outdone, she responded with ""no, you have to imagine a very large duck, choking on its own diarrhea"".  Which basically left us both helpless with laughter.

I was going to comment that maybe having kids makes you appreciate childish humor more.  But the truth is, for better or worse, we've always found stuff like that pretty funny.

"event","Mr Excitement is big on labeling things, but his vocabulary is still kind of small.  So he frequently (to our confusion) calls many things ""Dada"" and ""Mama"", because those are words he knows how to say very well (and he loves to talk, so words he knows well get used a great deal).  Usually there's some rhyme to his reason, though; he'll use Dada or Mama to label something that has an association with that person.

One great thing about this is that he frequently sees me working on little handyman projects around the house, and those of course get labeled ""Dada"".  Consequently, I get regular reminders of the shelf I installed over the piano, of the burnt-out light bulb I replaced, of the newly-mown grass, etc.  Of course I also get reminders of when I knocked over a box of cereal, spilling it all over the floor (yes, every time he sees a box of Cheerios I get that one).  But I can live with that -- the label is usually accompanied with a big smile and often a laugh.

Anyway, it's kind of like having my own personal fan club following me around.  ""Look -- my daddy built that shelf!"".  ""Look -- my daddy does the laundry!"".  I'm amused, not to mention flattered.  Thanks for the props, Mr Excitement."

How it happened:

I was ahead but I could see Larry coming up behind me, staring me down, trying to catch up to me before the hilltop sprint finish line.  I redoubled my effort, straining to give everything I had.  As I got closer to the flag, he pushed harder, but so did I; as I neared the line I could see he was getting closer to me, but I was getting to the line faster than he was catching up.  With a final desperate lunge I pushed my front wheel over the line, with Larry just a wheel behind.

How it actually happened:

Riding to work on Friday, as I neared the top of the Dumbarton bridge, I could see another rider in my rear-view mirror.  I could sense (as type-A's often do) that he was challenging himself to pass me before the city limit sign at the peak of the bridge (an impromptu private sprint of sorts).  I made my own private challenge to make it to the sign first.  He appeared to be riding in a very high gear (a hard-core training trick), but I made no such concession, using all of my gears to their optimum benefit.  I pushed harder and kept ahead of him past the sign, though shortly after reaching the top I slowed down, worn out by the extra effort, and he passed me and sped off down the hill.  As he went by I took a look at him and I'm pretty sure it was Larry Nolan.  By the time I reached the bottom at the other side of the bridge, he was halfway to University Ave. and I could hardly see him.

Even if I have a 5-minute head-start, it's kind of cool to beat Larry in a sprint."

"event","Since blogging about the <a href=""http://capnplanet.livejournal.com/26800.html?nc=8"">mystery cereal at Google that looked like Vector</a> a few weeks ago, there have been many developments, and I've essentially solved the mystery.

As you may recall, a few other googlers had tipped me off to Smart Start, but I quickly put an end to that line of inquiry after bringing home a box from the local grocery store.

Or so I thought... it turns out that there are several varieties of Smart Start, and I had picked the wrong one to do my comparison with.  In fact, I brought home two varieties from the store, had tried the first, and when there was obviously no match, I simply assumed that the other variety would fail too, but I was wrong.  In fact, the second variety (the ""original, with antioxidants"" was an exact match.  So that answered some of my questions in an instant: the cereal in question is indeed Smart Start (original with antioxidants), and how it could end up at Google is no longer a mystery since it's readily available locally.

This still left one other big question -- is Smart Start just Vector in a different box?  To answer that I had to wait until my coworker returned with a box of Vector straight from Vancouver.  She only moved from Canada to CA last summer so is just now beginning to understand the subtle differences between foods available here and there and had also become very interested in the whole mystery.  Breathless with anticipation, we got two bowls from our microkitchen, opened, poured, and sampled.

The results were interesting.  Though the cereals are very, very similar, they are not the same.  The texture of the flakes is similar (in both cases, noticeably thicker and substantial than the typical breakfast cereal flake), but they are slightly different in color.  They also taste slightly different.  The little clusters are also similar-looking but distinct -- Vector's seems to include some sort of little rice puffs while Smart Start's clusters are all oats and nuts.  So -- pretty conclusively not the same cereal.  But I suspect that apart from cereal professionals (and though that I might consider that another dream job, I am currently just a hobbyist), only in a side-by-side would the average cereal junkie actually be able to tell the difference.

So while I still can't get Vector in California, I can get something that's so close I probably won't even care about the difference.  Who knew -- my favorite cereal, and I've probably walked past it in the aisles of our local grocery store hundreds of times without even realizing it."

"event","On Wed. night when I got another email from our daycare provider (or her husband), I decided I had to do something.  So I drafted a response to the email as follows:

DayCareProvider/Provider'sHusband -- these are cute, but I already get more than 100 emails a day at work.  I'd rather not get any more than I really need to at home.  Would you mind removing my email from your list?  Thanks,

Wisely, though, I didn't send; instead I got <lj user=""smokingtoaster""> to weigh in before I clicked that button.  I could tell from her reaction that while it was acceptably light, she still wasn't entirely sure it was the best way to put it.  In the end I decided not to send it and instead to just talk to our provider in person.

So Friday morning I casually mentioned as I was leaving after dropping off Mr Excitement that I assumed she had added my email to her mailing list and that I got lots of emails already and would she remind removing me?  She said she thought she might have added me, and sure, she would remove me.

So that felt pretty good; I made about a small a deal about it as could have been made, I think (save for doing nothing at all).

When I got home in the evening, I found that our provider had asked <lj user=""smokingtoaster""> (who picks up Mr Excitement at the end of the day) to return the favor and remove her from our ""mailing list"".  This perplexed me, because in spite of the fact that we now know their email address, we've never actually used it.

But I have a theory about what is going on here.  Most of the people we know use email as a communication tool -- it's an alternative to a phone call, for example.  We've almost grown up with email and have a mutual understanding about when to use it and how.  But our day care provider is from a different... technological circle.  For her, I think, email is useful only (or primarily) to send silly stuff to all the other people in your address book on a regular basis.  That's the best explanation I can think of for why she asked us to remove them from our ""email list"" even though we've never sent them anything, and indeed don't have anything like a distribution list as they use it.

Either that, or my computer has been hijacked by a bot-net and we <i>are</i> sending them spam now that they're in my address book.  I really hope that's not the case, but I've always wondered (apparently these things are sometimes very hard to detect).  Then again this would have hit everyone else whose email addresses we have (including all of the handful of people who read this blog!), and I'm sure I would have heard about that before, so I guess that's probably not the case.

Anyway, for better or worse, I think the problem is solved; I don't expect any more emails, and I don't think I've hurt our relationship with our provider in any meaningful way."

"event","Last week I gave our email address to our daycare provider.  (She asked for it after I mentioned our website where we have many photos of Mr Excitement, who she's taking care of).  Not long after I gave it to her, I started receiving regular emails of the ""pass this on to all of your friends"" variety.  You know -- the kind with lots of images, lots of words in big color fonts, lots of indentation because they've been forwarded many times, and pretty much absent of any useful, interesting or amusing content.  They're either forwarded by her or her husband (it seems like they share an email account, which already tells you how net-savvy they are).

I could deal with this in a number of ways.  The simplest would probably be to filter them; I wouldn't see any of their useful mails, but I don't think they use email for that purpose anyway.  So essentially no loss there.

But I'm a bit of a stickler for doing the ""right"" thing, and somehow that feels wrong.  I'm not interested in getting on my soapbox and telling her that this is bad netiquette.  But I also don't feel I should encourage net traffic (not to mention waste disk space on my own machine) for stuff I have absolutely no interest in.

I've heard it said many times that although lying is obviously bad, a little bit of lying sometimes helps more than it hurts.  If she asked me I would certainly say I didn't want those emails, but I doubt that she will ask me.  But if I junk them and say nothing, I'm effectively lying because we both know that she's sending those emails and by tacitly accepting them I'm basically saying that I do want them, or at least I don't mind getting them.  On the other hand, it might be a bit awkward telling her that I don't want this stuff; it obviously means at least something to her or she wouldn't have gone out of the way to add me to her list, and she might begin to wonder how many other people she's also annoying.

What would you do?"

"event","This whole post is essentially a rant, so if you're rant-averse... move along.  Nothing to see here.  If not, continue.

I went to Wal-mart yesterday to buy new wiper blades for both of our cars.  My first beef is that in general, you can't actually replace the part that wears out on the wiper blade, namely the little rubber insert; you have to replace the entire wiper.  Seems like a senseless waste, though I can see that perhaps it's mechanically less error-prone to replace the whole assembly and thus for the manufacturer, more cost-effective because they probably have to deal far less with returns, etc.  It's also quite possible that other vendors sell just the inserts; please correct me if I'm wrong.

Anyway, there's a handy catalogue in the wiper-blade section; you look up your make, model and year and it tells you what part number you need.  Well, sort of.  Actually on the surface it appears to be quite helpful; once you've narrowed down your requirement to make, model, year, and which wiper (driver side, passenger side or rear), you need to read one line of the catalogue which tells you the part number for about 10-12 different manufacturers of wiper blades.  Of course all the wipers look exactly the same, so the only way to be really sure you've got the right one is to get an exact match between the catalogue and part number (for any of the manufacturers).  And of course -- have you ever noticed this? -- in such a situation, there will always be at least three numbers on the package that look like they might be a ""part number"", and exactly zero (0) of them will match up with what's in the catalogue.

After scratching my head for a while I realized what's really silly -- every part number in the catalogue has essentially the same form -- it's some alphanumeric string followed by a dash, followed by a number, and that number is the same for every manufacturer.  And guess what?  That number -- it's the length of the blade.  So my second beef is -- why not just show for each make, model, year and position what length of wiper you need.  Every manufacturer can then just print the length of their blades on their packages, and the whole process would be much simpler.  That is exactly what I ended up doing -- when I finally realized that all I needed to know was the length of blade I needed, I was able to quickly find what I needed.

Anyway, my third beef is there is an embarrassingly amateurish bug in the software used to generate the catalogue.  Each line represents a range of model years for a particular year, make and model of car.  And the programmer who wrote the code to generate the catalogue actually reversed the order of the years in the range.  So for example, one line might read ""Corolla 2006-02"".  And maybe the next, ""Corolla 2001-96"".  Yeah, you can bet it took me a little while to sort that nonsense out.  I'm just wondering how long that bug has been there and whether it will get fixed with the next catalogue.  I'm guessing there's a 50-50 chance it doesn't.

One positive note -- I ended up buying seven items, and I was astonished to get a receipt that was maybe 6 inches long.  Contrast with e.g. Lowe's or Home Depot where you buy one thing and your receipt is about two feet long.  I'm estimating, but not by any means exaggerating, and this happens all too often.

Okay, done ranting.  Carry on with some more upbeat reading material."

"event","We've been trying to teach Mr Excitement how to feed himself using utensils for a while now.  Not aggressively; we've merely been offering him the utensils every once in a while, maybe giving him a little help in using them, and then just leaving him alone with the utensils to see if he was interested in them.

About two weeks ago, he was ready.  One day he just decided that he was going to use a spoon to eat his breakfast (oatmeal, then cheerios in milk), and since then there's been no looking back.  Now he his adamant that he wants to do this himself; if we try to help him use the spoon he gets quite upset.  He clearly enjoys being able to do this on his own.  And when that last cheerio is consumed, leaving only a pool of milk in the bottom of the bowl, the cry of excitement can be heard throughout the house.

It never ceases to amaze me how quickly something like this can change in your child.  It's as if a switch was suddenly turned on, and instantly the time when we had to spoon-feed him is gone.  It's cool, but I feel just a tinge of sadness too -- it's odd that this behavior that was so familiar is now suddenly just a memory, never to return.  (Of course it will come around in a while again with the new baby, but that will pass too.)  We're eager for him to grow up, and every little change like this is a step further along, but every time something changes it also feels a tiny bit like something is lost.  I guess I don't know quite how to put my finger on this feeling.

Anyway, the fact that he mostly feeds himself now is liberating.  Now when he eats breakfast I get a little bit of time to get some things done.  And time to get stuff done is something that's very precious to everyone in the family these days..."

"event","Back in 2000, <lj user='smokingtoaster'>, and I joined <lj user='turtle_head'>, <lj user='sirmonkeypants'>, <lj user='barky_shark'> and <lj user=""the_rar_guy""> at the Toronto International Film Festival.  A tremendous time was had by all, too many details to go into here.

One morning <lj user='sirmonkeypants'> was entrusted with the task of going out and bringing back some cereal so we could all have a cheap breakfast in our hotel room.  At the time I was doing graduate studies in Math, and with this in mind, when SMP noticed a cereal called 'Vector' on the shelf of the local convenience store he simply couldn't pass up the chance to get a laugh out of a cereal obviously named for a math geek (of course everyone concerned knows, or at least knew at one time, what a vector was, so I'm sure he knew we'd all have a laugh).

Well, we did have a good laugh, but I didn't laugh for as long as everyone else, because as soon as I started eating, I realized I had found <i>the best cereal in the history of the universe</i>, and I totally didn't care about the joke.

Sadly, as I soon found out, Vector was available only in Canada (and remains so to this day).  So in order to satisfy my Vector fix I have had to resort to stuffing boxes of Vector in my luggage or taking then as carry-on whenever I return from our occasional trips back to Canada.

Anyway, fast-forward to 2008.  I was feeling a little hungry the other day at work, and decided a small bowl of cereal would be just the thing to tide me over to lunch.  So I walked down to the microkitchen and checked out the available cereals, and noticed something that looked like flakes plus oat & nut clusters -- I didn't recognize it, but it fit the template of the kind of stuff I like, so I poured, added milk, and headed back to my desk.  But as I ate I quickly realized that it tasted a lot like Vector -- so much so that I decided I had to do some investigation to find out just what I was eating.

In the cupboard under the counter where the cereal was stored in glass containers was a large bag of the same cereal.  It said Kellogg's on it -- another clue -- but had no other identifying marks.  I posted to our misc mailing list and asked if anyone else knew, and a couple of people suggested Smart Start.  I was intrigued, so I took a sample of the mystery cereal home to do a comparison test.

On the weekend I bought some Smart Start, and while it's similar, it's definitely not the same.  So the mystery remains unsolved.  Adding to the suspense, the mystery cereal has now disappeared from the microkitchens, replaced by (I think) Raisin Bran Crunch.  But I still have some of the sample, which I'll retain until I can get an actual box of Vector (hopefully fairly soon before the sample goes stale).

A co-worker who had heard my story informed me today that at the microkitchen near one of the cafes in a distant building I've never been to has numerous cereals, all of which are labeled.  So next week I'm going to make a trip out there to see what they've got.  Failing that, though, she has offered to bring me back some Vector when she goes to Vancouver next weekend.  So with some luck I'll at least be able to decide whether or not it's Vector fairly soon.  If not, I'm not sure what my next step will be.  If it is... I guess I'll have to see if I can find out how Google managed to get a cereal in California that's supposedly only available in Canada.

But I'm getting ahead of myself... I'll post more when I get more information."

Of course this post will now appear when I do the same thing next year -- a little bit of self-reference for the geeks in the audience.

January: Every once in a while I entertain the thought of starting a blog where I simply document all of the crappy stuff I seem to buy which either doesn't work properly or works for a short while and then breaks.

February: One of the funniest diversions I've found on the web recently is the Best of Craigslist.

March: Sometimes if I get bored while riding my bike, I amuse myself by doing a Fermi calculation.

April: (Is it just me...) ... or is LJ just mind-numbingly, bone-crushingly slow these days?

June: Check out The 30-Second Bunnies Theatre Library

July: A few years ago, I blogged that my dream job would be to work at Google.

August: This really made me laugh -- it's Edgar Allan Poe's The Raven, compressed to its essence in the form of a limerick:

September: So, I started my new job at Google last week.

October: Calling IKEA the other day to check if something is in stock, I had a conversation something like the following:

November: I've been aware of greasemonkey for some time now, but never really paid too much attention until this week.

December: Back in the Sidekick days, barky_shark would occasionally write about celebrity sightings in NYC.

Observations: I'm quite the whiner (but I knew that), quite the geek (ditto), and I have my own share of 'check out this thing I found on the web' (web being my obsession corresponding to your TV obsession). I'm also disappointed that none of my first-of-the-month posts involve Mr Excitement, but that appears to be just a coincidence.  Also, no mention at all of cycling -- another sign of the times."

I now weigh 174 pounds.

To put this in perspective, this is almost certainly the most that I have ever weighed at any time in my life.  I've been as low as 145 as an adult, and my ideal weight is probably around 155-160.  Before I started at Google I was making at least some effort to watch my weight and was in the low 160s.  So I guess I've more or less put on the infamous Google 15.

Someone did a demo to our group at work showing how it could be used for rapid prototyping of experimental changes to our search page.  Pretty neat, definitely useful at work, but still...

But then suddenly a light bulb came on and I put two and two together.  I'm responsible for entering all of our cycling club's ride information into the database every week, which involves filling out a web form for each ride.  Sometimes that means using the form 20 times in a session.  Unfortunately the form is not formatted very well from a usability point of view.  The simplest example is that the first form field does not have the focus when the page loads.  So instead of typing as soon as the form loads, I have to grab the mouse and click in it, or tab from the element that is in focus until I get to the field.  A small annoyance, but I work hard to do as much as possible without using the mouse (the keyboard is much faster and the mouse is the biggest contributor to RSI), so not having that field in focus at the start is a small but frequently occurring annoyance.  I could ping the webmaster and have him fix it, but he's very busy and and probably wouldn't get to it in a while.

Enter greasemonkey, which basically allows you to attach javascript code to a page, triggered by URL patterns, that is run after a page loads.  Having never used it before, I installed it, read a bit of online documentation, wrote a script (one line), installed it, googled for a bit to find out why it didn't work, found a page with hints, fixed it (now the script is three lines), installed again, and it works.  Bingo!  The whole thing took less than 30 minutes I think.  It'll be some time before I get return on my investment in time, but if I factor in the reduction in annoyance level I'll probably have earned back my investment before the end of today.

I didn't give it too much thought at the time; it was a reasonably inexpensive costume and it fit him well enough while having enough room to last until next Halloween, so we bought it and we were done.

This is fairly upsetting to me.  It's not a 'promotion', it's <i>advertising</i>.

"event","So, I started my new job at Google last week.  Many people have asked how it went, and my standard response is that I've spent the week going to a lot of training sessions and playing with some new toys, so it's not much to base an opinion on, but as far as that goes it's pretty good.

I actually started making a list of pros and cons whenever inspiration arose; it's probably a somewhat biased list, and again, it's based on a very non-representative week, but it's probably a good barometer for gauging my feelings about the job.

The biggest con is that I don't have a cubicle per se.  I have my own desk and hardware, but the status quo at Google appears to be large open spaces with several developers grouped together (which is where I ended up).  It's not what I would have preferred, but since it's basically what everyone gets, I'm OK with it.

Somewhat less important, but still disappointing, is that the free shuttle doesn't really come close enough to where I live to be useful to me.  Granted, the fact that there is a free shuttle at all should be viewed as a pro, but I knew about it before I came here, and had hoped it would provide some relief for what is still a less-than-ideal commute.

And the commute itself is certainly no better than at my previous job.  However, it doesn't appear to be a lot worse, if at all.  This week I've been going in slightly earlier than I probably would normally, but even at my normal time (just after 9, when the metering lights stop and the carpool lanes open for everyone) the route I'd like to take (880 South followed by 237 West) is still horribly jammed, so I have no choice but to take the Dumbarton and pay the $4 toll every day (as I did when I drove to Oracle).  There's a bit more city driving, but all in all it seems to take about the same length of time as it used to, so I guess that's bearable.

So, what about the pros?  The first day was orientation, and I met a number of really nice people, which just left me with a kind of nice vibe.  Orientation itself was actually pretty good -- it never got boring, which itself is impressive.  And there was an enthusiasm as well as an obvious commitment to excellence which was pretty infectious -- by the end of the day I was already really caught up in the whole culture and looking forward to contributing to it.  When orientation was done I met my mentor, who took me to my desk, where my desktop machine was already waiting for me, with a freaking <i>huge</i> monitor.  (OK, it's a 32"" flat panel, maybe not so enormous, but certainly substantially bigger than anything I've used before).  A nice little surprise.

Of course the free food is a well-known perk of working at Google.  On that I'm actually kind of neutral.  The food <i>is</i> free, and there's lots of variety, but at the same time I haven't really found a lot of things that I'm really excited about eating.  Maybe my tastes have become too narrow, and if so this will be a good time to experiment more.  I used to bring a sandwich from home every day and eat it at my desk, but although it wasn't exactly exciting, I liked the fact that I wasn't forced to break my concentration or train of thought just because I was getting hungry.  And while a hot lunch every day is certainly more interesting, I'm also a little worried that if I'm not careful I'm going to easily put on a few more pounds that I don't really need.  I'll have to see how that all pans out -- I can't imagine going back to sandwiches every day, but I do find that spending 30 minutes or an hour to eat takes a bigger chunk out of my day than I'd really like.

Two of my favorite pros were both completely unexpected.  One is that there are community bikes available for getting between buildings.  I don't expect I'll use these a lot once all of my training is done, but it seems that a lot of the orientation training sessions are in another building.  It's probably a three- or four-minute walk, but on a bike it takes less than a minute.  A really nice touch, to my mind.  The other is that there appear to be guidelines for coding style and readability which are fairly strict and thoroughly enforced.  I was really pleased when I found out about this, and even more so when I found that some of the basic rules fit exactly with my style (e.g. 80 column max, no tabs, two-space indent).  I'm kind of a nitpicky style zealot, so this was a nice little surprise, particularly considering some of the awful code I had to read and maintain at my previous job.  (We'll see how much the reality conforms to the ideal I saw in the presentation though...)

There are some less concrete things that seem really good too -- there seems to be a real sense of community, of a willingness to share information, of pride in one's work, of a belief in the value of what the company is doing and that it is good at doing it; and of course everyone seems to be really smart.  I remember on several occasions after seeing some high-level process described that 'this is the way everyone knows it should be done, but no one ever actually does it this way'.  Here (at least naively, from a ""Noogler's"" perspective) things seem different.  And I guess that's how I would sum up my first week here -- I'm generally a very skeptical person, but it's like the brainwashing has thoroughly sunk in.  I had a good feeling that working here would suit me well, but it seems even much better than I imagined -- if I'd known what it was really like here, I think I would have been much more proactive about getting in.

So that's my take after one week; I'll probably post again after a couple of months when I'm actually knee-deep (or deeper) in some real work, to see if the reality actually lives up to the first impression."

"event","My commute route only has about 6 traffic lights on it, and lately I've gotten into the habit of tracking how many of them I have to wait for as I ride.  And under ideal conditions, I intuitively guessed that I should get a green about half the time.  I decided to see if I could make this more precise, and so I naively conjectured (ignoring the obvious symmetry of the problem) that in fact my odds of arriving to a green light at at least half of the intersections should be 50:50.

Of course the conditions aren't really 'ideal': ideal in this case would mean that there is no synchronization between the lights (so that the events corresponding to each light being green or red when I arrive are independent) , and that the lights are green for the same length of time in each direction (so that the probability of a light being green in a given direction at any given time is 1/2).  There's also a confounding factor in that I might sprint to get through a stale green, or slow down and coast towards a red light, further skewing the probabilities.  In practice, the first assumption is probably fairly good -- with one exception, the lights are pretty far apart, and I doubt that there's any real synchronization between them.  But the second assumption (that the probability is 1/2) is probably way off -- traffic lights just don't work that way, particularly when one road is much busier than the other.  Sprinting and coasting only add to the deviation from ideality, so in the end I don't expect my results to match the predictions very closely.  But I figured I might as well go ahead and pursue the problem further -- what else am I going to do while I ride?

So assuming ideal conditions, what is the actual probability of getting at least half green?  I wondered this because I decided to test my intuition on a smaller version of the problem, namely the last two lights on my ride.  If my intuition were correct, then I should typically expect to get at least one of the last two lights, on average.  But it's simple to calculate the probabilities directly in this case: there are four possible outcomes, and only one of them has me getting fewer than half green -- namely if both lights are red when I arrive.  So in fact I should get at least half green 3/4 of the time.

I realized I needed to throw out my intuition and think more logically.  And it turns out that in general, my odds of getting a green light at at least half of the intersections are actually better than 50:50.  In hindsight it's easy to explain why.  We can divide the set of outcomes into three categories, call them L, E and M.  L ('Less') consists of the outcomes where there are fewer green lights than red, E ('even') means the number of green and red lights are even, and M ('More') means more greens than reds.  And it shouldn't take much reflection to see that L and M have the same number of events.  (Argue by symmetry, or observe that each event in L has a corresponding event in M in which the colors have been swapped, and this yields a one-to-one correspondence between L and M.)  Secondly, E is nonempty.  It follows that L and M each contain strictly fewer than half of the events, and in particular, L represents less than half of the possible events.  I get at least half green when my event is in E or M; this happens more than half of the time.  Cool!

In retrospect, this seems obvious: my criterion for 'winning' this game is obviously skewed by including the 'break even' events.  Maybe that comes with being an optimist.  Interestingly, though, if the number of traffic lights on my route were odd, I would indeed have even chances of getting at least half of the greens (because E is empty, so L and M each represent exactly half of the events).

For the record, under ideal conditions, the probability of getting a green at at least half of the six lights is 42/64 -- almost 2 in 3!  In general, if there are 2n lights, my odds are (2<sup>n</sup>+C(2n,n))/2<sup>2n+1</sup> (here C(a,b) means 'a choose b').  Looking at this expression I become immediately curious how different this is from 1/2 as n gets large.  The difference is the second term C(2n,n)/2<sup>2n+1</sup>.  For 2 lights my odds were 3/4, which is a difference of 1/4.  For 6 lights the difference was 10/64, less than 1/6.  So I'm guessing that this will approach 0 as n gets large.  But that will have to wait for another ride..."

I know it's a cereal worthy of undying admiration, not to mention an LJ post, because it has its own <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_Wheat_Bran_Flakes"">Wikipedia entry</a>.  (OK, we already saw that <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shreddies"">Shreddies</a> has a Wikipedia entry, and in fact it looks like every cereal I can think of has one too.

Anyway, recently CWB disappeared from the shelves of our local Safeway store.  It's kind of a small Safeway, well-known for having less-than-typical selection.  But a quick check of a couple of other Safeway stores nearby revealed a frightening fact -- apparently Safeway has simply stopped selling CWB.  I was distraught!  Could it be that Kellogg's has stopped making it?  My mind raced as I thought of the possibility that I'd already eaten my last bowl.

"event","Sometimes if I get bored while riding my bike, I amuse myself by doing a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_calculation"">Fermi calculation</a>.  This happened to me on Tuesday while riding home from work; it's a commute route, so the scenery isn't very interesting, and anyway I've seen it many times before.

These days my main concern about riding home is getting there before it gets too dark.  I was thinking about how when I had ridden the Friday before it was just on the edge of being too dark to ride without lights by the time I got home.  But that was four days ago, and of course the sun is setting later and later each day.  But how much later?  I decided to see if I could figure it out.

For the purposes of my calculation, I decided to assume that the sunset times over the course of the year fit a sinusoidal curve, a pretty reasonable assumption (for a Fermi calculation, anyway).  The high and low points should be around June 21st and December 21st, so Tuesday, March 6th, was pretty close to the halfway point.  And the slope of a sine curve is largest at the point midway between the low and high points.  In fact, for the function y = sin x, the slope at that midpoint is 1.  Of course I'd have to scale that to fit my data, but that's pretty easy.  If I stretch my curve to make it really tall, the slope will increase, so the slope is proportional to the amplitude.  Conversely, if I stretch my curve to make the distance between the peaks really long, the slope decreases, so it's inversely proportional to the period.  For y = sin x, the amplitude is 1 and the period is 2&pi;.  So to get the slope of the graph of sunset times vs day of year, I have to multiply by the amplitude and also by 2&pi;/1 year.  To get the slope in minutes per day, I multiply by the amplitude in hours, and by 2&pi;/365 days.

So, what's the amplitude?  In the spirit of a Fermi calculation, I figure the sunset time ranges roughly between 5 PM and 9 PM - basically 7 PM &plusmn;2 hours.  So the amplitude is 2 hours or 120 minutes.  That gives me what I want; the slope is 1, scaled by the amplitude and 2&pi; over the period.  So at this time of year, sunset time is getting later at the rate of
<blockquote>
  1&times;120&times;2&pi;/365 minutes/day
</blockquote>
Of course I still have to 'do the math'.  &pi; is about 3.14, so 2&pi; is about 6.28, call it 6.3.  6 is close enough; the .3 is only 5%, good enough for a Fermi calculation.  I'll also round 365 down to 360, so now I'm left with estimating my rate as
<blockquote>
  120&times;6/360 minutes/day
</blockquote>
That's easy.  6/360 simplifies to 1/60, so I have 120/60 = 2.  Sunset is getting later by about 2 minutes each day.  So compared to my ride 4 days ago, sunset should be about 8 minutes later.

Well, by this point I'm only at Woodside Rd., less than halfway home.  I decided I'd see how I could improve the calculation.  Thinking back to my sine curve, I see that the midpoint between the high and low points really happens around March 21st, which is a good 2 weeks away.  That's 2/52 of the year; for convenience, call it 2/48, or 1/24.  Dividing one period of my sine curve up into four pieces, that's 1/6 of the way from the middle point (where the slope is greatest) back to the low point.  That portion from the low point to the middle point is 90&deg; of the 360&deg; in one period of the curve, and 1/6 of that is 15&deg; .  So essentially what I want is to scale my answer by the sine of 75&deg; instead of 1 (the sine of 90&deg;).  So now I need to compute sin(75&deg;).  This isn't one of those angles whose sine you're supposed to memorize for your trigonometry class.  But it's almost as good; I can use the addition formula for sin(A+B) to get it from two of those angles.  The formula is
<blockquote>
  sin(A+B) = sin A cos B + cos A sin B
</blockquote>
and I use A = 45&deg;, B = 30&deg; to get A+B = 75&deg;.  Now sin 45&deg; = cos 45&deg; = 1/&radic;2, so that factors out since there is a cos A in one term and a sin A in the other.  The other two are 1/2 and &radic;3/2 in some order, so I get
<blockquote>
  sin 75&deg; = (1/&radic;2)(1/2+&radic;3/2) = (1/&radic;2)(1+&radic;3)/2
</blockquote>
I'll rationalize the denominator because without a calculator, it makes things a lot easier.  So I now have
<blockquote>
  sin 75&deg; = (&radic;2)&times;(1+&radic;3)/4
</blockquote>
OK, so to one decimal place, &radic;2 = 1.4 and &radic;3 = 1.7.  So I need to calculate 1.4&times;2.7/4.  First I do 0.4&times;2.7; that's like 4&times;27 = 108; shifting the decimal, I get 1.08.  Adding that to 1&times;2.7 and I get 3.78.  Finally to divide by 4, I view this as 3.78 = 4 - 0.22, and the only hard part is dividing 0.22 by 4.  Dividing by 2 gives me 0.11; dividing by 2 again is 0.05+0.005 = 0.055.  So finally I get sin 75&deg; = 1-0.055 = 0.945.

Well, that means my slope is about 5% too big.  It's probably not worth adjusting by this much, since that's probably already smaller than my existing margin of error.  But for the record, it would decrease my prediction from 8 minutes later to about 7&frac12;.

So how did I do?  sin 75&deg; = 0.965925826 (incidentally, you can get this from Google).  Not bad, but not great.  My sunset times?  timeanddate.com tells me that on March 2, sunset was at 6:03, and on the 6th it was 6:06.  So it only changed by 3 minutes, not 8.  But I guess for a Fermi calculation, that's fine - it's the right order of magnitude, and that's all one can expect.

I thought about why my answer was so far off.  I can think of at least two reasons.  First, I didn't take into account daylight saving time.  The longest day actually occurs during daylight saving time, which artificially makes it an hour later than it actually happens.  So my sunset times really ranges only over a 3-hour period.  That means right off the bat my answer should be reduced by 25%.  So now I'm down to about 6 minutes.  Still off by a factor of about 2.

Probably the two biggest assumptions I made were the actual amplitude of my sine curve, and, more fundamentally, that my curve is a sine curve at all.  On the same website where I checked the actual sunset times I found that the sunset times ranged between 4:49 PST and 8:33 PDT, a range of about 2 hours and 45 minutes.  So even my 3-hour estimate is still a little too big, but the error is fairly small now (1 in 12, less than 10%).  So probably the remaining error is due to the fact that the curve is not really sinusoidal, and the slope at March 6th is flatter than my estimate.  This is supported by the observation that the earliest sunset occurred around December 5th, and the latest around June 29th.  So the distance between earliest and latest is a fair bit more than half the year -- definitely not a sine curve, and definitely suggesting a flatter slope throughout that period.

One final note -- it turns out I would have done better by simply assuming that sunset times increased linearly.  For this I'll go back to my assumptions that March 6th is about the middle, and the sunset times range over three hours.  This is a much easier Fermi calculation -- I need the slope of a straight line, which is just 'rise over run'.  The rise is 3 hours = 180 minutes, and the run is (about) 180 days, giving me 180/180 = 1 minute per day, for a total of four minutes over the four days.  Even though the straight-line assumption isn't really justified, it's much closer than my much more detailed calculation.

But that wouldn't have filled nearly enough time on my ride..."

But then he woke up, and mostly just cried the rest of the evening, despite our (and others') repeated attempts to console and entertain him.  We were used to him crying all the time anyway, but I don't think the rest of the gang appreciated it quite so much.

We've tried again on a few other occasions, but results have generally been unimpressive.  I guess we're just tenacious though, and last night we decided to try another outing with the gang again, the first in probably a couple of months, and at a noisy restaurant to boot.  And it seems that suddenly, without our noticing, our boy has become quite the party animal!  He behaved so well, and seemed to enjoy it so much, that we could scarcely believe it.  We ended up staying long enough that he went to bed an hour later than usual, but he never even got close to cranky.  And to give credit where credit is due, I don't think our improved management skills had a great deal to do with his success last night -- it's mostly just him being more mature.

For a while I've been feeling that Mr Excitement has been on a developmental plateau -- I hadn't really noticed any major changes lately (though this week we've definitely started to see the rudiments of crawling, so obviously he's not completely stationary).  But this just goes to show that even when you don't see changes outwardly, there must often be a lot going on inside that just doesn't necessarily manifest itself outwardly every day.  It's very cool to suddenly see the results of all that behind-the-scenes development."

"event","Every once in a while I entertain the thought of starting a blog where I simply document all of the crappy stuff I seem to buy which either doesn't work properly or works for a short while and then breaks.  I wouldn't describe myself as a pessimist, but every once in a while I get the feeling that I spend a significant portion of my life either repairing or replacing stuff, rather than enjoying the increased leisure time that our supposedly technologically advanced society is supposed to make possible.

I think I could go on at considerable length with examples of what I'm talking about.  But I'll save most of those for my blog, and just cite two here:

1. We bought an automatic shower cleaner about 6 months ago.  It's a great idea -- you hang it on your shower head.  After you shower, you switch it on; it waits 15 seconds, then a little rotating head sprays shower cleaner all over the walls of your shower.  The other day it just stopped working.  Push the button, nothing happens.  The batteries are fine.

2. I bought a very handy little USB-powered LED light to light up my keyboard.  I find such a device relatively essential, since my setup involves a laptop on a stand, connected to an external keyboard, and the stand blocks a lot of the room light from the external keyboard, so the light makes it much easier to see when I need to find (e.g.) a function key or something (I do touch-type, but I don't know anyone who doesn't need to glance at the keyboard occasionally).  Anyway, this thing is made by HP, a company with shitloads of hardware experience and knowhow.  But one of the LEDs died in the first one I bought.  Got that one replaced, but it also had problems.  I'm now on my <i>fourth</i> one, and it's gone wonky too.  Each one lasted maybe about 3 weeks max.

So I don't know -- maybe I expect too much?  The optimist in me might point out that for every technical marvel that fails somehow, there are probably a hundred that work reliably every day and I just don't think about them.  But the pessimist in me says that the right measure is some kind of ratio between how much time technology saves me versus how much time it costs, and I'm not sure I'm getting the most impressive throughput, so to speak.

What do you think?  Does technology mostly live up to its hype?  Or is it often more trouble than it's worth?"

"event","Last year at Xmas I got five DVD box sets -- the first three Seinfelds, Season 5 of the Simpsons, and Season 3 of Family Guy.  It's great -- I love them.  In past years, I've managed to keep up with all the box sets I've gotten for Xmas (or my b'day, which sadly is very close to Xmas).

Then this year <lj user=""smokingtoaster""> and I became parents.

You can guess where this story is going.  TV viewing has taken a bit of a back seat, but I've still tried to watch the DVDs when I could find time.  And last week I finally finished the <i>first</i> of this year's box sets.

At this rate I will finish watching the box sets I got at Xmas 2005 in September 2009.  Yikes!  I hope I don't get any more this year.  (I'm quite serious -- I really hope I don't.)"

"event","Ever since Mr Excitement was born, we've tried to play music for him pretty regularly.  We think it's good for him, and more importantly, he seems to enjoy it and it often helps calm him down.  It's something of a challenge, though, to find music that is listenable for him but stands up to repeated listenings for his parents.

I've found a fair bit of Mozart that seems to work quite well.  It's not too dramatic, it's very straightforward harmonically, and the musical purist in me likes it -- Mozart's compositions are so perfectly constructed, and I think that's good for him to hear.  Yet I'm not a big fan of Mozart, for just those reasons -- not daring or dramatic enough.  Plus, one really useful property of good music for your kids is that you can sing along with it -- hard to do that with old Wolfie's stuff.

Of course there's lots of stuff out there that's aimed at kids, but is just too dumbed-down to interest an adult.  I think some bigger name artists are starting to get into the kids' music business and are trying to produce stuff that's good for kids but also listenable for adults.  A friend of ours gave us a CD by Dan Zanes, formerly of the Del Fuegos.  It's clearly aimed at this market -- kids' music that is still palatable to adults.  I think it succeeds at being acceptable for kids, and I could see some adults enjoying it if his kind of music was to their taste, but for me it still doesn't do it.

But I think I've finally realized that some of the best kids music ever has also been part of my music collection almost since I got interested in pop music.  I'm talking about none other than the Beatles, who I still consider to be one of the best pop bands of all time.  Here's what I've added to Mr Excitement's folder since I hit on this idea:

Penny Lane
Hello, Goodbye
The Fool on the Hill
Ob-la-di, Ob-la-da
Here Comes the Sun
Something
Octopus's Garden
Across the Universe
The Long and Winding Road
Yesterday
Norwegian Wood
Nowhere Man
Yellow Submarine
Maxwell's Silver Hammer
Here, There and Everywhere
For No One

There are a few obvious omissions here, partly because we only have 4 Beatles CDs.  In particular, ""When I'm 64"" would be a great addition, but (gasp) I don't have a copy of Sgt Pepper, and it's not on either the Red or Blue greatest hits albums.  But these are by far some of my favorite things in his collection -- great songs, very sing-a-long-able, and also musically very pure.

Any other suggestions out there for songs your kids like that you also enjoy listening to?"

"event","On Friday we had a group lunch at a restaurant called 'Little Szechuan'.  Many of the attendees liked spicy food, but a couple of us didn't (I'm kind of on the fence -- I like to try a bit of the spicy stuff, but I generally prefer mild to no spice).

One of the people at the table observed that the most frequently used word throughout the restaurant seemed to be 'spicy' -- just casually listening to the conversation at any neighboring table, you were quite likely to hear the word being used.  ""Who likes spicy food?""  ""Is this spicy?""  ""It's not that spicy""  ""Wow, this is pretty spicy"".

Around our house I've noticed lately that the 'word of the hour' seems to be 'cute'.  When I wash little Raspberry's clothes, I'm taken by how cute his tiny little socks are compared to mine.  It's cute when he smiles.  It's cute when he's wide awake and just happily looking around.  It's oh-so-cute when he falls asleep on <lj user=""smokingtoaster"">'s shoulder.  We even admit a little sheepishly that it's very cute the way he cries sometimes.

We just have more cute than we know what to do with here."

Rolanda, would you care to travel to Martinique with me on holiday this Christmas if you do not have any other plans? Mum has insisted that I join her for the Shacklebolt reunion.

As of midnight Saturday, I have fully investigated the entire Ministry.  Other than some questionable paraphenalia, there is no evidence that Sirius Black has ever entered the building.  I am still in the process in questioning ALL Ministry employees, from those working directly below the Minister to the lowliest security guard.  All employees will recieve memos listing the time and date of their interview.  Please do not be late, as I have very little free time. Thank you.

The students now remind me of what happened in my school days, although we had quite a few more parties with rather strong beverages, courtesy of the Fluffy Bunny Company.  In those days, of course, we had less security and as long as we did not wander the halls inebriated, the faculty and staff had absolutely no idea what went on.  
What is rather sad is that I believe that a select few of these students would excell in my Stealth and Tracking course more than those pitiful excuses for Auror candidates.  Perhaps, however, those candidates would be much more well prepared for the training if stealth was integrated as part of the Defense Against the Dark Arts curriculum.  
I believe I still have some firewhisky left.  I feel like a good strong drink, and then I'll perhaps go looking for said Quidditch referee."

However, smoothly does not mean a bureaucratic automaton.  If every wizard abided by the law, I would be out of a job.
Nothing engages the adrenaline more than a stalking and capture of a wanted criminal.  Or am I the only one who thinks that way?

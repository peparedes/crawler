It was featured in a Japanese magazine called <a href=""http://book.dai-x.com/days/"" rel=""nofollow"">Figure Skate Days</a> Vol. 3, but it has long been out of print. I never had the chance to read it until this amazing fan transcribed the whole thing and <a href=""http://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm10927042"" rel=""nofollow"">posted it on NicoVideo</a> a couple days ago. I was so whelmed I had to share this with you bbs!<br /><br />I really dunno if I should be posting this on such a glorious day for Stephane/Daisuke stans (that&#39;s me by the way), but I don&#39;t want to lose the momentum so here I go.<br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://i281.photobucket.com/albums/kk236/AngieAngie0724/Figureskating/Miyaken/1.jpg"" /><img alt="""" src=""http://i281.photobucket.com/albums/kk236/AngieAngie0724/Figureskating/Miyaken/dai07_edited2.jpg"" style=""width: 199px; height: 320px;"" /><br /><br /><a name=""cutid1""></a>Kenji Miyamoto (also known as Miyaken) is a former ice dance champion of Japan, who retired from competition in 2006. He is an up-and-coming choreographer, who made the following three programs for Daisuke, <strong>AFTER</strong> this interview took place.<br /><br /><strong>2007-08 EX Bachelorette</strong><br /><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ql_qy6iagds"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ql_qy6iag<wbr />ds</a><br /><br /><strong>2008-10 SP Eye</strong> (This is an early exhibition version from 2008)<br /><br /><br /><strong>2009-10 EX Luv-Letter</strong><br /><br /><br />His other works include Akiko Suzuki&#39;s &quot;Libertango&quot; and Yukari Nakano&#39;s &quot;Corteo.&quot;<br />I think you can see that this man&#39;s got enormous talent. With Stephane, Shae-Lynn and Pasquale Camerlengo (FYI he&#39;s Miyamoto&#39;s former coach) on the list I don&#39;t know if there&#39;ll be room for him next season but I really hope to see more of his work with Dai...<br /><br />Anyway, let&#39;s go on to the interview. It&#39;s long but I&nbsp;guarantee it&#39;s worth the read!<br /><br /><strong><font style=""background-image: url(http://i47.tinypic.com/107nxmw.jpg); font-size: 35px;"">TOKYO WORLDS 2007</font></strong><br /><br />K: Otsukaresama! (It&#39;s a greeting word used late in the day meaning &quot;great work today.&quot;)<br />D: Otsukaresama!<br />K: How was the World Championship for you?<br />D: The girl&#39;s? The men&#39;s?<br />K: The men&#39;s of course.<br />D: The men&#39;s competition got me so nervous.<br />K: Oh. You were nervous? :D<br />D: Yes I was. I almost cried.<br />K: Hmmm, so you were nervous.<br />D: In fact I actually cried. In the end. <strong>But I was almost crying before I did anything</strong>. :D<br />K: You must be joking! :D<br />D: And before the competition I gave up my cell phone. I gave up alcohol. I gave up sweets...<br />K: <strong>You didn&#39;t text anyone?</strong><br />D: No I didn&#39;t.<br />K: Really?<br />D: I haven&#39;t done it till now.<br />K: <strong>Liar! You replied to my e-mail</strong>. :D<br />D: Yeah. :D<br />K: After the competition when we went out to eat, you didn&#39;t look that happy.<br />D: I was happy with my results being 2nd at Worlds, but I&#39;m not satisfied.<br />K: <strong>That day I thought about texting you like I always do</strong>, but I thought it wouldn&#39;t be appropriate for me to congratulate you. I will do that next season. When you win the championship.<br />D: Yes I really would love to win.<br />K: Why you grinning :D<br />D: <strong>Because Miki-chan beat me to it. I&#39;m the only one without the title on Team Nicholai...</strong><br />K: LOLOL<br />D: You know, I&#39;m a bit depressed by the fact. :D<br />K: Don&#39;t say that.<br />D: I will try my best next year.<br />K: But the last part of your FS was so exciting. How did you feel, just before the straight line step sequence?<br />D: I felt the audience cheering.<br />K: Did you feel helped by the audience?<br />D: Yes, exactly.<br />K: <strong>I said &quot;WOW&quot; too!</strong><br />D: Really? :D<br />K: ...I think I did? :D<br />D: You think. :D<br />K: Yeah...<br />D: Is that all? :D<br /><br /><br /><br /><strong><font style=""background-image: url(http://i47.tinypic.com/107nxmw.jpg); font-size: 35px;"">FASHION TALK</font></strong><br /><br />K: You know, I hate that I&#39;m wearing my cap today.<br />D: Why?<br />K: We&#39;re being photographed. Dai-chan you look alright. Ah, let me take off my ID...<br />D: Hey, lol, what&#39;s this?? (The photo on the ID has Miyamoto wearing a jacket.)<br />K: This? When I had to take this photo, I was already undressed. So I had to put my jacket on in a real hurry.<strong> I was only wearing underwear from the waist down in that pic.</strong> :D<br />D: OMG :D<br />K: That&#39;s eroticism for you. Well I haven&#39;t got as much eroticism as you do, Dai-chan.<br />D: <strong>You got to teach me about eroticism.</strong> :D<br />K: What eroticism, sexy Dai-chan.<br />D: Ah, I got called that a lot last year. :D<br />K: What was the phrase?<br />D: <strong>Ike-men Ma-jyu-chu-shi. </strong>(Good looking wizz-zard) :D<br />K: A wizz-zard. It&#39;s not wizardry really. :D<br />D: It&#39;s not wizardry. Why do they call it wizardry?<br />K: But you are good looking aren&#39;t you.<br />D: Good looks don&#39;t have anything to do with it, and I&#39;m not good looking anyway.<br />K: Liar.<br />D: There are a lot of men (skaters)&nbsp; who are good looking.<br />K: Men who are good looking! :D<br />K: <strong>And today I&#39;m wearing matching cargo pants with the good looking Dai-chan.</strong> :D<br />D: I have the same one in black.<br />K: You gotta be kidding!<br />D; I saw you wearing it, Kenji-kun, and thought it was cute. So I bought it. :D<br />K: Yeah that kind of thing happens. We look at each other and like what the other is wearing.<br />The other day I saw the long sleeved shirt you were wearing and thought it was cool. So I went out to buy it. But it was so tight! From here (chest) to here (arm)! You&#39;re suppose to wear it loose...<br />D: But it was super tight. :D<br /><br /><strong><font style=""background-image: url(http://i47.tinypic.com/107nxmw.jpg); font-size: 35px;"">NOBUNARI&#39;S UNFORTUNATE SKATING COSTUME</font></strong><br /><br />Editor: When you wore Nobunari Oda&#39;s costume, it looked super tight on you.<br />K&amp;D: LOLOLOLOLOL!!!<br />K:<strong> It was more than super tight,</strong> <strong>I was exposing a lot of what I should not be exposing.</strong><br />D; What? Really?<br />K: The size didn&#39;t fit in all kinds of places.<br />D: <strong>That was awesome. That was REALLY awesome.</strong> :D<br />K: No, you don&#39;t get it. At first I was trying to wear Dai-chan&#39;s costume.<br />D: No, I was trying to wear that (Nobunari&#39;s) costume, but...<br />K: Yeah. But I was told only to wear Nobunari&#39;s. <strong>I wanted to try Dai-chan&#39;s on.</strong><strong> But if I did your back side would have become sexier.</strong> :D<br />D: Sexier. :D<br />K: The leg was wide enough, so it was alright. But if I wore Dai-chan&#39;s pants the hem would be up here (pointing to his knee).<br />D: No no no no no no! <strong>My legs grew longer recently.</strong><br />K: Your legs grew? :D<br />D: They grew. :D<br /><br /><strong><font style=""background-image: url(http://i47.tinypic.com/107nxmw.jpg); font-size: 35px;"">MIYAKEN IS JEALOUS</font></strong><br /><br />K: I was thinking about this for a long time now, but I like your relationship with Coach Nagamitsu.<br />D: Don&#39;t get so serious suddenly, how am I going to react to that.<br />K: The trust between you two that will not break no matter what happens.<br />D: Yes it&#39;s true, she&#39;s irreplacable.<br />K: <strong>You know I&#39;m jealous of you two</strong>, watching from a close distance.<br />D: What, jealous!? :D<br />K: <strong>When I take you out and we play too much, I get scolded. </strong>She really cares about you Dai-chan.<br />D: Yeah, Utako Sensei is such a sweet person.<br />K: But when I pay you a visit, you two suddenly start arguing. And I&#39;m like, why do I have to stop this fight :D<br />D: We fight a lot. But she&#39;s so important in my life.<br />K: How sweet...<br /><br /><strong><font style=""background-image: url(http://i47.tinypic.com/107nxmw.jpg); font-size: 35px;"">DAI TALKS ABOUT DANCING</font> </strong><br /><br />K: So what are you going to do next season?<br />D: In skating? In private life?<br />K: Both.<br />D: In my private life...you know I&#39;m 21 right? I do feel that I have to become a mature man. :D<br />K: How about in competition?<br />D: In competition, <strong>I want to broaden my capacity in dancing.</strong><br />K: Do you want to incorporate dancing into skating?<br />D: Yes I do. I want to have that experience.<br />K: Let&#39;s do it. Hip hop for example. (Note: This is before Cyber Swan)<br />D: <strong>You take me. I don&#39;t want to go alone.</strong> :D<br />K: I want to learn too. Let&#39;s do it.<br />D: I&#39;d want some experience in hip hop dancing. I want to learn tango and flamenco too. And jazz dancing.<br />K: <strong>Okay then lets go clubbing for a start.</strong><br />D: I&#39;ve never been to a night club before.<br />K: Me neither. <strong>Let&#39;s be awkward together,</strong> lol. And since you are so popular, Dai-chan, it would be nice if you do this move (touches face).<br />D: No way. :D<br />K: Then everybody will be like this... (hides face and peeps thru his hands)<br />D: No way I&#39;m doing that, lol. You know, they never air that on TV!<br /><br /><strong><font style=""background-image: url(http://i47.tinypic.com/107nxmw.jpg); font-size: 35px;"">DAI WANTS ATTENTION!</font></strong><br /><br />D: By the way, Kenji-kun, how is it like now that you&#39;ve retired from competition?<br />K: It&#39;s lonely. It&#39;s really lonely.<br />D: When the men&#39;s competition ended, <strong>I felt lonely watching the girls because they got all the attention.</strong> :D<br />K: I know, I know.<br />D: There&#39;s nothing I can do about it, but I felt lonely. :D<br />K: You&#39;re going to get so much attention again at the exhibition tomorrow.<br />D: I&#39;d like to work for that.<br />K: And we all go out to dinner during the competition together, right? It&#39;s fun for the moment, but once we get to the rink I have nothing to do. That makes me feel lonely.<br />D: We don&#39;t go out to eat together anymore.<br />K: Really?<br />D: We go separately. This season I&#39;m trying not to go out to eat with other skaters.<br />K: Why is that?<br />D: IDK, my results are better that way. It&#39;s like superstition. At the Japan Nat I was eating at the same place every day.<br />K: Oh Reeely.<br />D: Why, you sound so uninterested. :D<br />K: Did I sound half-hearted? :D<br />D: <strong>Pay attention to me when I&#39;m talking.</strong> :D<br /><br /><strong><font style=""background-image: url(http://i47.tinypic.com/107nxmw.jpg); font-size: 35px;"">TELEPHONE LOVE (WUT)</font></strong><br /><br />D: I want to start living by myself. No, maybe I don&#39;t. What do you think?<br />K: It would be lonely. Hey, I&#39;ve never lived alone either.<br />D: No way.<br />K: I was alone when I was (training) in France though.<br />D: That&#39;s tough. I was lonely even in the U.S. when I was all by myself.<br />K: It makes you go crazy, doesn&#39;t it? I mean, I was crazy.<br />D: There&#39;s nothing to do when you&#39;re alone.<br />K: <strong>You remember I was crazy when I was living in France. And you were having a hard time in your life too then. </strong><br />D: I was crazy in the head at the time too.<br />K: It was okay for me because I was typing on my computer, but <strong>Dai-chan, you were texting from your cell phone, and you had about ten lines full of texts. I&#39;m saying ten lines on my computer screen.</strong><br />D: I was sick, wasn&#39;t I?<br />K: <strong>We were texting each other, for like 5 to 6 hours weren&#39;t we.</strong><br />D: We were crazy. And look at where we are now. :D<br />K: Yeah, you&#39;ve grown really strong recently.<br />D: No no no. I have to be stronger. I&#39;m happy that Miki won but I&#39;m really frustrated! It gets more frustrating as the time passes.<br />K: It gives you motivation for the next season.<br />D: Yes, exactly. You know, I&#39;m always having things put on hold till the very last moment. Men got to try harder. Men got to try harder than the ladies. I guess that&#39;s the lesson they&#39;re trying to teach me.<br />K: What is it with you, so suddenly! :D<br />D: Miki just walked by. Mao was strong too. I&#39;m laughing and crying at the same time. :D<br />K: You cry too much, lol. <strong>But I do catch you crying alot Dai-chan.</strong><br />D: <strong>You&#39;re the only one, Kenji-kun.</strong><br />K: Is that true?<br />D: The people around me don&#39;t really know that I cry a lot.<br />K: You cry whenever something happens to you Dai-chan.<br />D: Ah! I do cry when someone else is crying! And I have cried in frustration several times...<br />K: It&#39;s hard to find the right words to say when you cry like that.<br /><br /><strong><font style=""background-image: url(http://i47.tinypic.com/107nxmw.jpg); font-size: 35px;"">THE TIANANMEN SQUARE INCIDENT</font></strong><br /><br />D: And at the Tiananmen Square...<br />K: You really don&#39;t have to talk about that, lol.<br />D: But that was so... :D<br />K: It was when we were at a competition in China, when this Chinese skater said he&#39;d take us out to eat so he drove us to the place, right? And after eating, we decided to go see the Tiananmen Square.<br />D: Yes, yes.<br />K: And he drove us there. Dai-chan said he wanted to go to the loo so we dropped him off, and while Dai-chan was away, we were taking pictures. We were waiting for Dai-chan in the car, but the driver took off without Dai-chan. <strong>I was saying, &quot;Wait! Dai-chan&#39;s not back yet!&quot; and making hand gestures toward this guy, but he took this as &quot;Let&#39;s leave now.&quot;</strong> :D<br />D: LOLOLOLOL<br />K: We took off without Dai-chan.<br />D: <strong>When I got back there was no one there. </strong><strong>And I was thinking, you don&#39;t have to do this, you don&#39;t have to be funny.</strong> :D<br />K: It wasn&#39;t even that funny. :D<br />D: Don&#39;t you think so? It&#39;s not even funny. And you&#39;re hiding way too long! I really thought they were hiding at first so when I noticed they left I was depressed. But I did have some money and I had the keys to my hotel room, so if I couldn&#39;t find them I thought I&#39;d take the cab back to the hotel.<br />K: We were driving around Tiananmen Square at that time, and I was telling the guy to go back but he wouldn&#39;t understand me. And he parks the car at the opposite side of Tiananmen Square. And by that time I was really anxious and shouting &quot;No! This way!&quot; and made him move the car back to where we were. <strong>And when we got back Dai-chan walked towards us very slowly...and he was fuming.</strong> :D<br />D: And everyone else was laughing so hard! :D<br />K: No, you don&#39;t know how worried I was for you.<br />D: You didn&#39;t look worried at all. <strong>You were the one who was laughing the hardest!</strong> :D<br />K: No, you don&#39;t understand. You were so furious and your were tearing up. I saw that. <strong>And if I said &quot;I&#39;m sorry Dai-chan,&quot; I thought you&#39;d burst into tears.</strong> :D<br />D: Yeah. :D<br />K: <strong>So I was like, &quot;Oh sorry about that Dai-chan, LOL!&quot;</strong><br />D: After that I lost &quot;rock-paper-scissors&quot; and I had to eat fried scorpions at the street stand. That was my first senior competition.<br />K: Wow, really!<br /><br /><strong><font style=""background-image: url(http://i47.tinypic.com/107nxmw.jpg); font-size: 35px;"">COMMERCIALS WITH AYA UETO </font></strong><br /><br />K: Oh, and by the way, how did the commercial shoot go?<br />D: <strong>Cute!</strong><br />K: What&#39;s cute?<br />D: <strong>Aya Ueto.</strong><br />We had the shoot in the morning and I went straight to training afterwards, and my trainer asked me, &quot;What happened? You&#39;re in good shape today.&quot;<strong> I was so refreshed.</strong> :D<br />K: LOLOL<br />D; It was tiring because it was so early in the morning, but my body was moving so much better than usual. And I was amazed what this (points at heart) could do for you. I felt that the heart gives you so much power. In a very weird way. :D<br />K: That&#39;s so weird. <strong>You can&#39;t tell people that. &quot;If you want to feel refreshed, get commercials!&quot;</strong> :D<br />D: I can&#39;t. :D<br />K: We have to find a better way. :D<br />D: I don&#39;t know of a better way. It was amazing. :D<br />K: I haven&#39;t seen it yet.<br />D: It&#39;s aired a lot now, I saw it.<br />K: Show me how you did it.<br />D: No way. :D<br />K: Why not?<br />D: Because when I say, &quot;I made the rounds&quot; and come back, my body looks kind of skewed. :D<br />K: What? Hey, I don&#39;t get it. :D<br />D: <strong>Watch it.</strong> :D<br />K: I will.<br /><br /><br /><br /><strong><font style=""background-image: url(http://i47.tinypic.com/107nxmw.jpg); font-size: 35px;"">BEST FRIENDS FOR EVER</font></strong><br /><br />K: You know Dai-chan? you&#39;re such a first class athlete who gets your own commercials. <strong>But after the competition&#39;s over you&#39;re so cute and friendly to me.</strong> I don&#39;t say this to him to his face usually.<br />D: But when I do bad in a competion I&#39;m really awful.<br />K: You are. I&#39;m like, &quot;why are you taking it out on me!&quot;<br />D: I do feel sorry for acting like that. :D<br />K: But he asks me for advice so honestly and so straightforwardly. I don&#39;t have much to offer but I want to give him all that I&#39;ve got.<br />D: I&#39;m flattered. Kenji-kun sometimes jokes around when I ask him for advice, but in the end he always gives me a straight answer.<br />K: Don&#39;t flatter me. Well, <strong>keep on being the cutest person and the coolest athlete, Dai-chan,&nbsp; I&#39;ll be rooting for you always. </strong>From the shadows.<br />D: Keep on being a great brother and a great senior, and <strong>please become the most famous Japanese choreographer, no, please become the world famous choreographer!</strong><br />K: When I become one please work with me Dai-chan!<br />D: Yes of course, I mean really.<br />K: I mean really.<br />D: Yeah, but not only choreographing. <strong>I want to see many different sides of Kenji-kun in many different fields.</strong><br />K: What are you saying. :D<br />D: <strong>Please stay friends with me!</strong><br />K: You too!<br />D: Please do!<br /><br />To wrap things up here&#39;s a clip of Daisuke working on choreography for Luv-Letter in the summer of 2009.<br />Beware of Miyaken&#39;s <strong>INTENSE</strong> staring at 2:10-2:13.<br /><br />TYFYT!<br /><br /></div>"

<P><EM>""I would like him to go through a journey where he starts in one place psychologically and ends up in another, allowing him to go through some kind of change. I would like him to be the lead. I heard from some people that they were thinking of doing a Spike/Illyria piece and I need to talk to them and say, 'I'm really interested in doing the character as a lead, but I've done him as a sidekick.' If they write an Illyria piece with Spike tagged on, I probably won't do it. 

I love Amy Acker and would love to shoot with her, but there's nothing for me to prove by doing it with her. It has to do with theme. What is the theme? Who is the character the audience is supposed to identify with? The trick of a story is that you bring the audience on a vicarious journey and you make the central character someone they want to be, so they see themselves through the eyes of that character. Illyria could be all through it. They could be talking to each other in every scene, but thematically it's got to be Spike's story. That's brutally honest, but it's the way I feel.""

<P><SPAN class=smallText><I>Sunday, September 11th, 2005</I></SPAN><BR><SPAN class=titleText><SPAN class=titleText>A Letter to All Who Voted for George W. Bush from Michael Moore</SPAN></SPAN></P>
<P>
<P>To All My Fellow Americans Who Voted for George W. Bush: </P>
<P>On this, the fourth anniversary of 9/11, I'm just curious, how does it feel? </P>
<P>How does it feel to know that the man you elected to lead us after we were attacked went ahead and put a guy in charge of FEMA whose main qualification was that he ran horse shows? </P>
<P>That's right. Horse shows. </P>
<P>I really want to know -- and I ask you this in all sincerity and with all due respect -- how do you feel about the utter contempt Mr. Bush has shown for your safety? C'mon, give me just a moment of honesty. Don't start ranting on about how this disaster in New Orleans was the fault of one of the poorest cities in America. Put aside your hatred of Democrats and liberals and anyone with the last name of Clinton. Just look me in the eye and tell me our President did the right thing after 9/11 by naming a horse show runner as the top man to protect us in case of an emergency or catastrophe. </P>
<P>I want you to put aside your self-affixed label of Republican/conservative/born-again/capitalist/ditto-head/right-winger and just talk to me as an American, on the common ground we both call America. </P>
<P>Are we safer now than before 9/11? When you learn that behind the horse show runner, the #2 and #3 men in charge of emergency preparedness have zero experience in emergency preparedness, do you think we are safer? </P>
<P>When you look at Michael Chertoff, the head of Homeland Security, a man with little experience in national security, do you feel secure? </P>
<P>When men who never served in the military and have never seen young men die in battle send our young people off to war, do you think they know how to conduct a war? Do they know what it means to have your legs blown off for a threat that was never there? </P>
<P>Do you really believe that turning over important government services to private corporations has resulted in better services for the people? </P>
<P>Why do you hate our federal government so much? You have voted for politicians for the past 25 years whose main goal has been to de-fund the federal government. Do you think that cutting federal programs like FEMA and the Army Corps of Engineers has been good or bad for America? GOOD OR BAD? </P>
<P>With the nation's debt at an all-time high, do you think tax cuts for the rich are still a good idea? Will you give yours back so hundreds of thousands of homeless in New Orleans can have a home? </P>
<P>Do you believe in Jesus? Really? Didn't he say that we would be judged by how we treat the least among us? Hurricane Katrina came in and blew off the facade that we were a nation with liberty and justice for all. The wind howled and the water rose and what was revealed was that the poor in America shall be left to suffer and die while the President of the United States fiddles and tells them to eat cake. </P>
<P>That's not a joke. The day the hurricane hit and the levees broke, Mr. Bush, John McCain and their rich pals were stuffing themselves with cake. A full day after the levees broke (the same levees whose repair funding he had cut), Mr. Bush was playing a guitar some country singer gave him. All this while New Orleans sank under water. </P>
<P>It would take ANOTHER day before the President would do a flyover in his jumbo jet, peeking out the window at the misery 2500 feet below him as he flew back to his second home in DC. It would then be TWO MORE DAYS before a trickle of federal aid and troops would arrive. This was no seven minutes in a sitting trance while children read ""My Pet Goat"" to him. This was FOUR DAYS of doing nothing other than saying ""Brownie (FEMA director Michael Brown), you're doing a heck of a job!"" </P>
<P>My Republican friends, does it bother you that we are the laughing stock of the world? </P>
<P>And on this sacred day of remembrance, do you think we honor or shame those who died on 9/11/01? If we learned nothing and find ourselves today every bit as vulnerable and unprepared as we were on that bright sunny morning, then did the 3,000 die in vain? </P>
<P>Our vulnerability is not just about dealing with terrorists or natural disasters. We are vulnerable and unsafe because we allow one in eight Americans to live in horrible poverty. We accept an education system where one in six children never graduate and most of those who do can't string a coherent sentence together. The middle class can't pay the mortgage or the hospital bills and 45 million have no health coverage whatsoever. </P>
<P>Are we safe? Do you really feel safe? You can only move so far out and build so many gated communities before the fruit of what you've sown will be crashing through your walls and demanding retribution. Do you really want to wait until that happens? Or is it your hope that if they are left alone long enough to soil themselves and shoot themselves and drown in the filth that fills the street that maybe the problem will somehow go away? </P>
<P>I know you know better. You gave the country and the world a man who wasn't up for the job and all he does is hire people who aren't up for the job. You did this to us, to the world, to the people of New Orleans. Please fix it. Bush is yours. And you know, for our peace and safety and security, this has to be fixed. What do you propose? </P>
<P>I have an idea, and it isn't a horse show. </P>
<P>Yours, </P>

<P>
<P>Friday, September 2nd, 2005 

<P>Dear Mr. Bush: 
<P>Any idea where all our helicopters are? It's Day 5 of Hurricane Katrina and thousands remain stranded in New Orleans and need to be airlifted. Where on earth could you have misplaced all our military choppers? Do you need help finding them? I once lost my car in a Sears parking lot. Man, was that a drag. 
<P>Also, any idea where all our national guard soldiers are? We could really use them right now for the type of thing they signed up to do like helping with national disasters. How come they weren't there to begin with? 
<P>Last Thursday I was in south Florida and sat outside while the eye of Hurricane Katrina passed over my head. It was only a Category 1 then but it was pretty nasty. Eleven people died and, as of today, there were still homes without power. That night the weatherman said this storm was on its way to New Orleans. That was Thursday! Did anybody tell you? I know you didn't want to interrupt your vacation and I know how you don't like to get bad news. Plus, you had fundraisers to go to and mothers of dead soldiers to ignore and smear. You sure showed her! 
<P>I especially like how, the day after the hurricane, instead of flying to Louisiana, you flew to San Diego to party with your business peeps. Don't let people criticize you for this -- after all, the hurricane was over and what the heck could you do, put your finger in the dike? 
<P>And don't listen to those who, in the coming days, will reveal how you specifically reduced the Army Corps of Engineers' budget for New Orleans this summer for the third year in a row. You just tell them that even if you hadn't cut the money to fix those levees, there weren't going to be any Army engineers to fix them anyway because you had a much more important construction job for them -- BUILDING DEMOCRACY IN IRAQ! 
<P>On Day 3, when you finally left your vacation home, I have to say I was moved by how you had your Air Force One pilot descend from the clouds as you flew over New Orleans so you could catch a quick look of the disaster. Hey, I know you couldn't stop and grab a bullhorn and stand on some rubble and act like a commander in chief. Been there done that. 
<P>There will be those who will try to politicize this tragedy and try to use it against you. Just have your people keep pointing that out. Respond to nothing. Even those pesky scientists who predicted this would happen because the water in the Gulf of Mexico is getting hotter and hotter making a storm like this inevitable. Ignore them and all their global warming Chicken Littles. There is nothing unusual about a hurricane that was so wide it would be like having one F-4 tornado that stretched from New York to Cleveland. 
<P>No, Mr. Bush, you just stay the course. It's not your fault that 30 percent of New Orleans lives in poverty or that tens of thousands had no transportation to get out of town. C'mon, they're black! I mean, it's not like this happened to Kennebunkport. Can you imagine leaving white people on their roofs for five days? Don't make me laugh! Race has nothing -- NOTHING -- to do with this! 
<P>You hang in there, Mr. Bush. Just try to find a few of our Army helicopters and send them there. Pretend the people of New Orleans and the Gulf Coast are near Tikrit. 
<P>Yours, 
<P>Michael Moore<BR><A href=""mailto:mmflint@aol.com"">MMFlint@aol.com</A><BR><A href="""" target=_blank>www.MichaelMoore.com</A> 
<P>P.S. That annoying mother, Cindy Sheehan, is no longer at your ranch. She and dozens of other relatives of the Iraqi War dead are now driving across the country, stopping in many cities along the way. Maybe you can <A href=""http://www.bringthemhomenowtour.org/userdata_display.php?modin=50"" target=_blank>catch up with them</A> before they get to DC on September 21st.</P>"

Antony and The Johnsons' ""I Am a Bird Now"" (Secretly Canadian) is the best song cycle about the life of a pre-op transsexual ever recorded. It also may be the album of the year.

Antony's voice is intoxicating - a stunning mix of Nina Simone soul, Little Jimmy Scott's smooth phrasing and Boy George's inviting balladeer vibrato.

Once you hear it, you won't forget it. His voice is so powerful that when Boy George sings with him on ""You Are My Sister"" or the great Rufus Wainwright takes over lead vocals on ""What Can I Do,"" it is immediately missed.

With two albums already under their belts, Antony and The Johnsons' music already has been part of the Whitney Biennial. The band has been a fixture in Lower East Side clubs for years. And Lou Reed already has taken Antony on tour as a featured vocalist in his band.

However, it's the songwriting on ""I Am a Bird Now"" that proves Antony is destined for big things. Everything about ""Fistful of Love"" is big - from Reed's spoken-word introduction and fuzzed-out guitar solos to the triumphant horn parts that seemed to have stepped out of an Otis Redding classic to Antony's big, bellowing vocals. The fact that it makes someone so in love that he accepts physical abuse from his partner (""I accept and I collect upon my body, the memories of your devotion"") sound victorious shows Antony is a skilled storyteller as well as a skilled singer.

The opening song, ""Hope There's Someone,"" shows his strengths at the other end of the scale. It's a small, intimate song, a longing prayer for human connection made all the more poignant by the spare, piano-driven background.

Musical simplicity helps ""For Today, I Am a Boy"" as well, as the song builds from a quiet, childhood wish (""One day I'll grow up, I'll be a beautiful woman"") to a brash chorus of voices wanting the same thing.

The particulars Antony sings about may be foreign to most, but his broader themes of transformation and his dreams of belonging are universal. Same goes for his voice, which is too remarkable to remain a secret any longer. Antony's time has come.

""I Am a Bird Now,"" in stores now; Grade: A. Antony and The Johnsons play Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey St., Manhattan, at 8 p.m. Thursday. Tickets are $18 through Ticketweb, 866-468-7619 or www.ticketweb.com."

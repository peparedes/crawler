I don't know why there is not any snow yet, but there's not. 
There should be though.
I have bee waiting for it.
Cannot wait until the 18th or so cause that is when my big bro comes home and i have missed him ohh so much.
But AZ is good for him.
He found himself out there and he is now centered. 
He blossomed while he was away into a beautiful wild flower or great strong oak tree rather.
Life is going okay for now.
I don't exactly know what I want in it or rather who I want in it.
I am just not sure anymore.
Same old me, as I will always be when it comes to boys and relationships."

Will you still like me for who I am even when you've seen the other side of me? 
I need you in my life. 
Don't you see that it's you who keeps my cold heart warm? 
Will this altercation rip us apart?
Are you man enough to see past this and forgive me?
Are you man enough to take me for who I am?
Or am I to crazy, to much of a BITCH, to much of everything?
Am I what you need or am I just wasting my time with you?
Once again I've fallen back into my normal ways.
I thought this time was going to be wonderful.
I thought you would be the one I would keep for awhile.
Was I wrong in thinking that?
I always seem to push them away.
Why?
Why am I the person I am?
How is it I make everyone mad at me so easily?
I thought you were going to be different.
I guess I was wrong.
PROVE ME WRONG. PROVE TO ME THAT YOU ARE THE PERSON I THOUGHT YOU WERE."

The clouds have past.
The wind is gone.
Does that have to do with you?

Color has come back into my life.
I have something to live for again.
Might you be the reason?

True smiles are back on my face.
The fakeness is gone from me.
You could be the reason, right?

Are you the one to take me away from the world that i so hide from?
Are you the one to help me stop putting on a facade?
Are you the one to save me from myself?

"event","She was nine.
Not yet old enough to understand what was about to happen to her.
She was old enough to understand that she was frightened and unaware of her surroundings.
She had lost her way and thought someone might be following her.
Then Mr. Fringe came though the overgrowth and saw her. 
No longer was she frightened.
Her fear changed to happiness.
What are you doing out here?
Oh Mr. Fringe. I lost my way and then someone was following me. 
Someone was following you?
Yes and I became scared so I ran.
There is no one else in the woods my dear.
There's not?
No. Just you and I.
Oh. Could you please walk me home then. 
No. 
But Mr. F-...
No. You are going to stay here with me.
But i need to go home.
NO you don't. 
After that conversation her life was never the same again.
The next few hours she spent in agony.
Not understanding what was happening to her and not being strong enough to fight against it. 
She survived the many times he forced her and beat her.
She survived all the way up until the time she saw the knife.
That is when she realized that she would not be going home to Mommy and Daddy.
Ever.
Her name was Aribella.
And he was her third grade teacher."

"event","The sound of the dryer drying.
The sound of the dogs chewing.
The sound of my fingers typing.

They all bring be back to the present.
Yet they all take me away from the world.

How is that possible?
How can something bring you back to life? 
Yet be able to transport you to another time?

...If only I could answer all the questions in the world...
...That would be the most wonderful achievement of any living being...

The flowers are dead as they sit in the vase.
The clock flashes as it waits to finally be reset of the time. 
The laundry's done waiting to be folded and put away.
The dogs sit in wait for the food they are yearning to recieve.

Yet nobody runs to do these things.
Nobody moves to change a thing.
Life stands still as if time is standing still.
Not a thing happens when there is nothing coming home.
Everything stays exactly the same when the house of the living are now all dead."

Essays are easy to bullshit on.
  On things that are gay and dont make sense.
I'm not a very sensitive person.
  Person who laughed when I heard a guy got hit by a car.
Need a new guy.
  Guy who needs me, wants me. 
Needs to be amazing and the one.
  One who takes me for me and who I AM!"

  Crazier than i thought.
Bois are mean.
  Mean when they pick on me.
Life is better.
  Better then it was. 
It still sucks ass.
  Ass beacause its full of shit.
People are weird.
  Weirder then they first come off to be.
Now I've joined the club.
  Club where we all need help.
Bathrooms are nasty.
  Nasty with the smell, look, and feel.

The Good Life  

(Yeah, check me out)

When I look in the mirror
I can't believe what I see
Tell me, who's that funky dude
Starin' back at me?

Broken, beaten down
Can't even get around
without an old-man cane
I fall and hit the ground

Shivering in the cold
I'm bitter and alone

Excuse the bitchin'
I shouldn't complain
I should have no feeling
This feeling and this pain

As everything I need is denied me
And everything I want is taken away from me
But who do I got to blame?
Nobody but me

I don't wanna be an old man anymore
It's been a year or two since I was out on the floor
Shakin' booty, makin' sweet love all the night
It's time I got back to the good life

It's time I got back, it's time I got back
'n I don't even know how I got off the track
I wanna go back, yeah!

Screw this crap, I've had it!
I ain't no Mr. Cool
I'm a pig, I'm a dog
So 'scuse me if I drool

I ain't gonna hurt nobody
Ain't gonna cause a scene
I just need to admit that I want sugar in my tea
Hear me? Hear me?
I want sugar in my tea!

I don't wanna be an old man anymore
It's been a year or two since I was out on the floor
Shakin' booty, makin' sweet love all the night
It's time I got back to the good life

It's time I got back, it's time I got back
'n I don't even know how I got off the track
I wanna go back, yeah!

I wanna go back, wanna go back
'n I don't even know how I got off the track
It's time I got back, time I got back
'n I don't even know how I got off the track
I wanna go back, yeah

'Cause I don't wanna be an old man anymore
It's been a year or two since I was out on the floor
Shakin' booty, makin' sweet love all the night
It's time I got back to the good life

I wanna go back, wanna go back
'n I don't even know how I got off the track
It's time I got back, time I got back
'n I don't even know how I got off the track
(I wanna go back)
I wanna go back"

""The Hero Dies In This One""

AS I LEAVE HERE TODAY, APARTMENT 108
I'LL ALWAYS KEEP YOU IN MY HEART
Anderson is cold tonight,
The leaves are scattered on the ground.
I miss the seasons,
AND THE COMFORT OF YOUR SMILE.

SOMETIMES THIS ALL FEELS LIKE A DREAM.
I'M WAITING FOR SOMEONE JUST TO WAKE ME UP,
FROM THIS LIFE.

As I look out at these fairgrounds,
I remember how our family split apart.
I don't think I ever told you,
But I know you always did your best.
And the hard times,
They only made us stronger.

AS I SIT HERE ALL ALONE,
I WONDER HOW I'M SUPPOSED TO CARRY ON WHEN YOU'RE GONE.
I'LL NEVER BE THE SAME WITHOUT YOU, 
I LOVE YOU MORE THEN YOU COULD EVER KNOW.
SO MAYBE KNOW YOU FINALLY KNOW.
SOMETIMES WE'RE HELPLESS AND ALONE,
BUT YOU CAN'T LET TI KEEP YOU WEIGHED DOWN.
YOU MUST GO ON. 

DO YOU EVER FEEL LIKE CRYING?
DO YOU EVER FEEL LIKE GIVING UP?
I raise my hands up towards the sky,
I SAY THIS PRAYER FOR YOU TONIGHT,
BECAUSE NOTHING IS IMPOSSIBLE. 

AS I SIT HERE ALL ALONE,
I WONDER HOW I'M SUPPOSED TO CARRY ON WHEN YOU'RE GONE.
I'LL NEVER BE THE SAME WITHOUT YOU.
I LOVE YOU MORE THEN YOU WILL EVER KNOW.
SO MAYBE YOU FINALLY KNOW.
SOMETIMES WE'RE HELPLESS AND ALONE,
BUT YOU CAN'T LET IT KEEP YOU WEIGHTED DOWN.
YOU MUST GO ON.

(THE HARDEST PART ISN'T FINDING WHAT WE NEED TO BE, IT'S BEING CONTENT WITH WHO WE ARE.)

Stay who you are.
You must go on.
Stay who you are.

SOME OF THIS STUFF IN THIS SONG MAKES ME THINK OF MYSELF.....by telling me to stay who i am...BUT IF I DIDNT HAVE U IN MY LIFE I DONT NO WAT I WOULD DO...i WONT no how to carry on when ur gone....and i DO love u more then you could evr know.....aight now im goin to make myself cry so i have to stop....i hope u get to read this....I LOVE U SO MUCH...NO MATTER WAT....."

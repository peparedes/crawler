"event","<P>Today was kind of a depressing day, not to sound all disturbed or anything. Nothing really happened i mean its a monday, does anything exciting ever happen???? Anyways i can only remember from dinner time. We had breakfast for dinner and i, for one, quite enjoy that.. after dinner i was really full so i went to my room and slept. Apparently mark called and i talked to him on the phone and james was in my house at some point, but i remember none of this, I think people are trying to fuck with my head. So once i woke up i decided to take a walk around, i ended up walking the ""route"" i always took when me and dan used to walk around. Thats the like real sad a depressing part of the day. I mean it sucked i wasted so much of my time in those stupid streets, alleys and under the overhead bridge. I think when i sat under the overhead bridge by myself for a while it all sank in. ""What sank in?"" your probably asking and the truth is i don't know. It was just like this overwhelming wave of melancholy that flushed threw me. It sucked. After i made it home adrienne called me and asked if i wanted to dye my hair pink. so i went over her house and watched tommy get his hair dyed and i did mine a little also. but thats about it for the day..goodnight.</P>

"event","Tonight was a really good night. Honestly i havent come home on a friday night feeling this good in a while.. Anyways i went to Rooney's to see Rendered Doubtful, A Place Apart, Tormented, and I Am Enron. It was a pretty good show, it was also the first time i got to hear a lot of the RD's new stuff live.. so that was a plus. No more than 15 minutes after im there this girl come over to me and shes like ""hey come with my i want you to meet some of my friends, they think your hott"" and im like ""nah thats alright ill pass"" so james is like  ""screw this im goign with the girl"" then he comes back and is like "" dude here is the girls name and number she thinks your hott"" i dunno it was pretty funny i though... but then i saw hannah.. she looked really pretty so i went over to say Hi but i ended up staying with her for the rest of the night, which in no way at all was a bad thing... except when she tickled me.. because im the most ticklish person ever in the world.. and i hate it... but i can put up with it from her.. so eventually the show was over and we had to leave so i said goodbye and me james mark dan and bob went home.... all in all it was a pretty damn good night... but now im really tired to im gonna shower and go to bed.....

Anyways, im like real bored so ill recap the weekend or something starting with thursday.. so thursday i went to school and like waited around untill like 4:30 so i could leave... SO me, shane, craig, steph, and aaron went to the him concert in pittsburg.. so we drove on up.. walked over to the Rock Club and sat around untill HIM came one... the openers pretty much sucked... the like 2 HIM songs i heard were pretty good..but i ended up falling asleep at a random bar during the concert...dont ask me how i did it cause honestly i dont know how i did it....maybe cause i was high.. i dunno.. so then after that was over we reaked of cigarettes and we drove all the way to kings and got some eat in us... then weall went home..friday i pretty much slept the whole day cause im just gay like that. saturday i think i just layed around and ended up over shanes... but i wanted some pizza so i called up mark and had him meet me at Dicarlos.. so we hung out at dicarlos...i odered 5 pieces and they gave me 8... that kinda made me happy.. so we started to walk back over to shanes when we got stopped by jimmy t.... so we stood in the rode and talked to him for like an hour then eventually we ened up in his car and driving all over the world...well maybe only toronto, steubenville, and wintersville... yeah it was a pretty good night.. then last night was just one accident after another..layed around the house till about 5 then went out on a journey that got us banned from kings...simple as that...now im tired and hunrgy so deal with it..

"event","<P>hmmm lets see if i can recap this weekend correctly.... friday i came home from school rested up a bit and was real bored so i went over shanes and eventually craig showed up and we decided to go to toronto mart for some jones and we went in and got what we wanted then bounced out of that joint... so we just cruised around for a little while and drove threw some lakes... yes thats right lakes..... after driveig threw multiple lakes we decided to take a cruise down to newburg&nbsp;.. where shane waded out into the raging ohio river and stood on a picnic table...&nbsp;then evenually shane had to go home so me and craig wandered around toronto and what not then we met up with jimmy t. and followed him around and junk then we went out to kings.... me and jimmyt got some sweet hook-ups at kings... Lisa and Julie..... yeah so we hung out ther and ate some curly fries with cheese and drank some coffee... when we left we stopped over at jess jess's place and i gave the girls some stickers... then i went home and slept.... Saturday i woke up and just lounged around but i eventually went to church with shane and fam but it turns out we ended up having to serve with craig... so it was craig, pat and shane serving 5 o'clock mass saturday... yeah it was complete and utter caos well maybe not really.. but then i ran home and ate some junk and had the mom run me over to shanes and we took off and went to the central game... it was loads of fun... i dont really remember that much of it because the majority of the time i was there i was under the influence of the AC-DC no not the band im talking about the anti-christ, devil-child but anyway it was pretty fun maybe ill accompany shane to another.... afterwards we searched like fiends to find craigs lost tele but we never found it.... so me, shane, craig, mia, and mark went to kings and like got in fights and junk... but not really and i dont know why i said that...&nbsp;but it was like a lot of fun then we took mia home and look for craigs tele some more but never found it... so we all decided to go to my house for the night and it was crazy.... like pack of banshees or something... but likea lot of cool stuff happen and i dont feel like explaining it all.... if you really wanna know ill probably tell you about it but im not gonna in here.... but i eventually fell alseep then woke up as each person left the abode... then i jsut kinda lounged around and got on the internet.... but something really exciting happened.... <FONT color=#ff6600 size=6>ME AND JESS JESS GOT MARRIED!!!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=white>Its crazy yeah i dunno how it happened but were really married.... we have certificates and everything.. i dont even know what to say about it... then i went and got a shower and layed around in the basement ..then mo and jess (who is my wife) showed up at my home and got me to go on a walk with them.. it was pretty good exercise then they left and i went home.... and thus ends an absolutely fabulous weekend.....now that ive sed that the majority of you think im gay... and on that note.. goodnight</FONT></P>

Then we went tot he movies... i love that movie i swear it'll never get old no matter how many time i see it... it just keeps getting better.. at some point in the movie me and jess traded shirts and i wore hers for a little while.. after the movie was over we jetted over to outback steak house... it was pretty tastey... we left the waitor some shit ass tip because he was gay... then we were acting like a bunch of banshees on the way home... some how a bunch if stuff happened and i ended up here.. i dunno</P>

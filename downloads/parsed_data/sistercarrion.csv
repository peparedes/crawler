"event","Actual, genuine question from my 7 year old's homework tonight. It isn't meant to trick or anything, this is meant to be a straightforward multiplication and division based question:

""A shop puts eight bunches of bananas on display. Each bunch has the same number of bananas. Altogether there are 56 bananas. 

How many bunches of bananas are on display?""

Errr.. well, you've already stated that: ""eight bunches of bananas are on display"" !?! Going by the rest of the questions, what they really were after was ""How many are in each bunch?"" which is of course 7, but seriously? I wonder how many kids'll get caught out with that?

Not impressed!"

"event","URGENT! If anyone in the NESTON/PARKGATE area of the Wirral has lost a medium sized (around border collie-ish) black and white dog either today, or overnight, please get in touch as a matter of urgency with the RSPCA services <strong><font color=""#ff0000"" size=""4"">0300 1234 999</font></strong>. I spotted a dog around 1 hr ago (11.30am) running around on the marsh in Parkgate some considerable distance out, amongst the pools. Weather is horrendous here today, and I&#39;d hate to think of the poor sod stuck out there. It was far too far out to see whether it would come to call, and far too dangerous for me to attempt any sort of rescue myself :( The RSPCA have said there is a dog matching that description currently missing from Neston, and they&#39;re going to try to get in touch with the people, but I have no way of contacting them. If anyone is likely to be able to do any more, then please feel free to pass on my details. Thank you in advance. *stresses*<br /><br /><br />update: The owner of the missing dog just called.. looks like it *was* her dog that I saw. No idea how she&#39;s going to go about finding it :(<br /><br />further update: THEY FOUND THE DOG! Yey! The woman who&#39;d lost hers called again.. she found it.. it just wasn&#39;t hers though :( But yey for safe dog!<br /><br /><span class=""messageBody"" data-ft=""{&quot;type&quot;:3}"">It had wandered down towards the pub at the end of the parade, closer to shore, and so trotted over when they called out to it.

"event","39 weeks pregnant this week, and I&#39;m going in for a &#39;sweep&#39; in the morning. So very nervous. Baby&#39;s size is fine, my bloods for the diabetes are great.. still don&#39;t feel ready. Which I don&#39;t see changing really. I think parents are lying if they ever say they feel totally ready for it.<br /><br />If this sweep doesn&#39;t work, I&#39;m looking at possible induction, which I&#39;d rather not for a variety of reasons, paramount of which is that childcare for N is going to be a pain if I&#39;m likely to be in labour for a loooong time, also that inducing is meant to be more wearing, and also.. really don&#39;t fancy being suck in hospital waiting for labour to start. So.. yeah.. any thoughts encouraging babs along from here on in will be much appreciated.. very much appreciated. I mean, if induction happens, it happens, but I&#39;d rather not, if you see what&nbsp;I mean?<br /><br />---<br /><br />Living in Parkgate continues to be wonderful. We&#39;ve made the most of pre-baby time and have fitted in some gorgeous meals out while we can. Being out in the sticks is still taking some getting used to, but hopefully, before long at least one of us will be driving, and that&#39;ll make things easier. N starts his new school on Wednesday, an I keep having dreams about his uniform not being right, so&nbsp;I guess that makes me officially more nervous than him about it! Just hope I get to see his first day before hospital calls! Loads of stuff is still in boxes everywhere, but I&#39;m gradually getting better about letting people into the house, so that&#39;s pretty major progress for me.<br /><br />Think that&#39;s it for now.. will update this depending on what happens in the morning... eep!<br /><br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/sistercarrion/pic/00016eey/""><img alt=""Parkgate sunset 4/9/11"" src=""http://i189.photobucket.com/albums/z208/sistercarrion/macabreparkgateaugust2011147.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></a><br /><img alt=""Parkgate sunset"" src=""http://i189.photobucket.com/albums/z208/sistercarrion/macabreparkgateaugust2011098.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /><br />"

"event","<p>Hi guys!<br />A lot of you will already know that we're in the middle of moving out to Parkgate (whoop!), and if you didn't.. well, you do now! Tomorrow (Wednesday) sees us moving the majority of our 'big stuff'' over to the new place (we've already got a shitload of things up there, where the hell did I put all this stuff!?!).&nbsp; <br /><br />However, we've still officially got access to the Oxton flat until 7th August, and the phone line is staying on here for the time being too. We've still got outside to clear up (all our pots, bird tables and plants have to go) once we've sorted the flat, and the whole place needs a clean up too. Due to the ongoing saga of&nbsp;dodgy folk next door, we're not clearing the outside until the last possible moment to avoid the property looking empty before we're ready to completely hand everything back.&nbsp;So, we'll be back and forth for a bit. So, if you still have our old phone number, this'll still be active and receiving voicemail etc for a while yet. We don't have our phoneline on at the new place yet, but if you have it, J's mobile number will be the best/quickest way to reach us for the forseeable.<br /><br />So yeah.. I also don't know how soon we'll have PC access set up, so don't fret if you don't hear from me on the normal channels for a while, but believe me, as soon as I'm able, I'll be back on here!<br /><br />*flails*</p><br />"

We've been kinda' half-heartedly trying since mid last year, so it wasn't entirely unexpected, but the timing itself was a bit..'Wow!' :) I've been tapering off my meds, which added to the fibro/ pregnancy has wiped me out more than a little, but I'm getting there, slowly but surely.

Because I, for one, don't need my cousin's 12 year olds to find the mansex I write. 

The following line of code, though, doesn't just hide the repost boxes to you like the Greasemonkey code for Firefox going around does. It completely removes the option for everyone viewing your journal or community. I've done it for this comm as well as my personal journal. 

1. Go to Journal &gt; Journal Style 

2. Go to Customize your theme 

3. Go to Custom CSS 

4. Copy and paste .b-repost-item {display:none} (make sure you're just getting the bolded text) into the Custom stylesheet 

5. Save changes 

Now not only can you not crosspost comments, but anyone viewing your account can't either. This doesn't get rid of the reposting option when you're making a new entry, but at least that one's easy to avoid.&quot;"

"event","<p>Buried the three dead kittens this morning, turned out they all had the severe unoperable cleft palate problem, and the runty one who died very quickly also had a hare lip :( So, very sad, but at least we know it wasn't an infection which could passed to the remaining kittens. And Ghost!cat will be getting neutered as soon as the vet says it's okay after babies weaned, and the babies will be getting done as soon as they're of age/large enough, so no more risk of it happening again. Reading around, it looks like it's commoner amongst persian types than other breeds, so :((<br /><br />===========================<br /><br />Anyway.. onto the good stuff. Ghost!cat is proving to be a fabulous mum, protective and nudging the remaining two kittens into place, letting us take photos and check on them properly, whilst still very much on her terms.

"event","(Via <lj user=""docbrite""/>&nbsp; , and&nbsp;&nbsp;originally posted by <lj user=""fayanora""/>&nbsp;at <a href=""http://fayanora.livejournal.com/697232.html"">&quot;to the straight guy at the party last night&quot;</a> and ganked all over the place)<br /><br />There was a Craigslist posting that was an open letter &quot;to the straight guy at the party last night&quot;. Since Craigslist postings tend to be impermanent, here's a cut and paste:<br /><lj-cut><br />'<em>A&nbsp;mutual friend of ours threw a big party for her 30th birthday, tons of people were there and it was a lot of fun. Somewhere along the line you and I ended up on the balcony for some fresh air at the same time. We started chatting; we talked about sports, books, tv &ndash; discovered we both are about to start our masters degrees and spent some time debating the pro&rsquo;s and con&rsquo;s of the educational system. We talked about hanging out sometime, and you wanted to meet my girlfriend.<br /><br />I understand how upsetting it was for you when I blinked mildly in surprise and said I was here with my husband. I know it was a shock to your system, if your face had turned any paler I might have called 911. You made a good recovery though - that hurried mutter of &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not like that&rdquo; was very polite and you only knocked over two drinks and one vase in your hurry to rush to anywhere other than near me. I can&rsquo;t blame you &ndash; I forgot how delicate you straight boys are. So I wanted to give you a few helpful hints about where you went wrong last night.</em><br /><br /><em>1) As a general rule we don&rsquo;t walk around with big signs around our neck proclaiming our sexuality. No scarlet letters, no scent of hellfire and brimstone&hellip; sorry about that.<br /><br />2) We do not generally assume that everyone within 5 feet of us must also be homosexual &ndash; it was nice of you to immediately reassure me that you are hetero, but it was really unnecessary.<br /><br />3) Homosexuality is not infectious. While I am sure you meant no disrespect with your hasty departure; in the future you can rest assured that taking a few extra seconds in your mad dash for safety will not result in you being turned gay. It will however keep you from destroying expensive vases and knocking over senior citizens.<br /><br />4) This next one may come as a surprise; but you are not, in fact, irresistible. The fact that you have a dick does not instantly turn me into a bundle of uncontrolled lust. Contrary to popular opinion, being in the same room with a straight man does not cause a gay man to instantly lose all common sense and basic common courtesy. Though I am not so sure about the reverse.<br /><br />5) Homosexuals in general get a little irked when people treat us like some sort of leper. Rushing to another mutual friend of ours and advising him of my sexuality, so he could be &ldquo;forewarned&rdquo; was really uncalled for.<br /><br />6) Upon being told (by said mutual friend) to stop being an idiot and that you were not my type anyway&hellip; it generally confuses the issue when you then proceed to become upset that I DON&rsquo;T find you attractive. Three seconds ago you were running through a crowd of people with your hands cupped protectively over your junk as if I might attack you at any moment with a blowjob. See hint number 4.<br /><br />7) We homosexuals have an odd sense of humor &ndash; I can&rsquo;t help that. Something about watching you freak out as if all the demons of hell were after you just struck me as vastly amusing.<br /><br />8) While being pissed at me for dissolving into uncontrollable laughter might be understandable&hellip; gathering a couple guys together to &ldquo;teach the fag a lesson&rdquo; is not.<br /><br />9) You might also want to drink a little less and be a little more careful about the guys you approach for your little proto-hate-mob.<br /><br />10) Assuming the two tall muscle-bound bruisers must be uber-hetero and just as appalled by my presence as you was your first mistake. It was an understandable one though. How were you to know that pflag tshirt the first guy was wearing wasn&rsquo;t a sports team? Also the rainbow ring the second guy was wearing could have meant anything I am sure.<br /><br />11) In retrospect I suppose that upon hearing your not very subtle hate-talk and seeing who you were heading for; I could have said something instead of just laughing harder. I apologize for that. I should have just introduced you to my husband instead of letting you walk up to him and ask him if he wanted to help you teach &ldquo;that fag over there&rdquo; a lesson. I hope that broken nose heals up cleanly.'</em></lj-cut><br /><br /><br />Excellent stuff :D<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />"

"event","<p>Hellooo..<br /><br />Well, I know I said I was back, but now I really am. I'm having umm.. filtering issues with using Twitter, shall we say? It's immediacy has it's plus points and minuses, and right now, it's become brutally clear that the minuses are outweighing the good, so I'm going to take a bit of a break. I'm going to be reading everything still, and there's DMs and e-mail and stuff if you need to get in touch, but..<br /><br />*sighs*<br /><br />Okay, other reasons Twitter doesn't seem to be working out right now for me, My memory has always been dodgy,&nbsp; and I've really struggled with it over the years. It's the core of my OCD, that I'm terrified I'll forget everything if there isn't some record somewhere. At my worst this meant hoarding every single receipt, packaging box, wrapping, magazines everything. The OCD is mostly under control these days, but the urge to write stuff everywhere is still very much there.&nbsp; But since the fibromyalgia, and medication for mental health&nbsp;issues,&nbsp;my spelling has really gone downhill, and my cognitive function is just completely&nbsp;zapped a lot of the time. I used to tutor GSCE&nbsp;students, completed a degree, organised gigs, DJed..&nbsp; fuck. I worry so much that I'm never going to get it back, that it's lost forever in fog. Knowing that I know a word, and that I just can't 'reach' it is just so frustrating, and that's just the start. <br /><br />Anyway, I'm rambling.. point is that over the last year, I've started the fun of struggling mentally with sentence structure too. Looking back on tweets where I've really fucked up what I wanted to say makes me feel mortified, and all you can do on Twitter is delete. Which is.. not good for me. I know that's part of the point of Twitter, and part of the joy of it, but at the moment that's causing me more stress than benefit, soo..<br /><br />Also, I don't use IM as my hands cramp up, but also... I.. I'm terrified of saying stuff that I don't actually mean. I know that sounds utterly irrational and idiotic, but hey, mentally scewed thoughts here. And it looks like Twitter is proving difficult in a similiar vein. I like that on LJ I can filter and cut, edit if needed when I realise I've said something incorrectly. Twitter? It's just out there, and if you fuck up, there's fuck all you can do about it apart from apologise profusely.<br /><br />So, I'm sucking it up and owning that I fucked up with spoilers on Twitter, and I apologise if you were&nbsp;affected. I think the sensible thing for me to do is to withdraw from Twitter a little, and come back here a bit more. I can take my time here, and relax a lot more about my writing, and not feel as anxious and&nbsp;paranoid as I do over there. And, well if I take my time to post, rather than rushing through a Tweet, I'm less likely to fuck it up. That's the theory anyway.<br /><br />So, sorry again, and I love you all. Yes, even you.<br /><br />xx</p><br />"

Whether that be fic, painting, jewellery, sculpture etc etc etc.. I don't really mind. My memory&nbsp; and cognitive 'fog' are often pretty bad these days (It took me nearly an hour to just edit this little bit, and I'm still not happy with it!), and I wanted to create something that'll help me to push for&nbsp;those creative leaps, and hopefully in turn, keeping my mind busy will help with the 'fog'.<br /><br />So there's likely to be pictures of things in my life that make me happy (don't worry, all NSFW will be clearly marked and behind a cut!), lyrics, phrases, pictures gleaned from the internet, and personal images from my stash.<br /><br />Comments are open, and I'm leaving these posts publically viewable, as I'd like feedback, links if you've found something inspiring yourself, general crafty chat about things that&nbsp;come up,&nbsp; projects, talk with as many people as possible about this.<br /><br />So, yeah.. here goes!<br /><br /><img alt=""Beginning"" src=""http://i189.photobucket.com/albums/z208/sistercarrion/beginning-quotes.jpg?t=1270163084"" /><br />(Image via <a href=""http://www.quotesandsayings.com/quotes/beginning/""><font color=""#0000cc"">www.quotesandsayings.com/<wbr></wbr>quotes/beginning/</font></a>&nbsp;)<br />&nbsp;</div>"

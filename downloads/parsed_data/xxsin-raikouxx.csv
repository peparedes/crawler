"event","Well, today was...interesting. Yesterday night was...interesting. Want to know why?&nbsp;

...Sure? Mkay, here's why.

Yesterday night we had a man and a woman in 220 who were wanted in Jacksonville and LakeCity. Why, I don't know; but we were told not to approach them and to not be around them as they are E.X.T.R.E.M.E.L.Y dangerous! So much, in fact, that the cops got here with fucking ASSAULT RIFLES. And I'm just thinking ""Hell yeah, some excitement!"" It ended peacefully,though. Both were taken into custody and nothing was really damaged 'cept a door.


Today.....on the other hand, I came face to face with a life and death situation. Literally. I was held at gun point while at work today by a little old miniature Santa Claus. This gun was real and it was loaded and he made it quite clear that it was dangerous. I was just as calm as I could be and told him if he was THAT desperate for a room and money, then the manager could help him. Our manager is known for being super awesome and nice. It took a few minutes of calm persuasion but he finally relented and let me go. I locked the drawer and the door behind me, left and went to the resturant where my manager was eating lunch with a friend. I told her what was going on, she called the cops, and the man was arrested for attempted armed robbery. I asked Detective Green if the man was going to be jailed and he said yes. Which is good because I would have filed a lawsuit and pressed charges for armed robbery and attempted murder."

I'm so tired....so tired. It's around 6pm and I've had two hours sleep in the last 48 hours, I think. I just got home from the hospital where I'd taken Kelly. She's sick, extremely so.


She's probably dying..Inside and out.

She has AIDS, liver failure, gullstones, and also a severe chest infection as well as dementia which is a severe type of memory loss. She's on so many medications to try and keep her alive that it's likely she'll kill herself trying to do the opposite. I was really surprised when she asked for me to sit with her Wednesday after we went shopping for groceries. She had a bad headache, a migraine, and she'd never had one before. She told me she felt so scared because a member of our family had a bad migraine, hit the floor trying to get help and ended up choking on her vomit, slipping into a coma and never waking up. I guess she was afraid that would happen, considering she couldn't talk to begin with. When her headache started to lift, she talked and told me she hadn't wanted to face reality the last four or five years. And that she'd lost so much time with the people important to her and her own children because of sex, drugs, and alcohol.

I don't know what to honestly think, but I know it's a possibility that I may end up being a parent/guardian, after all. An extremely good possibility. Kelly has very few family left that wants to directly help her; most just avoid the situation. Then again, I learned yesterday night my dad's been drinking and getting drunk again. He's reverting back to the times when he was a jerk. Mom told me today in the elevator, after I'd gone to get her from ICU, that he had accused her of spending all their money. So they're going broke. I may not have an internet for much longer considering I may not even have a job now.

It's pretty much going to hell here and getting worse. Even Hell seems like a miniature paradise with the way things are going. I wish I had the guts to walk and out and leave everything behind, but I don't. I know if I left, when I came back I wouldn't have a family anymore.

I'm getting caught up with everything here and I'm beginning to think I might lose myself somewhere down the line. I'm getting so ugly in nature lately, considering I cussed out two co-workers within a one week span. It's bothering me because I keep getting passes by this guys at work, and I don't want their attention. The friends I had online used to be my everything, but most of them have lives, and the others don't want me to begin with. Most of them don't even know half of me like they thought they did. I got a lot of blame for things.

There's only one person on here who seems interested in what's going on in my life and I'm sorry that I'm breaking my promise to come and see Julie. I wanted to go to her graduation, but unfortunately, I'm sure that's not going to happen. 



NOTE:
   Due to being unable to see properly, I'll continue this on another post. Also, I'm going to post things about myself that none of you knew, maybe then you'll understand why Shi is Shi and no one else.</font></p></div><br style=""CLEAR: left"" />"

"event","Yay, an update.

How exciting. (Not.)

Actually, not surprisingly, I have bad news again. Other than the usual stressed out rant my grandma from New York is in the hospital with a stroke. My uncle was airlifted to Gainsville yesterday for having broke his back when his horse threw him off. I've cut off contact with a friend, though it's not a complete cut. More or less through IMs,only.

Finals are coming..I'm glad I have only one to really worry about. It's the one which I have the most trouble in,too. I wish Drew were living down here to give me a hand with math. I'm bad at it. Science I don't have take; English is my portfolio which I'll do this week, Student Success is my journals..I need to do about a months worth of entries before turning it in. 

I'm still stressing about a career choice because I can't seem to make up my mind. I want to do one thing but turn around and find something else to do. It's not the schoolwork that bothers me, it's the fact that I want a job that I'm going to enjoy and not hate; but get paid good money for. I guess I spent my life watching my dad hate every job he's ever taken and it's passed down to me. 

Anyways...Mom warned me not to be the third victim to go to a hospital. I have no idea why she said that as I""m not sick or anything. I guess maybe she's worried I might be next. Our family trouble comes in threes..my grandma and uncle have already suffered. Wonder who's next."

<p dir=""ltr"" style=""MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px"">I'm going to take a break from the whole ""IMing/Chat"" ordeal thing. I'm stressed out and not handling my temper and irritation well right now and I'm trying my hardest to not ruin anyone's fun.

It doesn't mean I don't want to talk to you, it simply means that I need a break.&nbsp;(And I have a lot of homework and studies I need to tend to first.)<br /><br />I'll probably be non-reachable through normal IMs for maybe..a..week and a half. I'm trying to time it with someone elses visit so I can stay out of their way. I'm stressed and considering I tend to be a blunt individual, I'm trying to play nice and let things go smoothly.</p>

<br />Now, the good news...<br /><br />On April 6th, last Thursday, I participated in a Science Competition and actually won third place, plus $50. Kashanda was my partner and together we worked on ""Blood Diamonds"" or just a diamond mined for illegal purposes. I thought that this was really good news, so I wanted to share it with everyone. Now you know. :3<br /><br />So anyways..that's it,really. Make sure you read the ""Read This"" link as it's important - especially if you've gotten into the habit of talking to me."

"event","<P>This week was fairly enteraining in way of me making an ass of myself. Nothing to eventful happened up until mom had to go to the doctor's Monday afternoon to have her staples removed. I went in with her to see the staples getting removed -and for those who knows me you know what's coming- so I'm sitting there, doing good by not being sick or pale or shit, when it happens.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Half away down the line of staples and I'm bolting from the room, making a hard left and vomiting into the toilet. Ugh. When I came out a pregnant woman was at the door waiting for me to get out. Double ugh. I decided after that to just sit in the 'effing waiting room until mom came out. She grinned like holy hell at me. She KNEW I was going to ditch. I can't handle other people's stitches...and needles...I can't stand needles...I honestly have ZERO pain tolerance (minus cramps and headaches). I try passing out with needles so I have no idea what possesed me to go in with mom to see her STAPLES being removed! I had enough trouble with my stitches alone. e-e ::Rolls eyes.::<BR></P>
<P>School is alright..I've missed three days so far which isn't bad compared to my 'highschool' attendance. One of those days I was not feeling good, another was a free day, and the other I actually had some kind of respiratory attack.&nbsp; I have shitloads of homework/study to do,as well. And our Sci. teacher was out on a meeting and upped our Chapter Two test by almost a week. I got an e-mail last night with the test guide saying 'MY LECTURE STUDENTS HAVE A TEST TOMORROW LOL!'. So I had to cram slightly. I knew some of it, but not all as I'd missed the previous class.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>On a seriously random note I need to change my shirt...my new bra fits great but it leaves just a tiny gap in my shirt so you can literally look over my shoulder and down my shirt...</P>
<P>So other than mostly that..and homework stuff....plus sitting in traffic for thirty minutes today because of stupid-ass-electricians-who-can't-bloody-well-READ-THE-FUCKING-SIGNS...I'm good...And paranoid. Cops are everywhere and I have issues with men in blue,black,uniforms in general. Especially ones that know my family,tote guns with live ammunition, and night sticks that could crack my skull with one swing. HOWEVER. Most of the cops here are pudgy, over-fed,over-paid, wankers with foul dispositions and even fouler BO. So...I'm good for the moment. </P>"

Mom's surgery went well, she's out and about doing her usual routine. I'm hiding over at her house to avoid Nana and the three childern since she's just going all-out on the poor kids. I can't stand seeing her being such a fuck so I avoid going there at all when they're there.

<P>I have..more to do, I believe..but that's it for homework. Than comes studying time. Blegh, the wonders of school...Again..Least it's not nearly as bad as highschool and middle school.</P>"

"event","<P>Okie-dokie, I finally managed to squeeze some time in for this journal entry. And no, I'm hopefully not going to rant and rave or bitch this time either. For once I'd like to post something that isn't me going off the handle or making an ass of myself in a public place. So, I've decided to just post about college.<BR><BR>IT'S BORING.</P>
<P>SSSSSAAVVVEEE MEEE~!</P>
<P>My schedule is (so far):</P>
<P>Monday/Wednesdays-<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; English Composition 1 with Mrs. Smith at 8:30am-9:45am.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; Earth Science Section 4 with Mr. Kane at 10:00am-11:15am.</P>
<P>Tuesdays/Thursdays-<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; Prealgebra with Mr. McAdams' at 8:30am-9:45am.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; Student Success with Coach Howard(woman) at 10:0am-11:15am.</P>
<P>Home thus far:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;<EM> English</EM>- Read all of chapter one,take notes, read the petition essay, write and type a one page journal entry on both in MLA format-due Feb. 13 with other journal entries. Run to Learning Resource Lab to get a red 'sticky' for ID card. <STRONG>I've done..er...the reading. The journal entry I won't do until after we have the class dicussion about it so I can get good notes.<BR></STRONG>&nbsp;&nbsp; <EM>Earth Science</EM>- Go online and print out all 70 pages of the study guide for this semseter. Print out the syllabus and review chapter one at home. <STRONG>Done.</STRONG><BR><EM>&nbsp;&nbsp; Prealgebra</EM>- None. (God, I already love this teacher. He said he doesn't assign homework often.)<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; <EM>Student Success</EM>- Read the Quick Start to College Life, read Chapter One and do the assignment at the end of the chapter. Keep a DAILY journal of school activity. (Ex: Did I study? If so, how long and what subject? What grade did I make on a test? Etc. Personal issues are welcome,too.) <STRONG>Working on it, just got the assignment today. And in a way, what I post about my studies here will probably later be in my assignment journal.</STRONG></P>
<P>Anyways, that's that. My teachers are cool and there aren't any that I dislike really. My english teacher is sorta wacky but she's just out-going and those people tend to...erm,worry me a little. We have plenty of presentations and I have to teach the class on Chapter Ten when we get to it. (omg, saveme.X_X) I HATE PRESENTATIONS DAMNIT! =O= Anyways. I don't plan on being active in class unless asked to. &gt;.&gt;; They said I'm supposed to but they can kiss my white Irish ass,too. I am NOT volunateering to make a fool of myself like I did in English. <BR><BR>..Oops, that was turning into a rant. &gt;:l; Gomen ne.</P>
<P>Aside from college here's what's going on:</P>
<P>Hospitalization Friday...Mom's having surgery. She's asked me to take her in and care for her..She just called me from the doctor's office while I was napping and told me that she was going to have surgery. Blew me out of the water. I couldn't sleep after that. To be honest I could handle my dad dying, but my mother's death would be a tremendous blow. I'm not sure I'd recover from that so early in my life.</P>
<P>Again, please keep in mind that with this college stuff plus my normal family and life issues, and work, I'm probably going to have less patience than normal. (Duo&gt; Did you have any to begin with? &gt;3)....e__e; XO JUST BE PATIENT WITH ME! I'm TRYING my best to not chew people out; I know some of you are having a hard time with changes in your life. And I'm trying not to be an asshole as usual and be blunt by saying what's on my mind. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>One last thing: for those of you who are actually SULKING because I don't have time to RP/Talk/Whatever with you...Holy shit just deal with it. And does anyone want to come here to slaugther a little fucker that belongs to my grandmother? I hate him. I'm really considering 'accidently' having him get loose. =__=</P>"

Anyways, it's 5pm now and I have to go to work tonight. I work later than usual so I won't even get off until like 7am in the morning tomorrow anyways..Only to come home, shower and get ready again, take my Nana into town for her doctors' appointment.

Over all, I probably won't get home until 2pm or so tomorrow afternoon. <BR><BR>I have such a busy day ahead of me. @~@</P>"

"event","Christmas,over all, was good. I didn't get alot but than again that's cool by me. 

Things I got:

Mom and Dad: 
A MUCH needed cell phone. (For emergencies only. If you call me and it's not an emergency, I'll fucking kill you. Literally.)
A dragon inscent holder.
And a dragon celtic box.

Aunt and Uncle:
A dragon steering wheel for my car.

Nana:
Matching driver/passenger seat covers.

There was one thing that I wanted badly and I've asked for it EVERY Christmas since I was about 15. And that is a laptop. God how I want one.It doesn't even had to be an expensive one! There was a really great one at Dell this year for $750 and it had just about EVERYTHING on it. But I didn't get it,of course. Which is fine, I'm still happy with what I did get.

And the food..
O
M
G
The food. 

I think I died and went to heaven. It was so nummy. AND NO KELLY!!! That was the BEST Christmas gift of all time! NO FUCKING WHORES!

So that's my Christmas..Now for todays' post.

I'm cranky, I'm pissed off and if anyone even attempts to piss me off more I'll rip you a new one. I only just got up an hour ago(Gotta work tonight, so I sleep late) and whatdoyouknow? My Nana's harassing me about doctor's appointments, my work shoe is missing so I have to use mine,(Meaning= if the floors wet/greasy, I'll fall.)And Shi+just getting up+being harassed= NOT A HAPPY CAMPER. I read a journal entry that just completely set me off and yeah, I'm sure when you read this you'll know who I'm talking about. And being a blunt Shi, I did post what I thought. Which may or may have not been nessecary but I do not believe in lying about what you feel. xl And no, I'm not a bit ashamed to be talking about it. >_x I need to get back on my Effexor I do believe. However, I'm trying to learn to do with my mood swings on my own and without the help of medication. So bear with me.

...e___e And I hear that dog at the door again, scratching on it. =_=; I hope he gets run over. I hate dogs."

"event","<P>Jesus Christ I really hate people sometimes. I'm so fuckin' frustrated right now that I'm half crying, half snarling at anyone that gets in my way. I pretty much snapped at Bonnie(a co-worker whom I no longer like) this morning when she asked me ""Why are you so quiet, girl? n n""&nbsp; I basically just snapped at her that ""I'm tired!! &gt;I"" and walked off,refusing to speak to her after. Due to a whole lot of shit that her and Jean did to me behind my back they've lost all my respect. And furthermore, I refuse to do anything for them. :D And the good thing is is that I won't get into trouble either! Because if they even REMOTELY suggest I'm not doing my job I can tell them to talk to Borie and not have to do jack-shit. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The bad thing about last night was was that I was more sick than usual. Aside from the normal symptoms of nausea, diarreha and that odd headache I was extremely disoriented and dizzy. Insanely so. To the point where I thought I was going to lose conciousness and have Kim, the manager there, call an ambulance. I'm to the point where I'm considering just going to the hospital myself and checking in. That SHOULD tell you how bad I'm feeling. Mom's off tomorrow, though I have to work again tonight and won't get home until five in the mornin' or so, but she said she'd take me into the doctor. She said it probably isn't nessecary to go since she's thinking it may be my medication. Currently I'm on Prilosec and Effexor; the Prilosec is for nausea and heartburn, the Effexor for my mood swings. She said to stop taking Prilosec and try taking Pepcid instead along with my Effexor first thing in the morning instead of at night.</P>
<P>I suppose I'm a little bit stressed out as well with everything going on. It is the holiday's and we haven't heard from my cousin, Kelly, in almost two months. My Nana, the one who thinks Kelly has a ""heart of gold"" (::CoughBULLSHITCough::), won't show up and is convinced something's wrong. Yeah..something is wrong..</P>
<P>God fucked up..</P>
<P>And created that whore.</P>
<P>SO..It's probably going to just be myself, Nana, mom and dad, and my aunt. Usually we have all those plus my uncle, three kids, Kelly and whoever she's fucking at the time over. For those of you who know me, you know I'm anti-social and do just about anything to avoid family get-togethers. However, I'm sorta looking forward to a 'no-kid-no-Kelly' Christmas. ::Laughs.:: Mom said not to look forward to it because it might not happen. She said 'pretend you're upset about it so that it'll happen!'. She doesn't like Kelly anymore than I.</P>
<P>I'll probably have my Nana call in-sick for me tonight and just say I'm going to the doctor's tomorrow. I don't feel like working right now and I do feel rather ill. And if I call in I can also get some things done that I meant to a while ago,such as:&nbsp; getting gifts wrapped and boxed for shipping, sign Christmas cards and clean my disgusting room. I'm really sorry but unfortunately only one person is getting an actual written letter. I didn't have time, nor the patience, to sit and write them all out. However..the lucky individual getting a letter is...!@@! Julie~! Yay. 0_o; So..anyways... So anyways, I think I'll go watch cartoons now. See ya later. &lt;333 all. XO EVERYONE EXCEPT GNAT AND MEG NEED TO SEND ME ADDRESSES!...Mark, Nii-san..this means you to. I wasn't able to find anything to buy..but I can send you a card with my lurve,right? XD</P>"

But all in all my week hasn't been to bad. I'm thinking about getting my third piercing whenever I'm off next and maybe consider my tattoo. However, I haven't decided whether or not I want a tattoo simply because when I get old, I can't take it off and old people and tattoo's don't mix.</P>
<P>In other news, I recieved my award letter from the college today so I'm pretty sure I'll be getting into school in January. And to be honest I'm not really wanting to go- but I don't want to flip burgers all my life either. I don't make bad money there, I actually make $100 just working three days or so. Which isn't to bad considering my town is uber small. And even if I don't graduate from college at least I'll have the knowledge of what I did learn while I was there,right?</P>

"event","<P>Yeah, I know I've been gone and just 'dissappeared' for a while but I was extremely busy with..things. More or less, in between working, being very sick, and fucking with college I haven't had the time, nor energy, to get online. So quit your worrin'. I'll just break everything down into groups so you'll know what's been going on.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><lj-cut text=""Work""><BR>Work = a load of bullshit. While I actually enjoy my shifts I do not enjoy the fact that the managers are expecting me to do their job and keep tabs on the inventory and call in things when we run out. Saturday night/Sunday morning we had no McGriddles, no Apple Pies, Coke, Sprite, Dr. Pepper, Sweet/Unsweet tea, any buns for the lunch meats(hamburgers, Big Mac's, etc), Oreo Cookies, Ranch Dressing, lids for medium cups, coffee cup lids, hard eggs, grapes and some other stuff I can't think of. It was just insane when the morning manager came in, realized this and was all ""....Omg, wtf?!"" First off, it's NOT my fucking job to ensure things run smoothly there. It's MY fucking job to COOK and CLEAN and NOTHING MORE so don't get a fucking attitude about how I'm not doing my job. Plu, they upped my position so I'm training all the new recruits that come in night-shift. So,yeah,whatever for all that shit.<BR></lj-cut><BR></P>
<P><lj-cut text=""Sickness/Hospital Time""><BR>And yes, I've been really ill lately. My cold was horrible and Tuesday of last week my mom actually had to come over because I pulled my shoulder muscles so bad I could barely move it. And with my cold I was one very unhappy kitsune-person. Today, I was so sick that I almost had to call the hospital/mom to come and get me because I could barely drive properly. We're sitting up there in Apple Bee's eating lunch when I suddenly feel very ill. Came home after thankfully not getting into a wreck, called mom and talked to her..Had my blood pressure taken, blood sugar, temperature and all sorts of things done. Mom came home after telling me to sleep until she did, did all that again and came to the conclusion that one:&nbsp; I'm not eating enough and I need to drink more water. Lots and lots more apparently. At least 64oz. of it every day. My blood sugar and pulse rate were very high as well and that wasn't good. Had her really worried..So she woke me up and did all that stuff like I said...and dad comes in, utterly freaked out and thinking I'm dying or something. Grumbled that I wasn't eating enough and I guess they're right since I've lost quite a bit of weight. But anyways, the problem was : nauseous, dizziness, stomach aches, exhaustion(I had to struggle to wake up literally) and I've had over 24 hours of sleep just Monday and today so you KNOW I was very tired; pressure in the head, congestion in the head, etc. I nearly landed in the hospital..if I'm not better by tomorrow, I think mom's seriously considering taking me.<BR></lj-cut><BR></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I guess that's it really..I'm in charge of Thanksgiving this year...we have the kids over at Nana's so she's bitchy as fuck which means we're fighting non-stop.I cannot handle having those kids over there with me..I just cannot. I do not, and I am NOT going to try either, to have patience. Kelly can get her pyscho-fucking ass over there and pick her fucking brats up. OH YEAH. If you hadn't heard, Chris, her used-to-be-boyfriend-who-gave-her-AIDS-supposedly tried to kill himself...The entire side of his window complex is covered in blood because he slit his throat and wrists. Said ""he'd kill himself if Kelly didn't go&nbsp; back to him"". ::shrug.:: He's in the hospital now..than he goes straight to the Pych. Ward where he'll spend the rest of his life being a nut case. Fucking loon.</P>"

"event","<P>So yesterday wasn't a great day. More or less I found out that I can't stand one of my co-workers and that working day shift is a real killer. First off, her name is Nadia and she was the original girl who trained me before I was changed to Dustin. Nadia seemed cool at first but now that I've seen her work two days in a row the only thing I want to do is smash her face to the grill and hope she burns to death. She's so aggravating. I was so mad with her yesterday that Dustin actually made me take a break so I wouldn't march up front and knock her flat on her ass. Later on when I was calm and Nadia was gone he told me she always acts like that. I'm working night shift from now on JUST to avoid that little shit-face.</P>
<P>Grandma's here to (the one from New York) and she'll be here for about a month or so. She's supposed to leave on the first of December.</P>
<P>I guess I outta post that there's another problem in the family again. Supposedly Kelly's doing drugs again and she broke up <EM>again</EM> with Chris. So when she had Ron, her-buddy-who-got-her-hooked-on-drugs-supposedly, dropped off her kids and picked them up again Sunday night; dad went and questioned him. From what I was told Dad asked him if Kelly was into drugs again and he said ""Maybe."" I'm guessing he asked other things and when Nana found out she went off the charts with him. She's still pissed off and this was a few days ago.</P>
<P>Also I went to the doctors a week or two ago(finally) after much prodding from my mom and Nana. I was told I have symptoms of being 'bipolar'. Which would account for my mood swings and intense PMSing. I was stuck on Effexor,which I'm still taking, and will be going back to the doctor's Monday for a follow-up examine. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I guess really that's all I want to write down.</P>"

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><lj-cut text=""Moving Troubles""><BR>Okay so this whole moving thing isn't working..In fact, it's really taking its' toll on me and my Nana. Nana won't give me the space I need to move in and if she thought I was going to move into that room,with only the space SHE wants to give me she's DEAD FUCKING WRONG! She won't move some things out of the room because ""It doesn't look good in the living room/kitchen/my bedroom/whatever!"" so that leaves me cramped for space. And she's already starting to give me shit about my posters...I'm NOT throwing away all my dragon posters. Fat fucking chance.Another thing I'm really worried about is the kids and my Nana's dog, Tao-shin, who's a little Shiz shu or something like that. He's so damned annoying..I want a lock on my door but I know if I even ask Nana about it she'll be all ""Well,maybe you shouldn't move over here,than."" I want a lock because I do NOT want those fucking little bastards (aka my cousins) in my room and they WILL go back there. And I don't want Tao-shin back there either. I hate them. So that's another problem. I've got many more but I'm getting mad just writing this.<BR></lj-cut><BR></P>
<P><lj-cut text=""Another Grandmother To Take Care Of""><BR>Also my grandmother from New York will be here next Friday. So my dad's really leaning on me to ""get my shit out of the room this weekend"" so he can fix the hole in the floor. He doesn't seem to understand I have no room to move into Nana's. Plus mom wants me to stay..She's asking me to call and find a bunk bed and just share my room with grandma for a month. I barely have enough room for ME, what makes her think both grandma and I can live in the same closet? <BR></lj-cut><BR></P>
<P><lj-cut text=""School/Work/Doctor's""><BR>School is coming up..and mom seems to think I can work up enough cash to go to college by January working weekends for McDonald's. Uhm..no. I""m so frustrated I don't even WANT to go now. So she's nagging at me to decide now whether I need to go to school and work, or just get a full time job and fuck school. And she also seems to think that I can take care of Nana, go to school, and work at the same time...It's almost impossible to get the doctor's to work around my schedule because they're only open certains times of the week and day.<BR></lj-cut><BR></P>
<P>So if by chance I really rag on you for this month and next...just know I'm under lots of pressure from both sides of my family. And I'm not taking well to having to suffer through it. I'm a strong-minded person and I'm usually laid back but some things I won't tolerate. I haven't really written most of what's going on down but I needed to vent something or else I was going to start having a cow. Literally. So I'm tired and I'm cranky...most of you know when I'm like this you either leave me the fuck alone or I'll chew you up and spit you out as nothing but a pile of half digested flesh. (Got the point? Good.) Kirei..&lt;33 Lovely, please please please take care of yourself. I'm worried about you. </P>"

This weekend I work again, but I'm thinking since Julie has Friday off I might reschedule so I can stay home to catch up with her.</P>
<P>As for today. It was pretty cool...I went out to dinner with my grandmother and was pleased that I had money to pay for it. Than we went shopping at Walmarts because she needed groceries. Uhm..that's it really.<BR><BR>I'm moving into my grandmother's next week so I dunno if/when the computer will be hooked up. I probably won't be able to be on for long periods of time because I'll have dial-up again and my grandmother gets plenty of phone calls. I'm trying to decide if I just want to get another phone line put up, hook up my computer and just keep dial-up than. DSL gives me enough shit at home anyways.</P>
<P>I think that's all really...Dad went fishin'...<BR><BR><lj-cut text=""Kelly: Another Chapter Beginning?""><BR>So..here's some good news for those of you who keeps up with the events in my life. Kelly, if you remember is my cousin who has three childern. At points she would randomly abandoned them on my grandmother and take off without any supplies for her childern. At some point my parents and I thought she had&nbsp; been on drugs as she took her $3000 income tax check and bolted. But now..she seems to be doing well. Her and Chris have keep solid jobs and a home for a couple months. Not to mention Kelly is close to getting her license as a professional massage therapist. Her childern are happy and doing very well in school,to. Her and her mother are back on good terms and it seems that over all, things are settling down. I hope it stays this way. I hope that she's gotten her shit together and can settle down and live a good life. In a way I understand what she went through. Having a nervous breakdown does things to you and it's really hard to get back up to the par. But she's doing it now, I think. I pray for her.<BR></lj-cut><BR></P>"

<P>I had orientation today...and omg I could have murdered Pam,my supervisor, when I went back to drop off the papers and shit. I make $6.20 to start which isn't bad...considering it's only on weekends and during the week. I got paid today as well for two hours of orientation. Annnddd....she told me that orientation was at 3 so I was there at 2:30. ( I HATE being late for ANYTHING.I wouldn't even be late to my own funeral.) But when I got there and sat down, I was told by Sandra, the orientation prep. that it doesn't start till 4..So I had to wait for over an hour and a half..and that bit ass. <BR><BR>I have..multitudes of paper work to fill out still..like direct deposit and health benefit forms...OH. Sandra was explaining direct deposit to us and told us that if we could do that..to do it. Because our checks come in from Ohio and one year it snowed so bad that no one could get the checks out. And everyone who had direct deposit had their money, but everyone who didn't, didn't have a paycheck for that time. It was funny. We also get one free meal when we work..We get a sammich, fries, and a drink..Basically a combo meal but I'm rather hoping I can change it in occasionally and just get a salad..Some of their sammichs are disgusting,really. XD; I won't eat a sammich,fries, and soda from them every work shift. I'll barf.</P>
<P>Now..going to fill out more paperwork!</P>"

I'm already researching characters for you, so all you&nbsp; have to do it tell me who you are and I'll e-mail the appropriate information.</P>
<P>Keep in mind that tomorrow(Tuesday) I go downtown for my orientation about my job. So if I'm not on for a while I'm probably working my ass off. Also, my grandmother is...ill, I think. She looks like she's in need of some serious medical attention so if I'm cranky, sorry. Taking care of someone isn't as easy as some think.</P>
<P>Other than that...&gt;l; Well,that's all for now. I've gotta get dressed (as I'm sitting in nothing but a towel) and go fetch dinner from uptown for daddu. e-e; Julie has me hooked on salad's thank you. &lt;33 I LURVE YOU JUUULLIIEEE. XOOO.....</P>

<P><FONT style=""BACKGROUND-COLOR: #c0c0c0""></FONT>&nbsp;</P>
<P><FONT style=""BACKGROUND-COLOR: #c0c0c0""><lj-cut text=""Moving?""><BR>Mom and dad are SERIOUSLY considering moving but there's a slight argument over where to move. Mom wants to move to New York and Dad wants to move OUT of the U.S to like..Ireland or something. The hurricanes are supposed to only get worse as the years go on and double; so they're all ""OMFGGOTTAMOVE."" I don't have much sway in where or when we move but I'm hoping my opinion MIGHT make a difference in the end. So...if I move and get an opinion...I want to move to Colorado or North Carolina...As those two are the closest to me.<BR></lj-cut><BR></FONT></P>
<P><FONT style=""BACKGROUND-COLOR: #c0c0c0""></FONT>&nbsp;</P>
<P><FONT style=""BACKGROUND-COLOR: #c0c0c0""><lj-cut text=""Job >l""&gt;<BR>So I got a job but I don't know my schedule or anything yet. I should know more Tuesday of next week after about 3pm in the evening. The manager that I spoke with told me they were looking for someone to work Friday-Sunday and occasionally during the week. But whether it's during the day, or at night, I don't know. I wanted to work during the week so I could see/talk/RP with you guys during the weekend.<BR></lj-cut><BR> </FONT></P>
<P><FONT style=""BACKGROUND-COLOR: #c0c0c0""></FONT>&nbsp;</P>
<P><FONT style=""BACKGROUND-COLOR: #c0c0c0""><BR><lj-cut text=""Nana""><BR>I..might be moving away from my folks if they leave the state. My grandmother is getting steadily worse and SOMEONE has to care for her. So chances are when I get this job and it goes steady, I'll be moving in with her until she passes away. I take care of her anyways during the week by taking her to doctor appointments, hospital operations and medical things. She also barely eats and looks like she's been in a concentration camp from the war; which isn't healthy. As of late she's been complaining that something is wrong with her but yet won't tell her doctor. So if she's still feeling bad by next Monday I'm going to call and make her another appointment myself<BR></lj-cut><BR>.<BR></FONT></P>
<P><FONT style=""BACKGROUND-COLOR: #c0c0c0""></FONT>&nbsp;</P>
<P><FONT style=""BACKGROUND-COLOR: #c0c0c0""><lj-cut text=""LJ Backgrounds""><BR>I bet this is a huge surprise. Doing my LJ background and things in...YYH style. So, yeah..Kurama/Youko and Kuronue no doubt will be plastered everywhere. I might make my own background and just use Kurama's picture for an icon..And than Kuronue's if I can find a good one..Than I merely have to find someone to turn them into icons' and help me set this things up. ::Horrible with things like this.::<BR></lj-cut><BR></FONT></P>
<P><FONT style=""BACKGROUND-COLOR: #c0c0c0""></FONT>&nbsp;</P>
<P><FONT style=""BACKGROUND-COLOR: #c0c0c0""><lj-cut text=""Money Issues""><BR>Money is apparently a really big issue here. To the point where my mom's told me that my paychecks from McDonald's will go to her and my old man to pay for bills. Dad never said anything to me about it but than again I don't trust some of things he says. I don't know what my folks finacial situation is so they might really be in that kind of problem. However, my entire paycheck is NOT going to them no matter how bad they're off. If mom wouldn't buy $100+ of things we don't even need we'd be good. She was trying to blame it on me by exclaiming my ""once in two weeks DVD"" is the cause of all the money issues. e-e She buys a DVD every two weeks or so...I clean her house, wash her clothes, wash her floors, vaccum, dust, sweep, wash the dogs, do the garbage, take the garbage cans in and out for the garbage men,clean her bathroom and keep out of her way..BUY HER CIGARETTES'...And it's MY fault? Oh,please. Whatever, bitch.<BR></lj-cut><BR></FONT></P>
<P><FONT style=""BACKGROUND-COLOR: #c0c0c0"">Oh and all journal entries will most likely stay public. If you don't like what I write, don't read it. n n I don't twist your arm to make you see what's going on in my life.</FONT></P>"

"event","<P>I think this is the last post that I have for the public to see. If you don't have a LJ and you are not on my list of friends, than you will not be given permission to see my entries. Mark, this does include you. If you want to know what's written, get a LJ and I'll put you in. Otherwise, you're out of luck.</P>
<P>As for the actual entry itself...</P>
<P>The cycle begins anew.</P>
<P>Lady, our oldest and more adored dog , is dead. And not just dead by old age or natural causes but by some fuck shit, dickless bastard who ran her over and left her in the road. Originally she was my dog, as were Daisy and Dojo, but they've been passed to my parents who wanted one of their own. Lady was my fathers', Daisy my mother's, and Dojo is my own.</P>
<P>But it doesn't stop the hurt of knowing a dog that you just yelled at the other day for living is now dead. I don't regret the things I've done, but I certainly didn't want her to die any painful or tramatic deaths. It's not fair that people, or animals, should die that way.</P>
<P>For the most part I'm numb, that usually happens when an event occurs. It's my natural way of dealing with a problem right now and not later freaking out. However, I'm going to need every litle thing I have simply because right now, dad's outside drinking wine. And he's crying. Just when I thought things were getting better and that our lives were going to change for good; something else happens.</P>
<P>Why are we living a life like this? Why can't we be the ones' who live sheltered lives and have no real concept of how cruel reality is? I'm tired of being jerked around on strings with my psychotic family for the amusment of some Fuck up there. And I'll tell you now, those of you who are religious. I do <STRONG><EM><U>not</U></EM></STRONG> care at the moment that I may have insulted your beliefs. Take it to someone who cares at the moment.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>But that's it really. Someone in our family died. Yes, an animal but a big part of our life nonetheless so you know what? If you think I'm making a big deal out of this: LIVE MY FUCKING LIFE THAN. You deal with a drunk father, blaming mother, and a psychotic family who's constantly fueding. See how far you get.</P>
<P>Oh and yes....after this post, all entries are for FRIENDS ONLY. </P>"

"event","<P>Omfg my stomach hurts like mad! And I feel queasy, which is not good since I have to take my grandmother up to a doctor's appointment Friday. Blerg. Anyways, lets see here...</P>
<P><U>Movies:</U></P>
<P>The Brothers Grim - Don't bother. It's not really worth spending five bucks on a ticket, and another ten on soda's and popcorn. I suppose it's 'cute' but that's really as far as I would go. Though the ending is rather different than most, I'd say.</P>
<P>The Cave - ::Snorts.:: ""Better than even the Alien series~"" BULLSHIT! I didn't jump even once , nor have the disgusting urge to coo at the monsters. They're like...gargolyes with bad attitudes.</P>
<P><U><STRONG>Projects:</STRONG></U></P>
<P>Kellu, Lix, Meg...I haven't started the necklaces YET. No excuses, I know, my apologies. Lack of creative thoughts happens to deter my will when it comes to things like that. However, Kellu..I DID finish the cross-stitch for you. You had best like that..since my fingers got super glued to that fuck.</P>
<P>Julie's afghan is coming along nicely. I should have it done in a couple weeks or a month or two if I really work at it. Though I'm dissappointed in the colors, I really am. It didn't come out at all like I had envisioned..I should have stuck with the solid purple. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Lets' see...If I'm not on as much, don't be surprised or worried. My grandmother (Nana) is getting to the point where she's going to need me to be there twenty four hours a day to supervise her. I already take her to her doctor's, pick up prescriptions, make SURE she's taking the right ones, and tend to her operations and medicine's then, as well. But now she's getting so that she's not eating properly. She eats cereal for dinner and expects to stay healthy on only that. </P>
<P>That's it really......I think I might lay down soon, as I'm really beginning to feel as if I'm going to vomit. I felt absolutely fine earlier, so I don't know what's wrong.</P>

But once you find out you can't get something, you give up and let go easily as well. <BR><BR>----------------------------------------<WBR>--------- *BLUE* You may have low self-esteem, and can be very picky. You are artistic and like to fall in love, but you let your love pass by, by loving with your mind, not your heart. <BR><BR>----------------------------------------<WBR>--------- *NAVY* You are attractive, and love your life. You have a strong feeling towards everything. And very easily distracted. Once you get angry at someone, its hard for you to forgive them. <BR><BR><STRONG><U>----------------------------------------<WBR>--------- *WHITE* You dream and have goals in your life. You get jealous easily and you don't react to things easily. You are different and sometimes weird, but everyone loves that in you. <BR></U></STRONG><BR>----------------------------------------<WBR>--------- *AQUA* Your feelings change suddenly and easily. You are always lonely, and like traveling. You are truthful, but listen and believe other people too easily. It's hard to find love for you, and get lost in love easily. Sometimes get hurt by love.</P>

<P><STRONG>This is actually NOT a rant; just some random information from school.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Alright, so I'm not going into college this August. Why, you ask? Because the Fincial Aid center never recieved ANY of my information and they just told me..yesterday. The actual money was due today, at 3pm, and I obviously do not have it. I tried for a Stafford Loan- but again, that failed. An attempt to raise my credit line was denied because I was 'maxed out' when I wasn't. It was fairly up there, but not really enough to decline my request. Hoo boy. </STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>So...</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>I get a job, refill out all this information, reregister with the school, and TRY to go in January. I'm not really mad since I DO need money! My checking account is like...$23 and that's really low. With a credit bill to pay, I reaaaalllyyyy need to get a job. But I found two adds in the newspaper today! One for a farmer, no experience necessary; and the other was a childcare worker....Hmmm...</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>I'll take the child care. I hate the heat more than I dislike childern. And I'm a good liar, unforatunately, so pretending to like snot-nose, little suck-up's won't kill me. Yet,anyways. If childern start dissappearing down here in Florida, IT WASN'T ME!<BR><BR>Good Notes:<BR>On a plus side, dad has nearly stopped drinking AND smoking! <BR><BR>Bad Notes:<BR>I can't stand my wretched mother! She's so.....'STFU'. If you get me. It's ironic that I go from being terrified of my old man (still am) and hating him...to getting along with him and hating my mother. Some reassurance that I'm doing okay in life isn't such a bad thing to want,right? &gt;( ee Ah,well, life's a bitch anyways.</STRONG></P>

<P>And a random scene from a possible story~ </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>~*~</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Night was rapidly falling over the sleepy town of Farens. The last dance of the sun was being smothered by its' much darker twin; the moon. And as each great ball struggled for its' dominace over the horizon the unsuspecting villagers looked on in silence. Colors of all different shades flashed one more time in a dying struggle before dissappearing all together beneath the inky black of nightfall. <BR><BR>&nbsp; ""Do you feel that,Ixchel?""<BR><BR>&nbsp; ""Aye, the time of the Slumber is over."" </P>
<P>&nbsp; ""Then the Great War shall begin anew; and this time there is no escaping the end."" <BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A hustle of the wind through the tree's stirred up a soft whistle of noise-cueing for all the other nocturnal creatures to begin their song. Slowly, without haste or worry , wildlife came to life to sing out its' rejoice of being alive. Nothing seemed able to break the peaceful humming of the crickets, or the cooing from sleeping birds nestled high atop their nests. Had Death curled its' icy fingers around the warmth of this night; it would have been sent screaming back to its' lair of silence. <BR><BR>""Come morning, Faren's will be no more."" <BR><BR>""It is sad to think that all the good in the world shall perish with the evil.""<BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two voices spoke softly into the night- their bodies camoflouged by the inky blackness swirling around them. Yet they spoke so softly as to not disturb the alluring and calming nightlife dancing around them. It was almost painful to them. Had light been sufficent, only the silhouette of two pairs of great wings would have been viewable. Ixchel and Abiel. Both good and evil , sane and insane , calm but angry ; only these two knew of the impending doom that was predestined for this planet. </P>
<P>In the end , Ixchel and Abiel were God and Lucifers' messengers...</P>
<P>...Messengers of Death.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>~*~..</P>
<P>Don't ask, I have no idea. Inspiration came from Angel Sanctuary. I'm trying to plot something out so that it's similar to their plot line, but not copied. I dislike copies.</P>"

Chrissy left about an hour and a half ago...I'm sulking like all Hell. Miss her already damnit. BUT...I had fun and it was GREAT to see her in person~ She's got a good hug,though. @-@ Girls got power in those arms. And she kissed me,too! I was surprised and more than a little pleased and giggly later. Now that I'm home, I'm wishing I had at least given her another hug or two. Being affectionate in reality is harder than online..but..

I
GOT
A
KISS!

EAT THAT YA'LL. XO Even if it was on the cheek, I STILL got one. >3; And she taught me how to play poker...I lost. I taught her Speed. She lost. XD She started teaching me Blackjack but I don't think that's a game I'd like much. Watched Gunslinger Girl, munched dinner and some sweets...

I was going to take her to the mall today but it turns out nothing was open until like 12 or so. Her folks wanted her back by 10:30 so we didn't get to do much. We did go out to breakfast~! And we made random dirty jokes...mostly about Gai and Lee. (Dun kill me Umeko-san~!) But all in all...I'm really to have seen her. Really happy. Now I'm sulking 'cause she's gone and everything. T-T; It's not fair."

<P><FONT color=#ff0000></FONT>&nbsp;</P>
<P><FONT color=#ff0000>Today, around 9am I had to be at the local community college to take the Arithmetic and Algebra part of the CPT (College Placement Test). So I go on in and tell'em I'm there, show them my ID and plunk my ass down at the computer desk. The lady, Terri, goes through the directions and everything's going just fine. I ignore the other people there who are taking miscellanious other tests so I can concentrate on mine. I'm doing Arithmetic, problem number 7. The answer's easy to find and I click ""Next"" after putting in my answer because you take the test on the computer. It's multiply choice, obviously. I wait....<BR><BR>Nothing happens.<BR><BR>I click ""Next"" again and this time a little window pops up that goes along the lines of ""Your answer has been sent in. Please wait for the next question to load."" I wait some more.<BR><BR>Nothing happens.<BR><BR>""Next"".</FONT></P>
<P><U>NO WEB PAGE TO BE DISPLAYED</U></P>
<P><FONT color=#ff0000>Say what?! The hell do you mean there isn't a page to be displayed?! So I'm a little annoyed that that happened and was all set to get the ladies to fix it. When I glance over and see seven other computer screens with the same exact page. <BR><BR>God. Damn. It.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ff0000>This is the third time I've been back to take the CPT test and I'm getting real sick of going. Before I was there four times taking something called the T.A.B.E test. Anyways, Terri calls up the management place that basically keeps all the computers in check. They tell her to wait while they call Bell South, the company in which they use. The CPT test is taken online and obviously you can't run the internet without your provider. I wait...<BR><BR>One hour later:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ff0000>Terri finally calls back and asks if anything new has come up. Turns out, the Bell South men were there while we were taking the test doing whatever it is the fuck that they do.</FONT> <FONT color=#ff0000>Now, I did construction and I know the basic's of working in it. I wasn't great at it. Not even handy. Terri gathers me and the other CPT and internet test students around and tells us that ....</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ff0000>""Bell South cut their own line so the test won't be back until 5 or 6 tonight! :D Would you like to reschedule tomorrow? There are other tests going on and we're booked solid so you'll have to wait until the other students are done.Or we can give the test on paper, which will take twice as long to do as the online version.""</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ff0000>I made myself proud today by very politely saying I'd CALL tomorrow and ask if there were available seats. If not, kiss my ass I'll see you idiots next week. On the way out I noticed the Bell South crew in a five foot hole with machinary around them. I was mad. There's a Bell South Moron walking across the road. I hit the gas and swerve slightly.

<P><FONT color=#ff0000>Yeah...I guess I'll post the shit I've been keeping secret. But first...</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ff0000><U><STRONG>Today's Event:</STRONG></U></FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ff0000>Dad's never physically touched me in my entire life..not that I can remember. Or , at least , not in a way that could be considered abusive. I've always been afraid of him, because I know he could break my neck easily with his two bare hands. And he could do it drunk but not sober. Or so I thought...</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ff0000>So..what's my problem? </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ff0000>..He hit me. His first real blow ever. What you consider a blow and what I consider a blow might be two different things. But I considered throwing a basket in my face, point blank with a sharp piece of plastic sticking out aimed at my eyes at blow. He was close enough to have it considered as 'he picked it up and hit me with it'. Toss or hit...it's still what it is. He meant to do it, and then only a second after he said he should have used his fist and if I EVER spoke to him again while he was speaking, he'd use it. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ff0000>So he went into his usual lecture on how I'm a lazy, no-good whore who's using him for his money. I'll admit that I haven't been persuing a job or college that I should have. Been then again, lately the only thing I've ever felt like is a failure. Makes it hard to get up and motive yourself when you've heard nothing but how much of a failure you are and will be. It's not his fault entirely, I shouldn't listen but he IS my father. Then he went into how&nbsp;I was lying to him about the college tests and information. He said he looked it all up but I don't think he did..or the information he got was different than what I got. Either way, either he's lying or the person he spoke to at the college doesn't know shit. Ensure a half hour round of ""You're nothing and you'll never amount to anyone you lazy fuck."" and that's followed by how I never have the house work done. Hm..I wonder where he gets that if the dishs, sweeping, dusting, changing the cat litter box, vaccuming, washing, drying and fold the laundry, plus tidying the house is done BEFORE HE COMES HOME. He said I don't get up until 3 or 4pm in the afternoon and then do the chores....</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ff0000>Fucker, you get home around 3pm, fuckshit! Whatever...you get the general idea. After he left I called mom, and yes, I cried...Never thought I'd be so scared or shocked before. I told her that on the day's she's working...and he's not home by 4 or 4:30...I WAS going to the hospital to wait for her. I won't be home with him alone when he's drunk anymore...But what really gets me..is she says he works north of his original construction site...So the bar is WAY out of his normal route. So the chances are he was just as sober as he was drunk....My father hit me sober......My father hit me drunk....I don't know what's worse.Bleh.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ff0000><STRONG><U>Past Events:</U></STRONG></FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ff0000>So...Only Veronica and Chrissy know..and now Meg because I've told her today. But my cousins, Kelly and James, (yes the two trouble makers with the three kids) both have diseases...Kelly with AIDs,supposedly, and James with Prostate Cancer. I've known for a while...couple months or so. Now you know.&nbsp; Oh and the guy Kelly supposedly got the AIDS from, Chris...who tried to strangle her in front of her childern...Well..She took him back. So they're all living together. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ff0000><STRONG><U>Current:</U></STRONG> </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ff0000>Thinking about moving out and living with Kelly....Dunno if Chris really did try to kill Kelly or not so I'm wary about going. I could live with my grandmother right behind us..but if I move, it's to be away from my father. There's not point in moving twenty feet behind my house if dad will just walk over, get me and bitch anyways. Mom promised me if dad ever hurt me, we'd leave...She won't. I always knew she wouldn't..she'd let me go out on my own, with nothing and no experience, rather than leave him. I feel let down...So tomorrow I go job hunting. No job = getting kicked out of house by dad. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ff0000><STRONG><U>Thoughts:</U></STRONG></FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ff0000>I realized why I'm online so much..why I'm so hellbent on helping everyone...I'm afraid of reality. I don't want to grow up and have a job, get my own house and pay bills. I don't want to deal with the assholes and nice people in the world. I want to be alone. Being online and trying to make myself apart of people's lives who are so far away I couldn't even call often is my escape. My escape from life. It's why I've been so clingy lately. I know I'm going to have to grow up. I hate it. I almost wished, when I tried suicide so many years ago on pills, that I had succeeded. Now, don't get me wrong, I'm NOT suicidal. The thoughts not even half-baked. It's just I thought I was so prepared.....when I'm not. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ff0000></FONT>&nbsp;</P>
<P><FONT color=#ff0000>Mark, Meg, Drew....Kirei...Whoever else I said I'd help..</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ff0000>Your projects are now you're own. I can't help you with those. Emotional and life problems bring to me, I'll be happy to help you then. But stories, drawings, etc have to go. I have to focus on me now and getting money. I have to focus on me now and that might be selfish. I know I'm breaking some promises to a few of you...but I intend to keep one.....just one....</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ff0000></FONT>&nbsp;</P>
<P><FONT color=#ff0000><U>I'm not giving up.</U> </FONT></P>"

Ming, 24, British. Currently I am on an extended jaunt around the world, working and experiencing as much as possible before I head back home to work towards what I want to do with my life. If you ask whether I'm 'finding myself', I <i>will</i> roll my eyes at you. On this journal: overanalysis of TV and sometimes films, emotional reactions about <i>Doctor Who</i>, <i>Downton Abbey</i>, other TV and culture, music and book recs, travel talk, politics, media discussion, some personal rambling.

Occasionally fandom things like reactions, picspam or meta will be unlocked. Comment to be added - if we have interests in common and you seem to be cool, I will add you back."

"event","Life update later, but for now, I saw this article a few days ago:

<a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/jan/11/british-chinese-racism"">Chinese Britons have put up with racism for too long</a>

It was up on ontd_political too, but by the time I read it discussion had died off, boo. It really hit a nerve with me, so I'm just going to repost my comment from ontd_p and then leave comments open for debate - I'd really like any Asians to talk about their experiences in an English-speaking country in comparison to this (or if you're a fellow UK Asian, what you think).

<i><u>Many Chinese viewers were outraged at the portrayal of east Asians in this show, but typically, few complained.

Sadly, the British Chinese are reticent about speaking up for themselves</u>

The cultural attitude of 'just get on with it and don't complain, you go and prove them wrong by having an amazing career!' probably doesn't help. I've only ever been directly racially abused once - I was 11, waiting outside my new grammar school for Mum to pick me up, some ignorant teenage fuckers raced past in a car and yelled ""Chinese scum!"" My first thought was ""I don't know them, so they must be angry at someone else"", so I looked up and down the street to see who it was. No-one else Chinese or even Asian in sight. I never told my family about it.

All my life me and my siblings have had it drummed into us by our parents (and especially by my dad) that the only person who has any effect on what we can make of our life is ourselves. ""WORK HARD AND YOU WILL GO FAR!"" That's the mantra. When my dad started teaching martial arts in Dagenham back in the 70s, he had a lot of black students, and he brought them up in relation to a massive argument about 'positive discrimination' that we had a while ago. He told me that his black students nearly always complained when they couldn't find a job that 'it's because I'm black'. My dad's response was that they shouldn't complain because if they just worked harder and ignored it, they would get past the problem. His exact words? ""They should stop using their colour as an excuse.""

In case you're wondering, my parents vote Tory. My dad says that all his Chinese friends also vote Tory, 'because we Chinese believe in working hard, and that if we work hard, we will be rewarded for it.'

This is a huge problem - my parents just don't get that there are underlying social problems and inbuilt prejudices that affect people's judgement, and I reckon it's the same for much of the Chinese/Asian community. It makes me want to bang their heads against a wall, because how can they truly believe that individuals are the only people who have an effect on their own lives? No-one lives in a fucking vacuum.</i>

ETA: I hate my assumption that my dad and his friends represent the opinions of their generation in the UK, but - ack IDK if it's just his 'BOOTSTRAPS!'individualistic viewpoint or really a part of the culture. Probably a bit of both. This post is so inarticulate, argh. 

Also, dear god Elizabeth Chan's anecdote about her friend's parents complimenting her on her English accent is hilariously like my experience in Australia last year - I was volunteering with Conservation Australia near Uluru, and was chatting with some friends when this old white Aussie guy on holiday came up to me and asked, ""Where did you learn English?"" ""Oh, I was born in the UK."" ""Ah, I thought so, your accent is very good!"" ""...um, thanks?"" 

I'm really damn annoyed by the majority of comments on The Guardian article too, talk about missing the fucking point, you MORONS.

<lj user=""tangledtale""> and I were talking about representation (or lack thereof) in the media in the <a href=""http://ljrevival.livejournal.com/1087.html?thread=17983#t17983"">LJ Revival friending meme</a> a few days ago too, so any thoughts on that would be great as well. I JUST REALLY WANT TO TALK ABOUT THIS EVERYONE, PLEASE CROSSPOST IF YOU CAN."

Happy New Year everyone, I hope you had a good 2011! Gotta go clean the kitchen in a minute, so my introspective end-of-year-review-looking-ahead-to-2012 post will have to wait (also I need sleep oh dear god HELP ME), but briefly, my night involved a lot of walking around, losing people, minor friendship drama, and other people getting covered in paint and doing somersaults at 6am into a water fountain in a public park.

Hope your nights were less eventful, haha."

"event","It's gone past Boxing Day in New Zealand, but Merry Christmas anyway everyone, I hope you had a lovely day!

The past three days have been delightfully void of cleaning work - the hostel manager temporarily downsizes the amount of cleaning during Christmas and New Year, and gave us a choice of either having Christmas Eve/Christmas/Boxing Day off, or New Year's Eve/New Year's Day/Jan 2nd off. CHRISTMAS PLEASE, I said, and bearing in mind the warning that the morning shift for corridors and stairways on New Year's Day was the worst, I went for morning shift in the kitchen instead. CONGRATULATIONS whoever got the corridors and stairways! Wear a medical mask or something because the amount of after-party sick you will be mopping up <i>will</i> be astronomical :/

I've been pestering the hostel about getting a proper Christmas event done for the past week, and after a lot of talking, we had everyone who was interested pay us $15 so we could buy everything. The rough count was about 30 people. Yikes. On Christmas Eve morning I roped a few of the lads into coming with me and a friend to the closest supermarket.

""...yeah, we're going in about 10 min - Tom, are you... you're bringing your big backpack?""

""Yes. I thought it'd be useful.""

Once we'd bought everything, he packed all 6 chickens into the pack, plus 4 packs of bacon and 2 packs of sausages.

""...will that hold it all?""

""Yeah, I've carried more than 20KG in this before.""

What a hero. Later on, he went back to the supermarket and put a crate of cider into his pack for himself, hahaha.

Ughhh, two days of cooking. TWO DAYS. Don't get me wrong, I loved it - the recipe hunting (ILU Guardian!), grabbing friends to do chopping up, tasting - but by the end of it me and Neil were worn out and tempers were thin. We got back from the supermarket on Christmas Eve and did 6 hours of prep, went to a friend's Christmas Eve party, then got up at 6:30am Christmas Day and finished at 2pm. Admittedly we spent at least two hours waiting around for the chickens to cook (which I spent listening to A Festival Of Nine Lessons And Carols, thank god iPlayer works worldwide for BBC radio at least), but <i>bloody hell</i>. I hardly, if ever, drink, but I cracked open a can of g & t with my lunch and sighed with relief, lollll. No desserts, because what with the main meal, like fuck did we have the time, but an Italian friend made tiramisu. Nom nom nom. We both got a round of applause and everyone said the food was great, hurrah! Yes, yes it <i>was</i>. The tables were all set out with hats and napkins and Corona beers and limes (lol the priorities of a backpacker Christmas), and we were packed together <i>extremely</i> tightly. ""Christmas! Unexpected intimacy with people you hardly know.""

6 roast chickens, basted with herb butter and wrapped in bacon; roast potatoes; sweet potato mash; broccoli (with bacon and without); caulflower cheese (w bacon and w/out); roast carrots and parsnips glazed with honey; meatballs; gravy; bread sauce. Damn, I am not catering for 30 people again in a hurry.

Later on, I fell asleep on a couch with my laptop playing <a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b018fv67/Stopping_by_Woods/"">Stopping By Woods</a> in my ears, then woke up an hour later to find that not only were half the hostel still creatively swearing at the telly because of Mario Kart (""Oh cunting hell! You're getting some ink for that!""), but the manager was bringing out a smaller TV screen so he could bring out his PS3 and play FIFA on it. ""It's getting nerdy today!"" 

Not much else happened - chatted with a few friends, watched some Downton (it's like the Final Destination of period telly - you know the car crash is coming but you can do nothing but walk towards it anyway), rang home for an hour. No presents, but few of us expected any, and really, it was a lovely day as it was.

Today I woke up in the afternoon, went to see if the 160GB iPod Classic had any discounts for Boxing Day (no, and Apple might be phasing out the Classic next year DDD:), read some more of <a href=""http://www.penguin.com.au/products/9780141037288/crimes-against-humanity-popular-penguins"">Crimes Against Humanity</a>, listened to my friend Mark's frustration with his boredom with Auckland now he's not working plus his ongoing pursuit of his cute German workmate, watched <i>Tintin</i> (really enjoyed it), and finally watched the Doctor Who Christmas special!

<lj-cut text=""The Doctor, The Widow And The Wardrobe"">

OMGGGG, that was the best Who Christmas episode <i>ever</i>, I want to wrap it up in cotton wool and clutch it to my heart!

+ ""I'm older than I look, and I don't feel the way you do, not anymore."" OH ELEVEN, LET ME LOVE YOOOOUUU &hearts; I cannot say it enough, but I fucking love the understated way Moffat and Matt Smith deal with the Doctor's emotions - he is so old and broken, but now it's not shamelessly shoved in our faces any more in an attempt to make us cry for the Doctor's manpain. GOD, GIVE IT A REST RTD BEFORE TORCHWOOD DROWNS IN ITS OWN TEARS. Moff and Matt acknowledge the Doctor's pain, they let it slip through the cracks every now and then, but it's not dwelt on, and thank god for that.

+ LEMONADE TAPS, THE MAGNA CARTA AND HAMMOCKS. ""I <i>know</i>.""

+ Wee!children were adorable and plucky and getting-into-trouble-inquisitive.

+ ""What <i>do</i> they teach you in school these days?"" *glee*

+ ""There's never any danger here!"" <b>*BOOOOOM*</b> ""...there are sentences I should just keep away from."" HAHAHAHA!

+ CLAIRE SKINNER I LOVE YOU AND YOUR FACE AND YOUR ACTING SKILLS AND I FUCKING LOVE MADGE ARWELL! Can we talk about how, after a series that was heavy on dads and the mess of the Melody storyline, we got a narrative that was all about a mum who was funny and practical and odd and very very kickarse tough? 

+ Environmentalism! Bill Bailey talking about the forest being a fuel source plus 'the rain that burns' plus the trees sending out their 'souls' to escape destruction! ""One can't possibly imagine being a forest, then suddenly one can! How remarkable."" ILU MOFFAT.

+ Feminism! ""Weak and strong, it's a translation! Translated into the base code of nature! You and I Cyril, we're weak! But she's female! More than female, she's mum! How else does life ever travel - the mothership!"" I REALLY LOVE YOU MOFFAT. (Stop screwing up your female narrative arcs in the main series and hire some female writers/directors, then we'll be absolutely all gravy, cheers!)

+ BILL BAILEY AND ARABELLA WEIR AND ARMSTRONG! &hearts;

+ Oh my fucking god, POOOOONNNDDSS. L O bloody L, Amy wielding a water pistol at carol singers, this is a visual I will treasure forever. ALSO KAREN GILLAN's FACE, jesus, how does that girl get prettier every time she's on telly? And aaaaah Arthur's grown his hair! I am seriously in love with the swept-over fringe trend that seems to be in vogue this year - see also Harry Lloyd and Dan Stevens. Everyone is still fantastically hot, well done hipster TARDIS team! I really really want the Christmas jumper Karen was wearing in this episode. Completely ignoring Moff saying the Ponds are leaving 'heartbreakingly' la la la la la can't hear yoooou! Ughhh, they set a place for him at their Christmas table and Amy's so so so proud of River and Rory's so bloke-ishly pleased the Doctor's turned up and HIS SURPRISE AT HAVING A FAMILY AND HIS TEARS HIS TEARS, OH MY GOD MATT SMITH HAS A FACE ALL THE ACTING AWARDS FOR HIM THANK YOU THERE IS NO-ONE ELSE.

Oh lol, going to bed now. Tomorrow I'm going to finish writing my cover letter and send it off to a friend who works in HR to look over, then I'm going to watch the rest of Downton S2, download the Christmas Special and watch that, read some more and maybe listen to the epic BBC Radio 4 adaptation of Vasily Grossman's <i>Life And Fate</i> that they broadcast way back in September. Russia and WWII and Kenneth Branagh and David Tennant!"

"event","S'up guys, how are you all? It was my birthday today - went down to Mission Bay with some friends and had a barbecue. Despite some ominous looking clouds, the rain held off and the only annoyances were the wind (""I do love a bit of grass with my cake"", Kyle smirked), and some <i>massive</i> seagulls hovering around. Seriously, the seagulls downunder are huge. Sam got so frustrated he tried to take them out by chucking his rugby ball at them when they came near, shouting ""Come at me bro!!!"" HILARITY ALL ROUND.

I'm not really bothered by birthdays now, they're more of an excuse to have food with friends, but it was really cool and relaxed. I got a bit anxious because the work crew were really lively as usual but people from my hostel were a bit quiet, and I hate it when there's a feeling of clique-y-ness, but in the end I think everyone enjoyed it. The best thing was the amazing cake the work crew got me - <i>black forest gateau</i>, let me die, ugh, love you Laura, your food choices are brilliant! 

24 years old. 24 with a degree, a CV full of customer service experience and a bank account that's not filling up as quickly as I'd like to, 24 and not planning to come home to start a proper job for a few more years, 24 and doing exactly what I want to do, right now. The only thing is, of course, not having family and friends from home with me, but otherwise this is pretty much the happiest I've been for a while. Now, if I can submit that application for that teaching assistant job in Beijing and get a reply saying yes, that would make my life perfect for ages.

It's almost Christmas! How is it almost the end of the year?!? It still feels weird walking out after work, observing that the evenings are getting darker later and saying, ""Summer's coming,"" when it's December.

HOWEVER, Christmas always means extra love all round, so let's be sappy and say stuff that we never usually say about how we appreciate each other!

MY SOUL

EVERYONE

<lj-cut text=""I should just preface every post about Downton with the words above"">

Right, quick qualifier: this series has so far been a dip in quality compared to the last one, which is attributable to a number of things like second-album-syndrome, a temptation to give in to audience wishes (Anna/Bates brief whirlwind in the first episode, FALSE HOPE JULIAN) and a little too much cramming together of issues like differing war narratives (I'm not saying it shouldn't be there, but it would be nice if Julian spaced it all out more to give them room to breathe).

The important thing is still there though, which Julian does so well: the depth and development of each character, and the way they all relate to each other. You wonder why it's so popular and emotionally involving? That'd be why. That is why I am sitting in an internet cafe having spent an hour swearing at the computer when it aborted the first download, and then got a coffee and Twix and tweaked my LJ layout and sticky post (<lj user=""excitedrainbow"">, check it out!) to while away the time until I was able to watch the second episode.

LANG! Oh goddd, shellshocked soldiers - this + the gas-blinded dude + William's naive little proud face + memories of English Literature A-Level reading about WW1 = Ming crying. There is something about the First World War in particular that has always made it resonate with people; partly it's the enormous waste of life, partly it's the grinding nature of the war and newness in its horror at the time, partly the sheer pointlessness of it all. Every war narrative in this show reflects a different aspect, and though it feels a bit stretched, all of them are sketched out beautifully. LANG'S BARELY CONCEALED BITTERNESS AND RESIGNED AIR WHEN TALKING TO WILLIAM. THE BLIND DUDE'S LACK OF HOPE. THOMAS CRYING! 

This is it, this is the start of 30 years of a whole continent <i>constantly</i> thinking about war, about how they might avoid it, about how to cope with it, about whether they'll ever see it again or see the <i>end of it</i> - this show is telling us how war creeps into every aspect of <i>everyone's</i> life and leaves no-one unscathed.

Mattheeeeeew, you suave thin-faced PTSD affected maaaan, just survive and find a way to let Lavinia go without hurting her and go find comfort in Mary's arms like the universe wants you to!!! COUSINS IN LOVE, YOU ARE BREAKING YOUR OWN HEARTS!

Speaking of which, Mary Mary please tell Sir Richard to fuck off, as much as I love Iain Glen and Richard's confidence about him and Mary being good together (hello people who know that they're better than everyone else!). Oh my god I love her so much - going to see Carson! And she was genuinely concerned for Lavinia and didn't tell Matthew she loved him partly because she didn't want to hurt her! 

ALSO HER RELATIONSHIP WITH ANNA, I LOVE IT. There's always a certain social propriety to their interactions, but Mary can let go in front of Anna, and they both confide in each other. FUCK, MY HEART. THIS GIRL. To quote <lj user=""marketchippie"">, Michelle Dockery has a face, and <i>how</i>.

Jesus I think it's official, I am in love with both Anna and Sybil and Branson. I mean, I love everyone, but they are the types of people I fall for easiest. Good people, not pushovers, steadfast, quietly witty, idealists with energy enough to burn the ills of the world away if it were possible to do so. JOANNE FROGATT WHAT IS YOUR FACE, HOW IS IT SO DELIGHTFUL AND HEARTBREAKING. The way Branson looked at Sybil in the hospital! Allen Leech I am eternally slain by your Irish chaaaarrrm. Forever swooning over Sybil bursting in to tell Clarkson what she thought and ""After this I think they can be made to."" JESSICA YOU ARE TOO LOVELY I CANNOT STAND IT.

FUCK, EDITH'S DEVELOPMENT! ""I will do it!"" Mary's little smile after Edith said that! SISTERS CRAWLEY I LOVE YOOOUUUU. I love it I love it, she's found herself a role outside of what society usually allows her - she's good at farming, she loves it, she can drive! Not even going to attempt to see what fandom's reaction is; I think part of why she kissed Farmer Drake was the delight she felt at what she'd discovered about herself - he wanted her and appreciated her, and that fed into her newfound enjoyment and sense of purpose. Plus, she has always wanted attention and approval because compared to Mary and Sybil she was deprived of it at home. ""Farming needs a kind of toughness, doesn't it? There's room for sentiment, but not sentimentality."" MY HEART, LAURA CARMICHAEL YOUR SWEET LITTLE FACE HAS IT.</lj-cut>

Let us end the emotional armageddon with a soul-soothing quotation from Lady Violet! I think I shall end all Downton posts this way.

"event","Ok, I have a job for the next week teaching English, but gorging on Tumblr posts about both <i>Downton</i> and <i>Doctor Who</i> have given me major emotions that I need to get rid of or I will not be able to concentrate.

<lj-cut text=""Cut for a massive essay, SORRY BUT NOT REALLY"">

First of all, I know quite a few people don't like Rory, which I don't understand but you know, let's agree to disagree, I don't have the time for DW fandom arguments (side-eyeing YOU, Rose fanatics). But then I read someone's argument that part of the reason they don't want Rory around on the show is because of his relationship to Amy; that how they both have been written and the storylines they've been given have diminished her agency and development as a character.

Let's separate this into 2 issues: the storylines' effect on Amy, and Rory's effect on Amy.

The basic complaint I've seen about this series and Amy is this: that the kidnapping + forced childbirth plot meant that Moffat had taken away Amy's agency, that it was the standard misogynistic sci-fi magical pregnancy plot whereby the woman is only being used as a vessel for a higher power or in order for the important child to be born. I do have objections to this usually, but she was pregnant normally and not as part of some greater plan (even if it was TARDIS influenced); the villains saw this as an opportunity and then kidnapped her. It was all clearly presented as wrong and an obvious act of violence against Amy - and she's not important only because she's River's mother, Amy's always been so much more than that, she's always been important just for being herself. As for the agency thing: the doctor said it himself, her heart and soul were with them - she made all those decisions about pirate swashbuckling and running around the TARDIS herself, just as she's always done. 

This argument about agency simply ties into a larger theme anyway: that the Doctor gets too involved with the lives of those who travel with him; he affects huge parts of their lives and occasionally ruins them. No-one is ever completely free of influences that inform their decisions and no-one acts in a vacuum - sometimes the circumstances of your life will take you somewhere you weren't planning on going to. The whole point of Amy's and Rory's life being so bonkers when they hadn't meant it to be like this is just like that of other companions; when you choose to travel with the doctor and continue to do it for a long time (getting married!) there will be consequences simply because life on the TARDIS with him is unpredictable. I'm not saying it's their fault, but the doctor is a magnet for uncontrollable forces and situations, so it's inevitable that their agency will be diminished even more. Life with the doctor is a massive magnification of ordinary life not going the way you intended it to.

Do I wish Moff had chosen not to go with the kidnapping surprise birth plot? Yes, because we do get enough of that already (just let them have the child normally and then have it kidnapped, why not?). As it is though, I don't see it as the incredible degrading anti-feminist plot everyone thinks it is.

Briefly, the 'Rory diminishes Amy' argument. WHAT THE EVER LOVING HELL ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? This would be right if they constantly showed Amy as relying on him, or thinking that she couldn't be anything/exist without him (hi <i>Twilight</i>, go burn to ashes please), or if their relationship made her character or narrative arc go backwards. If you can give me examples I want to have a discussion about it, but I have not seen that happening. She still has that sense of adventure and wonder and curiosity, she still disobeys the Doctor and does what she wants, and Rory doesn't stop her or tries to. He says they have to grow up sometime, but he never says 'you cannot do this'. He is her constant when the Doctor is the variable; she knows he will be there when the Doctor leaves, and it was the case even when they were just teenagers and friends. She runs away from that because she was frightened of growing up, settling down and not becoming something extraordinary and fulfilling her potential (as do all companions, isn't that why DW is so magical?), but she's realised that growing up doesn't necessitate being boring, and neither does stability. Ordinary life doesn't make people any less amazing simply because they don't save the universe everyday (I loved Rory's comment in <i>The God Complex</i>, it's so him), and the Doctor knows this. The way Amy's developed over the past two series means that she knows this too, and it's only the circumstances surrounding Melody in addition to her appetite for new sights and adventures that's kept her going. Now she knows doing this hurts the Doctor, she's willing to let go; she does not have a freaking-out aversion to everyday life.

Also there was an implication that Rory acts like a dick most of the time, which, WRONG. Not to say that he's perfect, but honestly the majority of the time he is one of the nicest companions there have ever been on Who. WHAT CHARACTER ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT HATERS?! Truly, I would like examples of when he's an idiot and why you don't like him, because I do not see this. He is the lone voice of sanity on the TARDIS, the one who sees the joys and victories in the everyday as well as the universal, solid and steadfast and quietly concerned, funny and intelligent. He's fearful and insecure, and if something threatens things he loves he lashes out, but he's never spiteful, he never hurts people on purpose. He doesn't restrain Amy because, well, who could? But also he just wants her to be happy, and travelling around with the Doctor makes her happy, so he goes along with it.

Alright, that's my rant over. COME AT ME WITH DISCUSSION PEOPLE, I AM READY.</lj-cut>

OK, DOWNTON FEELINGS, AND BY THAT I MEAN SHALLOWNESS:

<lj-cut text=""PICSPAM OF EMOTIONS"">

Sybil is so beautiful I can't stand it; also I am praying that Branson doesn't die either in the war or the Irish uprisings, augggghh please say they're not doomed! BET ON HIM GIRL.

Oh my godddddd, her mouth is seriously the most perfect one I've ever seen, and his stupid earnest Irish eyeessss, I HATE YOU BOTH FOR MAKING ME FEEL THINGS. Gotta echo <lj user=""welurklate"">, I just want them to live in London as sassy bohemian progressives scandalising her family.

If I had Tumblr (not ever because it is a timesucker already, so never never never) my tags would basically be #keysmash of LUST, #oh my godddd and #being silent because I'm CHEWING MY ARM OFF. All I need now is Allen Leech to get in a toga again.

And yet I still think he looks hotter when spattered with mud in the trenches. Matthew COME BACK SAFE <strike> SO YOU AND MARY CAN MAKE UP AND BANG AND MARRY AND BICKER</strike>

Speaking of which, I am <i>dying</i>, just, augh, they are still so in love and Michelle is a goddess; all that calculated show of happiness is such a defence against completely breaking down because she has to <i>carry on</i>, she wants him to be safe and happy and meanwhile for him Downton is a haven of normality, Lavinia is a lovely girl, but he can SEE that still Mary isn't as cold or calm or content as she would have everyone believe. THEY ARE JUST PERFECT FOR EACH OTHER AND JULIAN IS GOING TO TORTURE US FOR THE REST OF THE SERIES, ISN'T HE?

Look at her face! No way is she actually plain - it's always that she is not her father's or mother's favourite and Mary and Sybil both have overwhelming, easy-to-notice personalities, so she just gets lost in this household. REMEMBER WHEN SHE COULDN'T BELIEVE SHE MIGHT BE GETTING MARRIED AND SHE HAD DISBELIEVING DIMPLES TO GO WITH HER SMILE?


Anyway, these girls are what I love most (tho' Anna is my homegirl too):

<center><img src=""http://28.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lr2l58TZXB1qapp55o1_500.png"" alt=""sisters"" /></center>

As someone said, Mary looking out, Edith looking in, Sybil looking up. PERFECTION. Let's just repeat what I said to <lj user=""welurklate"">: <i>I just love the Crawley sisters as a unit, and their different personalities just mirror their ages and expectations and outlooks on life. Mary's the beautiful eldest one with all the expectation of making a good marriage, but she doesn't really give a damn, whereas Edith really fucking does because she NEEDS TO GET OUT OF THE HOUSE and wants some approval/attention, and Sybil's the baby so obviously she gets away with anything and is rebellious/idealistic. 

I think the best summary of them is that Sybil forgets her place in society, Mary wants to forget, Edith will never let herself forget. (Love you <lj user=""anythingbutgrey"">, your Downton fic was stunning).IDK SISTERS CRAWLEY STAN HERE, I love how they relate to each other and interact, so naturally I am excited for seeing Edith progress as a character. Social and gender boundaries starting to break down during this series, and I am so on tenterhooks seeing them all react to that.</i>

God, the only thing on this show that gives me joy without pain is Lady Violet - Maggie Smith is fantastic, and every line Julian gives her I am sobbing with laughter:

POOR LAVINIA.
</lj-cut>

BEDTIME NOW, maybe I can get to the weekend without thinking about either of these two TV life ruiners. <small>whatever, probably not but i will try my hardest!</small>

ETA: Guys, when I said I wanted discussion, I didn't want patronising attitudes towards other people's opinions. PLEASE BE POLITE. I have extra work over the next few days so thinking about what you've all said and responding to it all will be put off, but I haven't forgotten and I will be back, if you still feel like debating everything. Some interesting stuff being said, cheers everyone."

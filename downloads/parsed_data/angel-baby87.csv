Against All Odds

How can I just let you walk away? 
Just let you leave without a trace? 
When I stand here taking every breath with you, ohoo 
You're the only one who really knew me at all 
How can you just walk away from me? 
When all I can do is watch you leave? 
Cuz we shared the laughter and the pain 
and even shared the tears 
You're the only one who really knew me at all 

Chorus: 
So take a look at me now 
Cause there's just an empty space 
And there's nothin left here to remind me 
Just the memory of your face 
Take a look at me now 
Cuz there's just an empty space 
And you comin back to me is against the odds 
and that's what I've gotta face. 

I wish I could just make you turn around 
Turn around and see me cry 
There's so much I need to say to you, 
So many reasons why 
You're the only one who really knew me at all 

Chorus 
So take a look at me now 
cuz there's just an empty space 
And there's nothin left here to remind me 
just the memory of your face 
Take a look at me now 
Cus there's just an empty space 
But to wait for you, is all I can do 
and that's what I gotta face 

Take a good look at me now 
I'll still be standing there 
And you comming back to me is against all odds 
It's the chance i gotta take 
Just take a look at me now




Georgia

Georgia, Georgia, the whole day through 
Just an old sweet song 
Keeps Georgia on my mind 
Talkin' 'bout Georgia 
I'm in Georgia 
A song of you 
Comes as sweet and clear as moonlight through the pines 
Other arms reach out to me 
Other eyes smile tenderly 
Still in peaceful dreams I see 
The road leads back to you 
Georgia, sweet Georgia, no peace I find 
Just an old sweet song 
Keeps Georgia on my mind 
Other arms reach out to me 
Other eyes smile tenderly 
Still in peaceful dreams I see 
The road leads back 
It always leads back to you 
I'm in Georgia, Georgia, sweet Georgia 
No peace, no peace I find 
Just this old, sweet song 
Keeps Georgia forever on my mind 
Just an old sweet, sweet song 
Keeps Georgia forever on my mind"

Believe me it works, i know because I did it!! And my life has drastically changed...

Just incase ya'll were wondering on how I found this, I was invited by my great friend crazyhart. Well, besides the fact that i'm tired b/c i didn't get home until about 7:45 (almost 12 hours after i left the house) basicly i was showing ppl around the NEX, and spending money, which I am tight on at the moment. Well, more later, I'm gonna sleep, good night!!"

"event","wow i haven't written in this for soo long.

alot alot has changed since i've written last. basically my whole life.

everyday since he's been gone is completly diffrent. tom went from being someone whos in my life, to someone who my whole family needs in there life. a lot of ppl have been like oh i can't beleive how good your doing blah blah, well besides the point that i never show how i feel, its bc of him and my friends. tom comes over every single day just to help out around the house, or be with me to get my mind off stuff.

i haven't been really in the mood of going out lately. (to some ppl they think this is bc of me being ""obsessed"" w/ tom) which is selfish. but i really haven't, every single time ive gone out, ive wanted to come back home. i was never like this. i always wanted to be out and away from my mom and sister as much as i could. home is like my comfort zone and everything seems normal here. i hate specail attention. alot of ppl breathe off it, but i hate it. don't get me wrong i appreciate everyone being there for me, but i don't want anyone acting diffrent around me just because im going through something right now. when i go to parties and shit everyones like aww omg i feel so bad for you blah blah. personally i wouldnt like to hear that bc after that its all i think about.

julie has been doing so much for me its crazy.
a lot of you know that im going on spring break with her jess alana n jenn. well julie thought that one up, and i seriously can't wait. plus julie knows exactly what im going through because she had 2 go through the same thing. i just wish ALL MY FRIENDS understood like she does.

speaking of spring break my mom gave me money to go get my tanning month which i seriously need 2 start today. and then im going shopping. i lloooove summer shopping. and exspecailly on spring break i can by anything cute that i want. im like looking forward to waking up every single morning, sippin on some kinda mix drink debbie will have for us, layin out on the beach all morning then going to get ready to go out at night. i just know that its gunna be crazy. IM GOING WITH DEBBIE AS MY PARENT FOR GOD SAKE. not to mention me jessica jenn and alana all together, more then likely under the influence, on panama city beach with thousands of other fucked up ppl just like us.

im so pathetic my mom gave me money to go shopping. i went to the mall yesturday for 3 hrs, and didn't get one thing. so im going back 2 day by myself so i can get something done with my life. hehe. jennifers getting a membership @ my gym so that will be nice to actually have someone to go with because julie n trace hardley ever go.

well imgunna go. long entry.. <3"

"event","well everyone knows now about my dad..
  i really can't make an entry about this one because i honestly don't know how to put it into words. he was such a big part of me, and ment so much. everyone knows how close we were, and the hardest part to know is that i lost another best friend. he was my life, and so much of my inspiration. truely one of the most caring people i have ever met. everysingle day for the rest of my life, will be a day without you in it. and thats my biggest loss.
atleast my haley is with him now..

----

thanks to everyone who's stopped by, brought food, called, left messages, it all means so much to me. these past days have been made bareable because of you all. i never felt so much love from people.

tommy i can't even start to thank you for all the stuff you've done for me. if i didnt have you i know all of this would be ten times harder. you've been there for me everyyyy single second of this and thats no exaggeration. i appreciate it so much baby. i love you."

"event","wow came home 2day with tom, note on the stairs saying that they had 2 take tay tay to emergency bc she dislocated her sholderr. we chilled here then he left, and once he left julie came n got me. we picked up trace and had to celebrate the fucking occasion (jenn becky ry :-*)

tonight was fucking so stressful.

+1st were driving in jenns sub. julie has a lighter in her hand she accidentally catches something on fire, the lighter blows up and she lets go of it, drops it between the middle council and the chair. the car started to fucking smoke up so we had to take my water bottle and pour it all over the seats. 

+lost the merchandise

+had to go to some kids house to get DVD's, ended up being some guy in the law enforcement giving us a lecture on how were gunna get in troulbe.

+traces freaky ass is chillin in the front seat, quiana pulls up next to us on vandyke, we all sound like assholes, all of a sudden this guys talking to us, ends up being my dad. peachy.

+julie ran over trace's bag, explolding the huge bottle of tanning lotion inside of it open.

+stopped at my house 4 diffrent times within 20 mins to get...""water,cky,phone, & money"".

+stops at a gas station, the guy up front asked me why we were sitting there for so long >:O


best part is tommy came over. he cares so much about me that i don't know what i would do without him. i love being in love with him :-[

im going to drink some gatorade </3"

yesturdayyyy i was suppose to go to tommys... buttttt he got in trouble so i just ended up staying home :( 

alot alot alot of ppl have been asking me ""oh whats going on between you and tommy""? well even myself i really don't know. i don't know if we just miss eachtoher, or w/e.. im not in a rush to find out either. alot of shit has been goin on so i don't need to worry about fucking realationships.

 my bestestesesetts friends called me and asked me to come over and watch american idol y simple life :-*

we are die hards when it comes to simple life. its hott.

last weekend was fun. friday was julies bday, she had a couple of us over after she got home from work. we celebrated it thats for shure. woke up the next morning, all of us felt like shit so we went in the jacuzzi.

saturday i was suppose to go to krtys bday but me and my mom got into this huge fight so i ended up staying home and going to sleep at like 1030.

this weekend julies mom is going to meh-he-co O:) i really hope she has a coupple ppl over. + i want to hook her up with this kid REALLY bad :-X

in my last LJ comment, someone posted "" oh thats something to be proud of""
and of course idc that they said that, i think its funny that someone is that gay to care, and on top of it go to everyone elses LJ and comment the same thing.. i've done ALOT of stupid things in my life, but now when i look back on it, I HAVE HAD SO MUCH FUN, with so many diffrent ppl my whole life. and i dont regret one thing. you live ONCE, and its a shame that some ppl find ""having fun"" or ""experiencing new things"".. wrong? it's sad for the person that commented bc you obviously have no life, and your scared to leave your name :) but thats okay bc prob the only way you can get noticed is to leave an annoymous comment in ppls LJ. so if it makes you feel like a better person, and puts some excitement in your life, you can leave all the comments you need to :) bc you have the time in your boaring ass life.


ANYWAYS.. my limewire has been really gay lateley and it won't let me DL any songs... so im gunna go try to get that shit working.


ONLY 11 more days of school left to mid-winter break
tommys bday is monday and he prob won't be able to do anything >:O

first off we had that 1/2 day on friday. i got to sleep in till 8 which was soo nice. tommy came n got me then after our exam we went n ate olive garden aaaagain =).. its nice bc we get there at like 11 and thats when they open so everythings fresh and we get service right away. 

tommy j gets this cheeese sauce shit for the breadsticks and hoe shit its so good. :X
after that we went to the movies n saw coach carter. realllly good movie the only thing is that its really long. its kinda like love and basketball + save the last dance.


then we came back to mi casa. later on that night i went out with jennifer alana n trace. we drove aroundd blah blah blah O:) idkkk these girls have been making this shit a routine ;)

last nighttt went to rachaels house. real fuckedd up & fun. i was suppose to go to ambers :( i wanna see her so bad. but i had plans from awhile back. soo anywho, i didnt have any alcohol but thanks to tommy he had a pint of captain just laying around. i love him. trace had a pint of smiroff, so we all had our own shit which was convienent. the only this is i drank that pint in like 10 mins. i got real fucked up, real fast. then these kids had shit, i kept on negotiating with this kid no joke for like 45 mins just talking and talking. so right when he was like okay ill let you guys smoke, i go upstairs and pass out with jennifer lol. 


its so funny bc we were seriously scrounging around for it. they dumped out my whole purse and were getting every little thing that was left in it. but it all worked out for miss guest.

i thought i feel asleep in rachaels but but i woke up in this bunk bed. i woke up and i seriously could have cried i was so fucking sore. idk wat i did last nightbut it felt like i just kept walking up hte stairs and falling down them... my ass hurts so damn bad its unbelivable

2nite no clue was im doing. i want to see my baby bc i miss him :( i talked to him for like .2 seconds last night bc he was sleeping. i wanna seee julie 2nite and play extreme air hockey......... hopefully get to drive around with my babys (jenn alana ;-))

"event","yeah so im getting rid of my OLD LJ, because my sister has a life and reads my LJs and since shes mature she tells my mom everything ;)

haven't written anything in so long bc i don't know how to format these things but anyyyyways

things have gotten better since i left off my last journal... i guess?

i honestly hate my mom. she's the biggest fucking bitch. i kno a lot of ppl say oh blah blah i hate my mom/parents. well any1 that has known me for a long time, knows that since elementary school i've hated her.  all she does is make my life hell. and yeah thats the point to a lot of parents lives, but she enjoys doing it. i hate her for it. she doesnt care about anyone else besides her and her fucking other daughter. i dread comming home every single day just bc i know i have to put up with her shit and the horrible mood shes in EVERYDAY. 

honesntly life without her would be sooo nice. if one day my dad was like shauna lets pack up and leave, i would in a heartbeat.

something i hate about people is when they talk about stuff they don't understand.

don't get me wrong i appreicate EVERYTHING, EVERYONE has done for me. But also you have to understand that i can make decisions for myself. I know what im getting myself into. I know what I want, & and what needs to be done.

any1 who's ACTUALLY been in love, im talking love, not this oh go out for a couple months, knows that sometimes no matter what happens, everything just makes sense when your together. 
NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS...

it's funny when people are like oh i can't belive your talking to tom now, thats so horrible. yeah i know what he did was completly wrong and still is, AND i still don't forgive him for it, but im in love. i can't just STOP talking to him. as much i want to sometimes, you can't forget about those kinds of people.

then when i talk to people that have been in long realationships (not saying any names).. they know EXACTLY what im talking about. they know what it's like to have that feeling that you just need them. those couple people that do understand me, all had that ""ONE INNCODENT"" that made eachother realize how important they were to eachother. 

don't think oh me and tom are going back out or whatever. were just friends as of now, but im not saying nothing is gunna happen with us in the future. im not giving him sympathy, but he is trying. ask anyone who sees him with me now. hes a completely diffrent person.

anyone thats been in love knows that its the best feeling in the world to know that someone cares and adores you just as much as you love them. it isn't just about oh im in love (that is most of it)but tom is a big part in my life. a lot of the things i can't go to my friends about i can go to him. he understands me and i don't have to worry about him getting mad at me or whatever. 

so you can leave me a comment telling me how stupid i am or w/e you want. idc


on a diffrent nottte; we got scheduals 2day

1st hr- Food and Nutrition
2nd hr- Economics
3rd hr- Earth Science
4th hr- Espanol Dos
5th hr- Lunch
6th hr- English
7th hr- Algebra 2
8th hr- MOUS

but it's going to change cause im doing co-op this semester, so i have to talk to palmer about the electives i need 2 drop.

i can't even wait for this mother fucking weekend. Rachael Venzuch was one of my BEST friends, before she moved to Romeo. I remeber when i was ""into the wrong things"", she called me and wasnt like oh shauna you shouldnt do that, she was like shauna i care about you so much and id on't want to see you get hurt. i love her so much and i would do anything for her.

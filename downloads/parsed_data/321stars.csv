"event","I never realized the fun of stepfile making until today! The song I'm making a DWI of is 11WATER's ""<b>BE ALL RIGHT!</b>""

During my super-long spare, I came home and started to work on this. I got the idea to make this song into a stepfile this morning when I was getting ready for school. ^^ I cut the song down to 1:40, and figured out the BPM and GAP. I also made a BG and Banner, but the BG is only temporary. I'll make a better one when I'm done the steps.

I got home from Ruckers, and I started the Heavy steps... well, they're only going to be 4th and 8th notes, but they seem fun to me ^^ I'm only just starting on this whole stepfile thing, so my first one is going to be not that hard since I'm just figuring this whole thing out.

I'm probably going to be really sick of this song when I'm done. ^_^;;

I'm not really going to release it publically until I make a few people play it and give me feedback... and I fix all my mistakes... and yeah. I have to finish my unfinished Silvia Drive stepfile too, so maybe when I'm done both I'll release them together. I'll post the links here when I'm done, but that might not be for awhile.

I have to go to bed now ^_^

I played Fantasy (Max2) as my qualifier... did very badly.
First round was vs. Cliff (cut: 1998, Baby Baby Gimme Your Love played: .59, My Sweet Darlin', Sexy Planet oni)... he won of course by like, I dunno 15ish perfects...

Second round was vs. Josh (cut: My Summer Love, Maximum Overdrive played: Remember You, B4U, I believe in miracles) ... I won... this was my best game of the tournament...

Third round was vs. Cliff again (cut: Hysteria 2001, The Reflex played: Air, Super Star oni, Absolute)... I just died, he won by far.

And by that point I was out... go double elimination :o I guess I did okay for still being somewhat sick and getting little sleep during the past few days...

After that I played a few games and managed to AA Keep On Movin' and get (pathetic) scores on Naoki Neo-Standard and Naoki Standard...

I got 100% on Wonderland (easy) on beatmania 5th mix... well, technically I got 4 Poors because I was pressing the buttons before the song started, but I FCed the rest! Yay! XD

I don't think I did much on MAX2... just tried to play songs that aren't on Extreme. Note to self: next time your there, try to AA ""Nothin' Gonna Stop"".

I got to play Karaoke Revolution for the first time, and I got 98% on ""Addicted"" on my first try... I love that song! The game is pretty nifty, but I'm a terrible singer around other people. XD

Yesterday (Tuesday) wasn't great. I was doing alright until late afternoon when I just lost all energy. However I do know that now I can consistantly pass Love Shine, and I full comboed Look To The Sky (True Color Mix). I also got this weird Random All, but I'll post it later since I don't wanna go get the paper I wrote it down on :o

<B>[edit]</b> Here is that random all:
1. celebrate (ewwww. I also got this on random for Extra Stage later on x.x;; dieeeeeee)
2. Orion.78 Ameuro Mix (looooooove! <3)
3. bag (eek, on x1.5, but I could still read it)
4. Paranoia (the original... fuunn)

Today was alright. I nearly FCed Love Shine (1 good, 1 miss - dunno how many greats) and I AAed Kind Lady again (played Graduation as my Extra Stage). I was really tired, and I was convinced by my friend to play Orion.78 (AMeuro Mix) on Heavy. I tried it before and I couldn't do it... but I passed it tonight with a B. My first 9-footer! XD

Some kid tonight said (not directly to me) that he didn't know girls could play well. >>; I know that's sexist, but I found it a bit funny since I'm one of the worst female players I know :)

I don't know if I mentioned it before but there's going to be a tournament here in the fall, and I'm going in it. Originally I was going to be in Standard... but I was asked to go to Heavy... and I said yes!! o.o; Alot of the Heavy players I know are going to Standard, so maybe I have a chance? Since it's a few months off I still have room for improvement XD

(<lj user=""samimix"">, I saw your MSN name said you went to Ruckers, and I was planning on going, except Melissa called and she wanted to go to CC8. Ahhh... oh well. XD)

Not so much a day for accomplishments. but I did have an interesting random all nonstop:
1. Higher
2. Kiss Me All Night Long
3. Ska a Go Go
(This is where I FAILED. The difficulty on that machine is high, so yes. I screwed up when the song was almost over! I HATE SKA A GO GO!!!!! X_X)

Then we walked to the university where I played 1 1/3 times! :o

Everyone is going tomorrow and I can't... ;_;"

"event","yesterday was not a day for many ddr accomplishments. but it was a day for random all. ooh yes. i copied this from <lj user=""samimix""> and edited cause i was too lazy to retype it. go me :D

<B>1.</B> baby baby gimme your love
(we didn't remember what it was. but we found out)
<B>2.</B> i believe in miracles
(the first two songs sucked ^^)
<B>3.</b> heaven is a 57 metallic gray
<B>4.</B> afronova (from nonstop megamix)
(the one with just challenge steps. ooh.)

the second great nonstop (not oni sami! :P) course:
<B>1.</B> jam jam reggae
(the one that i don't like.)
<B>2.</B> tsugaru (apple mix)
(I NEARLY FAILED. interesting song though, i think with a little work i should be able to pass it and it'll be my first oni step song ^^)
<B>3.</B> maxx unlimited.
(which i chickened out on. i dislike that song. the steps are mean ;_; XD i got ryan to fill in and he failed. ^_^; )

earlier today i realized something kinda funny, tsugaru (apple mix) and maxx unlimited are the order they go in the MAX2 nonstop megamix. nifty :o

oh yes. i accidently chose it's raining men. :o
i played on heavy and didnt do that good, but that beginning part.. i did alright on that although i've never played it before (besides on stepmania like.. once or twice). XD

i REALLY want to play 5th mix right now. sami and i decided that when we go to calgary/edmonton, we shall play. and i'll be the stupid baby. or she will. :D

the pedophile song just came on! :o
Captain Jack - Little Boy (Boy on Boy Mix) XD"

"event","It's about time I got myself one of these DDR journal type things. XD

I'm getting a bunch of AAs in Stepmania. Still working on my real perfect attack though. It sucks <b>great</B>ly. ^^

I played at the University yesterday. I <B>finally</B> got an A on Cowgirl (heavy)! Huzzah. I also played whilest I was out at a house, I'm finally getting used to homepads. ^^ I was suprised to see some songs on DDRMAX USA that I hadn't seen before ^^ I played The Shining Polaris on Heavy.. but the difficulty must have been set somehow strangly, cause I recovered myself whilest failing, and I got an E x_x;"

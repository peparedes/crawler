"event","hey, whats up, not a whole lot here, i was just writing a big emotional one, and for some reason it kinda like disappeared. lol so yeah ill try and make this one as emotional! i have recently gotten into a very big fight, with one of my best friends, but what is the term best friend anyways? i see it as.. a person who you can talk to about anything, and listens, and in return, talks back to you, not just plain old every day things, secrets, gossip.. things that are actually worth hearing! but yea so i got into a big fight with her, and i learned alot about myself, and she learned alot about me also. i know now, i come off as i think im perfect. Do i? well jsut to let everyone know.. i do not think im perfect, i know i am very far from it, and i know, that one day.. i can reach all my goals, and fix not all but most of my imperfections, to me, a best friend, requires trust.. and i trust alot of people, but so far, i have not been trusted back.. so that means.. i have no best friends.. arg life is so confusing.. sometimes i just wanna crawl into a cardboard box.. and just sit there.. safe and sound, away from harm, the closest i can get to that.. is in dustins arms, and i got threatned by that today.. long story not going into it.. well were going climbing tomorrow morning or something.. so i gtg to sleep.. it says im writing at 11:50.. but its really 12:31 hehe ok well every has to have comments on this one.. so COMMENT! hehe

my mom said i cant get my membership until report cards, and if i dont have straight as then i cant get it, i cried (ha its like a blast from the past) rock climbing isnt even that important.. i dont get it! lol..  and i have to get weekly progress report things until the report cards. so right now im gunna go and finish my history extra credit, maybe itll be enough to bump me up to an A i have an 85 as of today, its worth 100 points.. itll bring me close! lol.. 
then in math, oh god, im lucky if i have a B.. but tomorrow im gunna ask her if she has any extra credit.. everyone pray she does! lol.. so for the next few weeks if im busy ppl dont get mad at me! lol... ok well now i gotta go do my report.. COMMENT!!

"event","Ah, Texas politics.  This article makes me proud to be from the same state as Molly, and ashamed about pretty much the rest. http://www.alternet.org/story/22083/

***

I just read what I think might be the answer to the question that has puzzled music theorists for nearly a millenium: what makes minor so sad?  The book is Harmonic Experience by W.A.Matthieu.  It's a strange book that was written as if it were to be read by fourth graders with a fondness for Eastern mysticism.  But it's got some really interesting ideas.  For example he describes a way of deriving the diatonic scale (as well as a number of other scales from around the world) by combinations of the first 4 overtones (and one undertone).

Here, by his description is why minor is sad.  When we play a minor triad, we (of course) here a minor 3rd about the root.  But the most tonally potent note of the triad is still the root.  And the closest overtones  to the root are the 5th (well, octave and a 5th) and the MAJOR 3rd (well, 2 octaves and a major third).  It is the subtle but biting dissonance between the augmented octave of the major and minor third that creates the ""sad"" effect.  It can also explain the Picardy third.  A final cadence to a major triad isn't really a complete resolution of dissonce.  It also explains why the split third is more acceptable to most ears than other kinds of extreme dissonance.  It is a less subtle version of a familiar dissonance.

Cool huh?  Although I'm only partly through, I have to recommend this book.  Don't be put off by its heft (it's only got about 6 words per page) or its tone (7-year old Buddha).  It's just full of exciting info.  It has the most cogent argument as to why the basis of Western tonal music is the Ionian mode rather than the Lydian.  Are you familiar with this puzzle?  There's an amazing book on the subject, The Lydian Chromatic Concept of Tonal Organization for Improvisation by George Russel.

The argument goes like this: traditionally, theorists will tell you that the major scale comes directly from the overtone series.  This is frustratingly inaccurate.  For one thing, beyong 7-8 partials they are almost impossible to perceive (both because frequency increases exponentially and amplitude decreases).  But even more frustratingly, fa does not appear ANYWHERE in the overtone series.  But, confusingly, Fi does.  There are several discrepancies, but this is the most severe.  If you were to build a scale based on the overtones series (firstly it wouldn't be in equal temperment, but that's a different story altogether) you would sooner build a Lydian scale than an Ionian.

Solution?  Well, according to Russel, Western music is bastardized and less perfect than modal jazz.  According to Matthieu (who is pretty non-judgemental), it is simply that do is the 2nd partial of fa.  They are reciprocally related, in his termonology.  Pretty neat, methinks."

"event","Today I have a few interesting links and a hotbutton question that I well-and-truly don't know the answer to.  A question:

Is Roe vs. Wade really constitutional?  Let me start this by saying that I am COMPLETELY pro-choice.  I would never ever vote for a pro-life candidate, and I think it is one of the most important stances of the Democratic party.  That said, is it really appropriate for the court to make this decision?  It does seem rather like it should be a legislative decision rather than judicial.  Don't get me wrong.  I'm happy for the most part with the results.  And I know if Roe was overturned (which I predict it will be in the next 3-5 years) there will be sad and terrible results for young women in the South.  

But is it really Constitutional?  I mean, where, after all, does it say anything that relates?  My Body, My Choice is a good slogan, but of course, the government makes medical decisions constantly.  For example, I think it makes perfect sense for the government to require helmets for motorcycles and seatbelts for cars.  To go further, I think it makes perfect sense for crack cocaine to be illegal.  I think that it's constitutional to make laws forbidding dangerous medical procedures.  So just because it's our body doesn't mean we can do any fool thing we want.

Also, the old saw about ""don't legislate morality"" doesn't really hold up either.  I'm not saying that it's a good idea to legislate morality, just that it is clearly constitutional.  After all, what is the basis of most law if not a sense of right and wrong?

I'm not trying to be arumentative.  In point of fact, I would REALLY love it if someone could provide me with a good answer to this question.  I would feel much more comfortible about the status quo.

"event","I just got back from Episode III, and I have a big smile on my face.  In short, the reviews (for once) are right.  It fulfills the promise of the new trilogy.  I think I understand the problem with Ep. 1-2 as well.  Basically, almost all of the interesting plot points that happen in the first half happen in this movie.  Basically, the first two movies twiddled their thumbs and waited for the good stuff.

A few spoilers ahead, but you all really already know anyway...
Anakan, Not well actued, but such a fantastic character that it all really works
Padme, Not much of a role, but fine
Obe-wan, Fantastic.  Sad and real and very, very tragic (especially since we essentially know what comes next).
Yoda, This muppet can kick ass.
Emporer Palpatine, No wonder they had to animate everything.  This guy done chewed up all the scenery in sight.  Seriously, he made this movie go.  Was it overdone?  Yes.  But in all the right ways.  Really, it was his unveiling as the Sith Lord that made Anakin's transformation work.

The dialogue, Sucked as always.  Especially the love scenes.
The action, Really good.  It's hard to compare other kinds of movies, but to me I truly felt like a kid at times.  When one robot pulled out 4 light-sabers I damn near peed myself.
The visuals, Amazing.  Really more so than any other animated movie I've ever seen.  Sometimes it was a little much and could distract from the plot, but who cares.   I want to see it again.
The plot, This is the money movie.  Everything is heightened and scary and sad and melodramatic in the best way.  Also, everything tied together very effectively.
The music, Disappointing.  Just replays all the old themes without really adding anything new.  Even moments that seemed perfect opportunities basically just sounded like loud underscoring.
The politics, You can certainly read into it a political message, but it is so general in a way that nobody could really claim to own those politics.  If Lucas hadn't fed that fire, I suspect it would be no story at all.
Robbie's prediction, Well, see for yourself.

Perhaps the best thing about this movie is that even though Lucas probably really did visualize a lot of this 30 years ago (the plot works out so well I think he really did), but he was very much willing to compromise with his audience.  Jar jar is gone except for one scene (in which he doesn't speak), the Midichlorians are barely mentioned, and the movie is every bit as dark as it needs to be.  I'm just so happy that this series went out on this note."

1. If you could choose to live anywhere on the planet, where would it be? Why?
2. If you had to choose another career besides music, what would it be and why?
3. Do you think that the future of classical music is in trouble? Elaborate.
4. What value do you feel the various 20th century non-diatonic styles give to 21st century diatonic composers?
5. If you could convince the world of one essential truth (in your view), what would it be?


1. If you could choose to live anywhere on the planet, where would it be? Why?
I would like to live in the Hobbit Hole from Lord of the Rings. My home should be a little cozy sanctuary. I love going out into the big noisy world, but I'm happiest curled up in a warm place.

2. If you had to choose another career besides music, what would it be and why?
International currency trader. If I couldn't do what I love, I'd just say to hell with it and make as much money as I could. Besides, I'm curious to meet my Doppelganger.

3. Do you think that the future of classical music is in trouble? Elaborate.
I think there's a good chance that classical music as we know it will be completely gone during my lifetime. That every major orchestra, at least in the United States will fold, and every music department and conservatory will either go under or be folded into the Entertainment Media Department. How's that for trouble?

Classical music has been sick and slowly dying since the mid-60s. It's a slow retreat due purely to the fact that little new music is being embraced by classical audiences. This is the fault of composers, conductors, soloists, and, frankly, audiences. Unless a concerted (so to speak) effort is made by all of those parties, our slow death will continue.

4. What value do you feel the various 20th century non-diatonic styles give to 21st century diatonic composers?
A huge headache. No, just kidding. Let me hit the major non-diatonic styles (that immediately occur to me).

Influence of other cultures: Principally music using pentatonic scales. It gave a fascinating new sound for sophisticated composers that were able to integrate it into the tradition. And it gave mediocrities a nice little trick that was easy to write.

Atonality: Initially, this was an exciting idea that gave composers a taste of what was possible. It's always baffled me that this era in music was so short-lived. My sense is that tonality was such a beautiful and complete system, that composers felt an overwhelming desire to hierarchically organize their music.

12-tone/Serialism: A nearly unqualified disaster. It turned off audiences, classical audiences in droves, while nevertheless failing to produce a large body of works of lasting quality. It wasn't Schoenberg in the 20's that caused the problem, it was his acolyte's acolytes in the 50s that really did the damage.

One good side effect is that while atonality showed us what might be possible, serialism showed us what isn't.

Noise music: Interesting but limited. It has never been (and likely will never be) a major independent element of music. On the other hand, the idea of timbre being one of the primary elements of music has been one of the most important (and welcome) contributions to music in the last century. Unfortunately, this idea tended too often to to be coupled, at least initially, with the previous entry.

One thing to remember: Tonality is not exactly a diatonic style. Chromaticism (and often lots of it) is absolutely essential to baroque-classical-romantic harmony. It's not uncommon for a Bach chorale to include all 12 pitches. Even music from the Rennaissance (say, Palestrina) was chromatic. In a certain sense purely diatonic music is as revolutionary (from the point of view late Romanticism) as atonality.

5. If you could convince the world of one essential truth (in your view), what would it be?I'd be luck to convince MYSELF of one essential truth. Truth is not exactly subjective, but it is impermanent."

I remember on a different list arguing with a-barrese about Episode I (I believe I argued that in many ways it wasn't that much worse than Episode IV).  I thought Episode II was big improvement (although still nothing to write home about).  And all reports (even the NYTimes) seem to be that Episode III is damn good.  The Empire Strikes Back was the first ""adult"" movie I ever saw in theaters, and man, I loved it.  It's the best of the series and a quite good movie all the way around.

Anyway, he told me that the climactic scene would be a light saber duel on the lip of a volcano between Anakan and Obe-wan.  The Anakan would fall in the volcano and have to be rebuilt.  And that's why Vader is this half-machine thing.  At the time it sounded cool but pretty far fetched, but guess what's in the trailer!  Anakan and Obe-wan dueling on the lip of a volcano!

"event","Sports.  requiella was asked about this in her interview so I thought I would talk a little about it, since probably most of you don't enjoy sports.

I have to say, I do like sports, especially professional football and basketball.  As we speak I'm watching the Pacers-Pistons Game 3.  Not many in academia (especially the arts) share my opinion, but to me there is some things that you get in sports that you really don't get anywhere else.  Two things, actually.

1) A total, total meritocracy (well, pretty much).  The thing about sports is that it TOTALLY doesn't matter if you're ugly, stupid, have unpleasant breath or anything else.  It only matters if you can play.  It doesn't even really matter if you're big or little, fast or slow, tall or short.  Obviously, those things help, but some of the best that have ever played don't fit the mold.  Arguably the best basketball player in the world right now is 5'11"".  The greatest running back of all time is only 5'10"".  All that matters is what you can do on the field.

2) The stories.  If you don't know the stories behind the game, their absolutely no fun at ALL.  What makes games exciting is when you understand the circumstances, know the players, GET the story.  It's really not about winning or losing.  It's about knowing that Jamal Tinsley is playing even though he's injured and his mother died last month.  It's about knowing that Reggie Miller is retiring after this season, so every game could be his last.  What a difference.

Now, I admit there are some ugly things about professional sports.  The one that bothers me less than most people is rich athletes.  After all, it isn't a choice between rich athletes and not.  It's a choice between rich athletes and ridiculously rich owners.  It just happens that pro athletes have the best and most effective unions on planet Earth.

Athletes are jerks.  True, but no more so than everyone else.  Athletes are arrogant.  Yes, but no more so than your other average millionaire.  The millions spent by cities to fund stadiums could be much better spent elsewhere.  Undoubtedly, I hate it.  It's socialized sports where Bush made his fortune, remember.  But certainly none of these are reasons to boycott sports."

Obviously, we're not looking at the work of thoroughly fact-checked professional reporters.  On the other hand, lately those guys have been drastically falling down on the job, so it's hard to know.  This kind of story always produces in me a kind of ""Yee-ergh"" reaction.  Part of me wants to say, ""Yeah!  See, America isn't that dumb.  We didn't really re-elect a guy of such staggering incompetence.  Barrese on another post said that he felt totally alienated from his culture.  Well, I certainly never felt more alienated than I did last November.  After all, what COULD those millions of voters have been thinking.  They had to get up off their duffs and intentionally vote for a guy who had done such a poor job.

Of course, the other part of me realizes that reports are probably just wild conspiracy theories.  The equivalent of ""Clinton Cocaine Murder!"" stories from the right.

My first impulse was to write Primary: composer, Secondary: Professor of Music (read: theory teacher).  But as I put pen to paper it occured to me that it wasn't really honest.  I spend most of my time and get most of my money from my ""secondary"" profession.  In fact, it isn't even close.  This year it's easily 10 to 1 in both time, money, and, let's be honest, effort.

And, of course, of the time and effort I spend ""composing,"" a huge fraction is really copying, editing, music business junk, rehearsing, recruiting, and, naturally, starting blankly at an empty page of score because I'm too tired to be creative.  So am I composer?

Of course, the painful truth is that you do what you do.  I guess I'd rather be a theory teacher than a waiter.  At least I'm in music.  But I'm starting to get a sense of why so many composers mysteriously give up tenure and security to take a furious stab at actually being a full-time composer.

So here's my goal for the next school year: theory grading be damned, I'm going to be a composer (primarily)."

"event","I wonder, arny of you out there Air America listeners?  If you've never heard of it, Air America is a relatively new liberal radio network that is meant to challenge the Rush Limbaughs of the world.  It's mostly an Al Franken vehicle, but they have nearly 20 hours of new programming every weekday.  There's also, I believe, Democracy Now, which is a syndicated version of the same thing (with more moderate but less famous hosts).

I've only listened a few times.  Al is funny sometimes, and he is great at lampooning the ridiculous talking head of the Right like O'Reilly.  Everyone else I've ever listened to is either dull or just screechy.  It's tempting to dismiss the whole operation.

The other day I went to a little shot in town to buy some balloons.  There was a middle aged woman running the shop, and she was listening to talk radio.  I didn't recognize the name, but he was extremely right wing, saying that congressional Democrats were knowingly aiding the terrorists.  It took a while to fill all the balloons, so I listened for a while.  After a few minutes, I asked her what she thought of the guy.  She thought a moment and said, ""Well, I really just like the country music that comes on before this, but I listen to him anyway.""

It makes me what a potent job the right has done at just getting their message in people's ears.  Most people don't really care deeply about most issues.  But if you have someone whispering in your ear every day for a couple of hours, slow your opinions can be shaped.

The only trick is to have no respect for true journalism.  Which brings us back to Air America.  If there was no Rush Limbaugh, I would have a hard time swallowing what they do.  But It's SO important to have that voice whispering in folks' other ear.  Do we fight fire with fire?  Do we aim for the other guy's eyes?"

"event","I just talked to an old friend of mine, one of the most talented composers I know, Dorothy Chang.  She told me a fantastic story of rampant Anti-Americanism in music.  She took a job in British Columbia at one of the most prestigious music schools in Canada (she is Chinese-American, but her husband is Italian-Canadian).  Anyway, there is a law in Canada that requires universities to hire a Canadian unless there are no qualified Canadians for the post.  After she'd had the job for a while, there was a simulataneous protest from the Canadian Composers Society and the Canadian Woman Composers Society.  They filed suit saying she was illegally hired.  There were also simulataneous stories about it in the four biggest Canadian newspapers.  Anyway, she wasn't fired, but she told me that there are people that still won't look at her or speak to her at concerts.  Amazing.

Can you imagine if Americans treated a foreigner of any stripe that way?  It galls me the level of artistic anti-Americanism in Canadians and Europeans.  It is sad and hypocritical that Europeans are so provential when it comes to American music.  It's even a bigger problem because overwhelmingly Europeans control the major American orchestras."

He is so good at articulating exactly why those sneaky suspisions you have about the administrations motives are right on target.  He is never snooty or results to name calling.  He just gives the aweful truth.

I think I've come to the sad realization when it comes to gay rights, we aren't in the late 60's, we're in early 1950's Alabama.  It's all well and good that the administration and congressional Repubs have taken some hits in the last couple of months.  But remember, they are going to extract their pound of flesh.  They realize that this is their chance to change our culture for a long time to come.

"event","A few days ago Ann Coulter came to St. Olaf.  For some reason I had the expectation that everyone would pretty much behave in a college setting.  Wrong.

Apparently (I didn't go) it was a madhouse.  She basically spent the entire time ripping liberals and liberal personalities.  But instead of just letting her rant and leaving it at that, liberal groups got very angry and tried to make her look bad.  Hard to make a professional provocateure look bad.  Naturally, she had a snappy (if vapid) comeback for everything.  But some people really made themselves look bad by shouting ""Are you a virgin?"" and ""I'll pray for you.""

But what really struck me was the title and topic of her talk.  The title was ""Liberalism and Terrorism: Different Stages of the Same Disease.""  I think alot about what I should or shouldn't say about my political beliefs at school.  It wouldn't do to have your theory professor spouting off his politics in class.  But what about after class?  What about in a private lesson?  What if a student simply reads this journal?

What really struck me was that she basically called liberals insipeant terrorists.  Of course, a few month ago an idiot college professor from Colorado called the people working at the WTC ""little Eichmanns.""  Of course, he was just an idiot spouting off and making decent liberals look bad.  But the reaction was telling.  It was on the cable talk shows for weeks.  The governer of Colorado called for his dismissal.  The president of the university had to resign (on top of some other stuff).  That's how this country reacts to a liberal saying something stupid.  

Now we have the university paying (reportedly) $20,000 to have Ann Coulter comparing 49% of the country terrorists.  How does the country react to a conservative doing the same thing?  No backlash.  The governer of Colorado is back to fishing or whatever.  The president of St. Olaf's job security has never been better.

It's a scary time to be a liberal in a university."

"event","I went to an amazing new music concert last night.  The audience was almost entirely under 25, and they were so into it.  All of the pieces were brand new, and they ranged from incredibly serious to completely silly, from really damn good to barely passable.  But people were cheering and screaming and laughing out loud.  It was a small hall, but it was almost full and the excitement was fantastic.  Not surprisingly, the pieces that got the noisiest response were the really funny pieces (one for lounge singer and distorted electric ukulele was particularly popular.  But every piece got respect and big applause.

"event","Allow me to play devil's advocate for a moment and give you the case for war that wasn't made.  Imagine for a moment that instead of Pres. Bush coming to you asking to go to war with a country on the other side of world because someday they might imagine that they might want to attack us (somehow), that the situation was a little different.

Imagine that in 2003, Pres. Nader went before the United Nations and made the following speech:
We have before us a crisis.  At this very moment, thousands are dying in Iraq.  Sadam Hussein and the Baath party are assassinating thousands of Kurds and entire villages that resist their totalitarian rule.  Just as tragic, sanctions that we hoped would force Saddam Hussein to change his ways for the better have instead made things even more desparate and aweful for ordinary Iraqis.  We have run out of options.  The world must band together to save the people of Iraq from this merciless dictator.  Yes, there are other nations that abuse their people.  And yes, we are far from perfect ourselves.  But when innocents are being murdered, it is time to act.  Surely there can be no more just cause for war than to protect the innocent and helpless from the violent and oppressive.

That, my friends, is a war that sounds worth fighting.  That was indeed the situation in 2003, and Pres. Bush COULD have made that case.  Why did he choose to make the case for an illegal war for selfish (and frankly ridiculous) reasons?  When he could have made the selfless (and legal) case for a war of morality?  Why?...

Because it never occured to him."

"event","Friends!  This journal will be dedicated to mostly music and politics.  Since nobody in the history of the internet has ever devoted a daily journal to those topics, it's hard to know what form it will take.  For the next two months I will be finishing school and taking a 6 week trip to China to visit family, see the countryside, and compose, but I will pick back up in mid July-2005

In the meantime, check out this website to learn about how great I am:

There are more great musicians and composers writing, playing, and singing now than at any point in the 18th-19th centuries.  Find them!"

"event","I had a really good time this past weekend.  My friends from home came down to visit for Gator Growl.  It was really awesome getting to see them.  I miss getting to hang out with them on a regular basis.  I wish Tuna could have come down, but he got to see his sister so its cool.  He will be coming down soon though so its all good.  I think Ben is going to come down at the same time Tuna does.  It should be a lot of fun.  I hope everyone that came down had a great time here.  I'm looking forward to seeing them again"

"event","Hey everyone!!!  It's been a while since I've updated.  I should update more to tell ya'll how I am doing, but I talk to most of you on the phone or online, so I guess its cool.  Ok, Jon and I didnt get season ticket to the football gamesso we have to call every thursday after 6 pm to try to get tickets.  Jon was able to get them, but by the time I got through they were sold out.  So I'm probably going to be sitting at home all alone on Saturday night since all of my friends will be at the game.  This really sucks."

"event","Today me jon and our families drove down to gainesville.  Tomorrow we move in to our apartment.  I'm excited.  This is a new experience for me so it should be interesting.  I'm looking forward to it.  My parents leave on Sunday, the same day that our two other roommates are supposed to come, so I'm not sure if they will get to meet them.  Sarah S. called me today when I was on the way and we talked for about 40 minutes.  I really liked it.  I enjoy talking to her.  When I was loading up the truck this morning with the stuff we were taking I saw some stuff that I specifically told my mom that I did not want to take.  So, I guess she will be bringing a lot of stuff back to P'cola.  Oh well.  I'll update in the next few days to let everyone know how we are doing and to update on my grandmother."

"event","This is a follow up to my post about my grandmother.  She Had some tests run yesterday but they couldn't determine anything from them, so today she went in for surgery.  She had a blockage in her colon so they had to take out about a 6 inch section.  While they had her open they saw a growth on her ovary so they took that out and gave her a historectomy (sp?).  I guess she can't have any more kids now.  Anyways, she has to spend tonight in ICU and then the next 7-10 days in the hospital.  They sent the growth to the lab.  So please continue to pray for her. Thanks."

Oh well.  At least I have color.  When I got home I found out my grandmother was in the emergency room.  She was complaining of a stomache ache.  She has a blocked intestine and her stomached was getting backed up.  She might have to have surgery.  She has a tube down her nose going to her stomache to drain the stuff that backed up.  I hope she gets better soon.  Please pray for her.  

  I leave on friday to go to Gainesville. I'm so excited to leave.  I really should start packing."

"event","Today I went golfing with Hokie in Foley.  I was playing great on the front nine, and I was winning.  On the back nine I started off fine, and then my game went down the crapper.  Ok, here is what makes it interesting.  On the 16th hole I finally had enough and decided to throw my 9 iron.  I accidently threw it right of where I was aiming and it went in a lake.  Yeah, thats right, in a lake.  Right when I threw it I knew thats where it was headed, so i started to run after it and said ""oh shit!!""   Ok, so I tried to go in after it but the water was too deep and I would have been wet from head to toe.  So, anybody up for a swim, I know this great place in Foley Alabama"

"event","Today was a great trip to Big Kahuna's.  It was really fun.  I'm not really big into theme parks and stuff like that, but I had a suprisingly good time.  There were 15 people in our group.  I think the only person that was missing was John Fortuna.  He is like me in the theme park area so I think that is why he didn't go, plus he had work.  I got a little burned today.  You can tell where Susie miss me with sun screen.

"event","Today I really did not want to go to work so I called to see if they had power and they did so I had to go in.  Dang.  So, what's up with everything closing so early.  Yesterday I went to Target at 6:00 and they had closed.  I was kinda mad because 297-A is closed so I have to go way out of my way to go anywhere.  Today at work I had to run an errand and when I got there they had closed at noon.  Noon just seems to be rediculously early.  At least it was the company's gas wasted that time.  Then tonight I tried to go to the gym at 7:15, but as you could probably guess, it was closed.  It had closed at 7:00.  I know Escambia County has a curfew, but it is a 10:00 so closing that early aggervates me."

"event","So today I went to the gym for the first time in about a week and when I was leaving I decided to go get my hair cut.  I always go to cuts by us next to albertson's and this time was no different.  I asked her to cut the sides and to take a ""little"" off the top.  Well, needless to say, she might as well have shaved my head.  My hair is really short now and I don't really like it.  And this happens a lot because I can never get the same lady to cut my hair."

"event","Just a few minutes ago we got our power back.  Woo Hoo!!!  It's very exciting.  We came through the hurricane really well.  One tree in our back yard fell and another fell in our neighbor's.  We got to see both trees fall since it happened in the afternoon.  That was pretty cool, but also a little scary.
  Every hurricane our friends from the beach come and stay with us for obvious reasons.  They got to go to the beach to check on their house today and it was not what they expected.  The shariff said that P'cola beach come through great, but when they got out there they were missing the roof on their house.  They also said that many of the houses that made it through Ivan didn't through Dennis.  So, we don't know how long they will be living with us.  Oh well, I like them here because it is like having 2 moms."

"event","I just got home from North Carolina from my family vacation/ reunion trip.  It was pretty good.  I got to see some cousins and uncles that I only get to see once or twice a year.  We had a big dinner on the third of july because many people had to travel on the fourth to get back to work on the fifth.  We had a lot of food.  
  Last night, the cousins that were still there, we went to see the fireworks.  Usually we get to sit almost right under the fireworks because they light them on the baseball field at the end of our street, but this time they were butt heads and made us move.  It was still really good though for such a small town.  The town has one stop light and every thing pretty much locks up at 6 at night.  
  The trip tonight was really long, or at least it seemed that way because my sister and dad argued almost the whole way home.  The don't get along very well.  
  My dad gave me the rest of the week off of work so that is really cool.  I don't know what I am going to do for the rest of the week though.  I might go to the beach or play a little golf.  Who knows."

The first time it happened I had an allergic reaction so I couldn't work out for a while.  The next time I got back in the routine I got a sinus infection so I had to stop.  And now I am going to North Carolina for a family reunion over the 4th."

"event","Today Tuna and I played golf out at the Moors.  The course was in terrific condition.  I really enjoy playing that course. (or any nice course for that matter.)  So, I was expecting today to be a great day of golf.  I started out hitting wonderful shots on the practice range.  Also, on the first hole I hit two good shots and ended up two putting for par.  After that my round of golf was wierd.  I hit all but two shots off of the tee great.  It didn't matter weather or not I was hitting a driver or an iron.  It always seemed to go where I wanted it to go.  However, all om my second shots out of the fairway were down right awful.  I shanked 90% of them.  Shanks are not good at all. I would not have gotten upset if I would have consistantly hit the bad shots, but I would hit good and bad shots using the same club.  I ended up shooting a 26 over par score of 96, but I feel that if I would have hit better shots out of the fairways my score would have been probably 15 strokes better."

"event","So, I was heathy as a horse (whatever that means) about 2 weeks ago.  Then I got my allergy shots and I majically became conjested.  So, I started taking some allergy medicine.  Then, about 2 days ago my throat started to hurt, and all I could think was, ""Crap.""  Every time that happens it is the precursor to a sinus infection.  Thats no good, so I took all kinds of allergy medicine. But, it didn't do any good.  My throat isn't as sore as it was the other day but now I have some intense sinus pressure and I sound terrible.  Hopefully I will get better soon.
   Tomorrow John Fortuna and I are going to play golf at the Moors.  I can't wait for that.  It is one of my favorite golf courses.  By the way, I shot a 74 the other day at Champion golf course.  That happens to be my personal best."

My new one can be a laptop or a tablet PC depending on what I need at the time. I can take my class notes on it with a special pen that came with it. I really enjoy using it.

"event","I just got home from my bowling trip to Melbourne, FL.  It was pretty fun.  I averaged 160 while there.  That was normal for me so I doubt I will win any thing.  This girl on the lane next to me bowled a 300 the first game of the tournament.  It was pretty cool.  We had a hard time discerning which sex it was until it was announced though.  Some other guy bowled an 800 after 3 games, that means he averaged around 267, not bad for a kid, or anyone for that matter.  Anyways, I am glad to be home."

I'm excited because my new laptop should be at my house tomorrow sometime.  It left the factory today and I paid the extra $30 to have it overnighted.  I can't wait.  The one I have right now really sucks.  It keeps overheating and turning itself off and now it will only work when it is plugged into the wall.  What the crap.

This weekend I am going to a bowling tournament down in Melbourne. Florida that is (I wish it was Australia though).  I'm going to be bowling double with Nicole Haubrich so that is going to be exciting.  I am going to be staying at my grandparents house in Melbourne so I dont have to pay for a hotel room.  It would be a little better though if the were going to be there.  I dont really get to see them that often.  I dont have to work again until monday so thats cool."

"event","Today has to be the most interest/scary day of my life. Today was going pretty normal, I went to work for 2 hours, then I went to class.  Today was Jon's day to drive after school to lunch but first I had to get allergy shots. So, I got my shots and we went to meet Ben for lunch at Quiznos.  Towards the end of the meal, however, I started to find it hard to breathe.  Jon got up to use the restroom and I told Ben I needed to go outside, so he joined me.  When Jon came outside I calmly asked him to take me back to my allergist where I had gotten my shots.  So he did.  I must have looked pretty bad when I walked in becuase the nurse at the reception desk just pointed towards the nurses station (she couldnt talk to me becasue she was on the phone.)  So I walked back there and my doctor and two nurses were there and gave me a funny look.  I then said in a very calm tone, ""I look pretty bad, don't I?""  They just shook their heads yes and told me to sit down.  When I sat down they gave me liquid Zertec and an adreniline shot to help.  Then they gave me this weird inhaler and told me to breathe with my mouth to it.  I had to breathe throught it for about 15 minutes.  After I was doing better they gave me a prednazone so it wouldn't happen again today.  I am feeling much better, but now I have broken out in hives all over my body.  It itches and looks gross but it won't spread, so I guess that Is good.  I am supposed to be taking a biology test in about an hour but I emailed my teacher and told her my story so hopefully she will let me make it up, Cause i sure as heck ain't going to it.  Also, this happened at a great time,  I am supposed to be going down to south FL tomorrow to visit my grandpa for his birthday.  Oh well, stuff happens.  I hope everone's day was better than mine.

The service sucked.  We only saw the waitress twice after we got our food.  Afterward we went to Academy Sprots and Outdoor and Target to kill time.  Then we came back to my house to eat chocolate chip pancakes.  They were great.  Also, Sarah won bingo last night so we ended up playing for free,  and thats always great.

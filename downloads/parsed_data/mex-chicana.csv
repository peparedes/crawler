I would have never thought that he would go for a girl like marshe. it's crazy to me. i really think that he only went with marshe for some action. i wrote a long ass letter about how i feel and i have so many mixed emotions. i really wanna just sit him down and read him my letter. i want him to know how he made me feel. and how i feel about him after what had happen.i could be friends with him? idk. i really liked him he was a great person. i am jealous because he wanted marshe over me. marshe maybe prettier than me,or skinnier. but i know that i have a way better heart then her. He used to be able to see that. I know its partly my fault that he went with her. i mean i broke up with him. and yea i knew he was going to get another gf, but MARSHE? wow. and marshe i dont even wanna see. after everything. everyday i told her that i liked him so much and that i am going to talk to him. and she looked me straight in the eye and told me i should and said that i should try to get back with him. She lied straight to my face saying she had a man named matt?? w/e you shouldnt have be such a pussy and just told me staright up. i could never trust her again. how do i know she didnt fuck with anyone esles relationships. how do i know that it wasnt her stealing from my house. all i know is that she wil never be able to come to my house or talked to me. i dont even wanna see her face in school. which will suck because in school we picked alot of the same classes. Everyone asked why didnt i beat her ass at the store i saw them in. i couldnt i was to hurt to even think when i saw them it felt like i was getting stabbed. w/e. i have some of her shit and she will NOT be getting it back. half of it is ripped up in the garbage can. i feel like a loser talking about all of this over and over. and then crying about it. i just hope i am able to talk to him to get all my feelings out in the open. Marshe just doesnt really know, she doesnt know anything about him. its weird the days he hung out with marshe before i knew. johnny would comeover after and he would be all nice and sweet. we would flirt and laugh like nothing was wrong. it was all there in front of us we just never put the pieces together. marshe was just a way for him to get a piece of ass b4 he leaves. if he realy liked her he would wanna stay. and be with her like he wanted to do last year for me. Before i broke up with him he told me he wanted to stay for his senior year. well i guess not. i think he really doesnt like marshe. yea maybe to get his dick sucked or to fuck her. but w/e its over and done with. i just hope we can be on good terms before he leaves."

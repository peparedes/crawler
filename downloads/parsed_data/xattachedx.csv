"event","Ok. so the weekend was okay. i heard somewhat exciting news. not gonna elaborate. but here's the weekend.

Friday - blew. i went to oxford lake. bored as hell. went to BAM afterwards. saw nathan. only decent person there. it was ...nice.

Saturday - Went to Books-A-Million and stayed the whole night. from like 7:30 - 11:30. but it was nice. i saw great people. saw lame people too. soo, the crowd started to fade as normal, and i called matt. he said he had tried get in touch with me all night. oops =X so he came up to books a million and hung out about an hour. went back to nikis. sleepy time.

Today - Came home. Called Matt. Matt met the rents'. they seemed to get along. niceee. went to his place. came home. here i am.

someone better call. or else. grr.

Man oh man i'm super sickly. i think. see i didnt sleep much last night at all. i woke up with my eyes completely Dialated. they are HUGE. i cant eat. period. the sound of food sounds repulsive. i'm shaking super bad. ekk. i just dont know whats wrong with me! i wanna get over this...soon!

Ok...so i need to rephrase myself. I dont think that Fri/Sat were the best nights of my life...

<i>m a n</i>, i dunno whats wrong with Jared. He has been acting awfully odd lately. even Matt agreed with me. oh well. maybe just pms. i hope. i dont like him like this.

Me and matt are supposed to hang out this week. But, well, he does work. Plus with their show this friday((the 4th)), they have to practice all week. he called me after practice last night. around...11? i felt so bad for him. he sounded so tired. Hopefully tonight...yah. hopefully tonight.

"event","Wow, I can't believe how busy things are right now, but I must say- I'm allowing myself to get a bit distracted, but I am making sure to get everything done.  The AP Stats test was yesterday and I think I did really well- it must've been all that time I spent on the phone the night before instead of staring at my review book.  The multiple choice were actually very easy, and I only didn't answer one part of one open ended, so I deffinitely think that I could've gotten a 4.  English is tomorrow, which I can't get credit for in college as it is, so I am really just looking to pass it and am not going to spend any time stressing out over it.  With my luck I'll get a 5 on English and a 3 on Bio and Stats.  

My voice concert was on Sunday and went very well.  My first two songs, which were my classical ones, went really well and Margaret was even smiling.  I didn't care what my parents had to say- just as long as I didn't get yelled at at my lesson today; I relish being the favorite.  Well, my duet w/ the Jolynn (who didn't show up when we were supposed to work on our duet last Friday) did not go smoothly.  The girl randomly was saying lines from the end of the first verse during the beginning of the second.  I had to rhyme off of her, so it was loads of fun.  I heard Funa walk in right after, because the door slammed really loudly.  Way to make an entrance!  Funa and I had an awesome weekend, even if she did cry when she was getting rid of her old Jeep, when she got a hot new Liberty.  She drove when we got Froyo on Sunday, so I think she's starting to act like a sane individual and enjoy her hot new car.  Speaking of froyo, I could not be a hills student without mentioning that Tasty Delight opens at Demarest Farms on Saturday and the froyo has no carbs!  Wow- ok, too much jappyness.  I actually don't even know how to get to Demarest farms and I'm not exactly sure why we're supposed to be excited about the new froyo place when we have 5 million others, but we'll see.  Maybe they'll put pictures of all the Japs eating up a storm- oh wait, that's every other place around here.  


Alrighty, I updated, so you can all stop bugging me- Study Hall is just about over so I must go.  No one is hear to talk to today because everyone is taking tests or randomly staying home.  Happy Cinco de Mayo everyone!  I love how everyone wants to throw parties, yet no one knows what the hell we're celebrating.  WOOOOO  Live it UPP!!!

Ohhhh Ali Poles- I can not wait until our chick flick fest with Mr. Billiter on Saturday night.  Hehehe- I'm thinking a little Legally Blonde 2 to please Billits (ok, even I can't stomach the thought of that sequel- we'll have to watch the first one) Yawn- it's only first period and I already am trying to plan when I can fit a nap in.  Seacrest- OUT! (p.s., why DOES he do that?)"

"event","OK----I have never been this busy- I swear- but I'll update my livejournal anyway, because I'm a senior, I shouldn't be so stressed out.  Actually, despite being so busy- I'm really not stressed about any of this crap I have to do.

OK- So I had to make up 2 Bio tests, because Sheilds decided to go test crazy before the AP Test.  I love that man, but he needs to chill with the tests.  Well, for those of you who are unaware- I am not a very good science student AT ALL.  I am scientifically challenged, YET I WHOOPED LAWRENCE WILLIAM DOMINICK GRECO ON OUR BIO TESTS!

Inverterbrate Test: 45/50 !!!!!!!!!!
Vertebrate Test: 47/50!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Yea, I belive Larry only got an 84 on Invertebrates...muhahahahaha this never happens!  Ooh it's like competitive season all over again.

OHHH, we have prom news...I am now going to Junior Prom with Jen Mosh- my 3rd prom this year!!! And I went to the Holiday Ball for the first time, so that's a lot of dances for me!  I'm bustin a move!  I mean, the world does like to whore me out as their prom date.  I will be at 2 Proms w/ Billiter and Ali Poles!  How fanfuckingtastic is that?  I am sooo gonna make Billits dance w/me!  I mean, Billits totally kissed me on the cheek when I saw him on Saturday- watch out Ali- your bf seems to be a bit attracted to me.  We are taking pics w/ Ali Poles for prom and going in their limo to JUNIOR PROM!?!?!  You can tell this is a Beckerman prom!  We're also sleeping over at Beckerman's- which is very exciting.

Oh, in Espanol 5 ayer, we listened to this riske songs that Senor Lauro is obsessed with.  My gaydar was pinging when reading the lyrics to ""entiendas"", and apparently ""entiendas?"" is the way one asks another if they are gay in spanish speaking contries.  So Entiendas Chris Billits? Yo creyo que si.  I just got back from el ultimo excursion del club de espanol.  We went to fiesta mexico and it was fun, despite Jamie D ditching me like that bitch that she is to do homework!  Fuck that!  She left me w/ all of my ""favorite"" people ever, who I just ""love.""  Oh well- the food was really good.

Well I best be starting my Tango project for Spanish in case I have to go tomorrow.  Ohh- I have to take a Stats quiz...that should be ""fun."""

"event","Wow, life has really been crazily busy lately.  I can't believe how I haven't had a moment to breathe in about 5 months.  I also was hesitant to update my journal, because there was a question everyone was waiting to ask me- and I didn't know the answer to, whether or not I was accepted to the Schreyer Honors College- well after a month of waiting to hear...



I'M IN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I am so excited (geeked as Lexi would say).  I really feel like this is where I belong and that everything in the past year was meant to happen.  Wow, it has been a long time in coming- 10 fucking points never caused such a headache!  I can't believe all of the support I have gotten- I only told a few people that I was appealing and boy did the word spread.  

Work has been good, and bad, and trying, and well, work...I mean, I work w/ a former drag queen, which is always fun.  I mean, everything is just FABULOUS at the Macaroni Grill.  Come visit on a Saturday afternoon and you won't be sorry- Saturday Lunch is quite fabulous- even when Mon Raj gets mysteriously shy.

Can I make a brief comment on all of the drama that has been going on at school?  I am so glad that I am not involved- it has deffinitely made the final months of school quite interesting.  Give me some popcorn, this is NUTS!!!!!!!!!

Ok, what is Mr. Hageman's deal?  He has me do the program, and we've revised it like 10,000 times, he changes his mind if he wants to call this 5th grader a soloist or a vocalist each time, I've had 5 different versions just for that- seriously, fat bastard needs to just fuck off.  He was such a bitch to Becca at rehearsal last night and ripped her a new asshole.  Then, his rehearsal was going on forever, and he had his little Hills Girls sing, so Michelle, Ali, and I bounced and went to DQ.  It was so weird, because we used to go there a RIDICULOUS amount at the beginning of the year.  The new Mint Oreo blizzard is decent, but NOTHING BEATS THE DAVE SPECIAL (Medium swirl blizzard, w/ reeses peanut butter cups, snickers, and hot fudge on top for $4.25)  

Ms. Rossi stared at me in English today the entire period.  Apparently, she was trying to figure out what my shirt said, because when I stood up she started cracking up.  Boy does that woman have a crazy laugh!  Her porch was on fire this morning because her hasband was smoking and dropped his cigarette in the mulch- she was deffinitely just off the wall today. 

I will deffinitely be updating this a LOT more in the future- I am just exhausted.  I don't think I've gotten a decent amount of sleep since January and it's really starting to take its toll.  I am moving towards delirium.

Side Note- Tennis in Gym KICKS ASS!!! I make everyone grunt, because tennis sounds like a freakin porno!  Ruskie loves it!  I mean, I miss Pilates and Buns and Thighs, but this is just kickin!"

"event","Okay,Okay,Okay- I've brought back my live journal.  Yes, I know you're all orgasming, but you really need to calm down!  Dave has a live journal :) (insert Theresa voice) OH MAN!

Well let's get down to business (to defeat- the HUN- hehe Steve and Lawrence W.D. Greco)

Well, well, well- Friday night Julia and I hung out and I totally kicked her ass at the Entertainment Weekly 90's Quiz!  Some people should really learn not to compete against me.  You would think that after training with me in diving for 7 years, in which I slaughtered her each and every day, she would learn not to tell me to bring it, but oh well!  She met a bunch of my coworkers at Macaroni Grill, but told them she was a bad Grace.  Victor was quite apalled and told her ""Honey, that's not Cute! (I'll have to do the voice for you, it's not the same)

Okay, so Saturday morning I left for Penn State for the NCAA Gymnastics Regionals!  I first went to Allentown to pick up Adam and his friend Christina.  I wound up running into Debbie Vander White from Park Ridge which was so cool.  She stared at me for about 10 minutes before realizing exactly why I looked familiar, minus my new and improved fabulous hair!  So we drove in the car for 3 hours to Penn State- it would've been shorter but Adam doesn't know his way around fucking Allentown.  Adam proceeded to tell me the story of his life, which took all of 116 miles- ok it didn't take that long since I was driving :)  I mean, I was going with the flow of traffic, at a casual 85- Pennsylvania drivers are awesome, FOR THE MOST PART, this dick-faced asshole was tailgating and high beaming me and I was going 85- so Adam and Christina flicked him off, which really scared the shit out of me because the guy was an asshole.

So we get there and I wanted to get our picture taken at the Nittany Lion Shrine, but Adam had to pee like the queen he is, so we didn't get to take our picture:(  I guess this means I'll have to visit again!  So I finally got to see the University of Georgia live, after what like 8 years now?  Contrary to popular expectations, I was cool, calm, and collected.

But HEARYE,HEARYE...
I spoke to Sierra Sapunar! Not once, but the entire meet!  Everytime she walked past me she would talk to me!(we had fantastic 2nd row seats).  I've been OBSESSED with her for forever.  She really talks to you as if she's known you for your entire life.  Sierra couldn't get over how Carson and I were friends and her biggest fans.  I was introduced to a bunch of team members and it was all good.  Marie Fjordholm looks really cute in person- so stop dissing her!  Also, I got Cory Fritzinger on tape freestyling to Jump Around and immitating Robin Williams!!!  Hehehe

Georgia rocked the meet as expected, but one of the highlights was deffinitely the people behind us videotaping Christina, Adam, and me singing and dancing to Fighter!  They were blasting Xtina at a gymnastics meet- it does not get more fantastic I tell you!

I stayed over at Muhlenberg after driving back anothyer 3 hours- because Adam had to get us lost for another 1/2 hour.  I really just have to do everything- he will never be allowed to be the directions bitch again! We heard Kimberly Locke's new song WAAAAYYYYYYY too many times. His friends were deffinitely cool- Steve is the shit!  I mean, did you know that when you're eating any food w/ red dye- you're eating the blood of the Coccoidea?  Hehe- I also learned a bunch on inappropriate insect facts =)   I've never seen anyone more chipper when someone wakes them up!  Adam and Steve were totally rocking the bunk bed below me- and they claim to just be friends....rrrrrriiiiiiigggggggghhhhhhhhttttttt

So then Sunday night I went to hang out with Dawn for the first time in forever, and what happens....my starter breaks on my car!  So I had to get it fixed and have my Dad come and Jump my car.  THANK GOD it didn't happen at Penn State!
I seriously would've cried.

Yesterday, I played Senor J-Dawg Narin in Triopoly in a 4 1/2 hour match!  3 levels of Monopoly- what WERE we thinking?!?!?! I was winning for part of it, actually for a good portion, which really sucks that Jimmy cheated and won, but I'll have to deal!  We're so vicious when we play, but are always sure to at least be fake nice to each other whenever My Immortal is playing.  J-Dawg is the lover of my life- despite being a prick for beating me.  I love how my mom asks Jimmy the most uncomfortable questions- everyone make Jimmy as uncomfortable as possible- it's so much fun!  

Then I hung out w/ Mike and we watched American Beauty, which was really quite hysterical.  His cat saw a mouse in the kitchen and nearly killed both of us, but it was deffinitely memorable.  Afterwards, I went to the casa of the Elizabeth Atwater, and drank tea with the Brady family.  It was fun times as always....God, they are NUTS!

This morning I went to get a blood test and almost fainted- which is always fun.  At least I didn't, I can maintain my dignity- Lease men don't faint when they get their blood taken, only the pansy females in my family!  My mom even faints when they take my sister's blood- WHAT THE HELL!

Well I'm off to go help T give Sky a make-over.  This is going to be fantastic!  Sky is gonna be a REAL GIRL!  OHHH MAN!

Love me and love my brand spanking new Live Journal!

(oh and if you're a loser and don't know what Dendrobates means- it's a Posion Dart Frog- hence the icon- it's a joke w/ Mr. Shields)"

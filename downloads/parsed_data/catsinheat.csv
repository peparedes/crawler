"event","back in federal way for the time being and i'm kind of sad that i'm here. i don't know. yakima has never been my home but why do i feel so acutely uprooted? federal way still sucks as much as it did before. i know everything i write in this thing is angsty and largely insignificant but i don't think i've ever been so consistently, unrelentingly disenchanted. i'm not suffering or miserable or anything by any means. i'm not content either. i don't know, it has nothing to do with the place because i'll bitch about that regardless. yakima's fine. federal way's fine. this place is fine. the weather's nice. the taco bus is pretty rad. people are equally dicks here as they are back home. i'd say i'm used to it. but there's something small and nameless but TOTALLY THERE that's throwing me way off balance and i don't know what to do about it. i'm constantly depressed and lacking energy and i take everything way too personally. often i feel taken for granted. i just want this part of my life to be over with because it's making me resent the people i love and it's making me dislike myself more and more for giving in to ugly sentiments.

in any case, i'm moving out early. i've already called the landlord and arranged to have my name taken off the lease, so i'll probably be leaving late may to early june. and after that, my summer is pretty busy. i'm going to see my sick grandmother in korea for a while and then i'm going to paris to study. PUMPED.

on a much happier note, josh came to visit with a couple of his friends over the weekend. it did more for me than i think he realizes. also, i've made some pretty concrete plans to move to (south?) seattle with von and some other people in early to mid september. so fuck yeah."

"event","i kind of feel like i've moved to a different planet. maybe it's just the climate/terrain, which should be trivial, but it feels a little like having been plucked from one hemisphere and tossed into the other. but i guess essentially wherever you go the people don't change much. they smile at you in check-out lines and honk like bastards when you fail to stomp on it 0.5 seconds after the light turns green. sometimes i can forget that i'm out of touch with everything. i mean, i'm not miserable here. i'm just uncomfortable, like wearing a pair of half-size-too-small shoes. i can distract myself from it for a bit but that gouge in the ankle is always there. and i'm pretty sure amara has gotten sick of me bitching about it.

i overeat, i space out, i'm paranoid, i'm sad and i want out. i just don't know what or where 'out' is. i don't want to keep running in circles.

once i find a job (i am going to punch whoever told me finding a job in crackima would be easy), maybe meet some new people, i'm sure i'll feel better. for all my melodramatic whining, the bottom line is that i'm just not adjusting quickly/well to a town i'd barely even visited before moving to. apprehensions aside, six months is a long time, but i really do intend to make the best of it. no, really.

- four day long trip to new york. there was a lot i didn't get to do, dealt with a lot of frustration (i refuse to travel with my sister ever again), but dude, it's new york (ie my new favourite place). it was so unfathomably cold i got brain freeze just walking against the wind. 

- somewhat forcibly ejected from my home so i spent a few days couch surfing and several more days vegetating at amara's house. i spent half of christmas with her and her sister (returned to my mostly extended family briefly to hold a memorial for my mama), and spent new year's with her and alex.

- new year's was interesting. not bad-interesting. different. mostly walked around for a bit, listened to freezepop and gangsta shit in the car, went to gasworks park and dicked around. felt unexpectedly melancholy. entered the year with no parents, a decaying relationship with my only remaining immediate family, just turned 18 and now i am suddenly responsible for my actions.

- in the meantime, i am back at my sister's house, cleaning up and getting my shit together. i'm hoping to move to tacoma with amara in late jan/early feb so i'm pretty excited about that. i'm taking this quarter off, so i wanna get settled in a new home/town, read more, write more, paint more, draw more, take more photographs and try to remember things really aren't that bad.



<b>my more frivolous new year's resolutions</b>:
<b>#</b>eat more healthy :'(
<b>#</b>stop biting my nails
<b>#</b>get a job >:o
<b>#</b>um uh cure aids

<small>i promise this year will be as good as i can possibly make it.
there's too much i never said to you and it fucks with me every day.

my father's funeral was a while back. it was small. don't ever fucking use bonney-watson, they will fuck your shit up. seriously. i felt like laughing at my own dad's funeral, it was THAT pathetically organized.

school is violently shafting me. i seriously have no plausible hope of passing anything this quarter because i suck at the whole ""actually-attend-your-classes"" deal and i have no one to blame for that except myself.

a little less than a month ago, i met someone who makes everything around me a little less disappointing. it's a big deal.

in a little less than a month, i will be moving out. we'll see how that goes.

and we are so fragile,
and our cracking bones make noise,
and we are just,
breakable, breakable, breakable girls and boys



i don't really know what to think about anything, anymore. a significant part of my life has just died, literally, and nothing has changed in my day-to-day life. it's surreal and kinda scary. it's so fucking unfair, i don't even know what to do with myself except whine and give my only remaining family member a hard time and be a self-absorbed, self-pitying, self-indulgent punkass. and there's no way in HELL i'm fucking graduating. 

r.i.p. mom, 

r.i.p. dad,

someday i'll have the balls to not make a huge fucking joke out of everything you've ever worked for.

"event","it's pretty silly that i'm writing this all in LJ. my mom died on christmas night. her name was kyung hee lee, she was 48 years old, and she was shot to death. she was found in bed, in her pajamas, so maybe she died happy.

i'm so unbelievably thankful that we at least had a nice christmas with her before she left us. 

i went to her house to clean up, and it was so surreal. the bed was gone, a big chunk of the carpet was gone, and half of the 'eggshell' wall was painted stark white. i went through her clothes and found a big wad of toothpicks in one of her coat pockets. she was cheap, and we always teased her about her habit of stealing toothpicks/napkins/chopsticks from restaurants. she never bought toothpicks. i saw the toothpicks and started bawling like a bitch. 

mom mentioned that she wanted to be cremated and scattered over the ocean. she talked about retiring and just traveling the world, after i had gone to college. she loved to travel, even if it was to the next tiny rural town twenty minutes away. 

she also said that if/when she died, she wanted the house to be kept the same, untouched for a year, just in case she ever wanted to come home. we are going to do that. 

she had breast cancer, and she had just finished with her chemotherapy. she was growing her hair back, and it was so soft. she talked a lot about how she was going to cut/style it when it finally grew back. when she died, it was short and curly and covered the nape of her neck. the cancer didn't take her, a bullet did.

i called t-mobile and asked them to save her voice mail greeting, because it's the only recording we have of her voice. i called her over and over again, just to hear her speak again. 

i dug through her old albums and found her baby pictures, high school photos, and wedding photos. it was the first time i'd ever seen them. i wish she could have showed me.

king 5 came knocking at our door. they asked us to tell us our story, and promised us that the victim would be honoured: not just another death, another statistic, a nameless face. we told them we'd decide later. we still don't know.

her funeral will be next week. 

i still need her. i'm only 16."

"event","so i think i've made up my mind about what i'm gonna do next quarter. i'm not gonna be here. i'm going to go to seattle with zach, if he decides to go.

i can't stay in pittsburgh. not when you can get crack up the street and heroin outside your door. i can't do it. the other night, zach's roommate and all his friends were rollin' face in zach's room. it was funny to watch and remember, but then i noticed that alot of the kids in the room were 1st quarter aip kids. and i was like ""wow...that was totally me 2 quarters ago. stupid and all fuckedup."" 

yeah, i've moved from ecstacy to heroin and now to nothing. but still, it sucks to be around everyone all fuck'd up. me and zach either chill in the building in his room or john's room or we leave and go to buck's or somewhere else. there's no point in chillin outside when i got people coming up to me, asking me if i wanna split a bag or roll or trip or something. i'm happy with my weed thanks...and copius amounts. but i can't handle all the rest of the stuff, no matter how much i like it. 

me and zach sat down and talked for a long time, last saturday when i got back from ohio. i decided to get a bag and i felt so bad about hiding it from zach that i broke down and told him. he wasn't mad,  just scared for me and i promised i wouldn't do it again. its been a week now, and to some, thats not alot of time, but to me, its good progress, damnit. and zach's proud of me too, i know it. because he's all i've really got in pittsburgh, and if i fuck that up, then what else is there.

hopefully, this time next month, year - whatever - i wont be here. in fact, i refuse to be here. because i'll die if i am."

"event","summer break hasn't really been relaxing. its been horribly stressful and full of tears and no zach at all because he is in seattle.

i realized that this quarter, i fucked up way more than i ever have on a completely differently level than i ever thought that i would see. it'll all be over after this week, sadly, but that's how it has to be. my aunt wasn't joking when she said ""when you go back to pittsburgh you'll have a different attitude.""

i will. and i will be awesome this quarter. not the people around me, not my situation - me. and it'll be so rewarding.

zach's in seattle with clay and his other friends, looking at resturants to work at and places to live. he said he found a place and they need another roommate *wink wink nudge nudge*. yeah i most definitely would leave pittsburgh and go to the Seattle Film Institute. because pittsburgh is a hellish place with good times thrown in for good measure.

""this city's a vampire she eats her kids - lets' hide the bodies under the brdige"" and ""when angels fall, they fall in pittsburgh"" seem to be the right quotes. ha. 

i will say this much - it hurts to be this much in love. i miss zach's eyes. i miss his hands. i miss his voice, his real voice, not the distorted sound that comes through the phone when he's in seattle, in a different time zone.  i love it when he whispers ""i love you"" in my ear...i can't wait to see him again.

he said he got me some more oil! but not patchouli this time - amber i think. if i get the money together for his birthday, he'll get his bong and it'll be sweet. 

he told all his friends i resemble rosario dawson *thanks to john and everyone else* and now he says he can't watch Sin City without getting all sad. aw... :)

ok. its late, i havent taken a shower and i need to go smoke a blunt with my main man marc - yeah..."

"event","its been an interesting week.

i had quite the re-awakening with my mom which was awesome because we're so much closer because of it. i think thats really cool that i can talk to my mommy like that. i hope it stays that way. 

thursday night was fucked up - things happened, not to me but to others, that shouldnt have happened and those responsible will pay for their actions. because that's a fucked up thing to do. for sure. luckily, all present parties involved seem ok and thats what counts.

my weekend was incredibly slow - it was so bipolar is was ridiculous. i didnt really want to talk to any one and any attempts at making me feel better simply made it worse. but i'm better now, shits getting straightened out and i'm happier. i'm sure i wont find true happiness, not at 19 and in pittsburgh, but im getting there and it feels awesome.

it was nice to have zach come back from ohio. he said he missed the smell of patchouli and he hated sleeping alone. that's pretty cool i'd say.

yesterday, me, john and zach went to an all you can eat KFC buffet, granted i dont eat meat, it was funny anyway - john and zach stuffed themselves w/ chicken and mashed potatoes and gravy for a good amount of time - then we went to barnes and nobles and it was awesome because it'd been too long since i'd been surrounded by books like that. i love the smell of bookstores.

hopefully the weather will get better soon so i can sit outside and read w/ a blunt - cuz the weathers been fucked and i've been inside all the time, usually in my room alone or in zach's room, both of which get old fast. ha. 

bring on the nice weather, june. bring it on."

some people are going home for the weekend but im staying in town. im sure the weekend will have some tricks up it's sleeve. saturday night, i may decide to go to kayla's and party - apparently there are going to be mad people tripping. goodtimes.  tonight, zach's taking me to a fish-fry at his friends house - nothing like fish, vodka and white rhino to get the weekend started right, yeah? i suppose - im not really in the drinking mood, and im pretty sure the vodka was bought for me - oops. i'll eat my fair share of fish tho - and smoke that white rhino. :)

its been a good week though. the other day dave came by and me, belinda, james and sam went to his place out in crafton, smoked a blunt and watched Leminy Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events. i sorta missed most of the movie though. my big brother was attacking me with vicious lies about zach and his admiration for midget porn. huh?

everett and dave both hung out w/ zach and me and mitch and sam yesterday though : everett and zach in the same room - how's that for slightly uncomfortable but really funny at the same time.  

western civilization is sucking my ass at the moment. and im thinking about dippin' out early - Meena won't notice, the twit.

friday nite, zach took me to the walnut grill in shadyside and it was so good...and expensive. i felt special. :)

saturday night i was gonna stay in but we all decided to go to the party on the southside. we get there and zach calls
zach: are you there?
me: yeah. where are you?
zach: at allegheny...tripping my face off.
me: fuck you! that's so unfair!

lucky for me, the acid got there after zach did and i got a hit and he took another. and we geeked out the rest of the night - it was fucking awesome. i tripped from 11:30 pm till at least 5pm the next day.  we watched natural born killers and i damn near lost it in my head. it was amazing. rashad was fucked up beyond recognition and it was hilarious.  buddah's tripping tonite and zach said he might again. i doubt i will - i'm still recouperating from saturdaynite/sundaymorning!

but anyway, the weekend was awesome but now im stuck w/ this god-awful cold and i just wanna go home and go to sleep....

HELL YA! cuz he's mine now! he asked me to be his girlfriend last nite before we went to sleep..and i happily accepted. :) he's so adorable.

friday nite, dave came by and visited with his cousin and a friend of his and me and belinda and sam and zach all went to the fountain to smoke a few bowls. i was RETARDED. then me, sam, belinda and zach sat in belinda's car and chiefed some more. awesome. 

then me and zach almost got peed on, on the way back to his building. then i went to his room, smoked another bowl, went downstairs grabbed some beers (i was retarded, zach was drunk as fuck) and came back up to listen to a whole lot of interpol.

zach's so cute <3  that was an AWESOME nite.... AWESOME. :) 

we were supposed to get some liquid acid from one of zach's friends but he didnt come through, so me belinda and sam decided to roll instead : yellow smileys. smacky as hell but great as fuck. the three of us has the most awesome time walking around PNC park during the game, catching a few fireworks and SAVING A MANS LIFE!

belinda saw someone fall into the water and we were JUST starting to roll. we walk up and we're all like ""whoa!"" theres a guy holding onto the sides of the warf, in the water. he was riding his bike and fell in. i grabbed his arm and so did another lady and i kept asking him if he was ok. i had the eye wiggles like a MOTHER FUCKER but i was cool. eventually, belinda got a security guard or something and we helped pull him out. it was insane.

but it was an awesome nite. and the guy at sunoco was like ""wow i wanna go to the party YOU GUYS just came from"" we just stood there and smiled. wow. and the next day, everett buzzes our room and invites me and belinda to smoke a blunt. awesome.

we called josh morrow and he was tripping balls: apparently elise has acid. but so does dave! and maybe zach's still getting his liquid - PITTSBURGH'S A PSYCHEDELIC MESS MAN! ... and its awesome. :)

aight, its hot as fuck today and we walked to school, even tho we didnt have class. but its alright.  we're gonna sit in the grass again and get another tan. awesome.

i never finished my homework, on time anyway. but i got it finished. i didnt do my digital image manipulation homeowkr though because my teacher goes too fast for me and i dont know photoshop that well and its too late to drop the class ( THAT blows - ah well )

our room is kickass and comfy and my school aint that bad - aside from the three 8ams i have this quarter (!). but thats ok, i think its something telling me not to fuck around too much this quarter because on 3 out of the 5 days of the week, i gotta get up at 6:15. and my classes are alright, except for Western Civilization, which sounds horrible. my Film Survey class = awesome. Maietta teaches it, and i've had him once for scriptwriting and have him for Video 2 this quarter - he's a great teacher.

the weather at the beginning of this week was AWESOME. it made it really summer for awhile and i'm loving every minute of it. its finally sunny.

this weekend, belinda and i might be going home to go to my friends house for his birthday ... or something. all i know is that theres supposed to be mad amounts of alcohol and, when me and belinda get there, mad amounts of weed-smokage.  that'd be great.

speaking of mad weed smokage, i've been smoking ALOT this week - and its great. its made my week so much better. and on top of that, i got offered an oxy and didnt take it. i wanted it so bad though - but i didnt. and why - because this quarter is going to be awesome. ive coined ""awesome"" as the word of the quarter. but anyway, i've been smokin' mad weed. good weed. and i bought that cookie off of elise - which is was great enough to to STILL talk about. :)

things are alright right now. and thats great. and focusing on the now is whats up. fan-fuckin-tastic."

my weekend was alright: saturday i sat around lazily with tory james and ben and watched as people came and went to and from market square wasted off their asses. then we went to cvs when on the way back we saw nate, grant, mike and brandon. grant was kind enough to let me chug some of his whiskey which gave me a NIIICE buzz for a while. then dave called and took me tory james and ben to his place to drink the 2 cases of PBR he'd bought. then we went to zachs place, smoked weed-age and then i left w/ leah sam and katie for TACO BELL! it was the BEST meatless nachos bellgrande and apple caramel empanada i'd EVER FUCKING HAD. i was so hungry/stoned/tipsy. goodtimes.

sunday was lazy, except for the walking to jesse's and vinny's w/ Dre Dubz to help him w/ his ""cat man"" skit. i did come home to shrimp and rice, a tuna fish sandwich, cookies, and perogies and french fries - talk about binge eating.

so hopefully today will be ok, even though i have another class at 6 oclock.

i dont remember what i saw, but i know i could hear footsteps. and the footsteps where scaring me. and they wouldn't go away and it was dark. i was screaming so loud but all i could see what dark and hear sounds. people outside of doors and people walking. it was so disorienting. and when i tried to scream again, i screamed ""wake up! get out of here! get out!""

and i opened my eyes. and cried.

i want to go home right now. i dont like being in allegheny. i try to get out whenever i can. 

i talked to someone on the smoke deck when i got to school today about how fucked up pittsburgh and everything in it is. i talked about leaving, not school completely, just starting somewhere else.

if i can get all my financial shit taken care of, see if scholarships and loans roll over to another Art Institute, i might try to make next quarter my last quarter. i want to get into that house or where ever life decides to put me, live there and get my mind out of allegheny then go. the thought of being here for 2 more years scares the hell out of me. AIP classes arent like they should be and im tired of paying X amount of money to learn shit. that is my main concern. 

i came to AIP with this big dream. and everyday, they're shot to hell. i wont get anywhere if i stay here. im pretty confident about that. 

i just have to show my parents that this isnt the place for me. and if i go somewhere else and have to pay my own way through college, then so be it. i'll do what it takes to be happy.

i'm sick and tired of all of this stupid bullshit that shouldnt be an issue in my life but is. sometimes, i wish i was back at home, with my parents and my brother. just hanging out. relaxing. not giving a damn about anything. i've been trying to give off a happy vibe lately but it aint happening. i want a downer and im happy i dont have money to get any. this BLOWS MY ASSHOLE!

on a *happier??*  note, i left ben's valentine's day gift on his bed and i suppose he got it. he called and i missed it and i called him back and he didnt pick up. whatever. i'll stop by sometime and see whats up. i like him alot - i think a nicer sorta guy is exactly what i need right now. and someone not necessarily in our tight knit family. to say i want to escape is harsh, but it'd be nice to have someone to rest my head. preferably a shoulder to rest my head on.

so this week's been interesting, on the inside and on the outside. i've been thinking really hard about who i am, what i want to be, where i want to go from here. sure i'm young, but i know i'd find a certain sense of security if i had some idea what the fuck to do. but maybe i'm not supposed to know, im finding.

the acid dropping we all did the other night helped fuel that entire fire. i was thinking about shit before and getting really depressed about it: about my relationships with my friends, my parents, the world around me.

i found out that im a different person, since when i came here to AIP. and i think for the better. i've had a lot of firsts and i've also continued doing things that i know very well and make me comfortable ( ie. smoking with my best friends - hellzyah :) ). as a person i think i've grown. hell i dont even feel comfortable in my own clothes anymore, well not all of them anyway. that's weird.

i've met so many great people and they've affected me, undoubtly. i know that because of the people i've met and the experiences i've had thus far, i am a better and changed person than the indiefuck that i came here as.

this quarter hasnt' started out too well, seeing as how i decided to have this ""life altering"" thought process the same week as the first week of school. ive missed 2 classes already. that is not good. this quarter i <b>have</b> to make myself work harder. that includes outside of school - i applied at Outback Steakhouse and they called me for an interview (kids, keep your fingers crossed at 2:30 this wednesday). 

that's a good thing. i havent been doing as many drugs - also a good thing, depending on how you look at it :). . . no ones been on adderall for days straight, rolling out of their minds or doing oxys till it hurts. though acid has been a drug of choice lately - but acid comes few and far between, so i say take advantage if that's your thing (my rachel - hehe).

hopefully, rachel belinda and myself (and dani, if she decides to stay in pittsburgh) will find a reasonably priced house not too far from school and shit and we'll be happy. because that's all i really want. happiness.

i was thinking harder about what i want to do when i get out - and Twin Oaks sounds like a good place to be. it still needs more time to marinate in my mind but maybe.

i'm also considering transfering. when, i dont know. where, maybe seattle, san diego - im not sure yet about that either. i suppose we'll cross that bridge when we get to it.

i've been on a weird sleep pattern, trying to fend off the depression and trying to have a good time. so far i think im getting better.

im also infatuated with adam, who's really a hardcore dick and probably a slut - but right now, that'll do. i'm sure this will be over before you can say ""valentines day"".

ah. who knows wtf is going on. i hate feeling this lonely all the time. it sucks! ha. shit happens. and what do you do - take it in stride.

it helps you grow.

"event","i've gone inside myself for a while. i'll be back later. i guess.

i've gotta get a job. maybe Sonoma Grille. yeah...

some people bring back bad memories. because in <b>THAT</b> department, its hard to make new ones, apparently.

and my love horoscope for today:
<b>""Your natural caution kicks in when you're presented with something unusual in the realm of romance. Your wariness is warranted; make sure you're getting what you want before you sign up.""</b>

im being hellah wary. because im tired of jumping into shit too fast and sadly crawling out of it."

new years eve kicked my ass in the best way possible. me, rachel, dave, my friend erin, belinda, her two friends steudi and reid, brandon cleary and our collective souls went to rusted root.

oh my god. it was so great to dance like a hippie again (i hadnt done it in TOO FUCKIN LONG) and connect with the old man in front of us who was OBVIOUSLY fucked up - i soluted him. Tom's kicked ass afterwards and  chillin with rachel and steudi till we fell asleep - that was a damn fine time.

nick wasnt here though :( which was sad. but i talked to him on the phone RIGHT before 2005 came and i'm *smitten* hehehe...

im now at belinda's house in little Napoleon Ohio...and can i just say - NAPOLEON WEED KICKS MY ASS. i dropped $50 on some, in my opinion, bomb ass pot. jesus christ...maybe it was just me.

we didnt get to trip like we wanted to. lewis didnt get in contact with the guy - oh well. i was really looking forward to it to. but i'd really want rachel <3 to be there too...so maybe when we're all around, it'll happen. hellya. I MISS U RACHEL and i only saw you 2 days ago!

rachel mentioned Bonnaroo - i really wanna go. June 10-12 it said - hellya.

alright...im gonna peace out. i think we're going to the thrift store...or something...im sure i'll be imbibing some delish Napoleon Trees. im toking for you rachel - and dave!!

i wish it was little stupid petty insignificant things that i was worried about.  but for some reason, someone's trying to test me. trying to make me a stronger person through my surroundings. 

whatever it is, is kicking my ass hardcore. to the point of emotional breakdown. i need to go home for a little while and rethink where i am in life. in my short 18 years. thanksgiving break will be a welcomed break from pittsburgh, the people here and the its situations. i love the people here, and loving means you care and caring means your hurt. at least i've got that much down.

i hate to say ""i want friday to come so i can be happy again"". but its true. i do. maybe friday will come and i will change my mind. something tells me i wont. but it'd be nice to think that i did.

i miss my family. and akron. i want someone to care about me and make me feel better.

-the walk to southside included us running into the people coming out of the moe. show. a lady was selling pieces on the corner. so rachel bought a chillum. hell yeah. some guy was selling chocolate shrooms. we passed.
-tory and ben bought 40z at the gyro place and got all sorts of fucked up on the way to southside. tory doesnt remember what happened after crossing the 10th street bridge.
-party was alright. i got my beer for free (hellz yeah bitches) and we hung around for about an hour. tory got drawn all over and was severely fuckedup.
-we walked to tom's diner, helping tory all the way. tory made an ass of himself in tom's by being beligerent and out of sorts. it was hella funny though.
-the walk home included ben and tory wrestling on the lawn of the county jail, shattering a glass door, finding an old bike to ride home and then throwing it over the bridge into the river, and tory causing destruction in various places.
-we get home. andy calls for me and rachel from his balcony. he comes over and he and rachel roll on e for the rest of the night. i never go to sleep. neither do they. im the dj for the night/morning.
-im still up and but tired and rachel and andy are OUT.
-i just got a call from jesse for an invite to come over. so maybe, if those two wake up (and rachel cleans his apartment, as promised) maybe rachel and i will bounce across the city and chill for the nite over there. it was hella fun last time - sure to be a blast again.

alright. that was a recap if i ever saw one. damn fine one. its been a good weekend thus far. too bad its sunday and i cant get box wine. DAMN."

and then he said he felt really distant. that he felt like i didn't care anymore. and that he'd been flirting with other girls. and that he didn't love me anymore - but he cared about me. and that he thought it would be best if we took a break. but someone on indiefucks happily commented to my lamenting post by saying ""yeah - break is short for breakup"".

so i guess i'm single now. and there was a time not at all too long ago when i thought that this is what i wanted - to be single. but now that i dont have him, i realize that i want him back. i never stopped loving him. ever. i just got caught up in shit. i guess i got what i deserved. i dont mind him flirting or even whatevering with whomever. i'm no hypocrite.

but i really wish he hadn't said he didnt love me anymore....because caring about me isn't enough.

there was no Jager at jesus' but there was raspberry vodka, of which i had 4 shots, and a nice mug of Jack and iced tea. so i was nicely fucked up for little while.

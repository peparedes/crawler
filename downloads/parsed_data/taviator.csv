"event","so i think im changing my theme. dont drink that much anymore which leads me to not writing drunk in here that much anymore.  so its time to go against everything ive ever thought about this thing and turning it into a rant page.  so 2 nights ago i had a friend, or someone who i thought was a friend, tell me that i wasnt worth their time.  i didnt exactly know how to respond to it.  i know shes doing student teaching this semester which she says takes up ALL of her time, but i just dont see it.  and i know i could be called hypocritical, so i wish i had the chance to tell everyone im sorry for the way i acted when i had my spell of not talking to anyone, taking any calls, or letting anyone know i was ok.  because looking bad i prob could have done something to let everyone know i was still thinking of them and wasnt writing them off completely.  but thats the way i see now that im in the other persons point of view.  how do you not have time for a 2 min phone call before bed saying goodnight.  how do you not have time to drop an IM sayin ""hi, im a lil busy, but just wanted to say hi and im ok""?  we went from talking everyday, sometimes a couple times a day, to not talking for 2 weeks, then having a blowout in our last conversation.  which is rediculous again cuz all i asked for was her address to send a gift and she got pissed i wanted to send a gift.  now, my mom is a teacher, my grandma was a teacher, my aunts are teachers, i have friends that have recently finished student teaching, and some that are currently in it.  i know what they go thru, im not ignorant to that fact.  and i know all of them have time to say hi every now and then.  and NONE of them would say im not worth their time, EVER!  so i dont know if i should be hurt or mad.  but in either case, its still bothering me.  and i dont know as to if i should call her and confront  her on it over the phone (living states away), ignore her and just call the friendship lost, or just wait for the semester to end to start talking to her again.  somehow i feel like if i wait for the semester to end without talking to eachother, the friendship will disolve anyways.  i just wish i knew how we got to this point seeing as tho it changed overnight and wasnt a gradual thing."

"event","ok so ive settled a bit.  still havent resolved anything with anyone, but im calm.  sittin here in bed with my new laptop...SUCH a fan of this.  i can be comfy in bed and still do what i want.  but yeah anyways, this is the second year in a row my new years resolution was to work out and get bigger.  i had to make it again this year cuz i didnt even come close to attempting to do it last year.  but!  ive got a personal trainer this year and ive gotten serious about cooking and eating healthy.  it pains me to say it, but no more mcdonalds 8-10 times a week =0(  so i started training a week ago from yesterday.  i can finally straighten my arms and bend them completely without having to help them in either direction...def a plus.  but its going good.  i started this semester at 140.  then i started eating healthy and lost 2 pounds.  after weighting 138 last monday when i started working out, ive put on 2 pounds and im back up to 140 so i think its working.  if i keep working out and put on 2 pounds every week until spring break ill weight in somewhere around 150-154 pounds which would kick ass.  
today i had one of my classes for my second semester in my masters.  the class is called the air transportation system  and seems real cool.  and hes already told us we dont have class next week cuz he wont be there.  im lovin it.  i have my other class on mondays so my first time there will be next week.  ive heard good things about that class so just gotta wait and see.  my friend in DC won tickets to see Something Corporate and he wants me to go see the show with him but im not sure if i can afford that much time off and the money itll take to get to DC, just for a concert.  we'll see, i have until friday to make a decision.  i have a lot that i need to pay for so i kinda need to work.  gotta keep grocery shoppin and payin rent and payments on my truck.  and i want to put a 6 to 8 inch suspension lift kit on my truck which should run around 800 to 1000 dollars which is a pretty penny these days.
well my executive director fucked up again and he didnt get an aquatics director so it looks like ill have the position awhile longer.  im seriously thinking of asking for more money because i can make more lifeguarding at other places and not have to worry bout running anything.  but i enjoy workin there with most of the people.  especially the indoor staff.  and it fits my schedule really well so i think ill stick around there.  havent been beachguarding in forever but im thinking of returning REAL SOON!  (marci, u gonna come back and work with me some weekend???)  got offered a position back at the waterpark which im pretty interested in.  almost posative itll be a supervisor position which is cool, and hopefully worth some money.  
so all in all everythings going pretty good.  its a long one but i havent posted in forever....SO DEAL WITH IT! lol jk.  in anycase this bum is goin to bed."

""Welcome To My Life"" ~ Simple Plan

Do you ever feel like breaking down?
Do you ever feel out of place?
Like somehow you just don't belong
And no one understands you
Do you ever wanna runaway?
Do you lock yourself in your room?
With the radio on turned up so loud 
That no one hears you screaming

No you don't know what it's like
When nothing feels all right
You don't know what it's like
To be like me

To be hurt
To feel lost
To be left out in the dark
To be kicked when you're down
To feel like you've been pushed around
To be on the edge of breaking down
With no one's there to save you 
No you don't know what it's like
Welcome to my life

Do you wanna be somebody else?
Are you sick of feeling so left out?
Are you desparate to find something more?
Before your life is over
Are you stuck inside a world you hate?
Are you sick of everyone around?
With their big fake smiles and stupid lies
While deep inside you're bleeding

No you don't know what it's like
When nothing feels all right
You don't know what it's like
To be like me

To be hurt
To feel lost
To be left out in the dark
To be kicked when you're down
To feel like you've been pushed around
To be on the edge of breaking down
With no one's there to save you 
No you don't know what it's like
Welcome to my life

No one ever lied straight to your face
No one ever stabbed you in the back
You might think I'm happy but I'm not gonna be okay
Everybody always gave you what you wanted
Never had to work it was always there
You don't know what it's like what it's like

To be hurt
To feel lost
To be left out in the dark
To be kicked when you're down
To feel like you've been pushed around
To be on the edge of breaking down
With no one's there to save you 
No you don't know what it's like, what it's like

Of facing rainy days 
And somehow we survive 

We keep the feelings warm 
Protect them from the storm 
Until our time arrives 

Then one day the sun appears 
And we come shining through those lonely years 

I made it through the rain 
I kept my world protected 
I made it through the rain 
I kept my point of view 
I made it through the rain 
And found myself respected 
By the others who 
Got rained on too 
And made it through 

When friends are hard to find 
And life seems so unkind 
Sometimes you feel so afraid 

Just aim beyond the clouds 
And rise above the crowds 
And start your own parade 

'Cause when I chased my fears away 
That's when I knew that I could finally say

LONESTAR - IM ALREADY THERE
He called her on the road
From a lonely cold hotel room
Just to hear her say I love you one more time
But when he heard the sound 
Of the kids laughing in the background
He had to wipe away a tear from his eye
A little voice came on the phone
Said ""Daddy when you coming home""
He said the first thing that came to his mind

I'm already there
Take a look around
I'm the sunshine in your hair
I'm the shadow on the ground
I'm the whisper in the wind
I'm your imaginary friend
And I know I'm in your prayers
Oh I'm already there

She got back on the phone
Said I really miss you darling
Don't worry about the kids they'll be alright
Wish I was in your arms
Lying right there beside you
But I know that I'll be in your dreams tonight
And I'll gently kiss your lips
Touch you with my fingertips
So turn out the light and close your eyes

I'm already there
Don't make a sound
I'm the beat in your heart
I'm the moonlight shining down
I'm the whisper in the wind
And I'll be there until the end
Can you feel the love that we share
Oh I'm already there

We may be a thousand miles apart
But I'll be with you wherever you are

I'm already there
Take a look around
I'm the sunshine in your hair
I'm the shadow on the ground
I'm the whisper in the wind
And I'll be there until the end
Can you feel the love that we share
Oh I'm already there
Oh I'm already

And though I was only jokin' 
It took me by surprise when you agreed 
I was tryin' to be clever 
For the life of me I never 
Would have guessed how far the simple truth would lead 
You knew all my lines 
You knew all my tricks 
You knew how to heal that pain 
No medicine can fix 

And I bless the day I met you 
And I thank God that He let you 
Lay beside me for a moment that lives on 
And the good news is I'm better 
For the time we spent together 
And the bad news is you're gone 

Lookin' back it's still surprisin' 
I was sinking you were rising 
With a look you caught me in mid-air 
Now I know God has His reasons 
But sometimes it's hard to see them 
When I awake and find that you're not there 
You found hope in hopeless 
You made crazy sane 
You became the missing link 
That helped me break my chains 

And I bless the day I met you 
And I thank God that He let you 
Lay beside me for a moment that lives on 
And the good news is I'm better 
For the time we spent together

Im hesitant to say i question my faith, but rather i question the reasoning behind why such good people go early and there are so many people that are filled with hatred and evil that seem to make it through life relatively ""untouched"".  today has been a very hard day for me and i cant fathom how hard it is on the family members of my friends that have risen to Heaven.  its times like these that my friends shine through and prove to me how lucky i am to have such an amazing support group outside my family.  thank you to everyone who has touched my life."

Could go a couple ways now that i think about it.  the original intent was just for those thoughts to go out to her and her family, sparky, and any one of my friends really that needs someone;  i will be there for all my friends always to the best of my ability.  Could also be taken another way.  Even with Rachel in Heaven, she was a friend Here and will continue to look and smile down on us from Heaven.  Her friendship doesnt stop but goes on forever in our hearts and memories.  If we ever need her, all we have to do is call upon those memories and feelings and she will always be with us.  

Its hard for me not to be mad at God and question faith when i can see the light of a 19 year old girl burnt out.  Sometimes i think the only way i keep from breaking down is knowing that shes in a better place.  I think God realized the Angel she is and realized that such an amazing person should be in Heaven with him.  This world is so dark, cruel, hating, and evil sometimes that someone as good natured and loving as Rachel should be with what we often consider to be perfection; Heaven.  It leaves a hole in our hearts and lives.  She is in a better place now looking down on us all.  
And for all the love and caring and help she offered while amongst us, we all thank you Rachel and will truely miss you.  Watch over us all and keep us safe until we can join again in Heaven."

IM A COLLEGE GRADUATE!!!!!  yes thats right.  which brings a lot of emotions: happiness, sadness, accomplishment, regret, depressed, questioning, hope...and some more.  dont get me wrong it feels so good to know ive become a college graduate.  i think some people still drop out before finishing which is a real dissapointment.  u owe it to your parents, family, and mostly YOURSELF to finish, so thats where im happy with myself for finishing.  hell, i think im even gonna go for my masters.  seems as tho any business today almost REQUIRES at least a masters. all my friends seem to have left or are leaving which makes me feel kinda depressed and vulnerable.  just not sure how to go thru thins change of chapters somewhat alone.  theres still a few people around or comin back but in comparison to previous years this will def be a change.  and with people leaving ive found myself thinking of past friends a lot.  well we lost contact on good or bad terms doesnt matter.  i think i really wanna get in touch with them again if i can.  i think tomorrow will be a day of thinking how to turn the page instead of just sittin looking at the last page of the chapter and admiring its finish.  (sparky if uve managed to read this far, i may take u up on that running deal)  its time to find a job in the industry, even if its a low paying low status one.  need to network. i think if i get bored ill make this a part II tomorrow cuz im tired.  so to be continued..."

"event","no offense to either by this statement.  and im an outsider looking in so dont take it to mean all that much.  but what one did to the other, the other did right back.  both were/are confused why the other was/is ""hurthing"" them, but its more confusing to think how you both didnt see the hurt coming.  one made the other wait for one reason or the other which hurt someone.  when the person couldnt wait any longer for one reason or another it hurt the person that made em wait.  its obviously much more involved and when dealing with peoples feelings its never easy, but you gotta see where eachother are coming from.  both are very justified to feel hurt, but both are justified to feel angry as well.  like i said, dont take this for too much cuz im an outsider, but all the posts blaming people and making people feel bad keep coming.  i cant imagine its helping either side really solve any problems...whether that be help clarify the situation or simply save the friendship.  if yall want to talk ill always be here to listen....and i havent/nor never will judge.  but ill listen, and offer my opinion if asked for."

you and me together
The storm outside, the fire is bright
And in your eyes I see
what's on my mind
You've got me wild
turned around inside
And then desire, see, is creeping up heavy inside here
And know you feel the same way
I do now
Now let's make this an evening
Lovers for a night, lovers for tonight
Stay here with me, love, tonight
just for an evening
When we make our passion pictures
You and me twist up
secret creatures
And we'll stay here
Tomorrow go back to being friends
Go back to being friends 
but tonight let's be lovers,
We kiss and sweat
We'll turn this better thing
to the best
Of all we can offer, just a rogue kiss
Tangled tongue and lips,
See me this way
I'm turning and turning for you
Girl, just tonight
Float away here with me 
An evening just wait and see
But tomorrow go back to your man
I'm back to my world
And we're back to being friends
wait and see me,
Tonight let's do this thing
All we are is wasting hours until the
sun comes up it's all ours
On our way here
Tomorrow go back to being friends
Go back to being friends
Tonight let's be lovers, say you will
And hear me call, soft-spoken
whispering love
A thing or two I have to say here
Tonight let's go all the way then
Love I'll see you
just for this evening
Let's strip down, trip out at this
One evening starts with a kiss
run away
And tomorrow
back to being friends
Lovers...love...lovers
Just for tonight, one night...love you
And tomorrow say goodbye

"event","been doin a lot of thinkin bout the past lately...and the future for that matter.  mostly depressing but such is life sometimes isnt it.  looked back at my relationships and just wondered why they didnt work out.  all of them i guess i wish lasted longer.  some of them id like to get back into and some not so much.  then theres the people ya are good friends with that ya just never got the balls to ask out...yeah those you validate not asking out by saying theyre such great friends and ya dont wanna lose it.  thats really a stupid thing im realizing cuz i would imagine it couldnt get any better than always being with your best friend.  and id imagine thats what marriage is like but who knows.  this weekend has been like ""chick-flick-weekend"" or something.  on tv i watched the wedding planner and that movie with selma hayack where she sleeps with the guy one night gets pregnant and then gets married (yeah the name is completely escaping me right now, prob cuz its 8am and ive been up for bout 3.5 hours already).  then last night i watched serendipity.  all great movies (shh dont tell anyone i said that).  serendipity got me thinking that maybe there is this ""divine plan"" and fate is a working part of life. which makes me happy to  know that eventually ill find my soulmate, but is actually really depressing.  how do u excercize patience in waiting?  why would u honostly sit back and wait instead of trying to push fate along?  i dunno.  the birthday is comin up which makes me feel old and maybe thats the reason for all this.  all i know is id rather not do the whole dating thing and useless flirting but rather find my soulmate and settle down.  unfortunately all the people i would see myself with are all in other places than here...and where do i want to stay, here.  oh well, im exhausted and i wanna take a nap before my 1030 so im off. since it seems to be the theme lately for me, if anyone wants to watch a chick-flick give a call.  im sure ill be up for it."

"event","well its been 2 days since my sis left and i still miss her a lot.  i really wish i could get used to me leavin family or family leavin me.  it just seems that it only gets harder.  im 5 days away from starting my drive back down to FL.  im really excited to go back down and see all my friends  and im excited to move into MY NEW HOUSE!!!!!  there will be a lot to do for the house and my parents will be comin down for labor day weekend to visit and see the house and such so im happy bout that.  im onto my last few days of work and for as much as i hate gettin up to go, im gonna miss is so incredibly much.  i think this will be my last (6th) year with Poolwatch.  ive been with them since i was able to gaurd at 15 and ive know my boss the entire time.  ive seen gaurds come and go and i seem to be the only one that is a constant at the 2 pools i work at.  hell ive seen families leave out of the community that the pools are for.  people in there look at me as a son and i love them for it.  i couldnt have asked for a better 6 summers than what theyve given me and i will always remember them.  my boss invited me back next summer as a supervisor to relive pressure off of her.  she always wanted to be the one supervising the pools ive worked/managed cuz to her she calls them her ""babies"".  she said she hasnt found someone she trusts to supervise them until me.  now i couldve gotten supervisor earlier but ive always had to stay part of the summer and always came back too late to get the position.  i would love to work with her again and supervise those pools because i love the people there to death.  i wish i could say the summer with nic was as good as the summer with the pool but unfortunately i cant.  im still tryin to figure out how to say goodbye to her.  we're not exactly talking and im not leaving on bad terms....i refuse.  but saying goodbye is more than just sayin goodbye for the schoolyear.  its saying goodbye to a very large part of my past, and part of what i wanted my future to include.  and i guess that is why she was able to hurt me as bad as she did (even tho she doesnt know it).  its hard moving on, but as long as im moving on with so many other parts of my life, i will move on from her.  and i guess its time for me to move onto bed for the night.  ""its something unforgetable, but in the end is right.  i hope you had the time of your life""  good riddance - green day"

I just want to get it over with
Tears form behind my eyes
But I do not cry
Counting the days that pass me by 

I've been searching deep down in my soul
Words that I'm hearing are starting to get old
It feels like I'm starting all over again
The last three years were just pretend
And I said, 

Goodbye to you
Goodbye to everything I thought I knew
You were the one I loved
The one thing that I tried to hold on to 

I still get lost in your eyes
And it seems that I can't live a day without you
Closing my eyes and you chase my thoughts away
To a place where I am blinded by the light
But it's not right 

Goodbye to you
Goodbye to everything I thought I knew
You were the one I loved
The one thing that I tried to hold on to 

And it hurts to want everything and nothing at the same time
I want what's yours and I want what's mine
I want you
But I'm not giving in this time 

Goodbye to you
Goodbye to everything I thought I knew
You were the one I loved
The one thing that I tried to hold on to
The one thing that I tried to hold on to 

And when the stars fall
I will lie awake
You're my shooting star"

"event","so time is a very funny thing.  when youre happy you want it to stop ticking, but nothing you can do will stop it from doing just that.  and when youre sad and you want it to hurry up, it does it; only in a way you didnt expect.  so you chase the unattainable and soon the unattainable becomes the very attainable.  you want time to stop just so the moment never ends.  and then you leave for awile and u want time to hurry up which it does.  but little do you realize that because time hurried up, things changed in that time.  you come home and things are just WAY different then when you left them.  and it seems no matter what you do you cant fight time.  time has changed sooo many things that its impossible to get back to the way it was.  so you try to settle for what  IS instead of what WAS only to find out that youre just not complete.  i cant tell you if i like time or if i dont.....just that it happens.  the past is behind you; the future you cant see; the present is just that, a present, gift from God.  if ive learned anything its to enjoy the present because the future will come and u dont know what it holds.  and that great moment you shared will simply become the past."

(i wasnt ignorin all of ya, i really couldnt  open the livejournal page).  i know i promised meg and jax a call but i havent had a moment of real ""downtime"" to just sit and chit-chat.  and i owe sparky a clear cut answer on that lighter-than-air pilot qualifications question he asked me.  ill try my hardest to get to all of ya soon =o)  so on to a journal entry huh?......
short term memory is horrible these days but ill try to remember everything thats happened lately.  last week tues i got a call from my uncle askin me to do a favor for him so i say yes and that ill help him out.  he says being in the plumbers union that he needs to volunteer 1 day out of the year to the union.  so he says he was called to help them out and he could fulfill his obligation by showin up himself or have someone take his place (and can u guess?  yup, that someone was me).  he tells me i need to ""hold signs"" at a construction site and that id be workin from 6am-1pm.  he tells me that ill be given a vest to wear.  so i try to put 2 and 2 together and figure im gonna be that guy that holds the stop/slow sign up near construction areas.  he tells me to wear jeans and a t-shirt.  i have 1 pair of gym shoes so i decide to wear construction boots so i dont ruin the shoes with dirt, nails, and such found at construction sites.  im no fool, ive worked with him before and know what to wear.  so having to be meetin the guy thats directing me at the job at 6 i figure i need to meet him like 10-15 min early.  i wake up on wed at 430 shower and leave the house at 515.  made great time and got there early at 540.  so i wait around till 550 and the guy still isnt there!!!  so i get worried im at the wrong spot and call him only to find out that hes just about there.  im sittin in the middle of this empty parking lot and 2 cars pull up...one with a chick in jeans and a tiedie tshirt and gym shoes and the other with a man in dockers and a polo shirt.  then a third car pulls up and another guy in dockers and a polo shirt show up.  everyone gets out and introduces themselves and the 2 guys from the union look at me and say ""so i guess you havent picketted a lot before""  im like ummmm NO!!!  haha so im there in a pair of grungy jeans, a white tshirt, and my construction boots and my job is to hold signs picketting against another plumbing company not in the union.  so i stood out holding signs and wearing the signs on a vest that fits over my head from 6-1.  I WAS A WALKING BILLBOARD!!!  what a fool i felt like haha.  needless to say my feet, knees, and lower back havent felt that bad in a long time.  i went straight from th ere to my LG job from 2-7.  thurs i worked 2-7 then my buddy jack jones came to visit for the weekend from ohio.  friday was the 4th and we just hung around the house and swam and ate dinner with my fam and relatives that came over.  at night we went to see fireworks at the horsetrack.  they were ok but i realize every year that its always the same thing with fireworks...they all look the same.  came home and watched Signs.  sat we went downtown Chicago for the Taste Of Chicago which is this huge fare where a lot of restaurants come and serve tastes of their place (usually exotic foods on their menus that are unique to only them.  and a lot of the restaurants are places too expensive for most people to go to on a regular basis.  so we got there at like 1130 and started eating!!!! (one of my fav thigns to do these days)  ate for like 2 hours.  we had cajun alligator, ostrich burgers, pan fried shrimp and veggies, rib sandwhiches, beer battered artichoke  hearts, polish perogi, beef sandwhiches, and italian sausges.  then we decided to walk to Navy Pier which is like 2.5 miles north.  so we walk there and it takes like 45 minutes.  stayed there for a lil talkin and watchin a comedy/juggling show.  then walked back to the taste.  decided we didnt want to eat again yet so we walked like a mile west to the Sears Tower.  while in there jack asks who owned the Sears Tower.  i said i dont know who owns it now but it was originally owned by sears roenbuck.  like 15 min  later hes like ohhhhhh i get it, sears roenbuck, sears tower, ohhhhh i see.   and i laugh histerically for awhile lol  who wouldnt!?!?!?!?  so we go to the top and look out and do the ferris bueler deal with our heads on the windows leanin over the balcony.  finished up there and went back to the taste of chicago (some of what was mentioned earlier we had here, not then)   we watched sheryl crow perform for like an hour.  then had dessert at the taste.  left when it closed at 9, and came home.  my body ached so  bad that we lit the tiki torches around the pool, through the heater on, and had beers relaxin in the pool.  came in and watched Darkness Falls (great movie...go see it if you like horror films)  sun jack left after bfast and i relaxed with the fam the rest of the day.  at night went over to nicoles place for awile and had a blast.  also made a fool of myself but thatll have to be a diff post.  so its been hectic but fun.  lots of work on the schedule comin up but it means i get money.  sorry it was long...and it would be longer but i must jet.  talk to you all soon!!!!"

For a long time ive always said im not afraid to die.  theres no reason to.  death is merely a part of life.  if ya fear death, then ya fear life.  nobody died or is dying, and ill leave out where all this came from to save a lil pride.  but suffice to say it got me thinking.  every second is a precious gift.  not for one second should you feel that youre OWED life.  for as quicky as God gave it to you He can take it back.  and i know He has a divine plan, but where do I fit into it.  ive had a good life (at least id like to think...and i dont wanna complain but...) but what happened to my friends that i grew up with?  is it me or is it them or does it matter?  but i cant think of many if any that i keep in good contact with.  some of the best friends and times of my life gone bc i was either too lazy or just didnt feel like i completely belonged or who knows.  i dont know why theyre gone, just that they are.  even hs friends are few and far between these days.  you take pictures so you can always ""go back"" or ""relive"" experiences and have a good time reminicing.  now thats usually the case, but look from a different perspective once in awile.  time is ticking, and you cant take any of it back.  no matter how much you want to be back where the picture is, you cant.  sometimes pictures although meant to bring smiles to me, only bring sadness.  i thought going away to school would be the best thing in the world.  cept now the pictures of my lil cousins come months apart and they grow like 10 years in those few months.  hell my sister gets more mature everytime i see her.  i go home and everyone is older.  its a part of life.  except the more life goes on, the more limited time i have with my grandparents. and scary enough, the more limited my time is left with my parents.  death is always looked to be so far away but everytime i turn around a few years have gone by.  thank God i have my sister.  without her i think id be lost.  shes also my best friend.  and its selfish of me i know, but im glad shes younger and if things work out the way they should, i wont have to live without her in my life anymore.  its never right to outlive younger people then yourself.  and as long as i have her to share my time with im ok, but im still waitin for that special someone.  for all the good things that happen, theyre just not as good without someone to share your happiness with.  because for now i just feel incomplete.  i want to find that person that completes me.  that person that i spend the rest of my life with.  i want a family bad.  and i know im not ready for one now, but its somethign i want so bad.  i want to look into my kids eyes and know that nothing in the world could ever knock me down.  knowing that even if i lost everything, it would be ok as long as theyre in my life.  to live and share in their happiness and sorrows.  but until that day, ill live life the way i have been.  day by day.  thanking God for every second He gives me.  and thankful for the amazing family He gave me, as well as the great friends i have now.  for family and friends are everything.  as long as you have them, the rest is just details.  
i apologize for taking up peoples space on their entrys but im not sure how to make the entry just go on my journal.  and i just needed to get my thoughts down for myself.  for my friends who will eventually see this thank you for being you.  you mean a lot to me."

"event","well, with nobody here or to talk to, ill just talk to myself.  im so bored and alone.  =o(  i hate this feeling.  have you felt alone...like for more than one day.  its goin on a week now for me.  one of my roommates just got in tonight but hes still gone during the days for work.  so im alone all day, every day.  specially this last week when he went home.  i always thought itd be GREAT to live alone.  i dont think i could do it.  and all my friends went home too.  i dont even have people to come by and ""bother"" me.  i wanna jsut go home.  see my sis, my friends back home, my family.  ive recently been on a burnout schedule with all my flying, and classes.  and now im adding work into the mix.  ya know the feeling where ya just need a hug?  thats where im at now.  and yet im alone and know it wont happen.  at some point ya just wish you met that one special person that youre meant to spend your life with.  that person you can just hold and know everything will be ok.  someone where ya dont even need to talk with to be happy...just knowing theyre with you is enough.  on a different thought, id really love to take a year off to just travel.  cross the country and see every city ive always wanted to.  travel to exotic islands.  hike through europe.  spend st pattys day in ireland.  well after completely random ramblings, im still alone and still depressed.  well this journal thing isnt as theraputic as it thought =o("

"event","so i learned 2 things today at work.  no make that 3.  
1. i hate parents with kids under the age of 12.  you see everyone blames the kids, but they only do what theyre told to do and what told not to do...BY THEIR PARENTS!  when i tell them not to do something and the parents give me and them a blank stare they think its ok to do it again.  so i blow my whistle again for the same thing and again the parents look dumbfounded.  whats the deal here folks?
2.  you dont have to be intelligent or have any desire to be a lifeguard.  it amazes me at some people we have lifeguarding across the country.  WHY AM I ALWAYS SURROUNDED BY INCOMPETANCE!?!?!?!?
3.  ya dont have to be cute to be a female on the Canadian National Swim Team.  LOL!!!!!

well it was a long and interesting day nonetheless.  night flight solo went well.  i gotta just say i love daytona beach tower control.  yall are soo cool.  well thats it folks...just thought id update the ol' journal.  talk to yall soon.

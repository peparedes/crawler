"event","Well, I am getting engaged soon. Just a few problems though.  We went to go pick out an engagement ring, and decided to go to a custom jeweler.  Which was fine at the time.  We designed a kickass ring in CAD, and he made a plastic model of what it would look like, and they looked great also.  Then the problems started happening when he actually went to make the ring, it bears almost no resemblance to the model that he worked up, or the one that he cut out of plastic.  Now, here's the kicker.  First, he said that the ring didnt cost enough for him to take the time to fix it so that it looks the way we wanted it.  Second, when he was polishing it, he took a nick out of the ring, which guess what.  Would cost too much to fix!!! OMFG!  Third, he doesn't want to remove the stones that we had chosen, and just sell those to us.  Fourth, and this is what stings the most.  he went on a lecture about how a ring with those stones in it would easily sell for 3Xs what he was charging us. I dont fuckign care how much someone else would charge.  I want the fucking ring that we designed with the damned stones that we chose for the price that he told us we could have it.  I dont give a shit if the ring that he made for us isnt as expensive as rings that he has made for other people.  I dont give a shit about any of that, I just want the ring that he promised to make, with the stones that he promised would be in it, for the price that he promised.
Is that really too much to ask?  Am I at fault here for wanting a custom ring that looks the way I want it to?

By the way, this i sa rant that i probably should have posted last night when it happened, oh well.."

Second, if this is a free ride then I sure am gettign screwed.  So far I have put in $7,000 to this free ride.. So what i want to know is since when have i not chipped in any money..

I'm going to make some very very general suggestions Take them or leave them.

1) Unless you are going for some sort of E. E. Cummings effect, don't lowercase your eyes.

2) Always check your spelling. Spell-check loves being used. It gives it a sense of purpose.

3) Avoid cliched images and expressions.

4) Avoid unspecified prepositions.

5) Embrace your nouns and verbs. They are the skeleton and flesh of poetry.

6) Narrate less. Don't tell the audience what you feel or what they should feel. Instead, think up tactile imagery.

7) Revise, revise, revise. It's human nature to think in cliches, to do what's been done before, to say things that have already been said. The task of a poet (or any writer, really) is to get past that and invent new expressions. 

So don't write about bottomless pits if you can write about soap-lined sinks, don't write about aching hearts if you can write the feel of a thumb prodding your celiac plexus, don't write about changing the world if you can write about that time you vomited on your brother's new Nikes that time you had appendicitis.

8) Always be open to criticism, but **never take that criticism as the Word of G-d**.

Best of luck.

Will we fall to the bottom
Of the endless pit,
Humanity has created?

Why do they get to make all the choices?
Isn't this my life?
Why do they tell me what i can say,
When i'm the one who holds the future?

You think you know it all,
But you're selfish,
And you'll never know how it feels
To be totally free.

Dont repremand me. 
You know deep down i'll be the one,
Who'll change the world.
Not you and your lies.

As i stand looking out the window.
I came to realize,
Maybe our love can never be.

I never used to notice,
Just the little things you do.
But now, as i open my eyes,
I dont know where i am.

Are you the person i used to know?
I ask myself too many questions,
But does it hurt you,
To answer me for once?

Why am I this way?
I dont want this feeling to change,
But I dont know what to do,
Is this the end?

Tell me, are you the one for me?
I never used to second guess.

Well, now it's time to tell you about...

<lj-cut text=""my wonderful weekend"">

First, i had to get up uuuber early on friday, so i was really tired. We got to the airport by 5, got all checked in, and got on our plane at 6:30 like planned. the flight to san fransico was okay, not to bad. actually pretty nice. my dad had a fit about turning his cell phone off though.

But the flight from san fransico to portland was just fing scary. the aircraft made funny noises, it took half an hour to taxi out, and i had to sit next to strangers because my sister doesn't love me. anyway, we got to portland okay.

then we met my grandma and auntie at the airport. oh my god, my auntie got more and more annoying as the weekend went on -.- I just about wanted to smack her. she wants me to go up to her house for a WHOLE WEEK in august to SCAN PICTURES. >< damn it, no. I want to STAY AT HOME.

Anyway, then we got our rental car (a white van) and headed out to hood river, which is about an hour away from portland. it was really, really pretty up there, with all the trees and the river and how few houses there were by the road. rural. kinda scary, too.

well, we had to stop and shop for wedding prezzies, and then we drove up to our hotel. It was a best western, and very nice. all you had to do was walk out the sliding glass door and there was the river. You could sit there, looking at washington state on the other side. but it was funner to watch the wind surfers wipe out. 

anyway, so that night we went to the rehersal dinner, and it was really, REALLY nice. Way up in the mountains, secluded, and they had really good food. they had a bunch of hornets though. they ate my sisters chicken.

on saturday was the wedding, but my sister stephanie, and my sister in law allie and i all went to a spa for a full body massage before hand. oh my god, it was great. I have never, EVER felt sooo relaxed. mmm -falls over- 

anyway, the wedding was nice. there was no air conditioning in the place where it was, so it was hotter than hell, but it was pretty, with mount hood in the backround. my new sister carrie is sooo pretty. e.e her dress was gorgous. and the reception dinner was good too. and the cake was awesome. xDDD

anyway, today, we had to get up at 8:30 because my grandma and auntie had to be at the airport by ten, even though their flight didn't leave until noon. well, after we dropped them off, we went and ate breakfast, and i had the best omlet of my life. four cheese with tomato, yummy.

anyway, then we got gas and went back to the airport. got out bags checked, but since our original flight wasn't until seven, the lady put us on stand by incase they could get us on an earlier flight. and they did

we left portland at 3:25, and i had to sit next to this girl who smelled like kimchee. now, if you've ever had kimchee, you know how bad it smells. anyway, i had to live with that until san fransico. 

once we got to san fransico, they were able to put us on the 6:25 flight, and we got home at 10 to 8. so i got home about 4 hours before i was originally supposed to. YAAAY!

</lj-cut>

Well, that's about it -falls over- I'VE MISSED YOU ALL SO MUCH. GIVE ME LOVES.."

I didn't go to bed until after 3AM last night, because i was talking to atashi no kento.

I woke up this morning around nine, and then proceeded to wake my mother up. We then went and picked up my nephew (I had to babysit) before coming home and making some blueberry muffins, yummy.

Then we went to sam's club, and just kinda walked around. Didn't buy much, because my okasan was tired. ;-; poor lady.

went and picked up my other nephew after that, then came home. My mom and the boys went swimming, but my kento was on before he had to go to work, so we talked for a bit. (I GET TO CALL HIM TOMORROW! YES YES YES YES YES! I miss him so ;-;)

these tears fall, 
but i cant smile,
and pretend that i'm okay.

seeing you smile,
holding your hand.
all i can think of,
are those moments we spent together

now you're gone,
and i can't make the pain fade.
no matter how hard i try,
these tears wont stop

i need to see you again,
Feel you hold me close.
I'm sorry that i'm not perfect,
But this distance is tearing me apart."

I dreamed about you.
Just standing there, 
Holding my hand.

Sometimes,
I feel like i'm about to disappear.
I need reassurace,
That I'm not alone.

As the years pass me by,
I promise I wont forget.
You're the best thing i've ever known,
How can i give you up?

And when I'm too old to remember your name,
A part of me is always with you.

I know, 
I'm never alone.
As long as i can see you smile,I'll survive,
No matter how feirce the storm.

Falling back into my memories,
I find myself happy,
Remembering all the good times,
When you've held me, and i'm safe.

Never will I forget,
You or the dreams I've seen.
Us together, forever.
Friends until the end.

And when we're too old to see,
We can always smile at each other in the darkness.

I promise, I'll never forget."

How I can survive,

All I can see is shadow.

Wonder,
Why I linger on, 
taking over all the light,
just to see others in misery.

When the sun goes down, I run away.
Dont let the light catch me, not yet.
Just let me run away, 
To a place where I can't see you."

Knowing that this is the end.

Maybe this is all just my dream.

Inside, I'll always be happy to see you.
And no matter if the sun is shining,
There's nothing funner than the rain.

Sitting with you,
Talking with you,
Loving you, 
Being with you.

All my dreams are coming true.

Thought life has grabbed me by the hand,
I'll always be by you.
And no matter what happens,
There's always a rainbow after the storm.

When the sun goes down,
Will you stay and dream with me?
Even when there's no light to see,
We'll always have each other.

Friends, Forever.
Never letting go.
Forever, be my friend?
You mean so much to me.

At last, my dreams are coming true

Math is one of my least favorite subjects and so my attitude entering the class is, ""blah"" and it reflects in my work.  I am just grateful that I only need one to satisfy my major requirements.  I have two papers due by Wednesday, one final and this semester is over.  This was my first semester at a 4 year institution and I now know that homework is a part of the curriculum. I have to manage my time better for the grade and quality I expect.   Yippeeeeeee......summer is coming."

As I watched the news, I just thanked the Lord that I was in the place that I was at the time this destruction took place. We truly have to live everyday as if it were our last because it could end for any of us at any time. My prayers go out to the families affected by this evil deed.  God Bless."

"event","The presentations presented on yesterday were interesting. It's amazing how you never really pay attention to things or find importance in them until someone points them out to you. Presentations generally have me on edge. Although I am nervous about presenting, I do feel a sense of ease knowing that Bill is allowing us to be rather relax and informal.  When I know at the beginning of the semester that I have a presentation coming up, that is all I can think about. My nerves just build and build and build.  Once I am up presenting, I sort of loosen up.  I had this presentation in one of my health classes where I lost my place and was unable to recover. I kept apologizing. It took everything in me not to run out of the classroom.

I am due to present Tuesday.  Hopefully, I will remember all that I want to say."

"event","I have chosen to do my last English essay on the housing development in a small area of Detroit.   The area around I94 and Conner seems to be dwindling away as each day passes. There is basically no upkeep to the neighborhoods. There are contractors building new housing throughout the community. Who is going to maintain these homes.  Who is going to provide education and financial literacy for the people moving into the homes. The community would benefit better if in addition to the new homes the contractors provide some type of incentive to keep the surrounding owners or tenants living in dilapidated homes from completely allowing their neighborhoods from becoming eyesores.  Otherwise, the new homes will begin to look like the old ones in no time at all."

"event","This community is located near I94 and Conner Ave. My parents moved to this area over 7 years ago. At the time, it was considered a nice, quiet and safe neighborhood. The block club has ceased to exist.  The security bars have been placed on windows and doors.  The landscapes are all too often covered with paper and trash.  The community has fallen apart due to the lack of involvement from the residents.

My parents have filed several complaints concerning this hole. It has been in front of their home for about 3 years.  The city removed a huge tree from the curbside because the roots were beginning to clog the sewer. This nuisance is the result.  Maybe they should call ""Problem Solvers""

I don't think these tires can be picked up with bulk trash. Whether it be the homeowner or the tenant, someone needs to be held accountable. The city can't do everything.

In other cities, the bulk trash is picked up once a week along with the regular garbage.  What gives?  The next scheduled day for this neighborhood is May 5, 2007, and this will not be picked up because it is not curbside.

The mentality and behavior of the people in the neighborhood should be addressed. By teaching them how to make home improvements and how to keep the block clean would be more of a community makeover than building new housing.

I was walking through a park in Warren located at the end of my block.  I looked down and spray painted in giant red letters was ""KKK"".  I immediately felt a sense of hurt.  In this day and age, it is really sad that people still harbor this type of hatred in their hearts. My neighborhood has become quite diverse in the past 3 years that I have lived in the area and it just baffles me that racist discrimination still exists.

The discussion we had on Tuesday concerning the shock value of photographs prompted one young lady to comment on Lindsey Hunter, or should I say ""some black kid"" and I thought her choice and tone of her words were quite discriminatory and insensitive."

I, of course, drive to another pump, swipe my debit card and the screen reads, ""see attendant."" I swipe my Visa and the screen again reads, ""see attendant."" Pissed off, I think to myself, ""if I wanted to see the friggin' attendant I would have gone inside in the first place.""

Except one particular day, I wanted a caramel frappacino so bad and could not find a Starbuck's.

Although I know that it is often more costly to rebuild than to restore, I feel there are millions of dollars spent everyday on frivolous things when it can be used to help restore the city, because there is nothing being done with the abandoned buildings once they are torn down and it just makes for an eyesore.  The debris should at least be hauled away.  I'd rather look at a big empty field any day than to drive down the street and see a newly built house or business with a vacant and dilapidated piece of property on either side.

I am an African American female who, while growing up, had a mother who often made me feel like I was the most important person in the world.  She would say to always strive for the best and don't allow what others do and say to influence your actions and behavior. She always made sure to tell me she was proud of me.  The story offers so much more than the role of a black mother.  It gives insight to how detrimental effects a home without love and nurturing could be to molding lives. How communication with family gives strength and courage.  My mom, had very little education, but she made sure to instill in my sister and I the value of getting one.  Fortunately, I never experienced the lack of attention, care and love that only a mother could give.  To this day, when I visit my mother's, I feel so safe and secure knowing that her home is the one place where I am loved unconditionally.

Ms. Hooks mentions in her story the phrase ""sexist domination"".  My dad, like so many black fathers, was not in the home, so women had no choice but to step into the role of being the father figure."

"event","As I read this story, I couldn't help but feel somewhat emotional about how Detroit has become somewhat of an eyesore.  I'm not aware of all the history, but from what I do know, this is where Motown started.  Detroit is known for producing some of the best singers and musicians in the world.  But no one really brings recognition to that anymore.  Where are the commercials advertising the Motown Museum?  I moved to Detroit about 16 years ago and the area where my family owned property now looks like a war zone.  And we, like so many others, moved outside the city. Herron's argument is basically that the historical venues of Detroit are no longer appreciated like they once were.  

What Herron meant by using the word pastness, was the history of Trapper's Alley, how it's represented by bricks and brass, the building material of choice during those years that was considered quality.  These are items that can withstand time.  

The nostalgia for history is simply longing for what was once so respected and appreciated.

Detroit is the most humiliated of cities in Michigan because there are vacant buildings lining the blocks that were once so vibrant with life.  As residents relocated to the suburbs, low income people began to move in.  If there is no money to keep up the properties, then they generally fall by the wayside.  It's so obvious that Detroit was once one of the most affluent and more preferred cities to live in."

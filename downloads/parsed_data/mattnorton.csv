I get to say what I want to those assholes with no concequence(is that spelt right?). Their Steak and Cheese Sandwhich is still mighty tastey though. Even if they are a bunch of cunts. Oh well.

I start school in two days. Oh well. I'm pretty damn bored... I'm as ready as I'm gonna get to go back I guess. I need a hair cut.. I'll get one tomorrow.

so right, nothing has really happened this summer. It's over. I got a job at McDonalds... fired 2 weeks later for something I didn't even fucking do! My goddamn-stupid-ass-pussy-eating-no-good-shitty-mother-fucking-dick-munch register was 30 bucks short. And I got fired because of that. Fuckers. Fuck em'

Next on the agenda: I'm going to school! What the FUCK?!? My parents assume I'm gonna graduate, and instead of breaking their hearts again and telling them I still don't plan on graduating, I'll just do it. It can't be too hard. Hopefully.... I got credit for most of my classes though.. partial credit. But next summer I'll take a few summer courses, and make up whats missing. This is all assuming I get into the boces program this year and stuff.. if I don't, my entire highschool career is going straight to hell.

Other News: yeah. I guess. I've been pretty happy. This next school year intimidates me though. I hope I can do it. Personally, I think this medication has done nothing but nothing. Pfff. Oh well. I guess I have problems about taking the medication though. It's wierd... like... when I take it. I think ""why"". It's suppost to make me happy. No one in my family has suffered from chronic depression except my uncle, so I doubt it's hereditary. I think I'm just running from my problems. I take the pill and it's just like... it feels like all my sorrow and sadness and all that fun stuff is just made worse by myself, and I have the ability to repair it myself, but I almost don't want to or something.

I'm ranting... I'll try to stick to complete my summer activities now...

let's see, I went on vacation with my family and smoked a lot of weed. Went to Muse Fest- smoked a lot of weed. Drank some, had fun. Met people. Next time I'll bring more than 2 t-shirts and a bathing suit though. SOOOO FUCKING COLD!!!

I think everything else is covered I guess... grassroots and everything else before that has been written about already. I'll probably write in this more now that school is starting. More insecurities and stuff that I thought you might wanna hear about.. heh. Tata"

I wonder if these people suck in comparison to the rest of the world. Heh. I think of some funky shit when I'm stoned. I'm not stoned now, but I was yesterday. It was the first time in awhile that I fully enjoyed being stoned. It was so relaxing. Except for this crazy guy who was taking to us. I think he was trying to pick me and rudy up. He was drunk and was asking us what our signs were and shit. Heh. Oh well.

1) I hate the people who say we should give this land back to the indians, and stay right in the same fucking spot.

3) I hate people who say they're so lucky to live in America, but also say America is so fucked up.
4) I hate people who find lesbian sex kinky, and jerk off to it on a daily basis, but would kick the shit out of a gay couple if they saw one.
5) I hate people who tell me that if I don't graduate high school my life is going to suck, even though all that matter is that I'm happy, and I can be happy without a highschool diploma
6) I hate every person I see walking down the street who don't actually know how foolish they look wandering around their daily stupid activities and bullshit.
7) I hate myself for knowing I look just as stupid and not doing anything about it.
8) I hate people who bitch about how littering is so bad when if you throw it away, they're just gonna burry it anyway

Okay, first I sat them down and said that I needed to talk about school. I told them that I wanted to go to TST next year because I wasn't the least bit motivated to do any work this year. They started to get pissed at me. Exactly as I thought they would. I wanted to convince them without having to tell them everything, but it didn't work as well as I thought it would. They said that they needed more reasons and that it wasn't that much work and all this crap, and they just kept working more and more out of me until I said ""I just don't see any reason to do the work. There's no reason for me to put forth any effort when all I do is try to please everyone when I'm just gonna grow up and die.""

Then my mom flipped. She started crying and started to hug me, and by that time I was already crying alittle, but then I started to cry more. She said that she was mad at herself for not noticing and shit. I felt bad. I told her I wanted to see a therapist, and that I wanted to talk to Haya and then I went and took a shower. Tomorrow I'm not gonna go to school. She's gonna call Stu(her old therapist, and my old therapist), and she's gonna call the school and tell them that I probably won't be finishing the year.

I feel so bad for my mother. I have never once seen her cry in my entire life. As for me, I've cried more within the last 2 months than I have within the last 4 years before that. This really is getting to my head."

If I fuck up, it's not gonna be because I didn't get my highschool diploma. My plan was, even before I stopped going to school was to go to TC3. If I get my GED, I can get into TC3 just as easily. Some people think that school gives me more ""dicipline."" I have very little dicipline when it comes to doing work. That's why I'm failing so bad. I didn't learn. I can do the work when I'm motivated, but if there's no reason for my to do it, then why should I? My goals are all too far off for them to motivate me enough to matter. By the time I go to college, I'll have a much clearer view hopefully. At this rate, I would of been in highschool for 3 more years. Fuck that. I can't do it. I need to get out and relax.

There's one major problem though. I'm 15. I can't yet. I didn't go to school today. I stayed in Dewitt Park all day long with Ariel and Evan. I can't stand public school. Now that I don't have to worry about any of bullshit work, I feel soo much better. My plan has 2 elements that I'm aiming for. 1) Take a class @ boces next year, and then get certified in computer tech. Doing that, I can get paid 50k a year with out even going to college. 2) Get my GED, and go to TC3, later to transfer to a more respectable school. I really don't need my highschool diploma. All it's really there for is to back me up if I fail horribly, and I don't think that's gonna happen. I thought about this for a long time, and this is my decision. I still gotta tell my parents though. They're gonna be piiiiiissed off. If I explain it to the the right way, they might not be AS pissed off, but it's inevitable that they're gonna try to change my mind. I'm gonna tell them Sunday, because by then, I will actually of failed one of my classes for sure. The other 3, very very close. But I don't have the motivation to pass them. There's no need for me to. Oh well... I feel ALOT better about myself. See what happens with my parents..."

We called Rudy's mom, and she said she called my dad, and that he didn't know that I was in Philly(cuz I lied to him). Then we went and got Cheese Steaks, and Dolph bought a cd. We started to leave, and it was pouring like all-hell. We stopped at a gas station, and got directions from this guy, and started to follow them. On the way, we got a flat tire because we hit a pot-hole, and then we switched tires as it started to rain. We continued following the directions for like an hour, and then we realized that we were in fucking New Jersey. We were in the middle of the bottom of the state. So we started to drive north, and got to Princeton before dolph was too tired to drive. We found a parking lot next to a park, and decided to sleep there. Of course the parking lot was next to a volunteer fire department, so an alarm went off that scared the fucking shit out of us. I was really worried about my parents, cuz they didn't know where I was, and I felt really bad, so it took me forever to get to sleep. An hour after I got to sleep, cops woke us up, and started to question us and see if we were run-aways. They left, and told us we couldn't stay there. It was 3 in the morning now. I went and found a phone and called my mom and told her I was in NJ. She was really really worried about me. I felt sooo bad the entire time. We continued to drive north through NJ until we got to Andover... we slept there cuz dolph was really tired again.

When I was in 4th or 5th grade(I don't remember) I remember I would look at my brother's porno mags. I would look at the girls in the magazines, and think ""wow, she has nice breasts"". And then I saw a picture of a girl sucking a dick. For some reason, that turned me on alot more than the girl did... I didn't know why though. My brother would always look up porn online, and I decided to look it up too, you know, that thing little brothers do to impress their big brother in an odd sort of way. I looked up ""XXX Ameteur free"" or something like that. I started looking at pictures of all these asian women.. I liked it sorta, but it didn't really turn me on much. Then I accidentally came across this picture of two guys cumming on themselves. I popped an imediate hardon. I decided to look more of it up, but wasn't succesful. I figured that it was just a phase, and that when I hit puberty, I'd be set straight(pretty bad pun..). Well, time passed by, and I hit puberty. My plan didn't really work. I just found myself even more attracted to guys. I made a deal with myself. I decided that I was going to be straight until I was 20, and then I would decide wether to be gay or not. I still didn't get it yet that that was who I was. I didn't want to be gay. I wanted to have a wife, and kids, and to be... normal. I thought that I could never have kids, because if I did, they would just be made fun of at school. By 7th grade I knew it. I found myself looking up gay porn again and then it just hit me. I AM GAY. There's nothing that I can do about it. I didn't want to be gay, but that day when I finally stopped denying it, I felt so much better about myself. In 8th grade I was really desperate. My best friend rudy, I thought that he was gay too. I would basicly just watch him.. trying to pick up on every single action he did that might signify him being gay. Then when he started talking about women, I just told myself he was covering it up... just like I was. In 9th grade, one of my ""friends"", Jonathon Ward was really really homophobic. He always would say shit, and I would defend ""the gay people""(I tried to make it sound like I wasn't just defending myself), while he said some of the stupid shit I've ever heard. I switched to ACS half-way through the year. It was like a salvation. I met alot of people who were alot more understanding than people from IHS. One day online, I told a friend of mine Sally. I was so nervous when I told her. I was afraid that she'd tell everyone. Even though I knew she wouldn't. I started telling people one by one. All of them were online. I didn't have the guts to tell anyone in person. I still wasn't comfortable though. It was like, no matter how many people I told, there was still another old friend of mine I had to tell that I really didn't want to. To this day, I still haven't told alot of them, and probably won't. I could tell that alot of them didn't really like me anymore. Jonathon hasn't said a single word to me after he found out. Another kid, Josh Bennet actually said ""Eeew, I used to sit next to that kid."" It wasn't that I was afraid of losing my friends, it was just that I was afraid of being disliked by people as a whole. And I was. I ended up telling my ""ex-girlfriends."" One was almost out of revenge. I still haven't told alot of people, and I don't even see the point anymore. I tell more and more people, and then I hear some cool new kid I just met say ""That's gay"" about something, and I just think to myself ""Here we go again..."" They usually find out eventually, because all my friends have really big mouths. I guess this will probably never end.."

I have nothing wrong with myself liking men. To me that's natural... it's second-nature. But gay. That's what everyone else calls me. I hate it. It's like I'm sick, or have a disease. Every single time I have to tell someone ""I'm gay"" I feel like I'm hurting them. Like I'm telling them I'm gonna die soon. I already came out to my friends, and my parents, but still.... every time I meet someone new I have to tell them. I wish I could wear a flag or something, because I hate meeting people knowing that I'm gonna have to tell them. No one understands it. No straight people atleast.  And there is always old friends I forgot about that I used to hang out all the time with in my straight days. Whenever I talk to a straight person about someone, I feel so wierd. I know that even though they're trying to be supportive, they just don't understand. So I feel like they think something is wrong with me. Straight people always take that security for granted. It's not about how the KKK would kill me if they could, or how the kid down the street called me a faggot, it's about the people I know."

If I explained to them why I did it, they would label me insane. I would be ""insane"". Which do you think would make someone ""insane"":

1) Living in a world of complete bullshit, saturated in society, economy, materialism, and not questioning it at all 
2) Realize that this world is false, and trying to free yourself from it all.

Woah... I just realized something. I have these two parts of me debating something, and there must be something making the decision. I wonder what the third part is? Anyway, I think both sides are right... I think that I am a coward. Because parts of me are still connected, like my materialism, and need for entertainment. Yet I lack responsibility, goals, direction, dicipline, etc. I neglect it because I can. I don't neglect the others because I don't want to. But at the same time, I shouldn't have these responsibilities. That isn't what we are here for. If life really is ""God's"" skirmish for twisted entertainment, I wonder what I would parallel to be in a real war. I'm guessing I would be a cameraman, or something useless, because I don't have the proper training, or because I wouldn't fight for something I wasn't proud of.

Humans entertain and distract themselves because they don't wanna face the fact that all they're gonna do is get laid and die. They mate so they can have offspring, which will do the same damn thing. Personally, I don't believe in God, but if there is one, they are one sick twisted fuck. It's like a skirmish; put a whole bunch of things in one spot and see who comes out on top.

I drew a vivid mental picture of the teen center in my head. I started to question wether the teen center really was what I thought it was inside, and wether I had actually been there before. The only thing that says I've been there before is my memory, so if my memory changed, how could I know wether anything else changed? Sometimes I completely disconnect from the world because I feel that when I wake up, I'll be a different person. I'll live somewhere else and look different.

It's about the question ""why"". You can ask yourself that questoin about anything, but if you do keep asking, you'll hit rock bottom. There will be no answer. Behind every structure, thought, person, or anything imaginable, there is no answer. It's an oasis of questions that can't be answer, and I feel like I'm drowning in it. I can't find logic in anything. I fid myself questioning reality all the time. Sometimes if I buy something, or have a vivid image of something I ""know"" exists, I'll check to see if it's still there, because I'm just not quite sure. Maybe reality is instable? Maybe things get... forgotten. It sounds stupid, but if you think about it, nothing you know can truely be justified either. Sometimes I feel like everything I know is bullshit. Man-made details we grow on, filling tiny pinholes on something much greater I'm blind to. That is all I consist of is fucking details. Details that serve no purpose. And that is when I wonder who I really am. I don't know. I don't think I ever will. I can just hope that I'll forget. There's is nothing real in this world other than ignorance.

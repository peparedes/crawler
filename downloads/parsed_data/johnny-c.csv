Those that may have looked in the last comment thread could see that IRL caught up with me and beat me about the head and shoulders with a rather large stick called depression and responsibility. (Perhaps I didn't mention the stick but it's true nonetheless.)

Also, responsibility involved with playing this character where he must interact with the other characters in this RP got somewhat overwhelming. I'm not the most social of creatures personally even on the best days. <font size=1>(Anyone else see a parallel here? No? Oh well. Moving on.)</font> And, on-line video gaming became more fun than on-line RPG gaming.

I'd hand the character over to someone else that would ""do him justice"" and ""interact with the other characters more"" but when it comes down to it, I'm selfish and I might once again need this journal for releasing anger issues.

I did write out more posts for the RP thread I'd started those months ago and if I ever find my notes again, I'll have to post them as I'd intended.

Thank you for reading and I guess I'm at least a small bit sorry for not living up to the expectations of regular posting but I do have a life and it tends to run me over if I don't pay attention to it sometimes.

LIVE FEED</marquee>

A camera fades from darkness into light. The dingy interior of a room brightens into sharp relief after adjusting to the light from complete darkness. With jerky movements close to the ground, the camera begins to move further into the room.

The room is a living room of sorts. Moving around a wooden crate, the picture reveals a couch, ripped and torn, upon which an unmoving figure sits. It seems not impossible for this person to have been sitting here for some time. Discarded cups formerly housing brain-freezies and empty fizz whiz bottles lie forgotten around the silent figure.

Profile reveals dark hair and wide, staring eyes. A hushed voice, presumably not in the room declares, ""That's him. Johnny C<i>sss</i>... S<i>sss</i>... Johnny..Something. Someone spilled coffee on my report!""

The camera jerks down slightly. His clothes are quite wrinkled suggesting further that he has been sitting here for a while. An empty brain-freezie cup is clenched in his hand, perched on one knee.

<font size=3><b>TIME PASSES</b></font>
<font size=1>in which nothing happens</font>
He simply sits there. The frame might be in fast forward. Or it might not be. The person is unmoving so one cannot tell for certain.

But suddenly! Movement! His eyes flick up and narrow as if to better see something off camera. Again, the hushed voice presumably not in the room returns with the vocal equivalent of a stretch. ""Hey. He moved. Hey wake up. You-..."" The voice trails off into silence which lasts for three spans of a moment, before
""OH MY DEAR GOD!! AUOWGhlfs<font size=1>s...</font>""

And then silence once more. The camera frame jerked violently during this time before settling into stillness facing a wall. The recently moved figure at one side. A suggestion of a door frame at the other.

Slowly, he rises from the couch to peer quizzically in the direction of the suggested door frame. The empty brain-freezie cup dangles forgotten in his hand. Halting steps, as though he can't quite make the electrical connection between brain and legs to send the order for movement, carry him to the center of the still frame...where he pauses, still with the quizzical look on his face.

""Pnehk dra xiaah. Dra Xiaah! Yd mycd cra ryc ynnejat du ybbayca dra Dindma Kut! Dra Xiaah ryc lusa!"" makes its seemingly nonsensical way into hearing. The person in the center of the frame looks only more confused.

""Dra Xiaah! Dra Xiaah!"" fades into distant silence. Perplexedly, Johnny turns to resume his sentinel state on the couch, only to pause as his eyes spy in the direction of the camera.

His facial features grow larger during his approach to the camera. It is apparent from the upward point of view that the camera is still near to the floor and the <i>person</i> has crouched lower and lower with each step. The view of the room behind him changes as he retrieves the camera from the floor and then straightens.

Delightedly, he smiles a smile that must surely be genuine and true. He says softly, ""Why hello there, Mr. Samsa. I'd been wondering about you...""

Johnny's face and the picture behind him roll in unison for a brief half-moment before all is again dark.

Then, static...

"event","Last night, I went to the Super-We-Sell-Everything.

I had to get...socks. Yes...socks it was. It was socks.

I also wanted to see if they carried turtle food but that's something I'll write about another time.

I was looking at socks.. And this woman.. <i>This</i> woman.. <b>THIS</b> woman..felt the irresistible urge to creep up stealthily behind me and scare me.
<h1>""JESUS FUCKING CHRIST!""</h1>
-was my reply.

...

Not only this. But then she insisted on wrapping her arms around my mid-section from behind.

...
....
.....

Indeed.

I do not like being touched. SOMEONE needed some enlightening education on this fact because SOMEONE lacks proper knowledge of respecting personal space.

My first instinct was to bash my elbow into her nose and slice her across the throat. Both combined into one neat, fluid movement.

Then, I stopped myself before I drew my knife. Her nose bleeding freely, I apologized and stepped into the next aisle.

I keep forgetting. First you <b>TORTURE</b> your guests.
Painfully.
Then once they know what it is to truly be alive. <b></b>THEN you expire them.

Perhaps if I put it here, I will cease forgetting.

Allow me to explain this no-touchy-thing.

To touch someone is a very intimate gesture indeed. I do not much like being touched by the people I <u>DO</u> know. <font size=1>(Er..didn't he kill them all?)</font>

...Well, except perhaps for..but no... No. No... <font size=1>(I won't send his brain <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/devi__d/"">there</a>. It's not a happy place.)</font>

I do not like being touched by mere acquaintances. <font size=1>(...Again, those he <i>hasn't</i> killed?)</font>
I fully <b>loathe</b> being touched by complete strangers. Even those brief, unavoidable touches one is inflicted with in public crowdy-places.

To have someone, a complete stranger, wrap their arms fully around my body is nothing short of the kind of torture that has the tendency to induce projectile vomiting on my part. It was my instinct to retaliate by smashing my elbow into her nose which then proceeded to bleed freely.

Her nose desired attention. Yesss...

After re-grouping in the next aisle, I then kindly escorted <b><i>this</i></b> woman out of the Super-We-Sell-Everything and into my house. Hardly a fuss.

I have spent some time recently modifying the phone-device. It is now equipped with knives again instead of the gun which was previously attached. It now projects the student forward, who is strapped into a rack-like-rigging-thing toward a wall of knives.

Only it stops.

The student receives the rush of adrenaline causing the heart-rate to speed, blood to pump faster, and endorphins to release even into the extremities. Over and over and over... For it stops you see. The student never quite knows, but suspects each time, that <b>this one</b> will be the last one.
The last precious lung-full of breath.
The last feel of air across the face.
The last blood-curdling shriek to pass over the vocal chords.

A randomizing agent with a manual over-ride keeps things interesting for me. This way, I never quite know which time will the THE time...and if the student carries on too long and too loudly, the manual over-ride fixes the problem terminally.

I've never...written of it in here, DEAR DIE-ARY, but I have a switchboard-thing with electronic impulses received from various THINGS in my house and it is currently connected to the knife-and-rack-rigging-thing that <b><i>this</i></b> woman is strapped into. I do not believe I have mentioned it before to you, DEAR DIE-ARY. <font size=1>(That doesn't mean <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/johnny_c/friends"">they</a> don't know about it.)</font> I attached the THING connected to the phone-device to it just in case no one calls...


I remember now. I forgot to get the turtle food. Fuck. This means I'll have to go back..."

"event","The 24/7 was mysteriously closed yesterday evening. I had to go elsewhere for caffeinated beverages. The next closest place was a Super-We-Sell-Everything.

They had no Cherry Brain-Freezies but they did have Cherry Fizwiz.

Once I had gotten my Cherry Fizwiz, I set off walking back home slurping it with glee.

*slurp*

On my way through the parking lot, there was a ""scene.""

Oh no. Not my ""scene,"" dear DIE-ARY. Someone else's ""scene."" Two some ones' ""scene"" actually.

A young man of a certain age and a young woman of a certain age were having a ""scene"" in which the young woman of a certain age was indignant about the fact that the young man of a certain age had been seeing someone else while he was seeing her.

The young man of a certain age was baffled in an orange t-shirt as to her non-understanding of his need to sow his wild oats. As it were. And became indignant on his own part in regards to her non-understanding.

I would have continued walking, but they were blocking the sidewalk with their ""scene"" in loud voices. Even through my headphones loud.

*slurp*

The young woman of a certain age stormed away after the obligatory crying part of the ""scene."" The young man of a certain age resumed his work at the Super-We-Sell-Everything where he pushed the shopping carts.

Sort of.

*slurp*

The young man of a certain age had this wonderful tiny red car-machine that pushed the cars for him while he directed it with a remote control. An ingenious device indeed.

*slurp*

He had wandered off to do SOMETHING. What I do not know but I do know when I saw him again, he had a flushed caste to his skin and deep purple roundish marks on his neck.

But I didn't see him again until after I had a talk with that wonderful tiny red car-machine. Oh a wonderful whirring, clicking, REMOTE CONTROLED-device it is. It resembled a miniature version of Christine of Stephen King fame it did. I simply had to have it for my own.

*slurp*

The machine had something it needed to attend to first so I resumed my walk home. The walk was uneventful. My Cherry Fizwiz slurping and CD-listening pleasure was, for a change, not interrupted by the dregs of humanity that insist on inflicting their presence on me.

*slurp*

I had been home for a small while when I glanced through the wooden slats boarding up the windows and saw the wonderful tiny red car-machine-Christine-device trundling around happily in my front yard.

It was splattered with some mysterious red substance that seemed strangely familiar to me... <font size=1>(Oh no. Really? What mysterious red substance would our boy be oh-so familiar with?)</font> ...and had bits of orange cloth caught in its gears.

*slurp*

It seems I have a new pet. It followed me home."

This gallery showing.

I went to this gallery showing.

For the past..while..my artistic talents haven't been what they used to be. I am loath to confess something like this, even to you DEAR DIARY, but it is true.

I would have gone with a friend. But I have none.

I couldn't see bringing Reverend MEAT to something like that. His sly, sibilant speakings would have ruined that lovely showing.

Nailbunny would have made a good companion there. Walking amongst the paintings and the sculptures. Sharing our thoughts to each other... But then, Nailbunny <i>was</i> just another voice in my head out of my head. So going alone was like going with him I guess.

I wandered looking for my lost inspiration. My errant muse.

In a way, I suppose I found <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/devi__d/"">her</a>.

Dearest Devi was at the art gallery showing too. I saw her and stood stunned for a time with a wrench in my gut like a live crab, trapped and angry, struggling to get out. How much time, I have no idea. Time has little meaning anymore.

It could have been a few seconds.
It could have been forever.

I wanted to speak to her. I wanted to tell her in person how sorry I was and then reasoned that perhaps we'd already said all we needed to say to each other. Providing she listened to the recording during our last phone conversation... <font size=1>(I use terms loosely, no?)</font>

I had nothing more to say to dearest Devi so tried to resume looking at the pieces. Everywhere I turned though, Devi dearest was in front of my eyes. Or was it her image imprinted on my retinas? I had..have no way to truly tell.

I went outside for a breath of air. It didn't help. My brainmeats were pulsing and pounding in a bid for freedom.

Even when I stood up to leave the curb I had sat down upon, when I looked in the window, when I took one last glance at the art on display, there she was.

I had thought I had successfully killed all feeling I had for Devi dearest but this latest venture into the outside world decidedly disproved that.

My head hurts.

<u>A Night Like This</u>
<font size=1><i>words by Robert Smith</i></font>

Say goodbye on a night like this
If it's the last thing we ever do
You never looked as lost as this
Sometimes it doesn't even look like you
It goes dark
It goes darker still
Please stay
But I watch you like I'm made of stone
As you walk away...

I'm coming to find you if it takes me all night
A witch hunt for another girl
For always and ever is always for you
Your trust
The most gorgeously stupid thing I ever cut in the world

Say hello on a day like today
Say it everytime you move
The way that you look at me now
Makes me wish I was you
It goes deep
It goes deeper still
This touch
And the smile and the shake of your head...

I'm coming to find you if it takes me all night
Can't stand here like this anymore
For always and ever is always for you
I want it to be perfect
Like before...
I want to change it all

I want to change"

I finished it. The FINAL FANTASY-thing.

I sat in reflection, thinking back on the experience I'd had, when Reverend MEAT spoke again. His incessant haranguing and needling drove me out, OUT, <b>OUT</b>!!

Driven from my house by a figment, I was..not happy. <font size=1>(Is he ever?)</font> And in my..not-happiness, there were those that added to the..not..happiness.

I spent some time walking and visiting favorite places of old. The bookstore isn't the same without Devi there to talk to. I stood outside the window..like..I..used to do and there was this man. This man told me I couldn't stand there. This man insisted that I move on. This man WAS SPEAKING IN A CONDESCENDING TONE OF VOICE!! I did not appreciate this man.

Truly, I did not fully appreciate him. It was much too quick. The death it was. It's one thing to remove someone's appendages individually. It's another to remove them all at once. <font size=1>(He has a special machine for that.)</font> But it's entirely another to remove just one. A very IMPORTANT one but still only one.

I felt obligated to make it up to him. His memory if you will. A GRAND WAKE IT WAS!! Yes indeed. Yesss...

I invited a mime. Kicking and screaming he came. But quietly it was! ...once I cut out his tongue at least.

I invited a minister to, of course, hold memorial..services. Heh. Very interesting to invite a man of the cloth home and then shackle him to a wall comprised of maggot infested corpses. I think..near the end..he found GOD..again... I should have told him to ask GOD some questions for me but I was distracted by the other guests and could only spare minimal attention.

I invited the attendee at the 24/7 who regretfully declined but sent his regards...piece by piece. The postman eventually inquired about the packages I was receiving with strange substances leaking through them.

I invited the postman too. Eventually. I felt obligated.

I invited the woman who lives down the street. Her chihuahua dog too. IT KNEW!! I had to invite the chihuahua dog too. The dog and the postman got along splendidly! The last I saw them, they were playing some sort of game and the postman was shouting with glee. I believe it was glee. <font size=1>(Not quite, Nny.)</font> And he went all to pieces! PIECES!!

I invited a girl. I never quite caught her name despite all the attention she demanded. She demanded most of my attention. As a result, I don't know what became of the woman who lives down the street with the chihuahua dog. I may find her later.

But this girl... The phone-device was malfunctioning. AND THAT WASN'T FUCKING GOOD ENOUGH FOR HER!! She was uninterested in the PEE-ESS-TEW-thing. NOT GOOD ENOUGH!! I set about creating something to ENTERTAIN HER SINCE NOTHING WAS FUCKING GOOD ENOUGH!!!

She seemed entertained with the new device created ESPECIALLY for her.

I can't..I won't..describe it here, dear DIE-ARY. It would..no... <font size=1>(You don't want to know anyway. Trust me.)</font>

After the party, MEAT was quiet. So quiet again. It was pleasant. I was able to return to my thoughts on the FINAL FANTASY-thing...

[[ <b>OOC NOTE: If you are currently playing, or think you might ever play, this game, don't continue reading unless you want SPOILERS.</b>
You have been warned. See I was oh-so-nice and put the senseless violence FIRST so you could see it with glee and now here comes the things that might require THOUGHT.
Also, small change to userinfo page. And thanks for reading the journal! ]]

I returned to the couch and resumed my reflection on the experience with the FINAL FANTASY-thing.

Over-all, at least they were able to keep their happy memories of each other. See that is what I desire..the beginning. The beginning is always so fine... And they have that: an endless beginning.

But a world half-inhabited with the dead? It was a disconcerting thought. It makes me doubt the reality of THIS world.

You see...he was a dream. A DREAM!!! A dream dreamt by the dead things!! Or..undead things. However you choose to look at it. But he existed. And then he vanished.

Then THE END-END!!! AFTER THE CREDITS FINISHED ROLLING!! He awoke in water, and stretched, and swam away. THE END!!

WHAT DOES IT MEAN?!?! WHAT DOES IT MEAN?!?
WHAT DOES IT MEAN THAT SOMEONE CONCEPTUALIZES A WAKING DREAM IN THIS WAY AND IT FINDS ITS WAY TO MY HANDS?!?

Fuck..is this real? What is real?

I really should try harder to find where it is that Mr. Samsa has gone and resume my study of him. It would be so nice to simply exist and not doubt your reality."

At one point during my travels, I found myself in a coastal area. And being in the area, decided to go for a walk on the beach. There is something about the insistent lapping of waves that is soothing. Salt water itself is pleasant. I believe it has something to do with salt granules in the water that scours a body clean (and causes a sharp stinging feeling in open wounds!) that makes it so enjoyable.

During this walk, I saw an <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/pee_paw/"">old man</a> frolicking in the water with <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/talkread.bml?journal=pee_paw&itemid=10838&thread=269142#t269142"">something squishy</a>. I opted not to disturb him since the water was churning in a rather violent manner... Almost as if <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/talkread.bml?journal=pee_paw&itemid=10838&thread=268118#t268118"">SOMETHING</a> lurked beneath the water's surface.

"event","More and more often recently, I find myself in a situation like the one at that theme park a few weeks ago...two weeks ago...last week. The unconscious times, or times when <b>I</b> am not <b>ME</b>, are becoming more and more prevalent, I think. I don't exactly know since I have no recollection of those times.

I come back to myself and have no memory of how I got there or why. It is disturbing. I think this PEE-ESS-TEW-machine-thing has some sort of hypnotizing agent inherent within the object.

That would be just like Reverend MEAT...

I do recall yesterday. Yesterday, I went down to the video store for a new game to play on the PEE-ESS-TEW machine. I found one but then decided I wanted another. I asked the girl at the counter if she would hold the first one for me. She replied brightly..very brightly..florescent light brightly with ""CERTAINLY, SIR! I WILL HOLD THIS FOR YOU HERE, SIR! WHEN YOU'RE READY TO CHECK OUT, SIR, JUST COME BACK UP HERE, SIR!"" Then she smiled. I smiled back and went searching.

When I returned to the counter to 'CHECK OUT, SIR!' there was a man standing there arguing with the girl about his late fees. From what I heard, he DESERVED to pay them because he was stupid and kept his son's game a week past the due date.

After ten minutes of waiting oh-so-patiently, I grew IMPATIENT at his persistent arguing. While I didn't care one way or the other if he paid his fucking late fees, he was in my way. I decided to take action.

I tapped MISTER KLAUSEN on the shoulder and as he turned around with a sneer twisting his fat lips, I sliced him across his corpulent belly. Then took the intestines that then spilled out to wrap around his fleshy neck. At least..I THINK it was his neck. MISTER KLAUSEN was fat enough that neck was a relative thing.

It must have done the trick however because when I threw the intestines through the ceiling tiles and over a beam, then strainedly hoisted his pudgy, jello-like body from the floor, he kicked and wiggled and eventually expired.

His son, the little scamp, merely reached up to dig his dying father's wallet out of his pocket and paid and left.

""HELLO, SIR! ARE YOU READY TO CHECK OUT NOW, SIR?"" the girl asked me.

I looked at her, the corpse, the people around me and said, ""Umm..yes."" Then I left.

DOES NOTHING REACH THESE FUCKING PEOPLE ANY MORE?!? IS CASUAL VIOLENCE SO ACCEPTED NOW?!?


But it's raining right now. I think I'll go out. The filthy dregs of humanity stay IN while it's raining. It feels so CLEAN when it's raining..."

I found myself standing in line inside a building for this ride and OOH was it a fun ride, yes. But I was inside a building and two teenaged girls came running into the building screaming FOR NO APPARENT REASON. NO REASON. NONE!

They made me twitch.

Those around me twitched also.

Those around me didn't seem to mind my jumping the teenaged screaming girls and in fact, gave out WOOTS of joy at the onset of blessed relative silence.

Those around me didn't seem to mind my tying one of the teenaged screaming girls to the tracks of the ride. Where, at 0 to 70 MPH in 3.78 seconds, she was rapidly reduced to a NON-SCREAMING red smear.

The real trick was getting the other teenaged screaming girl tied down in under fifty seconds for the riding car's return to the docking bay since the ride only lasted fifty-five seconds.

Timing is everything.

The staff for the ride didn't seem to mind the clean-up. In fact, they had the ride again in working order in around twenty minutes and WEEHEEHEE. Ahem. Yes. Much fun. The timeliness of the maintenance crew got me wondering though if this wasn't a common happening...


The past two times I've lapsed into that annoying unconscious state, I've been having odd dreams. I dreamt I was someone else and this other person I dreamt I was annoyed me greatly. The recurring tendency of this dream makes me want to avoid unconsiousness moreso than usual.

This PEE-ESS-TEW is a wonderous thing in keeping me awake for even longer periods of time. No small amount of fascination is held in my attention for this thing. This wonderous thing. FUCK REVEREND MEAT FOR BRINGING THIS THING INTO MY HOUSE!!!

MEAT knows things."

C'mere and share the laugh filled pain. HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!

Whilst on one of my many trips to the video store, I overheard two of the employees talking about a movie: <i>Black Hawk Down</i>. One pointed out to the other than an Ewan McGregor and an Orlando Bloom were in this movie. The other then changed her mind and sorely wanted to see this movie because of these two presences in the movie.

My interest was piqued. I looked at the box.

More bus riding today. At the stop by the public library, Edvard Munch's <i>The Scream</i> in a wheelchair got on the bus. (Political incorrectness is FUN!) Actually, more like <i>The Scream</i> on a little motorscooter.

I was greatly disturbed by the SEEMING physical degredation the human body is capable of. It took <i>The Scream</i> fifteen minutes to open a bottle of Tums. TUMS! NO CHILD SAFETY CAP!!

It was impossible to tell its age. One could only tell that it had entered physical breakdown of the human body...

Then it got off the bus near the highway, put on motoring goggles and <b>ZOOOOOOOMED</b> away down the highway not the byway with a <i><b>WHEEEEEE-HEE-HEE-HEEEEE!!!!</b></i>

And then I went to the grocery store. I needed milk! I DID!! QUIT LOOKING AT ME LIKE THAT!!! I DID!!!

Upon entering the store, I noticed a prominent display of knives and thought to myself 'Well that's handy if ever I forget mine...' Little did I know...

At checkout, <i>PATRICE</i>. Did I really NEED to know this woman's name? No. <i>PATRICE</i> was buying HAMSTER food for <i>WHISKERS</i>. Did I really NEED to know her hamster's name? No.

I never thought that there was an actual USE for those grabby, gooey, sticky, hand-things they sell in those vending machines by the door. But they are quite handy for GRABBING those that try to get away.

*WHISK*
*plop*
<i>*ZING!*</i>
<b>*THUCK THUCK THUCK*</b>

But all this today has me thinking... How old AM I? I can't remember the last time I had a birthday. What is this world I exist in now that I am free of that ink and paint place? Am I existing in the actual or the digital?

This LIVEJOURNAL-place is a double-edged knife.

Still the doubt and confusion of my old existence.

The Spiderman game came equipped with real spiders. While I was busy playing, the spiders and Mr. Samsa were involved in territorial guerilla warfare. I didn't mind until today when they started blocking the FUCKING TEEVEE.

Someone..somewhere..mentioned an auto-thievery game. I think, perhaps, the next in line to be gotten and tried are that one and this FINAL FANTASY-thing I keep hearing about.

For anyone that hasn't caught what's been going on in the <lj user=""romandirge""> journal, it's not a happy place. Presumably the REAL Roman Dirge does have an actual LiveJournal and discovered the <lj user=""romandirge""> journal and came around to say a few things.

I can't say what all went on because while I read it all, it refuses to take in my brain. It simply refuses to compute that this could have happened. This is supposed to be for FUN, right people?

Yeah so <lj user=""romandirge""> is going to delete. And most likely <lj user=""jhonenvasquez""> is going to delete as well because they got dragged into it. I can't say how I feel about all of this now since my emotions seem to be suspended (WOW! Wouldn't Johnny have been proud...) and I can't say how I'm going to feel tomorrow because tomorrow hasn't come yet.

I'm not saying that any of you need to go into the <lj user=""romandirge""> journal and put in your two cents (yen, florin, pence, etc..) in. In fact, PLEASE don't do that. It'll only make a bad situation worse.

So why am I posting this at all? To say that YES, is has indeed effected me because it seems like people I thought were friends here, and would ""understand"" that I had a rare IRL friend over and couldn't go running just then, quite possibly aren't friends after all. I keep thinking over and over that this is all MY fault anyway because I made this journal first (<lj user=""johnny_c"">) and sparked everyone else to make their journals and then all this happened tonight...

I have an overactive guilt complex. And gollee it certainly is fun. It depends how all this shakes down on if I'm going to keep this character (AND YES!! IT <b>IS</b> A CHARACTER PEOPLE!!! NOT REAL!!! FICTION!!!). So we'll see. I'll put it up for adoption if I decide to give it up instead of just deleting. I'm really not the sort of person that deals well with shit. I believe in karma too much.

It's just...well..it saddens me that something like all THAT happened...

I returned <i>The Shining</i> to the video store earlier this evening since I was done with it and wanted more movies. The movies I REALLY wanted don't come out until next week.

I got them anyway.

So nice the employees at the video store are. I got Stephen King's <i>Rose Red</i>, <i>From Hell</i>, and <i>The Others</i>. I can wipe the blood spatters off the cases before I take them back. No problem there.

On second thought, there would be more of him to SPEAK. More UNSPEAKABLE-THINGS to be said. A chorus of his multitudinous voice is not what I desire. Require. A choir of his voice. It would certainly speak in cacophonic blasphemy to what I DO desire.

That and all the other midget-terrors running around the store like pirates on a pillage spree. The only thing missing was torches...and knives...I remedied that...

I'm getting ahead of myself.

Tonight I went to the video store. They wanted <i>The Cell</i> back and I wanted <i>The Shining</i>. Trade-for-trade. Only fair. Yesss...

Midget-bug-eyed-chihuahua-man was working tonight. So was the plain disturbing girl. I'll get to her disturbedness later. Trying to keep the thoughts. Keep them in order....

Happily I wandered the aisles looking for <i>The Shining</i>. Eventually I found it in Horror. Horror! Stupid place to keep it. It wasn't that horrible.

Then the breeder's midget-terror-children swarmed the store and began their path of destruction. The squeals and giggling made my eyes go popping-wide and I tried to flee.

But then, no. Nono. The brood-sow needed new membership. Needed help LOCATING WHERE HALF THE FUCKING STORE WAS!!! YOU'RE FUCKING <b>IN</b> THE FUCKING STORE GO FUCKING LOOK AROUND!!! Plain-girl helped brood-sow because midget-bug-eyed-chihuahua-man was talking on the phone behind the counter...FOR AN HOUR HE TALKED ON THE PHONE!!! I remedied that...

No one to help me. Nono. No help for me. No surcease for this simple need. I went back to look at the comedies. Then back to the counter-place for some service.

Midget-terror-little-person-thing was blowing across that money-bill while his brood-sow mother prattled on about how he had A.D.D.

He didn't have A.D.D. He had lack of corporal punishment in the school system. I remedied that...

With a sigh and a smile, I taught the midget-terror-persons proper public behavior.

Oh. <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/jamie_hewlett/"">James</a>. As I was chasing a chubby-midget-terror-person through the action section with a pointy-sharp-thing, you might be pleased to know that someone had checked out <i>Tank Girl</i>. Just thought you might like knowing that. <b>*SMILE*</b>

But yes, where was I? Chasing chubby-midget-thing down the action aisle...

He was so chubby..so chubby..HAHAHA!!! SO CHUBBY IT WAS LIKE JELLO!!! THWACK! SNICK! SCHLOOP! ALWAYS ROOM FOR JELLO!!! Bill Cosby was dancing on the teevee monitors. He was!

Plain-girl just stood there watching.
Midget-bug-eyed-chihuahua-man was STILL FUCKING TALKING ON THE PHONE!!! OBLIVIOUS, HE WAS TALKING ON THE PHONE!!!

Lithely I lept over the pretty blue counter. Handy phones at the counter. Handy phones all around. Stretchy cords on every phone handy at the pretty blue counter. Easy to take a spare phone. Easy to wrap it around midget-bug-eyed-chihuahua-man's neck. Easy to pull the cord tight. AND HE WAS STILL FUCKING TALKING ON THE FUCKING PHONE!!!

I shoved my knee in his back for extra pressure. CRACK! His head flopped over. Mid-sentence. ""Hello? Hello?"" went the phone. AND BILL COSBY WAS STILL DANCING ON THE TEEVEE MONITORS!!!

The brood-sow was screaming but a quick slice up the middle calmed her down. She was calmed and quiet then.

Plain-girl just stood there staring. She was staring at me with those eyes. Those jaded, glaze-ed eyes with a corporate fixed smile on her face. Her eyes flicked gratefulness at me when I slit her plain-throat.

Grateful. SHE WAS GRATEFUL!!! Fuck... It makes me think. Makes me think about what I'm doing. Makes me think about all these things happening that even without educational torture beforehand, she was grateful to die... Fuck...

Then, for the rest. No time to do the thing properly. The mood had gone. I was disturbed. Plain-girl had disturbed me with her gratefulness. For the rest, I turned the monitors up to head-explody level...

AND BILL COSBY WAS STILL DANCING!!!!"

I found some ants outside to observe instead. They were matching back and forth in a little line to and from, to and from, to and from a dead beetle.

I noticed at one point that there seemed to be a dead ant in the middle of that marching line of ants. Occasionally, another ant would stop and investigate then move on.

There was one ant that kept circling and circling and circling the dead ant. It seemed to be wonder 'Is this food? Or is this Harry? What should I do?'

It makes me wonder in my quest for emotionless functioning, like that of insects, if I would become a cannibal. They took that dead ant back to the hill and made him food. The prospect disturbed me slightly.

Although most PEOPLE seem to have little use other than to be FOOD for something or another. Usually they feed trauma, fears, anxiety...

A band, a show.
I didn't get to go.
Last night.
THE. LAST. NIGHT.

I visited with an old friend today. He came over then we went back to his place. He drove.

On the way, I dropped off a gift for someone else. As promised.

My old friend and I, we watched movies. They were..distracting for a while. Nothing I hadn't seen before, but he hadn't seen them yet, so, for my old friend, I acceded to his wishes.

My old friend had been ""SMOKING"" and smoking during the movies as we watched them. They raised his amusement level with the movies. I did not say anything.

Near the end of the second movie, more of his friends arrived. They brought chemicals with them. They passed pipes amongst themselves and did not include me. Part of me was grateful they did not ask. Part of me was disappointed they did not ask. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE TO HAVE BEEN ASKED!!!

Up and down.
In and out.
Of the room I went.

These new people fascinated me at first. New people! New possible, probable, might-have-been friends. I recognized one of them from somewhere, but could not place where I had seen her before. I still can't.

This bothers me...

Their smoke-inhaled chemicals burned my eyes, ached my head, hazed my brain. In turn, before I left, I took two of their lighters into my hands and fiddled with them. No one seemed to notice. Seemingly innocuous to the naked eye, I left one of the lighters sitting negligently on a table.

I pled my excuses to my old friend and smiled and made my way from the room. Upon the doorway, I turned back to my old friend, lit up another smile and looked down at the second lighter in my hand with surprise.

""Oh. Heh. What am I going to do with THIS?"" I said and with calculated casualness, tossed the lighter to him, then went for the door.

On the back of my old friend's couch sat his cat. The cat looked at me with his eyes. Accusing. Beseeching. That golden-eyed stare boring into the back of my head before I shut the door behind me.

The night air cleared my head as I walked home. Crossing the bridge over the highway, a subtle sonic BOOM rippled the concrete and I...

I bade farewell to my old friend.

Alas, the cat.

I feel myself losing control of myself again. I think, perhaps, I've been actually listening to the things that Reverend MEAT has been spewing forth like maggots from an oral orifice.

This also bothers me...

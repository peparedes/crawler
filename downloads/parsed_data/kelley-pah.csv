Even someone today told me I looked 16 when I was getting an application. Ugh I'm 19. What the hell. Well I'm dying my hair again so that maybe I can get a job at Lord and Taylor. They seemed like they were gonna call me and I'm pretty friggin excited. I like working and I need money ASAP. 

My mom is gonna take me to get my haircut. So I got that to look foward to. I love hair cuts and hair dying. 

Wendy you should pick a Saturday you plan on coming home for a movie night. I just want to make sure that you'll be there. Because we all know that a hang out without Wendy isn't a ton of fun. We need our fiesty Wendy. 


Oh and to people who know they're gonna be at that movie night...give me some good movie ideas otherwise we'll just end up watching disney movies,wedding crashers, and the aristocrats which I don't know, I think you'd guys like that one. hahaha.And as always there will be ton snackies.

Today Ang was nice enough to come along on my job hunt. She's adorable. I missed her. I feel like I haven't seen her in ages and I saw her the other day hahaha. then we made some pretty sweet valentines.

I feel like my boy is being taken from me, but he's not.People just have problems and I don't. So I'm sort of being put on the back burner. As much as I don't like that. I can't do anything. I canjust be here for when he needs someone to talk to becuase a lot of people just go to him and well he's only one person he can only do so much before he cracks. So I don't know I'd like some people to back off him. Other people are just plain stupid and need to die already becuase they're making my friends lives miserable and they're cold hearted and selfish.

I know I'm not the one who needs to complain becuase I don't exactly have any problems but I mean sometimes shit happens and I feel ignored. People don't talk to me as much anymore. It makes me sad but I'm going to have to learn to live with it for the next couple months. Theres not much I can do about it. I mean I am here for my friends but a lot of times they go to Jason or Brian and not me. Which I an understand I suppose. I can't sympathize for everyone but I can still be there for everyone.

I just don't think that because I quit school and sit in my house all day that I should be forgotten.


Well I'm kind of retarded for writing that. but whatever. I haven't been talking about what I've been feeling lately so there I just did and it probably doesn't make sense and I'm sure there are a ton of grammatical errors. So yeah.eat it jerk stuffs."

Today I went out to find a new/ another job. I went around to vet's offices hoping to find a full time job so I can quit the theater. So lets hope that all goes well for me. I'd love working at a vet's office. Me and animals and no humans. Love it. 


So hopefully mom won't be on my case anymore. I have to call the theater again to find a reference. I'm looking for Mike but he wasn't there today so maybe I'll just find someone else to put on the application. I guess it doesn't matter who I put on there, but Mike is good at exagerrating. haha. 

I should clean up a little but I'm too lazy. I guess I'll do that. Then call the theater. Then finish up my applications and I'll probably bring them back tomorrow morning.

I have some essay thing to write or something for english. It's stupid and I don't want to do it. So I'll do it later, after math.Ugh I hate this place. I don't think anyone really understands HOW much I hate being here. I mean if I had the choice of quitting this place without being beaten to death by my whole family I would leave in a heartbeat. But becuase my brothers didn't stay/couldn't stay in school. I am the one who HAS to stay in school no matter how miserable I am. It really doesn't matter what I say to my mom or anyone, they always say the same thing. It will get better and guess what it hasn't  and it won't as long as I'm here.Even if I did ask my mom if i could stop she'd say is staying at home much better. Yes, yes it is. I would work everyday and be happy about that. And I'd probably take sewing lessons or something so she couldn't say I wasn't trying. Whatever. My brothers college experiences were different they were home. I'm in smelly buffalo. At least I get to leave tomorrow morning. I'm happy about that.

Jennifer won an award for being probably the only person to go to all the classes and what not.Then they were giving one to a girl, but she wasnt there and the presenter said she had prefect attendence in all her classes and Gary laughed really loud,ahahahaha.Then they gave awards to Chuck and Allen.When Allen went up we shouted WANG DANG! Basically this conference deal was just show everyone how friggin cool our learning community was. Everyone was all jealous and stuff. Wendy did so good today, I'm really proud of her. 

Then after all that was done, we went to Chuck's for a party. It was the best. Wendy,Jeremy,Lauren,Michael and myself stayed the longest, haha. But we got there and Chuck has a lot of stuff in his house, it's crazy. But we hung out with the TA's and Allen and talked a lot. We talked with Laurence a ton. Gary was being hilarous. And Chuck was running around a lot haha. He had a cute little puppy dog named Harley and a kitten. He named it Bix, I wanna name my animal Bix. Wendy and I went with Laurence to pick up Michael at one point. Then everyone did their presentations and it was great. Jennifer sang strange fruit, which was really good. Magee did his molecules one man act thing which was so good.Allen asked him to do some performances for his classes next semester, so that's cool. Then Wendy had the ""make everyone cry speech"" we love her. Everyone was crying and Allen was acting differently then we'd ever seen him. Magee,Jeremy,Lauren,Wendy,Larurence, and I were in the crying corner. Then Wendy went outside with everyone to get cancer. Lauren, Jeremy,Magee, and I went upstairs in his house and went to the attic and it was insane, there are slides everywhere. And his house is cool. I'm jealous. Then Lauren was a rebel, haha. Then she got Wendy to be a rebel.Michael did his presentation which was cool becuase we made all the cards! haha. Then we went and sat down. Me,Lisa,Magee,Nick was there too, Michael, Wendy, Lauren, Jeremy, John Bobey, and Gary and Wendy,Jeremy,and Lauren did a wallet analysis on John Bobey, haha. Then Gary gave them his wallet and he was shouting things, it was hilarious. Then they were all singing and making Chuck smile, haha. Then it got late and Wendy and Lauren did sneak hugs on the professors, haha. Then we came back, Wendy and I passed out and I'm in the weirdest mood ever, I don't like being here on the weekends. Its loud and boring. I woke up thinking Wendy was going to get food or something so i got up and went outside, but duh everything is closed, I'm not hungry or anything just in a really bad mood.

This soup Michael made, it was good, I'm not much of a soup person. But dinner conversation consisted of making fun of Murrota and Chuck! haha. And singing and talking about babysitting. Then we went back to the living room after we did Michael's dishes for him,haha. Michael showed us his Bob Dylan costume, haha. Then he did one last run through and then we talked about crazy dads, well Wendy and Michael did. Then at like 9 something Magee,Wendy, and Me were sleepy and went home. We got back, Wendy and I had food and watched Fresh Prince. Came back to the room for bed but yeah that isn't happening. People are running down the hall screaming and playing loud music and rawr they don't shut up and Lexy isn't here to shut them the fuck up. I'm ready to drop some bows yo. Ugh I'm getting real sick and it blows.

I want to fall asleep and have a drink of water.

Blah, night.

Lost keith at the gas station. Nate went home then we got back to Brians and Ang had to go so we left.Then Jason and I cuddled and went to sleep.

Saturday- We woke up and ate and I took him home. I sat around to house for awhile. Then I went to Nana's for dinner it was fun. Then I came home and I called the theater and got tickets for jason and I for Chicken Little. Then we went to the movies and holy crap everything is different. Everything is all digital and Vaga is a manager looking all suave and shit in a suit,lol.Then we went and sat down and Brian,Matt,and Jon Clark showed up and we watched it and laughed, it was cute.

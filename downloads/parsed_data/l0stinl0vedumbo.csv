"event","a few more random quotes:

""letting someone think that someone they love is dead, when they're not, is quite cruel"" - bill from kill bill (vol. 2)

""So I guess this is the ending of a beautiful mistake. And if we both agree that we shouldn't be together why does it hurt so much? I feel like I lost my closest friend. I don't want to fall asleep alone, but do I want to wake up with you? I hope you're happy and completely lonely."" -The Ataris

I don't know how long I can do this, I said. I think the universe has different plans for me and we sat there in silence and I thought to myself that this is the thing we all come to and this is the thing we all fight...and if we are lucky enough to lose, our lives become beautiful with mystery again & I sat there silent because that is not something that can be said.

I kinda miss those ramblin' conversations
where we talked about nothin'
the way you always made me laugh at my frustrations

and a random thought ( i just finished watching the kill bill series): 

if your whole life's goal is to do one thing, and once that one thing is accomplished? do you have a feeling of relief? or regret?"

"event","im never on here. i dont know why. oh yes i do, im not a livejournal type of person. however, i felt like posting some quotes i found that express how i feel.<BR>

<lj-cut text=""then reality kicked in, never been happier than then, those days that still made me smile, when i had perfection for a while."">
I want to scream real loud
Will you hear me?
I want to cry my eyes out.
Will you see me?

Do you love me?
You said you did.
Did you lie?

I can't be played like this
I'm not your toy
But my heart is breaking


""then reality kicked in, never been happier than then, those days that still made me smile, when i had perfection for a while.""

someone mentioned your name and asked if i knew you
i just smile ,, look down ,, think of all our good times x3
and then i softly whisper with a tear --""Yeah, i used to""

So you found out today your life's not the same
Not quite as perfect as it was yesterday but
When you were just getting in the groove
Now you're faced with something new
And I know it hurts and I know you feel torn
But you never gave up this easily before
So why do you choose today to give it all away

when you're a kid, you see the life that you want,and it never crosses your mind that its not gonna turn out that way


Dear You,
I wanted to let you know that for all the times you made me smile, I thank you. You made me feel whole and like someone really saw who I was inside. This is for you, poor child - who's heart has yet to be loved by another. For your chance at this one has slowly passed. This is for you, Mr.Amazing - for your true colors couldn't have shown so boldly. This is for the tears you made me cry that you never saw. For you can see them now, for there is a mark on my heart. This is for you, oblivious lover - who drifted off unto someplace else. This is for you, an old crush, I have said my goodbyes - & have put you to rest.
Love Always,- Me

"event","ive decided i officially hate this school. i hate simi, and i hate everything about this place. i want to just leave. i dont like how they do things. they make my life hell. i hate the system. when i ever i really want something, can i have it? no. this district is hell. thye just want my life to be hell. they want me to die. they want my life to be horrible.

first i want to graduate when i can. but would they let me even if i filled all the requirements? no. why? because the district doesnt want me too. the district here feels that even if a student is more than capable, they still cannot do what they are able to. i could have taken the stupid PE, health and econ/gov classes this year. and then id be eligible to graduate. then i wouldn't have to put up with this stupid school another year. 

next. since the whole world knows how much i LOVE web design. i want to take the new ROP web design class. but since AP english 12 is second period, im already unable to take ROP for that one period. and since i cant take it that one period, im not able to take it during third period even though thats the only period id be able to take it. it makes my life horrible. so then im still stuck in french 3. a class that i took last year. and the only reason why i took it again was to learn imparfait, something i didnt learn last year. so now that ive learned that, im just going to sit in french 3 doing work i did last year, listening to things i heard last year. everything already done. and ill be absolutely bored. i think ill just never show up to that class. just not participate. not do the work. nothing. and then thats a failure on my grade. do i care? no, because this school is putting me to that point. i could do the work, but what is the point. its pointless. absolutely pointless. because its stupid.

i hate it here. i could just call up my mom and tell her that id love to leave. i could move to the philippines, and id get my diploma in about a couple months. then i could just go to college. or not go to college and just be a bum and live there. because one dollar equals 55 pesos, so id be living the high-life, and doing nothing. so why is it that i still want to be in simi? what was my reason for staying again?"

i hate my mom. i can't stand her. she doesn't like me at all. she just hates me. she thinks i cant do anything right. she thinks that im a hopeless failure. she's mad at me because im always talking to scott. its not my fault that we like eachother. okay, you cant stop two people from liking eachother. its the whole romeo&juliette thing. you try to make them stop, and guess what happens. they commit suicide. im not saying that i would do that over anyone, im just saying that it makes a person want to rebel more. 
then she's so naive. she wants me to just focus on school. not to work, have friends, no boyfriend, nothing but school. i mean, who the hell actually only focuses on school. there is no way in hell any person could only be about school. cause honestly everyone has something else going for them. and like, she wants me to go to college. nothing then. she gets pissed off if i have any extra-curriculars or i volunteer, but that is what i need to get into a good college you know? so how the hell does she expect me to get into a four year university when she wont even let me meet all the requirements. she just wants the grades, she doesn't understand that colleges are looking for more than just grades. and even if i get into a college. i cant do anything then. she doesnt want me to work, because she wants me to focus on my classes. she doesn't want me to have any friends, cause that will take time out of studying. she definately wont let me have a boyfriend, because that would just screw me over. so what the hell? when am i going to be allowed to grow up? after college? i dont think so either. she wants me to get into a career, get high up on that ladder. become a president of some company. and in order to do that, am i allowed to have a life? no, i cant, she wants me to spend all my time and energy into that career that she will finally let me have once i graduate from college. any friends? no. any boys? no. she says she wants me to get married one day, but when will that day come? when im dead? dead from not having a life? gosh.

thanks mom. for all the stupid bullshit you have put me through, and are going to. 

i just wish i could grow up now. maybe leave. go away from all the stupid troubles that i have. gah!

dude, this whole thing is different. its weird.

i decided i was going to be a bitch and just complain. i have so much to complain about. rather..just my stupidity. 

we all know that im a crazy psycho who decided to take all these crazy insane classes this year..do crazy insane clubs, work, and volunteer. and now, im pulling all nighters atleast twice a week. i dont eat that much anymore. and im not generally in a good mood. why? because im a stupid psycho bitch.

why you may ask? the only way to describe my reasoning is as follows: 

one day in ap english class. mrs. bradley asked how many of the students' parents have a college education. everyone raised their hand except me. my parents didnt even pass high school. my mother didnt even make it past the sixth grade. they both got jobs to support themselves and their humongous families. they want me to do better than them. and they dont pressure me like crazy, but because i feel i must accomplish something i pressure myself into doing better. so i work my ass off. i take the insane amount of classes. i work. i volunteer. i do extracurricular activities that actually require you to do things. and for what? 

to just kill myself. this is why i someone really needs to run me over. that way we can just get it all over with...

and then today i got sick. i threw up a couple times at work. cause i havent been eating right. and i havent been sleeping well. actually no sleep.. so we should all just kill me now...




however..<i>you</i> have been keeping me sane for a bit now..i just hope you still can."

"event","this is something off one of my guy friends from japan's site. its pretty interesting cause it makes ""men"" seem more human. and in many ways its true i guess. 

NICE GUYS FINISH LAST..(to all gurls out there) 

it's amazing that assholes can get girls.actually, now that i think of it it's not that AMAZING.they are assholes at heart, but to meet girls they unlavish their undying love.IT""S A CHARADE.they act nice,friendly, and they listen...until they get into what their after.Their prey thinks that they are in love with them,however when they realize what assholes their predators really are, they pretend like the asshole is really nice inside.the girl tries to change the asshole into a NICE GUY,but assholes will always be assholes.she gets upset and goes to the NICE GUY to complain about the ASSHOLE.but she claims to love the asshole...now this is where the THEORY begins.she does not want to look like she is easy so she won't dump the asshole right away,instead she will stay with the asshole. 

GIRLS can be IDIOTS.they don't realize that the nice guy has been there all along.he never had to pretend to be the good guy to get girls because he is naturally like that.however, girls don't see it for some reason or another.they look at the nice guy as a friend, a trusted companion, to whom they can tell their sad story to about their asshole boyfriend.but the nice guy isn't THAT naive.he was trying to score with the girl he listens to all along.the problem is that since he is a nice guy he keeps listening. 

since girls get attached to things that pay attention to them, they think of the nice guy as a friend.A FRIEND. they don't say,""oh he's hot"" or ""u want to have his children"" about the nice guy, they just want the emotional support. when they get the emotional support from the nice guy, they don't need it from the asshole. the nice guy get the shit end of the stick while the asshole gets all the action...i have been down this path for all of my post pubescent life and it has gotten me NOWHERE...at least not in the women department. perhaps another reason why girls fall for the asshole is because assholes ignore the girl they are with. the women wonder, ""why isn't he paying attetntion to me?"" so they explore why. 

they poke and prod and get closer to the asshole. they start to get easier with each attempt to get closer. the asshole finally says,""i've let this beauty dangle long enough, time to boat this bass.""it is then he put on his charade and the girl feels like she has won him...even though all she won was an asshole. once you hae gone down this path as a nice guy or a ""listener"" you can't turn back. the girl will always go after the assholes because there are always nice guys there to listen. once yoo realize that you are a ""listener"" you can't do anything about it...juss pack up and close the shop. there is no way u will get into her pants...ever.there is and never will be a situation where the nice guy will get the girl he has a crush on. 

it juss doesn't work like that. the girl won't ""come to her senses"" and realize what an asshole her boyfriend is like in the movies...instead she will juss go after another asshole, and unless you stop being a nice guy, she will never go after you. women complain that there are no nice guys in the world.RIGHT!!!. they are obviously not looking hard enough because there are nice guys everywhere! girls aren't looking for nice guys...they say they are but they're not.they are looking for the perfect asshole, but there is no such thing as the perfect asshole. all in all, the nice guy gets the shaft. to all the girls out there with boyfriends that don't treat you with respect, that don't listen to you, and that don't care about you i say this;look next to you. 

the guy that has been standing next to you the whole time is the guy you have been looking for. he is what u want your asshole to be like. he knows more about you than you know yourself because he has listened to it all."""

"event","well, yesterday was an interesting day. it was a normal day for me cause i didnt wake up till rather late, and all that jazz. well, anyways, when my parents came home, they had a talk with my grandmother in the family room, and i hear my grandmother say to them really loud <b>""i dont want you to move""</b> and then they start discussing things, and i eventually go into there because i got thirsty and you have to walk through the family room to get to the kitchen. and yah, my parents tell me ""the day of our departure will remain on hiatus"" or some crap like that, so basically im not moving for a while, but when i finally do move, it will be very ""all of a sudden"", just like all the other times..."

"event","<p>Have you ever thought about death?&nbsp;<br /><br />Just recently, I was thinking about death for no reason at all. It was odd at first, becuase it was the first time I had ever thought about suicide. Not committing it, of course, but just the topic of suicide.<br /><br />After my parents called me a selfish, snobby bitch, I had a vivid image of a sixteen year old girl with curly brown hair who had just hung herself. She had decided that she wanted to 'go' wearing&nbsp;her purple prom dress, heels, and a face full of makeup, and she looked absolutely beautiful. The only problem was that she was dead. But she looked calm, and peaceful.&nbsp;</p><p>So, naturally,&nbsp;I began to think about death and suicide, and how it would be quiet. After the long, demeaning struggle that is life, the serenity would be... welcomed. Death, to me, is not a scary thing. That is&nbsp;NOT to say, however, that I wish to die, for I do not. I&nbsp;just simply do not fear death. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>"

"event","<p>My perception...&nbsp;<br /><br />A while ago, Sam Thompson, being the tool that he is, accused me of saying that people who fail classes in school are stupid, and that they should have no chance at suceeding in life. I simply stated that it was the people who choose not to put forth the effort that fail, and therefore, shouldn't be awarded assistance to temporarily ammend their issues, when 10 seconds later, it'll all be too much for them, and they'll fall flat on their faces again. Sam couldn't agree less. We had HUGE arguments over this in Math class, that ended with him delcaring himself as the winner, and refusing to let me talk anymore about the issue. </p><p>It is now, ladies and gentlemen, friends and family, that I annouce to you: I have a comeback with an analogy that supports my theory and reasoning. Here it goes:</p><p>Life is like a huge mountain. The montain's summit is called Oppritunity. Everyone is born at the base of the mountain, and throughout their life, has to climb this mountain. For some, this task is one that is prominent in their minds, always. They strive to acheive the goal that is Oppritunity. There are others of us who simple sit on the mountainside, picking daisies and EXPECTING a small chunk of Oppritunity to come rolling down the side of the mountain and land squarely in their laps. These are the types of people that annoy people like me. </p><p>There are also some who are givers, in that they make short stops alog their journey up the mountain in an effort to help fellow climbers up the mountain. Some climbers have simply fallen of the good and righteous path. These are the climbers that truly deserve this precious assistance, those who truly desire it. There are some, the expectors, who expect the givers to assist them, and perhaps even carry them up the side of the mountain, so long as they don't have to do any work. </p><p>I was explaining to Sam Thompson that it is the expectors who don't deserve to be carried along through life without contributing to their own future. In school, these expectors are called slackers. </p><p>Every person is born with the right and the ability to make the climb to Oppritunity. It is those who CHOOSE to put forth enough effort to reach Oppritunity that succeed. The expectors shouldn't be given help by he givers; the givers need to use thier precious and valuable assisting skills to assist those who have temporarily fallen off the righteouse path. If the expectors truly wanted to get their lives on track, they could try it byt themselves first. If their case proved impossible to correct with only one person, assistance might then, be granted.&nbsp;<br /><br />People who don't try are not stupid, they are simply denying THEMSELVES of a good and prosperous future.&nbsp;<br /><br />And that's today's perception of life. &nbsp;</p>"

"event","<p>And that's just what this is.&nbsp;A LIVING HELL. Maybe its hard for you too. Maybe this unspoken rule is totally clouding your real feelings, but then again, maybe its not.&nbsp;<br /><br />Maybe this is how you truly feel. So betrayed and broken and unsure about this act of selfishness oppressed upon you by the person you thought was your best friend. And&nbsp;why feel betrayed? An unspoken rule. Where, Em, in the Constitution&nbsp;does it say: <em>Best friends are NOT under any circumstances&nbsp;legally allowed to date their best friend's ex-boyfriends</em>, hmm? I mean, its not like he dumped you. It was the other way around.<br /><br />My living hell has just been made worse by these recent unfortunate events. The ONE time&nbsp;I was actually happy with somene of the opposite sex, and what&nbsp;do you do?&nbsp;Silently make me feel like a steaming pile of shit. </p><p>I mean, honestly. My&nbsp;dad doesn't hate you, Em, he&nbsp;just thinks that because&nbsp;I have such low self-esteem and no self-respect, that me&nbsp;CONSTANTLY worrying about you and your feelings is bad for me. Yeah, well... FUCK that. I honestly love you more than I could love anyone else. Its times like this that I actually wonder, <em>Why</em>?&nbsp;Its so hard to&nbsp;sit there and watch you hurt yourself, knowing that there's nothing that I could say to make you stop. It didn't matter to you that it&nbsp;<em>killed</em> me inside. You did it because it felt good; it took away the&nbsp;emotional pain.&nbsp;<br /><br />But did you ever realize that as you took away your emotional pain and replaced it with physical pain, that all you were really doing was&nbsp;hurting me even more? Sometimes Holly would say that it was getting a little ridiculous, with how many times you did it, and the reasons behind that self-mutilation were even more absurd. Everytime you told me, it still felt the same as the first time; my heart was SCREAMING to find the answer and help you.&nbsp;<br /><br />I'll always love you, and I hope you will me. But then when I ask you, ""Do you think this will ruin our friendship?"" and you calmly reply, ""I don't know."" It makes me wonder, question if you really love me. I would take a bullet for you, Em.&nbsp;You could murder my entire family, and I wouldn't think any less of you, and you want to know why? Its because I LOVE YOU and you are my&nbsp;best friend in the entire world.&nbsp;There's nothing you could do on this green&nbsp;Earth that would&nbsp;change my opinion of you.&nbsp;<br /><br />My life is a living hell because I have to deal with my parents not wanting me to be friends with you. My mother saying&nbsp;nasty, angry&nbsp; things about you. I have to HATE her sometimes because she is so horrible. You think its hard not feeling welcome by my mother at my house? TRY LIVING WITH YOUR PARENTS THAT HATE YOUR BEST FRIEND. SAYING HORRIBLE THINGS ABOUT&nbsp;YOUR BEST FRIEND&nbsp;while you're&nbsp;<em>listening</em>.&nbsp;TRY HAVING YOUR FATHER HIT YOU BECAUSE YOU GOT SO MAD AT HIM FOR EVEN&nbsp;thinking THAT YOU SHOULD GET A&nbsp;DIFFERENT BEST FRIEND. And yet, I'm mad at&nbsp;<em>them</em>.&nbsp;<br /><br />Sure, you and I get into fights. That's natural. Petty things that get&nbsp;resolved. This is one of those petty things, but you still won't let it go. And all because of an unspoken rule.&nbsp;<br /><br />You ask why I don't come to you about more things?&nbsp;Its because I'm too busy being there for other people to worry about my problems. Its not that I don't like doing that, because I want to be there for my friends 24/7, no matter what. THAT'S what my dad thinks is dangerous. You have a lot of emotional trouble, Em, and I want to be ther to help. Its hard, though. Becuase I go through every day hoping that your safe, hoping that Holly and Emily and Kiri and&nbsp;Sarah and everyone else is&nbsp;happy, and safe. I worry about all of you so much, that I don't have time to worry about myself. And I'm not complaining about that, I'm just explaining it to you.&nbsp;<br /><br />And then, you, the person who I care about more than anyone else in the entire world, tells me that you&nbsp;don't know if a petty thing like this will ruin our friendship? What am&nbsp;I supposed to&nbsp;do&nbsp;then? I LOVE being able to be there for you. And then when you say you don't&nbsp;trust me? I care about you so deeply,&nbsp;and then to have you say THAT?&nbsp;<br /><br />Maybe you should try telling all those people that you've told that 'look down on me now'&nbsp;all the things I've said in this post. Maybe then, they can undersand BOTH sides of the story. Maybe&nbsp;you and I need to talk about what is REALLY going on, not all this 'unspoken rule' bullshit.<br /><br />The way I feel&nbsp;about myself and about you is not your fault, so please don't take it upon yourself to feel like I'm blaming my helluva&nbsp;fucked up life on you, because I'm not. I'm simply informing you. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>"

"event","<p>This, friends, is my realization: If she wants to be pissed at me, fine. There's nothing I can do to change that. If she's too stubborn to talk about this rationally (meaning WITHOUT hysterics,) then fine. I can't change that.&nbsp;<br /><br />Do I WANT to talk? Yes. She thinks I'm happy about this? yeah... haha. Good one. HELL no. I'm not any happier abot this than she is. </p><p>I mean, sure, we're on different sides, so we're both unhappy about different things. But we still need to talk about this.&nbsp;</p><p>Honestly, Em. Are you TRYING to turn the whole school against me? ""You know, a lot of people are looking down on you for this.""</p><p>Nice one. No really, that's good. You just keep telling people what a HORRIBLE person I am until I have no more friends. Will that make you happy? </p><p>I thought friends were supposed to be happy for eachother. If it were you, I would be supporting you. YOU KNOW THAT, (P.S. this is when I get mad) BECAUSE EVERYTIME YOU NEEDED SUPPORT BECAUSE EM AND HOLLY AND KIRI WEREN'T ALL THAT HAPPY THAT YOU WERE DATING HIM, WHO WAS THERE FOR YOU? me. AND WHO TOLD YOU TO ASK YOURSELF WHAT&nbsp;you WANTED, NOT WHAT EVERYONE ELSE WANTED? me. </p><p>You wanna know&nbsp;something? I put your feelings above my own, and I always have. (you're rolling your eyes right now, I can FEEL it.) That's why I&nbsp;was so unsure. That's why I felt like shit the night I told you. That's why I've been feeling like shit everytime you scowl at me and get all pissy. But then, he&nbsp;(and Holly and my parents and Sarah,) all said that I need to put my own feelings first. So yeah, I made one desicion&nbsp;about something that I wanted. I'm sorry that you're so upset about this, but you're being kind of selfish. I could understand if it was awkwardness that you were battling with. Also if HE&nbsp;had&nbsp;dumped YOU. But that's not the way it was. YOU dumped HIM <u><strong>TWICE</strong></u>.&nbsp;<br /><br />My parents think its unhealthy for me to be best friends with you because they think that me putting your feelings above my own is dangerous. (So that's when I said FUCK THEM. That's part of the reason I get in trouble or grounded all the time. I get into shouting matches with them about why I can choose who I want to be friends with.)<br /><br />Its because I can see past the mood swings and part-time selfishness. I can see the beautiful, kind, loving person you truly are. That's what friends do, Em. Whether I'm unhappy that you are overreacting (or so I&nbsp;think...) or not, I can put that aside, because I&nbsp;have always loved&nbsp;you, and I always will.<br />&nbsp;<br />I'll&nbsp;love you forever, I'll like you for always. As long as I'm living, my baby you'll be. &nbsp;</p>"

"event","Wow. I was just realizing how I never seem to post on this anymore. Its been almost a month since I've even gone to lj. That's just sad.&nbsp; 

I was wondering... can certain relationships mess with other relationships? Can personal issues truly effect *sp* the ones you love? They always say that what you do impacts everyone around you... because they care... but what does it take to understand? Does it really take being in that person's poisition? Do you really have to walk two moons in their moccasins do get it?&nbsp; 

I think I finally understand now. It&nbsp;feels good... almost... I get it now. It can be dark... and scary, I suppose. Depressing, almost, but in a relief-ee sort of way... Its confusing... yet somehow, it all pulls together and makes sense. Right there. Suddenly, it's just there. And there's nothing&nbsp;else about it. No second guessing... no past questions... it's so simple. Just how it feels, you can't control it, though some (in the beginning...) hope that they can.&nbsp; 

Everyone says: ""Yeah... Betty died last year from it... but that won't happen to me, I can control it."" That's what you think until you really begin to feel that dark abyss that surrounded Betty last year. It begins to drag you under, and there's nothing you can do. Yet somehow, the surreality of it all becomes your buoy. The fact that it is a relief; washing away everything from your body. It floats you back to the top, and somehow, you're alright again.&nbsp; 

Maybe the next time you're feeling sad and lonely, it'll happen again. But maybe that's not such a bad thing."

LIVE LIKE YOU WERE DYING

He said I was in my early forties 
with a lot of life before me 
when a moment came that stopped me on a dime 
and I spent most of the next days
looking at the x-rays 
Talking bout the options 
and talking bout sweet time
I asked him when it sank in 
that this might really be the real end 
how's it hit you when you get that kinda news 
man what'd you do 

and he said
I went sky diving 
I went Rocky Mountain climbing 
I went 2.7 seconds on a bull named fumanchu 
and I loved deeper and I spoke sweeter 
and I gave forgiveness I'd been denying 
and he said someday I hope you get the chance 
to live like you were dying.

He said I was finally the husband 
that most the time I wasn't 
and I became a friend a friend would like to have 
and all the sudden going fishin 
wasn't such an imposition 
and I went three times that year I lost my dad 
well I finally read the good book 
and I took a good long hard look 
at what I'd do if I could do it all again 

and then 
I went sky diving 
I went Rocky Mountain climbing 
I went 2.7 seconds on a bull named fumanchu 
and I loved deeper and I spoke sweeter 
and I gave forgiveness I'd been denying 
and he said someday I hope you get the chance 
to live like you were dying.

Like tomorrow was a gift and you got eternity to think about 
whatd you do with it what did you do with it 
what did I do with it 
what would I do with it? 

Sky diving 
I went Rocky Mountain climbing 
I went 2.7 seconds on a bull named fumanchu 
and then I loved deeper and I spoke sweeter 
and I watched an eagle as it was flying 
and he said someday I hope you get the chance 
to live like you were dying.
To live like you were dying 
To live like you were dying
To live like you were dying 
To live like you were dying

It's 9:23 pm, but I have to start somewhere. 

I HATE math. But I suppose, that's why I have to do these stupid worksheets. 

2+2= ... 4!

"event","My watch says it's 10:51 pm, and my computer says it's 10:56 pm. That's kind of interesting. I think it would be neat if every clock in the world was programmed to the exact smae time, and even if the power went out, it would automatically correct itself. :D

Regardless, I am tired. I do NOT want to sleep. Thought you should know.

Most people that have lj's talk about important and interesting stuff. I, however, talk about time, and how it is different between two clocks. BORING!!!

Oh well, good night. 

It blew out again?
No, I think that I dropped my stash.
I know I've seen you out and about when I used to go out. Your candles out.

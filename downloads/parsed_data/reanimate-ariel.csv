I'm glad with how everythings going though... its like a "" FINALLY "" thing to me. but yea...not gonna get the hopes up.. im really hoping... because he is so great, from what i see so far.  but yea taking things slow never hurt anyone... i've never really had the urge to get to know someone. til i was sitting there on a rock in SF and had an amazing conversation and realized there are people kinda like me!<INSERT>

<P>Here's a little bit of old school for ya,<P>
<P>That goes a little something like this...<P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I always tried to be the flyest kid in the block<P>
<P>The popular one with the rising stocks<P>
<P>So that's when I had this bright idea<P>
<P>Throw the party of the month<P>
<P>No, the party of the year<P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>All the fine girls couldn't turn it down<P>
<P>Now all I gotta do is get my parents out<P>
<P>Should I send them to a movie<P>
<P>No, send them to a show <P>
<P>Let me think, hmmmmmm<P>
<P>It's gotta be long though<P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I said Mom, Dad, yo why ya sittin home<P>
<P>It's a Friday night have you seen Aunt Joan<P>
<P>And don't worry about stayin' out too long<P>
<P>Don't fuss over me, I'll be fine alone<P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Have a good time...<P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The door bell rings cuz the party's here<P>
<P>I'm crankin up the stereo like it's New Years<P>
<P>Walkin' 'round the house like who's Da Man<P>
<P>(Everybody do it like Aaron can)<P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>First on the floor, you know that's me<P>
<P>Bustin' out the moves like it's MTV<P>
<P>I'm guessin' where I'm goin' cuz I lost my head<P>
<P>Then I jumped on table, this is what I said<P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>People all around you gotta <P>
<P>(Come get it) <P>
<P>Everyone together sing it loud <P>
<P>(Come get it) <P>
<P>Jump all around come on <P>
<P>(Come get it) <P>
<P>What...<P>
<P>(Come get it)<P>
<P>Say it again<P>
<P>(Come get it)<P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>People all around you gotta<P>
<P>(Come get it)<P>
<P>From the left to the right, make noise<P>
<P>(Come get it)<P>
<P>Here we go now, come on<P>
<P>Uh uh what what <P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Na na na na... Na na na na...<P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Things are goin' great <P>
<P>Then to my surprise<P>
<P>Some people walked in, I didn't recognize<P>
<P>I said fellows yo ya gotta get out<P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>(Hey man I heard this was an open house) <P>
<P>Open house?<P>
<P>(Yeah that's what the flyers said)<P>
<P>I didn't put out flyers!<P>
<P>(Well somebody did)<P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Then walked in<P>
<P>The girl I'm crushin'<P>
<P>And the kid spilled juice<P>
<P>On my Mom's new cushion<P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I turned around and <P>
<P>Another kid broke the lamp <P>
<P>(I hope they weren't expensive)<P>
<P>They got them from France<P>
<P>For now I won't sweat it<P>
<P>I'll clean it up later <P>
<P>There's a honey over there<P>
<P>And I really wanna meet her<P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>People all around you gotta<P>
<P>(come get it) <P>
<P>Everyone together sing it loud<P>
<P>(come get it) <P>
<P>Jump all around come on<P>
<P>(come get it) <P>
<P>What?<P>
<P>(come get it)<P>
<P>Say it again here we go, uh<P>

<P>(come get it) <P>
<P>Here we go now, come on<P>
<P>Uh uh what what<P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Aaron C's in the house, here we go <P>
<P>Come with it<P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Break it down<P>
<P>(go go go go go...)<P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Is that a car door<P>
<P>Oh dang I'm in trouble<P>
<P>Everybody get out now<P>
<P>On the double <P>
<P>I'm dead (your done) that's it for me<P>
<P>I'm gonna be picked off my family tree<P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Once Mom finds out 'bout this party I had<P>
<P>I don't wanna even start thinkin' about dad<P>
<P>I'm hustlin around the house <P>
<P>Trying to clean up the mess<P>
<P>I sure put my new white Nikes to the test<P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The car door slammed<P>
<P>And they're walking up the steps<P>
<P>I guess life is good with 10 seconds left <P>
<P>(AARON!!!???!!!) <P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>

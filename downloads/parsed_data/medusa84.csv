I am dreading tonight so much my stomach is already in knots. I get all this pressure about the importance of seeing friends and its more about quality time with them rather than the event , i see their point and agree but what upsets me is that no respect for my total repulsion of such an event and how much i will hate it and have done every year. I know i am being a misery but hey.

the downside of laptop is that joe and i were beginning to turn into hermits.

not even talking to eachother just video calling inter room.

not a treat, we are stamping out such behaviour before it gets the better of us lol.

Also another plus, we now have a spare room, the office has now been made redundant, much sorting to do however.

I feel so pulled and spread thinly with my voluntary committments.

I have Qtopia Every week (thurdays and sometimes weekends) for several hours and also our  2 hours radio show every thursday (an hour after qtopia finishes)

And now through my job i have been (essentially pushed) into sitting on a committee and joining a society which entails yet more voluntary work for zero pay.

am i being a moaning mini ?? I just feel if i am giving my time here there and everywhere i will have none for myself and cannot give my all.

"event","so we heard from Orange lady, all is well and she is even buying a shed for us too store our lady mower and bbq etc, bless.

Her reason for not calling us or even texting was that she was on holiday so thats ticketyboo.

The Classic or Old Gays are furnishing us with much boxes tonight which will be a total delight and Mr Aaron will be taking our green chairs back (sheds a tear) our new home is much much smaller than current home and we simply cannot take all we want to, even the dining table may be culled (here's hoping it fits) 

so only a little more than a week to go and NO MORE SOW & GAAAAAARY! ,We just need to get all our bond back from here and I bet she will make it tough.

""ooooooh pin holes, I told you not to use pins heheheheheeh, that will be all your bond""

we have much back up arguement for whatever she says.

*2 weeks no plumbing
* a year to fix a window
*Garden a swamp wasteland


the list goes on !

now a nice song to wash all the anger away

"event","our move is next week and to not have a repeat of the Tavendale-Opawa road move brain failure we are planning well in advance. Garden and swamp receiving frequent attention to keep it up to spec (well ya know) and items being culled in strict fashion. Our pornography and dvds are already boxed and awaiting their new home and my room items are slowly following suit. The hope is that joe and I can get as much as possible from opawa to hornbrook on the saturday night and all that will essentially be left on sunday will be the big items as it were.

Wish us well, as we will be meeting sow for final inspection on the sunday and signing off of our bond. (Bless the rug doctor) 

Also we have a free couch and two matching chairs to give away !! free free FREE !"

the neighbours music all night followed by a morning session it seems is getting beyond belief.

Thankfully new abode is neighboured by old lady flats and , well in fact the majority of the street is over 60's townhouses so that suits me down to the ground.

"event","so i have been working on call as a waiter at a cute cafe along with my regular slave labour at the dirty mans parlor. Sadly of late the better and more enjoyable (not to mention  double the pay) job keeps asking me to come in exactly when i am at my dirty mans slave job. This upsets me much as i dont want cafe to give up on me as i do know they have designs on giving me a proper full time job i just need to get some more shifts under my belt. Right now is horrid as i know stand down is looming and ill need all the shifts at all the places i can for a while. I would like to quit my job at the dirty mans parlor but need to wait until guaranteed hours at the cafe. Also my bosses at the dirty mans will be away for at least a month soon so i wont really be able to leave. Yet my mates say ""fuck them"" and say if the opportunity to have better paid job comes take it, forget other job.

I agree, just for some reason i hold a sense of loyalty to the other workers at the dirty mans and how much hell life would be for them if i just walked out.

on more positive notes:

We have visitors from the north this weekend. Miss Caroline (Wellington) & Mr Nick (Palmerston North) which will be a delight and am much looking forward to us all having drinks and sits. With any luck i may get to witness another dance off between MR Aaron and Miss Caroline :0

On the BOOB front, the vet gave her a few injections and some liquid i am too force feed her for a while (like that will work)she has a bladder infection the poor sausage. The vet also encouraged i have boobs ears removed before the cancer spreads to her face but thats more a medium term plan i think, I am yet to discuss with my daughter the possibility of life sans ears. I sense an massive ""noooooooooooo daddy"" is coming my way"

Saturday_ got up at like 10:30.. uhh ate pancakes. then chelsea n emily went home. me and heather went to the mall.. it was a nice time, a little bit of bonding time. we ate armbys and got food posioning. we also both had to crap, so we went into  kerbys and stunk up the bathroom and left. haha. then we put our shoes on the wrong feet and walked to straight legs. we were being hott.. but we didnt some serious shopping tooo. we saw ethan n jeremy, but they run from, us.. so we stalked them. ummm... after we went to heathers, took a bath and got ready to go to YMCA, there was like no one there, but it was still fun!! justine, ur a great singer.. and erik ur band is great!! i wish i could have sang rodulph tho!! after we went to emilys house, well just me n heather did. it was a nice time.

"event","yesterday was tim g's party. it was a pretty good time. some things went better then i thought.. and some went worse. first of all we had to leave early because there was too many people. which is alright. sorry tim!! then ethan made a rude comment to heather. i felt soo horrible like it was my fault!! but nothing i could do. i need to talk to her, im loosing her slowly, over a guy. it seems like a competition, to see who can get him before the other one can. I HATE IT!! i hate all this. this is the hardest decision i've made. ethans telling everyone we are going out. i dont know if we are or not, i need to talk to him. heather will he devistated, i dont want her to hate me. but i remember a pact we made a long time ago. if u like someone and they like u back.. then go out! but its soo much harder. i know how much heather loves him, its not like they were going to get married tho. and neither are him and i. im sure if we do go out, it wont last long. ahhhh i cant explain everything. 
back to tims party... jeremy shot a porn video.. hahah it was soo funny!
me diana and chelsea left pretty much when tim said we had to. we went to IGA, bought food, and we saw kirk.. he was high. then we saw al. he wasnt. we just went back to my house. emily came over later too. chelsea went home, im not sure why tho. i wish she hadent. my mom took us to get movies.. and we listened to saves the day really loud in the car. it was a good time. when we came home.. we watched 200 cigarettes. then we just talked, listened to saves the day, and messed  around.. no one was home so yeah. i need to talk to ethan soo bad. diana and emily i think gave me a cold. fuck fuck fuck. i wonder whut i will do today. probably nothing at all. oh well. i need to shower and get off this piece of shit!!  so later..

Yesterday_ okay.. well school absoultly SUCKED!!! i leaked.. because mrs malak wouldnt let me fucking go to the bathroom. so then after school emily asked me if i wanted to go over to her house. and we got subway on the way home. after we went to ethans. we didnt do much.. emily n ethan beat each other up, i watched and laughed. then we watched billy madison, and ethan lit emilys hair on fire.. haha.. but u cant tell at ALL. uhhh emily left like a half hour before i did.. so we just hung out, his dog attacked me.. and he talked about the good old days. then my mom came around 7:40.. i had dance, so heather was in the car, along with diana. i felt stupid because heather was pissed at me.. (dont know why?) and diana was sad the whole day so i thought she still would be. uhh when i got home emily called me.. then ethan called her.. so we 3-wayd.. it was horrible. i kept hanging up on emily.. and yeah. then ethan called heather i guess and told her like everything!!! so that was kool!! guess i cant trust him.. but then again i guess i did that to him to. okay.. then i went to bed.

Today_ school sucked as usual!! uhh after school i walked to burger king with diana, heather, ethan and chelsea.. we just stood in the cold. pointless. umm.. then chelsea went home. justines sister came and got us in her new car.. its nice.. and we went to justines. ethan told heather bout the party.. and hetaher told justine.. so i guess there just wont be one. uhhh im going to kohls.. altho im freeing and i have a sore throat.. ahh im soo fucking pissed at evreything.. especially heather!!! gay gay gay

  this may sound lame to some of u.. but shes part of the family.. and now shes leaving.. forever. i got her when i was about 4, she always acted like a puppy, no matter how old she was.

After school i walked home with all differnt people (Nid and Erik) and Jeremy saved a mouse, it was sad. Uhh then i relized there was a tornado watch.. so i made diana and emily leave right AWAY! So we did.. and plus diana was about to get rapped. umm when we got there emily was being really hott.. and she didnt want to go with us out to eat and to work out. So just me and diana went. (ALTHO emily went to chelseas!) KKOOOOOLLLLL!!!! uhh i had a really good time with her though. ummm, <b>TOMORROWS MY MOMS BIRTHDAY (and tony's)</b> But shes ugnna be gone all day so yeah, thats why i didnt stay the night at dianas, but shes not even home! gay, but ill have a sleepover with her. Ummm.. tomorrow I am supossed to be going to Ryans/Tony's to roller blade. Heather is supossed to come with me, but shes at chelseas too, so i dunno, i wont go if she doesnt. and she told me today she doesnt like me. so thats also very KOOL. 

AHHH everyone thinks i hate erik and that im really mean to him, but i love him a lot and i am not really mena to him im kidding, and he knows that. i know i do it too much, and i try to stop, but ahhhhhhh god im just GAY when it comes to relationships.

"event","I'm watching Bowling for Columbine, a movie that always pisses me off. Somehow, despite his obese demeanor, Michael Moore manages to spark my anger in exposing the bullshit of our country.

While watching it, I came up with questions and comments. I want to write to Mr. Bush about these, only I fear any kind of typeface without pictures will only confuse him. Besides, I don't want to waste my postage on the bastard. Postage to the White House should be free.

Bowling for Columbine

1. The only justice would be for Charelton Heston to be shot. The nerve of that asshole.

2. How can you form an anarchy club? Isn't the term 'anarchy' defined by no rules or structure?

3. How can you fit a rifle down your pants without being noticed?

4. I can't stand hypocrites.

5. I want to have an anti-Bush rally in Washington, only I doubt I'll be able to not kill the man.

6. The U.S. uses scare tactics to frighten citizens. Without the fear, people would question things.

7. I'm moving to Canada.

8. I would hate to be a black guy in the U.S.

9. Marilyn Manson appears to be quite intelligent, and I don't know what to think.

10. Everything is propoganda and people are conditioned.

11. Why do people in the U.S. bend over backwards to be polite to politicians? Why do politicians lie and cheat and steal yet are still respected?

12. Maybe I do want to be a social worker.

13. Why the fuck does the Bush administration feel the need to concentrate on wars and destruction in other countries than concentrating on our social issues? Oh no, I take that back. His new bankruptcy bill, privatizing social security, and this whole welfare business proves it. Whatever happened to concerning yourself with health care, poverty, and equal rights?

It's been a while since I've been completely sober in my mentality. I'm starting to regain my consciousness about the world, and I love to fuel the fires. Just being utterly outraged makes me feel like my old self."

"event","This weekend was interesting, in a sense that it was completely the same as every weekend. Brittany and Sera came over, Casie decided to join the party, and we sat in the back room, (now completely clean and beautiful, thanks very much) and basically chilled there all weekend drinking and smoking. 

I've come to the decision that I need to find some new friends or a new hobby, because the same old thing is not getting me by.

Last night I also came to the conclusion that I will be alone forever and should therefore invest in some cats and a nice pair of knitting needles. You'll be able to find me at my dad's house, in my rocking chair, for the rest of my life. Look me up.

Grr. My dad woke me up today to tell me to get up for my final at Siena. Never mind the fact that I told him it is TOMORROW at 2:15, not TODAY at 12:30. Not like it would matter, because he took the only working car, but I imagine it is the thought that counts. Bastard."

"event","Today was really tiring.

I got out of bed just before breakfast because the smell of cooking bacon woke me up.

I feel unusual because my antidepressants are making me hairy.

I'm so sad. My kitten got run over this afternoon. I found him when I was coming home from school. His head was all squished. I took some photos. I'll miss him. Poor kitty.

Last night I had to shave my entire body. Apparently, the lice that I caught from Amanda's friend are really hard to get rid of. I look quite strange with no hair and eyebrows. I'd post pictures, but my webcam is broken.

I want to tell the world that my girlfriend Amy is the bomb! She made pizza last night, and even though I burnt my lips on the cheese, it was awesome!!!

I am sharpening my knives before I go to work today, because I'm going to cut out Robert's heart and feed it to him for losing my mail.

Today, I got a digital camera! Yes! But I don't know how to work it. Can you help me?

I want to say thanks to simon and Abbey and Dave and the other Simon for helping me on Saturday. You guys are the best. By the way, if you happen to find my wallet, keys or underwear, could you SMS me? Adrian has my number.

I went to the doctor yesterday, and he said I have bipolar disorder, just like my best friend Sally.

You should all do this quiz! It's amazingly accurate. You just put in your name and birthday, and it will tell you what job you'll do when you grow up.

I can't wait for summer time! Popsicles, yay!

That's enough for now. But I'll leave you with this thought - sharing your life with strangers on the internet is the cheapest form of therapy available. Leave a comment and tell me I'm beautiful.

I got out of bed because i didn't want to waste a snowday.

I feel sad, because Sarah and Britney are complete bitches. They told everyone I have an STD, just because I slept with both of their boyfriends on Saturday night.

I'm so angry. Paul is grounded. AGAIN! And I'm not allowed to see him. EVER. It's just NOT FAIR. I hate my mom and I wish she was dead. This wouldn't happen if I was allowed to live with dad.

Last night I had to go and pay Joshua's bail. He's such a jerk. He got arrested for punching the Walmart clerk in the face for refusing to sell him beer. He's only 16!

I want to tell the world to get fucked.

I am really annoyed with those assholes at _are_you_hotter_than_us_?, because I am so much cuter than them, and those photos don't do me justice. They can't reject me, so I'm starting my own rating community. Click here to join (the first five applicants are automatically accepted).

Today, I got a digital camera! Yes! I'm so ugly. Don't look at my photos pleeeeeze.

I want to say thanks to the world for absolutely fucking nothing! You all suck. I feel so alone, no one ever reads this journal, or even comments to let me know that I'm not suffering alone. It's cold here, and I want to die, but I cannot figure out how many of you to take with me when I go.

I went to the doctor yesterday, and he said I have bipolar disorder, and should stop smoking drugs.

You should all do this quiz! It's amazingly accurate. You just put in your name and birthday, and it will tell you you're a moron.

I'm hoping not to get ripped off, this is all the money I have... and I need to shower.

That's enough for now. But I'll leave you with my favourite Buffy fan-fiction piece I wrote last year when I was in hospital.

Lou wanted to be noticed and understood, but he was so quiet. So one day he wrote the following poem:
a four or five piece band
where three or four of the
people don't play
any instruments performed
in front of an
audience consisting
solely of six foot
two lesbians from Anchorage
Alaska, a kind of
healing feeling friendly
Sam for a fortnight and
a half a ham
and cheese
insinuating strenuous
selfishness and culminating in
concrete caribou tissue
and crucified cats
After finishing the poem, Lou left it on the dining room table. Then he went into the bathroom, slit each wrist seven times and quietly died. No one noticed but everyone understood."

"event","Whew,
Another scramble is complete.  The newly renamed ""Team Soppy Suit?"" comleted our three and half minute opus entitled <u>Brax to the Max</u> and we eagerly anticipate this friday when we will be screened (unless we are disqualified).  These weekends are intense!  We created a really dark movie this time because we were assigned the genre NOIR so you can look forward to a moody dark piece starring Jake Bridges with Stuart Webb playing the role of the Drug Dealing brother.  I cannot wait to see how it goes over on friday.  I hope everyone likes this Sitcom as much as we do =)

After three weeks of planning, a week of pre-production and storyboarding, a week of shooting consisting of around 22 hours of on set filming, and a week of editing and soundmixing together a Orchestrated soundtrack we finally have a whopping <b>five minute</b> movie!
I would like to go ahead and thank the Lovely Erin Johnson, the Obese Jake Bridges, and the Laughing Grace Collins for all their help on the shoots.
You can hopefully expect this one late this coming september if we are selected as a Sidewalk High School Filmmaking finalist.

-If you have not seen this banana then you are missing out on one of the most life changing experiences of your life, it is quite possibly one of the funniest films ever created. Anyway that film (Rejected) and many like it are coming June 8th to workplay as a part of the Sidewalk Cinematheque! If you have seen the film and liked it then copy and paste this or create a post on your livejournal and let the masses know that the Animation Show is finally coming to town.
<img src=http://img24.photobucket.com/albums/v72/mike_show/animation%20show/Animation_Show.jpg>
The animation show is a collection of animations put together by legendary animators Don Hertzfeldt (rejected, billy's balloon, genre) and Mike Judge (Beavis and Butthead, King of the Hill). It features Billy's Balloon, and Rejected by Don H. as well as three new shorts, created by Don just for the Animation Show, that you cannot see anywhere else. It also has films from all over of all varieties (from CG, and claymation to black and white, and painted). After years of touring the show is finally coming to Birmingham and it will be worth your time.

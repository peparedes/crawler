I think it was a very important piece to give a voice to parents who are dealing with the VERY REAL cases of childhood mental illness in this country. She is obviously struggling, as are thousands of other parents, and those parents need our sympathy and support, not hate and doubt. But I also agree with critics that say she did many kids a disservice by making her child's diagnosis so vague, reinforcing the idea that non-neurotypical kids are violent and hateful when the vastvastvast majority are not. I sympathize as well with the kid and can't help but think how hurtful it must be to see his own mother write, for all the world to see, that she thinks he could be a mass murderer. Unless he's a sociopath, he will find that incredibly wounding. Wouldn't you? And I think she probably should have left herself, and her kid, anonymous, for his own protection. I think a post like <a href=""http://http://sarahkendzior.com/2012/12/16/want-the-truth-behind-i-am-adam-lanzas-mother-read-her-blog/"">this one</a> is way more of a hit piece than it needs to be, but I can't help thinking that by not only putting her kid's name on the piece but also going on the Today Show, she comes off more as trying to jump-start her own writing career than anything else. A very complicated situation. I wish she had done a better job at being an advocate not only for other struggling parents but for the children in question. As a parent of a special needs child AND as a person who suffered from childhood mental illness, I try my hardest on days when I'm at the end of my rope to keep in perspective who suffers most acutely in these situations.</p><p><span style=""font-size: x-small;""><i>Posted via <a href=""http://m.livejournal.com/iphone/link"">LiveJournal app for iPhone</a>.</i></span></p>"

"event","11 years ago at this time, I was sitting in the West End on a spectacularly beautiful day listening to military jets screech by, staring at TV screens with a hundred other people in total shock, turned away from the hospital when we tried to give blood, watching the traffic on Broadway at a complete halt as people tried in vain to escape this island on fire.

1 year ago at this time, I lay in a hospital bed, cradling my new baby boy and eating my second helping of room service French toast.

That second day was better. But there's no way to forget the first. Forget when, days later , I came out of an unfamiliar subway stop and didn't know which way my building was, which river was which, smoke that smelled like rubber and metal and bodies hanging thick in the air, women walking with face masks, weeping, past National Guard trucks, never forget watching for weeks as they loaded gruesome twisted hunks of metal onto barges outside Allan's office window.

Never forget that it was raining the day before, walked home down Broadway splashing through puddles in flip flops listening to Big Calm, reminding myself to follow Kareem's suggestion and turn on NY1 the next morning before leaving the house to make sure to avoid repeating that particular podiatric error. Never forget what flashed onto the screen as I went to turn off the tv that next morning and head downtown.

Never forget leaving an oblivious message on Allan's machine, telling him I thought my subway ride might be disrupted due to some bizarre mishap at the WTC. Never forget his equally oblivious call-back, ""Oh yeah, don't bother coming in, today's a wash, everyone's going home."" Never forget calling my parents' school and talking to a chipper receptionist who apparently hadn't heard the news, never forget trying and trying and trying to call again but the circuits were overloaded by millions of people doing the exact same thing. Never forget being on the phone with my mom when the tower fell and she burst into tears and I just felt myself lift right out of my body and freeze there in time, watching the world literally collapse.

Never forget the day that made me a New Yorker real fucking quick. Never forget how everyone on the subway suddenly smiled at you, asked how you were doing, asked if you and your loved ones were safe. Never forget riding that subway through the boarded up Cortlandt Street stop, slowly and solemnly, for years.

Never forget how it started with posters and candles and flowers, and rapidly turned into tchotchkes and key chains and miniature American flags for all, thousands of flag decals hastily stuck to the windows of terrified cab drivers of self-evidently suspicious ethnicity. Never forget family members who were pilloried in the press when they dared to disagree with what our country was doing supposedly in the name of their husband, their brother, their father. Never forget the first responders dying of mesothelioma and bankrupting their families because they can't afford health care. Never forget the 10 year old children who will never know their fathers.

Never forget how for six years, I had a home in the most amazing city on earth."

This was really hard...I kept coming up with different answers, and I didn't want to just keep putting up videos of bands I'd already mentioned, like Cocteau Twins and the Afghan Whigs. So I finally just went with the band that had the most formative effect on my musical preferences and that I was most excited to see live and that absolutely blew away my expectations when I finally did.

(The runner up for best band would probably be the Smiths, which is one band I will never ever ever see live -- although some might have said the same for the Pixies!  Apparently Morrissey is a much bigger grudge-holding asshole towards Johnny Marr than Black Francis was towards Kim Deal.  The quote I found from Morrissey on Wikipedia is, ""I would rather eat my own testicles than reform The Smiths, and that's saying something for a vegetarian.""  Nice.  Anyway, none of the best Smiths videos on YouTube are embeddable, so no links.)"

But she's going to the hospital now.</p><p>*sigh*</p><p>This is the absolute best advice I can give to those of you who are ever planning to get pregnant: You will be super excited and eager to have your baby and want to go to the hospital the second you think you might be in labor.

Rest.</p><p>Because you will pretty much never get to rest again.</p><p>That is meant as absolutely no offense to the woman in question. I understand 100% the impulse to go to the hospital.  Hell, I did it even though I was planning for natural labor and knew that going to the hospital would minimize the chances of that and that I should labor at home as long as possible. I knew, I KNEW. But there's something enticing about the hospital, like going there will make your baby magically come out faster (it won't) and you have been pregnant for SO LONG and you want so badly to meet this little person you've been cooking all this time.  But, look.  It's pretty much impossible to conceptualize until you've given birth, but for serious -- you are about to run a marathon while having your insides explode, and then IMMEDIATELY following that you expected to start parenting. And then you are a parent forever, nonstop. So LIE. THE FUCK. DOWN.</p>"

"event","I haven't written a politics post in a long, long time.  Mostly because it exhausts me and makes me angry, so until someone starts paying me to work in this field I've supposedly chosen, I'm out of the game and doing mommy stuff.  Not to say I don't keep up with what's going on in the world; I do.  But I see how Segev gets when he wakes up and immediately starts reading Glenn Greenwald and then clicks on all his links and footnotes and just gets deeper and deeper into the depths of the blogosphere, descending into a vortex of impotent rage...it's not good for his mental health.  I'm trying to avoid a similar fate.

But I do have a couple of quick things to say.

It is possible to believe in Israel's right to exist but still criticize the actions of its government.

It is possible to believe that Israel has a right to defend itself but still believe that its actions towards the flotilla were heinous.

It is possible to believe that Hamas is a terrorist organization but still believe that the blockade of Gaza is unconscionable from a humanitarian standpoint.

And it is possible to believe that Helen Thomas has had an admirable career in journalism and that she should be commended for being the only person in a room full of sycophants to hold press secretary feet to the fire, and still believe that her recent words were anti-Semitic.

Let me extrapolate a bit further.  I don't really have that much of a problem with her saying ""Get out of Palestine.""  Lord knows I've heard a hundred college freshmen, usually white kids with dreads and trust funds, shout similar things on the Columbia Great Lawn.  It's a particularly non-nuanced sentiment, but whatever.  It's the ""Go home [to] Poland, Germany, America and wherever else"" part that is offensive.  Really, the ""go back to [fill in the blank]"" construction is never not racist.  And telling people to go back to countries where they were systematically murdered is really, really messed up.  Also, her statement buys into the <a href=""http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllJewsAreAshkenazi"" title=""An analysis of popular culture's stereotypes of Jews."">""All Jews Are Ashkenazi""</a> stereotype that is incredibly pervasive.  Fun fact: the majority of Jews in Israel are not of Eastern Europe descent.  So telling Israeli's to go back to Poland is a non-sequitur.  There weren't all that many Jews in Poland and Germany left to move to Israel.  That was...sorta the point.

Do I think that this was an offense so egregious that it merited losing her job?  *sigh*  I dunno.  Plenty of people in politics say racist shit all the time and don't lose their jobs.  I guess that's where a lot of the more extreme criticism is coming from on the left, at least -- I've seen people say that this is a conspiracy by AIPAC and the Jews that run the media.  Fuck that shit.  Helen Thomas has had a long and illustrious career.  She said something really stupid and racist, and she's been a thorn in the side of powerful people.  So this was sorta the inevitable conclusion.  An ugly way to go out, though.  Especially with that screen capture on the YouTube video -- yikes!  It was news to me that she is Lebanese-American; I'd always thought she was of <a href=""http://puppet.wikia.com/wiki/Junior_Gorg"" title=""Image of Junior Gorg, a Muppet from the show Fraggle Rock."">Gorg</a> descent."

"event","OK, I feel like I should give my thoughts on the Lost finale.

<lj-cut text=""They're not particularly deep..."">

I was actually pretty pleased with the episode.  

""But Maggie,"" you might ask, ""didn't it bother you that they didn't answer any questions at all AT ALL, and apparently seasons 2, 3, 4 and 5 were all red herrings, and the show was really ALL ABOUT JACK and his search for inner peace?""  You would think it would.  But I decided before watching that I was going to go into it not expecting them to answer a SINGLE QUESTION (which they didn't) and just let myself go with the flow.  It was very cathartic.  I mean, sure, I'm pissed off that apparently the show I thought I was watching all these years, the one with all the time-travel and weird shadowy multinational conglomerates doing research on sharks and mind control and immortal pirates and dead people appearing out of nowhere and SCARY EYEBALLS IN CABINS OH MY GOD FOR SERIOUS WHOSE EYE WAS IT??, wasn't the show the writers were actually making.  They really meant for the show to be about Kate's toy plane and Shannon's mean stepmom and Locke's pot-growing cult and Charlie doing diaper commercials THIS WHOLE TIME.  Silly me.  But I realized that I actually DO kinda care about these characters, even the ones that annoy the crap out of me (*cough*Kate*cough*Boone*cough*Jack*cough*Shannon*cough*Claire...wow, I have a nasty cough!), so it was nice to get watch such an emotionally satisfying end for all of them.  

Well, OK, when I was first watching Jack and Christian's conversation and Jack said, ""I died,"" I was immediately like ""WHAT THE SHIT DARLTON I THOUGHT YOU SAID THAT THE ISLAND WASN""T PURGATORY ARE YOU FUCKING WITH ME??"" but then I kept watching and actually LISTENED to what Christian said and was like, ""Oh, no, wait, the island was real.  The sideways is purgatory.  They all died at various times and ended up here so they could all move on together.  That's actually really nice.  That's pleasant closure.""  Although, of course, you can nitpick some of the details.  Particularly the fact that it was original-recipe-baby Aaron that moved on with them, which doesn't make sense because he did grow up to be his own person with a life and whatever, one would assume.  But apparently some people in the alternate reality were just kinda...props?  Like Jack's ""son""?  And Segev was like, ""Wait, how come some of the cast doesn't get to go?""  and I said, ""You mean like that black guy?  Or that other black guy?  Or the black kid?  Or that Chinese guy?  Or the Cuban guy?""  IT'S FUNNY BECAUSE IT IS A REFLECTION OF INSTITUTIONAL RACISM.  But, you know, Lapidus didn't get to go either.  

Which is such total bullshit.  Why don't any of the characters care about Lapidus?? He saved your asses MULTIPLE times, but you all think he drowned and you're just like ""BOO HOO HOO SUN AND JIN...who's this Lapenis dude again?""  And then he WASN'T dead, which we found out in a moment that I'm confident made at least 75% of the audience sit up and shout ""LAPIDUS!"" in jubilation, and then they walkie talkie Jack/Kate/Sawyer and say, ""Yeah, hey, Lapidus is here and it going to fly us off the island,"" and Kate's just like, ""hm, great, thanks Miles.""  YOU THOUGHT HE WAS DEAD!  HE IS NOT DEAD!  You can't even say ""Oh, awesome, that guy who knows how to fly is still here?  He seems like a nice enough guy.  Cool.""  No.  Nothing.  And then he doesn't even get to go to heaven with them?  How many times does a guy have to fly you off a collapsing/disappearing island for him to get invited to your potluck dinners?  Well, I'm just going to fanwank that Lapidus died with absolutely no inner turmoil to work out and shuffled off this mortal coil in a cloud of fairy dust and awesomeness the second his heart stopped beating. 

I was also pissed that Batmanuel wasn't invited to their little Unitarian Universalist Purgatory Party, especially since Ben was, but I'll fanwank that one too -- for Richard, the island really WAS purgatory.  He was there for 150 years.  So once he got off the island, it was all just frosting -- by the time he died he'd worked his issues out and got to leave tout de suite as well.  (I was also thinking to myself, ""Good luck back in the real world with no social security number, dude,"" but then I remembered he'd BEEN off the island before, so apparently he just had to head back to the Mittelos Bioscience lab headquartered in the back of that butcher shop where Ben apparently had some sort of identity theft/meat processing/Kerouac reading cartel going on, which will NEVER BE EXPLAINED...OK, the bitterness came back up a little bit.  Swallowing it down...)

And Daniel's going to stay and hang out with his bitch mom who tortured him his whole life and then shot him when he went back in time.  Fine.  At least he can make out with Charlotte...who continues to have no real backstory or inner life of her own.  But she DOES have pretty hair, so WIN in the end for Charlotte.  

And Eko already walked into the light with Yemi.  And we're just going to pretend Walt never existed...or else WALT wants to pretend all the other crash survivors never existed and just moved on with his life and blocked all this stuff out, which, I wouldn't blame him.  And Michael is stuck on the island whispering for all eternity, because apparently shooting two people, one of whom was really fucking annoying and a murderer herself, is worse than all the crazy crap Ben did over the course of 25 years.  You know, like stealing someone's baby and gassing everyone he grew up with (wait, WHO told him to do that again??) and just straight up shooting people for shits and giggles.  He ""still has things to work out,"" but he gets to do it while eating coq au vin with that lady whose baby he stole (only now she's showered!) and that said same baby. (And can we PLEASE stop this trend of putting people in pigtails to make them seem like they're 17 when they're really 24?  The same thing happened with Shannon in that Liam Neeson killbot movie.  They gave her pigtails with RIBBONS and had her SKIPPING.  Of course, then later in the movie they have her doped up on heroin, slumped over in lingerie being auctioned off as a sex slave to sultans.  But seriously.  As I said on Facebook, I am already skeeved enough that the actress who plays Alex is boning Jeff Goldblum in real life; I don't need the added horror of picturing her dressed up like Dorothy Gale while they're doing it.)

And Miles...Miles is just going to stay in purgatory-LA and have a spinoff cop show.  With Ana Lucia.  There will be hijinks.

So, basically, what we learn in the finale is that Jack is the worst island protector ever.  (Which goes along with him being JUST THE WORST in general.)  I mean, you spend all season walking back and forth across the island, trying to stop Smokey's plans to get off the island.  Then you finally meet back up with him (right after he has threatened to kill Rose and Bernard with extra pain sauce, which STEP AWAY FROM THE INTERACIAL HIPPIE COUPLE, EVIL DOT MATRIX PRINTER LOCKEFACE GUY!!) and he's like, ""Hey, Desmond and I are going to go into this magical cave of phlebotinum and pull out this incredibly literal cork from the shiny electromagnetism,"" and Jack's just like, ""OK, that sounds cool, I bet that will actually further my goals even though I have no reason to think it would because Jacob didn't tell me ANYTHING and just made me drink this river scum because you broke his bottle of magic wine like a hundred years ago, thanks a lot for that BTW.""  And then it sorta DOES work out, because Locke becomes mortal (just total luck on Jack's part) but not until scary RED phlebotinum comes out of the island anus and the whole place starts shaking and falling into the ocean.  Couldn't you have waited just a little bit longer to put this brilliant plan into action, Jack? Because Miles and Richard are trying to build a plane out of duct tape.  (That was one of the funniest moments in the episode -- that and the look on Jin's face when Sawyer says he's a cop.  Daniel Dae Kim can do no wrong.)  And then we get that AWESOME flying punch shot.  And then Kate's obnoxious habit of following people when they specifically tell her not to FINALLY pays off and she gets to do something useful for once in six damn years.  And THEN they make out.  Which I was super happy about, because apparently Jate was fate after all and that's fine because Sawyer deserves better.  Well, he deserves Juliet.  And he gets her later, which was just a lovely scene.  Awwww.

I completely called the last shot (Jack's eye closing) about 5.75 seasons ago, but I wasn't expecting Vincent to show up, and it made me teary.

So, yeah, once I got through the penultimate episode and realized that what Darlton considered an exposition dump was really just completely without any substance and only addressing questions I didn't give a shit about, I went into this episode with a sense of resignation and was pleasantly surprised.

I would have been more pleasantly surprised, though, if it had just been Desmond dancing around in an unbuttoned blue shirt drinking McCutcheon and singing sea shanties for 2.5 hours.  Brought to you by Target.  Smashcut to black.  LOST."

"event","OK, so my daughter will be crawling soon and I'm trying to figure out ways around a couple of lingering issues with babyproofing.  Any suggestions you guys might have would be very helpful.  Keep in mind that we live in an apartment, so any major physical renovations beyond basically ""screw this into the wall"" or ""doublestick tape!"" are not possible.

1. The baby's closet has bifold doors.  Unfortunately, they go all the way to the ceiling, so I can't put the bifold lock over the top like with other sliding closet doors in the house.  There are two doors, so theoretically I could lock them with a sliding lock like<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/American-Cross-Cabinet-Safety-Slide/dp/B0026N5B3K/ref=pd_sbs_hpc_18""> this one</a>...but the handles are too far apart for any sliding locks I've found.  So I guess I'm going to just put the bifold lock on the bottom of the doors, since my main concern is just that her fingers don't get pinched, not actually seriously locking her out of the closet.  But if anyone has a different idea, I'm all ears.

2. We have handles on all the room doors, including the baby's room, that lock on the inside with a push-button lock.  I'm a little concerned that she could accidentally lock herself in her room.  I've seen doorknob covers, but no door handle covers other than locks meant to keep baby from OPENING doors.  I have one of those already for our bedroom door.  I just need something that will cover the push button on her door handle.  Thoughts?

3.  Just realized today that the bar stools we have along the kitchen counter are probably not going to work -- she could totally pull them down on herself.  But...has anyone ever bolted stools to the wall?  Like, get some sort of long brackets that would go around the legs and hold them at the appropriate distance from the counter, but keep them from tipping over?  Where might I find something like that?  My google-fu is only getting me tips about bolting bar stools to the floor, which isn't an option due to pre-existing non-bolting bar stools and wall-to-wall non-removable carpeting.

4. Is there such a thing as a cover for a coaxial cable port?  You know, the bolt that sticks out of the wall to plug your cable TV or internet into?  Because there's one in her room, but I'm not planning on putting the cable router in there anytime soon.  I'll probably buy a round piece of styrofoam from Michaels or something, just hollow it out and cover it that way, but I wondered if there were already covers out there.  I didn't see anything on the web, but maybe I was searching wrong.

Thanks!"

"event","I'm kinda grossed out that <a href=""http://valleywag.gawker.com/5155418/deblogging-julia"">the selective deleting of Tumblr blogs seems to have been done mainly for the benefit of Julia Allison</a>, but I'm honestly not surprised and don't really care that much.  I really like the concept behind Tumblr, the simplicity of its programming and all that, but somewhere along the line it turned into this really self-referential insular circle jerk that is thoroughly unappealing.  Obviously you can use Tumblr in such a way that you never even see any of that stuff -- I'm sure many people who use Tumblr would have no idea what I'm even talking about here.  But for a large subset of active blogs, the dialogue has started to resemble what the Gawker comments used to be like, back when you had to be specifically invited to comment.  It's very...ick.  So, while in principle I'm opposed to blog censorship, especially half-assed and incompetent censorship (see: <a href=""http://phamos818.livejournal.com/tag/lj"">my LJ tag</a>), I am also in principle opposed to giving Julia Allison any attention at all AT ALL.  So JUST STOP WRITING ABOUT HER.  She is a completely inconsequential human being that <a href=""http://www.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/magazine/16-08/howto_allison"">no one outside of idiotic bloggers has even heard of</a>.  Just STOP."

"event","25. <strong>Leftovers! </strong> <strong>MGMT</strong> hit it big this year, but their album came out in 2007.  So, as much as I would love to put <strong>""Electric Feel""</strong> higher up on this list, it has to hang out on the bottom for technical reasons.  Also getting a lot of play in my car this year but not technically eligible for 2008 prizes?  The <strong>New Young Pony Club</strong> album, and two terribly catchy earworms by <strong>Paramore</strong>: <strong>""That's What You Get""</strong> and <strong>""Misery Business""</strong>.  I want to hate Paramore, but I can't.

24. <strong>""URA Fever"" by the Kills</strong>.  Featured in an awesome moment on <em>Gossip Girl</em>, following which the rest of the season went downhill.  Similarly, the rest of the Kills album was not too exciting.  But <em>Gossip Girl</em> got better again in the second season, and even more awesome songs were played!  Some of them will appear elsewhere on this list!  I'm Chuck Bass!

23.  <strong>Robyn</strong>'s album finally came out!  I kinda feel like I shouldn't specify singles on here, because all of the songs on this album have been floating around for years now, but I'm glad they were finally collected and released here in the states.  Now, other people can sing Crash and Burn Girl with me, and I won't feel insane (or possibly Swedish) -- because they played it on <em>Gossip Girl</em>!  Note: Segev hates this album.

22.  <strong>""A Milli"" and ""Got Money"" by Lil Wayne</strong>.  Lil Wayne likes to talk about how much money he has.  He often does it in relatively catchy ways.  This pleases me.  I think he is hugely overrated as a rapper, but I still enjoy the beats.

21. <strong>""Move (Cut Copy Remix)"" by Cansei De Sur Sexy</strong>.  I like the Cut Copy remix of this better than the original.

20.  <strong>""Paris is Burning (Cut Copy Remix)"" by Ladyhawke</strong>.  I have not heard the original version of this, but I like the Cut Copy remix.

19.  <strong>""Hearts on Fire"" by Cut Copy</strong>.  I like Cut Copy.

18.  <strong>The Ting Tings.</strong>  The Ting Tings confuse me.  They had a song on <em>Gossip Girl</em> -- but it was probably my least favorite song of theirs (<strong>""Shut Up And Let Me Go""</strong>).  They have some songs where the big popular remix is awesome while the original kinda sucks (<strong>""That's Not My Name""</strong>), and some where the original is great and the big popular remix is a big letdown (<strong>""Great DJ""</strong>).  Maybe next album will give me a little big of consistency?  Because the raw material is totally there.  Good luck, Ting Tings!

17. <strong>""Down to Earth"" by Peter Gabriel.</strong>  God knows I'll take whatever little Peter Gabriel scraps get served up to me these days -- but the fact that this song accompanied the most amazing credits sequence in any movie ever makes it more than just a scrap.  How crazy is it that in possibly the best movie of the year, possibly the best animated film of all time, the Peter Gabriel-scored credits is the part that made me cry?

<lj-embed id=""71""/>

16. <strong>Santogold</strong>.  I didn't think her album was terrifically consistent, but I definitely dug pretty much everything she touched this year.  Best songs, probably <strong>""Creator""</strong> (as featured in a Sandra-Oh-dances-around-in-slow-motion sequence on <em>Grey's Anatomy</em>) and <strong>""L.E.S. Artistes""</strong>, but various collaborations with Amanda Blank and Jay-Z were pretty tops, too.  And, again, yes, featured in a fabulous <em>Gossip Girl</em> scene.  (Yes, Dan Humphrey, Serena DOES think you're a joke.  So SHOVE IT.)

<lj-cut text=""TOP 15"">

15.  <strong>""I'm Not Gonna Teach Your Boyfriend How To Dance With You"" by Black Kids</strong>.  I heard a remix of this first, which I liked, but which sounds so dissimilar to the original that when I finally HEARD the original, I thought it was the Cure doing a remix of that dance song Abby had sent to me.  Oops!  Nope!  As far as I know, this song has NOT been played on <em>Gossip Girl</em>, but another song by them, <strong>""Partie Traumatic""</strong>, has.

14. <strong>Hard Candy - Madonna</strong>.  Seriously, people, it's crap but it's GOOD crap, if that makes any sense.  Favorites of mine include<strong> ""Devil Wouldn't Recognize""</strong>, <strong>""Dance 2Night""</strong> and <strong>""Miles Away""</strong> -- basically, it's one of those rare albums where the second half is actually BETTER than the first half, so when you get irritated about three songs in, you miss the good stuff towards the end.  I am also trying not to let Madonna's new Jocelyn-Wildensteinian facial structure ruin my ability to appreciate her music.

13. <strong>""Toil and Trouble"" by Say Hi To Your Mom For Me</strong>.  I discovered this song through Pandora, and I am just so happy that there's a band with this name that I felt the need to include it on this list.  If only there were a band called ""Say Hello To LUMBERG For Me!"" then my life would be complete.

12. <strong>Does It Offend You, Yeah</strong>.  Another great band name, and a bunch of fun songs.  My two faves are <strong>""Epic Last Song (Lifelike Remix)""</strong> and <strong>""Being Bad Feels Pretty Good""</strong>.  Nothing about this band stands out, but their music is dancey and listenable and made my car a happier place to exist for multiple hours every week.

11. <strong>""From the Top of the World"" by My Brightest Diamond</strong>.  I listen almost exclusively to dance remixes, hip-hop, pop, and upbeat indie.  But My Brightest Diamond's bizarre swoopy art-rock just mesmerizes me.  This was the best song off her most recent album.  There is also an album of remixes that came out last year (LEFTOVERS!), but most of them kinda suck.  I guess you can never completely take the Tori out of the girl...

10. <strong>Gutter Twins</strong>.  Oh, Greg Dulli and Mark Lanegan.  I never seriously thought you guys would REALLY TRULY FINALLY make that album you'd been talking about for like a decade!  But you did!  And it was OK!  Not great, but pretty good!  And I went to see you in concert, and Lanegan DOES NOT HAVE EYEBALLS!  All of these things make me happy.

9. <strong>""A Thread Cut With A Carving Knife"" by Stars</strong>.  Stars continues to be my #1 choice for soaring power pop.  I wish they had come out with a full album this year, but this song off their tour-only EP will have to suffice.

8. <strong>""Jizz In My Pants"" by the Lonely Island</strong>.  Andy Samberg and his buddies write a better bridge than anyone in the business today.

7.  <strong>""Talons"" by Bloc Party</strong>.  The entire Bloc Party album is superlatively great, on par with their first album rather than their disappointing second.  But ""Talons"" is the song I can't stop playing.  Something about Kele Okerere asking his (male) love interest, ""When did you become such a slut?"" is a real kick in the pants.

6.  <strong>""After Hours"" by We Are Scientists</strong>.  Made me a little wistful for being young and drunk in late night New York City.  But not that much.  Just enough to make the song ring kinda true.

5. <strong>""I Will Possess Your Heart"" by Death Cab For Cutie</strong>.  I was underwhelmed by their album as a whole, but this song is just...amazing.  It takes a full FOUR AND A HALF minutes for Ben Gibbard to even start singing, and the buildup is almost cinematic.  They just added this song to the playlist at my store, and it makes me all swoony.

4. <strong>""No Sex For Ben"" by the Rapture</strong>.  Hey, a song from <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> made it into my top 5!  That's kinda weird.  Whatever.  *bootyshake*

3. <strong>""Love In This Club (MSTRKFT Remix)"" by Usher</strong>.  The original version of this song is super slow-jammy and lame and pretty much sucks.  (Although I have a little bit of a soft spot for it based entirely on the video embedded below.)  But the MSTRKFT remix is AWESOME and makes me sing along like a crazy person and makes my HUSBAND sing along like a crazy person and then all of a sudden the backing track is some weird clavier version of LAYLA and it's fabulous.  The end.

<lj-embed id=""72""/>

2.  <strong>""Everyone Nose (Remix)"" by N.E.R.D</strong>.  Abby hates the new N.E.R.D. album.  I think any album that has a song on it where Kanye calls out Hollywood cokeheads by name can't be ALL bad.  And it's syncopated in a way that hits my happy buttons.

1.  <strong>Feed The Animals - Girl Talk</strong>.  Ludacris rapping over Temple of the Dog?  Busta Rhymes vs ""Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic""?  Missy Elliott works it out to Nu Shooz?  I hope this guy never gets arrested for violating the Millenium Copyright Act and just keeps making silly silly albums for me to dance and laugh to."

"event","OK, I did all my liveblogging over on Facebook tonight, so I'll transcribe it over here.

<strong>5:55 pm</strong> -- All we need is the Kerry states plus IA, NM, and CO. The rest is gravy. Breathe.

<strong>6:12 pm</strong> -- There's a little vein popping out in Pat Buchanan's forehead.

<strong>6:38 pm</strong> -- The Mitch McConnell race is soooooo close!!

<strong>6:40 pm</strong> -- Obama's within 15K votes in Indiana with NO precincts in Lake County yet. This rules.

<strong>7:01 pm</strong> -- Pennsylvania to Obama with 0% returns. Those exit polls must have been a blowout! And NH, too! Start dancing, folks!

<strong>7:32 pm</strong> -- EAT IT LIDDY DOLE!!!!

<strong>8:24 pm</strong> -- Oooooooooohio!!!!!!!

<strong>8:44 pm</strong> -- Maggie is thinking McCain needs to pull an upset in Washington. Think it could happen? If so, I have a lovely bridge you might like to buy..

<strong>8:48 pm</strong> -- Obama's winning Tampa. He's gonna win Florida. I'm just gonna come out and say it. Florida=Obama country.

<strong>8:50 pm</strong> -- The baby is kicking up a storm. Excited about Obama, or strung out on all the Gobstoppers I've been chowing on for three hours? Too close to call.

<strong>9:04 pm </strong>-- He's gonna win VA, and FL, and NC, and IN, and NV, and CO...my god.. 

<strong>9:23 pm</strong> -- Maggie is super jealous of her friends in Grant Park. 

<strong>9:57 pm</strong> -- Chris Matthews is totally creaming himself -- I guess that's why they took him off the air right after calling Ohio, they needed to calm him down a little.

<strong>10:01 pm</strong> -- They just called it! I think Olbermann is crying. They're showing people collapsed in tears in Atlanta and Harlem. This is insane.

<strong>10:03 pm </strong>-- HA HA HA HA MY NEWS FEED JUST WENT FUCKING BERZERKER! There are fireworks somewhere outside.

<strong>10:08 pm</strong> -- Slightly anticlimactic: ""by the way, Virginia went to Obama."" People are crying.

<strong>10:18 pm</strong> -- Jesse Jackson is crying in Grant Park. Guess you don't want to cut his balls off anymore, huh Jesse?

<strong>10:20 pm</strong> -- The McCain crowd is booing Obama. Classy to the end, guys.

<strong>10:45 pm</strong> -- Maggie is now panicking about Prop 8. Gah!

<strong>10:59 pm</strong> -- Awww, Malia took her twists out. I thought Barack thought she looked tight! Why do you lie to Sway, President-elect Obama??

<strong>11:04 pm</strong> -- Oprah is excited that Malia and Sasha get a puppy!!! You get a puppy! You get a puppy! EVERYONE GETS A PUPPY!!!!

<b>11:21 pm</b> -- Is that Michelle's brother that's basketball coach at Princeton? Good lord, he's tall.

<b>11:48 pm</b> -- Maggie is projecting that Obama will pull out Indiana and NC by a fraction of a percent, might yet pull out MO, and MT??

<b>11:57 pm</b> -- David Gregory just pointed out that we don't have any results yet from Alaska, and Rachel Maddow LAUGHED AT HIM. It was LULZtastic.

<b>12:15 pm</b> -- Chris Matthews is getting rowdy, shouting about Bill Richardson's facial hair. Has he been drinking?

<b>12:29 pm</b> -- Maggie is going to go crazy watching the Prop 8 numbers shrink by a tenth of a percent at each refresh.

<b>12:30 pm</b> -- Chris Matthews is now muttering under his breath about how much he loves Cory Booker. Seriously, I think he's drunk!"

"event","OK, so I went over to Real Clear Politics and made my own map of electoral predictions.  

<img src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/phamos818/pic/000byq49"">

The pastel ones are a mix of states that I'm hoping might make the night slightly more interesting -- I think McCain will pull out North Carolina and Georgia in the end (10 hour lines in Atlanta??), but might get surprised by Montana and North Dakota.  I also think that Obama's ground game will make the difference in Missouri and Indiana, and that Charlie Crist's bruised ego at not being chosen as McCain's VP will make the difference in Florida similar to how Jeb being governor made the difference in 2000.  In a state as crazy as Florida, you need to have the state apparatus on your side, and Crist has no intention of going out on a limb for McCain right about now.  Thanks for the extended voting hours, Charlie!!  But I think Ohio and Pennsylvania will go Obama in the end, Nevada's looking like a lock based on early voting numbers, and the registration nightmares I thought we'd see coming out of Colorado and Virginia don't appear to have materialized, so I think he's got those wrapped up, too.  So, as much as I'm totally panic-stricken, in my heart I think we're in good shape.

Some other thoughts on various other races?  I think Saxby Chambliss is going to eat it in Georgia, and good fucking riddance.  I think Mitch McConnell might make it through in Kentucky by the skin of his teeth, and it might honestly be partly from backlash to <a href=""http://pageonekentucky.com/2008/10/31/breaking-more-anti-mcconnell-campaign-material/"">some nasty ads coming down from one of the unions</a>.  Good to know that no one party has a monopoly on ugly homophobia.  I think Franken's going to lose in Minnesota in a squeaker.  I've never thought Franken was a good candidate -- I think it was incredibly egotistical of him to think he would be able to win with all of the baggage he carries.  I think he's a relatively funny guy, and I agree with him on most issues, but 15 years of sitting in 30 Rock coked out of your skull riffing on jokes about rape...that doesn't necessarily translate to rural Minnesota voters.  If it's a very good day, we'll see Darcy Burner come out ahead in Washington, El Tinklenwhozitz kick Michelle Bachmann's botoxed ass in Minnesota, and Gary Trauner win the shit out of Cheney's old seat in Wyoming.  None of them are a sure thing, but man, that would be pretty awesome.  And John Murtha's probably going to lose in Pennsylvania, which I'm not particularly sad about.  Ted Stevens SHOULD lose Alaska, but you never know -- that place is crazysauce.  Kay Hagen's gonna beat Liddy Dole.  Jeanne Shaheen is gonna beat mini-Sununu.  I'm thinking at least one of the two Diaz-whatever brothers in Florida will lose.  And if Prop 8 passes in California, I'm going to have a fucking fit."

"event","<p>I beg you, if you live in a state that allows for early voting, GO VOTE NOW.  This year will have crazy turnout everywhere, and I already personally know of people who have been wrongly removed from the voter rolls.  If you vote early, you may have time to get your registration straightened out.  If you find out at the polls that something has gone wonky, you're stuck filling out a provisional ballot, many of which never get counted.  And that way lies madness.</p><p>Please vote early, and tell everyone you know to vote early, too.  I don't care who they're voting for; this isn't a partisan thing for me.  Passions are running very high in this country right now.  Every person in an early voting state can do their part to make election night go as smoothly as possible and prevent Chris Matthews's and Steve Doocy's heads from actually exploding on air in overexcitement.  As entertaining as that might be.</p><p>Thank you for listening.  Everyone should now go and watch the new Lost preview on YouTube.  Good night, and have a pleasant tomorrow.</p>"

"event","<b>Fun fact for the day:</b>  Hey, you know how Sarah Palin likes to talk about how Alaska is so close to Russia?  Well, I did the math, and it looks like the Palin homestead in Wasilla is about the same distance from the Bering Strait as I am in Madison from my parents' house in Vero Beach, Florida!  *waves* Hi Mom!  I can see your foreign policy qualifications from here!

And to go from Palin's office in Juneau to the Bering Strait?  Why, that's close to 2000 miles -- just a short little jaunt like the one I take every afternoon to visit my sister in Los Angeles!

When I told my geographically-challenged friend Ryan I was moving to Wisconsin, he kinda squinted and said, ""That's near Canada, right?""  Well, sorta, Ryan -- but apparently that proximity is a better asset for my career prospects than my masters degree.  Look out, Ban Ki Moon!  I've got a geographically-stacked resume and some cute spectacles, and I'm coming for your job!"

"event","I'm honestly not surprised <a href=""http://attackerman.firedoglake.com/2008/07/22/macfarlandknowsbetterthanmccain/"">that McCain didn't know that the Anbar Awakening began before the surge even started.</a>  Because, really, the man has recently demonstrated that he doesn't know <a href=""http://www.boston.com/news/politics/politicalintelligence/2008/07/mccain_appears.html"">that Iraq and Pakistan don't share a border</a>, <a href=""http://thinkprogress.org/2008/03/18/campaign-denies-mccains-iranal-qaeda-gaffe/"">that Al Qaida and the Revolutionary Guard aren't exactly best buds</a>, <a href=""http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2008/07/16/mccain-again-cites-current-events-in-czechoslovakia/"">that Czechoslovakia hasn't existed in 15 years</a>, or <a href=""http://thinkprogress.org/2008/06/30/mccain-confuses-sudan-and-somalia/"">that Somalia and Sudan are different countries (themselves separated by a country that's approximately twice the size of Texas)</a>.

No, what I'm shocked by, and PISSED about, is that CBS actually edited this huge mistake right the fuck on out of the interview.  <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDIAsS9VXiM"">They show Katie Couric asking a question about the surge, and then air McCain's response to an ENTIRELY different question.</a>  That is an egregious lack of journalistic integrity.  Can we officially stop talking about the damn liberal media now?  Or are we just going to keep piling on the New York Times for <a href=""http://tpmcafe.talkingpointsmemo.com/talk/2008/07/nyt-editor-who-rejected-mccain.php"">not letting McCain publish an op-ed with no actual content other than taking potshots at Obama</a>?

I'm angry about the state of our political system these days, obviously.  But I'm ashamed by the state of our media.  Especially when <a href=""http://www.dailykos.com/story/2008/7/23/121621/699/626/555667"">Bob Novak's going around slamming into people with his Corvette</a>.  Douchebag of Liberty, hit-and-run perpetrator, indictment avoider, and gainfully employed Fox News commentator.  God bless America.  (Don't even get me started on <a href=""http://mediamatters.org/items/200807170005?f=h_top"">Michael Savage</a> and <a href=""http://www.crooksandliars.com/2008/07/17/jack-cafferty-viagra-is-for-a-medical-condition-birth-control-is-a-lifestyle-choice/"">Jack Cafferty</a> right now.

"event","I would really like it if people would just stop talking about the damn <i>New Yorker</i> cover.  Yes, it may be tasteless and/or destructive, but there are SO MANY MORE important things that we need to be focusing on.  As in, every single one of John McCain's policy positions is either objectionable or nonsensical.  When liberals fuel the fire of a non-issue like the <i>New Yorker</i> idiocy, it's just goading on cable news morons who would much rather talk about salacious stuff like cartoon Obama flag burning than substantive things like McCain's theory of ""magic economics"" where we can balance the budget by slashing taxes, spending more on defense, and getting rid of like $2 in earmarks.  TA-DAH!  But, you know, that would be vaguely complicated to talk about and might require multisyllabic words, so pundits would obviously rather grunt about terrorist fist jabs.  DO NOT ENCOURAGE THEM.  WE DO NOT NEED 10 SEPARATE BLOG ENTRIES ON HUFFINGTON POST WITHIN 2 HOURS ON THE <i>NEW YORKER</i> COVER.

"event","it's so hard to make people happy when each one demands a different part of you, most of the time nothing you do seems to be helping anybody. i feel as though i am a further complication in the problem as opposed to the promising sollution that i aspire to be. if you didn't already have such high expectations of me it wouldn't be such a surprise when i failed. i can't even please you when i am putting aside my own happiness to salvage yours"

"event","<p class=""MsoNormal"">It's almost dark. The sun is setting; a giant red &amp; orange lipstick smear plagues itself along the waters surface. I am wearing headphones but am still able to hear the crashing of the waves against the shore. The tide is coming into the land, slowly creeping its way up the sand. It's too dark to see people's faces, instead, silhouettes glide along the hard wet sand like ghosts without identities. I wonder if they leave footprints ( or are they weightless? )</p>    <p class=""MsoNormal"">The half moon is hidden behind the transparency of thin grey clouds; I see its outline but can't make out its shape. The sun has set, drowned itself deep below the cold surface of the waters until its time to rise again. The sky is black &amp; cold, I am cold too.</p>"

"event","I used to aspire to be anything than what I was. I'd set silly, conciously unattainable goals, shallow aspirations of the person that I wanted to be & the life that I ached to live. Most days I would wake in the morning to strangulation, eyes gripped shut, gasping for air, the violent grip of an indescribable and overwhelming surge of depression fastened securely around my neck.
You map out your life with a pen and paper - first a sketch of your desired persona, then a list of names of the people that you intend to build up the foundation. Without these said individuals the legs on the structure cannot hold up their own weight, they buckle, collapse and give way - you hear a thunderous crash, dust fills the air around you & inevitably you're back to where you first began."

"event","The average person spends their lifetime searching for different things, but all in all their main objective is to find love and to be able to maintain this said love on some sort of cosmological level. The source of the love is irrelevant, as long as it's there. Even if the love is hollow, we find ways to fill it with purpose, to trick ourselves into believing that the sentiment is legitimate. We spend our lives looking for the love that we don't have, the people that we want but fear are impossible to posses and in the process we overlook the love that we already have. Love is unconditional; it is the most powerful emotion that any one human being can recieve and  reciprocate. 

I view the world in a different light. My life experiences and recent discoveries have supplied me with a form of clarity. I feel clean when the rest of the world is dirty. Some days I get caught up in the filth, the dust tangles itself around my ankles, my legs and I fall to the ground to find that my hands are muddy.

There is a light at the end of the eternal tunnel."

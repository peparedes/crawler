"event","Tour de France is over, the podium was kinda predictable, but still the TDF was quite interesting. I'm really looking forward to TDF 2006, it's probably going to be very exciting.
Tomorrow I'm going to the 8 van Chaam, a criterium in the south of the Netherlands. Basso is going to participate, and some other cyclists, but they're not interesting. xD I WANT IT TO BE TOMORROW O_______O

I'm lip balm addicted, but I'm trying to get off it. MUST RESIST....xD"

"event","I went cycling this morning (okay, afternoon, I slept until 12 o'clock or something like that), and because I went cycling I missed the beginning of the Tour, but that's okay since cycling is fun! xD I wanted to go together with a friend of mine, but she wasn't online, so I couldn't ask her. Thus I went alone. But it was still fun. Although it was hot and I didn't really feel well. xD 
And after I went cycling, I watched cycling. 
And after watching cycling, a friend asked me to go cycling with her (the same friend I wanted to ask to go cycling with me xD). So I went cycling. Again. And on my way back from my friend's house to my own house there is one bridge where you have to climb. And I went faster up than down. I'm weird. xD
And later this evening I'm going to watch a programme about cycling.
So a summary of my entire day: go cycling, watch cycling, go cycling, watch cycling.

It takes me a lot of trouble trying to think of what day it is today but I do know today was the 12th stage of the TDF, and that today is 14 July (because that's a national holiday in France, and the commentators of the TDF repeated that a few times xD).
And tomorrow I'm going shopping with a friend. And we want to get back in time, because we don't want to miss the TDF. xD"

"event","The sun came just at the right time ^_________^ We haven't had any rain during the training, so yay to the weather Gods. xDxDxD

Watched stage 4 of the tour today. I was really shocked when Zabrinskie fell. That really must've hurt.
I don't like the outcome of stage 4 of the tour. Armstrong has the yellow jersey. Again. It's really getting monotonous. It would be cool if someone else would win for a change."

"event","I've decided to put more entries on my journal and to find out how I can make a better lay-out (although I don't really like html xD It just takes so much time to make something that looks good). 

I watched the Tour the France today, it was an exciting stage. Too bad Dekker didn't win, but he did get the polka-dot jersey though, and the price for most aggressive rider, two prices he's rightfully earned.
I'm looking forward to tomorrow's stage, I'm quite curious what CSC and Discovery Channel are going to do. But enough about cycling, I don't think there is anyone interested in it, if there are people who actually read my journal, but I doubt there are.


Well, that's really all I have to say/type x'''''D"

DAMN WHY DOES IT HAVE TO BE SO DAMN HOT U____U 
And I have to give skate training tomorrow, and skating+hotness=a very bad, bad combination.
But at least it's weekend, so no school for 2 days, yay ^____^

OMGOMG, the temperature just keeps rising in my room U___U I want air conditioning >_________________<

"event","I went to the Parkfeest (a festival with various artists) in Oosterhout last friday and it was AWESOME! There where some famous Dutch artists, Ali B (Dutch rapper), Birgit (not really famous), and Within Temptation (TEH F*CKING BEST BAND IN THE NETHERLANDS).
When Ali B came up the stage, with some REALLY idiot looking walk, I just couldn't help laughing. It really looked hilarious xD His performance was alright, even though I really hate rap. He was performing together with some other rappers and there were also three people with a guitar sitting on a chair with sunglasses on (and the sun wasn't shining xD). I wanted to say to my friend, ""that one with that hat on really looks dull"", but then I suddenly realized they were al wearing hats or caps (except for the guitarists). Ali B just kept saying between the songs ""Who is in tha house?"" And let the public answer ""Oosterhout"". I think he said it like 50 times.
Next was Birgit, she REALLY, REALLY looked like a whore. And she was really dumb and she couldn't sing. But the band was alright.
And after that came Within Temptation. The stage looked very cool and such, there were all kinds of ornaments on it, and they projected movies on the back of the stage with a beamer. And their performance was great. They were the first artist of which almost I knew all the songs and could sing along with them. And they had fire, really cool and hot xD And Sharon was really cool xD She got some scary bug on her, and one of the other band members removed it, and after another song she looked at the bug and said something like ""He's crushed, the poor creature"" In a really sarcastic way xD Sooooo cool. She 0wns _0_ _0_ (just like the rest of the band).
It was so awesome, I wanna see them again xD


The day after the Parkfeest I had a skating competition. Unfortunately I was the only one in my category, but they let my ride together with a lower category, since letting me ride a 1,5 and 5km alone would be a little harsh xD But now I wish they'd just let me ride it alone since a girl fell right in front of me during the 3km (the lower category had to ride 3km), and I fell because of her xD So now I've got some slight wounds on my left arm, right leg and my chin (and I'm really wondering now how exactly I fell, having wounds on every side of my body xD). AND THAT GIRL THAT HAS CAUSED MY FALL HARDLY HAD ANY WOUNDS. And I'm walking around with a weird looking chin. It just isn't fair xD"

"event","Blah, I went to school today. AND IT WAS BORING! As usual...So I spend almost the entire day being half asleep. But we've got no homework for tomorrow. YAY. 

And yesterday evening I found out that I'll have to finish my book for Dutch by Wednesday. I knew I had to finish that book this week, but somehow I got the idea that I needed to finish it by Friday or something like that. And then I suddenly remembered that I don't have Dutch on Friday, so it would be better to check my agenda. And thus I found out I had just 3 days to read like 150 pages (perhaps that doesn't sound much, but for me it is a lot). And on top of that, I found out the book is really boring. And kinda difficult to understand sometimes. And I'm at page 100 right now, so I probably won't be able to finish it in time. But that's okay, I'll just read some summaries, and hope that that'll be enough.


And I'm really looking forward to the Parkfeest (concert of some artists), Friday next week. There's actually a good band coming. The only GOOD Dutch band to be precise (as far as I know Dutch music, that is). Hail Within Temptation.


That's all I've got to say.. (^,^)"

So, I am kinda struggling with the lay-out right now, and I have absolutely NO inspiration what to do with it, so that's not really working ^^""

And I don't really know what to type here except that Meev's new single is GREAT. Seriously. Meev <3
I really like Freedom Fighters <3 AND HE IS SO FUCKING HAWT IN THE VIDEO *drools*. And I could continue talking about how great Meev is for a long time....but I won't annoy with that xD

Short entry, I know xD But I don't care much about that, this is just to make my journal less empty ^^"

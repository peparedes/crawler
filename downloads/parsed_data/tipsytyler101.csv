Everything is hell for me and it doesnt even seem to phase some people. I thought summer would be fun, but so far its the worst I've been threw in quite some time. All I can say is fuck it, I don't think it's even worth it to get this mad over. Girls are bitches and I doubt thats going to change any time soon. Fuck em

"event","Dear Scot Bohn

Over the last week of December, we took a little road trip to Arizona to record with our good buddy Scot Bohn. With high hopes and a good lump of money invested, we took the chance of going to Arizona to work with Scot. He's a good guy, right?
Recording went well, we got along for the week (except his apartment doubled as an ashtray). We had a good time, and thought everything was fine and dandy. Fantastic, right? (keep in mind how fantastic the 26 hour drive each way was)

This was absolutely fucking fantastic until 4 months later when Scot Bohn of Tempe, Arizona still wouldnt send us our fucking tracks.

So let this go as a notice never to trust anybody in the music business, and more importantly, NEVER TRUST SCOT BOHN.

http://www.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewProfile&friendID=426613&Mytoken=20050422232439

please go there and tell scot bohn what you think of how he fucked us over...

We are currently scheduling a benefit show to regain the money we invested into this fucking worthless con artist. We really put a lot into getting there, and we hope to get at least some of that back.

Love,
Brandon

P.S. I am, and we all are, sorry to be such haters. But nobody fucks with us and gets away with it.

PLEASE HELP US SPREAD THE WORD ABOUT SCOT BOHN. SHOW THIS TO YOUR FRIENDS. FUCK, SHOW THIS TO YOUR ENEMIES. WE NEED YOUR HELP!!!

im at brandons and we watched a lot of porn"

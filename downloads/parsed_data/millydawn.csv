"event","I am home 'sick' when i say'sick' that is i am not sick, but rather sore. I did sport yesterday and i hurt my back. either that or i slept crooked, maybe it was both? Anyway that's not what i came on here for.
 
I was speaking with josh before as he is home sick too and about my mum and how our relationship has changed so much since primary school. Firstly, I thought of mum as my Gaurdian, like the person who took care of Samantha and I, someone who fed us, helped us with our homework and nagged us to clean our rooms. 

Then she became like someone i had to protect when i started high school. I felt like because my father wasn't around, i had to watch out for her. And we had many fights over the fact i was being too protective and when she met new poeple i found myself wanting to know everything about them so they wouldn't her mum. 

Then i backed off and she became my mum again, nagging me to do my homework and be nice to my sister as all mothers do.

And just recently it dawned on me that our relationship has changed once again.

We've become friends.
Instead of her being the one that bosses me around and looks after me, she's become an equal. We have a better understanding now i think. We gossip and whinge together. Like we're both teenagers (well I am , but, you know) We still fight, sure who doesn't? But It's different. She tries to see my side of things more now, and we usually come to an agreement or a compromise, and then there's those times where i'm totally out-of-line and it's just straight out no. But fair enough... 

And if we do make a compromise or whatever, she gives me reasons why i can't do that, or why she doesn't want me going out. Which is really good. Because now i know her reasoning, i can figure out if she will think about my proposal or just say no. 

I think one of the best thngs about us being equal is mum treats me with more respect now, not that she didn't before but, hmmm, maybe it's a different kind of respect. Now every one who knows me well enough wil be reading this thinking-hhhmm i wonder what sparked this whole thing so i will tell you; I was talking to mum about how strong she is putting up with all this Shit phil and shane (the house invaders as i prefer to call them) have been causing, and she came out with ""Amelia, you're too wise for your years""... and i was just blown away by it.

Usually, ok when i started high school, she would have said, ""you are 13 going on 30! Now im a big girl i can look after myself!""

Also, those who know me would say. Wait an i in the wrong journal here? Amelia, wise? Surely not! But im being serious! So right now im going to go and finish my homework. 

Amelia-

ps: another thing that has changed is that Mum is now really nice to Alex... which is really cool."

"event","You know how on the sides of packing boxes there's stickers that say'This side up'? Well if my life was a box, there'd be two stickers, both a contradiction of the other.
Today i felt like crying, so i did. It felt good to let it all out for once, i have no idea why i cried exactly, but i did. But i felt stupid too. Firstly- (Camille, Elle or Josh-sorry about going all sappy and emotional on you today, you guys have your own tings to worry about) I feel kinda weird about crying at school. And secondly I feel even weirder about crying about nothing in particular! Any way it was really strange, i was having a whinge with Josh about how shit my week has been, and how i'm sick of things and the house invaders and i was sorta just wallowing in self-pity and then the more i thought about it, i actually started to cry, and it just kept going... And i kept thinking more about the shit parts of my life etc... and (even though there really is't too much negative things in my life)i just thought about how nothing works. And my crappy school photo which i received today was like the last straw... I hate it. It does not represent me at all! It looks nothing like who I am! At all.. and i resemble a farm animal. which made me think of things Brad said and, well that made things hugely worse. I know i'm not supposed to ""hate"" anyone but i honestly do hate Brad. Or maybe i just hate the way he treats people? You tell me... 

Anyway... i have a million (exaggeration- a hundred million) things to do right now...mostly homework. I have homework for every subject except science! How disgusting is that? So i will end this entry with:
a smile and a whisper of hope that i might do well at school this year if i actually try...

"event","Heres the review of what happend to me in the year 2004, since its about to be 2005.

[January]: This was the month I started losing interest in WWE(pro wrestling). I had been a huge WWE fan since 1999, at this point I started to lose interest in it.

[Febuary]: This month I was having a ton of problems with my ex girlfriend (alex). Lots of fighting about different things, I tried to hold it together. But time would prove more powerful.

[March]: I totally stopped watching WWE by now. All my daily attention wask keeping Alex and myself together.

[April]: This month I went to Niagra Falls, Canada with my brother whose in the Marines and is stationed in northern New York.

[May]: This was the last month I had a mohawk. My mohawk was red and blue! This is also the month I broke up with my 6 month long girlfriend, Alex. I went through about 4 days of depression. Plus an extra 5 days of recovering. After that...I felt so independant and powerful. It was pretty cool. I didnt feel no pressure to try and be perfect anymore.

[June]: Well lets see, I finished 10th grade. I went to ROTC SLS. I started hanging out with Kate, Mary, and Brian 98% of the time. Good month.

[July]: July is when Kate, Mary, Amanda, and I would hang out even more. Brian moved. Joe was never home. We would go to the bike trail alot this month. Fourth of July came and went.

[August]: Brian visited once during this month. Myself,Amanda, Kate, and Mary went to the bike trail alot. I turned 17. I wanted summer to last longer.

[September]: I went back to school. Mary, Kate, and I went on the bike trail and wound up in Glassboro.

[October]: I started to go out with Kristin. I was already tired of school. This was basically a boring month. Halloween was cool.

[November]: Started to get chilli this month. I spent most of my time online. George Bush won the election. I wanted John Kerry to win.

[December]: I didnt feel any kind of connection between Kristen and I, so I decided we should brake up, and we did. I hung out with Janna for the first time. I got my drivers permit. I baked alot of cookies. It was Christmas and I got the OC DVD set for Season 1."

Ok, I can't stand when parents buy their kids clothes without even taking the kid to see if they like it. My mom manages to do this every once in while. She'll buy me a dorky looking shirt or something, and shell be like ""Do you like it?"" And I'll say ""No, i told you not to buy me clothes, just let me continue to buy my own clothes"" And she'll say ""ok"". Three months later she'll buy me something else and say ""i forgot"". Parents of the world. Let your kids choose their clothes. My mom has bought me tons of clothes I havent worn yet, and will never wear."

"event","I hate dictators. They suck. Its totally wrong for one man to rule an entire nation with full control and he can kill anyone for any reason. Dictators are ass. The word dictator came from the latin words 'dic' meaning DICK ASS MOFO and the word 'tator' meaning ONE WHO SHOVES POTATOS UP HIS ASS. And this what people like Saddam Hussain and Adolf Hitler did..people like kings and shit..since they all were dick ass mofos who shoved potatos up their asses, they became dictators.  If you do not beleive me, then you need to start watching educational films more often."

"event","Since today is the day JFK was killed inm 1963 lets rant about his assassin. The person who shot JFK is a fucking retard. How could you kill such an awesome president? I mean he helped give equality to African Americans. He was awesome. All we was doing was riding down the street in a car...and some asshole dumbass has to go and shoot him. Good job..you killed an awesome president..i hope you're proud of yourself. Lee Harvey Oswald is the man who shot JFK if my memory serves me correct.. maybe it wasnt him...could of been those communist...we'll never know. But whoever did it sucks. JFK assassin..i hope you're reading this, because you ruined the 60s by doing that."

"event","A few months prior to her death, Princess Diana confessed that the strain of her marriage had caused her to throw herself down the staircase and cut herself with razors, penknives, and lemon cutters.  Why would a princess, who was admired by the whole world for her beauty, grace and compassion, turn upon herself and assault her body in this manner? ...Because she was being a fucking dumbass. As you probobly know there are many people out there who cut their wrists and other body parts because they have 'stress' or 'mental pain'. WTF is that shit? And cutting into your body with sharp objects doesnt cause you pain? Seriously if you have a problem then solve it a real way. Dont do it the retarded way. They honestly feel cutting will solve the problem,it doesnt solve it, it makes it worse. They continue cutting away. All you cutters have some wierd fucking problems. My opinion on the situation.. 98% of cutters out there do it for attention."

"event","The math in New Jersey schools is so retarded. I hate math. But even if you like math you will agree with me on this one. The math taught in New Jersey schools is pointless to the lives of average americans. How many people make graphs and use the Y and X axis grids in their daily lives? Not many. Schools should teach how to write checks and stuff. Schools should only teach common math(add, subtract, multiply, divide). Seriously thats all we need, but New Jersey's board of education inists that the crap we're doing is more important. They even made it a requirement to pass the math part on the state's HSPA test. God help us all."

"event","Mankind has been hunting for thousands of years for survival. Today you can just go and buy your meat in a super market. Many people today hunt just for sport. They dont to hunt for meat...they can buy it. But they hunt for sport. I think hunting for sport is very uncool. Its almost sick. Sports hunters just go out in the woods with their rifles and shoot helpless animals for example a deer. How can people just shoot an animal that has never done anything to hurt you? Seriously...its bad enough that humans outnumber deer by like 5,000,000 to 1. This continent use to be full of deer, now the number is like dwindling because of sports hunting. Hunting for sport isnt cool. Its not. Its still not. Just go to the store and buy some chicken, seriously. Just think about those hunters hunting animals because its ""fun"". Would you like a deer to come walking down the street with a rifle and shoot you for 'sport' ? I think not. Case closed. Point made."

So a movie showed a woman's boob...who cares? These movies arent going to make your kids into murderers and perverts. I've been watching these types of movies since I was 2, and I turned out fine. Seriously, all you parents that dont let your kids watch ""bad"" movies are doing a bad thing to your kids. They're going to grow up as minorities because all the other kids can watch whatever they want. Your kids are going to be teased and picked on for this. Honestly, those ""bad"" movies you wont let your kids watch are more realistic than the Brady Bunch."

"event","Poser punks. They are quickly outnumbering the real punk culture. Punk is not good charlotte and skateboards. Punk started back in the early 1970s in CBGB's in NYC. Before this time the word punk was just given to uncommon youths by old people. With the Ramones new type of rock, journalists started to call their music ""Punk Rock"". This is how the name came along. From there punk culture was the underground. Dress your own way. Try to stay away from the major labels. The punk culture stayed alive and real by bands like the Ramones, Sex Pistols, and the Clash during the 70s. It remained alive in the 80s to bands like the Dead Kennedys. Rancid kept punk alive in the 90s. More recently bands like The Casualties and Dropkick Murphys are keeping the punk flame burning. Now back to the poser punks. Poser punks are the kids that listen to FAKE punk like Good Charlotte and Simple Plan. How these kids believe they are punk bands is beyond me. They extremely mainstream and signed with a major label the first offer they got. These poser punk kids dont even know the bands that helped make punk. They probobly never even heard of CBGB(its the place where punk started). You poser punks out there try to hard. Step 1: Try not to be punk, just be who you are, dont conform to anything. Theres some more steps but you can figure them out byself like you should. If I had every student from my school go into a room and I asked ""All punks raise your hand!"" About 400 kids would raise there hand...now the sad part is, only about 3 out of those 400 kids would actually know what real punk is. I'm sorry but all you fake punks out there need to GTFO."

"event","For the 4th rant I decided to rant about swingers. Incase you dont know, swingers are married people who sometimes have sex with people they're not married to freely. I find this disgusting and horrible. If you really love someone you wont care to fuck someone else and you wouldnt let your partner fuck someone else either. Swining it fucked up and is for sick fucks who fucking suck ass because they are cheating fuckers. Swingers fucking such much those fuckers all they do is fuck like swingers with other fucking swingers who also fuck. Thats fucking fucked up. Whats this fucking world coming to. Fuck those fucking swingers for doing what they do by basically cheating with their partner's consent. Married people should only fuck each other. Fuck all you swingers. K thx."

"event","Racism is so retarded. Yes, I myself was once a little racist but I realized I was wrong I broke away from that beleif. I hate racism. Honestly, you cannot say all arabs are terrorists. You cannot say all blacks are criminals. You cannot say that all whites are greedy. I know many blacks who are not criminals. I know that only a small percent of arabs are terrorists. I know about every human in the world has some greed in them. Again, racism is stupid and you should realize it sooner or later because most of the stereotypes are not even true.  You can hate black people all you want, it wont make them turn white. You're wasting your time by hating groups. If I had to judge a group by something stupid they do, then I would have to hate every single race,sex, and religion in the world because all people have done something that someone else might not like in the past. Face it, racism is stupid and it should die like right now. Thats all................................................yuh."

"event","Its time to rant about something that bothers me and many of my fellow students...school dress codes. What the hell is with school dress codes in my school? Girls cant wear short skirts, goths cant wear their spiked bracelets. Just let people dress how they want. Seriously, schools are bitching guys cant concentrate when a girl has on a sleeveless shirt..so they think a girls arm is going to give me an erection and distract me? I think not! Another thing in my school is our backpacks have to be seethrough. They feel we're going to bring a gun in school and shoot everyone. This isnt Columbine, its Williamstown High School. If I wanted to bring a gun to school I could hide it in a seethrough backpack too, just stuff it between two textbooks. Last year and this year I've been using a solid non-transparent backpack. They've yelled at me twice. I still use it. If you want me to go and use your god damned transparent backpacks then you go out and by me one because I cant find them. The first humans walked around completely naked and we cant even show a little arm or leg? Face it, school dress codes suck and should be a little more less strict."

"event","Ok this is the first entry and rant for this journal. This is not any journal. This is my ""RANT JOURNAL"" where I rant about all the things and people that suck. If I say something on here sucks then I am correct. Now for my first rant I am going to rant against all the guys who hate homosexuals. Ok now...what the hell is wrong with you? You hate homosexuals just because they stick their penises in other men's asses? Who cares? They were born that way just like you were born straight. They deserve the same respect as anyone else. I cant tell you how many dickweeds in my school are all ""McGreevey is the worst govenor because hes gay"". Are you fucking stupid? The more gay men there is, the better it is for straight men. Think about it...the more homosexual men there is out there..the more women there is out there for the straight men. Stop your pissing and moaning. And whats with Bush and other Republican Americans being all ""GAY PEOPLE CANT BE MARRIED""? No, they should be allowed to get married. Then you have the religious nuts saying its a sin to be gay just because the bible says so....the bible was written over 1,000 years ago when homosexual guys were not open with their sexuality so there was basically very few gay men. Of course its going to say that. If you hate gay people then I hope a big gay man named Alice comes along one night and fucks you in the ass. K thx I win."

<lj-cut text=""Dear..."">Shia-

I love you, seriously. You're a fellow jew and you are (despite many reports), a pretty good actor. This being said, please, PLEASE don't screw up Indiana Jones. This is probably the greatest thing that will ever happen to you. Harrison Ford is not getting any younger, and by the time Spielberg get's his head out of his ass, it could be too late.  Plus, I've been waiting for this installment since I was six. I know that you're probably feeling the pressure, and are fully aware of how this film is one of those one's that have legions of fans waiting to villify anyone who fucks it up. I mean, look at what happened to Hayden Christenson! Sure he got to have sex with Sienna Miller and got to play Bob Dylan (or, someone 'Dylanesque'), but who hasn't? You're riding high right now my friend. You're becoming an 'It' kid in the scene and most people really, really like you. But, let's be honest here: this film is going to make or break you. It will be the most important venture you will ever embark on. You've got great people backing you up--Cate, Harrison, Ray Winstone---great, great people. And everyone knows it. SO if anything goes wrong, you are automatically going to be the one to blame. I will be here to support you, because if it's going to be anyone's fault it will be Spielberg or Harrison breaking a hip. In closing, Shia, ""The Beef"". ""Beefinator"", ""LeJew"", muster each fiber of good acting you have in that curly haired brain of yours, and do not fuck this up. 

Thank you and godspeed-
Rachael Haigh.

"event","So I just came from Kelee's. I dunno, it kind of sucked. 

It was my last day seeing her before I go back to school and she just didn't seem...all there. Maybe I expect too much. I brought her flowers and she didn't even seem to care all that much. Then she said some really mean things to me and I said one thing to her and she got upset. It wasn't even mean. She has this thing where she sometimes kisses me and jams her face into mine. It hurts, there's nothing passionate or whatever about it. So I told her ""do you have to mash into me? it kind of hurts"" and she got all upset.

Maybe I didn't phrase it as well as I could have but it annoyed me. Then when I was leaving for the night, because she got into her bed and said ""I'm tired"" so I figured it was time to leave, she kept trying to get me to stay. I finally got a little frustrated and was like ""Can I go please?"" just because I wanted to freaking let her sleep. 

I hate goodbyes. Goodbyes are the worst, but she always seems to fricken drag them out and make them way more painful than I think they have to be. Whatever.

I'm going to miss her, I know that, but I just get the feeling, like I've had a lot in the past, that we're not going to last all that much longer.

On another note Sarah and I are pretty much done being friends I guess. I mean I'm still open to whatever but she never talks to me, doesn't return my emails, is never online, and just doesn't seem to want to put any effort in. Maybe we'll start talking again later but I guess it's pretty much dying out. I can't really say it's my fault anyway. Well I could in a sense that I was the only one who really wanted us to be friends in the first place so maybe it's my fault for trying to force her into it. I did kind of guilt her into talking to me.

Whatever the case, I'm a big boy now and I can move on.

I talked to Mark and he said that I'm just not a strong enough player. At first glance of his email I was VERY discouraged but then I read it a couple of more times (it's amazing how when you read something important you scan it the first time to get the jist of it and then REALLY read it the second or third time) and it seemed better. He was trying to be very supportive and helpful and I like that. I knew my impression of him was right. He's a great guy and really tries to work with everyone.

So he said I need to practice 10 hours a week. So far I've been practicing 7 so I'm going to up it to 11. This semester is going to be way different from last, I've already decided. It's about time I get my shit all together and part of that is being really serious about why I'm at school, music.

No more smokin pot all the time and fucking partying every weekend. I'm going to weather the cold and the walk and be up at Butler all the fucking time practicing my ass off. If I have my own room, especially in Pinecrest, this will all be much easier because I can have my own schedule and do my own thing. Plus it sucked having the farthest possible dormroom from the building where I had most of my classes.

I have my schedule mapped out (well most of it, minus the spring musical and Symphonic band) for this semester and so far it doesn't seem all that bad. So I'll have to put in time to work out at Keltchner with Tom and practice for everything. It should be fun.

Either way I have to finish packing now and get my shit ready so I can fly out tomorrow. My flight is pretty early but that's the way it goes. 

I dunno if it's going to work out for me this summer, I really hope it is. Everyone says I have a really good shot and we'll see. Later."

"event","Wow this shit has changed a lot. LJ used to be much different. I had one a long, long time ago, and yes, I am proud to be of the generation that made this, MySpace, Facebook, and beyond, the ""thing"" to do.

What can I say, I just miss being able to type out my thoughts and keep them in a journal. So let's get to it.

This morning (I mean Friday morning) I woke up and looked at my cell phone. I was in the basement so there was no reception although I could see that Verizon somehow sent me the voicemail notifications. I got all my crap together and went upstairs to find Jason. Surely he was still asleep ""I told you I would sleep until you got me"" great host.

I drove back to NJ, stopping at a rest stop on the way. The Mexican lady at the counter was a big bitch when I said ""I'd like a cheese pizza please"" and she's like ""they'll be ready in seven minutes"" in a nasty tone. I'm sorry, I thought the pizzas were supposed to be either out there BEFORE I get there, or ordered on demand but I guess neither was the case.

Not a big deal though, I actually had to kill some time so Anthony and his girlfriend could clean their place before I got there.

I drove there, got a little lost (not really lost, more like misplaced) on the way. We chilled for a while. It's so funny because he drank two Natty Ices and he was fucking done. It was quite amusing. He went on this rant about the Trojan horse and how he can't believe the Spartan motherfuckers fell for it...very interesting.

Then I left and went to Kelee's house. She's mad at me because on New Year's I got pissed and told her all the shit that bothered me about her. Well her friend, who just got back from Oman, found out that one of their mutual friends had killed himself so it wasn't a good night to talk about all this.

So instead, Kelee and I watched a bunch of episodes of ""That 70's Show"" and I felt her up trying to get her ""in the mood."" Granted she told me off the bat that she didn't want to mess around because she wasn't in the mood and I guess it was insensitive but I kept touching her until she told me it was ""creepy."" 

She owes me head though and I haven't found the right time to bring it up and when I get horny and haven't seen her for a few days I start to get all touchy feely but it was too much, I'll admit.

After that I picked up Shawn, Spyro, Doug, Demetri, and Greener and stuffed them all in my car and went to IHOP. It was fun. Then we drove back to town, used the bullhorn on a few houses of people we all mutually don't like, and then I dropped everyone off.

At Anthony's we made plans to go to Niagra Falls this March so hopefully that will all happen. I dunno, we'll see.

Tomorrow is practicing Mello and checking through all the boxes upstairs and cleaning it all out. Then the World Inferno show in NY. It's going to be fun.

Later."

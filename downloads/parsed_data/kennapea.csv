George passed away on Monday. 
I have no other words on that right now. 
He had no living will or power of attorney on file, so his parents got everything. 
they got to make health decisions. they get his remains. 
but i had him. they will never get that.

last i heard, they're trying to have me investigated so they can blame me legally. it won't do anything.
the only thing i ever did was love George.

i feel broken right now, and the worst part is that i'm left with expenses. we had shared bills that were all in my name. are in my name. i have bills that i can no longer afford.

we were also planning to get his and hers tattoos this month or next. that didn't happen.
so, i'd like to get both. that way i'll have him under my skin, so to speak, forever.

if you can/want to donate, i'd be so grateful. if you can't or don't want to, that's okay, too.

thank you, guys.

"event","- i'm unemployed and out of school right now. i've been randomly volunteering for planned parenthood which is a blast. love them. i quit victoria's secret for...reasons. while part of me is kinda sad and misses it, the majority of me says ""good riddance!"" ever since management changed, things had gone down hill. oh well.

- i completed my first degree. it's try over there <-- part of my is proud of myself; part of me thinks, ""this took you way too long to complete, health crap or no, and you still have so many more years to go"". oh well.

- friday was george's birthday. my sister and i took him to the casino for all-you-can-eat seafood buffet (he's been craving crab but there are surprisingly few places around here to get a good amount of cracked crab for under an arm and a leg), a little gambling, and scotch. 
he thought the fun ended there. our birthdays are really close together (16days) and he doesn't have any family up here so our birthdays kinda get lumped together into my birthday, plus george. a couple of years ago he mentioned how he'd never had a surprise party - in fact, his parents had only ever thrown him 3 birthday parties ever. so a few months ago i decided i needed to. with the help of his coworkers and my sister, i've planned this party for months now and was certain at points that he knew what was going on or at least that there WAS something going on.
last night, he thought he was going to one of his coworker's houses to play D&D (which they do regularly) but instead showed up to a party just for him. i made taco stuff and cupcake pushpops, and a pitcher of hop, skip, and go nakeds (vodka, dos equis beer, and lemonade - he loves it) and he got hammered. he felt like crap today, but he said it was the best party he'd ever had - not that three kiddie parties are much competition, but i'll take it. 
i really wish i'd gotten more pictures.

- i'm kind of done with my mother again. my little brother has been living with george and i since he was kicked out/ran out from his dad's house. his dad had him grounded for the previous 6-9 months before he left and treated him like crap. like he's a criminal. he has his faults, but he's a really good kid. a good person with a really good heart. yes, he smokes weed and cigarettes. yes, he drinks. yes, he wreaked his truck. yeah, he's unemployed over something stupid. but he's also 18 and the product of a really shitty home and parents. our mother likes to call and talk shit about him to me a lot. which really pisses me off for several reasons. she's not exactly the model parent and never has been. she raised cody to be her ""little prince"" and spoiled him horribly - until she got bored of that and turned on him. she likes to yell and brow-beat her kids. and to top it off, she decided one day that she wanted to go move to a different town with a guy she just met and made cody go live with his abusive father. his father said that they only way he'd let that happen is if she signed away any of her parental rights. so. she did. she abandoned him and he took it hard. she still says she was right to do so because cody told her she could and that anytime she tried to defend him from his father, he would get upset. yeah. that's a symptom of abuse. and he was 14. 
so now it's to the point where cody doesn't call her and rarely answers his phone when she calls. i understand that, but she says it's because he's a little prick. whatever. 
i don't recall if i mentioned it here or not (and i'm too lazy to open another tab and look it up) but earlier this year my mother talked me into letting cody's ex-fiance move in with george and i because her father had kicked her out (it turns out that was really her fault). while she was here she lied constantly, refused to look for a job, didn't pay any rent, didn't pay for her groceries, didn't clean, was mean to our dog, had creepy guys stalking our apartment door, etc. our deal however (besides her paying $150 in rent each month - $200 and i'd handle her groceries, too [i thought it was a reasonable deal...]) was that when cody needed to move in (he planned to after he graduated) that she needed to move out. however, when cody and his dad has their falling out (admittedly before he graduated) and needed to move in, she got pissy about it. at first she told me it would be okay with her if he slept on our couch. no no no. HE'S family. she's not. and to top it off, the reason she moved in here in the first place is because she told my mother she didn't have anyone else. that's a lie. she has TONS of people but she knew that they'd make her do things like dishes and get a job and babysit and she didn't like that. she told my mother that i told her she had a day to ""get her shit out of our house"". i gave her a week. anyhow! cody wants nothing to do with her and i could live a happy life without seeing her face ever again.
yesterday, cody found out from her boyfriend (cody's ex-bff because she's got that much class) and her that our mother took them our for dinner and lent her money a couple weekends ago. cute, right? i knew she talked to her on the phone and texted and ""facebooked"" with her, but seriously. my mother used to get so angry when her ex's mother talked to his ex (who they have a grandkid with) and was LIVID that we kept in touch with cody's grandparents after she divorced his dad (they'd been our grandparents for 15 years and they STILL send birthday and christmas cards) to the point that she didn't speak to me for 6months, but being ""mommy"" to cody's backstabby little ex is okay? he had to find out about it from them. that's got to feel great especially when she never has time for her own kids. 
so. i'm done. at least for a while. i know she hates that i stick up for cody, but she raised us to believe that family is important and that family comes first. i guess that doesn't apply to her and her kids. 
ugh.

- i applied to western washington university for winter quarter. i'm just waiting to hear back from them. i'm essentially just one large ball of nerves.

- we were looking for a new place to live, but i had to put it on hold because we had to renew our lease or pay $150 more month to month. this place isn't worth it. it's not worth what we DO pay. so, i'll hold off. but meanwhile our neighbors are driving me insane. the chick upstairs has really loud parties until around 5am every few nights (weekends, weeknights, it doesn't matter) where people puke and piss off the balcony above ours, have fights in the parking lot, and blare really bad music while i'm (or at least george)trying to sleep. she also has a really squeaky mattress and is horrible at faking orgasms. at 3am, noon, 2pm, 11pm, etc. i almost feel bad for her, but i really don't. she's had the cops called on her several times (twice by me!) but management won't kick her out. i've gone in to talk to them and they say they're doing everything they can and they just need adequate reason to kick her out, but...she's still there. the woman in the management office asked me if her kid is around for all of this or if she takes him to a babysitter. i told her there is no kid living up there. she said she's supposed to have a 3-year-old kid and that maybe he's just quiet and i haven't noticed him. there's no kid living with her. 100% certain. 
i just really want to move. george has his eye on these condos downtown - which would be really nice if i get accepted in to western because it's a much shorter bus ride everyday - but we have to wait for them be listed and hope that whoever owns it allows pets. the building is wheelchair accessible, really nice, the smaller units are in our price range, it's right downtown within walking distance to everything, etc. it's just that most of them don't allow pets. fingers crossed that they have pet-friendly openings around february.

- i've been drawing more. i really wish i had the money for art supplies because i'd like to paint again as well, but our budget is so tight right now. george's party was the last of my money for a long while.

- i have a kidney infection right now. my doctor put me on antibiotics, but i don't think they're doing the job for obvious, gross reasons i won't put on you. i have things i want to do this week, though, so i'm trying to pull through without going to the hospital. we'll see how long that lasts.

i guess that's pretty much it. and now, bed! we're watching my sister's dog, Mister, and he refused to go to bed with george hours ago, so he's snoring next to me. it's time to get him into a bed now."

"event","this is a total cheater recipe.
it's something i can get all the ingredients to at trader joe's, toss it all together, and viola.
i've taken it to two picnic/bbq things this summer, and i really like it (way more than your typical pasta salad.
it's also a great ""oh crap, what do i have in the fridge??"" recipe.

Ingredients:
1 package cooked bite-sized pasta (shells, rotini, farfalle, fusille, etc.)
1 jar trader joe's bruschetta sauce
1 jar marinated artichoke hearts, quartered and drained (reserve liquid)
1 container marinated fresh mozzarella balls, quartered
1/2 cup chopped olives (green, kalamata, black, or mixed) (optional*)
1/2 package dry salami or pepperoni, chopped (optional*)

Directions:
seriously? cook the pasta, chop the stuff, and toss it all together. if for some reason it's too dry for you, add a splash of the reserved artichoke marinade liquid.

*feel free to add these or leave the out if you don't like olives or if you're vegetarian. 

i don't usually cheat on recipes this much, but it's a nice one to have when needed, and people love it."

the last time i was in school i had to drop classes just to retake and drop them again.
i was beginning to feel optimistic about the state of my kidney until a couple weeks ago when it landed me in the hospital again.
""nervous"" does not even begin...

george and i just got our new couch.
we're forever broke (again) but at least we have somewhere to curl up and be broke now.

my stomch is in knots.


on friday i am to find my way to seattle somehow to meet up with family for a reunion weekend.
everyone's too busy to give me a ride, so i'll have to skip my second day of classes and bus my way there.
i understand that everyone has to work and that i'm inconvenient, when will people understand that...i have to work and to attend classes and that they're equally inconvenient for me?
part of me wants to just skip this weekend, but i wont.
i'm expected. for some reason.
besides, everyone knows how much i love camping. sleeping outside is my life...

okay. i'm done complaining now.. 

knots."

"event","A Cody and Sidney have been trying to work on rebuilding their relationship.
Meanwhile Cody and his fiance Brittany broke up.
He was having doubts that she was the one for him and with as unhappy as she'd seemed to be with him lately, he wasn't sure he was right for her either.
Then he crashed his truck. With an open beer can in the cab. And his pipe in the glovebox. The cop liked that.
He and Brittany are together again, but are working things out before they resumer their engagement.
But back to Sidney and Cody.
She's been trying to call him and text him for a while now, but he never answers or returns calls/texts.
It's not just her - I have to call him a million times to reach him.
But she's been trying.
She even called Dough to get him to call her.
I never thought she'd ever talk Dough again.

So, she came to visit me in the hospital today when he called.
We'd just been talking about going to see the Atomic Bombshells' 'Lost in Space!' in October.
We wanted to take him last time but he was too young - now he's old enough for the 17+ showing.

This conversation then insued:
Sidney on phone to Cody: ""if you keep in touch with us, we have something fun we want to do in October. You'll like it.""
Me: ""It involves science-fiction and scantily-clad ladies!""
Sidney: ""Kenna says it involves science-fiction and scantily-clad ladies. And tassels and glitter!""
Cody: ""Camels and glitter??""
Me and Sidney: ""LOL!!""

"event","i absentmindedly chewed on a sucker for the past half-hour or so, half watching a movie, half scouring the internet for something new, before noticing that i've just been gnawing on the stick.
i haven't even taken the wrapper off.
side note: i think i'm going through a teething phase.


anyhow.

i had surgery on thursday.
tuesday was my Big Day of Unfun Tests and Stuff at UW.
after the full battery of unfun things, they asked if i could come back on thursday for surgery.
as it turned out, i could.
they removed the ureteral stent the asshat of a Urologist put in last year.
supposedly, they're only supposed to stay in place for 3 months before being changed out or removed.
i've had mine for 8 months.
the doctor at UW and i talked about some options for the future (which includes a bigger surgery soon and talking to the renal specialists to see if my system is in a condition where i'd be approved for a kidney transplant if it came down to it - just planning for the future/if worse comes to worst) and she decided that the first step was to get the stent out ASAP.

so, i went down on thursday and checked in.
i have no problem with surgeries, big or small; in fact, i kind of like them.
you go in, they make you take a nap, you wake up on the mend.
even the insomniac in me loves the idea.
the only problem is my veins.
at the local hospital, they've gotten used to putting in a PICC line IV for every occasion, even short stays, because they can't find decent veins for regular IVs.
but i've gotten to the point where i LOVE PICC lines, even with the risks involved.
however, UW does not place PICCs for short stays.
so, instead, they poked and poked and poked and brought other people in to poke and when they realized that they weren't going to be able to get an IV started, they left the room to confab on how they were going to sedate me without an IV. or how to get enough of an IV to sedate me. or sedate me enough to get an IV to sedate me.
that last on might sound silly to some, but that was what they went with.
they gave me an intramuscular shot of ketamine to drop me into sedation and were able to get an IV in a fairly painful spot on my arm.

side note: it take 5mg of ketamine to drop my ass.
side note 2: i hate ketamine.
waking up from that plus whatever else i was given is horrible.
it's like waking up totally detached from your physical self and the world around you but still aware enough to be really bothered by that fact.
then slowly, you are aware of your mind. your brain. your ""self"". 
a few things around you, voices and a vague awareness of light, come into focus.
lungs. heart. a strange awareness of internal organs. and the feeling of being pulled out of nothing into utter discomfort.
someone to the left has evidently noticed that your body is awake and has decided that it's a great time to start asking you questions, but you can't answer because you have no face.
the whole time i find that my brain becomes way too philosophical and almost like being apparently cut off from the outside puts it into panic mode.
i kept thinking about the book A Wrinkle in Time, the tesseracting scenes, and wondering if ms. l'engle had ever experienced ketamine.

i know there are those who do ketamine for fun, but i assume that a) they're working with a different dosage than me and b) are strange people who like uncomfortable underwear.

aside from the anesthesia, all went well.
the food at UW is amazing for a hospital, and the staff is wonderful.
i'd just like to find a way around the whole IV issue next time and it'll be perfect."

"event","i've been having a hard time regulating my sleep lately.
i'm busy during the day - with cody and brittany's stuff (photoshoot and party) and also around the apartment - but even on days where i seemingly wear myself out, i still can't sleep (either at a reasonable time or duration).
i've been taking meds to force sleep, but that's a very bad habit to continue.
i had ambien for a while but when it ran out i started up with muscle relaxers and benedryl again.
the nights i don't take anything turn into mornings (and days) that i just don't sleep.
my mother is giving me a ride to seattle for a battery of tests on my kidney and we'll be stopping at her new place in carnation to spend the night.
i know that'll mean having to drug myself in order to be even somewhat rested for testing the next day.
for the rest of the week i'm going to try not taking anything and see if i can try sleeping naturally at least a little.
luckily, i'm not on the schedule at work this week (well, besides the whole not making money thing...).

while it may sound dramatic, i don't know that i know what it feels like to drift off to a natural sleep.
i know what it feels like to wade through the doped drowsiness of various medications.
i know what it feels like to be in an uncomfortable limbo between wake and sleep.
i know the frustration of jolting awake only minutes after ""falling asleep"".

i can't remember the last time i went to bed without at least a little anxiety, and i know that's only perpetuating the problem.
i wish that sleep wasn't necessary, but at the same time, i like sleep.
once i'm there, it's fantastic (if only in retrospect).

relying on meds for sleep (though in a round about way) is dangerous.
meds quit working as they once did and while i might know/understand/realize that upping doses is a very bad idea, the sleep-deprived mind specializes in bad ideas.
what seems absurd at 10pm seems brilliant 12 frustrating hours later.
not to mention that finally getting some rest at 6am and waking at noon just throws my schedule off even more, so mostly, i just don't.
you'd then think that i'd crash into bed that night, but by then i'm working on an 8th wind, even more frustrated and desperate and with that much more anxiety.

i had a therapist who said that my sleep issues are related to me having post-traumatic stress disorder, but he never bothered to give me any viable solutions (or to try to pinpoint what i was/am so post-traumatically stressing over).
my primary doctor has time and time again recommended exercises that ultimately disappoint.
i could be totally caffeine-free, breathing by the book, and counting various barn-yard animals all while drinking gallons of warm milk and mainlining melatonin in a dark, cool, and silent little cocoon and i'd still be wide awake (and with an even deeper hated of cattle).

on exercise involves going through all the worries in your head and ""putting them aside"" for the night.
the problem is (i suppose) that i don't have many worries beyond the whole sleep issue.
my health issues, our financial situation, the impending zombie apocalypse: it's not what i'm concerned with.
and even if i humor the idea and list out any possible worries, ""sleep"" is always numero uno.
it's a self-perpetuating problem.
if you were to talk to me after 48+ hours of no sleep, i'd likely sell my lone kidney for an ambien, my kingdom for a swift frying pan to the head.

if it were just my sanity at stake, it would be one thing, but lack of sleep effects everything.
long-term self-medicating is not a reasonable option.

too bad insomnia kills reason."

"event","i have a migraine right now.
there's a small part of me that is convinced it may be from thinking too much.
yuck. nobody likes girls who think, amiright?

i've been fighting a cold/flu/plague thing this weekend which came on the tail end of a UTI (okay, that might actually still be there...) and as a result i'm just thoroughly tired.
i don't want to do anything, i don't want to talk to anyone, i don't want to allow my basic autonomic functions work.
i'm trying to motivate myself nonetheless.

i think part of the problem is my sleep patterns have been really horrible lately.
even for me.
usually, it takes me forever to get to sleep, but once i do, i only wake up a couple times.
lately, it takes forever for me to get to sleep, and once i do, i find myself awake minutes later.
last night, i kept waking up every 15 or so with a feeling that i'd forgotten something or that i needed something..but couldn't think of anything.

i made the mistake of taking one of george's sleep aids the other night.
it was, admittedly, an act of desperation.
it was a mistake.
i forgot that this particular med makes me feel depressed and listless for days afterward.
also, it doesn't help me sleep anyhow.

i'm lucky that i have george around right now.
he's been taking care of me all weekend.
he's made me countless pots of tea with milk and honey, cleaned parts of the apartment without me asking, and put me to bed early.

this funk can't last long. i'm sure of it.
and i know it'll be shorter if i work to motivate myself.
part of me feels like indulging it for a bit longer, though.

i dunno.."

especially when he drinks the whole pack over two days.
this is my solution:

homemade frappuccinos.

ingredients:
2/3c. ground coffee of your choice
1/2tsp. cinnamon
3tbsp. brown sugar
2tsp. vanilla
3c. water

in quart jar, mix ingredients. stir (or shake if your container has a tight-fitting lid) well. refrigerate over night. stain mixture with a fine mesh sieve fitted with a coffee filter. pour back into quart jar or divide into 6 smaller jars. when ready to use, add milk (and chocolate, if desired) to taste and mix. enjoy!

"event","inspired by a post and conversation in TQC, i started looking at name meanings.
my collection means: Elise = consecrated to God (lolno), McKenna = ascend, Abbygale = father's joy/father's rejoice (laffytaffy).
i'll stick with McKenna

however, in the meantime, i came across ""Mallory"".
it's a common name in our family.
my mother had a cousin named Mallory, and my uncle named his first son Mallory.
the name, apparently, means ""ill-fated"".
not to draw any conclusions, but the first Mallory i mentioned here died in a motorcycle accident.
the injury was so bad, that it sheered off the top of his head. his skull.
his parents really wanted an open casket funeral, though, so they glued and painted him up enough to make him look...well, still dead, but ""just dead"" is better than ""nearly decapitated""...

the younger Mallory is (or at least was when i knew him) a sweet kid with a few issues, but nothing horrible.
his mother, on the other hand, has serious issues.
she has, on a few occasions, threatened to kill herself and take Mal with her.
the things this kid has had to deal with are insane.
i worry about him in his future life, but i always have.
his name meaning means nothing really, but it also somehow fits.

i will never name anything or anyone Mallory.

"event","Homemade Frozen Burritos

Ingredients:
1 lb. ground beef
1 cup rice
1/2 cup grated cheddar cheese (optional)
2 cans refried beans
1 packages taco seasoning
Tomato paste
Worchestershire sauce
Garlic powder
1 (8 count) package tortillas

Supplies:
Wax paper
Foil
Large freezer bags

Directions: 
Cook rice in rice cooker with tomato paste and taco seasoning. Meanwhile, brown ground beef and season with taco seasoning, tomato paste, worchestershire, and garlic powder to taste. Drain fat and set aside to cool. Heat refried beans through.
Prepare enough squares each of wax paper and foil for each of the tortillas and stack alternatingly with wax paper on top (wax paper, foil, wax paper, foil, etc.). Set aside.
Combine beef and cooked rice in a bowl with cheese (if using). Warm tortillas in the microwave for 1 minute covered with a damp kitchen towel to soften and make more pliable. Keep tortillas covered while working. At work station, place first tortilla on stack of wax paper and foil. Spread with refried beans and cover with a few spoonfuls of rice/beef mixture. Do not use too much as you will run out of filling and your burritos will be overly full. Fold in sides of tortilla and roll from bottom to top to create the burrito. Fold the wax paper around it in the same way and then wrap with the foil. Continue until all tortillas are filled and wrapped or until you've run out of filling.
Place wrapped burritos on baking sheets in a single layer and place in freezer. Once frozen, place in freezer bags.
When ready to use, removed from freezer and allow to thaw in refrigerator. At lunch time, remove foil and place wax paper-wrapped burrito in the microwave and heat for 2 minutes. If heating from frozen, heat for 3-4 minutes.

the nice thing about this is that you can add anything you want to the mix. 
the recipe above is the most simple, most cheap, omnivorous combination that george likes.
personally, i like to add more veggies (corn, black beans, diced tomatoes, diced zucchini, spinach, etc.).
mostly, i just make the simple version because it just makes it easy for him to grab them without looking when he's on his way out the door in the morning, but when i have made two different kinds, i used colorful foil leftover from the holidays to let him know which ones he didn't want to take (red means stop, half-asleep-boyfriend!).
these are, after all is said and done, cheaper, more healthy, tastier, and more customizable than frozen burritos and a lot better than letting him eat out of the vending machine at work.
plus, they took me about 20 minutes to put together the other day - and now he's got a week's worth of lunches ready to go."

also, it seems i can't sleep without caffeine?
whaaa?

i've been sick for the past *this many* days.
sore throat, tired, leaky nose (it doesn't even have the decency to run. it's just...leaking), head-ow, tummy-ow, tiredface, etc.
i woke up without a voice this morning, but sadly for george, that only lasted a couple hours.
i tried looking these symptoms up on webmd, but it's not giving me much to work with.
i'm pretty sure it's not gout. and my erectile isn't dysfunctional. 
it says i could have a foreign object in my nose.
thanks, webmd. i'll be sure to check NOW.

with symptoms like ""tiredface"" and ""leaky nose"", i'm lucky my doctor puts up with me at all.
we have conversations like:
""it kinda feels like my head is filled with painful cotton fiberfill, ya know?""
""mhm. pain..ful...cot...ton. got it.""

i really got lucky with her.

i think i'll spare her this one, though.
tomorrow will be a day of sleep and tea and more sleep, maybe a bath, perhaps a nap, and some more tea - even if i have to drug myself to get rest.
that's still rest, right?
shh. we'll say it is.

"event","it frustrates me sometimes that i can find something without much trouble at all, but if george is looking for something it's impossible to find.
i've noticed it with other guys, too.
growing up with my step-father, we always had at least 4 jars of mustard in the fridge because he'd look for one, not see it, tell my mother we were out, and she'd buy another.
any of us ""girls"" were able to find them with ease, though.
if i'm busy with something else, i'll ask george to grab me something (a piece of clothing, for instance).
i'll know approximately where it is and tell him to look there.
he'll look and toss things around but ultimately say it's not there.
it used to anger me because it seems like he's not trying, but watching him, i know he is. 
so why am i able to find things when he isn't?
it's not just my things or our things that this applies to, either.
he'll have lost books, some of his games, his shoes, etc., and be at a total loss and i'll enter the room and point to said object.
when cody visits, i notice him having the same issue. 
it's almost as if they just can't see the object they're looking for.
like as soon as their mind decides it's searching for something it blocks it from their view.
that can't be, though, right?
how would that make any sense?
psychologically, evolutionarily, that makes no sense.
i've brought this observation up before with groups of men and woman, and oftentimes woman will not that their men or men they've been around ""lose"" things all the time unless they're placed in exactly the same place that it's ALWAYS in.

i started taking note on how i find things lately.
often, i ""look"" with all of my other senses as much as i do with my eyes, while i've noticed guys look at an area or scene and only take note of what is readily visible, and when they do move things around, it seems that they are no longer observing things in motion or looking at the items at all.
the other night, i asked george to find me a tank top in a box of clothing.
i knew it was in the front, right-hand corner about half-way down.
he dug half-way down but couldn't find it, and even got upset with the set up.
""we need a better way of storing clothes,"" he complained.
it's true, we do, but for now, they're all in one small area and should be easy to find.
so, i got into my chair, went to the box and starting at the top of the front, right-hand corner shuffled things slightly to the side.
in grabbing things, i felt different fabrics - rough, textured, knitted, stretchy, and so on - until i felt the straps to my shirt.
at the same time i was looking; i felt and saw the item at the same time and all within a matter of seconds.
when i said this to him, he said it was cheating because it was my belonging and i knew what to look and feel for.
the reason i don't buy this is that we've been together for nearly 8 years.
he knows my clothing as well as i know his and has even been able to describe, in detail, an item too me off the top of his head, and these tank tops are a large part of my daily wear - he has almost as much contact with them as i do.
however, for the sake of fairness, let's look at a recent instance where i found something of his.
he'd lost his book the other day and was certain that he must have left it at work because it was ""NOT in the apartment"".
i noticed that the first thing i did was smell.
it's an older book and has a distinct smell.
we were in the living room and near the bookshelf, so the smell is in the room anyhow, but i could smell it coming from elsewhere, faintly.
looking for places where it could fit in, under, or behind, i started moving things slightly, feeling and smelling as much as i was looking while i went.
within a few moments, i found it in his side of the couch, though he said the last place he had is was in his bookbag.
it also dawned on me that he'd assumed that it had been in or near his bookbag last and therefore didn't look much farther.
this is something i used to think of as laziness, but i now think it's beyond that.
i just don't know what it is.

going back to the jars of mustard, after a while my mother was fed up with the growing collection accumulating in the fridge, so we were in charge of finding things in the fridge.
dough would look for something and complain that we were out and we'd have to look.
many times it was just a matter of moving things around; as with most fridges, it was easy for items to be right behind other things.
when we would find what he was looking for, he'd usually as astounded, ""where was it!?""
we respond with something like, ""right behind the milk"", and he'd get upset, claiming that we had to have known it was there to look for it there.
why does it seem to be so difficult for men to look for something and manipulate other items at the same time?


now i need to go get ready for work.
it's only until 2..or 4, so i'm sure i'll make it.
it just seems sometimes like it's not worth getting up for.
4 or MAYBE 6 hours every handful of days?
part of me thinks i should look for another job.
i really can't risk losing my SSI, though. 
if they take that away, they can also take my insurance away and my health won't allow that.
bleh."

"event","i got trapped talking to a woman at the doctor's office, and she ended up showing me her cross necklace.
it was a hunk of wood carved into an awkward cross shaped and, according to her, it's made from the actual cross that jesus was crucified on!
the EXACT wood from the EXACT cross jesus HIMSELF died on!
and it only cost her $20 because it was on sale!
how batshit insane does one have to be to put these words together and believe them enough to tell other people?
a horrible part of me really wanted to show her the teeth i have in my locket (finnegan's milk teeth) and tell her that they're baby teeth from the ACTUAL easter bunny and the only way i got them was to BE the tooth fairy for a while.

i don't care if you believe in jesus.
i don't care if you believe that the cross he died on was somehow preserved and still around.
but don't expect me to even remotely believe that somebody hacked it up to make commemorative necklaces and that they were on sale for the low, low price of $19.95.
and if you buy now, they'll send you this beautiful handkerchief-size square of the shroud of turin free! (just pay additional processing & handling)

i'm a little rage-y tonight.
our apartment management sent us another notice that we owe them $40.
let me explain:
back in october we were told that our rent went up by $40, so we paid it.
then we got a notice saying that it wasn't supposed to go up until the next month so we had a credit on our account for $40.
the next month we paid that amount.
we then got a notice that we owed them $40 because we didn't pay the full amount.
so george went in a talked to them about it - reminding them of what happened.
they admitted their mistake and said that our account with them was fine.
the next month, we paid our rent and received a notice saying that we owed them $40 and that if we didn't pay it, we'd hear from their lawyers.
what.
so george went in and talked them about it.
they apologized and said that we were fine.
now they're saying we owe them again.
seriously people. what the fuck.

so tomorrow i'll go in and talk to them.
frankly, i'm tired of being harassed and think they should pay US $40 for the trouble.

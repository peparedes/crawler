Some guy came into the store last night and I think he was on a date with this younger-looking chick and her son...and his 3 kids.  This guy was the biggest creep on the face of the planet:  the look in his eyes and his child-molester-voice made me think he probably has TONS of kiddie porn on his hard drive and that he's raped and murdered a few dozen people and woodland creatures.  All I could think of while I was taking his order was how much I wanted to harm him and how sorry I felt for his date and the children.  I felt gross scooping his fucking icecream, I wanted to spit in it.

I am NOT a screw-up, I work TOO HARD and I don't deserve this shit.  Today was absolutely retarded.

Most of the people I work with are awesome, and I hope that after I quit (if I get a nurse's aid job this summer) we'll remain friends.

I want to divorce myself from everything and start from there.  Every day, everything I do is routine and mundane.  I go to school, I work, I study, I try to sleep, and then it begins again.

I'm young and it's not going to last forever.  I've been stuck in this weird kind of rut for about a year.  I think maybe it's time to climb out."

I'm going to the Roman game on Thanksgiving.  Tradition.  I've been going since I was a kid...I get to be reunited a lot of the people I went to high school with and haven't seen since last Thanksgiving.  Which I guess is both good and bad.  It's nice to see everyone, but when I was in high school, I guess I considered all my acquaintances to be my friends.  Now seems like I have considerably less friends.  I don't know what to say to half the people I used to talk to comfortably.  All I can do is make awkward small talk.  Seems everyone's different now, but I don't think really think they are.  I think it's just me and the way I see things now.  Probably.

So anyway, we were learning about Freud and he stumbled onto the topic of Freudian slips.  He's sweating and stuttering and all.  He asked the class if anyone could give an example of a Freudian slip from a personal experience and when no one raised their hand, he proceeded to give us the following example, stuttering and such:

He said he'd come downstairs the other morning to find that his wife had prepaired breakfast for him, which was unusual because she was normally gone for work by that time.  While he was eating the breakfast his wife asked him how he liked it.  He told us he MEANT to say, ""It's very good, thank you,"" but instead what came out was, ""Shut up bitch you ruined my life!""

And everyone was amazed.

I've heard that joke before, but it was just great to hear it come from my nervous IH professor."

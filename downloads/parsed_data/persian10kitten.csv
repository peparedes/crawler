"event","well then kids, another post.School has been ok so far, im really loving history im getting a pretty good grade in there...i think.We will see monday, yay progress reports?and now my cat is currently hitting me in the face with his tail, haha random but it did have my attention.Um being section leader during band camp sucked, because qwentin quit then came back, and now i have no idea where he is...he might have quit or maybe he is just sick.I dont know.Im really excited about Homecoming this year.I just want september to come faster.I wonder who is going to be band sweetheart, donica again??No clue.The band show is pretty nifty, but i still like alst years better.i dont know why though.This year has  a couple of long scatter drills.yay!ewll i don't have too much more to say so, bye kids.oh and the blank star is very creepy, it has no face."

"event","YAY! today was the first day of band camp.We did the usual uniform fitting.I've gained a lot of weight being lazy over the summer, and the band moms (that i dont recognize =[) dont believe me when i say ill lose ALL of it maybe plus some after band camp or such.thus leaving me with a huge uniform hahaha.We got to play ""My Favorite things"" today.ya know like from The sound of Music?i really should watch that movie because i dont think ive seen it.IT WAS AWESOME AND JAZZY! hahaha. Oh and in that slow song, i forget the name, sax has a solo well more like a quartet.but still very cool.oh and if harlAn (haha) doesnt come to band camp again, i may have a chance at landin the part (because of course we have to try out for them).Oh and LOVE mr. cobb (i mean as much as i know of him hahaha, well good first impression) lets pray he stays like my first impression of him.oh and a MUCH MUCH MUCH MUCH better player than mrs. dix. man he can play.loud with tone.and i was right in front of him so i got the lot of it.Oh and my whole section are freshmen currently (i only say my section because im the oldest one there haha) i hope qwentin comes to band camp , but not harlin because i want that solo HAHAHAHA.but hey qwentin may just step up there and beat me out.or a freshmen but probably not because Lydia is playing 2nd part, and considering bari.Oh cameron and dillon have grills, dallas has an afro, and donica made field commander again.So i need to practice because i absolutely love the jazz show.but i cant think of anythign else to write, but today was awesome.but i still need to finish The once and Future King, but its a pretty interesting summer assignment.And i need to start Harry Potter.Oh and I wore my Mrs. Nash button and the Freshman Tuba Player knew who it was.sweet.oh and ive said sweet almost too many times today and i tackled everyone i saw today.yay band =]and dude the chipper star has has musical notes around it"

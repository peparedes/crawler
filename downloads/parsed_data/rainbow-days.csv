"event","<FONT color=#cc9933 size=1>I read your info tonight and it said single..I was about to i.m. you but I caught myself. I didn't even feel like talking to you, I just wanted to help. I read your live journal too and it talked about being friends, but that's not what I want. You know,.. you picked the wrong time to want that because before when I wanted it you had your head shoved up your ass, right now I do too so I'll be stubborn and ignore you. After we had our fights we'd always make up, this time I was so sure that the same thing would happen so I tried to prevent it and I think I've been doing pretty good. I see you walking around so different than what you were when I knew you in Riley.. it's so disgusting. You straighten your hair when you're with him, but I always told you it was pretty with natural curls. It's the silly things that drive me insane these days. ..Like how you always hear how your boy has been bad so you say you're going to talk to him and maybe dump him, but then you never do. You knew it was true, but you just didn't want to believe it. I've been there and done that thanks to you. I also hate the way you tell your mommy about someone who's bothering you, but you don't even mention what you've done. You're blaming other people and Britt since you guys aren't really friends anymore because you haven't found out yet it was your fault. I don't care if I'm being harsh anymore you did so many things that I looked away from. I told you so many times that a lot of your friends had problems with Dave, ..Dave the one you lived and died for. If you were me you'd crap your pants because of how funny you are. I hate how you knew and didn't do anything about this and that.. I hate you and it's driving me mad. Your ex-boyfriend (before this one) said he was &nbsp;fine as friends and I told you when you dumped him he wasn't okay with that but you didn't believe me. I really enjoyed it when he i.m.ed me with his silly threats that no one would take seriously and the nice names he called me. Well, actually it was only one, but he said it about a thousand times. You can't say I'm just like you because Adam means the same thing Dave did to you. The difference is that Adam is basically my best friend instead of a ""boy toy"" as miss nearbin might put it. It's okay if you hate me.. I don't care about you anymore, but for some reason i miss you.</FONT>"

Robby Richardson and Jeff Bame came along but then Jeff left and Robby stayed. There was this couple to the left of us that was so annoying.

Uhm..Social Studies was extra boring because Matt was annoying me the only good thing was that Mrs. Proud somehow gave me a 75 as an average for the station things we had to do.. but then she found out she didn't add two things so it got changed to an 88. Gramma always yells at us in lunch because the boys come over and sit by us so she says something like ""No hunny hunny!"" or uhh.. ""No hanky panky!"" I love her. Math was the usual.. Mrs. Burt wouldn't add in all the papers I corrected for some reason so I'll get a bad grade.. once again. That big blond sub in science was definitely different, and I don't mean in a good way. Uhm, what else? Oh, that scooter basketball thing was so bad. The boys behind me kept touching me and wouldn't stop so Kailyn yelled at them and we moved and sat by Carolyn. Then later Adam came down and sat by me. Uhg. I was supposed to go to the mall today to get American Eagle gift certificates for Sara and Jess seeing how their party is tonight, but I guess they'll have to deal with money. I feel bad this is so boring so I'll stop here.</FONT></FONT></P>

<TD><PRE style=""FONT: 12px arial""><FONT color=#ffffcc size=1>It started out quite simply, as complex things can do;
A set of sad transparencies 'til no one could see through,

But least of all the one inside, behind the iron glass;
A prisonor of all your dreams that never come to pass.

Alone you stand corrupted by the vision that you sought,
And blinded by your hunger all your apetites are bought,

But in spite of what becomes of you, your image will remain;
A reminder of your constant loss, a symbol of your gain.

And your friends are together,
Where the people are all gathered,
All along the road you travelled all your days.

And soon you have succumbed to what the others all believe,
And though the lie affects them still it's you that they decieve,

<FONT color=#ff6666><STRONG>And all at once you're lost within the emptieness of you,
And there's no one left who's near enough to tell you what to do.</STRONG>
</FONT>
You're left with nothing but your self-potential in the dark,
Like tinder resting on a rock, protected from the spark,

But your fire just consumes you, you alone can feel the pain,
And you stand in all your glory and you know you can't complain. 

But you are surely just as evil as the worst my tongue can tell,
For you'll never face my heaven and I'll not endure your hell.

You have lost your chance to mingle with your constant quiet lies;
Deceptions hidden with your lips, but spoken with your eyes.

For I know you for what you are not for that's really all you are.
And your talents of a minor order seem to stretch too far.

And we both know that this masquerade can't carry on too long.
You're deep inside the Pride Parade, but where do you belong?

I can still remember how that music used to make me smile
And I knew if I had my chance
That I could make those people dance
And <STRONG>maybe they'd be happy for a while.</STRONG>
But February made me shiver
With every paper I'd deliver
Bad news on the doorstep
I couldn't take one more step
<STRONG>I can't remember if I cried</STRONG>
When I read about his widowed bride
</FONT><FONT size=1><FONT color=#ff0000><STRONG>But something touched me deep inside
The day the music died</STRONG>

<STRONG>Did you write the Book of Love</STRONG>
And <STRONG>do you have faith in God above</STRONG>
If the Bible tells you so
<STRONG>Do you believe in rock 'n roll</STRONG>
Can music save your mortal soul
And <STRONG>can you teach me how to dance real slow</STRONG>
Well, <FONT color=#ffffcc>I know that you're in love with her</FONT><BR>'Cause I saw you dancin' in the gym
You both kicked off your shoes

With a pink carnation and a pickup truck

Now for ten years <STRONG>we've been on our own</STRONG>
And moss grows fat on a rollin' stone
But <STRONG>that's not how it used to be</STRONG>
When the jester sang for the King and Queen
In a coat he borrowed from James Dean
And a voice that came from you and me
Oh, and while the King was looking down
The jester stole his thorny crown
The courtroom was adjourned
No verdict was returned
And while Lenin read a book of Marx
The quartet practiced in the park
And we sang dirges in the dark
The day the music died 

We were singing

Helter Skelter in a summer swelter
The birds flew off with a fallout shelter
<STRONG>Eight miles high and falling fast</STRONG>
It landed foul out on the grass
The players tried for a forward pass
With the jester on the sidelines in a cast
<STRONG>Now the half-time air was sweet perfume</STRONG>
While the Sergeants played a marching tune
We all got up to dance
Oh, <STRONG>but we never got the chance</STRONG>
'Cause the players tried to take the field
The marching band refused to yield
</FONT></FONT><FONT size=1><FONT color=#ff0000><STRONG>Do you recall what was revealed

<STRONG>A generation Lost in Space</STRONG>
<STRONG><FONT size=2>With no time left to start again</FONT></STRONG>
So come on, Jack be nimble, Jack be quick
Jack Flash sat on a candlestick
'Cause fire is the Devil's only friend
Oh, and as I watched him on the stage
<FONT color=#ffffcc><STRONG>My hands were clenched in fists of rage</STRONG>
</FONT>No angel born in hell
Could break that Satan's spell
And as the flames climbed high into the night
To light the sacrificial rite
</FONT><FONT color=#ff0000><STRONG>I saw Satan laughing with delight

I went down to the sacred store
Where I'd heard the music years before

And in the streets the <STRONG>children screamed</STRONG>
The <STRONG>lovers cried</STRONG>, and the <STRONG>poets dreamed</STRONG>
But <STRONG>not a word was spoken</STRONG>
The church bells all were broken
And the three men I admire most
The Father, Son and the Holy Ghost

Some people think I've been down and depressed and different than before, but maybe I act the way I do because I don't have a best friend anymore. I have a lot of friends, but none of them are really like Carolyn, Britt, and Chelsea. Adam definitely could actually be considered a best friend, but I'm always worried that he'll be gone and ..( I don't want to go down this road). There's Na't, but I don't know I need a girl. Emily and Corrine have to be the closest girls right now, but they have a whole bunch of other close friends and a best friend is like the one person you do everything with and such. Christian's pretty cool since she may feel the way I do, but she has a lot of other closer friends and most of the Kingsford girls already mapped out who their best friends are. ..Carolyn I never see since she's on East, but if we were together more we would definitely be best friends like we were in the Riley days. Philip is always there to cheer me up, but I don't know.. Britt can't be described right now, we always change and (I can't describe this at all!) Jackie's my sister and she's clueless about this and I don't like to talk about things I'd rather talk to people who already know about the problem. Robby is always there, but I don't know. Basically it's Adam is the only one because he's always there when he doesn't need to be and he understands me completely and I'm not saying it just because I like him a lot, I'm saying it because it's true.

"event","<FONT color=#ffffcc><STRONG>I've been forgetting to include basketball lately.. We're 3-0, three wins. The first game was a home game against ESM, they weren't really good but some of them were nice. One bit me. *smile* We won by a lot, I can't really remember the score though. Also,..I was a bench warmer for B team the first two games!. *there's another smile* We played Fulton a couple days ago. It was really weird because it would be really close and then we'd be beating them by a lot. The times when it was really close was when B team (me) were doing really bad and a midget girl would get 5 lay up, 10 points in a row for her team.. We ended up winning by over 20 I think. We changed in their men's room though.. I walked in the bathroom and there was a urinal. I was like, ""woah, why is this here!?"" I thought maybe it was a men's room but then turned into a women's, but then everyone told me it was the men's.. After the game Jess tried to describe some Chinese noodles that I still don't understand and we talked for a while until my dad came. We were walking by the 8th grade team on the way out and you know they did their little coughs on purpose.. Blah meanies. On the bus before the Fulton game Britt forgot her shorts and shoes and we can't play without the right shorts.. so the 8th grade coach was wicked nice and asked one of the 8th grade girls to lend theirs to Britt and her mom came with her old shoes since she left everything in her gym locker. Our last game was a home game against CNS. This game would be described as.. ""wow"" ..with a jaw drop. It was like half basketball half&nbsp;wrestling match.. I mean, it's okay to be rough and physical in basketball, but not like how they played. Our game was supposed to start at 4:30 but it didn't start until sometime after 6:30 because their bus hit a cop car by the Ed Center. Their point guards were really mean and snobby. If the ref called a foul on them they'd blame someone else and whine to their coach and she'd be all sympathetic. The A team point guard had a big attitude and was mean.. and the B team point guard was angry a lot. On jump balls she'd freak out and scream, ""GET OFF OF ME!!"" when no one was on her. My girl I had to guard wasn't that good, she was nice though. We only played 4 quarters instead of 5. B team played the end of the game we were winning like 44 to 8, something like that. Their B team point guard fouled out and then they tried to put the A team point guard in, but she had already fouled out. It was pretty funny. The ref was like ""No, no you don't she already fouled out find someone else and get off the court!"" She gave one of her looks like she didn't do anything then the ref said..""jessuss cchhriistt!"" Somewhere in the middle of the game.. One of the refs was rolling the ball to the other for foul shots so I tipped it the other way to get to him but he moved.. So he stood there and waited for me to go get it, but then I bounced it to him but he wasn't looking and it hit him in the butt so my team was laughing then I waddled up to him and handed it to him *smile!* Adam, Emily, Travis, and Na't were there along with a couple others. I haven't scored yet these three games because I suck.. Anyways, one of the times when Adam was watching I was passing in the ball for the Texas play and he yelled out ""go jesse!"" I turned around half way to look at him, but I didn't see him. I thought it was cute. ..Blahh, there was another smile. I'm going to go eat or clean, I should write more later kids.</STRONG></FONT>"

Amanda Reno, Jessie B., and I went all through the upper halls trying to get signatures, but out of the like twenty we went to,..we got 8 not including some of the West teachers though. The end of the math midterm thing was today too. I think I did good, but every time I say that I end up doing really bad. Our first basketball game was today, and it was a home game. I did really bad.. I kept falling and this girl, it's hard to believe.. but she bit me! I kept falling like right under the basket or around there.. I had to have the trainer lady put some stuff on my bite mark..wow, that sounds weird knowing it should normally me a scratch! It hurt after the girl did it, but I guess I started bleeding and I didn't know because when I went to wipe my face there was blood and Britt told me it was bleeding..I got to play more though. This girls way of defense was doing the bear hug thing.. It got really annoying after a while. I didn't score.. Woah, but I sure did love my tiny little crowd! *Emily, Adam, and Na't!* They yelled out like ""Go Jesse"" once, I at least think that's what they said. *smile*. Then Adam and Emily kept blowing me kisses when I was waiting for the lady to come put alcohol stuff and a band-aide on me. ..I'd have to say they were the best part of the game even though I sucked a ton.</FONT></P>

"event","So say what you want 
But drops of crystal clear water 
Has been falling into your heart 

Now you're sick of lying 
Tonight a star is shining 
On a heart that's dying 
The morning star is shining again 
So you better wake up 
You better rise up 
The morning star is shining again"

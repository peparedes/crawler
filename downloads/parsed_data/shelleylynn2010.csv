Today was our big trip ti the movies to see <b>The Chronicles of Narnia the Lion the Witch, and the Wardrobe</b> i thought i wouldn't like it cause i wasn't really that interested in seeing a beaver talk..but as it turned out it was great and i cried cause it was so good. It was a religious movie in a way. the lion represented the Lord and the witch represented the devil. the lion dies in this one part and i balled and then he comes back to life. I love it. It was a 2 hour movie and it had an intermission and we took like a 5 second break then it came back one. The eldest boy in the movie get crowned prince of Narnia and everyone in the theater was cheering. and at the end everyone stood up and screamed at the top of their lungs cause it was so good.. oh i'm going to go see it again this weekend with my mom....seriously i cried.. me and michael and blaine sat with each other and threw things at people and we had a bus to ourselves and we looked like a special ed class or something..but it was fun.....way better than it would be going to Baltimore no offense...when we got back to school we all were so sad cause it was our last full day of the semester..me and Shawna sang the graduation song by Vitamin C"

"event","broken angel
shattered heart
why don't the pain end
right after it starts

tears of loneliness
screams of fear
i can't stop the pain 
that you make me feel my dear

undiscribing emotions
can't defy what they mean
its too deep inside
my tears all that can be seen

crying angel
bruised heart
let the rain wash you clean
though the pain is so sharp

it's hard to not look back
when you got nothing to look in front
i guess i had too much
but it was never good enough

words that don't make sence
spill from my lips
not able to make a words 
that describes how i feel

listen closely 
cause now you just may see
what's in side of me
that you have never seen

i live a life out of the ordinary
i'm not so perfect like you think i am
you think of me differently 
you think of me as worse
but i can be someone else
a whole new different girl

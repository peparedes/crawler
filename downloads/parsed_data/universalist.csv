""<em>America is the only country that went from barbarism to decadence without civilization in between</em>""
-- <strong>Oscar Wilde</strong>

I first read this, and found it funny. Unfortunately, in the last six years, it seems to ring true more often than I care to admit. There are too many obvious/simple examples of this, and it is no longer ""against the flow"" to point them out.

Today, I read a quoted paragraph that seems to have the most condensed substance of what seems to be some kind of irrational thinking. If this is the way that, perhaps a minority of, Americans think, but that carry a bit of weight in politics. I shake my head as to the direction that this country can take.

[ <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/linkset/2005/04/11/LI2005041100587.html"">article link</a> ] <a href=""http://townhall.com/columnists/JaniceShawCrouse/2006/12/07/mary_cheneys_pregnancy_affects_us_all"">Janice Shaw Crouse</a>, who works for Concerned Women for America, is harshly critical on her blog:<blockquote><tt>""Mary Cheney's pregnancy poses problems not just for her child, but also for all Americans. Her action repudiates traditional values and sets an appalling example for young people at a time when father absence is the most pressing social problem facing the nation. With 37 percent of American children born to fatherless families, Mary Cheney is contributing to a trend that is detrimental to all Americans who will live with the ramifications of millions of children whose anger and frustration at not knowing their father will be felt in the public schools and communities of our nation.
""Mary Cheney is among that burgeoning group of adult women over age 20 that are driving the trend of women who don't want a man in the picture, but want to have a baby. These older women are pushing out-of-wedlock birth statistics higher and higher. At a time when teen births and teen abortions are declining dramatically, older women are having more un-wed births and more abortions, including repeat abortions (indicating that they are using abortion as birth control.
""Well-educated, professional Mary Cheney is flying in the face of the accumulated wisdom of the top experts who agree that the very best family structure for a child's well-being is a married mom and dad family. Her child will have all the material advantages it will need, but it will still encounter the emotional devastation common to children without fathers.""</tt></blockquote> That she wants to be harshly critical with her views is her given right, as is a reaction to it.

One thing I like about the French is how they abstract every problem, and while that can drive most of the world population crazy, there is not enough of it in the US, where things are not quite integrated or in unison. The idea is to ram ideology, the same way that some religious preaching is carried out: fear, and ""don't confuse me with the facts"" (or thinking).

Rather than belittle the points, here are a set of comments:
* when was the traditional values proven to be unassailable? Yes, there is wisdom not to be ignored in traditional values, but does that mean that we cannot look at them in the context of our intellectual evolution?
* is ""the most pressing problem facing the nation is families without fathers""? How? Why? How did this jump into #1 with a bullet? I suppose that I am being ignorant for not having realized this.
* ""37% of american children are born fatherless."" Perhaps a few more become fatherless. What happens to these? Do they become more likely to be criminal? Is this fear by alarming numbers? Are we still in a society that is a one-income home done by fathers with the mom at home?
*""Mary Cheney is contributing to a trend..."" So, when Mary Chaney has her kid, how much is this ""37%"" going to change? I mean, if she is contributing, it must make a difference, the way that the taxes I pay increase the US revenues by the same percentage increase, I suppose.
*""...that is detrimental to all Americans who will live with the ramifications of millions of children whose anger and frustration at not knowing their father."" This one is a winner, and really makes me boil. I think psychologically, kids are smarter than this lady purports they are, because humans are good at acclimating. I mean, I cannot be the only person in this world that did alright and not have an ""anger and frustration"" at not knowing my father. Can I be that special? I am sure that there are some fatherless families where the kids do much worse because the mom could not handle the situation, or went into bad foster homes, etc.
*""Mary Cheney is flying in the face of the accumulated wisdom of the top experts who agree that the very best family structure for a child's well-being is a married mom and dad family. "" To this I say: let this couple get married then! I am sure that the father qualities can be provided by a combination of both. I mean, why push this idea that only fathers have the talent (of presence if they are always working and bringing the money home) to provide a stable home that is good for the kids.

but the most egregious (dramatic?)
*""Mary Cheney's pregnancy poses problems not just for her child, but also for all Americans."" Well, she is likely to inherit Halliburton money from her father, so in this case, we can set up a class action suit to have her pay for the problems that her child will inflict on all Americans. Everything here is solved by law, and so I think we can pursue this line of reasoning. I am sure someone can calculate the increased cost into child-welfare costs that this pregnancy is going to create, and therefore, we can sue just to recover costs, and no libel or emotional stress damages. I mean if this person is so sure of the increased problems to Americans, then just sue. Actually, sue now to prevent the birth, or forced adoption, of such an abomination into the cultural fabric of America.

The point of all this rant is that it is sad that politics can be pursued on the basis of such weak reasoning. Sorry, it is not weak, but totally absent. There is a trend in discussion to:
1. Take personal emotional points of view and push them as a factual reasoning.
2. One example is ample to prove a point, when in reality, one example can <em>only</em> disprove a thesis.
3. Holding a person to be a ""role model,"" or in this case as a ""poster person,"" standard instead of teaching self-sustenance and parents teaching models. This idea of role modeling after famous people is really an interesting trait here. Let the kids get to know great people as they grow up, and let those be examples that are best for them. Until then, just do the parenting, which is equally afflicted in the US by fathers, mothers, gay, not-gay, rich, poor, etc.
4. Exclude all kind of general reasoning. Really, it is all about further pushing the universe that one person knows, and not educating oneself into a broader perspective. There is no interest here with perspectives.

This is not a matter of red/blue, conservative/liberal, and all of that... this kind of reasoning is being pursued by one and all sides, and made worse by the American public wanting to only hear what validates their already existing believes.

It seems that not only Oscar Wilde's phrase has a bit of truth to it, but that is going to be a prophecy. I hope not.

The first vacation of the year, or at least, since the beginning of the year happened. Finally! It was about time to visit NYC, as it had been a drought of 3.5 years since the last visit, and it was a great visit. I sooooo love NYC, and would like to move there rather badly. <lj user=""sbgrl""> managed to scare me a little with her tales of apartments (costs/hunting/etc) in the Village, but I remain unfazed. I got there a bit sick, and it was not until Saturday that managed to go about town, but the weather was grandiose (warmer than Los Angeles!!!). In Thursday night, and returned by Tuesday night. Fantastic.

I think NYC offers a way to hide from the America above, wherever that happens.

The colour streak along ""the 10"" freeway is the speed indicators for the way home, which is near the intersection of the 10 and 110 (loop on the lower right). The red is between 1 and 14, yellow between 15 and 34 and blue between 35 and 54. The thing is, when there is no accident (no diamonds coloured in red to yellow), those speeds are usually faster, for some reason. The traffic is more like an accordion, and where it is yellow, it is actually sitting in traffic for a minute or more. This has been put to the test by calling a friend and checking the <a href=""http://www.sigalert.com/map.asp?Region=LA+West"" title=""sigalert.com"">website</a>.

The amazing thing is that this is slow at 7.45pm, and there was no accident. There is no look to go around, as the 405 north is slow to the 101 (horrible connection ramp) and then 101 south is also crammed. 

I am lucky that this is a ""don't care"" since I got a job that I leave, home or office, when the ""dots are aligned"" -- so if I am still at work (that is the case now), it is not much different than being at home, where I would work during the evening. Well, at least for this year. Also, I get to see if it is necessary that I come to the office, and so, one or two days a week I work from home.

However, how can people put up with this? I have seen those slow speeds start to show up around 3pm. It takes up to 1 hour to go 15 miles from Santa Monica to downtown Los Angeles. What kind of life is that?

I am addicted, and need medical attention.
I only watched two episodes of this show during the 4th season (now going to its 6th or 7th), and was impressed enough to buy a season DVD. Now I have all three, and have watched three seasons, some twice and more. It is crazy! However, it seemed that I got it at the right time where I would watch a couple of episodes, take a nap for 2 or 3 hours, get up and work for 6 or so, and repeat over a few days, and sometimes over a week. 
I can't wait for the 4th season to be out next month. That is the season with <a href=""http://imdb.com/name/nm0001287/"" title=""imdb"">Heather Graham</a>, who I have grown to like, though it seems that she is not doing good movies lately -- though the same can be said of Jim Carrey and Kevin Spacey (now that one hurts).

Mari wanted to go to the movies, but this is the first time that I know I have to refuse going with her. So, I just dropped her off at the theater and she is in with a friend. I thought of going to downtown Mountain View and seeing about this <a href=""http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2006/08/free-citywide-wifi-in-mountain-view.html"">Google free WiFi </a>network that they have installed in their ""hometown."" The logging in was not very smooth, but eventually it worked (duh! this post is done that way).
The good thing is sticking to Starbucks. It would have been better to drive to downtown to the mom/pop coffee places, but it is best to be across from the theaters, and this area for the movie theaters (where Google dominates) is so silicone valley sterile that nothing else could open up. Since Starbucks charges for WiFi access via Tmobile, it is great that the WiFi spot from Google is just about 100 feet away at the intersection (on a light post). It is sure unsightly: no the access point, but the relay antenna. I wonder about the aesthetic of cities with wireless this and wireless that (and next year will be the deployment of WiMax in full -- may be in the US too). Of course, it is not like people admire light posts... 

<strong>EDIT</strong>: Do men here ever go out and buy shirts? most men here are wearing company polo-shirts. Not that it is nothing new, but it seems like an epidemic in these parts. With so many outlets close by, one would think that they could still get some polo shirts at a great discount (though not free).

Is there an alternate to Xjournal to post to LJ? When using a non-browser to make entries, I started with iJournal, but Xjournal was a better product. Now, with the Intel macBookPro, version 1.0.4 crashes, and 1.0.5 is full of bugs to make it more of an annoyance than something productive. The other macs I own are running 1.0.4, but 1.0.3 seems to be the one that works in the Intel machines.

someone wants to use a photo of mine for an album cover. A download-only album cover for iTunes and other sites. I have no idea how to come up with a flat fee for that! At the moment, I can only think of charging the same price as a print of the photo, and limit its use to online distribution. I mean, it is just 600px by 600px @ 72dpi, which cannot be enlarged for much else.

... but with the smarts of Gromit.

Just by happenstance, two weeks ago I did not have any cheese -- though I overloaded on bread -- and I figured to extend the avoidance for a bit longer. After all, I have not gotten back on the bike and there is a little bit of expansion, or reconfiguration, going on: the girlish figure is not being looked after, as it were.

Today, 17 days into it... it ended. I first just grabbed some bread, and somehow, that was not good enough: I had to add something to it. Cheese was the only answer.

However, I think that I can stay off it for a while now, at least as an incentive to get back on the bike.

Now, back to the important things in life... like some LJ entries!!! :)

The journal is friends-only at this point. Just post here if you want to be added, or wait until I notice that you added me. I post mp3s and discuss music under a particular filter... please note if you want to be added. 

If you are here because of <lj user=""pixelstains""> just say so, and I will add you.


cheers!

Now I go and take pictures. But, I do feel out of place... t-shirt and shorts are really not fitting with the colourful display of swim wear at most beaches -- except perhaps at a nudist beach.

So, thanks to <lj user=""relativid"">, I should start a petition that this company (<a href=""http://www.wholesomewear.com/page-3.html"">wholesomewear</a>) furnish men with a similar array of choices for my beach needs... even if I am not going into the water.

It is just right.

"event","Steps to do!

1. Leave me a comment saying, ""Interview me.""
2. I will respond by asking you five questions. I get to pick the questions.
3. You then update your LJ with the answers to the questions.
4. Include this explanation and an offer to interview someone else in the same post.
5. When others comment asking to be interviewed, you get to ask them five questions.

Questions from the turtle!

1 - Tell me the story behind your lj username. If you don't have one, make one up.

I'm gonna assum that the drunk part is self explanitory being also all of the contacts on my LJ have either been with me for drunkness or have seen videos/heard stories.

The penguin part comes from a little stuffed stress relief squishy penguin that I got back in high school. In high school me and a friend we in a computer multimedia class and the final project was to make an animation (I forget which program we id it in) which would be presented to the class. The teacher desided to make it kind of a acadamey awards sort of thing and the teacher bought a bunch of different dollar store stress ball like thingies. 

Me and my friend were partners for this project, and we did fairly well (Hee hee hee plunger gerbil). And when it came time to collect our ""awards"" there was one penguin left on the table and we both wanted it. So it became a race down to the stage to collect it, there proabablty was kicking and tripping but I cannot remember, but I was able to get my hands on the penguin (sorry fishy) and I have it to this day.

2 - Tell me about the saddest moment in your life.

This one is hard to say. I've had very important and special people close to me leave this world, to its hard to place one in a more important possibtion than another. But when ever someone leaves this world that affects me so I would have to say naturally those are the saddest events.

3 - Zombies have overrun the world. They began at the start of your regular shift. At the end of your shift, we have temporarily secured the call center and have the entire contents at our disposal. The cafeteria will feed us for a maximum of 4 days. Detail your plan of action and the expected results. Brownie points will be awarded for alternate scenarios and vivid death scenes involving different people you know.

Well I'm gonna assume that the zombies are the Dawn of the Daed kind that can run.

Day 1 

As soon as the building is secure, start creating lots of any sort of weapon to fend of the beasties. Preferably any thing bladed or sharp and pointy, because I doubt that there's a secret stash of shotguns at work... But check the TL's / OPs stations anyways, for anything which maybe usefull, managment must have some sort of weapon/tourture device.

Start posting gaurds (not the standard guards we have here) to watch for any breach in the defences. 

One that is set, find a stero and start playing Richard Cheeses version of down with the sickness over and over, in an attempt to weed out the people who cannot focus on staying alive. Then send these people outside to allow the cafeteria provissions to last longer. While sending these people out, volentell one to become an experiment. 

With the subject person, attempt to determine how zombieness is transffered test things like contact with blood/saliva, or if a full bite is required. Also determine how long zombieness takes to engage. One the subject is zombied, Quarentine subjkect into hddle rioom to determine how long zombies can last w/o feedings to determine if it's possible to outlast zombie seige.

Start attempting to make contact w/ any other survivors via any means possible, ie if phones still work, but knowing the wiley zombies, they'll mess the phone lines up somehow. If the milling zombie population is still low, send squads out into the parking lot to sifon gas from the cars which we known the owners will no longer need. Then store the gas for later use in defence. 

Day 2

If unable to make contact with other survisors, take voulenteers to head out and locate other surviors/provisions. Send 2 four person parties to closest Mall to locate usefull suplies, ie go to walmart to get guns.

Start collecting various heavy objects (monitors, computers, chairs, Cubical walls) on the roof for dropping down onto the mass of zombies below in case of escape is required.

Day 3
Determine if test zombie is weaking due to lack of feedings and if out lasting seige is possible.

If possible
     wait out seige.

Else 
     Start preparing escape plan. 

Escape plan

Use syphoned gas to make fire bombs to start thinning out the zombie hord that has collected on one side of the building. Let them burn for a while untill they stop moving.

Devide up the people into multiple 3 person groups, and one group to remain at the building. Then devide up the remaining food for the groups, hopefully after the first day of elimination, there will be about 2-3 days worth of food left.

The three person groups are given roles of driver, supply carrier and defender. The people remaining at thw building go to the roof and prepare to drop the collected heavy items onto the remaing zombie hord to clear a route for the 3 person groups just before the groups make a break for various cars.

Driver just makes a mad dash to a car and get it started. Supply carrier takes the food, and defender deals with any zombies that interfere with dash to cars. Once at the cars. The groups set of in search for any other surivors while the food lasts, and collecting more stores as they go. If the search party locates another group, they return to the building and collect the remainer of the people and leave message for the other scouts w/ location of others.  If scouts do not locate any body for 2 days, they return to the building for replanning.

And now the alternate ending!

If the zombies break through the defences at any time, the guards will make every attempt to delay the zombies as the rest of the people attempt to get upstairs and block of the exits there. However Depending on if there is any ex 'B' people remaining at this point or not, will deside my corse of action, cause I'm not gonna be stuck like a sardine in a can upsatirs w/ no way out.
If there are 'B' people left, I will stay and fight the hord off. If not, I make my own way to the hills in ssearch of friend who have survied or a good hinding spot like ducts.

4 - Where were you born, where have you been, and where are you going?

Born here! I've been over there *points in random direction*. *shrug*


5 - What physical object, that you have in your possession, do you treasure most, and why?

Inanimate object . House because its my very own place. No crazy family members there at all hours.
Animate object . My cat Grey! Because she's a cat!"

"event","Ok, I've come to the conclusion that I need shoes that make a squeek when I walk. Why you might ask, I figure that they would be both functional and fun!

Fun = Walking around the mall while your shoes are making a sqeek noise, would confuse the mass of humanity. And as everyone knows, confusing the mass is a good thing.

Functional = When walking up to a person, they will know you're there and you will not scare the crud out of them when they turn around. Something which happens quite frequently in the work place."

"event","So I went on lunch break at work and I had a pizza bun to eat.  Headed down to the cafeteria and opened the microwave, put the food in and started the thing up.  *Ding* foods done, so I took the food out.  Now you should be aware that the microwave has a metal handle with a shiny silver plating on it. As I pushed the handle to close the microwave, my fingers slid along the handle.  But near the bottom on the handle, the shiny plating is falling off, and as my finger got to the bottom of the handle, *POKE*, a sliver of the plate jumped into my finger.  So food in one hand and staring at the wounded finger, I waddle back to my desk and start complaining and trying to dig the sliver out with pliers.  Now a co-worker offerer to get his tweezers from his car.  He comes back with tweezers and magnifying glass in hand and the operation begins.  But the situation was hopeless, the sliver is buried too deep.  So there is stays, embedded in my finger.

But, on the plus side, I took out my trusty duck tape and headed for the microwave.  I tapped that handle up good.  *Hee hee hee* I got to duck tape something in the workplace!!!!"

Some one mentioned a purple nurple, my instincts, protect my nipples!  Covering them, causes two people to start laughing, and it cascaded from there.... untill every one was laughing and the manager was walking around wondering what was going on.  And the laughing continued for about 10 minutes!"

It's 4am cst, I've reached the bottom of my bottle of Soho, and started into my peach schnapps.
I'm trying to get pict's created for the site, but failing.... I need a better graphics program than MS paiint.  The attempts at getting the cat to drink both soho and peach schnapps have failed horribly.  I figure a cream liqu... *Grabs the empty bottle of soho*).... liqueur, yeah the cat should drink something with cream in it.  Ok that's the plan then.

The Plan:

1: Get a cream liqueur.
2: Get cat to drink the liqueur.
3a: If cat drinks the cream liqueur, have a drink with the cat.
3b: If cat doesn't drink the liqueur, more for me.

It sounds like a good plan."

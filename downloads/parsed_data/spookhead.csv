He worked with Ken Starr! After you sign the petition it is CRUCIAL that you call up your senator and urge him to filibuster, because filibusters are the coolest things ever. DO NOT BELIEVE BILL FRIST!!!! HE IS A LYING DOUCHE! Roberts is no good. Call your congressman too. This is so fucking importaint, you have no fucking clue.

"event","tonight i feel brilliant. i feel happy and tragic. there are so many thoughts in my head, the writing down is hard to do in an elequent manor, not to mention my spelling. i've always wondered about being a writer, and if i could actually pull it off. I know I couldn't. It saddens me to think about the things I won't be able to do in this life. It doesn't sadden me to think about all the morons I won't meet, but more all the lovers I could've had. If I were to live like I was going to die tommorow, I would die tommorow. Which is hard. I don't want to die for a very long time. It's too hot in this appartment. Ignorance runs too high in this world. Everything moves too fast. Nothing ever pauses because time is always moving. What a frightening thought.

Everyone has days where they look in the mirror and think that they are ugly. Even the ugliest people have someone tell them they are beautiful. So why does it matter what we look like? I feel sick. I feel sick because i may never find what i'm looking for. even if i live 100 years. That I could really be alone for the rest of my life. this is reality. i am thinking about myself.  the guilt will never end that i am still here. but what can you do but give up? we are not all as strong. i'm 16 and i'm tired.

but i think it's just because it's 11:40. tommorow i'll wake up, sexed up and ready to fight another lost cause. but just because we're all ready doesn't mean we get off our ass."

"event","have you ever tasted reality?

well i have. i've seen this all work, up close and personal. i'm begining to comprehend how complex our world is, and how everything can't be solved by pretty words. The sad truth is romantics never get anything done. I won't sit around and debate who is a real pirate, infact I don't really feel like sitting around and debating anything. We're at a stand still. Ignorance is not something forgien, and anyone who thinks they have saved themselves from this disease by being well informed or taking a stand is wrong. Dead wrong. We are all victims here, just as each one of us is a killer. The blood of the world is on everyone's hands. This isn't about your stupid liberal jokes, or your fucking gun rights, or how long you stood protesting in the rain. This isn't about drugs or how much 60's music you listen to. It isn't about your education, or about your fucking snot faced opinions about who gets to die. We all live in a cloud. Not just America. Not just George W. Bush. Every single one of us who sits around here thinking that we know something. Well you don't know shit.

Because the truth is we're all the same. Every human being. This is about throwing your hate away. This is about lowering your guard. This is about learning that everything you know could be wrong. This is about America and this is about the world. We're all here for a reason. You were born with physical freedom for a reason. Our president and his regiem are not our government, and our government is not our country. I can say now that through the guilt and the shame I love America. You go stand at Lincoln's feet and tell me you don't. 

Someone saw something. This is our chance to be different. This is our chance to break the patterns of history and make our country something better than an empire. We must grow up to stand up and stand up together, because love will bring us through. By being born on this earth you were given the oppertunity to change it. So do something. Get off your ass and scream. Get off your ass and make love to someone just because you are alive and they're human, just like you. Stop talking and start moving, start writing, start kissing republicans and commies alike, because living is something we all do.

I feel so trapped sometimes. Like, what the hell am I supposed to do? I live in suburbia, it's the law I go to school everyday, and I like school. So I know what I'm going to do. I'm going to stay in school. I'm going to grow up. I'm going to work and travel and go to more school. I stopped caring about fitting or not fitting some stupid mold. Everyone from the far far right to the anarchists told me I had to do something about this stupid mold. Fuck it. Fuck everyone. This is not about society. This is about you. This is about your mind. This is about freedom. Let it all go. Let the tears run and the laughter ring and let our voices be heard by the ears of God himself because someday we will all be free. You just have to open your eyes and your heart and love your neighbor. Love him no matter who he is. Let things go from there. This isn't a phase, this is life, and life is too short.

These are just romantic words, and I am just a hypocrite. But what are we to do? I'm just going to keep talking and keep going back to washington and keep making people happy and keep learning. I'm going to do the best I can. Can you say the same?"

I feel the edges of darkness waiting to pounce and I'm not sure what it will take to stop it. Something I suppose. Here everything is so importaint and fast, I'm something special, genuine. Life's too short.

Home is reality. Home is the reality that I don't really have a home anymore. Home is therepy and working out with my mom. Home is crying. I didn't think the whole concept was so delicate untill it was smashed against the wall like an egg.

Atleast there will be no more homophobics. I've told three people my sexuality. That's how people are here. Think of me at home. I can't tell people here. 

I was also starstruck for the first time in my entire life. I honestly couldn't say anything. I blushed and stuttered. Something fantastic I can tell you that.

I'm also really sick of guys who only like preppy blonds. The do exsist. Teenagers are stupid in reality. CSW is not reality. I mean, people are stupid there too, but not this ignoraint. Not this....blond, so conventional. So turned on by conventional beauty. To them I am ugly. To the average I am ugly. How sick is that? I know it's the truth. I know I am pretty, but I'll never be pretty like them. I wouldn't mind so much, with the exception that some men are blinded by their normalness and will never lust after me like they do them. 

I feel very very sheltered. Here, I am the sheltered one. Sheltered from the real world, real people our age. The real sickness media and government has spread.

But I still don't want to go home. I don't want to go. I really don't want to go home. Because who wants to go to a broken place?"

1.If I have promised dancing (sexual) lessons to anybody, and you still want me to teach you, you must go rent dirty dancing right now. the patrick swayze version. Watch his hips. Spend serious time in the mirror trying to make your hips go like his.

2. Kissing. Go rent Brazil, watch the kissing scene and note hesitation. Note sexual tension. Remember what touch and then absent touch can do.

3. Eye contact. Everything is about eye contact. All the time.

4. Become comfortable with the same sex. They are your friends. Their bodies are your friends. Their lips, their tounges, their groins, they are all your best friends and you should cherish them.

5. Fantasy. Pray to your Lord. Masterbate to your Sex God."

"event","wow somebody told me today they actually look forward to reading my livejournal and it made me really happy. i've washed my hands like four times tonight and they keep managing to get dirty. first, this morning, i got menstral blood on them after a battle with a tampon. so i spent like 15 minutes trying to clense my hands and almost missed the bus. So then I get to school and it's so hot out. I'm sweating like the smelly motherfucker i am, and then I go play in the kitten room and get cat hair all over my sweaty gross hands. So i go wash them off again. C block I washed my face because it was hot, and managed to was my hands again. Then I'm sitting around outside the padd plays and lydia comes in with a bloody ankle. I proceed to stick my finger in the cut and rub the blood on her, saying ""oh, it'll make you look the part!"" Well that was silly. but anyway, then my hands were all blood covered and i held my finger out to david and told him to lick my finger, so he did. then i tried to get colin to lick it, and eventually he did too. so now i had blood, and david and colin's spit on my hands, so i went to wash them again. what a dirty girl am i.

the plays were good, we had a wee goof in mine, but it was no big deal. it was fun. i spent all of d-block with colin and david, that was fun. it also put me in a very outgoing sexual mood, as hanging out with boys does. i swear, the things i do to contain myself. ha, raise your hand if you'd like to see tori break free! it'll happen one of these days.  oh dirty thoughts, dirty thoughts.......lord, and i'm supposed to get homework done? i'm going to have to sit here and contemplate these thoughts for a while heeheeheeee.

it may also have been the shirt i wore today. i walked into the kitten room this morning and three people said ""hot shirt tori"". right off the bat. it's like EEEEGGOOOO BOOOOOOOST! not like i need one. but i do need one. you can never tell a girl how sexy she is too much. i did feel very sexy without a bra. i don't think i've actually gone out in public without a bra since i started wearing bras. what a liberating feeling, that there is only one piece of cloth between you and the world, there's no false poking or proding, padding or pushing, just you. someone could've just come up and stuck their hand down my shirt. there's nothing stopping them. except maybe my hot kung foo moves. but i think anyone who did happen to stick their hand down my shirt would have full approval. mmmmm maybe i'll make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. doesn't that sound good? almost as good as my tits. okay, now really, i'm just cracking myself up. i am sitting here laughing. and typing. and generally amusing myself at the thought of other people being amused by this. mostly because i hate the word tits. and panties. tits and panties. god awful words. breasts, boobs, there really isn't a proper word for the two things sitting on my chest. knockers! that is truely the superior slang term for the bust.

don't wonderful things come out of your head when you're avoiding homework? now all I can think of is gene wilder going ""what knockers!"" and whatserface going ""why thank you doctor!"""

To lie here and die among the sorrows
Adrift among the days
For everything I ever said
And everything I've ever done is gone and dead
As all things must surely have to end
And great lovers will one day have to part
I know that I am meant for this world
My life has been extraordinary
Blessed and cursed and won
Time heals but I'm forever broken
By and by the way...
Have you ever heard the words
I'm singing in these songs?
It's for the girl I've loved all along
Can a taste of love be so wrong
As all things must surely have to end
And great lovers will one day have to part
I know that I am meant for this world
And in my mind as I was floating
Far above the clouds
Some children laughed I'd fall for certain
For thinking that I'd last forever
But I knew exactly where I was 
And I knew the meaning of it all
And I knew the distance to the sun
And I knew the echo that is love
And I knew the secrets in your spires
And I knew the emptiness of youth
And I knew the solitude of heart
And I knew the murmurs of the soul

And the world is drawn into your hands
And the world is etched upon your heart
And the world so hard to understand
Is the world you can't live without
And I knew the silence of the world

the one nice thing is that i have been in just my underwear since about 6 last night. lounging around your own house in your underwear is such a privilege. sorry again to anyone i had plans with this weekend, it was seriously the weekend from medicine hell."

i wish i had something meaningful to say or write. i wish my brain spewed something besides useless nonsence. i wish i wasn't in such a sorry state. i wish i was worth something. for i feel worthless. i feel like a no good nothing. i feel like all the fakeness that surrounds me is getting it's revenge. as i lay there crying last night i realized that no one ever sees me cry. no one knows me, not really. it's my fault too. no one else is to blame but me, for putting up these walls. maybe i'm protecting myself, or maybe i'm just scared. either way, what my little world sees and what is really there are very different. but really, i'm not sure anyone cares. everyone is happy with the way i present myself.  no one would like the inside me. the intense, bizzare, broken me. i am a broken child, nothing else. my home, my heart, my mind. 

i wish i was a better person."

Maybe I'll get some good advice from her too. Cause that's what I need right now. Goooood advice. Terri already gave me a bunch, it's just so hard to actually communicate with people. I feel so akward and nervous talking to someone in person, i wish i could just go ahead and do it only, life would be easier that way. However, when talking about relationships, you should always be right next to the person. or that is my policy. i just feel so goddamned nervous and shy. yeah, me, nervous and shy. welcome to the side nobody ever sees. we see hyper tori and horney tori and depressed tori and angsty tori, but nervous, akward, and shy? never. she's to shy to come out haha. however, some communication is going to have to be done on my part, otherwise i just put people in shitty situations. myself included. i need to look them in the eye and say "".......i want you, i don't want a monogomus relationship, i don't want a boyfriend, i want a secret relationship, i want no jelousy, and i want solid communication. if you don't like me romanticly, i'm totally fine with that, if you don't like these terms i'm fine with that too. i can deal with rejection."" but lord, here i am, being vauge on my livejournal of all places. i think he knows who he is. but he'll never know for sure if i don't bleedin tell him.

and what of the other one? i don't know if he's mature enough for this. i don't know if the first one is mature enough for this. oh but i most definatly like the idea of kissing this one. my ears are turning red thinking about it. whoa. weird shit. i think he likes me too which is most definatly a plus. but with so many little flaws? i just don't know. i don't know much of anything at all.

this is a shitty entry. i really don't want any of this at all. i want my real lover to come home, and for us to curl up in bed together and read vonnegut or watch surrealist film. paint my walls. eat french chocolate. drink a good cider. cheese! we'd have to eat cheese, from all over the world. god i love cheese. cheese, chocolate, apples and cider. a deck of cards for blackjack. cigars haha. a tv with no cable but a huge movie collection. all the mind fuck shit and tons of horror movies. cats. i like cats. all in our little stone cottage on the coast of wales. every day we'd go out sailing and catch fish no matter the weather, bask in the sun in the summers, wrap up infront of the fire in the winter. oh what heavens we dream up.

if you read through all the shit above, i'd say it's worth it for the last part. and for gods sake, don't ask who these people are, i'm not going to tell you, except the two of you involved.

but still, despite all this, i'm spending the weekend with evan. evan's the best, i think the only guy friend of mine that i havn't kissed. it's so nice to have an entirely platonic male friend, i kind of miss them. although i do enjoy the sexual attention. i suppose it's all about balance."

<P>well, this weekend has been a rocky one. I spent friday night with Kate, which I thoroughly enjoyed. We talked about some bitchy people in our lives. And we watched twin peaks. I'm not sure how many times I've seen these episodes now. It's been a lot. We also had chinese food which was gross but good. that's the way arlington chinese food is.</P>
<P>&nbsp; then saturday i went to shakespeare, which was good. then i went to the peace confrence in boston, quite an eye opening experience. i was one of three white people in the workshop. i was a minority, something i am definatly not used too. it was a good experience, but it definatly got inside me and wormed it's way in my brain for a while. after, there weren't many people i knew, so i left and walked around boston. i ended up walking from back bay station to the hynes convention center station. for those of you who don't know boston, that's a pretty long walk. i got back to alewife and waited for quite a while for a bus, gave up, and began to walk home.</P>
<P>&nbsp; well, i took the long root. somehow i ended up in belmont on the other side of rt. 2. no clue how. walked a really long way. i finally got the pleasent street, but i was on the other side of the bridge that goes into belmont. lake view is a little hike from there, but i'd already walked maybe 2-3 miles that day. all of a sudden, what do i see, but a silver pt cruiser, with the licence plate ""crooze"". i recognized helen's dad's car immediatly, and waved, to be friendly. then bob weeks pulled over and gave me a ride the rest of the way! it was weird, because i hadn't seen him in a very long time. i always got the feeling that he wished i was his daughter instead of helen. ofcourse, that's a terrible thought. and i know it isn't so. still...it was very strange. he also hadn't heard that my parents were spliting up, which i found odd because i'm almost certain my mom has shared it with the mom's group. </P>
<P>&nbsp; in any case, i got home, spent the evening with nina watching the same twin peaks over again, and woke the next morning at 11. so it was basicly sunday/today that was shitty, the rest of the weekend was pretty good. today i skipped my soccer game, and then went to my mom's concert in boston. it was really good, but i spent most of the time holding back tears. i was really emotional today, and i'm not really sure why. i hadn't bathed in four days, so when i got home i took a long long bath. it ended up being really long because i spent an hour in sexual fantasy. in the bath tub. the reason i bring this up, is because it's so rare. to spend that much time day dreaming in hot water, well, i just don't do it. it was suprisingly very nice, although phyiscally i still can't make myself go past the slightly aroused stage. now it was about a particular person, and i'd bet money that someone somewhere reading this wishes it was them. who particularly, i'm not sure. but someone. if you'd like to prove me right, i always enjoy hearing it. but it wasn't you, i can gurentee it. it was a man, and it's wasn't a fictional charactor. dale cooper is still hot sex though.</P>
<P>&nbsp; so now, it my incredibly sexual state, i'm supposed to do homework. i'll get it done. i have to. </P>
<P>the exciting news is, not only am i finding boys my own age slightly attractive again, i am also finding girls very attractive. cross dressing ones to be specific. hot sex!</P>"

I know he must love his wife a lot. I know he loves me too though, in some strange sick way, for understanding him, and because he understood me and he knew it ment something. it's like sometimes he could see inside me and see my future. he knows where i'm going, i wouldn't be suprised if he could tell you right know the name of every single man and woman i will sleep with in my entire lifetime. he's funny like that. i wonder some days if i'll ever really see him again.

I played a soccer game where i was unusually shitty. then i came home, ate junk, showered, slept, woke up for dinner, went to bed. today was just pure shit. i got my period this morning. i desided not to go to shakespeare because i felt so shitty. i should have gone. dad called. it felt so terrible talking to him. i don't know why. i miss him. i slept for several hours, then ate bagel bites which made me feel worse. then mom came home. i had math tutoring, took a test, i think i did okay. fucking cramps. now my sister is doing homework and all she's doing is complaining.  i fucking wish she'd shut up. she's such a pain. i really hate her right now. i want to yell at her, but that would just cause more shit from her.

i hate being in this house with these three women, but i hate being at the apartment with my dad too. everything just sucks so bad right now. i know people care. i know people love me. but there's a difference between knowing you're loved and feeling you're loved. no amount of hugs or baked goods or soft words can penetrate this feeling of alone. i love you all so much (especially your baked goods, i love those very much). it's just this gap between me and the rest of the world. even my bed is not safe anymore. it reeks of gas and blood. my mind is strewn with sex, death, and absence of love. i don't know what to do anymore except sleep and wake up again. and try not to bite my nails. because biting my nails won't make anything better.

i know there's someone who will take me into his arms and make a cave for me to cry. i don't feel safe crying here. it's not my place. it's not my place to be here, i don't belong here. i just hate this so much. i've got to run now, before someone sees my eyes swell with tears and thinks me selfish. i'm selfish. yes, that's me."

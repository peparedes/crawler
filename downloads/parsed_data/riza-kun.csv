"event","So..........I gots my new car! WOOT!  I pimped out the stereo on it just like the previous cars.....only thing is I had to get new speakers for the back....
Normally most cars come standard with a 6X9, 6X8, 4X6, or etc... back speakers.  No this one comes with 6 1/2 round speakers in the back......Weird I thought, but the new 6 1/2 memphis speakers I bought for it are very sexy.  My new memphis speakers have a lifetime waranty on them so............BOOYAH!

Anyway, I know it has been forever ago, but here is the AI update.
This year was pretty good, but I thought that AI just went downhill a little.  This year instead of the good ramen they had normal cup ramen like from walmart.  In previous years they had Dosirac ramen........which is great ramen in my opinion.  Also, this year I didn't stay in the con hotel because of one person saying hey I am reserving a room for everyone........and then not letting certain people room with him......(me for one.....cause he wanted to look cool for all his new friends coming) so I ended up taking up a group of 10 myself......some that were rooming with him, but they decided they didn't care for his crap and came with me instead.
I stayed at my Mom's in Cedar Rapids instead.......it was fun in some aspects, but I think it is so much more fun staying at the Con Hotel.

Overall I would say it was a fun weekend, I was pretty happy with AI......despite the smaller hotel.......the con suite was just all bleh this year(that con room was way too small, like put clowns in a tiny car)

Anyway that is the biggest update I am gonna give.......so eh........cry about it"

"event","Well........I am excited :)  I am getting a car this weekend.  It is a year older then my car, but much less shitty!  It is a 93 Subaru Impreza.  It's got Turbo, and even a Sunroof!  The kicker is that my mom is buying my grandparents car (her parents).  So she will be buying my grandparents Chrysler 300M for 6k so she is selling her car.  So since I showed some interest in it she originally told me she would sell it for 600 and I would still have to replace the front windshield.  So she called me yesterday asking if I was sure I wanted to buy her car.  I told her yes...........and she is selling it too me for 400.......WOOT!  Plus she is going to pay to fix the front windshield......(only bothering to replace it cause otherwise it won't pass Missouri inspection...........she lives in Iowa)

So.........AWESOME......I am going to Des Moines this next weekend to pick it up.

BooYah!"

"event","Well I haven't posted anything in a LONG TIME!  Felt I should say something.

Well a couple days ago I went to the Smoke Shop to see if they had any decent tobacco I could use in the Hookah.

BTW...Obviously I bought a hookah......actually I convinced my friend Tony to buy me one when he went to Egypt.  Yeah true it is pretty Gheto......But it is totally Egyptian Authentic Gheto!  Well anyway, It wasn't smoking very well the other day and I finally realized that there was a whole bunch of crap in the hose that somehow didn't wash out.........seemed like i cleaned it all the way, but the crap in the stuck to the sides like cholesterol to an artery.

Going on with the post....I bought a pipe while I was in the Smoke Shop that day.  I normally would never buy a pipe, but I just couldn't help it.  I is a very nice red pipe and the 9 dollar price tag just seemed too tempting.  It even comes with this BadAss Leather pouch.  In fact I am gonna smoke it after I am done with this Cigar!

On other notes.......Danny wrecked his Truck........Some retards where basically in the middle of this road backing their car around to turn around right by the top of a hill.........mind you this is a gravel road out of town.....so of course people are going to be driving at least 60 mph coming over this hill.  So Danny barely managed to not hit their car and T bone it cause they defiantly woulda died.  Luckily Danny also barely managed to not role his own truck.....point made though.......his truck won't be going anywhere for quite a while.

Steph graduated from basic this weekend.....not that is matters, because more and more lately she seems to say things that piss me off more and more.

P.S.  AnimeIowa was a BLAST.......I will make another post just for it sometime........anyway......I got shit to do and a Pipe to smoke.....

PEACE!"

I am tired of the world doing good and I am going by smoothly and then shit happens.   It's just that life constantly does that no matter how you life is going it will never be predictable!  I like my life unpredictable, but I would like some great shit to happen instead of all the overwhelming crap and depression."

I will be moving into an Apt. in about 2 month's (1st of May) I really wish I knew where I was going to move into.  I would really like to move into The Burch's or say Fox Cove or Fox Alley............Fox Alley and Fox Cove never seem to be in the Office or answer the phone.........and they never seen to give you calls back.

The Burch's 2 bedroom's are nice, but Willo and I don't want to just decide on something and go with it.  I wouldn't mind just being satisfied with The Burch's, but I understand that we want to look at all the options.

Now the thought of renting a house has come into play.  I don't know that I want to pay all the utilities that are involved with renting a house.............plus me and Willo don't need a house, and I can't really think of anyone that I would want to room with us.

Who knows I will let all know what I decide on ^.^

Anyway, I got the new Sonic game for the Wii.  I haven't played it yet, but it looks pretty good :)

BRACE FOR IMPACT.............BOOM!  raditor welcome the exit 53 sign.......

No one is hurt Willo was wearing her seat belt and so was I.  I am now offically PISSED.  No car but that wasn't gonna stop me.

Danny and Steph were about 15 min behind us.  They looked at the car a bit and I finally say LETS GO!  On the Best Buy were I am still PISSED about my car, but if I am gonna drive all that way and wreck my car I was DAMN WELL GETTIN A Wii!

So, I have my Wii and my Dad gave me his car to use.  All were just glad we were safe, even the troops,  THANK GOD they weren't bitches like the other 2 I have had to deal with.  The car looks fixable.

Great story about how I got my Wii though ^.^

"event","Well the weekend at Worlds of Fun was great.  Although this overtime at work is suckin up my weekends.  1 day weekends are crap!  I still am making sure to have plenty of fun on my one day off so it makes up for the day I get the shaft and have to go to work. Next weekend is CJ's wedding so regardless I will take of this weekend if we get overtime.  That way I can make the 5:30-6 hour drive to the wedding.  I will probably stop by and visit my mom after the wedding too.  She lives about an hour away from where the wedding is at.  Tony is going to be in town wednesday so that he can go to the wedding.  So that way I can have Willo meet Tony and we can hang out a couple days before me and Tony make the trip to the wedding.

Willo's birthday weekend was a lot of fun although it had its unneeded drama too.  All in all, Excellent weekend.  

Tony will have to chill with me and Willo sometime before he leaves back out for Idaho.  I still don't understand what could possibly be in Idaho that he won't come back to Missouri! Stupid him!

Answer me this:  Why do we live life? Why are we here?  What is life about?  I just can't blieve in a religion right now.  I can't believe that there is a hell or heaven right now.  What I see out off all of this is why is sucide so wrong.  If there is no heaven or hell then it just ends there life where it is.  There are abortions that are concidered ok.  There is still birth, there is death, there is murder........why is suicide so bad?  Anyway, if someone responds to this maybe I will have a different view to look at to understand this.

"event","So.....it's been a long time since I updated this.  Lots has happened.  Danny and Steph are going out....even if I don't think it is a great deal.......I hope things are real between them and that Steph isn't just bein a player....  Willo's parents are gone for a month again so I am actually getting some alone time with Willo so we can talk and watch movies or whatever we so choose.  Ryan is going back on depression medication which is a good thing.  Ryan has also decided any time I am with Willo it seems like he is a royal ass towards me and pretty much everyone, and if Willo wasn't there with us I feel that I would just beat the shit out of him, because it just ticks me off that he does this shit.  If he is going to be a jerk and just make himself unwanted then he should just stay at home and quit all his shit.  So, I really honestly want him to go live with mom or someone until he gets his own place or whatever, because he has royaly messed up his life and any chance of anything in this town.  He keeps pushing people away and secluding himself.  Anyhow, it seems to me that things are starting to work themselves out.

After this weekend things go back to normal at work.  So I will be workin 5 day weeks again now that all of the shutdown time has finally been made up.  We might even be able to get in some overtime so we can get some larger paychecks and get my loan paid off.  So that hopefully I will actually have some money to pay for college this spring so I can take at least a couple online courses.  I hopefully will move my ass and check for some grants and scholarships and stuff like that online too and see what all I can do.

Danny has his new job and he really seems to like it.  It is relaxed atmosphere like at Movie Magic, but he makes about as much as me now.....9 an hour; good thing is that he doesn't have to put up with all the crap he did at Movie Magic.  So it seems that things are going good for everyone finally.  Although, his external hard drive (Kilo) died.  It is still under warrenty so they are going to send him a new one.  

I am loooking for a new job also, because I would like to get off of nights and be able to work mornings and have benifits so I am looking into a job with my dad's company and a couple others, but I won't leave Kawasaki until I have a for sure job somewhere.

They told me over the phone that my hotel room would get the 89 dollar con rate all 3 days and it obviously didn't!!!!  I was carged 375 instead of 300 so that could have been all my gas here and back 75 those liers!!!  I am going to talk to them about it today but it is totally lame.  I am thinking about only saving what money i desperately have to to get by when I get back.  We will see cause that is major unhappiness when people lie and rip you off.  Not to mention I would have more money if Vova didn't get laid off,  Or if CJ wouldn't be a retard and just fork over some money to stay in the room at AI instead of sleeping in his car.

I understand that he kinda has anger issue's and that he has depression and ADD, but he is the one who refuses to take meds for it.  He thinks they do nothing for him.  I understand his thinking, because I have ADHD and depression and don't take meds because I can cope with it, but yet Ryan won't listen and take my advice of taking the meds and see if there is a difference for the better.  It doesn't bother me that he wants to make his own decisions it is just that he is being unsociable and a straight up jerk to me and the majority of people.  He is just so upset about life in general and instead of doing something about it he is just bitching about it.  FRIGIN A!  OK.  My rant is over for now.  If anyone has a tip maybe send me a reply.

"event","So............I went to court today for my bogus C&I ticket.  Didn't get to say a word and they told me I had to go back in a week.  I am pleadin not guilty!!! They just want my money and keep moving the date, because they want someone to prosecute me, because they know that they don't have anything on me!!! STUPID PLATTE COUNTY!  Anyway, That was a wasted 2 hours in the car and half a tank of gas :(    Yet!!!  I saved the trip by going to St. Joe :)  Ended up getting some manga (battle angel alita: Last order book 6, and the first of each set of......Qwan, Saber marionette J, and RG VEDA (clamp is awesome ;)....)) I also bought the entire EscaFlowne anime for only about $37 counting taxes :)  Plus, I also got Yakuza Demon! It looks pretty good the movie is by Takashi Miike.  All aside the trip was worth it.......BTW since Byrd doesn't use his LJ, I am letting you all know that he has an interview at 9 this morning for working at a hotel :)  Yay! about time he left Movie Magic!  Anyway, just remember that Platte County is stupid!"

He seems very cool...only just met him, but it seems like we aren't ever gonna have a prob with getting along.  Rachael.....hmmm....Rachael is interesting.  Seems like someone that I could hang with and never seem to get nervous around :).  She is almost like one of the guys.  But, not quite.......I will leave it at that lol.  Awesome part of the day was that Rachael bought a new swimming suite (basically a bikini)......Too bad that she wouldn't model it for us.......*:(  Hmmmm.... I would have liked to see that.  I really enjoyed there company, and we will definately have to hang out more often :)  To bad all the really cool friends live in KC and Iowa...:(  Well.....I guess that is all for my entry today :)"

"event","This is for you Kitty!  If something needs to be disscused or you have a problem with something please tell me, or the group.  We will do whatever is best for the group and take in all opinions :) Since you and I kinda medate the group anyway lol!  

In other news!  I would like to understand why it is exactly that anything anyone postes always gets taken out of context and then people start taking an offense to it?  I just don't understand this.  I don't understand why people can't take into consideration that posts are to be viewed as merely an overall question or concern.  Unless you specifically set out to bash someone then people should keep an open mind about things.  

Anyway, Vova has gotten his job at Kawasaki back ^^, Kinda weird not to see him up playin guild wars or something when I get home in the morning :P  Also, Naka-kon Is going to be awesome!  Also, I think I might finally know how to fix my car so hopefully it will be up and running like it should be and not the way it is now :(  (JUST KILL THE CAR ALREADY) huh huh who said that :@  anyway that is all for now....."

The Real question for this post is......Should I pierce my ears?  Yes or No?  Let me know people!  I am thinkin maybe 1 in the right and 2 in the left.  Mainly, I am piercing them for cosplay possiblities; so that I can play cosplay for characters that have piercings better.  LET ME KNOW!! NOW!!! TELL ME YAY OR NAY!"

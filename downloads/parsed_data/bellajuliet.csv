"event","hey! i finally got a code to have one of these journals so its all good. im in study hall right now with michelle and kyle and its only tuesday which sucks cuz i hate being in school. we only have 19 more days left :) yay im gonna have so much fun this summer and hopefully i will not be comin back here to this school next year. me and michelle are scared of mr budd our english teacher and we have his class next which aint coo. i wish people in our school could be more real and not embarass themselves all the time. like a few girls i know. they know how to harass and threaten people like me and michelle online but would NEVER come up to us in person. they live on the computer and heres a message to them: dont be talkin shit if u aint gonna do anythin. and i hate when people cant defend themselves. hahah its so pathedic when they have to start gettin other people to do it for them. anyways im finally gonna have a job for this summer and i cant wait. i miss my man Luke sooo much ((Baby i love you)) and i hope you feel better. prom was this past weekend and i had the best time with *Luke* and i got to meet a lot of his friends who are mad cool ha. the bell's gonna ring, bye"

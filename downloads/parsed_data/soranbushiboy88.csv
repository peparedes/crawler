"event","Im going to bitch so if you dont want to read this... stop reading now

Im fucking fed up of being old and single and mean old man.

I am a mean old man! I am such a thing because i can't fucking stand immature things people do. I was told the other day that most first marriages fail because the two people complete each other instead of compliment. You know like  young guy likes to read and cooks dates younger guy who like sto get slutty on the dance floor at clubs, try drugs and doesn't remember how he got home.

guess which guy i am.

Im not bitter that im single, im beyond bitter about that, im pissed off at my ex for how crappy they were as people. So perhaps i am jaded


Yes i have a job that pays me money, no im not a clothes whore, yes i have savings, so why the fuck should people bitch to me about how i make them spend money, I dont spend money! how do you think i have SAVINGS! sheesh.

Im bitter and mad at people who are inconsiderate. I try not to be, I try to hear the other side, I try not to pass judgement till i have heard everything, I try to keep an open mind and give people the benefit of the doubt. But so often is that abused, so often do people not care, so often do people think that because i do that im week and passive and non caring. Well for starters when people tell me what im thinking they are already on my shit list. Secondly dont you ever dare think that i have no opinion and that i dont care. More often then not i have an opinion but i may decided instead of forcing my preferences onto you that i will go with the fucking flow. 3rdly just because im not a brash insentive person who makes divisse statemsn doesn't mean you are allowed to nor does it mean you can make them to me. This especially hurts when people who say it SHOULD KNOW BETTER because they have been trained by school or work OR because of the position they hold.

So often this shit fest that i feel is flung at me forces me to respond in a manner that very much resembles a brick wall. I clam up, i dont talk, I wont yell its not my style that my fathers way. Im goign to ignore you and your little games of crap your playing, in your own little fucking world and pray to whatever god that sent you into my life to quickly become dis-interested and fucking go away.

Ultimately i will yell at somebody and become my father and scare whoever i yell at into a pile of feces filled pants, and when that day comes god help who ever owns the car they are getting a ride back home in.

I am very much a fan of the golden rule. You know ""do onto other what you would have others do onto you""

Like open the fucking door for somebody if you expect that to happen for you!

Be nice to people. And when people are nice to you dont fucking assume you can walk all over them. Dont make statements to their face that you should know they are not comfortable hearing and would never make back to you. and Dont treat them like servants in your life. 

I want to go out and fucking scream in the night until my lungs are emtpy and my throat raw from the release of rage and pissed-off-ness. I wont get to so pray that i have good morning for the next few weeks. Im oing to fucking go on vacation and hope that makes things better.

End bitching and enjoy friday"

"event","Talking with Don has helped me clarify a few things regarding how i view life. Don is a great friend who, for reasons known only to God manages to see the less then positive sometimes. Dont assume hes a pessimist, i dont think he is, he just isn't as much of an an optimist that i am!! And in our converstations i started to wonder why am i so damn happy?

I have come to a reason; perception. I see things in a completely different light. Where others see failure i see a POC, where others see abject horror i see what could be worse, where others see a highly complicated mess i see a highly complicated mess that at least has some boundaries. 

This is not to say i have perfect insight, i am human i am flawed to the core, riddleled with eronious errors and im sure my misspelling origionate in my DNA having a great abundance of misspellings. 

That being said, i think that when i see a problem i look at it and think how it could be worse. I got this from China, from Roots, from Failing to find my village the first time and having to pick up the broken peices of my soul and super glue them back together with hope.

And when confronted with a situation i try my best, i just do it even if it means i will fail. Why? Because of Sensei. Because of him I know what it feels like to fail and more importantly i know what it feels like to fail and let down somebody who doesn't even have a comment for you on how to get better, just shakes his head. Its horrid yes, but it makes you fearless. 

I still have my flaws. which i shall now list

* I dont like to confront people with my problems because i feel if i tell you why im mad with you and you change because of that, your not really changing to prvent the problem in the future your changing because of guilt. So i dont voice my opinion that often.

* I am a habitual liar! I can pass a lie detector because i do believe myself when i say things, i legitimize it on some level, this is because small lies i dont think hurt people especially considering how the truth can hurt people and how BIG lies can save people... 

* I plan in advance, when i make a plan with a person and my schedule is open i dont put them in pencil, i comitt to it, its what adults do, you dont renig on your word. Its called being reliable. If you said ""Hey March 21st 2015 can you get me from the airport"" I would note it and come 2015 if i was asked can i go to lunch on the 21st id say ""I can if im not at the airport picking up somebody"" Its just that simple why is it so hard to remember this? Who likes being a flake? Honestly? WHO!?

* I absolutely dislike it when people tell me or in some way think they know what i am thinking of feeling and feel the need to tell me this. Often it is wrong and 100% of the time it makes me very mad at them. for example ""Stop Hating"" makes me want to go into genetics simply to fuck up somebody and all of the prodigny. Do not classify me with people who comitt hate crimes! Sometimes i will get irrated with somebody who changes plans on me(see above point) and when people say ""ohh hes getting all bitchy watch out"" i want to stab them with a fork and twist up their intestines and veins and nerves like a fork in a plate of pasta!

These are all perceptions, interpretations of how one can view life, live in this world of crazy people, and survive. I think we make all of our problems, If i see a spider as a threat i will spend the time to hunt down its nest and burn its unborn children in the silk. I dont so its not a problem for me, but a mosquito will get that out of me... perceptions my dear, i do give a damn..."

"event","I think I have a most terriable problem; I hate idle time. and by Hate im really refering to my ability to destroy all concepts of free time by severly scheduling my days...

Monday = Taiko
Teusday = Gung fu (ok this is like tenative cause its starting to drive me bonkers that sifu is never there!! That man i know is partying it up hard in Asia... lord help them asians)
Wednesday = mostly free except for a boardmeeting once every two months..
Thursday = Dinner with Sarah, this something is is beyond penciled into my calendar its like when i bought the calender refill each year it comes printed with thursday listed with this!!

Friday = free night, though im sure Ty will never let me sleep early on a Friday

Saturday = well roots and taiko just generally fill this day
Sunday = taiko... which is nearing an end so ill kinda have sundays free, i found a flyer for a chinese drumming that meets on sundays 4-5 pm... im so tempted to go to add to my repetoire of drumming and i know sensei doesn't know that group, they dont do taiko.... haha ok so maybe if i did do it id died... 

Ok so the reason im posting this is that THIS WEDNESDAY a cantonese classes is starting up, thats 8 weeks of cantonese, 8 classes, for like 350! thats like 43.75 per class, 21 something a hour... If i take it, id barely be breaking even

my rule of thumb is if its costs less per hour then i am earning its ok to take it... right? I would miss one board meeting because of this and have 16 hours of cantonese class under my belt, Thats not too shabby.

But should i? I really REALLY want to learn cantonese simply to help out me giving back to chinatown better, not to mention just learning it in general is important, if im going to talk to grandma and to roots thingies. 

My only problem is its rather costly; CCSF where the classes also exist  im sure cost ALLOT LESS. The benefits are that it starts NOW, no waiting till september to take it like CCSF or DeAnza, and its intimate, so if i have issues they will directly fix them for me.

I dunno i have like a day to decided... ARGH!!"

"event","So im being pressure to write more. I dont mind but i remember when i first started to write in my xanga it was a result of long car rides to school, usually with the music blaring but often with the music NOT blaring and me thinking ""im driving 45 mins to class and i cant' work on ANY of my assignments while driving"" this resulted in an overabundance of mental activity not being put to use. I suppose that attributes to me not being mentaly stimulated by anybody or thing now. So my abundance of mental activity is a bit LOW, hence no idle brain farts to fill a blog.


But look here I have a thought... ok i had a though, I had a GREAT thought a profound insight into humanity and the meaning of life... I did i swear!! I dont lie!! 

[20 mins thinking]

Oh now i got it... took me a bit but being single! Being single is like taiko and as we all know taiko is like a dress. You know there are perks and horrid things with being single but I really can't change it, im not a whore i dont go slut around and there is no way in hell on the first date you are going to get me to do anymore then chat with you. Ok maybe kissses and such but seriously NO. I dont play those kinda games and i dont want a hooch that will.

I may be a prude but really im just an old fashion romantic. Wine and dine me, court me, for i shall court you. Anybody whose a friend of mine for whom i have had the brain power to spare to find the right bday present will know, i plan ahead, months ahead to make things happen. If im dating somebody id do the same. 

Maybe im just out of synch with people of my age group, i dont feel the need to find someguy at the club, drag him home, and do whatever. Its not me, even when im drunk, SHUT UP YOHANA! 

So yea, my theory for relationships is to fill my life with something that i like and i have a passion in, and when i find somebody it will be because we have somehow caught each others eye. I am not going slumming around. Then again im not a very social creature so i doubt i could slumm, SHUT UP YOHANA!

OK ill post more later today when and if i have another thought... haha

Git along LIL Doggy!!"

"event","Ok so im still thinking up titles... i mean honestly how many of these things can you write with PURE origionality?? the answer is like a bazillion to the power of googol, so ya.

Yesterday in what can be described as a fit of desperation, as chinese new years is QUICKLY approaching, I along with my mini friend, the pocket gay ty, ventured into Target and bought hair relaxer. Now here is the funny thing, Africa Queen or something like that was one of the product titles... Ty can't stop laughing and all i can think is that im going to be bald in 2hrs...

Fast forward 1 hr. we called crystal who informed us i should have gotten the kids version since its nicer on the hair to start with, and not to leave it in tooo long... since my hair isn't kinky. So here we are in Ty's bathroom, I had a plastic bag over my head around my shoulders to keep me clean, ty has these little gloves on (hes giggling almost none stop) and my Moral Compass(sarah) is there reading and guiding and ensuring that things dont get all f*cked up...

fast forward again to where im kneeling next to the tub trying to wash my head. and somebody is pouring water from a big mug onto the nap of my neck and misses!!! 

Fast forward 15 mins to when i take out the condtioner and the giggling doesn't stop and i only feel two littl ehands on my back... I think its ty's cause hes giggling almost non stop.

Another 10 mins and i felt like one of those USA movies where the person wakes up and the doctors are over him/her working furiously... they and by they i mean TY was styling my hair like a psycho... haha

Good times, but i now have straightish hair... its no longer pooofy, i just need to find a way to work it!!

Hair like either of these two would be nice...

"event","Have you ever talked with a friend(A) and not really get anything out of the conversation then a normal chat? And then you talk with a mutual friend(B) and they tell you all these new things and changes thats ocurred to your other friend(A). It used to bother me incessently, like to the state of an obcession that wasn't healthy at ALL.

I dont think i got over it but i think i just became callous to them as a friend. Its like if you dont want to tell me this stuff you dont have to, and im not going to ask, and if im invited last minute im not going to go. I suppose i dont like being an after thought, or a last minute thought. I guess its similar to wanting to be part of the popular crowd. Well i never wanted to be part of that crowd, but to be shunned by the non popular crowd, that kinda smacks you up side the head.

I guess if this was a proper rant id feel better after writing this but in reality i dont. I just feel more and more distant. I like to think im a good friend but what if im not? I can't even think what i did that would offend them other then say not be fun, or that they just dont like me. That kinda hurts more then knowing that im a jackass. Right?

In the past year i have made so many new friends and have changed so much, but not so much that id loose a friend, oddly enough it just keeps happening, this is by far the most depressing thing about getting older, loosing friends cause you change... so sad, and at the same time makes me wanna spit. expextorants aside it really kinda blows cause a few years ago i was asked to officiate friend(a) wedding, then i was bumped to invited to the wedding, then to the reception, and now i hear thats changed and even though i spoke with friend(a) on saturday apparently its changed, and not in the past 2 days... so i think its time to travel so i wont even have to be here for the wedding whenever its at.

ugh

just to make this post EVEN longer. I sometimes think i should just up and move and not tell people till the very last moment, and if i dont tell pople well... its cause i never hear from them anymore and i doubt theyd notice i moved. It makes for the easiest way to create a clean break. You dont have to deal with them if you dont see them. And since they dont call... they aren't missing anything in their lives.

ok depressing post i guess... im surprised you read it up to here.

And to end on a up-note, Don Good luck on your new job!!"

we are all such attention whores, here is an example

monday night cleaning the bathroom at dojo with yoyo... she says ""sing me a song..."" i have no songs in my head so she just starts singing so she can clean the floor with her feet... i leave briefly... and come back what song is she singing?? ""nobody knows the trouble i see..."" soooo high pitch

thankfully for my cough my voice has random Barry white moments so i busted out a ressonating version that was more appropriate...

we then sang ""I enjoy being a girl"" me in falsetto and cleaning the floor, when i turn around Jason is staring at us laughing...! HAHAHa good times..

KODO on fRIDAY!!!

i keep getting e-mail from dojo people ""OHH KODO is in town.."" blah blah blha they are soo johnny come lately I had my tickets in my grubby paws back in August.... sheesh..."

I went to europe with him and i got to know him faaaaaaar more intimately then i would have ever thought possible. Its bitter sweet but in some way fitting, that hes moving away. I have always wanted to cherish and hold onto my friends regardless of the distance between us, and this is a prime example of just finding some friend from sea of people and enjoying the time you have with them and parting ways knowing you will meet up again and tho you will change you will still be friends.

and with this one i can say.. ""well always have Venice.... and Roma, and Frienze, and Milano, and Berlin and Frankfurt, and Copenhagen and Amsterdam and London..."" HAHAHA"

I have friends that i hate at times and within the blink of an eye forget past grievances and i have friends im sure i could never hate... or at least thats what i assume. i must constantly remind myself that people change, and as I change my friends too will change. I miss some of them dearly. never again to be in my life, at least not that same way. I long for friends that in the course of decades i can bond with and contribute to their lives in a meaningful way, i.e. not be the person responsible for making them fat cause i wanted to go out to eat.

People say you can't pick your family but you can pick your friends. I highly disagree with that. Its a bold face lie. You dont get to pick your friends at all you are lucky if at some moment in your life you know enough to look at a person and see their great value to you as a friend and more importantly vice versa.

Shit happens, but so too do great friends."

"event","So one of my friends from roots lefts yesterday. And two are having a bon voyage party today.

The later too ive been a bit mad at for the majority of this summer. They just have moved to a place in my life where their actions irrate me cause i feel very second class. like im some how only worhty of being contacted as a last resort.

One moved closer to me at the beginning of the summer, and i thought I would see him more often, alas no. I dont even see him. He called last week and left a message saying ""i want to see you cause this is my last week and after this week ill have moved"" isn't it nice to know that at the end of summer he wants to see me before he goes, not sure much when he was actually here and it was conveyent. 

I used to drive all the way to SF to see them, but alas now that they like 5 mins from me i dont see them. And they want me to come to this farewell party cause they will be gone for awhile and it will be important to them... 

Im not scrapbooking no memory for them. Im just going to say i went and that i at least showed up. Once they move across the country i know i wont see them, i dont need to tell them how pissed off i have been based on their actions. It will solve NOTHING. 

I am a firm believer in that if you tell somebody you have a problem and how you would like it to be fixed, they will do what you tell them, they will go through the actions but the problem isn't fixed your just showing them the temporary fix. They should realize what they are doing is detrimental to the relationship and rectify it without you having to tell them to. Cause if they dont see that, its just for show.


I know im a hypocritical seeing that I am going to the party just for show and not cause i actually want to go, but hey life isn't perfect."

It depends on how intermixed they are. America is not a theocracy. Despite how much some people want it to be, it isn't. There are too many different people to have to be a theocracy. 
As a Christian, I do support the basics being intermixed. (But then again, so does everybody). Those being don't murder, steal, etc. If I turn the tables and imagine crazyass Tom Cruise as our prez, I wouldn't want him shoving his beliefs at me. 

Basically, there is no answer to this question because everybody, to me, has a religion. The absence of religion is a religion. Judaism, Islam, Wicca... any belief that answers the fundamental questions of life is a ""religion"" to me because it requires at least a bit of faith. 

Conclusion to long blurb: There will never be a solution because nobody will agree on it. Religion is too close and personal for people to make concessions and SIU."

Ah well, one year over, and just two more months until another begins. And so the repetitive life of an educator continues.

Dear Mr. Boot,

I am Filius Flitwick, professor of Charms at Hogwarts and Head of Ravenclaw House. It is with deep regret and sorrow that I am writing you to regarding the death of your son Terry. He was a great student, always a pleasure to teach, and I cannot properly express to you how much it pains me to lose him.

If there is anything you need from the Ministry of Magic or the school, please send a message back with this owl to Hogwarts' mediwitch Poppy Pomfrey, Headmistress Minvera McGonagall, or myself. We will do all in our power to help you. Peace be with you.

Dear Balor,

The unthinkable has happened yet again. A student was found murdered within the walls of the Castle. One of <i>my</i> students no less. And the person who found him was not a professor, but another student. It's so horrible. To have seen a corpse drowning in blood just before the Christmas holidays . . .

I think I am going to have to cut short my plans to visit you in Prague this year. There is too much work to be done here. I have to stay here at least over Christmas, so I will not travel until the 27th or 28th. I apologise if this affects your plans in any way, but I am sure you understand the predicament I am in. Please stay safe, and say hello to Hilda for me.

Ravenclaw House has suffered a tremendous loss today with the death of Terry Boot. A wonderful student and a friend to many, to say that he will be missed is an understatement. But it is times like this that we must remember that we are a strong community, and we must stick together as one. Please, if you see your fellow Housemate in any sort of trouble, try and help them. This is an incredibly hard situation to deal with, and only through friendship and family can we survive. That being said, my doors are wide open for anyone who wants to stop by and talk. You are all very special to me, and if there is anything I can do, please do not hesitate to ask. I love you all.

Dear Madame Edgecombe,

The Ministry official who delivered the potion failed to inform Marietta that it needs to be administered under strict medical supervision to deal with its various somatic responses. Not knowing this, your daughter drank nearly the whole thing at once, which is what caused her to convulse.

Let me assure you once more that Marietta is in the best of hands. There are very few, if any, Healers this side of the Atlantic Ocean more capable than Madame Pomfrey. Your daughter will be just fine, given enough time and rest.

Dear Madame Edgecombe,

The memory potion you arranged with the Ministry of Magic to deliver to your daughter Marietta arrived tonight. However, it had some unexpected physical consequences. As soon as she imbibed it, she fell into a rather violent spasm. Fortunately, her friends were nearby and prevented her from injuring herself. Draco Malfoy, Pansy Parkinson, Adrian Pucey, Michael Corner, Anthony Goldstein, and Kevin Entwhistle were able to bring her up to the medical wing, and Madame Pomfrey is currently seeing to her.

As Marietta's Head of House, it is my duty to update you on her progress. As soon as I receive word that she has awoken, I will contact you. If you wish to visit your daughter, I advise you to contact Madame Pomfrey to make such arrangements. Let me assure you that Marietta will be just fine soon, as she is in the best of care. If you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.

This spell for Mr. Shacklebolt isn't going too well yet. A normal tracking spell can be countered easily, and they wear off rather quickly, too. Even additional spells to shield it from counters or to make it last longer aren't very efficient. I could try enchanting an object with a stronger locator spell, but <strike>Ter</strike>Higgs could discard that if he ever found it out. So I'm thinking I might have to devise a curse rather than a charm. Those aren't much fun.

My books! They tried to take away my books! My copies of the <i>Ars Goetia</i>, the <i>Pseudomonarchia Daemonum</i> and the <i>Lemegeton</i> are ruined! They were gifts from my friends in Prague. They're priceless to me. And now the covers are marked and pages are ripped. How can any witch or wizard do such a thing to a spellbook? This is horrible!

And they wanted me to rip up the summoning circle on the floor of my classroom. The one that's <i>carved into</i> the ground. The one I use with my Advanced Conjuration students in March when I teach them how to summon <i>d'jinn</i> and lower <i>ifriti</i>. The one I used to teach Mr. Greengrass himself when he was one of my students. One of my own students, who knows the significance of the circle, had the gall to tell me to rip up the floor if that's what it takes to remove it!

I must admit that it's a shame to see how poorly these men and women have progressed in their Charms studies. I had a whole stack of parchments and tomes cloaked with half a dozen invisibility spells right under their noses, and they did not even notice them. They were awfully close a few times, but fortunately they walked right by them.

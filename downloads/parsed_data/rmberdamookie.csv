We performed an autopsy on a
woman who had shot herself in the
face,
The blood trickled down from her ears,
eyes, nose, and mouth,
and the aroma of decayed sulfur
permeated the membranes of my
nose.
Upon the internal examination the
Cheif Medical Examiner excised teh 
gall bladder and found that it was
crammed with stones.
She turned to me and said,

""Well no wonder she was so 
grumpy!""

Why are there no funny poems about
cancer!
I mean it,
Why are there no funny poems about
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cancer?
I'm going to assume that out of the
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10,326,000 people diagnosed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with cancer every year, SOME
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of them MUST have a sense of
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; humor!
I know!

How many cancer victims does ti take to change a light bulb?

NONE they're all too weak to climb the ladder!

...
No?
..
No?
Not at all?

"event","It's been almost a year since my father died, so I thought I'd start a bit of journaling in order to maintain a sense of sanity during this month of May as we approach the anniversary of not only the day of his death but also the day of his birth. 

But what I truly care to write about are certain ideas and phenomenas I have taken private note of when encountering them. The ideas of existentialism vs. absurdism, the art of lies, an idea of man being inherently self centered as opposed to Golding's theory of inherent evil, and generally the basic fact that the most useless question we always ask is ""why?""

We amuse ourselves via situations that will never be solved. We are foolish to assume there is a possibility of exterminating a problem, but at least we-at times-recognized that the only way to end a conflict is to destroy it in its entirety. Yet, this option seems to play a significant amount from the teleological suspension of ethics, therefore attempting to rid ""wrong"" with ""wrong."" The idea plays off this metaphor..
You are waiting behind many vehicles for a stop light to turn green. At the time that light actually changes green every human could, at the same time, begin to move forward, yet instead we choose to wait for the person in front of us to start moving first. Not only is there a lack of trust within society, but there is also a lack of effort. If we want to have the entire earth cleaned up, every individual must partake in the attempt. Yes, we will ultimately arrive at our destination, but if not every person moves together then we will be significantly delayed. And that delay will only cause us to arrive at our goal when it is too late. I know there are kinks to the metaphor and thoughts, but it's based off the idea that man is ultimately flawed. 

While waiting to buy a ticket to the movie, someone a few yards from you collapses to the ground. What do you do?
...
Now, would you actually do that? The Bystander Effect generally states that someone is less likely to intervene in an emergency situation when other people are present and able to help than when he or she is alone (wikipedia 5/3/08).
(I know wiki is not a credible source, but I needed a well worded definition and I confirm that this definition is accurate from my studies.)
Why does the bystander effect occur? Is it fear? Is it confusion? Or is it because we are waiting for someone else to jump in and take action. The truth is, we are all more similar that we think. Every person in that scenario will most likely be thinking the same thing, waiting for others to jump in and take control. 

A few weeks ago I was sitting in class when suddenly a girl sitting next to me began to convulse. The first thought in my head was one to always remember: this situation will summon the bystander effect and no one will do anything to help, so I took control of the situation and attempted to extinguish it. 

Let's take action. Let's possess the initiative. Let us allow that person to get into our lane, be sure to always jump up and help when the wait for someone else to volunteer comes to your mind. And while assuming can make an ass of you and me it can also denounce the idea of man being inherently self-centered, especially when you assume that everyone you encounter could be secretly having the worst day of their life.

I love you all,
~ANdy

P.S. If you have any thoughts to this idea, please contribute. I would love discussion to further develop such theories before I present them to one of my future professors."

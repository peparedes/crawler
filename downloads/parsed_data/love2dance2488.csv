"event","They got the murderer!..YAY!...no more damn questions about that creepy guy that was sittin in my yard at 10pm bothering me..hes now bein charged for murder of 16 yr. old girl across the street. He's been living here for 8 months and he slits the throat of the girl across the street. And im allowed to go home w/out bein in ""danger"" . YAY! Him and his friend robbed their house and he wanted to go back to grab something else the next day and she was home w/out him knowing. I feel so bad for the family and we put flowers and talked to the mother, shes so upset..my mom started to cry.  and the ppl in charge of the investgation were nice and bothered me w/ questions about what he said to me but i didnt mind. they were getting their point across w/out scarying me..""we recommend that u stay somewhere else for the next few days b/cz we're currently holding him but we cannot hold him for a long period of time w/out pressing offical charges and we cant press charges until we're sure..but there is no doubt in my mind..he did it.""...and i was so happy when he called and said ""we have held him for the max. amount of time and must release him but new info has come in and we got him. His friends(2) are goin down for burglery charges and hes goin down for murder and burg. We found the weapon and all the evidence we need against him. We sry to inconvince u in anyway and we're happy that no one else was hurt. Just keep an eye out for anybody around the neighborhood, anyone u dont reconize and call if anything happens, even if minor. But thank -you for u coroporation and we'll call u if we need any more info from you.""....im so happy that its over for the most part. the camera crews are gone..a few come every now and then but its not as much and the yellow tape everywhere is gone.

 so if a 21yr old guy sits in ur yard at night and starts talkin to u when u pull up in the garage and says hes ur new neighbor and becomes very curious in u and offers u drinks...stay away..like me,  b/cz as the officer said u can never really kno / trust someone even ur neighbors...ppl can surprise u.  .........and i think that family will be moving out soon....that must be hard to look at the neighborhood, that house, and the family knowing ur son / brother killed that girl and ruined their lives over an item he wanted to steal. u kinda have to feel bad for the family...espically the parents..b/cz they now know, they have failed at the most important thing in their lives, raising their son...............*liz*"

Well, I didn't really want to write about shit like this in livejournal but owell I'm going to anyways.
I really like someone so much right now. I keep falling harder for her as each day passes. I can't stop thinking about her no matter what I'm doing. Everything about this girl is amazing. She makes me so happy just sitting there and talking to her, like I don't have a care in the world. I've never felt this way about anyone before and I don't know what to do about it. I want more then anything in the world to be with her. I'm so afraid because I really don't know what to do or say.

Today I woke up at 11 got ready and shit then left to Zack's house at like 11:30.
I got there and we waited for everyone to get there. When everyone got there we were off to Dearborn.
On the way there Chris ran over a tac and got a flat tire. So we skated for a bit and then went to the bike shop and Chris got a free tube. After Chris got his tire on we went to starbucks and then we went to some pizza place and me mike and mike (yes there were 3 Mikes) split a pizza. After then we went to some High school and then I fucking got a flat tire. So we rode around some more and then went to aco to buy a new tube for my tire. So we bought the tube and asked if I could use a tool really fast but they said no we had to buy it. We talked them into it though and they let us. After switching my tube and putting air in it we went to skate some more. We skated until like 8 then left to come home. On the way home we stopped at some Ford building and then Mike R got a flat tire! Dearborn is bad news I tell you. So I got home at like 10 after stopping to skate some more and getting food at 7 11 (THANKS MIKE!) 
Yeah now I'm home and sore as fuck.

After bass i came home and just sat around and then at around 5 Zack and I decided to go to ESP. Zack and I both skated good! Zack learned front boards on the rail and i tried back smiths but i fell on my head and ate shit.

Saturday: I woke up and at around 11:30 I get a call from my dad at work who randomly asks me if i need new bearings, so i told him yes. He took me to cheapskates and bought me new bearings with income tax money, then we went out to lunch at taylor town. At like 3:30 xJULIEx came over and we watched Coyboy Bebop, which is a fucking kick ass movie! Then we played mortal kombat....and i got my ass handed to me yet again. At around 6:30 Julie left so i basically sat online and then brian (DIPSHIT) asked me if i wanted to go to TRP because i hadn't been there in like a month. So we went at around 8, and i had a lot of fun on their new downbox. At 11 i came home and here i am now....bored as fuck.

Today I went to school and took the last of the midterms, it was a relief when i finally finished them. After school i just chilled for the whole day until around 5, at that time i went to ESP and I skated fairly well. At 11 Dakota drove me home because he is such a kind fellow.

Yes I know I have no life what so ever. At around 5 Jake called and asked if I wanted to go to the mall with him and Nick P. So we went to the mall and walked around for a while. Nick P. starts like moshin in the hallway and when he's done he flips his hair and some random mexican guy goes up to him and he's like ""smoke weed?"" The guy probably packin his bookbag with reefer. After that we went to the music store and Nick played this jackson. Nick P fuckin rips at guitar. After that I came home.

"event","Well today was the first day back to school which was.....GAY. After school I had to fucking walk home in the rain. When i got home I went online and Jake mother fucking Rencsok called. We went to Harry's army surplus, The Grind, The mall, and then met Luke and Casey up at Energie. We stayed at energy for like an hour and a half or so. Then Jake dropped me off. When I got home I took a shower. Now I'm sitting here listening to some music and being bored..the ususal.

Now I'm sitting here listening to music and being bored. I think in a bit I'm going to go watch Garden State again and then probably go to sleep."

"event","Not within arms length
Id sever the stars from the sky
and place them in your hands
if i thought another wish / they'd see the light of day
but you stand beyond the sun
Beyond the reach of just a friend
maybe if i grew wings / maybe if you lost yours
these words would flow like water
if you'd let them scrape your heart
Not with in arms length
embedded within my concise effort
a silent cry / I receive no comfort
and as I collapse we remain nothing more than friends
As I hold my breath / a throat full of cement
I'm disgusted by repetition I accept this curse
of friendship / your friend / friendship

So today i went to ESP for the 3rd day in a row. A lot of my friends were there. I'm happy I skated good today. Tomorrow Chris and I are going to the mall. You all should go and have a good time with us."

"event","So today I went to ESP. I met Shaughn and Dakota up there. Skating was good for the most part. There was a fight between like these 2 8 year olds. It was fucking hilarious. This one biker was taking pictures of it on his cell phone. My friend Mark found fucking 50 dollars, which means he's getting a new deck, that bastard. What was even funnier was how we almost got kicked out of burger king. Dakota was being so funny he started laughing so loud out of no where and the lady that was wiping tables was like ""Are you OK do you need me to call an ambulance?"" After that whole incident Dakota was pretending to do a crossword puzzle and he said ""I need a six letter word for the guy at the counter. It rhymes with baggot."" When we were driving away the lady wiping tables was yelling at us in the building. It looked like she was saying Assholes or fuck you or something. Now i'm sitting here listening to music and being bored."

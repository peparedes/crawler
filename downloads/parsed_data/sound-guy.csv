"event","Unbelievable.  I've heard some of the most racist things on television in the last few hours; and it's sickening.  We're supposed to be a nation of progress, but instead the media is staying vigilant, and <b>constantly</b> reminding us that Mr. Obama is different because he's black.  I can understand how it's historical, but I just about lost my mind when I heard someone on NBC talking about ""people of color"" like it was nothing.

Barack Obama is a <i>man</i>, who is an <i>American</i>, who is president-elect of the United States.  The media talks about him as if Americans weren't ready for him to be president because of his race... as if he wasn't just elected by popular vote.  We're moving on, media.  You need to, too."

"event","No spin... just direct quotes.  This is how reporting should be.  I hate watching a debate, for example, and then seeing two hours of spun up commentary (on both sides) telling me what I just heard.  Anyway, below is a link that lays out issues for the 2008 election, and then finds direct quotes from each of the candidates, if found, on each subject.  If a candidate has quotes on both sides because he or she reversed their opinion, that's there too, with dates.  I'm not sure how well researched the voting records are yet, but it also includes how candidates have voted in the past on the issue as well, in some cases.  It has all of the candidates (including libertarian and green parties, etc.) and lots of issues.  Check it out for yourselves:  <a href=""http://2008election.procon.org/"">http://2008election.procon.org/</a>  I want to see if I can donate to them or something."

"event","The following movies were under review (because I saw all of them today.  Yes, <i>all of them</i> and yes, <i>today</i>.  It was fun.  So here we go in the order I saw them:

<b>In the Name of the King</b>: Fantasy genre. It's apparently based on Dungeon Siege. I'm not familiar with it, but the movie did it little justice.  Despite a cast including Burt Reynolds, Ray Liotta, and Jason Stratham, the movie was not at all engaging.  I felt no bond with the characters, nor with their world, due to a serious lack of character development.  While the movie trudged on, I was never really engaged until the large battle at the end when the plot finally picked up to a reasonable pace.  Many of the characters were either over-acted or non-believable, and when main characters died, I felt no sorrow for them.  The ending is the only thing that saves this movie from being a complete failure.  Despite being interested in the role-playing aspects of the movie, I still found it to be disappointing.  The soundtrack sounded like it was written by a student in music school, who really didn't understand how to compose, but still passed the classes.  Much of the music was too ""predictable"", if that makes sense.  Campy when happy, monotonous or strange when dangerous or sad.  <b>Grade: C-</b>

<b>Juno</b>: Comedy/Drama.  A good story about how dynamic people can be, this movie takes you deep enough into a teenage pregnancy to be interested, but used enough comedy to keep it light.  It's not on par with a Knocked Up or Super Bad, but the young pregnant female with us really seemed to enjoy the movie.  It killed time, but it's certainly one that could wait for the rental, even if you are into teenage pregnancy movies.  The music appears to be completely original and despite being really awkward occasionally, it makes the movie stand out a little more than it might have otherwise.  <b>Grade: B-</b>

<b>The Bucket List</b>: Comedy/Drama.  Two excellent actors take this movie as far as it could probably go, and it goes the distance.  The story about how precious life's moments are, and how to deal with death when you are closer to it, is well-portrayed.  At no point did I feel disengaged from the screen.  I was concerned when I saw a mostly older crowd in the theater, but the movie's lessons are definitely universal.  Moments at the end of the movie even brought tears to the eyes of all three guys in our group.  The ""theater experience"" isn't a must for this movie, but it's definitely a great movie for a mixed-generation gathering.  <b>Grade: A</b>

<b>Cloverfield</b>: Thriller. I now know why the previews were so vague and non-descriptive.  So much production value in this film was entirely wasted.  Amazing visual effects can't make up for a plot that lacks the fundamentals of conflict and resolution.  Even on opening night, the entire audience booed at the conclusion of the movie, something that I have honestly never heard before.  I don't expect this movie to last long at all once word gets out.  <b>Grade: F</b>

Bonus: Saw this movie last week....
<b>Charlie Wilson's War</b>: Drama/True Story. Although the true story was changed to make the movie more interesting, the point and purpose remained the same.  Comedy is used extensively, and well, to keep the movie entertaining throughout.  If anyone is interested in either politics or covert operations, past or present, this is a great movie to see as it links the past with our current situation.  In my opinion, this is a must see for younger Americans who don't know much about the Russian invasion of Afghanistan.  <b>Grade: A-</b>"

"event","I thought of a weird physics question while in the shower today:

The water coming out of the shower head is being forced out at about (for sake of simplicity) a 90 degree angle, and 20 feet per second.  Given no limit on how far it can fall (and no wind), it will eventually stop traveling forward and only be falling downward.  Why?  Does the friction of the air stop its forward velocity so that gravity is the only remaining force?  Is it because gravity continually acts on it to bring it to only a downward trajectory?  Maybe it's both, but I was curious because I didn't know."

Historically, nearly half the class will fail, but I've been rocking this shiznit from Day 1.  I'm debating on whether or not I'll be coming home in September, like I originally thought, or coming home in August.  I might not take that extra class.  Anyway, I wish I had a way to get pictures out there, but it's hard to do when you have to use public computers all the time.  I'll see if I can find someone with a computer in his room.  I hope everything is going well for you guys, too.

Ugh... just checked my e-mail.  Who knew that someone could be so lame as to send a Dear John email.  I should have known better... but I can say that for a lot of things.  Oh well.

You get to thinking about weird things out here.  It comes with the job... knowing how quickly things can go bad.  I think quite a bit about what I'm doing with my life, and realize that there are some things that are more important than yourself.  It's hard to explain, and would seem weird coming from me, but it's the whole family idea; not that I'm even at step 1 in that department right now, apparently.  I'll be 25 next week, too.  It's kind of random... just things... that I think about.

"event","It's raining today... which is weird.  I thought there was a season for that here and I didn't think we were in it.  I figured that I would share my misconceptions about the southwest today.  Most of them I noticed while we drove from Ft Leonard Wood to Ft Huachuca.  (Yes <i>drove</i>. It was a 30 hour bus ride.)
<lj-cut text=""Let the misconceptions begin."">
#1: New Mexico: There was snow all over the place in New Mexico.  I guess it has to do with the elevation, but the roads and everything were covered in about 4 inches.  Oddly, the hills are so steep in the area we drove through, that the roads are all in cuts and fills through them.  There was a bridge at one point, just to cross the bottom of a hill, because the next one rose so steeply afterward.

#2. Arizona: Besides the rain today, I've seen a lot more foliage than I expected for a desert; and especially more foliage than I expected at our elevation of nearly a mile.  There is sparse grass and tress all over.  Also, oddly... the mountains spring up out of nowhere.  It will be as I say, ""Flat, flat, flat, flat, flat.... MOUNTAIN!""  It's kind of strange if you are used to the idea of foothills and such.</lj-cut>

I have weekends off for the most part, which is weird for me coming out of basic.  And on Sunday mornings I even choose when I wake up.  It's amazing what you appreciate when you don't have it for a while.  It makes me think everyone should go through basic.  My perspective is certainly different now, and I wouldn't have been such a procrastinator.  The low blood pressure still drives on, however.  :)"

"event","I've done quite a bit since my last letter.  I passed my PT test at Army standards (harder than basic training requirements.)  I got 60 on my pushups by doing 40, 69 on by situps by doing 53, and 81 (of 100) on my run by running a 2 mile in 14:35.  By the time I go through AIT I expect to be even better, and I've already met the standard of 60 pts per event.
We had our free day away on Sunday. We had a few hours off base to go bowling, play sports eat (and eat ANYTHING), and so much more, all without drill sergeants.  I sent home pictures from it.  The only requirements were staying in uniform outside and attending a church service.  The service was southern Baptist and the phrase ""Holy Hell!""  defines it perfectly.  The Catholics use the reaching God through guilt routine, but this was overly dramatic, too.  Anyway ... during the service we're told of a girl who didn't care about, ""being saved"" and died on the way home in a car crash yelling. ""I don't want to go to hell!""  The idea was to ask for salvation before it was too late.  Well, on the way back to the base, the bus had brake problems.  They press on and the right wheel on our bus caught fire!  We are all fine, but it was quite a moment to actually use the rear emergency exit.
Other fun stuff has been the night infiltration course.  We crawled over 150 meters, while .50 cal and rifles were fired over us.  We navigated under razor wire and mortar simulators exploded around us.  We've been working on our movement through woods for our upcoming FINAL FTX!  It starts Saturday and we march back the 15 kilometers on Wednesday to or Rights of Passage ceremony.  That pretty much concludes training as we spend the final week cleaning and getting organized for graduation.  Then it's on to AIT!."

"event","Hello,

BOOM!  I threw a live hand grenade the other day in
grenade training...pretty cool.  I qualified ""first
class"" with grenades which is one level below expert. 
My dislike of baseball caught up with me since I
missed one of seven targets.  First class goes along
well enough with the sharpshooter badge though.  It
all gets put together on the dress uniform in just two
and half weeks.  And that reminds me, if you want to
send me something, you only have two weeks before I
won't get it.  I won't have my new address in Arizona
until I get there.
So we are in blue phase as of today (3 of 3).  The
drill sergeants are really leaving us to do what we
need to do on our own, now.  It's amazing to watch
other compaies marching by that are still in red phase
and see how far we've come since then in just over a
month.  Tomorrow morning (after 3:45 wakeup) we have
our final PT test.  I'm hoping to score 220 of 300 on
it.  150 is minimum score to graduate.  Of course as
soon as I get to AIT, 180 is Army minimum.  Airborne
isn't easier, but I have 19 weeks of AIT before then.

Let's see... I've also fired a grenade launcher, fully
automatic rifle, and a rocket launcher recently.  I
feel like I'm living ""Goldeneye"" sometimes.  Man, I
miss some of those civilian priveleges.  I get some
back in AIT, and then most at my first duty station,
which given my airborne training will be Fort Bragg in
North Carolina (90% likely).  I've practiced raiding
and clearing buildings in an urban setting, too.  That
was scary, scary stuff.  All of the variables in urban
combat make it extremely dangerous, and I have a new
respect for the front-line infantrymen and Marines
doing that in Iraq right now.  Well, it's back to
business as usual here.  Play a video game an extra
hour for me. :)"

"event","Well it's getting a little more relaxed now.  We got two hours of personal time tonight, as long as nobody does anything stupid and we get sent outside to do PT (which has happened).  Yesterday we got fitted for our class A dress uniforms.  It was awesome to see myself in the mirror with that on...indescribable really.  Graduation seems so close now.  I am about to graduate from the basic training for the greatest military in the world, and be granted the privelage of wearing its uniform.  There's still much more to go though.  AIT is 19 weeks, but after that I can wear a suit and carry a concealed 9mm.  Then, airborne for 3 weeks, after which I get a red beret instead of the standard Army black, and can wear my jump boots with the Class A uniform.So each step has its reward in how you can proudly display your successes.  I already have my badge for sharpshooter, rfle marksmanship.  Hopefully, I can earn an advanced badge for grenades which is coming up this week.  Today we did hand to hand combat.  It was more fun than I expected but when we started competing I was paired up with a former high school wrestler who knew much more about leverage and positioning then I could learn from the two hour class.  Oh well, it wasn't graded for performance, unlike our final PT test coming up on the 4th.
I wish I had something else to write about that wasn't Army.  Something huge, something mega, something kajunga.  But alas, my new job is also a new lifestyle.  We have to work, eat and sleep Army.  There are probably some awesome new games out now, new movies and all kinds of stuff.  I should start getting weekend passes to go off base in about two months.  It feels like forever, but it will go by quickly.  Then I can finally get out and do stuff on my own.  I hope you are all enjoying your ""personal time"" and freedoms right now."

"event","So we finished up with our second FTX which consisted mostly of movement in formations (line, wedge, etc) through the woods, finding cover or concealment, and land navigation.  The land nav was awesome.  Getting around with a compass and map and finding points over 500m away on the ground was cool as hell for me.  It reminded me of flashlight tag and manhunt on Northwood Drive.  We did a nightime land nav, too.  Our platoon is not allowed to use flashlights of any kind in the field, nor speak over a whisper.  When learning how to maneuver in formations, we also learned hand signals.  It was great to put it all together in the night land nav.  Our drill sergeant is an infantry sniper, and taught us a whole lot more than the other platoons' drill sergeants taught them.  Also Iwas picked as Alpha team leader and point man for out squad, so putting it all to use in the final FTX should be incredible.  I should get used to sneaking around.:)  We got to play a small war gaime while out there, too - capture the flag!!  CTF w/kevlar and M16s ... awesome.

In other news, my language score is in fact as great as I think it is, according to the drill sergeant.  I'll find out at AIT about the schooling, but with my score I could be considered for a linguis.  Who knew?  There are new options cropping up all the time and new ones coming (Ranger).  I have a lot to consider.  Because I'm going Airborne there's a 90% chance I'll be stationed at Ft Bragg in North Carolina.  I don't know where language school fits in, but I'll keep in touch.  You guys are half the reason I want to be here.  Someone needs to do it."

But yesterday we went over military movements like the high crawl, low crawl and the short run.  It had starated raining and there was mud all over the course.  In teams we had to cover our battle buddy as they moved (through the mud).  I thought it was going to be cold and miserable, but it was a lot of fun.  When was the last time you were told to go play in the mud?  We had to spend two hours cleaning rifles afterward which really sucked it you didn't keep it out of the mud like your were supposed to.  Hand to hand combat is coming up after the next FTX.  I'm not sure if I'll be into that, but I'll certainly pay attention.  We'll be in the field Tuesday through Friday, so I won;t be able to write again until next weekend.  Graduation doesn't seem so far away anymore.  I hope everyone is doint well, eating slow and enjoying all of their free time.  :)

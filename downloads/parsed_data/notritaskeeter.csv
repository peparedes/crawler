"event","I decided to take the job <s>more time in the office is a good thing by me right now</s>. Yours truly is now the Editor of the Muggle News section of the Daily Prophet, and is now a sub-editor on the International Magical Community section as well. I even get to hire my own assistant, for a change, so let me know if you know of anyone looking for a job, won't you?

I think a <s>piss-up</s> celebration is in order."

"event","So, it's new journal time again. What a couple of years it's been. I swear, the people I knew at Hogwarts who are working at The Prophet look completely different. Hardly recognised any of them when they started.

The editor of the Muggle news section is retiring soon, and she asked me if I'd consider applying for the job (I'm already sub-editing, because it's only a fairly small department, but still substantial enough to require another sub-editor as well as myself). I don't know if I will, though - things are rather chaotic at the moment <s>in my personal life, I mean, I don't know if I could handle the increased responsibility as well as dealing with the news that Julius has this secret child</s> so I'll have to see if balancing everything is do-able. It'd be interesting, though. And one in the eye for Megara Eris, the other sub. Remember her sister, Tonteria? She finally got fired from The Prophet last year, after all that nonsense she wrote about Professor McGonagall. The entire family's still pissed off with anyone who took McGonagall's part.

Hope everyone's well."

"event","Well, I've mastered the art of freaking out when it is totally unnecessary.  I am a complete nervous wreck and I may be hallucinating.  The 30 minute commute nearly kills me every day.  My brain is so tired from worrying about every little thing that could possibly go wrong.  As you can tell, I've gotten to work today as safely as ever.  I don't like my job much, but when have i ever?  I wish I were at home right now.  My sister is going upstate with her  boyfriend's family this weekend and I'm kinda bummed.  She's going to probably start a job next weekend and she'll work only on weekends (til 12)for the rest of the summer.  Which sucks cause I have weekends off.  But I think she really wants this job so I'm happy for her :)  Anyway, my boy has been working hard as an electrician  and i'm really proud of him!  I don't think he loves it but I think he might like it.  He's always liked fixing things, well, he put together every piece of furniture in my room and re-did my outlets so I hope he likes it.  Other than that... things have been strange around here, I feel like my life is surreal and i'm part of a dream.  I can't be sure of anything that's happening but everything keeps going.  It's amazing how many people I've known in my life and how many I know now.  I miss those people I used to know but I'm also excited about meeting new ones.  I guess everything gets balanced out somehow.  I've become very fond of diet sodas with no calories and loaded up with aspertame.  I've been told it's very bad for you but I'm hooked.  My new obsession: diet pepsi jazz; which I am drinking right now.  I have read 3 and a half books so far and I'd like to think that I'm getting smarter but I will say that I don't hate reading anymore and I'm starting to like it.  As of now, I've started on Harry POtter and the order of pheonix... I've never read any Harry Potter books before but Lauren insisted I have.  I'm glad I took her advice, it's wonderful.  So, I'll get back to my reading and hopefully I'll be writing again soon."

i am so pissed off at my life right now.
i hate people.
i hate them so much.
and i'm sorry if i'm being rude.
but the amount of scummy horrible people out there out-weigh the good ones.
everyone's so quick to judge.
i don't think that one person can take me seriously.

"event","i have a job now
i've had it for about three weeks
i work in an office about twenty minutes away
i answer phones, take notes, and do some paper work
it's simple
yet boring
and i'm not miserable
well, at least not yet
it's so weird
there was an accident on my way to work yesterday
the car behind me was rear-ended
so i ran out in the rain
i got completely soaked
and handed the guy my name and phone number
so he could use me as a witness
he didn't seem so pleased and 
did not take the time out to thank me
but
of course his insurance company has called me a few times
and now i understand why people don't bother 
to go out of their way to leave their name and number
it's no big deal for me
but i don't usually like to be involved in other people's business
ever
but i'm hoping my information helped someone out
cause if someone would have done something so simple like
give me their name and number after my accident
maybe i would not have to pay some woman money 
who is so undeserving 
and dishonest
but maybe that experience will somehow make me a better person
money is just money
and it's not something i really care about
it's just the principle
the injustice
i was taken advantage of 
just because
i'm young
or at least younger than her
and i'm insecure
and i'm overall a decent person
it seems the more good i do
or the more good i think i do
i'm not getting anything out of it
not that that's all i want
because it's not
but 
i was told that everything comes full circle
and that's just not what i'm seeing
the liars get to the top
and i'm stuck underneath everyone's feet
keep walking all over me
cause nothing's going to change
i'm still me  
and that's how it's going to be"

"event","tonight, kevin and i went on a ""double date.""
we went with phil and danielle.
they're cool but we've never hung out alone before.
just the four of us.
anyway,
we saw alpha dog.. the one with justin timberlake.
surprisingly, it wasnt all that bad, it was pretty sad though.
i don't like the movie theatre though.
there's so many people and most of them you know 
but you wouldn't even think of wasting your time to say hello to them.
there were a couple of surprises along the way.
i couldn't stop looking back.
i couldn't help but to think about what happened
or what could have happened.
i still don't know to this day 
and i'm not sure if i'd want to know.
but i need some closure.
closure is always a good thing, well..in my experiences. 
suddenly, i have this overwhelming feeling of hopelessness...
kinda how it used to be a while back.
it all started when i decided i did not want to decide.
i didn't want to decide anything.
i would play my life out like a movie.
i thought, if i don't make things happen,
things will happen for me.
life will just map itself out in front of me.
and i could be right.
but i still feel as clueless and empty as when i first started.
i figured that some bad things happen to me 
so, that must mean that good things will start to happen.
and i waited.
and i waited.
and i'm still waiting.
don't get me wrong, good things have happened to me since.
but with such low expectations...
my mind began to wander,
i began to crave more and more.
i wanted something major.
something far too great to put a price on
or fit inside a fancy box.
i want it all."

another year...
another year at nassau
and working at another job i hate
another year with kevin
i have almost known kevin for three years now
i can't wait til our three year anniversary
i'm talking to him online right now
and we're talking about when we first met
he was adorable
and he still is to this day
his gorgeous blue eyes
long blonde hair
handsome face
little skater boy
wearing his ramones shirt
i remember being shy around him
i remember seeing him in my guitar class three years ago 
and i was afraid to sit near him 
i didn't know if he'd want me to talk to him or not
i remember when he used to like kaylie
and i didn't want to tell anyone that i had a crush on him
it's amazing how things turned out
i remember the night he asked me out
i remember not knowing how to approach him the day after he asked me
i remember our first kiss
it's been a little over two years 
and i couldn't be happier
i love kevin so much
i'm in love with him
i'm looking foward to another year with him
i can't believe i was born nearly twenty years ago
i can't believe i've lived here for exactly ten years of my life
i'm so lucky to have such great friends and the coolest family
spending time with lauren makes me happy, we have so much fun
it also makes me miss the old days with kaylie
i miss kaylie :(
i saw her for christmas this year though
it was great
i had an awesome christmas
the presents were fantastic
i got everything i wanted
i spent quality time with the people that mean the most to me
over the christmas week
i worked my ass off
went to the nightmare of you show with cristina
baked cookies 
wrapped gifts
excellent
to wrap it up 2006 was pretty good and
i have a feeling that this year's going to be even better"

anyway, after shopping, we went to my mom's job she did some work and talked to her boss who, by the way, was a noticeably large unibrow.  then we went home and i put my bed together and cleaned my room.  kevin :) came over.  i don't know why but he made me really happy today.  i mean, he always makes me happy but for some reason, i missed him a lot through out the day.  anyway, he made me laugh a lot and we spent some quality time together.  i love him so much.  
last weekend, i finally got to hang out with cristina.  we went to the diner and caught up on things, went to see hostel which was one of the most messed up movies i have ever seen...gross!!  and went walking around the mall.  so we got locked in the broadway mall and broke cristina's rear view mirror.  we tried to stick it on with gum but it was just too heavy.  i used it as a microphone to sing some brand new.  i've accepted the fact that i like brand new, i won't deny it.  they're good.  now, cristina is going to italy in a few days and i'm going to call her so we can hang out again before she leaves.  i had a lot of fun with her saturday night.  we exchanged christmas presents and she seemed to like what i got her, i love what she got me.
i still haven't seen kaylie for christmas.  i have her gift and everything.  i wish i could have had christmas with her and her family.  i always love seeing them and i feel like i don't have to go out of my way to impress them or anything.  they're all the best.  i love the grempel family!  i also haven't seen suzette, i need to give her presents too.  i really miss her too.  i have to call her soon.
so, i got my grades from school today.  i don't want to sound conceited or anything but i think i did rather well for someone who was working 35+ hours a week and did not study or anything pretty much at all.  i got two A's, two B+'s, and a C in math.  Booo math, i really hate math.
my next semester starts the 23rd.  i'm not really looking foward to it.  i have no friends and i don't like going there by myself.  there's too many gangs and girls getting raped and i get lonely.  i talk to myself and sing really loud in the car.  it's unfortunate.
i can't think of anything else to say besides my throat is killing me and i feel so bad for kevin 'cause i got him sick too.  i'm sorry, kevin :(  and i also feel bad for my dad because some freeport punk stole his stereo from his car. those!#%^*&* people!! and i'm going to stop writing because i'm getting tired and i know kevin wants to read this so goodnight.  feel better.  i love you, kitchen towel!"

"event","so, christmas came and went.  i can't believe it's over.  cause for me, there was no anticipation... i just worked my ass of until before i knew it, it was christmas eve.  these past couple of days haven't been so pleasant but i'll get over it.  i'm so sick of being angry.  i have reason to be.  but i just can't do it anymore.  it's complicated, yet plain and simple.  oh, forget it.  
so today i have off from work and i'm going to take lauren and maybe kevin and matt to the mall.  our grandma gave us $200 and we wanna go hxc shopping.  whatever.  we did get a whole bunch of shit though.  our mom went crazy.  she's awesome, i love her so much.  not because she got us stuff but because she's crazy and the coolest mom ever!  i bought her a toy parot that repeats everything you say and i truly believe that if she could, she would play with it 24/7.
anyway, cristina is home and i have yet to see her, besides her coming into my work-job to say hi.  that was definatley the best visit ever.  she just styaed and talked to me as i tried to mulit-task.  work, talk, listen at the same time.  we have to hang out.  i have a christmas present for her just sitting on my steps.
well, matt was sick yesterday.  and i don't feel so good today.  i hope i didn't catch what he had.  he was miserable.  i felt so bad.  i was up all night.  watching the grinch.  i wish i could have slept.  i am so tired.  i'm going to go now and maybe if i feel better i can hang out with kevin and watch the grinch!!!   i love that movie.  and the bestest boyfriend in the world bought it for me :)"

"event","today i was just thinking about how my life used to be before i started college and working in retail.  i was thinking about how i miss the summer and not having to go to work or school.  i did whatever i wanted, woke up at like nine and went for walks every morning and jumped in the pool in my underwear everyday.  i would hang out outside usually by myself or sometimes with lauren and wait until kevin got off from work.  i miss getting lost everytime kevin asked for a ride home from work and kicking our shoes and running through puddles.  i miss last year, being in the same school as kevin, lauren, julie, matt and cristina.  i even miss eleventh grade.  i would hang out with cristina everyday and watch t.v. on her couch or play the sims or hang out with a bunch of people that she knew, who she introduced me to.  we would have sleepovers like every weekend, eat a lot of popcorn and drink all the pepsi and talk about boys and girlie stuff like that.  i miss being beavis and butthead.  i miss walking around the lake at forrest city and going to saw mill.  i miss kaylie, i wish we still lived with each other or closer than we do now.  we used to have so much fun on the swings and in her room.  we used to play barbies and talk on walkie talkies late at night when we were supposed to be sleeping.  i miss going to busy bee with grandma on saturday mornings and the garage sales she ""just had"" to go to.  i really wish i saw shannon more often too.  i feel like i haven't seen her enough.  we used to see her so much and she loved being with me and lauren and now it just feels like we're too old to be going to her house to play with her and sleep over.  i miss suzette.  i miss our guitar lessons and how she would always help me with whatever i was going through or thought i was having a hard time.  i realize now that all the supposed drama of my life was all false.  it was never worth dwelling over and i am a lot luckier than some people.  i love my family and my friends.  and i am really lucky to have a boyfriend like kevin, i love him very much.  but as strange as this may sound, meeting people like suzette and kevin changed me so much.  they taught me that i shouldn't care about what other people think of me and not to be afraid to be myself in front of anyone.  and i am very thankful for them.  speaking of thankful, thanksgiving is coming up pretty soon.  cristina will come back home for a while, i was thinking i should get over to new paltz and visit but i don't know if it is possible yet.  i love thanksgiving.  i really love turkey and stuffing, potatoes, yams, and cranberry.  haha.  i'm a fat ass.  i only have ten more pounds to go to get to the ""freshmen fifteen.""  but yeah, that's my life as of now.  i go to school, go to work and hang out with my most favorite person in the world, kevin pat pow.  and i try to spend time with lauren too.  we go shopping and stuff.  i have to think of other stuff to do cause now i'm turning into an old lady, all i do in my free time is eat, sleep and shop.  work is all right.  sometimes i hate it sooo much and others, i really enjoy it.  some of the people i work with are really cool and i talk to them a lot and try to make work as fun as possible and others, like the black janitor just try and make me feel like shit no matter what i do.  the customers haven't been so nasty lately, i've been trying to be nicer and actually listen to whatever it is that they are saying instead of just looking at them like they have 5 heads.  well, there's a lot that needs improving, but i am trying hard and i hope it all pays off.  but it is true, i am working too much.  they expect me to work thirty four hours a week and be able to go to school and write all of these college papers and do all of my work.  it is physically impossible.  i don't even have one day off this week coming up.  it's ridiculous.  i have to work the weekend ten to six.  i go to school monday thru friday like eight to twelve or one and i have off from work and thursday and friday.  there is not one day when i can wake up late or not have to worry about doing something.  i'm getting fed up but at the same time i'm trying to keep myself happy.  life is not worth living if you're going to miserable all the time.  and for the most part i have people surrounding me that make it worth while.  atleast i'm making some money.  everyone needs money.  they say money can't buy happiness and i don't think i'd agree.  if you have money, you don't need to work which means you can do whatever you want and when you get what you want... aren't you happy?  i wish i was rich.  don't get me wrong, i don't completely hate working but it would be nice if i didn't have to.  a lot of people  feel the same, we're all lazy.  i still don't know what i am going to school for, and if i don't do good enough... i am not going to go back next semester.  i know if you go to college, you make more money but i just don't know if i am capable of  finishing with a high enough degree.  six years of college to become a teacher, i think i'd kill myself.  but as of now, i guess i'm all right.  i keep telling myself i'll figure something out but i don't really know if that's just wishful thinking or reality.  we'll i am going to stop writing and get up from sitting here because i have today off and after this, my next day off is like a week from now...

"event","all right, so my life is reduced to going to school, going to work, going home and hanging out with kevin.  it's not a bad thing but i just feel bombarded with shit.  i really should be doing work or something now but i just don't feel up to it.  three days ago was mine and kevin's one year anniversary.  one year, and a lot has changed.  i can't believe it, i never thought i was even capable of being with anyone that long.  but i am really happy and i hope everything between us stays the same as this year and last year.  i love him so much!!  he makes me so happy.  well, anyway... we gave eachother a bunch of stuff, of course after   work, and he got me the coolest stuff that i love so much.  he is really the most fun and interesting person. 
     so... work is pretty straight- foward.  if i was uncapable of ringing up stuff, then there would be something seriously wrong with me.  i'm not going to complain though.  the people there are pretty nice, everyone has been so helpful.  i got hit on by some black guy and some spanish woman.  yeah, they made me want to kill myself but it's cool i guess.  it's something that makes work a little more um, interesting.  so come visit me, starting next week... i'm there monday through friday like 12 to 6 or something.  i am a cashier.  at kohl's.  buy stuff and tell my manager that i am an amazing worker and i'll buy you ice cream ;) 
     school... is gay.  people are stupid there.  nassau is high school all over again except there are random old people and a lot more blacks and hispanics.  they think they're the shit.  i'm sick of all the bullshit already.  i don't want an associates degree, i just want to get out.  i'd rather work full time then go to school full time and have a part time job.     school sucks.  i hate it.  i hate getting up in the morning, driving to school, listening to teachers talk for hours, writing papers and above all the parking lot is hell when i wanna leave.  these people do not know how to drive.  you are not supposed to go like 75 in the parking lot when people are crossing the street.  i hate cars.  i wish everyone could fly.  
     today is my day off so i am going go make something of it.  i should not be sitting in front of the computer when i can go out and be free of school and work.  maybe i can do something with lauren when she gets off of school.  i love that little freak!  hmmm, i'll think of something.  well , i am going to go... goodbye."

"event","soo, i just got back from a drug test.  i peed in a cup, it was fun.  i applied to kohl's for a job and i was interviewed today by someone named ira.  he seems pretty cool and i said some funny things so everything was all right.  school's not so bad this year, just a lot different.  i miss driving to school with lauren, sharing her locker, seeing kevin, matt, and julie in the halls and of course, having lunch with them.  now, i drive to and from school alone and i don't really know anyone.  i really like my communications and guitar classes... but i hate hate hate sociology and english, they blow.  i have come to one conclusion: women professors absolutely suck. professors, what a weird word... i dislike saying that word very much, so much that i think at one time i swore i would not use it to describe college teachers... i guess i'll continue calling them teachers.  it's so weird, they expect you to call them by their first names or by professor or dr. whatever.  they think they're the shit.  anyway, my life is pretty much the same... i am still going out with the most amazing person i have ever met and probably will ever meet.  kevin is the greatest boyfriend, i am so lucky to have him.  he is incredible, he does so much for me and i try to do the same for him.  i had the best birthday, all because of kevin.  he came over my house at nine o 'clock in the morning with flowers, the sweetest card i have ever recieved and a bunch of really cool stuff for me.  he also took me out to lunch and i just had so much fun with him.  i always do and i hope it stays that way.  my parents also took me out to eat and i turned into a tomato as the staff of country kitchen sang ""happy birthday"" to me.  thanks a lot.  i also went to florida this summer and i saw mickey mouse and all of those creatures.  it was quite an experience.  i had a lot of fun spending time with kaylie and lauren annnd my mom.  although some things were not the way everyone wanted them to be, the trip was a success.  i learned some things about my family that i'd be better off not knowing but it's all good.  seeing kaylie made me really happy, she's a lot of fun to be with and she makes me laugh so much.  i miss her now.  it's so weird.  everyone is away at college and i'm still here as if nothing has changed.  i'm pretty sure i like it this way but i still feel like i'm missing out on something.  but i'm glad cause all that college is when you're away is going to parties, getting wasted and being fake.  i am a real being.  really real.  suzette had her baby.  i cannot wait to see her, dan and the baby (zoe).  she is adorable, suzette sent me pictures.  i miss her very much.  i hope that she'll call me back soon so i can visit.  i'm so bored when i'm home alone, it sucks... i feel empty.  so that's why i'm glad i might get this job at kohl's.  my aunt says that they'll hire me since they paid for the drug test but i guess we'll just wait and see.  i wonder if i can handle the job/ school combination.  i'll keep you posted.  i just have to say that julie got me the coolest shirt for my birthday and i love it.  my favorite band<3  she also made me the coolest cd with my favorite songs on it:)  and i guess that's it for now.  i have to go interact with people... hopefully i'll keep this up and update frequently.  thanks to anyone who's reading this and thank you to everyone.

"event","hey guys!!  as you can see, i decided to come back to the livejournal scene for a while, i guess... i don't know i just felt like writing today and i have a  lot to write about... so, if you don't wanna hear it, i suggest not reading this.  
     
I'll start this off by saying tomorrow is my last full day of high school and i couldn't care less.  actually, that's a lie.  i'm not going to miss much but i know that i am definately going to miss things like watching kevn and derek play guitar in guitar class... and having lunch with kevin, matt, and julie... and seeing lauren in the halls/ switching shoes for gym class (even though we only did it once) but whatever it's not like i'm going to be gone forever or anything so it's all good.  i mean, i live with lauren so i'll see her everyday and everyone else knows where to find me.  so that's my little gay paragraph about graduating high school.
     
hmmm, it's really scary though, i'm going to nassau for college and there  are so many (i'll put it into nice words) ""different"" people there.  i was so intimidated when i went to take my placement test there.  it was like i was the  only little white girl there.  i definately do not fit in, at all.  there were all these gangster girls that looked like adults with their prada or whatever kinda gear <-- lol  but it's true... i looked like i was a five year old playing dress up to look like a college person.  it's crazy.  it's going to be pretty funny, i am going to have to get a life and a job and make something out of myself.  so, that's that.  i guess we'll have to wait and see but i can tell you that it's going to be interesting, i have no idea what to do with myself.  and i'm going to be on my own... as you know, i can't handle that.  but i am going to try.  
     
anyway, i actually sucked it up and went to the prom.  i mostly did it for my mom because she was all into it and stuff and it wasn't that bad.  I went with kevin and cristina & pete.  for the most part, kevin and i just sat there, made fun of people and waited for food but i had fun.  if it weren't for him, i probably would have been miserable.  i think he didn't really hate it, so that's good too.  i felt really bad though because the prom wasn't anything like i thought it would be.  i thought that people had a reason to make a big deal out of it but it's not really like that.  it's just like any other thing you'd rent one of those really nice places for... it's kinda like a big bar mitzfah but like for everyone, i don't know... it's weird.  i hated everything about the way i looked.  the lady f-ed up my hair and she did my make- up sooo bad but i tried to fix it up the best i could and tried not to think about it.  kevin looked sooo cute in his tuxedo and he cheered me up a lot. thank you so much for going to the prom with me, kevin <3 .... 

i liked the jewlery suzette let me borrow so much and i loved how kaylie helped me with everything as i rushed to get ready because the hair place took forever.  kaylie helped me with the ballet shoes and made them look really cool and she taught me what fraying is.  lol  thank you so much kaylie <3 ...
     
speaking of kaylie, i miss her soo much.  i haven't seen her in a while and i really want her to stay here again soon.  i hope she's having fun with her friends and stuff though, it makes me really happy to see that she's happy now but i'm selfish and i want her to stay with me and lauren for a bit.  she makes me laugh so much and we have a lot of fun together.  and i need someone to sleep with!!  j/k but not really... lol
     
anyway, suzette is like 7 or 8 months pregnant and i can't wait until she has the baby.  it's going to be so cute!  and i miss her so much, i haven't seen her either.  it sucks.  but hopefully i'll see her soon and if she needs any help from me with the baby or anything, i hope she'll ask me cause i would be more than happy to help her with something.  she has halped me so much since i met her and my life would not be the same without her.
     
wow, i wrote a lot.  and i think i still have more to write about... this is incredible.  maybe it's a good thing i haven't written in a while, i have so much to say now.  hmmm, well, i broke my record, i have been going out with kevin for almost 9 months now.  i love him so much though, i couldn't imagine what my life would be like without him, like if i didn't have him to talk to or give me me directions or help me with things.  even though, we hang out everyday i don't get sick of him or anything.  it's insane, but i love it.  and yeah, he did go on fire 2 months ago.  it was really scary and i felt so bad because i was there and i didn't know what to do.  i missed him a lot, he had to stay in the hospital for almost a week.  thank god, he's ok :)
     
i am going to be 18 soon, it's going to be so weird.  in like 2 months, i'll be able to buy cigarettes and porn and stuff, not like i am going to cause i'm not.. but still, i'll be able to.  damn, i am getting so old.  i need to get a job so bad, i can't stand having my dad buy me gas and give me money for things.  even though, that sounds pretty good.. i'm a little crazy and want to be able to support myself.  it might sound dumb but maybe it'll help me out someday.  i liked working at the deli because i had my own money and felt like i was getting money for a reason but now it's like anytime i need money, it like appears out of nowhere and it's not my own.  whatever, i just need a job, i don't really want one cause i'm lazy but i need a job.
     
i think i am running out of things to write... i feel like such a loser, i wrote like a novel on livejournal and no one will read this crap but i don't care.  i'm glad i wrote this, even if it is only for myself.

"event","heyyy!  i apologize to whoever reads this because i haven't written in a while ...and i'm boring.  well, today was the first day of school (gross) and it wasn't as bad as i thought it would be.  wow, i'm really old and i'm taking complete bullshit for classes.  i have a bunch of cool people in some of my classes and i'm really happy about that... man, i had homework tonight, how much does that suck?!  i had to write a poem about my name, which i hate, and i really don't want to read it in front of the class or anything.  it's completely ridiculous.  what are these people thinking?!  so, anyway.. i'm pretty sure this year is going to be a joke.  o wow, i drove to school today.  i think i pissed myself a little cause i was sooo nervous but me and lauren made it to school alive!!  and for some reason that burning in my stomach feeling followed me all day.  it was awful, i was all nervous and nerdy for no reason.  it was painful and uncomfortable but i can't complain.  i'll be fine.  anyway, timmy came over after school today, yeah i drove him here in the pouring rain.  it was crazy, i was so terrified.  so, he hung out here for a while, messing with people on lauren's s'n.  it was pretty funny.  AND suzette is coming over tomorrow and i can't wait, i miss her soooo much!  she still hasn't seen my haircut and she hasnt seen how amazing i got at playing the guitar!  well, actually i got worse  but who cares!?  this is my journal and i'm allowed to lie in it if i want to.  yeah, i'm also 5'9, blonde, 135 lbs. and super sexyyy.  yeah right!  i'm such a fag, i should go hang myself or drown in in a puddle of hawaiian punch....  the red kind, cause i like it better than the green.  speaking of red things, i need to dye my hair again.  i'm so happy.  on wednesday, we are going to pick up kaylie and she's going to stay here for a while.  i miss her so much and i love being around her... shes so nice and funny.  she has this thing of making me laugh and cheering me up when i'm sad or in a bad mood or whatever.  it's amazing.  she's amazing.  i'm looking foward to having her here once again :) lately, i haven't been getting enough sleep and some random weirdo's are IM-ing me.  if smarterchild is your friend, i didn't mean to offend you when i asked to borrow it's mother's panties.  it was a joke.  i'm sorry.  i don't understand people.  well, anyway i probably have a lot more to say and there is a lot more i would like to say... but i'm way to tired to get into it and i should go to bed.  i think i'll try and write more often but we'll see what happens."

"event","hey everyone... i quit my job.  i'm a quitter, but i've been having so much fun.  i spent most of my time with kaylie and lauren.  i love them so much.  i miss kaylie a lot already.  i got home from her house today, she's in george's lake.  anyway, i saw the exorcist with them, their boyfriends matt and joe, kevin, timmy and another matt.  the movie wasn't really scary, it was kinda flamboyant but whatever it was cool.  we also went to the mall and we also made cotton candy.  having jackie, tom and kaylie over was awesome, if they weren't here i'd be bored as fuck.  we went out on aunt kathy's boat, went to adventureland and jack drove my car around everywhere.  and since our computer crashed, i like lost communication with the world.  i missed it a little bit but sometimes i find myself in front of the computer screen and i find it just depresses me.  i guess i need to get out more.  andd i passed my road test!!!  i was soo nervous i thought i was going to piss myself but i did it and i was so happy... until my dad told me i need more practice before i start driving on my own.  that was dick.  we got into a fight and he's still not talking to me  but i don't care.  he's missing out.  a shit load of stuff has happened since the last time i wrote in this  but as i'm sitting here i'm forgetting everything.  ummm, i went and saw static-x with kaylie, lauren, keith and zack.  they were amazing.  the whole thing was really cool.  zack and keith got me a shirt for my bday, i love it. (thanks so much)  and the next day i went to the city with cristina to see tsunami bomb.  we went with her cousin danielle and her friend rebecca (her name's not karen) that was incredible too.  some dumb girls were trying to start a riot or something but they were just gay.  after the show, we went out to eat and i gave my # to random strangers and waved to everyone i saw through the window.  you would think some people would realize 867-5309 was a song and not really my number.  stupid.  and i got some pretty cool things for my bday this year.  wendy came over while i was in the city and dropped off some flowers for me, they were pretty. (she's so sweet) kevin got me haggard, it's an awesome movie.  i watched it like 3 times already.  he's so cute. i love it.  timmy got me a card and $ (for a hooker) jk  suzette gave me a bunch of things for my room, if you come over i'll show you... really cool stuff.  (if any of you are reading this now.. thank you so much, i love you)  and right now it's 3:30 in the morning and i'm thinking about how messed up cristina was when she came over after being on bruce's boat.  haha, she was retarded.  but i still love her as a friend and all.  her dad is away until like september something so she's going a little crazy.  but i don't blame her, her dad's kinda uptight.  well, i should be going to bed soon, i got to wake up and go to the mall to buy gma a present cause it was her bday too.  so,everyone be good.  and please call me if you have nothing better to do."

"event","ok, i'm gonna write in this cause maybe someone will understand what the fuck is going on.  i'm sick of everything.  and all people seem to do is fuck with my mind or make me feel like shit.  it's everywhere.  
first off, i hate my job.  i do so much shit for $6 an hour and i put up with these asshole people who think that they're better than me because of where i work or what i look like or whatever.  ugh, do these people think i actually give a shit about how they like their eggs or how they like their meat sliced?!  it's ridiculous, i have to quit  and soon, before it drives me to insanity or strangling myself so i won't have to face anyone, ever again.  i just remembered today i asked someone if they'd ""like fries with that"" o jesus i might as well work at fucking mc donald's.  i mean, i don't know what i mean.
i just hate people.  as of now, i cannot say that i have a decent relationship with anyone.  and i mean that in any way... friends, family.. anyone.  i have a problem or an issue with everyone i come in contact with.  it really sucks.  and i hate it. i'm also a compulsive liar.
this shit has got to stop.  i can't take it anymore.
i'm going to stop complaining soo.. anyway, the good part about my shit life is hanging out with kaylie and lauren <33333  i love them so much.  if i was a dyke lesbian, incest wasn't gross and threesomes were legal ;) kaylie and lauren would be my lovers.  i'm just pulling your third leg.  (kaylie is the funniest person ever)
i'm going to go now, i must shower, i smell like deli. ewwwwwwwwww  o yeah and friday is my birthday.  call me if you wanna makeout or eat birthday cake."

"event","whoa, i really haven't written in this thing in a really long time.  tim reminded me to update it today... i hung with him and lauren after work.  we ordered domino's, walked around and i went deaf from them shooting cap guns at me.  anyway, it's 9:33 on a saturday night and i'm here... home like a loser.  i'm not out because i don't have any friends... o wait, i am.  i'm eating crunchy cheese doodles -yum.  thank god for a job, i'd be soo fat if i didn't work.  yeah, cristina is leaving for california tomorrow morning... i haven't seen her in a day or two  and i have a feeling i won't see her until she gets back.  she's gonna be gone for a week, i hope she has fun  cause i know being here is gonna suck.  i've been fighting with her a lot lately, it's not cool.  but some things have to be said and i'm glad we both let it out.  well, kinda.  and on top of that, i realized a lot of things i never knew about myself recently.  i am a very uncomfortable person.  i'm not comfortable with anyone or anything and i can't figure out anything by myself.  i always need help.  fuck, i'm dependent.  i've always been against dependency.. or thought i was.  but just today, tonight at 9:02 i was lying on my bed listening to glassjaw and BAM it hit me: i'm dependent :/  goddamn it.  this shit has got to stop.  i can't stand talking about it anymore so.... Monday is my cosmotology class.  it's going to be awesome, i'm going with suzette and we're going to mcdonald's for breakfast and it's just gonna be so much fun.  maybe going for a make-up class will un-ugly me.  i'm fucking horrible.  tuesday, i'm hanging out with jason... that should be interesting and prolly very fun.  he's a cool guy so it's all good.  yeah and ...so much has been going on  but of course as i'm writing this i can't remember.  umm i can't wait to see wendy again, i was talking to her online the other night and she has to come over soon.  i miss her.  it's been forever since i've seen her, it's insanely terrible.  oh yeah, i also scheduled my road test.. august 26th in freeport.  i hope i pass, it would really suck if i didn't.  i'd have to wait even longer and waiting till after my birthday- that's a bitch as it is.  damn, i'm going into the city for my birthday to see tsunami bomb with cristina, danielle and her friend..i'm thinking her name is karen for some strange reason.  my mind is drawing a blank but whatever her name is... she is really nice, i like her a lot.  she stayed with me when i forgot to bring my i.d. to CBGB's and we saw a black guy get arrested and a couple of drag queens.  and before all of this, i'm going to see FATA at the downtown with kaylie, lauren and cristina hopefully she'll be all right with kaylie going.  tim brought us an extra ticket today.  he fucking rules!  (i know you're reading this so thanks sooo much, you're awesome.)  and the day after the FATA show, i think i'm going to pennsylvania with my family.  i really hope i can get off work cause it's gonna be sick if i go.  anddd august 16th is julie's birthday, lauren and me are going to send her stuff.  she's in camp upstate... i hope it's fun up there and she has a fantastic birthday.  i have a lot of fun chilling with her and lauren, they're so funny.  Lauren's in a band!!  how cool is that?  she's the bassist... they're thinking of a name  but as soon as they do, i'll put it up on here  maybe they'll have a website, that'd be insane.  well, i think i wrote a book  so, i'm going to stop here and if i think of something else i guess i'll add it, if it's important.. you know how it is."

"event","hey- sorry i haven't written in a long time.  it seems that lately i've been kinda busy, cause i usually don't do anything so i get overwelmed when i have a couple of things to do.  so... the story of my life: i failed my math regents with a 58, i got a job at the deli near my house and everything sucks.  the good news is... i don't have to go to summer school or retake math b, i passed the chem regents by a point and i'm making money.
yesterday was the fourth of july, lots of people came over my house, got piss drunk and watched my father play with fireworks.  it was surprisingly fun... i like making fun of drunk people, chilling with my lil cousin and her friend, making sure the shannons don't drown in the pool, getting splashed, seeing massive fireworks and eating lots of food.  danielle came over yesterday too, it was awesome.  i haven't seen her in the longest time besides that one time in dunkin donuts about a few of weeks ago.  i hung out with her a lot towards the end of the night.  we took the flashlight to experience forest city late at night.  it sucked, they closed the gates.  so, we agreed to roam over to saw mill and discovered two gangster kids had broken into the constuction trucks and were messing around with that kind of shit.  then, we decided to leave saw mill because we saw a huge ass cockroach... that's when we started to walk the ghetto streets of bellmore.  as we were walking we talked about things that had happened since the last time we spoke.  so much stuff has changed but it was really cool how we could just talk as if we saw eachother everyday.  she's a really nice person, i'm glad we started hanging out again.  i missed her.  so, anyway a moth flew into my bra and i freaked out- she thought i was crazy.. i was like spasming and screaming.  it was quite funny.  somehow we ended up in front of that army base, we were looking at the signs and a cop came and yelled at us.  he said if we went in there we would be arrested and all of that other nonsense.  when we finally arrived back at my house, my mom was waiting up for us.  i forgot my phone so she was worried, she gave us some cereal and danielle slept over.
today, i went to danielle's and then to her friend matt's house... a very interesting experience.  her friends are nice, very weird but nice.  we went in his pool and then to friendly's.  we ran out of money and had to call a parent to bring up some money, it was funny but kinda not.  i felt like an idiot. but what else is new?  when i got home, i went in the pool with my mother.  i pushed her in and forced her to go underwater.  i think that was the most fun i had today.  i love my mom.  after that, i found out i was allowed to go over cristina's eventhough she's grounded.  so, i hung there for about an hour and now i'm here.. writing about my life.
this whole week was pretty cool.  i started work, kaylie stayed over and i tried to do as much as possible.  i have been feeling empty for some reason.  like i ran out of energy from not sleeping, not eating enough, working sooo much and on top of that i am just completely physically and emotionally drained.
right now i am so tired.  i have to go to work tomorrow so i am going to continue telling you about all the cool things that happened while i was hanging out with kaylie and lauren and how much i suck at working at the deli. untill then, goodnight."

"event","so, i just finished making dinner with cristina.  a rather interesting experience, i must say.  she's a really good cook, i admire her cooking skills.  i ate some of what we made, it was awesome.  i am by far the worst cook you will ever meet, i seriously cannot do anything right when it comes to cooking.  actually, it comes down to more than that... let's just say i can't do anything right ever.  but it doesn't get me down, i've learned to love my screw ups.  i find it funny when everything i try to do goes wrong, it's so cute.  
anyway, as i was walking home from school today... i was yelled at by a wigger, whistled at by dirty mexicans and beeped at.  while feeling degraded, i realized i have yet to meet a guy that hasn't been a dick to me.  cristina also pointed that out to me today, too.  it's true.  and she's like a mind reader.  but about those guys...i don't care.  say what you want, think what you want.  
tomorrow is the chem regents, i have to pass this too... it could go either way.  i need to study and go to bed, i'd love to write more cause i feel like it but i have to stop.  
fuck off and goodnight"

"event","must i explain myself?
the point is
no one gives a shit
youre blind to reality 
just open your eyes
shut your mouth
and you wouldn't even have to ask
---------------------------------
k, that was something interesting i had on my mind. 
anyway, things around here have been all right, i guess.  boring as hell.  dfp was fun, pretty good.  i have the math b regents tomorrow, i have to pass.  i don't want to have to take that bs class over or go to summer school... that would suck.  i hate school.  thank god it's almost over.. i wish it was over for good.  
i've been a shitty mood for a while now.  i just try and forget and pretend that everything's fine  but that just makes me act strange.  it's horrible.  what will it take to make me unstrange?  i don't know.  i would go for a walk but i can't... i have a stalker now.  i live in fear.  i don't want to be alone but i cannot stand to be constantly surrounded by people.  contradiction, i know.  
so, saturday... i am going to new jersey for jack's graduation.  i can't wait to see her and everyone that's going to be there.  jack showed me her prom dress last time i was there and i cannot wait to see the pictures and all.  her dress was amazing, i'm sure she looked beautiful.  i miss jack so much, i hope that this summer we get to see each other more... maybe she'll stay over here for a while or something.  we always have a lot of fun.  i can remember all the summers kaylie and jack stayed over for days with me and lauren.  some of the best times of my life have been spent with them.  i hope we always stay close.
disappointed-- i'm sure you would like to know why i decided to choose that out of all the other 300 moods.  well, obviously i am disappointed but i wanted to convey the idea that it has been a constant thing.  i'm disappointed for a lot of reasons.  i don't know how can it be possible for someone to be a complete asshole and not consider the feelings of other people.  and don't get me wrong_ this has nothing to do with me, but i've been watching the same things happen over and over... i'm sick of this situation.  i'm not going to get into it, it angers me and no one reads the bullshit i write in here anyway.  and if you're reading this and if you are the complete asshole; you wouldn't understand a damn thing i say anyway.  so fucking wrapped up in yourself.  go talk about yourself some more, i'm sure someone cares."

yesterday was the last day of school.  i couldn't give a shit and there is no way i am going to miss it at all.  i can't even think of one thing.  i'll still talk or hang out with whoever anyway.. so what's the big deal?  school put me in the worst mood but then lauren, julie, cristina and i hung out for a while and i didn't feel as bitchy. we're so funny. anyway, i finally met up with jason and his friend brian, at uncle lou's.  it was kinda strange but it was all right.  they're cool, i talked to them for a lil while.  after that, i went home to practice some more.  i wanna get really good but it's gonna take a while.  so i keep trying.  i'm not giving up on this, i give up on everything.  and i'm sick of it, it's not cool.  i'm going to stick with this.
today...
i had a spanish final.  ugh.  i guess i did okay, i don't care though.  me and cristina ate sooo much, we had wendy's then got some ice cream, i seriously thought i was going to puke.  we chilled at cristina's house.  it was pretty cool, we don't do that too often.  she thinks i hate her house but i don't, i actually like it there.  we played some hardcore badminton in her backyard, o god, i'm horrible at it.  it was so incredibly hot.   we decided to go in my pool.  i froze my boobs off, it's sooo cold!  stupid slutty bathing suits, yeah. that's right, i blame my skanky bikini. ewww.  i hate it.  lauren, julie, cristina and i are hicks.  we ordered pizza from domino's and sat out on the driveway in our towels and ate.  we looked mad ghettto, i had fun.  
i'm going to take a shower now, i smell really bad.  aha!  i couldn't give a fuck what anyone thinks of me anymore.. so think what you want to and believe whatever you'd like.  shower  hmm remind me... i got electrocuted this morning.  it was the craziest feeling.  it happened to me before but this time, i got out of the shower and flipped on the light.  o man, it was insane, i felt it go up my arm i got so freaked out. ahhh!  well, i should go now.  bye."

anyway, today i finished driver's ed.  i think i passed the final.  i hope i did.  i need to drive more cause if i took the road test now, i'd definately fail.  i suck.
i was supposed to go to this car show after driver's ed, but i decided not to.  instead i cleaned my room, washed laundry, ate lots of ice pops, listened to music and played guitar.  i shouldv'e went with lauren.  i told her i would go.  i've been such an ass lately.  lauren, i'm sooo sorry.  and i still owe you a slurpee.  i shouldv'e went with you last night, too.  i suck."

"event","*let's start this off by saying...
Anything that begins now won't be going anywhere -- so if you're not interested, don't turn on that lethal charm. This stuff is easier to get going than to shut down.  -that is indeed my horoscope, yes i am obsessed.  some good advice... maybe this time i'll listen.
_school, sucks... but i had a lot of fun singing avril to emo boys on my way walking to the bus.  i finally realized, i deserve the strange looks i get from  random people i decide to sing to.
_yesterday, i found the best band.  i really love them... i want to sound just like them so i am going to practice sooo fucking much.  new obsession. 
_last night, cristina's recital was awesome.  she looked hot.  avril, cristina and i walked the streets, got whistled at, yelled at some guys and went to 7-11.  we saw some hot emo kids.  then we had a massive sleep over... some fun stuff, eventhough i had trouble staying awake.  
_anyway, today i applied for a job at that deli near my house.  hopefully, i'll get a job there.  it'd be awesome, i could walk there and all and the guys that work there are very attractive.  suzette came over today too, i need some more practice.  i love it when she comes over :)  we're going to have a hair painting party!  i'm dying my hair again and cristina wants to do some kind of something to hers.  we also hung out with some hot guys ;) and studied for our driver's ed final tomorrrow.  
_now, i am extremely bored and cristina's at her dance recital (there's one tonight too)  i should probably be studing or something but i'd rather be fucking around. 
things i HAVE TO do:
1) study a lot
2) pass all my tests
3) find cristina an awesome emo kid
4) get a job
5) hang out with jason (dude, im sorry we haven't made plans yet i didnt forget.. we will)
6) stop being a bitch to harmless people (i really am sorry, this applies to a lot of people... WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH ME?!)
7) practice and burn cd's for suzette 
_well, that's all for now... i'm going to try and get a life.  laterr gangsterrrs."

"event","hey, everything sucks.  but i'm not about to sit on my ass complaining about it so... i'll start out by saying ""Never Trust Anyone.""  not only do i follow that statement but i find it is unfortunately right.  people are fucking freaks. i'll provide some evidence to back up my theory. since today, i refuse to go anywhere by myself.  as a lot of people know, i like to go walking sometimes.  so, today i realized some strange guy was like kinda watching me, i didn't think anything of it. then, he started to follow me.  of course i freaked out cause i'm the kinda paranoid type but this was not another one of my paranoias, i must've seen him about 5 times on my way home which i thought was a bit too much of a coincidence, if you know where i live you'd understand.  plus he was in a car.  i'd like to believe that he was lost but my instincts tell me different. so anyway i walked home so fucking fast.  and this guy wasn't young, he appeared just plain weird and gave off this sorta stalkerish kinda vibe.  i might be crazy, but i truly am afraid to go anywhere alone.  so thanks to this retard- ugh i hate people.  and i hate dreams.  peace, i'm going to attempt to sleep
p.s. if you didn't read cristina's entry tonight, you should some good stuff in thurr . . . and if you don't read hers, i think you should.  excellent skills.  i love you cristina!! (in the best friends way- sorry, no lesbian here)"

today, my mother and i had a ""discussion""... i get so mad because she tries to dictate my feelings.  she makes it like everything is fine when she says it is.  i hate it.  she can't tell me how to feel!  i've been stripped of my rights, i swear, sometimes it seems that way.  anyway, i had a huge fight with her and i guess you would say i ""ran away"" but i would say i left the house without telling anyone.  only lauren noticed, she went out looking for me (sorry lauren, xoxo)  i went for a walk... by myself.  i wasn't lonely or afraid or anything but i was kinda annoyed at pervy people yelling stuff at me.  i don't think i've ever given the finger so many times in one day.  that pissed off this one really skanky guy, i thought he was going to pull over and kill me.  i kind of wished he had.  this might sound extrememly morbid but... i just don't understand why i even exist.  i fuck up everything.  i'm always in a huge mess and i am sick of it.  now, don't get me wrong... this is not a sucidial entry.  it's not like ""i hate everything and i'm gonna kill myself.""  i'm not that stupid.  it's just that i've been thinking a lot and i just don't get the point.  what the fuck am i doing here?  lately it seems i'm here for everyones amusement, i don't like it.  recently i see how so many people have been so horrible.  was i fucking blind?  is everyone superficial and narrow-minded?  i can't understand it and i guess i never will.  i mean, i wish i could live my life not giving a shit about anyone else but i can't. ((( i'll stop there with all that)))  tomorrow is going to suck.  chorus rehearsal after school :::ick::: my concert is on thursday at 7 if you wanna bore yourself to death, i suggest going.  well, i guess this might depress you ... so, go back to your artificial life and call me when you wake up. 661-4609"

"event","o shit... i just got home from the movies, i went to see mean girls with lauren and cristina, and lauren and i had a massive fight with our mother.  i  lied to her and she was mad cause she caught me in a lie.  i told her cristina's brother was going to drive us to the movies and back home.  the truth was he was going to drive us there and we were going to walk home.  yeah, three girls walking pretty far at 11 at night isn't the greatest idea, but my parents were really drunk and i just didn't want that.  so, my mom is really mad at me but she started a fight with my sister and i have a feeling this aren't going to turn out so well.  there was a lot of bad shit said... i know we're going to regret it tomorrow.  see, the thing is... i don't think she realizes what she says and does has a huge effect on us.  we're not gonna play it out like everything's ok... because it isn't.  everything she says is hypocritical.  i can't stand it.  i hate lying to her but this time i thought it was necessary.  if i were to say ""no, we're walking home""  she would've been like ""you are not walking home... are you fucking crazy, it's 11 at night, you're gonna get raped, i'm picking you up""  and that would've been bad.  so, now im kinda sad. (i hate when people are mad at me)  but whatever, i'll live.  ugh, i'm soo sick of my life.  do you ever wish you could just fade away and never be bothered with again?  i feel like that right now.  it's depressing but it's true.  people amaze me sometimes.  it's like we live to make each other completely miserable.  why can't things be different?  am i right, it seems everyone does whatever they possibly can to bring someone else down.  :(  stupid people.  i'm in the strangest mood right now, i'm kinda happy yet not.  and i am so extremely tired.  it hurts me to write this...my hands are so heavy, my body aches, im so sleepy. but i just feel like i want to spill out everything in this goddamn thing... but i just can't.  everything i have to say, it's even concealed in my mind.  i'm used to hiding so much that it all seems so natural, bury it in my mind and forget about it.  just like a flower... you plant it, forget about it, and when it grows.. that's when you can see it.  and all those things you say to me, i don't want to hear it.  i automatically block it out.  i think i'm at a point where i couldn't make less sense so i'm going to stop here.  goodnight"

"event","hey, hey... last night was soo incredibly incredible, s0Oo much fun!!  me, lauren and julie went to go see shrek 2 but it was sold out :( so we walked home from bellmore village, we saw some kid piss on a building.  walking home took almost an hour and you'd think it'd be boring as hell... it wasn't.  me and lauren sang obnoxiously and counted how many people shut their windows.  it was quite entertaining.  julie and i are extremely paranoid and julie is afraid of bugs going in her hair. interesting fact.  when we arrived home, we realized it was too early to stay in so we went to uncle lou's for some ice cream and attempted to skate in the parking lot.  warning: there are a lot of old drunk people in front of the bayou at night.  they didn't bother us but trust me, they're wild and crazy.  we instigated round the wantagh ghetto.  we really should've called the cops on those dumb kids last night, but we decided not to.  what's the point?  they're gay assholes anyway.  i'll end this entry with a lesson i learned... there's always someone there for you, even when you think there's no one... you'll always have someone.  i've got lauren and she's got me.  no matter what.  s4l  aww kaylie, we miss you soooooo much.  i'm also in a shit load of trouble cause i got the progress report today.  failing spanish, in danger of failing math and chem.  oh well, fuck it.. i don't care.  :)"

you know people who try so hard to escape conformity.. and try to be so different, that they arent doing what they like anymore.. just what is totally opposite of the ""main stream"" thingy majiggy..... its just another form of conformity itself.. fucking losers.

I am an idiot though.. so dont take my word.. for anything. :-D

She is hilarious. But my mother was not. jesus christ she is so disgusting when she drinks.. she wasnt wearing underwear, and she wore a dress.. erm, a short dress... and if you told her to back off in any way, she would get extremely offended.. it was really annoying.. man o' man.<BR>on saturday morning my dad picked us up.. around 7:30 a.m... to go to maine for the 4th of july. when we got there weee canoed... went in the motor boat, fished... ate stuff... and nern, andie, and I went out about every night into town and it was really foggy.. we saw a moose... we were talking about scary movies and such, and we came apon the subject of silence of the lambs.. we are all in to doing impersonations.. so they got me to talk very similarily to the transexual serial killer in that movie.. and a hannibal lector voice... here are some of the sayings that lasted into the entire weekend...<BR><FONT color=#ff0000><EM>*buffalo bill voice*</EM><BR></FONT><FONT color=#cc33cc><STRONG>preciouuuss</STRONG></FONT></P><FONT color=#cc33cc></FONT>

<P>especially the stinkbugs.</P>
<P>I saw an eagle in maine too... twas fun, but my grandparents are horrible people.. and Id rather spend my life alone and bitter, then grow bitter with someone else and loose the love I once had for them.</P>
<P>but who knows what'll happen.. I press the enter key too often... you guys should reeaaad this all, and I also hope that you will understand the dialog.. up there.... and I hope you laugh...</P>

I dont know what else to say.. hmm oh yes and heather saw her friend tj.. **shiver** ... there was a drunk there, who sounded like a pirate.. the way his mouth moved was cute.. especially without the teeth oh baby.. anyway, since he was so drunk, he had like his own language.. when he asked for a cigarette he would be like,"" duh anywah havaa cigaraahh?"" good times, good times.
Then there was a ""battle"" thanks sarah.. :) in the parking lot where everyone was getting beaten up.. I didnt see it.. but I saw derek filming it, and this guy punched him, it didnt look like he punched him that hard from far away, but derek was bleeding.. ooouch....

"event","alriiight.. Im going to try and ""vent"" about absolutely nothing. :-D
Im sitting here typing with nothing to do, Ive probably looked at everyones journal 3 fucking times.... ay, the heat is unbearable especially when I am wearing a sweatshirt. I hate that feeling you get when its summer, and there is nothing to do, but sit in your own filth and watch tv for 20 million hours. Even though my sister is here, I feel like Im doing nothing, and not taking advantage of the time we have together. Something seems different about us, its like I cant act my age around her, like im five years old again. Before she left last year, she was like my best friend, someone that I felt was at a mutual level as I... but she just seems.. I dont know older, even though I know i've grown smarter, I feel like im going back in time..

look at me being.. or maybe trying to be all deep and shite.. it might be this heat, or the fact that it is 1:46 right now.. i dont know.

I am so fucking bored.. I NEED TO DO SOMETHING... I should read, but blah.. boring all over again. i'll keep on typing, and you all better fucking read this, and not skim through it because this entry is longer than most. Everything is starting to tick me off, and its making me mad at myself.. Im the biggest hypocrite ever. I get ""pissy"" about people complaining.. and yet I do it toooooooo... i keep daydreaming about camp, and the people i meet there, there is supposed to be a new director, I wonder how that'll all turn out.

vagina

penis

blah blah blah.. ANOTHER flaw I'm seeing in my personality is that.. I get jealous... really fast too, and it makes me sad.. you know how it is.

I want to see fahrenheit 9/11 reeeeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaallly FUCKING BAD!!!!!! and anchorman baby.. ooo *growl* mama cita.... will ferreellll mmm ooh yeahh.. work it..

this entry kinda went from serious.. to ridiculous..

I hope you guys saw a side of me.. that you wanted to see

this weekend was a perfect way to end it all.. I slept over tracy's with jill, and that was fun.
Then in the afternoon around 12:00 we went to ocean beach and we were kind of rushed because we had to have heather home early so we could go to the pops concert. That concert was much nicer than i thought it was going to be, ha ha.. err I sort of cried when they sang ""a whole new world"" because one of the couples faces looked so.. I dont know enraptured with each others gaze, and it was just really beautiful... haha I am a dork.

Im saying that the women should have the ONLY right to vote about abortion... men are never going to be in the situation where they have to decide wether to keep the child or not thats in their body... if a man wants to keep his child or put it up for adoption, then yes he should get a say(not to vote but the decision to abort it) but it is mostly the women.. think about this.. a baby living inside you for fucking 9 months.. throwing up all the time, having contractions, and having to pee... also, it hurts enough when a penis goes in there the first time.. its going tofucking blow for the baby to come out.. Im not trying to preach about how birth is a horrible horrible thing, Im just saying that physically its the womans choice.

I tried to pretend like I was buying candy but sarah didnt ask untill I was up at the counter... 

Sarah: oh yeah, and can I get some condoms?

"event","i hate to complain because my close friends at school have heard about it all day, but this is my journal, and Im venting I guess.. I doont want to sound like a drama queen, but it is impossible for you to understand what I am going through so dont make any judgments.

Lastnight, My mom called, canceling her plans with me today.. she said she had an earlier commitment that she couldnt miss. she was pausing alot, and clearing her thoat, which were things that you could tell she had been drinking, besides the fact that her whole voice sounded different... I come right out, and start cry a little, and ask her if she had been drinking.. She said that she had before about 3 days ago, and said she went crazy and that she didnt know what came over me.. then she fucking laughed, like it was no big deal that she gained her daughters trsust back and crushed it in a couple seconds.. it was no big deal that she had been trying so fucking hard for about 6 months to remain sober... she used to do this, but for only weeks at a time, where again it would raise my hopes and crush them... but now shes done something more, I felt like my whole world was just getting brighter everyday, and that my dad shouldnt be the only reason I should livbe.. I was starting to look up to her, for going back to school and going to a.a... Now I cant say Im proud of her.. I cant say those things anymore because they are gone..

Before she told me she had been drinking I had my suspicions, but when she told me it felt like, ""wow, its real.. shes not sober anymore, she doesnt care."" It hurt more than anything, and it was like getting punched in my stomach, it was also the hardest Ive ever cried.. I couldnt breathe practically, and she simply said, ""Im sorry, I'll do it for you"".. well doing it for me just doesnt do it does it? No... It has to be for herself, and I dont want to be a part of it anymore.
I just cant deal with it.

lastnight I wrote a letter to my mom, because I was so upset.. I couldnt just rush to the computer to type it up:

Lorie-
How could you do this to me? You were sober for 6 months.  I called you on your birthday and when you talked you had the same traits as you did when you were drunk.. I got a little suspicious, but I blew it off giving YOU the benefit of the doubt. I trusted you. You called me tonight with the same traits, I finally ask you, and I break down.. You gave me an answer.... that you were going crazy for three days and that YOU went through fucking hell for the three days... then you laugh.. you havent even taken in the fact that I.. your daughter whoi has been by your side this whole time would feel any better... I couldnt fucking breathe I was crying so much and when you laughed it made me cry even more... its like I MEAN NOTHING TO YOU! I told myself not to actually think that you were finally recovering, but I did anyway... and you lied... I know you were drinking tonight.. you fucking say you are over it, that you've gone through enough and yet you have the fucking balls to tell me that you are sober tonight!? fuck you.... My life was fucking great for the 6 months you were sober, and now thats all crashing down. I bonded with you in those months more than I ever had in my whole life.. and you threw that all away for some booze.... dont expect me to stand by your side anymore.. I cant handle it.. and obviously you cant either. If it wasnt for dad, I would fucking slit my wrists.
The mom I love is now dead.
-emily

that letter sounds mean to someone who... isnt me.. but you dont understand how hard it can be to live, or even have an alcoholic parent.. I used to think that since she moved out it wouldnt affect me anymore.. but it still does.. or I wouldnt be writing this entry,,

"event","Hey,
Today was okay, I cant wait till tomorrow, goin  to the gay mens chorus thing at the guarde.. yep, and sarah and I are going to walk back.. in the dark.. alone.. and vulnerable... soo.... Im going to cut her..

I hate mosquitos sooo much... I loathe them.. I absolutely despise them... *hiss*...

Today I was watching tv, and a commercial came on where there was like.. techno music.. and I just got up and did the robot thing.. It was really sad since I was alone, and just danced..
Then I realized how much of a dork I am. *le sigh* oooh well.
I think I am pretty much free on saturday night.. or sunday.. (hint hint)
Heather's hair is even more beautiful.. its bright red... and delicious.. just the way I like em'. My neighbors cats had kittens.. I am being really random with this entry, because I cant think of anything else to write, I talked to my mom. She hasnt stopped going to a.a. I really hope that when I talked to her on her birthday that she was only in a bad mood and thats why she sounded out of it.. My dad's been really negative about it, by saying, ""no, I doubt it... she was drunk most likely."" :( He was in a really bad mood yesterday.
*hums to shakira*   I am sooo bored. I have to do my homeowork soon but I really dont feel like it...der.
theres this music group.. there music is ""texican"" (I saw on the infomercials) it reminded me.. what if there was a band with the music of... conncasian... ooor afriblama... very clever eh? not really.. In spanish class a long while ago, I did a project where I video taped myself speaking in spanish.. I got it back today.. the video tape that is, ands I crossed out the original lable,""sponser a child"".. and put paris hilton sex tape.. I tried to trick sarah.. anyway I forgot about the lable and brought the tape to english because I dont have time to put my books in the locker.. anyway kyle, some kid saw it and tried to steal it.. perv.


I love you,

Especially because heather and jill are mean, and did all this best friends mumbo jumbo thingies...*wimper* without me.
This afternoon I went to heathers. I forgot to mention that on monday I like broke my foot, and the pains just getting worse. sooo, I walked to heathers limping, I bet I looked pretty ridiculous without any shoes limping slouching over, dragging my fists in the sand, and drooling globs of.. spit. hah hah kidding, but I was limping. Then suddenly a huge amount of pain shot up my leg and I couldnt walk, I was afraid I wasnt going to be able to walk the rest of the way, but I hobbled along, and took offmy shoes which made ita little easier. At heathers I ate food, and passed out on the floor. when I woke up we ate dinner. delish hot dogs.. *drool*.. I used to be addicted to them.. 3 every morning. not anymore though. Then for desert we had billions o' strawberries with homemade.. Might I say HOMEMADE AGAIN because it was soooo good, the whipped cream that is. but.. your stomach starts to hurt after too much. :D My dad picked me up, and here I am.. typing this entry.... with many pauses but no ends.

Emil

We spent the whole weekend looking at retro clothes, drinking coffee, walking on the pier, and repeatedly going into sarges comics where I was drooling over the lord of the rings merchandise. eh heh, I creep myself out. Anyway, I cant stop daydreaming, and its driving me crazy. I dont payy attention in class and when I try to go to sleep all I think about is... BEING HORNY!!... yes, I am thinking about you. *le sigh*  fook, I hate gym. stupid soccer, and stupid team that I got stuck with gahh..

"event","helloo.. I havent been very good at typing in this journal because of all the homework, I hate coming back from the break.. This morning I was reaaaaallly tired, I dont know why, I went to sleep kinda early. I loathe the way my English teacher grades our papers... alright heres the story, I dont mean to sound like a snot for complaining, but its made my mood really bad after I found out... here goes. Alright about a month ago I wrote a narrative story for english class, I thought it was well written besides the fact that the grammar and punctuation might of been incorrect. I also thought I did more than was required for it. after we turned them in, she said that most of the class had really bad grammar and punctuation, so she gave em' back to us corrected by her, and told us to type it up corrected. Assuming that she did all the correcting, with all of the red pen and all, I only corrected it by her standards, so I didnt really look it over because she didnt say otherwise. when she handed the corrected papers back, mine had NEW red pen on it, meaning she found ""more"" corrections to be made. She took off 17 points off MY grade for her missing the other corrections. When I went to her about the grade, she said, ""ooh yeah, I found more."" SHE COULDNT GET IT THROUGH HER THICK HEAD THAT I THOUGHT IT WAS UNFAIR THAT SHE TOOK IT OFF MYYYYY GRADE!!!! agggghhhh, the part that makes me mad even more, is that she hasnt taught us practically anything on how to correctly write essays, or the correct format. What worries me, is that my huge 9 page book report that I just handed in is probably going to come back to me with all these shitty red marks, and seriously I spent about 6 hours writing that, and a whole lot of other time to get the information. I know that this does make me sound like an arrogant ass, for not letting go 17 points and letting slip the fact that it could me my fault, but I dont care. My standards are higher now that I WANT to go to college, and I want to have strait a's, but inexperienced teachers like this one get in the way. I hate how your whole day can be ruined with one lousy graded paper. She should grade more on the content and effort than on the things SHE DOESNT TEACH!

FUCK YOU MRS. WRIGHT!!!!

Emil

"event","well last night... was a good night. Heather and Jill slept over. I am going to ake this as descriptive as I possibly can to lengthen the entry, yo. I was told by some person that goes by the name of Jillian Leigh Hersey, that they would arrive at my house at approximately 3:00 p.m. But it just so happens that they arrived at 4:05... 1 hour and 5 minutes late!!!.. They kept me waiting, and waiting, and waiting... and waiting. Oh well. When they got here, we put on our costumes.. I know.. Im a nerd, you dont have to tell me. So, we took our padded swords into.. the wild. And we walked down this huge path.. and kept hitting eachother with the swords. I had to pee.. so I peed. On the side of the path.. (dont say anything jill/heather)... SO after I marked my territory jill kept taking pictures of us acting out scenes from LORD OF THE RINGS... yeah, Then since I hadnt eaten all day, I was pretty weak, so we walked a long and tiresome walk home. and ate. It was delish, my dad bought us a lot of junk food, but for some reason it didnt atisfy my quench.. for man flesh. so I ate heather.. kidding kidding. no I just ate stuff. Anyway, heather didnt eat anything at all except beef jerky and fresca. which is not a lot. jesus fucking christ. anyway, so jill drank and ate mountain dew, and baked lays, and some other stuff. after that we went outside I brought my blanket because I was cold and I lay it down on the ground, and while heather and jill paraded around in the swamp the neighbors cat came over.. how I love that cat so. Then we went back inside.. I left the blanket outside by accident. we watched the movie copycat.. and the serial killer was really hott without those HUGE thick glasses.. and besides the fact that he was insane.. eh eh.. heh.  Then we watched a part of alien 2, and sigourny was all over the tv. shes hott in that movie.. but.. she looks wrinkly.. and saggy. :D.. then we watched this french porn thing. it was hott.. and these too people were having sex, this girl was on top of the man and jill says, she says to me, ""if thats what it looks like, I am never having sex."" I thought that was funny. Then we got my bnlanket from outside.. or should I say heather and jill because Im afraid of the outside.. when its dark... Then I tried to keep them awake.. by just talking, and then I got jill a little more awake by bring out the video game.. and that was hott. but then she just rolled over. Oh and nick, I watched cowboy bebop... I liked it, but I didnt know what the whole plot was.. since, Ive only watched one episode.. and yeah. Anyway... Then I feel asleep. at around 4:30 or 5. when I woke up, jill and heather were leaving.. :( and it was sad.. *demon voice* I am going to REALLY kill them.. on friday.

The sleep over was good. We made fun of heathers.. ""experience"" the whole time pretty much, and that was fun.. ooh wow, today my dad hit a pidgeon with a slingshot, and it was really sad, I went over by the bird, but it kept hopping away, its left wing looks broken and it was bleeding a lot. grrrrr.... i couldnt get to the bird. I wanted to just.. hold it or something. but it hobbled under a thorn bush, where I couldnt see it. :(


Love you,

The back of my shirt said legalize gay marriage, and some kid said I should change it to illegalize.. what a fucking dipshit.. Anyway, so I started from the beginning, ""what is your problem with the gay/lesbian community? He said nothing aboslutely nothing. GOD FUCKING DAMNIT! why the fuck would you even make a wise ass remark if you have NOTHING to back it up with. fucking fuck!... Also what REALLY upset me today was (I heard on the bus) that people are making badges.. yes fucking badges that say, no I dont agree with gay marriage gay people are stupid and shite like that... People think that the rainbow pins were only for gay people, BUT THEYA RE NOT!!!!!!!!! They are the sybol for diversity. fucking assholes.. god damnit..

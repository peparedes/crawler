"event","If your life consists of talking about two bands or some subject that you have no actual knowledge of don't reply to my live journal.

Seriously.  No...really.

Two people at work, who will go unnamed, seriously discuss the same two bands everyday.  Every single day.  It's as if they can't travel outside of the bands to find something else to talk about.  

And then when they don't talk about that, they want to debate God or pyschology.  I have no problem with debating either, but it's a little frustrating when they haven't read the bible and are clueless to psychology.  

So seriously, if your life consists of two bands and circle jerking don't reply.  I don't think that applies to anyone here, I just want to cover all bases."

*in a whisper* You can make a difference

It's come time to abandon, your horse and your cause
You tell me it's all worth it, I should applaud
But your valient effort, Yes I mock you!
Has only dragged us down!
Your careful practice and patience in this
Will burn us to the ground!
So come down off your high horse, you immoral man of God
Your belief will only sunder our unity.

Why should I trust you now?
You've only served to bring us down
Your illusion only brings you comfort
To hide away your frailty

Mans illusions justify his cause.

Its high time you step down, off the ledge your standing on
Remove your badge of honor, and put down your sword
But your valiant accord, Yes I shun you!
Only serves to divide
Those among us who are not you
So shed your pinstripe costume, you immoral man of greed
Your beliefs, I will not tolerate.

Why should I trust you now?
You've only shown your greedy smile

Faces can lie just as easily
Faces are frauds full of dreams

Selfless and kind, you have great faith in people.
Sometimes this faith can lead to disappoinment in the long run.
No matter what, you deal with everything in a calm and balanced way.

You are a good interpreter, very sensitive, intuitive, caring, and gentle.
Concerned about the world, you are good at predicting people's feelings.
A seeker of wisdom, you are a life long learner looking for purpose and meaning.
You are a great thinker and communicator, but not necessarily a doer.

"event","Being that I'm reading a lot of psychology right now, and still very interested in it amazingly.  I'm going to try and voice how I feel right now.  This is still things I couldn't say to most people in real life for fear of being misunderstood.  But I'll try to here because it's much easier.

I feel like I'm waiting on some very bad news.  The type of anxious feeling you get when you're waiting in a hospital waiting room.  It feels like something in my life is about to take a very bad turn for the worse.  My entire body is tense and my gut says ""go home and sleep this off"".  I can't do that because I'm forcing myself to be productive inspite of it, but even that is hard.

This anxiety is aweful.  You know the question ""If you could fix one part of yourself what would it be?""  This would be it.  Anxiety is by far the worst feeling a person can get.  Even sorrow has an ending eventually.  Eventually things get better, but for a person with anxiety there is never an ending.  Somedays are good, but most are very tormenting.  Imagine (for those that have never experienced this) sitting in a chair and being deathly afraid of everything around you.  Imagine feeling like you were about to get fired, fail a test, lose your friends, and get disowned by your entire family in the same day.  

Now imagine being completely conscious the entire day and realizing that you're afraid of nothing, but never being able to calm down.  It's an irrational fear, but one you can't rid yourself of.  It comes and goes.  On good days it's only about 5 to 10 minutes.  On bad days it comes and goes every 4-5 minutes.  One minute you're working...the next you're body is in a cold sweat and you can't think clearly.  On really bad days, you can't do anything but sleep and worry.

By and far, nothing I have ever seen or done has ever phased me, but the longer this anxiety goes on, the more and more I want to walk out and sleep in my car hoping that it will be gone when I wake up."

See numbers like 0 and 9 defend you from the evil trolls. You can't defend yourself against trolls without a shield. But if you're going to use a shield you can't very well have a big weapon like a 7. A 7 is a two-handed weapon. So in stead you should use a 2 or a 1."

Thems the stats so far.  It should be noted that my #1 reciever (Nope, not you Brandon) went down in the preseason, but is do back soon.  So his recievers should be of much better quality.  Brandon's been #1 and doing a good job, but I still wanna get a few seasons under him before he breaks to the #1 spot for good.

Sean's been playing main, but the two teams we played were smashmouth (Majority running) teams.  So I expect he'll get a bit more later on.  

Props:
Ty man, think you could have a better 2nd game?  150+ rushing and averaging a big 10 yards per carry.  Sheesh.

Scott duder, nice safety.  Wish you could have celebrated with me.  

Slops: 
Me for not picking those passes off.
Sean  for not having any forced fumbles.

"event","Yeah so i've been bored all week and figured I'd have another boring day.  Then I check my email and find that apparently a lesson I did a few months ago was too short.  Keep that in your minds for a second.

For those that don't know, my job at mc strategies is no longer the webmaster.  I've moved on to content development, so my job is to build and edit lessons for the clients and also for our own stock content.  It's the same job, different boss, different location.

The average lesson I've come across is around 20-40 pages.  It's not a stretch to see a 50 page lesson.  Most of the time these pages get cut down, but not really a noticable amount.  Usually do to page numbering errors or including something as a page that really isn't.

The original lesson, the one that was too short?  A mere 108 pages.  I cut that down to 75.  So 75 pages....and that's too short.  So what do they send me?  A Powerpoint thats 257 pages long.  


This.sucks.hardcore.

At first my mind rejects the simple notion of flying to Philidelphia to go to a Grand Prix, but my good friend Mike reassures me this is a good idea and informs me that he will be accompanying me to said Grand Prix.  Scott also agrees and now three friends are planning for a trek to the Atlanta airport to fly to this unknown city of ""Phil-e-dalfia"" to play in a ""Graaaaand"" ""Pree"".

Could I take a case where the person involved doesn't deserve what they are asking for?  Could I win a custody case for a parent who shouldn't be a parent?

See with anger, you can still feel pain and hurt.  With joyful you can still feel sad.  But with fear...well with fear you don't feel anything but fear.

Last night my mom told my dad he would need to call an ambulance as if it was nothing at all.  My uncle needed to go to the hospital and I wondered if we had all just been so convinced that the end was close that no one felt afraid that this was it.  That stood there and discussed things and might have very well continued the discussion if I hadn't told them to call the ambulance.  And then as if it were a get together or something, my mom starts straitening up the house.  The whole situation was un-nerving.  I had to retreat to my room and try to ignore all of this in hopes that I would make sense out of it today.  But it still doesn't make sense.

When I'm close to death I hope there's a sense of urgency to do whatever someone can to save me.  I would hate knowing that everyone just ""expected"" it.

He's in the hospital now and they are saying he'll be fine.  But still..."

Lately that's what shit feels like.  I'm running in seven different directions at once, at all times.  I can't get out from underneath this ladies change requests.  One turns to two more by the end of the day.  -.- I've been threw atleast 20 of these things and for one lesson that's a lot.

I'm not going to be at waffle house at all for a little while.  Right now it seems there are a lot of different things going on that make me less and less comfortable being there.  I'd rather not be there while this stuff is going on...and I really shouldn't be there.  I should be moving on with things.  

This doesn't mean I'm not friends or that I'm mad, though there are some things that rubbed me the wrong way.  It's just that things have been said by a lot of people that don't mix well with my best interests, which everyone should know by now are the first on my priority list.  If you didn't know, then you weren't paying attention.

So rather than continue to be uncomfortable I'm going to opt to not be.  I'll spend time at home where the problems are my own and I'm not constantly wondering where I fit into the picture."

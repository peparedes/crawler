"event","I am a Craigslist JUNKIE.&nbsp; I like to buy, sell, trade anything.&nbsp; I Came across an ad the other day that was offering up a decent BMX bicycle in exchange for work on his car, which happened to be a 2000 Cavalier that needed a wheel bearing.&nbsp;&nbsp; We exchanged contact info through email.&nbsp; I recieved a lot of text messages from him, and tried calling but his phone was set up not to accept any calls whatsoever.&nbsp; The day I was supposed to do the work for him, I got a message from him saying the car was impounded for not paying a parking meter and he was not going to be able to make it.&nbsp; I did not believe him because it sounded too convenient.&nbsp; I told him I am taking the bearing back I had already purchased and thanks for wasting my time.&nbsp; He then called me from a payphone, his name is Frank. Frank tells me he desperately needs the work done and that he will show up tomorrow, so I buy into his plan. What do I have to lose anyways?&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />Tomorrow rolls around, and I see his Neon pull into my garage's parking lot.&nbsp; He pulls the BMX bike out, and it is in awesome shape.&nbsp; I greet Frank and his girlfriend, both wearing tattered old clothes, and horrible looking teeth. They have multiple piercings and tattoos.&nbsp; The car's interior is covered in dirt, smoke haze, dog hair, and the car has 144k miles on it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Looks and prejudice aside, they were EXTREMELY polite and grateful as I explained what I will be doing to the car.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They walked down the road to a somewhat close Wendy's to grab a bite to eat while i fixed the car.&nbsp;&nbsp; I&nbsp; had the wheel bearing replaced in 30 minutes, and looked over the rest of the car.&nbsp; The other wheel bearing is starting to go bad too, but will hold up for awhile.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had told them it would take a couple hours though.&nbsp; These poor kids obviously did not have a pot to piss on.&nbsp; They may have, or still are addicted to drugs judging by the serious dental problems. Frank could not even afford to make or recieve phone calls to his phone.&nbsp; The BMX bike may even be stolen, but I found enough reason to believe it is not through conversation with him.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />Although these two kids looked like they been to hell and back, they looked very happy together. They just clicked.&nbsp; Hard to explain.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Since I finished the car so fast,&nbsp; I decided to do something nice for them.&nbsp; First I shop vac'd their interior.&nbsp; Then, I cleaned all of the vinyl and plastic with Armor All and some paper towels.&nbsp; <span style=""font-size: large;"">I also scraped the shoe polish numbers from the driver's side window that were put there by the impound lot the previous day.</span>&nbsp; When they came back, they looked like they had tears in their eyes when they saw how nice their car looked.&nbsp; I went over some other areas of concern with the car to them, and offered help in the future.&nbsp; After they left, I got 1 final text from Frank, thanking me again, and that he appreciates the work also saying he doesnt have much and its nice to know there are still cool people out there.&nbsp;&nbsp; By the sounds of that, he probably hasnt had good luck with friends either.&nbsp;&nbsp; I wish them the best of luck and hope they can pull themselves together and make it through life happy and safely"

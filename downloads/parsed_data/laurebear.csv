"event","Wow....it's been a long time. I've been looking over the last couple years worth of entries and I'm slapped in the face with the realization that I'm no longer that little girl. That child is gone, back to the wistful days of ponies and hair ribbons. In her place stands me -&nbsp; self-confident, successful young woman who is about to become engaged to the man of her dreams and stepping into the life God has planned for her. 

Alright, I'm not as amazing as that sentence makes me seem. I make mistakes all the time and I don't trust myself enough to believe that I can be good at something. But at least&nbsp;I can look back and be grateful for where I've been and ecstatic about where I'm going. I'm in love with the most amazing man in the entire world. I'm about to finish my last semester of college. I'm about to become engaged and continue planning my life with him. We're looking at houses. We're thinking about finances and children. 

That's it. I'm a grown up. 

As J.M. Barrie would say, &quot;Look at that. The (girl) is gone. Sometime in the last five seconds, you've become a grown-up.&quot;

Not everything is perfect. Debbie and John moved down to Georgia, and I've spoken to Debbie once in the last year. I still struggle with some old sins. I'm about to start planning a wedding, but I have no job...no car...no money...nothing of earthly value. 

But for the most part, my life is pretty amazing. 

I love Tommy. He loves me. Soon his ring will be on my finger, joining us together forever. 

I'm at a wonderful Christian college where I met my very best friend in the entire world, Alex. 

My faith has grown by leaps and bounds. I'm no longer the callous narrowminded Christian that is too prevalent in the world today. 

I still love Disney princesses and Alex and I have coloring parties every once in a while. 

I love my life. God has been so good. I'm under no illusions that the next years are going to be easy, but as long as I have Christ, Tommy, and my family, I know I'mgoing to be okay."

Debbie thought I was having an affair with her husband and has since broken off all contact. 

And...

I hate my youth group. 

My life is falling down around me.

"event","it's amazing...looking back and realizing where God had lead me....i mean...i think that I have everything figured out...HA!! that's such a joke! Whoever says they have life under control is completely blind to their surroundings....here's the best example...

Ive had this dream of growing up to marry a nice young christian guy and having nice Christian babies and blah blah blah...it was a great dream and i wanted it more than anything! anything! i wanted a family more than a career...more than money...more than anything! and for a while i was despairing over ever finding the right guy...and i was set on going to Messiah college simply to find a husband....i'm not kidding...

anyway...after the whole Joe fiasco and some drama with some other guys, i decided that it just wasn't worth it until God showed me the right guy. And i realized that in searching for that perfect guy i was putting God second in my life. i was making that perfect guy my idol. and i realized that it was wrong, So i swore off guys. first of all to keep me from getting hurt again and secondly to seriously strengthen my relationship with God.&nbsp; 

well, that stepping stone, which is one of the reasons i believe God let me go through that whole Joe thing, lead me to a small moment of prayer on Saturday night. and i distinctly felt God speak in my spirit and He told me to wait. Wait, He said. He spoke to me, and told me that i was going to get my dream. I was going to get that husband and that family and the house with the white picket fence. I would just have to wait. 

2-3 years? 5-6? He didn't say. But i got the feeling that it was going to be a while. God has a lot for me to do before He lets me get settled. And you know what's funny? I'm okay with it! In fact, i'm completely ok with it! I'm ecstatic! i CAN:T WAIT to see what God has in store for me....

it's amazing how God asked me to give up my biggest dream...a dream i never though id let go of...but He helped me realize that the only reason that i held onto that dream so steadfastly, was because i was afraid...i was afraid of having anything else....i didn't feel qualified to be in the real world so i thought i'd turn to the one thing that i knew...family life

but you know what? I am ready for the world and whatever it brings me because i have God right beside me....i'm gonna meet some bad times, some good times...i'm going to be unsure of myself and i'm going to face obstacles i don't think i can climb...but i know that ill survive and i'll succeed...God has something great in store...and i can't wait to see what it is!!"

She said that she's never had a student that started out taking English 205 that had such a command of the language that I have and how I haven't made any grammatical errors yet and i haven't used fragments wrong yet and how i'm just enjoyable. blah blah blah and then she toook me over to Iman, the lady who works with the writing center and one of the last things she said was, I wouldn't recommend anyone more. She's a fabulous writer. ANd before she was tlaking about how i have such talent, that you can't teach anyone to write well and that I have it...and it was just so cool!!!!!!!! AUGH!!! yaya....so i'm gonna be tutoring tues and thurs from 2:40 to 4:00 and getting paid 7:50 and hour. yay!!! it's just so cool and it makes me feel really good that someone is so interested in my writing.&nbsp;

"event","My life is so busy. I really can't complain, but sometimes, I feel so bogged down with responsibilties that I have no time to be who I am. Sunday I go to church, and I have to go because I'm the lead singer of the worship team. If they don't have me, we dont' have a worship team. We just have instruments. Monday I work and then jet to volleyball. Tuesday I go to school and then volleyball. Wednesday I go to work and then jet to volleyball. Thursday I have school, then volleyball, then i have to jet to worship practice. Friday I work then jet to volleyball and then jet to youth group. Saturday I work and then jet to worship practice and then I have church. And then sunday it starts all over again.&nbsp;

I don't have to time to be crazy or take risks. I don't have time to sit back and enjoy the sunset. I don't have time to hang out with my friends. I barely have time to do my homework. My room is never clean, i don't have time to learn to do layndry. I don't even have time to deposit me paychecks. My mom has to do that for me. AUGH!

I just want the freedom to be me. Yeah, yeah, I love volleyball and I enjoy my job and I have to go school in order to get anywhere in this life. But most of the time i feel like it's my duty to do those things. I HAVE&nbsp;to go to work to get paid so i can support myself. I HAVE to go to school to evolve in life. I HAVE to go to church twice a week cuz i sing. I HAVE TO!!!&nbsp;

Don't get me wrong. I love my life. I love singing, volleyball. I love it. But i haven't sat down and read a book in about a year. I don't write anymore. I don't have time to do the things i truly love. Everyone is always pushing me to be more than i am and to take on more responsibilties and i don't even know.&nbsp;

I just want to drop everything and run. Like Forrest Gump. Run cross country. Climb the Rocky Mountains. Tour the Gand Canyon. Visit a dude ranch in Montana. (sigh) i'm never going to get to do those things becaue my life is already planned out for me.&nbsp;

Will I ever get to see the Pacific Ocean? The Rocky Mountains? Will I ever kiss a boy? Will I ever get married? Will I ever get to make my own album? Write my own book? See my name in print? When will I get to decorate my own house? Run through a meadow and pick wild flowers?Stand at the top of a mountan and scream ""I'm the Queen of the World!""&nbsp;

I wish life would allow me to be free."

"event","(sigh) i wish corey would stop...just stop laying on these hints that he likes me...he knows how i feel...we're really close...we hang out all the time...but we're just friends...i don't see him as a potential love interest...not in a million years...i'm sorry...i love corey to death...but never in that way..

gosh it makes me feel so bad when he texts me saying 'morning beautiful', or this morning, my away message said 'i just want to wrap my arms around you and hug you forever', to no one in particular (it was actually something my mom said to me this morning and i thought it was so cute) and he sends me an im that says 'that can be arranged'...or when he talks about how he doesn't want to be just the guy friend anymore and how he wants to be the boyfriend....i feel so much pressure...i feel like i can't do certain things because he might take it the wrong way...and i feel like i have to do certain things so nothing gets out of hand and jeez i just want to be friends...i don't want to feel like i have to be something when i'm around him...i don't want to feel like i can't be myself...but in the last couple days...ive certainly felt like i can't talk about certain things, which was never a problem before....

idk...maybe i'm being insensitive to corey...i know how it feels to like someone who doesn't like me back...and he's had a rough life...i definately feel that God should give the poor guy a break...but idk...it's so awkward and just...

and then there's this whole thing with him potentially moving out to nebraska....like dude...corey can't leave!! he's one of my best friends!! who am i going to go to the movies with @ 9:30 at night? who's gonna argue with me about God? who's gonna keep me sane at work? who's going to...there's a lot of things corey and i do that i can't do with anyone else...

i feel like there's this fine thread in our relationship....on one half there's just us as friends, doing friend things and hanging out...but then on the other side...like to anyone who doesn't know us...it looks like we're dating...like...corey has even said himself that our relationship is like we're dating...we'll call each other at all hours of the night and talk for hours on end about nothing...we go to the movies...we go bowling...we've gone to get ice cream after work...i mean...seriously...to anyone on the outside lookinig in....we're going out...and sometimes i feel like that line is getting crossed....which needs to stop...

does any of what i'm saying make any sense? i wish i was talking to someone who could talk back....sometimes talking to another person keeps me on track...i'm kinda of rambling and i'm not sure i'm saying what i mean to say....(sigh) oh well...."

"event","<p>there are so many thoughts running through my head right now i can't even think straight.&nbsp;<br /><br />i'm surrounded by change, change that could be good or bad, depending on the outcome...but i am so sick of living in this shroud of change with only glimpses of the happiness that had once inhabited my every thought, my every action. Hardly anything is happy anymore. I don't look forward to anything anymore. School is the same. Even the challenge of a new semester is dulled by the change around me. I was happy for a moment when i my teacher told me she liked my writing. I was happy for a moment when i saw mrs. paisley. i was happy for a moment. but the second i got into the car again, i was reminded of leaving lomontville, leaving my second home, to go to a place where i don't fit.&nbsp;<br />if i had my way, everything would stay the same.&nbsp;<br />of course i know, change must happen. but does it have to happen so suddenly, and with such...force?<br /><br />this decision to leave the church had created so many problems. i have a bitterness toward some people because of what they did and said to my father. my friendships with debbie and john and jon and ashley and beth and charlie and stephanie are going to be so limited, and i've lived off of their relationships for so long, i don't kno if i'll be able to breathe without seeing them every sunday. that youth group and those relationships are my life. other than God of course. and of course he's the real reason we're leaving. we're leaving because we're not getting spiritually fed through our current pastor. i've watched it happen to so many people who have left our church. the relationships are never the same. you say that you'll keep in touch, but you never do. you say you'll call and write and email and visit and whatever else, but you don't. and the relationship slips away, almost as if it had never happened.&nbsp;<br /><br />no more sunrise bagels. no more early sunday mornings. no more worship practice. no more&nbsp;bible chapters. no more. no more.&nbsp;<br />God? What do you want me to do? What am i supposed to do? How am i supposed to feel?<br />I believe that You want me to go with my family. From the minutes Dad told me we were leaving, i believe that you've told me to go with my family to crosspoint. but does that mean you want me to forget lomontville? i've been involved for so long, and just when i thought things were really kicking off, you're asking me to leave? i'll go willingly, but God, i don't understand. i don't know why. i guess i will one day. but right now, i feel as if my heart is breaking a bit. and i'm scared because i don't fit in at crosspoint.&nbsp;<br /><br />i'm afraid.&nbsp;<br /><br />i don't want to be a grownup if it means giving up the things you love. but, Lord, i trust you, and i will do anything that you ask. i know that whatever you do is for the best, and will make me a better person. I just pray that you give me the strength and the wisdom as to how to deal with this situation in front of the people it's affecting most. please give me the strength, the determination, the discipline, to keep going forward, even though i don't want to. help me be a good witness for you. in all that i do i want to honor you, and sometimes that's really hard. please be with me, take my hand everytime i'm faced with temptation or hardship. i love you, lord, and i will worship you to the end of my days.&nbsp;<br />keep my mind free of trouble. help me to focus on the good, on what could happen, of what is coming. help me to keep a smile on my face and in my heart. and help me get rid of my bitterness. that doesn't belong in my heart and i want to get rid of it like chaff, burning it until it no longer exists. i want to be the best i can be, and the everything i can to further your kingdom. but i can't do it by myself. i'm a coward, i have no courage and i shy at the first sign of confrontation. i need you to be with me. please, cover me with your wings, keep me safe, keep me strong.&nbsp;<br />i love you, always..<br /><br />Amen. </p>"

The people there are more interested in how the church looks and about their reputations than about worshiping God. In all the church has lost its focus. And now Dad wants to leave.&nbsp;<br /><br />I don't want to leave, mainly for the Sunday School and the people. Sunday School is where i learn the most about God and where i can be myself and ask questions and know that i'm getting an honest answer. I love it. I'm not the youngest and i'm not the oldest. I have things to learn and I have things i can teach to others. It's the best hour and a half of my week. I would NEVER willingly leave such a thing. Debbie and John are my best friends, my mentors. Leaving Lomontville would be like moving to Florida. I would never see them. And what about Ashley and Jon? and Tracy? and Sarah? What about Stephanie and Matt and Dave? What about Steve and Jill and Holly and Noah? And Cindy? What about Beth and Nick and Zach and Alex? What about the worship team? What about little Aggie? They all mean so much to me. It would be like ripping off a part of me. I'm serious. Don't think I'm exaggerating.&nbsp;<br /><br />Half of my life is in Lomontville, from the Youth Group to the Children's Church to the Worship team to the kids i babysit. The message Pastor Doug preaches about never touches my heart. It's not about service. It's about the Sunday School and the relationships. I don't have to go to a Sunday morning service to learn about God. Sunday School IS my church service. I learn more in that one class than I could ever learn in a whole yearfull of Pastor Doug's teachings.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />I don't know what to do. If my parents leave Lomontville, it's most likely that i will leave to. But i won't leave willingly. We've been going to that church my entire life.&nbsp;<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, Crosspoint Fellowship is great, it's just...not my church. I don't know the people there. They don't know&nbsp;me. I don't want to take the time to get to know them. Pete's messages are great, aweinspiring, wonderful, and a whole barrel full of other complimentary words. But they don't touch me either. (shrug) i don't know. I just know that Dad wants to concentrate full time on Crosspoint.&nbsp;<br />But I'm eighteen. My opinions not only count, but they should be fully taken into consideration. I'm not saying i'm right or he's wrong or i'm wrong and he's right. I'm just saying that i wish Dad would give me a say in this.&nbsp;<br /><br />Either way, i don't want to leave Lomontville. It's my greatest spiritual...what's the word...school. That is where i learn the most. Without them, i really don't know what i'd do. Even without a week of Debbie and John, i feel depressed and lost almost. i know i need them. Taking that away...i think i'd cry for a very very long time.&nbsp;<br /><br />I don't know what to do. <br />~Lauren :(</p>"

"event","Dear Husband,

I've waited so long to finally call you by that name. But as I sit here writing this, I can't help but wonder...do we already know each other? Or are there unforseen circumstances that will bring us together? No matter how we meet, will it be love at first sight? Or must you win my heart? Better yet, must I win yours? 
Oh, how I want to know you and love you. I am ready and willing to give you my whole heart. My purity ring sits on my ring finger, a symbol. It is waiting for you, waiting for you to replace it with a ring of your own. 
I wonder what you are like. Are you compassionate toward those who are not as well off as you are? Do you have goals, and healthy ambitions to meet those goals? What church do you go to? Do you have any brothers or sisters? Where did you grow up? Do prefer living in the city or the country?
I can't wait for the day that you will look at me and tell me that you love me. I love you. In my daydreams you are only a faceless figure, but you are there, nonetheless, and I love you. The future looks bright when you are at my side. My only hope is that it won't take that long to secure that future. 
Like any love struck girl, I would love to have that white house with red shutters and a white picket fence lining our yard that is littered with flowers, with a swingset in the back yard for the kids. But...I must tell you...I don't need or even want any of those things as long as you are standing next to me. You are all I need.
Together we will weather life's storms. My hand will be firmly placed in yours. Yours and God's. I believe God has bless our union and our love is one that will span the ages. I'm only half a person. I need you to be my other half. I pray we meet soon, for I am anxious to meet you, to know you, to love you. 
I pray you'll wait for me too. For all we know, you and I don't exist, and we won't until we meet face to face. Hopefully, that day won't be long in coming. 
Just know, that I'm waiting for you. You are the only man I will ever love. I love you. 

I look forward to meeting you."

but i'm SOO nervous!! there are three guys going, two that I really like and one who really likes me, and i want to impress them, like the stupid girl that I am...but...what if someone asks me to dance?! I don't dance!! AT ALL!! (sigh)....and i guess, if what Katelyn says is right, there is a surprise coming for me and it's from a guy...whoo hoo...

no one understands that i'm trying to wait for the right guy...i want to get married and settle down, but they keep trying to set me up with all these non christian guys and like...trying to talk me out of not seeing them...idk...

part of me is soo terrified of the opposite sex...i think i'd rather sit in my room all alone that know that the guys don't like me...

but as the Chris Tomlin song goes...

""I want to live like there's no tomorrow
I want dance like no one's around
I want to sing like no body's listening
Before I lay my body down
I want to give like I have plenty
I want to love like I'm not afraid
I want to be the (woman) I was meant to be
I want to be the way I was made.""

But I am afraid, and I am scared....

I want to dance and sing and love and live like there's no tomorrow...but...i can't get it out of my head that there will be a tomorrow...

I'm not going to do anything stupid, although I am deathly afraid that I will...or...nevermind...I'm so afraid of disappointing my parents and I want to live above the influence, but at the same time I don't want that to get in the way of my friendships, as it has SOO many times in the past..

I guess it's just a catch 22...I either compromise to save a friendship, or stand firm in my faith and stand to lose that friendship...

I know that all things work out for the good of those who love the Lord and live according to his purpose...I forgot that with my Spring Schedule...

But I won't forget it this time!



Jesus, you kno the desires of my heart. You kno how badly I want to settle down and have a family. You even kno how badly I crave acceptance and attention even at the same time that I don't want it. My heart and head are all confused, Father. I'm not sure of the path you want me to take. I simply ask that you place friends and family in my way to either stop me or steer me. Or both. 
I love that you want the very best for me. I love that you kno how my life is going to play out. And I love knowing that you have everything under control. Please, help me to remember that as tomorrow pans out. Please, don't let me do anything stupid. I can deal with silly verbal and social inadequacies and mistakes. But I could never deal with disappointing my parents or those who love me. 
Let your angels surround me and everyone else at the party. Surround the drivers and cooks and waiters and guests. Please keep us safe. 
I praise you, forever and always. For your is the power, the glory, and the honor, forever. 

Amen




Well, now that God has everything under control (not that it wasn't ever not under his control)....let me say Adieu....and Good Night...Fare thee Well and Au Revior....

See Ya Later!!"

1) Christian
2) Good family relationships
3) Musician
4) Taller than me
41/2) Blue eyes
5) Good sense of humor
6) Sensitive
7) Parents must know him
8) Interested in a growing relationship with Christ
9) Ambitious
10) Aware of his faults and willing to fix them
Exactly who God wants me to be with for the rest of my life...

Okay, so i know this may be asking for a lot in this world, but I completely believe that this person is out there. I'm not saying they have to be perfect, just the perfect man for me. And as i was going through a longer version of this list the other day, i was wondering why, throughout my entire life, not ONE guy has ever really liked me enough to pursue a relationship. And then I thought, maybe that was God's way of telling me to take a look at what's right under my nose. 
Techinally, I grew up with Matt. I remember playing cops and robbers with him and Mark. and yet, it has only been recently, that i realized how perfectly he matches my list. Sure, we haven't really ever talked, but lately i've tried hard to connect with him, and I think it's working...we've been messaging back and forth. I even hugged him a couple Sundays ago. 
I want to believe this isnt coincidence (i'm not that i do, even), and that God has put these realizations and feelings here for a reason. The truth is, I've admire Matt for a good deal of time, but never thought about 'liking' him until i began to actually talk to him. now, i want sooo much more. At the same time, how do i know these feelings aren't there to distract me? how do I know this is all from God? or if it's the right path he wants me to take? 
More than anything in the world, I want to find my future husband and get married and start a family. I understand having a college degree to fall back on is important and yes, i'm all for that. But i want to have kids. I want to be in love for the rest of my life. i want to know what it is to be cherished and loved and just...treasured. 
I don't want to 'date'. I want to court. I want to get married. 
Maybe the one i've been looking for has been there all along, and i was too blinded too look. 
Or maybe this is all a girlhood fantasy...
I know there is someone out there for me...and i know God has a plan. and i'll listen if God says wait. 

Just...

God, I hope you don't make me wait too long."

Why is it that, out of the NUMEROUS guys I like...none of them are Christians and none of them even know i exist...??

Is God playing a trick on me? lol..i'm just kidding...
it's just that sometimes i get tired of waiting...but then i have to sit back and realize that...well...if i had a boyfriend right now, it would screw up EVERYTHING!! so i guess God knows what he's doing...

So...onto another subject...

Volleyball seaons...

I only have three games left...and out of the fifteen games we've played, I have only stepped onto the court in four of them...and in only three of them did I actually touch the ball...so much for a breakout volleyball season...

it's hard..i don't begrudge anyone their positions on the team...i mean without them, we never would have had a chance...but still...it hurts to think that i'm not good enough...i've never been not good enough...

and then there are people on the team who are like, Oh, man, coach took me out! why does he do that? I hate sitting the bench!

all i have to say is...well at least you got to play! i mean, for goodness sake! i would just be happy to step on the court and mess up!! but no, everyone has to go on and on and complain and make me feel even worse...

and coach...well coach is coach and i love him to death, but...i want to play! i hate being ""the team encourager""....what the hecK!

anyway...i hate to complain...but gosh darn it i want to play...i'm very competative and i can't stand it when people complain to my face, knowing that i never even get to touch the ball, much less spike it over the net...

(SIGH) but whatever...there is always next year..

sometimes i get so tired of being optomistic, of having 'good sportsmanship'...it's very tiring, especually when i just want to scream at the world to leave me alone...


anyway...
i'm tired...
i'm going to bed...

"event","The only thing i can possibly say about my upcoming graduation is ...YELP!! I'm so excited...but once the ceremony is over..where will that leave me? My invitations have been sent out, i have a dress, i have the shoes, i have the cap and gown....do i have any confidence in the future? NO!!

The only things i've ever known have been school...then more school...then more school....eight classes a day, six days a week, for thirteen years....Now i'm on my own to manage my time...manage my clothes...what am i doing???? i don't know...that's the problem...

Sure, i can write...i can sing...i've been to Europe...and my room is yellow...but how do those help me? I have no people skills...i'm not very articulate...and the only way i can make a speech is if i had it memorized....it takes me forever to learn something enough to have it stick...i hate change....i hate meeting new people...


LAUREN STOP IT

God has a plan for your life. He knew who you were going to be and what you were going to do before he began making with world. He knows what he's doing. Do you think he doesn't know how the story ends? His plan and his purpose are greater than anything we could ever imagine. Why are you fretting? God knows what's going to happen. Sure, you are going to fall. Sure, you are going to be embarrased, scratched up, torn, battered, bruised. But God loves you....

Do you doubt this?


(sigh)...i don't...not deep down...i'm just so...scared...


God loves you...and his plan is beginning to unfold. Let him work in you. 


AMEN"

I know I'm writing all of this, but i'm so...like...it doesn't seem real...i kno i paid $2,000 for this trip and i kno my suitcases are all packed and i know i have my passport and plane ticket...but i still don't believe I will be on my first plane tomorrow evening!! (sigh)

I feel so blank...

I can't figure out which books to bring...or how to fit in all the homework i have to bring...or...man...there's so much stuff to remember...i can't even imagine travling overseas like...for a living...

it does suck, tho, that i'm gonna have to miss four softball games because of this trip...i hope my team does well...

i wish..i weren't going...but i'm glad that i am...

it's a complicated emotion...

anyway...i have to go...we're loading up the car!!

see you in ten days!!"

"event","""When The Sand Runs Out""

I spent the morning at an old friend's grave
Flowers and Amazing Grace, he was a good man
He spent his whole life spinnin' his wheels
Never knowin' how the real thing feels
He never took a chance or took the time to dance
And I stood there thinking as I said goodbye
Today is the first day of the rest of my life

I'm gonna stop lookin' back and start movin' on
And learn how to face my fears
Love with all of my heart, make my mark
I wanna leave something here

Go out on a ledge, with out any net
That's what I'm gonna be about
Yeah I wanna be runnin'
When the sand runs out

'Cause people do it everyday
Promise themselves they're gonna change
I've been there, but I'm changin' from the inside out

That was then and this is now
I'm a new man, yeah, I'm a brand new man
And when they carve my stone they'll write these words
""Here lies a man who lived life for all that its worth""

And as the cold wind blows across the graveyard
I think I hear the voice of my old friend whisper in my ear

I'm gonna stop lookin' back and start movin' on
Learn how to face my fears
Love with all of my heart, make my mark
I wanna leave something here

Go out on a ledge, with out any net
That's what I'm gonna be about
Yeah I wanna be runnin'
When the sand runs out"

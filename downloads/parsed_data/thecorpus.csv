"event","I think it stirred up a lot of nostalgia about coming together with like-minded friends and working towards making something impossible possible not for us but for the greater good.

where did all that youth go?

reading the message from the director of metropolitan productions also reminded me of making an idea, a dream into reality and &nbsp;bringing a story, a message to life.

where did all the passion go?

perhaps I&#39;m fighting for something different these days. &nbsp;or am I just struggling to keep my head above the water?"

1 Peter 1:13 Therefore, with minds that are alert and fully sober, set your hope on the grace to be brought to you when Jesus Christ is revealed at his coming. 14 As obedient children, do not conform to the evil desires you had when you lived in ignorance. 15 But just as he who called you is holy, so be holy in all you do; 16 for it is written: &lsquo;Be holy, because I am holy.&rsquo; 17 Since you call on a Father who judges each person&rsquo;s work impartially, live out your time as foreigners here in reverent fear. 18 For you know that it was not with perishable things such as silver or gold that you were redeemed from the empty way of life handed down to you from your ancestors, 19 but with the precious blood of Christ, a lamb without blemish or defect. 20 He was chosen before the creation of the world, but was revealed in these last times for your sake. 21 Through him you believe in God, who raised him from the dead and glorified him, and so your faith and hope are in God.&nbsp;22 Now that you have purified yourselves by obeying the truth so that you have sincere love for each other, love one another deeply, from the heart. 23 For you have been born again, not of perishable seed, but of imperishable, through the living and enduring word of God. 24 For,&nbsp;&lsquo;All people are like grass, and all their glory is like the flowers of the field; the grass withers and the flowers fall, 25 but the word of the Lord endures for ever.&rsquo; And this is the word that was preached to you."

I never could understand why LKY cried when he announced separation, until today. Not that I cried or was even close to tears. Nor that the reasons behind the emotions are the same or even similar to that of 1965.

But it is the end of an era. Dramatically speaking. We will truly have nothing more to do with one another even as we are so very similar and so very different. 

Despite the challenges, limitations, and differences, there was some beauty and synergy in the archaic union and exchange. And I suppose it were the challenges, limitations and differences that made the triumphs and occasional harmony all the more sweet.

Even with the nostalgia, I cannot bear to hashtag rememberingkclmss (or any hashtags for that matter) or posting this on FB cos that would just be too...

I will remember those days fondly. They are light years away."

"event","1 Therefore, when the Lord knew that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John 2 (though Jesus Himself did not baptize, but His disciples), 3 He left Judea and departed again to Galilee. 4 <b>But He needed to go through Samaria. </b>5 So He came to a city of Samaria which is called Sychar, near the plot of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph. 6 Now Jacob&#39;s well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied from His journey, sat thus by the well. It was about the sixth hour. 7 A woman of Samaria came to draw water. Jesus said to her, &quot;Give Me a drink.&quot; 8 For His disciples had gone away into the city to buy food. 9 Then the woman of Samaria said to Him, &quot;How is it that You, being a Jew, ask a drink from me, a Samaritan woman?&quot; For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans. 10 Jesus answered and said to her, &quot;If you knew the gift of God, and who it is who says to you, &#39;Give Me a drink,&#39; you would have asked Him, and He would have given you living water.&quot; 11 The woman said to Him, &quot;Sir, You have nothing to draw with, and the well is deep. Where then do You get that living water? 12 Are You greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well, and drank from it himself, as well as his sons and his livestock?&quot; 13 Jesus answered and said to her, &quot;Whoever drinks of this water will thirst again, 14 but whoever drinks of the water that I shall give him will never thirst. <b>But the water that I shall give him will become in him a fountain of water springing up into everlasting life.</b>&quot; 15 The woman said to Him, &quot;Sir, give me this water, that I may not thirst, nor come here to draw.&quot; 16 Jesus said to her, &quot;Go, call your husband, and come here.&quot; 17 The woman answered and said, &quot;I have no husband.&quot; Jesus said to her, &quot;You have well said, &#39;I have no husband,&#39; 18 for you have had five husbands, and the one whom you now have is not your husband; in that you spoke truly.&quot; 19 The woman said to Him, &quot;Sir, I perceive that You are a prophet. 20 Our fathers worshiped on this mountain, and you Jews say that in Jerusalem is the place where one ought to worship.&quot; 21 Jesus said to her, &quot;Woman, believe Me, the hour is coming when you will neither on this mountain, nor in Jerusalem, worship the Father. 22 You worship what you do not know; we know what we worship, for salvation is of the Jews. 23 <b>But the hour is coming, and now is, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth; for the Father is seeking such to worship Him.</b> 24 <b>God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truth.</b>&quot; 25 The woman said to Him, &quot;I know that Messiah is coming&quot; (who is called Christ). &quot;When He comes, He will tell us all things.&quot; 26 Jesus said to her, &quot;<b>I who speak to you am He.</b>&quot;

27 And at this point His disciples came, and they marveled that He talked with a woman; yet no one said, &quot;What do You seek?&quot; or, &quot;Why are You talking with her?&quot; 28 The woman then left her waterpot, went her way into the city, and said to the men, 29 &quot;Come, see a Man who told me all things that I ever did. Could this be the Christ?&quot; 30 Then they went out of the city and came to Him. 31 In the meantime His disciples urged Him, saying, &quot;Rabbi, eat.&quot; 32 But He said to them, &quot;I have food to eat of which you do not know.&quot; 33 Therefore the disciples said to one another, &quot;Has anyone brought Him anything to eat?&quot; 34 Jesus said to them, &quot;My food is to do the will of Him who sent Me, and to finish His work. 35 Do you not say, &#39;There are still four months and then comes the harvest&#39;? Behold, I say to you, lift up your eyes and look at the fields, for they are already white for harvest! 36 And he who reaps receives wages, and gathers fruit for eternal life, that both he who sows and he who reaps may rejoice together. 37 For in this the saying is true: &#39;One sows and another reaps.&#39; 38 <i><b>I sent you to reap that for which you have not labored; others have labored, and you have entered into their labors.</b></i>&quot; 39 And many of the Samaritans of that city believed in Him because of the word of the woman who testified, &quot;He told me all that I ever did.&quot; 40 So when the Samaritans had come to Him, they urged Him to stay with them; and He stayed there two days. 41 And many more believed because of His own word. 42 Then they said to the woman, &quot;<b>Now we believe, not because of what you said, for we ourselves have heard Him and we know that this is indeed the Christ, the Savior of the world.</b>&quot;

43 Now after the two days He departed from there and went to Galilee. 44 For Jesus Himself testified that a prophet has no honor in his own country. 45 So when He came to Galilee, the Galileans received Him, having seen all the things He did in Jerusalem at the feast; for they also had gone to the feast. 46 So Jesus came again to Cana of Galilee where He had made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman whose son was sick at Capernaum. 47 When he heard that Jesus had come out of Judea into Galilee, he went to Him and implored Him to come down and heal his son, for he was at the point of death. 48 Then Jesus said to him, &quot;Unless you people see signs and wonders, you will by no means believe.&quot; 49 The nobleman said to Him, &quot;Sir, come down before my child dies!&quot; 50 Jesus said to him, &quot;Go your way; your son lives.&quot; So the man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him, and he went his way. 51 And as he was now going down, his servants met him and told him, saying, &quot;Your son lives!&quot; 52 Then he inquired of them the hour when he got better. And they said to him, &quot;Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.&quot; 53 So the father knew that it was at the same hour in which Jesus said to him, &quot;Your son lives.&quot; <b>And he himself believed, and his whole household. </b>54 This again is the second sign Jesus did when He had come out of Judea into Galilee."

2 Bless the LORD, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits, 
3 who forgives all your iniquity, who heals all your diseases, 
4 who redeems your life from the pit, who crowns you with steadfast love and mercy, 
5 who satisfies you with good so that your youth is renewed like the eagle's. 
6 The LORD works righteousness and justice for all who are oppressed. 
7 He made known his ways to Moses, his acts to the people of Israel. 
8 The LORD is merciful and gracious, slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love. 
9 He will not always chide, nor will he keep his anger forever. 
10 He does not deal with us according to our sins, nor repay us according to our iniquities. 
11 For as high as the heavens are above the earth, so great is his steadfast love toward those who fear him; 
12 as far as the east is from the west, so far does he remove our transgressions from us. 
13 As a father shows compassion to his children, so the LORD shows compassion to those who fear him. 
14 For he knows our frame; he remembers that we are dust. 
15 As for man, his days are like grass; he flourishes like a flower of the field; 
16 for the wind passes over it, and it is gone, and its place knows it no more. 
17 But the steadfast love of the LORD is from everlasting to everlasting on those who fear him, and his righteousness to children's children, 
18 to those who keep his covenant and remember to do his commandments. 
19 The LORD has established his throne in the heavens, and his kingdom rules over all. 
20 Bless the LORD, O you his angels, you mighty ones who do his word, obeying the voice of his word! 
21 Bless the LORD, all his hosts, his ministers, who do his will! 
22 Bless the LORD, all his works, in all places of his dominion. Bless the LORD, O my soul!

Lift up your voice like a trumpet;
Tell My people their transgression,
And the house of Jacob their sins.
2 Yet they seek Me daily,
And delight to know My ways,
As a nation that did righteousness,
And did not forsake the ordinance of their God.
They ask of Me the ordinances of justice;
They take delight in approaching God.
3 &lsquo;Why have we fasted,&rsquo; they say, &lsquo;and You have not seen?
Why have we afflicted our souls, and You take no notice?&rsquo;
&ldquo;In fact, in the day of your fast you find pleasure,
And exploit all your laborers.
4 Indeed you fast for strife and debate,
And to strike with the fist of wickedness.
You will not fast as you do this day,
To make your voice heard on high.
5 Is it a fast that I have chosen,
A day for a man to afflict his soul?
Is it to bow down his head like a bulrush,
And to spread out sackcloth and ashes?
Would you call this a fast,
And an acceptable day to the Lord?
6 &ldquo;Is this not the fast that I have chosen:
To loose the bonds of wickedness,
To undo the heavy burdens,
To let the oppressed go free,
And that you break every yoke?
7 Is it not to share your bread with the hungry,
And that you bring to your house the poor who are cast out;
When you see the naked, that you cover him,
And not hide yourself from your own flesh?
8 Then your light shall break forth like the morning,
Your healing shall spring forth speedily,
And your righteousness shall go before you;
The glory of the Lord shall be your rear guard.
9 Then you shall call, and the Lord will answer;
You shall cry, and He will say, &lsquo;<b>Here I am</b>.&rsquo;
&ldquo;If you take away the yoke from your midst,
The pointing of the finger, and speaking wickedness,
10 If you extend your soul to the hungry
And satisfy the afflicted soul,
Then your light shall dawn in the darkness,
And your darkness shall be as the noonday.
11 The Lord will guide you continually,
And satisfy your soul in drought,
And strengthen your bones;
You shall be like a watered garden,
And like a spring of water, whose waters do not fail.
12 Those from among you
Shall build the old waste places;
You shall raise up the foundations of many generations;
And you shall be called the Repairer of the Breach,
The Restorer of Streets to Dwell In.
13 &ldquo;If you turn away your foot from the Sabbath,
From doing your pleasure on My holy day,
And call the Sabbath a delight,
The holy day of the Lord honorable,
And shall honor Him, not doing your own ways,
Nor finding your own pleasure,
Nor speaking your own words,
14 Then you shall delight yourself in the Lord;
And I will cause you to ride on the high hills of the earth,
And feed you with the heritage of Jacob your father.
The mouth of the Lord has spoken.&rdquo;"

17 For the law was given through Moses, but grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.
18 No one has seen God at any time. The only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him."

"event","1 Brothers, my heart's desire and prayer to God for them is that they may be saved.
2 For I bear them witness that they have a zeal for God, but not according to knowledge.
3 For, being ignorant of the righteousness of God, and seeking to establish their own, they did not submit to God's righteousness.
4 For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes.
5 For Moses writes about the righteousness that is based on the law, that the person who does the commandments shall live by them.
6 But the righteousness based on faith says, ""Do not say in your heart, 'Who will ascend into heaven?'"" (that is, to bring Christ down)
7 ""or 'Who will descend into the abyss?'"" (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead).
8 But what does it say? ""The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart"" (that is, the word of faith that we proclaim);
9 because, if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.
10 For with the heart one believes and is justified, and with the mouth one confesses and is saved.
11 For the Scripture says, ""Everyone who believes in him will not be put to shame.""
12 For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek; for the same Lord is Lord of all, bestowing his riches on all who call on him.
13 For ""everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.""
14 How then will they call on him in whom they have not believed? And how are they to believe in him of whom they have never heard? And how are they to hear without someone preaching?
15 And how are they to preach unless they are sent? As it is written, ""How beautiful are the feet of those who preach the good news!""
16 But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Isaiah says, ""Lord, who has believed what he has heard from us?""
17 So faith comes from hearing, and hearing through the word of Christ.
18 But I ask, have they not heard? Indeed they have, for ""Their voice has gone out to all the earth, and their words to the ends of the world."" 
19 But I ask, did Israel not understand? First Moses says, ""I will make you jealous of those who are not a nation; with a foolish nation I will make you angry."" 
20 Then Isaiah is so bold as to say, ""I have been found by those who did not seek me; I have shown myself to those who did not ask for me."" 
21 But of Israel he says, ""All day long I have held out my hands to a disobedient and contrary people."""

That gives me strength for every passing day;
A glimpse of glory now revealed in meagre part,
Yet drives all doubt away:
I stand in Christ, with sins forgiven;
And Christ in me, the hope of heaven!
My highest calling and my deepest joy,
To make His will my home.

There is a hope that lifts my weary head,
A consolation strong against despair,
That when the world has plunged me in its deepest pit,
I find the Saviour there!
Through present sufferings, future's fear,
He whispers 'courage' in my ear.
For I am safe in everlasting arms,
And they will lead me home.

There is a hope that stands the test of time,
That lifts my eyes beyond the beckoning grave,
To see the matchless beauty of a day divine
When I behold His face!
When sufferings cease and sorrows die,
And every longing satisfied.
Then joy unspeakable will flood my soul,
For I am truly home


For family. For work. For mandarin ministry. For Pakistan."

I can&#39;t wait for his book to be out to consider what he&#39;s saying with lesser chance of hearing / understanding him wrong. &nbsp;But some of the things he said left question marks and exclamation marks on my paper. &nbsp;Much food for thought indeed.

last week I went with my bro to bidadari (which is all fenced and boarded up) and almost squashed a baby squirrel as I sped down the slope, which I couldn&#39;t cycle up. &nbsp;i&#39;m going to miss bidadari. &nbsp;it was lovely sitting and hearing the leaves dance.

but just didn&#39;t mention an overhead bridge. &nbsp;he just said straight down the canal. &nbsp;so I got a shock when I arrived at braddell road and there was no way to the other side. until I followed the signs and got to the overhead bridge and thought there must be a slope or something. nope. and no traffic light junctions. &nbsp;so I had to carry my bike which weighs 13kg (it felt like more. quite ridiculous apparently) and is bigger than me up and down the stairs. &nbsp;just said, why didn&#39;t you roll it? &nbsp;0.0 no wonder the guy at the shop said I should cycle with guys. i did it myself anyway. not without a cut and a bruise (don&#39;t ask me how. in addition to the bruises on both knees, huge abrasion/gash on one knee and smaller abrasions on my hands and other knee this last week).

otherwise, it was a lovely ride.

i decided to go home by the main road to after the overhead bridge instead, so that i didn&#39;t have to carry the bike in the dark (or at all). but there was soooo much construction (and traffic lights). &nbsp;sigh.

otherwise, it was awesome to cycle as a way to commute.

my brother took the bus. &nbsp;i was faster than him all of three traffic light junctions."

when they are &quot;bad&quot;, they deliver news I do not want to receive in reality (or reveal my idols). &nbsp;especially this morning&#39;s.

when they are &quot;good&quot;, they usually reveal my fallen-ness, depravity, sinfulness and idolatry.

on only a few occasions, have I seen the beauty, glory and sweetness of reconciliation and fellowship.

it&#39;s good and bad that my recollection of my dreams are usually a blur even though they were so vivid when asleep.

stripping any facade to its core helps me to know what I truly need to repent of or what I need to pray for so it doesn&#39;t happen, God willing.

but it leaves a stain, which can and should be purified, if I let it go and stop nailing Jesus to the cross (some 2000 years ago).

I have been praying to commit my dreams to God, and for God to guard them that I do not sin against Him in my sleep. &nbsp;I ought to pray more consistently for this.

2 Corinthians 10: 4 For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty in God for pulling down strongholds, 5 casting down arguments and every high thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of God, bringing every thought into captivity to the obedience of Christ, 6 and being ready to punish all disobedience when your obedience is fulfilled.

...

yesterday, we discussed about the already &amp; not yet. &nbsp;of the joy, frustration &amp; hope. &nbsp;of its implications on the now. &nbsp;of the anticipation of the age to come.

2 Corinthians 4
The Light of Christ&rsquo;s Gospel
Therefore, since we have this ministry, as we have received mercy, we do not lose heart. 2 But we have renounced the hidden things of shame, not walking in craftiness nor handling the word of God deceitfully, but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man&rsquo;s conscience in the sight of God. 3 But even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those who are perishing, 4 whose minds the god of this age has blinded, who do not believe, lest the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine on them. 5 For we do not preach ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord, and ourselves your bondservants for Jesus&rsquo; sake. 6 For it is the God who commanded light to shine out of darkness, who has shone in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.

<span style=""line-height: 1.4;"">Cast Down but Unconquered</span>
7 But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellence of the power may be of God and not of us. 8 We are hard-pressed on every side, yet not crushed; we are perplexed, but not in despair; 9 persecuted, but not forsaken; struck down, but not destroyed&mdash; 10 always carrying about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our body. 11 For we who live are always delivered to death for Jesus&rsquo; sake, that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our mortal flesh. 12 So then death is working in us, but life in you.

<span style=""line-height: 1.4;"">13 And since we have the same spirit of faith, according to what is written, &ldquo;I believed and therefore I spoke,&rdquo;[a] we also believe and therefore speak, 14 knowing that He who raised up the Lord Jesus will also raise us up with Jesus, and will present us with you. 15 For all things are for your sakes, that grace, having spread through the many, may cause thanksgiving to abound to the glory of God.</span>

<span style=""line-height: 1.4;"">Seeing the Invisible</span>
16 Therefore we do not lose heart. Even though our outward man is perishing, yet the inward man is being renewed day by day. 17 For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, is working for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory, 18 while we do not look at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen. For the things which are seen are temporary, but the things which are not seen are eternal."

I am thankful to have been able to watch Ben C as the Creature in the NT Live screening and I&#39;m looking forward to watching Jonny L Miller as the Creature but so much regret in not watching it LIVE. &nbsp;I remember walking down waterloo bridge and seeing the NT&#39;s flashing light of NOW PLAYING: FRANKENSTEIN.  

But I think I might have been frightened out of my wits to watch it LIVE. &nbsp;A screening brings some distant comfort though I am still very disturbed.

How could an 18-20 year old female imagine and write this at that time?

And I am turning 25.

the set was really stunning and it&#39;s so sad to not see the play in its entirety and in its space as it is staged but with strange (but sometimes aptly beautiful) aerial views / close ups etc.

am reminded a little of war horse. 

I do miss London so.&nbsp;&nbsp;"

"event","Ephesians 2:1 And you He made alive, who were dead in trespasses and sins, 2 in which you once walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit who now works in the sons of disobedience, 3 among whom also we all once conducted ourselves in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, just as the others. 4 <i><u>But God</u></i>, who is rich in mercy, because of His great love with which He loved us, 5 even when we were dead in trespasses, made us alive together with Christ (by grace you have been saved), 6 and raised us up together, and made us sit together in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus, 7 that in the ages to come He might show the exceeding riches of His grace in His kindness toward us in Christ Jesus. <b>8 For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God, 9 <u>not of works</u>, lest anyone should boast. 10 For we are <u>His workmanship</u>, created in Christ Jesus <u>for good works</u>, which God prepared beforehand that we should walk in them.</b> 11 Therefore remember that you, once Gentiles in the flesh--who are called Uncircumcision by what is called the Circumcision made in the flesh by hands-- 12 that at that time you were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel and strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope and without God in the world. 13 But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far off have been brought near by the blood of Christ. 14 For He Himself is our peace, who has made both one, and has broken down the middle wall of separation, 15 having abolished in His flesh the enmity, that is, the law of commandments contained in ordinances, so as to create in Himself one new man from the two, thus making peace, 16 and that He might reconcile them both to God in one body through the cross, thereby putting to death the enmity. 17 And He came and preached peace to you who were afar off and to those who were near. 18 For through Him we both have access by one Spirit to the Father. 19 Now, therefore, you are no longer strangers and foreigners, but fellow citizens with the saints and members of the household of God, 20 having been built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ Himself being the chief corner stone, 21 in whom the whole building, being joined together, grows into a holy temple in the Lord, 22 in whom you also are being built together for a dwelling place of God in the Spirit.

Rock of Ages, cleft for me,
let me hide myself in thee;
let the water and the blood,
from thy wounded side which flowed,
be of sin the double cure;
save from wrath and make me pure.

<i>Not the labours of my hands
can fulfil thy law&#39;s demands;
could my zeal no respite know,
could my tears forever flow,
all for sin could not atone;
thou must save, and thou alone

Nothing in my hand I bring,
simply to the cross I cling;
naked, come to thee for dress;
helpless, look to thee for grace;
foul, I to the fountain fly;
wash me, Savior, or I die.</i>

While I draw this fleeting breath, 
when mine eyes shall close in death, 
when I soar to worlds unknown, 
see thee on thy judgment throne, 
Rock of Ages, cleft for me, 
let me hide myself in thee."

The Lord is my shepherd;
I shall not want.
2&nbsp;He makes me to lie down in green pastures;
He leads me beside the still waters.
3 He restores my soul;
He leads me in the paths of righteousness
For His name&#39;s sake.

4 Yea, though I walk through
the valley of the shadow of death,
I will fear no evil;
For You are with me;
Your rod and Your staff,
they comfort me

5 You prepare a table before me
in the presence of my enemies;
You anoint my head with oil;
My cup runs over.

6 Surely goodness and mercy shall <b><i>pursue</i></b> me
All the days of my life;
And I will dwell in the house of the Lord
Forever."

"event","60 seconds changes
Many ""things"" can happen
In 60 seconds
sometimes to the better
sometimes to the worse
in 60 seconds
the man of my dreams
could kiss me
his lips pressed
upon my lips
and everything more
everything a girl could have
dreamed
is now reality
my crush
is no longer
a crush
he is mine
on the other hand
in these 60 seconds
""things"" could change
for the worse
my crush
the man of my dreams 
could
be my worse nightmare
his sweet warm 
as coffee
but
rich as chocolate
brown eyes
that i fell 
in love with
are not the same
in these 60 seconds
his eyes have
turned into something
less warm and sweet
something so cold
so careless
not caring of me
nor anyone else
around him
when I look into his eyes
I don't see what i
fell in love with
there is nothing
nothing at all
no passion
no zeal
Many ""things"" can happen 
in 60 seconds
sometimes to the better
sometime to the worse 
in 60 seconds"

"event","it is 12:55 pm and i have to be at work at 4 which just sucks out the ass because i have the night not to myself. i am working up at trackside today and thursday. the rest of the week i am working at traderbakers.  i really hate working at trackside cuz the new owner is a bitch.  i didn't know i had to claim my tips, so i didn't get my check.  i will get my check on saturday or friday. i dunno i just think she is really shady and i don't like her at all. her husband on the other hand is not that bad of a person. he is laid back pretty cool doesn't really have a lot to say but norma always does which is part of the reason i don't like her.  well i need to get off and wash some clothes. peace out~ in brittany's way~"

"event","hey its me!! for yall who don't know me, my name is walmart. I got this name from drinking........DON'T DRINK. it is about 1:00am and i have school at 8:30 today which kinda sux. i didn't have a good day at all today because, i didn't go to school today and i was an hour and 20mins late for work.  I didn't wake up until 3 pm today. which now i can not sleep. all i want to do talk to this hot guy i met on sat. night.  wow his so fuckin hot.  and to top it off he is a sweety too.  double bonus.  okay herez how it went down: i went ova to one of friendz house and this guy was ova there.  and he asked me if i wanted to go to some party in henry co. with him. and of course i said yes. the person i was with didn't like the idea that she was going to be around a bunch of drunk ppl all night but she went aways. the guy that wanted us to go to the party didn't really know whoz party it was. bc he was invited by his friend so they were going to meet us at some gas station in henry county. when we got there, the people who were having the party were racist. not a very good thing to be around when you are black.  i was pissed. i told him and my friend that i didn't want to go.  and he was like we will go for a second and if anyone says anything i will say something cuz ur my gurl. i brought u here and i will handle it. well when we got there we got in the back of this truck and road down in the woods. and my friend was seating in my lap, the whole time. her pants got stuck to my jeans and riped my jeans. and when we got to the spot it was more like a bunch of preppy and redneck bitchs. we left right away.  well, anywayz i really want to make a trip ova to walmart with this guy.  well i am out. oh for the record:
if i run my mouth it will be to your face, 
if i don't like you, you will know it.
i am not having a baby
i do drink
i do smoke
nothing else
if you don't like
you can get ova it and kiss my ass.
jessi aka walmart"

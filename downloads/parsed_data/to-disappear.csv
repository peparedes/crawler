so they gave me an upgrade.  and the phone i was going to get is the boulder. which is supposed to not die.  and then those jackasses decided to jack up the price $120.  i mean really.  really.  so why not get another shitty phone that will die in a year.  thats what i really want to do.  fuck you verizon.

also there are no jobs as all of any kind in rochester.  i mean no jobs.

"event","i had a dream.

i was in an ultra relaxed military of some kind.

we have uniforms and packs.  but not really packs.  i dont know what we did.  but we had mismatched uniforms and the pack i already have.  we lived in bunks.  and there were as many women and girls as men.

i had a dream while i was there and i told my partner/girlfriend/the girl in the bunk above me about it. here is the dream:

i went to an african/wildwest/third world country.  because my family was there or work there or missionaries or something. anyway.  i was there.

and i was going somewhere and ran into the wrong people.  and i ended up getting chased and stabbed.  they had attempted to kill me for something i saw.

so i ran to the medical/police station.  i got fixed up and was being walked out by my dad.  when a man ran up and shot and killed me. thats when the dream ended i told her.  

she said it was weird and asked if i was still going.  i said yeah i told them i would visit so there really was no reason not to.  then we rushed to join our group and we were discharged.

so i went to visit.  and the dream started.  i saw the guy coming to stab me and i knew i needed to change something.  so i hid on my way to medical place.  i only talked to the nurse/doctor there and told him i needed to get away or they would kill me.  so i ran away into the woods and got to my car and drove to the airport.  

we had agreeded that i would leave the airport in JFK and forget my connecting flight.  I would ditch my bags and my life and not return home.  i would vanish.  i would stay on the move and disappear for a while.  

i went off in search of my partner.  i did not know where to find her exactly.  i could not access anything.  and had to leave my cellphone behind.  

i started on an american adventure with nothing but my pack and girl i needed to find.

weird dream."

also when i travel.  i will travel and play and music.  and rock and things.  and be.

i have been debating whether i want to be painfully beautiful.  or so harsh its offensive.

also why didn't darth vader look for his father before?

so i think that love makes a lot of people stupid.  and blind.

there is a fine line between love and obsession.  and love and wanting to bang.

guilt is a powerful force.  if you feel guilty then you are guilty.  if you don't good for you.

we met in the sketchy bar.  it was mostly in black and white, but she wore a red dress.  like a wealthy woman.  she smoked and sipped on a drink.  

then the next night i presented proof the job was done and she paid me.  she kissed me good night and i walked out into the rain.

its a trap!!!!

"event","I used to dream that I could fly
Just above the whispered clouds, beneath the somber sky
I had a dream I was alive
I dreamt that love would never die, goodbye
Dreams were cheap and hope was easy (so light)
The forgeries of life deceiving (so bright)
And as I glided to the ground (so long)
Calcified, the concrete weighed me down (cruel world)

Your wings are holding up the sky
Dear God, I had dreamt that I could fly

Alkaline the burning frost, has blistered deep beneath my bones
And winter spat its hatred, cold and coiled, black and deep
As it called me ever further, where evil burns and never sleeps
I once had prayers that found no words, fragile things I've never spoken
Through my lips passed eulogies for all the oaths that I have broken
And still the ghost of hope was haunting, through the dark to save the living
And still beneath it all I dreamt that God could be forgiving

Your wings are holding up the sky
Dear God, I dreamt that I could fly

When I survey the wondrous cross
On which the Prince of glory died
My richest gain I count but loss
And pour contempt on all my pride

I am the worst of all things here
My crooked, black, and lying heart still spits its bitter fear
And each and every sparrow
They flutter to the ground before they die
So please God don't forget me

''I have been with you all along, you have not noticed me.'
Nervosa now felt more ashamed than ever before.
'Why would you still care enough to save me
even after seeing the horrible things I have done?
Why do you remain here even now?' She asked, sobbing.
'Because, here is where you are,' the Lamb said softly,
'And I long to be with you.''

See from His head, His hands, His feet
Sorrow and love flow mingled down
Did e'er such love and sorrow meet
Or thorns compose so rich a crown?
To Christ, who won for sinners' grace
By bitter grief and anguish sore
Be praise from all the ransomed race
Forever and forevermore"

here is the thing.  i am anti israeli.  and i know that. 

here is one of the things that historians don't talk about.

the holocaust which was not entirely against the jews is believe by a lot of zionists to be be against them.  

so when israel was created by the UN, weapons were given to the jews.  These weapons were not used for defense, but instead for systematic geneocide against the palistinians.  and the world turned a blind eye.

i mean really honestly what the hell?

also the nazis were not monsters.  they were people like you and i who had the chance to do great evil.

man's heart has the potential for great evil.  inside everyone is a murderer and rapist.  who is to say you would not do the same if you were there.

the power to take a human life is intoxicating.

after a few it just becomes a job.

I've been recording them ever since I was seventeen
Push playback then rewind
I see us meeting for the very first time

A mental note of you, you sang my melody
First bar in a lifelong symphony
The prelude to a kiss
My heart's pounding when I reminisce


Press repeat
'Cause I want to see


The first time that I saw your face
The first time that you spoke my name
The first time that I heard you say
There's a first time with me everyday

The first time that I felt your touch
The first time I couldn't get enough


Another memory, when you first looked at me
I hit pause and then love hit me back
Under attack stopped me in my tracks
There you go again, your eyes gave me a flashback

Remember that time, we stayed up all night
I swear we danced until we saw daylight
Step by step and frame by frame
Slow motion, let me see you again


Press repeat
'Cause I have to see


The first time that I saw your face

The first time I couldn't get enough
The first time that I heard you say
There's a first time with me everyday

I won't fast forward anything with you
I know you feel it too
The first time I saw love I was with you


The first time that I saw your face
The first time that you spoke my name
The first time when we talked all night
Was the first time love made sense in life

The first time that I felt your touch
The first time I couldn't get enough
The first time that I heard you say
There's a first time with me everyday"

However it has also made clear the racial inequality in America, and the racial tensions and preference which still control people's actions.  This has been made clear by the media's attention to the race and proclamations of the ""First Black President,"" which in itself is a highly racist statement.  Also voting which is based on racial bias, as apposed to education and political ideals is an example continuing racism in the United States.

First let me address the salutation of ""The First Black President.""  This highly racist statement is a product of racial in equality and racist thinking on both sides.  To show what I mean I will discuss a phrase, which has been ingrained into the mind of people of all ""races.""  This ""One-Drop Rule,"" is an understanding of white racial superiority which was transfered into legislation in the early 1900s in the United States.  The basic concept is that even a small amount of African heritage was enough to pollute a person, there by making them no longer white.  This applied even to people who had the same skin color as whites.  One reason for this understanding was due to horny slave owners who had children from African slaves.  Racism and the ""One-Drop"" definition served as a protect for ""pure-breed"" children, as opposed to their ""half-breed"" siblings.

This practice is being carried on today by people of all different ethnic backgrounds.  President-Elect Obama is not the product of two African parents, but rather the product of an African Father and a White-American Mother.  For lack of a better term, and to attempt to show racial progress in the United States he is labeled black.  The media thrives on this racist thinking and encourages it with newspaper headlines, and discussion of the monumental time we are living in.  In reality President-Elect Obama is ""The First Black President"" due entirely to   racist thinking on every side.

Second this election is considered a triumph for minorities and in particular African Americans.  This may be a true assessment in the strictest sense of placing a man of African decent into the  White House.  However an assessment of the data makes a point that challenges that point.  According to CNN's Exit Polls, 95% of African American Voters voted for President-Elect Obama(http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2008/results/polls/#val=USP00p1).  In 2004 88% of African Americans voted for John Kerry(http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2004/pages/results/states/US/P/00/epolls.0.html). In 2004 African Americans were 11% of the total voters, but in 2008 that number has increased to 13%. Most of the other numbers from the exit polls are relatively unchanged, which supports the idea that African Americans voted for President-Elect Obama merely because he shares African heritage.  

The reason that this is problematic is if this victory is heralded as victory in the battle for racial equality, it is a magnificent failure.  With a large group of people voting merely on the ideas of one race being superior to another is exactly what Civil Rights leaders fought against.  To have equality, Educated voters should not vote on race, but rather on issues and political standing.  To call this election a victory for equality spits in the face of those who fight for  true equality not racial preference.  Votes cast in favor of one race over another is racism.  

Until education and justice are the ruling of forces of America we will remain in a state of racial inequality and a media which promotes racist ideology.  While this election has been applauded as the election of the ""First Black President,"" it is rather an attempt to ignore the racism of the United States."

i have been contemplating this question for a long time.  

its almost all girls.  or that is what attracts them?

part of it is that nice boys are assholes also.

like when they tell you that they want to be friends but still act like they are into girls.

also im up shit creek with this research paper.

this semester may well fuck me in the butt.

"event","nothing excellent happens by accident.

this will not be political.  but i will discuss somethings i wonder about.

here is the way i see it.  we have two candidates for president. one has clear socialist tendencies, and other is a traditional American president.

im not convinced either of them will do 90% of what they want.

also a question to be raised, is socialism wrong?  I know its unamerican, but is it wrong.

thats all.

also i have been contemplating some heavy stuff.  

one question has been: can people ever really change or are they destined to repeat the same cycles and mistakes?

there is so much to talk about with that.  i mean people would say they change or they change for awhile but they make the same mistakes.  some of you might say that ""god can change anyone"" well sure they why so often do people return to the habits that god cures them from.

here is a specific question take it how you will. 

If your boyfriend can't control his penis outside of marriage (either breaking commitments that you have made for purity, or cheat on you), what makes you think he will control himself in a marriage?

that may sound kinda jaded and angry.  but i comes in the wake of a rash of hearing about bastards who cheated on their wives.

which brings us to question two.

is it possible to trust or to put anything in place to keep a husband from cheating again?

like jail time. or getting sodomized with baseball bat? or a lock of some kind? 

cause chances are he will cheat again, but this time he will be a hell of alot more sneaky.

and the last major question in my head.

if a person is a menace to society and clearly suck a human do they have the right to stay alive?

this becomes even more pertinent if people never change.

things to think about.

that church was making me into just another prick. 

how do people walk around with their head up their ass?

for the first time recently i wished that my mom's father was still alive.  he died when i was probably 6-8 years old.  so i did not really know him.  and he was sick most the time i knew him.  we saw him alot.

but i think he would understand me in a different way.  from what i remember i could sit down with a beer and talk to him.  about browns game which he always watched.  and about the bridges he had built.  

but i can't.  

my family gatherings don't involve any alcohol.  which is different than most people from what i hear.  i think it would help.  cause now everyone is so tight ass that they shit bricks of contepated emotions.  they all just need to chill out and let it be.

knock back a beer or two.  or a glass of wine, and they would all chill out.

beat it.

i think i want to see the movie sexdrive

but you will all love it for the wrong reasons, because you may like good movies, but you don't understand why."

im too tough to die.

this summer and the past few months have been dedicated to the concept of friendship.  and i exploration of who i understood to be my friend.

this led me to an understanding of a concept of friends.  and i decided that four people were truly my friends.  not that others were not.  but i could know for sure about these four. the ones i could go to at anytime for anything.

so far two live out of the city. which does not negate the statement.  one has been still the friend.  and one i realized does not care about me.

"event","So i have a pet peeve to tell you about i may have already but what the fuck it bears repeating.

people, mostly girls, who when they are together use the same phrasing.  or tone.  some people talk the same way.  and thats just what they do.  some people change their mode of speaking to fit in.  that bugs me.  though i guess not so much.  

competition and looks.  it confuses me.  i really dont understand looking presentable.  i look mostly the same with different clothes.  i dont really change.  its all a matter of wearing different clothes different places.

i wonder if i making a mockery of leadership.

i decided i want to have a family.

also as i was walking my new neighborhood. i have the neighborhood to fall in love.  its beautiful and i have a legit apartment.

my last place was a crash and drink alone room.  

as i was moving my guitar gear i decided that i need to do something with it all.

like music. i want to do a concept piece.  i was looking at either the book of jonah or joel.

i think i can make some more noise where i am.

i think that i could do that.

the world is bleak.  

i should just go for it?  and bust a move.

also i dont really have internet.  well i don't in my new place.  yet.  but i might.  so my phone is the best way to reach me, as always. 

its pretty fly and in a nice area.  its not huge but what is.

he goes through girls like i go through beer.

also i have been giving thought to an arranged marriage.  if i was in a place to get one it makes so much sense.  the first few years would be rough, but both of you are in for the long haul so does that matter?  its almost a better way to fall in love.  its like a family tie and family love.  

plus when dating and engaged you always have the chance to leave.  to break it off to judge the person rather than love.  

i dont think people should be forced to get married in any way.  but if i was matched with a girl by my parents or people that knew me, and she was fine with it and wanted to marry forever then it would work. 

it would be a whole adventure of getting to know the person.  the first years of marriage would be the first years of dating.  

what a different mindset.

there would be no choice. it just is.

love fucked up american marriages.

so who wants to marry me?

meet me at midnight.  at the broadcast tower. 

so i was turning in the keys to my apartment.  and the ladie at the desk was on the phone as said: ""yeah it seems like he and his girlfriend had some adventures and accidents...(pause)...yeah there are dents and stains.""

my major problems were the same as with the first one.  

Batman:  i dont like lame angry emo batman.  im so angry at the world.  why won't anyone like me?  yeah.  also the fact that he barely makes it and spend the whole movie driving from one place to another.

he is just a stuckup rich man who thinks he can play God.

Also Two-face all i saw was thank you for smoking.

It should have been two movies.  one about the joker.  one about two-face.

also the joker (since he was the only good part of the movie) should have had more time.

Also so i have no respect for a superhero who cannot kill the vilian.

END SPOILER TAG

thats my story and im sticking to it.

you want to disagree i will kill you.

happy birthday.  jesus sorry your party sucks."

"event","i really like when girls check me out when they are walking with their boyfriends.

i try to wink when i can remember.

the second look is cool as long as she doesnt notice.

also my clerk was flirting with me.  she told me my total was $23,000. Then she told me how earlier she had accidentally rang up a guy for 400 muffins instead of 4.  but she didnt notice til after he had paid.

in the words of my canadian boss: ""canada is not a country, its a vacation spot.""

well atleast their beer is ok.

kinda bland but i like it.

i have an apartment. in the city.  on park ave.  with a roommate.

we should get drunk and piss off the dock together.

do you know the muffin man?

chicks like dirt bags.

all you gotta do, are you ready?  write this down boys.  

you have to blow her off or say something slightly douch.  the goal is make her a little angry.

but then the next morning or after a little time you have to come to her very sorry and try to make it better.  then you say something super sweet.

because you were a douch before the contrast makes you look good.

right right??

night classes for the win. that bitch talks so much.  9 pages of notes.

also.

its been too long.

i will wait until he goes away again.

also new showbread is fucking awesome.  so wow. 

i would do showbread.

im of age.  

i look forward to the interview.

i have nothing to hide.

ill get out if thats the deal.

another sunny morning.

i kissed a girl and i liked it.  about time there was a song about girl on girl.

"event","Sometimes I got so bored of trying to touch her breast that I would try to touch her between her legs. It was like trying to borrow a dollar, getting turned down, and asking for 50 grand instead. 

boys and girls are different. 

just throwing that out there.  

boys and their trouble.

i thought you would want me.  but i guess your are busy living a life.

the class of 97 had its needs.

the world is so fucked up.

i want to be musical again.

i was.  i was a mother fucking rock star.  

i really want you to see me as a musician."

"event","so im thinking if i got a fake load for my head then i could plug it into a head phone amp and actually play.  rock and roll.

im so excited to start a night class.  its at mcc.

which i really feel at peace at.

i have alot of subsitute friends.  those that i use for a period of time.  until their time is done then i stop.

they learn too much or who knows.

i realized that i like the pursuit or the idea of one.  i like to piss off the girl try to get back in good with her.

but if it is too easy i get bored.  too easy to piss off or to patch things up with.

i can bullshit with the best.

do you really want to know?  do i want to be honest or a badass.  do i just want to told to never come back?

im damn good at what i do.  

timbaland is one of the great musicians of our time.

i also have every once in awhile friends.

i miss the cold and grumpy me.  

when i am straight pissed.  and people dont talk to me.  or think that i smile.  

maybe i will reach the goals of this summer.  maybe ill screw the pooch.

ill be the best kept secret and your biggest mistake.

i dont fear people.

i want your blood."

"event","i realized i dont small talk people's questions.  

i answer them. very open endedly.

have you ever paid attention to the dots and squiggles.

i will be living in sin.  i hope you judge me for it.

heavy metal till i die.

cause someone will ask me something like did you grow up here.  and i tell them my dad worked for kodak and got the ax and got the hell out of town.  

or else i dont say anything. 

my eyes move alot when i talk with two people.

back and forth.  and forth and back.

eyes matter so much.  the way that they peer back at me.

i hate you and he together.

why do girls let boys ruin their lives?

im stronger than you.

its a kick ass day to not be at work.

i have get the boys loaded in and out right quick and then i can rest.  then and only then.

i am a part of them.

fuck you and your love.  tell me you love me and ignore me.  just tell me to fuck off.  please dont lie to me.

"event","i have had a splinter in my brain for about 4 days.  

this is the thing that you cant quite get past the thought that messes with all of your thoughts.  you dont want to think about it but its there.  

the idea the person who is centrally located.  

i can almost feel it.  its on the left top center.  the splinter.  buried under the skin.

the eyes that were more open than so many.  

the person i was at the time. 

the way they see me because of what they expect.

the life which keeps on living.

never is a person a phantom.

i like the option to run into someone even if i know i won't.

what am i really.

thats not a question.

so what am i gonna to do now?
just keep jumping from rock to rock for the rest of my life until there aren't any rocks left.
should i bolt everytime i get that feeling in my gut when i meet someone new.
ive thinking with my gut since i was 14 years old.

and frankly speaking ive come to the conclusion that my guts have shit for brains."

Stinging rain whipped and sputtered his small flame into lifelessness. What shelter he had under the cracked columns along the spit the wind stripped away; if he did not leave soon, he would be soaked, and if he was unable to get dry before the cold set in, he would die out here.

Still, he couldn't look away. The Reich had arrived in force with their banners streaming as they poured out of the nearby metro. They had their slaves rip the gilded gates down and set to them to work building fires, fixing windows, and clearing out whatever inhabitants had used it before they'd come. The stalker watched one ripped out through a crack in the wall by a demon that perched on the roof. His masters drank and laughed. Jeered as the corpse was ripped and apart and devoured, and shot only when the creature came close to their own men.

Years ago, the waste of filters have so many come to the surface would have been unthinkable. But then, so would the rain.

*	* 	*

The stalker first saw rain again when he was a major for the Red Line, escorting a Ranger on a mission that would doom them both. Rain and sunlight - unbelievable, since the bombs fell. But more had come; the rain cleared the air and washed it into the earth, and clear skies awakened long-slumbering seeds. The plants that grew were stunted and unrecognizable, but there were more every year. Filters that used to clog within minutes now lasted hours.

Filters that lasted hours made long trips on the surface possible. He had spent whole days under the sky, only to crawl back into the tunnels and scrub his filters clean at night. Long trips made travel out of Moscow possible. Risky, but possible. He kept to the suburban lines at first, then discovered that even a sewer or deep basement would do. The air had cleared that much. 

He used to catch glimpses of people, from time to time. Villagers in the suburban metros. Other stalkers, on the surface. Then he would find - gratefully - their caches, and spent fires. But by the time he reached St. Petersburg, he was the only man he'd seen in a hundred miles or more. 

So he'd remained, for the past year, until now.

*	* 	*

The fascists showed no sign of leaving; they were settling in, for good. They could sleep in the lower levels, out of the toxic air. Which the stalker realized he had better do, and limped his way across the broken street to Primorskaya Station. He squeezed past the rusted turnstiles and locked the gate to his erstwhile home: the collection booth, comfortably sealed in by unbroken plexiglass. Sometimes he'd wake to see the metro's other denizens caught in the traps he laid outside; once, a fist-sized crack next to where he slept, under a picture of the Eiffel Tower.

He hung up his wet coat and tugged a blanket around his shoulders instead. Removed his mask, then unscrewed his filter to clean it. Counted how many rounds he had left in his rifle before drying it and oiling it. The mundane tasks of life. If he was lucky, there would be fish in his traps tonight. Primorskaya was half-flooded, just like Venice, with an exit to the sea. In his months of crawling through the empty stations of the city, he'd found no better place than this: isolated, protected, and out of view. The water blocked one tunnel; the other had collapsed. He put all of his treasures here: himself, his postcard, and his boat.

He hadn't been idle all his months in the city. The explosions had wrecked all of the ships along the waterfront beyond salvaging, but there was one in dry dock for refitting that hadn't be as damaged. It had taken weeks just to scrounge up all of the parts he needed to repair it, and far longer to make the repairs, knowing absolutely nothing about watercraft. But like all citizens of the metro he knew motors and generators, and once it was watertight and running it was good enough for him. Then to seal up door to below deck tightly enough that he could stay there and breathe long enough to clean his filters; he had to, for this to work. The few trials he had around the bay had worked well enough. He hadn't drowned. 

He'd been working up the courage to leave when the Reich had showed up. They didn't crawl and creep their way through the metro like he had; they brought drills and gatling guns, smashing their way down the line in days what had taken him weeks. The island was the only place they hadn't reached, and their slaves were clearing the rubble - he could hear them, day and night. Sometimes their bodies washed up in his safe haven - if they broke a limb, or got too sick to work, the Reich soldiers would shoot them and toss them in the bay. Sometimes. Other times they wouldn't waste the bullet. 

No one he recognized from the Red Line, thankfully. No, his comrades knew what awaited them if they were captured by the Reich. They would - and he had - escape or die trying.

*	*	*

The stalker went to D6 only once. 

Weeks later, well after the Reich soldiers had taken every last weapon and supply, down to the spent but salvageable casings. It was still a struggle to walk, and no one would come with him. 

For all the blood that had been shed to break into the stronghold, getting in was trivial: the trains and explosives his own people had used had destroyed the blast doors beyond fixing. Corpses of Red Line soldiers had been left where they'd fallen. In the aftermath of the Rangers' short-lived victory, they'd had no time to put anything in order. He was sure they meant no disrespect. Meters past those were the bodies of Rangers too slow or too wounded to run from Reich.

He checked the faces of a few before he lost the heart for it.

Cold, damp, dusty, and dark; generators ripped out of the walls, light bulbs unscrewed, they had even taken the blankets and boots. He felt his way past the ruined control room and empty armoury to the barracks, where a few scattered worthless personal effects lay on the floor.

He left with his grimy postcard of Paris.

D6 hadn't held anything anyone wanted, and the Rangers and the Red Line had broken one another for control of that nothing so badly that the only real power left in Moscow was the Reich. The Reich, and the Dark Ones. Whatever his Ranger had done, the Dark Ones had returned soon after, and another wave of living corpses had followed. The scattered survivors of the Red Line had wanted little to do with the man who'd let it all happen - or at least failed to stop it, so as soon as he had healed enough to walk, the stalker was on his own. When he'd left, every station in the city was either under the Reich, or abandoned to its ghosts.

*	* 	*

Muffled screams roused him from where he dozed, half-oiled weapon in hand. Too experienced to jerk awake and dart around; he quietly snapped the rifle back together and crawled to a hole in the booth to peer outward. Faint light from the rubble at the other end of the station. He crept toward it along the depression of the tracks, out of sight. Braced himself and peered beyond.

They were terrifyingly close. Yesterday they'd been hundreds of feet away; he'd spend too much time watching the surface, not enough time down here, on his boat. Work was halted for now - the emaciated slaves stirred listlessly as one of their number clutched her face. Blood poured through her fingers; debris, from the drills. Probably blind. The tiny hole to the stalker's side went dark as the hapless worker was kicked up against it; blood oozed through when she was shot.

The stalker shrank back as soundlessly as he had approached. It took effort, this time. It would take them until dawn, most likely, to break through all the way. He had mere hours to gather enough fuel and prepare everything to leave. And he had to do it all quietly, now.

The deafening whine of the drill covered most of what he did, but it they stopped it to keep it from overheating from time to time; the intermittent clang of picks, shouts and laughter from the fascists, a half-hearted cry of protest or two when their workers were kicked or shoved or used for entertainment. 

When the stalker was done he laid down on the deck exhaustedly. 

*	* 	*

The workers' arms grasped at him, dragging him slowly down under the water. Into darkness. They hated him for surviving, for running away. First the bombs, and now this. He had hope and they had nothing and they would take it from him.

Suffocating, trapped. ""Help,"" he hissed, not really expecting an answer. A last, fleeting, panicked attempt to survive. He'd betrayed the last man who would bother. ""Please don't leave.""

A glove of Spartan armour reached out and grasped his outstretched hand.

*	*	*

The stalker gasped awake and wiped the sweat from his face; they were nearly through. Any closer and they would see his boat - as it was, he had to push it through the tunnels with a board, not daring to use the motor. He tugged on his mask and flattened himself to the deck as he drifted out to sea, inches below the grasping legs of a spider the size of his bow.

The rain had turned to grey snow, blanketing the black bay so thickly he could barely make out the many lights in the palace. Within minutes he would vanish without a trace to the west. He spun the wheel hard to the north, instead. The motor was only as loud as the driving blizzard; he killed the engines far from the decorative jetty outside the palace and drifted in.

Steps were hard for him, now. The oversized, decorative kind were even worse. He had to climb each one on his hands and knees, braced against his rifle. The slush soaked through his gloves, but he dared not take them off lest he have to put his hands on broken glass without them.

The stalker was drenched by the time he reached the palace; adrenaline and effort kept him from freezing. He huddled against a dark windowsill, out of the wind. Caught his breath and dragged himself inside. Where moisture had leaked through the marble was stained; streaked with ash and marred by dirty boots. He only knew from pictures that it was white. He followed the bootprints past rotted paintings and down a staircase with ceilings that soared dramatically above. Down here, out of the dirty air outside the wine cellar but not inside to share the warmth and protection, were the slaves they used to fight; as fodder for demons and whatever else they could spare their own men. They disarmed and chained them for the night, as some still had flesh and strength left. One locked piercingly blue eyes with his and raised a finger to where his lips would be, over his mask.

The stalker froze. Heard a creak from the darkness within and when his eyes had adjusted to it, picked out the black of a Reich uniform being readjusted. The slave he sat next to turned his head, spat; the soldier tossed his mask back to him, casually. 

He was in the shadows, but exposed to any who looked closely. His heart rang in his ears; long gone were the days when he could outrun anyone, and the fascist was a shout away from having scores, maybe hundreds, of men at his side. Escape or die trying... but these men in front of him looked like the kind who would have done that, too, if they could have. Watching the slave the fascist sat next to spin his filter frantically back into place made him wonder what he would be willing to do to breathe.

Might have to do.

The blue-eyed one rattled his chain loudly. ""I need to piss."" 

""So piss where you are,"" the Reich soldier growled back. Unamused. 

""And sit in it all night? I'll make it worth your while,"" offered flatly. Lifelessly.

The soldier stood with a grunt and turned toward him. ""You will anyway."" 

He didn't move to take them out, but from here the stalker could see that he had the keys. He slung his rifle and drew his knife. The slave who'd just replaced his mask didn't hesitate - he reached up, wrapped his chain around the soldier and covered his mouth. The soldier drew his pistol immediately to shoot him but the stalker got there first. Gunfire would alert them all; he broke his hand and kicked the weapon away before stabbing him in the neck, and chest, while the slave held him down. 

His hands were too numb from cold and slippery with bloody to work the locks; the slave did it for him. Took the pistol, while the stalker offered his own sidearm to the man who'd kept him from being caught. Which saved his life; when the rest were unchained, and realized that the stalker was alone, and crippled, and had weapons and supplies there was one agonizing moment where he saw them consider simply killing him to take them, but the two he'd armed moved to stand beside him, meaningfully. 

The Reich soldiers weren't stupid. ""Where are the guards?"" The stalker asked, as quietly as he could. 

""With the rest,"" a slave jerked his head in the direction of the tunnel that linked to the metro. ""Let's get out of here.""

The stalker shook his head. Collected a few of the chains and used them to wrap around the handle of the doors to the wine cellar. ""If you leave now, defenseless, they'll hunt you down like dogs. How long do you think you'll survive in the metro, unarmed? On the surface, without filters? Run and die like cowards. Fight to free your comrades and live."" He didn't wait for them; he limped off in the direction of the tunnel.

Two followed, then three. Most of them did, eventually. They avoided the light and made it almost to the end, where the drill covered the sound of so many footsteps.

Until banging and shouting started from the cellar door.

Three soldiers whipped around, but the stalker aimed for the gatling gun first, the only weapon that could kill them all. Taking the shot cost him a lance of pain down his bad leg, he wavered but didn't fall. The wound was glancing and he was so used to it that he managed to duck behind a rolling cart full of rocks before doubling over in agony. The blue-eyed slave covered him; he tossed rifle to one of the others who hadn't fled or been shot when the firing began. ""Fight, comrades!""

Not to the men who'd come down the tunnel with him, but to the others. They were badly outnumbered by soldiers, but they were not at all outnumbered. The workers they'd armed with picks. Shovels. Drills. ""This is your chance! Fight with us!""

Most stood in puzzlement, others cowered in terror. The Reich soldiers didn't seem to know if they should see them as a threat - they weren't shooting at them, and if they killed them, who would dig? One tossed a grenade behind the cart; the stalker threw himself behind the engine of the drill and covered his face with his hands. His ears rang and there were shrieks of dismay. Signs of life. Someone was still firing.

""Brothers! Sisters!"" His hands were trembling before; they were shrapnel-riddled and useless, now. He used his feet to drag the chains across the drill's rails and elbowed the mechanism to start it with a satisfying crunch. ""We fight with you!""

But it meant his cover was gone; he was unarmed. Suddenly his chest was hot and it was hard to breathe - through the haze of pain he could see that two of the fighters were still alive. Two of them, and ten Reich soldiers. He tried to call out to them again, but air wouldn't come. An old, heavily armoured Reich soldier picked him up by the mask and ripped it off, splattering blood everywhere.

""Red Line."" He spat. ""A Red Line officer. Good! An execution is just what we needed.""

""Fight, comrades..."" The stalker wheezed. Unsure if the workers heard him, or if it was the soldier's own words that doomed him. Behind him, a gaunt old woman mouthed the words 'Red Line officer' in disbelief, a hardness in her eyes just before she buried her pick right in the soldier's skull. 

All it took was one. The rest followed. Realized there were scores of them, and the gatling gunner, was gone, and they descended on the rest with screams. 

The stalker made it to his feet, once. Thought about joining the fight. Thought about dragging himself back to his boat. Long intervals swallowed by blackness showed him that he'd made it a few feet. More pounding from the cellar. More soldiers. Two workers on the gatling gun, turned around to face them.

Fire. Fire that ripped its way through the palace above him, followed by gunfire, demons. ""Comrades..."" He reached out to the ones he couldn't save. Who he'd stumbled over, in piles, at the doors of D6. 

*	*	*

He woke in a pile of blankets. Each breath made him wince and when he shifted his bad leg didn't move with him. It took a few seconds to realize that the crackling fire wasn't the palace, that the haze above him was scratched plexiglass and not smoke. Outside his shelter, the strumming of a guitar ceased with his noises of pain.

The blue-eyed man leaned inside, his mask off. The face was hollow from starvation, bearded, and very, very scarred. But he smiled. Nodded to the postcard. ""Where do we go from here, Athos? Paris?"""

"event","""Any idea can be good if done well.""

""There are no new ideas.""

""It's all in the execution.""

<lj-cut text=""Everyone has heard these truisms about crafting a story before, and honestly, for most of my life I would have agreed with them.""> What matters is not the originality of a story, but rather the skill of the storyteller. To an extent this is obviously the case, but as I get older and read/watch/play/generally consume more media I find increasingly that I enjoy something with a fresh, exciting concept and passable craft far, far more than than a trite, worn, pedestrian plot and stock characters given masterful execution. Good storytelling is, of course, greatly important and the quality of writing will still quite often make or break a story for me, but over the years I find myself tuning out of - or never bothering to start - something with a fill-in-the-blanks synopsis.

You're free to disagree with me, of course. I would have disagreed with me not so many years ago. But by now I've heard too many otherwise excellent writers intone the aforementioned truisms like some kind of talisman to ward off criticism for their lack of originality. If you're really all that hot shit, why not take a few minutes to come up with something that doesn't read like a mad libs game of TV Tropes? Surely after all that time spent polishing your craft, you've had a couple of creative ideas? ...Right?

And I'm not convinced there are ""no new ideas."" In fact, it's literally impossible for their <i>not</i> to be new ideas, given that there are an infinite number of stories to be told in the universe, and in the finite history of mankind there have been a finite number of stories. Even if you can't come up with something you've <i>never</i> seen before (or you do come up with something, but it turns out that someone else, at some point, has also done it) you can certainly come up with something <i>less</i> done than, say, ""rag tag band of survivors of a zombie apocalypse in suburban America learns how to work together to overcome their differences... and discovers that not zombies, but humans, are their most terrifying foe!!!!."" Just, try harder, man.

To reiterate: I'm not saying that craft isn't important, and that I won't read/watch something with a tired premise and a collection of archetypes that never wavers from the three-part, saving the cat structure if someone truly brilliant wrote it, I'm asking you: if you're really that brilliant, why didn't you write something else? Why didn't you, at the very least, deconstruct the hoary old ideas you're recycling? I'm at the point where, let's say for example, story A scores 8/10 in skill, 3/10 in originality, and story B scores 6/10 in skill and 9/10 in originality. Years ago, I absolutely would have preferred the former. Now I'd never get past the first five pages of A, if I even made it past the description on the back cover. Sure, story B's author isn't that great (yet), but at least she's fucking <i>trying</i>. How did you make it to an 8/10, author A, without a single interesting thought in your head? I might slog through your shit when you make it to 10/10 purely for love of the art, but if by that time B is at 8/10 skill and now at 10/10 ideas, you don't stand a chance.

At least put an original <i>spin</i> on what you're doing. As a recent example, I was coming up with characters with my roleplay group. One of the guys decided his character was going to be the lone survivor of two brothers in the event that tied us all together. As he first conceived it, his brother would have been the favourite and, woe is him, his parents always resented that he was the one who came back. 

But, why.

Why?

I'll tell you why: it's the first thing that popped into his head. It's been done hundreds, if not thousands, of times before. That is the least original way you could go about that idea. There are any number of characters like that in all kinds of stories. My suggestion: make the survivor the favorite, instead. It's really that simple. He's always known that his parents were (secretly) relieved that he was the one who came back, and since he loved his brother dearly, he's wracked with guilt. Hey, now he has internal conflict, even! As opposed to purely external ""his parents resent him, but he is blameless"" woobifying, go-nowhere sad. Now, this guy was just spitballing ideas around a table for a private game. But why, skilled storyteller, are you doing with the first thing that pops into your head? It's lazy, and I'm calling you out on your laziness. Go ahead and be mad: search your feelings, you know it to be true. 

<i>Especially</i> if you've mastered the rest of your craft, why are you phoning in this one part? Because it takes effort? Well, so did everything else about writing! 

Be better. 

(As a bonus, is there any concept that's so well-worn in the genre(s) you like that it's dead to you? As an action/thriller fan, ""skilled, dangerous man must hurt people to save/avenge the death of his female"" is dead to me. If I see that synopsis, I simply will not read/watch/play your creation. You could literally be the best writer who ever lived, I'm not kidding. I laughed out loud at John Wick's unsubtle dig at how utterly mindless, exhausted, unrealistic, and dehumanizing this story is - watch it if you ever get the chance.)"

"event","Like it says in the title: I'm selling off the last of my doujinshi.

If you've been following my LJ for the delicious Japanese fanporn and are (for some reason) still here and not on my sales sites, this is your chance to get the few scraps that remain for dirt cheap.

To make this post somewhat more substantial: I hocked just about all of my doujinshi before I left for Japan a few years back, and gave away most of the rest, but there was a single box I kept of books I thought I might miss. Now though, honestly, it's just sitting in a box; I've already read all of them several times, so someone else might as well enjoy them. They're old now, and most of the fandoms are long-gone, but if anybody's interested, they're still out there.

I'm probably not entirely done with doujinshi, but I'm definitely done with collecting. I'll probably keep doing what I've been doing for the past couple of years: buying the occasional book that interests me, reading it, then selling it to English-speaking fans who have less access to these things than I do. In any case, follow the links below for the cheapest collection of Shin Megami Tensei, Devil Summoner, DSRK, Devil May Cry, FF8, and Call of Duty doujinshi you're likely to ever find:

http://tfml-doujinshi.livejournal.com/
http://tfmldoujinshi.tumblr.com/

(If these don't sell on my sites I'll be putting them up on eBay; I figure fans should get first crack at them before re-sellers do. If they don't sell on eBay they're going in the trash, so if you're reading this post years from now: no, I no longer have them.)"

"event","So I finally got around to watching the <b>Ender's Game</b> film. No, this is not the rant you think it will be based on the subject.

<lj-cut text=""Spoilers for both the book and the movie under the cut, but really, this is one of those things that&#39;s almost certainly been spoiled for you already"">

...I thought it was good! An honourable adaptation than managed to capture the thrill and surprise of the original, with some neat graphics and good/justified - for once - use of copious amounts of CGI. (They play ""virtual"" war simulations.) I liked the book when I read it as a teenager, and really, who wouldn't? The ultimate power fantasy that is Ender - to be an outcast <i>and</i> have the respect of everyone around you, to be the best fighter in physical combat <i>and</i> strategy, to commit genocide <i>and</i> not really be morally culpable for it <i>and</i> restore an entire race as their saviour - is something that just about any teenager would love. (It should be said that I also read the unrevised edition, so I got the original story, not the ""updated for Card's increasingly fanatical moral politics"" edition.)

Speaking of which, having liked the book, said politics are the only reason I didn't go see it in the theatre in the first place. No, it has nothing to do with not being able to support the ""art"" of many if one the artists believes something I disagree with, it has to do with the fact that Card <i>uses</i> the money he was earning from it <i>directly</i> to fund bigoted organizations like NOM. I ""support"" Card's work as a writer in that I acknowledge the artistic and intellectual achievement that is the Ender's Game, but I'm not going to effectively donate money to immoral cause. I highly recommend you check it out from the library, though! Or buy it used. Or read a friend's copy.

What I was the most curious about, though, was how they were going to deal with the random 70s style misogyny in the book, where there are few women in Battle School because, quite literally, evolution made them too dumb. Sure, back in the 70s boys still outperformed girls slightly in IQ tests and academic achievement, feminists argued that this was the result of socialization, and the more forward-thinking sci-fi authors of the 70s (like GRRM) used this as a stepping stone to create more enlightened futures that will ring truer today where IQs are roughly equal (some of the latest in fact showing girls with a very slight edge, though whether that's statistically significant is debatable). I could fully imagine more boys being in Battle School if it was simply the case that more boys signed up and that more boys aspired to join and more boys trained for it - war is perhaps the most masculinized profession of all - but this wasn't the claim made in the book. In the book, with humanity facing a dire threat, the best and brightest join Battle School, and they are overwhelmingly male. That just wouldn't ring true in today's world where girls score equally well on intelligence tests and are overrepresented in higher education. At all. Let alone in some distant future, where presumably based on the trends we see now it would be even more equal.

The handles this dilemma gracefully, and does what I would have done - ignores it. Rewrites it without actually changing any of the lines. About half the cadets you see in Battle School are female, even if the gender distribution of the named characters must by necessity remain the same. Petra has a throwaway line about being the ""only girl in Salamander"" somewhat proudly, but Ender's much more diverse Dragons beat Salamander to pulp, so it seems more reflective of the macho dingbat who leads Salamander's attitudes than any objective statements about female inferiority. It leaves everything else the book says about gender out entirely. Between that and the number of female cadets in the background, it erases this aspect of the story. Updates it for modern reality.

I'm not the first person to say it, I know, but nothing dates supposedly ""futuristic"" sci-fi like displaying mores hopelessly rooted in the author's times. (This happens in fantasy as well, where characters display modern mores in the distant past, but unlike sci-fi authors many fantasy authors are well aware of the anachronism and are doing it quite intentionally. If you've got magic and zombies and dragons, you can have forward-thinking views in medieval-equivalent times, they assert. Fair enough!) The first time I ran across this was when my seventh grade teach gave me The Day Of The Triffids as an elementary school graduation present. Up until then I'd only read classic sci-fi by relatively forward-thinking authors for their time (like Asimov and LeGuin) so I wondered if the author had just lost his mind or been jilted by a girlfriend or what when his Everywoman By Proxy asserts that all ""real"" women love babies and hate work and are just <i>thrilled</i> at the notion of sharing their husbands with another woman, unlike those ""movie stars"", and the shrill feminist harpy at the college is proven wrong in her assertions that they should be more than baby-havers. I spoke to my teacher about it, and got an eye-opening lesson into what the world was like before the Second Wave. I encountered much, much more of this as I delved further into classic sci-fi - my brother got Stranger In A Strange Land as his present and I was to learn that women weren't the only whipping boys of the past imagined to remain so for all time - up to and including Ender's Game itself. By then, I was prepared. It was the 90s, and (what I sincerely hope to have been) the last throes of Nature Uber Alles/Fuck Blacks and Bitches/The Bell Curve were dying an ignoble death. When I read that most bitches were too stupid for Awesome School I was pretty nonplussed. 

It's still jarring, though. Particularly when it makes no sense whatsoever. Perhaps, you could argue, that in the Triffids the Everywoman of the 50s <i>does</i> love babies and hate jobs (though that she'd be delighted to have a second wife is pretty debatable). That work is speculative, not overtly futuristic. But in something like Leigh Brackett's The Long Tomorrow, where the two named female characters in the past act like 50s stereotypes of women, while the male characters are richly nuanced and distinct, it's truly head-scratching. Supposedly the world's technology has reverted to that of the 19th century, so of course nobody's going to be all that enlightened, right? True, but her female characters don't act like women of some distant post-apocalyptic future <i>or</i> women from the 19th century. They act like (stereotypical, one dimensional) women from the 1950s. Which is <i>impossible</i> based on the world she's created. What's even more perplexing is that the book itself says profound things about human curiosity and intellect, yet she - a female author of science fiction in the 1950s no less! - presumes women to have neither. (Given her later work, I have to presume she was just pandering to her male audience here, because she does write curious and intelligent women elsewhere.)

Of course it's possible to do the opposite and assume that trends will continue well into the future that don't. I've joked a few times with friends about sci-fi authors who thought that the Sexual Revolution would last forever and that by the 2000s had their characters having sex no differently than they would a handshake. (And perhaps that would have happened, if not for AIDS, and drug-resistant STDs - not something the authors could have foreseen.) Or maybe it will happen eventually, they've just got the precise dates wrong.

I suppose that makes far-future sci-fi more believable than near-future sci-fi, because we can always pretend that society has reverted back to some earlier stage, but it rarely actually reads this way; the Dune series doesn't read so much ""here is this civilization's strange and different views on gender politics"", it reads ""here are Frank Herbert's dated views on gender politics"". The only lesson to be found here, I think, is to either a) make your sci-fi society as open and forward-thinking as possible, because there will doubtless come a time when it will be seen as hopelessly backwards, otherwise, or b) make society something utterly new and alien to us. I realize that that's a lot of work when you're furiously wanking about starships, but it'll be worth it, trust me. I never even bothered to finish Day of The Triffids. 

(Of course, fantasy authors are even worse about b) in some ways, but that's another rant for another time.)"

"event","I've never really cared for them much. I remember complaining about them as a child, though I could never explain the reason, and my disgruntlement only grew stronger as I grew older and learned more about the world around me. They always seemed too confining, too ""you go in the this box and you can never leave, you go in this other box and you can never leave""; too generalizing, too much like what I'd later learn to describe as essentializing. Worse, even as a child the demarcations of what magic men ""got"" and what magic women ""got"" seemed to broadly arbitrary, their justifications spurious (e.g. okay, so throughout history most warriors were men and - recently, at least - most nurses are women, so battle magic is ""male"" and healing magic is ""female""... but there have been and still are both female warriors and male nurses, so why couldn't some women use battle magic and some men healing magic?) which I would later learn had much to do with them representing ""ideal"" versions of either gender that were ""ideal"" mainly in the author's own head. 

Why they really bothers me though, is that they are never biologically, or even logically, consistent. First off, ask yourself: why does this magic differentiate between men and women? Does it do so on the basis of sex, or gender?

<lj-cut text=""Long-winded rant about this below the cut"">

<b>Gender-based Magic</b>

This should be obvious to most people with even the barest education in history, anthropology, sociology, or psychology, but gender is the performance of a social role (often based on biological sex, though not always). It is psychologically and sociologically constructed. Many societies have had - and still have - third genders, or the recognition of ""two spirited"" individuals, or bestow upon people the ability to change their gender if they wish (e.g. sworn virgins). If magic is gender-based:

-Societies with more than two genders would have more than two types of magic
-There would be individuals of one sex that used the other gender's magic
-There would be individuals who could use both types of magic

Yet in fantasy worlds with gender-based magic systems (i.e. magic chooses individuals on the basis of their ""spirit"" or masculine/feminine ""soul"" or what have you) almost never seem to have these. (One possible and surprising exception to this was Dark Souls, actually, where one biologically male character who dressed and lived as a woman also used ""female"" magic.)

<b>Sex-based Magic</b>

If an individual's ability to use magic is purely based on biology, how does it make this distinction? Is it primary or secondary sexual development, or is it genetic? If it's sexual development, what magic do intersex persons with ambiguous genitals get? If it's genetic (XX vs. XY chromosomes), what magic do persons with XXY, XYY, X, XXX, etc., chromosomes get? Would some XX individuals with <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XX_male_syndrome"">all of the primary and secondary sex characteristics of males</a> not then use ""female"" magic, too? And certain XY individuals with <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Androgen_insensitivity_syndrome"">the primary and secondary characteristics of females</a> not use ""male"" magic? Lacking our knowledge of genetics, how would your fantasy society rationalize the existence of these people? The whole notion of sex-based magic falls apart completely based on what we now know about the biological basis of sex. If you were to have sex-based magic:

-There would either have to be more than two types of magic (possibly a great many) or intersex individuals would have to have access to both
-There would be individuals who to all observation appeared to be one sex (including that sex's genitals) who used the other sex's magic

Which would be an interesting notion were someone to actually attempt it. Perhaps your imaginary society of magic users feels that infertility is the ""price"" certain ""special"" women (i.e. individuals with androgen insensitivity syndrome) have to pay for access to ""male"" magic; sterility is the price for men (i.e. XX males) to use female magic. Or that certain physical abnormalities that often accompany chromosomal abnormalities are the cost of accessing special/mixed magic. I've never seen anyone try their hand at this either.

No, no, instead it's always same old, same old, saidin/saidar, sex = gender, intersex and transgendered people don't exist in this world. And the arguments I always hear against my proposals are this:

<b>-Well intersex/transgendered people are such a tiny minority nobody cares about them and I don't need to bother thinking about what happens to them!</b>

...Don't you? Complete androgen insensitivity syndrome occurs in one in 20,000 births; there's at least one beautiful woman in each fair-sized fantasy city who can use man-magic - 12 of them in fantasy!Rome alone. You don't think your hero has ever heard stories about that? 

<b>-The magic ""knows"" their ""real"" sex/gender!</b>

...How? That's very progressive of you in the case of transgendered persons, but it still means you've got people who appear to be one thing with the power of another. You're cool with that? Awesome! You can be as cool as the Dark Souls team. ...Now what are you going to do with people who truly don't identify as a gender or identify as both?

<b>-Magic is bestowed by a being/sentience who does so only to individuals with unambiguous genitalia who identify solely as the gender ascribed to their sex - hah!</b>

Your being is kind of dick. Why does it do this? ""To make the author's life easier"" does not make for a compelling or logically consistent world. What does it do about societies with a third gender, anyway?

<b>-There are no societies with a third gender, there are no transgendered or intersex individuals, and no persons with chromosomal abnormalities in my world - hah!</b>

So... you're writing about a non-human fantasy race? That's cool. Just make it clear from the outset that your fantasy people in no way resemble real people. Most fantasy authors call their wish-fulfillment race ""elves"" but you could always try to come with something more creative.

<b>-Shut up shut up you feminist cow. Stop trying to police my imagination!</b>

This is by far the most common response I receive to the above whenever I talk about the above with someone who wants to make a gendered magic system. How is describing human biological and psychological realities ""policing"" anyone's imagination? It's fantasy; if you want to make a magic race with no transgendered or intersex individuals, feel free - just don't pretend that's ""us"" in any way, or that it is somehow an accurate allegory for the ""differences"" between the ""sexes"". (Which they inevitably do.) Wouldn't it be <i>more</i> creative to take human variation into account and magic more than two types of ""gendered"" magic? I certainly think so. 

<b>It's <i>magic</i> - it's mysterious and unknowable and I don't have to explain it. Hah!</b>

...But you've already given your magic ""rules"" that it operates by; those ""rules"" are incomplete or nonsensical. Say that you've establish that right-handed people get fire magic, and left-handed people get water magic. Someone comes up to you and asks ""what do ambidextrous people get?"". ""Nyah nyah I don't have to tell you it doesn't matter magic works in mysterious ways"" would be the cop-out of the century, would it not? And ""ambidextrous people are a tiny minority so they don't count/magic knows their ""real"" handedness/ambidextrous people don't exist in my world"" would make you look like an unimaginative douchehat with serious issues, no?"

"event","So I watched <i>The Mist</i> tonight, having seen it crop up over and over as one of f!s's top ""movies with depressing endings"". As a fan of Asian cinema, I've seen any number of films with depressing endings, but this was American. Also, I noticed a horror film - and they said ""depressing"", not ""scary"". Interesting...

What they neglected to mention was that it was one of the best horror film endings <b>ever</b>.

<lj-cut text=""Cut for possible spoilers by inference"">

First, go watch the film. It's old - I'm sure it's on Netflix by now. (Just <a href=""http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/The_Mist/70077532?locale=en-US"">verified that</a>.)

Yeah? Yeah? Amirite?

Some characters actually do the sensible thing that you would have done and survive because of it? Military personnel are portrayed as human but competent? The military unleashes a ~~dangerous force beyond their control~~ but then reacts appropriately and deals with the situation, rather than leaving it all up to a band of plucky, multiethnic survivors who don't get along at first but learn to overcome obstacles through the power of friendship? 

Well, one glance at the reviews for the film will reveal that there's a directly inverse correlation between the score given by the reviewers and how butthurt the ending made them. One gentleman snidely takes aim at those who <i>enjoyed</i> the ending, claiming that while everybody might be tired of happy endings, an anti-cliche is no more original than a cliche. (This is a favourite saying of a writer friend of mine, too.) What he means is this: if something is a cliche, doing exactly the opposite is also cliche, and took zero imagination besides. If the stereotypical dwarf is a stocky, axe-swinging, heavy-drinking warrior, making a slim, effete, lightweight dwarven scholar is no more original. 

And while there's undeniably some truth to that, he's still wrong, because <i>The Mist</i>'s ending <i>isn't</i> an anti-cliche. Far from it. 

See, the cliche - and said reviewer even points this out - is the happily-ever-after ending, and it's obvious in this film what that would have been. But the anti-cliche is <i>not</i> what actually happened - the anti-cliche is the rocks-fall-everybody-dies ending. And yes, if that had happened, he'd be perfectly right: that shit happens all the time in horror films, to the point where it's as cliche as the happy ending and the sole survivor ending.

But wait! Wasn't this a sole survivor ending? Hell no. There were - as you saw in the final scene - <i>tons</i> of survivors. They were just people who didn't act like idiots. If the main group - the group the ""hero""'s group left behind - doesn't do anything similarly moronic, it's very clear they'll all survive too. 

An <i>unhappy</i> horror film ending where the vast majority of the cast survives. Now <i>that</i> is original. Never once seen it before, and I doubt I'll see it again."

The system is ORE Nemesis (a horror game) and the setting is Afghanistan. The vast majority of feedback I've received for my pitch has been very positive - from players and forums and unrelated friends alike.

However, a certain new player declined to join us on account of it. What was his problem? The setting. There is, he feels, nothing to do in Afghanistan, and would prefer it if the game were set in the US or Canada instead.

Waiting on one more person who may or may not be playing to get back to me, but so far it looks like it's going to be a blast. This is a far cry from the usual high fantasy/Space Marines/Steampunk/Vampires and werewolves fare of most games I've run or played."

"event","I wasn't sure voice actors <i>could</i> be typecast in quite the same way as regular actors (Japanese seiyuu tend to do a decent enough job of differentiating characters, and the few VA wit multiple roles in Western video games I know of up to this point, such as Gary Oldman, do a decent enough job too) but that, my friends, was until I played <i>Spec Ops: The Line</i>.

The protagonist, Captain Walker, is played by Nolan North (who plays Nathan Drake of <i>Uncharted</i> fame). Now I've played every <i>Uncharted</i> game and thoroughly enjoyed them. That undoubtedly has a lot to do with it. But I just <i>could not</i> get over it. Even though the two of them are <i>completely</i> different characters, I never acclimatized. Instead, the further Walker got from Drake in personality, the more jarring it became. (It doesn't help that, given how he rolls through countless badguys through the <i>Uncharted</i> series, I'd always joked that Nathan Drake was ex-Special Forces.)

And let me tell you, there is nothing stranger than hearing the plucky, kind-hearted hero of a very PG-13 adventure series scream ""DIE MOTHERFUCKER!!!"" whilst he and his comrades descend into <i>Apocalypse Now</i> territory. 

That aside, <i>Spec Ops</i> is a <i>surprisingly</i> good game. I'd highly recommend it. I'd thought gritty military shooters were pretty much done with things like ""characterization"" and ""storytelling"". (For those of you who <i>only</i> play gritty military shooters those terms mean ""grizzled American hero"" and ""Russian terrorists steal a suitcase nuke"".) Evidently not. The developers said in an interview that they were inspired by <i>Heart of Darkness</i> and... oh boy, were they ever."

Also, by way of a clever gentleman on i09:

As I left the theater I was trying to decide which glib pejorative best suits the film:

a.) Ridley Scott's ""Avatar"" - Because it's a very shiny, virtually exhaustive collection of hoary sci-fi cliches.

b.) Ridley Scott's ""Phantom Menace"" - Because it ""fleshes out"" the mythology of its source material in a thoroughly unnecessary, unimaginative, and ultimately disappointing way that almost makes the source material worse.

c.) Ridley Scott's ""Mission to Mars"" - Because it is basically a remake of that piece of crap, extruded through an Alien/Scott/Geiger filter.

In other news, whilst having an internet argument I looked up the average games owned per console for each of the current gen systems. Unsurprisingly, perhaps, 360 owners come in first at 12, PS3 owners have 10, and Wii owners have 6. Which is interesting to me because three years ago, it was 8, 6, and 5. Wii owners bought <i>one</i> game in the past <i>three years</i>? I hope it was a good one. Also, interestingly, Wii owners were the youngest (so much for it being your grandma's console), then Xbox players, while the average age of a PS3 owner is <i>over 44</i>. Wow. (Why do I suspect that many of these 50-somethings bought one to watch BluRays? There was a time when the PS3 was one of the cheapest BluRay 2.0 players out there.)

Nevermind that though. What really surprised me was that peeps only own around 10 games, on average. Made me get up self-consciously to count my own PS3 collection. I figured there were around thirty.

Nope, Chuck Testa! ...By which I mean, fourty-eight. Oh boy, do I ever not have a boyfriend.

So..... that was....

....an ending.

Yeah. 

Me: Oh well that was sort of interesting. Does kinda fit with the themes we're given, irrevocably changes life in the galaxy but life goes on... yep. What are people so angry about? Sure, it's pretty short. Sure, they gave you three endings instead of the 16-17 Bioware's lead designer was banging on about. Sure, your choices up until that point don't actually matter at all in any way shape or form.... but how could they <i>really</i> take <i>all</i> of your choices into account?

*checks internet*

I see..... 

Because <i>all</i> three endings are identical palette swaps. 

REAAAAAAALLLLLLLLLLLLLYYYYYY BIOWARE. REALLY.

FOR REALLY REALS.

I get that the green/blue/red light beams are all supposedly doing something rather different, but <i>surely</i> your production budget is higher than that.

Okay okay so I'm not about to throw myself off a cliff over it - while ME2 ranks as one of my favourite RPGs of all time, ME3 was... eh.... relatively decent and thus a similarly mediocre ending does not surprise or disappoint me - honestly had I not known that ALL THREE ENDINGS ARE IDENTICAL PALETTE SWAPS I would have in fact been moderately pleased with what I got. Most of what plays out in 3 are the ramifications of your decisions in 1, and, being stuck in the PS3 ghetto, I have no emotional attachments to those decisions whatsoever. For me they were a cartoon with a bad voiceover. But still, my renegade Shep was going to make a very different decision, and I was looking forward to seeing how that played out.

BUT NOW I ALREADY ~~~KNOW~~~. WHAT IS THE POINT.

The one thing that salvages it a little is the Indoctrination Theory going around. If that turns out to be correct, I will be pleased, because that was what my renegade!Shep was going to choose, and her being my preferred Shep, that would be most excellent.

Of course, some small part of me - after the Day 1 DLC fiasco - is pretty much convinced that they did this on purpose just to sell new endings, ending expansions, and epilogues.

<b>EDIT</b>: I almost forgot! THE MOST SATISFYING MOMENT OF ME3 -

Kai Leng: KWEH!!! I AR RANDOM CHINESE NINJA WITH SWORD IN YOUR SPACE EPIC I TROLL U SHEPARD, KEKEKEKEKEKEKEKE!!!!!!

Shepard: ARGH, NO, NOT THE FOURTH WALL!!!!!

James: *KAHBLAM*

Shepard: Well, that was anticlimactic. 

James: What can I say, loco, mine was bigger.

Shepard: .....

James: ....No homo.

...Seriously though, my big dramatic fight with Keruberosu-sama's tsundere ninja waifu  ended rather abruptly when the man happened to run too close to James, who then shot him in the face with his maximally upgraded shotgun, killing him instantly.

<i>Instantly</i>.

Felt a little bit like the ending.

Well... that was.... a fight?"

"event","So, what's up with me, eh? Been floating around LJ these days but not too much going on worth posting about, I suppose. Work, thesis, video games, same as has been going on for the past sixteen months - only a bit closer to finishing that second one.

Work: work is work. I show up, do it, get paid. 

Thesis: finished the paper I'll be presenting at Harvard next month. It was accepted. Flying out to BAWston on the 23rd. Been having regular talks with my supervisor now that I'm well into the actual writing phase. He's made me promise him I won't dump all 120 pages on his desk at once. 

Video games: just finished Deus Ex: Human Revolution. Was struck by how closely they kept to the true spirit of the original. To be sure there were mandatory boss fights that you had to, well, fight your way out of whereas the original let you sneak away or talk your way out of them, but none of them is anywhere near as difficult as the Internet Whine Machine has made them out to be (and yes I played it on hardest mode with only stealth/hacking augs as part of a pacifist run). And even whilst fighting, your sneaking capabilities will come in handy. The developers give you a vast array of solutions for any one problem, with plenty of XP for successful hacks/conversations to compensate for not killing everyone and gaining it that way. Plot was decent, endings were very much in the spirit of the original - that is to say, short and philosophical, and Pritchard, the Anti-Otacon (not that there's anything wrong with Otacon, but it's nice to see a male techie who is very sure of himself, proud of his abilities, unapologetic in his nerdery, and most decidedly does <i>not</i> admire the gruff manly hero), was my favourite character. His interactions with Jensen got a chuckle out of me almost every time.

<lj-cut text=""Another thing I really appreciated about the characters - a spoiler"">

Not only is Reed your ex-girlfriend, as opposed to your girlfriend, or wife, or daughter, or what have you, but she <i>stays that way</i>. She doesn't get back together with Jensen, and she doesn't get fridged. He saves her - and the other scientists - because it's his job, because it's the right thing to do, not because a sexual relationship with her is his reward. I'm not sure I've ever seen that before in any medium ever, let alone video games - if a male protagonist quests to save an ""ex"" of some kind, be it ex-girlfriend or ex-wife, he'll inevitably be rewarded with the reignition of their relationship (e.g. 2012). Or at the very least a new relationship of some kind.

Not Jensen. This story isn't about Jensen's need for romantic fufillment, even as a side-plot. It's about so many other things instead, and it's better for it. Jensen needs to come to terms with himself and his new augmentation, with the powers that are trying to change the world, with the relationship he has with his boss and coworkers, instead. Jensen is his own man. It doesn't matter if Reed gets back together with him or not. He knows she doesn't owe him that. He makes no sign he even <i>wants</i> that. And while I do play plenty of games/consume plenty of media without romance, it's often because either there's no time for it or there's literally no opportunity for it within the scope of the story. DX:HR is a full-blown 30+ hour <i>role-playing game</i> with no romance. Not even a hint.

Come to think of it, that's in the spirit of the original, too."

"event","I may be committing some kind of enormous nerd faux pas here, but is anyone else getting really, really <i>tired</i> of zombies?

I say this as something of a zombie aficionado, even. Purchaser of <i>World War Z</i> and long time fan of the <i>Resident Evil</i> franchise. Enjoyer of <i>Left 4 Dead</i>, <i>Shaun of the Dead</i> and <i>28 Days/Weeks Later</i>. 

But zombies are quickly reaching pop culture critical mass; whereas years ago I would have been excited to see the trailers for <i>The Last of Us</i> and <i>Dead Island</i>, all I can think of now is ""ugh, not more zombies"". Particularly in video games. Look, guys, I get it. Zombies are one of the few types of enemies in a real-world scenario that you can endlessly murderate without asking all sorts of uncomfortable questions (unless they're black zombies, as per RE5). Thus, they're a fan favourite. As a bonus, ""zombie apocalpyse survivor"" is one of the few genres into which you can throw just about any ragtag bunch of characters and let your imagination go wild, as opposed to the old Mysteriously Wealthy Treasure Hunter, Sepia Space Marine, or Hooah Hooah Real American Hero of Special Ops Task Force Ultra Rainbow Unit Extreme. But ""ragtag average joes"" is getting just as worn in the zombie genre as those aforementioned. Not to mention that we <i>still</i> never see older women, gays, or even Asians. Apparently those people taste too delicious to the ravenous hordes. It makes me start to wonder what the military is doing during the apocalypse, aside from generally faffing about (or, if 28 Days Later is to be believed, immediately turning to indiscriminate rape). Or what the CDC is doing. Or what anyone who <i>isn't</i> a ragtag group of suburban survivors. What about the folks in rural areas? What about the reserves? What about China? Or India? Could we possibly go somewhere that isn't an American/British shopping mall?

Or maybe I'm just old and curmudgeonly and I liked zombies before they were cool and all that. But, and particularly in video games, it's just getting fucking ridiculous."

<b>WARNING WARNING DANGER CLOSE FOR MW3 SPOILERS ON F!S TODAY.</b>"

"event","A discussion of narrative structure and predictability in DMC, DSRK, and CoD. <b>Spoilers for MW3</b>. (<lj user=""kyuusei""> this means you. Don't read this. Seriously. Unless you've picked up the game since we last spoke, in which case carry on.)

<lj-cut text=""Also known as, I called it"">

Like virtually everyone in fandom, I (with <lj user=""choffman""> usually) have my own headcanon when it comes to the series I love. It's hard not to flesh out the worlds presented to at least <i>some</i> degree more than is presented in the canon materials when one is writing fic or RPing or anything that involves engaging with the text beyond ""let's discuss what happened"". Even those who engage in meta-textual discussions tend to have their own imagined solutions to plot holes or answers to unanswered questions in canon - this is the same thing. 

One thing I've noticed about my own - and more than a few RP parters/readers/etc. have commented on - is that it is rarely contradicted by future installments. In fact, quite often it predicts revelations in future installments. I'm not going to gloat about my brilliance or magic powers of deduction here - I recognize that not everyone is <i>trying</i> to write something in line with canon, in fact some people are trying the opposite - but just point out that there are two simple reasons for this: close reading, and cheating.

Close reading is a concept I'm sure pretty much everyone will be familiar with, if not in name. Most authors subscribe to the notion that good writing involves foreshadowing, or at least some vague inclination of where the story is going next, and so if the reader/viewer/plays pays close attention and picks up on these, they'll know it too. Even if it's just remaining thematically consistent, a good close reader should have some idea of what can and can't happen next for the story to remain internally consistent. (Not that they always do - deconstruction, btw, is pointing out the inconsistencies. So there's two fancy words for very simple concepts.)

Thus, to me (and <lj user=""choffman"">, you might as well append that to all of this) the turn the DSRK sequel took was entirely predictable. By which I mean the shift in focus on the demons of modernity to the demons of the classical past. Why? Because it was strongly alluded to near the end of the first game, with the reveal that Sukuna-Hikona has possessed Munakata to take revenge on the humans and the Amatsu-kami. To an extent, this is a reference to SMTII, and as such ties in with the end of DSRK proper, where one finds the Kunitsukami having betrayed the Amatsukami to seal away their power, only to be betrayed in turn by the Center and sealed away themselves. But the grudge itself is a historical allegory for the Yayoi people (the modern day Yamato minzoku) arriving from the continent and driving out the original Jomon inhabitants (the modern day Ryukyuans and Ainu) to the fringes of the islands. In order to come to grips with modernity, Japan must come to grips first with the external and future threat (DSRK1) and then its own myths, prejudices, and internal conflicts (DSRK2). The race of ground dwellers threatened by extinction is a direct followup to the thread Sukuna-Hikona's appearance left dangling in the prequel.

Well that's a bit heavy, but what we took away from that is that, in future, Raidou is dealing more with classical gods and monsters, and less with robots from post-apocalypse. And we were right. Return to the countryside and all.

The ""cheating"" strategy is both easier and harder to explain. Perhaps better described as ""taking meta game realities into account"", it at first seems obvious, but it's shocking how many people don't do this. Take the case of Vergil, for example. The overwhelming fandom consensus, post-DMC1, seemed to be that he was a genteel and kindly old brother figure. If the fiction was slash, he was a sweater!seme in the truest sense. I can see where this comes from: Dante was devastated by what he had to do to Nelo Angelo, so he clearly cared about him. And since Vergil was captured and Dante was not, either Vergil was weaker than Dante or he protected him. Makes sense. We certainly didn't know otherwise.

...Or did we? Alex and I had always been puzzled by this interpretation, because what it failed to take into account is that the series is a <i>stylish action platformer</i> full of over-the-top personalities and flashy swordsmanship. How is a kindly but rather bland character going to hold up in the face of rocket surfing? Moreover, how is he going to be a threatening or charismatic opponent? Needless to say, the Vergil we did get fit the tone of the series a lot better. I know several long time fans who ragequit the series over this, too, or at least refused to acknowledge DMC3's existence. But, why? To me it was <i>obvious</i> this wasn't the Vergil we were going to get. It couldn't be. We were going to get someone who could challenge Dante: in swordsmanship, cheesy one-liners, flash, and attitude. (I also think the Vergil we did get is a much deeper and more nuanced character than the one that appeared in fandom besides, and helped to grow the fanbase exponentially between the games.)

In light of these two strategies, the two major character reveals for MW3 were predictable.

""Ever heard the old saying: the enemy of my enemy is my friend?""
""Price, one day you will find that cuts both ways.""

""You know what they say about revenge... you'd better be ready to dig two graves.""

First, Soap's death, while tragic and heartrending and awful, had to happen. The MW series has always been about how violence fuels endless cycles of revenge, that ends up bloodying ""every man it touches"". So long as Price and Soap sought a violent solution to the problem of Makarov, they were going to pay for it. The only possible ending for the series is with as many body bags filled as possible. Unless, of course, everyone sits down and finds a non-violent solution. ...But of course that's not going to happen. They want revenge. And on and on it goes. This is a story that's been told a thousand times before, but is still so effective because no one ever listens. This time, it'll be different. This time, we'll win. This time, it <i>has</i> to be done. And when Price calling for Soap was foreshadowed in the opening scene, we knew who was going to be the one to die.

Secondly, the ""Baseplate"" reveal. Why in the hell was the fandom so convinced that MacMillan was retired? So convinced, in fact, several of the CoD wikis had him listed as ""ret."" before MW3's release. Okay, okay, I do get it a little bit, as with Vergil - we see him take a grevious injury, and we don't see him again. If he doesn't recover, he'll have to retire (from the field at least). But... if he's retired, we're never going to see him again. The characters aren't going to go golfing (press X to throw break your clubs against a tree) or down to the pub to talk about the old times. If we see him again, he must <i>not</i> be retired. So either we never see him again, or we see him again, and given the time that's elapsed, he's probably been promoted. And if he isn't retired, given his relationship with Price, the only reason he would have to contact him (and thus remain in the story) is if he's helping him on the side. So, yes, that was completely in line with our headcanon, because it was entirely predictable. 

Any of the rest of you use these methods (or other methods) to predict something over which the rest of the fandom seemed to go vastly astray?"

"event","On F!S today there was a secret about how terrible the film <i>Juno</i> was and I found the response fairly heartening - please, out yourself secret maker, you're not the only one who thought it was trite hipster garbage - but there is one more example of trite hipster garbage I despise even more: <i>Scott Pilgrim vs. The World</i>. But I don't make secrets about my unpopular opinions, so you'll have to suffer through mine.

((Disclaimer: I have not read the comic. Maybe the comic is better.))

Unlike the much-lauded critical darling <i>Juno</i>, <i>Scott Pilgrim</i> was a box office bomb that received terrible reviews, so this isn't exactly an unpopular opinion, I know. And it's true that while <i>Scott Pilgrim</i>'s sins of trying too hard to be hip would only be worthy of internment in the level of hell where the writers would be crushed repeatedly by boulders, Diablo Cody should be frozen in the ninth level next to The Adversary himself to be disembowled for eternity. But in one respect, <i>Scott Pilgrim</i> betrayed me on a deeply personal level that tragically unhilarious teenaged girls whose taste in music ""mysteriously"" more closely resembles someone who lived an alternative lifestyle decades before she was born (making teenagers like things older people like makes them relatable! teenagers who like things that teenagers these days like are unrelatable, because all older people know that the things teenagers like these days are all crap): 

I was told - by both fans and advertisements - that <i>Scott Pilgrim</i> was a movie about video games.

It was not about video games.

Instead, it was a <i>Juno</i>-esque ""teenaged""/YA hipster romance with a handful of references to a few of the most popular games that came out twenty or more years ago. LOOK COINS COME OUT WHEN THEY DIE. That will salve the irreparable damage to your eardrums caused by the relentless assault of shitty indie music. To be honest, I almost turned off the film after the assault began in the opening credits. ...Come to think of it, I almost did the same during the opening of <i>Juno</i>. Perhaps the directors are doing me a favour by trying to dissuade me from subjecting myself to the cinematic equivalents to these unforgivably horrible opening tracks. Oh, video game references do indeed make their debut in the film, as do some bland anime nods, but not in a way that is clever or makes the film more enjoyable. Saying that <i>Scott Pilgrim</i> is a movie about video games is like saying <i>Black Hawk Down</i> is a movie about helicopters. To be sure, there are helicopters. Lots of helicopters. More helicopters than there are video games referenced in <i>Scott Pilgrim</i>. They serve as a vehicle to move the soldiers about the battlefield, as well as the central device upon which the plot is built. The movie is even named after a helicopter. But the film is <i>not about helicopters</i>; just as video game-esque fight scenes and powerups serve as a vehicle and plot device in <i>Scott Pilgrim</i> the film is <i>not about video games</i>.

There are films about video games. <i>Gamer</i> was about video games. And it managed to be about video games as they are now, not the nostalgic games of yesteryear. <i>Scott Pilgrim</i> has absolutely nothing to say about video games except ""hey, hey, you played these as a kid, right? look look, you played these as a kid! look at these things that you enjoyed as a child"". References to modern games are nowhere to be found, imparting on one the impression that the titular character is <i>not</i> a gamer, but rather <i>was</i> a gamer for a few years after his parents bought him a Nintendo. There aren't even any references to PC games from the same era. At best, if Scott Pilgrim <i>is</i> still a gamer, he is a Wii/DS owner who buys nothing but the remakes of remakes of Mario 30 and Zelda 47 and Final Fantasy 25 whilst lamenting the lack of creativity in the industry these days, where everything is a grey-brown shooter (but has never heard of <i>Mass Effect</i> or <i>Uncharted</i>, or if he has is pretty sure they're gritty jingoistic pro-American propaganda about World War II because they weren't made in Japan). If you need any more evidence of this latter interpretation, MovieBob - perhaps the most notorious example of a bigoted, ignorant Nintendophile in the whole of mainstream game criticism - absolutely <i>loved</i> the film. 

Leaving aside the laughable irony of a movie about a skinny young 20-something in tight jeans and retro gaming t-shirts who plays in an indie band that produces auditory sewage, lives with a trendy gay roommate, and lusts after a girl with multicoloured hair attempting to mock ""hipsters"" toward the end (which played out like Bill Gates ridiculing Albert Einstein for being a ""nerd"") the lack of anything to say about games in a ""video game"" movie, as well as the creator's apparent belief that video games peaked in popular culture around 1995, was a crushing disappointment that elevated the film from ""vile"" a la <i>Juno</i> in my eyes to ""obnoxiously vile"". 

After all, the promise that this was a ""video game movie"" was the only reason I sat through the opening credits in the first place."

"event","Recently watched <i>The Descent</i> with Alex, on <lj user=""fatpie42"">'s recommendation. If you haven't watched or even heard of it, it's about a group of female spelunkers in an unexplored cave, and as you might expect from the genre, horror movie shenanigans ensue. But not in an overly exploitative, degrading, or even boring way - the horror here is a healthy mix of psychological, visceral, and startle. Not for (or should I say for?) the claustrophobic. 

While we were watching it, Alex made the observation that he'd never seen an all-female cast in a horror film before (particularly an action-y horror film like this, I bet). I haven't either - even those films about girls' schools manage to stick a male boyfriend or teacher protagonist in there somewhere.

But, come to think of it, I've never seen a horror film with an all-male cast, either. Have you? I'm very curious to find one if it is out there. (I've seen <i>How I ended this summer</i> but I think it would be more properly categorized as ""thriller"" or ""suspense"" than horror.) To be sure, one would think that the lack of female characters would mean a lack of T&A, but really not all horror films are schlock - some are deeply cerebral. And while the women of <i>The Descent</i> are very attractive, they're also fully dressed the whole time, and none of the violence they endure is sexualized in the slightest. Perhaps more importantly, a mild element of homoeroticism is almost inevitable in a single-gender cast (<i>The Descent</i> doesn't escape this, either) which is why you see so many awkward romances shoe-horned into military and action films, for example. The men can bond deeply, and the film might revolve around the relationships between them, but the ""girl"" is always there for the requisite ""no homo!"". Lesbians, however, are hot.

So what about, film buffs? Any all-male cast horror films out there?"

"event","The new season of Deadliest Warrior is about halfway through and thus far it's been great. The finale promises to be a loltactular fantasy matchup of Vampires versus Zombies that I would recommend to anyone, even if material that poses the question of ""shotgun versus flamethrower"" isn't normally their thing. Perhaps I'll have a rundown of my thoughts on the matchups later, but the only reason I mention it now is in relation to a particular Cracked article on <a href=""http://www.cracked.com/article_19382_5-embarrassing-failures-history-class-turned-into-victories.html"">Embarassing Failures History Class Turned Into Victories</a> that more or less sums up what I've always thought about a given topic:

Spartans suck.

Yeah, yeah, yeah that's practically nerd hubris at this point, but I'd like to point out that I don't disagree with DW's ranking of the Spartan as Season One's Deadliest Ancient Warrior. At all. As demonstrated, their shield was incredible. And, well, that's something to be said for eugenics: big strong burly dudes every time (all of the weak artistic and intelligent children being dog food at the bottom of a cliff at this point). It was their <i>entire society</i> that was a complete failure.

Heck, they're not even that great as a military. They lost their most famous battle, and then lost like chumps to the Roman invasion, and that was the end of their civilization.

<lj-cut text=""More on why some of history's greatest losers were shitty at basically everything but ramming things with a shield and having lots of sex with boys"">

""What do you mean they lost their most famous battle????!!!!"" You say. ""There were only 300 of them against two million and they still bought time for the rest of Greece to rally and defend themselves!""

That first sentence is true. Both parts of that second sentence are false.

There weren't 300 of them - there were 7000. (The Cracked article quotes a more generous 3000, but this discounts a number of supporting forces.) They weren't all Spartans, to be sure - they were other Greeks. Remember those Thebians and Athenians Leonidas orders home in that movie about the man panties and the photoshopped abs? That didn't happen. They stayed to help out. The Spartans never got the chance to proudly state their profession as ""aah-ooohs"" to the masses of painters and carpenters and farmers and people who generally do other shit to make civilization possible.

There weren't two million Persians, either. By modern estimates (go on, fact check me on Wiki if you dare) there were maybe 70,000. And elephants, and ships, to be sure - but neither of these things is going to fit through the passes at Thermopylae, so they were irrelevant to the battle.

So, 7000 to 70,000 - that's ten to one! Still impressive, right? Not as much as it might sound. Many other battles in history have been fought (and won!) with those kinds of odds. And, as anyone who has ever fought a horde of monsters successfully through a doorway in Diablo knows, it's much easier to take on overwhelming odds when they're forced to funnel through a tight space that eliminates their ability to surround you, and worse, disadvantages them as the attacker and you as the advantaged defender (this is basic military tactics - the attacker must advance and mobilize so they cannot fortify; the defender can not only fortify by choose the ground on which to do so).

Not so impressive now, is it? Sounding a little bit more like something just about any well-trained military could do, isn't it? And, you know, possibly win. Which brings me to my second and most important point.

They lost.

<b>THEY LOST.</b>

The Persians outmaneuvered and flanked them, and they <i>lost</i>. At the cost of a 20,000 men in total compared to almost all of the Greeks. That's barely twice the number of casualties. The English at Agincourt would take that number, spit on it, and <i>win the battle</i>. And that's on an open plain! When are we going to see romanticized English yeomen in their underpants? They could beat the snot out of the Spartans. 

But they held them off to long enough to prevent the invasion of Greece, right? <i>WRONG</i>. As suggested in the article, Wiki the Second Persian Invasion of Greece. The Spartans <i>failed</i> to hold off the Persian army long enough to rally the defenders, and Xerxes went around sacking cities and looking fabulous to his heart's content. Eventual Grecian victory was served by those philosophy-loving artistic Greeks with day jobs. 

Now, having done the whole Japanese Studies thing I know there's nothing Japan loves quite the losing side, but I'd always found that a bit backward (clearly, the winner did <i>something</i> right) and identified more with the Western tendency to go with the victor. So why do we make an exception for Aah-oohs? Why are we so enamoured of these particular losers? From Rome to Machiavelli to Hilter to Frank Miller, we lurve them Spartans.

It can't be their military prowess; as mentioned, they lost their most famous battle and lost again to the Romans. Whatever superhuman feats have been posthumously ascribed to them, the only real concrete evidence we have nowadays is that they had great shields, they threw babies off of cliffs, and they were losers.

No, plainly, a lot of our romanticizing of the Spartans comes from their ""warrior culture"". The other aspects of their society - such as democracy - were shared by the rest of Greece and invented by other Greeks, so they can hardly claim the credit. There is some appeal of the ""hardcore"" training they had to endure as admirable, thinning out the weak and dedicating themselves to one singular pursuit: <strike>pederasty</strike> soldiering. How did they accomplish this? 

Well, a) as discussed, eugenics. (Which garnered them all kinds of praise from Der Fuhrer!) I sincerely hope Western civilization is over the eugenics thing at this point and no longer sees it as praiseworthy. Our strength is in the multitude of peoples and talents and ideas, not in a few really tough dudes easily outdone by someone else's cleverness or ability to think even a smidgeon outside the tough dude box.

And b) slaves. If every true Spartan male is fighting and every true Spartan female is having babies, who is farming? Building? Entertaining? Why, slaves of course! As much as the Spartans are lauded in literature and film for their principles of freedom and democracy and generally being better than those dirty Persians other other easterners with their gods and their slaves, the Spartans were both religious and had slaves. And unlike Roman slaves, these ones had no hope of freedom, no protections, and no means of advancement. 

If it doesn't bother you that the Spartans are romanticized losers, it really <i>ought</i> to bother you that these icons of Western free and democratic ideals embody to the core what Western civilization has considered the greatest modern evils: eugenics and slavery.

Plus it's just a shitty way of building a society for self-evident reasons (no one has any freedom at all: man = soldier, woman = baby maker, slave = slave, six toes = dog food). I'm sure you've noticed that many of our most lauded brilliant minds, be they innovators, artists, musicians, and scientists, were in some form disabled. (In Spartan society, Steven Hawking = cliff.) No intellectual traits were seen as merits. Not only does this kill your society's ability to adapt, evolve, and interact with other nations...

...But it also destroys the ability of a military to win. Those pencil-necked cliff-fodder babies come up with <i>military</i> innovations as well. Technological advancements that write the course of history. New tactics and ways to use them - who knows, a smart guy with eczema might have suggested Leonidas back up or look behind him. 

Besides, the whole professional soldier thing? Yeah, the Romans had that too. Without any cliff babies. They managed to put the best of the best to field whilst men with other talents could explore them. They had slaves, to be sure. (And democracy!) But their slaves had options. And we talk about Roman slaves, we talk about their love of bloodsport and their conquest and their positive and negative attributes. All we seem to mention when it comes to the Spartans is how zomg awesum they are at defending us from the ravening hordes of the east. You know, those ignorant Persians. The ones who would continue to advance learning and knowledge and develop medicine and the scientific method whilst Europe was shitting its collective pants for 700 years. 

It says something truly, utterly, and depressingly ugly that we can criticize the Romans whilst idolizing the Spartans, when the difference between them is that the Romans were more successful, more democratic, freer, and did not practice eugenics as an institution. That they're the ambiguous force in history and the fascist Spartan losers are laudable heroes is unflatteringly reflective of our society. We all get it, Frank Miller. You don't have to repeat the line about how our technology could never have been a product of ""their"" backward ""eastern"" civilization. It was all about the Spartans defending us against those damn dirty arabs. That's why they're heroes. 

Thing is, ""our"" technology could never have been a product of Spartan civilization, either. Leonidas - like the rest of them - would happily have punted our innovators off a cliff. Or, if they were healthy, forced them to dedicate their entire lives to military training rather than learning. 

I am not Spartan; I am not descended from Spartans. My actual ancestors? Responsible for some of the world's greatest accomplishments, as well as some of history's greatest atrocities. No need to lie about them or misrepresent them. The Spartans are not ""us"" to me, and the Persians are not ""them"". <i>300</i> was about two fascist totalitarian slave-states completely unrelated to me kicking the snot out of each other in leather underpants for two hours.

"event","Dear fellow gamers,

If you cannot beat a certain part of a game, it is not because that part is ""broken"", or ""unfair"". All but the trashiest of shovelware is playtested for thousands (and sometimes tens of thousands) of hours before release. All of those playtesters played the same part you did, and they did not report this to their managers - which is their <i>profession</i>, so one would imagine that if a part was broken, they would. Indeed, those things that are truly broken or unfair tend to be patched.

<b>It is because the mode you are playing on is too hard for you.</b>

If you cannot beat a game on hard, no matter how many times you've beaten hard mode in other games, this hard mode is too hard for you. If you cannot beat a game on normal, no matter how badly you want to think of yourself as the ""average"" gamer, normal mode is too hard for you. If easy mode is too hard for you, then you're why they put very easy in most games these days. If you cannot beat a game on very easy, that game is too hard for you. You need to practice and get better if you want to beat it.

Some games are harder than others. If you can beat the default setting of one game it does not mean that mode is for you in all games of that genre. It's a decent indicator, true, but do you know what the best indicator of your appropriate maximum difficulty level is? 

Whether or not you can beat the game.

"event","I know I addressed this to some degree in my post about matriarchies in fantasy, but frankly, as lame as his views on fanfiction may be, I find GRRM's decision to write about a semi-realistic medieval Europe analogue and all that entails; to use his female characters to confront, negotiate, and in some cases overcome their patriarchal societies to be more progressive and feminist than many ""progressive"" fantasy series that state than in their worlds, men and women are equal, because magic. 

Why not write a medieval analogue of one of the many matrifocal, matrilineal, or egalitarian societies that have existed throughout history and continue to exist? Why is it always because a magical macguffin did it? The argument that ""what, he can have dragons and ice zombies, but it would be too much of a stretch to have an egalitarian society, would it?"" implies that, like dragons and ice zombies, and egalitarian society is something that exists only fantasyland. 

Not only is that not true, but how exactly are we supposed to draw inspiration from it? We don't have magic. And if you're using magic as a metaphor for technology, that certainly hasn't always meant the destruction of patriarchy either - in many cases it's simply meant new mechanisms for oppression and the control of women's bodies. In one TRPG setting the authors felt they had to ""explain"" why their setting was egalitarian and appealed to magic directly: that it was hard for ""daddy"" to push ""mommy"" around when she could shoot lightning at him.

Sure, and in our society she could shoot bullets at him. And yet domestic violence remains a serious issue. Technology didn't ""magic"" it away. Until the underlying social structures are dealt with, ""magic"" won't solve anything. 

The same TRPG uses a much better justification for why there are (and always have been) women in the non-magical military: the belief that riding a horse causes sterility in males. As a result, all men ride side-saddle and could never mount a cavalry charge. And heck, why not? We've seen countless examples of completely ridiculous sex-based prohibitions that have no basis in biology in just about every society throughout history. This is a perfect example of excellent use of speculative fiction. Plus, the horse mitigates virtually all of the size/strength advantage that some men have, we know from real life that women can ride just as well as men can, so the readers will be convinced it would work.

Similarly, I would have given so much respect to Lynn Flewelling if the Skalan prophecy of invincibility so long as a queen sits on the throne was not <i>literally true</i>. As it stands, it's just another magical macguffin, despite all of the interesting social implications. What should have happened? We should have discovered in the Hidden Warrior series that in fact it was dreamed up by a ruler in order to pass power down to her/his daughter rather than an incompetent son, and propped up for centuries after by female generals and border lords: report losses every time a man tries to seize power. It's not like someone's filming it on their cell phone, people. They could even have arrangements with the invaders that they will allow them to raid up to a certain point if a king sits on the throne; when a queen does they pay a small tribute that is forfeit if they raid, and will be met with real military force. Confronting the real machinery of social control would have been very interesting.

But these works don't challenge anything at all. The message is that without magic, equality is impossible. 

No, thanks. I'll take my dragons and ice zombies and the hope of successfully confronting patriarchy.

(Mad props forever to authors like Kristen Britain who don't use a magical justification for equality, or to those who don't feel it requires a ""justification"".)"

"event","I've come to the realization that, while I'm getting all kinds of reading and writing practice in Japanese these days, my conversations are relegated to A) simple daily chats with people I already know, and B) language instruction for beginners. And while I enjoy chatting with my instructors and peers we don't really cover anything more than movies/general welfare/how the local sports team is doing (GO 'NUCKS!!!), and teaching others is always enlightening, I'm not really picking up words I don't already know. 

One of the most fluent non-native speakers in my acquaintance (who can hold a conversation on anything under the sun but can't read a magazine, oh Japan) told me that he picked it up mostly from TV dramas. Now, that's a fine idea. Living language as it happens and all that. There's just one problem:

I hate television.

I don't judge people who like it - there are some great shows out there, I know, I've downloaded a few - but I find too much of it trivial and inane and empty and always about topics I couldn't give less of a shit about with characters I can't relate to. I can't <i>stand</i> commercials. And Japanese television tends to be everything I hate about television turned up to 11. When I was living there all I could stomach was NHK news and a few episodes of a serial about the coast guard, until everybody started bawling all the time (I might have finished it if I'd downloaded it, so I could just fast-forward through those parts).

But there has to be <i>some</i> Japanese tv I would like, right? After all, there's <i>some</i> American TV I enjoy. Like <i>Game of Thrones</i>, <i>Band of Brothers</i>, and <i>Deadliest Warrior</i>. I used to like <i>House</i>. <i>Supernatural</i> has some good episodes. So! Those of you who watch J-TV, any recs? I'll take movies at this point, too (senpai had the recommendation of <i>Confessions</i> - which was excellent, by the way). 

<b><u>Here's what I like:</u></b>
-Action (any variety - pew pew or fisticuffs or parkour or diving vehicles over the speed limit, doesn't matter)
-History (also any variety, the more period-accurate the better, especially if I learn something new)
-Intrigue (also enjoy being made to think)
-Politics (ditto)

"event","So, yes, a few days ago someone supposedly posted ""leaks"" about the upcoming <i>Modern Warfare 3</i> all over the major gaming sites of the internet, and while Activision has confirmed that some of these are true, they've confirmed that some of them aren't. In order to avoid spoiling myself with those tidbits that are true, and to spare myself anxiety over those that aren't, I haven't read any of the leaks. At least nothing about the plot. The 32-maps + the return of Spec Ops sounds marvelous, though.

Instead, I have my own conspiracy theories about things that may or may not come to light in the third game, which make sense of the events of the second. I've discussed these at length with both of my roommates, who've also played the campaign to completion, but if you've got anything to add/any observations we've missed that would confirm or debunk these, feel free to comment.

Spoilers for MW2, though like my posts about F.E.A.R. I'm guessing that if you haven't played it yet you don't intend to ;3

<lj-cut text=""In a sentence: It was always about Price."">

The CoD fandom has done a fairly thorough job of elucidating General Shepherd's relationship to Makarov, and the purpose of planting Allen and the evidence that an American aided the terrorist in order to go to war. But one thing they haven't done, at least to my knowledge, is examine Shepherd's relationship to Task Force 141.

First off, we know that Shepherd is in command of TF141 - ostensibly because he is in command of all of the special operations forces in the area. How do we know this? Because he's in command of not only TF141, but the Army Rangers and Shadow Company, too. We know from S.S.D.D. that Shadow Company are Shepherd's handpicked elite; presumably American soldiers drawn from regiments like the 75th, just like Allen.

So where does that leave the Task Force, if Shepherd already has his group of handpicked elites? Unlike Shadow Company, who all wear American flag patches, TF141 is international, consisting of most English-speaking NATO countries. Each of these soldiers answers to Shepherd, ostensibly, but would answer first to their respective armed forces. These aren't really ""his"" soldiers to begin with, he already has ""his"" elites, and furthermore none of the officers of TFT141 are American - they're British. 

You probably see where I'm going with this. Shepherd, again as we see in S.S.D.D., and a number of other levels, in commentary from Dunn, Foley (who does not contradict Dunn), the Task Force, and even the Air Force's refusal to comply with the letter of his commands, is <i>not</i> highly-regarded. He is known for his lack of value on his men's lives, something Dunn tells us explicitly and we see confirmed by his actions. This could well be a result of the events in MW1 - where we learn that Shepherd was in charge of the doomed incursion of Shock and Awe - or he could always have been like that. Either way, this is why he <i>needs</i> a private company of bodyguards. 

((Tangent: one of the coolest things about MW2 was how Shadow Company had better and more evasive AI than the rest of your enemies. Must've been hell to program, but it was so worth it. Most games make enemies ""harder"" by giving them more damage input or absorption. But is that realistic in a shooter? Not really. IW's take was fantastic.))

So Shepherd doesn't command much loyalty from his own troops in the first place, he knows it, <i>and</i> these are foreign soldiers. I would think it's safe to say that Shepherd <i>does not trust the Task Force</i> long before they stop trusting him. 

And Shepherd's lack of trust is not misplaced. Soap is, I believe, and will attempt to support, simply using his resources to get what he really wants: Captain Price. 

Here's what tipped me off, and was never adequately explained in game: they infiltrate the gulag to free Prisoner 627 to use as ""bait"" to lure out Makarov, or so Soap says, but they never actually put his plan into action. In fact, they never even try to put this plan into action. Honestly, it doesn't seem like they ever intended to. As soon as Price is freed - in other words, after Soap has used the resources at Shepherd's command as a general in the US military to free Price - they immediately disregard his orders and rush off to do something else entirely. 

This is probably the single largest piece of evidence I can use in support of my theory: they never used Price the way they said they intended to, nor did they ever try. In fact, they <i>lied</i> about why Makarov might want ""Prisoner 627"": Price wasn't the one who killed Makarov's ""hero"" Zakhaev. Soap was. They had the ""bait"" all along. So at the very least Soap lied about that part, absolutely. It's possible that they dropped the ""bait"" idea because of who Prisoner 627 turned out to be, but nevertheless they still lied about why Makarov would want him.

And why would they do that, unless they knew who Prisoner 627 was? Why would Soap fabricate a justification to retrieve that prisoner unless it was someone very important?

Watch the video of their reunion again. There's no question that Price is shocked. But Soap? Emotional, sure. Certainly not astounded, even though this is clearly an amazing coincidence. Or it would be if this wasn't the whole point in the first place.

(Of course it's reasonable to assume that the other members of the SAS in the Task Force, like Ghost, are in on it - they know who Price is, and Ghost was involved in Rojas' interrogation, and Ghost was in charge of locating Price at the gulag. Could this be <i>because</i> he knew what the questioning was really about, and who ""Prisoner 627"" might really be listed as?)

But that's not all. The careful observer will notice that the route to Price has been marked ahead of time: play the level again, and look for those little green spray-painted boxes. Yes, they appear elsewhere in the series, but they're always there to mark a path. Who has done this in the middle of a Russian prison, and why?

Why? Recall how MW1 ended. Price was not captured by the enemy that we saw on screen - the Loyalists, led by Kamarov, had flown in for the rescue. What happened after that isn't clear, possibly that he was taken on a different transport, but he was taken by <i>Loyalists</i>. And the Russian Civil War wasn't won by military force, we learn, but rather public opinion - it's entirely likely that those Loyalists are now with the Ultranationalists. Not in any positions of importance, of course. That's not where you'd put your political enemies, even if they are your fellow countrymen. Perhaps you'd put them somewhere out of the way - like Siberia. Something irrelevant and humiliating like guarding a prison in Siberia.

Now, Price is known to these former Loyalists, and what's more so is Soap (and possibly Ghost). Which brings me to my next point: Soap spends an <i>awful</i> lot of time off-screen in Cliffhanger. Ostensibly supporting you from an elevated position, but in reality he stops doing that after one kill. And then beats you to the hangar even though you've supposedly had a head start. Once inside, whilst Roach gets the ostensible objective, the ACS module, Soap remains behind to tinker with the captured satellite. But why? What is he doing with it? Why was he already there when he told you he was providing you with overwatch (which he wasn't)?

My answer: he's there to pick up the information a former Russian Loyalist has left him about Price's location. It would be dangerous if not impossible to get this information to him by any other means, but if he's just happened to sneak into Russia, how could it ever be traced?

But hold the phone, what about Rojas? Why did they go all the way to South America? Well, for one, they needed an excuse to use Shepherd's resources to rescue Price. ""Oh yeah, we just happened to know the guy who killed Zakhaev and where he is"" wouldn't cut it - remember, Shepherd already mistrusts them. Remember who sends them after Rojas? It's Shepherd himself. Soap and the Task Force go along with it, with this plan in mind: no matter what Rojas tells them about Makarov, what Shepherd will learn is the location of a man who can draw him out. With nothing else to go on and no reason (yet) to doubt them, Shepherd agrees to it.

I get the distinct impression that the British commanders (MacMillan?) tacitly, if not outright, approve of the ""use American resources to rescue Price"" plan, because not only is he one of their own, he's clearly picked up important intelligence while incarcerated. Like Russian nuclear launch codes. Notice that Soap doesn't even join you in Contingency, and the rest of the troops aren't informed of its purpose (see: Ghost flipping out over the launch). Plausible deniability. 

So, now the elite soldiers he didn't even trust in the first place have disobeyed a direct order <i>and</i> clearly lied to him - and Shepherd's itching to dispose of anyone who might tip his hand in the first place. This is why Shepherd ""betrays"" the Task Force, and tries to have them all killed. They're disloyal, they're dangerous, and they could undo everything. And he's already got his elites. In this light his actions make so much more sense. 

It was always about Price.

(That leaves one last mystery of course - what is Craig Fairbrass doing in MW3? I sincerely doubt it's ""some other random character, trolololo"" and it's certainly not ""generic British MP announcer #4"" as he stated he was working on the game for three <i>months</i>. But who else could it be. This, combined with Robert Bowling's statement that Ghost ""isn't exactly dead - you'll see"" had many convinced that this was going to be a prequel game, but it isn't. Is it possible Ghost is still alive?

Well, in a word: yes. He was shot in the chest with a high calibre round, true, but he was also wearing body armour. And we know from the no-clippers - the ones who showed us that Gaz was shot in the shoulder, not the back of the head - and the cutscene itself that Shepherd poured the gasoline mostly on Roach; only Ghost's arm was on fire. Toad and Archer were unaccounted for, so it's possible they doused the flames and provided medical aid.

It's also possible, since Shepherd and Shadow Company left immediately afterward, that some of Makarov's men who weren't on the estate at the time arrived shortly, and now Ghost is their prisoner. 

And since the game ended with Price and Soap gunning for Makarov, it's possible they could encounter him there. It would certainly bring Makarov's ominous statement about how the enemy of my enemy is my friend ""cuts both ways"" to a poetic climax.)"

It's been a surprising amount of fun so far - I haven't played a puzzle platformer in ages - even if I have to set the audio to Deutsch now and again because I've had my hourly quota of Nathan Drake's ""witticisms"".

"event","Maybe because I am not an artist I do not understand your mysterious ways of mystery, but to all my artist friends out there: what is the point in drawing a ""female version"" of a canon character that looks absolutely nothing like the original character?

I mean, I get why you find so many ""female versions"" of characters that are no more than glorified pinups with vaguely similar haircuts - that reason being teh hawt - but some of these ladies are fully clothed. They just... have nothing in common with the original, be it in terms of facial structure or hairstyle or overall appearance or even a lack of iconic outfit pieces or scars. The DSRK fandom was surprisingly good about this, but other fandoms... not so much.

Case in point, there's an artist on pixiv that does a <i>masterful</i> job of making she!versions of the CoD characters. Soap's haircut? <i>Surprisingly</i> hot on a girl. And while she's given female military haircuts to the rest of the cast, she's kept their overall appearance, kit, and iconic articles like Ghost's mask the same (she even made fem!Price look <i>old</i>, le gasp). Yet I find other artists who draw ""female Ghost"" as some kawaii nyguuu anime five-year-old with purple hair and pink eyes (when in the game Ghost has brown hair and blue eyes?) who isn't even wearing the same kit, who doesn't even have <i>the iconic fucking skull mask that is the character's signature item</i>. And it's not like she's in a bikini - she's in full BDU - so I don't think this is fap material.

(To those of you who don't follow the CoD fandom and don't know who the fuck I'm talking about, this would be like a <b>Female Seishirou without the ""eye""</b>.)

How is this a ""female"" Ghost and not just some original character you made up? Goddamn fantards, this makes all the fem!MacMillan in cleavage-baring ghillie suit artists look like they're <i>trying</i>."

Why has this been turned into an East versus West dichotomy? There are innumerable strict parents and high-achieving young people of European descent. My own parents would not accept anything below an A. For many of the rest of the top grade earners in my high school it was the same, regardless of background. Being naturally brilliant or disciplined cannot compete with someone who has the smarts <i>and</i> the work ethic; anyone with an ounce of sense knows this.

The only criticism I have of Amy Chua's parenting method is her refusal to allow her daughters to participate in any sports. Not only do sports encourage a healthy and active lifestyle, they have been shown to improve the self-esteem and body image of children (particularly women and girls) and that this improvement lasts a lifetime. Also, non-participation in athletics precludes them from receiving a number of prestigious awards, including becoming Rhodes Scholars. (That said my parents refused to let me study art or music, viewing it as Amy Chua does athletics - a waste of my time better spent studying.)

However, something those lauding her eldest daughter's acceptance to both Yale and Harvard have overlooked is this: <b><i>both</i> of her parents are Harvard Law alumni and Yale Law professors.</b>

<i>Really</i>? The daughter of not one but two Yale Law professors who graduated from Harvard was accepted to Yale and Harvard? 

You <i>don't</i> say.

Not that it isn't an accomplishment to be admitted to these schools regardless, I'm sure, but between this and the elite private preparatory schools this girl's parents forked out for her to attend and the countless thousands of dollars funneled into her music lessons and academic tutoring that the mother admits she's had, this achievement somehow seems less than astounding. The girls themselves also admit that their upbringing wasn't as harsh as their mother has made it out to be in order to sell a book (also hardly shocking).

Instead of asking themselves if their parenting is too Western or not Eastern enough, what parents should be asking themselves is this:

-Is my child's education their first priority during their student years? (If no, it should be.)

AND

-Am I a Yale Law professor with a degree from Harvard and scads of money? (If no, your child's chances of getting into Yale may not be as high as Amy Chua's regardless of your parenting practices.)"

"event","I have come to the depressing realization that 90% of what makes games like Demon's Souls (or even DMC3 or Shinobi for that matter) isn't the mastery of technical skills, but rather the lack of checkpoints. It is not that you must be <i>able</i> to beat all enemies, it is that you must be able to beat <i>all</i> enemies in any given sitting, at least once. This is what made the old platformers difficult (e.g. Mario) and even moreso if they gave you a limited number of lives to beat the entire game. Super Mario World, with its save points, was infinitely more enjoyable, because it meant that you did not have to beat the entire <i>game</i> in a single sitting.

Save points are a necessity for grownups with jobs and other obligations, who might be called upon to put the controller down at any given moment. Similarly, if Demon's Souls had checkpoints, I'm sure I would have beaten it already. Of course, the lack of them, combined with the fact that you lose all progress (in the form of Soul Points) if you don't go back to the Nexus (and lose all physical progress in the level) once in a while to spend them before you die. This requires a certain level of mental and emotional discipline that games with checkpoint mechanics lack. The pure mechanical difficulty of these games is on par with any given, say, shooter (and probably less than some on their ""hardest"" modes, precisely <i>because</i> you don't lose all progress when you die and thus don't get as frustrated when you approach a given gunfight for the umpteenth time).

Of course, in lieu of mental and emotional discipline, most people just end up farming. In their defense, I can see the appeal of replacing anguish with tedium. You live the way you want to live, I suppose."

"event","There's been a fair bit published on gaming sites lately with respect to this topic, with people by and large clamouring to see more diversity in games: not just more female protagonists (though that's a large part of it), but also simply more protagonists that aren't blue-eyed brown-haired white men in their 30s. I wonder if this will result in real change; right now it's hard to tell. The defense these companies use for this decision is always ""marketing"" (if they bother to defend it at all). Even in games where you can play non-white, non-male protagonist, such as Mass Effect, the brown-haired white dude's the one on the box.

But is this really the case? I should think not. The largest single demographic of console gamers is women between the ages of 18-24. Even if it wasn't, this defense is pure tripe - it's not as if Samus, or Mario, or Link sell any less because they're too young, too old, or too female. The insinuation that the 30-something white male is the most ""relatable"" is utterly insulting. A psychic Space Marine from the distant future isn't more relatable to me because he has a penis. I mentioned this problem to a roommate, who parroted that this decision was likely made because most gamers <i>are</i> white males. Now, this isn't even remotely true. Even leaving the Asian markets out of it, if women alone are 40% of console gamers, the racial diversity amongst male gamers put the ""white male"" well below a majority.

How bitter and outright sulky he became when I pointed this out, however, was far more telling - far closer to the heart of the issue than ""relatability"". He is, of course, a 30-something white male. The mere thought that a protagonist that was exactly like him was not something he was rightfully owed - that he was not inherently the most ""relatable"" type of human being - was an unpleasant realization. That's the rub; our entire civilization is fraught with male and white privilege, and he's been taught that the vast majority of heroes will be exactly like him his entire life. 

Of course, you can't paint every 30-something white male with the same brush. Many of those are the ones clamouring for more diversity. My roommate himself prefers a female Shepard for precisely that reason. Another reason I think the ""marketing"" excuse is bunk is that, if most protagonists looked like me I would be good and tired of it by now myself. Sure, I'm not a man or transgendered or gay or Asian or what have you - but nor am I a psychic Space Marine. I don't <i>have</i> to play someone exactly like me.

Heck, it's not as if I make characters that look like me when I can create my own protagonist. I'm a wimpy academic; my fem!Shep is an elite operator. As such she looks the part, complete with heavily muscled jaw, scars, and buzzcut. My male!Shep looks like a '70s porn star with a bad red dye job. Why? It looked hilarious. R6 Vegas - rightly, I think - doesn't give you a choice about making your elite operator look tough; s/he's going to be butch, but everything else is up to the imagination. My Bishop's got darker skin and black hair because it looks the most badass with cammoflage facepaint. My Fallout 3 protagonist is quirky, nerdy - she's got black skin and pink hair in pigtails. My Demon's Souls heroes are an Eastern albino Templar and a Southern Hunter. They don't have to look like me for me to relate to them.

From what I've seen the 30-something white males I know are the same way. So why do we <i>really</i> have so many protagonists that look (and even more or less act) exactly the same way?"

"event","One thing I've noticed, having watched every installment of Extra Credits thus far? The CoD series makes it into the ""doin' it right"" category in virtually every episode (barring a few, such as ""True Female Characters"" for obvious reasons - though when they do feature female characters they're wearing historically or contemporarily accurate military fatigues and are as competent as anyone else, which is saying more than I can for most other shooters out there). This isn't just an 'in my opinion' thing - the EC folks mention CoD as an example to follow in everything from a good reward system, good pacing, good storytelling (Yahtzee agrees), good tutorials, and even good musical scoring.

The latest one is particularly apt: I have always loved the CoD tutorials. The two CoD dev teams have different ideas about what makes a good tutorial, but in this case they're both right. It's a shooter; it isn't as if there are a lot of controls to master. Thus, Treyarch simply begins with a relatively easy mission in which your team heavily supports you. You learn by doing. I don't know of anyone who has complaints with this - if the opening mission is too difficult for you, you need to lower the difficulty. It's as simple as that. It lets experienced players start the action right away, too.

Infinity Ward thinks differently. The Modern Warfare games have formal tutorial missions, but what makes them <i>great</i> tutorial missions is that they're still part of the narrative. In a much richer way than ""Welcome to boot camp, private"" - in MW and MW2 the tutorials introduce you to the characters you'll be close to for the remainder of the game - and their personalities - and serve to set up the basic plot. As the character maneuvers his way through training camp he hears snippets of dialogue from other characters, too, much of which is amusing, clever, or ominous. And the tutorial serves the function of testing the player's skills - based on their time in the introductory course, the game recommends a difficulty setting, which in my experience is fairly accurate (i.e. my pit scores were roughly in line with how I progressed from Regular, to Hardened, to Veteran). This tutorial can take several minutes if the player wants to experience absolutely everything in it, including easter eggs, but experienced players can not only blow through it in seconds if they choose, they can get trophies/achievements for superb times in the training run. This certainly kept my interest despite multiple playthroughs. It isn't skippable, but nor does it need to be.

Anyone else got a tutorial they'd like to recommend? FF7 followed Treyarch's philosophy of simply starting with an easy mission (FF7, in my view, also has one of the greatest opening sequences of any video game - as did FF6). DSRK did it more like IW: teaching basic controls whilst establishing the mood, atmosphere, basic plot, and major characters (Raidou and Gouto). Chrono Trigger and Fallout 3 take a different tack altogether - these are vast, impressive games, and the introduction is long and story-rich, but still entertaining and full of player input that will be important later on, in order to immerse the player in the world they'll be experiencing for the next 50 hours or more. They do cover the basic mechanics as well, but you'll hardly have noticed. This simply wouldn't work in an explosive action thriller like CoD, nor would it work for a game like Nocturne where a sense of disorientation and unfamiliarity is key. God of War is, of course, famous for its tutorials - cinematic high points of the games that leave you eager for more. Any other noteworthy games you think should make this list?"

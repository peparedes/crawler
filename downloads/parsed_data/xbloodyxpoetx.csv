"event","What is the meaning of love?What is the meaning of hate?It is different to everyone.But, is what we all know, real?Does it truly exist?Without good and evil, the world would not be what it is today.There would be no balance...it would be complete anarchy.So, they must be real.I have come to this conclusion.I do not like emotions.They fuck up your reality.

They twist your reality all up.Emotions are simply an illusion.For instance, being in love, or infatuated with someone...For the time that you are in love with them, everything is so perfect.In my experience, you feel so great, while everything is in chaos.Then, something ALWAYS happens, and you fall out of love.It hurts, when you hit rock bottom.Your world has been completely turned inside out.What you knew to be real, was in fact, fake.It is a crazy phenomena.Emotions tear you up.

Emotions just confuse you.They throw you into duality.I wish I didn't have them.They cause me pain, and anger.Love...is just an illusion.

Is life just an illusion?Is death just a dream?What is REAL, and what is FAKE?"

"event","Wow, has it been a long time since I updated my livejournal.A lot has changed, again.

I moved out of my house on Sep. 26.I am not going back.I told my parents it was not a personal attack to them.I just wanted my freedom, space, and independence.It got ugly...my parents made it personal.They disagree with me...they love to fight me now.Lots of ugly hurtful things were said...and are still being said.I don't want to get into it...

I lived in Henrico with Shelly and Ralston for a few days, after I left.That shit didn't end happilly.I got attacked by Shelly.She did not want me in ""her"" apartment.She didn't even talk to me about how she felt.At 4 am one morning, she jumps on me, tries to choke me, and slaps me.I learned that night, that she was schizophrenic.JOY!!Crazy people...

I then lived in a truck with my friend (at the time) Alfy.We have been more or less living in his truck ever since.But, no need to worry.We have been visiting peoples houses to shower, sleep, and do other random vital things.

I have a job at Papa John's.I get paid around 15 an hour.So, people, ORDER PIZZA, to see me because you love me.lol.After a while of saving my money, I am going to get an apartment with my boyfriend Alfred.We hope to live in Powhatan, or Midlothian.Whatever is cheaper, and more convenient.

Yes,I am dating Alfred.It is kinda odd for me.I have never had any feelings for guys whatsoever.Other than friendships...He makes me feel happy, and comfortable in my skin.No one has been able to do that.We are happy.

I had to leave Midlothian High.I have not dropped out of school.I am still hoping to get my diploma now.I need to get stability first.Then, I can figure out where I am going to go after that.

It was worth it to sacrifice nearly everything for this.I am happy.I cannot explain how...I am in the middle of a deep hole.I put myself there, I know.But, I couldn't be happier.I think I like to fight...

That is what life is to me...a battle.I will not lose.

I will write more at a later date."

"event","1. Choose 10 people from your friends list at random.
2. Write something about/to each of them.
3. Don't tell anyone who the statements are about. Good or bad. No matter how they beg!

1.You were my best friend for so long.We have been through so much.We made so many promises.They have all been broken.We are torn apart.Fear, ignorance, pride, and shame tear us apart.I hope we can become close again.Like we were 7 years ago.I miss you.

2.I want to thank you for your support, and caring words.You gave me a reason to live, and to stop some bad habits of mine.I will always remember the times we have had together.I will never forget how I could see into your soul, and make you smile.I will never forget looking into your eyes, and feeling so great.You kept me alive, when the pain is ALL I KNEW.You helped me become happy, and healthy.Although we are no longer together, I wish you happiness.I hope he is all that you ever wanted.You deserve to be complete...I hope the distance will bring us closer...I hope our worlds will coincide sometime soon...

3.Boy, we have a lot in common.We have been through the same shit.We have taken the abuse.We have been broken for so long...No one else seems to understand how emotions will tear us apart.We are not like them...we feel things differently.Together, we are good for each other.Everyone is against you now.""We"" are not...""We"" will make a famly together...I hope the shit that follows you around goes away soon.You don't need it...not anymore.

4.We have known each other from the 6 grade.Damn...we sure have changed a lot, huh?Thankyou for always being there.No matter how stupid I got.Thankyou for remembering me when I was all alone.You have seen me through the good and bad times...You have seen through everything to ME.How?Can you tell me how you did that?I hope we will always be there for each other.I hope we can be close again, like we were that summer a few years back.

5.We met one fateful day in Midlothian prison.We shared our deepest secrets.I was there for you when he died...when you cried.I was the only one to understand you.You knew everything about me for a while...until I learned a little bit more about myself.I changed, as I departed my old self.You then decided to say you were embarressed to know me.You tore me apart.You know who you are.It goes both ways, hun.You instill anger in me...I will never be able to get what we had, back.Thanks for not being a friend.Blaming ME for everything.

6.For a year and a half, you were life support to me.You were my everything.I never felt as happy as I was with you.I want you back...or atleast, who I think you still are, back.We have been down the same road...at different times in our life.We have changed...in the same way.I wish that you could see me now...I wish I didn't scare you off...I wish you didn't leave me for drugs and Jacob 2 years ago.I wish, I wish, I wish...upon the night sky.I still look up at you through the clouds, and past dusk, until tomorrow, hoping you are doing the same...I still love you.

7.Mwahahaha.Jesus is still attacking me...along with the fake Pepto Bismol.IT IS NOT PINK BISMUTH, IT IS PEPTO BISMOL, YOU DUMB CHEAP BASTARDS!!I love you.We laugh at anything together.We could laugh at a wall.It would be OK in our world.We should really throw ourselves into Tucker's...a 2 for 1 deal!!We can laugh while on pills, just like we always wanted!Damn crazy person.PILL POPPER!!

8.You have changed me in ways no one else could have.It is not a bad thing, either.I guess they were all right...I needed to seek new souls to figure out what I am.How did you do this?Are you some type of magician??I love you anyways...

9.You gave me a place to stay.You gave me advice.You paid your respects.I have known you since I was in the 9 grade.I just wish we could get closer.Trust is something to not be broken...I know.I have dealt with the wrath of unfaithfulness to the extreme.Will you trust me??

10.Although I just met you, it seems that I have known you in another place and time.Maybe I lived in a past life with you, soul mate.We feel everything in the same way.I really gained respect for you that one night we were sitting out on the dock by your pond.You are an artistic soul...I just wish you knew how to show it.You and I are so alike...we will soon become close.After all, I do live with you 3 out of 7 days of the week.

11.(Yes,I broke the rule!)Although you live so far away, I hold you close.I want the best for you...I can't fight them away when they attack you.I can't scare away your demons...when they attack late at night.I can't help you when all you see are shadows and ghosts...I can just read your poetry, and feel for you.Your words are truly great...you are an AWESOME poet...DO NOT EVER STOP WRITING.I love you...I will never forget you.Life may let you drift to all corners of the world...but the computer binds you to me.Talk to me, no matter what.


My past haunts me.I miss them...God, I miss them.I want them.I needed them, for so long.They betrayed me.They hurt me.I will never be the same.And I thank you all the same..."

Yesterday little Ryan dropped by my house.Wow?Haven't talked to him in so long.It made me smile to see him again...I just hope I don't see Sam (CALE! ;P)soon.Donno what will happen when I see her again.

Talked to Alfy on the phone for a while today.He makes me happy.I can be free around him.I loves him!Boy...I hope Jeni is reading this now...lol.That would be great. :D]

My Mom has been fighting with me a whole lot the past few days.She keeps bringing up the past...and how I ran away.She believes I do not understand how badly she hurt when I left.She is right...I am not her.I do not understand how much she cared.But, she still doesn't understand why I left.She doesn't know how often I cut myself because of her.I couldn't just ignore her...and go on with life.I was not in a healthy state of mind for so long...I almost cracked.FOR GOOD.I escaped to be with some good friends.They straightened me out, and I love them for it.Shit will always be the same around here.My Mom will never understand this family...How she hurts everyone, by controlling them.It sounds impossible...but lord...you don't know how crazy she truly is, until you have lived here a few days...

Donno what else is happening with my life now...My life is pretty boring.

Here is a poem I just found in my journal.I wrote it a week ago.

""Alibis""

Welcome, dearest alibis
To my world of shadows
Illusions, deceptions and
DARKEST FEARS.

My nightmares crawl
Through this bloody encryption
I escape reality by
Enchanting the darkness...

Fires burn wrecklessly
Eating away at my soul
Cremating what is left
I'm turning into ashes...

I'm stuck in my
PERSONAL HELL
For my fears
Scream in tongues...

They scratch away
At the surface of
My swollen heart
Fucking with my 

SANITY.

Why shall I ready the blade
When the requiem of pain
Tortures me so
The sound of the night...

I hide in the cracks
Of my shattered mind
To escape numbness
To escape my 

ALIBIS...


Not my best....ah well."

It was really hard to talk to her about some things.REALLY HARD.Last time she saw my scars, she grabbed my arm and got a little too physical with me.It was hard for me to trust her again...

I have decided to go to therapy.I want to take pills.I am tired of hurting all the time.I can't just ignore this anymore.

I don't trust people very easily.Talking to a counseller will be hard as Hell...but I will do it...

I AM NOT GOOD ENOUGH.Not for you.Not for me...especially.What does everyone want from me!?!I have nothing to offer!No light to bask in!So go away!

I have lost everything and everyone I ever cared about (mostly).I still have a few people...Hnery, Jenni, Jenny, Carol, Tana...a few others.But, I am just not close to them like I want to be.

I have nothing inside of me...and I just bleed away ALL THE TIME.I don't want to!!I want to have fun, smile, laugh, be myself!Whoever she is!I don't know everything about me...but I know some things.I just need to FEEEL again.

I need something to make me happy!I thought of everything that makes me happy...guitar,music,writing,friends?But, that just doesn't cut it anymore.And I don't know why.Nothing satisfies me.Nothing is good enough.And I don't know why.

My other side:STOP FEELING LIKE THIS!YOU ARE PATHETIC!
ME:But I am so empty....I can't feel.I am doing my best to love.
My other side:""YOUR BEST ISN'T GOOD ENOUGH UNTIL YOU HAVE SUCCEEDED.NOT GO!!!DO SOMETHING!Oh...and don't be yourself, by the way!""
ME:How can I not be me?
My other side:""JUST SHUTUP""

My Dad keeps on yelling at me, telling me how much of a failure I am.I know I am already dead to him!He keeps pestering me about life.It does not help to yell.To get things accomplished, you need to talk rationally.

GRRR!I am doing all I can.Doing my best in school, trying to find a job, smiling as much as I can, being positive as much as I can, being optimistic (I suck at that)......having hope.

Fuck it.Fuck me.Fuck all this shit.

Again, I am here
Crying myself into
This darkened land
I know so well...

Again, my tears
Taste like sugar
Because now you
Seem so damn bitter...

Again, I feel every
Miserable tune
Of my heart
This is killing me...

Again, nothing matters
The World just
Is not the same
Without you here...

Again, I crawl
Into deep sleep
To escape this...
All I have come to fear...

Again, I am drifting
Into morbid dreams
Of how it used to be
I scream out loud...

Again, I awake
Covered in sorrow
Trapped in the
Bowels of Hell

Again and again...
I will do this
Again and again...
I will miss you...


I have fallen apart...The wounds just bleed...And I let the world see, because I just don't care anymore.It couldn't get any worse.Nothing could be worse than knowing I have lost her, every time the sun rises...Nothing is worse than having my heart scream in vain every night the moon light meets my face...Nothing is worse than having the blade tear through my pain...just to let it out.When it will NEVER leave me alone.It just finds a way to make a new home inside of me...it will kill me again and again and again..."

Here ye go.

""Illusions""

Look into my eyes
What do you see?
Come a little closer
Vie with my skin

Listen to the words
The screaming...
Inside my head
Are you deafened yet?

Do you feel the blood
Rush through my veins?
Feel the anger
That will never subside??

...Numb
I can't feel a thing
Can you feel me
Cutting through?

Peer out of my eyes
See my confusion?
I am an artist
Painting this illusion...

I control my reality
I paint the beauty
But I cannot
Rid myself of these

EmOtIoNs.

I am trapped
In this misery
With no voice
I can't scream...

Black tear drops
I can't breathe
Can you
Feel it too???


Here's a random love song.It doesn't have a title yet.


I want to fade away
Into the distant horizon
Cradling your soul in my arms
While watching the sun set before us

The wind will carry us away
To an unknown land
Where beauty sings her song
And all we know is trust

When the oranges and purples are
Covered in sparkling moon light
Just let the magical dust
Fall from the sky, onto you

Transforming reality.

I reach up to the sky
Pull the moon close
Catch a falling star
And let its beauty

Resonate between us

We have so much to share
Two worlds collide into one
Your words echo in my mind
Your touch melts the ice inside

Let me support you
When your barricades are gone
I'll build you a stronger empire
You can be Queen

And I will be your little princess...

We could lay here forever
Not making a sound
And yet, I would feel happy
For the very first time...


It seems to be missing something though...it's not yet complete.Any ideas???"

I was supposed to work yesterday...but my Manager called me at 9 in the morning to tell me I didn't have to work.So, I took advantage of my free time.I hung out with Ryan Kari and Dale.Good times.We went to the mall, and I bought the new DIMMU BORGIR cd.""Death Cult Armageddon"".It is not as good as their older stuff. ;/ .

Ryan taught me how to growl/scream the metal scream.I am pitiful...I need work.But, I guess no one is perfect when they start.I will start screaming anything and everything...it is my 3 language.1-english, 2-guitar, 3-ScReAmS .I will rawk.You just wait.

I had to go to couselling yesterday, as well.It was OK.I didn't tell the counsellor much of anything.My Mom wanted me to tell him why I ""ran away"" and want to move out of the house.Why?I am leaving in a couple weeks...things will not be better.Why drag someone else into Hell??

My Mom is trying to talk me into not moving out.She doesn't want me to leave.I am going...no one is stopping me.I can survive financially, if I really want to.Everyone (including my Sister...whom I trustED??) thinks I will end up being a high school drop-out, and pretty much nothing.I will finish high school.I am wanting to go to VCU...major in music.

I will show everyone they were wrong.That I am right.Maybe then they will be sorry for this petty shit."

"event","So, life has been busy lately.I've been working lots, and hanging out with friends lots more.I met Dani's friend Tasha on Friday.She is fucking cool.I loves her! ;P.

Dani, Tasha, and I met up with some people (Tana, Ben, Brian, and his g/f-GOD DAMNIT-I still can't remember her name!Maybe she should TALK more...)at the mall Friday night.Shit was cool.Tasha and I pretended to be lesbians when we walked into the Chritian store.It was funny...But come to think about it...was I really pretending?? ;P

Saturday, Tana Ben Dani Tasha and I all hung out at Ben's.We had a massive pillow fight.I got the battle scars and messed up arm to show it.Wooo.Scars will live forever!

Dani and I were jamming on the geetar a lot.He has really opened up my eyes to metal.I have drastically improved on how well I play.It is fucking cool.Just last night, I made this awesome song, with the best riffs.Sounds almost like Dimmu Borgir.I shocked myself...Dani is fucking awesome on the guitar.I am glad he is around to show me this shit.

I was really messed up Saturday.Before Tasha and Dani chilled with me, I was forced to go to counselling.That was awful.The whole way to counselling, my Mom was yelling at me.No, it was worse...she was shredding my whole existance, by telling me how horrible I am...and da dee da dee da.I fought everything she said.I punched the seat like 20 times.Rrr.

Then, when we finally got to the office, I walked out.I just needed to cool off, and get myself together.I was about to cry, and I never cry.It takes so much to make me do so. My Mom came out and grabbed my arm, and shoved me back in.Then, she tripped on the way in the door.She messed up her ankle.Even though I hate her, I felt so horrible.She just laid on the ground crying.Made me feel awful. :( I talked to the counsellor dude.I hate letting people in on my problems;my life;me.I hate it.

Anyways, the rest of the day, I was depressed, and trying to fake a smile.It didn't really happen.I was quiet, and just sat around.I wondered if anyone even realized it?I know Tana knows when I am upset, but she just didn't even bother with me Saturday.

I have too many fucking mental problems.They can all be avoided.The cause of all of them:My Mom.Shit, I have to get out of this house.On July 1, I am gone.That's when I will officially be 18.

I guess that is enough depressing shit for y'all to read.I really hate ranting like this...

Gawd.I just want to be happy.But, it is not possible.I have tried everything.I mean EvErYtHiNg..."

I had to take my Algebra SOL.I failed.I did my best though.I just don't understand alg. 2 shit.I slept through the rest of the day.Then, came home and passed out.People kept on calling me.They always call when I am unconscious...not when I am actually awake.Lovely.

Winny called me today.wow.Surprise surprise.I knew she would com begging me to be her friend again.She has fucked her life up by drug use, and ignorance.Hmm....to giver her a chance, or not to give her a chance...that is the question.I love how I have power in this situation....

I don't work on Friday.So, if any of y'all people out there want to chill, Friday is the day.:D Give me a call...if you donno the #, it's 594 0739.

Saturday I work from 8-2.At 3 I have counselling.My Mom is forcing me to go.It does not help our relationship, as you may think it will do.The counsellor sits both of us down in one room.My mom complains about me, and how I am so horrible.It does nothing.I fight what she says...because it is untrue.What does the cousellor see?I teenager wearing all black, being belligerent and hostile and self centered.But, my mom manipulates so well.I do not have the heart to tell her what SHE has done wrong.How SHE has broken my heart over and over.And ruined me.She controls me way too much, in the wrong way.When I rebel in the littlest bit, I am punished severely.I can't get out of it.My dad can't either...nor can my sister.I will never get along with my Mom.Never.It is a fact.

I once fought my Mom constantly (a few months back...)but I got bruised, and shredded to pieces.It does no good.I have human emotions.I feel horrible when I make her cry.She does not understand why I cry.She cannot help me.

I need to call Tana now.We are gonna chill tomorrow.I hope anyways...so I need to call her and make sure we are.That's all for now."

I really shook Rudie up with the whole Wicca vs. Christ thing.I feel bad.We have our differences, and I can't deny that.We both voiced our opinions, and got to each other.I feel guilty.

I feel like I am a horrible person.I don't know my reasons.I have just been analyzing everything in my life.How things have been between me and some old friends.How I treat my new ones.I give my heart and soul to people.It seems like some return the favor, and be cool to me.The others, ignore me, missunderstand me, give me a hard time.I am a bitch to those people, and lash out on them.I donno where this point is going.

I don't know why I feel so horrible now.Am I too pessismistic and complain a lot?I try not to...but I think I do anyways.I just want to be happy, and atleast fake a smile...but, I have destroyed that mask a long time ago.I hate being artificial in the least bit.

Dani called me today.We talked some.Made me feel better.I have been worried about him.I glad things are working out for him.Which reminds me....I need to call his ass now.

I think I am getting sick.I have had a headache all day.And been sneezing a lot.And been coughing.*Uggh* *Uses magic to make me all better again*

Bleh.That's what I feel like.I have nothing big to post in my journal.I feel a bit violated and angry because of some of the things Rudie and I have been going through in our relationship.But, every relationship has its problems.The only way to really learn things about a person is to see how they react in these times.I hope everything works out OK...

I am not going to post anything personal in my journal anymore.I will keep everything general and vague, and might post poems from time to time.I do not trust anyone anymore, and I don't like giving myself away to people for free.If you can understand that point, talk to me.All life has been lately is disrespect, betrayal and pain.I have done my best to understand, acknowldge problems, and solve them to the best of my ability.That's all I can do.

The whole world is against me now.And I am putting up my shield, and using my sword.Something has got to change....and it is not me.I do not provoke anything.All I do is exist.And sometimes have a heartbeat, and breathe, which pisses off other people, and family."

"event","""Spiritual Black Dimensions"" .....Yeah,I know it is a Dimmu Borgir CD title...But, it just fit...

I watch, as the World
Spins overtop of me
Purple clouds pass by
Shadows walk around alone

Moonlight glows on the ground
Nature dances for me
The wind blows
She's on a RAMPAGE

How she howls
Hurting, crying...
It storms right over me
I'm the heart of it all

   I'm being sucked in
   Drowning in torrential rain
   Struck down by lightning
   Stuck between dimensions

My world gets dimmer
Feel around for stability
Grab ahold of purple haze
Falling deeper into me

The storm inside me
Flows through my veins
Clouds my vision...I'm blind
Deafens me, so I cannot hear

Thunder breaks me down
Close my eyes to escape
But I am stuck
Falling between dimensions..."

"event","Wow.I am proud of myself.I finished my homework already....and it is only 9:20.*Jaw drops*So, I have all night ahead of me to do NOTHING.This is great....

I am ticked.My friend Jenni went to an Ani Difranco concert tonight.Noooooooo.Without me.I think it's in North Carolina.I love ANI.She is my God.My Mom wouldn't have let me go anyways....This makes me so sad.I love music...but have only been to TWO concerts in my whole life.One was a 98 degrees concert.Ok ok...I was forced to go...my sister loved them.The other; The Ernies.Anyone know them?They are ancient.I know the whole band personally, and have lots of their shit signed.Too bad the band broke up.:(

I have been questioning lots of things lately.For instance, I am trying to get down to the REAL me, whoever she is.I see me in the mirror, but I just get confused as to who I am.I hear people speak to me, but I don't really.It's all mumble jumble.No one really strikes my fancy.So I don't try to get to know them personally.I just talk to them to pass time.I only care for a few people.My good friends.Y'all know who you are.I want to know why people listen to me, and why people ignore me.I want to know why people love me, when I am more trouble than anything else.I want to know everything.

I want to know people's motives for doing the things they do.I want to understand everything I can.I want to be able to look into people's eyes, and rad their minds.I want to know why the world works the way it does.I want to change the things that need to be changed.I want to leave my imprint on everyone I meet.

But how can I do that when all I am is shit in people's eyes?That's how I feel..."

"event","Fuck my family.Fuck my Mom.Fuck my Dad who is never here.Fuck my sister, because she believes the version of me, which my parents bring her to b/c of their oh-so-lovely- opinions of me.How does she know what happens in this house anymore??She is away at college in Ohio.I can't ever call her and tell her what is going on...my Mom has torn all the phones out of the walls, so I can't contact anyone.Fuck family.

This past month I have tried everything in my will and power to get along with my Mom.I opened up to her a little bit.But...it just kicked me in the ass.This past week and a half has been HELL...completely.She has taken what I have given her, and tried to tear me apart.AGAIN.I shouldn't have been so generous to her.And let her know who I am.I will not be torn apart by her anymore.No.Never.I am too sick of this shit for her to do this to me.I am fine by myself.I do not need her.

I let Tana in on more of my family shit.I don't like telling people about my family life.I always tend to complain.And I can't help.I am fucked.Anyways....Tana and her Mom were over here Thursday.Their car got stuck in our driveway(lol) and so we visited.Of course, my Mom wouldn't let me and Tana go in any room alone...because we would have massive amounts of ""lesbian sex"".Right.Tana and her Mom were talking behind our backs when we were outside.Tana's Mom:""So what's with Tana and Allison?"" My Mom:""They act more like sisters than lesbians.""...God...I feel loved.Tana dislikes my Mom....good to know.

Last night...My Mom was driving Courtney home from the play...and she went crazy.I was sitting in the front seat,Courtney in the back, and my Mom almost started hitting me.I refused to fight back.Why should I?There is no point anymore.Standing up to her just gets me in more trouble.Courtney told me today that she wanted to fucking punch my Mom....What held her back?!

My Mom gets mad over anything and everything.I do nothing.But yet....I get in trouble.It's SO STUPID.She knows I want to move out in 2 months.She will try and hold me back.I will be 18.I will force my way out.It may break her heart.But...she broke mine many years ago.

God.I am so fucking annoyed.I hate everyone.I hate everything.I hate me.I am an asshole.I do nothing right.I cannot love.I can just hate.Breathe flames.Push away the people that truly love me.I am sorry to all of you.I know I am a bitch.But, I cannot stop it.I don't anymore.

I just want.....I DO NOT EVEN KNOW what I want.Nothing is ever enough for me.I don't know why.I try so hard, and feel so empty.I get nothing.I don't know WHO I am.I don't recognize my face in the mirror.I don't hear the words that come out of my mouth.I am too deafened by the screams inside of me....

Just...fuck it all.Fuck you, if yo don't understand."

The only good part of the day was that it was raining.In the middle of classes, I would just stare out the window and watch the rain fall.My teachers just mumbled on about semi important shit...

This past weekend was fucking cool.Saturday, I had a day off from work.I hung out with Sam and Dani for like 6 hours Saturday night.They are both really cool.Sam is really crazy and nice.Dani is fucking evil, and crazy.Woo.

We chilled at the mall most of the time.Dani and I walked into the Christian book store (while Same was working @ Hot Topic) and asked if they had any books on Paganism.lol.It was great.The lady got really pissy.My comment:""This is a 'religious' store...I figure you might have something on Wicca??""I love pissing people off!Then, Dani and I almost got kicked out of McDonald's for pissing off some lil preps.We were being ""obscence"".Good times man...good times.

Bleh bleh.I am really bored.I have homework to do...but I am not going to do it.Atleast...not until 11 or 12 tonight.I procrastinate too much.Hah.

"event","When they say life is like a rollercoaster....they really mean it.Today was an almost perfect day.Even though I was STUCK in study hall for SIX HOURS, with Mrs.Martin (For the 2nd day in a row), who was yelling at me ALL day...I was still happy.

I can't explain why I am saddened and depressed, then happy the next...for NO reason at all.I may be bi-polar...who knows?I haven't been tested.My Mom doesn't want me to get tested.She doesn't believe in pills.She would kill me if I took them behind her back.That's the last thing I need.So what would the point be?

Life is what you make it.I have always tried my best to make the best of everything.Why am I constantly pessimistic, and down?Why do I have these random spurts of happiness, and clear-mindedness?Just something to ponder...

I am kind of upset.I missed my last band pracitce with Of Beautiful Ruin.Fred wants to get 6 or 7 songs made, and thought out by June...how is that possible if I cannot come to practice?My Mom won't let me go because of my grades.I understand her point, and wanting me to do well in school.(So I will have a future)...but damn.Music is all I care about.I wish she would let me go to band practice.This one metal band is really getting coordinated, and good. :(

As for Someday Forever...I just don't know what happened to it.First, it was me being busy with work, and life.Then, Rudie got a job.Now, we just can't schedule practices.Since we haven't played together in a while, Rudie just feels like he has lost his touch.I hope I can get him back into Someday Forever.We really had it going on there.

Tana's Mom took me home today from school.Her Mom is so crazy, and cool.She is a lot like Tana.A whole lot.She and my Mom talk quite a bit.My Mom started to corrupt Tana's, a while back.(Then she came to her senses)I find this so funny....That Tana's Mom was scared I'd get in trouble for being with Tana and her after school.Her Mom stated mine was CRAZY.Oh shit....lmao.To hear her say that is fucking great.Everyone is fucking afraid of my Mom...and thinks she is crazy.Woww....It's not just me rebelling against her.It's everyone..."

Last night at work was decent.I had the usual bad customers.This chic Amanda was working with me.She is really nice, and cool.She made me laugh some.:)I worked with her some today.Then, she left at 5, and that is where my day got ruined.It seemed like every other customer was complaining to me.I hate it when people do that.I feel so shitty!Grr.

I guess my main problem is myself.I have no faith that I can do anything right, and almost no self confidence.I do somewhat...but not enough.I just fucking get on my own nerves.I am so unlike everyone else.I am really tired of not being understood, and listened to.I have 2 good friends (Kari, and Tana).They are good to me.But it seems like the rest of the world just pisses me off.

I feel like I am the break in the chain, the bitchy girl, the problem.I guess I get it from living in this house.My parents see me like that.To them, I do nothing right.And when I try to do something good for them, it just kicks me in the ass.

I just don't want to be me anymore.There is nothing positive inside me, and I am tired of being so pessimistic, and complaining.I try to create happy things, but they all end up so fucking wrong.

Sweetest Dreams Wont Do

Please dont stare at the scars on my arm
They hold so many memories
So many times of trouble that I have embedded
Into my skin, making sure I wont forget
Please dont look at the tears staining my cheeks
They are filled with shattered glass
Just waiting to burst upon my flesh
Waiting to cut deep into my everlasting pain
To try to make me numb again.

Because Im so tired, so exhausted by the weariness
This every second of internal weeping,
And eternal crying.

Loneliness is deadly.And I am so lonely."

The counsellor didn't have much to tell me to help me.It all came down to this...write out my anger and emotions and shit like that in a journal.....Check.Already done so.It's called poetry.Then, she told me to talk reasonably to my parents about the problems, and missunderstandings we have....Check.Done so, too many times.It got me nowhere.Then...she said to go to counselling.So, I guess that is what I will do.I really do not want to go talk to a complete and total stranger about my life.They just do it for money.It's their job.That's how I see it.But, I will give it a shot.My Mom won't change what she does.I bet she would show up to a few sessions, then get mad at me for things, and discontinue meeting.

Life has been so bleh lately.I need to reconstruct....everything.I am sorry to everyone who has tried to be good to me.Sorry you have to put up with me, and this stupid shit.I don't like me either.Sorry if I have hurt, or ignored any of you.

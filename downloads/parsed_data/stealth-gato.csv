"event","<p><br />yesterday i was talking with scott during work and he asked me which shift i like better, opening, midday, or closing. i told him closing because it's about as busy as opening but you don't have to wake up early. he disagreed&nbsp;saying he liked opening because after work you still have the rest of the day. &nbsp;today i opened again, ran an errand on my way home, sat down on my bed and woke up 3 hours later. since apparently i'm just going to pass out when i get home from work anyway, my vote is still going with the closing shift being my favorite, that way i don't have to wake up early and don't sleep the rest of the day away when i get home. i'm closing monday and tuesday so come visit me!<br /><br />went to walmart after work today. bought some things i needed and some things mom needed... and movies. heck yes! i got 5 movies from the $5 movie bin. 2 i've never seen,&nbsp; and 1 i've been looking for for like 2 years now.<br /><br />my uncle's mom is in the hospital in the area for some sort of surgery I think, but my other aunt who lives around here was thinking that we can meet aunt and uncle for dinner tonight. i'd like to see them, so i'm hoping we can get together.</p><br />"

"event","so today was my first day at the preschool. we have 10 kids. only 1 of them cried... granted he was&nbsp;screaming&nbsp;for an hour, but still only one of them. most of them are really good at following directions. two of them you kind of have to tell multiple times to do something, and one of them just doesn't listen at all (but we're not really sure if he even understands us when we tell him to do something). nap time totally sucks though because it's like an hour and a half of sitting in a dark room with soft music playing while rubbing the kid's backs and playing with their hair and stuff and super relaxing. i think i was more tired from nap time than i was from the rest of the day, haha.

i don't have to work at all tomorrow, but then working at preschool and jamba thursday then working opening shift at&nbsp;jamba friday and saturday... lame."

so today was my second day at jamba. i was closing shift from 5-10. i got there super early. then it would be like 20 people came in at the same time and then on one for like half an hour, then another 20 people, then no one... i felt bad because i can only do one smoothie at a time (there was one where i made 2 at the same time because they were the same smoothie, haha) but seriously, standing for 5+ hours straight is not fun...

went to a little shindig at bro's apartment last night. mostly just to meet jamba people. i was only there for like an hour because there were so many people and i'm not into parties.

i got a new phone! it's pretty cool, so far the only thing i don't like is that you can't rotate pictures you take... seriously, you can't.

i have to work on monday which totally sucks because monday is supposed to be a holiday... SUCKS!!!

i start preschool on tuesday, it's just a tuesday/thursday school. i'm really excited."

"event","so, went to finish setting up the preschool. then worked at jamba. then back to the preschool for &quot;meet the teacher&quot;. I left my house at 7:50 this morning and got back at 8 this evening...

preschool- Shelby is the teacher i'm working with, she's super awesome. (so are the other teachers but they're like on the other side of the building so I&nbsp;don't really see them) there are ten kids in our class, and nine of them came to the meet the teacher thing. one for sure is going to be a handful, but the others will probably get into the swing of things after the first few weeks.

jamba- i worked with my bro and matt today. chris pascal came in and it was super awkward. (he works next door) since we weren't super busy i got to make some of the smoothies. it'll take me a while to get into the hang of it though... i have trouble remembering to &quot;bump&quot; orders ( hitting the button to take the order off the screen after it's been made) and i have trouble remembering which button to press on the mixer for what drink. Saturday i'll just be washing dishes... and cleaning and stuff I guess because they'll be super busy and i won't be able to take the 5-10 minutes i need to make the smoothie.

that's all the news for me...

it's Fall in animal crossing so there are new bugs and fish to catch!"

"event","so the scripture reading for today was about Joseph and when his father was favoring him and giving him a fancy coat, his brothers decided to kill him. (and then the sermon turned into a lecture about how we aren't good enough... yeah...) anyway, mom and dad got my bro a used car yesterday because he actually really needs a new car because his old one was about to die. so he came over to dinner today and i was like &quot;sorry, bro, but since our parents were favoring you, i have to kill you now.&quot; haha.

anyway, bro and his gf came over for dinner because they haven't had meat in a while and they don't have money to go grocery shopping. it was fun. my bro's actually a cool guy in small doses, living with him gets super annoying though.

i have the interview for the preschool and &quot;orientation&quot; for jamba tomorrow. 

also, yesterday was super fun with the besties. i made hcar watch the first episode of Naruto, i kinda feel bad... we were gonna watch teenage mutant ninja turtles 2 after, but then it was late and she was sleepy and stuffs. i can't wait to use my bento and park day stuff!!!!"

I'm pretty sure i have it already but idk. jamba interview was a joke because i already had the job so i'm going in on monday for orientation. so now i have 2 minimum wage jobs!!! woot for college education! my problem was that 1 i don't know any companies so i didn't really have an &quot;in&quot; and 2 i only have one thing on my resume which really doesn't make employers jump to hire you, so i'm stuck doing minimum wage for a year before i'm gonna start looking for something better.<br /><br />B-DAY NEWS:&nbsp;played animal crossing and all my neighbors told me happy birthday, and i got a piece of cake from one of them. I also got blue hair and caught a shark... (but i guess that doesn't really have anything to do with my b-day) went out to eat with the fam. i got a soda and candy from bro (but i didn't even get him anything for his b-day so i'm not complaining) and a new dvd player from mom and dad because mine is dying sadly. got lots of b-day wishes on facebook and even got a few from people i didn't expect so it made me happy.

Tuesday bro texts me asking if i can work nights and weekends. I told him I can't work wednesday nights or sunday mornings because of church commitments. He texts me back saying come in on thurdsay around 2 for an interview.
today i get a call from a church member saying her friend rins the preschool at another church and was looking for an assistant teacher for two year olds. I called and have an interview possibly tomorrow. (the lady's ac went out so the repair people are coming some time tomorrow and if it's too close to 2 then we're going to reschedule. but hopefully we can meet tomorrow)
seriously, i think that sermon was so true to begin with and now this? the lord seriously does provide.

"event","<br /><lj-cut text=""Scott Pilgrim Graphic Novel Spoilers"">finished Scott Pilgrim last night. I guess it's because I&nbsp;watched the movie first that I like it a bit more than the book. Like all the crap about Lisa... why? why did it even need to be there?&nbsp;to take up room because the fight against Roxy was like half a chapter? (also, why did she explode into bunnies?) Why was Knives' dad even there? at first I was like&nbsp;&quot;oh, he's gonna get the sword from him&quot; ... but no.<br /><br />I'm torn on the fight against the twins though because in the movie it's rock gorilla vs rock twin dragons, but i liked the robots. that's about all I can say about vol 5... oh, and i guess that it was hilarious that Scott tried to kill everyone with glasses (even his brother).<br /><br />I liked how Ramona disappeared in the book rather than just leaving with Gideon, but i didn't really like the Gideon fight in the book compared to the movie. I actually feel like it was more epic in the movie. (possibly because the Knives/Ramona fight was moved to the end so it felt more tense) but yeah, in the book it's like: Gideon kills Scott, jk scot and ramona are both totes alive, now we're in ramona's head, now we're not and now gideon is totes dead. and wtf with the frozen chicks? i feel it was completely pointless. and they didn't even explain the head glowing thing after making a big deal about it for like the whole volume 5... i did like everything after Gideon dies though the closure with Envy, the fact that Steven Stills is gay (with Joseph... so that's why it took so long to get the cd made... haha).</lj-cut><br /><br />i really did like the books (although from the ranting abouve it might not look like it, haha). it's hard to comapre the book and movie because more often than not the book is always better, but the movie rocked so hard core i'm just not sure...<br /><br />tomorrow starts the job hunt again... bro's moving to the downtown branch of Jamba so i might go see what they're doing there..."

i got Diana into all my anime music, she really liked it. and i got to talk about my book which was nice because i don't get to do book talk a lot.

I know marriage is hard, that some days you will both be upset and take out your frustration on each other, that what's important to you might not have any significance to him. I've watched my parents for 21 years now and definitely understand that marriage isn't going to magically make everything perfect. But I also know that marriage to the right person gives you strength, joy and unconditional love because I see it in my parents too.&nbsp; I'm not desperate to get married, maybe I just want to find the man I want to marry.&nbsp; I am not one to compromise or settle so dating prospects have been slim to none my whole life (not to mention that most of the guys I know are all gay)... but i do want to find a guy who shares a love with me that is stronger than any hardships that might come up, you know?&nbsp;</lj-cut><br /><br />now, off the marriage....<br /><br />Going out with Mom and Papaw tonight for&nbsp;dinner.

I'm picking my aunt up from the airport tonight and driving her to my grandparent's house because g-ma is having some sort of medical thing tomorrow and aunt needs to drive her. bff caitie is accompaning me so yay!

I haven't actually seen either of them but I&nbsp;really want to see Porco Rosso. What's Pom-poko about?&quot; and started up a conversation with the cute check out guy... lame. (i also bought Gladiator because it's awesome! I was totally thinking about the &quot;give them hell&quot; part the other day.

"event","so today was the VBS sunday at church. it was pretty cool. there was one part in the sermon when our assistant minister, Ginger,&nbsp;was explaining how they had God sightings during VBS. the theme for this VBS was like sailing and stuff and in the sanctuary was like onboard a ship and there were lines with all these little flags on them and Ginger told us that those flags were a God sighting from each of the kids so it was pretty cool to see all those flags. then we were asked to share a God sighting with the people sitting next to us and Dick, this guy in the choir who's kind of a goofball, turns to his wife and smiles saying &quot;I saw a bunny this morning!&quot; it was kind of hilarious. seriously Dick is like a very tall kid with a mustache and gray hair and he always amuses us in choir.

after church me and mom went to Tuscany, an italian restaurant near our house and had the yummy pasta that they make. I forget what it's called now but it's definitely yummylicious. then we went to Albertsons because it's right next door to look for mushrooms and Marsala wine for chicken Marsala and it took us forever to find the wine. we went to the back and were walking back and forth looking for the salad dressing aisle because that's where the cooking wine is apparently and we couldn't find it and finally we went to the front of the store and were walking back and forth and found it. the aisle signs are different in the front and back...

I&nbsp;started reading Witch Hunter on onemanga. it's manwha (sp?). it took me forever to get use to reading right to left... it's a lot like Soul Eater except people aren't weapons... and there's more ecchi stuff, seriously the girls wear practically nothing. it's pretty good but it's incomplete and also irregular. jerks.

other than that, my life's pretty boring. we're having breakfast for dinner!"

started reading High School Debut again. the art is super pretty but i'm starting to remember why I hate shojo manga so much. i really hope that Japanese girls aren't like the characters in the manga. seriously, I knew more about dating when I was in elementary school than these girls who are high school characters.

also, me and my parents were talking about it today after church, how other countries also celebrate their independence. and then i was like &quot;yeah, cause sometimes on the calendars there's like 'canadian independence day' and stuff&quot; but seriously, why are canadian holidays written on american calendars? i don't think we have any other countrie's holidays on the calendars so why canada?"

Then last night my dad gets mad at me saying &quot;you need to get a job soon. you better have a list of places that you are going to apply to tomorrow evening. And you better clean the kitchen.&quot; then my mom makes me give her my credit card saying that if I don't get a job soon then she's going to stop giving me my allowance (yes I still get an allowance) i think that might be the reason that she was mad at me in the morning, or it could be because I hadn't done the dishes the previous night idk.

seriously,&nbsp;since i graduated&nbsp;i've been doing the dishes and making dinner almost every day, i might miss a night of dishes but they get done the next day. i don't see why my parents are so pissed about it. plus I sweep and mop the kitchen every week. so it's not like the kitchen is some disgusting growth-infested disaster zone or anything.

plus there's all this pressure on me getting a job. i don't think my parents understand that NOWHERE&nbsp;is hiring at the moment. and the only places that are hiring are hiring EXPERIENCED&nbsp;people.&nbsp; i had a job as a house manager and i rocked at that job, but it didn't give me experience that most places want to see in potential employees. pretty much, i'm really good at lying to people about turning off the AC...

Saturday was Father's day for us because my dad was going to visit his dad on Sunday. Me and Mom were going to do stuff with her dad on Sunday but then Papaw had to get a cononoscopy today and was &quot;cleaning out&quot; on Sunday so he came over Saturday as well.

Sunday me and mom were supposed to go to church, but mom slept in and I didn't want to go by myself. Then we went to find the place Papaw was getting the colonoscopy done and also we planned on going to Yukatan for lunch. (it's like Pei Wei for mexican food.) Ykatan was right across the street. Then we went kind of down down to Target and I got two new dresses. they're super cute. Then we came home and watched the disney channel. (my parents always roll their eyes when i'm watching cartoons or something, but sometimes I hear them watching Phineas and Ferb...)

Today I had to go pick up Papaw and take him to the colonoscopy place. I got lost because google maps was dumb and told me something confusing. but even getting lost, i picked up Pap 20 minutes before he was orriginally planning on going. Then we got there like 45 minutes before his appointment was supposed to be, and they were running behind (no surprise) so finally after Pap went in at 3 i walked across the street and ate at Yukatan. Then Dr Phil was on and me and the other guy in the waiting room were just laughing at the rediculousness of the girl that had been brought on the show. She was seriously stupid. then Papaw got out and Mom called me and was like &quot;well, i just got off work so I was going to see if you wanted me to pick him up.&quot; and I was like &quot;heck yes&quot;&nbsp;(because I really didn't want to get lost again with a drugged up, gassy old man in my car.) They were going to dinner and mom invited me but I declined. I called Dad on my way home and he told me he was eating dinner with mom and Papaw, so I&nbsp;got to eat PB&amp;J for dinner...

second, i was trying to find The Cat Returns on DVD and me and caitlin were at this crazy store looking in the DVD racks. then I&nbsp;find The Cat Returns on Blueray, and three copies of the&nbsp;Japanese version and The Cat Returns 3 in spanish (although there's no such thing as the cat returns 3) so we continue looking and then i'm like 'I'm sure the Japanese version has subtitles.' then we go back and all of them are gone. then I get a voice mail so i'm looking through the DVDs while trying to listen to the voice mail and at first it's some man getting mad at me for something but it's too loud so I&nbsp;can't really hear, so I listen to it again but this time it's the manager at Taco Cabana calling me about a job offer but it's still too loud so I can't hear all of it so I save it and then I woke up...

So i decided to clean off some of the shelves in my room so that I could clean some of the mess up. I found a bunch of notes from junior high and high school from various friends. I've been amusing myself reading them and feeling lame for how silly these notes are. I&nbsp;also found a really old diary, it was super lame. oh the joys of cleaning your room... but yeah, it's really amazing how big of a deal things were back in high school and junior high. omg boy drama... we were so silly. The mess really isn't that much cleaner because I&nbsp;only cleaned off one shelving unit (i have 4) which just means I have 2 small shelves cleaned. 

I really need a big bookshelf to put all my movies and books on. 


So, on Saturday i went out with my friend Diana to her friend, Megan's place. It was fun. WE tried to get into this one bar but there was som DJ there and tickets wer $20, so we just went to a different bar. Then at Megan's place the roof of their building has a pool and hot tub so we hung out up there. Unfortunately i didn't get home until 5am, but it was still fun. 

Then Sunday we were about to go to church when my Papaw called from the golf course saying he was really dizzy and didn't think he could drive home. So mom and dad took him to the hospital. Mom told me what the doctors said he had and it wasn't anything super serious but he's still at the hospital so keep him in your prayers.

Walked through Central park. did a bus tour. did a cruise thing to the Statue of LIberty. went to Macy's and FAO Schwarz. and Time Square. and ate lots of&nbsp;foods. i think that's it.

then spent all of thursday evening and friday trying to get home. thursday night there was a tiny storm, but there was lightning so flights got cancelled and since we were on the stand by list we were basically at the bottom of the list. So instead of flying home thursday at 6pm, we got to fly home friday at 10:30pm... meaning I&nbsp;got home at 2 am.

also, the day before I left to NY my computer basically crashed. it sucked. but it's fixed now... only an hour and a half after I woke up too, haha. but i finally get to use the scroll on my mouse pad.

I'm missing my HERO's graduation because of all the stupid flight junk and waking up at 3... when graduation was supposed to start... hopefully she's not too mad at me. :( 

also, does anyone else get pop-up ads on LJ? i've been getting them a lot recently and was just wondering..."

"event","BFF&nbsp;Heather got married today.&nbsp; and since I&nbsp;couldn't say it anywhere else today, have good sex... haha. but honestly, have lots of fun on your honeymoon, take lots of pictures and have lots of fun stories to tell us when you get back.

I'm exhausted. waking up butt ass early (ie 7am) sucks.

I'M&nbsp;GOING&nbsp;TO&nbsp;NY&nbsp;ON&nbsp;MONDAY!!! I'm really excited even thought I&nbsp;really have no idea what we're going to be doing.

now, time to sleep."

"event","CAITLIN&nbsp;IS&nbsp;MY&nbsp;HERO!!!!
my MOH dress for heather's wedding was a bit too big and she fixed it for me. ILY&nbsp;CAITLIN!!!

My car is being gay again, so I&nbsp;have to wake up butt ass early to take it to the repair place and hope they can fix it either in like 1 hour or somehow i find time to get a ride all the way back home to pick it up in between decorating the church and the reception place, the&nbsp;wedding rehearsal and rehearsal diiner... I told my parents that i was going to be busy all day and they were like &quot;i'm sure you'll have time to come back to pick your car up.&quot; hopefully i do, but it is still really annoying that they don't understand that it would take at least&nbsp;an hour out of the time i really don't have to do that. 

Also, i'm gonna kill my computer in the near future. I wasn't even doing anything. I mean my internet was open and everything but I&nbsp;seriously wasn't doing anything but type in word for like thirty minutes and suddenly a &quot;blocked threat&quot; came up. ugh. I really need to go to geek squad and talk to someone. it's either SP2 or the updated Interenet Explorer is what I've decided... it would be really cool if I&nbsp;could, you know, use the scroll on my mouse pad, or open things from my desk top without it saying that there's&nbsp;no program, or go to websites i've gone to for the past year without any proplems until i got this stupid SP2 update.

seriously, my car and my computer are going to be the death of me..."

"event","so went to Manga Reader today because I figured I&nbsp;need to get caught up on Soul Eater and what do you know... freaking &quot;blocked&nbsp;threat&quot; popped up on the first page I&nbsp;went to. considering I've gotten viruses at least three times this semester because of the stupid vista sp 2 update I had to get for school I'm not going to chance it. guess I can't read BB or Soul Eater for a while...

strange fact that I noticed recently... so when hand writing stuff i sometimes get b and p messed up because it's the same stroke just one's with the line going up and one going down, you know? so looking back on some of my typed stuff i realized i still sometimes get them mixed up. it's not like the keys are close together or anything so i can't be hitting one by mistake. it's just weird.

i'm super tired. i slept too much yesterday and felt really sick all day because of it. then Diana texts me at like 10 being like &quot;you wanna hang out?&quot; I told her I wasn't feeling to good and that we should hang out another time, but I&nbsp;never heard back from her.

blarg. next week I'm gonna be in NY!!!"

"event","So last year, I made a <a href=""http://take-walker.livejournal.com/297748.html"">big post</a> over on my LJ detailing all the episodes from season 2, and what I thought was good and bad about each, plus rankings and other thoughts.

Well, it's high time I did this with season 3, and I figure there's no better time to do so than right now, as I, like much the fandom, am reeling from the EQG trailer. I have honestly been needing to watch poni again, because I'm actually having trouble remembering what the ponies look like, sound like, how they move, etc., which makes reading tough. So yeah.

To recap, the ""Good, Bad and Ugly"" system works like this. <b>Good (+)</b> is the good stuff: what makes the episode good, what makes it worth watching, what's funny and memorable. <b>Bad (-)</b> is the bad stuff: goofs, gaffs, cringeworthy moments, why the episode is not good or not worth watching. <b>Ugly (~)</b> is supposed to a ""read between the lines"" section for sussing out the unintended meanings of episodes, but I think there's not as much of that in season 3 as there was in season 2. We'll see. Mostly, I'll probably be using that section as a wrap-up, to discuss my feelings on the episode at hand. I'll also be doing a little writeup on each song, along with marking it good or bad. Again, you can check out <a href=""http://take-walker.livejournal.com/297748.html"">the last post</a> to see how that all works.

Oh, and this time I'll be going chronologically and have the rankings at the end. :B TO THE QUEUEUEUEUEUE!

<lj-cut text=""The Crystal Empire""><b><u>The Crystal Empire</u></b>
+ Cool new backstory expanding Equestria.
+ After an evil alicorn, a Spirit of Chaos, and the leader of a tribe of emotion-draining monsters, we get a villain who is just a unicorn. A rather peculiar looking unicorn, yes, but that he's not any sort of unusual creature speaks volumes to just how powerful he must have been.
+ Celestia being fucking awesome with dark magic and having unwavering faith in Twilight and shit.
+ Spike gets to sing (see below).
+ Sombra is <i>really goddamn scary</i>.
+ Rarity is sort of completely amazing through this whole episode.
+ Pinkie Spy. Pinkie in a Fluttershy costume. Pinkie in a jester costume.
+ <b>The Ballad of the Crystal Empire:</b> A catchy tune, the best in an episode with two (technically three) songs. Introduced fun things like the flugelhorn and Fluttershy with the ewes. (Of course, did no one ever notice that there was no Crystal Kingdom Anthem? Like, ever?)
+ Twilight using dark magic, holy crap. Also gravity magic.
+ Cadence's finest moment: WIFE TOSS!
+ He may not have been the greatest threat, but Sombra just fuckin' <i>dies</i> at the end. No banishment, no being turned to stone or shadow; they just fucking destroy his ass. That's harsh, bro!
+ Great teaser at the end with Luna's book.

- <b>The Failure/Success Song:</b> For the former, it was a really bad thing to have a song about. Twilight is essentially just moping about something she doesn't even fully understand yet. Plus, the musical break in the middle for the math joke kind of kills the whole thing. Yes, Spike gets to sing, but that doesn't make up for it. The problem with the reprise is the content: after being lectured on how it's more important to understand self-sacrifice, all of Twilight's friends start singing about how great she is, setting up a season-long arc of ""Twilight is best pony, <i>and no one else</i>"".
- Sunshine, fucking sunshine.
- Slow pacing due to lengthy intel gathering, exposition, and fair scenes. Could have been one episode. Maybe an episode and a half.
- For all his neat backstory and creepy presence, Sombra turns out to have no personality whatsoever, being somewhat of an empty threat. Yes, all the jokes about him not being able to talk are funny, but they point to the fact that there's really nothing to the guy.
- Twilight's got some major Idiot Ball going on about the whole ""test"" thing. Also Twilight putting her success before the Empire.
- Pony jousting is great and Fluttershy is adorable in her armor, but watching her get beaten by Rainbow Dash is just... It would have been far funnier a scene had the opposite occurred.
- Once again, Cadence saves the day. Once again, the villain just stands there and fucking takes it.

~ So yeah. The big problem with this, other than dragging and having a terrible villain, is that by the end, Twilight's gotten a big head. If they were trying to show her confidence building, this was not the way to do it. Given how the season turns out, this was our first indicator that not everything was going to be great in MLPland.</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Too Many Pinkie Pies""><b><u>Too Many Pinkie Pies</u></b>
+ Animals being turned into fruit!
+ Pinkie being neurotic about fun.
+ Pinkie knowing about old lore. The Mirror Pool turns out to be a fun macguffin with lots of fanonly applications.
+ Pinkie at some of her Pinkiest. No, you cannot have too many Pinkie Pies.
+ The Pinkies' nicknames for the mane cast.
+ The Pinkie shenanigans during the paint drying scene. Most especially the G3 reference.

- Pinkie's friends have severe Idiot Ball in trying to figure out which one is the real one. <i>Obviously it's the one who cares more about her friends than having fun.</i> (The one who can string more than one sentence together.)
- Watching paint dry as the test is pretty ingenious, but the scene is, well, unsurprisingly tedious.
- Those inflated Pinkies are <i>horrifying</i>.

~ So the first time Pinkie crawls through the pool, we see her breaking the surface. It then becomes apparent that <i>that</i> Pinkie is the clone, since she's going ""Fun! Fun!"" ...Whaaaat? The implications are mind-bending.
~ The problem is solved by a method that could have potentially killed Pinkie Pie. Why was this necessary? ""I can't risk sending the real Pinkie back into the pond!"" Twilight says, and then does it anyway.
~ It's not the most amazing episode ever, but there's a lot of great comedy that plays to Dave Polsky's strengths. The ending is a tad uncomfortable because Twilight was playing with fire, but otherwise, it's highly enjoyable.</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""One Bad Apple""><b><u>One Bad Apple</u></b>
+ Sweetie Belle almost doing magic.
+ Babs is completely adorable, what with her blank flank tail covering + blow mane out of face routine. Also her doofy accent.
+ <b>Babs Seed:</b> One of the best songs from the show ever, a pop tour de force that really blew me out of the water the first time I-- Actually, no, I hated it the first time I heard it. But that happens. Nowadays, I love it. As for the sequence, it's a mixed bag: the dull repetition of the chorus scenes are balanced out by Sweetie being <i>super incredibly adorable with a milkshake oh my god</i>.
+ Sweetie Belle's house!
+ Sweetie Belle covered in luster dust, and Rarity's emergency edible boots.
+ ""Why does life have to be so ironic?""
+ Scootadrums.
+ Expansion of the CMCs into Manehattan.

- Apple Bloom is capable of supreme evil. Also Sweetie Belle. <i>Devious</i>.
- Veggie salad. It will never make sense.

~ No indication, despite Babs being an Apple from Manehattan, as to whether she's actually related to Aunt and Uncle Orange. SERIOUSLY, THIS IS IMPORTANT
~ A My Little Pony episode about bullying that actually <i>works</i>? Okay, it's not perfect. There's something to be said for the ""tell an adult"" lesson, as well as the ""anyone can become a bully"" lesson, but that in particular is a tad overshadowed by ""every bully is bullied themselves"" which isn't always the case. Plus, where's the sympathy for Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon? It's still a great episode though, as far as tackling a subject and coming out on top.</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Magic Duel""><b><u>Magic Duel</u></b>
+ The Alicorn Amulet is severely awesome. (Also the first canon usage of the word ""alicorn"".)
+ Fluttershy being scared for her animal friends.
+ Saddle Arabia. Those delegates look awesome.
+ AW YEAH IT'S THE MUTHAFUCKIN TRIXIE
+ Snips and Snails!
+ Validation of every Trixie fanfic ever.
+ Trixie working on Pinkie's family's rock farm.
+ Zecora yessss. Also, Zecora knowing magic, kind of. The stuff she has Twilight do is pretty awesome, and she makes a good Yoda.
+ Fluttershy being amazing. And dressing in a bunny-spy outfit.
+ Trixie not trusting wheels. You know that was designed to be a catchphrase.
+ Even though none of it was real: filly Applejack and Rarity, old Applejack, male Applejack, double Rainbow Dash.
+ As someone pointed out, when Trixie first showed up, she was using tricks and Twilight defeated her with magic. Now, Trixie comes in performing magic and Twilight defeats her with tricks.
+ Facefault.
+ Oh, and the ending is the best ever, especially since Pinkie doesn't actually get to say anything.

- The dark backalley and its greedy curiosity shop owner belong more in the gritty Ponyville from Mysterious Mare-Do-Well. Though nothing says that's actually Ponyville.
- Why is juggling animals considered entertainment fit for foreign ambassadors? Or even all that interesting? Rarity does that kind of shit every day.
- Most of Trixie's 'alterations' are pretty amusing, but the horn fusion and the removal of Pinkie's mouth are pretty horrifying. And yeah, the mouse pointer is kind of anachronistic.
- Of course, holy shit, Twilight can conjure Parasprites. D: Not to mention undo them.
- ""Highest-level unicorns.""
- So I guess ponies can't swim, since there's sort of a river cutting under the edge of that fishbowl...
- Goddammit, Big Macintosh, you had one job, ""Make them believe you're really Applejack."" So what do you say? YOUR CATCHPHRASE

~ Yeah, so... This is a huge pile of brony pandering. But you know what? I'm happy to be pandered to. Especially if it's kept to once per season (see also: Last Roundup). This was more or less everything I wanted in a Trixie episode.
~ Trixie's apology at the end has ruffled some feathers. All I know is, she apologizes, but she doesn't really mean it, or at least she doesn't really understand the force behind it. She's still Trixie. She's less turning over a new leaf than galloping off to keep being her wonderful, irritating self.</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Sleepless in Ponyville""><b><u>Sleepless in Ponyville</u></b>
+ Finally, the Scootaloo episode we have long awaited!
+ Pretty much every scene Rarity is in is amazing. Just seriously add like 7 or 8 pluses for her alone.
+ Shoutout to Sonic Rainboom.
+ The Olden Pony. Seriously, a lot of people didn't think she was scary, and she's not really, but that story is the kind of half-sensical garbage that campfire tales are made of.
+ Suddenly Luna.
+ Scootaloo's sleep-scooting scene is classic.
+ ""It's colder than a timberwolf's toenail.""
+ Rainbows every day.
+ The Headless Horse returns!
+ Rainbow Dash whinnies in her sleep.
+ Scootalove is canon. Orphan Scootaloo is still up for debate.
+ ""Thank you! And have a nice day!"" Seriously, that was brilliant.

- Jesus, dem EYES @_@
- THAT IS NOT A SONG it's not terrible, but Sweetie's supposed to be <i>able</i> to sing!
- Luna talks <i>so freaking weird</i> in this episode. And not because she's not using 'thou'.

~ You can't ask for a more wholesome, well-crafted episode than this.</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Wonderbolt Academy""><b><u>Wonderbolt Academy</u></b>
+ Awesome Wonderbolt recruit uniforms.
+ Thunderlane, not-Wild Fire, Cloud Kicker, and of course Snowflake.
+ Snowflake eating clouds.

- Spitfire's new voice, attitude, and let's not forget cutie mark. :/ Plus the fact that, once again, everyone forgets who Rainbow Dash is and what she's done.
- Creepy wing actions everywhere.
- Lightning Dust needed some character. Like, backstory or <i>something</i>.
- The scenes with the mane cast in Ponyville really detract from the focus of the episode. The second one really does nothing that couldn't have been explained at the end.
- How do you save unicorns and earth ponies with a cloud?

~ I really have no idea what this episode is about. Part and parcel for Merriweather Williams. Seriously, what is the message? I think <a href=""http://www.fimfiction.net/blog/100503/"">Cupcakes</a> summed it up way better than I could. Rainbow Dash's character is clipped, and the message is muddled over and over again. This seriously just makes no sense in the least, and at worst is completely infuriating. (So much potential, wasted!)</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Apple Family Reunion""><b><u>Apple Family Reunion</u></b>
+ Tons of new place names.
+ Granny is hardly rusty in the giddyup. c.c Whew! (And more real young Granny Smith! :3)
+ Auntie Applesauce is kind of terrifying, but she is <i>amazing</i>.
+ BABBY APPLEJACK @_@
+ Apple Rose! She was cute as a youngin' and she's a real stinker as an old'un. :D
+ Applejack's parents are DEEEAAAAAD!
+ Braeburn shows up and he <i>never talks once</i>.
+ The Apples are related to Hayseed Turniptruck. I'm actually not sure if that's a good thing, but I like continuity. Also, continuity with Babs.
+ Diesel-powered sewing machines.
+ Oh god, I just noticed the Wilhelm scream.
+ Fruit bats!
+ <b>Raise This Barn:</b> I can't say much for the lyrics, but holy crap, Applejack finally got a song! And it totally fits, and it's totally amazing. Best song this season outside the finale, hands down. Also the sequence introduces Fiddlesticks! (And I really like the ""get down if you're scared of heights"" part.)
+ DEEEAAAAAD!

- Apples from Manehattan; NOT THE ORANGES.
- Hello, reused Rainbow Dash footage from season 1.
- Worst tongue-twister ever.
- Git 'r dun. :|

~ There are few types of episodes I like more than the family-oriented ones. And this one, like Family Appreciation Day, also comes with a goodly amount of worldbuilding. Applejack's well-intentioned enthusiasm is highly entertaining, and the interactions of the side characters ring true to anyone who's ever been to a family reunion of their own. Plus, a great song!</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Spike at Your Service""><b><u>Spike at Your Service</u></b>
+ Spike's to-do list really sums up why his character is so charming. He's just a little boy, after all.
+ Holy crap, I just realized that hot air balloon, with Cherry Berry as the pilot, is the same one Fluttershy plans to board in the finale. @_@
+ I don't care what anyone says, the CGI timberwolves are friggin' sweet. As is knowing that they can come apart and float back together. And form into a giant timberwolf king.
+ ""You even look good when you're chewing.""
+ Rainbow Dash is writing a self-insert fanfic about the Wonderbolts. <i>EVERYTHING IS CANON</i>
+ Pinkie's plan and also mustache.
+ Rainbow Dash is really awesome at being a timberwolf.
+ Timberwolf king choking on a rock is amazingly hilarious. (Thank you, Polsky.)

- Spike is somehow terrible at everything despite having been Twilight's number one assistant for <i>how</i> long?
- Yeah, there's something to be said against even cheesy damsels in distress.

~ The Dragon Code is a plot device wholly contrived to make this episode happen, that will doubtless never be mentioned again. Also, as far as I can tell, Spike made it up himself, so he brought all that pain onto himself. Not to mention that he created it knowing that it could potentially take him away from Twilight, something that the opener of this season specifically said was his greatest fear. <i>Why would he do that?</i> Furthermore, Twilight <i>knows</i> about it; <i>why would she</i> let <i>him do that</i>? This is yet another Williams episode (penned with the dubious Dave Polsky, no less) that just makes no sense at all. Worse, it's not even <i>bad</i>, per se, at least not in the sense of infuriating (unless you're infuriated at there being yet another sub-par episode); it just may as well have never happened, for all that the plot spawns from nothing and nothing changes by the end of the episode. Not to mention there's very little in it worth seeing; everything that is, has a timberwolf in it.</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Keep Calm and Flutter On""><b><u>Keep Calm and Flutter On</u></b>
+ Possibly the best reference in an episode title.
+ Princess Celestia being in a ""normal"" sort of episode is always nice.
+ Fluttershy has the worst names for her animals, and it's adorable.
+ Cave squirrel; saber-toothed bunny.
+ Oh yeah, Discord can hear while stoned. More fanon validated.
+ Awesome/hilarious Discord things: Discord vs. Angel. Discord lamp. The red carpet thing. Gravy boat. Rainbow Dash vs. candles. Soup tureen. Ice skating judges. Tiny ice skate booties for Fluttershy.
+ ""Are you eating... paper?"" ""Am I? Huh. How odd of me."" <-- This is the funniest exchange <i>ever</i>.
+ ""Do you think I'm a silly, gullible fool?"" ""Well, only in the sense of being silly and gullible."" Go, Rarity.
+ ""NOT! YOUR! FRIEND!"" One of Fluttershy's finer moments, and a followup from Putting Your Hoof Down.

- Why did we need another Discord episode? It's one case of a character returning that I do not appreciate.
- Oh boy, recap of season 2 opener.
- Just kind of throwing the Elements around like it's a bad fanfic. Seriously, they need to be reserved for adventure episodes (although it's great that they still exist, considering the last two adventure eps were solved by Princess Fucking Cadence.)
- Fluttershy being overly aware of the Stare. Which she supposedly can't control.
- Twilight's plan to use mind-control magic on Discord.
- Why is there randomly a ""protect Elements from Discord"" spell that wasn't used before?
- Yeah, that line at the end that was really hyped up on Twitter beforehand? It wasn't that great.

~ Seriously. <i>Why was this episode necessary?</i> I mean, it's awesome that John DeLancie enjoys his work on MLP, but there was that whole rumor about him being Star Swirl the Bearded that would have been way cooler... That said, there's a lot of great Discord action in this to enjoy (again, that's what Polsky does best), so the episode is entertaining, unlike, say, the two before it. But the place where it breaks is: can you believe that Discord actually cares about having a friend? His reactions hardly come across as sincere, after all.
~ Basically, this episode is just a setup for the finale, so they'll have the Elements again. Boo.</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Just for Sidekicks""><b><u>Just for Sidekicks</u></b>
+ Opening photo montage to let us know what happened to Peewee. Brilliant storytelling (even if I wanted him to still be around :().
+ Okay, the owl's pretty good in the intro.
+ Kind of part one of the next episode, but happening at the same time; again, brilliant storytelling, and something totally new for the show.
+ Pets interacting. Spike vs. Angel. Angel vs. Sweetie Belle.
+ The ""...Angel."" cut sequences.
+ Seeing more of Tank and his relationship with Rainbow Dash. EMBARRASSING NUZZLE
+ <i>Industrial-sized pet hair dryer</i>.
+ Apollo is back!
+ Pony/Donut Joe cameo.

- Zecora totally fucked him, what the hell? Also, she is totally racist against dragons.

~ The Equestrian gem-finance system is completely indecipherable. The CMCs buy all that crap with the tiniest gem?
~ This episode just further proves that Spike is a pet.
~ The lesson is fairly weak, overshadowed by the rest of the episode just being pretty damn good.</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Games Ponies Play""><b><u>Games Ponies Play</u></b>
+ Getting to see Just for Sidekicks scenes play out from the other side. Again, really amazing writing planning these two episodes out.
+ Rainbow Dad!
+ ""Ahh, so relaxing!""
+ That breathing thing is a great running gag. Also, I started doing that for a few weeks after the episode aired; it helped!
+ The mixup is obvious from the start, but watching it throughout the episode is a riot. Miss Peachbottom is also a riot.
+ Rainbow Squeak. (Thank you, Polsky.)
+ Seriously, Miss Peachbottom is a hoot and a half.
+ ""Cinnamon bun?""

- <i>Why</i> are three ponies who have no relation whatsoever to the Empire on the welcoming committee again?
- Augh, Princess Cadence is in this one! D:
- Rarity gets to save the day by styling hair. NOT A RARITY EPISODE
- Why are the main cast cheerleaders now? (<s>Foreshadowing for Equestria Girls.</s>)
- As someone pointed out, how could Miss Peachbottom deal with a train ride if she's that claustrophobic?
- Pinkie is the worst tour guide. (Rainbow Dash, for the record, is best tour guide.)

~ The big problem with this one (other than this not being the kind of episode Dave Polsky can pull off) is the shoehorned-in Rainbow Dash moral, which really doesn't make any sense. It drives focus off the plot and confuses the ending. There's just something missing in this one.</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Magical Mystery Cure""><b><u>Magical Mystery Cure</u></b>
+ Fuck yes cold musical opening. Only the second episode, after Party of One, to do so!
+ <b>Morning in Ponyville/Life in Equestria:</b> I really love these. The first is great because you know damn things things are not going to be perfect through the end of the song. (The only weird bit is that dancing on the table thing; what? Not to mention it doesn't line up with the castanets either time.) And of course, as someone else pointed out, the reprise is great because it ends the season with Twilight telling us that everything is going to be ""just fine"". That's a pretty unsubtle nod to the expected fandom reaction. Good show, guys.
+ Quills and Sofas returns!
+ <b>What My Cutie Mark Is Telling Me:</b> Great song. As far as the big theatrical musical numbers in this show go, this is probably the best. It's a fun way to condense the explanation part of the plot down. Pinkie's part is the best.
+ Fluttershy fails at everything. Spike does Gangnam Style (you know damn well that's what that is). Vinyl Scratch.
+ Flat-maned Pinkie Pie singing with a Southern accent. She cannot be more adorable.
+ Book from the opener reappears!
+ So many shout outs to other episodes! Thank you Spike for keeping continuity.
+ <b>I've Got to Find a Way:</b> BEST SONG. I love Rebecca Shoichet's singing voice, and she really gets to cut loose on this one, making it heartfelt and emotional. The piano line in the background is just beautiful.
+ Cannibal animal revolution. Best bear.
+ ""...Or maybe I'm still having it.""
+ HOLY SHIT THEY BLEW UP TWILIGHT
+ Celestia is all proud of Twilight and stuff.
+ <b>Celestia's Ballad:</b> Absolutely beautiful. There's a reason Nicole Oliver has charmed the hell out of the fandom with this song. Also, I love it because of, well, the above note.
+ Rainbow Dash's reaction to Twilight getting wings.
+ Pinkie Pie's reaction to Twilight getting wings.
+ Liquid pride is so another readymade catchphrase.
+ Oh yeah, we get Derpy back. :B

- Rainbow Dash's cutie mark doesn't mean weather control. Rarity's isn't for dressmaking.
- <b>A True, True Friend:</b> I really don't like this song. It's like Smile, Smile, Smile with all the goodness taken out of it (the callout to SSS doesn't help matters). It hammers home its point continually, Pinkie gets majorly shafted for her part, and then they have a fucking parade because ugh, why? It did, however, make me realize that all of Twilight's friends, and a lot of other characters in the show, have dactylic names, perfect for a song like this.
- Holy shit that incantation makes no sense at all.
- Celestia's reaction to Twilight getting wings, and the whole all of them bowing to her thing.
- Twilight's reaction to Twilight getting wings. <i>She never fucking cared about being a princess, dammit.</i>
- Oh god, the dresses the princesses are wearing are awful.
- <b>Behold, Princess Twilight Sparkle:</b> WORST SONG EVER. ANY SEASON. EVER. Holy shit, call the last five minutes of this episode Much Ado About Nothing. Ugh, there's nothing like a healthy helping of aggrandizement to severely ruin a character. It's actually worse than the end of the season opener. Like, this song and everything it represents is literally the worst thing ever.

~ Too much has been said about this episode already. Where the season opener should have been one episode, this should have been two. It certainly feels like two. Plus, why was this particular feat worthy of princesshood? Certainly, Twilight's had to help out her friends with magic before; why is this instance of that more important than any of the multiple times she's saved the entirety of Equestria? Just... this episode has a ton of holes in it, whether you care about the outcome or not.

I think I'd put season three between seasons one and two, as far as overall enjoyment goes. It does a lot of cool things, goes places we haven't gone, but sadly shoves a bunch of subpar episodes right next to one another. I can only hope that Polsky and Williams have less saturation in season four, and <i>never team up again</i>. Seriously.

"event","I had this weird SCP-themed dream two nights ago.

The skip was terrorizing a men's bathroom at some place I was, and the Foundation swooped in to snatch it up. It was one of those need to pee, so takes place in a bathroom dreams. (Interestingly, I ""knew"" it would become SCP-735, which I just looked up and that turned out to be an insult box, so no.) After the skip had been contained, I was interviewed by an Agent Dawn, a Colson-esque man in a tan suit who seemed somewhat bored. He became ever so slightly irritated as I began to demonstrate knowledge of the Foundation and generally started fanboying at him. The moment I remember most is when he pulls out a thin hypodermic needle. I asked him, ""Ooh, are you going to give me an amnestic now?"" (I even used the correct term!) He just sighs, rolls his eyes, and jams it into the side of my neck as I close my eyes in anticipation. When I opened my eyes, I demonstrated the erasing of my memories by reciting population statistics from four contiguous counties in South Carolina and patting him on the shoulder. Weird dream.

Last night, I had this grand sweeping dream that I can only remember the end of. I was some kind of millionaire playboy inventor, whose name was Tony Stark but who was not <i>that</i> Tony Stark. I had had this huge mansion built for me. It was some kind of weird story, where I wanted it built to live in, but also with this woman who was a friend/rival who I ended up marrying because why not, so we could live in it together as a testament to something or other. It was a weird relationship.

Anyway, we would host these swanky parties and so forth, and there was one of those going on. I can't remembered what happened -- if I did something or said something, or if someone else said something -- but my wife ends up leaving in tears and I'm like, the fuck? I tracked her down to a bathroom where she's taking a bath and crying. (I could see her boobs; they were great.) And I'm walking around with my arms out like I want to hug her and she's just sobbing and shouting Leave me alone! And that was when I realized everything was changing. It was kind of a realization that the relationship wasn't based on love or something like that, and would be coming to an end. I smashed something off a banister, then cried for approximately ten seconds. Then there was some weird doodly with a kleenex box as I guess my mind can't hold a thought for too long. :B I dunno, it would make an interesting story if I could suss out the relationship dynamic in play. Also, thinking about it helped me get through my shitty-ass day somehow."

"event","I think I wrote something a while back about the recurring settings in my dreams, malls being a particularly odd standout. Well, I've lately come across a new recurrence: dreams wherein I am the Doctor. (Tenth, to be exact.) I have no idea why.

Two nights ago, I actually had trouble sleeping due to nightmare. I don't often have nightmares, and when I do I have a tendency to be able to say, ""Okay, things are getting scary, time to stop."" and go on to a new dream. This time, though, it was one of those where you wake up and as soon as you close your eyes, you're back in the same dream.

The premise was pretty simple. It started off in a restaurant located in a house (it had been converted to such) that would disappear and reappear between two fixed locations. If you were inside the house when it dematerialized, you became part of the house and couldn't leave. A whole bunch of people, like a tour or something, had come into the restaurant just before a dematerialization event, and I lamented their entrapment. It was later that I was revealed to be the Doctor.

Most of the dream was just going around being trapped in the house, nothing in particular. Towards the end, I figured out how to use the Tardis (this has never happened before!), timing its own dematerialization to that of the house's, in order to escape. I gave a whoop of victory, then turned that bitch right around so we could go save the rest of the people. Going back to the house was where the nightmare imagery really showed up, though, as I met this old hillbilly who'd been trapped there for a really long time and he showed me upstairs where there were glowing red runes carved in the walls and a heavy implication that he was doing unspeakable things up there. I kind of woke up and didn't do more than doze until my alarm went off. :B

Last night, I dreamed that I ended a friendship and it hurt. In wakeful hindsight, I realize I do not in fact like that person and so I don't care. :D Yay."

Okay, so, Games Ponies Play? Not bad, not great, just weird, like a lot of other Polsky eps. As for the finale, well... I'm actually coming into it with no expectations (I think). No knowledge whatsoever, actually, since I've avoided ALL SPOILERS at least related to clips of the episode. I know what happens at the end (known in the fandom for a good month now) and what the episode's big thing otherwise is (spoiled by commercials; also saw an image this morning that shows the extent of the changes being made).

oh, a rprise! good!

whoa, not credits music! :O

OKAY< SHUT UP MiSS AMERICA

All right. It happened. It's official. It was really fucking epic. I'm going to have to watch this a few more times before I can really decide on how I feel about it, I think. I can say that the episode was good, and that everything after Twilight appearing back in Ponyville was pretty much lame. the issue is that you've got this big, momentous occasion that no one really cares about. It's sort of the same problem that we had at the end of Crystal Kingdom; it's all about inordinately congratulating Twilight on a job well done. That, and I think this could have been a double-length ep, though I won't begrudge the song montages, because hot damn were those songs good! So for now, a tentative ""best episode"" ranking. I'm going to marathon the series sometime soonish and do a full writeup like I did last year, and we'll see where things stand then.

I know KC&FO has been creating a lot of controversy in the fandom. I think that I can say, unashamedly, that I really like it. It's definitely Polsky's best episode (though I also have nothing against Feeling Pinkie Keen). Just like FPK, the moral can be taken a number of ways, and I prefer to see it as, ""Be nice to people, but don't let them push you around."" Which, I mean, we've seen before on the show, but coming from Fluttershy, it carries a different weight (I actually really love the ""NOT. YOUR. FRIEND!"" scene). And I take Celestia's diffidence in the opening as a sign of her detachment from mortal ponies. Also I had completely forgotten that the beavers were in Magic Duel. :B But yes; I'd been expecting an awful reformation episode and instead got a hilarious series of sight and character gags followed by just enough lampshading to make the ending tolerable. It's not a perfect episode (notably, the damned self-awareness on display throughout), but I like it, so there.

Okay, so: if you watch this on the Hub, you doubtless know of that one commercial with the annoying song that goes, ""It's all about the money, money, money, ch-chang, b-blang"" etc. I don't even know what it's for, I just know the song. Well, I heard the original today: ""Price Tag"" by Jessie J. And the original lyrics are, ""It's <i>not</i> about the money."" I have no particular love for Jessie J as an artist (she's good, but she's also just another one of those rap/pop/R&B singers who are so popular right now), but that really incensed me. I mean, songs get rewritten for commercials all the time, but to completely change the meaning of the lyrics so that they're 100% against what they originally were? Makes me mad. Ugh.

So, to quell that music-induced rage, I demand that you all go listen to <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Se1ITKz3ia8"">this</a>. I mean right now. RIGHT NOW LISTEN TO IT

<lj-cut text=""Just for Sidekicks"">I am incredibly psyched for this episode based on the two spoiler clips. I hope that doesn't backfire on me.

That was a very strange episode. Fun, fluffy, not as good as Secret of My Excess, but definitely better than your average Spikeisode. Probably not as good as I'd been hoping, but solid. I have no complaints at the moment, other than maybe ""it could have been better."" Though it definitely could have been worse. And we need some more goddamn songs this season! D:

"event","I'm not sure I've actually seen Spike at Your Service a second time, but I've decided it's really not all that good. And most of the shippable moments are between Spike and Applejack, so I'm not even writing them down. :| Still putting it above the opener, but only just. Also decided that Raise This Barn is the best song.

Sleepless in Ponyville is the also-ran today. I may not like SaYS, but I wanted to see the timberwolves again. :( Ah well. As for today's episode... I have so many trepidations about this. I have since the synopsis was released. If you're reading this on fimfic, you already know about that. I just... Why was this necessary to be made? Hopefully it won't suck by the end, but I'm not betting on it. :|

And can i just say wow, but I've seen some awful commercials this morning, and the one for the LPS DVD is maybe the worst? It sounds like someone's mom recorded it in their kitchen using a pot lid to block out ambient noise.

But to the perfect storm of potential suck ahead...

<lj-cut text=""Keep Calm and Flutter On"">""Mishap"". Mm-hmm. Like ""Hey Fluttershy, I <i>accidentally</i> dropped the soap, can ya help me out here?""

Her! Who I do not know the name of!

omg celestia yayyyyy

holy shit Twilight confirmed for RCV

Celestia is the master of understatement

THANK YOU FOR THE RECAP EVERYPONY

lol whipped cream

the fandom's gonna have a field day with that

what this is terrible

THANK YOU FOR THE RECAP IT'S LIKE WATCHING THE SEASON TWO OPENER AGAIN

yeah, it's not like they need two Rainbow Dashes

WHAT THAT IS BULLSHIT

fuck yes angry beavers

I love her names for animals SO MUCH

>language

There is nothing about this scene that is not amazing

That was awesome

she just needed to call them maggots

this doesn't seem possible XD

that line is incredibly hilarious

It is SO AWESOME seeing them wear those again

holy shit they've actually using them omg

and it's not even a season finale!

He can't

he's gonna poop

Mom: ""Ponies. Why did it have to be ponies?""
Max: ""Because Hasbro.""
Mom: ""Hasbro has a lot to answer for.""
Me: ""Yes. Yes they do!""

Angel vs. Discord round 1 FAITO

like he did ONCE, ugh

one problem with this epiosode is that it's just a little too self-aware

BEST LAMP EVER

I can't wait for someone to make one.

>love

yes, leaving her alone with Discord is a good idea

but no tthe dragon-legged one

but we don't have sleeves

oh man, you relaize that baby discord is kind of canon

""Am I?"" XD I think that may supplant Rainbow Dash whinnying in her sleep as the best gag in this show

that's weird

Oh and Twilight agrees

I kind of thought he'd been eating books

>shipping

I am gonna barf @_@

Discord confirmed for Janus

oh wow, I didn't think he'd lifted the whole house

WHAT ARE THE BEAVERS PLOTTING

because mind-control spells are the best way to convince someone to use their magic for good of their own free will

Fluttershy, you are so adorable

oh boy dinner party :D

she sounds so confident lol

THE BEAVERS

WATCH THE BEAVERS

that was awesome

big crown thingy!

wow Fluttershy grew a backbone :O

uh-oh

DON'T DO IT

and then Spike was Fluttershy

YES JUDGES

Fluttershy saying ""Why I oughta"" is the best thing ever

dem booties

promises...

the ice saktes or the necklace, it's your choice

goddammit Fluttershy

Max: ""Because she's the Element of >Honesty.""

fuuuuuck

BACK IN THE STATUE OR HATE THIS FOREVER

time for the lovin's

oh yeah :D we can write stories about them having the Elements again

lol

Well that was an incredibly clever combination of amazing and terribly dumb. I think I'm gonna go with ""I liked it more than I expected"" and be happy.

"event","SO! Story time. I donated 10 Euros to Bronies for Good's Seeds of Kindness 2 charity drive because I wanted the album. Somehow, I got on their ""give our top donors something nice for Christmas"" list. I wondered vaguely why that had happened, filled out their little form (they gave a list of a bunch of offers, had people rank them, and then doled them out based on something, I dunno), and then forgot about it.

So I was pleasantly surprised when they got back to me on that today. Beginning with the blurb, ""Thanks to your generous donation of 3,000 Euros...""

HOLD

THE GODDAMN

PHONE

That is 4 grand in real monies. D: I do not have that much money. At all. I can't remember the last time I did, or even <i>if</i> I did.

After a brief period of panic, during which my core temperature dropped noticeably, I dialed up Paypal and my bank and have determined that, A) I still have all my money as I should, and B) I paid 10 Euros to some German thingy that sounds like a charity. I do definitely remember having paid something to this thing once; I can't remember if they're the same thing, but I figure they are.

Anyway, I just heard back from them and it turns out the guy who sent the email just fucked up. I am actually owed a prize, it seems (I have no idea why!), and he just got the email wrong. I know that <i>someone</i> donated the 3k, and I salute that person. And now I get an art commission from someone I've never heard of!

That dude is just lucky he's behind the charity organization's email address. <.< Or I would know who he is and hate him forever.

So after that little fiasco, I am feeling pretty okay and extremely awake. :D How are you?"

"event","Had a weird dream last night. I was in ruralish Tennessee, staying at a hotel, doing... something, I dunno what. I ended up leaving with this preteen girl who could drive a pickup (because I needed a ride, y'know?) and we start down the road, only to be stopped a short ways away by some redneck. And something about the way he was acting led me to think, ""He is going to kill me and rape this girl.""

So I shot him in the head.

No idea where the gun came from.

And then apparently I shot another dude who was his friend and was likely to do the same thing. In the meantime, the girl escaped in the pickup, and I walked back to the hotel, where I was like, ""I need to stay another night because I just killed two guys."" And realize, I'm all bedraggled and covered in blood at this point.

Then out of one of the offices comes the IT guy from work, holding a gun pointed at me. And for the first time, I have the thought that what I'd just done was maybe not <i>right</i>. So I put my arms up and got on my knees and eventually my face (while not knowing how to surrender properly lol) and he came over and sat on me. He's a fatty, nerdy sort, you see, so it was uncomfortable. And we waited for the police to show up.

And when they didn't show after a few hours, the dream got bored and changed to something else. It was, and I am not kidding...

Cobra Commander sitting in an empty councilroom and arranging a wedding between gay horses overseen by little girls.

I had this nice panorama shot of this empty room, and then he starts barking orders at a viewscreen and this gaggle of pink-wearing little girls comes out and have this practice wedding with a dollhouse filled with cupcake frosting and fake plastic horses. The lead girl takes and puts the horses butt to butt, and then pretends to officiate the wedding in a fake pastor voice (there was a little minister doll in there). The line that sticks out is, ""Do you swear to make every day Gay Horse Day?"" Followed by a ""yes"".

To which my reaction was, ""Dear Princess Celestia, today I learned that every day is Gay Horse Day.""

And sometime after that, in another dream, I found a Great and Powerful Tristan brushie at Walmart.

I can't tell if I'm watching too much ponies or not enough."

Oh yeah, and did you notice that Apple Bloom is bucking trees now? Time's passing! She's growing up! Also, Pinkie gets added to the list of ""ponies allowed to burp"" with Apple Bloom and not Berry Punch. :B

<lj-cut text=""Spike at Your Service"">So the spoiler clip wowed me with the crazy-ass CGI.

Twelve books! Ah-ah-ah!

TIMBERWOLVES :D

Yeah, this CGI is fucking amazing. They're like cell-shaded or something.

>yfw this is all a ploy by Applejack to win Spike's heart. SOMEONE WILL WRITE IT

I'm sad that these amazing predators are that easy to destory

FUCKING GRUESOME

And then Kkat had more fuel for the silly ""MLP is grimdark"" theory.

I was lying through my teeth!

Granny's all what in the sam hell is that purple thing?

holy shit he sucks at everything

Max: ""Spike's the sorcerer's apprentice. And one radioactive accident away from toxic crusader!""

Granny confirmed for knowing who Twilight is

how many books has she read?

not even one? I am disappoint D:

wait, what

Spike this is the worst code

and then the Sombra door prophecy comes true

FOREEEEVER!

nice save! that's what Soarin loves about her

like his stinky feet

the solution is to kill him

sure, Rarity, whatever

it's better than Sweetie Belle's!

okay, it's as good as Sweetie Belle's

oh god spike stop

wait he just revealed his crush to her

that's kind of amazing

of course Rainbow Dash likes this

hay smashing sounds fun

trust Rainbow Dash to take advantage of a situation like this

Rarity is afraid of pipes

Spike has a good sense of balance

there is no good news

oh Rainbow :V

Max; ""And then Rainbow Dash DIED.""

that little prance... you're hardly a dragon, Spike :B

oh god

that is slightly creepy

can't wait for the remixes

WHOA

he almost sent her back to the mirror pool!

she's still on that first book!

hahaha, her Twilight sense went off

Max: ""You press the select button as part of it.""

best thing ever

nice plan, Pinkie!

>Moustache

yes

I'd been waiting for that clip to show up, and as anticipated, it was a propos of nothing.

there's no way this plan can go horribly wrong

you don't know him very well, do you Twilight?

man, it's good to see the party cannon again

>yfw Spike is the voice of reason

what was that

NOW she gets reading done

I'm really happy to hump your leg!

That was... something. <.< Kind of a weird episode. The ending was worth it at least. Gonna have to watch this one again to place it properly, I think.

Hopefully it won't just be ponies this time.

<b>January</b>
Well, everyone else is doing it. Let's see why I consider 2011 to have totally sucked ass.

(This year has thankfully been better!)

<b>February</b>
So I haven't been on the internet at large for the past two days. I've been ensconced in the archives of a place known as the SCP-OH GOD OH MAN OH GOD OH MAN CuddleUppets are the most horrifying thing I've seen over the last 72 hours, SCP-173 included. @_@

<b>March</b>
Saw the spoiler clip for this (MLP S02E19) yesterday and it looks promising. :3 Still not enthused about the new starting time, however. :|

<b>April</b>
Even my dreams are trolling me, with images of fictitious women who are actually interested in me.

<b>May</b>
<lj-embed id=""19""/>

<b>June</b>
You realize most of my content has been those weekly MLP episode writeups? :/ I have nothing to say here anymore, it seems, other than reviewing stuff and promoting my own work.

<b>July</b>
So I've finally found a way to watch season 2 again: Max and I are done with Transformers Animated and not looking forward to starting the Unicron Trilogy, thus are looking for reasons to procrastinate. Hence: two-week marathon.

<b>August</b>
Today, after something like 15 years of using Winamp, I finally upgraded from 2.6 to 5.whatever.

<b>September</b> (Note that my ONLY post that month was from the 27th.)
I had a dream I was listening to this random CD and after like three tracks, I realized I really liked it.

<b>October</b>
<lj-embed id=""27""/>

<b>November</b>
The dumbhead (Max) locked himself out of his car and also apartment, so we waited half an hour for his building supe to show up and unlock it. :V

<b>December</b>
WTF, LJ just changed their journal entry layout? D: This is awful looking! Fuuuuuck.

Okay, so like, half ponies. :B It really wasn't a bad year, anxiety-inducing job aside. At least I have money and have lost 40 pounds (how much I've gained this week remains to be seen!) Things could be worse, I guess!"

"event","So back when Daniel Ingram first posted the songs from the first episode of LPS, I said to myself, ""Okay, I'll give this a shot."" Max and I started watching the premiere after ponies one day, but he didn't last more than five minutes. I told myself that one day, I would sit down and watch the first episode myself, and today was apparently that day.

...I couldn't last much longer.

I liked Blythe's dad immediately, because he's adorably dorky and rather hilarious. Mrs. Twombley (what a name!) seems like an interesting character as well. But the rest? I was about two-thirds of the way through the episode before I said, ""You know what? I just don't care."" The pets just aren't that interesting, and neither is Blythe (and when she screams, she sounds like Rainbow Dash, which, go figure, but it's still weird). Also, the song wasn't as good as it was the first time around.

So, I'll just be sticking to ponies and robots, thanks, Hub."

At least I'll get to see it again today, but the bad news is the fandom reaction has been so negative I may be unable to enjoy it now. Seriously, these people talk good. I've switched around my episode ratings, too, realizing I actually enjoyed Sleepless in Ponyville far more than I think I did.

I expect to lose a lot of story ideas to this episode. :B

WAIT THEY'RE SHOWING FUCKING HEARTH'S WARMING EVE? D: THIS IS FUCKING AWFUL I HATE THIS EPISODE

Well, fuck this noise then, I'm watching it on YouTube. >:| And as I'm sitting here watching it, I'm going, ""You know, this is kind of a nothing episode."" And the abrupt ending doesn't help. So I think it's going down in the ranks. It's not bad, per se, it just doesn't live up to its own potential. ""I think I should be best pony, ma'am!""

GOOD EPISODE. Applejack once again knocks it out of the park. Max was predicting another Applebuck Season, but it totally isn't. AJ just missed the point by focusing on the wrong things. Plus song, and a good one at that! It's a country song, but I don't care, because it was the right kind of country: a square dance! Solid lesson, lots of fun characters, and lots of continuity.

25th anniversary. Free fanmade, Capcom-blessed crossover game. Oh yeah.

Sadly, in the few hours since I was reminded of the game's existence, I've heard nothing but negativity over it, some of it unfounded and some of it not.

In short, it plays like a Mega Man game, but the first thing you'll doubtless notice is that some of the stages are... lacking. Lacking in variety, lacking in length, you name it.

Also, the bosses are excruciatingly hard. Most of them, anyway. They play like Street Fighter characters, and they even have super bars, which is completely unfair. You can't knock them down or dizzy them, even with the attack they're weak to. But through my first playthrough, I beat 5 of them. :V

Last but most certainly not least, there is no save or password feature. This is a tremendous oversight, and doubtless will keep me from diving back in without a good afternoon to devote to it.

But not all is hopeless. As punishing as some of the stages can be, they're pretty generous with the powerups. You're not likely to die from health loss (until you reach the boss, anyway), though there are definitely plenty of instakill traps around. In fact, they're so generous with powerups that sometimes energy tanks will just <i>show up in a fucking wall or in the middle of nowhere</i>. This is not the best alpha release.

Your other advantage, interestingly enough, is that you can destroy almost any shot, including your own that have been reflected back at you. Most will take three normal hits or a powered-up buster shot.

So, here's a quick rundown of bosses, stages and weapons, to the best of my knowledge.

<b><u>Rolento</u></b>
<b>Stage:</b> Has lots of explodey things. Wasn't too hard.
<b>Boss:</b> First boss I reached, and the first I beat. I can't really remember how the battle went, so I can't offer any strategies. Lots of jumping is suggested, he throws bombs constantly.
<b>Weapon:</b> The ""Mine Sweeper""? Ugh. Well, it's a lot like Napalm Man's weapon, which is to say bloody hard to use at medium range.

<b><u>Dhalsim</u></b>
<b>Stage:</b> Pretty fantastic. Almost as annoying as Astro Man's. A series of puzzle rooms with the same three enemies. Hint: the entrance to the boss room is past a long slide corridor.
<b>Boss:</b> Whenever he teleports, he's moving to where you were, or right above it, so fucking move. He's vulernable as hell from the back while Yoga Flaming. He's actually extremely predictable, and his drill attack is very slow.
<b>Weapon:</b> Yoga Inferno. Interesting in that using it locks you horizontally until the shot is done.

<b><u>Urien</u></b>
<b>Stage:</b> Really awesome platforming. Feels like a true Mega Man stage. Note that the shake-and-then-fall platforms can kill you if you stand under them.
<b>Boss:</b> Not overly hard. His super lets him make a shot reflector, but he usually only does it in the corner (sometimes up high!), so it's easy to avoid. Still haven't beaten him yet.
<b>Weapon:</b> n/a

<b><u>Ryu</u></b>
<b>Stage:</b> Really fucking boring. Lots of flame sword soldiers and shinobi robots. Note the shinobi can be avoided, usually by destroying the walls they guard.
<b>Boss:</b> COMPLETELY UNFAIR. RYU CAN HURRICANE KICK THROUGH ALL YOUR WEAPONS. THIS IS FUCKING IMPOSSIBLE.
<b>Weapon:</b> n/a

<b><u>Blanka</u></b>
<b>Stage:</b> Combination jungle and water. The floaty enemies are kind of annoying toward the end, but provide a good source of powerups. The enemies in general are a lot of fun.
<b>Boss:</b> He's pretty straightforward, with lots of spinny attacks. Make sure you jump right after he supers or he'll hit you with the shockwave. Weakness is Yoga Inferno.
<b>Weapon:</b> I can't not spoil this: <i>you do not get an electric attack from Blanka</i>. Instead you get <b>a goddamn watermelon</b>. THIS IS A TRAVESTY. Remember the Mega Ball? Yeah, no one liked using that, either.

<b><u>Rose</u></b>
<b>Stage:</b> Awesome. The first half is like Tengu Man's, flying on Rush. Unfortunately, pushing left causes you to face left, which is stupid. The rest if made of ladders and not too bad.
<b>Boss:</b> She does lots of sliding and teleporting. Tropical Hazzard is her weakness (I think), and is really necessary for beating her.
<b>Weapon:</b> Soul Satellite. Very awesome shield weapon, as it lets you fire while it's up too.

<b><u>C. Viper</u></b>
<b>Stage:</b> A FUCKING NIGHTMARE. First, the elevators only move when you're not standing on them, which means lots of jumping to make them go up. Unfortunately, they can kill you both by landing on you <i>and by trapping you at the top of the screen</i>, which is retarded since you have to <i>ride them up into the next screen</i>. <i>Then</i>, you get to a fucking Quick Man section and I haven't been able to get past it, it's ludicrous.
<b>Boss:</b> Only boss I have not battled.
<b>Weapon:</b> n/a

<b><u>Chun Li</u></b>
<b>Stage:</b> Easy and boring.
<b>Boss:</b> Not too hard, though it took me three tries to beat her. Start with her, though, she's by far the slowest. Any time you see her lift into the air, slide towards her. Note that she's vulnerable after doing the scissor kick, and after doing her super, which always lands in the same area of the screen.
<b>Weapon:</b> Lightning Kick. I haven't really used it much, but it's... well, Chun Li's Lightning Kick.

Seriously, Lightning Kick? And <i>not</i> a spark attack from Blanka? What were they thinking? ._."

"event","Saw the Hobbit today. It was good. <a href=""http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/escape-to-the-movies/6620-The-Hobbit-An-Unexpected-Journey"">MovieBob</a> more or less hit it right on the nose with his review, and I don't have a lot to add.

The pacing <i>was</i> good, and it didn't feel nearly as long as it was. At some point, I thought to myself, ""I'm watching a documentary"", for what that's worth. Despite all the extra stuff they threw in, it was easy to follow, which is more than I can say for the damn book (I remember getting lost around when Bilbo first encounters Gollum). The songs were good. 

The main thing I realized after seeing it was that my initial reaction of ""it was just okay"" was actually a reaction to the lack of intensity throughout the movie. I'm used to movies these days being more or less nonstop action, but this one wasn't afraid to stop and take a breather to give out some exposition or let the characters react to what had just happened, and never did it feel like filler. That's probably what lead to my documentary comment; it's just a sense of ""these are the events as they happened"". But the fact is, the stakes aren't all that high in this movie. It's ""get a bunch of dwarves back to their home so they can fight a dragon"", and not until the very end do we see exactly what it is they're up against, literally. So as a first entry in a trilogy, it works remarkably well.

The only downside was I thought the riddle contest between Bilbo and Gollum went on too long without a break. They needed to cut back to the dwarves and show what was going on with them for just a minute after we got the idea of ""okay, this is what they're doing"". That was the only bobble in a nearly 3-hour movie; that's pretty fucking impressive. If you haven't seen it yet, go see it.

I still wanna see Wreck-It Ralph again. :( And Rise of the Guardians."

"event","Second thoughts on Sleepless in Ponyville: You couldn't make a more boring Scootaloo-focused episode featuring Rainbow Dash engaging in Scootalove, Rarity being hilarious, and Luna being amazing if you tried. So I'd say it's overall pretty darn good. :B

So while this episode was leaked online this week and I generally don't avoid spoilers, I'm not that impatient and I have not watched it beyond the ""official"" spoiler clip.

...Angry Birds <i>Star Wars <b>Playset</b>??</i> Man, I wish <i>I'd</i> come up with a stupid little game that everyone loves for no good reason.

<lj-cut text=""Wonderbolts Academy"">Oh yeah, and did I mention that the spoiler clip got me all in love with Spitfire again? :D Best pony.

oh man I love the chin straps on these costumes

>acting like she doesn't know who Rainbow dash is

insubordination!

god I love her outfit

FIVE HUNDRED

NOW! :D

is that Soarin with her? I can't even tell

HELLO NOT RAINBOW DASH

what's her cutie mark?

so totally a Rainbow Dash self-insert

hahaha

Max: ""Pinkie confirmed for Charlie Brown.""

seriously, Pinkie is so in love with her

THATCHA WAK WAK WOUT

time to complain, ma'am!

oh, she's really mad now

and I think you're shit, maggot!

I made this! (It's a poopy.)

oh man, TF2 nerds are gonna love that.

RoidKicker OTP

Thunderdrops OTP?

And two nameless ponies OTP too I guess

this is what you get for playing by the rules

oooh, the plot thickens like Pinkie after the holidays

speaking of...

Pinkie Pie confirmed for John Galt

or a Pinkie package

goddammit, Pinkie Pie (by kits) you have kind of forgotten what Rainbow Dash is like

instead of through the internet

time for a balloon trip, amirite?

oh yeah

did she say 'mammary""?

>yes it is

worst hat

so that's how they make clouds

dat wind

no, they are Snips

haha, electric attack

so Lightning Dust is better, or more willing to push herself, but she's also not Wonderbolts material

Max: ""Lightning Dust confirmed for Magneto.""

DEATH TO CLOUDS

YEAH! I was hoping he'd do it :D

cloudbucking with your teeth, amazing

""You gay?"" ""I'm gay!""

oh snap dog

hurts, don't it?

""This is kind of our fault.""

DENIED

oh snap, tore the uniform

Max: ""Escort this prisoner to the stockades.""

hahahaha!

AND QUIT BEING A NINNY

now she doesn't have a partner though

Spitfire's ass

Wait, that's it? That was a weird place to end. c.c Uhh, I'm not sure how to feel about this. Definitely like the first Michael Bay Transformers movie, if the Transformers were scenes at the academy and the humans were scenes in Ponyville. In other words, not enough Rainbow Dash being awesome. Kind of like this entire series. I'm, uh, not sure where to place this, honestly.

...Hey, this episode of Littlest Pet Shop is called ""Mean Isn't Your Color"" and is about tickets to some kind of <i>ball</i>? Hasbro is out of ideas. :V

Damn, what to do about this episode? I dunno. Placing now, will likely revise next week.

"event","So yeah, Magic Duel? Pretty much the best episode ever. I don't know how they can top it, though given the rumors I've heard that could potentially be about the season finale, it may have a run for its money.

Speaking of rumors and spoilers, I saw the clip for this episode last night and it was incredible weird. I can't even explain why. But hey, Scootasode finally!

But before we get there, creepy thought about One Bad Apple: why does AJ only ever refer to Babs as ""your cousin"" when speaking to Apple Bloom? That's how parents talk. <.< I mean, she's Applejack's cousin too... isn't she?

More thoughts about Magic Duel. Someone complained that Twilight having difficulties lifting a cart or spinning animals around is ridiculous given her performance during Boast Busters with the Ursa. I think, however, that they're missing how Twilight's magic works.

Twilight is, in essence, a power mage. She can cast ridiculously complex spells, but when it comes to levitation or other areas of finesse, she has difficulty. The fact is, Rarity could spin those animals around with no problem; the cart and apples she would have far more difficulty with, however, because of the increased weight. Rarity is a finesse mage.

To Twilight, lifting a cart and a bunch of apples is <i>every bit as difficult</i> as lifting a giant bear, a water tower, and a barn, because she has the magical power to lift large objects, but not the fine control necessary to manipulate more than a few. I'm not sure how well this theory holds up (she is, after all, capable of organizing the library easily, but that could potentially be an 'organize library' spell, versus plain levitation), but I think it helps to explain away seeming inconsistencies.

<lj-cut text=""Sleepless in Ponyville"">Oh hey, there's John deLancie's new voicework, in the naughty or nice commercial!

WHO CAN TAKE A RAINBOW SPRINKLE IT WITH DEW

wahahaha! best response

Holy shit Scootasode was Lunasode too! That brought it out of 'just okay' territory. Admittedly, the rest of it was 'just okay', but I think I'll rank this a bit higher than I had anticipated about halfway through. Man, we've got a lot of new canon and fanon-confirmation to play with now!

Anyway, second thoughts on One Bad Apple are pretty much the same as before: it's a good episode. What's changed is my opinion on the song. I didn't like it the first one and a half times I heard it... and then that changed. Frigging everyone and their brother has done a remix, and I've had it stuck in my head ALL GODDAMN WEEK. So I like it now. It's up there with Winter Wrap-Up, at least.

As for this upcoming episode, the spoiler clips have been blowing my goddamn mind. There is no way this can be anything less than epic. :D

"event","Ever since Trotcon, my pony dreams have been replaced by brony dreams. Guess that just goes to show what matters to me.

In this one, <lj user=""max_the_black""> and I were... going to a meetup, I'm pretty sure. The dream took place in a mall, as so many of mine do, but the map we were following indicated the meetup at a restaurant on the other side of it, and we were cutting through to get there.

We ended up getting waylaid into stopping at a restaurant with some people for a while. I think something happened there, but I forget. The highlight of the dream was after coming down a big escalator, seeing the mall concourse spreading out before us, golden and sparkling, and making our way to the door that would send us in the right direction. Near a fountain surrounded by benches, we ran into not two, but three Nightmare Moon cosplayers. Maybe the meetup was part of a larger convention? I dunno.

One of them was the serious one, wearing a large dress to suggest the character's form. We got her to pose for a picture with the non-serious cosplayer, who was wearing more of a green leather jerkin and who knows why I thought she was Nightmare Moon, but >dreams so yeah. I asked them for a hug, but Serious Moon was like ""lol no"".

The third cosplayer was the weird one. She was crawling around on the floor the whole time, and her costume was more like body paint. I don't think it was, but it had that quality of intimate closeness. Also, she was really pregnant. At some point, I was like, ""Should I tell her I'm writing a story about pregnant Nightmare Moon?"" Even in my dreams, I can't finish anything. ._.

Anyway, it didn't go much beyond that. Non-serious Moon joined our party and we continued on to the meetup, I assume."

Spike takes so much abuse

Now it's time for the other song. Let's see if it's less of a toy commercial in context. It's at least the better of the two.

except it was purple and white

omg dem sheeps

that's not a flugelhorn

probably with magic

Max: ""With a montage!""

you suck at sculpting, Twilight

Well, huh. That was interesting and kind of... not much of anything really. Sombra kind of sucked because he didn't do anything. But, if we take this as the opening of a season which will have an overarching theme, concluding in 13 episodes, I think this works. We'll see.</lj-cut>

"event","A little story. At my workplace, we have a customer who comes in maybe once a month to rent time on one of our machines. They usually process like 20 or so rolls of their material, we bill them for the time spent on the machine, and then we ship all their crap to their plant. This is kind of unusual, because it's actually two people from that company who come here and oversee the work, and they come in from Tennessee. This month, they were here twice.

The two people who come in are an older guy (I swear he has a German accent) and a woman probably around my age, maybe a little older. She is really hot. She has a Southern accent, so  I figure she's probably actually from TN. She usually wears ripped jeans and low-cut tops. She calls everyone ""hun"" or ""babe"" and tends to compliment people on how good they look as opposed to thanking them (i.e., ""You are a beautiful man."")

The most recent time of their appearance here was earlier this week. There was a bunch of confusion with the truck driver and when he was supposed to show up, and she was discussing this with me.

""I can always go distract him. I can act all bubbly and perky, maybe flash some boob.""

To which I could only laugh. And then she closes the conversation with, ""Well, if you need me or my boobs for anything, just let me know.""

<i>How are you supposed to react to that?</i>

Well, I got to thinking and I'm coming up with ""she uses sexual appeal to manipulate people"". She might not even know she's doing it; maybe it's a ""Southern hospitality"" thing and I'm taking it out of context, I don't know. But I am definitely at this point attempting to both ignore this behavior, to resist its influence on me, and to divest myself of my attraction to her. (That's against company policy anyway.)

But yeah, am I right here? Am I crazy? I still don't read people well, but I'm getting better at trying to figure out when I'm being manipulated, because I don't appreciate it. At least I don't see her that often."

He shows up, the Doctor is happy, he does some stuff, he dies. WTF was the point of that besides fanwanking?

But there are things called happy endings. They work best when the hero has lost all hope, their loved ones have died, and then suddenly a spark of change suggests that things aren't as bleak as once thought. But when the Doctor brings back your girlfriend <i>as a piece of sidewalk with a face on it</i>, that is <i>not a happy ending</i>. >:| That is a creepy ending. Or you can combine them and turn it into a crappy ending.

And lastly, I think Raxacoricofallapatorius is pretty much the worst thing to ever come out of this series. It's like every time they bring it up, the writers are going, ""Tee-hee, we made a planet with a silly name! Aren't we clever?"" And everything associated with it ends up being shit. The humor in this episode... UGH, SHIT

Why, writers? What in the blazing blue hell were you thinking? It's just a good narrative hook with some decent characters and then everything turns to shit by the end. How much more of this must I endure?"

"event","Oh, shit, gee, I kinda forgot about this. D: I have given up on writing an actual CG con report, since it's been three weeks and I haven't done it yet. But you can still have this, which is really better titled ""Thing Pookat said before and after Canterlot Gardens"", because that's about the only time when I spent any time with her, and why it's so short.

""I'm illegal in 14 states!""

Me: ""Pookat, do you like fire?""
Pookat: ""Um, uh, no, of course not...""

""It's like a rainbow, except instead of treasure at the end, you find DEATH!""

""Seeya, shit lords!""

""The ass is just seeping everywhere.""

""We're gonna go jump into the opposite of a shower: a con with ponies in it.""

Wolfy: ""Hey, Pookat.""
Pookat: ""Hey, girl.""
Me: ""Hey, Pookat.""
Pookat: ""Hey, girl.""

(In an old lady voice.) ""I remember when Chinese food was fun and exciting. We went to the first Chinese restaurant ever established. It was called 'A Wok'. They didn't have creative names back then.""

And one from Voz de Suenos:
""Walmart is made of Nazis!""

<lj-cut text=""Well, since I actually had like two-thirds of a con report going, here it is, if you care."">Thursday
	Silly me, I thought we weren't going to be leaving until Saturday morning. Luckily, I had the wherewithal to call Max, and found out that, yes, plans had changed again, so I would have to plan and pack in the same night if I was to be ready to leave on Friday. I planned.

Friday
	Somehow, despite it being the last, and thus busiest, day of the month, I got out of work on time. Max picked me up, dropped me off at home, I ate a thing and packed. Then, because Wolfy was working late, we picked up Pookat and headed off without her. The drive was uneventful (minus things Pookat said; see also!) and thankfully brief.
	Now, I did not have a badge because I had not planned on being here on Friday, so there was precisely nothing to do. Max and I got kicked out of the artists' alley but good, and then I kind of just hung around with Pookat for the evening (and eventually got wi-fi at the con). She was dressed as AJ the Engineer, and got mobbed for pictures the moment we walked into the convention center. I met up with kits, Cups and Alex, and heard a lot of Gangnam Style on the bar's jukebox. I also hooked up with Mkanke, DB and Voz de Suenos, and heard MandoPony apparently performing through the wall.
	Sleeping was slightly uncomfortable, but thankfully not as bad as I'd feared. I've never really done the ""hotel room with lots of people at a con"" thing before, so I was afraid I'd end up never getting to sleep. I fell asleep later than I would have liked, but not too late.

Saturday
	Is when I am writing this. The morning was good, as I finally had wi-fi at both hotels (we're staying in a Super 8 next to the Holiday Inn) and got continental breakfast. Tomorrow, I breakfast sooner. <.<
	That out of the way, I followed folks into the con and got my actual badges, then went straight to artist's alley with kits. I spent a good while hanging out with Alex and Cups, resisting the urge to make purchases prior to the alley actually opening, and then browsed the wares, purchasing a modified plastic-hair Pinkie for a friend, a poster from the Brony Thank You Fund (they're organizing a scholarship named for Derpy Hooves; how could I not contribute?), 5 raffle tickets for an SDCC Derpy giveaway, and then a poster tube and subsequent accidental were-Luna button from Toxic Mario. I also showed UC77, artist of Hot Blooded Pinkie Pie, the horrible HBPP I drew that will never show up on my tumblr. :B Then I sat and helped Alex sell mousepads (horsepads!) until Pookat showed up. After she did the rounds, we went to the nearby convenience store for cash, found no food (there isn't any in easy walking distance), and then went back in, whereupon I became obsessed with trying to find a plug to charge my laptop on.
	To this end, I ended up in the Friendship Is Witchcraft panel for about twenty minutes, catching the end of their At the Gala spoof (it's pretty good! occasional fursuits!) and hanging around until I got bored. Luckily, I ran into Cups immediately afterward, and he showed me where the game room was. (I didn't know there was one! And even though it's on the con schedule, which I lack, there is no map!) So now I'm sitting here, mostly being bored, writing this, and occasionally getting glimpses of the Fighting Is Magic tournament going on. I did get to meet Calpain and Phoe, though, which was awesome. I've also seen Sleepless Brony, Hirosashii (I told him I liked his music, and he actually recognized me from Elements of Awesomery!), and I think I saw Forest Rain, though I thought his badge said ""Fart Rain"" so I didn't get to talk to him.
Somewhere in there, Max called me. He hadn't been able to get a badge, despite pre-registering, because his bank blocked the transaction or something, and he didn't find out about it until Wednesday or so. So he got majorly screwed, and you can't do anything here without a badge, so he left. Sadly, Pookat showed up a little later, having procured a staff badge somehow. What're you gonna do, really?
	So along with that, the reason I am bored (and slightly miffed) is that there are precisely two panels I am interested in, neither of which has happened yet. Apparently, they are only having one panel at a time, so if you're not interested in what's going on at any given time (and admittedly, I could be trying to make the best of it in there), there's not really anything else to do aside from artist's alley (hard to get into) or game room (here I am!) It also doesn't help that the staff here seems to be severely uptight about every goddamn thing, and the venue feels small, though it's hard to tell how large it actually is. It's probably just cramped, given that they sold out of badges earlier this week and all. At least here in the game room, there's no one badge checking; it feels less like I'm doing something wrong and I'm finally relaxing. Of course, I'm also hungry and I have no ride.
	This is not to say it's been all bad. I've met, what, four people I know online and have never met before?  I've gotten some swag (though getting back in is gonna be impossible at the moment; hoping there will still be things for me to buy when I do get in later). I've seen some really cool cosplays, starting with Pookat's. There's a dude dressed as Iron Will; a dude dressed as Daring Do with two arrows sticking out of his PITH HELMET THAT IS FOR YOU, CUPS; a Colgate dentist with a surgical mask who I saw transform into Taokaka; a girl dressed as Derpy in a paper bag skirt, who actually has natural strabismus; lots of generally hot girls wearing bright colors and so forth. Once the panels happen (VA script reading and fanfic panel, on Sunday), we'll see how things go.
	Or maybe  I was just hungry. After tracking down kits via Cups and taking Pookat to Chipotle, and eating said Chipotle, I feel much better. I am sitting in the artist's alley at the moment (having snuck the fuck in like a BOSS), and despite the fact that there is less happening here than in the gaming room, I am having a blast. Or at least generally cheerful. Perhaps it's the company. I hung out with Alex while eating (apparently, I look like a person who makes stuff, because people kept talking to me like I had had something to do with his mousepads) then moved over to hang out with kits and write or something.  After chatting with him for a while, scoping out the general goings-on and so forth...
	Out of fucking nowhere, the auction happened. c.c Lee Tockar made lots of noise and was generally really awesome, because he is generally really awesome. I didn't know there'd be a floorshow! It was a blast, and it just goes to show that you can't plan for the awesome things that happen at cons. We're all Sara!  A frigging Pinkie Pie card went for like $460 too as we were leaving.</lj-cut>"

I remember specifically that one of the tracks was by ""Constant X featuring Bobby McFerrin"". Sadly, a search for this only turns up <a href=""http://www.archerytalk.com/vb/showthread.php?t=816139"">one link</a>. Wish I could remember the music, I could recreate it.

Also, in case anyone gives a damn, I wrote a new story for the Elements of Awesomery: http://www.fimfiction.net/story/22454/2/The-Elements-of-Awesomery/The-Adventures-of-Wondercloud-and-Sugar-Rush"

Then came some <a href=""http://fim.413chan.net/art/src/134465064828-readingissexy.png"">Nightmare Moon plot</a>.

Next, I finished reading all the entries for the current /fic/ writeoff, finding some amazing stuff. I can't link to anything yet, because it's still the preliminary author-judging phase, but if you follow pony fic at all, keep an eye out, there's a lot of mind-blowing work in that compilation, and some of the best from a writeoff yet.

Shortly after finishing that, this song appeared in my inbox, and I listened to it a whole bunch of times in a row.

<lj-embed id=""24""/>

Just now, I got back from having gone out a bit. But first, a story.

Back during Trotcon, I ran the Speedfic panel, specifically the reading part, and handed out the prizes. The second-place winner, Jacob Runnels, later handed me a pack of pony trading cards. Attached was a business card for Gaming Grounds, which just so happens to be slightly north of me. Today, I finally decided to go check it out, because I was feeling restless and have been meaning to do so for quite some time now.

It turns out, aside from running tournaments and selling cards, figurines, collectibles and games books, they also had Transformers, specifically most of the current wave of Prime toys. And they had Knock Out, who I've been looking for for the better part of a month. For half price even. :D Better than that, Jacob was there (I gave him back his fic, since I've finally gotten them all typed up), and it turns out the owner is a brony too. There are seriously ponies all over the place. So, awesome new supply store/potential hangout.

Everything adds up to one totally sweet day."

"event","I've been thinking about this episode recently, and specifically about my goofy ""Shipping ruins lives"" moral mentioned during my season writeup.

Well, I actually think the moral was meant to be, ""Leave romance to adults"". Given that the CMCs are standins for the show's youngest viewers, and their message has always been ""Don't be in a hurry to grow up"", I think it not only makes sense, but is a good message to boot."

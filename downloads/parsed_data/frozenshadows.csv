"event","One of my best friends Tim, is looking to start a band, and for some dumb reason, I got myself involved in trying to find people to be in it *slaps herself*
So here it is.....
He wants a band that is in the Doom, Grind Core genre, and a band that has a mix of creed, manson, and professional murder music..... Sounds odd, I know...... Remember, this isn't me thats wanting to start this.... He needs a guitarist, someone who can keep rhythym, and preferably a bass player, since he don't care much for lead. He also needs a drummer, a vocalist, and maybe a person to play keyboards. He is very into black and death metal....... He does not want anyone in his band that does drugs, but he will give exceptions for people who do Mary J...... They have to be reasonably calm, decent, and they have to know what their doing! He lives in the Klamath Falls, Oregon area....... If you are interested...... Write to me at hatebreedluvr@hotmail.com

                    Thank you for your time
                            Tara"

are the words I never said, 
the feelings that I hide,
the lines you never read.

Why can't I be happier?
Todays a brand new day,
When we were together,
you'd wipe my tears away.

Bottled up inside,
are the times I never cared,
the tears that I cried,
my problems I never shared.

Why aren't we still together?
I know you are the one,
Will you take me back?
If you don't I know I'll be done."

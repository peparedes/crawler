"event","Yet I feel as if I'm walking a tightrope without a net and if I fall I'll lose everything. I've got good people who worry about me yet I still feel like I'm never going to be able to make my friends happy. I want nothing more in the world than to make sure my friends are happy and healthy. I could honestly care less about how much I hate being alone. It does bother me though. I've pretty much come to the conclusion that I'm going to be alone for a while. No one should have to put up with me and my constant ""emo-ness"". It's bad enough I put my best friend through it. She definately doesn't need it. 
That brings up another point. I wish I could do more to show her how much she means to me. She's saved my ass way too many times to count. Sometimes I feel guilty because I don't think I'll ever be able to fully repay her. She's just a wonderful person that deserves everything she wants out of life. 
I'm listening to ""Freshmen"" by the Verve Pipe. I feel like crying. I don't know why this song always does this to me but, combined with my current thoughts about how I feel about people and things it's not helping AT ALL.

When I was young I knew everything,
And she, a punk who rarely ever took advice
Now I'm guilt-stricken, sobbin' with my head on the floor
Stopped a baby's breath and a shoe full of rice, no...

BRIDGE:
Can't be held responsible
She was touchin' her face
I won't be held responsible
She fell in love in the first place

CHORUS:
For the life of me 
I can not remember 
What made us think that we were wise and we'd never compromise
For the life of me
I can not believe we'd ever die 
For these sins
We were merely freshmen

My best friend took a week's vacation to forget her
His girl took a week's worth of valium and slept
And now he's guilt-stricken, sobbin'
With his head on the floor
Thinks about her now and how he never really wept he said

BRIDGE
CHORUS

hey yeah yeah yeah yeah
hey yeahhhhhhh
hey yeah yeah yeah yeahhhhhh

We tried to wash our hands of all of this
We'd never talk of our lacking relationships
And how we're guilt-stricken sobbin' with our heads on the floor
We fell through the ice when we tried not to slip we'd say...

BRIDGE

CHORUS x2

We were merely freshmen 
We were only freshmen"

"event","There is poetry in despair, and we sang with unrivaled beauty, bitter elegies of savagery and eloquence. Of blue and grey. Strange, we ran down desperate streets and carved our names in the flesh of the city. The sun has stagnated somewhere beyond the rim of the horizon and the darkness is a mystery of curves and lines. Still, we lay under the emptiness and drifted slowly outward, and somewhere in the wilderness we found salvation scratched into the earth like a message.
                                                                         ~DxH

I've concluded that Davey Havok shall be the mother of my babies when such scientific marvels as a female being able to get a male pregnant are possible.



I just typed a long ass update and decided against posting it because it would be redundant.

Brandi & I are going to stay with Kira for a week. She's getting married. I'm happy for her. I hope it works out. They're on a mission to get me laid while Brandi and I are there. From what I've been told they already have someone in mind for me. I'll see how that goes.

Ok, right now I think I'm going to <i>try</i> to sleep. Lord knows my dreams will wake me up bright and early. I wake myself up before they take the same turn they always do. That, however, is an entry for another time."

Across the oceans and through the trees,
on into eternity.
Hold me like there's no tomorrow.
Kiss me like it's the end of exsistance.

Show me love can't fade.

"event","to see you die would be divine,
i could think of thousands of ways;
to twist the knife as you've done to me.
therein lies the difference between me and you.
i think but do not act upon the ways to bring pain.

only now, am i truly over you.
only now, have the old wounds finally healed.

to hear you silenced would be bliss,
i'd slit your throat myself.
smiling as i bled you dry,
just like you have done so many times.
i'm healing by these mental pictures.

only now, are things truly over.
only now, do i not care.


it's a little dedication to whatever he's calling himself nowadays...to show him how i really feel. god it feels good to finally be rid of him after months of worry. michael bowen is dead to me as he should've been long ago."

He makes me happy. To be corny, my heart skips a beat whenever I hear his voice. With him, I notice all the little things. I notice his laugh, the way he gets over excited about his car because he loves it, I could go on...He told me today that he would be my biggest fan.
I can't wait for him to be here, I just want to be held and to hold him and just snuggle(maybe in the definition Bink gave meh earlier). Hopefully we'll get to go to the Warped Tour together. That would be mega awesome. 

It's been a couple hours since we last talked and I'm still giddy, is that a good sign?"

"event","Right now, I wish I could explain myself fully to everyone. I feel like there's always something I can't tell someone. I'd give anything to be there for my friends. I wish I could do something worthwhile for once. I wish I was something to someone. 
I used to think that if I ignored my problems for long enough they'd go away. If I forgot about WHY I felt a certain way it wouldn't matter anymore. 
I have good friends that are there for me as much as they can be. I have some family that actually cares about me. I did reasonably well in school. Yet I feel like something's missing.
I feel like I'm grayscale in a technicolor world. I feel like I'm fading, losing what definition I truly have.  I'd kill to feel whole.
I can't remember the last time I was totally complete. It had to be somewhere in the Autumn of last year. Everything was going so well for me and for all my friends. Then things slowly started falling apart for all of us. I know I shouldn't feel like I do about this, but I feel like I'm to blame for everyone's problems. If I'm sad, they're sad. If I'm happy, they appear happy. We end up having the same problems too. I appologize for that, too. ;)
Why can't everyone just be content for a span of more than a week at a time? I don't know. Maybe the answer is at the bottom of my can of Sprite Remix.

For now I think I'm just going to wait on Mallorie to sign on in hopes she can drive me to Logansport. If she can't tonight I'm going to try for tomorrow. I WILL be there. I'll find a way."

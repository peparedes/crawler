      Memories
Bus ride up and back!
Meeting Wycombe
Singing
Tubing- and dieing
Emily dieing
Playing the fruit basket game- getting stuck in the middle...Courtney falling into to poll, and doing a cheer to spell Wycombe but spelling it wrong...Richies river dance...Laura's duck...Mike's push ups...Krista's blue suede shoes
Lynda eating the banana when she wasn't supposed, then having to spit it out and keep passing it down the row
Me going up to Kirstin (who i didn't know)thinking it's Steph..covering her eyes and making her guess who it was...and realizing it wasn't who i thought it was

If anyone wants me to add anyone let me know!

"event","So back at puchase after a night away. I left with just about the clothes on my back and came back with a bike!!! A rice cooker! A giant fucking bottle of Vodka!! A fake plastic column to sit on and some other things I can't remember.

Went for a few bike rides on mah awesome bike in the fucking retard rain. Its a shower out there a cold fucking shower. Everyone I ran into was like ""wtf are you doing on a bike in the rain?"" why the fuck not? Its awesome puddles are ten times funner. My clothes would be soaked anyway and I would have been just as wet. But this was funner. Anywho, got back to my room took a hot ass shower which was AMAZING it was sooooooooooo fantabulous. Now I am naked it feels so good. I flashed everyone out my window but I doubt anyone saw. Alas. I am considering posing for the naked issue if my corset comes by then. But I want to hide my face. Perhaps have my hair covering my head, holding onto something bent over kinda while someone pulls the strings of the corset, I will chicken out don't worry.

I am considering drinking but my room mate chika ain't back yet and I don't know if her mum will come up. Come back Emily!!

Purchase owns mt life. Maybe I will make some rice? First show tonight!!

But these obessions that can't run their course until the story is done, its baggage to carry around, like serious mental baggage (though this all sounds silly). There is always that nagging thing while in the midst of a retarded obession. What would lupin think? Wonder what Mulder would say, Scully would hate that. Shigure would think that girl was hot too.<br /><br />WTF SAVE ME? Some one.&nbsp;<br /><br />p.s. if you haven't seen Fruits Basket, I actually highly reccomend it, seriously its great, it will steal you heart no matter how hidden you keep it, and make that heart grow three sizes to big. And then kind of drop the ball. But its worth the ride! Especially if you don't have my problem of being ridiculously obsessive and escapist about life.&nbsp;<br /><br />Believe it or not friends, the girl who can not stand for one minute any slow song by ANY band, she likes the opening slightly depressing slow theme song. What the fuck fuck.<br /><br />And I d/led a fan anime music video (yea its as dorky as it sounds, and I used to know a boy who made them). This video takes like five of the characters and perfectly matches a song to personality of the character. Hilarious. Made me giggle.

"event","<p>The other day at work some pricks were bossing me around and driving me crazy.<br />For example: I was told to do a task, I am doing it, quickly and such. Then another girl is told to do the same task, and its not made clear I am already doing the same thing. Its one thing to say ""hey, help her out"" its a completly different thing to make no knowlage of it to another person and put them both in very awkward places. So I abandon my post, let the other girl finish up. I clean up somewhere that looks like SHIT, only to be told ""oh don't worry about this section, go back to what you are doing"". So I do, when another ""senior"" empyoee spots this and says two people shouldn't be doing the same job and to ask someone what I should be doing. Frankly, there was nothing else to be doing because I had been trying to do my job all day, my job is to fix the unfolded shirts and every time I did this someone told me to stop and do something else. With nothing else to do I felt like shit. Then, a boy had been inventorying a section with a ladder, therefore I couldn't get over there to fix the shirts, it would crowd him and impeed his work. But juist as he fucking left another ""senior"" employee says ""well I don't want to be mean to you girls over here but this section (the one that had a ladder blocking it) well someone should have been on that already."" I fold that shit, now in the other boy's way of his job, and then someone else tells me to go to the mens section. The mens section has no AC, now I know, I smoke, but I still have asthma, and I do have asthma attacks when the humidity takes my breath away. So I am folding shirts twice the size of me in no AC as quickly as I can because the store is such that once you leave a shirt it is instantly unfolded by a tourist. My boss (this is jar jar binks) sees me because I look like I am about to cry and really I am, why? Because I didn't do shit for myself, I am a pussy chicken shit, I should have said something, I deep down knew it is the kind of work place where there is no triangle of power, only the boss and employees, no one above another. But I just took it up the ass. Long story short my boss coaxes it out of me, wanting to know why I was moved to a section I am never in, and why I look upset, I don't name names but I just say ""everyone who is working in acessories"" which is like naming names but less rattish (shush I like to tell myself this). Anywho, he tells me there is only two people who can tell me to do something and next time someone tells me to do something I have his permisson to tell them to ""fuck off"" his exact words in his african accent. This made me very happy.<br /><br />I simply can't waIt to tell someone to fuck off.<br /><br />By the way I am so much drunker than I wanted to be right now, my parents come home any minute and shit am I trashed. Yay family dinner drunk!</p>

Then, yesterday was spent by watching the world cup Germany v. Portugaul match. wtf Portugal man they sucked, they barely scrapped by, BUT! KAHN PLAYED!! He is the all time best goalie EVER and he looks like a big scary german guy! And is awesome because he just doesn't move if the knows the ball ain't comming close, unlike other goalies who dive bomb anyway.

Then Sara came over and we had some drinkies and watched some tv, watched House. He IS hot, you will learn.

Misa came then, good to see her. I think we watched more House, 40 year old virgin and Skeleton Key.

Today was WORLD CUP FINAL

ITALY WON MOTHER FUCKERS TAKE THAT FROGGY FROG HEADS!!! HA MOFOS YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED.

Ashamed by their team captain and best player who head butted an Italian player in the chest when the referee was calling a foul on the other side of the pitch. Whatever the Italian guy said must have been awful, but to head butt someone like that, knock them to the ground when he is the team captain, knows there are no subsitutes left and that they are most likey to go into penatly kick round (and he could easily be the best peanalty kicker on both teams) plus it was his last game before retierment and only the most pretigious position to be in as a soccer player, its really a disgrace. He go the red card and had to leave. Probably head butting his locker.

I went to Little Italy to celebrate. It was madness! People on the train singing, dancing, drinking out of what was obviously a paper bag concealed fourty. The train smelled like weed. I got out to find two vespas honking thier little horns and rowling up the passers by. Mulberry street was too crowded to even get to one side off. So so so many hot italians. Good god do I love them. Its my goal in life, to marry an italian man. Seriously I never want to be married, but there is an exception for citizenship to a country with health care, a stronger ""dollar"" AND the best food besides chinese food. I hung around little italy, chanting ITALIA! ITALIA! with everyone and singing Ole ole ole. Ya know. I don't know the italaian song sadly. But after a while it was boring to be by myself and I had called everyone who would have enjoyed it.

Over best weekend of the summer so far. 

p.s. if you watched the match, were you about to kill things because it was so tense too? I seriously almost died the whole time, I had to chew gum to keep from pacing my kitchen. If you didn't watch, France scored on a penatly kick within like the first ten mintues. Italy matched the goal by the ninteenth minute. Then there wasn't another goal for the rest of the game which went into over time and had to be settled by penatly kicks. France missed one and Italy got all four because France could catch up. 

p.p.s. The Italian goalie, Buffon, is a beautiful man. As is the whole team, mmmm."

"event","So, at work today I was waiting for my boss to notice me, (this is the boss that thinks my name is Jennifer, looks like Jar Jar Binks, and undresses girls with his eyes. As opposed to the other boss who is long tall skinny fucker who never raises his voice, which makes him really realy scary. One time the skinny one was ""yelling at someone"" by basically whispering at them ""why do you do this to me? why the fuck do you do this to me. you don't want to work. go home. clock out. no pay today"".) anyway, the goth kid that works with me is uber goth and my mother calls him the tranny. Anywho he was wearing a tank top today instead of his usual victorian woman's coat. Guess even goths get hot too. Anyway, I saw his arms and for reasons I can't comprehend the sight of his paper white skinny arms was hot. Freaked me out."

"event","<p>Today I finished work and my parents and I headed over to our favorite italian food resturant., Umbertos. Its in little Italy, right on the end. We walk in and its packed even though its only five. Then we see the TVs, its world cup soccer time. Italy v. Germany. Twenty minutes into overtime, no one has scored yet. Every little move near the foals ellicits either cheers or shouts of no! That is until the italians score! And everyone is going nuts, but its not over yet. And then only bout two minutes later, another goal! And I turn around to look down mulberry street and every guiedo with a flag is out there dancing and cheering, cars honk as they drive&nbsp;by. Everyone in the restuant can not even believe what just happened and the waiters are standing together ""so you thinka italy wins all the way"" ""of course!"" ""I dunno, maybe France"" which makes all the other waiters boo him and go back to work.<br /><br />The perfect fourth of july, because america wasn't involved.<br /><br />I bought a soccer shirt on the way home and wore it. </p>"

"event","Last night at about two in the morning I decided drinking a glass full of vodka to ""calm"" down and sleep was a good idea. I woke up in a different outfit than the on I had put on, and the bed was soaking wet as I had drunkenly sleep walked to get water and spilled it every where. Fantastic. At least this is what I assume happened. There was a glass I hadn't remembered bringing in.&nbsp;

Also, still very very drunk when I got to work. Quite the adventure.

And to make the day better as I am leaving the boss man informs me I am working tomorrow. Even though I had made plans with my family. Guess not.&nbsp;"

"event","<p>Ameican Psycho really is one of the best movies ever made. Killing hookers with chainsaws, voice over monolouges ranting about body care and diet. AND NO ONE PAYING A GODDAMN SECOND OF ATTENTION TO A MURDERER.<br /><br />Really overall amazing. Rent it. Now.<br /><br />Did I mention Christian Bale has one hot bod? And you get to see his nice chest. Mmm.</p>
<p>p.s. On a mostly unrelated note, someday I wish to be so badass I could light my cigarette off a person's freshly burned flesh.<br /><br />p.p.s. Taking a nap for three hours and waking up at nine does nothing to help ones screwed up sleep schedule.</p>"

"event","So, I always thought Sherlock Holmes was a boring old man.

But it is not so! I found a book on my shelf, and Watson was describing the fellow he lived with as a man who liked to shoot holes in the walls, drink a lot, smoke a lot and generally refused to clean his room.

MY NEW HERO.

Also, he is intenesly smart in the most obnoxiously hot way. I swoon for deductive reasoning!!

What a dork. Kill me."

"event","It may sound wrong, but I think Chuck Palahnuik might have been on to something when he said this generation (he was probably talking more about the one before us, but I think it applies to us too) that guys were basically raised by women and thats the problem. This mini rant comes from dealing with too many insecure boys. Its not attractive. Honestly. Man up. Punch someone. Grow some balls."

"event","I am cleaning my room. Not because I am sick of the mess. Anyone who saw my door room the last month of school knows I could live in knee deep clothing. But, because simply, my brother's wife bought a puppy (mostly to replace him while he was living in his office). And this puppy needs a baby sitter. And, if I clean my room, I get to have the puppy in it. Holy fuck thats good incentive.

The puppy is a brussel griffon, which is to say the least, a very weird looking dog. Its like the dog in As Good As It Gets, but it is weird looking, with big eyes, one of which is wall eyed. Small, brown, very cute. YAY PUPPY TIME!"

"event","Results of the back doctor: I learned today that the back surgeon specialist dood&nbsp;I see, also dabbles in acupuncture. I personally avoid homeopathic and off the chart medicines, but if this guy who went through more schooling than years I have been alive thinks there is merit I'll give it a go. Today I had a pin in the back of my neck for about twenty minutes. It hurt a bit, but oddly enough, all fucking day that spot hasn't hurt. I have to go back every week for the stuff. Also, I was put on some anti-seiziure medication, the new pancea. Perhaps it will doubley work to level moods as well as eliminate pain. I am doubtful. But maybe just maybe. Funny, I could have been put on this stuff by a therapist and my parents would be outraged, but by a back docotor, sure why not.&nbsp;

By the by, I am in a wonderful mood though its hard to tell.

Got my bangs trimmed very short by a very pretty asian lady today, she had black and blue hair and was skinnier than I ever was when I was a lass.&nbsp;

Maybe, I could switch to the new meds and go off the pill,, if&nbsp;it does the same mood&nbsp;effects,&nbsp;and I could loose the stupid weight it made me gain. (yes it was only like ten/fifteen pounds, and its a vanity issue, but I am allowed to be vain.)

And in other news, my hair looks like a wig, it is a bit of a magenta but more pink color. Actually its really just a bright deep pink. I wanted red, but pink is still awesome.&nbsp;

Might have work tomorrow, don't know, my mother likes to tell my bosses things without telling me and forgets to tell me things until she has had half a bottle of wine. So, we'll see."

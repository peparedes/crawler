"event","I decided last night, or this morning really, at 2:30am when I got home that I should really start some devotionals and as I was looking through the collection on my bookshelf I came accross this book that my pastor bought for me when I graduated from high school, Start Where You Are.&nbsp; Now, of course I never even cracked the thing then, but now I couldnt imagine any title more befitting to the state of my life.&nbsp; I really do have to just start where I am.&nbsp; So I took a few minutes before falling asleep and I started the book and I think it is really going to be good.&nbsp; There are a couple of things that I had not yet considered that the book is bringing to light.&nbsp; Like there are times in life when we just need a rest.&nbsp; It is not a punishment, nor does it mean that I have some great character flaw for which I&nbsp;need time to correct, but that often those rests are a necesary preperation for things that are about to come in our lives.&nbsp; They also serve as a time of&nbsp;healing, which is&nbsp;hardly ever instantaneous, but almost always a process.&nbsp; And the&nbsp;greatest revelation of all is that during this time of rest it is not sufficient to do nothing, or simply rest because the only way for one area&nbsp;of the&nbsp;human brain to rest is by activating another area.&nbsp; I will not be able to simply <EM>get</EM> past this, but I must move past it by activating&nbsp;other new and exciting areas of my life.&nbsp; I will do my scrapbook from France and I will write&nbsp;my friends in Tours and most importantly I will have my quiet and devotional time with&nbsp;GOD.&nbsp; Maybe then He can prepare me for whatever it is that He has in stor for me...be it PhD, husband, job, and any&nbsp;other glorious blessings&nbsp;He chooses to send my way!&nbsp;"

"event","Alright, I got it, this time in my life is a complete and total time of transition. Not that I havent been here before, and triumphed, but Lord help me to see where to go from here.&nbsp; I am not discouraged, well not totally, and I know I am being watched over and provided for with as much love, kindess, and patience that is possible for a Father to bestowe upon His child, I just feel like I am in a state of aimless wandering...very slow, almost as if I was walking through a translucnet fog with just enough light to miss all the things to trip me and knock me down, but not enough to see the way through and find my way out.&nbsp; Doors keep closing, or better yet a steel door slams down in front of it before I can even try to open it, and I just want to find the right door, the one that is mine and has been destined for me that on man can take away.&nbsp; And at the same time&nbsp; I dont want to become sidetracked and get lost in my own wants and desires which could displace me or take me away from what God has me.&nbsp; I know that all things work to the greater good of those that love Him and there is no mistake I could make so great that God could not turn it around, I just dont want to wander in the desert of my own confussion and despair.&nbsp; Lord just help me to find my way.&nbsp; And all the while...my thesis awaits me..."

"event","<P>Tonight is the first night of my journal.&nbsp; This lovely creation was shown to me by my friend Cynthia and I am very interested to see how this is going to work out.&nbsp; I should be working on my thesis right now but I have managed to procrastinate for the past 2 and 1/2 hours.&nbsp; I am in the process of reading an article right now that is just so complicated and convoluted it is just impossible to read!&nbsp; But it is vital to my thesis and I know if I can get through it I will have a direct link to my hypothesis...but Lord help me get through it...I have got to get it moving with this thesis, which Iman very politely reminded me is just a big paper.&nbsp; Oh la la, mais toujours c'est la vie.&nbsp; Et en plus a la fac j'ai trop de peine avec le registrar au cause de mes notes et c'est une horeur!!!!!!! J'ai parle a Kim a toute a l'heur et elle fait des examens demain, trois en fait, mais ca va aller.&nbsp; Moi, je n'ai que deux la semaine prochaine, et c'est bien.&nbsp; Mais vraiment, la fac, j'en ai assez!&nbsp; C'est la fin et il faut finer!!!</P>

"event","I had finals for the past week and been moving so I haven't really had time to write much. Sorry. Here's the update, more then likely not in order:

I got an hour massage. The best thing in the world. If you ever have the chance do get one. I highly enjoyed it, but the guy working on it had mentioned that there was something wrong with a spot that had been hurting me for a while. The pain that I got out of the Army on and they are still confused about. He wants to look into it farther. He told me to be prepared for bad news. I don't like that. Oh well, guess I'll have to go back in and get it checked out. Just not till I get back to school. hehe!

A friend and I were going to go out to a movie. Instead one of my guy friends called and invited me to his house party. I went to the party was hanging out and got drunk, something that I don't do often at all. If you know me you know that I don't really drink and you know why. I got drunk, which has only happened about 4 times. Well for the first time from drinking, I got sick. I learned to never mix Caramel Whiskey with beer on an upset stomach. Bad idea! Anyways, had a blast.

During finals week I had a BBQ on College Ave (that one park after the RR tracks). This time we had everything under control. Food was great. We had BBQ chicken, baked potatoes, chips, cookies, cheesecake and I think a few other things. I was on the grill yet again. Loved it! Played soccer and had fun on the playground. A bunch of kids we were!!

Finals went good. Did great on the math and english. Still don't know about the other one. Not too worried though. Spent a lot of time studying and doing other peoples homework. It paid off though. I did better then I wanted to do of my first semester. Next year is going to be a walk in the park!!

Moved out of the dorm. I helped about 5-6 people out, to include myself. I was crazy. When everyone was leaving I really started to miss people. I was one of the very last people there. When everyone was gone that I would hang out with, I cried. I know that I will see them next year, but we're not all going to be with in fifty feet of each other. Oh the pain and sorrows. 

I'm at my brother's now. I hate not having anything to do. I'll be going to Seattle to visit on the 21st. Haven't decided on how long I'm going to be there. I miss it, but I know that things have changed so I'm not expecting much. Well it's getting late and I should get to bed even though I know that I won't. Hmmm... oh well. Talks with you alls later!!"

"event","What an adventure today, and it's only begun - I went to my English class as usual. Sitting in class minding my own business I decide to look at one of these fliers that are always around. Not the greatest thing to pass around in a school (personal opinion). It was basically saying ""hey here's another strip club"". Being disgusted with it I tossed it. It fell on the floor. Big deal right? Guess I was wrong. One of the older gentlemen sitting next to me starts getting mad and saying that it's his and that I needed to pick it up. I said I would in a few, I was typing something up. No harm right? Wrong. He starts yelling a me and calling me a bitch and an ass hole in class. Starts yelling at the instructor to do something about it and stands up and starts ranting and raving yelling more names at me and saying how I'm rude. During this time I'm continuing typing so when I'm done I can pick it up. Well the instructor comes over and picks it up. The guy yelling throws it at my face. Dudes, what the hell? What kind of people need to do things like that.  I'm not the type to start things up and I didn't realize it would have evolved to this. I think that his yelling had no effect on me made him more pissed. Sorry, but I'm not going to lower myself to that level just to have someone get more of an arise out of it. I will admit that if he would have physically hit me I would have thrown a punch back, self defense."

"event","So I was sitting here at my computer doing homework, as usual, when my roommate gets home. She's grabbing a bunch of stuff with a friend that she had brought over. One of the other girls from down the hall came in and they're like, ""wanna go to a BBQ?"" I'm thinking, sure why not. So I go and have a total blast, although no one knew how to get the BBQ going, till I step in. Hehe!! I had to run to the store to get some REAL charcoal and somethin to drink. When I get back I got the BBQ going and ended up being designated BBQ-er. Had a blast. We kicked around the soccer ball, I learned a dance that my roommate does in jazz class, that was interesting in itself. Plus, we were doing cartwheels and flips of all sorts, felt like a kid again. Oh yeah, a couple of us ran through the sprinklers. I LOVED IT!! It was the first night in so long that I just got to kick back and relax. I did have last night to myself but all I really did was sleep. So tonight I went had fun, met some new peeps and left homework alone. Normally I wouldn't do that but everything that I have to do isn't due for another week or two. I've just wanted to keep ahead so I wouldn't have to worry about it last minute like I usually do. The only sad part is now my night has to end. Oh well, parting is such sweet sorrows. Good night all, and sweet dreams."

"event","Today started out pretty good: preregistered for my classes next semester, (I think) I did well on my math test, found out that I have a nephew on the way, and got my Arizona license. I was doing GREAT!! Oh yeah!! When I woke up from my nap (college = nap-times again), my mom IMed me saying to call her. First thing out of her mouth was, ""I owe you a car."" I'm like alright? I should mention that I have my mom's car and she has mine. There was no way that my car was going to make the trip down here. Anyways, I found out that she was driving on a new road that opened back home, shortly before I came here. She swerved slightly over the shoulder line and went off a cliff (2 feet) and rolled three times, landing on the roof. The people there had to cut the seatbelt and bust a window just to get her out. The car, now totaled. Aight, whatever. And GREAT news, mom only came out with some bumps and bruises, she's ok, scared, but ok."

"event","I think I've come to learn how to live without sleep. I've been forgetting to sleep and to eat. That can't be good. I've just been so busy. When I do go to lay down to sleep, it takes me forever to fall asleep. To me this seems VERY abnormal. I guess that I can't really do much about it. If I can I'll be sleeping hopefully within the next few hours."

"event","All spring break I've been doing math. I did take a road trip for a couple of days to San Diego. Other then that I've done nothing but homework, mostly math. I will tell you now: NEVER put math off. It's too much of a pain in the butt. And now I'm off to do more. Grrr... I don't like math anymore."

"event","For those of you who have piercings: DO NOT lay on the ground with a toddler around. They will one way or another pull or land on any piercing that you may have. I found this out the hard way. 

AHHH.... My tummy hurts. IHop = BAD!!! 

GREAT NEWS: The dorms are SOO quiet. It's amazing and quite awesome, if I say so myself. AND I have no distractions. I actually get to do homework. YAY!!

I'm going to TRY to sleep now."

"event","I woke up and was in a GREAT mood this morning. The sun was shining so I opened up the curtains. Normally I wouldn't be able to cause my roommate would be sleeping, but she went to work. That just made my day. Until I went to take my test for APH. I really think that I bombed it. Not good. The thing is is that I studied for it like mad and I still feel like I didn't do that great. I guess I won't know until I get it back, after Spring Break. Oh well.<BR>Another bad thing. I might not make it to school tomorrow. As crazy as this sounds: I don't wanna miss school. It's so much harder to make things up then actually doing them with the class. I really hope that I will be able to make it. I'm just in so much pain and I need to look into getting the surgery that I need. But frankly a surgery is scary and I don't want it. I may have no choice though. GRRRR.....<BR>But to end on a good note. My mom is so happy right now and that makes me happy. She's had a hard time and she's always been depressed. So her finally being happy is just so wonderful!! <BR>I have homework to do that I've been procrastinating on so I think that I should do that now. Have a wonderful day!!"

"event","WooHoo! Trying to figure this whole thing out. Pretty cool. I've been doing homework all weekend (for the most part) and I'm ready to sleep. Right now all I can think about is Spring Break. Yet, unlike most going everywhere but here, I'm staying. Unfortunately, I have some projects to do. So my free week is all school anyways, just by my time. I do need to get off to bed. Another week of school. Plus, my bed is screaming my name. Nights and sweet dreams!

Oh yeah.. Check out my music on iTunes. You can download it at http://www.apple.com/itunes/ and you don't need to have an apple."

"event","so, today was a good day. school was good, i did all my homewrok last night, and handed everything in today. my english draft went along famously. yesterday i went driving some, and it was good. and then today i woke up early and my mother was irritated and i was last to school, but it was ok. today mrs.chase announced to the class that she's leaving because she has to go to the phillipines to adopt some kids. while i don't like her teaching ability/habits, i think it's really admirable for her to adopt kids. and then i had classes and lunch and topics and megan wasn't there so it was shitty, but we did have a sub so i went to the library and talked to ashley for a few minutes. then i came home. i have to go to the doctor today, and i am not going to junior piece for dance. and then i'm going to come home and probably do chemistry, and look over my spanish stuff, and then go t driver's ed, and then come home and probably go online, and then talk to al and then go to bed. yeah. GOOD plan, if you ask me. and then tomorrow i have double study, so i'll do homework during that time. 
but right now, i'm a little irritated. my fucking step father just makes me angry. he barely talks to me, but just his presence irritates me. and then he sits down and eats a whole fucking package of girl scout cookies and a big ass glass of milk and he shouldn't because he's fat. i really hate him. i wish i didn't, but it's just an emotion that i can't seem to control. ohh well
in other news...i go to london in 33 days, so says aine. i'm such a loser. everyone else is like, counting down until we can go, and i like, forget the date of the trip every other day. lol. ohh well. i am very excited to go. i want to do and see everything. i want to go to the wax museaum! lol...that should be interesting. and ride the london eye...and go to the MAD HATTERS.......which is this hat shop in london where they make hats for the royalty. i want to go SO bad. anyways.......i guess that's all for now. i'm going to go look for a snack of some sort. i want fruit.....but we'll see. ttyl

there's italian dippers for lunch. i'm rather excited.
i want to go to the mall tonight, and so does megan, and hopefully ashley will want to go as well, and we can find rides and have a jolly old time. 
then tomorrow i have dance all day, and then i'm going to megans for movie night. i am very excited. we're watching detroit rock city and van wilder. and all the boys are coming. it's going to be a good time.

"event","what a shitty day. i cried a lot. i hate sharing MY family members. it makes me sad. and then people have to bring things up and it makes me feel bad. but guess what people...i live with 3  people who seem to be trying to steal my mother away from me. i love my mother more than anything in the entire world. she is everything i have. i don't have a dad, i have one really great mom. she is one of my best friends. i would never intentially hurt her, and it sucks because i know she has a hard time trying to balance time for me and time with her husband and his kids. it just sucks because she is the only adult in the house, because he acts like an impatient jerk half the time. he doesn't take care of himself, and my mother is always cleaning up after him. and then there's the 5 and 8 year olds, and i realize that they can't really do anything for themselves, but it's like, when all MY family talks about is ""oh, the poor girls"" this and ""oh, the poor girls"" that, it's like, GIVE ME A FUCKING BREAK. guess what, i am 16. my life is a mess. i live with 3 people that i don't want to and i can't change it. it makes me feel outnumbered because there are 3 of them and one of me, and it's like, she is MY mother first, and then she can be yours. i mean, i know she drives me around everywhere and that she does a lot for me, but i guess i have jealousy watching her care for my step sisters and their father. 
so my aunt made me cry today because she told me i was a brat for not wanting my sisters to come to my dance show, but i tried to tell her how i share everyone in my life with them, at least all the extremely important family members, and dance is my thing, and i don't want to share that with them. but i don't even care about that anymore. if my mom wants to bring them, she can. it's not worth fighting about. so i was explaining this to my aunt, how i share everyone in my family with them, and it made my cry, so then she started about how i am just upset because i have to share my mother. and it's true. i don't want to lose my mother. so then i was all upset so i left to walk to work, and i called my mom and cried some more, and i was absolutely exhausted today because i was up late last night, so she made me walk back to my aunt and made my aunt take me home. and then i started to feel bad because my aunt felt bad that she made me upsett, and then her and my mom were both worried about me because i'm so stressed out right now. 
and i just checked my other email and my dad emailed me. and he said i haven't emailed him in a long time, and did he scare me off, and that he loves me, but how can he? he doesn't even know me. 
so anyways, my aunt brought me home and i sat and cried, and then i called my mom and cried to her, and then al called and i cried to him. and then we got off the phone and i went to sleep. 
i mnea, i suppose it is selfish of me to not want my sisters to come to my dance show, but i don't know. i just, i don't know. i guess that's all for now"

"event","so, once again, i'm in keyboarding. school is terrible. at leasat we got a break from mrs. cramer's voice first block while we took a test. i think i did fairly well. i'm trying to bring my spanish grade up to an a. i think i can do it. it's just i'm not so good with grammar. but oh well. right now i have a 81 in that class. and i guess if we do all of our homework we get 3 extra points. so i think that i might get some extra points. hopefully. anyways...after this class i have double study hall. i need to do my english, history, spanish, and maybe some more english. 

today after school i have to go and work, and then go back to school to do the junior piece. then i think me and al are going to go to big y and i think i'm going to get a grinder. turkey, for sure. i want to lose 25 lbs within the next month, at least 10 for the dance show, and then another 15 for london. i don;t know why. i just think that i'll feel and look better if i start eating right. and exercising. which i don't generally like to do, but hey, there's nothing wrong with it.

so, we now have london meeting once a week every week now until we go. i need to go and have my papers notarized so i can go. i think i have to bring it to town hall so my aunt can do it. i'm very excited. i want an FCUK shirt, and i think i'm going to get ashley and megan one's too. we'll see. it's going to be so much fun. anyways, i have to go and finish my keyboarding stuff. and then when knows what else i'll do online. ttyl

in other news...i have a sore throat. it sucks. i hope i don't get the stomach bug that's going around. 

ok, i am oficially taking the SAT on may 1. yes. ok. i guess i need to start memorizing vocab, staying after for extra help with grammar, reading for vocab, and doing some math SAT packets. the right way. and think through everything.

RIIIIIIIIIIGHT. this class sucks. spanish this morning was terrible. we did a listening test. lets see. about 45 minutes of mrs. cramer DRONING on and ON in that voice of hers. why can't we ever have a substitute? 

so, the rest of my day will go like this. i have study after this, where i have to do my english journals and huck finn questions, and then i have lunch, and then some more study hall to finish the rest of my homework. and i have to do my history homework sometime in there too. probably right before i do my english journals because it should only take about 15 minutes to do. and then yeah. i have to work from 4:30 until about 5:30 i think. then i have to go home, finish any other homework i have, and then read all the rest of huck finn that i have to read for tomorrow. i also have to prepare for a timed writing in english. i'm trying to break my 87 on the last one and get into the 90's. that would make me happy. mr. mckenna said yesterday when i stayed after that my grades are going up. that makes me happy. 

this weekend i'm not doing much. i'm going to al's tomorrow night for dinner and probably some movies, and then on saturday i have to dance and then work and then i want to go home and then i have to make more notecards and make a better outline for english and start drafting my paper. and i'll probably have some more huck finn to read as well. but i can do it all. i'm not making any plans for saturday night or sunday. so, yeah. i have to do my paper for english. because...if i hand in my first draft on next friday, it's going to be early, and i get 10 extra points. so yeah.

well, this is getting boring so i'm going to go and read some huck finn and think about the poem i have to write during study for one of my english journals. let me tell you. i am NOT too fond of poetry. i can't write it well so i don't enjoy it. but ohh well. the last time i tried to write it was like, ten million years ago. i think i have a good start. but anyways.....yeah. i'm really thirsty. so, i'm going to get a drink. tonight will be fun. i probably won't be online because i want to get my reading done. talk to you later.

"event","i hate this. and by this, i mean college searching. see, my ideal dream is to go to a college out of state, probably mass. or RI, and be happy and have good friends and go to shows and generally have a good time. and i know that we don;t have a lot of money to spend, so i am trying to find out of state colleges for a low price. and whenever i bring one up to my mom, she still says it's too expensive because all when i was little she spent money sending me to daycares a shit so i didn't have to stay with my grandparents all the time and she never saved any money for me to go to college. and now she says she can barely pay the bills. i guess i;m going to have to start giving up a lot of things just so she can help me pay for college. now i feel bad for always wanting to go to camp when i was younger, and all the dance classes and my 80 dollar tap shoes and then jazz shoes and always wanting to go out to eat. BUT it's ok for her to go and randomly spend hundreds of dollars on new bedroom furnature? what's all that about? ohh well. i hate this so much. i can't take living here. thats why i always feel like i'm going to have a breakdown. and i can't live at home much longer. i really cant stand living with my stepfather and his 2 kids. as far as i;m concerned, him and my mom and his kids can start a family and do whatever the hell they want. and i just want to go to college. looks like i'll just have to get a job and get an apartment and start writing a book so i can hopefully send it to a publisher. and i guess i should start writing feverishly now. it's so rough.  but hopefully i can take my life and turn it to a great fiction story. thats what i'll do. i just want to go away to college and be on my own and go out and do things that most of the other kids in my town do after they graduate high school. and i know that i'm only a junior, but junior year is almost over and i need to start thinking about where i want to go in life. it's just hard. i don't know. and now i feel bad for going to london with school. thats like, probably a couple thousand dollars that could have sent me to college, and fuck. i messed up. ohh well. i'm going to go think and stuff. if anyone has any advice for me to, please help  me. ohh yeah......and there are a couple of instate schools like the universities of hartford and new haven or sacred heart that i wouldnlt mind going to. but she says the two universities are not in good parts of town and sacred heart is too expensive. this sucks. and she said she doesn't want me going to central or eastern or anything, and UCONN is too much. i don;t really want to go to uconn anyways. not many people get in anymore. and i really do want to go out of state. and RI isnt't that bad. she just needs to compromise with me as well as i need to compromise with her. the thing is that she can't take the mistakes she made when she was in high school and try to fix them through me. like, getting pregnant at 17. i'm not going to do that. i want to establish myself and have an icome and a real family like, married, before i have kids. but she won't take the time to hear me out. i'm sorry mom. but i need to move on and get away from here. too much shit has happened to me here, and i can;t deal with it living in the past forever. i need to start new and move on. just not in waterford or new london county. bye everyone

WOO miss woomer is coming over tomorrow night for a damn good time. good times. 

today who knows what i'm going to do. i think i'll watch animal house, then go downstairs and listen to music and read. i have a few more chapters to get through in huck finn for school. and then maybe i'll read one of my other books. and i have a magazine i want to read. maybe i'll read a little bit of everything. that would make me happy. well, i guess that;s all for now. ttyl

i don;t really want to go back to school tomarrow. but i have double study, so it won;t be that bad. and NO HOMEWORK tonight. i think i better drop off my english journals tomorrow just in case. because i dunno. i have a feeling that if i wait and bring them to class on tuesday, he's going to say ""well, you really should have dropped them off yesterday since they were due friday but we didn;t have school"" and i dunno. i can never win in that class. he told me that i was a good student and a good writer, just lazy. and it's true. i don';t apply myself. i could have straight a's if i could. but its such a hassle. anyways....i guess thats all for now. maybe tomorrow during study i'll update again. ttyl

"event","i say today was beautiful because as me and al were on the phone, he made a comment about how great the sky was.....and i looked outside and the sky was all gray and there was a light rain. perfection. well, that's like, indoor-looking-outside perfection. and then i had to go. tap was fun. it's easy to see that i'm the best in the class, and i'm not just saying that. OK say MAYBE the class has 2 other people aside from me, and they're on the older side...but that is NOT the point. 

School was fine today. spanish was treacherous as always. her voice just DRONES on and on...it's terrible. actually, it's unbearable until about 9:00...from nine on it's ok because its like, ok, now we only have an hour left. and then i had keyboarding. it was alright. so, i usually type all  normal with all 10 fingers in keyboarding, and then any other time i use the computer, i go back to pecking. but i guess i'll try and use all the right fingers all the time from now on. it's terrible, but i want to be able to pass the speed tests and all that. not that i want a job that includes a lot of typing...actually, i lie horribly. i think i want to go into journalism. this is a recent thing of mine. i might switch back to psychology. no clue. i'm at a point in my life were i'm thinking about what i want to do, but nothing sounds perfect. i need to be open to more options. and then after keyboarding, i had first lunch, study, second lunch, and then another block of study hall. i did almost all my homework, with the exception of my english journals. thats no big deal though. they're easy this time. i have to write about what i would improve about my writing, and then react to a current events article, and then do a quote anaylsis for one of the essay's we had to read for homework. and then i had dance at school. i need to start working out if i want to look damn good in the costumes she gave us today. LET ME TELL YOU i am NOT feeling the costumes for the janet jackson song. i have to start working out for prom too. i have all these random workouts from my magazines. i need to find a prom dress. i think i might ask ashley and megan to go with me to look for one. i need their help dressing me, lol. i don't even want to wear what i have planned to wear to winter ball, but their doesn't seem to be any other options. i guess it'll be fine. i do want new shoes. but first i need a new stereo system for my room...and then i have to go to london...and then come home and buy my new sneakers. then   i quit my job, and then it's off to camp for a fun filled two months of living with some of the best people on earth. and i get paid for it. it's gonna be great...getting paid to do what you really love. but downside? al won't be there. speaking of al...

tomarrow i get to see him at drivers ed...a fun filled 2 hours together in a very small room. fun for everyone. and then we don't see eachother on thursday, and then friday i'm off to his house for the evening....and then saturday night is winter ball. he will dance. he will be LORD of the dance. lol...maybe not quite..but it'll be great. we'll be together, that's all that matters....anyways...

tomarrow i have history, english, chem, and (al's favorite class) topics! it's going to be barrels of fun. OK so on the topic of history..last class we had an open book, open note test. and people were complaining that it was hard. i was like...are you kidding me? ohh well. not everyone's brain's work the same way i guess. anyways....i guess that's all for now. megan gave me my GOREgeous shirt....only to find ut that spirit week has been cancelled. ohh well. better luck next time... ttyl

"event","so, it's saturday night, and i'm home alone. nothing to do. i busted out the bop it extreme, but it's not so fun with no one to pass it around with. i suppose i could clean my room or something. i folded some clothes which was odd because i just wasn;t going to do it and tell my mom that i forgot, but then i was like, eh, whatever, and did it. tonight i hope i can sleep, but my mind will be running wild. i think the only time that i haven't been thinking about al today was during dance, because i'm still trying to learn the techno piece. i have most of it down now, but i was sick one day and they changed up a couple sections and i don;t quite have them down yet. and i was quite pleased because during the modern piece, i get right up to front stage which i like. lol...i am an attention seeker. no. i just love dancing modern. it's much more my style. i feel stupid doing the finale. it's fun, but for like, a dance class, not to go on stage. and we're wearing these little dresses and big white boots....it's crazy. and i'm up on the risers. i'm afraid i'm going to like, fall off or something. like i said, modern is much more my speed. i might take ballet class next year. i'm all about it. and tap still. i'll have to see where i can get a job and what kind of schedule i'll have. i think i might try and go over to carelot's daycare center and see if i can work there after school or something. see, a daycare center would be great because i love kids, and i can work after school and not have to worry about nights a weekends. that'll be nice. 

i got my passport today. it didn;t even take 4 weeks like they said it would. the pic i looked stoned in at first, but now that it's on the passport, it looks fine. they must have done something to it. 

so, last night was wonderful. after work i went to megans house and she made my goregeous shirt and ashleys hotkins shirt and her taysty shirt, they look damn good. so, for class pride day, i have a nice shirt. and then we went to the mall and anthony was there, and then al and justin came. i was so happy to see al. then i met his mom, and she was so sweet. and then his aunt came out of the mall and she was really nice too. then we went to dinner, which was good. filling, but good. then justin, ashley, megan, and anthony left to go shop and me and al were talking to one of his friends, and then we just walked around, went to FYE and then to suncoast to look at music and movies, and then we shopped around a little, i was seeing if i saw anything to wear to winter ball, i thought maybe a bright silky tanktop to wear under my floaty black shirt, but the one i liked was like, 40 dollars...and i'm not spending that much on a tanktop that i can only wear like, a couple times a year. and then we looked at shoes, and i'm either buying the green and blue kangaROOS or the pink and blue ones. and then after i go to london i need to buy a new stereo because mine is all fucked up. and then yeah, i'll buy more cds to put in the stereo. 

so, at work they're looking for people to replace me and wendy. i guess she wants another adult to replace wendy, and another teen to replace me. i'm quitting a week before finals. and then camp counseling, and then coming home. 

so, yeah. in conclusion, i'm home all alone on a saturday night, have a nice conversaiton with a friend, but i miss al. him and his dad are in maine snowmobiling. but he's coming back on monday, so thats good. i don't know how i'm going to survive 9 days in london. i guess i'll have to get a calling card because my cellular won;t work over there. 

ok, i think i'm going to go and sleep now....if i can. maybe i'll clean my room and make the bed first. goodnight everyone, sweet dreams.

"event","what a great day. it started off good...77 on my spanish midterm! i was lie, f-yeah....then i talked to megan and that was a plus, then it was off to keyboarding..i got a 97 on that midterm...and then i had study...me and megan went to first lunch, and then to the library where we did our spanish, and then back to the caf where i ate with ashley, sam, and megan. it was nice to sit with people at lunch that talk to you. then i had another study hall...it was boring. 

but then i went home, went online for awhile, had some cereal...then al called! it was one of the better phone conversations i've had. AND he's coming to winter ball. AND he's going to dance with me in the dance show. i'm very excited. 

we went to ruby tuesdays for dinner. i had a small salad from the salad bar, and that was quite filling...then i had penne and shrimp alfredo....it was quite good. then we went and looked at curtains...then charles and david called, that was always fun. 

tomarrow is going to be an exciting day. i have 4 classes. but everyone is saying how there's not going to be school wednesday. in which case....me and al might hang out. good times. but i'm going to be in school forever! if we keep having snow days....ohh well. i don't want to be waiting for the bus in the freezing cold. 

i guess that's all for now. driver's ed next week...hopefully al will join me. again, more good times. ttyl

i'm kind of hungry, but not really. i might go make a salad soon. that would be good. 

ok, i guess that's all for now. maybe i'll go take a nap or something. i have to make my bed seeing as we mangles it last night with all of us trying to get covers. ohh well, it was fun. ttyl

i go to london in like, 3 months. i am UBER excited. it's like, insane. i can't wait. none of my close friends are going, but maybe i will make some new friends. and my friend from work is going, which is nice. yeah, it's a school trip. but who cares? it's going to be fun all the same.

well, i'm off for some MTV, maybe some reading, and then to bed. ttyl

"event","lets have a round of applause...for....EXAMS ARE OVER!!!!!! it was a hellish four days, but i think i did fine on everything. i prepared myself, and all was good. today i only had civics...it was fine. he's just a LITTLE too ambitious...because he gives us like, 30 pages of articles to read, and goes ""ok..read and respond to everything"" and it's like uhh....we only have 2 hours. NEVER GOOD. but i finished everything. and he have me and A in that class, so all is good. 
monday i have my first day of DOUBLE STUDY...excellent. 3 and 1/2 hours of sitting and doing nothing. i can;t wait. maybe i'll get some hard-core reading and writing done. i wish i could just go home. that would make me REALLY happy. but it wouldn't be too efficient because i have no way to get home. so, yeah. 
anyways...today was one of my friends last days at school, seeing as he's moving back home. that makes me on the sad side, because i'm going to miss him. ohh well, maybe if he comes to visit we can hang out.
haha...i told my mom how i was telling megan how one of her friends from work's son is cute, and she goes to her friend at work (we were on the phone) ""Hey Barb! elizabeth thinks frankie is cute!"" and i was like..MOM...lol....but he IS cute....maybe we can go out to dinner sometime or something. haha...probably not. anyways...
there's a really crappy song on the radio. it sounds like puddle of mudd. all of their songs sound the same. either that, or it is another band that stole their style. yeah...bad people. anyways...i guess thats all for now. i think i'm going to go and nap. ttyl

"event","i have a lot of dreams. and some ambition. if things go the way i want them to, i'm going to marry a rock star, have a huge house, some kids, and a best selling book (or 10). that would make me oh, so happy. i want to write books. i think i want to major in journalism. that would make me happy. but, seeing as i change my mind every other day about what i want to do, don't look for my column anytime soon. so anyways...

i told my boss that at the end of this schoolyear, after i come home from counseling the kids at camp, i will NOT be returning to work. i think i'm officially resigning a week before finals. this will make me happy. then i go to camp for the summer, make my $850 for watching the kids and like, sleeping there, and then i'm going to have to come home and find another job. i'm thinking cashiering somewhere. like, maybe target or marshalls or something. probably not target. maybe somewhere in the new shopping center across from the mall. probably not borders, because as much as i like reading, i don't want to be around books anymore. i don't want to work someplace in the mall, because i don't know. it just doesn't strike my fancy. i would want to work at like, american eagle or pacsun, and you have to be 18 to work at AE, and pacsun won't want me. i don't know. i don't want to work. but i have to, or else i can't go to college. yeah...moving on...

i was just discussing with one of my friends how i am lonely. i mean, i have my few (but close) friends, and i have my school friends, and i have my friends from camp that i talk to online, but it's not the same as a boyfriend. it just isn't. and i mean, i don't see why i'm not in a relationship. it's not like i'm ugly, and i'm a good listener, and i am smart, and i'm interesting in a lot of things, so it's like, why aren't i getting the guys? one of the worlds unsolved mysteries i guess...

well, i guess that's all for now. i'm going to listen to some punk goes acoustic and dream of guitar players. ttyl

"event","so, today my mother's husband came home, and i finally identified the feeling i feel towards him. it's called hate. whenever he is around i just get so angry. i don;t understand. like, i used to be fine with him. now i guess it's that the thought of him taking my mother away from me....and him always referring to his kids when telling them to go ask my mother something, he tells them to ""go ask momma"" i'm like..guess what asshole...she ain;t their momma. it's like...i don;t want to share her. she's mine. the way my mother puts it, we all want to be number one. and i was like, well, shouldn;t i be number one? i mean, my mother is my best friend. i love her more than imaginable. when no one else is there for me, she is. not to say that we have a perfect relationship, i'm still a 16 yr. old girl, and she's still my mother, and that obviously means that we;re going to have our dissagreements, which we do. but it's still like i can talk to her. i don';t want to share her with people, because she's not their mother. i mean, if they (meaning her husbands kids) didn't ignor me like they did, maybe it woudl be better. and it's also like, i don;t need younger sisters, i can;t even talk to them about things that matter because theyre 6 and 8. i can't really have deep meaningful conversations with a 6 and 8 year old. also, it's like, they have eachother, and they have their father...and now my mother...not to mention their own mother...and for me, it's like, i have my mom. i also have the feeling that i don;t need any other family then the one i grew up with from ages like, 3 to 13, which would be my mothers side of the family, meaning my grandmother and such, because they are all i have. when my friends aren;t around, its a safe bet to think that i'm either at home with the mother or we're at my aunts or grandmothers. i mean, my grandparents heped raise me, and my aunt and uncle almost unded up taking me and my mother in if my grandparents hadn;t been able to. so, it's like, madd love, in an easy way of putting it. i mean, i guess that i should be thankful that all i have to worry about is like, not liking my stepfather. theres so many other issues than what i'm faced with, but it's like, their my issues, and i have a right to my feelings. so i shouldn;t be ashamed of complaining about that. like i told jason before...you shouldn't be ashamed of your feelings...no matter what they are. ok, i think i'm done venting. 
but it's like..there's just so many things i dislike about him. like...he uses my shampoo, he makes the toothpaste tube all messy, he has a dumb story for everything, when he's around his friends he thinks its ok at be an asshole to me, once he yelled at my mother, he yells at his kids and threatens to hit them, he tries to sing to my music, he eats a lot, he doesn;t take care of himself, he thinks its ok to be an asshole and skip on work..but is a COMPLETE HYPOCRIT because he thinks its ok to take off days now and then just because he wants to...he just overall makes me angry. the list will go on and on. and he likes country music, owns a race car, and basically made his 8 yr. old daughter take up go cart racing and wasted a LOT of money that could have went to ohh say...buying a nicer house like my mother wants?? i just don't like him. SHES MY MOTHER. ok...i guess thats all. i feel better now that i've vented....more to follow.

i have tap tonight, and i don;t really feel like going. but i might as well. i mean, we DO pay a lot of money for it. and the shoes cost a lot. but i love them, so it's ok. 

i have a hankering to listen to the strokes. but i'm not sure which cd i want to listen to. more than likely their first one. maybe the second. maybe the first, THEN second. so many decisions...yeah....

tonight, off to the mall with mother for a shopping trip, and then back home to study for tomarrow. good shit. yeah. tomarrow i have my history and english midterms. i'm not looking forward to it. i hate studying. it's not my style. ohh well. we've had 5 days off school in a row, so i shouldn't complain. we had a snow day, and then they cancelled because it was too cold, and then the weekend, and today we had off....downside? we have 4 straight days of midterms now instead of 2 last week and 2 this week. ohh well. 
i guess thats all for now. maybe more later. ttyl

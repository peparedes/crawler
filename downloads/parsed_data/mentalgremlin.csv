For You alone can give
What one cannot demand from oneself.
Give me, Lord, what You have left over,
Give me what no-one ever asks You for.
I don't ask You for rest, or quiet,
Whether of soul or body;
I don't ask You for wealth,
Nor for success, nor even health perhaps.
That sort of thing You get asked for so much
That You can't have any of it left.
Give me, Lord, what You have left over,
Give me what no-one wants from You.
I want insecurity, strife,
And I want You to give me these
Once and for all.
So that I can be sure of having them always,
Since I shall not always have the courage
To ask You for them.
Give me, Lord, what You have left over,
Give me what others want nothing to do with.
But give me courage too,
And strength and faith;
For You alone can give
What one cannot demand from oneself."

She said I never seen a man, who looks so all alone, could you use a little company? 
If you pay the right price, your evening will be nice, or you can go and send me on my way, I said your such a sweet young thing, why'd you do this to yourself? 
She looked at me and this is what she said.

There ain't no rest for the wicked, money don't grow on trees, I got bills to pay, I got mouths to feed, there ain't nothing in this world for free.
I know I can't slow down, I can't hold back though you know I wish I could, oh no there ain't no rest for the wicked, until we close our eyes for good.

Not even 15 minutes later, after walking down the street, when I saw the shadow of a man creep out of sight, then he swept up from behind, put a gun up to my head, he made it clear he wasn't looking for a fight, he said give me all you've got, I want your money not your life, if you try to make a move I wont think twice, I told him you can have my cash, but first you know I've got to ask, what made you want to live this kind of life? 

He said there aint no rest for the wicked, money don't grow on trees, I got bills to pay I got mouths to feed aint nothing in this world for free.
I know I can't slow down, I can't hold back though you know I wish I could oh no there ain't no rest for the wicked, until we close our eyes for good.

Now a couple hours past, and I was sitting in my house, the day was winding down and coming to an end, so I turned on the TV, and flipped it over to the news, and what I saw I almost couldn't comprehend, I saw a preacher man in cuffs taking money from the church, he stuffed his bank account with righteous dollar bills but even still I can't say much cause I know were all the same, oh yes we all seek out to satisfy those thrills.

You know there ain't no rest for the wicked, money don't grow on trees, we got bills to pay we got mouths to feed ain't nothing in this world for free.
We can't slow down, we can't hold back though you know we wish we could. you no there aint no rest for the wicked, until we close our eyes for good."

"event","Well, I am officially old.  Saturday we had a party. We try and do a party after every semester but missed the last one.  Our friend Zeke got his state license for to be a cop, mary and i were finished and seth was between digs so we had them all over for a night of dining, drinking and debauchery. Army made curry and tandoori chicken, i fired up the grill for hot dogs and such for the non-curry eaters and got some booze.  Mary even surprised me with Tsingtao, a chinese beer that is my favorite. We ate, we drank, we played RockBand and we talked, reveled, and told stories. We drank, a little too much, but we had fun.  I feel refreshed.

It does make me miss those who werent there, but to each their own.

AND I did have a slight headache when i dragged myself out of bed Sunday morning, so i have officially had a hangover. I feel so proud.

OH! Mom made a cake for Zeke...it was a pig...he laughed but i am pretty sure i will pay for it later as it was my idea.

Namaste"

"event","In a completely anticlimactic turn of events...no one called. i dont know if i am more relieved or disappointed.  I wanted to get the first one done and out of the way, but....well...Ambivalence reigns.  I guess i'll have to wait til the 19th to try again.
thank you all for the support.

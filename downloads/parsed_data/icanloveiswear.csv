"event","I dunno why I can't sleep at night. I went to bed at 10 last night.  Woke up at 2 this morning.  Ridiculous.  So usually, I sleept late into the afternoon to catch up, so that I don't fall asleep at work. With that said, let me get to the main story.


My mom came in around 10 or 11, asking me if I wanted to go help Dad out at his work.  As much as I'd love to, I have a job of my own now.  Furthermore, I don't have the gas, at the present, to drive to dad's work, then to my work.  Even furthermore, I fell asleep at 8 this morning, only to be woken up by everyone in my house slamming around and shouting.

So I tell her ""No, sorry.  I have work at 3.""  I should have known that she would argue with me about it.  But I didn't know it would get to the point of her getting in my face and yelling, following me around yelling at me, blah blah blah BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH.  Not that it matters, because 20 years of her crap is enough to condition someone to tune it out completely, and that's usually what I do.  But.  Because I turned down Dad's offer for work, mom decides:

-I'm too lazy to deserve new glasses, so...No new glasses for Nick

-I'm not going to get anywhere in life.  Apparently, you have to be latched to a mother's nipple your entire life to survive.  This is her problem, not mine.  I was never breast fed.

-I'm letting my Dad down by not helping him (MOM said this, not dad).





I'm being effing PUNISHED for having a job of my own.  When they hounded me about getting a job for quite some time.  No.  Not they.  SHE.  Dad is cool.  But my mom is crazy.

She's gonna be in for a rude awakening when I don't live here anymore, and she has no one to push around.  And I'm not using the term push around lightly.  She's very disrespectful to me.  Who's gonna take her sh** then?  Dad?  Doubt it.

My mom has come close to pushing me over the edge several times before.  I just don't let her anymore.

She packed one of our closets full of Old Navy Boxes (poorly).  I opened this closet door to get a towel for a shower, and the boxes came tumbling out.  She started screaming at me ""PICK THOSE UP. NOW. ARRRRRGH.""  I told her ""You're the one who friggin' put them in here poor---SHUT UP NICK.""  

I hope she stubs her toes or something today, so that she can experience an OUNCE of the crap I put up with from her."

By the grace of God, they are: 

Sister Eleanor Lewis 
Sister Francesca Godard 
Sister Helen Davis 
Sister Catherine Arnold 
Sister Mary Lee Pond 
Sister Virginia Wessex 

This intent of this book is for it to be used as a simple and direct guide in a time of great danger. 

I pray that this is merely a work of fiction. 

If it is not, then I pray for you, the reader of this book. 

If I am still alive when the events foretold in these pages occur, then I hope that you will find me before it is too late. 

Roberta Ann Sparrow 
October, 1944 

Chapter One: The Tangent Universe 

The primary universe is fraught with great peril. War, plague, famine and natural disaster are common. Death comes to us all. 

The Fourth Dimension of Time is a stable construct, though it is not impenetrable. 

Incidents when the fabric of the fourth dime(n)sion becomes corrupted are incredibly rare. 

If a Tangent Universe occurs, it will be highly unstable, sustaining itself for no longer than several weeks. 

Eventually it will collapse upon itself, forming a black hole within the Primary Universe capable of destroying all existence. 

Chapter Two: Water and Metal 

Water and Metal are the key elements of Time Travel. 

Water is the barrier element for the construction of Time Portals used as gateways between Universes at the Tangent Vortex. 

Metal is the transitional element for the construction of Artifact Vessels. 

Chapter Four: The Artifact And The Living 

When a Tangent Universe occurs, those living nearest to the Vortex will find themselves at the epicenter of a dangerous new world. 

Artifacts provide first sign that a Tangent Universe has occured. 

If an Artifact occurs, the Living will retrieve it with great interest and curiosity. Artifacts are formed from metal, such as an Arrowhead from an ancient Mayan civilisation, or a Metal Sword from Medieval Europe. 

Artifacts returned to the Primary Universe are often linked to religious Iconography, as their appearance on Earth seems to defy logical explanation. 

Divine intervention is deemed the only logical conclusion for the appearance for the Artifact. 

Chapter Six: The Living Receiver 

The Living Receiver is chosen to guide the Artifact into position for its journey back to the Primary Universe. 

No one knows how or why a Receiver will be chosen. 

The Living Receiver is often blessed with a Fourth Dimensional Powers. These include increased strength, telekinesis, mind control, and the ability to conjure fire and water. 

The Living Receiver is often tormented by terrifying dreams, visions and auditory hallucinations during his time within the Tangent Universe. 

Those surrounding the Living Receiver, known as the Manipulated, will fear him and try to destroy him. 

Chapter Seven: The Manipulated Living 

The Manipulated Living are often the close friends and neighbours of the Living Receiver. 

They are prone to irrational, bizarre, and often violent behaviour. This is the unfortunate result of their task, which is to assist the Living Receiver in returning the Artifact to the Primary Universe. 

The Manipulated Living will do anything to save themselves from Oblivion. 


The Manipulated Dead 

The Manipulated Dead are more powerful than the Living Receiver. If a person dies within the Tangent Dimension, they are able to contact the Living Receiver through the Fourth Dimensional Construct. 

The Fourth Dimensional Construct is made of Water. 

The Manipulated Dead will manipulate the Living Receiver using the Fourth Dimensional Construct (see Appendix A and B). 

The Manipulated Dead will often set an Ensurance Trap for the Living Receiver to ensure that the Artifact is returned safely to the Primary Universe. 

If the Ensurance Trap is succesful, the Living Receiver is left with no choice but to use his Fourth Dimensional Power to send the Artifact back in time into the Primary Universe before the Black Hole collapses upon itself. 

Chapter Twelve: Dreams 

When the Manipulated awaken from their Journey into the Tangent Universe, they are often haunted by the experience in their dreams. 

Many of them will not remember. 

Those who do remember the Journey are often overcome with profound remorse for the regretful actions buried within their Dreams, the only physical evidence buried within the Artifact itself; all that remains from the lost world. 

Ancient myth tells us of the Mayan Warrior killed by an Arrowhead that had fallen from a cliff, where there was no Army, no enemy to be found. 

We are told of the Medievel Knight mysteriously impaled by the sword he had not yet built. 

We are told that these things occur for a reason."

"event","I GOT THE JOB.  And that's all I have to say about that.  It'll be good to start generating my own revenue.  I'm happy because now I can actually 

A) Take my girlfriend on a nice, and proper date (something I've been unable to do for months, now)
B) Make my car payment without having to stress about it.  
C) Fill my car up.  
D) Make sure Blitz gets the best fruit. 
E) Make sure tanner has plenty of food and litter.  
F) Afford school books.
G) Start saving.
H) Buy little things (for myself and for others).


I'll be working Monday-Friday from 3pm-9pm every night.  That's 30 hours a week.  10 bones an hour.  I can work on Saturdays if I want from 10-2, and if I choose to, I'll be able to leave at 8pm the following week (i'm part time, so i can only work 32 hours). This job is an answered prayer.  However, if it starts to interfere with school, I'll seek a different job.  I also hope I get to see Lizzy as much as usual (which isn't saying much, as busy as we both are with school). 

Oh well.  Thank God.  I go in to fill out the paperwork tomorrow."

"event","We watched an insane video in abnormal psychology today.  It was a video of a lady with schizophrenia, and they were interviewing her.  Her thoughts were so disorganized that she could barely answer a question.  She continually went back to the same 3 or 4 notions:

1 - Jesus was communicating with her through the sound of dogs outside her house, and through the sound of a shotgun.  They had been writing letters to each other for about 10 years.
2 - When the clock said ""25"" every day, the men at General Motors told her to check her mail, as Jesus had a message for her.
3 - If she did not check her mail when the clock said ""25,"" the ""Eagle"" would come to kill her.
4 - If she didn't do what Jesus told her, she would be shot in the back of the head by the Eagle, with a shotgun.
5 - General Motors sent her money every month to do what they said, and what Jesus said.



She mentioned Jesus dropping a K-Mart bag from the ceiling into her floor, but that she had to keep her back turned to it, otherwise the shotgun would go off and the eagle would come.

That's how disorganized her brain was.  It was crazy, and fascinating to watch, kind of.

Brad,

It would be difficult for me to be any more miserable right now, I
feel like the worst person ever. First, let me start by saying that I
am truly truly sorry, and I hate myself for hurting you. Of all the
people in the whole entire world, you were honestly the last person
that I would ever want to wrong in any way. There is no excuse at all
for anything that happened, so I won't even try other than to say all
of us had WAY too much to drink, and I did a stupid thing. I can
handle you being pissed at me, I absolutely deserve it, I can even
handle the ugly words that were exchanged between us, what I can't
handle is thinking that you see me as a different person. It is weird,
I feel like I just went through a horrible break up or something. The
world looked funny yesterday, I couldn't crack a smile if you paid me,
there are songs I can't listen to, and I just ! feel beyond crushed. I
don't know if you meant everything you said to me, and I am hoping
that you didn't. I know that I was wrong on many levels, but I am also
hoping that this is something that we can deal with. I know it sounds
totally crazy and stupid, but you have come to play such a significant
role in my life, I can't imagine my days without you. It is totally
strange and weird to say that, and you could say that my behavior
didn't reflect that, and you would be correct. I hate feeling like you
hate me, and I hate feeling like all of your friends think I am a
terrible person, because I am not. I know there is nothing I can say
or do to take back what happened, but I just want you to know that
fighting with you was just about the worst thing I could have ever
imagined. It was right up there with one of the ugliest nights of my
life, and I would give anything in the world to rewind and fix it.

I am not sure if you will respond to this, part of me thinks that you
won't. If not today, then maybe some other time. Also, thanks for
getting my stuff together, although I think my sunglasses are still at
your house, if you could keep your eyes peeled for them that would be
great. I can't even focus or work today, I can't eat, I seriously feel
like it was an ugly break up, and I am hoping against hopes that it
was not that and you are not done with me. Please don't cut me off, I
really don't think I can handle that.

I am so sorry.

Elizabeth

Dear Elizabeth,

Thank you for your concern. I'll be sure to file it away under ""L""
for ""Long-winded diatribes from drunken whores I couldn't care less
about"".

You did a stupid thing huh? No...doing long division and forgetting
to carry the one is ""a stupid thing""; Mixing in a red sock with a load
of whites is ""a stupid thing""; Blowing some guy in a bathroom for 45
minutes while I sit at the bar wondering if you're taking so long
because you ate too much bran that morning isn't as much a ""Stupid
thing"" as it is grounds for permanent removal from my social calendar.

To be honest, I'm not sure if it was more amusing that you went and
degraded yourself in a public toilet not once but twice in a 2 hour
span, or that you seemed to think that by saying ""Well, I didn't Fuck
him"" somehow gave you a clean slate.

So forgive me if I couldn't care less if the world ""looked funny"" to
you yesterday. Since your world revolves around blow dryers, golden
retrievers, Prada Bags and Jelly Beans, I'm sure it must have been
most unsettling to actually have to consider someone else's feelings
for 24 hours straight. The good news for you is that my friends don't
think you're a terrible person, they just think you're the average run
of the mill cum-guzzling blond who commands about as much respect as
your average child porn collector. I could be wrong but, it's pretty
hard to respect some B&T chick who comes out to spend the night at my
place even though she's seeing someone else in New jersey and winds up
tongue-bathing the taint of anyone who decides 30 minutes of droning
commentary on Colin Farrell's new haircut is worth putting up with for
a hand job in the men's room. The good thing about being a guy is that
when I eventually bump into the young lad who finger-blasted you on
top of a towel dispenser last saturday, we'll have a shot and laugh
our heads off about the time it happened.

By the way, for the amount of time you claim to spend in spin class
you really must be doing something wrong to sport the thunder thighs
you do. Watching you parade around my bedroom in a thong was a little
like watching sea lions mate. Thought you might like to know.

PS. I BCC'd about 100 people on this email.

Talk to you never,
Brad"

"event","Here's what you missed tonight, if you didn't get the memo about Karaoke Cafe:



Don doing a near-flawless rendition of ""Bust a Move"" by Young MC, and even busted a move (and a nut) onstage.

A really wierd chubby kid singing patriotic songs trying to sound like Elvis.

Myself doing a fairly poor rendition of ""Kiss From a Rose"" by Seal.  Unfortunately, the Karaoke track was even HIGHER than the original.  So I struggled.

Some southern (but nice) dude singing Purple Rain by Prince.

Dweezil and Christian stealing the stage with the Beasties' ""Fight for your Right (To Party)""

Myself doing the greatest song of all time (back me up Mills):  ""CARRIBEAN QUEEN"" by Billy F'in Ocean.


I'll let the rest of the boys further elaborate on the night.  To say it was magical is understatement personified..."

"event","Here tells the recent events in the life of Nick Miller:


Halloween party was fun.  Micah and I owned with our costumes.  Pics to come hopefully.

Still jobless.  I applied for 10 jobs last night.  If one of thost bastages doesn't call me back, I'm going to just get a normal minimum wage suck job, and if I can't pay for my car, my parents can have it back for all I care.  It's not worth all the stressing over.

In being jobless, I'm doing better than I've ever done in school since about 6th grade.  I hope that me (eventually) getting a job doesn't put a damper on this.

I bought Star Wars 3 last night.  Watched it twice.  Once when I got home, then once with Dad (who hadn't seen it).  Yoda slices and dices like a sunnuvabish.

Mr. Fahrenheit hasn't practiced in about 3 weeks now.  No one is to blame, it's just a busy and complicated month for everyone.  No worries.  

Mr. Fahrenheit recorded 5 songs almost 3 weeks ago, and we still haven't gotten them from the guy who did it.  I'm beginning to get ancy about it, dare I say impatient.  I guess you can't really know how it feels unless you've been in the situation, but when you spend a bunch of time writing music, then recording it, it sucks to feel like someone is dangling your property over your head...so hopefully we'll get it soon.  

Mr. Fahrenheit needs a show in the worst kind of way.  We're all jonesing.

Haven't played cards in a long time.  I could go for that sometime soon.

David Bowie rules.

Lizzy is spending 98% of her time studying, so that can be stressful.  To add to the stress, school is so time consuming this semester, that we hardly have time to go on a proper date.  So whenever we get the opportunity, we try to hang out, even if it's only for a short while.

I have an anthropology test today.  I tried to study for it, but it was real hard to stick to the study guide that she made, and at the same time, the book seemed so detached from what she was teaching in lecture, that I feel as though my studying was in vain.  I suppose we'll see when the test is graded.  Prayers please."

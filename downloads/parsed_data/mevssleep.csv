Went to the doctor, got put on new meds today. We'll see how this set goes.

I've got a feeling that one of these scripts will turn me into a nice Martha Stewart/Betty fuckin Crocker/Mommie Dearestn type, but shit, let's get it crackin.

boondock saints, fresh notebook, dope pens...

"event","To do:

1. Get off my ass.  I'm so lazy these days.  I have all these Pilates/TaeBo/Strip Aerobics/Yoga DVDs that are just sitting around, collecting dust.  I used to at least attempt to work out a couple of times a week, but I haven't done shit lately and it's starting to bug me. The irony is that instead of just doing something, I'm sitting down in an overstuffed chair, typing about exercising.

2. Manage my money better.  There's no reason for me to be broke all the time.  I make enough money to be semi-comfortable, but I blow my funds on stupid shit.  I need to start saving up so I can pay these attorney fees and get a little stash going for my move to Georgia.

3. Put more into making my relationship stronger.  Self-explanatory.  I've been so preoccupied with petty shit that I haven't been focusing on building our future like I should be.  

4. Prioritize.  My priorities are a little out of whack.  This one isn't going to be all that difficult to remedy.  

5.  Start working towards a career.  I need to look inside myself and find out what I truly want to do.  Then, I need to do what it takes to get there.

6.  Make the most of my time.  I haven't been taking great care of myself- physically or mentally.  I need to treat myself better in order to feel better.  I need to get more sleep. I need to put a little nore effort into looking my best, even if I'm just going to work.  

Yeah that's it for right now.  I'll start with this shit, then move on to the next areas that need work.

"event","The past couple of days, I've been a nervous wreck.  Not that I'm not a nervous wreck every single day of my life, but these days- more so than usual.  I'm almost fairly sure I'm having a quarter-life crisis.  Again.

I miss my hair.  I wasn't too depressed about it until my son told me last night to put my hair back.  Now, that's depressing.  Least of my worries, though.  Hair grows back.  Most of the time, anyway.

It's too damn cold outside.  

I've got issues with jealousy.  Well- jealousy and static cling.  Jealousy, static cling, and staying on one topic. Or two topics.  My brain is 75 different places and none of them are the right place.  I miss Sean. I hate that we're not getting along and I hate that it upsets me even more to know that there are people out there who are actually happy that things aren't going so well in my relationship.  I guess they can just sit and spin, cause in the long run, I'll end up happier and more well-adjusted. Yes, I'm talking myself up.  Whatever works, right?"

"event","It's just not the cards for me to get a good haircut. You know, ever. I'd been growing my hair out for about two years and finally got to a decent length, but it was lookin shabby, so I figured it needed some styyyyle.  So Sean and I go and I show the lady not one, but TWO pictures of the hairstyle/cut I wanted.  You know, shorter layers around the crown for body and razoring for texture? Sure, it's rad in theory.  Unfortunately, something went horribly wrong during the actualy putting-it-into-reality part.  I told her specifically that I wanted to keep my length in the back and most of the sides.  That I ONLY wanted layers around my face and the crown of my head so my hair wouldn't just hang straight and boogly all the time.

Oh, it's awesome.  If I had a functioning camera, I'd take a flick.  It's like Ms. Brady hair....or like I should be an extra in one of those 70s cult films about all-female prisons. The highlights look like shit, they are brassy and fucktastic, so I refused to pay for them.  I'm sure that went over well, cause they called the manager and shit, but no way was I gonna pay that much money for this bitch to make me look like a damn fool, so I didn't.  The downside? My insta-karma lurched into action and I lost my cell somewhere bewteen leaving the salon and the car. Never did find it, soe my poor, scared cellie is roaming the streets of Atlanta...damned if I do, damned if I don't.

Highlights?  Got a ton of new striped softball socks. I was gonna get a man/pedi, but noooooooo, overwhelming spur of the moment urge to get a fucking hair cut took over.

im so peachy"

"event","Between Nicholas being sick, me being sick, and then the Saturday night I had, I just don't think I'm ever gonna get any sleep ever again.

I fucking hate winter.  I am miserable when I'm cold, miserable when the sun is no where to be found, miserably while watchin the leaves fade out and die.  How damn depressing.

Aha, also today is Stacey and Ryan's one year wedding anniversary. YAY guys

I think Sean and I are about to go for doughnuts and then to the bank.  We partied like pros last night, so today is gonna be slowwww goinnng.

hollerholler

Oh yeah, and I meet with my attorney Tomorrow.  This is literally the most badass thing that has happened to me so far this year.  I'm eady for this divorce to be finalized so I can move on, get my maiden name back, and move to Atlanta.  I haven't been this comfortable in a relationship....well.....ever.  I am so lucky and so blessed to have this man in my life. You guys can joke all you want, but I Am Happy.  Jeez, I'm gettin all girly and hormonal.  Anyway, you know how I said I've been unmotivated this past year?  Well, he actually motivates me.  He makes me want to accomplish any goal I have, do better for myself, and he encourages me and always has my back. Plus, he loves my son, and that was crystal clear from the jump.  What can I say?  His momma raised him right!

Ok ok I'll stop with all the mush.  Think I'ma see bout getting a haircut today, if sean doesnt mind waiting...

more later, shower time"

"event","Shit, it's 4:10 in the morning and already today sucks.  I've just experienced first-hand what happens when you combine a sick child and 6 gazillion gallons of chocolate soy milk: you get six gazillion gallons of chocolate soy milk vomit erupting like a geyser.  So after stripping the bed, the kid, and myself and donning fresh gear for all, I'm sitting here, being bored as hell, wide awake.

Looks like I won't be going to work today.  It's cool, though.  Hopefully, his pediatrician can see him early, and we can come home and make blanket pallets and watch movies in our pajamas.  Just as long as he doesn't puke on me again, we're cool.

Had to go to the doctor yesterday about my foot.  I'm amazing when it comes to falling down, and I rolled the same damn foot that I hurt a few months ago.  No breaks, but tore some tendons or ligaments or something on the top part of my foot, and they put me in this complicated-ass brace with too many straps and velcro and strings.  Which is great, considering I'll be in Atlanta this weekend and nothing says sexy like a giant lace-up orthopedic boot.  I guess I'll be a gimp for Halloween this year.  On the upside, I'm chock full of opiates and feeling itchy but great.

High five for my incredible lack of motor skills!"

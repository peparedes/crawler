"event","So I wasn't feeling very good this morning and I am not feeling very well now. Maybe it was the Mexican food that ate at 8:30 last night? Note to self- don't eat Mexican that late on a school night. Still, I am feeling pretty shitty. 
 One thing that I love about professional days (yes I said love in that statement) is the fact that I get to converse with other teachers. As odd as this sounds ( I am not anti-social, it is just the fact that my classroom is so far away from everyone and everything in the world) this is an opportunity to speak openly about things...like mostly the shit that has been going on with the band. I like this chance because, well, I don't feel so badly about myself and the job that I am doing- and I find out how supportive and geniunely nice the staff here is. And I find out, well, others have been though what I am going through, and if they haven't they can empathize, and that is just such a nice feeling, to be listened to sometimes. 
 Last night I was thinking about how much I love Jay and why. I love him e because he is a best friend- he has seen all sides of me- from college, though college- he has been at, and part of, every most important event in my life in the last 3 years, and those are the important ones for me. I don't know- really. How do you define a love that you cannot live without? Maybe there isnt a point in the definition anyway. 
 I wish the heat in this room would turn on sometimes soon. But then again, it will be that stupid dry heat- that ruins both my skin and my voice. Can't win. I have lots of phlem in my throat- is that a sign of a sare throat or a cough? grr."

"event","It seems to me that the new popular way to go is called ""my Space"". When I was in college, (not that long ago) LJ was it. 
I think LJ requires more intelligence because you actaully have to write something. Yes or no? Does anybody agree here?"

"event","MAJOR THIRD.  You fill in the hollowness...you are<br>the emotion in the chord.  You want life to be<br>rich and full for yourself and everyone around<br>you.  Beloved by Classical and Romantic<br>composers alike, you just want peace and<br>tranquility for all mankind.  Unfortunately,<br>most of the post-World-War II composers hate<br>you, but you tend to think that most music<br>since 1945 is crap, anyways.

"event","My biggest enemy in life is myself. Someday I will figure that out. I will also figure out how to not let myself be my enemy. 
In teachers clases in college, they really ougt to include meditation/relaxing/letting go somewhere in the curriculum. That is a very important skill- that is just kind of neglected. 
However, the sad truth of it is- that is why most beginning teachers don't make it."

"event","Here I am in the second incarnation of my Livejournal. Why I had to change it- well I just like to think that it was for the best. Hopefully all of you, my faithful Livejournal friends..all two of you...will be able find me. I am trying not to mourn the loss of my former identity. (sob)
I miss you Orpheansong. Let me live in that moment and acknowledge that feeling. Okay I am over it. 
I am glad that I have my internet venting space again though. Life is so interesting, lately I have been paranoid about my students...and other things, well there have been some things that have happened to me that, well, while they ended well (Thank you Jay- I love you) have unsettled me. And that hasn't really gone away- I don't think that it will. As a good friend of mine said, well, some things you just have to live with, they never really get resolved. 
 Anyway I am back with my new space..though it looks remarkably similar to the old one, doesn't it? Some things never change. 
 I went for a ridwe with my parents to look at fall foliage. I wasn't initially excited about this, but- it was actually somewhat enjoyable. CT is pretty. Maybe it helped that I had an issue of cosmo...
Our car almost got stuck in the middle of the forest. It is amusing now because we didnt actually get stuck. 
 Maybe in my new incarnation I will post my narrative."

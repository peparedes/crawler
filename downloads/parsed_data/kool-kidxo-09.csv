"event","So I have narrowed my options for college down to two places. It all depends on if I get into them. haha
Either TCC, which I have been accepted.. or Hunter College in New York City which I am still awaiting.
The end of the year is coming fast and I couldn't be more excited to get away from these immature girls
who party non stop. It gets really super old listening to their stories that I don't give two shits about.

And its even better when this person only talks to you when their &quot;party&quot; friends are pissing her off.
damn, why didn't i listen to my gut and stay far away from the bullshit. 
haaa whatever, college; i am ready for you."

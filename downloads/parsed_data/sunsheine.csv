""And then in the Fall I'm going to start a new film for Dark Horse comics, a cool company set in Portland, they're making movies now. It's an untitled Bruce Campbell movie where I play myself. It's about a small town that is having problems with a monster and nothing's working so somebody suggests ""let's get the Evil Dead guy"". Unfortunately, in reality I don't own a gun, I've never used a chainsaw and more die then before I got there.""

Bruce Campbell plays himself kicking monsters asses, I can actually say without lieing that I think this is the best movie idea in years."

Mass Buffy watching, in 2 weeks I've watched all of both series 1 & 2 and I've started series 3.


And I went to see Batman Begins.  It was awesome on oh so many levels, and the hint at the end for the sequel, well it's actually more of a big flashing neon noise making sign reading:

<b>JOKER!</b>

But who will play the Joker.  I have an idea...

Oh yeah!


And I also want to see War of the Worlds, also known as: E.T. 2

<img src='http://shadowknuxx.designerpad.org/et2.png'>

Yes, I've had a lot of free time.


I've been watching a lot of Big Brother.  I take back my comment about Danny Reilly and Derek.  That was based on first impressions, I have since realised that Derek is a a bit of a knobhead.

Impressions as the weeks have passed:

<u>Anthony (Team Saskia)</u>
Is less self-obsessed than I thought.  Is actually a good housemate.

<u>Craig (Team Saskia)</u>
Really disliked him at first, but since joining Team Saskia he's become one of the funniest housemates.

<u>Derek (Team Diva)</u>
Actually not like Danny Reilly. Derek is pompous, arrogant, thinks he better than everyone.  Only part of Team Diva because otherwise he's be on his own.

<u>Lesley (Evicted)</u>
Loud, annoying, a bully.  Not a nice housemate.  Also thinks the she's God's gift to men, hopefully God still has the receipt.

<u>Kemal (Team Diva)</u>
Hated him at first.  Then he became funny, then since they all split into two groups he's turned into a bit of an annoying knobhead.  

<u>Makosi (Team Diva)</u>
An evil genious.  She is manipulating everyone.  She has Kemal thinking that she loves him, but she actually hates him.  Also gets away with rule breaking way too much.  By far the cleverest housemate.

<u>Mary (Evicted)</u> 
Didn't do much.  Complained about people being false, while telling eveyone about her magic powers and alien friends.

<u>Maxwell (Team Saskia)</u>
True Big Brother legend.  He must win! Unless he gets walks out because of Saskia probably leaving, or gets kicked out if he ends up punching Science.

<u>Roberto (Evicted)</u>
A lot of people don't like him, I thought he was funny, most of the time.

<u>Sam (Evicted)</u>
I liked her at first, then realised how incredibly boring she was.  And she laughs all the time, at anything, even if it's not funny or even supposed to be funny.  ""Hello Sam"" ""Heheh!""

<u>Saskia (Team Saskia)</u>
People really dislike Saskia.  I don't see what she's done wrong.  She's one of the best housemates, but will probably go tomorrow instead of Maxwell.

<u>Science (Loner></u>
He's not in any group really, he hates Team Saskia, but doesn't hang around with Team Diva.  He can be funny, but can also be really irritating.

<u>Vanessa (Team Diva)</u>
How did she get on this show?  She's so boring.  All she does is sleep, eat and suck up to Makosi.  She pretends to have a hurt leg, but keeps fogetting to limp.  Her tongue is too big to fit in her mouth, ""Herro Big Bwuvvar!  My nominathuns thurday will be fer thiernth and thathkiar""  It's not a lisp, its somethin much more than that. Worst housemate, she must go.

<u>Eugene (Unknown)</u>
The new guy.  He's pretty geeky, but seems like a good housemate.  Has potential to be funny.

<u>Orlaith (Team Diva)</u>
The new girl.  Has made it pretty clear which side she is on.  Attractive, oh yes.  Bitchy, oh yes also."

Big Brother.  Time to evaluate the housemates like last year.

<u>Anthony</u>
<img src='http://www.channel4.com/bigbrother/media/housemates/anthony_hp.jpg'>
Acted like a self-obsessed idiot on his way into the house, but has sinced calmed down and seems to be pretty cool.  Is a profession 70's dancer?  What?

<u>Craig</u>
<img src='http://www.channel4.com/bigbrother/media/housemates/craig_hp.jpg'>
His application was video was awful, I think he trying to see how many times he could swear between each word in a sentance.  Hasn't really done much since getting in the house.

<u>Derek</u>
<img src='http://www.channel4.com/bigbrother/media/housemates/derek_hp.jpg'>
If Danny Reilly was born a black man.  Enough said really.

<u>Lesley</u>
<img src='http://www.channel4.com/bigbrother/media/housemates/lesley_hp.jpg'>
Loves the attention, I think shes gone topless about 5 times since entering the house.  She's also on face party for those faceparty fans out there - http://www.faceparty.com/lesley_luvz_u

<u>Kemal</u>
<img src='http://www.channel4.com/bigbrother/media/housemates/kemal_hp.jpg'>
Apperently he's this years Marco.  I hated Marco.

<u>Makosi</u>
<img src='http://www.channel4.com/bigbrother/media/housemates/makosi_hp.jpg'>
Victim of BB's evil twist, unlucky.  Hard to say about her since she's trying to be annoying.

<u>Mary</u>
<img src='http://www.channel4.com/bigbrother/media/housemates/mary_hp.jpg'>
Scary Mary.  The eyes, the scary eyes.  She claims to be witch and have been abducted by aliens at least 7 times.

<u>Maxwell</u>
<img src='http://www.channel4.com/bigbrother/media/housemates/maxwell_hp.jpg'>
""He's a bloody bloke!""  This guy has got to win.  With such comments as ""Wristbands!  What the fuck is with wristbands!?"", ""You're a virgin?  Soon sort that out for you love!"" or his ""Get your tits out for the lads!"" chant at Lesley.

<u>Roberto</u>
<img src='http://www.channel4.com/bigbrother/media/housemates/roberto_hp.jpg'>
The Italian stallion.  Former school teacher who hung one of his pupils up from a coat-hanger.  Could possibly go far.

<u>Sam</u>
<img src='http://www.channel4.com/bigbrother/media/housemates/sam_hp.jpg'>
Probably the second best looking of the women in the house, and describes herself as ""The horniest woman you'll ever meet"".  I predict something between her & Maxwell.  ""Girl, you are in trouble!"" - Maxwell

<u>Saskia</u>
<img src='http://www.channel4.com/bigbrother/media/housemates/saskia_hp.jpg'>
I'd say probably the best looking.  Seems to be a really nice girl.  A bit surpised by her extreme views on foreigners, ""They all just want to bomb us!""

<u>Science</u>
<img src='http://www.channel4.com/bigbrother/media/housemates/science_hp.jpg'>
The ghetto spokesman.  Fantastic name.  ""Science?  As in Maths & English"" - Maxwell.

<u>Vanessa</u>
<img src='http://www.channel4.com/bigbrother/media/housemates/vanessa_hp.jpg'>
I thought she was going to be really loud and annoying, but she's not yet.  Infact, she's said nothing ... at all.


So in short...

Maxwell to win.
Sam, Saskia are the hottest housemates.

Good day!"

Er ... no.  It's not rebelling if we're only rebelling because we've been told to rebel, that's conforming.  So to be a true rebel, you'd not rebel and do nothing.  And that's not rebelling either.  And it's just a confusing mixed up mess of a conclusion to a crap show.

I think South Park put it best:

""I won't join you, because I'm a non-conformist!""

Is Your Child a Goth? Presented by St. Mary's Church

Source: http://www.stmaryschurch.org

Listed below are some warning signs to indicate if your child may have gone astray from the Lord. Gothic or goth) is a very obscure and often dangerous culture that young teenagers are prone to participating in. The gothic culture leads young, susceptible minds into an imagined world of evil, darkness, and violence. Please seek immediate attention through counselling, prayer, and parental guidance to rid your child of Satan's temptations if five or more of the following are applicable to your child.


-Frequently wears black clothing.
-Wears band and/or rock t-shirts.
-Wears excessive black eye makeup,lipstick or nail polish.
-Wears any odd silver jewelry or symbols.
-Shows an interest in piercings or tattoos.
-Listens to gothic or any other anti-social genres of music. (Marilyn Manson claims to be the anti-Christ, and publicly speaks against the Lord. Please discard any such albums IMMEDIATELY.) 
-Associates with other people that dress, act or speak eccentrically.
-Shows a declining interest in wholesome activities, such as: the Bible, prayer, church or sports.
-Shows an increasing interest in death, vampires, magic, the occult, witchcraft or anything else that involves Satan.
-Takes drugs.
-Drinks alcohol.
-Is suicidal and/or depressed.
-Cuts, burns or partakes in any other method of self-mutilation.(This is a Satanic ritual that uses pain to detract from the light of God and His love.  Please seek immediate attention for this at your local mental health center.) 
-Complains of boredom.
-Sleeps too excessively or too little.
-Is excessively awake during the night.
-Demands an unusual amount of privacy.
-Spends large amounts of time alone.
-Requests time alone and quietness. (This is so that your chid may speak to evil sprits through meditation.) 
-Insists on spending time with friends while unaccompanied by an adult.
-Disregards authority figures; teachers, priests, nuns and elders are but a few examples of this.
-Misbehaves at school.
-Misbehaves at home.
-Eats excessively or too little
-Eats goth-related foods. Count Dracula cereal is an example of this.
-Drinks blood or expresses an interest in drinking blood. (Vampires believe this is how to attain Satan. This act is very dangerous and should be stopped immediately.) 
-Watches cable television or any other corrupted media sources. (Ask your local church for proper programs that your child may watch.) 
-Plays videos games that contains violence or role-playing nature.
-Uses the internet excessively and frequently makes time for the computer.
-Makes Satanic symbols and/or violently shakes head to music.
-Dances to music in a provocative or sexual manner.
-Expresses an interest in sex.
-Masturbates.
-Is homosexual and/or bisexual.
-Pursues dangerous cult religions. Such include: Satanism, Scientology, Philosophy, Paganism, Wicca, Hinduism and Buddhism.
-Wears pins, stickers or anything else that contains these various phrases: ""I'm so gothic, I'm dead"", ""woe is me"", ""I'm a goth"".
-Claims to be a goth.

If five or more of these apply to your child, please intervene immediately.
The gothic culture is dangerous and Satan thrives within it. If any of these
problems persist, enlist your child into your local mental health center.

I think it's got something to do with the boots I got from the JJB yesterday.

And Sin City is a frikkin' awesome film.

EDIT:

There where the match scores which got removed in the hope that we could hide the scores, but that pretty much didn't work.


Sandy Lane FC 3 - 5 Jordan's team

Despite playing well, in a fashion that would have wiped the floor with Northway, Sandy Lane lost to the new team to enter the league.
For the first time this season, the Sandy Lane team were playing with less than a full team.  With Barrie Red not showing up for the match despite promising that he would, Liam Otty being absent for undisclosed reasons and defensive brick wall Johnny Gateley out for the match with a foot injury, but still turining up to support the team and keep an eye on the time (former time keeper Paul O'Rourke has been forced to relinquish his time keeping duties following many complaints of bias time keeping).

Within the first 20 minutes the away team already had a 2 - 0 nil advantage before the arrival of Chris Griffin and Ben Colquhoun, once the late-comers had got onto the picth, fortunes changed with a goal from Michael Penkman (who is reported to be out for 4-6 weeks following a leg injury), one more goal from the opposition and some unlucky misses from John mullin and Michael Penkman meant the first half ended at <b>3 - 1</b>.

The second half kicked off with a few substitions and position chanes taking place.  A second goal was scored by Graeme Martindale an opposition goal and a much contested penalty from Daniel Sage brought the score to 4-3.
Finally a penalty following a Colquhoun challenge in the closing minutes of the game left the score at <b>5 -3</b>.

Negotiations for a rematch are the works, although next week is scheduled for the usual Sandy Vs Northway game."

The first tine wasn't the result of a good or bad tackle, I just slipped and fell over, landing on my left arm.

So I ran outside forgetting how icy hail, and I went flying, according to Mr Chris Griffin who saw it happen:

What the hell?  So what if we got beat?  We've only won one match less than Northway, and we're not going to win if you won't even play.

"event","Unfortunately Mr Doyle is out of the country and Mr Sage missed half the match, so I'm going to have to attempt this weeks match report.  Sorry.  I'll keep it brief.

Northway - 6
Sandy Lane - 1

First half:

Own goal by Northway.  Two goals by Northway.
While not making any major mistakes, Sandy Lane just lacked the usual  'Team Love' magic.  Despite pre-match prediction of a Sandy Lane win based on the fact that the cookies in Sayers were soft, it was not a good day for the team.
Luck was not on the Sandy Lane side.  Neither was Doyle.

Second half:

Four Goals by Northway.
After a half time changover, involving Daniel Sage being replaced by ???? due to an early leave and Paul O'Rourke being repleaced by defensive brick wall Johnny Gateley, things didn't improve by the team.  After some real efforts and some unlucky defending, the Northway team seemed unstoppable with yet another Dave Walters goal and a long shot from Adam Edwards that flew past the defence, and a few more goals too.
Tragedy stuck Sandy Lane with a injury occuring with Mr Ben Lafferty, who had to be ushered off the pitch for possible medical attention.  The seriousness of the injury is unknown.  After a decent first half performance, Paul O'Rourke was brought back on to replace the injured defender.  Although no more goals were scored by Northway, the large portion of time spent in the Northway side of the pitch amounted to no more goals for Sandy Lane.  With Sandy Lane striker Graeame Martindale missing from next weeks lineup due to medical proceedings, will it be another defeat for Sandy Lane?"

Sandy Lane 2 - 4 Northway

After 90 minutes, Northway had won for the second time this season, although not without Daniel Sage scoring two for Sandy Lane, making him the top scorer in the league.  An own goal by Ben Colqhoun also caused problems for the team.  Also in this match, long time Sandy Lane player Michael Penkman made his welcome return after weeks of absence.
The match was frought with tension in the closing minutes of the game, with numerous powerful tackles, leaving injury worries and anger amongst players on the pitch.

Team News:
Sandy Lane player Adam Doyle is surrounded by injury fears after a possible blow to head, but time will tell on that one.
Paul O'Rourke has been slammed with a seven match ban after delivering a torrent of verbal abuse at team-mate Ben Colqhoun, although this injust ban could possibly (and probably will) be lifted before next week's game."

"event","After over a year of dreading, and weeks of bad-mouthing, I finally saw <b>Son of the Mask</b> today.

I didn't do tis straight away because I was too busy sitting there in disbelief...

It really <i>is</i> THAT bad.

I'm going to try and be fair, but words can't really describe what I really feel about this film.  And I am going to spoil what happens, because if you watch this, then you deserve to have it spoilt.  It's overly predictable anyway.

The first five minutes are actually not bad, I began to hold out some hope for this movie.  It's in a museum in Edge City (where the 1st movie is set) where the scene is stolen by Ben <i>'Bueller ... Bueller""</i> Stein (Dr Arthur Neuman from the first film), who can dave any scene.  Of course Alan Cummings appears as Loki, who is dressed as what looks like some kind of Norse Male prostitute and wants to know where his mask is, cue some pointless special effects and the decline of the film.
The next 20-ish minutes aren't so good, but bareable, in which we see Jamie Kennedy as Tim, a wanabee cartoonist who's failing in his career and is being pressured by his wife in having a baby.  Then his dog Otis (possibly the best actor in the entire film) finds the mask in a river (how it got there I don't know).
Then Tim puts on the Mask and becomes Jim Carrey, or at least a cheap and poorly done immitation of him.  Cue an embarrassing to watch song and dance scene that tries to mimick that one done in Coco-Bongo in the Mask.  Then he rushes home to have sex with his unsuspecting wife.
The next day, guess what?  Then we get a montage (not a good one) of odd things happening during the pregnancy such as the baby dancing while being scanned, but only Tim see's it.
We also get Bob hoskins wearing a silly viking hat shouting at loki telling him to get the mask.

Then the baby is born and the film really decends into pure inadulterated shit.
Otis is jealous because he's not Tim's favourite anymore, finds the mask and puts it on.  The next 15 or so minutes are just a series of dog vs baby battles which are poorly done and blatently ripped off from looney Tunes cartoons.  I found myself thinking, if the dog wants this baby dead, instead of setting up a collection of elaborate plans to get it which are obviously going to backfire, why doesn't it just shoot the damn thing?  I was suprised that I didn't see a box of explosives with ACME written on it.  Warner Bros should really sue.
The mum goes away for a week and for some reason the baby is making Tim's life hell by means of unfunny scenes involving bodily fluids, which is funny, if you're under the age of five.

Another thing that bothered me that Otis was wearing the mask during the day.  That contradicts the first film where it's made clear that the mask can't be worn during the day.  Nice move you idiots!

Loki transofrms into the mum, finds the baby, kidnaps it and won't give it back unless he gets his mask back.  Then when the mum gets home she gets attacked by Tim because he thinks that she's Loki.

<b>NOTE TO FILM-MAKERS - WIFE BEATING IS NOT FUNNY.</b>

Tim gets the mask back off the dog with a standard 'realising that he's been neglected in favour of the baby I'm sorry I won't do it again you're my best friend' scene.  It's almost painful.
Loki takes the Mask and the baby (Oh wow, didn't see that coming), Tim gets the mask back after the dog attacks Loki.  Then we get a car chase followed by a boxing match filled with pointless CGI.

The next scene is the worst, they make the baby choose between Loki and his parents ... why does he take so long to choose?  He's obviously going to choose his parents over the guy that kidnapped him.
Then Loki tries to kill the family before Bob Hoskins stops him and has a go at him.
Then Tim defends Loki and gives him and Bob Hoskins the Maks back...

THE GUY JUST KIDNAPPED YOUR SON AND TRIED TO KILL YOU!  WHY ARE YOU DEFENDING HIM!

Then we get a nice happy ending where Tim succeeds as a cartoonist and they live as a happy family.  Aww.

I'm not sure where this film wnet wrong, I think it was around the time where somebody said 'Hey! Let's make a sequel to the Mask!'

The writing is poor, the acting is worse.  The Special effects are decent, but pointless and try to make up for lack of plot.
Most of this fim is about the magic baby, the Mask isn't actually involved with the film that much.

I really like the first film, I see no good reason why this abomination was ever made.

I give it <b>2/10.</b>  And that's being generous, it's one of the worst films that I've ever seen.  It's complete and utter shite.  I saw this for free and still felt cheated.  I cannot stress how poor this is.


Ah well, at least I was right.  I'd have felt a bit foolish if it turned out to be really good."

An Englishman, an Irishman and an American where on top of the Empire State Building after having 15 pints, The American said: 

<i>""I heard that if you drink 15 pints you can jump off a building, fly around and land back on the builidng safely.""</i>

He then jumped off the building, flew around and landed back on the Empire State Building.
The Irishman was amazed and jumped off...

He fell to his death.

Northway - 3
Sandy Lane - 1

At a brisk day at the Stadio Di Northway, the League Champions suffered a grave defeat at the hands of Northway.

(I know I gave them different names last week, but I really can't be arsed...)

It's this match reporters honest opinion that today, Northway really did deserve to win.  After a solid performance, they took advantage of the team troubles plagueing Sandy Lane.  At the end of the day, they were the better team.
The problems began before the match kicked off, with an unknown mystery player turning up for the match (who will now be refered to as 'Mr <b>?</b>').  The appearence of Mr <b>?</b> raised several questions, such as:

<i>Who the hell was he?
Why was he there?
Why did he automatically assume that he could just turn up and play for Sandy Lane without even asking?</i>

None of these questions have yet to be answered, but Sandy Lane Player Robert Cross was clearly not happy, following a heated confrontation in the closing minutes of the first half.  The team was suffering with problems involving formation, but managed to make a small comeback during the second half after a team talk.

Also, there are injury fears for Sandy Lane Midfielder Paul O'Rourke, who despite still having problems with a leg muscle following last weeks game, continued to play, only worsening the condition.  He had this to say:

""My leg really fucking hurts.""

There are concerns as to whether to play in next weeks leg (no pun intended) against either Northway or the new team that may join the league - The Everest/The Northway Rejects.

That's all for this week.  ...There, happy now Edwards?

Redhouse Rangers - 0.

What a glorious day at the Sandy Lane Stadium.

After a late kickoff, due to the majority of The Alt FC not turning up until over 30 minutes after the scheduled kickoff, even with a suprise appearence by Ben Lafferty who was rumoured to not be playing due to injury fears. They all played a solid game and eventually won.

Very few expected this result, there was a minimal turnout of Alt supporters, even manager Michael Penkman and fan favourite Daniel Sage failed to make an appearance, but they would have been proud.

Both teams played excellently, The Redhouse Rangers had some excellent shots on goal, but nothing could get past the lightning fast reactions of The Alt goalkeeper Rooney who truly excelled himself.  It seemed to be a case of bad luck for Northway.

Another mention has to go to new Alt signing and man of the match Graeme Martindale who at times seemed unstoppable.  His excellent goal that took the Alt to a 2-0 lead brought life back into the team.

But of course, the rest of the team gave it their all, and did themselves proud.

The first goal was scored by Ben Colquhoun who tossed aside any transfer worries with a well aimed penalty that took both teams by suprise.
Goal number two came from Graeme Martindale around the mid point of the second half.
The third and final goal of the match came from Mr Christopher Griffin who smashed the ball through after previous failed attempts to score, this wonderful goal scored in the late minutes of the game set aside any doubts after Rob Cross had been taken off the pitch with a possible injury.

Barrie Rea had this to say about the victory:

<i>""Yeah, we fucking raped them!""</I>  Controversial words, from a controversial man.

So here we have it, proof that underdogs winning isn't just an over-used Hollywood cliche.  Unless it's used in the Mighty Ducks films.

Goodnight folks, we'll be back next week with the match report (Stadio di Northway, Wednesday at 3.00PM, get your tickets now)

The Alt Fc appear to be suffering from some team problems as striker Ben Colquhoun has announced that he wants a transfer to the Redhouse Rangers following a dispute over a prank involving his car, which has been since rejected by the team.  Adam Edwards and Mark Fillingham had this to say:

<i>""He's not good enough for our team anyway...""</i>

With kick-off in roughly half an hour at 3.00pm, the question has to be asked:  Who will win the clash of the titans? Sandy Lane appears to positive, team representative Barrie Rea had this to say regarding the match outcome:

"event","Yesterday was a vareity pack of entertainment...

The day started with watching of Manchester United Vs. Liverpool, unfortunately it wasn't the result I was hoping for.  The score was acceptable, it was the fact that Wayne Rooney actually left the pitch on his own two feet as opposed to a stretcher that disappointed me.

The rest of the day was spent lying around doing nothing until I spoke to Mr Reilly who suggested a few pints at the Red House, it was there that I found Mr Reilly & Mr Limo who'd both been there for about 9 hours, and were both pretty drunk, but the evening's entertainment came from Mr Limo who's very drunken and very loud renditions of Metallica songs were perhaps better than the real thing, this may or may not have been the reason why it was only us three sitting at the bar.

Unfotunately, I had to leave early as I learnt an important lesson about life...

Large portions of indian food & beer, do not bode well.  So I went home feeling sick and went to bed and watched TV.

The End.

(A recording of 'An Evening with Limo' will hopefully be on the Internet soon)."

"event","What happened to all the old kids TV shows we knew and loved? I miss them, they're better than most of crap on TV these days. So here's a tribute to the old'n's. 

<b>Updated - 16/01/05</b>

<b>Alf</b> - Alf, that alien sure loved those cats. 

<b>Alvin & The Chipmunks</b> - ALVIN! SIMON! THEODORE! So, what's the story here? Did Dave sleep with a chipmunk or something? 

<b>ARGH!  Real Monsters!</b> - A clever and inventive show.  Quality stuff.

<b>Bangers & Mash</b> - Monkeys that liked mud pies.  That's all I remember.

<b>Bananna man</b> - A healthy alternative your normal superhero.

<b>Biker Mice from Mars</b> - They so wanted to be turtles.

<b>Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventures</b> - The short lived spin-off from the films.  I don't remember it very well.

<b>Bodger & Badger</b> - Mashed potatoes.

<b>Bucky O'Hare</b> - <i>Bucky!  Captain Bucky O'Hare!</i> ... what a show!

<b>Captain Caveman</b> - Needs a haircut.

<b>Captain Planet</b> - <i>He's a hero, he'll take pollution down to zero!</i> I'd feel pretty cheated if I was the kid stuck with the power of heart. I'd want something cool like the power of fire. 

<b>Captain Pugwash</b> - With names like 'Seaman Stains' & 'Master Bates' you can't go wrong.

<b>Count Duckula</b> - He likes tomato sauce.

<b>Dangermouse</b> - He'd be nowhere without Pennfold.

<b>Dinosaurs</b> - That baby was really abusive. I'd have kept they frying pans out of it's reach. 

<b>Doug</b> - Skeeter. Pork Chop. Quailman. Patty Mayonase. Roger. The Beets. 

<b>Earthworm Jim</b> - <i>Earthworm Jim, we think he's mighty fine.  Earthworm Jim, a hero for all time</i>

<b>Fraggle Rock</b> - <i>Dance your cares away. Worries for another day. Let the music play. Down in Fraggle Rock!</i>

<b>Hammerman</b> - The MC Hammer cartoon. He didn't even look like MC Hammer. Although he did have baggy pants. 

<b>He-man & The Masters of the universe</b> - Just because he had 'THE POWER!' gives him no excuse to run around eternia in his underpants. Bloody exhibitionist. 

<b>Hong Kong Phooey</b> - Best Ninja/Janitor dog ever.

<b>Knightmare</b> - Anyone seen this recently?  I used to like it, but I recently realised that it sucks.

<b>Muppet Babies</b> - Somehow good. And the intro had a clip from Ghostbusters.

<b>Mighty Max</b> - A spin-off from the toys.  It had a talking owl, talking owls are boss.

<b>Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers</b> - <i>GO GO POWER RANGERS!</i> It was good, then it was milked for all it was worth.  Now it sucks.  I liked the theme tune.

<b>Mr Benn</b> - I think this guy was taking drugs in the changing rooms.

<b>Poddington Peas</b> - <i>At the bottoms of the Garden...</i>

<b>Rainbow</b> - I heard this was coming back, I hope so.

<b>Rocko's Modern life</b> - This was great.  I miss it.

<b>Roobarb & Custard</b> - Quality theme tune.

<b>Sooty & Friends</b> - I went to see this live every year. And I'm one of the few that doesn't hate cousin Scampi.

<b>Stoppit & Tidyup</b> - If you remember this, then you're cool.

<b>Superted</b> - A true hero, and his friend Spotty.

<b>The Super Mario Brothers Super Show!</b> - <i>Swing your arms from side to side, come on it's time to go, DO THE MARIO!</i>  The dancing guy at the end was awesome.  A true comedy classic.

<b>Teddy Ruxpin</b> - Anyone else remember this?  It was awesome from what I remember. A bear, his caterpillar type thing friend and some proffessor guy in a balloon thing.  I can't remember it very well.

<b>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</b> - <i>HEROES IN A HALF SHELL!  TURTLE POWER!</i>  Much better than the remake version.  A true classic.

<b>The Adventures of Pete & Pete</b> - This was great, with such memorable characters as 'ARTIE!  STRONGEST MAN, IN THE WORLD!'

<b>The Clangers</b> - This needed subititles.

<b>The Jetsons</b> - The Flintsones ... In space.  Basically.

<b>The Real Ghostbusters</b> - Still on TV, but deserves a mention because it was the best show of it's time.

<b>The Ren & Stimpy Show</b> - Sheer awesomeness.  One of the best cartoons ever.

<b>Thomas the Tank Engine</b> - I can't remember the names of the other engines.

<b>Thundercats</b> - THUNDERCATS!  HOOOOOOOH!  They didn't look like cats, but Lion-o had a cool sword.

<b>Transformers</b> - <i>ROBOTS IN DISGUISE!</i> I haven't even bothered to watch the remake, but I liked the original.

<b>Trap Door</b> - <i>Don't you open that trap door, 'cos there's something down there...</i>  SO good I've got a T-shirt of it.

<b>Wacky Races</b> - It was good, but you only needed to see one episode because the same thing happened every time.

<b>Where's Wally</b> - Better than the books?

<b>Where in the world is Carmen Sandiego</b> - I remember that I watched it.  I don't remember what went on in it.


So that's all for now, I hope you saw at least one thing that you forgot about and went into a nostalgic daze.  Or maybe your inner child is dead and you didn't appreciate any of the nostalgic glory.  

There's probably plenty I've missed from the list, but my attention span is only so long..."

"event","I wasn't sure about my new years resolutions, but I decided that they where going to be:

- Drink, but  don't get too drunk.
- Try harder in tech.

Within one week I'd failed, I got more drunk than planned last night (Alex's 18th, which on a sidenote was very good, but I was sad when <b>Rock DJ</b> was playing because nobody there knew the words to the alternate, better version, '<b>Rock Paul</b>'.) And I spent this week in tech either playing Colin Mcrae rally on Gateley's phone or drawing pictures of the <i>Crazy Frog</i> dieing horrible flaming deaths, which leads me to my next point...

My <i>new</i> New years resolution is to destroy the <i>Crazy Frog</i>, I've listened to the crap for the last time.  I can't even watch <i>Back to Future part 2</i> without that damn thing appearing and annoying me.  I don't know how I'm going to do it, but I will.

Also, I'm no <b>trilogy box set enthusiast</b>, but I'm tempted to get the Back to the future box set, because Oi Loike It!"

"event","If you were to ask me how I've felt this week, I most likely reply with:

""Like shit..."" <i> or </I> not reply at all because I couldn't talk because my throat has been completely fecked.

I think it started on Monday during the festivities for Mr Sages 18th, when a certain Mr 'Barrie Red' came despite being extremely ill and spending half the time practically passed out.

I don't know if it is the same thing, but I think I caught what he had ... so thank you very much Barrie.

It kinda felt like a really bad hangover with a bit the flu and a bad throat thrown in there too.  And I know it wasn't a hangover because the day before I felt like this I'd only had one bottle of beer.  And that was no ordinary beer...

It was <b>PERONI</b>!  Bloody marvellous!

So I've spent this week passed out on the couch watching Star Wars on ITV.  I think I'm pretty much better now, all I've got is a bit of a cough.

So ... a fun few days for me.  And I've just remembered that I've supposed to have been doing tech work this week ... gutted."

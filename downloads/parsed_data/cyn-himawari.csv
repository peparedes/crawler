"event","Ahhhhh finally....
I need to buy gravy mix and green tea, I should have bought miso soup mix when I went to Ranch Market last week. Yes the Meiji candies are good!
I started watching Gintama, it's funny, recommended to everybody.
Samurai Champloo is good too, Jinna says there is yaoi in it, and Jin is definitely the greatest corssdresser.
My dad thinks the whole house smells like super glue.
My cousin came over today and we played DDR. Ya know? Playing Rhythm and Police on heavy 3 times in a row without a stop is very stupid...
Elmer called today, just saying hi, yeah he is scary so I need to scare him whenever I see him!!!
Still need to go back to Mollie's and say ""good bye"" to Marco, Dave N. and Joy sometime.
I saw Mad's doujinshi today, it's cute! Guys in miniskirts!!!
Seems like I should clean up my AIM buddy list more often, there are always those people whom I never talk to and keeping mistaken them to be somebody else...Well I guess it's not mean to ask them ""who the hell are you"" since they probably added me on their list first and never talked to me again.
So rawr? So rawr!"

"event","Tomorrow is my last day of work, and next Tuesday is my last day in town.
    I wish I was not sad.
    I made a clay card for everybody in the store, but I didn't mention any specific names on the  card. I should have but I didn't, I hope they are still going to appriciate the present.
    I want to remember them all, everybody. Loren (""remember you've always got a home here!"" the boss who was always nice to me), Dave (the assistant manager who said ""where are you? Rawr at you!"" on the phone when I was late), Jesse (the cute guy I had crush on and the only person who can ALWAYS scare me, ""Evil S'more Machine! Lalala~""), Elmer (who had a weird sense of humor and gave me lots of free food, and the tickling battle), Yoli (the one I could always go to), Maria (who gave me the lei for graduation), Marco (crazy marshmallow squirrel jumping around attack!), Dave A (who meows and is unscareable)., Tony (""one day when you are rich and famous, you will remember those looney guys in the grocery store!""), Renee (""Yes you are a cookie monster even though you are not blue. Ohh no more sugar for her please!""), Joy (who always has pictures of her babies with her), Steve (get the hand off of the groceries), Chai (who actually let me took a picture of him wearing that weird hat), Miriam (who saved some Mexican chocolate cookies for me), Lina (who made those burritos), Juan (""pistachio pistachio pistachio pistachio pistachio pistachio...""), Amador (""arf! arf! You are the Pink Panther because you have pink shoes!""), Camillo (who always helped me with the go-backs in the produce department), Jose (""grrrr....claws""), Jose C. (who lent me Princess Mononoke), Jesus (more claws), Manuel (""your friends are ditching you for their boyfriends? then you should get a boyfriend and ditch your friends too!""), Linda (""gooooood morniiiing Jenny lulluuuu~""), Jenny C. (""see you later Crocodile! Because I'm the Alligator!""), Cary (""We gotta give her more sugar""), Seamus (who saved me from some creepy old guy), Wilson and Amy (who I stole chopsticks from), James (look at the cookie...""SMILE!""),  Dulce (""having fun with the toothpicks, Jenny?"") , Karla (who said ""thank you"" to me for some very small things), Maria P. (""sweet cakes for sweet girls!""), Rudy (who told me where everything is), Merissa (""surely that box could fly...and it's got a tail too!""), Steve B. (""to fish or not to fish? What a stupid quetsion!""), Andrew (""Sup Tiger?""), Tony F (""peka peka peka peka!""), Kevin (who really believed that I was crazy after I scared him), Hector (who was there for my first orientation)...(the list continues) I know I wouldn't be able to remember every little thing here, and maybe someday I will even forget some people. I was just talking to Madeleine about how nothing can ever last forever, even if they were the love or friendship we cherish the most today. I had a major somebody in my sophomore year, but now the fondness and excitement are almost forgotten. I cried when I was leaving my middle school class, but now I could barely remember all the faces of my old classmates and teachers. I'm afraid of someday I would lose these memories, I would be apathetic to them as to my silly middle school memories. 
    I always know that people forget somethings that were once important, and it is not because we don't want to care, it's because we have no move on. We can't be stuck with the past forever, and when the new life became your center of focus, the old stuff won't seem to be that important. It is the same for people too, the most passionate lovers and the closest friends would grow apart in time. Time washes away everything, and eventually our passions, excitements, ambitions, and one day, ourselves. The dead will be forgotten, like the once lovely memories, because they are just dead, cold, far away. 
    I shouldn't say these now, I'm too young to say things like this. I also wish I wouldn't be like one of those people who would easily forget the past, I even wish I could be who I was again but I can't! Nobody could, all we have left are memories, kept nicely in the little corners of our hearts and locked up by time. I cannot spend anymore time going over them again, otherwise I will miss what's really new and exciting in front of me.
    When I am old enough to be nostalgic, I will try every way to open the lock again like a little girl. I will see those once colorful photos, called ""the past"" fading away.
    And I will still found the excitement, even only for one minute.
    When I was leaving work today, I chatted a little with Jesse. I almost cried, but I turned away so he wouldn't see me cry.
    Because I have to move on, so I have no time for tears."

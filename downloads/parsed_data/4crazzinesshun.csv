"event","Today has to be my study day since I was up all night with jonah last night.  The baby was sick and I had to stand and cradle and sing to him till he stopped coughing and fell asleep.  So yea it was awful because he was just so helpless.
But but that the day was great.  I love driving in the cool air listening to Christmas music and running arrens for the party.  It was even more fun becuase my mother had no idea where we were going.  Can you belive that no one orders mistletoe anymore? Ok the lady must have been lying because every Christmas song we listened to on the radio had the word mistletoe in the lyrics.  
O I am going to be home for Thanksgiving so if you r too let me know, I want to plan to do something fun with everyone.  
Anywho I need to go study Bio and Math :)ha."

I wish I were in Italy.
So 20 things about myself don't worry I won't tag anyone.

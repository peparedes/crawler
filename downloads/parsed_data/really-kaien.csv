"event","I don't know what to say, really... I'm so confused about all this.

I was fighting a Hollow, the one that killed my wife, and... then I blacked out, I suppose. I don't know what happened, but the next thing I know, I was <a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/lolz_bleach/14916.html"">in the human world</A>. Yoruichi-san and Abarai-kun (who is apparently a Vice-Captain now?) were here, and they <a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/lolz_bleach/15257.html"">explained to me that I was dead</A> - had died 35 years ago- and that I was... not supposed to be here.

I was too confused to believe them (even though I had recognized Yoruichi's reiatsu... there was no doubt), and thought I was just trapped into an illusion created by that Hollow.

I ran away, only to find myself face-to-face with <a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/lolz_bleach/15493.html"">Ryuzoji-san and Yachiru-chan</A>... they confirmed that I had died and explained to me what had happened exactly... how Kuchiki had had to stab me in the end, and... how the one responsible for all this was Aizen-taichou. 

I had a hard time to believe them, but I had no choice at that point but to make everything I could to avoid Kuchiki (who is apparently stationed in the Human world at the moment too), and to contact Ukitake.

<a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/lolz_bleach/16788.html"">After a short negociation</A>, Abarai-kun lent me his... <i>cellphone</I>, which I <a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/lolz_bleach/18688.html"">had almost no trouble using</A>. I called Ukitake-taichou (ok, I had to use the best of my acting skills and pretend I was Abarai-kun for a while. Miyako would always say I was a bad actor. I guess she was right. BUT it worked... that's what matters!). It took a while to convince him that I was... me, but he seemed to believe me and asked me to join Soul Society as soon as I could.

<a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/lolz_bleach/19000.html"">As I still had Nejibana with me</A>, I managed to open the Senkai gates, but I apparently don't have a Hell Butterfly with me anymore, so my entrance was rather... theatrical. I only realized when I saw taichou that I had indeed been missing for a long time. We were about to talk about what had happened when Kyouraku-taichou arrived. He seemed to be rather suspicious of me, for which I can't blame him. Apparently, Soul Society has known some chaos over the latest few months. I do not know the details, but it can explain why he would be suspicious of a dead man suddenly coming back to life...

He placed me in a detention cell, preventively, until it is proved that I am... who I really am. 

I trust him, he is known for his fairness. But meanwhile, here I am, in a jail cell, waiting for who-knows-what, while only a few hours ago (at least, to me, it was a few hours ago) I learnt that my wife had been killed. I just... hope this will be over soon, so I can go and look for more information about what happened. To me, but also - and mostly- to my wife. 

Wherever you are, if you are watching this, Miyako: just know that I won't leave your death unpunished. If it is the last thing I do, I will avenge you. I promise you."

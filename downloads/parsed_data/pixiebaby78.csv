wut do u do when you kno you need to get over someone because they don't like you and u kno they wont ever like u like tht again?.. but you just can't quite get over them... theres always somethings tht keeps reminding u of them and makes u like them again..and its hard when hes the only one thts ever liked me like tht and made me feel happy and tht i made a difference..to somebody.. but now tht theres nobody tht likes me tht i just don't feel happy or tht im quite needed to ne one.. 

sometimes being alone can just tear you up and make you feel like shit..

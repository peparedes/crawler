"event","I deleted all the entries in here and was gonna just delete this journal, but one last post will  be good. I don't really know why I'm doing this but I'm having another one of those, hey let's try and cahnge our lives for the better kinda things. School is, easy. And I know it probbaly will get harder, but the teachers are trying so hard to be intimidating and they just aren't. And I'm really not enjoying orchestra, as much as I thought I would be. I know it's only been 2 days but, it just seems stupid. And I'm pissed that all these freshman get to sit infront of me. Stupid. I don't really have that many classes with people I, like, or even know. I miss people. Why all of a sudden? Because I'm a jealous stupid person and can't stand it when other people don't want to be friends with me or even associate with. I hate last year. It's discouraged me from even trying to be friends with other people because I'm afraid they are just gonna pack up and leave, well ditch is more like it. And I just have to say, you should NEVER NEVER NEVER ditch your friends for a boy/girl. None of you reading this have but I mean, it's just so stupid. People are stupid. I'm just not looking forward to this year. But to think that in only 3 years we will be in college? CRAZY. It's weird. That we have been in school for 10 years and only have 3 and then college left. It's cool. Also, did you know Me and Jill (Jill and I) have been best friends for 10 years? I think it's a pretty cool thing. And I don't mean best friends where you don't talk to each other for a while and then get friendly again this year. I don't know why I'm writing this no one reads this. Considering I comment alot on other people's journals and no one bothers too on mine, is annoying. If I didn't WANT people to comment I would write in a real journal/diary. But I don't. I love Gilmore Girls. And House. SO MUCH. LOVE. Those shows are just, AWESOME. Rehersal starts Sunday for ensemble and then Tuesday for acting. I hope this season/year is good. I hope school is good. I'm sick of people not  caring about anything anymore and the fact that Jill and I don't have seats at lunch. Whatever. I guess I'm just done with people. I'm beginning the recluseness."

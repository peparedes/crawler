They didn't say anything toooo ridiculous, though my Mom did ask if Rugby was the same as soccer, LOL.  They're supposed to pick up a CD of it today sometime.  They gave a plug to the reception location (Broadstreet Rugby Club) but failed to mention our names on air!"

INTENDED

<lj-cut text=""under here to groan"">1. Two antennas met on a roof, fell in love and got married. The ceremony wasn't much, but the reception was excellent.<br> 2. A jumper cable walks into a bar. The bartender says, ""I'll serve you, but don't start anything."" <br>3. Two peanuts walk into a bar. One was a salted.<br> 4. A dyslexic man walks into a bra.<br> 5. A man walks into a bar with a slab of asphalt under his arm and says: ""A beer please, and one for the road."" <br>6. Two cannibals are eating a clown. One says to the other ""Does this taste funny to you?"" <br>7. ""Doc, I can't stop singing 'The Green, Green Grass of Home.'"" ""That sounds like Tom Jones Syndrome."" ""Is it common?"" ""Well, 'It's Not Unusual.'""<br> 8. Two cows are standing next to each other in a field. Daisy says to Dolly, ""I was artificially inseminated this morning."" ""I don't believe you,"" says Dolly. ""Really! No bull!"" exclaims Daisy.<br> 9. An invisible man marries an invisible woman. The kids were nothing to look at either.<br> 10. Deja Moo: The feeling that you've heard this bull before.<br> 11. I went to buy some camouflage trousers the other day but I couldn't find any. <br>12. A man woke up in a hospital after a serious accident. He shouted, ""Doctor, doctor, I can't feel my legs!"" The doctor replied, ""I know you can't - I've cut off your arms!""<br> 13. Then there's the guy who went to a seafood disco last week and pulled a mussel.<br> 14. What do you call a fish with no eyes? A fsh. <br>15. Two fish swim into a concrete wall. One turns to the other and says, ""Dam!"" .<br> 16. Two Eskimos sitting in a kayak were chilly, so they lit a fire in the craft. Unsurprisingly it sank, proving once again that you can't have your kayak and heat it too.<br> 17. A group of chess enthusiasts checked into a hotel and were standing in the lobby discussing their recent tournament victories. After about an hour, the manager came out of the office and asked them to disperse. ""But why?"" they asked, as they moved off. ""Because"" he said, ""I can't stand chess-nuts boasting in an open foyer."" <br>18. A woman has twins and gives them up for adoption. One of them goes to a family in Egypt and is named Ahmal. The other goes to a family in Spain; they name him Juan. Years later, Juan sends a picture of himself to his birth mother. Upon receiving the picture, she tells her husband that she wishes she also had a picture of Ahmal. Her husband responds, ""They're twins! If you've seen Juan, you've seen Ahmal.""<br> 19. Mahatma Gandhi, as you know, walked barefoot most of the time, which produced an impressive set of calluses on his feet. He also ate very little, which made him rather frail and with his odd diet, he suffered from bad breath. This made him a super calloused fragile mystic hexed by halitosis.<br> 20. And finally, there was the person who shared twenty different puns with her friends, with the hope that at least ten of the puns would make them laugh. No pun in ten did.</lj-cut> </FONT>"

Next friday July 1st is my first dress fitting and I am so excited!  Plus, Mom said last night that she and Dad are coming up sooner than they originally thought so Mom might be able to come to the final fitting with me! 

Yesterday I was very emotional, and missed Alex so much it hurt.  Cried on the phone to him but he made me feel better.  Still slept through the night holding Alex The Bear close though.  Two and a half months to go.  Sometimes this final stretch seems the hardest to bear."

All my life I've moved around and they've always been in Taunton, either in the house I grew up in, or staying with my Aunt & Uncle, or in the condo they bought in 1998 (which was technically in East Taunton but same diff).  Now they'll be in Florida.  And even though I'll be moving in a matter of months, it feels <i>weird</i>."

Well, some of you did already know this was coming but it's now official! As of this past Sunday morning around 1 am GMT, the cd player suddenly turned on and began to play a certain Proclaimers song and Alex got down one one knee and formally proposed. Needless to say I said yes (surprised I didn't cry as well). It's a beautiful ring (I'll post pics when I get a chance) and we're both extremely happy!


PS - sorry to those of you that will see this multiple places!"

"event","Today is our 2 year anniversary :-)   Alex sent me two dozen roses which arrived a little while ago and are currently sitting in a vase in the kitchen looking and smelling beautiful.  We talked briefly about the Peugeot Club (he went to see it earlier today) and it sounds promising.  Certainly won't be too small! Their drinks prices were extremely reasonable compared to elsewhere.  They're going to be sending information about the food and he took some pictures for me to see.  


I have to work later on but have decided to be productive shortly by cleaning the bathroom vanity and trying to make bath fizzies."

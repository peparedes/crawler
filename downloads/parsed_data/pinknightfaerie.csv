<lj-embed id=""49""/>

this is a thing I made recently, its clips of me hooooooooooping with a hoop and some bellydancing set to a gorgeous gorgeous song made for me by <lj user=""mssoxx""> who is, lets face it, a bit of a winner. My camera is on a weird angle that makes me look extra wiiiide in the hoop bits but whatever, width is as good as depth yes? AM I RIGHT? So that is what I have been doing lately, learning to bellydance and hoop, and drinking all the tea. Hooping in a corset is awkward, this it truth."

I should be packing! I think of all kinds of crap to do when I *have* to do something! I've dyed my hair, sewn more leaves on my boots, cleaned the bathroom, mixed a custom perfume for Goblyn, cut his fringe, plucked my eyebrows, talked to sexy pirate men on the phone :D mixed old lipsticks together to make a new colour, played guitar, looked up pictures of pan & the green man for my tattoo, brushed the dogs, sat here listening to music, danced to music, lay in the sun and burned myself. HAHA bright pink hair with a red sunburned face looks so bad it's good hahaha like a strawberry clown!

<a href=""http://photobucket.com/"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v16/pinklet/tattooo-1.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket - Video and Image Hosting""></a>

I still want that ring of faeries, around my upper arm. I just love that its all black and solid and they don't have faces and they just seem, a bit evil, spikey haired, dancy and ...um... gender-less? haha THEY SO WOULDNT CARE WHAT YOU THINK KTHNX! Which I guess I want, also their wings are skeletal and veiny and they are from my old old book of Peter Pan and Wendy which helped my obsession.

I also want my favourite quote
 ""while green leaves glisten and while bright stars burn"" 
that's a sort of pledge I suppose, to... I'm not sure but if I was religious it would be all about stars and leaves. Well I AM religious and it is all about stars and leaves :D Its also a reminder of like....hope and potential, as long as green leaves glisten and bright stars burn, yes which is me because I am insanely optimistic about everything and I hope I stay this way.

I sort of want that in a nice, curly but ordinary looking handwriting, like it wasnt really intentional, like I wrote it on my arm, but then I want some little autumn leaves, curly vines and stars with it.

<lj-cut text=""more tattoooooos"">

I also need the poision faeries and mushrooms by Liselotte! I am so hesitant about that because... how will they get it right? They WON'T BE LISIS! That is the one I will need the fanciest, bestest artist for. I also want loads more Liselotte, Johanna and Brian Froud pictures but if I try to decide I start to hyperventilate!

As you know *strokes moustache* I quite like teh manliness. Im very girly on the surface but I have a deep thing with male energy, *lascivious wink* 
when I was really witchy I LOVED PAN! OH MY GOD LITERALLY! PAN! GO THE GOD OF THE WOODLANDS! Cernunos, all of them, everything, I'm a man-godloving child! I would be on Oberon's side for shore ;D Rah! Horns, hooves, and just sort of you know... testosterone. GIVE ME THE YANG! NO YING! WE HATES THE YING!
And *whispers* I hardly cared at all for the goddess! OMG! I'm sure she understands, I will probably go all goddessy when I'm older... maybe. I'm just not a womanly woman, I'm a thing. And Anyway I want something all Pan or Green man but I CANT DECIDE ON ONE, EVER!
So anyway, I explained that craply, I guess I'll find one when the time is right... ripe?

Also, I need some kind of skeleton dealy... like a day of the dead type/skellington dancing one but it'll be like...a hedgehog or a lobster or something!

THEN! When I saw the new narnia movie I was kind of un-in-love? And its easy to make me love things! Put in a few trees, some tinkly music, shiny armour, fauns and polar bears and I'm YOURS BABY, but for some reason, there was no love.

Except for the scene when Tummnus goes kind of evil with his pipes and fireplace and that rockin faun music comes on. The shadowy fauns in the fire! I want them! As tattoos! Sillhouetty ones! I have been waiting ever since I saw it, to screencap those fauns and attack a tattoo artist with them.

Then of course there will need to be something maritime, ships, pirates or doomed sailors etc. Maybe an anchor with some lyrics from ""Cabin Fever"" By nick & teh seeds of badness! Hehe

Also, I dare myself to get something Stevey.... maybe the word crikey on my foot or something hehe just a tiny tribute. *doesnt care what you think* :P

I'll force myself to get at least one of them done on my birthday! 5th of December! So I have a bit of time to save up *rubs hands* I just procrastinate! I already know who I want to do it, he did a gorgeous crisp black black tattoo on my friend Kezia and he was just good and had an excellent vibe. And in the place there was a sign saying ""YES WE DO TATTOO REMOVAL"" With ...... A huge CHAINSAW attached to it! <3 AAHH! LOVE! SO GOOD! HEEEE!

I'd never narrow that down. No-one could, not even Mr Narrowdown of the Narrow Downs. Actually, Pear and Capricorn are in the lead as of this moment.
I need them all though! Then I'd have to become a ...biker or something. YAY! Oh! There are bikers around here that ride through the foresty roads all the time and then go to the posh touristy cafes *loves them* FOREST BIKERS AT POSH CAFES!

I'm so fucking sad. I don't have the words, I loved him SOOOOOO much! I was always just so glad of him being there, doing his thing for conservation. Best. Guy. Ever. Iv'e never been this sad over the death of a ""celebrity"" it felt like someone I knew, I really really loved him. And I'm so grateful I heard from a friend and not the tv or something. I feel really really strange. And shaky. I'm going to watch the special on him tonight and cry lots more.

I have no idea, he's always been one of my biggest heros. I remember when I was like... four or something really young I was obsessed with the Cradle of Love and when the video clip came on my dad was all ""ooooh, this is a bit grown up for you I think"" and used to turn it off. And I was like AAAAAARGH! Give it back! So that would have made me rebellious I'm sure. But seriously how cool is Billy Idol? TEH COOLEST. He's so boppy and yet at the same time he's rawrrrrrwr! His guitarist and fashion sense also own my soul.

<b> What is your favorite song by 9?:</b>
Bully Boys or Fidgety Phil. Make decisions I cannot.

<b>Who is your favorite band member in 12?:</b>
Duh...

<b>What is a good memory concerning 4?:</b>
Probably laughing at the video clip for Stick Together when I was little. PROFOUND!

<b>Is there a song by 3 that makes you sad?:</b>
Sabrina! But its a kind of *OMG Blixa! Marry me* sadness. Not really, I keep getting not very sad results for these despite the fact that most things in minor keys will make me blubber! :D

<b>What is your favorite song of 1?:</b>
Achilles Last Stand (today)

<b>How did you become a fan of 3?:</b>
I became obsessed with CNS from hearing it played at a club. But also the video for ""the weeping song"" made me go *OMFG BLIXA* and then I researched him :)

<b>Which of the 12 has influenced you the most??:</b>
""I drove all nigh""t probably, its my favourite anyway. It cant have influenced me that much because I dont drive lolz111

<b>Which artist makes you the most happy??:</b>
Probably Caprice, I listen to them while looking around at the pastoral landscape and go ""eeeeeeh"" hehe But I think Oingo Boingo make me bouncier than anything ever has before.

<b>Which artist makes you the most sad?:</b>
Brendan Perry.

<b>Which artist makes the best dance music?:</b>
I dance alot to Robots In Disguise or Oingo Boingo. I often stub my toe to them.

<b>Which artist have you liked the longest?:</b>
Led Zeppelin. I was just born with a love for them haha and it only gets worse every day. Jimmy Page and Bonzo are my especial faves. But Robert Plant is such a faerie man! I have a pin of their symbol on my jacket and I nearly died when I almost lost it haha.  I used to sing & play guitar in a band and we mostly played zeppelin songs and at band practice we would sit around watching the Unplugged No Quarter hehe. I also have more pictures of Jimmy Page on my computer than I care to reveal. And I have a dreadful feeling I will never get to see Jimmy or Robert live. I think the last time they came to Australia I was 7 or something? The bastards. 

<b>Which artist have you liked the shortest?:</b>
Oingo Boingo. Lisis's fault (I think originally Tim's) thankyou you penguins-in-leather-pants!  I love Danny Elfman soundtracks (who doesnt) but nghgnnnnnnnnnng WHAT was I thinking not knowing! When I was fifteen I was all ""Hmm Jack Skellington has a voice like a slightly evil, hot music teacher that you fall in love with/lust after"" and haha that is so what he is! My biggest obsession at the moment,  (apart from marmalade but thats very boring) and one I know is not going away. I annoy people about them/Danny so much! I watch all the extras on Tim Burton films and squee! And I heard him singing something on the Simpsons and turned into a banana from the joy! So angry and happy and evil and and insane and clever and sarcastic and VOICE and GLEE and BEST music. New guitarist/s to love now also.

<b>Are there any artists you will still be listening to in 20 years?:</b>
I dont think I will ever get new taste in music :D"

I need for people to talk about anchor earrings and how to make your velvet coat look like you've been wearing it daily for seventeen years! And where do we find the best piratey stuff online? Pirate DIY & customization. ETC, everything  except auction ads, God I hate auction ads!

Sang softly to me
Follow my voice
Wherever it leads

Through mountains and valleys
And deep rolling seas
Born on the wings of the breeze

Spin me a dream
Woven silver and gold
Of sunshine and shadows
And days long ago

Where people are memories
And stories unfold
Willows, the tales you have told me

Wind in the Willows
You just seem to know
Who you can turn to
And which way to go
To unwind your wondrous mind

Wind in the Willows
Take me home.</center>


on a silleh note! Rita Skeeter is totally my new wife. I'm obsessed with beetles anyway! And she can turn into one. And she has... acid green things. Acid green! And she's played by my beloved Miranda!

The other morning (when I say morning I mean like.. 4:30) Goblyn opened the door and was saying things like ""Quick! Come and look at it!"" And there shined a shiny poppy in the middle of the garden.

And we said... ""Where is the camera?""

It was my poppy that I put in the ground when it wasnt happy in its shop-pot!

It was redder than the reddest thing this place has ever seen. I'm so glad we took photos because there followed a great storm of thrashing bashing winds and bone chillin' rains! 
<i>Oh the wind was lashing lustily
And the trees were thrashing thrustily
And the leaves were rustling gustily<i/>

Next day the poppy was flattened and soggy and blobby :(

"event","<i>By 1897, Barrie's reputation as a novelist and playwright was firmly established on both sides of the Atlantic. He had married the actress Mary Ansell in 1894, and although they had no children, Barrie already numbered several among his intimates. An early child-friend was the poet W E Henly's four-year-old daughter Margaret, who referred to Barrie as ""my friendy"". This coyness was compounded by a fashionable inability to pronounce her r's, and the word came out as ""fwendy"" or ""wendy"". Margaret died when she was six, but Barrie immortalized her in Peter Pan by christening his heroine Wendy, thus creating a new name.</i>

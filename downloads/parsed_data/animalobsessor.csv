"event","I'm burning the candle at both ends
While holding it under water
I'm looking with tunnel vision and
I'm bleeding to make this all worthwhile

I know it seems to never end
This way I've made it in

Repeating, Repeating
I'm burnt out, burnt out
On everything
Repeating over again
Burn out, burnt out on everything
Will this end?

I want to be honest but I can't
I tell you that everything is all right
I'm looking for time to find myself
With all of this madness in my life

I know it seems to never end
This way I've made it in

Repeating, Repeating
I'm burnt out, burnt out
On everything
Repeating over again
Burn out, burnt out on everything
Will this end?

"event","I hurt myself today 
To see if I still feel 
I focus on the pain 
The only thing that's real 
The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting 
Try to kill it all away 
But I remember everything 

What have I become 
My sweetest friend 
Everyone I know goes away 
In the end 
And you could have it all 
My empire of dirt 
I will let you down 
I will make you hurt 

I wear this crown of thorns 
Upon my liar's chair 
Full of broken thoughts 
I cannot repair 
Beneath the stains of time 
The feelings disappear 
You are someone else 
I am still right here 

What have I become 
My sweetest friend 
Everyone I know goes away 
In the end 
And you could have it all 
My empire of dirt 
I will let you down 
I will make you hurt 

If I could start again 
A million miles away 
I would keep myself 
I would find a way"

"event","i just got back from seeing hostel with jessica. that movie was seriously disturbing. i definitely would not see that movie again, it was just too creepy.that crap could actually happen so that makes it 10 times worse. it was nice catching up with jessica though. we had some starbs and taco bell.it was so good.oh ya while we were walking to the movie we saw this lady on the ground handcuffed with 2 cops holding her down. one of the cops was holding a freakin stunn gun that he apparently used. it was insane and we were kind of afraid cuz some random lady was getting arrested. that was pretty much my fun-filled night"

"event","Sparky your in a better place im sure well at least i hope.At least your not in any pain which is good.We put you out of your misery so you would finally feel better...we couldnt be selfish by trying to keep you here for longer.It was for the best.You'll always know how much we loved you and it wasnt an easy decision on whether to give you medication to see if you lets would be ok or if we should just put you out of your pain.I think we picked the right choice for you.Even though its killing me it was still the right thing to do for you.You deserved to be out of your pain and we couldnt keep you alive just for us.I really hope that it wasnt painful for you to die.I dont think it was but i just really hope it wasnt.It was horrible for me to watch your legs and arms to move while you were passing on.It was horrible when i close my eyes thats what i see your muscles relaxing and your bladder emptying.I cant get it out of my head, you were my brother and best friend.Im gonna miss you so much but you'll always be around,in our heart and memories and in the urn.I want to put it on the refrigerator but dad says no so you'll probably go in the garage where you always were.Im just really going to miss you and no matter how old i am i'll always remember you.You were my first dog and you made my love for animals stronger.I love you Sparky and i'll never forget you.

your sister,
Katrina"

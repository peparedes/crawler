"event","ok, on monday i was woken up at 8 so that we could go to help the first little pggy build his house, and god damn, straw is annoying, and we werent allowed to eat any meat, and buuuuhhhhh...

ok, so my dad and i really went to my aunt and uncles place, where they are building a straw bale house. it is off the grid, so they are going to have solar powered heating and all this other crazy stuff. anyways, straw bales are about 40-60 lbs, and my skin reacts to it, so i had to wear a long sleeve shirt, this wasnt bad on the first day, during which it was over cast, and then rained, during which my uncle, was in denile the whole time. the next day the long sleeve shirt was horrible because it was so hot.

over the two days we were there, quite alot was done, and it looks like it will be very nice when finished. and now i have an excuse as to why i dont want to do anything today.  and listening to the to the boss, tom petty and the heartbreakers, the stones and rod stewart in the car was pretty good too, and my dad and i pulled into toronto jus in time to hear side 1 of in through the out door by led zepplin. over all it was really fun, and i think i might convince my dad that i need to go up there with cor and dan on a friday  for the rest of the weekend sometime to help this fall...mmmm school skippin, the only skipping im good at"

ok, so last night i finally got to sleep in my lengthened bed, which was very comfortable, and i got about 13 hours of sleep...mmmmmm sleep. i then had to move around all the furniture in quite a few rooms, because my mom is crazy..and..ill leave it at that. and she had to pick the worst day this summer, it was so god damned humid, and, god dammit. oh well, im probably going to go to peterborough to help build a house this weekend, its a crazy straw bail? bale? monkey? meh, and it is solar powered, and all that stuff.

oh, and notice the awsome icon that dandelion made for me? and beau, yes it is true, you cant deny it till you've tried everything, and i havent, so be just accept it

"event","well tonigt we went to ""classic albums live""'s preformance of back in black. this was very cool, and i really wish that i was 19 so that i could go to see them put on ""physical grafitti"" by led zepplin, and then the next day hop[ in a car and go up to owen sound and seethem do Dark Side of the Moon, and the bes of theWall, and then stay for alice cooper kim mitchell steppenwolf, CCR, joe walsh, and allthe other bands that are preforming at the great lakes jam. but im not, so i will have to mope around here all weekend,or go to coreys, or take over the world, or maybe go see ""just Alice"" an Alice Cooper tribute band...meh, ill think of something to take up mytime, maybe some of the guitar stuff that peter gave me (thank you)

but aabout C.A.L. they are really good, and even if they arent the real thing, for ten bucks, ithought it was really worth it, they were all incredibly talented, and the singer was really good at imitating bon scott. the guitarists were spectacular, and one of them had to learn Big Balls on the spot, and did pretty well. id suggest that we go on wednesday the first to see them do the Beatle's white album, because although it would be easier to get together on thursday, this really would be worth it."

some day(i dont pay attention to the days of the week during summer) ok, so there were 5 of us playing risk, and talking about random things, and laughing and generally having a good time, well i was kinda completely out of it though, so i went outside for some fresh air. this didnt help at all, so i got my pot and went down stairs, and had to use it, later i spent about half an hour trying to get the taste my acid out of my mouth. at about 1 in the morning we all raided the kitchen for food because we were so hungry, and then finished our risk game.

first part : we aer a bunch of guys having fun, and most of the horde has the same sense of humour as i do, and we are all very random

i was ""out of it"" because i was sick, and when you are sick you dont usually feel that great, and sometimes you feel delirious, so i went outside

i got my pot, or A pot, which i used, so that means i used a pot, and since i was sick, ill let you fill in the rest of that

after that i had acid in my mouth, try and guess what from??? yes it has to do with using the pot

we all raided the kitchen for food because we had eaten 6 hours ago, that is a pretty good interval for a meal? isnt it?

there now that that is sorted out, Shrek 2 is an awsome movie, and i am really going to have to see it again."

the next day: david, a kind of stupid kid, made some banana bread, and when we ate it that night, we all bcause very paranoid, everyone saw some weird white old man run silently past the windows, and spent the next three hours weilding bats and our bamboo lightsabers, so that if anything came through the doors tha kept on swinging open and closed would be beaten to death. this only got worse with more banana bread, so we think david made some hash banana bread, but that was okay, cos we all slept on the floor in one room and were safe.

now, if anyone can guess what happened on the day dubbed some day, will get a prize, what really happened, it is all in there, jus you may be a bit confused by the words"

we are almost finished painting my friends house, but wont finish it before we go to his cottage on friday, so i will still have some way of earning money for at least a few days after i get back. no that i really need it, but it is still nice to have.

and i have finally found a christian prayer worth saying:

""And Shepherds we shall be

For thee, my Lord, for thee.

Power hath descended forth from Thy hand

Our feet may swiftly carry out Thy commands.

So we shall flow a river forth to Thee

And teeming with souls shall it ever be.

In Nomeni Patri Et Fili Spiritus Sancti.""

"event","well on saturday we wroked for about 5 hours on my friends house and tired ourselves out completely, but it was all worth it, because on sunday we got to go to wonderland, and that was amazingly fun. sadly, we didnt get to go onto the best ride there, which  of course is the lazy river, but going on the roller coasters was really fun, and thanks to tomb raider, Top Gun had a really short line. when we got back, we got pizza and then went to Harold and Kumar go to white castle. this is by far the best movie out there, and is so goddamn funny, that we were laughing at it during the patriot, which we watched when we got back, and by we i mean 3 lazy good for nothing 18 yearolds who wont get their licenses, myself, my friend corey, and my brother.

with these friends (a major part of the Horde) we generally have discussions about stuff, one of the topics that came up was whether pink floyd was popular, and if there hadent been 4 of us squished into one seat, i deefinitly would have had to beat the moron  who wouldnt agree with us that they were. some other topics were actual important stimulating things, but we dont remember any of the conclusions, so it doesnt ,matter.

and today i got a quintet called the bulgariade (sp?) and luckily when i went into the used book shop, the whole thing had come in that morning. mmmm books, this series was suggested by my friends  friend who used to be a goth, so im kinda wondering about it. oh well, they read a whole bunch of other great books so it should be good

and a whie ago i took one of those tests, and it said i was paranoid, i thought it was bullshit, but now as i have been sleeping at my friends house, i have been scared of going to sleep, and i cant sleep cos clowns will eat me, and if you think this cant be reall, i'll show you wounds that never heal ,it happens to me everynight, they always wanna take a bite..."

last night was really the start, but i thought i was going home today, oh well doesnt matter much. as some of you may have guessed, i watched rocky horrer picture show over at my friends, and now he too has been scarred for life. and since it was a double feature, we also watched ""dazed and confused"" damnm good movie, with great music, and no plot line, and a whole lot of laughing at drunks and stoners. i suggest everyone see it because it is very funny, and dont be put off by the R rating, it will usually also have a 14A rating because all the pot isnt so illegal anymore, and ya... i especially suggest beau, peter and katherine see it because they seem to be depressed during the summer of all things, and beau needs a conversion to classic rock"

"event","ok, so i am going to sum up everything since last thursday, here goes...

on thuRsday i had to work for a few hours with a friend, and then came home, and katherine and corey came over and ate food, and the we went to ALICE COOPER, the Edgar Winter band opened up, and the music wasnt that bad, but it was too loud, and you could hear him singing, so that wasnt that good, the next act was Foghat, and they were very good, and then there was Alice. the music was great, and he had his baton, and a sword, and of course his python, and there was a painting of eyes in the back ground that lights shone through, which looked really cool. we stood for the whole thing, which was fine with me, but the kid in front of us didnt like it much, oh well. the whole thing was really cool to see, and Alices energy was really high, which is surprising for someone who is like 60. there was alot of smoking which i thought was odd, because they searched really hard for any liquor, and even checked my ankles for it (stereotyping basterds)we all got back at about 12, and i got to sleep at about 2.

fRiday: we packed up the car, picked up my friend Corey, and went to Guelph to the Hillside Music Fest, we set up camp, and then got to the actual hillside place in time to hear some mediocore punk and rock bands, and then some other guitar players, and we played cards and generally had a good time. At 10, a Band called Metric came onto the main stage, and everyone went up to the very edge. they were very good, and the singer had alot of energy, and she got everyone up, even the adults in the back. then we went back and sat around the camp fire for a few hours with a bunch of other people, and since the person who had set up the area for us to camp in, has seen Bruce Sprigsteen about 40 times, and even registered the site under ""the E-Street Band"" we csang alot of Springsteen songs, and the kids were finally sent into our tents at 2:30

satuRday: got up at about noon, and went to listen to more music at Hillside, there was a really cool English guy who used to be a sword swallower, , and all this other cool stuff, and some guy called Andy Stochansky (sp?) and some band called (Pilate) at 10, they were pretty good, and everyone gathered up at the stage again. we spent about 3 hours at the ire again that night, and had some warm wine that the drunk adults left there. around the fire we told our deepest darkest secrets, mine was the fact that i used to be Satan, turned into Dr.Frankenfuter, had therapy, and had taken up my old postition and that the car lights were actually me gotas from hell

sunday: an amazing breakfast, almost a buffet, but set up in a camp site, then we went and heeard some more music at hillside, like the Arrogant Worms, and then we went back and packed up and left at 6, and got back at 7 30, and went to a going away party next door, alll in all, i had a great weekend, and i have to say, music is the only thing keeping me tinking in any sort of pattern in the realm of sensibility

and you may have noticed that the days have thier R's capitilized, this is because i only smelled like drugs on days that include R's. i dont like R anymore, i  think i may have to kill it. and one other thing, peter, you really shoudl have just gotten to know the girls that were bothering you when you were camping, it really is more fun."

"event","well today has been rather boring, as has most of the days since my last update, dont even remember what it was, meh, i have been reading some very odd books, the series otherland by Tad williams was pretty good, then iread Dark Age Ahead by jane jacobs, that was slightly disturbing, but what ya gonna do? and now my mom has me reading a people's history of the united states by howard Zinn, hes kinda like Michael Moore, but doesnt make so many allusions, or lead anyone on to certain things, but it really is a different perspective than what you normally read/hear about. i have also found that i should go to sleep earlier and not read so late, because i have alot of times where i have head rushes, and i havent been able to see a couple of times, and i laugh at pretty much everything, like ribbits, ahahaha ribbits....if you dont get it, dont worry, it takes too long to explain, if you do get it...well i guess you wil just have to shine on you crazy diamond"

"event","yesterday, my brother woke up with his nose guching blood, so i didnt get to wake him up by playing his birthday CD (feedback, by rush), but when i did, he liked it alot, then we jammed for an hour, and at about noon, his pld teacher for 5 years came over, and we had lunch (knida odd, but she is really nice, and we got to eat the cake i made, and it was very good) i had to go work for an hour at my friends, and then rush of to some other place for my brothers birthday dinner (it just wouldnt go away). this was very good, nad the desert was some sort of ice cream pie, with the crust being rice crispie squareish.

we went to his soccer game, where the game was only played on one half of the field, so for one half, the other team was kicking ass, then my brothers team started doing well, but he lost, and since his godmother is obsessed with the native americans and their rituals, we left him there, and will go yo pick him up in a few weeks j/k

last night, or this morning you might say, i was listening to the radio, and reading my book, i got pissed off at something that had gotten stuck in my brothers fan, i went in to see what it was,almost right after i turned on the light, a massive read ruch kicked in, the worst i have had to date, and im pretty sure i experienced what a blind person sees, or doesnt, however you want to look at it, it was pretty disturbing

i also found out that i am insane by elimination, on the radio, the DJ was describing his audience : students up studying (i never study, and it isnt school, thats not me), people working the night shift (im too lazy to get a real day job, no way in hell ill get a night one), truckers (cant drive), the police (the polie wouldnt accept me, those basterds, they cont like the long hair either), people having sex (im fifteen, i dont that'll be happening for a while), insomniacs (i get lots of sleep, mmmmm...sleep) and the insane (since there is nothing to say im not insane, this means i am) and anyone who bothered to read this probably is too whoo hoo, rock on you crazy diamonds!!!!!"

"event","ok, i havent updated, because i wasnt bored enough to, but now i will. a couple of days ago, i babysat 4 kids with my brother, they wer ages 3-8, my brother had the good idea of giving these kids gum(not that good an idea because the 3 year old dropped it out of his mouth about 8 times, and would put it back in. well then my brother had the good idea of pretending to put gum up his nose, (where you put it up the side that the people cant see. the kids thought that it was hilarious, but for somereason they thought that he had actually done it, and then the 3 year old and the 5 year old actually did put theirs in their nose (note to self, little kids are very impresionable).

and its my brothers birthday to day, and i am being kicked off the comp now, so i may update about that experience later..."

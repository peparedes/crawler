   Caspartame is the ghost of a kitten.  I do not remember exactly how he came about, but it was in a conversation with Pixelmatt...  he was talking about ghosts and their being cute.. then it moved into ghosts of kittens being cuter..  then I drew a picture of a ghost kitten.  I named it Caspartame because Casper is a ghost and Aspartame is sweet and artificial.. like a ghost..  and a kitten?  Kittens are not fake, but they are sweet.  
    cannot master the purl."

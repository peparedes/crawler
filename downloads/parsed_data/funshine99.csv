"event","Welll today was a long day. I woke up at 7:15am and had pancakes for breakfast. :) Then at 9:20 mom, dad, dani and I left to go to Georgetown. At Georgetown we rode a train. I hate trains. A long time ago mom and dad took dani and I on a train ride. The ride to the place was 3 hours. You had to stay at the place for 3 hours, and the ride back was well...guess, 3 hours. A 9 hour train ride. I was about 5 pr 6 and I couldn't really take it anymore. But today wasn't so bad. It was only 1 hour long. So much better then 9 hours! lol. Then after the train we drove up to Wyoming, which is a state above us...Colorado. We drove up there to get fireworks for 4th of July. That was fun. A ton and ton of fireworks. Well then we came home and I didn't really do anything. Tomorrow I might go see a movie with a friend. And on Friday, I'm going to a birthday party and then Saturday morning mom, dad, dani and i are leaving to go to Fowler. It's about 3 1/2 hours away. Stay there Saturday...and I know that ALL the kids are probably going to have to sleep outside. But I don't mind. I mean we will probably stay up late. Then we are leavingon Sunday which is 4th of July to come back home. See my family is celebrating 4th of July on Saturday nght instead. We are bringing home 2 of my cousins. Morgan and Mason. They are staying with us for a couple of day and then going home. I can't wait. This year will be fun. Well I gtg. I have stuff to do!

Smile...you'll live longer! Love ya!

"event","Well I don't really know what to do. :( Mom and I went to Mervyn's today and i got a new backpack, but i don't know if I'm going to be keeping it, cuz I think that I will be able to find a backpack like the one i have now, but in better ways that I like it. I found a really cute shirt that i wanted to get, but they didn't have it in my size. :( Then mom and i went to wash the car. Boring like always. I don't see what is wrong with washing a car in the drive way! lol. Well mom and i then went to Bath and Bodyworks. It was a big sale, 75% off. I got smelly stuff (2 things of smelly stuff) O yes, my aunt came by today and then left. She just came by to say hi and chat with my mom like they always do. Well the baby birds in our backyard are being pretty boring, but they were just born a few days ago. Or many days ago. Their eyes are starting to open! :) I had Taco Bell for lunch. It tasted so good since I haven't had Taco Bell FOREVER! I love Taco Bell. We need one close to us, but no...they just can't build one here I guess because after 5 years of living here, still no Taco Bell! :( Well today my friend signed off of AIM on my for NO REASON. I think that she is mad at me! GRRR! Well she ALWAYS is. I don't know what to do! She is very annoying and is bugging me SO much. I hope that she never finds out about this! Well anyway. She is still my best friend. So...when she is mad at me...I'm use to it. What else to say. Well it is soon Forth of July and my family and i are going up to Wyoming tomorrow to buy fireworks! I love fireworks. How much fun! Well at the moment i have nothing else to say, so i think I'll go.

Maybe I'll work on my scarpbook. :S I don't know. 

See ya lata! And remember...Smile...you'll live longer! lol

"event","Hey, well right now I'm VERY bored. I don't know what to do! I have watched TV and now there is nothing to do but sit in a chair and stare at the computer screen. Well soon mom and I are going to be going to Wal*Mart. I need some stuff and so does she. I might look for something fun, I got $20 this morning for cleaning up some of the house. And on Thursday i got $15 from my aunt for mowing  her HUGE yard. Well during the time i was updating, which i'm so sry for!, I got a cute new HOT PINK purse, which is so cute! I love it. I'm not a girly girl, I'm a sporty girl, but anyway I just like the color pink. It is such a cool color! I went to the Outlet Mall in Castle Rock and got a pink ring and a star anklet. The pink ring matches wiht 2 of my GREAT friends, Melissa and Kristen. Well after the Outlet Mall Missy (aka:Melissa), Kristen and I went to go see Dodgeball. A great funny movie. I also seen The Stepford Wives and Around the World in 80 days. There are 4 little hatched baby birds in our backyard. They are little fuz fuz. I don't really like birds (Humming birds are my worst fear!) but the babies are cute. Genae and I got into this HUGE fight, but then we made up and Walked up the street to a pizza place in our PJ's. That was a lot of fun. Then I spent the night a went home the next day. Well I would like to say something to my aunt Cheri, who just had to put down her doggie, Turmen. 

Cheri...I'm so sorry about what happened to Trumen. Trumen the bulldog! But it was probably for the best. I hope that you can come to dinner with us tomorrow night. It will probably help you get your mind off of Trumen. Trumen was one of a kind. A mean dog to people he didn't really know, but so sweet to you. And finally after many years he got use to me to and I could pet him and scrat him behind the ears. I feel like I reached a goal. To have Trumen except me. :) Turmen was a great dog and didn't act like his age. He loves to play with his toys and acted like a puppy at the age 10. I love you Tru and Cheri I love you too!

Well i don't really have anything else to say. If anybody would like to comment plz do. :) 

Lots of Love!

I just got cable. We had to wait to get it. We had to put in the outlet and everything. Ok...the weather here is well bad for June. The sun really hasn't shined for a couple hours in 8 days. It has been cold and rainy here. Not really June weather. Agree? Wel Happy Fathers Day! Even though it's kind of late! :( Well today Mom and I went to Wal*Mart and I started the pix from my trip. I had the CD's, but I wanted the regular type of pix for my scrapbook. They took an hour, but mom and I left and decided to come back lata.  At Wal*Mart I found the cutest purse, but I didn't have enough money so I couldn't get it. It was the right size and was hot pink. Pink is a cute color. We also bought dog beds for our pups. Elvis LOVES his. Jade likes hers, but I don't know if she likes it as mcuh. lol. Next mom and I went to Hobby Lobby to get scarpbooking stuff. I got so cute stuff! I got a ton of things to do my scarpbook with. I can't wait to get home to start on it. Well Mom and I went home to get my sister, Dani. Which was with my dad and we went back to Wal*Mart to pick up my pix and I had money to buy my purse! YES! I love it so much! I came home and started to work on my scarpbook. I got 6 pages done, but I didn't glue anything down, in caseI want to change them around. Well That is all I have to say for today. Till tomorrow...I love ya!

I called every day to talk to my family and I loved talking to them. Each show was great, but Spirit of the Dance was probably my least favorite, but the show was still good. Genae and I stayed with G.L. and Shirlene, which are so nice. Genae and I got the whole basement. It was great! They were so nice. 

Silver Dollar City was so much fun. It was great! My favorite ride was the Wild Fire, it was a huge roller coaster and I loved it cuz I love roller coasters, they are so much fun! YEAH! 

As you know...well maybe you don't. (lol) Branson is in Missouri, and well I live in Colorado. So it was a long drive to there. OMG! One day we drove 7 hours! To long to be in the car. 

Well I gtg. I still have to up pack! Bye!

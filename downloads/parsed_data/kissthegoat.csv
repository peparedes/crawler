"event","Freedom has come at unfathomable costs.  Since the first ships arrived on the shores, there have been an uncountable number of events that have led up to this very moment.  A lot of events documented, or at least still existent within the history of 'western civilization,' but a lot of them have been either completely disregarded, or simply changed to make a much better story to tell the kids.  Clearly I cannot verify that as fact, but logic tells you it happened, and on more than one occasion.

Now on to the point.  At first, our civilization was established in a way that is more than deplorable.  Everyday we disregard blatant facts, that stare us directly in the face.  Maybe not literally, per se, but the facts are there it's all about how you see it.  We built our early civilization on small wars with the people that naturally owned this land, we murdered, raped, and slaughtered them, we destroyed their food supplies, means of warmth, and housing, and all for what?  Simply put, GREED.  You can take your pretentious, and fabricated of ""Thanksgiving"" and shove it up your ass, because when you sit down at the table to eat your food, the last thing you're thinking about is the poor people that were murdered, and now shoved onto reservations, doing slave work no one else will do any more, getting paid shit money, with only the advantage of making casino money, as if that's any consolation.

Next, you have to think about our Revolutionary War.  Now if you understand my sentiments above, you will realize why I speak of this the way I do.  Otherwise, you're just simply an idiot.  Anyhow, our Revolutionary War started with both acts of treason, and acts of terrorism.  One can argue that these acts were not treason, or terrorism, but by definition, they were, revolution or not.  Our country was under the reign of Britain, whose royalty was our acting government.  Settlers were fed up with taking shit from people that didn't even inhabit the land, and so they began revolting, which in turn, started a full blown war.  However, as much as it is depicted with the Revolutionary Soldiers standing on one side, and the ""Red Coats"" (British/English) on the other.  It's not to say this didn't happen, but if you'd actually look further into the facts, and writings from people at the time, you will notice that this was not always fact.  But in reality, there were plenty of instances, including a specific battle in New Jersey, where ""American"" soldiers would actually sneak up at night, and visciously kill British soldiers while they slept, or least expected it.  At least from the specific one in mind, these attacks were strategically premeditated, and for the time, acts of terrorism.  The same acts we condemn, are a large part of the birth of our country, and yet since ""the past is the past"" we repress that, and ignore it, while we become completely hipocritical, and arrogant, speaking outward in complete outrage.  Is it all of the above? Yes.  But to come off as though these same, but less modern acts, were acceptable at a time where our biggest problem was a fucking TEA TAX.  Sure there was more to it than that, but one of the most notable events was a revolt on a tea tax.  Now as this proves further how just hipocritical our government is, upon winning the Revolutionary War no more than two years later were there Tax collectors walking door to door collecting income taxes, and property taxes from the citizens.

Now here I have to ask, was it really the issues with PAYING the taxes, or was it really that it was such a great idea, they wished they had thought of it first? Or moreso that they just wanted a piece of the action?  Not to mention the notable quote in our Declaration Of Independance, which simply says ""The best government, is a government which governs least.""  Yet thinking of that today, i'd think we don't quite have the government he had in mind at the time.  But hey, maybe I'm just being American and completely misinterpreting plain english.  I suppose that's what happens when you allow your government to get away with using twists on words to falsely portray things, and mislead you into believing something completely different than what is actual fact.  

So then, a hundred or so years later, we had the industrial revolution.  For the first time in history, human beings themselves had actually become a commodity.  We put a pricetag on peoples work efforts, and basically bought their work for next to nothing in most cases.  This is where everything took a turn for the worst.  We developed an economy, which sooner than later, would basically become the basis for everything.  If the economy does bad, everyone does bad, except for the people whom sit atop of it all.  Yeah, they're doing bad.  But only making 6 billion dollars a week, instead of 30 billion in the oil industry (speaking of the time) I wouldn't really consider to be the biggest hit when you're sitting on more money than all of the people that work(ed) for you combined.  And so, some years later what happens?  A depression occurs, and lasts roughly a decade.  For ten years or so, hard working people struggled, because the economy we thought was so very fit, fell apart almost completely.  As the old saying goes, ""A recession is when someone on your street loses your job, a depression is when you, and your neighbor lose your jobs"" or at least something to that extent.  In a time where people were lucky to make 20 dollars a week, they were suffering inflation prices that we see today.  You can bet your ass there were plenty of children that starved to death, and a lot worse.  But since we were so convinced that a capitalistic society, based almost completely around an economy created by the government, that we, instead of rethinking our decision to do so, thought of a way to make it work.  And so, we've gone 70 years without a depression.  But have skipped across the top with quite a number of recessions, one of which we're still hovering above at this very moment.  Now, with our wonderful idea of an economy, and the technological advancements of the 90's, the flood of new E-markets, and computer technology on the rise, everywhere, we have become very much reliant on the success of these things.  So in order to keep things going, we promote consumerism, which in turn has created a severe crisis of materialism, and again, in turn, has created a society that is more worried about what they want materially, instead of what they want governmentally, and most importantly.  So many people have begun to ignore politics, and government, because they have had so many things make their lives ""easier"", that if it's not easy enough to comprehend, than its not worth paying attention to, because we're American, and depth is something we lost a long, long, time ago.

But some people like to take advantage of their freedoms, we have people everyday prancing around the streets using their constitutionally given rights to express themselves, and speak freely of their opinions.  But a lot of these people are under the impression that, just because they have this given right, that their opinions, whether singluarly, or in a group, it should affect everyone.  And alot of these same people, base their beliefs off of the Bible, or some other kind of cult-like religious book.  Besides the fact, religion has absolutely no true place in the political process, who the fuck is supposed to take these people seriously?  You won't oppose your standing government, whose reign has come closer and closer to tyrannical, and oppressive, but you'll oppose something from a book that you can't even prove is actual fact because none of the shit in it actually exists.  Maybe my view on religion is getting in the way here, but regardless, how do you ignore material proof on one thing that is current, but bend over backwards and protest infront of abortion clinics, because some unseen 'GOD' made you believe that this is wrong.  Even if abortion IS wrong, and SHOULD be banned, which it shouldn't, but for fucks sake, lets say thats a fact.  Then how is it that you support war?  How is it that you support a government that has suspectedly used Population Control procedures throughout the past few decades?  If you want to save lives, why are you protesting abortions?  Something tells me HIV/AIDS kills more people a year than abortions do.  Oh wait, is it because you're still under the belief that premarital sex is wrong, and it's a GAY disease?  The same people that preach how great God's morals are, and how all encompassing he is, condemn certain types of people, and stereotype a disease that was aimed specifically at least desireable groups of people as a form of reducing the population so that we do not waste the worlds resources.  Call it a conspiracy theory, or check the facts for yourself AIDS is not some rare disease.  It didn't just magically appear.  According to my limited knowledge, I believe most diseases evolve from others, and so on.  Is it not the least bit ironic that suddenly there was a case of AIDS, then just as suddenly specific groups of people were affected by it?  Contrary to popular belief, homosexual ""sodomy"" doesn't create the AIDS virus or HIV, and is absolutely no different that having anal intercourse with a woman.  Which of course, just further proves my point on the Governmental way of misleading the public with misleading details to further help their own cause.  The same ""hate the sin, love the sinner"" people hating both.

Bottom line is, our society has never been respectable, and the people within it that are, are few and far between.  There is next to nothing that our country has done for anyone but itself, and sadly in a lot of cases people actually enjoy that fact.  Except you forget that, thats why no one likes us, and NO we are not the self-sufficient country you're mislead to think we are.  Something like 85% of our economy relies on IMPORTS from other countries.  If tomorrow everyone said FUCK AMERICA and stopped sending us shit, we'd hit rock bottom within the 24 hour period.  But its not like anyone really wants to stop and think about that when theres new shit at the mall to buy, and 100,000 other things distracting us from the real, disturbing facts.  You can say no one would ever do that, but as long as we keep pushing our ideals on other people, in other countries, we will step closer and closer to that lingering possibility, amongst so many others.

like i said... as everything comes at a cost, so does freedom

..and with freedom, you have the freedom to keep not giving a shit like you've been"

"event","for any man with enough reason, speaks on the behalf of the mute.  his words bring solace to some, and others protest and damage his home, burn crosses in his yard, destroy his vehicle.  just a man; a single man turns an idea to a reality with a hard press from his lips to his fellow man.  his most convincing tone, built with a sentiment that should some day exceed the expectations of his silent brothers.

a single man with a voice may possess more power than the body that governs him.  for it is only his silent counterparts that allow his belief that he is powerless.

our history is a series of events based upon those that refused to accept things for which they stood, and through their natural rights; their birth rights, they used their voice and stood with immovable force upon the grounds which best benefited themselves, or their people.

the hand of one man can close pandora's box, and the breath of another may open its wickedness upon the world.  he who most believes he is powerful enough finds his success in his strength alone and uses it for the greater good of man as a whole, not the individual.  for greed only taints a mans honor, and he soon shall face condemnation to a lonesome world of few; the few, of many that share self-importance, and shall never benefit from the other as their greed will not allow of it.  those that govern most, and ineffectively; that protect themselves and harm others, that consider not the single man, but the individual mind he, himself, owns.

it is not the mind itself, but the individual whose purpose best serves his countrymen.  for it is not for one, but for all we shall live, unless a shallow, blackened heart should be preventing and unwilling.

no man shall die in vain without a name, for a cause unjust in his heart, he may choose to oppose a war and his life be spared by his freedoms, and not his fear of force.  he may still be a hero, to some, and others a cowardly, betrayer.  however, a partriot exists not in a war with a foriegn enemy, but a war with his government sought to be unjust, and insufficient.  for a man shall only die on his own terms, and not by a man whose life is protected by his seat in the government, may it be state, or national.

a man who asks the questions, often never gets his answers, but a man who often gets answers has no questions, as yet again ignorance is bliss"

"event","You better watch what the fuck flies outta ya mouth
Or I'ma hijack a plane and fly it into your house
Burn your apartment with your family tied to the couch
And slit your throat, so when you scream, only blood comes out
I doubt that there could ever be...a more wicked MC
'Cuz AIDs infested child molesters aren't sicker than me
I see the world for what it is, beyond the white and the black
The way the government downplays historical facts
'Cuz the United States sponsored the rise of the 3rd Reich
Just like the CIA trained terrorists to the fight
Build bombs and sneak box cutters onto a flight
When I was a child, the Devil himself bought me a mic
But I refused the offer, 'cuz God sent me to strike
With skills unused like fallopian tubes on a dyke
My words'll expose George Bush and Bin Laden
As two separate parts of the same seven headed dragon
And you can't fathom the truth, so you don't hear me
You think illuminati's just a fuckin conspiracy theory?
That's why Conservative racists are all runnin' shit
And your phone is tapped by the Federal Government
So I'm jammin' frequencies in ya brain when you speak to me
Technique will rip a rapper to pieces indecently
Pack weapons illegally, because I'm never hesitant
Sniper scoping a commission controllin the president

Father, forgive them, for they don't know right from wrong
The truth will set you free, written down in this song
And the song has the Cause of Death written in code
The Word of God brought to life, that'll save ya soul..

Save ya soul motherfucker...save ya soul..

Yeah, yeah, yeah


I hacked the Pentagon for self-incriminating evidence
Of Republican manufactured white powder pestilence
Marines Corps. flack vest, with the guns and ammo
Spittin' bars like a demon stuck inside a piano
Turn a Sambo into a soldier with just one line
Now here's the truth about the system that'll fuck up your mind
They gave Al Queda 6 billion dollars in 1989 to 1992
And now the last chapters of Revelations are coming true
And I know a lot of people find it hard to swallow this
Because subliminal bigotry makes you hate my politics



But you act like America wouldn't destroy two buildings
In a country that was sponsoring bombs dropped on our children
I was watching the Towers, and though I wasn't the closest
I saw them crumble to the Earth like they was full of explosives
And they thought nobody noticed the news report that they did
About the bombs planted on the George Washington bridge
Four Non-Arabs arrested during the emergency
And then it disappeared from the news permanently
They dubbed a tape of Osama, and they said it was proof
""Jealous of our freedom,"" I can't believe you bought that excuse
Rockin a motherfucking flag don't make you a hero
Word to Ground Zero
The Devil crept into Heaven, God overslept on the 7th
The New World Order was born on September 11

And just so Conservatives don't take it to heart
I don't think Bush did it, 'cuz he isn't that smart
He's just a stupid puppet taking orders on his cell phone
From the same people that sabotaged Senator Wellstone
The military industry got it poppin' and lockin'
Looking for a way to justify the Wolfowitz Doctrine
And as a matter of fact, Rumsfeld, now that I think back
Without 9/11, you couldn't have a war in Iraq
Or a Defense budget of world conquest proportions
Kill freedom of speech and revoke the right to abortions
Tax cut extortion, a blessing to the wealthy and wicked
But you still have to answer to the Armageddon you scripted
And Dick Cheney, you fuckin leech, tell them your plans
About building your pipelines through Afghanistan
And how Israeli troops trained the Taliban in Pakistan
You might have some house niggaz fooled, but I understand
Colonialism is sponsored by corporations
That's why Halliburton gets paid to rebuild nations
Tell me the truth, I don't scare into paralysis
I know the CIA saw Bin Laden on dialysis
In '98 when he was Top Ten for the FBI
Government ties is really why the Government lies
Read it yourself instead of asking the Government why
'Cuz then the Cause of Death will cause the propaganda to die.."

"event","the important issue in everyone's lives right now, regardless of age should be the upcoming election.  that might just be my opinion,  but in all reality this is one of the most crucial in years.  Alot of people have already chosen their vote, and others still bounce back and forth, or just shun it completely.  I don't understand how someone could completely ignore something that effects their lives tremendously from election to election, especially now, more than ever.
My following statements are going to clearly be partisaned,  but they're also based on logic amongst other things besides news reports, bullshit political attack ads, and the past debates.  Because to me the fact this election is as close as it is right now, is fucking MIND BLOWING.  But i think that also proves the persuasion of media over the general american public, aside from our own simple-mindedness and stupidity.

Firstly, I'm going to start with George Bush, because he is still the president, therefore he gets that priority:

Okay, well, I'm going to start from the beginning and move on.  For a statistical fact, upon January 1st, 2000 our countries current state was moderate.  We slightly sloped from the fairly large surplus we acquired during the Clinton term(s), but the shape of the economy, prices of things (oil/gas/cigarettes) were still at a reasonable price.  Bush took office, and things began at first, subtle, but the decline in things was evident.  There was also a ""memo"" from an advisor in the early stages of 2001 on the desk of George W. Bush concerning a possible recession in the oncoming future.  It may have been mid-2001 but the time scale still makes no difference.  (so apply your own mind if you wanna know everything down to the finest detail, i'm going off recollection)  There are however factors to take into consideration.  The change of presidential parties, which both are clearly on opposite sides, and also the slight decline at the point which he first entered office.  Then the occurrance(s) of September 11th which clearly targeted not only our defense center, but also the largest financial building on the east coast.  With the addition of the stock market remaining closed on the following day (weds. the 12th) it caused a dramatic drop in stock values across the board.  The nasdaq suffered its worst losses in it's entire history upon the opening bell of that day.  This put us in a recession almost immediately.  So, aside from the precautionary measures that 'should' have been taken about 9/11 these things were almost out of anyones hands.
-Now to skip aside for a moment to the presidents reaction to september 11th, it was clearly the right thing to do without a doubt.  That is something I would never question nor deny, to this very day.  The swift military action which we took after that was undoubtedly right, and justified.  However, the same motions in which we went from afghanistan to iraq was reckless and by far a terrible mistake.  I wholely support the removal of power from sadaam hussein, but NOT the way in which we did it by any means.  From day one seeing the massive bombings, and then 'shock and awe' an effort that cost the american people hundreds of millions of dollars to more or less resolve nothing but create more problems.  Why?  Because the number of collateral damage far exceeds the recent death toll which was publicly released about US soldier deaths (1,000+).  This fuels the fire even larger.  But now, when we have an economy that has sunk deeper than it has since after the depression in the 1930's.  What justified a clearly overly-aggressive and, in the end, practically pointless effort to bomb in excess a place/city that had nearly no defense against us?  By hitting a recession alone, it almost goes hand in hand with a national debt of a good amount.  So now, by having dumped the billions of dollars that we did into IRAQ, a country that wasn't nearly as responsible with 9/11 compared to afghanistan, iran, syria, and saudi arabia (places which hijackers, and other affiliates were from)  where is any of that justified?  Especially now, when it's been more than proven ALL of our motivations were non-existent.  Just as a reminder, remember: in the beginning it was ""The War On Terror""  and that shortly turned into ""Operation Iraqi Freedom""  as if thats not a clear curve ball thrown by the bush administration.  In other words, a clear cut LIE.  Granted a mission changes after our said ""Success."" But if I recall correctly, we haven't accomplished anything there besides capturing sadaam and still having done absolutely nothing with him.  (Please See:  Ulterior motive for political gain)
We have clearly been mislead by this administration on countless occassions, including a WAR, which I don't think people take into consideration enough of how big that truely is.  We've now lost over 1,000 soldiers, and spent 120 billion dollars that we don't even have (Look up the word: Deficit)  which isn't coming out of anyone elses pockets but our own (being the middleclass).  All these tax cuts Bush has been signing over the past 2-3 years don't mean shit.  Yeah tax breaks are great because for once you're seeing more of your hard earned cash, and I know how it feels to get raped with taxes from check to check.
-But in this instance you have to ask yourself, do you want a tax cut now and have more money?  Or, would you rather have the defecit looked at more seriously, and taken care of appropriately so that our children, and our elders when they become too old aren't suffering the consequences because the matter was handled inappropriately?  I'll put this into perspective a little bit more.  If we don't repair the deficit, it keeps growing, because there is no generation of money to fill the void that has been created.  By cutting taxes basically they are putting all their hopes on the fact that IF people have more money in hand, they will spend more money, THEN it will generate a higher economy which would then begin to repair our (still growing) deficit, and then begin to roll back taxes and try and balance the scale a bit more.  This COULD work, but right now there is nothing productive enough on our own side to fill a void of over 7 trillion dollars (as of october 14th 2004).  This is the largest national debt in the nations history.  Now to be brief, along with a national debt, that means cutting things (which already has happened) such as spending on after school programs.  The same tool used in effort to help and keep children off the streets, and keeping them productive, instead of the other way around.  So just keep that in mind when your parents are voting to for the president whom is clearly hurting us more than he's helping us.  These are just some issues, but its a wide array, if you like bush, you're a fucking idiot.

As for John Kerry.  This is going to be brief, really.  At first I was not passionate about John Kerry, I didn't feel as though he showed enough to be the president of the US being he hadn't much been in the eye of the public as to where he stood out more than just being the democratic candidate.  This however, is based largely on the debates being this was the first times i was able to see him and his proposals directly.  To begin with, he is a well spoken man, which he as to be.  As for the times he spoke vaguely he was taken out of context which turned quickly into republican attack ads.  However, theres something much larger to look at here.  During the debates John Kerry proposed alot of very realistic concepts, and showed beyond a doubt he knew what he wanted to do when he got into the white house.  George Bush however, continued to show that he was simple-minded puppet to his political party.  John Kerry, although I will admit is still partially the same political puppet, he still has insentive, and realistic thoughts.  He presented alot of interesting ideas, and seemed to want to even involve greatly both political parties on acheiving the goals in which he has set for himself to achieve therein.  I've noticed alot of criticism about his plans on certain issues because of whatever conflict.  Such as his ideas of trying to fund a much more appropriate system of medicare.  Bush criticized ""That will costs a billions of dollars, thats unrealistic.""  Possibly true, and very unrealistic at this current point in time.  But what about the 120 billion dollars for iraq, and the additional 80 that will be spread upon it over the next year or however long?  Hmm...we can't afford to spend on medicare, but now we're required by international law to pay reparations for a country we recklessly destroyed under his leadership, which was increased our debt almost beyond the ability to count.  Now how is it one can criticize another on a subject matter in which they themselves have been a large contributing factor to said ""impossibility""?  I think it's clear John Kerry has plans.  I mean he's said ""I have a plan..."" in repetition well over 100 times in the past 2 weeks.  Maybe they're not all achievable, or realistic right now.  But right now they're just ideas, he's going to have an entire administration of people to modify, and figure out the right from wrong.

Better he have ideas, than ""gut-feelings"" that result in the loss of life both american, and civilian in another country and in addition increase the difficulty of our way of life.  Yeah, those same ""gut-feelings"" (because thats what they are, since it clearly wasn't INTELLIGENCE) that resulted in us, them, and our entire country looking like TOTAL FUCKING IDIOTS.  But hey we don't care, fuck them right?  Fuck them, because now that more people hate us, and the people in these places that did hate us have now more of a reason to spread hatred onto others so they can come kill more innocent people, fuck it right?  (See Below: Nuke Em)

Vote for John Kerry or Vote for the civil war that is going to insue should Bush get re-elected.  Just as inevitable as our recession was, so will the bloodshed amongst eachother.  Pull your head out of your fucking ass and look at the cold hard fucking facts.  I'm sick of hearing these trite bullshit fucking piss-poor arguements about what Kerry voted for, how many times, and when.  Half of them are (as always) taken out of context, or in relation to, and never in actuality.  George Bush can barely fucking form proper sentences without stuttering like a 5 year old retarded boy learning how to read, why the fuck is this the guy you want dealing with other countries and representing us amongst the rest of the world?  If he can't verbally communicate good amongst his own people, that certainly isn't going to change when its dealing with people of other nationalities (Look Up: Fucking Idiot [In Spanish, Italian, Polish, Russian, Arabic, Hebrew, etc etc etc.]  Then watch a UN meeting and listen for it while Bush fills their air with t he stench of bullshit.

"event","After reading through exerpts of Plato's Republic, I've reached alot of epiphanies just by the general overview of how he interpreted things at such an early time.  To think that someone thought of the society we now have, centuries before it was ever even established, is pretty mind blowing.  At first it was almost hard to believe.  Although, clearly flawed to an extent, the ideas and questions it raises I found to be most important.  Aside from gaining the realization that I infact share a great quantity of these ideas with him, amongst other more progressive ideas and changes to what society currently is.  More or less that i've become more of a political philosopher as i've grown older.

Beyond just realizing how early these idea's arose, I've also realized that it took that long for them to ever be realistically established.  This, largely due to the fact of people being so unwilling to accept change.  Well, drastic change atleast.  I think to figure out the ways in which people reject the ideas, or ridicule them would probably be the most appropriate way to find the right approach to presenting them to society.  It seems to me that our society has progressed so far beyond its boundries and capacity.
    -We have technologically advanced so quickly within the last decade, that we've flooded the market with tons of useless shit.  Alot of people forget about the "".com"" year(s) where tons and tons of "".com"" companies flooded the market in hopes of taking advantage of the new industry trying to create new and innovative ways to do things. (ebay, priceline, etc)  In just that year hundreds upon hundreds of these companies formed.  A year later more than 3/4 of them went bankrupt and failed miserably.  The failure that not only probably cost the people running these companies money, but the loss of employment, and possibly those whom invested money on these companies in the market with the same hope of taking advantage of the new 'boom'.
We have the freedom to do almost anything with our lives, but for the ways in which we've advanced we have undoubtedly put ourselves at a great disadvantage that will grow into the future until be basically regress.
   -Our problem is how gluttonous we have grown through our countries progression, when never taking into consideration the future, except thinking higher and higher.  Bigger and better.  More advanced and unimagineable.  But this is never taking into consideration all the other realities that still exist.  The growing poverty rate, and dimishing middle class, which puts great distance between the rich and those below them.  Our money slowly declining in value, so that we cannot afford to live our lives inexpensively.  The more we create, the more responsibilities we take on, and I think it has become clear that at this current stage we're completely unable to uphold these new obligations, along with the old, and progress as a society.  Nothing lasts forever, and I think we're getting a taste of that reality.
   -Another important point is the fact we have become so arrogant, and completely inconsiderate ever since September 11th.  Patriotism spread like an infectious disease throughout everyone.  Theres nothing wrong with loving your country, and supporting it.  That's not the point.  The point, is that we allowed our patriotism to show how completely incompetent, and uneducated people typcially are.  People prancing around with pride, and their american flags wrapped around them screaming ""NUKE EM ALL.""  This idea, maybe exaggerated by some, but many say this with dignity, and feel like it's such a great idea, or even the best resolution to our problems.  Firstly, our whole problem to begin with was a group of terrorists, and people without any moral rationality, or respect for human life, in order to send a message and wage war.  What justifies the fact we kill other people with exactly what we, ourselves fear?  Think about during the cold war when schools would have drills, telling children to climb under desks in a pathetic attempt to save themselves from the destruction of a nuclear bombing?  Think about the way that must have felt, the fear it instilled in children, and people as a whole.  That threat that someone might try and kill massive quantities of people with nuclear weapons.  Then ask yourself if by ""NUKING EM ALL"" it would serve any kind of justice, or just heighten the threat and give people more of a reason to commit these acts of terror, and inhumanities against us.
    -You would think by now people would realize life is not fair, redemption isn't always an option because thats what causes wars.  The entire basis of The Great War (world war 1) was redemption.  Redemption for the assasination of Archduke Francis Ferdinand.  This began what turned into a massive war, a war with a dead rate unimagineable to most.  Old fashioned, and much different than warefare now, yes.  But something so simple as redemption for one single man, caused hundreds of thousands, if not millions to die at war.  Right now, we're in a much larger form of redemption, with much stronger capabilities, and alot more at stake.  We're not considering the modernized form of ""pandora's box"" we are opening by now proving to have had a baseless war.  We have failed to prove that our cause was just, and factual, and based around the right reasons.  It doesn't matter how much we needed Sadaam out of power, but alot of people don't take into consideration the way these people see our actions.  We see them as beneficial to our country, and ""for the best.""  To some degree that is entirely correct.  But in another regard we are giving these people more of a reason to come back decades later with a intricately devised plan to cause more havoc and death in America because of it.  It is quite clear these people are willing to wait, and the more we force ourselves on them, and destroy them in return we are just asking for more in return, and the cycle never ends.  ...And it won't.  So if you thought September 11th is bad, just imagine when the attacks worsen with different weaponry, or targets.  (don't be so stupid as to believe they're gonna bomb your childs school of 25 kids in the middle of wyoming.)
   -Our society is completely inept to interpreting the thoughts and feelings of anyone else but ourselves.  We've been bred to trust, and rely on the media to interpret things that are far beyond the black and white print we read, and everything inbetween.  Our whole lives we're trained to believe and trust in authorities and maybe thats alright.  But theres a fine line between listening, and taking things for granted.  For a large part we have lost our focus on critically thinking about the issues in the world without having some sort of media influence in there.  Everything in the media is a portrayal of both imagery, and the use of language.  How it is used, is how we interpret it, and that has become the problem.  We're not thinking, we're just sitting back watching, and reading, and taking it all in without ever sitting down and thinking about it deeply.  Putting ourselves in the situations, imagining what it's like to be in the situations, realizing that our government has hidden plenty of things from the general public in order to prevent certain types of reactions.  We trust too much in our government, and media, and not in ourselves.  We're consumed to the gills with rhetoric and misleading statements, and people (the media) just trying to get the hot story and pressing it so fast they never get all the facts straight.  That, not even taking into consideration the censorship.
   -Everyone wants peace, and joy, and that ideal way of life.  In places untainted by advertising, corporatization, and money, you will find people that don't need the things we do in order to be happy.  Which all goes back to the complexities of our lives through progression, and we've truely forgotten what it is like to be human.  We're all too focused on material needs, and taking positions on this or that, when it's all in excess.  Had we taken a more platonic approach to our government, and our way of life we might have alot less problems.  But instead we're our own undertakers slowly deteriorating life and society as we know it.  A society that believes in itself, and works for itself as a whole, and not privately or individually.  Commonwealth, something very few people understand anymore.  Everyone's too busy trying to buy out their neighbor, and show off their new this or new that, or tell people how much they are better because of this or that.  Instead of trying to fuction as a whole, we compete within ourselves.  Our problem is much further than terror, and Iraq.  These are large issues, but there are equally large, if not larger issues within our own country that we still fail to do anything about.  But these issues are swept under the carpet because we're too busy giving tax cuts, increasing our debt, helping major corporations that as a group probably gross more income than large portions of middle class americans combined.  The same people that work long, hard working jobs, doing all the labor, sweating, and keeping this country functioning.  Our whole country is a see-saw, and on the top side you have all the wealthy, and on the bottom you have the struggling middle and lower class.  It's only until we can atleast begin to balance the scale a little bit that we'll ever overcome any of the domestic obstacles we have, and this is only scratching the surface."

"event","we're not going to change our country over night.  we're not going to save the world by killing more people, and destroying the things they have, only to rebuild them under international laws of reparations.  the land of the free, yet home of so many slaves.  slaves for a way of life, slaves for a way of being poor, slaves for searching for the american dream that doesn't exist to many.  

this is how things fall apart, but it's only my definition, so don't get confused.

we've structured our society around things that have become, without question, things that are simply becoming our own demise.  and now, because of the way we've done these things, we cannot undo them, but think of ways to improve them with the problems as they come.  This goes for alot of things, however.  So, obviously I can't pinpoint them all.

however, today upon having quite a random, yet interesting conversation about basically the way our country functions I came across a few interesting facts while trying to make a point.  All based upon the economy in which we have created for ourselves.  but first and foremost, money:

the united states currency is the dollar, we created this system many years ago.  the actual paper and coins aren't worth shit.  Besides maybe what you could make off of melting down the metals and selling them to a scrap yard.  the system we created (as i believe other countries have) is simply that currency in itself is worthless.  but, the gold that backs it somewhere collecting dust, is what gives it value.  this is what makes money worth anything, besides its value on a world market.  that part of the deal is a bit more complex.  so, today upon testing the exchange rate between the dollar, and fairly new euro, it was still clear that our money isn't worth shit in europe anymore.  simply because they've developed a better system.  at least for the time being.  after checking what $1,000 us, would translate to in euros, the sum was something around 831.49 this here goes to prove simply that our money is worth less than theirs.  that is a large difference to have in a world market, although it the 200 dollar difference seems minimal.  imagine that at a scale in the millions, and billions, as that are typically the sums dealt with in business, especially internationally.

for those of you that haven't figured it out.  this means we're no longer the most economically powerful country in the world.  at least not right now.

there are alot of other elements to factor into this reality.  such as, the spending of our current president that has clearly put us in the largest defecit in united states history.  you don't see the news reporting that often, because it's not going to work very well for his campaign.  besides the fact, the money being spent is for our war on terror.  in our simple, ignorant, and now fearful minds, we accept this loss because it makes us feel safer.  well, aside from the fact our wonderful government likes to instill fear in us every so often by raising the terror level to some new color.  but we'll just pretend they don't do that, for right now.

it was just the other day i read how 12 billion dollars of the over 120 billion now spent in iraq has been unaccounted for, yet missing.  thats quite interesting, being this money was supposed to be what was paying soldiers stationed in iraq, and ironically, thousands of soldiers on the payroll during this investigation took place were not infact on duty in iraq at the time.  must have been a simple mistake.  12 billion dollars isn't that much, right?  or the 1.72 trillion dollar debt we stand in right now thats coming out of our own pockets.  you didn't think haliburton was going to work for free, did you?

next point:

although this goes back to before, thats okay.  there have been long standing conspiracy theories that the gold in which our money is valued upon, has been stolen, missing, or not as much of it exists as said to be.  although, to my own knowledge i know nothing of this matter, or any truth to the causes.  i couldn't help but notice a few things.

for one, taxes are our way of loaning the government money.  although, the money in taxes doesn't actually exist in paper to us during the time we don't possess it, it exists in numbers.  the reasons for this, seem more to free up odds and ends, and not have all money floating around constantly.  if money was always in our hands at every moment, our country would not be able to function properly.  this is what makes other things important, like investing in the stockmarket.  although, you can earn more money in the stock market, and obviously buying stock is said to be a 'partial owner' in the company(s) in which you invest.  it free's up money from paper, to numbers.  there is also other options of investments besides company stocks on the market.   there are also bonds, and other types of things.  which also, convert paper, to more or less an IOU or receipt.  the system of that is a bit complex.  so take it for what it is.

secondly, because of this stock market and structures of an economy we have created we now rely on exports more than we do imports.  obviously because most imports don't earn for ourselves, as exports do.  except, no one wants what we make, because other people make it better.  the majority of things you own are not american made.  the may be assembled in america, but that doesn't neccesarily make them american made.  this also poses a problem for us, because we're not generating enough revenue ourselves through productivity amongst the world.  yet, the world makes a killing off of our gluttonous asses.  cell phones, computers, cars, machinery, toys, clothes, everything.  this is good for economics,  but bad for us.  why?  because they might need us to keep business, but without them, we're nothing.  but now with a quickly growing defecit in our own country itself.  that now inflates the prices of what we buy every day, and in turn decreases the value of the dollar both in america, and outside america.

now, in a position like this...where does the cycle end?  because at the rate we're going, eventually the government is going to have spent every 'backed' dollar we own, and our money will be entirely worthless both to us here, and the world around us.  we're going to go back to the trade method of ""i'll give you this for that"" because all we'll be able to have is whatever we can pawn off for something else.  that might seem far fetched, and maybe it is.  but, at this rate its not impossible, and thats the problem.

our country talks about terrorism, and ""evil do-ers"" as our <i>highly intelligent</i> (yes that was sarcasm) president likes to call them.  yet, no one pays attention to the fact that 90% of imports and exports come through new york and new jersey (thats 90% of our international economy).  The world trade center, dealt with all of those things.  Hence they destroyed them.  They destroyed 90% of what we had in an hour.  It wasn't just about killing innocent people,  it was about acheiving an objective at all costs.  Remember, they hate us for the image we project to the world.  Which is usually projected through our own government.  Besides the bullshit, false images we sell in advertising.  I hate it, so I don't blame them either for hating it when they live in much worse conditions than we do.  Point being, they want to destroy our government, because by doing that they destroy our society as a whole, and they're succeeding because we have a president that doesn't know how to count without using his fingers.  He's a republican, over the past century, republicans have been known, and statistically proven to spend OUR money wrecklessly, and increase our debt at a rate of 11% + a year.  That doesn't seem like alot, but just for kicks take 11% of 1,720,000,000 and see what you get.  Then maybe you'll get a little bit of an idea of what i'm talking about.

Our economy fell apart to begin with largely to do with what happened with the world trade center.  The information, numbers, and everything else lost on that day hit us hard, and we almost immediately dropped into what they call a ""recession"" which is basically pre-depression.  Now, as a result of this, stocks everywhere dropped drastically both between what was lost, and the people probably selling their shares in the masses out of sheer panic.  Therefore immediately decreasing the value of our economy, in turn the value of our money, and quite simply the value of our country as a whole.  Now when you have a president, spending money that isn't worth nearly as much as it was, like its nothing, when we don't have much anymore, this creates a much larger issue.  Now, obviously, the president can't just spend the money, it has to be approved by congress first.  But take into consideration the republican party is the majority in congress right now, and also the house of representatives, ontop of having the most govenorships in the 50 states.  Add that, ontop of alot of sympathetic people from what happened, willing to do all to fight for this never happening again, and you have alot of mistakes being made.

I might not be an economist, or an accountant, or anything to deal with the depth of these actual monetary issues here.  But, I'm sure as fuck not stupid, and I believe I used simple logic to construct all of this.  Obviously with the help of a little research earlier.  

Also, just as a short arguement for the people that like to say ""i don't care what you say I support my president""

just take the time to go back to the 1940's when hitler reigned in germany.  all the people that assisted killing millions of jews, they all supported their leader, and did as he lead them to do.  But i'm sure you more than condemn those people for their horrific, and inhumane acts.  What makes you think you're not doing the same thing right now?  With our soldiers: brothers, sisters, mothers, daughters, sons, fathers, cousins, friends in iraq right now, dying, and killing people every day.  A society of people that have yet to show a record of hosility IN the united states.  That includes sadaam, but i think we all know he deserves to die.  Other than that, we're wasting our time, and all you mindless fucks that support our president because he's our president are just contributing to our forthcoming demise simply through stupidity, and selfishness.

"event","okay, i'm bored, which is why I'm actually writing in this fucking thing.  I've decided I'm gonna take this time out to point out some people, and things I hate about them.  Yes, I like pointing the finger and laughing at people.

First and foremost,  I extremely hate when people get overly drunk to where their head is hanging down past their shoulders, then get sudden bursts of energy, and say completely fucking irrational shit no one cares about.  People like that should be banned from drinking alcohol, or just shot in the face from close range, whichever.

I also hate people that have political agenda's based on the most irrational shit ever.  Prime example: RELIGION.

It's so fucking petty how people sit there and try to push ""god"" in everyone's fucking face, and that's supposed to make it okay because we have the freedom to believe what we wish.  Yet, we can attempt to put religious morals, ethics, and standards, into the mainstream, and everyone is supposed to take it with a fucking smile.  So, when someone, (which seems to be alot of people) oppose their self-important, religious horse shit for ways of living.  The opposition suddenly becomes an object of attack through trite biblical quotes from the book of who gives a fuck anymore.  People can believe and feel whatever the fuck they want.  But as soon as they're told their way of life isn't right for everyone, it's a fucking issue that has to be repetatively approached in order for them to get what they want.  Like a bunch of whiney fucking pussies.  Yes, I am particularly referring to the current conflicts of gay marriage.  Fuck Bush, Fuck God, and Fuck a bunch of bible wielding douche bags that think their life is so fucking righteous.

It's sad enough people are already considering revoking the rights of people because of their differences.  But the fact that they repeatedly keep trying to push the issue after being shot down twice now, I believe.  It's just, disgusting.  Here we are in a place of FREEDOM, and a place where everyone is always talking about equal-rights, and affirmative action, and all that bullshit.  Yet, the same people making all these statements, and trying to make these things happen, according to their statements, meanwhile, completely conflict them by not accepting the diversity of our country, and saying people do not own the right to be who they are and live amongst us all equally.  Why?  Because the 'good book' said so...and it's that fucking simple.  Why aren't other people blaming god, and religion for this shit?  Because thats too taboo.  But really, thats where all this hatred extends from.  FUCK THAT.

This extends off a little bit from the above.  However, I still feel the need to point out these people and spit...
I am so sick and fucking tired of seeing pathetic, little shit people prancing around with i <3 whoeverthefuck on the back of their hands, acting like they're soooooo fucking in love, and how great their lives are.  Then, when they get completely fucked over, because of their simple mindedness, and complete ignorance, they cry about it.  People need to wake the fuck up and realize 90% of the relationships in your younger years are just preliminary bullshit that will never fucking last.  Everything is trial and error, experience for the future, learning.  Not fucking wedding bells ringing because your fucking astrological signs are a perfect match on fucking horoscopes.com.  I've also found it fairly consistant that these people are typically female, and also love to indulge themselves in meaningless shit, pop-culture, shopping for 10 pairs of shoes they'll only wear once and throw out.  Brittany Spears, Jessica Simpson, and her beak-nosed, poor excuse for a singer and human being sister Ashlee.  People consumed with popular culture, like theres no other way to live.  The same people that model themselves after people in magazine advertisements, billboards, and famous people.  People that obviously have absolutely no sense of individuality, and willingness to prosper within their own environment without being influenced by what they saw in fucking Teen magazine, or whatever.  It's become awfully clear that our inability to build a popular culture with some sort of realistic structure has allowed people in our society to grow up entirely influenced by the glamour, and pretending like this shit is actually cool to ever realize none of its worth a shit.  This is why these girls believe theres a happy ending, that one guy is going to last forever, because you wrote his name on your hand so everyone knows how fucking stupid you are.  Saddest part is theres no cure for this shit, besides murder and suicide.  We're in a progression where popular culture is only going to grow worse, more fabricated, and pretentious, and alot more people are going to be growing up in a world where they think all this shit is actually a way of living.  Quite frankly, it's equally as worse as people that dedicate themselves to god, and all that bullshit.  If hitler was alive today, i'd try to convince him to save the jews, and instead just start gasing these people.  At least its quite clear these people don't deserve to live.  They plague this earth with their stupidity, and false ideals, while everythings falling apart around them but they're too busy glued to the Newly Weds, to realize it.

People are fucking pathetic.  If there was a definitive hell, this is probably it, just no one's figured it out yet.

"event","you think its all so easy, but when its hard, then everything is hard.  life has easy points, and even if the majority were all easy, the second times get tough you immediately say to yourself ""man life is hard.""  theres no real way to make a distinction, so fuck it, who cares.  however, life seems to be so much harder trapped inside this box.  an entire world of people, places, and events before your eyes and the little 'black box' inside your mind to interpret and distinguish things.  i've come to realize very few people actually utilize the ability they have, and instead only put before their eyes a bunch of shit that doesn't even matter.  these are those same people that, the day they 'wake up' from their little dream-world's, are the first ones to talk about how hard it is.  yet, does it really make life hard? well, you can't say.  because no one can truely judge.  sadly, in my little black box of a world, i have to look at everything for its every detail.  i don't even try to, and it just happens because it has become such a natural instinct.  when you start seeing every little detail of everything, its like almost nothing becomes a mystery.   eventually, you find reasons to hate everything, and everyone, because they'll always be the epitome of something vile.  the more imperfect you realize the world around you is, the more you hate having to inhabit it, and share the same oxygen and space as the things in it.  yet, that isn't even the part of it that makes it so disgusting...its when you stop and ask yourself where you fit into the scheme of things.  when you ask yourself, if you're any different from the exact things you've grown to hate.  as much as anyone would t and put it into perspective, you never can, then it just becomes cyclical.  granted, some people automatically become everything they hate, and they condemn themselves to the worst of the worst.  but as wierd as it sounds, there is a personal bias.  you can't actually judge yourself because there is no way to be impartial.  so you sit behind this perception of pure disgust, never knowing how you fit, never knowing if you're really any different.  so every day passes, years pass, you see more, learn more...and the more eager you become to really want to know the answers.  noticably, you become obsessed, and just as all of this disgust consumes your eyes, and ears, you have no real answers.  meanwhile, you're so consumed with disgust you've automatically become a part of it just by being so wrapped in it.  so then does it make you any different?  the only real difference just seems to be that you stare from the outside in, instead of looking from the inside out.  the circle, turns and turns, and it has to real distinguishable ending, being life is such a cycle, theres nothing that even says it doesn't work the same with with life and death.  its just a cycle, once you break out of one (dying) you fall into another one, another cycle begins, and you work your way through that, through hardship, through torture, through bliss, through everything, we could very well be ""gods"" weak little slaves, an experiment intended to self-destruct.  no one knows, everyone just wants to believe certain things because its what they want as their own reality.  reality; one (of many) thing that has a definition, but no real definition because reality varies from person to person.  reality is only the world as YOU see it, and regardless of what anyone else tells you it is, you have to build your own idea of it.  by taking someones information, and adding it to your idea of what it is, you are trusting that, you trust that their idea is the right idea, although it could very well be wrong.  jesus was the sacrificial lamb that gave people an idea that turned into an evolution of excuses. god and jesus must be biggest excuses used on a daily basis, as justifications.  because everyone things that such a superior being, is an excuse for anything.  'hey, we can't figure out if the universe ends, or if there is other life forms' .... thepope: ""you can't. there is no other life. god created only heaven and earth."" blah fucking blah.  religion is a fucking cult, and the more i grow up everyday the more i realize that.  it completely rejects peoples freedom of thought, it tells you whats right and whats wrong, it tells you what your morals are supposed ot be.  meanwhile, all the shit it tells you to be, and do, to begin with was written fucking centuries ago.  so suddenly theres no such thing as evolution, because ya know, nothings changed since then.  i often forget how i live in a fucking cave.  now we have all this turmoil, and so many conflicts solely based around religion, and being that the constitution protects such shit, i have to sit here and listen to a bunch of ignorant fucking necrophiliacs talk about some fucking dead guy, and how god says this or that. people need to just shut the fuck up already, and instead of pretending like they have all the answers, get off their ignorant asses and go fucking look for them themselves.  if people abided by every single book that claimed to be something, could you imagine what this world would be like? get over it, the fucking guy is dead, he's not going to be ressurected next sunday...its all just a fucking fairy-tale.  this is just the type of shit that makes the world so ugly, and ignorant.  a bunch of people thanking nothing, acting like something superior is responsible for things, responsible for ones success, and all the negative things its blamed for is always justified.  well, god said...god decided...well maybe people need to stop and think that THATS JUST HOW LIFE IS.  god didn't wake up and decide he's going to suddenly give your best friend AIDS, god didn't turn his and and point his finger and say ""i want you to go shoot up a school and kill innocent people""  but when it comes to something like a school shooting, instantly it goes to their music...they might have listened to something satanic, so instantly its the work of evil.  OR MAYBE EVERYONE IS FUCKING EVIL. we're all just evil on our own different levels.  like the guy that love jesus, but has no problem using someone elses weaknesses in order to better benefit himself and his own cause.  thats not the work of satan, thats just life....being competative.  but everything else, is ""god's"" work.  if we truely lived in a country, and world where people actually possesed free thought, and didn't have to pick and choose and be classified as certain things.  we wouldn't have half the problems we do, because there wouldn't be a separation of sides, there wouldn't be boudries.  there might be some chaos, but there already is, it wouldn't be the same chaos, it wouldn't be the same stress, the world would be completely different.  in a world where everyone is different, you accept that everyone is different.  you still hate certain 'types' of people, as far as not believing in what they think or do, but overall it would eliminate alot of things that just fuck this world up more.  and religion is definitely the biggest part of all of that.  and lastly, to my foundationless entry....people need to stop talking good about the dead, especially when its more than obvious you never liked them.  its alright to feel bad, but if you don't like them, then just be glad its not you and stop being so fucking pretentious.  its really fucking pathetic.  oh, yeah, and maybe jesus wouldn't have died if the wonderful followers of him actually faught for him, instead of just standing around and crying like a bunch of pussies.  if he was so prestigeous, then your shitty little cult would have done something about it besides acting like he was such a fucking messiah, or whatever you want to call him. //end"

"event","normally i don't write about my experiences, like so many people tend to.  i'd much rather stray away from having to be the typical asshole's in this world using the service.  however, today i feel its an obligation of mine to write about this regardless if anyone actually reads it. because atleast somewhere i'll have written down the memories of the past two days.  first and foremost, from a second story window is undoubtedly my favorite band...just fucking amazing. then to have seen them three times over a span of nine days is just...i can't even put into words how fucking incredible that is.  i saw them once last friday in fucking fagsburg pennsylvania where all the kids were just fucking lame, and didn't represent shit...especially considering FASSW is from pennsylvania, though some from ohio, but whatever. that experience was great, but just because i finally got to see them having been into them as i am.  but friday not only did i get to see them for a second time, but get up on stage a fucking sing, not to mention what is probably my favorite song.  it was just such a fucking rush, and to know i didn't suck judging from the response i got from them.  also, sarah got the fucking mic and fucking ripped it up which was just as fucking awesome...because she's awesome. haha. we fucking rock. and they fucking rock. getting to talk to them after their set was great, and hopefully i'll be getting a tape from the set soon from joey since he took down my info and shit because its definitely worth having. they played so fucking amazing, and just to get to see my geeky ass in my moment of pure fucking glory singing that shit perfectly on que. maybe not, but hey fuck it, i thought i was...hahah.  but yeah, then after talking with some of them afterwards and just seeing how fucking awesome they are was even better. they were so happy with the fact that we got up there and sang and went fucking ape shit for them. but meanwhile, atleast speaking for myself...the pleasure was all mine...without a fucking doubt.  so derek offered to get sarah and ant into the show that was today, so we could all come fucking tear the shit up which was so fucking awesome of them. although we waited around for 5 hours so like 8 horrible fucking bands could play before them, it was worth every fucking minute in the end because we all came there for them, waited for them, and just fucking tore that fucking place apart when they played.  sarah got up and went fucking nuts, all the guys were just happy as fuck, which was so fucking sick. i got to get up and sing some of vespers again, which of course was all i needed to have for the night. me and ant were fucking moshing the whole fucking place up, while like 2 other people actually did anything for them, which was so fucking gay because they are such an incredible band. but fucking north jersey kids all suck cock, and only do shit for the 8 shitty fucking examples of music prior to that, and then number twelve.  they're a bunch of dick loving, shady, should-have-been blowjobs. i fucking hate all those kids, which is why i was fucking swinging my fist at them like it was a fucking sledgehammer. because all i wanted to do was fucking tear their fucking faces off and eat the fucking flesh.  besides the fact FASSW makes me want to do that anyway....i just felt like it more because all those kids are such fucking geeks, and they were all being bitches when it was my turn to fuck shit up and i was fucking beating their little fucking head-hog girlfriends and punching their best friend.  they wanted to be all cool and crowd punch, but no one looked to happy when i did it. FUCK THOSE PUSSY'S.  moral of the story is, the past two days have been amazing....joey gets awesome. me, sarah and ant, fucking pwnt everyone the past two days, everyone in FASSW is fucking awesome, even nick whom i actually didn't talk to at all....he's a lefty drummer thats insane alone, never mind being as good as he is.  derek has the sickest fucking ideas i have ever heard in my entire life, and i hope that they really go through with them because i think it will make fucking headlines on CNN or some shit.  i got to sing vespers, casper is one of the coolest fucking dudes i have met, and that nigger needs to come to jersey more because he's a fucking nut and he belongs in this fucking cage of insanity, hahah.  and........yeah it was fucking amazing, i really hope i get this video from joey because its gonna fucking rock. now...you can all go die. because i hate your mother for not having a doctor shove a spike through the back of your head when you were born...."

"event","its pretty sad how i try to sit here and devour the world as if i have a clue.  the more days that pass, and the more i sit here trying to figure out everything, i realize that not only am i wasting my time...but i'm looking for answers to questions that really cannot definitively be answered: ""to each his own"" and basically thats how it is...everything varies from one person to the next, and i'm sitting here using my own experiences to define others as if its really possible.  maybe its not impossible, persay..but for the most part its really hard to answer these questions, especially when it relies on another person.  however, i have tended to always keep a certain quote in mind...and recently its come to my attention that i could have quite possibly been looking at that all wrong too.  ""life is what you make of it..."" now all along i was under the impression that it meant more or less life is what you make out of it, what you do, what you make happen for yourself, the directions you go in, etc etc.  however, i'm left questioning if thats the actual meaning, or if its really something along the lines of...life is how you interpret it to be.  in life you come across alot of things, alot of questions, dead ends, situations, confusions, and all that great shit...and so maybe in turn how you interpret things and deal with them is what you make of it.  as opposed to saying its something you actually create for youself, its actually something already there its just all upon the interpretation of your mind that makes it something, or what it is.  i suppose this just proves the point that not many things in life can definitely be answered without there being other possibilities.  obviously i'm one of few people that actually sit here and question these things, and its the kind of thing that could make you lose your sanity...but even if i tried to ignore it all, it will still linger in my mind regardless.  for whatever reason i've been cursed with a mind that automatically has to pick apart every single detail of things in order to fully understand it.  its really annoying how complicated life is, yet it can be so simple...i guess i just make it harder on myself. i suppose that could be an explanation for why i feel like my life is such shit."

"event","my whole life it seems like so many people have come and gone, in every imagineable regard. mostly without a father figure, for the better part of my childhood...and for the moments i actually had been around him are probably the most fucked up memories i'll have to own for the rest of my life.  its pretty hard having to be your own man from such a young age, because although yes i've been raised by both my mother and my grandmother, theres still that boundry that they can't cross.  so without that i've had to be strong, especially being my mother was only seventeen when i was born, and then with the absence of a father figure, it obviously added to the struggle.  i can't say i had the worst childhood possible, but i certainly went through alot of emotional things at an extremely young age and its certainly molded me into the person i am today to a large degree.  having first to deal with a mentally ill father for the brief period i chose to communicate with him, then to have a step-father whom grew near and dear to my heart, fall a victim to a heroin addiction...it didn't really help me much.  there are alot of things i won't ever forget about my past, but the one i'll certainly never forget was having to find my step-father overdosed and turning blue on the bedroom floor after being abruptly awaken in the night by the rumbling of him crashing from wherever to the floor full force.  to have to sit there and be a spectator in my preteen years to more or less a drug induced death, wasn't an easy image to grasp onto.  thankfully, for his own sake, and i suppose even my own..he survived the ordeal, but later went on to overdose another eight times over the next 10 days.  having had to live most of my childhood seemingly solo in the aspect of a father figure, to then allow someone else to replace, and fill the void in my life was a large emotional step for myself, atleast to my own opinion.  its hard being in a position to allow someone to be as though they were responsible for your creation, and to treat you like so, when consciously you know that they are certainly not that person. then to take such a big step, and have that person just slowly deteriorate from your life is probably one of the most disappointing things i could have experienced...aside from the smaller factors that also fall between that and the larger picture.  i've realized that my earlier emotional instabilities, and also instabilities in relationships within my own family have without question reflected onto everything else in my life, from friendships, to relationships with significant others.  i've always known this, but its not until now, this very moment i realize how much of a hurt it puts onto my relations with other people.  i refuse to give anyone the space, or periods of time to really think things over in certain situations...and i now see that its just because i've given so much time and caring to people in the past that, i don't want to have to feel like i gave it all away for such a long while when in reality it was never going to last.  almost three years ago next month, on one of the saddest days i encountered through my teens (the tragic death of one of my friends) i also began one of the most tragic relationships i've ever experienced.   for some reason or another i built feelings that i had never felt in my entire existence for a significant other...i had other girlfriends, not many, but i had them...and i had actually just gotten out of a relationship of a year and a half prior to this new beginning.  however, never for a single second did i feel the way i felt about her. i couldn't explain it, and quite honestly i still don't possess the power to explain it even now...it just kinda caught me by surprise.  just as i was blindsided by the overwhelming emotions of true love (atleast on my own part) i was constantly caught off guard with neglect, and her inability to function in a realistic relationship.  constantly i was having to question the validity of her words, and actions, as if i wasn't parinoid enough just as a person, being with her intensified it in the thousands.  for two seemingly eternal years i chose to put myself through the depths of misery, and back again, and again, and again.  i've never been so pathetic in my entire life...and through all the bullshit i had to undergo throughout that period, it put a severe hurting on me emotionally.  my whole life i had been an extremely emotional person...i can't remember a second that i could have even come close to labelling myself as entirely impervious, apathetic, or emotionless.  but upon the conclusion of this relationship i was all of that...and then some.  i would let absolutely nothing, or no one get past my exterior defenses, and at no cost were they ever going to, seemingly.  for all i had been through, and now put myself through it seemed absolutely pointless to allow anyone to mean anything to me at all...everyone in my life was completely indespensible as the next, no more, no less.  if you had crossed any kind of line that caused me to have some sort of emotional response, you were gone, and it didn't matter to me how you felt about that, how it may have affected you, nothing. that was the end of it, plain and simple.  for the first time since i could last remember, i had finally started to come around emotionally, and it was incredible, i felt so great to be able to feel something again.  but just as easily as it come, i realized i still could easily throw it all away and just go straight back to the rock hard person i had been before.  while at the time it seemed to be a decent quality, because that way i wouldn't allow myself to be hurt...i never took the time to really see that i was infact hurting other people, and losing bonds with those that really did mean something.  right now, i could probably count on my fingers how many people i can actually say i care about, trust, and consider dear to my heart.  but my personality doesn't allow me to really reflect that much, although in alot of regards i may show it, when times get tough i still have my natural reaction of just wanting them the fuck out of my face, and my life because i do not want to allow them to get under my skin and affect me.  i truely feel that this has without question made me not only lesser of a person, but contributed greatly to the feelings of lonliness that have been seemingly multiplying inside me as each day passes.  so obviously by writing this i have a basis, and that basis being that i had found a connection with someone unlike anyone else in this world. someone that i felt understood me to a certain degree, and not only had that mutual feeling, but appreciated it unlike i ever made myself aware.  its to my great disadvantage to have to know right now that the bind i had found is now without a doubt severed. yet another result of me not allowing myself, or other people for that matter to penetrate me too much emotionally because i'm so fearful of the long-term results that may come of it.  i find myself actually wishing i had thought before i acted alot of the time, and wishing i could not only take back some of the things that i forcefully made happen, but just my methods as a whole of going about it.  its not often you could have a bond with someone on the level that we had such a bond, and because of my instabilities, and insecurities i allowed myself to completely ruin everything.  even though its only been a brief period of time, i can already feel the absence, and the affects that i wished to avoid anyway...and now i know theres no real way to ever gain back the level of trust, and openess that we once owned, and thats something that has truely saddened me over this period.  i suppose you live and learn, and with the territory comes the detriment, and unfortunate outcomes that mold you into a better person if you take them the right way.  but deep deep down, i don't want this to be just another one of those lessons i have to learn to grow up.  sadly, thats the way its seeming to be...and for that i'll own a lifetime of regret for being mindless enough to have allowed something like this slip through my fingers just because i'm still holding onto the figures of the past, and allowing it to haunt me everyday, and just create more haunting experiences and memories for me to have to live with for the rest of my life. it just really sucks to be me...and i haven't any better words to describe that right now. it fucking sucks. bad. and even more sadly im bitching about this in an online journal...but i really don't have a better place to put it without having to hear other peoples opinions that i'm really not in the mood to hear...fuck it. nothin' wrong with being just a little more of a sad person during times like this. and that is all. heh."

"event","it seems like now-a-days its hard to find people that actually appreciate you, not just the things you do for them, or just the person you are.  but someone that appreciates you in everyway imagineable, and unconditionally they bend and break themselves to bare with you through all the bumps in the road that naturally come along with life.  everyday the world turns and at any given second life can take drastic turns, faster than it can actually be perceived...some of these turns can be extremely positive, and of course others can be negative to the point where breathing seems like its a bigger burder than the actual problem itself.  at times like that you gain and lose things, and in the midst of everything people that were in your life are just as easily gone as things changed.  its come to my attention that, i haven't many people that truely appreciate me, the things i do, who i am, or anything...in more cases than others people seemingly just care about themselves and only that. its not to say that they show absolutely no gratitude, or respect for you, but moreso that when it comes down to the hard times, either they're not the type of person to be supportive of you, or they just pretend like they understand when in reality you know they don't...just for example.  of course there are other things, and contributing factors...but those stand out most above all else, not to say there aren't variations, everything is obviously just circumstancial.  however the one person whom did appreciate me unconditionally, i completely overlooked it and compromised the entire relationship i had for that fact i wasn't smart enough to see it.  it just made me exactly like the people i criticize for not being true to anything but themselves and their own personal gains, and for that i am more than ashamed.  its extremely hard for me to stomach that as i condemn people for their selfishness, and inability to be true to anyone but themselves, i very well did the same without ever taking the time to thing twice about it.  to think that i could risk compromising something that i considered important for so long solely because i didn't care about anyone but myself is just so utterly pathetic. i am the luckiest person alive right now just to have the understanding, and acceptance that they give to me that allows the relationship between us to still exist to this day...theres not many people that are willing to understand you for your mistakes and in turn completely be forgiving without that constant sense of resentment because of what happened...words can't describe the luck i have to have someone like that in my life.

the vast concludes these revelations turning my stomach to binge

take to your dances around the shreds of mutilated flesh, deepend by the edge of sentences saturated with excuses and justification of a void extending beyond any actual intention.  contexts are complicating interpretations of reality, pretenses somehow unfound, bound to the gesture that opened up what made these <i>defects</i> continue to chafe my presence.  <b>i've made so many attempts in vain to salvage a single piece of myself</b> admist this catastrophic state of wretchedness, <b>and my swollen hands clench fists full of nothing</b>.  beyond the days the glass of the mirrors fell like my shattered heart into the embrace of this frozen landscape, the curse lingers on through the veins revealed that you ignore.  behind curtains of scorn hides the torment i'll find, that i've learned as my only comfort as my collapse takes its affects and <b>distance has no such meaning in a world where nothing can be reached.</b>  i'll go on from here, never searching for an escape...<u>i've already been burned beyond recognition</u>."

"event","anywhere, at any given point in time...things can change, and they will as long as they're allowed to.  your entire life as you've lived it on daily basis can be completely altered in a single moment, a split second.  its hard to fathom how it ends up happening this way but time and time again it seems to prove itself without flaw, the only flaw that seems to be there is the transitional stage where you (or atleast from my own perspective) grow confused, frustrated, angry, and basically anything else inbetween.  for myself the larger, and more life altering changes have come from points where my vulnerability allowed me to be dragged through periodical lifestyles based solely on deception, and ones self-motivated causes.  it's an unfortunate experience, i must say, however whats worse about it is that people actually have the time on their hands to manipulate situations for their own occupancies, or self-fulfillment whichever comes first.  i guess its sad enough that i repeatedly allow myself to be drawn into these situations...i mean after all this time, and all these horrifying experiences i have had to endure for such mindless decisions, you would tend to think i'd gain a better knowledge of these things and deter them.  also, for the fact that i have this keen sense of people without really having to know them for long, it seems like i should know better than to allow myself to be walked all over.  but for whatever reason, i get clouded by the impression of their deceptive abilities and end up only seeing the mask they wear to blanket the truth beneath it all, usually the mask i completely pull apart in a single glance.  maybe its my own despair, that gets a drop of something better and it just makes a cut directly down my chest to expose every little weakness to be used to my own disadvantage...and just when you think you're getting somewhere you have to realize you were never anywhere at all.  the assumptions made, and ideas you had, were all just a part of something larger that you hadn't any idea of until the moment it finally bleeds through enough to grant you some clarity.  clarity might be looked at as something good: the clearer view of what you're trying to interpret, the understanding you gain from it...but when it has the shattering effect of making you feel like a complete fool, and leaving you with the scars of knowing you've allowed someone to completely use you in order to gain for themselves, its not exactly the best realization to be having.  although, it now gives you the insight to prevent it from becoming deeper, the wound still leaves a permanent scar...and no matter what happenes, or where you go from there, deep in your mind...there are the lesions of the days you'd wish to forget, branded into your mind as if someone opened up your skull and scratched them in primatively with the sharpened edge of a stick.  splinters stick into the walls of your head every which way you turn to look, and the unbarable aching seems so eternal, and for every second of the exerience you have to have the unplesant images of your past wash through the landscapes just to remind you of how much of an asshole you felt like when you finally realized you were just a pawn. hah, well i suppose my embitterment is pretty apparent right there, but i suppose unless you really know what i'm talking about, you can never truely understand the feelings you have toward such periods of time, and such situations that you had willing gotten yourself into, blindly, to then just suffer the consequences and having to be the one the bleeds in the end while seemingly the world keeps revolving, and you're just standing still. yeah, it sucks. just thought i'd say that. heh.

this sadness shreds my exterior defenses, i can hear the sound of tears welling in this lonely room.  i'll wear the shame of this moment, and i'll remain petrified of your touch. deprived of a reason, the windows and opportunities have disappeared and the fountain pen inked with the blood from my heart draws unforgetable conclusions in memories.  i refuse to walk this earth in search of a kiss, the one to fulfill my dying wish...that brings me closer to the stars that burned them until the sun erased the possibility they ever made it through the stretch of cold air that froze my lips as i spoke of you.  when i did, you never thought of me and this has proven i could never stray from the path of neverending tragedies.  i'm collapsing, with no sign of comfort but the freedom to shed these drops like rain, face flat in soaken pillows, the same that absorbed the passing time while i knew no difference between night and day. and now i refuse to walk this earth again, following the petals of dead roses into the garden of your sins."

"event","ok well, this entry isn't going to be like the rest because for once i'm actually going to talk about my own life, so ya know, thats just a warning. heh.  but lately i can't help but feel so much anxiety, and just fear of whats to come with my plans for the future.  all i want in my life is to earn my success, just as anyone else successful in this world would have to: through hard work, and schooling, etc etc.  but now, since i've decided to transfer from one major to another, and same with schools, its looking more and more impossible that i'll even get accepted into rutgers.  it seems like everything relies on things i can no longer help...my highschool transcripts, when in highschool the only normal classes i took were my senior english, and the creative writing class.  how am i supposed to convince a school to allow me into their institution when i barely have the highschool credientials typical students do? i mean, i can't sit here and say its their fault, because i fucked up, i got expelled, and stuck in these 'containment' classes with all the retard level ciriculum. so now, my actions of the past will most likely have a terribly negative result on my present, and although i may have had a 3.5 grade average in devry, it probably means nothing as far as the university sees.  i've done the best i can to become successful in my classwork, i did the best i could and in the end the approximate year i spent busting my ass might not ammount to anything in the end, but an experience. for the countless hours i've spent and earn credit for, may very well be a waste, and to me--that alone is sad.  not to mention the numerous people i've encountered that have said devry's transfer credits are not only worth absolutely nothing, but that half the time they never send them out, so that just improves my chances even better, huh?  my entire future relies on this application being accepted because otherwise i'm going to have to slave for man, making just enough to get my by week after week just so i can surivive amongst the rest, when meanwhile i could be utilizing my fullest of potentials somewhere else, possibly making and earning a real living in a field of work in which i love.  lately, i've just become so completely irritated, and just so completely overwhelmed by all of this anxiety, and fear that i haven't actually been able to think rationally about anything.  death seems like more of a success in these circumstances, than anything else...becasue right now theres nothing worse for me to have to feel but that because of my past, that i am not good enough to be allowed to have an attempt at something, as if my knowledge itself makes no difference, but that my prior actions have to reflect upon everything now, when this all occured through some of the hardest parts of my life, and during my adolescence.  the hard times that ruined me once before, tear through every minute in the lapse since, and become the exact thing that could very well destroy me again?  i just don't understand how this shit can happen to me, i watch so many people around me go on with themselves, and do whatever, and get everything, all the chances, all the opportunities, with not half of what i have, and not even a care in the world for what they're doing.  so, while i'll most likely be rejected, someone who's just going through the motions, without any ambition, or care for the future is going to make it, and just fail their way through, and i'll be sitting here, the underprivilaged asshole with all the potential in the world, and not a single open door for anything but a mediocre life, working some dead end job...i fucking hate this shit. i just want to slam my head in a fucking door repeatedly until i'm braindead and i don't have to realize how much this fucking sucks. fuuuuuuuuuck."

"event","""...from the day you're born you begin the process of death"" i guess it couldn't have been said better, because obviously the entire process of life is more or less based around death. i mean, everyday we live our lives as we usually would, probably never thinking about it, but if it weren't for death we wouldn't have all of these saftey measures in most of the things we do.  so at that, we have to base our lives around the fact of death, because within almost everything we do theres a possibility of it, some come spontaneously, some are well known from the start. however, its always there...some tend to acknowledge it (such as myself) others are intimidated by it, and then some press into it as much as they can until they do.  now, my theory is...throughout the good part of your lifetime, being the more productive years..your lifestyle can only fall into two categories, death, and dying.  i guess, death, really is dying, and etc etc, but as far as i can see there is a difference in the aspect i speak of. when you're living a lifestyle in the aspects of death, its as most people live on a daily basis, you live accordingly to try and do what you can while you're here, and just enjoy as much of things as possible.  although most people won't actually look at things and say it, you really are doing exactly that...its not to say your entire motivation of doing things is because you know you're going to die, but deep down you know sometimes you only have one chance at things so why not do it.  even for those that have a complete disregard for themselves, and the fact of death (daredevils, extreme sports, drag racing, excessive drug use, gangs, etc) if you hadn't a clue death was there, than you wouldn't actually be able to know how different your actions were than any others.  however, the drugs, and gangs, example also tend to fit into the opposite category also, but i mean its not to say there are no exceptions, of course things are circumstancial otherwise, i mean without that the world wouldn't be so vast in possibility.  as for as extreme sports, stunts, and drag racing (just as examples) you know very well by getting involved in these things the extreme risks involved, you have to acknowledge that in order to do it because in most cases you haven't a choice.  the risks are always there, both injuries, and fatalites, most common is obviously injury, but death also occurs just as well. for example the death of dale earnhart during the datona five hundred, or just some of the deaths of football players duing spring/summer training, its just the consequences of putting your body at risk.  now as for the lifestyle of dying, its like living everyday like its your last, i mean it doesn't fall far off from death, but the difference is there...because for instance life isnt the same when you know death is imminent, such as when you're diagnosed with a terminal disease, or condition that limits the longevity of your life (cancer, AIDS/HIV, tumors). obviously at this point the entire basis of life changes drastically, you have to know that no matter when your time is so very limited, you know that is more near, than it is far, as opposed to ""death"" when its just there, but theres no telling when it will come so to speak.  now as for it being applicable to excessive drug use, and gangs, its just that when you do those kinds of things, death is also imminent to where you have to live life like everyday is your last, solely because you're either going to overdose, or obviously be killed in some kind of gang activity.  the drug use is very circumstancial, because obviously a good majority of addicts/users don't have much regard for their own well-being, just their chemical fufillment, or 'good-time' whichever is more suitable.  but gang life for the most part, is a day-to-day process being the actions of most are ruthless, and careless of their own, and others saftey, because its obviously the lifestyle they chose, or were forced into.  but either way, you have the hindering burden of dying constantly right before you, more so than just living an average scaled life, you know it could be any second you're going to die because there's no such saftey measures to be taken, or anything that can be done to prevent an illness from claiming your existence. well, thats my theory, as far as i can see it, if you have an arguement to contradict that, by all means, speak up. i'd love to hear what you have to say as long as its logical."

"event","somtimes you just tend to get stumped by some things that go on in this world, just completely unable to understand why. theres alot of things...so you can't really narrow it down to anything specific, but just since i kinda realized this shit today, i just feel obligated to address it.  but there are really alot of people in this world whom just have absolutely no respect for authority, or just even anything at all for that matter.  i mean i see people that just don't give a shit about anything but themselves, like they're protecting their lives every second of the day. don't get me wrong there are certainly circumstances where maybe you have to be that way, weather or not their right or wrong reasons, they still exist...but even if, you still have the choice of lifestyle, or things you get involved with that put you in these situations.  if you don't walk into them, you won't be in that position, it really is that simple...but the real fact of it all is that, you have these completely ruthless people that just live their lives as they wish that just care not in the world for anything else, or anyone else. for instance some person i know, is/was married to a man whom is in a particular motor cycle 'club' or what they use in place of gang.  so yeah, to begin with thats pretty sketchy because everyone knows for the most part that these types of things certainly don't contribute much to society as a whole...but anyhow, he was just released from prison a year ago for shooting and i believe killing someone at a bar because of something stupid like the kid kept bumping into him.  so, he served his prison sentence, comes out after over a decade, and now carrys a loaded gun with him at all times...being on parole, i tend to think you'd most likely not be able to do that; apparently he doesn't care. now about a few months ago, there was an issue with another gang blah blah all that shit, so they found out where they hang out and did a drive by: meanwhile theres actually children inside the house.  its just people like that, with no care for anything, and are willing to just do these types of things, just because.  in their own words, logically you can justify these things...but in the overall world we live in, it just makes it a worse place to live.  it just doesn't make sense to me why people have to be that way, and just always have to be so primitive, and destructive.  another example, just before i came home tonight we were driving down the street, and this person stood dead in the middle of the street, as to where we basically couldn't pass...and just kept walking, and right when we got about 5 feet away from him, he moves out of the way and seemed to have a whole attitude about it, like ""i'm so tough, i probably have a gun so that makes me stronger than you."" whats the point of that, when we were complete strangers, you don't know driving down a street where theres no reason you can't drive down it. i personally can't see a real reason for people to have such pissed off attitudes all the time...if someone can explain this to me, or relate, please feel free to let me know, because i'm truely curious..."

"event","we train our children to kill....we hand them our best gun and have them point it at the opposition.  the sight of blood is only a sign of success, and no longer a crime. sometimes punishable by execution.  we have created a machine consisting of the sons and daughters of proud parents that only tried to teach their child the right way of life.  now, they kill, and its alright, and we glorify them for their doings.  then they die, and death is a tragedy, when we've placed them in circumstances where death is an immenent threat, far more than in everyday life.  its pretty far fetched to imagine this world without war, and so frequently we speak of such peace to be throughout, yet its just an expression, and everyone takes it for granted like somehow this is all possible.  its one of so many things that exist that have absolutely no logic, yet they allow themselves to be widely accepted and embraced as possibility, when there isn't such a way for it to be accomplished.  seemingly all efforts to begin a 'peace process' so to speak, only seems to further result in turmoil.  since, the united states has more than obviously become the worlds police force, amongst the intruders on cultures we know nothing of (not that this is anything different, lets just look at what we did with the indians in the beginning stages of america)  and we attempt to turn these places into democracy, and automatically expect it to work because it works here. yet so far in all better known situations, we've been complete failures...and somehow have brought the heat back on ourselves. two better examples would be...giving our 'aid' to install a man named <b>Fidel Castro</b> into power on the island of cuba...and now the country has fallen apart, and become more worse than it was.  not only is the government rule, completely communist, but we've made a large effort to improve something and failed miserably.  so then what happens? eventually, under a communist reign, cuba makes and effort to harbor nuclear weapons from the also communist soviet union, also known as <b>USSR</b> or now <b>Russia</b> shortly after world war two, and the seperate capture of german nuclear scientists. which also lead to the cold war, due to the ever existing presense of the soviets in germany, post world war two.  eventually, that situation would all boil to an end in the late 1980's/early 1990's, but regardless, cuba is still struggling under the rule of castro (and every presidential candidate since has promised to better the situation with that country, and still hasn't).  now secondly, we've also helped out a force we've all become a little <i>too familiar</i> with, and that would be the <b>Taliban</b>, and its powerful leader <b>Osama Bin Laden</b> whom we all now know has quite an infamous and relentless way of acting.  again just making matters worse, for both the countries we've attempted to help, and ourselves, we've just enabled people to have more modernized ways of living, and better control over the overall population with just a bit of help from the great country called the united states of america, such prestigious place it is...everything domestically there, is just so perfect and in order.  yet we have problems both socially, and economically, that generally most countries don't. so now, not only do we install these people into power, giving them sums of money, and weaponry, but then in the end they turn on us and cause terror to not just our governement, but the general population of the country, whom have done nothing to deserve the result of their actions.  september eleventh (which by the way is also my birthday) was just proof about how those actions took a toll on undeserving parties, however, the basis of their actions seemed to be far more than just killing innocent people, but destroying the <b>WORLD TRADE CENTER, and PENTAGON</b> some people get caught up in the fact nearly 3,000 people died that day, if not more...and don't realize that the reason these targets were chosen was not just because of how big they were in structure, and the amounts of people vulnerable to death. but, the fact that it disabled our country as a whole, amongst other places.  more than obviously, the world trade center not only dealt with domenstic finances, but also international, from many other world power countries (france, germany, UK, spain).  with the destruction of that, it would certainly completely downsize our economy, which was already starting to decline in value, and this would cause us to struggle, and possibly reach the point of a depression (not the emotional sense). then to disable a place such as the pentagon, which is a central command for our military forces/defenses, and then another missed target was the white house, which i believe was the first choice of the flight that 'took out' a portion of the pentagon....these targets were strictly mapped to diable our country as a whole, and make us more vulnerable than we already were, because obviously without them we haven't very much, and they're not so easily replaced, or able to be turned into something make-shift, while in the process of restructuring them. for that exact reason, you can see our overall struggle right now economically, well, besides the fact our president is a fucking complete idiot, the epitome of one, at that.  this is what we get for being forceful, and trying to install a new way of life for other countries, and now that congress has decided to pass the bill to give eighty-seven billion dollars toward the rebuilding of iraq (which we pointlessly destroyed more than we should have) just imagine what a country that is a bit more 'rich' persay will be able to do when they decide they don't like american anymore (not to say they like us very much to begin with)  so you can expect your friends, and loved ones, and overall glorious military forces to be dying for meaningless causes alot more in the near future. which kinda makes you think nostradamus might be right about the force of death rising and causing world war three to occur on or around the year 2023.  i guess time will tell that story, but it seems to be unfolding already.  lets just hope his quatrain stands if its going to happen, and the occurance of something like that doesn't come premature..so atleast for now we could semi-enjoy the quality of life, aside from our everyday fears, and obstacles."

"event","i don't have much to say for this subject, (wow) except that finally there are efforts being made to remove the phrase <b>'one nation under god'</b> from the pledge. the same pledge i was forced to stand for regardless of my disbelief in such a god. it's completely ridiculous that i would actually have been threatened for not standing, or saluting the flag while they spoke of such a thing. even as small as the reference may be, its still there, and its not what i believe...there is no seperation there when its forced upon me in such a way.  it actually had to go to the point where i was suspended because i finally stopped giving into them and got into a very heated altercation with my highly religious teacher, which then led to me telling her to ""fuck a crucifix.""  was i wrong for taking it there? yes, to a degree, but also no, because my reaction was fed by her consistant whining about god and how i had no choice but to respect him because our country was build around him and this and that. i mean, if god was so fucking great and our country was built around his belief and morals, then i guess this is the best he can do? his system doesn't seem to be working too well, aside from the fact the entire birth of our country was based entirely around murder, which was one of his <i>great</i> commandments. this is another step forward to completely comdemning religion from snaking its way into our everyday against our own will, although these actions have not actually been implemented widely, its starting to make its way, and now someone or someone(s) is/are trying to bring fourth a liberating course of action.  today is certainly a good day, and not because it was the popes 25th anniversary because that old fuck should just die already and stop plaguing television with his bullshit.  they have religious channels for covering this type of shit, it need not be on CNN, and FOX, or whatever networks that covered the whole thing today.  thats just another way to feed us with shit we don't care about, and then we wonder why muslims, and islamics, fucking hate us, besides the fact our government thinks its an international police force...hopefully all goes well with this situation...its certainly one of the greater decisions that have come out of this country...atleast since removing the ten commandments from that court house. good day, and if you don't like what i have to say because you love god. <b>I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU HAVE TO SAY...DON'T WHINE LIKE A LITTLE BITCH ON MY COMMENTS, DON'T TRY TO PROVE ME WRONG, DON'T ARGUE. I DON'T GIVE A SHIT ABOUT YOUR GOD, NOR DO ALOT OF OTHER PEOPLE...SO TAKE YOUR WORLD OF IGNORANCE, AND DIE IN THE CORNER SOMEWHERE.</b>"

"event","well, its been almost a month, which it doesn't feel like its actually been that long, but apparently it has been (6 days short). but anyhow, today at work i started drifting off thinking about how people preach religion, and somewhat force it onto others, and into the mainstream in america. then, since i'm such a creative person, i started putting myself in scenerios with people like that, just thinking of what i would do to put up an opposition...then suddenly it struck me that one of the guys there had mentioned how there was a bible ontop of the air conditioner. so, i took the liberty of taking down the bible and reading it, why? not because i needed to rethink my positions on god, or religion, but to better educate myself on its teachings, because you cannot truely oppose something you know nothing about, or atleast some details. so, although i was raised in a roman catholic family, and forcefully had to attend church, and CCD (jesus loving class) so i've read the bible, and learned of the belief until the 5th grade when more or less i was kicked out of the classes for threatening my teacher, whom mad a rude, and vulgar comment to me and a friend, and then thereafter basically telling the nun who ran the school if she touched me with the ruler i was going to break her face. so, out the window that went, and then soon after i began to realize things, and question relgion, etc etc. even at that age, it was apparent to me that alot of this stuff had no real physical evidence, or proof that any of this shit really happened. so anyhow, since its been atleast 8 years since i've actually read anything in the bible, i decided to start from page one which was obviously ""creation."" so i began reading, remembering most of it from the past, but not that i'm persay, more educated especially as far as english goes, i realized how so very immature the concepts seemed to be. its not as if this bible was a childrens bible, or anything to where it was 'toned down' for better understanding, it was simply the holy bible , in no other terms. like for the creation of life, and the world we live in, it had absolutely no complexity, it was just ""and the Lord God said 'let there be light, and the world lit up.' like not even 'and the Lord said 'let there be light' and a ball of flames burned in the sky"" or something with a little more depth. i mean, that doesn't say much because bibles are just refined from its original form in hebrew, so it could have quite possibly just been one of the most pathetic translations i've ever seen of anything, so i won't even use that as a point. but as i read through, past creation of light, land, water, animals, i got to the story of adam and eve...a story almost any person could tell, but i decided to read it anyway, just to see the actual depiction in the book. the depiction wasn't too shabby, got in all the details, about the rib, etc etc. but then i realized an enormous flaw: amidst going into detail about the creation, of both adam, and his wife eve, and somehow immediately after their creation, and the exact statement of ""the first two of mankind"" somehow a ""servant"" ends up in the picture, to act as a deception to eat the forbidden fruit, on the tree of good and evil. to my perception the ""servant"" was seeming to be satan, protrayed as the evil in the world that will come along, and the whole moral value of acknowledging deception, and blah blah blah. but for the fact directly before it stated they were the first two to inhabit the earth, suddenly theres another being in the picture. that was just one of many strange occurances i came across...so next comes the story of noah's ark. it was said ""the Lord came and told Noah to construct an ark with three floors, with the width of 25 feet, a length of 120 feet, and a height of 45 feet, so that he could preserve two of each animal created, one male, one female"" and also that ""noah may bring his wife, and children, and their wives along, to spare their lives"" because the entire basis of the 40 days and 40 nights of flooding was solely to completely erase existance because the ""Lord God"" considered them to be impure, and sinners, with violent intentions that were against his believe of humanity. and so the time came, and in the end the entire world was completely erased more or less, and only noah was left to inhabit the land, which i believe was 120 days later. the flaw i see in all of this, is that the Lord, someone who created life, decided to take it from everyone, because of their sins, yet right now i think would probably be a much larger, and more impure society, yet there is absolutely no presence of god, besides those that take it upon themselves to act out and take lives themselves (in the name of god). but again, even my own arguement has its flaws, and i see that, but each as i go on makes it stronger...now anyone can say he made life he can take it, and thats understood. so next was that story of moses,a lengthy story, at that...but then came this part about a pharoh in egypt, and the way they slaved israelites, and so god sent moses to the pharoh with someone else, who honestly doesn't matter...heh. and he sent him with the power to do things on gods behalf in order to intimidate them to free the slaves. so he sent him at first, with simple impossible tasks...changing his skin, turning his cane/stick thing into a snake, and upon picking it up, it turned back into a cane. so still he wouldn't, and so it went on and on with other forms of things to prove that god was making this demand, and it kept repeating that god with his hand will lay his presence upon them, and this and that. but seemingly as they resisted and refused to give into all of these things and free the slaves, god more or less god more pissed off and started doing more serious things, that involved killing peoples first born, starting with the pharoh himself, and so on down the line with the egyptian's, to having the land infested with locusts to completely eat up everything in sight, to a large hail storn that destroyed their crops, and ways of food, to killing the livestock...here again is god murdering, because from what i read, it was not as if these people were believers of god, and he never claimed responsibility for their creation...so for one its a good question to know where the fuck they came from, and also why it was that if he were so powerful that it took murder, and destruction to cause these people to give in. its just outrageous that within the first 50 pages of the bible god mass murders, not once, but twice...but then a third time, when after all the abuse from gods 'wrath' the pharoh finally gives in a frees the slaves, their familes, and the livestock, and as they're treking back to israel, god lead them a way in order to avoid war in other countries or whatever, so he took them to the red sea, where the whole parting went on, but most people atleast to my knowledge did not know that, the parting of the red sea wasn't just this miraculous act of god to help moses, and the isrealites, but also in the end, when moses closed the sea, he killed all of the egyptian soldiers that were attempting to come get the slaves back, and it then spoke of the massive amounts of bodies that soon floated ashore, completely lifeless. so now, things went on to the story of the ten commandments and how they were passed down to moses where god specifically states ""you shall not murder"" the exact thing he has repeatedly done up until this point. then ontop of it all, he also states ""you shall not worship any other god but the Lord, for the Lord is a jealous god, and doing so will be punishable in death"" again, something that results in death. i mean just looking at that alone is like, wow, now i understand why people that believe this shit are so fucking stupid. their own god can't even fucking make sense between his actions, and the words of 'wisdom' he spoke. so with all of that in mind, and then noticing the very very consistant presence of god throughout all of this, and the fact that not just moses, and abraham (whom was originally abram) could hear the voice of god, but alot of other people too. now for obvious reasons i did not read the rest of the bible, because its rather lengthy, but i mean for just seeing how much god was present in the first 1/4 of it, it kinda leaves me to wonder why, and when his consistant presence faded. to me, that just seems like a way of covering up that this shit not only never happened, but that there was never such a thing as the lord , god. there is really no other justification for it, or the fact that people like abraham, and moses lived for nearly a century, until god decided 100 years was long enough. i've never seen such shit in my entire life, it is absolutely baffling that people read into this shit and actually believe it, and preach it like its something fucking realistic. its so obvious that this shit is more than fabricated because its such a stretch of the imagination, why would you NOT question it. and then theres the question that, if theres a god, whom if he spoke, was obviously an existance of some sort, who created him, and who created that person...same question posed as for the extent of the universe, which according to the bible was also created by god, to light the sky to distinguish the difference between night and day. is it just ironic that the two most impossible questions to answer immediately are drawn back to god, and his creation of the world? i mean for all the other questions there are, theres a study, or something that can figure it out or prove it, or some kind of an advancement whatever the case may be. but these two eternally ongoing questions with no real answer, are just obvioulsy gods work because we as human beings cannot understand it. just more proof that all god is, is a structure formed to give weakened people some kind of belief that there is something better, and extraordinary out there to give them hope, and allow them to feel as though they have some kind of wisdom reaching down from above them. i mean what if the story or the translation was all wrong, and the one in the open sky was evil, and then the person below was really the good, in the seperation between good and evil. what if satan wasn't the deciever, but god was, being that i've never actually read anything about satan murdering, but just being deceitful, but in these stories thus far, how has god not done both of those things? he has deceived, because he's created a double standard, by telling people what they can and cannot do, but doing it himself. if you ask me thats more evil that being deceitful. the moral of the story is, religion is complete bullshit, its certainly comparable to people that believe deeply in starwars, or startrek or something, where they actually put themselves in the role of these people because of their deep obsession with it. i think that it unquestionably relates to religion in the regard that, people are so wrapped up on what god said, and did according to this book, that they play the role of the follower, and created a world around all of it. the principal in both religion, and the geeky starwars/startrek obsessors, is exactly the same, so i think that says alot for what god really is, and the role he plays in everyday society. HE just doesn't exist, never has, never will, and quite frankly i'm sick of seeing his name painted all over everything...money, patriotic songs, the pledge of allegance, political slogans, its just fucking ridiculous. people seriously need to wake the fuck up, and end this shit already...its gone on for long enough, and if god is so fucking powerful, if people turn on him, he might do something to prove himself, then everyone can have their questions answered. but instead, stop believing in it when you can't prove it to yourself beyond a reasonable doubt. and fuck jesus too....<b>he should have been a blowjob.</b>"

"event","somewhere in new york city, it was being proposed i believe, that they either will be or are building a highschool solely for gays and lesbians. i find that to be a very good thing, not that there should be that kind of segregation, but there is an excessive amount of abuse and violence against gays in our 'great' country. an institution such as this would not only bring them a safer environment, but also allow them to feel more comfortable with whom they are. consequently, i'm sure this would also allow them to be better focused, more productive, and less stressed about being cast aside from others. lets face it, homosexuals are just as rejected as 'geeks', or 'goths' or any other non-typical group. especially, in a highschool, where kids tend to really develop into their own-self (well in some cases). in the same aspect people diversify and change, and there are few human beings that like drastic change such as that. so its very highly unlikely an adolescent would be able to accept going to school with a person, for 5-10 years or however long, getting dressed infront of them for gym, then finding out they find interest in the same sex. i myself can logically understand the obvious discomfort drawn from a situation like that, theres no question about that. however, whats left questionable is peoples actions thereafter: baseless acts of violence, vandalism, verbal assaults, abandonment. people seem to have a severe problem accepting people that differ from themselves (not excluding myself). but the real problem is that people actually devote their attention to the differences. this country, above all else is THE most diverse of all (not in all areas) by color, ethnicity, belief, lifestyles, etc. yet somehow we can't accept people that are not heterosexual, as most may be. for a country that speaks of freedoms, and almost unconditionally individuality, who are we...the general public to criticize, torment, and assualt someone for their sexual preference? although, i am not a homosexual, and i may not believe in what these people do, i <b>DO NOT</b> think that they shouldn't be allowed to have their own lifestyle, or that any person has the right to look down upon them. it would be alot more understanable if their ways, and lifestyles actually affected anyone, but besides peoples meaningless discomforts, it harms no one. now, in turn for this idea or intention (with the school), protestors from OUTSIDE of new york state and NYC, arrived yesterday to oppose its creation. as i listened to the radio this morning, someone from the howard stern show actually interviewed some of the protestors. i honestly sat in complete disbelief when i heard a 7 year old girl speaking of her hate for ""faggots"", and when asked why she disliked them so greatly she aptly replied ""because GOD hates faggots."" then when asked why she thought god hated homosexuals she replied that ""in the book of...(who gives a shit) it was stated that god does not like faggots"" and just as she concluded her response in the recording you could hear people coaching her, whom were presumably her parents. i couldn't have felt any more sickened than i was at that very moment, to know parents are teaching young children these kinds of things. there we also two other people interviewed, one being a 12 year old girl, and the other an older male. the girl, said primarily the same thing, mentioning many times this verse in the bible. the man, went into great detail of how the word ""faggot"" was birthed in the bible, and again how god hates fags and that they are all going to hell, etc. besides the fact this is such an absolutely terrible thing (based on a god that doesn't exist) i found a strikingly odd detail that was similar between the three intreviews: all 3 persons had southern-accents, none of which lived in NYC, and all had mentioned this verse in the bible, which might i add is aimed at procreation, not anti-homosexuality. its peoples terrible excuse for perception that twists these things into what they are. anyhow, both of these things lead me to my point of non-diversified areas, and more specifically to The Westboro Baptist Church, in Topeka, Kansas--this would be the same church that not only hosts the website www.godhatesfags.com, but also held a <b>DEMON</b>stration at the funeral of Matthew Shephard, a college student maliciously murdered because of his homosexuality. now who in the right mind has the audacity to do something as disprespectful as that? now unfortunately because of this organizations backing from a church, their actions are completely permissable in the eyes of the law. this is a very unfortunate circumstance because this shit has to be STOPPED. its one thing to stand up for your beliefs, buts its another to disrespect the perished, and their family at their funeral. it is my understanding that this group has had nearly 20,000 <b>DEMON</b>strations in the past 9 years, including one known case at a hate crime/murder victims funeral."

"event","there has been alot of controvery lately in the news, and i feel more than obligated to ramble on about it...and that would be all the shit based around the catholic religion. first, you have the priest whom was murdered in jail after being convicted on about 150 sexual assault charges, and then the removal of the ten commandments from a federal courtroom. firstly, i'm going to go into the priest, because thats the more simple of the two. They have turned a daily occurance of murder inside prisons into some kind of national ordeal, all because it was a priest whom was recently convicted. i find that to be pretty shitty considering what the man did, and suddenly they're turning it into an investigation, as if they turn any other murder in a prison into an investigation. on an average scale, no one cares enough to investigate and spend time and money--these people are obviously locked away for a reason, these are the kinds of things people expect to happen in there. this man, a convicted sex offender was certainly going to be a prime target in a prison, again--something everyone is to expect...his life span was NOT going to be long in a place such as that. now they want to put the blame on correctional officers for not doing their jobs, and this and that. no one knows what actually went on inside that prison except the guards, and the inmates, basically...what it comes down to is, correctional officers endanger themselves on a daily basis to attempt, and i stress attempt to keep some kind of order inside these prisons. its not exactly easy to be a team of persay 45 guards (which mind you i spread out all inside and outside the prison) and have to be faced with people whom have killed in cold blood, and that are serving life sentences, so therefore have nothing to lose...can't say its one of the top places to work, and we're going to try to point the finger on them because a man died, who gives a shit? i'm glad he's dead, i'm glad that tax dollars aren't going to some sick dimented fuck, to feed, and house, and protect him from other inmates. the right thing happened, as inhumane as it was, it happened, and it probably played out alot better than an actual death setence would have...so why does it matter who did it, how it happened, and why? a person like that doesn't deserve to breathe, nor waste our hard earned money we're raped of every pay check, and every april. people need to stop giving a shit about the worthless and move on to bigger and better things, because there are plenty, and we're too busy looking at stupid shit like this fucking pedophile...

now as for the controversy over the ten commandments being removed from a federal courthouse...i've read alot of bullshit complaints both in the opinionary section of the newspaper, and hearing lawmakers, and politicians complaining about this shit. as they argue that the constitution was founded on christianity, and how the law written about the seperation between church and state, actually never specificially pushed it in the direction that people are now pushing it in. granted, people may have their own beliefs, and own religions...but when you're going somewhere public such as that, which IS NOT a venue for religion, what exactly the purpose to publicly display it? of course its wrong, because catholics of all people are by far the most manipulated by their worthless piece of shit excuse for a religion. not to say i feel any other religions are better, but i find alot of bullshit within catholicism more than anything else i've seen. i'm so sick and tired of hearing people bitch about their fucking religion and god, if anything the seperation of church should be seperated from everything EXCEPT church...because its starting to flood into every aspect of everything, and i as a nihilist, and obvious non-believer, am sick and fucking tired of hearing this shit everywhere. then, also in high school being FORCED to stand for the pledge of alligiance, something that contains the word GOD, and as i refused i was threatened with suspesion. i found that to be pretty extreme considering i live in a country where i have the right to stand up for what i believe, and regardless of whether or not i was standing in salute of it, it still contained something i do NOT believe in, therefore, i believe i have the right to not have to acknowledge something such as that. so, now we have this up and rising issue about public display of GOD, and catholicism, and the ten commandments, and all this shit, when there is no fucking point in argueing. if you fucking believe in something who the fuck needs a statue at a courthouse to commend it? you don't see statues of allah, or jah, or whatever the fuck else people believe in, in our very versitile country. so all you fucking god loving faggots need to stop bitching about the minor details and respect other people, as you're fucking taught to, but apparently you're all too fucking ignorant to realize your blatant disrespect by flashing your false god around in everyones face. if i were to burn a cross WITH jesus on it, in order to express my beliefs, i'm quite sure i'd be arrested, beaten, assualted, or killed by one of you fucks, and what makes that wrong of me to do if thats what i believe? why is it that i cannot stand up for my belief without recieving some kind of 'consequence' as you receive yours for fucking plastering your religion everywhere you can: shopping malls, steet corners, bumper stickers, protests, i've even seen fucking BILLBOARDS. the ignorance you portray through your shallow, and selfish actions just proves alot about what you believe in, if ignorance wasn't such a bliss and you had the ability to realize anything, you might realize just how foolish you are all for something you can't even prove, besides some bullshit book anyone could have written. also, just looking at the way language has progressed over time, i find it interesting that these intepretations from the original language could even be THAT accurate. it kind of reminds me of rumors, as it gets passed from person to person the story gets altered, and dramatized, and exaggerated...seems to me like that goes for your bible...

"event","today, while reading through the newspaper, painfully i came to a realization. something not only overlooked by myself, but most likely by the vast majority of people in this world. atleast those whom don't contribute to the growing rate of hysteria, and chaos in our slowly disintegrating society. but upon my acknowledgement of this issue i couldn't feel anything else but absolutely helpless. to think that the entire world (atleast developed civilization) relies so much on agreements: treaties, pacts, etc. nothing but wordy documentations, and signatures of people no different from you and me aside from their politcal status, and level of education. looking at that alone and the way deep down as the world expands we all just want more for ourselves. which, to me, kind of paints a very difficult picture. just to see the (still growing) political differences within our own country; its spreading like a plague. what if the day came when everything everyone said they would do, or abide by just become entirely meaningless? for instance, we have an ongoing uphill battle in israel, and palistine; a territorial war perpetuating since the seperation. everyday innocent people die in bombings and militant attacks from both opposing sides, all for what? religion, and the dire need for more, countless(and thats not an understatement) peace agreements have been made; most rejected, all the rest entirely failed. why? because no ONE person can make a decision for an entire group, especially a group and issue who's entire basis is religion. there are many conquerable obstacles, but religion is by far not one of them. the fatal act may very well be condemned by most (if not all) religious morals, but then there is ""god will forgive you"" and stories of martyrdom, none of which can be physically proven. but as long as people are fighting, killing, and dying for their non-existant god(s): death will mean absolutely nothing. as long as they believe in their minds that there is an after-life, or that it is peaceful, or even that they will be reincarnated, the cold-blooded suicide bombings and attacks will never cease. which in turn is a small (yet very large) example of just how sensitive the world is, and the if for any reason the UN were to fall to pieces and prior commitments and regulations were abandoned or disregarded, the entire world would swallow itself whole. (which goes back to my prior theory) but as long as we have wealthy (and obviously greedy) running this country and making international decisions, their greed, and lack of empathy will cause them to act wrongly and make people very hostile out of resent, and hatred. a national example would be the bush tax cuts that better benefit those with the money (such as himself) and not so much those without it. easily the plan could have left out those whom have or earn large amounts of money. but did it? no. why? greed. its that simple, and these are the people we've elected to better benefit us. HAH. there is absolutely no reason that the wealthy couldn't have been left out of this plan, unfair? how is it not...the purpose of the tax cuts were to 'put more money in americans pockets, to spend' to better the weakened economy, which by the way was at its peak in the year 2000, which i recall was also the year the bush was elected into office...(irony? i think not) although, i cannot personally say much positive about most politicians in general, to look at the realism of the issue, bill clinton (a democrat) ran our country for 8 years, and in those eight years he lead our country to a great amount of prosperity. although, he had done many questionable things, aside from his world famous blowjob, he still made our lives better than they had been in a long time: gasoline prices were at an all-time low, the national unemployment percentage was nearly under 2%, which econmincally thats almost unsafe because almost everyone was employed. however, if you look at class levels in america, that two percent were the lazy peice of shit welfare collecting low-lives. this is NOT to say that all on welfare are of that variety, but theres a large percentage that just collect it, and don't bother getting a fucking job. so, overall those two things alone are absolutely incredible feats, and thats something to certainly commend him for doing. but then, the wonderful, smart americans we are, elect this dumb elephant looking mother fucker into office, his father fucking sucked, what allowed people to think he would have done a better job? now he's not only destroyed our country, but ruined another two also...and now we're spending OUR hard earned money to repair those countries because of his wreckless military forces. then, with not one of these GREAT, PATRIOTIC americans realizing, we haven't killed Bin Laden, nor do we even know if we killed sadaam, because the force we used to kill him was far too great to even leave a likelyhood of finding his cadaver. so now this SPECTACULAR, and WELL PLOTTED war effort, has easily allowed this man to slip between the cracks, and more or less leave people to believe he's dead, and instead live on without a single person knowing. that thought alone leaves me feeling pretty uncomfortable, especially being the great amounts of money this man has, he is certainly still capable of great things, especially with an alliance to terrorist oranizations such as al-queida (fuck the spelling) that could be a very devistating force under his fundings. which also, leads to my bigger point that at any time our entire structure could simply collapse as and international community, and at that, chaos would be our only way of living, and although america is considered to have the greatest army of all in this world, when it comes to the fight for survival in a destructing world...generally speaking, most people in our country don't have the ability to survive without their bullshit materialism. we are by far the weakest as far as our inner-society, and population goes, we are all so consumed with ourselves, and materialism that if it came down to survival of the fittest, atleast 45% of the population wouldn't make it through the fight. if ever, for any reason there was war on our own soil, that exact percentage would have no idea what to do, besides hide, and hope it will be over, and they'll survive. look at the countries i used as an example, israel, palestine...these two alone could defeat us in an instance, without a shadow of a doubt. every second of their lives they have to wonder if they're going to die without any notice, if when they go somewhere they'll be in the way of a suicide bombing, or car bombing, or whatever the case may be. they might have to face these things, but i can assure you, that doesn't stop them from proceeding with their lives, if we had such a threat here...people would be running for the hills, and locking their doors and windows, and praying to their god(s) that they don't fall a victim. americans know no true fear, just look, the only actual attack on our territory wasn't even in the continental US, it was in hawaii, 2000 miles off the coast. i could even bet a majority of people don't even know the issues going on in our world right now JUST BECAUSE they're too involved with what they're going to wear tomorrow, and what they have to do, and all that useless bullshit that makes us weak. living your life in one thing, but living in ignorance is an completely different issue, and thats the point i'm making. in one single second, one hours time, one day, one week, this entire world could unfold into absolute bloodbath, and a good majority of people wouldn't even know it was coming. imagine having to live like the people do in israel, and palestine (my two examples**) and just imagine if it were that way here, how would you feel everyday not knowing whats going to happen, and knowing theres someone out there ready to die for their cause, and you just might be in their path? you might be able to hide from your fear, but you can't hide from death...and when death surrounds you, you just might be the victim...you can be ignorant and run, but you'll die before those that stand up and fight back, because the ones that can take on the world of hurt, or the ones with the heart to prevail. if you don't die in the battle, you'll die in the war, you'll die in the end when your precious house is burning, and your best friend is face down in a pool of their own blood. the day you have to stand in a place that looks so unfamiliar because what was so perfect and peaceful, is a pile of debris, and a ground for death. it seems so pretty far fetched, and so impossible, but if it were to begin, if a REAL world war were to spawn, who would stop it? if you have no friends, all you have is enemies, and with the growth of anti-american sentiment within the most hostile of countries, this possibility only grows larger, and closer to happening. oh, and lets not forget about nuclear warfare, and chemical weapons...the growing threat extends, and when in our country alone if that were to happen, life won't be so perfect anymore when you have to kill to ensure your own survival, or when you have no choice to die, either in, or after a nuclear blast...you might survive the initial explosion by some strike of luck, but lets not forget about nuclear winters and 'black rain' (which would be radiation raining from the clouds) you'd have no choice to die. and as my last point...a great majority of americans DO NOT vote in presidential elections, please realize that if you DO NOT vote, there is a good chance that someone within the system WILL cast a vote for you, and due to the great numbers of votes put through in each state, and each area, you can bet your ass its possible WITHOUT it being noticed anywhere. if you don't like politics, and don't like voting, well besides the fact you're an asshole for not caring who runs the country, atleast look at it like, would you want someone using YOUR name to elect someone just because THEY like them? also ask yourself, do you like paying now nearly 2.00 a gallon for gas? or the growing rate of taxes, and insurance rates, and the way everything is begining to cost more? well, if someone uses YOUR vote to elect someone such as george bush into office to fuck up our country faster that it would if we let a fucking disabled 9 year old run it, this will just get worse. so watch some fucking debated, read into some fucking canidates, and vote for someone that isn't a complete fucking idiot like our current president, because weather you'd like to believe it or not, its HIS decisions that have let our country slip into this fucking recession, fucking stand up and do something and stop letting us get raped because of some invalent, incompitent, arrogant, rich asshole call the fucking shots...if you wanan fucking care about something in your pathetic shit excuse for a life wrapped in materialism, think about the hardworking people that allow you to have a fucking easy life, and allow you to own a cell phone, and drive a fucking nice car, that give you fucking water, and heat, and air conditioning, and all that bullshit, and think about how they get raped because the money they make means shit in an economy where the US DOLLAR is worth roughly .75 cents on the world market. these people bust their asses to keep this world running, beyond the fucking government, and they get shitted on, and don't get to enjoy the fruits of life because they're too busy making our lives easier, meanwhile they can barely fucking afford to live in a nice house, or drive a nice car, or can't spend time with their fucking families because they're working 18 hour days 7 days a week, these exact people are being hurt the most by our economical distress, and thats bullshit...they're the ones that deserve to take their fucking earnings and enjoy that because they worked for it, and instead not only is it not worth barely anything, but half of it is taken by the government so they can fix two fucking countries we destroyed with EXCESSIVE force. we spend more money on two days in the war, then we did on anything else to better our own country...just keep that in mind...because your tax dollars are paying for this shit. if you don't like what i have to say about this economy, and our fucking shitty excuse for a president, then fuck yourself, and everyone associated with you, if you're a republican, especially FUCK YOURSELF, you are more fucking worthless than the exact people we wage war on, and you should fucking be dead just like a large amount of them. yeah, im done."

"event","everything just seems to circulate, however it may be--its as if the only thing that ever changes is time, and your state of mind and understanding. you grow older, your perception of the things that occur matures, or distorts, depending on how well you learn from the past. but in the end, you're still living the same cycle over and over again...theres only one way to change anything that occurs, and thats to change yourself, but atleast from my own experience thats the last thing anyone ever thinks of. the first one we all tend to blame is ourselves, but the last thing that can be considered any kind of a possible solution is ourselves, as if that makes any kind of logical sense. its more like, its so much easier to blame ourselves, and look down upon it, because we feel the need to put ourselves deeper into sorrow, and really engrave the pain in even more...whether or not we actually consciously see it, it's more than obviously happening. we all do it, and that includes myself, its just the realization now that this is whats actually occuring repeatedly, and somehow in the end we're left to wonder what happened, and how we got into the situation to begin with, and just about every detail of it. then, as a way of healing, we tend to drift off into other groups of people (since the basis of most pain is through other peoples actions) when all we're doing is putting ourselves in the same situation, with just different faces, and personalities in the mix. it seems to work, the atmosphere changes, the things you do are different, the places you go, how you do things, how you talk, everything...but the one thing is, we're all still the same people living in the same fucked up world, dealing with the same problems in a circular fashion. now, if we had any kind of sense of the world, we'd realize amidst it all that in reality its our own judgement(s) that lead us to where we go, and that being the same people we are, it makes us more liable to draw the same outcomes eventually. for instance: if you're the type of person that as soon as someone talks behind you back, you consider them so horrible, and it makes you so mistrusting you completely avoid them at all costs, and grow an enourmous disliking for them. then naturally you pick apart their every flaw just so you have more of a reason to hate them. well, here's a little something to look at...people will always have something to say behind you back, you will always piss someone off at some point in time, or do something that causes them to have something to say...realize the fact they do that, is solely because your actions emotionally affected them enough to have to say things about you when you're not even present. be glad that they care enough to say these things, and take their time to do so...it should be more flattering than anything else. not to be mistaken, people that hate you will certainly talk shit about you, and the will be the exact people you should infact write off, and do what you have to do...but doing it to every single person is only putting yourself at loss. the reason the cycle never seems to end, is because you never change your methods, you never take every situation as it is, sometimes theres people that secretly hate you, but those exact people are the people you should probably hate first because i'm sure just how shady they are bleeds through their skin as if you traced their vains with razors. as for the others, you have to look at them as people and as how they are themselves, instead of just looking at everything like its something only written from your own perspective. life is not a story book, or a fairy-tale, nor a grim story of a prolonged death...it's simply what you create of it, and there is nothing in this world that could stand against such. the only things that happen to you are the things you allow to happen, and the choices you make that leave you in the situations you've put yourself in from the start. then, by just starting over, or whatever your method may be, you're just putting yourself right back where you started in most cases, and just bound to live through the same exact experiences, just with the modifications of different personalities, and people, that makes it a variant, and makes it seem like life has went on ever since the first time, or whatever time it was before the current. just put it all into perspective, take the time to actually think about everything thats happened, and the actions on your own part that have contributed to your situation, and then maybe how that could have drawn what it has out of the situation to bring it to its current stand point. then start from there, and take things into consideration that maybe you were wrong, possibly you can correct what stands now, and if not take it onto the future and realize the next time the situation comes, and then things will be different. that is the way the cycle changes, consideration, and self-improvement...you cannot live through the same cycle if you get past the obstacles that have brought you down before, its simply impossible. you might come across, new and different situations, but you can't expect the obstacles to ever end, because they'll always be there, its just all about how you handle them, and how you react. hopefully my own realizations, written in a form of a 'lesson' so to speak make some kind of sense...if not, ey fuck you...i don't care. these are my fucking thoughts. motha fucka."

"event","sometimes you could just get to this point that no matter what, and no matter how many people you're around on a daily basis, or that you are just involved with in general--that you could still feel so very alone in the world. its really hard to actually comprehend how this actually happens. as far as my own view goes, to me, i just feel like its so hard to be understood in someone elses eyes. also, that its extremely hard to actually be able to lay out what you're thinking and have them still understand completely. because just think, regardless when you sit down to break something down for someone, or try to have them see inside your mind, they tend to (in most cases) just somewhere along the lines say ""yeah i completely understand."" But a majority of the time they turn the situation into something of their own, its good to relate...there isn't anything wrong with that but, most of the time they get so lost in venting their own problem(s), or their very own situation that the only thing they end up understanding is more about their own situation, with an outsiders insight. then, in the end your effort only becomes something beneficial on their part. although, a conclusion or an understanding seems to be drawn from the situation, soon after the person tends to contradict the entire thing, and do something against it, or that goes to show you never actually made your point to begin with. when that happens to me, it just feels like such a huge slap in the face, because i'm not sure what is worse, being misunderstood, or failing at trying to make someone actually see things from your own perspective. then when you finally seem to come across any one person, or persons capable of doing so it just seems like they never become anything more than someone in the distance, either shortly before you can get to that depth, or sometime after you reach that depth and it makes the entire process completely pointless. its extremely hard to even let a person in to the point where you actually allow them to understand you as you really are, and not just the information you present on an average scale, but the information that contains so many things, and the explanations for why you are who you are, and why you like what you like, and the way you think, and why you think that way. its pretty hard to even fathom why anyone would want to get to such a depth to just slowly disappear into the distance, unless its just the subconscious pushing the person to the outskirts out of insecurity. i mean, it could be so many things...but either way the end result is an absolute loss of time and nothing ever compensates for it. so here i'm left feeling this overhwhelming amount of just loneliness, trying to find a way to explain to myself, even..that its possible to feel like this although i'm not too alone.(how fucking emo, huh?) i just want so bad to have my life set to the point where i'm not still blindly walking through the world looking for the right people, and the right places to be, having my own life and no longer living at home or around my family. i know it's really a pipe dream right now, but i just feel like things would be so much easier, and its not at all to under-estimate the people that i'm around for the most part, because the ones i do know, and i am close to are obviously all that for a reason. it's just that for the most part we're all so different in so many ways that its hard for me to enjoy myself sometimes because of those differences. i go out with my friends that i've known for more years than i can count on my hands, and all we do is listen to rap, and that for instance is just irritating after a while, i mean i like some of it. but, in the end i can't sit there and listen to all this rap shit all fucking night, but i get stuck having no choice...and to me, music is a huge part of my life. a part that i'm involved with every single day, somehow, someway, because i love what i listen to(and what i make) with a very strong passion. so, thats atleast to me, an important connection to have, because rap is such a redundant genre, some of it is amazing, and the rest of it just all sounds the same, and they even use other peoples 'beats' and put their own words and/or flows to it. its cool sometimes because they have that whole 'remix' shit, and just whatever else...but one specific beat is the beat to ""quiet storm"" by mobb deep...i think i've heard about 90 different people use that beat to put their own words to it, and its just so fucking ghey. but this also isn't to be mistaken, my friends that this all applies to right now (as far as rap goes) are my friends, basically my blood...they will be my friends until death, and i will fight with/for them until the day i die. there isn't a shadow of a doubt about that...and this weekend definitely exemplified that all very well. but my real point is that, this is growing up, and although our entire lives we've all been the same, done the same things, this is where the path goes in different directions and you have to eventually go your own way and do you own thing and meet new people that fit to what you are, and what you do...its a long tiresome process and theres no question about that. quite possibly, that could be the reason i am in the position i'm in right now, who knows."

today was an interesting day, quite a few places have lost their electricity...in both america and canada its pretty fucking interesting i must say. however, i find it hard to believe that it was some kind of 'glitch' or 'overload' as they've put it, being that the power has nearly been out for 12 hours. They've ruled out the entire possibility of terrorism, but lets look at the reality...they can't even explain what has gone wrong...yet they can say that it was not terror related, why? because no one has died yet? look at the facts, if it was terror related why the fuck would they tell us? so people can become 'terrified' (no pun intended) with no power, its pretty hard to really control anything, being that everything runs off of electricity. so, lets think...no power + a reason to be scared shitless = MASS HYSTERIA. just looking at that alone kind of proves theres a pretty good possibility we're just not learning all of the facts. I mean, being that i'm infact a skeptic, thats why i am left to question the validity of the information we're being given...but at the same time theres also a very logical structure to believe that the information may very well be misleading, solely for the safety, and to leave peoples nerves at ease. not to at all say that the decision wasn't exactly the smartest, because infact it was probably the smartest thing the government's done in quite a while should that be the case...because being that people don't believe they are in any real danger, it leaves them to just feel casual and not react in a way that could easily play itself out in the 'domino effect' and causing people to completely act out their antics, out of fear, and confusion. on the other side of the spectrum, had this actually been an accident, it just enables any kind of terrorist to easily position themselves better due how vulnerable it leaves us in that stand point without electricity. that can leave me in no other place but to wonder whom is taking advantage of the situation, because in most cases there would be lootings, and other types of criminal activities because of how vulnerable we really are. but now, with so much anti-american sentiment and threats being passed through whatever sources--atleast the threats that are being presented to us publicly. a gaping whole in the system such as this leaves alot of room to actually get passed whatever security obstacles they may have come across under regular circumstances. in my own, cold, cold heart, i still hope that this isn't the situation and one of those camel riding mother fuckers don't get that bright idea, or atleast actually succeed. it was mad enough having to realize just how vulerable we were on my own birthday when thousands of innocent lives had to be lost. no one will ever be able to forget about that day, and thats obvious...but for me it scarred me far more just because of how politically charged i am, and because it had to happen on my birthday, and now for the rest of my life any given time i tell someone my birthday, they're going to mention that fatal day. so as though many will be reminded forever, those that were directly effected, and those that just had to watch in complete shock, and feel the rest of the things that had to come along with it have to remember because of what it took from them. but me, i have to remember that my birthday was the day where there were the most casulties from any kind of attack. not to cry out and say that i feel more trauma than anyone else, because that is by far ridiculous, i was in no way effected by that day directly, except for it being my birthday. however, the main point is that the entire tragedy could have been prevented if the government wasn't too busy trying to find ways to better themselves, and other fucking countries with problems when we have more of our own, just more modernized problems. people are starving in somolia....lets send help there so they don't die, meanwhile we'll let our economy slip through the cracks and people will lose their jobs and their lives and end up trying to leave off the street begging for change, or living in some shithole with only a mattress and a fucking lamp, that probably doesn't even work, or living in a fucking alley somewhere. so, while they struggle, and have no choice but to beg, and steal, and do whatever they can to live, we'll fucking feed a bunch of people that DON'T PAY TAXES, DON'T LIVE IN AMERICA, probably DON'T LIKE AMERICA, and while we pay for them to get the little bit of food they get, back here at home we have people dying, and starving every single day. but instead, its a better more generious thing to do when we take care of other countries because it makes us look more 'friendly' except us butting our fucking noses in everyone else's business is the exact reason those people died on that day, in the long run. yes, religion was the biggest, most manipulative part of the entire plot because that is what impowered these people to believe that their deaths would be appreciated, and that they would be reincarnated or however the belief goes (i know it's something of that sort) but in the long run, they would have had no other reason to hate us besides the way our country has effected them. if we never said anything, or did anything, this wouldn't have happened, they'd have no other reason to do these things. mind you, this was long before the war in iraq, which was also another poor display of american power, and just how disorderly we really are. look at how we attacked with the plan or movement called ""shock and awe"" well i'm pretty sure they were extremely shocked when we dropped 1200 bombs in a 48 hour period, and killed a shit load of innocent people in the midst of it all, because naturally we don't have 100 percent accuracy. i'm not quite the humanitarian, peoples deaths don't really affect me, its an everyday thing...but lets look at it this way, look how we all felt september 11th, especially the people in new york, and washington, but mostly new york since the most trauma was caused there...now imagine that was baghdad(not quite sure of the spelling) its the same exact concept. and also, when we all sit around and mourn the death of soldiers in combat, lets not fucking forget those that died in vietnom, and never were even found...thats a real tragedy, and everyone talks about the 'resistance' in iraq, i mean could you really call it resistance? i mean thats such a bully way of talking ""i tried to beat his ass, but he faught back a little, and squirmed."" naturally these people are going to fucking fight for their country, just as you would your own, but naturally americans and their ignorant fucking minds don't realize that...if someone was walking through new york city, of some kind of foriegn descent as they invaded your country, i'm sure you'd probably try to defend your country, and fight back. just because their leader was a peice of shit, doesn't mean these people don't have some kind of unity; as a country you have a certain unity, although theirs was mixed so to speak, they still had certain people that stood up for it, regardless of what they believed it, and naturally they're not going to want someone from another country to tell them what is right, or wrong to do, or to basically run everything for them. i'm sure no one in this country would want that, i mean look we still haven't even had a black president (not that i think we should...) but still, we can't even let a different race into office, nevermind someone purely from another country. nothing thats ever the overall public opinion, ever makes any fucking sense anymore, and its growing to be extremely annoying. i'm so sick and tired of listening to ignorant people whom are usually adults, talking about ""those damn iraqi's"" like ""damn, those iraqi's killed another one of our boys"" OH NO fucking arms across america for 20 dead soldiers. i have friends in the armed services, and accomplices, if you could call them that, if they were to be killed in combat, yes it would effect me, but i mean lets look at the facts, when you're a marine, you're trained to be the first to die, and to overcome that fear. it is their job to be in this imminent danger, and be consistantly at risk to death, and severe injury...you cannot sit there and mourn for them as if their deaths were anything short of expected. naturally, you don't want to expect someone YOU know is going to die, but these are the things that happen, and its pathetic that we'll mourn the death of 20-30 people, when there are other circumstances where people 100 times that number are left for dead, and we just walk past because it doesn't mean shit to us, like the people that died in the 'shock and awe' of iraq. it sucks having the tables turned, doesn't it? oh wait, i'm sure you've already thought of your poor, lame excuse for thinking, and feeling that way, you can't justify what is real, you can only hide from it as most of you all typically do. you deserve to die as painfully as those whom you mourn for, just for being ignorant enough to be so fucking one-sided, and then you wonder why people fucking turn around and kill us out of cold blood, aside from those whom already kill, for whatever reasons it may be that ARE infact citizens of this country. well thats enough about this...all you ignorant 'patriots' can go fuck yourselves...yeah YOU mother fucker."

"event","alright well, its 4:25am right now and i've had quite a long day so i may ramble on somewhat beligerantly, but thats alright because either way i have something to say. sometimes you can go your entire life (up until the current moment) wondering so many things about yourself, why you think the way you do, why you act the way you do, why you like the things you do. but, really where can you come up with an actual explanation besides the obvious detrimental things that occured, and the things you were exposed to, in a general (non-negative) manor. weeding out the possibilities with the many days that have passed is just impossible, no real conclusion can be drawn except in an overall manor. but at the rate we're going, destruction isn't too far off--and the catalyst sure isn't a rock falling from the sky and completely erasing humanity. it seems we've become so focused with thinking amongst humanity we're immortal as a mass that we've overlooked the possibility that everyday we live with mortality breathing down our necks. but a single instance, doesn't really affect the overall view of the matter; while we're all wrapped up in believing the world is going to end someday, due to some kind of catastrophic tragedy that no one can prevent we over look so many things. there have been many predictions, and/or assumptions made, as to how this world as a whole could possibly be dimished. to my own knowledge i've heard quite a few: the comet crashing into the planet, destroying everything imagineable with the immense shockwave from impact, a global nuclear winter from a massive world war, the sun burning out, and hand in hand--the depletion of the 'o-zone layer' causing the sun to more or less cook us to death, and possibly even A.I.D.S. or H.I.V. are amongst the top few. There are plenty to list, because the possibilities are certainly not few and far between, however in a nut shell we name the most extreme tragedies imagineable when the biggest one is directly under our noses. Who has ever stopped to look at the fact that humanity can easily destroy itself? As a world, since the begining (which doubtfully was the job of GOD) we have solely relied on the evolution of the mind to create the society we now live in today. Evolution, and adaptation has allowed us to create a world unlike anything anyone could have imagined in the very early stages of life. Technological breakthroughs, are by far the biggest reason society has become what it has, and we rely solely on others that contribute to these things to really allow them into our lives and trust that it is going to make our lives better in some way or another, because we don't feel we have the knowledge to judge. So, more or less we've built alot of things on the trust of others we don't even know. Except now, we're being flooded so much with new and different things that it allows us to accessorize, and chose instead of not having any other choice, and no one really looks at the negative effects because we already trust we're 'allowed' to obtain these things because someone else has deemed it as alright. The big picture is, we've gone from trusting only amongst what has been right before us, and the knowledge we as a certain group of people possess, to a population higher than one person could count in actual words relying on a corporation (whom is just trying to make money on their product) to say that the things we own are alright, and with the things we own and can do, it allows us to have a lifestyle. A lifestyle that is slowly developing into the only way of life. In America, atleast we have a class system (Low, Middle, High) which alone divides us from others. Which obviously states that, the ""REAL"" way of life is to be high class and possess everything imagineable, to acheive some kind of happiness. Although, there are alternatives, people mostly work to reach the top of the scale because being any lower really doesn't make you feel that great as an individual, who wants to settle for less when theres so much more out there? Meanwhile, no one is realizing that beneath it all we're relying on money greedy fucks that are already on top of the scale who don't give a shit about us, all they care about is you dumping your hard earned money into their product, or lifestyle, or whatever it may be, under the rules and regulations of a government that more so consists of higher class individuals, again seperated into groups (that most of the time oppose eachother) breeding even more conflict even above the masses of society in general. we've structured a society so much on conflict, and opposition that in a country titled the UNITED States Of America, we're not very united when we've divided everything, i mean think about it, the country is divided into states, the states are divided into counties, and the counties are divided into towns, and townships, theres not much unity with so much division. I suppose its alot easier to do that from the standpoint of measuring out the needs, and to better control certain areas. But, it completely contradicts the name we've branded our country with, in the long run--so it might be smart to change that. we're starting to look stupid. Its no wonder so many people outside of the country hate us, aside from the fact we're all a bunch of arrogant, greedy, materialisitc, controlling assholes (from a political standpoint). Never once has anyone stopped to think that we just might destruct ourselves because people are starting to lose their sense of individuality, and self-preservation, and just becoming a product of everything that surrounds them, instead of being their own person, and living their OWN lives. Misery needs company, and with the rapid growth of such misery, people are gonna start bringing others down, and just like dominos, the process will just spread throughout, and eventually theres going to be nothing left. This might not happen in my(or your) lifetime, but at the rate we're going its another possibility, however no one acknowledges that, why? Because we're all too busy worshiping god, and buying new useless shit, and daydreaming about how our lives could be better, that we don't even realize we could very well self-destruct. Next time you can, ask your local politician some personal questions in relation to your own life...go ahead and ask them if his family was ever on welfare, of if he/she ever had to work 12 hour days, and spend all their money on bills, and not even be able to afford new clothes, or shoes, or anything else. Not in all cases will this be the outcome, but most likely they can't say yes to any of those previous questions...so for someone that can't even understand your way of life, or thinking, or feeling, how the fuck are they supposed to make all these important decisions in your favor when they don't even know what its like? Although this may be true, people still vote these people into office, and allow them to just contribute more to their own lifestyle because thats the only thing they know how to better is themselves. Look at the facts, poverty is a rapid growing problem in this country, and through all the attempts made, nothing has accomplished any kind of positive outcome. Maybe, if we could allow someone from one of these situations to actually get a proper education without getting ripped off, or oweing the government thousands of dollars in loans in the end, they could get themselves into office, and atleast they know HOW to change something once they have to power to, considering they've lived their whole lives in that world. But, instead we'll introduce more and more tax cuts, which in return with the corporate flooding of productivity, the money those do get back from the returns, they only spend on again, worthless shit, and meanwhile those making hundreds of thousands of dollars, well, their bank accounts just bulk up a little more this year because they already can afford all the useless shit. If for any reason you cannot see my point, then odds are you are likely one of the many ignorant people that live in this world that just absorb whatever someone with a higher 'authority' tells you, and/or you just don't want to believe that this shit is really happening because you're enjoying the bliss of materialism to even want to accept that its the exact reason our society is falling apart. Even in the days before our very own deaths, no one would stand to admit that we all let this happen....and for that our deaths will be long and painful."

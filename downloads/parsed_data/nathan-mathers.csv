I've been really busy lately Im not sure what Im gonna do. I have to start thinkin 'bout my future. Whether I should try and still capture this rap shit or just go to college for next year. I gotta get my life on track. This long distance relationship thing is hard with Raven, Im gunna try 'n get there soon and maybe Stay for a while? Its just way to stressful being so far away, I want to be around her and be with her. I guess I just have a lot of decisions that need to be made."

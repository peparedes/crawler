"event","so lately i've had a bladder infection. and i haven't really gone out. and i've been drinking water like...a person who drinks alot of water. and i feel like an old woman peeing every five minutes. nice little bit of info there for ya. so since i've been sick amanda has come to visit me everynight. aww isn't she sweet. not. she comes in my room and wakes me up. and makes me stop being a bum. and makes me go get coffee or a movie with her. gosh. lol. she's my brah and i love you. 

but today i had to pack b/c i have school tomorrow. and the plan for this semester is that i go to denton every tuesday and stay with my brother til thursday afternoon. so i have to bring towels and food b/c he has none. poor boy. oh well. then amanda met me at walmart to shop for school supplies for her. but i bought a binder, a mini stapler and some new earrings. yay for new earrings. but amanda bought useless stuff for school. some west coast chopper spirals and pencils and pencil bags stuff. lol it was fun. but then we got back to my house. and she spilt wax on my table. spelled things wrong. tried to steal my sharpie. stole a cigarette. took my water. took a shit in my bathroom. ok i'll stop talkign about amanda. 

i'm very excited about school tomorrow though. it's kinda fun going back and getting back to learning and stressing out. :) i can't wait. but....it's just another nine or so months til next summer. and i can't wait to be a bum once again. :) lots of things make me smile. ok. well. one thing that made me smile tonight was i heard yellowcard's ""only one"" on la radio. and it has good lyrics. awww honey!!! ;)

ok well i'll talk to you all on thursday. hopefully i can update from the library or something. my bro is supposed to get a computer in his apt. soon. so keep them fingers crossed.

"event","so this week has been fun. i got my sleeping sorta back on track. we didn't get to go to six flags on tuesday. so yesterday we went to the ranger game. and it was fun. it was dollar dog night. but i had a massive headache all day. and that made me kinda tired. so i was zoning out the whole night. and kinda felt sick all night too. but then the rangers lost. thanks to alix's parents we didnt' have to pay for our seats.  yay thanks so much again. so i got to put gas in my car with the money i didn't spend. so it was good. now i get to go out some more. b/c i can drive. :D so i'm excited about lots of great movies coming out. wicker park, garden state, hero, and anaconda 2. haha ok not that last one. b/c as amanda and i decided the other day, if j.lo's ass didn't stop the damn snake in the first one...then nothing can. 

but more about being sick....umm i couldn't sleep last night too well. so i've been putting on my radio while i sleep...set to the classical station. and it helps. but i woke up all gross and cold sweats and stuff. i think i'm getting a cold. b/c of all the ache-iness and the soreness and sickness to the stomach. oh well. maybe i'll just starve. amanda thinks i just had a heat attack. thank you dr. pierfelice for your diagnosis. but i think i'm dying. 

but ne hoo...i think amanda and i are gonna watch a movie and clean her room tonight after she gets home from hanging with matt. oh..and amanda and i were supposed to go to san antonio today b/c amanda didn't have work today or tomorrow. and it just seemed like a good idea. but i gotta get books tomorrow morning. and amanda didn't clean her house. and we both dont have ne money. so..lol. oh well. maybe soon. so give me a shout if you want. i'm gonna go chill and watch some tv."

"event","as much as i want to have someone in my life to love me and to love them back. there is no feeling worse than having them hurt you. and all of us have to learn the pain of that. i think love and the feelings associated with it make us different people. make us act different. say things we wouldn't normally say. and do things we wouldn't do by ourselves. i hope everyone could feel love at least once in their lifetime. and never feel pain. but life is a bitch. and it's not fair. and sometimes you feel you can't go on b/c the pain is so deep and intense. don't laugh it off. if you want to cry just cry. don't be like me and hide your feelings with a joke. or hide behind a fake smile. too many times have i been hurt by not saying things i should have or letting my feelings out in the open. but god...when you do find that person that makes everything ok. and makes you feel beautiful and wanted and not only is your bf/gf...but is your equal. that's so awesome. and no one can take that away from you. b/c no one else matters. everything that people say can't take away how important that person is to you. we all make mistakes. we just live and learn. don't ever regret ne thing. it's all just lessons in this fucked up maze. but you know what hurts the most...is having that one person get over you. and you see them with another person. and you can't believe how they got over you at all b/c you're in this world of hurt. and you feel you can't breathe. and it's like the world stops. but you know what...it doesn't. and you have to move on sometime too. it's not easy...but what is?  

i'd be a different person without you. and i don't regret ne thing i've done b/c of you. i love everything about you. and i never want to lose you even if you hate me.

"event","so today i just lounged around. really didn't do ne thing at all. amanda and i didn't try on wedding dresses yet. that little journey will just have to wait a couple more days. but it's just for fun ne how. so there's all the time in the world....except for when i really do get married. lol ne ways.
so amanda and i talked most of the late afternoon and decided to go to dinner with seth since he didn't get to go to SA today, but is infact going to SA tomorrow morning. so amanda and i thought it'd be great to dress up. so we decided secretaries. b/c we watched the S&M movie the secretary the other day, which is a great movie by the way, and thought it'd be fun. so we swore to eachother that we'd each do it b/c i didn't want to look weird being the only one dressed up if she decided not to do it. so we did. and it was hilarious. i was the ""nice"" secretary and she was the ""naughty"" secretary. we both wore our black skirts...mine was a-line and hers very tight. then i wore a white shirt with a sweater with the top button buttoned...and she wore her black button down shirt. and we both wore high heels. and we each had our hair, makeup and purses done exactly how secretaries would. so seth picked me up and he was like ""what?!"" and then he picked her up and was like ""hmm??"" then we went to dinner at bennigan's. got some looks. ordered food that secretaries would eat. amanda tried to talk the waiter into giving her a beer. but it didn't work. he actually didn't want to lose his job. surprise huh?

after dinner we decided to go to starbucks and chill. everybody was looking. it was nice to dress up. very fun. it's a nice change i think. we saw sal and ""sickboy"" and lots of other nolan grads. it was lots of fun sitting there and talking about really random stuff and making inappropriate jokes to eachother. alix and i spoke briefly and decided that buffy and shopping would be a good idea for tomorrow. i need some new clothes ne how. it being fall and all. well it's coming up soon at least. but i do need a job. and some money. but those are my plans for tomorrow. but i need to go to bed soon. to wake up in time. alix told me about maggie (her dog) so sad. thank jesus she's ok now. she's such a good corgy. :D

i think i might go pick up the landrover at my grandma's tomorrow. i'd like to drive that around for awhile. it's such a nice car. kinda big. but very nice. can't smoke it in though. dammit. oh well. that's what outside is for. 

so my feet are killing me. b/c of the heels. we really should have taken pictures. but ne how. i'm retiring to my bed. the place where life seems to get alittle bit better for me everytime i'm there. 

if you're reading this and we haven't talked in awhile. you should call me. b/c i probably miss you. MUAH!!!! bye ya'll"

"event","saturday night i didn't sleep at all. so maybe my sleep schedule could get back on track. and it did. yay. i stayed up and took the movies back to blockbuster and saw this middle aged man with THE shortest jean shorts i've ever seen. but then my mom and i decided to go to her office b/c she wanted me to do some work. for pay of course. i'm really picky now. no more miss nice girl. i have to get some money some how. so i'm punching in numbers for my mom. it was boring. but i listened to la radio. so it was all good. we did that til about 12ish. then my uncle wanted to do lunch. so we all got chinese. it was great. then i dropped my mom off at work. and my brother and i went grocery shopping. and i took him to denton all by myself. it was fun. i went all by myself. i already said that. but it was exciting b/c my mom was weary of letting me go all by my lonesome. but it was fun. my bro and i rocked out on the way. i almost died when i was mergeing on the highway. but its' cool. i'm safe now. but then when i got back to fort worth. i went back to my mom's work. and i was super tired by then. so she told me to take a nap on the couch in the back. so i did. but there were no pillows. so i used a roll of paper towels. just as comfy. very ghetto. lol. then i woke up around 6 and waited for my mom to get ready so we could go. when we left we went to see my grandma real quick to pick up some food. then i went home and listened to the adventure club while i slept. i slept til about 1 ish. then i talked to james for alittle bit. then i went back to bed.

i woke up today around 10 after someone rang my doorbell. but i didnt' answer it. oh well. so i'm up early and i dont know what to do. i would have a car right now. but yesterday we decided not to let me drive the buick and my mom drive the landrover b/c i was so sleepy. and i would have been dead yet again. 

for the past three days i've been going to this website and looking at pictures of incubus. well i'm just interested in brandon. he's so attractive. i must have saved like 36 pictures to my computer. and it was awesome. i think if i go to the concert...i will die. seth will be all by himself b/c i'll be trying to jump the gates to get to brandon. and even when the concert is over...i'll stay there. b/c i know he'll come back. for me. duh. 

ok well i'm bored. I'M GOING TO LOOK AT PICTURES OF BRANDON!!!!! lol. ok i'll update later

amanda and i are supposed to try on wedding dresses today.  just for shits and giggles. it's going to be fun. but knowing her we might not do it today. maybe later this week. umm one problem...we aren't engaged. oopps. oh well. do you think telling guys we're trying on wedding dresses just for fun will scare them away?? 

oh oh oh ....the olympics are so awesome. i love ian thorpe. he's like the fastest swimmer. he hasn't lost a race since he was 14. and he's 21. and i think i'm going to move to australia with brandon and we'll all live happily ever after. 

ok talking about all these guys is going to get me in some trouble. i want to buy cds like whoa. i listened to the adventure club with josh and i love him too...and all the music is so awesome. go to kdge.com and look at his playlist for yesterday. and it was so good. ok well love ya'll. i'm really saying goodbye now. i have to eat. alright bye"

on sat. my mom and i just cleaned the house all freaking day then went for alittle taxfree shopping. it was good b/c i got a book and four shirts. so i was happy. then on sunday i chilled all day while my mom went to work all freaking day. then alix, matt and i went to starbucks and chilled for awhile there. then seth, rat, and chris potter met us up there. 

monday was fun. amanda woke me up around 2 and decided it would be a good idea to get lunch. so we decided on subway b/c then i'd get to see Will. he's so hot. i haven't seen him in so long. i miss working at gamestop just for the plan fact that i dont have cool smoking chilling outside time with my managers and Will. but then we got there and unfortunately... no Will. but it's cool. so we went back to my crib and ate. then watched zoolander while looking at magazines. then amanda's dad came to fix the wall. it was fun b/c that man is so freaking hilarious. we just watched him work while we smoked. oh and by the way...sandpaper does not light matches. like the cool cowboys on the old western movies...that doesn't work. lol. just saying. ne hoo. then amanda was an indian giver with my 10 bucks. so she could buy some brown dickies. but fast forward didn't have ne thing good. so we went to pac sun and hot topic. and TA DA...hot topic had some navy ones she liked. so then we got snow cones....and went back to my house. her dad asked us to go to home depot so we did. and that was fun b/c we made fun of people...we ate our snow cones on some stools waiting for some guys to come back and help us. talked about the home depot playboy edition. we finally got our wood that we needed. and then the guys loaded it in the car. and amanda's underwear were everywhere in the back. and she tried to tip them but they said ""we can't take that..but we do take numbers"" and we were like...""ok thanks bye!!"" so then we both got ready to go to starbucks and meet up with sarah and ashley. and we talked and it was fun. 

yesterday i slept all day. and then seth called me and wanted to do something with me and neal. so it was fun. we smoked and went and watched harold and kumar go to white castle. it was so funny. but like seth said...i can remember it was funny but i can't remember ne specific things. damn drugs. but it was a fun night. then we got food. they dropped me off. and i remembered that the movies were due at blockbuster. so i took the car and called amanda. then we decided to meet up at starbucks at 2:30 am. and we just sat and chilled and smoked and talked about everything for about two hours then we said our goodbyes. when i got home my bro and i talked forever and a day about school and how worried i am about my life. but it was fun b/c he's a wise one he is. so i didn't get to bed til about 7ish...maybe 8. i said goodnight to my mom when she was getting up this morning. so i've been up for about an hour or so. i just ate. and i dont know what i'm doing tonight but it better be good.

"event","my sleep schedule has been so off lately. i can't even tell you. i like to sleep 12 hrs from when i actually fell asleep. and i have been talking to amanda til 5am each night/morning whatever. and then i dont wake up til about 6 the next afternoon. that's so crazy. not that i have ne thing to do but still. still crazy. 

so when i woke up at 6 yesterday. i talked to seth. and he wanted to eat and come over and watch movies. so i showered. and he came over. we watched secret window. it wasn't that scary. kinda weird. then amanda called while we went for a smoke break. so we had to pick her ass up. then we got back to my house and tried to watch cool world with brad pitt. and it didn't work. the stupid tape didn't work. we couldn't figure it out. i dont know why. so we decided to watch the wedding singer instead. then my mommy came home with food. and taht was fun. amanda got a call from her matt and decided that she needs a ride home so she could go out with him. so i had to drive her ass back home. then when seth and i got back to my house the movie was almost over so we watched the rest of it and he went home. all in all a good night. 

i've been watching the news...well like twice...but still. and these stupid people might actually believe a woman was crazy when she drowned her child. then wouldn't we be the crazy ones for believing her?? YOU DON'T KILL YOUR KIDS YOU FUCKING SICKOS!!!!!!!! how hard is that? it's really stupid that people can actually get off from going to prison by saying they went temp. insane. that's a sorry excuse for a parent. 

ok so i need to do my pilates b/c i haven't done them all week b/c of my messed up sleeping schedule. then a shower. then i want a frappucino whenever my mom gets home with the car. i kinda want to go out tonight. but whatever happens happens. ok bye"

"event","long time no entry. so ...monday...i think i probably just slept...and hung out with amanda. i think we went to starbucks too probably. haha. we saw john skies and chris potter on monday night. good seeing peeps from school every now and then. then yesterday alix and seth came over during the day and we had pizza and movie day. but besides the movie we just watched like 4 episodes of buffy. it was so good. i like that show lots. but not as much as alix. then amanda and i decided to make it a quiet night at home with a movie and some wendy's. amanda and i had a blast picking out movies and talking all day by the way. but then seth wanted to come over which was fine. so we ate wendy's and stuff and then heard my garage door open. and alix, matt, chris, and john come in. it was a huge surprise seeing as i didnt' even get a phone call knowing that all these peeps would be at my house. but me being non-confrontational just let them stay and watch the movie with us. i know my mom was pissed off. so b/c of my friends...i'm having to change the code on the garage. and can't have people over for awhile except for amanda probably. b/c she's like fam. and my mom is cool with her. and plus...who's going to feed her?? lol. but then after i had to clean up after everyone and talked to amanda til 5ish. finally i got to bed around 5:45am. then about an hour and a half later my mom wakes me up b/c the guy who is going to fix the garage door is here and i need to give him the credit card when he knocked on the door. so i had to sorta stay awake. but i kept falling asleeping and kept getting woken up again by the sound of pounding and banging and whatever else that son of a mother was doing. so then when i went out there to give him the card. amanda's dad was out there and we chilled. and i sat with him while he knocked the shit out of my house. (the part that was already wrecked and is getting fixed this weekend). i dont let people just kick the shit out of my house. duh! so then i took a shower b/c it was hotter than hell outside. and took a nap from 2-8. ahhh it felt so good to be lazy. but when i woke up. i had so many missed calls and messages. my mom then called...i picked up...and this is what i hear ""WHERE ARE YOU..WHY DIDN'T YOU PICK UP THE PHONE...I THOUGHT SOMETHING BAD HAPPENED!!"" (while she's crying) so i got ready. she picked me up. we went to my grandma's to celebrate my aunt's b-day. it was fun we had lots of food and cheesecake. yumm. then we got cigs and gas on the way home. now i'm just chilling and waiting to talk to james. then amanda is going to call me back laters. yay. all in all pretty good day. i'm still sorta tired. so hopefully i'll be able to go to bed soon. i do so want a white mocha frappucino. ah well. there's always tomorrow...hopefully


i do want to start reading a book before school starts...ne suggestions...i will go to barnes and nobles and buy 50 dollars worth of books soon."

today i was supposed to work out again. but i woke up a tad late. and i had to watch oprah. and seth wanted to come over. so i didn't get to. and it was raining like none other over here. it sucked balls. i think God is mad at you and is pissing all over your face. sorry. j/k....so then seth forgot the movie...so we improvised and watched ""the usual suspects"". we ordered lots of pizza and wings. which was a bad idea b/c it was so much food. but we had stuff for dinner and supper. ha. alix called like usual and invited us to outback. so away we went...to watch alix and matt eat steak, bread and lots of mashed potatoes. and then of course we went to get ice cream. what??!!! i mean STARBUCKS YOU FREAK!!! duh. lol. so then we chilled and watched enormous amounts of people talk about God and what not. not that i'm against that. but i'm just not as into it as i used to be. and seth told me about smoking weed and killing someone in church. and how bad that would be..but not really. but he wouldn't feel bad but i would totally feel like i was going straight to hell.so ne ways. then we decided to leave. and alix went to get ""school of rock"" and seth and i went to my casa. then they met us over at my house. and we watched the movie, which fucking rocked the house down. i thought it was so funny. ""your children have touched me...and i'm pretty sure i've touched your children."" lol lol lol best line ever!!!! so now seth and alix are gone. and amanda is over even though she's sorta grounded. but she's eating the rest of the pizza and we're gonna go to wal mizzart. so i'll write later"

(i think it was that day) oh well. so after talkign to james til about 5 am. lol i tried going to bed. and i couldn't. so i put in ""a walk to remember"" so i could try and just drift off to sleep maybe. then i got caught up in the songs and stuff that i watched it again. then again with the commentary. then by then it was 8. so i got up. made the best cup of coffee ever. tried to find a movie to watch. started finding nemo. then decided meet joe black was a better decision. so i popped that in. got online. wished james a good day at work. then i got a phone call around 10. and who was it you ask??? well...it was gabby!!! she was in south carolina and she was calling me. i was so psyched. we must have talked for like 30 mins. and then she had to go eat. but i got her addy. and she got mine. so we could talk through there. and since i'm sending a package to the persian gulf for erick. i might as well send one for her too. so i was so happy. ne ways. my mom woke up. we went to sam's then ....got some food and i smoked 2 cigs. i talked to amanda a bit. i was so tired around 3ish so i chained smoked four cigs. then went to bed. then amanda called me around 5. and i told her to come over. i went back to bed. then she came in 30 mins later and woke me up. then we went to cici's. i smoked 3 more cigs. then we just chilled and watched tv and played mario party and talked with my mom. then seth came over and i smoked 2 more cigs. so throughout the whole day i had about a half a pack or more. i dont know how i'm not dead. i was just trying to stay awake. but i finally got to bed early. so i was happy. then yesterday i woke up around 4. seth wanted to come over around 6 so he did. then we watched lock, stock and two smoking barrels. and it was good. kinda weird. but good. then seth and i went to walmart to take back the dvd i got him. b/c he already had it. so then with the 10 bucks he got back, he bought some birthday snacks. it twas fun. so then i got a call from ahizzie. so we met up with them at starbizzies. lol. then back to my house to watch ""best in show"" and some aqua teen hunger force. then amanda came for like a second. then grant came. matt left. then after all the fun they all left. i got some calls from a drunk amanda and then i went to bed. and now i'm up. earlier than usual. i got to talk to a hung over amanda. and chatted with kelly online for a tad. and i've just been watching tv. i need to start pilates. and kill my stupid computer. so i'm gonna go. i will"

"event","i've lost track of my days. b/c i dont have a job or school or ne thing to do but sleep. lol. oh well. i guess it's not that important. 

so on saturday i woke up at 5:30. then my mom and i went to denton to see my brother and eat and what not. so i drove up there. and we went to eat some thai food. which was very good by the way. but it was very spicy. my mouth was on fire. i must have had like 8 or 9 glasses of water. but it's cool. very good food. i'm super psyched about staying with him this fall. lots of fun. but i have lots of work to do too. so...no partying. well maybe a tad. he is my brother. lol. so after dinner we went to kroger and bought some groceries for my poor brother. literally he's poor. no job. oh well. then we left. and i came home. called seth. he came over. then we went to starbucks. chilled for a bit. then amanda joined in on the fun. then we saw charla and bridget waggoner. it felt kinda weird b/c mandi and them are kinda bitter towards eachother...but eh. i said hello ne ways b/c amanda did first.

ok gotta be going b/c people are over.

"event","so today i slept again til 5 in the afternoon. isn't that just great. i love it actually. no one bugging me to wake up at the crack of dawn. no one telling me that we have to hurry and get ready to go to lunch. no one telling me that you have class today. b/c all of that is before 5 for me. and i dont have to do ne of it ne more. at least not during the day. and another great thing is not working. ahhh. not having a job gives me so much freedom. and doesn't stress me out at all. all i have been worrying about is where to hang this poster? or what movie am i going to watch next? should i go smoke or go to starbucks? is friends on yet? i should shower now right? it's so great. summer is finally my friend.

today after waking up at 5. i chilled for awhile. watched some tv. ate. watched a walk to remember. which was great. i have been watching that alot lately. it's cheesy but oh so good. maybe b/c shane west is hot. but oh well. then i hung some posters up. cleaned my room a tad more. it's looking great. amanda came over after work. she ate two hamburgers some fries and a coke. then we went and smoked. then we went to walmart. i bought the movie wonderland, some sunglasses and some mascara. amanda bought fight club, two magazines, and stole some earrings. then we got back to my house. and she ate some beef jerky, pickles, flaming hot cheetos with lime, and two cream sodas. and we watched fight club. read the magazines. and she threw up. lol. then we spent about 10 mins in the bathroom cleaning up. it was the perfect ending to a great night. 

now i'm just chilling here waiting to do some more laundry. b/c i'm such a night owl. what has happened to my sleeping schedule. i dont know. it's all gone to shit. well i'm going to clean up and get ready for bed. then wait to do another load of laundry. drink some water while i watch wonderland. and then hopefully before 6 am i'll fall asleep. wish me luck."

"event","so lots has been going on. i didn't end up going to that comedy club with michelle and josh. didn't feel up to it. i just really felt like just chilling by myself at mi casa. so ne ways. i went to my orientation at UNT. and picked out some very hard classes. which i'm totally going to ace all of them. haha. i hope. i'm taking...business math...business information systems (computer stuff)...pysch 1000 (which i dont need to take but they are making me b/c i'm on individual review and it's a study skills class...muy gay)...accounting 1...a nutrition class that's online...and that's it. so hopefully you won't find me dead underneath all my books this fall. 

i finally finished my room. well sorta. i painted which took me three days. and i cleaned. bought some new stuff to go with the room. organized. and it looks pretty damn nice if i do say so myself. oh oh oh...and i bought some awesome sheets. they are the jersey sheets (i dont have ne other kind duh)and they are the color margarita...oooo...and they are like lime green and so awesome. i love them

it was seth's bday on the 18th...and i couldn't make it to dinner. but i did meet them at starbucks later. and it was cool. i bought seth 20 gift certificate to the mall and the dvd reservior dogs. but the bastard already had it..so i told him to go switch it out himself. it made me alittle upset. but it's cool. the next night he made up for it by buying me one of the lance armstrong foundation bracelets i love at footlocker. lol i always try and steal his. now i have one of my own. yay

i finally got insurance. so i'm a driving girl. but only at night. lol. b/c my mom has to work and whatever. and we only have one car. but it's cool. i sleep all day so i'm not missing out on ne thing. and i like driving alot. it's very nice

yesterday was crazy. i took alix to work...got a shitty caramel macchiato..then got a great one at her store. slept. went out with amanda and seth and grant and alix and matt. then i drove amanda and seth to see a girl, jen, who works with amanda. then i drove them back to their cars. seth forgot his keys at the chick's place. so i drove him back. then i got home finally. but i took the highway for like the first time ever. and it was lots of fun. they helped me alot. :)

today i slept til 5. lol. yes it was great. got ready. had amanda and seth over. we watched Aqua Teen Hunger Force. which is pure greatness. and then we all went to dinner at fridays. i got a jack daniel's burger which was awesome. then amanda left. seth and i caught a ride with grant to starbucks. and i found out that grant bought his car from my old boss andrew. and i was totally gonna buy that car. but it's sorta a piece of shit. so i'm glad i didn't. lol. so ne ways. we chilled with sal, randy and john beck. then we all left. and now i'm chilling at my house. took a shower. feeling cool as hell. lol. 

i totally want to go to barnes and nobles and buy some books. i have not gone there in so long. but i also need to buy some clothes. what a decision. well not having a job doesn't help. but it's cool. i'll get by. i do need some pants though. like four pairs. :( the crothes in mine are getting alittle thin. lol too much info? oh well. deal with it.

alright i might update tomorrow if i'm up for it. but until i do. have fun. love you much. bye now"

"event","so lately after going out to the movies or whatever my friends and i decide to do, we always go to starbucks. not just b/c alix works there, but b/c that's like the only thing to do. it's either that or my house. and well...it's hard to get people to leave so i can just chill and do my own thing. but i dont mind them here but only if they leave at a reasonable hour. so starbucks i think, will eventually make me uber fat. it's just so hard to say i want a water instead of a delicious frap or lemonade. yumm. and they say their water is like filtered three times. but it tastes alittle funky. and i know water. ne hoo. i'll try and cut back. 

so tonight we (marge, sara moore, randy, grant, amanda, alix and i) went to see anchorman. it was funny. but stupid funny that i always seem to laugh at. i'm easily amused. i guess that's a good thing. then it was off to starbucks. but poor me rode with amanda in her car, and she had just thrown up in it the night before. and it didn't smell too pretty. but we wanted to smoke and alix is against it...so i rode with barf girl. i almost died like twice. but when don't i almost die when i'm with amanda. geez i'll love it when i get some freaking insurance and i can drive. i feel more secure b/c i know i'm a better driver than she is. sorry manda. i still love you. 

i'm looking at this bed, bath and beyond thingy and all it has is like shit for dorms and what not. and that makes me kinda sad b/c i'm not going to live in the dorms ne more. and what makes me even more depressed is that i'm not going to live in the dorms at UIW with my girls. but i'll go visit for sure. i've already planned on it. i think i'm gonna go on moving day. so i can see everyone and watch them move in and then leave. lol. 

so tonight i saw sal and liz and some other great peeps at starbucks. sal's my fav though. aww like a big sweet brother. seth also wore the incubus shirt he bought from hot topic the other day. and i wanted to do him right then and there. but i would never. b/c he's like a bro too. but that shirt was very tempting. seth and i are going to go to their concert too hopefully. :) that makes me sooo happy. b/c brandon boyd is my secret lover. and we have 82 very hot children. i can't get enough of his fine ass. whew ok i'll stop. 

so michelle called me yesterday and told me that her and her bf josh won tickets to this comedy club for friday in downtown ft.worth. and i'm kinda psyched. but i need to get home ultra early from orientation at UNT in order to go. but i'm still excited. i love a good laugh. 

speaking of yesterday. my very loving, very supportive family called me fat. isn't that crazy? i hate them totally. the people who you wish would lie to you, don't. geez. but i guess i forgive them. i mean they aren't so hot themselves. but who really is? but i was kinda bitter about that yesterday. but i guess i should just starve myself and work out excessively. oh wait that's not healthy....but i'll do it ne ways. i'm too lazy as it is. i'll just smoke more. mean replacements. yay. but i got a really big self esteem boost from james last night and that helped a whole lot. thanks sweetie ;) 

so amanda and i want to get ""friendship tattoos"". haha. it just makes me laugh. and all i really want to do is get my nose pierced. but she wants tattoos. so i guess we're both getting stars. hers on her hip and mine on my back. hers is gonna be so small you can't see it. and mine is going to be as big as my hand. so cool. and i need to get the fucked up one on my wrist redone. the bastards. soon i hope. 

i have one week til my other semester at TCC starts. damn summer school. so i was hoping to start cleaning up and rearranging and painting my room. and that was supposed to start today but i woke up late. so hopefully tomorrow. i have the plans and i'm so excited. and not too excited about the smell of paint while i sleep. but it's cool. it'll all be worth it. hopefully.

ok well i guess that's it...i'm really bored and jamming to some tunes. i'm gonna upload some pics that i've been taking. not too great just some fun shit. i can't wait to go see my cousin celeste and her kids. they are so cute. i love babies. ok well goodnight and sweet dreams. MUAH i love you!!!"

"event","so...i did my speech and it went well. thank alix for the topic. i dont know if i've thanked you enough. and i was telling amanda how it went. and she just argued with me for like 30 mins on uniforms. and it was weird b/c she just got really hostile. lol. and then after awhile she didn't know why she was arguing about uniform policies with me. oh well. by the way...amanda, you need to get your ass back to tx bitch!! i think 6 days enough. come home. but what's weird is that we've been talking more while you've been in NY than we usually do here at home i think. lol. b/c you're always working. oh well. just get your ass back here. this guy in my speech class talked about the bad things about smoking. and he had some really good points that i already knew about and am aware of. but it made me want to smoke even more. lol. that's so bad. 

so as you all know i have been doing driver's ed. and i have completed both the class times and the driving times. so finally the day has come. my driving test. and it was supposed to be today. around 4ish. but my mom and i decided to go after i got out of class just to get it over wiith. so we go up to the lady and she unfortunately tells us that there are no more driving times for today. obviously people get there an hour and a half before the dps opens and stands and waits in line and i guess first come first serve. but...that's totally gay. b/c my mom has to work and we want to get it over with. and tomorrow isn't a good day. and i dont know. it sucks. oh well. we're going to try tomorrow and if it takes too long then my mom and i are just gonna have to do it monday. and i was all prepared and everything for driving today too. i practiced yesterday and i read everything over. it was fresh in my mind. geez. something always has to go wrong with everything i do i guess. but while i was there i got a card thingy to register to vote b/c i have failed to do so. but i filled it out and i'm gonna send that bitch in. then i'm gonna read up on my politics and see who i'm gonna vote for. b/c i dont want to be an ignorant voter. so yay!

i would like to congratulate the rangers for being a kick ass team this season. i'm watching the houston astros get a beating from the chicago cubs. if the rangers aren't playing i guess i have to support the other team from texas. except for basketball season...the spurs suck i hate them. i want to fart in their mouths. i want to shit all over their walls. lol (scary movie 2 quote for ne one who didn't get that). so i talked to seth last night for more than an hour and we chatted about basketball and how the stupid mavericks traded dirk to the houston rockets. and i about died. and when i told amanda.. she couldn't stop saying ""what??!!"" it's a major loss and i think a huge mistake. but i guess if they need to free up some money for shaq i think that's whatever. shaq is a beast. i think he's an ok player. not my favorite. there's just something about him that i dont really like. he annoys me a tad. oh well.

so i didn't get to see spiderman 2 yesterday but i did see dodgeball and it was funny. i felt bad ditching alix and matt when i didn't even do my driving thing today. we will all hang out this weekend. everyone!! even amanda b/c she's coming back whether she likes it or not!!

ok well i'm going to fix some rice for lunch...watch the rest of the game...fold some clothes...and wish my old best friend ana a happy birthday. y'all take care and drop a line."

umm ok well i have been going to school. speeches every week are not fun. i'm stressing about one due thursday right now. b/c i just switched topics. lol wow am i just out of it. ok ne hoo. victoria came to fort worth to stay with me awhile. she came in on thursday we ate and got starbucks. then friday we went to lunch with melissa then shopping, which went great, and dinner with my mom then off to starbucks again. saturday we woke up and went to lunch with my uncle and grandma...it was raining a tad and victoria thought that she should get going before it rained ne worse. so she left. and i just chilled at my grandma's the rest of the day. i think i went to starbucks that night too. lol. sunday i went to lunch for my cousin's b-day at our fav. chinese restaurant in arlington. it was good. after lunch we went grocery shopping. we bought all my fav. foods. just to stock up until next time. then alix, matt and i went to chili's..then to see dodgeball. it was funny but i think you see it all in the trailer. then when i got home. my mom raided the chinese food. ate it all and left one of each for me. i dont know where she puts all the food she's eats. she's a stick. today i went to school. it was ok. i feel like ass. i look like ass. i went to the library and looked up all this stuff on blood donation for my persuasive speech. and now i think i'm goign to change it to uniforms in high schools. b/c alix told me it was easy for her. and i dont really want to overdo ne thing. so i'll just stick with uniforms. plus i've worn them all my life. so i can relate. alix and matt came over tonight. i couldn't go to starbucks with them and jr b/c my mom went to sleep at 8:30. i think she's acting older than she is. oh and i heard jr asked matt and alix ""so when's your friend getting here?"" talking about me. like he doesn't know my name...or we didn't go to junior prom together...or we haven't known eachother for 4 years. that's bs. oh well. he can act like that. ok well i guess that was a great wrap up of my week. really nothing to do but go to sleep. i'm pooped. no sleep makes jennifer sleepy. lol. i can't wait to get my license. i think i can do highways in no time. ok well sweet dreams and goodnight to you all. love ya"

"event","""Sometimes it's therapeutic to keep busy, even if what you're doing seems to be mundane. There may be a lot of small chores and things that need to be organized around the house, so hop to it. This is actually the perfect remedy for the problem of thinking too much. If you think too much, you may get overly emotional about something that's just not worth it. As a result, your emotions may block you from achieving your immediate goals and responsibilities. Don't worry. This is just a phase, and you will find your focus again. If any storm is brewing in the air, you'll weather it with flying colors."" ~my aquarian horoscope. and the story of my life.

so yesterday my mom and i ran errands all day. i fell asleep then was rudely awakened by my alarm clock this morning at 7am. i was in the middle of getting ready when i looked and saw i had a voicemail i didn't have before. i listened to it. it was willard, my driving instructor. so i called him back. and unfortunately told me that i was late for my lesson. me=??. apparently my mom got the time wrong. i felt super bad. so we met him at the dps. and i drove for an hour and a half. parallel parked a tad. and whatever. then my mom went to visit my grandpa for father's day. i tried to find mrs. black. but i couldn't find her headstone. i thought i knew where it was. oh well. i said a prayer for her ne ways. she knows i was there. that's all that counts. then we went to market street. it reminded me of central market in SA. we bought some lunch. had lots of fun just finding stuff to eat. i missed my time with my mom. we bought some soy creamer for our coffee and soy ice cream. b/c we are two lactose intolerant girls. b/c the ben and jerry ice cream almost killed me the other day b/c my mother failed to read the ingredient ""lactose"" on the back. but it was sweet of her ne how. it was good, heath bar stuff is always great. so then we got in the car and went to blockbuster. and for the past five or six hours my mom and i have been watching movies. along came polly, 50 first dates, and sexo y lucia. to be specific. and they were great by the way. we sorta fell asleep through the last one b/c it's a tad serious and alittle long.

i have a speech due on tuesday. i got the books i needed yesterday from the library. and i have to start so i dont have to stay up all tomorrow doing it. oh well. maybe i'll just procrastinate. that's just who i am. and what i'm best at. 

by the way happy father's day. happy father's day to my mother and her siblings who no longer has a father. happy father's day to myself that is no longer attached to my father legally, emotionally, physically, and in whatever else way a father should be there for his children. for my mother on tuesday june 15th has become legally single again. and very much liberated from the web that my father has tangled her in. my mother and i recieved what we wanted from the mediation and i will never have to see him again in my life. if i could explain the feelings i have right now...i would say them. but unfortunately i am empty. i feel a vast emptiness inside my heart. like a dark corner somewhere where no one else can ever go or fill with light. but life will go on. and soon i'll be with my friends or doing something unimportant so i will not be worrying about ne of these things. they will be pushed away like they always are. but i'm content with the life i have. and should be proud of what i have and what has happened to me. and i am. for now all that helps is caffine and nicotine. i'm dying slowly....but aren't we all?"

"event","i haven't written in here lately. but all i have been doing lately is just going to starbucks with my buddies like everynight. and going out to eat. alix and i went to outback the other day. and omg...we treated ourselves. it was great. i have just been going to school and trying to get hw done. i bought some mane and tail shampoo and conditioner from sally's so i can try and speed up the growth of my hair. hopefully. what's funny is that this shampoo is for humans and animals. it has like instructions for both. i think that's hilarious. matt is trying this stuff too. hopefully our hair is down to our asses by the end of the summer. 
today my mom and i went around and ran errands all day. i had to pick up my cellphone b/c i left it at al's house last night. then we went to eat. we went to the library b/c i have a speech due on tuesday. we went to best buy. i hit a curb while i was driving. we went to albertsons. and that was about it. now we're just chilling at home. watching cops and whatever else is on. i have to get reading these books on massage therapy for my speech. hopefully its a good one. school's good. i like it lots. lots of good people. funny people. i still have to finish the last two hours of my driving stuff. and it's gonna be tomorrow at 7:50 in the morning. how freaking crazy is that. it's b/c willard's camaro was in the shop for like ever. and i guess he's just so popular. so tomorrow is the only time he has open. so i guess that'll just have to do. and i don't know if i'll do ne thing tonight. so it's ok. yesterday alix, matt and i went to california pizza kitchen and went to see the terminal. it was so funny. we had a grand old time. so...maybe starbucks tonight possibly. seth needs to come out of his jailhouse right now. ok that is all i have to say today my loves. talk to you all soon."

"event","so on friday alix and matt and i went to steak and shake. and it was pretty good. good burgers and good shakes. kinda costy. but it's cool. then we went to see ""Saved!"" it was good. very funny. it reminded me of nolan. lol. but what doesn't remind me of nolan? so then we called amanda b/c she was supposed to go to the movies with us but didn't get off from work in time. so we met her up at starbucks. and it was lots of fun. a guy overheard us talking about ""naked alone"" time that people have in their houses. and amanda was talking about it alittle too loud. and this guy came over. and showed us all a sketch of his bed that he wanted to make. and said he was in the music and film profession. and wanted to get amanda's number. it was a tad scary. me thinks he does those independent amateur films (if you get my drift). but oh well. we chatted and then i went home. ""every party has a pooper that's why we invited you..party pooper...that's what you are""......and that's what i was. b/c i went home early. and the rest of the gang went to matt's house. 

then on saturday i chilled at my house. i watched movies with my mom all day. and we just sat and chilled. i called willard to see if we could finish up the driving stuff. and he said the camaro was in the shop til wednesday. so the lessons would have to wait til then. dammit. i could have had my license by now. oh well. practice makes perfect right??!! so then my allergies bugged me yesterday. and i OD'ed on benadryl and fell asleep at like 10 til about 1:30. then i woke up and watched movies. i didn't go back to bed until about 5. that sucks. 

today we were supposed to go to six flags. but unfortunately we didn't have a fourth person so we could do the buy one get one free thing. and then i would have been sitting by myself on the rides. no fun. so we didn't go. maybe better when we gets lots of people to go. so today was again a very lazy day. with lots of lounging around. and doing absolutely nothing but giving into to the beauty that is the tv. 

i watched the game today. game 4 of the nba finals. and the lakers lost again. omg. cry me a river. they suck. detroit should win b/c they play really well. and they don't try to make 3 pointers like kobe does ALL THE TIME!! omg. ok so yeah. i'm finished venting. 

so tomorrow i guess it's back to school life. ugh. isn't it ever over. well at least these are classes i won't have to take during the actual school year. thank goodness. 

but i'm probably going to bed soon. hopefully. maybe one more movie then that's it. i'm watching ""y tu mama tambien"" foreign film. very good. lots of sex. lol. that's not why it's good. but i've decided that i want to marry a hispanic man. i think i get along with them real good. and they are just so sexy!!! whoo hoo. ok.

alrighty i'm going to bed. VICTORIA: i hope you had fun on your trip. you should call me bia. 
ok i'm going to bed. love y'all bye!"

"event","""Every true lover knows that the moment of greatest satisfaction comes when ecstasy is long over and he beholds before him the flower that has blossomed beneath his touch""

hey i haven't done this in awhile....well like a couple of days. but still. ok so i got the velvet revolver and muse cd's. and they are greatness. my mom called me from bestbuy asking how to spell them..and she was like yelling to me on the phone b/c i guess it was really loud. but it was unnecessary. it's so great when she goes shopping without me. i dont know where'd she be. probably lost in the refrigerators. 

so tuesday i....went to school...and watched ""last comic standing"" and it's pure greatness. let me tell you. i think it's the funniest thing. these guys are very different but so awesome. then amanda and i went to walmart. lol that was an experience. it was raining first of all. and she was going crazy on the road. lol. i love driving with her. even though i hold on for dear life everytime. but we bought makeup and stuff for her room. i bought romeo and juliet and the beach. leonardo dicaprio eh? yes...i forgot how much i love him. then amanda and i came back to my house and read the cosmo together like old times. awwwww i missed that. we drank coke and ate stale cheetos...but then i got the doritos. lol. amanda played priest with the chinese candy that looks like host that my mom bought. we read sex stuff, horoscopes, and guessed which outfit and purses and bathing suits eachother would like the most. it was fun. next month we'll do it again when the next one comes out. :)

it finally stopped raining. thank goodness. it's wasn't that bad though. HURRICANE ANDREW!!!! lol. then on wednesday amanda and alix were off. so matt, seth, alix, amanda and i went to outback and then to starbucks and had a grand ol' time. i filled out an application for starbucks. yay. cross your fingers bitches. i'm sorry i mean please. maybe i'll adopt chuckles at starbucks (the ginormous waterbug) or maybe not. and i'll see alix's bob. i seriously want to rape that little 16 hottie. if he looks ne thing like brandon boyd..i'm all over that shit. ewww. lol. alix, matt, seth and i are supposed to go watch ""saved"" tonight. it should be great. ""i crashed my van into JESUS!!!"" lol. God squads get on my nerves. no offense. i love the man. but...u know. 

school's ok. i have to do a speech on monday. just a short one, but still. then i have to do a real one coming up soon. i dont know what to do it on. i'll research. i have to get on the driving thing. i've been lazy and haven't called the man. i should get my license soon. :D then i can drive ne where i want!!! how exciting. i know you probably think you're reading a 15 yr old's journal. but no..i'm 19. lol. and just getting my license. 

my uncle's landrover got broken into. and his driver's side window is missing. so i'm sitting here waiting for the glass people to come to the house and fix the window. i'm just happy i woke up on time. i really don't care what i look like either. 

amanda said that seth and lynn are like amanda and i. meaning....that i am seth...and amanda is lynn. b/c seth and i are like the parents. and amanda and lynn are the party crazy kids. i kinda see it. so amanda said that i should date lynn and she should date seth. so that they each have an authority figure. lol. but i can't date lynn. i've known him too long. and amanda can't date seth. it's a problem. but it's funny. 

yummm kfc. i'm eating my bucket of chicken. lol don't i sound like a huge black man. so yesterday i just sat and chilled all day. it was a good day. movies galore. today i have to wait for these window peeps. then i'm going to check out times for the movie. and then probably get ready for the movies and dinner. then go....then home. ugh. i dont know what i'm doing tomorrow but i wish i could stay in my bed all day. sunday is six flags. i dont know if i'm going yet. we should go to a rangers game. i've been watching alot of sports lately. it's great. the lakers lost by 20 pts last night. lol suckers. detroit is gonna kick y'all's asses. and the rangers beat the pirates by like 8 i think. i really didn't see the last inning. 

i cut my hair. yay. i dyed it back the natural color. kinda dark, but very nice. and i got bangs. and i trimmed up the ends. i have pics if you'd all like to see. i can send them to ya. still trying to grow this shit out. but it's a slow process. maybe i'll go buy that ""mane and tail"" shit. that makes your hair grow super fast. or maybe i'll just wait the year and a half til it grows out to where i want it to be. lol. either one.

i got officially accepted to UNT. i was gonna get in ne ways. lol. i'm just a tad modest. but the want me to take this ""psyc 1000"" class. but i'm telling those bitches no. b/c i already took intro to psych. and child/adolescent psych. and i passed both. so they can suck the dick i dont have. b/c i ain't doing it! which reminds me..i have to call them and tell them that. if i still have to do it....you're going to see one angry bitch. 

ok...i've spoke too much. just trying to catch y'all up. ;). love you all. have a good one."

"event","after we dropped my aunt off at the airport on saturday morning. my uncle, brother and i went to Fry's electronics. it was so much fun. they have everything electronic in the whole world. i looked for some cd's and dvd's at first, but then decided i could get them cheaper at best buy. so i didn't get them. so i went to ""battery central"" to find a battery for my mom's camera and some rechargeable ones for my camera since it doesn't like ne thing else. then i walked around and looked for my bro and uncle and everyone that worked there must have thought i was lost b/c i was a girl and kinda was just looking at everything. i thought it was just gonna be a warehouse but it is actually very very nice. mad props to Fry's. 

velvet revolver's cd comes out tomorrow. i'm gonna go buy it. that cd and muse's new one too. i was thinking i should probably buy the special anniversary edition of weezer's blue album. but....i dont know. but i probably will since weezer is great. and all of you who don't like them can shove it. b/c their music is happy and it makes me happy. :)

so today in public speaking we had to turn in these sheets that should say what our level of anxiety is. like in groups or in public and what not. and mine was very good. but when we had to do alittle mini-speech today on our keys i was soooo shaky. lol i feel like a dork. thank God i had my keys on me. then i would have had to talk about my wallet. and that's not interesting. and i was the only one in the class that didn't have their own car. :( but i will soon i hope. buick with the what what. 

speaking of driving. i drove my brother home yesterday back to denton. which is a 30-45 min drive might i add. and i took the back way since i really can't drive on 35N yet. so...it was fun. i did like 60. it was fun. kinda scary b/c it was starting to rain. but i made it. i have to call willard (my driving teacher) to do 2 more hours. then i'm done. and i can get my license. i have been driving alot lately. and it's getting really easy. so yay. i will have to drive y'all somewhere. haha.

well nothing else has really gone on in my life. just driving more. and trying to get my life back with my friends. i haven't hung out with them in awhile. maybe i'll go see alix tonight at starbucks. i always say that. but i really need to. or we should go get lunch like we did last week, amanda and alix. i have some free rentals at blockbuster and i think i am going to take advantage of them soon. i want to see some movies. so i can go buy some new ones. i am getting tired of the old ones. and the ones on vhs that i have i wish i had on dvd, but i'm probably never going to buy them again. 

ok well i have rambled on for too long. i want to take a nap but i dont know how that's gonna go. i might just stay up. until ellen and oprah and friends and stuff time. so...have a great day. hopefully i'll talk to y'all soon. MUAH!!!"

"event","this week has been good. starting school has been fun. on the second day i didn't have school b/c the power was out due to the storms the night before. yay for storms. and tornados and lighting. lol. ok not so much b/c seth and amanda didn't have electricity for like two days or more. sorry guys. come over and enjoy electricity at my house. my public speaking class is fun. i am kinda nervous about speaking infront of these people. i dont know why. 

my brother came in from denton yesterday. he's great. he helped me fix my computer and we chilled and talked and whatever. i love my brah! even though i had to do his laundry. it's ok. we chatted about what i was gonna do when i started going to school at UNT with him. i'm commuting. so i will only go to school on tuesdays and thursdays. and my mom is freaking out b/c she doesn't want me driving that much. so we have all come to the decision that i will stay in denton tuesday morning through thursday night. so i won't have to drive so much. and i could possibly still have a life in fort worth and maybe a job. even though my mom said not to worry about money this sememster. fine! i will spend every cent she has. j/k. i'm not mean. 

i have been cleaning my house off and on for the past week. and it's rather...relaxing. maybe b/c i like it. i have to be doing something at all times. i can't just sit down. unless i'm really tired or lazy or something. then i'm sitting lol. but so far the house looks good. i have mopped, swept, organized, moved, did laundry, and got high off the cleaning fumes. i cleaned the kitchen, the garage (sorta), the living room, the bathroom, and my room. whew i'm pooped. but there's so much more to do. so i can't stop. i got hurt putting some stuff in my closet. something pinched my skin on my hand and it hurts so much. i have to start painting the house soon. this should be fun. 

my driving abilities have been growing strong. i have driven almost everywhere my mother and i have gone. it's so much fun. but we had alittle scare today. i was driving my mom and brother to dinner. and my mom was telling me where to go. and she started talking to my brother and i was driving where she told me to go. and i drove onto a ramp. and it was a ramp leading to the 121N/820S highway. and i freaked out. it was so scary. i felt like Dee on Clueless. it was quite an experience. but i pulled over to the side and my mom took it from there. i can't deal with the stress. i think i have an ulcer. lol. but despite that crisis i think i'm a good driver. getting better at reversing and turning and switching lanes. yay

i saw my tia carmen today (my aunt). i haven't seen her in awhile. she's my fav. i love her so much. it's alittle hard for me to talk to her b/c she only speaks spanish. and i understand more than i can speak, write and read. but that's what my spanish classes are for. but it was still good to see her. we went to bennigan's for her b-day and took bunches of pics and ate dessert and hot wings. yummy combination eh?

amanda and i cleaned out a shelf in my garage yesterday. and she was afraid to get bit by the bugs. so we wrapped her up in plastic wrap. it was great. we both wore rubber gloves and wiped stuff down and put them in boxes. then she tried to stuff herself in a box. i took a pic. don't worry. 

i talked to victoria which was great. i missed her so much. i miss all my SA girls. we need to chat more. don't be strangers. 

ok i have to see harry potter. period. nothing more to say.

i'm going to bed...love you all!"

"event","yay first day of school...first day of school~lol finding nemo. :) no but really first day of school whoo hoo. it wasn't that bad. i think i got this. i didn't see my cousin, i guess she's not in my class ne ways. but i did see alot of people that i knew like ginny chapman and anne bury. and i saw this girl that used to work next door to gamestop at subway but i didnt' say hi to her...she's a tad wacko. but it's ok. i already have hw so i have to read. blah. oh well. i can't wait and get the school short semester over with. hopefully it'll go by fast then i can take spanish and that'll be a breeze. oh and i have to buy more books. ugh. school sucks. books up the izz-ass. 

umm if y'all need a bug killer you have my number or you can ask for it. b/c i am the shit. i just came home from school and i went to pick up the newspaper and i saw all these ant piles and i went and got the HOT SHOT and killed those mothers. and i was just outside in the backyard and i thought i got all the ones in the backyard the other day. but i didn't. so i killed those suckers too. u know what? i have no mercy for ants. they bite my feet. grr. i've been talking alot about bugs lately. lol sorry. they just get on my nerves. june bugs are cool though. one hit me in the head last night. lol

so i didn't go to bed til like 4:45 last night. i couldn't sleep. i guess i was just nervous about school...among other things. so i'm a bit tired and i need a nap seriously. 

i'm going out to eat lunch at bamboo garden. yummy chinese. with my girls alix and amanda. who should be here shortly. so i'm going to freshen up and change b/c i'm not comfy right now. go eat. then come home. take a nap. then wake up and do some reading for school tomorrow. yikes. hw i hate it. 

friends of me: we haven't hung out...probably b/c i've been pms-ing the past couple of days. sorry. i have disconnected myself from the outside world. i didn't even talk to amanda that much. weird. ok but i'm back on track. hopefully we'll do something soon. i know y'all have to work and what not. i should start doing that too. eh. my mom said not to worry about getting a job right now with all that i have going on. so maybe i won't worry about it. that's what moms are for right. if not to hear me talk at all hours of the day...to give me money right?! lol. i love my mommy. and you all do too so you can see why i do so much.

my mom said i have to go to ""mediation"" with her on the 15th to try and do the settlement thing with my father. she thinks i will motivate her and guide her in what would be a good settlement. i am not gonna settle for the money that he is willing to give her and neither is she. she just needs me there to tell her that b/c if i dont...no one will. my mom gets taken for granted and that bastard should pay. actually there is no price on the pain and stress he has caused her. but money does help occasionally. i think my mom and i might get another house. it just seems to be a really good idea at the moment. even though i didn't want to at first. we're still if-y about the whole deal. that won't happen, if it ever happens, til after the divorce is totally settled. 

i have to call victoria..she called me last night..sorry i didn't pick i love you. i will talk to you!! knock knock knock....lol aww i miss that. 

and mandi...umm how about i just mail the charger to your house...or drop it off or something. b/c i know you're out of town. i'm sorry this has been so stressful. if i would have known it would be like this i would have never offered to give it to you. lol. love you hope you're having the time of your life. 

ok i love you all. talk to you soon. MUAH!"

AHHH!!! every summer my mom and i get all these ants. always in our pantry. and we have to clean out the pantry and it's a pain. let me tell you. so i went in the garage. and killed those suckers with some ant stuff. i feel like an orkin girl. lol. no but what i love about summer is all the nice bugs. like june bugs and rollie pollies. they are the good bugs. i dont like the spiders and flying things with stingers. they make me sad. i run inside. i wish i had a pool. then i would just dive in. and i would be really tan too. june bugs are great. i saw my first one the other day. and it's not even june yet. those early birds or bugs whatever. 

so today is memorial day. and i'm a bum. but i hope my mom would get home. we were supposed to have like a daughter/mother day thing. we were gonna go to best buy and buy some cds and stuff. then maybe do some other stuff. i really don't know. i'm just excited about best buy. lol. i dont know what i'm gonna buy. 

speaking of buying stuff. i went to old navy yesterday. and i bought some stuff. which is really awesome. and my mom got a credit card over there. but she's hanging on to it. b/c i dont think i can trust myself with it. but ne hoo. i bought a cali shirt, two pairs of comfy pj pants with little lace on the bottom (too cute i'm wearing them right now), i bought two skirts b/c i got bleach on the first skirt i bought...so i bought two more, and that's it. i think that was good enough. i should have boughten more shirts. oh well. i'll go back soon. i have coupons. lol. i'm crazy. first i need a job. so i can actually pay for some of this stuff. 

so i have been driving more often. and it's great. i just really need to practice. its' really harder than i thought. i forget stuff. my mom is not like my instructor. she doesn't remind me to look in my mirrors and turn my head and then signal like willard does. it's not the same. oh well. i know what i'm doing. i just have to do it on my own. AHHH!!! ok the bad part about driving that i've seen lately is the gas prices. i really dont want to pay for gas. lol. it's like 2 bucks a gallon. that sucks. and i need to get a job. and all my money is going to go towards that. :( i hate responsibility. but i'm gonna have to get used to it i guess. 

ummm i really hate my scanner/fax/copier/printer thingy. b/c ok. all i needed was a printer cord. and i got one. and i hooked it up. and it doesn't work. UGGGHHHH!!! and i really really really need to scan some pics. and i can't. it doesn't even do ne thing. it won't even make a copy. i think it hates me. :(

so i haven't seen ne of my friends since thursday. but it's ok b/c i'll probably see them soon b/c harry potter comes out friday. and i know they will all want to go. 

omg i start school tomorrow. this is so scary. i dont want to take public speaking. i dont like giving speeches. i get alittle nervous. and my voice gets all shaky. and i make good points but i get too nervous. i just have to remember to breathe. did i mention i think i'm gonna have that class with my cousin celeste. it's gonna be great if she's in there. we'll get to chat and stuff. but i won't get to see the babies. :( oh well. 

i want to get reading a book. i'm watching oprah and she inspires me to read more. she's my motivation. well i'm in the middle of a book, but i dont think i like it too much. oh well. i'll finish it soon i guess. i want to read the books i never read in school. lol. like the summer reading stuff i should have read but never did. oh well i'll catch up sometime. 

ok i have to take a shower then call my mom and see where she's at. have a great memorial day ya'll. hopefully i'll get to drive again today. yay. k bye MUAH!!!"

"event","""when someone cares enough to love us in our perfectly imperfect form, they give us back the faith we were born with.""~page from my day calendar thingy. 

well this week has been eh. been hanging out, driving, and what not. seeing amanda, seth, alix and everyone else a bunch. trying to get away from having people over at my house too much. it upset my mom and myself alittle bit when people just wait for me when i'm not even at my house. but it's cool. just for the safety of my broken house and my son of a bitch father driving around...it's not so great to have the garage door open with my friends who  don't even live there walking around and whatever. but it's ok. all that's going to calm down b/c i have to start school and get a job. so i'll be busy and need to get up early. oh and there's the whole driver's license thing. which is going great by the way. 

but school starts tuesday b/c monday is memorial day. and knowing me, my ass would have been up there trying to get into class and waiting forever and a day. oh well. so my public speaking class starts tuesday and i might actually be in the same class with my cousin. she had two kids and she's 21 so she's trying to go back to school. it's awesome. i haven't seen celeste in forever. at least i'll know someone. but yeah. i got my book and i just need to know my way around campus and i'm good. can't wait to go back to school. i really wish i was taking a math class. that damn subject has grown on me. maybe i'll go into accounting. whoo hoo. number crunching. so we shall see what happens with the whole summer school thing. oh yeah and my book for spanish is 152 dollars. that is more than the class itself. what kind of shit is that? damn bitches. that's not right. grrr

driving is going quite well. i have officially done 4 hours. and all i need is 2 more and i can go get my driver's license. it'll be fine. i practiced parallel parking for 2 hours today. and i am a fucking badass at it. i aced it everytime. alittle too far out one time, but i blame the side mirror. my instructor, willard, is a 50 yr old smoke-aholic. and he's awesome. so laid-back. he's so cool and i get to drive his camaro...which is cool too. i like driving. it's growing on me. i'm a fast learner according to willard. but i can't can't can't can't drive with my mom b/c she drives me insane. she yells at me and makes me nervous and grabs onto things. it's so funny. but it's ok. i would too. 

so i got a call from maria, my exroommate, and she told me that our favorite club, tequilas, is closing down. :( so amanda and i are going to go clubbing tonight b/c we have to. we're going to see everyone. it's gonna be great. steve is going to be there....aww he's so nice and so hot and so into amanda. lol. but he called me gorgeous bitch remember that!! ne hoo...sorry about that. 

so my grandma is like the godfather amanda and i have decided. b/c we would do ne thing for that woman. she is greatness wrapped in alittle chinese woman about a foot shorter than myself. awww. lol. amanda said she would die for the popo (that's how i call my grandma). and i would too. she's making lunch/dinner today. so that's where i'm headed. then a call to amanda. getting ready for clubbing. i should be back around 3ish. maybe 4 if we go to IHOP. 

have a wonderful day even though it's hot and humid outside. MUAH! bye"

"event","you know what i love out of everything in the whole world...rollie pollies. u know those little bugs that if you touch them they roll in a little ball. they are so great. i just saw seven of them outside. i love how they just crawl all over your hand...without a care in the world. 

ne hoo. i went to main event and watched my friends bowl tonight. it was great. and i had to listen to linkin park for 15 mins straight. i thought i was going to have to stab myself with my phone. but all in all it was a goodnight. i saw seth-a-roo...and he's a great big ball of greatness in his foot locker referee shirt. and eating wendy's with my ahutt and matty poo. then amanda joined in for the fun. and we watched the prom buffy episode and i think i shed alittle tear. it was awesome!! i'm so glad alix shared that with me. i still like the episode when no one talked. i think it was called HUSH. 

so last night i was hoping to go to sleep early. and i kinda did. i fell asleep around 11. then alix called me when she got off work to verify that we were gonna have movie and pizza day. and i woke up. and i stayed up til about 7:30am. not alix's fault. i tried to ignore it. so while i was awake i baked cookies and watched LOTR: the two towers. just to be ready for the third one that came out officially today. yay. but i'm not gonna buy it until the special edition box thing comes out with the special shit and yeah. so i can officially complete my collection. lol i'm a nerd. 

but then alix came over today. we ordered pizza and hot wings and watched edward scissorhands. it was greatness. i think i cried. i danced the ice dance for alix. and she loved it i think. and then she left and then i got ready for tonight.

well i am just updating b/c amanda told me to b/c she's sick and tired of reading the old ones. i fucking hate that bitch. lol i'm kidding i love you. 

bamboo garden tomorrow and movie day tomorrow. umm milo and otis i believe is our movie choice for tomorrow. might i add that rules of attraction is a good movie. ""can i get a brewski for you-ski""...lol so funny. ok well goodnight. i'm going outside to talk to amanda and do what i do best. ciao!"

"event","yesterday was a hell of a day. i slept three hours. took some ADD medicine. stayed up some more. showered. got my permit. yay. made some appointments. watched some tv. then amanda ran into my house. then hung out with seth, alix, michelle and josh. oh yeah AND AMANDA RAN INTO MY HOUSE!!! lol it's cool. it's fixable. but it was a tad stressful. had alot of cigarettes. even shared one with my over stressed mother. it's all good. 
i was emptying the trash out today and i got a massive papercut on my pinky. it sucks. i have a bandaid and everything. 
have i told y'all lately that i love oprah and ellen. they are the shit. seriously. they always make me laugh. oprah makes me cry. i'm such a girl. oh well. 
you know what's awesome....underwear. maybe it's b/c i'm wearing my favorite pair. it just makes me laugh to think that people didn't even wear them 400 hundred years ago.(learned that on oprah). and people's excess or lack of underwear. lol. i have a plethora of undies. and they are great. everyone take pride in your underwear. 
my grandma (the popo) has been having lots of headaches and dizziness and loss of sleep and stuff like that lately. she got a MRI on monday and the doctors said that she has some swelling. we dont know exactly what that is. so we're gonna get through some more tests. i'm just worried for her. i dont know if i can lose another grandparent. it's too hard. all i can do is pray for her. and spend time with her. and hopefully she'll pull through. miracles happen. but we just have to let God do His thing. say alittle second prayer for her. ne thing would make a difference.

"event","ok so last night i didn't pull an all nighter. i read my book and fell asleep by 6. then i woke up at like 2:30 and alix came over around 4ish. we watched harry potter and the sorcer's stone. we ordered pizza. it was good fun. her plan for getting me to like harry potter is working. around 7 she left so she could go to work. then i talked to amanda and she wanted to go to starbucks with seth. yay for seth. i miss hanging out with him. i'm glad he's back in with the gang. so i told amanda that i wanted to get in early last night. and did i? not quite. we ended up going to duane's again. it was fun to see everyone again. then amanda and i came back to my house. her ADD kicked in and she couldn't stop moving. instead of giving herself some ADD medicine, she gave me some so i could stay up today. i tried to stay up til this morning but i couldn't stay up. i fell asleep around 5:30 and woke up around 9. alix wants to come over again today and watch the second harry potter. i have to have to have to get my permit today so i can start driving. i wish i could do it myself but i can't drive. lol. oh well. that's my life. nothing ever goes my way. eh. i've learned to deal. i'm kicking yoda right now. not in the abusive way. lol. in the love tap way. he loves me. lol. alix called luca..""luda"" the other day. and then started singing ""i'll be that kitty named luda""....she's seriously on crack, but she's my friend. lol. (sigh)...i'm going to take a shower. then await alix's call...and probably go to the DPS today hopefully. good day to you all. don't drink and drive. love ya bye"

"event","have you ever just felt like you're living your life, but it has no purpose. today alix, matt and i went to TGI Fridays and to see Troy. and all through dinner i was thinking to myself...why do people wear clothes? seriously not trying to be funny or ne thing, but do you ever think of why we do the things we do. why do we have computers? why do we cut our hair? why do some people get along great, but then don't with others? i guess i'm just in this crazy daze from today. i think i'm gonna pull an all-nighter. i mean why not. i have to straighten up my sleeping habits. and that means either i don't go out ne more or my friends are just gonna have to deal with me leaving early on in the night. or maybe i should just try and wake up early, but that didn't work a week ago b/c i just fell back asleep b/c i knew i had nothing to be getting up for. i haven't seen my mom in three days and she'll be getting up in 30 minutes. maybe i should wait. maybe i should go to bed. my mom brought the new car from austin today. it's great. alix likes it. it's a suzuki vitara limited edition. used to be my uncle's, now it's ours. b/c i get the buick. yippie. 
i'm having major moods swings b/c all today i've been in a great mood. and all of a sudden right now i am just blah and kinda sad. 
i have to take a moment and be alittle conceited. i looked really cute today i think. ha. i should have taken a pic. oh well. but i did. i'll wear this outfit more often. ok. 
i miss my girls in SA. they kept me going but now i'm alone in my house. 
i started a new book. it's my fourth one this year. i'm excited. i haven't read alot. but i started it the other day when i had to wake up at 8. read it all day. barely got through chapter 2. i'm easily distracted. and i tend to read sentences more than once. but i love this author b/c everything she writes is set in England. and it's so different. 
speaking of England...i saw Troy today ( i know it's not in England). but they had accents. and i was thinking to myself that i really wish i had an accent. i think that would be awesome. i dont think i could fake one though. maybe i should get a vocal coach person and they could teach me. b/c a chick i knew married an English guy and she picked up the accent but then she left him...and so did the accent. maybe i could just pick it up. mel gibson lost his accent being away from Australia for so long. oh well. 
Troy was awesome by the way. everyone should go see it. maybe it's just b/c i'm totally into all those kinds of movies that are historical and sorta fictional and romantic and what not. 
i just realized i have been talking for a long time now. so i'm going to read my book. probably fall asleep at some point. but i'm gonna try and stay awake. alix is coming over tomorrow so she can prepare me for the third harry potter movie by letting me see the first two. i'm excited. i should read those books. but i just dont think i'd get into them. maybe i dont know. ok i'm gone. bye for now"

so ne ways. i woke up super early today to go with my grandma to the doctors even though i didn't need to. then my mom left and i went to lunch with my aunt and grandma. then we went shopping and they dropped me off like two hours too late. i wanted to take a nap but i couldn't. so i have just been cleaning (b/c i'm freakishly anally clean) and listening to music and watching tv. with no nap. oh well. i'm good. cleaning keeps me awake. 

i watched oprah today and it was about couples and the men have cheated on the wives. and i was thinking to myself that i dont know if i could forgive my husband for cheating on me as easily as these women have. i'm not saying that i would never. but it would be ultra hard to. it's hard to imagine your loved one naked with someone else doing what y'all should only be doing. it's just a touchy subject that hurts, so dont do it! lol. ok but really it sucks. so think before you act. 

umm the swiffer wetjet is, in my opinion, the coolest thing ever invented. b/c i have just been cleaning the floors for the past like hour and it's too much fun. i think i could be a housewife forever if i had this thing. and had like six kids, but other than that, i'd like to work. lol. massage therapy all the way (call me, a buck a minute) 

ok i have to go now b/c my kitties are getting lonely and are crying like babies. have a great weekend. i know i am going to.

"event","so i'm finally finished with my finals. and now i just have to work two more days and go home on friday. then goodbye san antonio. :( but yay for going home :). i can't wait to see my amanda, ahizzie, and matty poo poo. so saying goodbye to my friends is going to be killer. i dont think i can do it. i know i'm going to cry. gotta be strong. i'll visit so it'll be ok.
so i'm alittle upset with my hair b/c my roots are growing in. and i thought i got the right color when i dyed my hair the last time. but no. too red. so i decided i'm not going to go with the natural look ne more. i'm going with the light brown hair and black lowlights. give me your feedback. i think it's going to rock personally. even though britney spears stole my idea, the skank. oh well. no hard feelings. b/c mine's going to look better. i'll end up dyeing it back again later ne ways. speaking of looks. i'm getting my nose pierced. not b/c of amanda...which my mother thinks is the reason. but b/c i want to. everyone looks so cute with it that i've seen. and i have a cute nose. so bring it on. i spoke with my mom about it and she's not on the train but i'm persuading her slowly. as is my brother, he's such a sport. always on my side. along with the piercing i'm thinking about getting another tattoo. either the infinity sign (sideways number 8) or the outline of texas with a star where fort worth is. both on my lower back....texas would be on the butt..well more like love handle area lol. 
sad thing happened. my favorite cousin, erick, went to peru without me. he went yesterday along with his sisters. :( that makes me sad b/c i haven't been there in over 4 years. i want to go and see my family and eat food and buy jewelry and stuff. no fair. but erick might come see me when he gets back. b/c if i dont see him now then i won't get to see him for another 6 months b/c he's leaving again. damn the navy. i wont get to see him til christmas. but on a lighter note he said he would buy me a webcam for christmas so we can see eachother when we talk. how fun. he said he would buy me something when he's over there. so yay for peruvian stuff. i miss it lots. oh well i have to go next year with my mom and grandma. I HAVE TO HAVE TO HAVE TO!!!!!
so smoking is bad, but i picked it up. bad bad bad habit. such a good destresser. i know alix won't like that new little fact. but i wont do it in front of you alix. speaking of alix, i can't wait to go to starbucks. yummm coffee. i've waited for so long. maybe i should get a job there. work with alix. super. or maybe i should just work with amanda and be molested all day and smell like fajitas. sooo....starbucks it is. i wouldn't want to work with amanda. i'd get so annoyed that i'd throw a plate at her head. ok not really, but maybe some napkins. lol. 
working tomorrow and friday then i dont work at the wellness center ne more. but i'm keep the damn shirts. they are cool. something to remember. no more finals. happy birthday tiffany (may 6th) and kelly aka k-dawg (may 8th). you girls rock my freaking world. then i have to turn in my books and make some money off them. and sleep forever!
going to see 13 going on 30 tomorrow and eating at La Madeline with my girls. yay one more night out. :( we'll make it special. 
ok i have to pee and go to bed so i can wake up by 8 tomorrow. love y'all. peace!"

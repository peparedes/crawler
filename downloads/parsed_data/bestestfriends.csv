She stared intently as we glared at the stage and the screen, ""I dunno, but if its a guy he's cute."" =D
Silly people...

"event","OMG I can't believe we had to watch that stupid movie on how to turn on and off a computer and use a mouse. Just getting the damn VCR to work was what we need to learn. ""The left button is the one that will be primarely used...blah blah blah."" That summer was the first I'd heard the phrase ""kick it""...remember that guy who was in a gang and kept saying we should go kick it and he'd give us the codes to sim city. So fun...we got A's because we sucked up and lmao remember the morphing thing we had to do and we turned a man into a dog or something and we spent like 4 days on that and it was a peice of crap but she loved it...omg yay."

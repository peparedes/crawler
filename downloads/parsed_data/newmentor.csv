"event","Anna stayed with me last night.  She brought me a citrus gel-candle, and I am wondering if this is a not-so-subtle way of telling me that my new apartment stinks.

She and Stephanie spent the night, and let me tell you that a certain amount of prowess is involved in fitting two people into a twin bed.  But she is very pretty...she has a face I see in dreams, and her beauty is not linear.  Scott seems to like Steph, so I think he was satisfied with the arrangement.  No, there wasn't any sex involved (at least between myself and Anna), we simply shared a bed.

Scott's roots are growing in.  Stephanie thinks they're sexy, and I had to laugh.  She says he looks like an unkempt Brad Pitt.  Well, I wish Mr. Pitt would fix up the wiring for his electronics - the mass has taken over half the room.  Sure it looks formidable, if not intimidating to the casual passer by, but I'm tired of waking up and stepping on surge protectors (yes, he currently has two), or tripping on a stray wire.  His mixed-breed Frankensteinian PC may operate like a dream, but I'm sure it wouldn't be affected by a little...taming.

Anyway, Michael and Jake are over here now, and we're going to go eat after a little while."

"event","I have had a fun, however, exhausting weekend, and I wish everyone else the same.  The beach is not half so lively without the comfort of friends, which can be a blessing or a curse (interpret that as you will).  It is undeniable, however, that sunsets alone are nowhere near to being as lovely as I found them to be with these companions; my dearest and beautiful Anna, you warm my heart and dwarf that natural splendor - you are my sun that never sets.  I hope that I will always be able to look upon you as a friend.

Be this as it may, I still have work awaiting me.  Coming home to paperwork is less than desirable, but c'est la vie, n'est ce pas?  

PS: I hate to sully this journal with my personal life, but I feel it should be done.  I do not want to convey the impression that I am attempting to hide anything.  ::wink::"

"event","My dear Brianna,
I am honored that you list me as a friend.  While I understand that it may be solely to keep track of any less-than-ordinary developments, I do appreciate the thought, and would like to return the favor."

"event","What a pity...it seems Daniel has deleted my entry as Carrie on his Live Journal, and changed his password, at that.  I expected this to happen eventually.  Has he taken up censorship, I wonder?  Well, that was after Carrie referred to me as the ""anonfuck"" and a piece of shit, and chided me about being immature.  My, my... that has truly made my day.

In addition - I hope no one honestly thinks that I would give him or her the pleasure of personally ingesting cyanide or Drano.  ::snickers::  Silly, silly people...

And my parents don't beat me (to my knowledge), by way of clarification - I have been told that they would be hard-pressed to catch me.  =)

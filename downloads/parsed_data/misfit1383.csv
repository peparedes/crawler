p.s. = if anyone has a jeep cherokee and you need me to replace your steering box you'd better give me $300 or you're shit out of luck. especially if it's more than 10 years old and/or has more rust than the titannic. those things are the worst ever. everyone should just buy wranglers. 

has anyone seen that commercial for burger king's new line of ""stacker"" hamburgers? there's the double stacker with 2 beef patties, cheese, and bacon., the tripple stacker with 3 patties, and the quadrupple stacker with, you guessed it, 4 (FOUR) burger patties with cheese and bacon...4 FRIGGIN' BURGER PATTIES! that's like instant heart attack right there. plus since i've pretty much stopped eatting red meat all together, it seems even more rediculous. and they wonder why people are getting fat? jeez, all you need is eyes to see with.

"event","rebel meets rebel - nothin' to lose

[woman moaning]

I am a gambler, God knows, I've been around
I've lived it up and now I'm livin' it down
I've played some hunches, and I've played some blues
A man with nothing ain't got nothing to lose

I thought my woman was my ace in the hole
But when she left me I was out of control
I've just had bad luck since I got the news
A man with nothing ain't got nothing to lose

Old lady luck ain't nobody's friend
And old dame fortune broke my heart in the end
Love was the one thing I tried not to abuse
A man with nothing ain't got nothing to lose

I like casinos and I love slot machines
I lost a fortune, if you know what I mean
Those one armed bandits was the wrong thing to choose
A man with nothing ain't got nothing to lose

You wanna help me, do you know where I'm at?
Don't try to change me girl, it's too late for that
You say ""quit gambling"" and I'll have to refuse
A man with nothing aint got nothing to lose

I lost it all, I don't have no more to give
The doctor tells me I don't have long to live
My friends all say they'd hate to be in my shoes
A man with nothing ain't got nothing to lose

[woman moaning]

You say salvation is the one thing I need
It's hell or heaven that I'm just a bad seed
What makes you think you have the right to accuse
A man with nothing ain't got nothing to lose

Nothin' to lose
Nothin' to lose
Nothin' to lose"

"event","funniest thing happened to me this morning. i'm driving to go to work and i'm about to get onto the route 3 west entrance ramp when suddenly my car sounds like i stuck a big block in it. then a few seconds later i hear BANG! SHHHHHHH!!!! i immediately piss myself, recover, pull over and see what it was. well it seems my exhaust broke from terrible rust right at the junction between the muffler and the intermediate pipe at the whole muffer/tailpipes assembly and was still secured by the rubber support strap. i pondered what to do. for the first time in my life i had no tools in my car. i called my brother twice to ask him to bring my tool set, but he doesn't answer. when all was lost, i got an idea. i improvized. reall mcguiver shit. i found a car cell phone charger in the back seat so i used it to hold the muffler/tailpipe assembly up off the ground while i drove the car home. success! it held!! i was really liking how the car sounded like i had 454 in it, but it was a tad too loud. plus it kinda sounded like an old work truck. so in a few hours i'll be ordering a new exhaust and some other goodies. mmm shiny exhaust =D"

"event","i had the longest day of work ever. so long i almost fell asleep when i sat down. people really do just suck balls. well, the ones that aren't my friends and come into my store. i really need a new job. one in my future profession. i hate being a manual laborer that get's paid peanuts. i worked 40 hours 2 weeks ago and i make $9/hr, so 9x40=$360. then there's taxes. what i actually got paid was $284 and change. they took $75 in taxes out of my freaking check!!! motherfuckers! 

the GTA got done today, though before i left rob's house there was a slight puddle under the car and now i'm paranoid. if there's a puddle tomorrow morning i'll have to call rob to do some emergency surgery before cruise night. fuck i hate it when i don't do things myself but this time i had no choice. i never changed a timing chain and gear nor do i have the few essential tools to do it. well, i'm really hoping that the puddle was a fluke and the oil smell was just remaining oil burning off. atleast i ride my bike to work =P you just gotta look for that silver lining."

"event","the GTA has been given another year on it's life!! i now don't have to worry about selling it, storing it far away or worring about some nut job doing god knows what to it. as a famous bumper sticker stated: ""my wife, sure. my dog, maybe. but my pontiac?...NEVER"""

"event","alright, i might be (80% positive) getting a new car. A truck specifically. '05 chevy silverado 1500 4X4. This purchase has put my dear '88 GTA at risk. i cannot have insurance on both cars and i can't keep it at my house. The only options i have at this time, to my knowledge are: 1) find a garage for rent and keep it there, or 2) sell it. for all you people who know me personally, you know that i'd rather go through some sort of gruesome torture than sell my car. however, at this time i really don't know what to do. i know if i sell it i won't get her back again and i'll be kicking myself for the rest of my life. all advise is welcome.

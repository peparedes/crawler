"event","I enjoyed the Town Hall style given to the debate.

Lesse. I felt that the debate was over heavy on the War; by my estimation, about or over an hour of the two hour affair was dedicated to it. I think this hurt Edwards, whose main appeal is his very strong deomestic base. Even Cooper admited that they had gotten a huge amoun of submissions about the issue of health care, yet...5-7 minutes, and that's because a couple of the candidates cheated and slipped in their views when the question was immigration which got even less time.

Obama showed his inexperience, I felt, in the inconsistincy of his strength. On Foreign policy, for example, he was confident, well spoken, and mostly, I feel, right. However, in other areas he just simply wasn't well informed. 

Hillary may have been more direct, or whatever, but the thing is, her 'more direct' answers weren't to my taste, compared to the rest. Also, her idea that any democrat there would by virtue of being a democrat be beter than anyone else offended me, a bit.

Biden was good, and would make a great VP; but I could see him in the Presidency, too. I think he could back up a more inexperienced candidate, such as Obama or Edwards, very well.

Richardson hadn't much crossed my mind, but I did like his approach. I just don't think he's big enough.

Edwards is still my preference, though. His point on a personal seperation between faith beliefs and the ones put to paper were very much to my taste.

I could swear that I'd read somethng about Lily Evans and Snape in the past. It might have just been a fanfic I'm remembering, but was there some hint of this in the series?

Also, I got a huge rush of deja-vous at the ""NOT MY DAUGHTER, YOU BITCH!"" Again, fanfic, or just craziness?

EDIT (first of many): Reading the bit about the cloak reenforces one of the many things which bothered me about the first movie; I thought the cloak behaved wrongly. It does look like one ""imbued with a Disillusionment Charm,"" rather than one which truly makes the user utterly, undetectibly invisible.

Edit: The Doe thing also seems like an intensly farmiliar subject, to the point where I'm paranoidedly wondering if perhaps JKR wrote a fanfic plant or something to put these ideas out, or summat. I mean, really, I could swear it's soemthing I'd heard of, but can remember no metion of in the books.

Indiana Jones; oooooooooooo.oh baby.
Crazy ass car show; oooooooh baby.
Actually, the 'ride of the movies' (I can't remember the name of the ride exactly) was pretty good.
Star Tours effectively caused me to truly realize the change which will be the lack of the Seniors leaving; in wondering the cannon-ical implications of the ride, I realized just how empty our senior class is of people who would find that even marginally interesting.
I also noticed just how much I think of friends. While I make something of a deal over how friendless I consider myself, I managed to filter almost everything I saw through my friends. I was at the park alone, yet when I watched the car show, I was wondering what Manhar would think of it of; with the Muppets, I was figuring how awesome of a Miss Piggy Christine would make, etc.

I don't know that this is a bad thing, but it is a thing true. This leaves me an issue: my path. Basically, I look to change; to self improve. I'm looking into The Marines, and I see to add discipline to my life no matter; I seek to shape up, if nothing else.

"event","I came to what may be an important (for me) realization today on the drive home, and I hope to all that it doesn't make me emo; unfortunately, it seems to perfectly fit (almost) into the definition I gave to someone on a comment a few days ago. 
There are two major sides to my personality; this is true on many levels, with many different aspects which fall into this duality. That's one of the major contributors, likely, to my rather firm observation of a tendency toward duality in all; but I digress. In this case, I refer to probably my most obvious dual nature; in basic demeanor. There is the side which I imagine most people associate with me; the hyperactive, unthinking-response, bloody well LOUD, always begging for attention me. Then there is the side of me which I think is less shown; something of an uber-introvert. I happen to be, as it turns out, extremely shy at times. This me is, as I said, shy, quiet, and tends to like sitting in corners.
Um, the reason for all this is that someone commented today that I seemed 'down,' though I'd guess that that has more to do with that, lesse...Vic is on vacation, out of contact, Bridg and Isabel, and, less new, Melissa, aren't at swing for reasons various, and I have almost no social contact at the moment, which means that my down me is somewhat more the dominant one right now, since it's the one oftener on.
Anyway, the point I was making; the realization to which I have come, is that I simply prefer the quieter me. Since that me is more depressive, or at least seems to be depressive, and since that's the person I prefer to be, that I want to be, that I'm prouder to be...
If you read Westley's comments, you may see my quandary about now.
The thing is that I don't think that the depressive bit is why I prefer that me; it's that that's the me who's more of, well, the thinker; the more intellectual; the deeper...
Again, if you read Westley's comments...
Well, I'm not cutting myself, I still think, in fact, that that's a stupid idea, though I can understand masochism to an extent, and I'm not crying like a bitch, and I don't wear eye makeup, and I wear gray with black, so...
I dunno, I came upon this within me, and I felt like posting it, so..."

Anyway, actually check this one out, svp; lemme know what you think of it.
And yes, I know that it's a horrible title, very emo sounding; but I didn't want it to go down as 'My Song."" I'll think up a good title soon, promise. I think that the song is pretty good; at least the music is...but lemme know what YOU think.

It's the one called 'lovehate|hatelove'

YES, I KNOW THAT THE TITLE SUCKS!

EDIT: New Title: Nothing's Right."

"event","Let me start with father's homily. I thought a lot of it was bullshit. He got into how he had to add a year or something to his opening so it would ""make sense."" That pissed me off. Oh and then he brought out the child scaring bit with the ""maybe your parents don't love you because you don't do what they say when they say it all the time."" Give me a fucking break.

/sigh

I don't know about this whole religion thing anymore. We all scoff at the ancient mythologies. Didn't Zeus have a child on Earth or something? Mary having a child without having sex seems highly unlikely. If God is around, why hasn't he done anything sginificant in the past 2000+ years? Bah I say. I can't accept that anymore. Not right now.

I feel like I am caught in a transition. As a child you just blindly accept things because you don't know any better. Quite frankly I would rather have that then the state I am in right now. That's selfish though. I haven't gotten to my ""I found a belief I can totally live with"" stage yet. I hope I never do. But I also don't want to be stuck in this transition for the rest of my life. Thinking for yourself can be very stressful a lot of times..."

"event","I wrote this up one night.

Man uses shape to increase effieciency. Shape was always there (somtimes happens, roughly, in nature), but nature either doesn't regard (almost 100% likely), or can't use it to it's advantage. Nature does fine without shape; why can't man?

Because man can't ""thrive"" without efficiency; which is contrary to nature. Nature is not trying to live like a god or gods. Therefore, man really is living like, or trying to live like, gods. When man does this, it is bound to destroy itself. Does this mean that the god or gods themselves are bound to destroy themselves or that in man trying to live like that is not possible and in so doing destroy themselves? If it's the former, then are a god or gods not perfect?

Nature can ""thrive,"" but it always has balance. Man thriving cannot be balance."

"event","So here it is, October 25th, 2004, at 1:13 AM. I can't remember the last entry I made because of two reasons. First, it's been a very long time. Second, I didn't put all of my feelings into them. What good is a journal when you can't even totally let loose? That's what a journal is for. Maybe one reason is that I know at least one person can read anything I don't specifically lock. Then I think what good is locking it when in reality I want that one person to read it.

Ok enough explaining that or I will forget what I really want to put down. (There is a lot on my mind; very jumbled up right now) I think I'll start with what I did this weekend and how it really made me open my eyes. I thought drinking was just good to have a good social event and to make you feel good. It does that very well, but it also (in some cases) can help you with your problems. I was fortunate to be able to speak with one of my friends Mark Murphy at a house party Saturday night.

The biggest thing I realized this weekend is that siblings really are the closest a person can be to you. I realized that I can be open with my sister not just because I know how good of a person she is, but that even if she wasn't, she is the only person who truly can understand me. (No I am not drunk I have not a drop in me) Now that I've gotten that out, I think I can go on to the things that have been bothering me.

I Want to do High School Over. I shouldn't say that because it can't happen and it is selfish anyways. I'm Not Sure if College is Right for Me. Is it because I'm lazy or is it really not for me? I've Been Fretting Over Stupid Things. Namely, not being able to get a girlfriend. Why should I be worrying about something like that when I can't even set myself straight? I Have No Idea What I Want. That's probably the main reason I'm so confused about almost everything. I'm used to direction, and now that I am an adult I have a lot less of it. Now that I'm at college and already screwing myself over, I feel I can't turn back. I don't know if that's bad or good because I'm not sure if I should be here or not.

I can't think anymore tonight (this morning.) Steph, I love you.

I'm done. Craig"

"event","ever play a mmorpg? like star wars galaxies? it's basically a game where you get to create a character with whatever likeness you please and according to predetermined skill systems and areas, develop that character. in two ways mostly, wealth and social areas. is this not unlike real life? mmorpgs are very open ended, with no set goals for you to accomplish unless you choose to.

i've been thinking about college a lot, since i will be there in just under a month. it's very exciting and scary. scary not because of how big madison is, but scary because one part of my life is closing and a new one is  unfolding. i often think about life after college, and quickly realised that school really doesn't suck that much after all. i plan on making the most out of my last (i think) four years of my education. 

and steph, i haven't talked to you in a long time, nor seen you. here it is straight up, i miss you. i can't wait to move down to madison. i neglected my journal, but its okay. i read yours about once a week, but i just don't usually have much to say. and thats the end of that.

"event","I have problems with the idea of having a girlfriend. Once this occurs, I have to probably hug and crap. I don't know why, but I just don't think I was put on this world for this kind of stuff. I dunno, I'm just messed up :)

But yeah, maybe im just too immature and need to grow up?

And one more thing, does .9~ = 1? I say it does essentially, and also proves that 0 does have value. First let's figure that the complementary part to .9~ is .0~ with a 1 at the end. If the .9 never stops repeating, then we can assume that the 1 on the part that makes .9~ a 1 never occurs. So: 1 - .9~ = 0 right? Well, 0 has value, or 1 = .9~

Phew, too much thinking for one night. Im out."

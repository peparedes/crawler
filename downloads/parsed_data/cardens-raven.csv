"event","Yea. Basically need to update.... But screw that. I'm not one for updates. At least not any more apparently... Long story. Not going into that. You don't want to know.\

Alright to start off I've been having a real rough week. Monday I had a root canal done. It was actually ok but my tooth still feels like clay my mouth. I haven't had the crown placed on it yet. Probably won't for another 2 weeks. So that means another 2 weeks with clay in my mouth. Alright so I really just slept the rest of the day. It felt REALLY nice to do so to. I needed that sleep.

I get back to school on Tuseday, all fine except I couldn't move my jaw because it was so sore from the root canal. So I'm writing everything i want to say in sharpie in a spare journal I had. That was interesting. I played hang-man with myself. It was quite fun. I won ^^. So that wasn't the point. I get the stuff I missed blah blah blah (still haven't done history notes that I need to turn in) and then I go to one teacher and she tells me I missed the registration asembly. Which basically all it is is where they give us the damn forms for next year and they talk about different stuff (aka the raised tuition for next year). Yes I go to a private school. (<<*points to school* It sucks.... >>). So I figured no big deal. The forms aren't due for another 2 weeks. Later I was looking through the book to see what new classes I can take and so on and so on. Then I get to the English department of it. I look at it and see something that I didn't want to see. Here's me in my head. ""O.O WTF!? WHEN DID THIS F&#$^@& THING HAPPEN!?"" New rule states that for me to get into <b>AP Literature</b>, I <u>HAVE</u> to be 'invited'. For one I already know that they won't invite me. Every one (as far as adults) at that damned school, including my damn shrink and doc, believe that <putting this into their terms> ""Your brain wouldn't be able to handle the stress. What's the point since people like you don't even get into college?"" Yes they have said that to me. I couldn't stand to look at the form or anything in there (even though now we have an actuall Acting class that I want to join). It just seriously pissed me off. I couldn't even say anything out loud because of my tooth. I tried talking to a couple friends about it but it only made me worse. I don't cry normally and usually don't but that night and in to the next day, I just felt like shit. Because writing has always been my biggest passion. I've always done so well at it and for me not to get in to that class, it just makes me feel ""why bother when what they say is probably true? I am always wrong, I am the challenged and stupid one. What is the point in living when I'm always dragged to the last thread and no one pulls me back up?"" Yes that is true. I do think that when I'm depressed. And it is true. I don't really have any one to look up to. I just get sooooo jealous when I think I've found some one. 

There really has only been 3 people I've looked up to. Dante Bichette (I love baseball so shut up), Kristy Yamaguchi (I wanted to be a figure skater and go to the olympics and be just like her), and my 3rd and 4th grade english teacher. She was the one who actually inspired me to start and keep writing. But then she left and a new teacher came and she hated me and my writing. She believed it to be of poor quality and far below average. I no longer had some one to really look up to. That teacher died in a car accident later on. And sorry to say this but she deserved it. She's the one that completely brought me down and I have never been able to really climb back up. I've just held on for this long. In six grade I didn't have any ""real"" friends. I didn't know what to do because my friends from elementary school, practically shunned me aside even though I was the one they looked up to because I was brave enough to stand up for myself and not care or be afraid of what people told me. I was their hero. Not any more. I never see or even talk to them any more. In 6th grade I was always pushed aside, teased, didn't really have a real group of friends. Every one pretty much hated me. So I was always sitting alone a lot and working alone. I couldn't even write to a great extent because my teachers and peers always continued to push me aside. My parents didn't even notice. All they paid any attention to was my sister. Not even going to go into that. You know, the only time, that I actually remember, when my mom was actually proud of me, and I didn't have any one was to bring me down, was when I told her that I wanted to be a figure skater and wanted to go to the olympics. That was the only time I've actually seen her proud of me. And that was when I was 5. One year before my sister came. I'm not trying to blame anything on any one. And the only time I actually saw my dad proud of me was when I played softball for 4 years. That was it. Then I got a shoulder injury and I couldn't exactly play the sport any more. 

Now I really don't know what to do. I got back into writing in seventh grade because I found it as an escape from reality. By then I had a few friends to keep me going. If I hadn't had come across them, I assure you that I would've been dead by now. I couldn't stand it. No friends, no one to support me, nothing. I wasn't as depressed as I have been for the passed couple of years I'll say but I really didn't have any one. Sure I had like maybe one crush (won't say who and I know that some of you wouldn't be familiar with him anyways) but he was an idiot. Not the kind of idiot that would just be spoiled and very stupid that they'd do anything to get attention. He was more along the lines of the idiotic kind type. Not many people know this but he did stand up for me and we did talk more as we got in to 8th grade but then after that, never saw or spoke to each other since. No affence but I seriously believe he's dead by now. I didn't figure it out until the summer after 8th grade how much he really cared for me... It kind of makes me wonder. But I won't say any more then that. The only thing I have left is some pictures and the year books (where did I put those?).

So now I think that I'm just going to talk to my teacher and see if she could let me get into AP or not. But I really don't know what to say. I should think about it tonight and see what comes up. Good news is that they'll let me do AP US History. Of course as far as I know its boring as hell and is only review but it is better then the normal class which is good. 

Another good thing is that I'm getting paid to help my friend in chemistry. Sad thing is that I understand everything in Chemistry, but I can't get worth shit in algebra. It really is sad. But o well. If there's money involved then sure, why not? Don't have any where else to be after school anyways. Another good thing is that I got to see the school production of ""The Pink Panther Strikes Again"" and they did an amazing job. Sure there were a few cue's that were off... nevermind a lot of cue's were off and the play went by way to fast. But it was amazing. The cast was put well together (well except two girls that the theater people hate except our director) and the crew did very well as well. It was quite hilarious. I was going to do crew since I did last year but I don't know what happened, I just stopped. I will next year though. I need something to keep me entertained and trust me, the drama geeks always keep you entertained. Cake wars are fun ^^. And after seeing it one of my friends mentioned that I would actually make a pretty good theater/play critic. And it got me thinking that it could work out as a side job if my writing doesn't get any where.

Last two things. Very short. I got my Borders Rewards Card and my Wicked book came in the mail today! ^^ Tonight has been the only exciting night since... well forever it seems like. 

Alright enough typing this. I've been typing all this for the last 30 - 45 minutes. I need to stop ranting but hey, I updated! ^^;;;"

~*~

Today was MUCH better. Kinda sad when its the day after christmas and everything seems better. Anyways mum took me to Hot Topic where we were supposed to get this one shirt I wanted but the lady in front of us had to take the last one, in MY SIZE TO! Oh well. My mum still let me get a couple other shirts (one of which was a Corpse Bride shirt) and pants. And since everything was on sale, i got 3 things that would've cost me the same amount if I got just that one shirt. So everything worked out. I guess I could make that shirt, just in my own style and way. We'll see.

After that my mom took me to Jo Annes to get fabric and some stuff because my mom signed me up for a sewing class. Apparently we're going to make PJ bottoms. O well. I got a pretty cool fabric. Black with white swirls. Meh. Class is only a couple hours long tomorrow and Wensday. 

Then later, when I was complaining about being really bored and nothing to do, my dad took me and my sis to Media Play. Which sad to say they're going out of buisness. Yup. Closing all stores across America. Sad to. They had the best, BEST anime sections there were. When we got there, the store was practially gone already. The things I was looking for, wasn't there any more. EVERYTHING was on sale apart from the usual shop the day after x-mas sale. Hard to find a lot of things now. But I found 3 DVD's that were used but in really good shape of Yu Yu Hakusho. begining of the Makai Tournament. I just need the last DVD and I'll be done. Which most likely I'll have to get like at SunCoast or Sam Goody. Unless I could find it on the Barns N Noble website then I could use my gift card my cousin sent me. *evil grin* THANKS AGAIN PAUL! ^^ I'll look later. 

Wensday afternoon I leave for New Mexico. NOT, I repeat, NOT NOT happy about that. We going down to see my damn cousin who hates me. I'm the only one in the family she hates. She just loves my mom. And what makes it worse is that she's pregnant. Ok she won't even let me watch her son who likes me because she thinks something will happen (and apparently I'm the one that will make whatever it is happen) when she's not there or looking. She does not trust me one bit. And unless I can track down one of my favorite authors who lives in albe-however you spell the damn city, I'll have nothing to do. Most likely will be staying the whole time trying to amuse myself in the Hotel room. I'll bring some books and other stuff to do. *sigh* 

O well. Enough ranting or whatever. Time to get back to working on ideas and characters for my novel."

"event","Yea. Merry Christmas and all that stuff. *sigh* So today's christmas and all and I was really excited to open my gifts. So I open them, I got a few things I enjoyed, but everything else was, wtf? So I look around, no more gifts, and so I'm thinking; Where are the things I was dieing to get? I didn't get them. Instead I get sweats that are WAY to big for me. My aunt sent them in size 8-9. I wear size 3. Even then I wouldn't wear them if they were my size. I can't stand wearing that color of white. I hate white. I despise it. So that didn't go over to well. I didn't show what I really thought about it though. I couldn't. I guess it was kind of obvious that my mom and dad wouldn't get me anything from Hot Topic. Cht. I think about it and from my list I got only 4 of the things I wanted and they were the things that were sort of at the bottom. I didn't get anything of what I was really hoping for. I got a couple gift cards to Borders, Barns N Noble, kholes.... HELL WHEN DO I EVER GO TO KHOLES!? I HATE THAT STORE! And heres the worse side to it. Some of the gifts, that had my name on it (apparently by accident), were supposed to be for my sister. So that was a waste. So I guess I can still dream. But where will that get me? Nothing has come true yet. I dream and dream for things that I know will never happen. I try to make them happen but they all just go to hell in the end anyways.

So Merry whatever-you-celebrate and good luck following your dreams."

"event","Alright so as you all know Christmas is drawing in fast. Yipee! I can't wait... and yet I want to. This year has been really... troublesome. Earlier this year my grandpa had died after battling 5 years of cancer. Every one loved him. He was the one that kept the whole family glued together. It was sad and glad at his funeral when you saw every one who could attend and people that I haven't met before. And now this year will be the first year without my grandpa so no calls saying the usuall ""We love you. Did you get our card and check? Do you have a boyfriend yet?"" He's not here. And my grandmother has alzeimers. So everything is just weird. Later (like july) my mother had lost her job. She was the one who made the most money in our house. She earned twice as much as my dad is making now. My mom has sort of an off job if you will call it that. It's basically a sell product, earn 15% of the total sold, kind of deal. Its not much and it doesn't really help. But thats all she's been paying attention to. *sighs* On top of all of that my depression and Gastritis has been the worst this year. There are times I've been thinking of suicide (it is my last resort) and my gastritis has been severely painful. In November it was the worst. I missed an entire week of school at home screaming because it hurt so much. I couldn't sleep, couldn't eat, I couldn't even get on the freaking computer because every time I moved it set it off. I lost four or five pounds that week (don't worry I gained it back). I hate the medication I have to take and I hate the diet I'm on. I'm basically limited to bland foods. It sucks. Of course I don't listen to the doctor because I hate every one who tries to make your life better when all they're doing is making worse by trying to order you to do this and that. If my acid reflex acts up again then let it. I really don't care at this point. I am watching what I eat and I am eating what I want to eat. So far so good. I guess the only good thing about my acid reflex meds is that it basically doesn't give me access to depression meds. Good. I'm not taking meds to control my emotions. Ok enough of that.

Up to this point I have noticed something going on within the family ever since my grandpa passed away. Traditions have slipped. My dad has been really... off lately. He's basically been secluding himself from us and keeps on trying to do every thing on his own. A few days ago when we were decorating the tree, he waited until we were done with our oranaments and then he did his. And after that, when it was time to make cookies, he didn't want to. He said that we had enough help as it was. My sister doesn't even want to do anything with us. She didn't even help with the tree. All she cares about is the TV and video games. I mean I don't care for her much but usually she doesn't mind doing things with us around this time. I guess I know whats with my mom. She's been thinking of my grandpa (he was her dad) and how this will be the first christmas without him to give us cheer. I know. Its hard on me as well. I loved my grandpa to death. And to think I just talked to him a few days before he passed away to tell me good luck with my confirmation. Now I can't talk to him at all. None of us can. *sighs* Just something we'll have to get used to. But yes. Our family is breaking apart. I'll just have to see how christmas goes this year and see if we'll actually be celebrating it together. I doubt it but you never know. I'm making dinner so that will put every one at the table. At least it better. 

Man I wanna open presents now. I want to know what I got. But from what I can tell my sister will be getting the most. I was looking at all the gifts in the basement before my dad put them under the tree and out of 20 gifts, 1 was mine and it was a DVD. Which DVD I do not know. But the rest were my sisters. Big and small. Mostly big. I don't mind getting little (concidering I have no room to place things at the moment) but its the fact that my sister is praised in this family more then I. I'm not going to bother telling you guys the whole damn story. I've told it too many times and I get angry just hearing it. 

O well. Enough of that. I'll just have to see how this year goes. Just hope next year might be better when we actually go back to Michigan. This year we're staying here in 50 degree-no snow colorado-for christmas. 

Later"

"event","I'm depressed right now and I don't need people telling me to get over it. You wanna know why? I can't. Don't believe me? Then just shut the fuck up and get on with your life and let me live mine. You don't control what I do. It's me to decide what goes on in my fucking life and I don't need you to tell me what's right and what's wrong. I already know the hell is right and wrong and I already know that maybe being depressed is not the right thing. But guess what? I don't give a rats damn about it. It's my life. Stay out right now and let me live it my way. 

Right now I feel like I'm on the verge of suicide. No one is helping. They're making it worse. I'll admit that maybe 60% of it is my fault but the other 40% is all of you. I'm failing school right now and I could really care less because no matter what I do nothing is going to help. Don't tell me to see a councelor because for all you shrinks out there, go burn in hell and then get torn apart piece by piece until theres nothing left. Thats right. I hate shrinks because talking to them is like taking a swim in Antartica with nothing but shorts and a sleeve-less shirt. Don't tell me to take anti-depresants because I am NOT and I repeat NOT taking any more medicine. I'm already taking protonix and carafate that taste even worse then alcohol and you just wanna puke it back up. That is for my acid-reflex and I'm already sick of it to begin with. According to something I've read a new study has shone that acid-reflex can result in cancer. So what does that tell you losers? I'm going to get cancer? You are correct! But you don't win anything. You don't deserve anything. 

Finals are coming up in a couple weeks and I already know which ones I'm going to fail even if I do get help. It always happens. I blank. There's nothing to do to stop it. My brain has a mind of its own. Get over it. And that part is constricting me from doing things I wish I could. I do not have a photographic memory, I do need the extra help, but all the bastards that are supposed to be helping me aren't. They're helping other kids who have the ability to suceed. They shouldn't be. My parents have them to help me. But they're not. My parents are paying an $8000 tuition just for me to go to this school which isn't any better then any other damn school. It may be smaller but everyone are shelfish, rich brats who only think about themselves. It's even amazing that I have friends. But guess what. My group is tearing themselves apart. They're blaming every body else, they're having their damn feuds and won't get over it. Only order me to take sides and so that makes me loose friends. The god damn administration is making it worse. It's like they're against me. I've been forced to do things this year against my will and even forced to join classes against my will because ""I need the help."" THEY DON'T EVEN DO ANYTHING HELPFUL IN THAT DAMN CLASS ANYWAYS! I can't get out of it. I'm forced to stay. And now I have this goddamn mural I need to finish on friday and I only have very little of the damn thing done. They wan't me to have a social life. I'm forced to go to this damn dance on Saturday which my mom is making a big deal out of it because she thinks I'll ""meet a nice boy and live happily ever after"". O grow up. I'm staying single. I want to stay single. Love is for the people who want to see themselves get hurt. It only makes your life worse and for those who have stayed together, I congradulate you. But let me ask you something. Is that the fairy tale dream you've always dreamed of? It's not. Thats life. End of your happily ever after and straight into the pits of hell. 

I am screwed. My art has been getting worse and worse. I actually love art. But its just been in hell. I have been drawing things so out of proportion its not even funny. No one really seems to enjoy my art either. The teachers at my school think that what I draw is a low art form. It has no meaning. It doesn't have the history behind it. WELL BULLSHIT! Not all art is history and it's NOT a low art form! Instead we're forced to do things they find a ""High art form"". I actually used to enjoy my work. Now all I see it going is straight into the dumpster and burned till there's nothing more. Even my writing which I loved is now gone. I've been hating every bit of it. To me it seems like I'm back in third grade when I'm writing it. Third grade. Do you know how low that is for me? So now I'm stuck reading and seeing other people's work that makes me jealous. I know I'll never excel as high as them. It's been getting worse and worse from the beginning. Nothing matters.

Every one (including that damn brat my parentals call my sibling) will make it in life. My friends, my family, every one will surpass me in everything that I loved to do. No one will recognize my work and no one will ever concider my talents that I'll never have. I can't even see myself going to college or even graduating high school. I'll be held back and I'll never make it. People won't wait for me. They'll go on while I'm left in hell while still living with my parents that I wish got rid of me when I was born. That way they wouldn't have to put up with the failiur I really am. 

So that's it. I won't make it. There is no point. No one cares. No one ever will. It's over. I'll be living a life with no purpose or meaning.

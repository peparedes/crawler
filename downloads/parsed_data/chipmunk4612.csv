The reading homework has been a little much, esp. when you can just skip it in high school and the techer will go over it in class. Other then school we've had a couple movie nights, gone out for pizza, and went to a goregous beach in maine. I kind of miss my family but not as much as I thought I would...I might be seeing them the 17th for my uncle's wedding party and if not then Tess may come up to see Dane Cook on the 15th of October.</FONT>&nbsp; <FONT size=4>Well that's it for now, I miss everyone and hope to talk to them soon!</FONT> </FONT></P>

THREE!! Thats crazy I won't get to see my boo for three weeks or hang out with tess ot pet gypsy.  Uhhh I know I'll have a good time but i will miss my family.  This is kinda overwhelming, especially packing, trying to make sure I dont forget anything, im thinking of things I still need to pack and can barely concentrate on this entry so its probably all over the place, Sorry! Well I have to get up early so I'm gonna go,  I'll probably write on friday when I'm at school! Hope everyone's having a good time at college!

Things are ok on the homefront...tess and I aren't fighting but my mom and I are...just because she's acting childish so w/e I really don't care at this point.  Tess and I are off to NYC tomorrow morning to visit grammy and who knows what she'll have us do...i know tess and i really only want to go for the shopping, haha. So that's about all for now....my love to all, esp. those leaving soon!

1. Reply with your name and I'll respond with something random about you.
2. I'll tell you what song/movie reminds me of you.
3. I'll pick a flavor of jello to wrestle with you in.
4. I'll say something that only makes sense to you and me.
5. I'll tell you my first memory of you.
6. I'll tell you what animal you remind me of.
7. I'll ask you something that I've always wondered about you.

"event","So almost time to leave for college...17 days wow thats really way too soon but im still excited! Anyways i haven't written in this thing in like four months so I decided to do it now because Im utterly bored.
Today was both a good and bad day...good in the fact that tess and i were civil to one another because weve been fighing a lot lately...actually we were pretty darn nice to each other plus i ended up iming one of my roomates, marissa and she was really nice.  Now for the bad news...today i pretty much realized that my relationship with most people (who are not my family) in fairport is basically over.  I guess its nobody's fault but it is sad i mean these people helped me through the beginning of the hardest part of my life so far and now it seems like weve grown too far apart to come back together.  They're all great people and i wish them all the best of luck in the future and wouldnt mind talking to any of them but now ive given up hope of a normal friendship where i can talk about anything to them and im sure they've already done the same to me. Wow that was pretty hard. I think that I've cried more in these past two weeks than I have since I moved.  Well thats all for now. ~Katie"

Only trying to decide what school I want to go to, tons of bio and eviro homework, volunteering like crazy to try and get my hours in, and looking forward to spring break.  No definite plans yet for the break, probably visit BU, and just relax. Miss all the fairport people...maybe ill get to see them sometime soon...or i really hope so.  Alright, as a fourth quarter senior I really dont want to do much more writing so im off to eat dinner, watch jeopardy and do some french hw."

"event","So I went to Boston for the first time ever yesterday, it was pretty fun...it was for french so we went to the museum of fine arts and saw some french art from the 13th-20th centuries and then we got to roam around saw some pretty neat stuff like little egyptian statuettes from like 3000 years ago and this really neat photography exhibit by Josef Sudek, its soo cool because it looks like some of his pictures are taken under water.  I'm gonna change my icon to one of them soon.  Anyways what I def disapproved of was the so-called modern art, a dead lamb in a glass box surrounded by formaldehyde solution is NOT ART...it's sad. So in a very un-Katie like fashion my partner and I were late for the bus and some stupid latin kids who are juniors are very immature and made stupid comments then and on the way to quincy market...screaming food every 2 seconds and making really stupid noises...i don't think i was the only one who wanted to render them unconscious. 

Anyways Quincy Market was fun..first Sean and I went to eat...I got sushi and nantucket nectars half and half...which is really good.  After eating we treked around in the snow to brookstone where we sat in the chairs even though im really not supposed to because you apparently have to be 18 anyways after that we went to the discovery channel store and saw these crazy baby toys and books which were really cheap.  After we went to this fallout shelter turned indoor cheesy shop central where basically every stand has a ring or magnet which is personalized for you. Anyways we got ice cream at the dugout after and i got moosetracks in a cone...not a good idea because I'm a kinda messy eater to begin with...i think i covered every white space on four napkins by the end of it.  

Alas it was then time to go home and we watched cellular, a major change from dodgeball lemme tell you...but it wasn't a bad movie.  Then I had to get gas and head home where alex and matt were hanging out with tess for a while.  When they left we had an interesting family conversation then cleaning.  Oh I got into UVM but im not going there unless they give me a full ride.  Well thats about it for my day yesterday...my weekend is now free due to another lack of interest in the volleyball tournament this weekend. Anyways it was a good way to spend a friday especially since it was a day one.  Alright im out ~Katie"

So this weekend wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be...we had to forfeit all of our games but we were still decent, but it tired me out soo much.  Anyways after 12 games on sat the fam and paigy babs and I had thai food which was pretty good then tess paigy and I went to the spot with MIKE haha it was great seeing him...hes always so informative and fun. After a few hours there he took us to the Roes and then he had to leave and it was sad : ( Sunday we only played four games then had some krispy kremes went to weggies b/c they have much better food then the places down here and then we left and got home at like 6, I couldn't fall asleep until 12 and hence my tiredness today.  Now I'm off to make ling lings and possibly study for my french vocab quiz...I should think of a sign off but just bye for now, Katie"

"event","So far vacation has been pretty good...although it is almost over...I made this belt which is pretty nice and beaded it myself. Since my dad has a job now I've been the chauffeur of the family but its ok because Im getting paid.  Tuesday Tess Mike Rob and I went to westfarms, Eric was supposed to go but then had to do a walk through for his bball game which they won. So we were at west farms for about five hours, one of which was standing in line waiting for a reservation at the rain forest cafe, another was waiting for tess to get her make up done at Sephora.  Surprisingly I went in with $60 and only bought this great smelling melon shampoo/conditioner/body wash which cost 16 dollars along with lunch and left with nothing. Anyways Wed. I cleaned my room and did laundry which was looong overdue, I found some really crazy stuff like all the stars that people wrote for me at the going away party and a black feather boa I do believe came from Jo; and it really got me missing all you Fairport people who I havent talked to in the longest time so I'm gonna try to find some way to catch up.  On wed, I also went out for food at the cuckoos nest with a bunch of craaaazy boys and Tess and then bowling with was very amusing.  Thursday Tess left for Vermont to see Uncle Steve so I watched Mike while he drove her up to the train at Springfield.  Mike and I went to the library and he got some disney movies and tree house books and I got Pride and Prejudice, the movie with Colin Firth (gorgeous) which is 300 minutes long and watched it alone because the only other person I know who would watch it with me is out of the country. Which brings me to now where I'm going to put up a crazy quiz from blaakman and then get dressed and go out to breakfast!

"event","So school has been a breeze this past week, i've barley had any homework which is wonderful. But what isnt wonderful is the fact that i have woken up or been awoken at 3:30 since saturday and although I like to stay up late and get up early I hate waking up in the middle of the night.  Anyways can't wait for vball again this weekend...we have practice sat and then a tourney sun, and maybe stay over sat to sunday in mass. which will be really fun because everyone on the team is so nice! So Valentines Day is coming up soon and I dont have a valentine :( but thats o.k. Oh and everyone should buy carnations from NHS cuz we need money! Well thats all for today...everyone hope for early dismissal tomorrow! -Katie"

"event","So its past midnight and I should be asleep but im not tired at all so Im hoping writing will make me sleepy...
Today was kinda scary but also very very very funny.  The first two blocks I had presentations to do and I hate making presentations but everything went pretty well...probably because I was in a group for both.  Prob and stats was uneventful but I did get most of my homework done in it.  And environmental...well it was probably the funniest class Ive had all year.  My lab partner, Elissa and I could not stop laughing for about 90 minutes because, this person who stares at us all the time but doesnt talk (which is very very weird) had chocolate on their mouth while giving us this through stare it was hi-larious.  Then at home I didnt do much until Tess and I decided to take mike to Blockbuster and then Starbucks, we rented Harold and Kumar go to white castle which is quite possibly the one funniest movies EVER. Well tomorrow I have to make food for or superbowl party which I dont really mind but its gonna take a long time...bean dip, broccoli and cheddar soup, cookies, and oreo cheesecake plus shopping for all of it. Sunday should be fun tho and the Eagles have to win because I hate the patriots!!!!!!! Just because they beat the Colts and they've already won twice in a row.  Well I dont have much else to write and im still not tired so here are some random quizzes...

"event","So I am officially a second semester senior, but oddly enough don't lack motivation yet as I did last year.  Haven't been accepted to any colleges as of yet, but boy do I have big plans as soon as I get in to my first, UConn in all probability just because I don't want to go there.  So as soon as I get in to UConn I am going to get a massage or something spa like just so I can celebrate the end of my high school career.  Oh and since this is my first entry I suppose i should explain my username...because only three other people in the world would get it (snow angels).  Anyways in seventh grade joanna, kel, kate and I had this club named the snow angels and we all had names... cuz thats what 7th grade girls do. So one day when I had braces i got these really small rubber bands which really hurt like a mother and made my mouth all puffy, hence the chipmunk. The forty six and a half was a little more interesting, we all loved fun scape and played mini golf whenever we were there so one time we were playing the lower course, you know with the subway type things and I shot a two on that hole but joanna thought I was lying, and being as stubborn as both of us were, and still are she decided to call it 2 and a half, though I do not agree with her to this day.
Anyways here's something I stole from jo...

so after all that stessing i did, i went and gave the stupid presentation today, and doc cozad gave me the informal grade of ""wonderful"". if i keep up with the reading from this point forward and she doesn't count absences too closely, i'll be fine in there.

i also finally got a meeting with my thesis advisor.  told her where everything stood, she looked through everything, and we realized my stuff was, quote, fantastic, and that i am maybe two hours work from being finished (not counting the color correct for printing, but that's a whole other animal).

"event","is ""senioritis"" a condition associated with a lack of motivation to complete assignments in classes that you don't need to pass in order to graduate, even when said assignments are already past due, and it is likely you will have to present them in less than ten hours?  I've only ever failed one class, and i was flunked by someone who admitted to having flunked me purely as a motivational tactic.  i'm just already hopelessly behind on the reading in this class, i've missed over my limit, it's not a class that i need, and i really don't want to give a ten minute presentation.  i shouldn't have signed up for it, but i needed something to round out my twelve hours or i couldn't actually fund this little operation.

apparently, if i calculate correctly...failing this class, and getting the minimum C in all my others would leave me with a 3.1 resident gpa.  i'm pretty okay with that, though i'm obviously going to try not to fail, and to get better than c's in those others.

at any rate, life moves on in its unstoppable galumph, and for me it goes well.  things are getting done, plans (however loose) are being made and at the end of the day there is warmth and laughter and love to greet me.

i work approx. three jobs, only two of which i get paid for working (the museum is ""paying me in experience""), for a total of between 25 and 40 hours a week, depending on how much i pick up for cobra.

besides a ""research and writing in art"" class, i take two intense studio courses, and have begun working on my thesis, which ties to some of my outside projects, notably including my work for amnesty international (posters, brochures, web site, so on so on so forth).

as per that last bit, i am organizing an art sale, which requires i get permissions, and support, and gather folk together for donating work/helping at the table etc.  (by the way, the sale will be thursday-friday oct. 26-27 in front of the union.  at least 10% of every sale goes to amnesty, and many pieces will be 50% or more...please buy something small and pretty)

i finally got all my crap together for my graduation app, and now i'm waiting for doc wicker to get done with it...i have no indication of how long this will take.

for some reason, on top of all this, i volunteered to do the posters for the show in gallery 130, which i just finished.  i emailed ginny (graphic design prof here) a proof, and her response was, ""it looks fantastic! if you are working in the lab tonight, go ahead and print about 30 posters and hang some around Old Chem.""

"event","pretty sure that's what alcohol poisoning is...
was thinking i might back off on the drinking for a while, but apart from last night, and thursday, i really haven't been drinking (beers with meals don't count).  i should back off on being an ass, but i'm not quite sure how to do that, really.  

now it's blanket apology time.  if you saw/talked to me past oh, eight o'clock last night, i probably did or said something horrid to you, and would like to say that i am sorry.  i am a complete jackass, or lunatic, whichever you prefer, sometimes.

for anyone keeping score, tho, i apparently neither drove nor vomited inside a business last night.  i aslo didn't get in a fight or go to jail, so apart from saying ridiculous/rude/horrible things to people and falling a lot, i guess i didn't do anything too bad."

"event","having a somewhat segmented and multi-track mind is usually a hassle, what with the clutter that goes on up there when you try to focus on something.  some days, however it is useful.  today for example, i have been to all my classes and am actually getting work done at my normal levels of speed and skill while the upper levels of my consciousness (like the one writing this entry) are completely preoccupied with something else.  we're calling this a good thing, because the only real detremental effect to the life outside my head is that i appear a bit insane, and that's not new to anyone.  taking some good advice, i appear to have well and truly stopped thinking."

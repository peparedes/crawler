"event","I am here to talk about my wonderful weekend.  It all started out at work, oh yea the good ol' Mcdonalds.  I worked from 8 to 4 and it was hell but it did go by fast so it was all good.  Then saturday came around because it was my 19th b-day.  Megan got out of work at 12 then she went home and did her chores(damn chores she could of gotten over here sooner for I could see her) oh well though i guess but she got over here and the party started with the family and all... I love my family thats all I got to say about that.  I got my b-day presents :-D thats always nice, heehehe i got a digital camera haha now i'm not alone anymore cause almost everyone has one.  Oh man I had soo much fun on my b-day.. I hung out with Megan the whole day... man I love being around her, she makes me feel good inside all the time... and its just amazing... she's amazing... I wish I was that amazing but I dunno.... I guess I would have to wait and see... Chad and Brian came over and us 4 went to a haunted maze with my sister n Mike(her bf) and her best friend Stephanie.. It was a blast cause we all got scared... Now that I think about it.. I did put Megan in the front for like a minute or so then I lost her.. but we all got out alive but damn, it was scary... I found Megan at the end and she wasn't breathing good but I was helping her to get her breathe back, it was scary and we all lost it... after that scary time we went to mcdonalds for some food n a shake and anything else we could think off.. it was great... I wanted to go to K-mart to get a video game but ofcourse it was close so we decided to go to Meijiers how ever its spelled cause I forgot haha... oh well... we got the video game and man its really addicting but I got to quit playing it... i'm not even joking..then we saw ron.. what a great friend lol not really but yea... he got close to Megan and I didn't realize it.. but ofcourse he won't do anything.. well he better not... So then we went to Amanda's house to get her and she was going to drive her over to my house... n we had like an hour left to hang out.. oh soo fun.. but I enjoy hanging out with Megan.. and I know she enjoys it too... sunday.. didn't do nothing went n see Megan at Mcdonalds but she wasn't there.. ofcourse not... but she did come up to work and hang out with me and eat.. so that was good.. then went to K-mart.. she got some index cards and then  we left.. we both got gas but at different places.. n then we talked on the phone.. and i've been playing video games... so now i'm going to go and look at somoe psychology that I have to get out of my car... Well happy B-day to me.. haha how lame...good night everyone"

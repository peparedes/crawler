"event","ok so..... last night i went to bed at like 7... my parents were arguing... again. its getting bad lately but this time i heard alot of the argument. i dont think they'll be together  much longer. and if they do stay together... its gonna be messy. so heres the deal. i dont think right now is a good time for me to move away. theres too much going through my head. and i dont think im ready to be in a commited relationship. i dont know how im going to tell dave this though. i feel really bed becasue he started paying my bills and shit. but im not ready to be all grown up. i need to go out and party and get into trouble. i have these rights. but also with everything going on at home i feel like im needed here. my brother is going to need me.. this i know for sure.  ill feel so bad if something happens and he's here alone.. so now all i have to do is tell dave"

"event","*PoOf* its over. not forever but just for now. At school, in massachusetts, back to calling him alllllll the time. Once reality set in that i had to go, i saw him cry for the very first time. it was our last night together. we were talking and i looked up and he was just trying to hold them back. but the day i left, i couldnt stop myself. i didnt want to leave. this week had to be the happiest i have ever been.  and on cue. once i let myself cry he couldnt hold them back. just like that my vacation and the good mood i had been in all week was gone. and at the point in the airport when we had to part. i swear to god i must have looked crazy but thats the last thing that was on my mind. as i walked alone toward the gate i told myself not to cry. i tried so hard not to. and as the plain lifted from the grown the knot in my throght was so tight but i never cried. i keep telling myself 6 weeks... thats all... 6 whole long weeks. i just can convince myself that it s not a long time. but without seeing him? i dont think i can do it. ive done it so many times before. it hurts. im depressed. trying not to cry once again. ive fallen even more in love with him. didnt even know it was posible.


ive realised  i love the little things. that almost seem sick. 
his forgetfullness. and the simple things he just doesnt get. 
the way he breaths at night
the way he roles over in the morrning to kiss me and tll me he loves me as he gets up for work and i just went back to sleep. lol
the way he calls me everytime he sells a car as if he needs my aproval. in his head i guess he thinks he does.
the way at night when we're watching tv and i can tell his head is just bobleing around becasue he has fallen asleep.
the way he watches me when i sit on the grownd and play with the cat.
the way he talks to me 
the way he looks at me 
the way he kisses me
the butterflys i get after not seening him for so long
the big hugs he gives me 
the way he trys so hard to suprise me and make me smile
the way he tickles me and then curls up in the fetal possision when i tickle him back
the way he play wih his nephew 
the way smiles and laughs when hes made an ass of himself.
this list could go on forever.

most of wich ill have to wait to see or feel untill he comes here.this sucks soooo bad.
but on the other hand his family loves me
his dad already refers to me as his daughter in-law.
his mom drives me inscane but she likes me too.
his nephew calls me his new best friend. austin's 9"

"event","Its only tuesday. I dont want it to end. once I leave I have to wait another 6 weeks to see him again. 
I dont know if I can wait that long. god I lobve him so much. Ive never felt so happy. Ive never felt so strongly about belonging anywhere. and let me tell you I belong here. hes the love of my life. with him I feel complete. I love him.
 
~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~
          The way he looks into my eyes.
       The way his body feels next to mine. 
        The way he wispers to me at night.
          His arms hold me late at night 
         His smile makes my days complete. 
            And though im so far away 
     When I finally see him its worth the wait.
      The vibes the beat of his heart sends me 
      His voice I live to hear say ""I love you""
            I know theres no other for me

~*~*~**~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*
i couldnt understand 
how someone so wonderful,
could look me in the eyes and tell me that they cared.
an unformilar feeling, settles within my soul
when he looked into my eyes. 
i realised i wasnt alone

but how can this person
change me with just a kiss
i wonder if its worth it 
scared, loves just a myth

how can i  truely explain it
im deathfully afriad
what ifs stream through my confused mind

what are these feelings im feeling
since when do i really care?

and now hes so far away
and although i feel alone
inside my heart i know hes there
just waiting for me to come home

ive finally let myself cry 
ive always known loves wasnt a lie

like no one ive ever met before
he makes me smile and want to feel
whats its like 
to be held
what its like to understand why

questions i was scared to ask 
emotion i was afraid to show
not afraid to smile 
no more what ifs 

now i feel whole.
never alone
hes what holds me together
he keeps me walking forward
makes me want to dream
like a dream come true 
a new begining is shining through
*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*

His name is David Edward Scott. in 9 days ill be going to ohio for a week. i cant wait i havnt seen david in like 5 weeks. thats way too long for my likings.  and after that week ill have till wait till the 2nd of june to see him again. i just dont know whats going on with me. ive willingly chosen to be with this man for the rest of my life.
     4th of july weekend will also be my last weekend living in massachusetts. ive decided to move to ohio with dave. its gonna be a huge step for me. not only moving away from home but moving somewhere so far away.(its so fuckin hot in here) im going to be shairing a bedroom and there will no more be anything thats mine but everything thats ours. and believe it or not im not scared.

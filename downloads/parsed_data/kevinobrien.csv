Oh yeah, The tree's growin'high,
And iff you can't handle it,
Itt willl, Eat you alive.

Clutch kickin' switchin' gears hittin' that piff,
Blowin' past fears life's a copilot,
Watchin' the streets get more violent,
sunshinin' baskin' in ultraviolet,
Lost on the fray,
Biting my tongue, fillin' my lungs
Picture this cognitive highway,
Petal to the metal,soaring through the subconscious,
Days if immediate relief vs. long term pain,

navigating past relapse, opening up new lane
satellite eyes scanning brainwaves, Rapidly making movement,
Livin' in a manic state, Pitter patter of data cleared for landing,
saving care with planning, Pen tap tapping safety sakin' 
Loose repenting lips quiver, Recycle bin, Clock hand ticks ripen, 
Too Late, Whose late, Whose fate,
Wait.
Cruise, Let loose,
listen to life it's gotta tune, Your mind's layin' a beat you gotta choose,
It' now or never,
so you better be a go-getter, Fuck the trendsetters,
Betcha Bottom dollar, ya dream's aren't farfetched, scheming a fresh catch, 
Paranoia, Propaganda, Paraphernalia,
Letcha self pass the test, Don't be scared to make a mess, 
It's best, It' the best for easy access,
Underground tunnels obscured by societies cities, ya with me?
Beautiful Destruction, life goes on surviving buildin' blocks of time,
Infiltrate, Freethinkers rise,
Abide by your alibi's, Vomitose, Anecdote, Overdose,
Few choose to live, Most choose to die,
Tuck in ya bedsheets, sinkin' into sleep with blind eyes,
Wake the fuck up, suckah!
Ya undercover, Life composed of historical white lies,
You gotta plant a seed, that'll spread like a weeds,
Invasive species step forward, take the lead,
Jack be nimble, Jack be quick, 
We all have fires that itch to be lit,
We're behind enemy lines,Doin' time for our blind side,
Open up your eye to fundamental thoughts, now whose lackin' a backbone,
We're all national's who fought our on war's freein' ourselves watch us soar,

Big Brother's Reading us tales from their storybooks,
Who wrote these ill-conceived concepts, We're lettin'ourselves get into debt,
We're the government's pets awarded illusion treats tricked into thinkin' we're off our leash, 

We all have personal quest's, so let's become veteran's,
so let' begin this epiphany,
Who's with me?

As always we're still swimming in a sea of individuality, unpredictability, and chance.
Getcha self up, Let's dance!
Have the last laugh, Lets dance!
Don't say ya can't, Let' Dance!
Leave the ghost's in the past!
It's ya last chance!

Mhmm, The cloud's rollin' by,
Oh yeahh, The tree's growin' high,
and ifff, you can't handle it,
It willl, Eat you alive.

so whatcha gonna do, Who we gonna save?
Whatcha gonna do, Who we gonna save?
Whatcha gonna do, Who we gonna save?

Don't get washed out and dragged down by the waves.

You wake up in the morning and realize your cornered in a whole world you've never seen before; You get your pants on and your foot out the door. left your suit at home with your girl in all her allure. A TV's on and you can see the window transparent, but it's still there. Finding yourself compelled to stare. Don't say you don't. We're passing by a street selling pairs of pears. You blink twice, now in a garden of fruits, four floors with nothing to lose. It's game night, but at least you have padding. A cyclops emitting light, a nurse who picked a fight ""Come on sir take your pills!"" everything turns to suede a hunger sets in as do the walls, suddenly your bed is made. Black&White with shades between. Older wiser, but weak in the knees. Not a wish, but a sentence. Not yours, but another name was signed. As sense grows the sun shines longer everyday. Finally permitted not to stay, here's your papers be on your way. Where to run to where to stay. What good are papers anyway. The end has came a gunshot wound in which you lay, couldn't there be some other way?

Person 2:

Turn the corner another life in the city it's escaped and gone to a better place some scream "" go and get help!"" then there's those who pick up their pace must have been static. Solid shot oh how the blood flowed. Old man freshly shaved dressed the part why did he think he had to go. Got up at seven. This was a new day. This was a new life. Unfolded his finest iron collared shirt with cuff links. It was was his only vice. His jacket and hat waited for him on his way out. The door led to what the past thirty years happened to do for him. The sky seemed smaller no one seemed to have a care. The side walk spawned it's own caught in the crossfire. Shouting of scrambled screeching car tires. The new generation turned out this way. He laid on their sidewalk looking at the sky being told it'd be okay. He paid close attention to eyes and the pitter patter of talk til they came and took him away as they zipped the bag up the sky went away,

Was this fate's way?"

"event","I'm at the Doctor's. It is ten AM. I am right on time for somethingg for the first tiime in like months. The nurse asks me about life, oh blah blah blah shooting the shit to pass the time talk. As she take's my pulse she stops talking. I can't hear it? I laugh. She asks does that happen a lot. I laugh again and tell her how my friend has tachycardia and is always checking his heart,So I let him feel my chest, neck & wrist to tell him it's better to have a fast pulse then no pulse at all & it always freaks him out & he say's ""you're dead!"" 

so the doctor comes in,
He see's that I'm taking Trazodone & Ativan for Insomnia, I tell him I do Construction & Landscaping. The more I work the more awake throughout the day. That is doesn't exhaust me, only if I work less do I find myself tired. It's like my adrenaline keeps me moving. When I try to sleep I lay there for an hour or so, to wake up around 3 or four to wait another hour to sleep for another couple hours. I twitch if I keep still. Ask my girlfriend, always movingg. Always thinking too. He looked at me like I was inhuman with his head cocked to the side. He said you appear strong & healthy. I tell him I feel healthy. ohh, what is it to be young he justifies as he awkwardly leaves the room.

There's a wonderful start to my day, I always feel like an Alien at every single appointment ever! Neurologist's couldn't figure it out, Speech Specialists said I'm wired realll fucked up & tried to reprogram my brain, Shrink's wanted to drug me, Therapist's too. The hearing people at least could tell me I had 115% hearing where most people are below 100%, how I have a form of Auditory Processing Disorder which sparks like mad cinematic scenes in my head, but what can you do for that. I could of told them that. I don't wanna change. I just wanna be able to function, drive right, work right, to be accepted not brought down to your medical standards. On another hand if you're not with me throughout the day you wouldn't understand what I'm getting at you must observe my true nature's, So how do they make a living on assumptions? 

I see how society has become it's pandemic cancer swine flu crazed plague, it's not the T-Virus, it's the AMA. Don't let me rant, Don't let the rhymes, no not yet. END IT."

"event","Today I laid in bed all day with Brittany literally except for a few minutes when we went to Market Basket and bought stuff so we could make Shells and Cheez wiz. I guess I forgot to pump my tire up when before I left so when we came back he was on the prowl for me. He couldn't understand how I forgot when he told me twice today. lol. So I fill it up and loosened my valve  stem which pissed him off. He also said I used the wrong piece to attach to the compressor. He said he always used the same one for yearrss but it was brand new like a year old. The one I always used was a longer on with no latch, so I know I'm not the one wrong. I calmly dismiss him telling him to calm down. It's not like he never forgets shit. I come in and make Brittany and me  food and when I drained the shells I dripped water all on the floor just a little droplet path. My dad walked in and told me to think of what I was doing and to lay off the drugs cause I got a little pasta water on the floor. I told him to shush cause he was mad at the truck or something and now he was yelling about water on the floor. He is ridiculous and every day he gets more and more senile I swear! He then went on to yell about how I thought the cap on your car tires was to prevent air from leaking out where they are really just to keep dirt from going into your tire, like I knew anything about that. I asked what did you do just fall out of the womb knowing everything he replied I taught myself everything. I said I didn't take that path sorry and peaced. He stormed off probably to either a Chinese restaurant or Escapades, I can make bets probably on it. 

Happy Fatherrrss Dayyy. I am having a blast Brittany and me are having a blast hanging outt. We're looking to go camping in like New Hampshire or something. I always leave KGO<3BMR places. I did it so perfect in the tree at our campsite in Carver. It was brilliant. Too bad niether of us can drink this summer."

"event","I got B sick. I got sick first started with an itchy throat and runny nose turning to a chillfest feverish game of taking the blanket on and off. I was delusional on Saturday and Sunday. I saw a liquid centipede the size of my fist in a doorway it was clear, but all it's features were all there as I walked through the door it splashed and disappeared. I swearr. Then at B's friend's grad party the tree's were colored like Italian flags and the hue's were glaring at me. I thought a dude carrying a case of bottled water was videotaping everyone with the huge studio size camera's ya know what kind I meann? There was a handicapped girl walking up to people at the party and putting her hands on their back. She touched my back when I was staring at some lasagna and It felt like a ghost had passed into my back a little, as if I wasn't really having contact with flesh; though I could tell I was being touched and I knew it was her. It was another confirmation in life that we are more then bodies, but traveling minds. I had been waiting for her to touch me at some point. When I turned to look her in the eyes there was a clash of spiritual energy. It was like our mind's made peace in the air. I accept everyone, but I felt her energy had questions for my being like she could feel my mind and understand that I perceive things differently then the next and she looked at me like she was thinking the same things about me as I was to her."

After being told Taunton was a stones throw away, Middleboro was right up the street, as well as Bridgewater and that he was in Raynham. The man in the SUV bluntly asked the boy &quot; <i>Where can I find a hooker. Where can I find a good blowjob</i>?&quot; ...&quot;well the taunton greens right up there&quot; The boy pointed the way to the obvious response.&nbsp;I would of told him the Comfort Station, a rectangular building off the green.

At times the mere sight of his ghastly white body will scream carnivorous petunia. His verbal excretions will rot your brain like Dooms Day for dinner. His mockery of elegant scents brings the birth of compressed death. His mouth on the other hand is full of stillborn weddings. Where his facial hairs border on civilized animosity, His black slick hair is an unstoppable, but ordered fashionably unpredictable epidemic for the masses. He has a manifestation rather then a laugh that doesn&rsquo;t let you forget what his mom says &ldquo;He haunts houses&quot;.<br /><br />Can any of you guess who this friend is?</span></p>"

Unexpected white folks, who can't take jokes,
get all upset and fret, then sweat,
at any sign of betrayel, anything he says will,
guide them to the light, sure to find him in their sight,
blinding illusions, causing contusions, and losing,
wars fought,the non-believers get caught, 
Professional deceivers, the public's recievers,
confessionals needed, They will tell you your thoughts,
Well should you or not, Hell, I hear gets hot,
You'll burn, and learn, better yet yearn, 
for another life, lungs smothered with knives,
from all the bothered souls, who grew cold,
all because they fold under pressure, gunshots an unfriendly gesture,
They get to hold it all in, for a whole life of sin, 
But that's if its real, don't let me begin,
Anecdote, overdose, vomitose,
everyone is born, few choose to die,
Tuck in your bedsheets,
between me and you is lies.

It may entice me, but it might be the light see,
meaning the beginning to my downfall, deeming threats & phone calls,
My GPA is a 1.3, lets just say schools to traditional,
There is a way, some day, My dreams are not fictional,
College next fall, high school withdrawels soon shall follow
however I'll have the summer months to deal with these cunts,
He used to be so sincere about drinkin beer, Now hes not one to care about being fair,
Arguments & taunting, patience dents, money hes always flaunting,
I'm hellbent & tempted, he's so unkempt & believes he's exempt,
& I'm a broke nigga.
How am I to start a life, Go figure?
at least I have a vice, that doesn't pull my trigger,
I'll lend a friend my life in the end,
to leave behind all kinds of fine lines & rhymes,
Give it up to a M.I., Just sigh & stop the lies,
push through the doors, to white floors & more,
rehabs just a lab with medicine it can't be bad it's the government,
I'm feeling fabulous, I guess so call a cab unless,
You can give me a ride, so I can find what I've got to hide,
repression causes depression, We realized in this session,
guess I'll have to retrogress & confess to myself, it'd be for the best,
Don't self doubt, I'm going all out, No need to shout, What's the fuss all about,
We talk in quiet voices and think of our choices,
We walk in halls, talk to walls, and get silenced when order calls.</lj-cut>"

Shes dead, in your head,
you replay the life she led,
Memories is all you see as you close your eyes
memorized lullabies pass the time
as your mourn

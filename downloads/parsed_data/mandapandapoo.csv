not much is new school is school nothing changes with that. 

friday i skipped school to hang out with my sis. i wound up going to the galleria so that she could buy the louis vuitton she wanted. its big. she asked ""gosh what am i ganna put in this"" i said ""your other louis"". she thought that was funny... who our age has two louis'? shes a crazy girl. im more into coach myself. which is only a teeny bit less. but that was fun its a nice purse of course. then we bought my mom a mothers day present. then we got my sis a dress for today. then i got a smoothie cause i love thirsty's smoothies. and my sis got her fake nails fixed or something. then we left and went to her house to a bit. then we went out with her boyfriend jason to studio movie grill. its an awesome place were u watch a movie while ur eating awesome food i love it. we watched kingdom of heaven which i most definatly loved. its a war/history movie im such a dork. so then we went back to ambers and i stayed the night

we woke up this morning and it was ambers graduation for college. but shes doing her graduate degree next year so shes still got a year left. that took a while but it was ok. then we all went to maggianos and ate a lot of foooood. too much food. then we went back her and sat outside all day and talked it was actually fun. and we didnt have dinner cause lunch was so huge. my sis wore her pretty dress and her new blingin swarovski necklace and bracelet and her new louis. she looked awesome. 

so this has been a good weekend so far. tomorrow we are goin to brunch at lacima in las colinas for mothers day im excited. i love brunch u can eat so much its crazy. alright well im out"

"event","this week has been ok i guess. nothing special. i didnt do nething tonite lol. well i mean i didnt go out. i thought i mightve hung out with nick and people but no that ddnt happen. so i called nikki and she was ganna come over and that also never happened... which is cool. i looked thru get well cards that i had from the hospital. u know i got so many cards from family and friends of family its crazy, a lot of people  i didnt even know. but i didnt get one card from a friend. only 2 people came to visit me that were my friends. the rest were family and whatnot. i was happy that so many people cared about me even tho friends didnt show it. i got atleast like 75 cards.  got a card from my guidance councler which i just realized and i thought was sweet, then i got one from the whole fmhs counseling office, i got a card from my church and i got flowers from my church and from my dads work. just like random people its crazy. i had a cute drawing from my young cousins. it took me like an hour to go thru. they were all ina bag witha  balloon i was sent and a medical booklet on ecmo (the machine i was on) to inform people. i have no clue what it really is, there was a picture of me on it they took to show people to get used to before they saw me in person (i guess like there was blood running threw it and i just looked so sick) and i wish we still had that but my mom said she ripped it up cause she didnt want it to be my last picture (just in case things didnt work out). im kinda getting off the subject. lol pretty much i looked thru some hospital memorabilia and it reminded me of those days. thats about all i did tonight cept i slept a lil too. tomorrow im staying home while my parents go to the lake. nick said hed go see the ballad of jack and rose with me in plano (thats the closest place its playing), but i have a feelin that will work out just as well as tonight did lol. o well i have other stuff to do too so itll stll be worth it. thas about it"

today was so fun we left our house at 645 to go to the lakehouse (i slept on the way up). we got here at about nine and my parents went to get our jet ski unwinterized or something like that. then they got lunch/breakfast from pantera bread which was cool i never ate there they got me this awesome peanut butter and jelly and this awesome cinammon bagel bites stuff. i love food. so i had the bagel bites for breakfast then me and my mom watched casablanca while my dad picked up the jet ski. then he got home and we went out on the boat. it was lots of fun we stayed out for three to four hours im not sure. it was sorta windy at some points but when it wasnt it was great. im a lil bit sunburnt which is sorta a nice change from being white lol... well ya know it feels less like winter which i like. and i ate the amazing peanut butter and jelly out on the boat and then we eventually came back finished casablanca and then i ate a hamburger outside while we looked at the lake and my parents had margaritas. it was such a typical summer day i loved it... too bad its winter???? lol... i liked it.. ugh and tomorrow i come back and life goes back to normal. which is ok. and then monday i have school which im not looking forward to. even tho i get to wear my purse... YAY. rite now my parents are out to eat. and i am watching tv and just chillin. my face is like burning hot cause its a lil red. its not that bad i dont think. we'll see tho i havent really looked in the mirror. i hope spring break is nice i wanna go out on the boat some more. we arent goin ne where special we will prolly go up to the lake a lil. we were thinkin bout a cruise but silly school decided to put easter and spring break together and we have to be here for easter ccause my sis has a different spring break. well thats about it"

thats it except its in green. it made me happy and then i got shoes to match it. then after all that i went home and went to lances. we watched frailty somewhat. its a good movie. good times.

well thats about it for yesterday. the rest of the week was eh. o cept thursday was my moms birthday and we went to cafe italia (well now its called italian bistro). the dude gave us free desert cause my parents go there a lot. and ya that was fun i baked her a cake which was not as good as i wanted it to be but it was still pretty good i guess.

"event","so this week was somewhat cool but then parts of it sucked

tuesday i had to do these notecards for english that took about an hour or more. 

wednesday i went to lances house and we watched 21 grams. its a really awesome movie. i had fun hes a fun guy.

thursday i worked my butt off so that i could do the stupid rough draft that we had 2 days to do. i didnt work on it the first day cause i thought itd be quick but it most definatly wasnt. i had to cancelmy guitar lessons cause i knew itd take forever and i didnt really feel good. so i started at about 5:30 after i ate dinner and stuff... then, with the tv off almost the whole nite, i finished at about 11:15. it was the longest paper ive ever had to do in the shortest amount of time. it was crazy but its over with and it doesnt really matter all that much. 

friday i went to the movies with lance joe and nick. it was a lot of fun. we saw hitch... but funny story behind that. we bought tickets and were in the movie already for constantine, and a cop comes in and is all like im ganna need to see ur tickets and ids please, theres been a complaint that there are some under aged kids in here. and first of all 3 of us were of age, second we werent really doing nething wrong. like we werent being loud or nething. so basically lance didnt have an id which is ok so we went an saw hitch. but hitch was a really good movie i laughed a lot. 

and thats about my weekend so far cause its still like 10:30 in the morning on saturday."

"event","so i had a fun weekend.

friday me kelli and lance went to chickfila... lance is a cool guy even tho he didnt have fun.
then me and kelli met chris up at the mall. and then me and kelli went to my place and had a sleep over and watched the notebook. lol but i guess we were both really tired cause we fell asleep like at 11 lol. 

my mom made waffles for us in the morning then kelli had to go cause her parents wanted to look for cars with her. but surprise they already got her a car and its a black mustang which is awesome for her and im so happy for her.
then later that day me and my mom went to stonebriar and i tried on a lot of clothes but nothing really fit except i got this really cute jacket from rampage. a lot of the stuff that did fit was dry clean only which is stupid. but the jacket is cute so its all worth it. 

and then today i stayed home. i had homework and stuff so i did that. it was really nice out so i didnt get as much as  i wanted done cause i have a research project ugh. and now im watchin desperate housewives and thats about it

YIKES. this means i cant watch the movie... look at the movie book... im ganna take off all the backgrounds and stuff on my computer which is the reason for my lack of an icon. i cant speak the words daniel day-lewis or gangs of new york. it could actually be pretty tough. its ganna be hard. if u know me at all u know itll be hard. it also means i cant look it up on the internet on ebay or look it up on random websites. the only thing ill have is my poster hanging up... which i cant take down cause its too expensive to give up. ill just try to ignore it a lil bit. well im ganna go i just thought id let you all know whats goin on"

"event","ugh...

things dont always go ur way i guess. so i guess the eagles didnt win. 24 to 21. that is so stupid. so close. we were so close!!!!! i cant beleive it. ill prolly be upset all tonite... maybe some of tomorrow too. and then ill just be spiteful for a while. but it was a good game. we really did good in the begining and it looked like the patriots didnt have a chance... but then i dunno what happened. its an unfortunate thing. but im glad we got this far. and after this stupid speech from the patriots on their stupid cheap win... the simpsons comes on which looks like itll be funny. the simpsons have the ability to chear me up. i definatly ate a lot while i was watching the game. my throat really hurts from screaming at the tv the whole time and i think i might loose my voice. but u know what..? its worth it. we had some awesome plays. i got pretty excited and maybe even jumped out of my chair a few times... which is pretty impressive... i cant say that i do that for any other show. and i watch a lot of tv. the eagles deserved it. thats all i have to say. and for all of my friends that have rooted against me just cause i love the eagles... u got ur wish. but i dont really care what people think. the eagles deserved it and thats what matters.

so on another note... its been a good week i guess. i forget what day but we got our schedules this week for next year. im plannin on doin senior out both semesters. i dont have much i need done and i definatly dont want to graduate early. i dont wanna miss out of my last semester of high school... thats when all the important things happen!!!

i got my hair cut. hopefully u cant tell. i got it cut as lil as possible just cause i had to cause its been a while... but i didnt want it any shorter cause i am still growin it out. 

my sis came over from wednesday to saturday. that was pretty cool. and she had her doggy jaike. on friday i took off school and me and my sis hung out all day. i had fun. i like it when she comes over.

well thats about it. i wrote a lot today.

we had christmas today because we go up to pennsylvania for christmas and it doesnt make sense to bring all of the presents up there. 

i got the best presents ever!! i wont tell u all of em cause thats just silly. but the #1 present is so cool. Im sure u know my favorite movie is gangs of new york. well they got me a gangs of new york movie poster that is AUTOGRAPHED by the main charectars: daniel day-lewis, leonardo dicaprio, and cameron diaz AND by the director martin scorcese that also directed the goodfellas. 

best christmas present EVER!

"event","ok well i decided im ganna restart doing this thing cause i can. 
WeLl neWAYS! its been pretty good lately. let me just tell u whats been goin on lately. ok i like 2 guys. lets name them guy #1 and guy #2. 
guy #1 is really awesome and funny and ive known him for a while. we hung out recently which is cool. and we said lets hang out again which was better. but he never talks to me in between the two. when we see each other in school he just says hi and walk off and then on the internet we dont talk at all either. i try to and he just kinda does nothing. and that gets me kinda annoyed. but its whatever. but hes really  cool so i dunno
k no 4 guy #2. he is really awesome however i just met him. i know nothing about him practically cept that hes hott and nice so far. but he doesnt go to our school which is the only downside, but its not a huge down side. BUT this dude actually talks to me. hes nice and we text each other all the time during school. which i like. i like talking to someone i like.
so what do u think about this? the one i know that doesnt talk to me but we do hang out and have fun, or the one who i barely know but is pretty cool so far?
comment por favor <3"

HOW HOTT IS THAT???? whoo hoo! i definatly have not gone out and dont plan on it till it comes off. i came there wearing my tight cute shirt thinkin itd be small enough but then it was all bulging and i had to change my shirt. so now i just look like crap. but it comes off tomorrow morning. i also have another appointment tomorrow morning what a surprise. this is just an action packed week!! lol. ya so this thing records everything that goes on with my heart the whole time. so i have to write down every time that i feel somethin goin on with my heart. soo fun. its definatly the most exciting thing anyone will ever do! well i guess i am done for now. wish me luck tomorrow. lets all hope i dont have a defective heart. lol i dont think i do. this is really all just for fun. buhbye"

"event","every friday during the summer my mom gets the day off its just the way they do it but she just works a half hour more in the morning and afternoon on the other days. so since today is friday me and my mom spent the day together. first off this guy was sposed to come from 9 to 11 to spray for ants. but he decided to call at like 11:15 to say that he will be there in 30 minutes cause he got held up with arodent problem. ud think that maybe he woulda thought to call a lil earlier than that. i duno that just seems irrisponsible. cause we were ganna go out earlier but then we had to wait for him so that was no fun. but as soon as he left we left and went to costco. just to look around. it can be real cheap there. they had digital camcorders for as low as $230 which seems good to me. i got some of those aveno face cleanser pads, theyre nice. it was a pack of two for 8 bucks which is spectacular i think. and then my mom got a ""food saver"" which vacuum seals stuff so it stays fresher longer. i always thought they were stupid but i guess it seems like a good idea. and plus they r fun we got to play around with it for a while which was entertaining. but it was like $140 i think. that seems like a lot to me. but o well. it was fun and we vacuumed up a lot of stuff once we got home. we left earlier than expected cause i started to get nauseus and stuff and it was no fun but i sucked it up till we were satisfied. then we went home vacuumed stuff. watched ellen. then of course we hit the pool. pool temp said 92. crazy isnt it? we chilled in these new rafts we got. they are so awesome i love them. we prolly went in at 3:30, got out at 5. which is pretty long for me. it was so nice out. but then when the sun goes in i get chilly. it only happened a few times so i really shouldnt complain. then we went in and i got a the mail. and a package from the allergist came. i am goin there on tuesday to see maybe if somethin is wrong with me cause of allergies and not completely cause my lungs just suck. and one of the questions on the form was name any hospitalizations/ surgeries. and we were kinda stumped with what word could sum all that. but we just decided to through down ards. which stands for acute respiratory distress syndrom. and i guess that works. and then later on in the night we ate chicken and thats really about it. hmmm tomorrow i work and i still need to shower tonight unless i go real quick tomorow morning. like super ultra quick. hmmmm i better go ttyl buhbye"

"event","welll i got eaten by mosquitos definatly. not horribly but it kinda sucks. i think i have about 10 mosquitos from today, and like two from other days. and 1 ant bite. which is only the third i ever got. today i had my first full day of work. and i didnt have tammy with me. it was fun. i think i did pretty spiffy. of course i could be wrong but i think theyre pretty happy with me. i did lots of stuff but towards the end i did everything and had nothin to do so i left early. but it was good cause the parents got home right after me like rite behind each other and they had jaikerz! i dunno if i wrote this so ill just do it just in case. we had to put jaike in the kennel cause he was growling at my cousins cause they were screamin and stuff. and i felt so bad cause it wasnt his fault. so my parents picked him up while i was at work. and he was back to normal, no growling, which goes to show it was the kids fault and not his. hes so cute hes here with me now. amber will take him back tomorrow cause she got back tonight but has a dentist apt. tomorrow here so just waited for today. they also went to costco today cause we were talkin bout it for some reason and then my daddys company happened to make a benefit where the employees get reimbursed for membership to costco and sams club so they just went there for fun. then we went in the pool and went swimming for an hour.  yesterday we went on the boat at the lake. by the way it was fourth of july. we had a lot of fun. we used the non new tube cause we thought we wouldnt go on the tube for some reason and then like 5 minutes in we were all like ok we need the tube so we did that and it was lots of fun. but now i am real tan on the front of my legs and on my face cause of how i was in the tube and it looks kinda silly but its really not that noticeable. and we bought 3 previewed movies for 25 dollars at blockbuster. we got somethings gotta give, dickie roberts, and texas chainsaw massacre (the new one). i hadnt seen ne of them. we watched dickie roberts last night after we got back from dinner. it was a lot better than i thought itd be. and then we went home and it was the fourth of july so we got to see so many many fireworks cause for about an hour there was so many goin on all around us and it was really awesome. it was a pretty cool deal cause we didnt have to wait in traffic and we got to see a lot of them. so now im just chillin here with jaike. i took him on a walk with my dad tonight and thats mostly why i have so many bites, also from after i got outta the pool. and my dad was holdin the leash and jaike rapped around me and my dad didnt catch it in time and i tried to hold it back but it didnt work so i have rope burn right at the back of my knee is, on the lil crease, and o man it hurt so bad i yelled at jaike. it doesnt hurt really ne more. alright well i work tomorrow only from 3-5 . o ya the cousins left yesterday. i miss em. but then i m glad too cause they were a lot to handle. so many young kids are tough cookies. lol aight well im out buhbye"

"event","In today's church, we see people who are saved, who are happy, who are living what they believe the life is for them.  But something's up...

We (myself and generations past) have lived and taught that God loves us, God forvgives us, but if we don't accept him as our savior, we'll go to hell and die a horrible death.  This IS true.  However, it's not the only reason we should accept Christ as our Lord and Savior.  GOd promises us life more abundant, He promises us TRUE life.  He promises us care and protection.  He promises us Love and acceptance.  GOd promises us Himself.  He is willing to have a relationship with us, to give us all we could ever ask for, and then more. God once had a great relationship with man and woman.  He talked with them every day, and even walked with them.  But one day, Adam was told not to eat the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil.  Adam and Eve were decieved into eating the fruit, and sin entered the world.  Sin cut us off from God.  Since God couldn't stand to be apart from us, He made a way that he could be with us.  He gave up His only son to die for our sins and the sins of everyone after us.  God gave up part of Himself so that He could be with us again.

The relationship is yours for the asking.  God will listen to you and answer your prayer.  God loves you and will be with you.  All you have to do is ask.  I'm not saying that being in a relationship with God will mean that you won't ever have pain, or that you'll have lots of money or power or anything of the sort.  I'm saying that God will provide your needs, and He will take care of you the way a Father does.  God is there.  Ask him to come into your heart and save you from yourself."

You can set the air/heat to what you want, and it stays there.  It's perfect for me.  Thank you Jesus!

I'll probably be moving in there April 7th.  If any of you can help me move, it would be greatly appreciated.  If not, that's okay too.  Thanks for your prayers and support.  If it weren't for the support I get from my friends, I wouldn't be as sane as I am today, mainly because when something doesn't work out in my plan, I get severely depressed about it.  Thank the Lord that He brings me out of it just as fast as I went in.  

Everybody pray that God would show me His plans, and that I would listen and follow.  I know I'm not destined to work at Wal-Mart forever.  My heart is in Pinson Valley High School.  I want so much to be there and help those people.

"event","I had a dream one day, and it stuck with me.  I thought I'd share it.

I was to play a very, very important part in a wedding.  It was quite necessary that I be at the wedding to perform my duties.  However, when the day of the wedding came, I arrived late, and when I got to the wedding, I had been replaced.  My heart was broken.  I had been looking forward to playing this special role in the wedding, and I'd been replaced.

All I can figure that it means is this:  the time is near for Jesus to come get his bride.

We, as the church, are Jesus' bride.  When the time comes, will you be ready to marry your bridegroom?  Or will you be replaced?  Don't miss out on this opportunity.  If you ignore the invitations, one day you'll wish you hadn't."

"event","<b>From the moment you're born until the moment you die, there will always be people in your life who are older than you.</b>

When I say 'older people' , I don't necessarily mean the people your grandparents' ages.  I'm talking about anybody from one minute to 100+ years older than you.  You have a choice when it comes to these people.  You can either learn from them and allow them to play a teaching role in your life, or you can reject the lessons their lives contain for you.  Most people who are older than you are willing, and some eager, to teach you things about your life.  It's one of life's greatest privliges.  We all want to pass on things we've learned from our lives on to other people.  I encourage you to learn from the older people around you and allow them to teach you things that you didn't know, and sometimes put a new light on things you knew, or thought you knew. 

<b>From the moment you're born until the moment you die, there will always be people in your life who are younger than you.</b>

You have a choice when it comes to these people also.  You have a role to play in the younger people's lives around you.  Your job is to teach them things the best you can.  If you reflect on your own life, you'll realize that you learned things from your parents, grandparents, aunts and uncles, and anybody else around you who was older than you.  The important thing to realize about this role is that the younger people around you are going to learn from you whether or not you choose to teach them.  They watch what you do, how you handle situations, and how you handle yourself.  If you manage to control your temper in situations where you'd like to dog-cuss someone, for example,  the younger people around you will see that they'll obtain a better result when maintaining their temper.  If you choose to dog-cuss the person in the same situation, the younger people around you will see that they should get angry when something similar happens to them.  Remember, the younger people around you watch how you behave.  How will you teach them?  Will you teach them the good way, or the bad way?

<b>From the moment you're born until the moment you die, you have a choice to make about yourself.</b>

You may choose to see the value that you have, or you may choose not to see the value that you have.  Hating yourself will be evidenced by destructive behavior.  For example,  you may think that for your boyfriend/girlfriend to love you, you have to sleep with them.  In reality, this isn't the case.  If a guy/girl can't love you because you're you, walk away now.  If you don't, you'll wind up trapped in the same cycle over and over, and have a high probability of getting an STD, pregnant, or sterile, not to mention the emotional effects.  

On the other hand, if you choose to value yourself, others will do the same.  It's also important to know where your value comes from.  You're not valuable because you're the best piano player in the world, or because you can dribble a basketball a million yards.  You're valuable because God says so.  He's the final authority on the matter.  You have value because God said so.  He thought that you were valuable enough to send his own son to die for your sake.  No matter what other people say around you,  remember that God says you're valuable, and He doesn't lie.  

Will you allow yourself to be taught?  Will you choose to teach others the good things?  Will you choose to see the true value that you have because God says you do, or will you ignore it?"

She wouldn't sit in the radio booth with the psychic the so-called 'new age' dad had on his radio show.  If anybody saw it, help me describe this woman; I can't find the words at the moment.  Seeing this woman made me realize that lost people don't want to hang around those kind of people.

"event","I'm known for my funny anecdotes about life and living it, or so I think.  But I do have serious advice.  None of the things listed are commands, but rather suggestions that have proven useful to me.

1.  Be picky about who your friends are. - You'll come to find out as you grow up that who you surround yourself with is who you'll become like.  We each have something to offer another person, and as we get to know each other, little pieces of ourselves are molded into our friends.  We get along with our friends because we give what we can for them, and they for us.  We have an understanding with our friends of what's to be said and what's not to be said, and this understanding is followed.  The people we surround ourselves with will either help make us or help break us.  We're not meant to live life by ourselves and to depend only on ourselves.  

2. Sometimes you have to grow up sooner than you should. - Living life brings us trials.  The way we respond to these trials make us who we are.  Things in your life may not go as planned, and you should be able to adjust to them.  If things in your life go exactly the way you plan them, something's wrong.

3. Enjoy what you've got. - This goes for time, as well as things.  We're only given a certain amount of time.  Death is a certainty that comes with life.  Make the most of every moment, and take time to breathe.  Don't fill your life up with every little thing that you can get.

4.  Life's about more than things.  - Some of the best times I've had in my life are when I didn't have a dime to my name.  I still don't, but I enjoy life a whole lot more because I've learned that I shouldn't be working just to accumulate things.  Things won't go with me when I die.

5. Don't take everything seriously. - I've had friends whom I've tried to joke around with, but I couldn't because they take everything seriously.  Don't take everything in your life seriously.  If you can't laugh at yourself, it's your loss because you can be sure that people around you are laughing at you sometimes.  It helps a lot to have a 'go-with-the-flow' attitude.

6. Place importance on the quality of your friends, not the quantity. - If you have just one friend who's a good friend and doesn't try to do you wrong, he/she's worth more than 100 friends that do.  Don't place importance on the number of friends you have.  Build relationships with your friends, and they'll accumulate by themselves.

That's all I can think of right now, but that's pretty good for 11pm on a Monday night.

I'd also like to say thank you to my friends.  I enjoy spending time with you, and I hope that we'll be friends for a long time."

"event","I write when inspiration strikes, and here it goes.  I was thinking today about how so many people have so many failed relationships before they find 'the one'.  They ask themselves why this is, and  most people don't know.  I'm not bragging on myself, or anything I've thought of, but the thought struck me that people have so many failed relationships hecause they try to fill voids in their lives with relationships.

I mean, sometimes a girl's dad bails on her when she's two, and when she's 15, she's trying to date every minute of the day to find the love that her dad failed to provide her.  A guy may not have his mom in his life for many years, and he'll try to fill the void with a girlfriend.

I know I'm too young to be thinking about being a parent now, and I think you are too, but make a committment to yourself now that you won't be an absent parent.  Make a promise to yourself that you'll be there for your kids and you'll be prepared to learn how to parent them.  I think that if we had more whole families, we'd have a lot less of a 'problem' with teenagers having sex, among other things.  Think long and hard before you have sex, 'If she/I should become pregnant, am I ready to parent a child?'  If the answer's no, then ask yourself if you should have sex.  You never know what's gonna happen because of your actions.  I don't think that many of the teen parents today planned to have kids in their teenage years.

Now, back to the topic at hand...

There are voids in your life that can only be filled by one person.  It's like those toys from when you were a baby that had all the shaped blocks in them and you had to put the shaped blocks into the right shaped holes, or the blocks wouldn't go in.  There are voids inside of you in the shape of, say, a square.  Unless you put a square shaped block into that hole, the hole won't be filled right.  

Please, please don't try to fill square shaped holes with circle shaped blocks."

"event","I was flipping through the channels on the TV, and for whatever reason, I stopped on TBN.  Jentezen Franklin was on the screen preaching to a youth conference.  The passion he had for what he was speaking about awoke in me the desires that God has for me.  I remembered the plans God has for my life, and how I walked away from them.

For the past while, I'm not sure how long, I've been running from God.  I spoke to a friend from the church I used to go to, and I didn't like what he had to say.  When I talked to him, it opened up some wounds that weren't completely healed yet from the other church I was at shutting down.  

The only way I can explain how that feels is to imagine getting a divorce.  Imagine investing your time and energy into something you cared a lot for, and then have it ripped away, with little explanation.  I began to question inside myself whether or not God was real, and if he was, why he would let me suffer like that.  I wondered why I should bother living a life that didn't really make me happy if all I got for it was pain and suffering.

Now that I think about it, Jesus led a life that He didn't necessarily want to live.  He preached a gospel that people didn't accept.  He went against everything the world believed in.  His life ended in death to take things upon himself that He didn't have to take.

Maybe the life God has for me will resemble the life Jesus lived.  Maybe He wants to make me like his Son, because He loves me."

""Behold, I will bring them from the north country, and gather them from the ends of the earth, among them the blind and lame, the woman with child, and the one who labors with child together; a great throng shall return there.  They shall come with weeping, and with supplications I will lead them.  I will cause them to walk by the rivers of waters, in a straight way in which they shall not stumble; for I am a Father to Israel, and Ephraim is My firstborn.""
-Jeremiah 31:8-9 (NKJV)

""Hear the word of the LORD, O nations, and declare it in the isles afar off, and say, 'He who scattered Israel will gather him, and keep him as a shepherd does his flock.'  For the LORD has redeemed Jacob, and ransomed him from the hand of one stronger than he.  Therefore they shall come and sing in the height of Zion, streaming to t he goodness of the LORD--for wheat and new wine and oil, for the young of the flock and herd; their souls shall be like a well-watered garden, and they shall sorrow no more at all.""

"event","A friend of mine told me that for a guy who says he doesn't date, I sure do talk about sex and marriage a whole lot.  I thought about it, and I realize that I do talk about sex/love/marriage too much.  I don't mean to, but I'm going to stop.  If God's going to find my wife, won't He take care of all the other stuff?  Yes, He will!  I trust Him.

Don't ever listen to satan and his lies.  You don't realize how they will affect you.  One of his main entries into your life is through shortcomings that you have or that you percieve you have.  Don't listen to the lies.

Another friend of mine told me that he wasn't happy unless he was actively involved in ministry.  This guy has the heart of a true minister.  Before now, I couldn't understand what he was talking about.  However, now I do.  As much drama, personal sacrifice, pain, and suffering is involved in ministry, I'm not truly happy unless I'm doing ministry.  That's what I long for.

I would ask whoever reads this to take a survey of your dreams.  Ask yourself what you want to achieve, what you want to get out of life.  Ask God if those dreams are what He wants for you.  If they're not, then trade your dreams for His.  His dreams for your life are what you were born to do.  His plans are what you were made for.  Ask God to change your heart to follow His dreams.  There's nothing like it!

No, I'm not perfect.  I never claim to be.  I just wanna be like my Jesus.  I stand amazed at how much He's done in me and how far I've come, considering all the detours I've taken along the way and the multitudes of chances I've had to follow other ways.  I'm amazed at God, and His love for me.  I don't understand how He could love me the way that He does.  I've never, ever done anything to deserve the love that He gives me.  I know He's going to take care of me, no matter how He chooses to do it.  I don't have to worry about tomorrow.  Today has enough worries by itself!

I'll never understand why I've got what I've got.  I have friends who love me, not because they want to, but because God is working through them to love me.  I'll never know why I was chosen from the billions of people to do ministry in Birmingham, Alabama.  I'll never know why I was chosen to live for God.  I'll never know.

Here's a God-moment:

I was in worship one Sunday morning, and nothing was happening.  We were singing ""Lavish My Love"".  The chorus says "" ...pour my love on you. Like oil upon your feet, like wine for you to drink..."", and when I sang 'like wine for you to drink', I imagined handing Jesus wine, and HE TOOK IT!  JESUS, THE LORD OF ALL CREATION, took wine from ME!  Little 'ol me!  I couldn't imagine why He would take anything that I offered Him!  But He DID!  It was at that moment that I realized that Jesus loves me.  It's just like the song says!  Jesus loves me!

Yes, they're random, but they're in my head."

"event","I'm thinking again, and here's what I'm thinking about:

After my last post, people told me that I should wait on the Lord.  I've been doing that, or so I thought.  I see people around me whoare my age that have girlfriends, and they're having a good time.  Some are even married.  I've felt for a long time that God didn't want me to date.  Here I am, six years later, without so much as a girlfriend as far as that whole issue goes.  It makes me wonder if I should continue to wait, or just give up and do without the rest of my life.  I don't think I'm built to do without forever.  I think I'm built to have a wife, and maybe even kids.  I don't want to do without.  I have much to give to a wife.  And, it's fun for me to try and win a girl's heart.  But am I ready?  Am I at the point in my life where I can win a girl's heart, and get married to her, and be alright?  Am I at the point where I don't want any other girl's affection but my wife's?  Am I there?

I don't think I'm at the point in my life that I need to be to be able to get married.  So, that begs the question, why would I have anybody in my life at this point that I would even remotely think about marrying?  Why would I have one part of the equation without the other?

I don't know all the answers.  I don't know what to think, even. Give me your thoughts, please."

Whenever somebody significant in your life, whether it be a parent or not, dies, or otherwise extracts themselves from your life, your life becomes divided at that point.  There is the part of your life before the person died, and the part afterward.  You can't change the part before, but you can always change the part after.  You realize that the death affects the part afterward.  I often wonder, what would have happened if my dad HADN'T died?  How would my life be different?  Would I be where I am now?

I realize that there are a lot of people that this has happened to.  Some people move on to the part after the significant event, but some don't.  Some are stuck in the surreality of the significant event.  Some don't ever move on.  If this has happened to you, I encourage you to move on with your life.  You're going to be better off.

"event","I had a good time @ church today.  I've never felt at home before except at HCC.  It's amazing!  I hope things work out and we can move to Cullman and go to that church a lot more.  The people there were really friendly!  God is gonna do a lot through that church, and I hope to be a part of it.  I'm glad my friend is the pastor there too.  It's good for he and his wife."

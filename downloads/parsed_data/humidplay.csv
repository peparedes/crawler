"event","So I'm at Cinema Arts seeing ""Curse of the Golden Flower"" which is a pretty good movie actually, its just midway through the movie, I start to feel a tightening in my chest.  ""Holy shit!"", I thought as I grasped my chest, ""I'm having a heart attack!"" But this wasn't the case since when the movie was finally over, (Yes, I stayed for the entire thing; even if I am dying, I would never leave a theater for help because I want to see it through t te end), I went to the bathroom and saw my face to be tomato red.  After water and beer I deduced that it was the popcorn I ate.  So now, it's official, I'm allergic to popcorn.  Thanks God.  I fear that this isn't a proximity thing to popcorn either.  Now that would be real funny."

"event","So through events uncertain, or through my roommate, I was able to go to the Kennedy Center Honors Luncheon.  I was invited because my roommate knows I'm into film and Steven F'n Spielberg was suppose to be honored there.  So there I was excited to see Spielberg when four people who aren't Spielberg showed up.  I think it was Andrew Llyold (My broadways suck) Webber, Smokey Robinson (Not Spielberg), Zubin Metha(????), and Dolly Parton's face lift and boobs.  The speech guy said that Spielberg was en route and wouldn't make it to the lunch.  So there I was with my hopes faded, and then I looked at the table behind me.  The old man sitting there was fricking John Williams.  He was right there the whole time and no one was paying him any attention.  So I talked to him and got his autograph.  It was unbelievable.  I wanted to kiss him for making the event worth it for me but that would've probably given him a heart attack."

"event","I used to respect this man.  Well not really but I would at least recognize that he knows movies.  But this he has really done.  I can understand giving War of the Worlds 2.5 stars, but Silent Hill 1.5 stars?  Now this is not a rant about me disagreeing his review, this is because I am 100% confident that he did not even see this movie.  What he did was read a couple reviews which complained about how they did not understand the movie and put some crap together.

I mean the review goes like this, first he implies how he thinks Video games could never be on the same level as movies (Which is a other rant for another day, I mean, how can he have a legal opinion on video games when he has never played them?)  Anyways then he talks about how he didn't know what happened during the movie.  He then adds filler shit on how he has been to some debate on video games.  Then says movie bad, and then makes fun of gamers in general.  So yeah you tell me that he actually saw the movie and reviewed it.  He is just mad because the Director, Christophe Gans, told Ebert to fuck off with his opinion on video games.  

It's just lame how people can praise other movie for being complex and want you to think about it and then when this movie comes around just bash it.

And yes I have seen the movie and it completely lived up to my expectations. Sure Sean Bean can't hide his accent worth a damn and some of the dialog sucks,  but the most important thing is that I didn't have to force myself to like it.  It has beautiful cinematography, gorgeous music, awesome practical effects and some CGI are cool.  Everything just clicked for me.  I didn't find it confusing at after THINKING about and..........you know I'm going to stop, bottom line GOOD MOVIE.   Critics need to get their heads out their asses now."

"event","For a while I had my doubts about the upcoming Silent Hill movie.  I mean, every video game movie sucks.  The best one is Resident Evil which is real discouraging considering that the movie sucks.  So I guess that video game movie can only be rated on levels of suckage.  But then I saw the trailer for this Silent Hill.  I almost cried it was so accurate to the games which basically horror movies to begin with.  That's when i started reading a bit more about the movie.  It's directed by Christopher Gans (Hey I liked ""Brotherhood of the Wolf"") and written by Roger Avary who basically wrote Pulp Fiction.  But I still had some doubts until I saw this:

This is pyramid head. Kneel before him.  Or you'll end up like that full sized human he is holding.  And if anyone sees that and shrugs it off saying, ""It's just a stupid guy with a pyramid on his head, that dumb."" Then just wait till what he does in the movie.  

And I am aware that it a tetrahedron on his head."

"event","Man, oh, man, I found this on a forum from a source who found it on a website.  The grammar sucks, but I don't blame the person who wrote it.  It describes what the news won't about the Hurricane. 




Part 1:

This was his prior post

He just made it back said saying the news is only showing 10% of what reallying going on. He said he went out on his bike to check on some neighbors when he came up on the local hardwhare store that has beethere for over 100yrs. He said 6 guys were robbing the place stealing the industrail floor scrubers and loading them into a HOME DEPOT van that was obviously stolen. WTF!! He told them it's a F8(king shame what you're doing"" He said about 4 of them pulled out guys and said ""**** you cracker, this is our time, pay ack for being oppessed""

He said in fear of his life he hauled azz. He said as he was leaving a mob of about 20 people were carrying axes breaking into peoples homes and stealing. He said most places that are being hit are jewlery stores and drug stores.

He said the icing on the cake is when he was at a 4way stop (red lights are out) when he heard a loud noise it was a truck that rammed into Wal-Mart. Around 50-100 people ran inside and wheeled out entire clothes racks, DVD players, etc.

Our house is fine, no damage except for the roof but now worried about MOFO's stealing our stuff.

I'm sure I'll get flammed but we are going back Thursday or Friday to get out stuff. Firepower and ammo will not be lacking I can asure you.

PART 2:

First off I wanted to post what REALLY is going on in this city. Please don't get this thread locked people. The news stations are only showing a minuscule of reality. This post may offend some people but I will post what I saw, like it or not it is REALITY.
.

Well last night I was watching the 6pm news when they announced the 17th street canal pumps failed as well as another break in the levee. My house is right off St. Charles Ave. and up to 6pm yesterday is was the only part of the city that was dry. Since the pumps failed and the new break St. Charles Ave. would be under 9ft of water in the next 12-15hrs. My brother and I felt if we wanted to save anything we had to leave NOW. We loaded up flashlights, rope, our medical ID's, both our .45 Glocks, 2 shotguns and rode out. En-route we listened to the radio which broad casted all the news about the looters and what not, in hindsight it was a mistake. My mother didn't want us to go by dad who is a Vietnam vet told to be safe and ""shoot to kill"" if it ever comes to that.

One the way we had to pass 5-6 checkpoints to allow entry into the city. We stated we were medical personnel who were activated, showed our ID and off we went. On the radio reports were coming in about the officer who was shot in the head, the 2 gunman who opened fired on the NOPD station, and how looters were carjacking cars to get out of the city. This started making my brother nervous and giving seconds thoughts.

Anyway we get to the city and it looks like a freaking war zone. The best visual I can give is the movie ""Blackhawk Down"" when all the Somalians are rushing the city. They are people EVERYWHERE, they are pissed off, and all have weapons, 2X4's, Axes, and guns. If this wasn't bad enough we are 2 white boys in a truck in a sea several hundred armed pissed off blacks. There wasn't a white person to be found. I couldn't get over the little 8-10yr old kids with weapons, I ever saw one carry a claw hammer!

These people were absolutely nuts rammed trucks(stolen I'm sure) in to jewelry stores stealing items, they were tearing apart Wal-Mart carrying out TV's, Playstations, DVD players, etc. One lady was wheeling out an entire rack of merchandise, not sure what it was but sure wasn't clothes for food. They were all laughing and carrying on like it's freaking Christmas.

We got stuck in traffic when we see the group of guys walking down the street w/ AK-47's, at that point the ""pucker factor"" kicked in, a couple Glocks and shotguns were no match for that. We haul azz trying to get to Uptown when we see these people chopping down the front door w/ an axe of this $4-5 million dollar mansion on ST. Charles Ave. I was just in total awe because it was so surreal. Making matters worse it's 11pm at night there is no electricity and you really can see anything or anyone until they are right up on you. 

Our plan was to be in and out in 30min, this included putting his Harley on the trailer. It would have taken me 5-10min tops to get my stuff, all I wanted was my pictures from college, my clothes/shoes, and my computer tower. Well he got scared saying we are going to get jumped while putting the bike on the trailer. Keep in mind this is the only area in the city that is dry. So just like rats who move to higher ground these people were doing the same. Word must have gotten out that Uptown was dry so there started to be a large influx of people.

Needless to say he wanted to go home rather than take our chances. While it was the smart thing to do I was beyond infuriated w/ him because we made it this far. He just kept saying our lives aren't worth it. So we turned around, our next challenge was getting out of the city while not getting jacked. Reports came out that people were jumping in the back of truck holding the drivers at gunpoint. Traffic started to slow so I just nailed it got out as fast as I could.

Even though he was the voice of reason I'm still pissed. All I have is my life and the clothes on my back. I lost my house(which is now 9ft underwater) ALL my clothes, TV, computer, furniture, and photo albums and videos from childhood and college. What makes this worse is my brother owned the house and I was a tenant and I didn't have renters insurance, hindsight is 20/20.

I also hope everyone of the f-cking looters get Tetanus, E-Coli and F*(KING drown. I'm serious I really hope the all die for what they were doing to the city, killing people, and destroying homes. Never in my life have I ever seen people act live savages, it was truly sicking.

"event","It's been a while but I have finally gained the strength to write on this again.
First off, the beach rules, got wasted the other night with family friends, still haven't recovered. I also get a King sized bed of my own while at the second beach house we stay at.  I'm waiting for my Bagel Bakery to fuck up my schedule again since they probably forgot that my vacation goes till next Sunday.  I could care less about them, since they're under new management.  If the new guys don't like me then fire me bitches.  God I need to see War of the Worlds again.  And Batman Begins.  Hate the fact that I talked to someone on AIM who said that they thought seeing the WOTW is a waste of money.  Now I respect other peoples opinions but when they follow up with, ""But I'm seeing Fantastic Four mos def lol!!""  Even though they also said it would probably suck.  I'm sick of this shit with people complaining about the cost of movies.  They obviously don't know how to count change, or when obviously have the money in the first place.  WOTW was a good and entertaining movie, get over the fucking ending!!!!, it's how the book ended assholes.  I've also been told by someone, ""But humidplay!, why should I care about three people when millions of people are dying?"" Well, let's see, it's hard to make a movie when the whole world is the main character.  If you want to see the story of millions of people while tripods destroy them then be my guest.  Besides the main characters represents everyone else anyways.  They don't know what the fuck is going on and just trying to get out of there.  I'll stop there, I could ramble on all day defending the movie but I won't. But if you want to argue about WOTWs or Batman Begins then respond."

But my troll of a manager just looks at me with a half a smile (Half because have her teeth are missing on the upper part of her jaw).  But whatever I don't mind too much.  I also got the new Coldplay album which is really really good.  It isn't as good as the others, but those were brilliant albums in themselves.  I would recommend anyone with musical taste to check the new one out."

"event","Housing at my school sucks period. They are a bunch of swindling pieces of shit.  First of they charge me for my twit roommates actions.  But I don't mind them billing me for a broken chair and broken blinds.  But then I came across a new email that stated a new problem, there was tape residue on the room floor.  Holy shit!!  Call a doctor! Call a locksmith! Call a Jedi!  God forbid tape residue!  I sure hope the death count was low in cleaning it up. But what the fuck do I know I'm not a forensics expert.  They even split the fine five ways.  And speaking of Jedi, all I hear about these days from different people is what Lucas should of included in Episode 3.  For Gods Sake!! Don't encourage him!!  Next thing you know, he'll be making a directors cut of things he wanted in the movie but couldn't put in the movie in time.  Like putting a voice-over in during the title crawl.(That might actually be cool).  Or Jar-Jar Binks giving the memorium speech at Padme's funeral, ""Me'sa miss her very much okiday!!"" Then hilarity will ensue when Jar-Jar knocks the coffin over tries to fix it only to make things...get this...WORSE!!  Then that big fat blob Gungan can make that clicking noise and shake his lips and the movie ends.  And that's all that's on my mind at the moment, back to HBO's ""Empire Falls"" and ""Warm Springs""  Jesus I feel like I'm being smothered in mediocrity."

Simply put, I couldn't write even if someone held an active chain saw to throat while kicking me in my testicles!?  Yeah even my jokes suck.  I know this because my roommate would tell me everyday.  He knows everything.  He even knows how to sleep an entire semester and somehow pass his classes.  Did I mention he wears a crown declaring he is king of my floor?  Yeah, real special he is.  Anyway, I think Phantom of the Opera sucks.  If you don't believe me, then just listen to Masquerade, or however you spell it, I don't know if live journal has spell check and if it doesn't I'm fucked.

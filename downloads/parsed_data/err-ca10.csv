"event","My face to the sky
Dreaming about just how high
I could go and I'll know
When I finally get there

Taking of my glasses
Sun pokes through my lashes
And somehow I know
There's a time for every star to shine

Everybody got their something
Everybody got their something
Make you smile like an itty bitty child

People keeping score
Say better hurry up and get yours
Cause somebody else get your spot
Before you even dropped

Seek and you shall find
Everything in my own sweet time
I'll take my chances
With what I believe is only mine

Busy holding on
So the roof don't fly
Keep you from moving on
So get it right
Turn the tide over
Like a love song
Like a butterfly
Believe if you hand it over
You'll come out all right

Everybody got their something
Everybody got their something
Make you smile like an itty bitty child

Illuminate the silly things
Shed some light on all that's wrong
Everybody need it sometime
Sometimes the only thing you got
Is what makes you feel like
You're something else altogether
You have everything don't need
Another reason to be something
I've been on a ride
And caught up in the landslide
But I'm gonna spread my wings and fly...

Everybody got their something
Everybody got their something
Make you smile like an itty bitty child

There's a time for every star
There's a time for every star..."

"event","today was jimmy's graduation. i woke up at about 7 and got ready and was at the high school by 8. we loaded the buses and left for the silverdome. we got there, set up and play Festivity. Then the graduation actually began. when the choir sang i started to tear up, which was sad. then there was some speeches made and the diploma's were given out. when jimmy walked across the stage it really didnt seem like he just graduated. it seemed to go by really quick, but yet it was very sad. but hey my summer starts in 5 days and i know we're going to have a great 3 months of vacation together!



jimmy i love you and im so very proud of you!

"event","wow!! prom was the fricken shit. i had such a GREAT time. it seriously kicked major ass. it started off with a boring day at school, it seemed like it would drag on forever. anways, when i got home i had to get some stuff together, and then i went to my hair appointment at two. i basically told her i wanted it down and that she could to whatever she wanted with it. surprisingly it wasnt that bad, i kinda liked it. anyways, i came home and did my make up, and got dressed. jimmy came and picked me up at about 4:15. and yeah he was lookin mighty good. we took pics at my house and then we went to fern hill to see his grandma and take pics there. then we went to jimmy's house and took pics there. after jimmy and i and our parents went over to the termans for group pictures. yeah that was interesting. it was me, jimmy, matt, steph, scott, amber, becky, adam, marcelo, and adreinne. we seroulsy took like a hundred pictures it was sad. marcelo and adrienne were that last ones there, so we had to wait a little longer until they got there. then around ten to six, we left to go to prom. it was at villa penna's out by lakeside. as soon as we walked in the first person i saw was mr.spotts. lol that was interesting. after we took pictures and went inside. we were at table 14, the same group that we took pics with was at our table. we just kinda chilled for a bit as everyone came in. that was quite a sight, some people im tellin ya, it was funny. we could tell matt and jimmy were hunger they kept checking what time it was. finally about 7:20 our food came out. we started with the italin wedding soup, then pasta, then salad, then our main course chicken/roast beef, potatoes, and green beans. after we had dessert. it was soooo good. none of us could really move we ate so much but we managed to as soon as the music came on. it was a lot of fun. i saw tiff and jacklyn, and nicki. that was cool it made me feel a little better to see people from my grade. lol. anyways we danced and laugh and just had a great time. there was so many people, which made it really hot, but it was totally worth it. it went by so fast, but it was a rockin good time. after a group of us went back to jimmy's spent the night. we ate again, and watched american wedding, i think i fell alseep for a little while, but i woke up and was ready to go. at about 3:00 marcelo decided to come back, and jimmy and i didnt fall asleep till about 3:30. it was really nice to be able to fall asleep in his arms. we woke up about 6:30 because we could hear his dad and sister getting ready to leave. but we soon drifted beck off to our little dreams. we all woke about 10:30 and mrs. beth made us a really nice breakfast and brought it down to us. after we watched full metal jacket, why i dont know. around 1:00 everybody left, but i stayed till about 2 just to chill with jimmy and help him pick up a bit. i can honestly say it was the best night of my life. it was amazing, like a fairytale almost. the only bad part about it was, it finally really hit me that jimmy's graduated in a few weeks. well, i dont want to talk about that now. all i know is i love jimmy and im so happy that he asked me to go with him, eventhough i am his girl. lol. this is a night i will always remember.


i love you so much jimmy, thank you for the best night ever

It's Still Rock and Roll To Me Lyrics

What's the matter with the clothes I'm wearing?
""Can't you tell that your tie's too wide?""
Maybe I should buy some old tab collars?
""Welcome back to the age of jive.
Where have you been hidin' out lately, honey?
You can't dress trashy till you spend a lot of money.""
Everybody's talkin' 'bout the new sound
Funny, but it's still rock and roll to me

What's the matter with the car I'm driving?
""Can't you tell that it's out of style?""
Should I get a set of white wall tires?
""Are you gonna cruise the miracle mile?
Nowadays you can't be too sentimental
Your best bet's a true baby blue Continental.""
Hot funk, cool punk, even if it's old junk
It's still rock and roll to me

Oh, it doesn't matter what they say in the papers
'Cause it's always been the same old scene.
There's a new band in town
But you can't get the sound from a story in a magazine...
Aimed at your average teen

How about a pair of pink sidewinders
And a bright orange pair of pants?
""You could really be a Beau Brummel baby
If you just give it half a chance.
Don't waste your money on a new set of speakers,
You get more mileage from a cheap pair of sneakers.""
Next phase, new wave, dance craze, anyways
It's still rock and roll to me

What's the matter with the crowd I'm seeing?
""Don't you know that they're out of touch?""
Should I try to be a straight 'A' student?
""If you are then you think too much.
Don't you know about the new fashion honey?
All you need are looks and a whole lotta money.""

""How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is to be loved by you

I needed the shelter of someone's arms, and there you were
I needed someone to understand my ups and downs, and there you were
With sweet love and devotion
Deeply touching my emotion
I want to stop and thank you baby
I want to stop and thank you baby

How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is to be loved by you

I close my eyes at night
Wondering where would I be without you in my life
Everything I did was just a bore
Everywhere I went it seems I'd been there before
But you brighten up for me all of my days
With a love so sweet in so many ways
I want to stop and thank you baby
I just want to stop and thank you baby

How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is to be loved by you

You were better to me than I was to myself
For me, there's you and there ain't nobody else
I want to stop and thank you baby
I just want to stop and thank you baby

How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is to be loved by you""


i love you"

"event","sorry i havent wrote in here for so long but ive been on vacation in washington d.c for winter break. anyways my week was really really fun, and it practically flew by. here's what happened:

so last saturday (valentine's day) i boarding my plane to go visit my aunt and uncle in washington d.c. anyways the flight was alright, it was only like an hour, so it wasnt that bad. anyways when i got there they picked me up at baggage and we went out to lunch at ruby tuesdays. after we went to their house and i unpacked, and of course i had to say hi to their puppy kaiser. so then we just really kinda hung out the rest of day. we all made pizza together, and talked. we watched some movie called second hand lions which actually was good. then we went to bed. 

on sunday we woke up and went to church, it was nice to go to a church other then your own, i really enjoyed it. after we went back home, and my aunt and i got ready to go out for the day. my uncle had to stay home and write a paper (he's a colonel in the air force and works at the pentagon). anyways we decided to go to mount veron. we havent been there in about 7 years, and the last time we went we really couldnt see much because my grandpa was in a wheelchair and nothing was handicap acessable. anyways we went there and had a really great time. we came home and made some din din and hung out for a bit.

on monday my uncle had the day off of work so we went to the new air and space musuem by dulles airport. it was so much fun. i mean my uncle knew everything about all the planes and spacecraft there. i always tend to learn a lot when im around him. we were there for the whole day. it was really nice to see him enjoying something that i know he loves so much. he really doesnt have time to do much with his job and all. so after we went home and my aunt and i looked through some of her old pictures, which was hilarious considering my mom was in some of them too. then we made dinner and watched the right stuff which is about the first american astronauts in space, then we all hit the sack. 

on tuesday my aunt and i didnt go anywhere. instead i started to help her pack. her and my uncle are moving to japan, he's being transferred there. so we started sorting through some things and deciding what she should and shouldnt take. that was the basis of the day, but it gave my aunt and i good quality time together. later that night jimmy called from california, telling me how this was the ""trip from hell"" and how he wanted to go home. i really felt bad for him, i wish he had a better time.

on wednesday my aunt and i woke up did some stuff around the house. after we went to panara bread for lunch and we went to the movies to go see cold mountain. wow. a little too graphic for erica in more ways then one. im not going to go into any detail. 

on thursday my aunt had a surprise for me. we went to the marriot hotel and had a tea party. i know your all thinking o yeah that sounds like fun. but in all honesty it was. it was very very nice. we had tea and little sandwiches and dessert. it was very elegant, we had a really nice conversation. the only problem was after our 4th cup of tea we were a little wired off of caffeine. but it was all good, we enjoyed ourselves. and once again my sweetie called my to tell my how awful his trip was, i wish i could have made it better for him. 

on friday it was the nicest day we had all week. it was like 62 and sunny. my aunt and i took the metro into d.c we didnt really do a lot because the last time i went there we did everything. so we decided to go to pentagon city mall and have lunch and well....shop of course. we ate a johnny rockets, which has like the best malts ever. then i had to go on a man hunt for jimmy's pin he wanted. i ended up finding one and i picked him up a shirt too just for the heck of it. then we went into godiva which is like the best chocolate ever. the two guys working there thought we were sisters but we think they were just messing with us and that was their pick up line. anyways we went home and waited for my uncle to get home, which happened to be like 10, and then we spent our last night together laughing and talking, just doing what we do best.

on saturday we woke up and i packed my things. i said goodbye to kaiser and we went out to breakfast. we were running really late so my uncle had to speed all the way to the airport. we got there with only a half hour before my plane was leaving. well it turns out i was the last one that needed to board and they paged me in the airport. it was kinda funny anyways  we cried and i hurried and said goodbye and i ran to the gate, and just made it. when i got to the airport my mom was there waiting to pick me up. she had me a dozen roses and said that they were from jimmy (yesterday was 4 months for us). then we went home. jimmy called to make sure i got home safe.  then the fam and i went out to dinner at olive garden.

today my mom and i went to church and out to port huron mall with my grandma, it was such a looooong drive. anyways i was going to pick up jimmy tonight from the airport but it turns out that his flight got canceled so now his whole family has to go to l.a. and get a flight there. i guess they wont be home until about 12:30 tonight. so when i was talking to him, i lost my connection and havent talked to him since. i really hope he has a safe flight; him and his family. 

anyways thats about it kiddies, im out for now


jimmy i love and miss you so much, i cant wait to see you"

"event","wow.....what a great night last night was. i had sooooo much fun. it started with jimmy coming over at like 5:20, and of course mother had to take 12 pictures!!!!!! omg she was like crazy with the camera. then we left and went to his house and took pictures there. his parents werent as bad with the camera, but i was still seeing spots. so then we left and met matt, steph, john, joy, sarah, and justin at tuscan bistro. we saw jimmy's grandparents there, it was kinda funny. dinner was good, but i think my iq dropped about 10 points just from the conversations i was listening to. lol. anyways we got done eating like 45 minutes before the dance, so well all went back to jimmy's for like a half hour. around 7:20 we left and went to the dance. at first there wasnt that many people there so we just kinda hung out you could say; well everyone but jimmy he was already dancing. lol. it was hilarious i mean the kid's crazy. so he got us all riled up and we all started to dance, and everything just went up from there. it was so much fun. i saw jaq, alison, mallory, amy, just a whole bunch of people. of course jimmy sang to the whole night, which was so extremely sweet. i was sad when it was over, it was seriously like the best night of my life. no joke. and i know prom will be even better with him. after matt, steph, scott, jimmy, and i went back to jimmy's and ate pizza and watched tommy boy. that was fun too, just laying around being dorks. so around 12:45 my parents called cause they went out and neither of them had a key to get in, so i had to come home to let them in. i was really upset and so was jimmy. this week our time together is well....precious. we're both going out of state for a week, and its going to be really really hard for the both of us. so i came home took a shower. then jimmy called at about 1:45 to say goodnight. and i went to bed and dreamt sweet dreams.

thank you jimmy for giving me the best night of my life. you're my best friend i love  you with all my heart.

everything with everyone that happened, is slowly progressing. i mean things will never be the same between us i dont think, but for now we're good where we're at.

snow ball is saturday im looking forward to that. i think it will be a lot of fun. regardless of how miserable i feel, im going to make the very very best of it....people dont like me ""difficult"".lol.

the only thing that im dreading about snowball is that once it's over i have nothing but bad things to look forward to. the main one would be me leaving for d.c., on saturday which is valentines day. it's sad i wont see jimmy for a week, but i think in the end it will make us realize just how lucky we are to have each other. 

.....thats about it really sorry for such a boring entry but nothing too exciting is happening in my life right now that ya'll need to hear about. :)

yesterday was also mine and jimmy's happy three month day! lol! yeah its kinda cheesy but its also kinda sweet too. he came over last night and we just hung out, which was really nice. but in all seriousness these seriously have been the best three months. he's so incredibly good to me. i love spending time with him, and i miss him when we're not together. i love him with all my heart. and i cant wait for the wonderful future we have together. and for whoever said that comment about how im the one thats not be treated fairly or whatever. i want you to know that i am. you obviously dont know all the sweet, caring things that he does for me. our relationship is more then you think it is. its the most wonderful thing in my life right now, and im so lucky to have him. 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
now to today. today was good it was a blue day as you know. i had english, which was kinda easy today we just went to the lab and looked up stuff on shakespeare, thats really about it. in bio we took notes for what seemed like FOREVER. and then we had to make a poster involving consumers, producers, ya know all that good stuff, angela was my partner which was nice, shes's really a sweetie. in math, for once i actually like knew what i was doing and raised my hand quite a bit throughout that class. and of course abi was making me laugh so hard that my side hurt. i love that kid. and in spanish once again was a lost soul. i cant believe im saying this but i really wish that i would have had mrs. danforth last semester. i have no idea what shes talking about 3/4 of the time. it will take a while for me to catch up, but i think if i really work my butt off i can handle it, so im not too worried. and on a good point i got 3 points today. dont ask me how but i did. after school we had our day of softball conditioning. it really wasnt that bad i was really surprised. i havent ran since bball season, but i was fine (for the most part). liz: ""punch my leg, i bet it wont hurt"" lol. i really like cant wait for the season to start. it's gonna kick! after that i went to my brothers bball game at richards. my grandpa, and grandma, and my other grandma, my parents, and jimmy were there. they won and nick scored like 4 points or something. im kinda sad that his last game is on monday, but thats okay his baseball season starts soon anyways. so thats about it, and im off to go finish my american history homework for mrs. i. bubi kiddies.


i LOVE jimmy so so so much, he gives my heart butterflies"

"event","today turned out to be a really good day. i woke up, worked out a  little, and basically just chilled, which was cool i like it. i talked to my cousin lance on the phone for a while, which was nice considering that he lives in texas and i like never hear from him. then i went to my brothers basketball game. it was really exciting they won in overtime, i was really happy for him and his team. after i went and sat in the waiting room at the dermo for like an hour waiting for mommy, but after we picked up nick and got subway so it was all good. when i got home i called jimmy and we had our little nightly talk on the phone. o how i love those, especially the one tonight, i could not stop laughing. maybe it's because he's such a goofy ""o.s.o"". lol. anyways yeah i studied a little bit for health but i know it all  pretty well. and i just found out some hopefully great new about my buddy ""lewis"". i'm so happy for her, i really hope that everything works out. well im gonna go for now. bubi


i love my jimmy....and yes i did think of and miss you today just like i do everyday....you're my everything never forget that"

"event","yeah so yesterday was an ok day. woke up didnt do much, i helped my brother with some of his homework. but thats about it. then once again jimmy and i got into an ""argument"" about stupid stuff as usual. anyways i went over to his house later and we chilled, i thought we were going to go bowling with some friends but they either didnt call us, or i didnt get their message, either way its all good. so yeah thats about it. life is getting better, at least it doesnt completely suck anymore. hey, who knows maybe it might even get to the point where i dont have to cry anymore.

"event","its the end of another year and i feel disappointed. i feel like i should be way different then i was last year or the beginning of this year. not sure why and then again i guess someone never really notices themselves change. but i feel like somethings missing its hard to discribe i guess. i feel like i should ve accomplished more this year. . .

on another note besides being bored with my life right now everything else is going ok. im learning a lot at school. our new teach is pretty cool. she seems to have a nice balance between the traditional and modern plus she s going to organize some contests and work more make up into our curriculum so yay. though it seems like the owners are having some trouble running the place and there s a closure scare runnin rampant through everyones minds. i hope they dont because i feel like they could turn it into a bad ass school. plus im happy i got in early, they re talking about raising tuition for incoming classes because of the changes they want to make

aaron and i are ok i guess even though i feel more like his friend then his girlfriend most ofthetime.       ugh mystupid space key isnt workingwell

Valentines news!
i love-tagged brandons car while he was at work. i had so much fun doing it but i was sad no one wanted to come with me and help me. so my accomplise was this stuffed dolphine that brandon gave me for v day (he also gave me flowers in this beautiful swan vase, a stuffed bear and chocolates) i took pics and ill add them later. i only wish i could have done it a little better but i was all parinoid cuz of amandas cop talk and the cameras in the parking lot. but i had fun writing lovey stuffs on his windows with red and white shoe polish and leaving the card and chocolates (the funny thing was that he gave the chocolates but i forgot some so i used his lol) i was sad though cuz when i got home i found these cute buttons that i wanted to put on his antenna so i sent them a picture of them! the best part was that i was a little afraid he would get mad but he loved it and even drove home with all the decorations still on the car. (i gave him water and paper towels so he wouldn t have to) i did it so he could take pictures for me!

DANANANA! david to the rescue, lol he was some crazy cool geological something something guy, lol.
then the next night libby and i went to hang with will and his crazy room mate mike. oh and there next door neighbors alex and matt. it was alot of fun cuz me and libby were wasted by the time we got there from drinking earlier. so we all talked for a bit at will's then headed over to alex's where i took my first official shot of taquila!! after that we all played one of THE best games of kings ive ever played! and as if that wasnt enough we hit up a party at this hot polish guys house!! i think his name was quba or something lol.but he was so cool and i even got to dance with him!! and he had a badass setup at his house with dj, dance floor and lights!! so after more crazy danicing and drinking and happenings we headed home. even though libby wanted to stay the night, crazy chick. but i dont do that so i said no.

work sucks, they treat us like crap most of the time.

im with brandon again. if i havent mentioned. its alright. im trying to careless about what he does and who he is so there is less drama. we re better at talking things through when stuff is bothering us. though i think im more open then he is, as always. well for the most part.

im going to try and registar for school on thursday. i thought that i missed the date all together so i spent my tuition on presents and fixing my car but they say there is a payment plan that i might be able to do so well see if i can or if our plans to go register even happen.

oh im doing pretty good with my car though. got new tires and an oil change done on it along with new windshield whipers and a new pvc or something part with was all gross.
things that still need to be done:
radiator flush

pull cord for the hood replaced
brakes done

"event","ok so im at work. bar and grill. and ofcourse there are ppl drinking. and usually our employes are pretty good at maintaing the drink flow. but i hate it when someone whos a friend of the owner comes in or a friend of one of the managers comes in and drink all they want. i especially hate it when its the MANAGER serving them and she dosent bother to cut them off until half the staff is talking about it. then it seems like she only does it to cover her own stupid ass. and i can say shes stupid becase when i metion that one of the tables is wasted and all she has to say to me is dont tell me how to do my job i already cut them off. REALLY? thats hard to belive considering i go out there to check and guess what the ppl who are drunk falling all over themselves and acting stupid have a drink in there hand. now i know they could just be the type of ppl to act like when they re haveing a good time and i considered that. but i talked to one of the idiots and he was GONE. he was acting like that guy at the party who tries hitting on you (which he did) and you try really hard to avoid them and give them a fake age (which i did, told him i was 17). 
so finally the manager (to save her own ass) finally cuts them off and they leave. saying they re ok and they dont need a cab. one guy got angry when my friend asked him if he wanted us to call him a cab and took off QUICK.
i hate ppl like that and i hate even more that i dont know what to do in that kind of situation."

so new rule. i shall only party with suli. if i ever get again. or maybe steven cuz the party he took me too was pretty good.

"event","because it would have been the same stuff i wrote a few months ago about brandon. and it would have been tireing to have to read the samethings over and over again. so the jist of it. i let him convince me that he was ready to try again. to talk and to really be together. butt yet agian it was all half truths and empty promises. he was excited about the idea of what we could have been and the idea of being in a real loving and caring family. but without sex and with the thought of comitment (which scared the fuck out of him. his words) we were doomed to fail again. i just thought maybe this time i can be with the man i love and be happy. i was wrong.

how can it be so hard to be with the one you love? i always hated the quote that "" sometimes love just isnt enough "" . but sadly i can see why its true. especially considering that when the love is one sided, its doomed to fail.

when one person is more willing to try and to change and to work with the person they love to improve thier relationship its just not going to work. talking is all good and fine but when its empty promises and usless words that are used to blind one person into a fakebelive relationship its just not worth it. and hopefully its all seen before things go too far.

"event","to give him the power to hurt me again to start caring so much that every little thing he does or doesnt do hurts me or make me upset. i know it would be easier to just forget him. to push him out of my life and not think about him, lol like i dont think about him everyday as is, or rather to think about him less and less. to know that he is not that big part of my life any more and that i shouldnt care. but is that really easier. no matter what i do im always going to think of that idiot. hes stuck in my brain and i wish i could have him removed. lol like in the movie (crap forgot what its called) but id be ok with forgetting. atlest i think i would. why do people willing put themselves through this shit. because they see the ""potential"" in the situation is the only thing i can believe. i hate that you shouldnt be with someone because they have potential or because the relationship has potential. what does that even mean. oh i think youll be a good partner lets test it? what the fuck is that? you should be with someone because you cant see your self with anyone else. because you can see your self building a life with that person. ugh i hate this. 

so why should i talk to him? he didnt want to get back together when i was fighting for it. but now all of a sudden he wants to? is he just lonely and too lazy or too scared to find someone else? maybe he tried going back to someone familiar and they said no so im his last resort before the long wait of finding someone else who has potential. and you know what i live so far away from him now. he has some strange obsession with his g/fs being close to him and im not. guess who is but maybe she said no. i just dont get it. why now, what changed? 

i want to know what he thinks is going to happen if we get back together. where he thinks we re going to go. what he wants out of our relationship. and what he is willing to do to be with me. whether he is willing to follow all of my crazy rules and regulations until i trust him again. i also want to know that if hes learned im not to treat me like some little girl yet expect me to know how a relationship works and be able to jump into every situation with the knowledge and experiance of someone who been . . . married. 

one thing i want him to know is that if he really wants what those around us have that he has to fucking fight for it. not expect it to just land in his lap. he is not that lucky and sure as hell not that deserving. nobody deserves the perfect relationship right off the bat. as a matter of fact i think that is impossible and to think otherwise is to be a fucking fool.

i am a greedy as person i want everything my way and right away. no if and or buts about it. i dont want him talking to his exs. namely her because frankly i dont know any of the others personally, not that i really know her, and dont see them as a threat. thats right im an insecure little girl on this subject and i see her as a threat. i honestly alwayas see other girls ass a threat i just didnt care enough to really let it effect me. i guarded myself so that if he ever cheated on me sure it would hurt like hell but id be ready for it and would be able to deal. after all hes a sex fend and if hes not getting it from i expect him to be looking for it in other places. hes stupid for not know that he could have any girl he wants.  

but im so tired of thinking of all of this and of crying over him. i dont want to have to deal with this anymore and right now dont see the point in forcing myself to do so. he sure as hell hasnt shown true feelings for me, to me. it all seems like a game to him. hes very good with words and because of this he is very good at menipulating people to do and think what he wants. hes very good at doing all the right things to get what he wants when he wants it and trys not to be seen as the bad guy through it all. maybe hes just bored and has nothing better to do then to play with me. im sure he sees how easy it is.

but maybe im just being spiteful."

1. started working at BUFFALO WILD WINGS!!! 7/24 -not sure how that ll go it seems fun but like alot of work for low pay, we'll see

2. brandon came over to watch movies 7/23 -we watched The Water Horse and Lars and the Real Girl, LTRG was way good, though water horse was boring. -totally aw . . .kward! and wierd i think he still has the misconception of having ""rights to me"" and that ill include him in everything. such as when i want to go out or what i ve been up to. -though he is learning, slowly, so ill give him credit for that. -chris and antony where there so it wasnt so awkward but im not sure how to act around him anymore

3. brandon came over again 7/25 -we watched Fools Gold -lame it was alright but not what i wouldnt want to watch it over and over, just everyonce in a long while. -still awkward. i act like a stupid school girl around him and HATE it but im working on it. its only because im not totally confident. -without chris or antony there we had awkward silences which i hate with other ppl but with him dont mind. lol not sure why.

4. went to an Isotposes game 7/24 -with FREE tiks from my new jobizzle yo. lol. -it was kind of boring not a very exciting game. though im not sure im much of a baseball person. -still had fun with suli! taking lots of pics, lol and making her mad. -it was nice to do something new. -we wanna go back with boys and pigout on ballpark food. mmmmm . . . dions and nachos. ugh so hungry.

5. HALF STACHE CONCERT!!!1 :( 7/19 -it was so much fun to go to thier concert, thouh sadly it was their last, their fairwell concert. -MIB and The Big Spank played too!. -MADE IN BANGLADESH was sooo good. ow! they rock. -it helps that the sax player is cute. hehe -who by the way we talked to. *sigh* im a sucker for a musician especially when they have long hair and hazle eyes. but i really only want to be friends. NTS: gotta remeber to tell him that, lol. -OH!!! almost forgot i got MIB to sign my shirt!!! though i am missing one sig. but will hopefully get it at the next conert. -any way great night of fun with friends and badass music biznatches!!!!1

6. took lots of pics of everything ( - work) -duh! it me, lol

"event","im happy and relived to say that i am getting better at talking things out and turning things over in my head with the people i care about. sometimes im to emotional for it to help all that much. but other times when i really hash it out and explore my thoughts and why i think them and explore my emotions and why i feel them that i can understand to look at things from more then one point of view i can learn and grow into the person i want to be. it helps me to make a decision and follow through with it because i know what i want to do, what i plan to do is what will help me to devlope into that person. i am greatful for those around me that i love and that love me enough to deal with all my craziness and help me get through my difficult times. with out them i would be lost, a drift at sea with out a sail, but thankfully they are my sail and my sanity. the main point of all of this is that i know what i want, i know what i should do. whether the i know what i should do comes around to the i know what i want is a different and hopefuly happy ending. for now i know what i should do to be the person i want to be in life and seeing that i believe in fate and all hopefully that will fall in step with i know what i want. if not then i honestly belive no matter how much it may hurt that the path i take will lead to what is right for ME.

the jist of it: i know that im not ready for a relationship and wont be for awhile. i want to learn and love the person i grow into enough to not let the person im with change me for the worse. or make me feel emberassed to be who i am. i want to be a confidant woman who can change for my partner but not just because they want me to but because i want to. to be able to get down the dance of our relationship, which takes time and ALOT of patients, so we can enjoy the life we create with each other. the good the bad and all the inbetween. to be able to know before i fall asleep next to them that i love and cherish the person im with even if they make me crazy. 

sn: all of my relationships are love/hate relationships and i think that all good ones are. lol. how do you know you love the person you re with unless they make you mad and crazy to the point where you want to smack um but the knowledge that you love them more then all the crazy to be like ""alright i love i wont hurt you, but i really want to"" lol
did i mention im crazy to begin with.


ugh i hopp around too much in my writing i apologize but at the time of writing and thinking it all makes sense to me."

"event","so i ve been stuck in a rut. im always bored but to lazy to go do anything. plus the idea or rather the fact that you need some ammount of money to do ANYTHING makes not even want to really try. im tired of always being bored and because im always bored and stuck in the cycle of basically doing nothing but exhist i dont make much if any attempt at doing anything with my life right now. i just dont know what i want to do with the rest of my summer and am sadened that ive wasted most of it sleeping. i hate that i hate i do that when im depressed. and when i stop to think about it i have no real reason to be depressed. i live with my brother and sister in law who basically pay for everything i dont have a job,though i KNOW i severaly need one, and i have a car that works just fine. why am i such a loser i hate this. im hoping i stay in my wanting need to change it all because monday im going to look for a job with the excuse of getting up early being that i HAVE to pay my credit card (with money my mom gave me, ugh.). i hate feeling like my life is wasting away and that im not accomplishing anything. and the fact that im not smart enought nor brave enough to go after the things i want in life. 
i also hate that i got a 22 on my ACT, damnit! im soo concieted (whatev) but i thought i would do better then that. i hate that im average.
the thing i hate the most is that my life is going to suck. that im not going to be able to travel the way i hoped. that im not going to even be able to dream about to the schools i wanted to go to. that im going to be stuck at sonic my entire life. that im always going to be average. and lastly that im going to die alone in my house with a cat as my only companion. that after not being feed for day and no one coming to find me or feed him itll start to eat ME! lol or that ill go crazy and just kill myself. minus the going crazy part."

its going to be hard to be around him with out kissing him. we have somewhat of a problem with that even though we both know we shouldnt anymore. ugh all his stuff is still here. well the few things he wantd to leave here. i guess its good that he hasnt asked to come get it? or maybe he knows im a loser and dosent want to seem mean by asking for it back and instead just wants to wait till i ask him to come get it. but i suppose thats good to, waiting till i say im ready. why do break ups have to suck so much?"

we spent hours in the pool and in the hot tub just joking around and being crazy. we even took a topless pic of us holding ourselves with our hands and our tops with our teeth. lol it was crazy cuz i didnt even realize that i flashed the other girls when i was trying to set up the shot. ugh crazy things happen when you get a bunch of girls together to bash on homosapiens of the male persuasion. it was alot of fun and i wished it could have lasted all night but people had to go home and do other things. *le sigh* but i appreciate the time we had. oh and we still plan to make shirts with Hate On Dick Day! for the girls and I Survived Hate On Dick Day for the few members of the male population who are not scumb. k tired of typing now.

"event","noting but doubts fill my mind and i dont ever really think they can be dis proven or forgotten. they will always plauge my mind and my heart. i fear nothing can be done now to really make me forget them. i keep going back and forth saying now thats not true that didnt happen but then maybe it did. could that be why this was said or why that was done? this makes it seem like my doubts are right and yet this makes me think im being spiteful and overthinking things i shouldnt, turning them into something more then they really are. i hate how distrusting i am in my relationships. how the smallest thing can make me doubt everything. but am i really so wrong when i find out that person is willing to tell me the ""truth"" only to see the holes in their ""truth"". but when i dont ask further quetions to find out if my doubts are true. ugh i keep going back and forth its my fault for not wanting to really talk about the problem to really resolve them to instead only be near him and when im with him to not care and even forget why i was doubtful in the first place. i need to better learn how to recongnize my fears as actuall possibilities and not forget them when hes near. to know that if i dont talk about my concers how can i ever hope for peace of mind.
im so confused and scattered in my thoughts i never really get anywhere i only think in circles and i hate myself for it.

but now he wants to MARRY so philipino chick who i trying to get into the coutry. she is his moms, roommates, sister and she asked his mom to ask him to do. oh and the only reason well i hope the only reason he i considering it is because her family is offering him 10,000 dollars to do it. he dosent realize this whole thing is like a four year process. not just a one year thing that he thinks it is. 
this obviously shows that he doesnt really want to be with that he was only with me because he doesnt like being alone. ""oh look theres tanya ill just do whatever with her until something better comes along. look money. yay? bye whats your name.""

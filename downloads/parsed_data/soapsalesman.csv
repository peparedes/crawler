Most of the time the restuarant isn't even busy. I just stand around. BUt i got paid today. $260 for 5 days of work is quite alright to me. 

When you get a job everything changes. You don't have time to do a lot and getting up at 7 to be work at 8 sucks. 
Basically all i think about all day is how much money i'll be making. I work a lot with this little old lady named Edith and she is soooooooo cute. What a cute little old women. 

Someone come see me or call me and well hang out. I'm off work and three and on saturdays and sundays. i have whisky inside a cermamic x-mas family singing its is hilarious.


I am also moving me lj to loserdust so who ever wants to be on my friends list better comment on this or your NOT ADDED!devilish cry of laughter!"

bjork that is how i feel exactly right now. Because my mom is a dumb cunt. I am grounded for being lazy, non-atheltic fag, and having bad grades. SWS can kiss my ass. I've had enough of there dumb hippie shit. Thank god for the summer. I'm going to visit ariel ""possibly maybe"" and getting a job so i can have money. I will be able to drive and hopefully have a car. And i also will be a junior next year. Which is extremely scaring because i will seem so old, but at the same time its a year closer to graduating. 

i also think i have schophinrea. When i was in the shower i heard whistling and it wouldn't stop. THen when i was laying in my bed i could hear people whistling and poking me. Maybe i'm imagining things but its real creepy."

there's no wrong way to fuck a girl with no legs
just tell her you love her as she's crawlin' away.
there's no wrong way to fuck a bitch with no faith.
now you'll never be sad again.

lovin' you are the two best things in a world that's skipping town.
reaching blind into the deepest mouth in the brownest place around.

there's something i miss in her cum stained lips.
so i get the first kiss before she takes the last bite.
genital outlaws in a positive way, and in everything bagel too.

getting strangeld by the junkie priest as the boys get stoned in school.
there's a knock at the door and your parents come in.
they thought you were a different girl.

so if you're alone when you're parents aren't home
and no one can see your incestuous tree.
no need to contain what the sparrows can say.
now you'll never be sad again.

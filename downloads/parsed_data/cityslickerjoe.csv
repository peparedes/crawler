"event","The big gay house definitely welcomes Oliver the beautiful kitty.  He is, as Scottly wrote, adorable.  But at first was very scared/shy.  Now he is coming out of his shell, and actually has been hanging out in the rest of the house now (ie the first floor, not only upstairs).  And the skinny little thing has been eating finally- very picky, but so cute- has to eat gerber chicken.  We'll get him to weigh at least 5 pounds I am sure.  And- so cute- he slept on Scot last night, then came downstairs this morning and slept on Charley while growling at the dogs :)

"event","Less contemplative today.  Just got contacted though.  By an uncle I have never met.  He is apparently the only other gay member of my family.  Turns out my notice to everyone to attend a rally in Lansing about Prop 2- aka Brining Light to Darkness- was forwarded to him via my father.    

He asked me to light a candle for him.  Since he lives in Cali- and cannot exactly make it here in time.  It sparked something in me.  He is 60-something, and I have never met him.  I only became aware of his existence within the last 5 years or so

He told me that since we wouldn't see equality in his time, that we need to work harder to see it in mine.  I can only imagine what he has gone thru in his days here.

Needless to say- as much as moving to Canada sounds good, it wouldn't help our sorry country.  Gawd- lets give bush hell- its his last four years.  Lets make it good!)

"event","Today, I received yet another email from my mom about god.  Which is odd for me.  She knows how little room I have in my heart for organized religion.  Yet I cannot tell out of exactly what spirit she sends this.  I know her well enough to assume that the email is meant in a plainly spiritual way, and not in connection with any certain religious cult... oops- that was out loud? I meant sect. 

I was reminded of a simple argument in logic against the catholic church's sytem of belief.

They purport that god is all good, all knowing and all powerful.  Yet evil still exists in this world.  If god is who the Catholic church says he is, than how can evil still exist?  It can't be both ways and here is why:

If god were truly all good, knowing and powerful, then evil would have been taken care of eons ago.

So god must only be able to embody two of those properties:

If he is all good and all knowing, then he is aware of evil, but doesn't have the power to do anything about it- this shows why he has allowed evil to exist.

If he is all good and all powerful, then he may well not be aware that evil exists- otherwise, he would have taken care of the demons.

And last if he is all powerful and all knowing, then he must not be all good.  If he were all good, then why do bad things (ie- evil) still appear?

This all being said, I still have that nagging sense that there is something out there.  What I cannot say for sure.  However, if it truly did create us and everything in the universe than it must have been D@MN powerful.  And if it created us with the brains and the knowledge to question its existence, than it must have been very intelligent indeed.  But  I cannot fathom any being that is completely good.  There are a very limited number of humans who fit that category(Mother Theresa, etc).  Why should any externally powerful/forceful deity be any different?  Because somebody wanted it to be.  Whoever came up with the idea in the first place.  I sincerely hope that whatever started things off is all good, but then it cannot be both of the remainders.  I struggle with this.

Spirituality is important to me.  I feel a strong tie to the earth, nature, the world around me.  But I cannot say I feel clued in to some higher being.  I guess I can find out later.

more later."

"event","A few years ago I was in a sense injected into the middle of a battle defining what constitutes family.  I still have not come up with a definite answer, except to say that family while important is not necessarily what we have all been programmed to think of.  Semi-recently, I came to the conclusion that family is made by choice, not by biology.

Case in point: Technically, all humans on this earth are related, through many branchings of a biological tree.  Those that we tend to call family are those that are within the last few branchings closest to us.  Grandparents, parents, aunts, uncles and cousins, siblings.  These are what we tend to see as our immediate/extended bio group.  However, a biological link with these people is one thing, and our emotional linkage with them is quite separate.  Specifically, the emotional bonds between biologically close individuals are made, not born.  I feel personalities are the reason for this, and that much of a persons personality is genuinely in-born, not necessarily learned.  

Needless to say, we all have those in our bio groups that we do not get along with, or who do not like others in the group.  At ""family"" gatherings- holidays, birthdays, weddings, etc, we all know that there are some people in this group that we will spend our time near, and others less, or not at all.  I have plenty of bio-related people in each group.  But my biological family is large.  My fathers side is nearly 60 and growing, and my mothers side is approximately 30 strong.  Hell, I still don't know all my cousins names in one family, but there are 9 of them within 16 years. 

Anyways, my main point being that emotional bonds are what tie us.  Emotional bonds are what creates the family.  If these are severed, the very definition of family could cease to exist in a philosophical sense.  And if so, does the family itself cease existing?  (think Renee' Descarte for those who know philosophy/logic studies)  As such, if we can cease the existence of one family, can we create the existence of another family?  I feel the only answer is yes.  

However, being gay makes its own set of problems to deal with.  Though my biogroup was in fact very supportive of who I am, I know many others whose ""family"" (used loosely) did not take things so well. My husband, or our roommate for example.

Now, things are better in my husbands family.  Slightly.  He only needed to sever the ties between his parents had hisself.  The rest of his family has always been loving and supportive.  Not that things were never strained between other members.  It gets ugly now and then, but amazingly they work through it.  Specifically, he and his brother had a horrible relationship for a long time.  And I could definitely understand it.  Acutally, I propably fed into it, as I could not stand the younger brother up until about a year ago.  

Recently, they began talking more civilly.  They began to realize that they are the only ones they have in this world.  The family was small to begin with.  Grandma and grandpa, an aunt and uncle (both married), and my partners two siblings. When the catastrophe struck nearly 5 years ago, the family was reduced by two.  Which it turns out was for the better.

But working back from all that anger, and hatred, and mistrust has not been easy.  For my partner, his brother or myself.

Now that they are working on being closer, as they should, I find myself working on trying to accept someone who I could barely accept early on.  But as I love my husband, I need to accept those who he holds close to himself, just as he does for me.  

I find some of what I know of his brothers past to be disturbing.  And I have a hard time with his crassness.  He is a wonderful young man, in a sense- he is quite supportive of us, hates the asshole in the whitehouse as much as we do, and is generally a nice guy.  However, growing up in a rural community left its mark on his speech.  There are times when nigger or other racial/ethnic comments are made that make my blood boil.  We have talked about this, and it is getting better.  He is crass, harsh and rude however.  This is tough to deal with.  But I have already seen him turn 180, and I know who he truly is.  I think it is much easier for him to deal with things in his manner at the moment.  I believe he copes how he does as the family fall-out began when he was only 18, nearing the end of high school.  This belief makes me hopeful for him.  

More later.  Thanks for reading this far, if you haven't fallen asleep yet:)  And as always- feel free to respond.  I am always curious what others have to say.

Anywho.  I reside in Michigan in a small town (under 800) called Dansville.  I moved here about 4 years ago with my husband to the farm he has lived on his entire life.  We share the house next door to his grandparents who are THE most amazing people in the world.  

Its crazy to see where people find acceptance, and who shows it to them.  But mostly its refreshing to find these things out.  Oh, and since I haven't put much up in the profile section yet, we are a gay couple in this small town.  Actually I am convinced there is something in the water out here- lots of gay people all over.  And though I grew up in detroit, i never knew anyone as openly gay until well after I graduated highschool.  Oh well- we all open our eyes at different times.

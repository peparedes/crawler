"event","so yesterday was ten years to the day that my grandma died. bloody april fools day bless her. had a lovely day remembering her by myself &amp; a little with my aunt [her sister] who i saw on the bus on the way to the crem &lt;3 

only downer was that grandma isn't in the book of rememberance, which she should be. gonna look into that over the weekend.

thanks for everything gran, ten years may be a long time, but never forgotten &lt;3"

"event","<br /><lj-cut>so i'm not even gonna bother not cutting any of this, as it just seems so pointless, but still.<br />since i hit my teens i have had a continous battle with my weight. when i was at high school, for some reason it bothered me, but it didn't. i could handle being the &quot;fat kid&quot; i guess because there were people who were being bullied more than i was. back then i was never told about any of the weight programmes that may [or may not] have been avaliable&nbsp;to me, so i just got on with it. i loved my food &amp; i overate, i guess sometimes i did&nbsp;comfort eat,&nbsp;but&nbsp;not cos&nbsp;people were bullying me about my weight, it got more out of control when my gran died. looking back, i can pinpoint that moment to my constant weight gain.<br />i guess&nbsp;as i got a little older at high school, it did bug&nbsp;me, but cos i never actually hung out with &quot;the cool, thin people&quot; [those who&nbsp;wore really skinny jeans etc] i just didn't really notice it. we only had one really skinny friend in our group so i didn't really know any different. obviously pe was tough, but i hid under baggy clothes.<br />now that i'm 22, my&nbsp;weight is still an issue for me, but it's never at the forefront of my mind, but a recent issue has made me realise it is time to knuckle down &amp; shed some of it, i do notice my weight more now &amp; i am horrified it got like&nbsp;this. at the beginning of week i decided to do something about it, i gave myself bank&nbsp;holiday monday off, &amp; started on tuesday &amp; since then have done&nbsp;ok.&nbsp;<br />however, a comment by my dad this morning really set me&nbsp;back. because of all my weight gain, i have&nbsp;stretchmarks,&nbsp;which i've got used to. anyway, this morning he brought them up when&nbsp;i lent over the chair &amp; my tshirt rode up. he was all&nbsp;like &quot;oh fran did you know you have stretchmarks&quot; he's always comments about my weight &amp; makes remarks, but he's hardly a role model to me. at least my mum actually bothers to&nbsp;try &amp; help me&nbsp;loose weight,&nbsp;she never makes rude comments, just suggests other things to me, like alternatives and stuff.&nbsp;<br />the last time this happened, i asked dad to back off &amp; at least offer me words of encouragement, but he's just&nbsp;the same as he ever was. i hate it =(<br /><br /></lj-cut>sorry about that, needed to come off my chest"

"event","today has been a total disaster. i don't even think i want to speak to lauren anymore, i want to resolve things, but everytime i try &amp; explain the way she is she twists things around &amp; like makes me feel really guilty &amp; stuff. it's weird &amp; tbh really hard to talk about. the more&nbsp;she pushes me away &amp; makes me feel shit, the more i just want to try so fucking hard to make it worse. if anyones seem mean girls, it's a bit like the relationship between gretchen &amp; regina. really bad example but you know. 

i've been on my own all day. mum &amp; dad went to the home to see leslie &amp; i still can't bring myself to go, i don't think he has much longer left to live but it's so hard to go there. it's that hard, that i haven't visited him in the home since he got there. thats so bad =(
rus was at his girlfriends all day so i've been all by myself, there's not been much happening on the msn front &amp; most of my friends where elsewhere today. it's horrible to be on your own when you feel like crap as well &amp; makes you think twice as long &amp; twice as hard. i haven't cried today but i think i'm about to.

we drove past the road leading to the crem where my gran's funeral took place today. i wanted to go up but we were in a hurry to get rus back for his work shift, i still feel so bad that we weren't there on thursday.

"event","<br />my life is in serius need of a makeover. something somewhere has gone wrong with me &amp; i don't like. i haven't posted an lj entry in forever, i'm extremely lazy, i can't be bothered with life &amp; i feel like i'm slipping away from friends. namely lauren [who i most definately do not want to loose] &amp; a couple of lj-ers. i want to reconnect with them as well as sort myself out properly. <br /><br />i'll start with the basics. in recent weeks &amp; months i felt increasingly down, cried a lot at really pathetic things [&amp; serious also], my appetite is so up &amp; down at the moment &amp; i'm eating at funny times of the day or not at all, yet no weight is coming off or going on me. it occured to me, that i might be suffering from some sort of depression, so i had a look &amp; some of the symptoms fit. i'm not sure what kind yet, maybe SAD, or even minor, but whatever it is, it's making me think about harming myself again which is bad &amp; i totlally know i have to get over it. i don't want to be this way anymore, but when i'm like this i overthink things. trouble is though, there are times when i'm like really happy, like over silly things when i talk to people, when my best mate came back from uni &amp; when i'm at work &amp; getting on with management. i don't know if it's whats happened recently regarding my job. i should probably explain that.<br /><br /><lj-cut>basically. about two months ago my boss said that i needed tp up my game at work &amp; that i was on an &quot;unrecorded verbal warning&quot; if she didn't see improvement in say a week, i'd be on an actual verbal warning that could go on record &amp; stuff. anyway, about three weeks after that she spoke to me about something i hadn't done right at work, but never told me it was the official verbal warning, so a few weeks later when she issued me with an informal warning sheet i was like wtf?! anyway, she said it was something to be concerned about, but also not to worry about it. i had four weeks to improve the things we agreed on &amp; that if things were no different, the official disciplinaries would start. <br /></lj-cut><br />personally, me &amp; another work colleague who i'm close to outside of work, both said that we think they're out to fire someone &amp; because i am a little sloppy with my job, i'm the target. there was another incident regarding a microwave too that i think could have got me fired if it was my fault [which it wasn't] but i won't go into that now.<br />i think a lot of this &quot;depressive state&quot; was started by everything that happened at work, yet my bosses have this way of making me feel happy when they're not pissed off with me. if that makes any sense. it's only when i get home &amp; talk to my parents that i realise that maybe i am being kicked down &amp; pushed around by them. my dad says there's no way i shouold be a poushover but thats the way i've always been. someone says bark like a dog &amp; i'll do it =/<br /><br />i've also being missing my gran a lot recently. she died a year ago yesterday &amp; prior to yesterday i'd had a talk with mum about how i felt. i never realised that nine years on it could still fucking hurt like hell. i don't think i ever got over the death of my grandma &amp; it pains me to say that i only thought about her twice yesterday. dad didn't even mention her to me which i thought he would, there was no visit to the crem, just me alone with my thoughts &amp; driving myself mad. i miss her so much cos there were so many things i wanted to share with her, like my gcse &amp; a level results, &amp; daft things like getting on a bus straight after school to go &amp; spend time with her. i reckon she'd be the one i'd be talking to about all this now as well, cos regardless of her relationship with my parents, she'd always have the time to talk to me &amp; keep my secrets. if i could be half the person she was, i know i'd have achieved something with my life.<br /><br />i have a sudden urge to learn too. i was supposed to be looking at courses months ago, but never seemed bothered, but all of a sudden i want to learn, i want to travel &amp; try new things. the problem is the job &amp; the money, i'm not even earning 70 quid a week atm. everyone keeps telling me to get another job but it's so hard &amp; time consuming.<br /><br />i have so many plans, yet no idea which direction i'm going in. i feel like i'm going at a hundred miles an hour sometimes, yet i'm stuck in the mud &amp; the wheels just spinning with no way of escape. i wish i dealt with things easily, which is why i'm going to attempt to sort things out. i'm sick of feeling sad all the time &amp; my brother has offered to come to the doctors to see if i can try &amp; get something for it &amp; clear the crap away for good this time."

She's watching it again!&quot; LOL! I don't care though. I&nbsp;really love the storyline&nbsp;between Ronnie &amp; Danielle&nbsp;atm, just praying&nbsp;it&nbsp;comes out soon though, t'will be one of these episodes that goes&nbsp;down in Eastenders history me thinks &amp; not just because it's dragged on xD It's though of Danielle just finally&nbsp;coming out of her shell &amp; yelling&nbsp;to Ronnie &quot;You're my mum!&quot; &amp; Ronnie &amp; Jack are so adorable too &lt;3&nbsp;<br /><br />Also loving Being Human. I missed the pilot last year &amp; I wasn't that bothered until I went to The Hub &amp; someone mentioned it. I thought, ooo, sounds like something I'd like &amp; I do. It's different, &amp; scripted in an odd way but I'm really enjoying it. Feel really sorry for Anne though =( &amp; trying to work Mitchell out makes my brain hurt loads xD<br /><br />I finally got my iPod working after two nights of yelling at it &amp; trying hard not to throw it at the wall! It's so easy to use, yet I was making it harder. &amp; all of a sudden it's like &quot;LOADS&nbsp;OF&nbsp;SPACE&nbsp;FOR&nbsp;CHUNEZZZZ!&quot; =P Good times.<br /><br />I am so sick of snow too, &amp; work, not the creche but the bakery. Gah I wish they'd just fuck off sometimes, luckily Ronnie's back this week so I'll have someone on my wavelength again, I missed her tonnes.<br /><br />I finally gave up with Breaking Dawn, it got silly in my eyes. I'll probably pick it up again in a few months or so but for now it has a permanant home in my drawer. Twilight was groundbreaking, the rest a little meh. I'm reading the new Belle De Jour one now.<br /><br />Need to start savingggg. There's a stack of stuff I want to do this year including Cardiff,&nbsp;NTA's, The Hub 2, Oliver!, Dreamboats &amp; Petticoats, Robin Hood &amp; I still owe mum for the John Barrowman concert. We'll get there =)<br /><br />Hope everyone is well x<br /><br />"

"event","<br />Sorry about the double post &amp; spam-age, the LJ cut is confusing me =[ Just click the links till you get the full post on the previous entry.<br /><br /><lj-cut text=""JB'ness &lt;333333""><font style=""background-color: #d2d2d2"">After being in Birmingham for most of the day &amp; spending so much time on our feet we were delighted when we were finally allowed to go into the theatre!<br />I always find the best part about going to the pantomine is the anticipation before the show starts, you have the High School Musical soundtracks playing, kids getting excited &amp; the stage&nbsp;curtain reads the name of the panto you're seeing &amp; about ten minutes&nbsp;before it did start they played pictures of the Merry Men out.&nbsp;&amp; then when the announcer tells you the panto is about to start &amp; the conducter issues the band to start&nbsp;the butterflies start. Or at least in my case thats what happens &amp; has done since I was small.<br />In my opinion, the opening wasn't&nbsp;as strong as Aladdin had been, when Aladdin started they began with a&nbsp;well known upbeat&nbsp;song, I didn't know what the song was &amp;&nbsp;I caught sight of one of the kids faces&nbsp;to the other side of me who was sort of confused, but I loved how Marion didn't like Robin at the beginning &amp; then grew to love&nbsp;him, practically the same as the BBC series &lt;3&nbsp;<br />As you always get with John the script was full of innuendo&nbsp;that&nbsp;all the adults &amp; Torchwood fans just went crazy for [John told us to calm down so much!] &amp; also there&nbsp;were the Who references for the kids. One&nbsp;of the Merry Men was gay&nbsp;[or at least acted camp!] &amp; I'm pretty sure was trying to &quot;outgay&quot;&nbsp;John in real life too, if that makes any sense! Will Scarlett was&nbsp;adorable &amp; very funny, played by a&nbsp;ventriliquist who had a very&nbsp;sexually active puppet &amp; kept picking on this&nbsp;amazing guy Andy&nbsp;who was sat in the audience xD I&nbsp;might buy his live DVD when I go next time becuase he was really good. The plot was you're usual mix of jokes, love, bad guys&nbsp;&amp; freaky alien things that really shouldn't be there xD &amp; as the story progressed I found&nbsp;myself enjoying it more than Aladdin. I think that was because John &amp; Helen had so much&nbsp;more chemistry than his co-star last year. &amp; JOHN&nbsp;SKATED! &lt;333333 So,&nbsp;pictures, all of three xD<br /><br />Pulling daft faces before the performance, I was admiring John's bum on the poster opposite us xD<br /></font>&nbsp;<a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/fransta_oddbean/pic/000087yf/""><img height=""240"" width=""320"" border=""0"" alt="""" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/fransta_oddbean/pic/000087yf/s320x240"" /></a><br /><br />I actually adore this photo of the two of us. I don't see as much&nbsp;of my best mate as I used&nbsp;to &amp; we took ages perfecting the picture [believe&nbsp;me there were some really dodgy ones xD]<br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/fransta_oddbean/pic/00009s5y/""><img height=""240"" width=""320"" border=""0"" alt="""" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/fransta_oddbean/pic/00009s5y/s320x240"" /></a><br /><br /><br />&amp; finally me &amp; teh Barrowman &lt;333333 The hatttttttttttt xD<br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/fransta_oddbean/pic/0000ae60/""><img height=""240"" width=""320"" border=""0"" alt="""" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/fransta_oddbean/pic/0000ae60/s320x240"" /></a><br /><br />I'm pleased with the choice of new Doctor, he seems a little wacky &amp; his hair is a little... odd xD I had no idea who he was until they played the clips I was like &quot;OMG! JIM!!!!&quot; &amp; a [sort of] Who connection with the Billster. Will miss DT immensely though =[<br />&nbsp;</lj-cut>"

His mind seems to slowly be going, though he remembers us &amp; such but he forgets little things, making me wonder whether or not he's in the first stages of Alzheimers [sp?] Anyway, he forgot to get my nan a card <em>or </em>present &amp; she gets upset about those little things &amp; my mum ended up consoling her over the phone before she even got here =/ There was a lot of quiet &amp; awkward moments between us &amp; them too. <br />Then, I got home today, rang the doorbell &amp; dad sort of stromed to the door, opened it &amp; walked off.

"event","<br />So, remember all that crap I had with Amy a few months back, well she contacted me again &amp; this time I actually felt as if I could talk to her. She's still badgering on about her panto ticket &amp; wants to meet me in town to retrieve it but I refuse because I still don't think I trust her. Mind you, at least we're talking over Facebook now which is a major improvement. She keeps saying all of these things &amp; I don't know how to take them, one minute she seems fine with me, the next minute she making petty remarks about previous messages. &amp; she seems pretty depressed. Unless it's the sympathy vote? Anyway, I decided to stop being a bitch &amp; &quot;do what the Doctor would do&quot; so&nbsp;I've taken the moral high ground &amp; said that the ticket was always hers [small white lie but I was <em>really </em>annoyed with her before!] She has the details &amp; we'll arrange some other stuff when the time is closer, all she has to do is show up *shrugs* Ball's in her court now...<br /><br />I am once again alone in the house. I seriously have no life, but maybe I like it that way. Most people seem offended when they meet me &amp; discover what I'm like anyway &amp; my closest mates &amp; LJ mates have just got used to me, or at least I think they have xD I don't drink a lot, I always try not to touch drugs [although mates around me have done them] &amp; I don't socially smoke, most people think I'm boring &amp; actually I suppose I think the same about them. They're all the same around here, I need to live somewhere that doesn't breed clones all over the place *rolls eyes*<br /><br />I started Weightwatchers 5 weeks ago! &amp; so far I've lost 5 &amp; a half pounds [but put a pound on tonight!] Sometimes I struggle cos I relied on crap food for so long &amp; then I see pictures of woman who are thin but also have amazing curves &amp; I think, thats my goal! which usually spurs me on again. I go with mum's friend so I have a shoulder to lean on if I need to &amp; we decided that we can indulge on Christmas Eve, Christmas Day &amp; Boxing Day but get straight back on track afterwards.<br /><br />Speaking of Christmas, I'm all shopped out, wrapped up &amp; nearly all sent. I have my managers to hand over tomorrow &amp; then I think thats it! Finally! LOL! Doesn't feel much like Christmas this year, I really don't know why, possibly because a month after I'll be 21 &amp; actually properly beginning my 20's as a &quot;real&quot; adult. Scary thought xD<br /><br />Anyway, I hope you're all ok &amp; life is treating you well. I do read your entries but being a busy season I haven't replied. I am an awful person &amp; I'm sorry. I'll do better in 2009 I swear it =D Love to all x"

The doctor has provided me with a sick note, so that I can have a little time off work to see whether or not this skin rash heals &amp; so far it is, which, although it pleases me in terms of it's going, it's kind of bad cos I think I'm allergic to something at work. At the risk of contradicting myself though, I don't actually want to leave. Well, I do, but not till I find another job. Hopefully *crosses everything* I can secure me a place at the Birmingham Hippodrome which I'm fully into the process of applying for, it will probably only be part time, but thats how I started at Cooks, only to be moved onto full time about a year into my job.

I also have tickets to go &amp; see John Barrowman in concert next year. I couldn't go last year because he was doing Birmingham [xD , so immature!] on mum's birthday, but mum managed to get us really good seats last night =D I know mum doesn't like him much but it'll be a chance for us to bond over something I suppose, besides, she may even end up liking him. I've heard tonnes about his concerts last year, mainly positive &amp; how he has such stage charisma &amp; I'm so excited ^_^

Doctor Who<br />3. Heroes<br />4. Hollyoaks<br />5. Torchwood<br />6. Primeval</p><p><br />&nbsp;1. Who is your favorite character from #2? <br />Jackie Tyler xD<br />&nbsp;</p><p>2. Who is your least favourite character from #4?<br />Dom Reiley *rolls eyes*<br />&nbsp;</p><p>3. What would a crossover between #1 and #5 include?<br />&nbsp;The Torchwood team travelling to LA to meet the mysterious Mick St John &amp; uncover the dodgy dealings of Josef xD &amp; maybe Beth questionning her relationship with Beth when she gets down &amp; dirty with Ianto Jones... yea, RTD should hire me xD</p><p>4. What is your favourite ship from #6 <br />Abby/Connor, but I'm starting to get Cutter/Claudia &amp; also Cutter/Jenny =D<br />&nbsp;</p><p>5. If you were to set one person from #3 and one person from #6 on a blind date, who would they be? <br />From 6 it would deffo be Jenny, &amp; from 3 I think Nathan might be good for her? <br />&nbsp;</p><p>6. If you could meet one person from #4 and spend the day with them, who would it be, and what would you do? <br />Zoe Lister, for maximum wine drinkage xD<br /><br />7. If you could change one thing about #2's plot line, what would you change? <br />Only one? Maybe that Donna stayed with Ten at the end of Journey's End, because she turned out to be awesome<br />&nbsp;</p><p>8. Explain a relationship between two people (not necessarily romantic) from show #5, and why you like the relationship between them.<br />Gwen &amp; Jack, as a friendship. Cos at the end of the day whatever happens they will always forgive one another &lt;3<br />&nbsp;</p><p>9. If the lead title characters (first name in the credits) from #1 and #3 were both drowning, and you could only save one, who would it be?<br />Jesus xD Well, Mick is immortal anyway, &amp; none of the Heroes gang are main cast, buuuuut I'd save Peter, see tonights BBC Three ep for more information...<br />&nbsp;</p><p>10.If you wereable to add a new character, any kind of character you wanted, to the storyline for #6, what would the character be like, and what would their role be?<br />Ermmm. Maybe a proper scienetist person, or a forensic. I dunno why though =/<br />&nbsp;</p><p>11. What happens in your favourite episode of show #2? <br />All the companions get together to save the Doctor, kick Dalek ass &amp; blow Davoros to smitherins. &amp; also Donna loses her memories =(<br />&nbsp;</p><p>12. If you could kill off one of the characters in #1, who would it be and how would you do it?<br />Jesus, their all immortal bar Beth &amp; I like her =( ooooo! That dude! The one who had the vampire list right at the end of the season, &amp; Josef would do it *nods*<br />&nbsp;</p><p>13. If you got the chance to visit the set for either show #3 or show #5, which would you choose?<br />You evil peoplesssss! But I think ultimately, I'd want to visit the Hub, despite the fact that I'd get to go to America otherwise<br /><br />14. If you could date anyone from any of these shows, which show and which person? <br />Torchwood's Rhys &lt;3 cos Gwen seems to do all of the cheating &amp; I want her to suffer for a change xD<br /><br />15. If you could change the role of one character in show #1, who would it be and what would you change?&nbsp;<br />I know I will be cursed for this [cos she is an incredible villian] but I'd have Coralinne become a good guy &amp; then Mick, Logan, her &amp; Josef could become one big kick ass vampire army to protect LA.<br />&nbsp;</p></lj-cut>Duuuuuuuude! How frickin' amazing was Heroes on BBC Three tonight?! &amp; Claire &amp; Peter are kicking ass again together. This makes me freakishly happy &lt;3"

Even my ex-manager doesn't seem to want to talk to me, &amp; Maxine only speaks to me cos she's worried she'll lose her job if she stays reclusive. I still like the people I work with, but there seems to be a &quot;group&quot; being formed again [just like the Amy/Maxine/Shell one before] I feel that the only person I can talk to in that place &amp; be completely honest with is Ronnie these days. She never judges me &amp; tbh I think she feels the same about me. We share everything that bothers us with each other &amp; she'll let me know if there's any bitching going on. It's really hard to believe she's more than 30 years older than I am. I'm sick of my hours being cut. I know I wanted them cut but I only wanted like an extra day off or something, yet I've earnt <span style=""font-size: x-small"">30 </span><span style=""font-size: larger""><span><span style="""">pounds less than I normally do. &amp; people seem to be getting the time off they want after I've asked &amp; tried to neogotiate [sp?] to have it off. I actually had somewhere booked, but noooooooo the &quot;special bunch&quot; get top priority. I don't think I mean to bitch but I'm mad at my brother, I put false nails on my mum &amp; got the glue all over my&nbsp;habds which won't come off, &nbsp;I have PMT, I feel sick for no reason &amp; I have a headache that I'm making worse by listening to loud music &amp; shouting at my brother. I didn't have a very good day at work either, 4 hour shifts make me groggy cos there's nothing to do in the afternoons so I was made to do some heavy cleaning. I desperately need a new job but the reality is it's so hard to get one right now that it doesn't seem worth trying. Urgh, I'm bringing myself further down</span></span></span>&nbsp;&amp; acting like my life is so hard when really it isn't, I just need some perspective.<br />Nan gave me a newspaper cutting with a childcare training group on it, so I might find some time to have a look later on. It's got to be better than the crap I have a work now, anything would be better than putting up with that. <br /><br />Bah, after that rant I could do with some chocolate... appologies for going on =/<br /><br />On the plus side, I've had a letter confirming the Torchwood con, my new bag came &amp; I got my Superman/girl/woman/dude xD tshirt. However, I am sending my new phone straight back! I'm not going into it because I'll start another rant &amp; bore you all over again. &amp; I finished Primeval series 2 re-watch [minus episode 3 cos it bores me...] I think next series, aside from focussing on the new characters &amp; aftermath of Stephens death, might well see Abby &amp; Con together, finally! &lt;3<br /><br />Well, that's about it, sorry to have banged on though I do feel miles better than when I first started the entry =) Really don't want to go to work tomorrow, but I'll have something hyperactive-inducing before I start, try &amp; make the ill-feeling go away.<br /><br />Much love x"

"event","<br />Hola! =D<br /><br />So, I have calmed down from last night &amp; for once I am grinning like an idiot. I'm off to The Hub [Torchwood Convention] in just under two weeks. I need some time off work, it's beginning to bug me &amp; I guess Amy was right, my new manager can be a pain. Saturday was just too busy. I came in late &amp; she gave me evils, but then the new assistant manager was nearly half an hour lae &amp; she was fine with her. So I was a bit pissed off. I only worked till 4 though, I'm grateful I didn't have to do any cleaning up cos I was so shattered. I decided to get my top ear pierced after work on a whim. I had wanted it done for a while but after numerous horror stories about ears swelling &amp; pain I'd been kind of put off, especially as I don't have a very high pain threshold xD But I decided if I was ever going to have it done, it needed to be then<lj-cut text=""So...""><img alt="""" src=""http://i3.photobucket.com/albums/y88/Fransta/DSC00082.jpg"" /><br /><br />Excuse the bad quality, it was taken with my phone as the camera was playing up *rolls eyes*<br />&nbsp;</lj-cut><br />I've also decided [in the words of Cady Harron in Mean Girls] to suck the poison out of my life. So I'm cutting Amy out of my life. I tried to get her to meet up with me on Friday, but she refused claiming that everything had already been said &amp; done. I won't delete her from my phone book yet, or Facebook for that matter. I don't know why &amp; it's hardly sticking to my guns, but I am breaking all contact with her. She was dragging me down to her level &amp; quite often bought out the worst in me.The irony is&nbsp;that we did have fun in the process *rolls eyes*<br /><br />&amp; also does anyone use Paypal, cos I could really use a little help if anyone can offer some advice?"

Work was so pointless today, I did three hours of nothing. &amp; I'm not sure my new assistant manager likes me tbh. We didn't talk much, only when other people were with us. It's only the first day though so we'll see.

The course is going fine &amp; I'm really enjoying it. We did all work today, although we did do some cutting &amp; sticking which was a good laugh. My folder's actually starting to look full now though =D

Anyway, will catch up with you all later.

I was only supposed to work an 8-2 shift today, but the assistant manager didn't show up so I had to work till 5 =( At least I had a dinner hour today though! &amp; I have tomorrow off, my course on Wednesday morning, three hours in the afternoon &amp; then only 4 hours on Friday, it's quite a nice week tbh. 
Speaking of work, it's a customers son's birthday in a couple of weeks &amp; I'm taking them both to the Sealife Center. I couldn't think of anything to get for him, &amp; so I figured I'd pay for him to go &amp; buy him something there. &amp; plus, it's a chance to visit my childhood xD&nbsp;He was being so lovely today &amp; wanted some attention, so I snatched five minutes to pick him up &amp; tickle him. I dote on that child &amp; all my colleagues tell me off =P 

I was completely baffled by the Strictly result on Sunday! I know it was likely that Gillian would be first off, but I guess I'm a bit miffed cos Anton never has the chance to progress too far as he's always given &quot;the older lady&quot; Mum says it's because he's so patient but meh. Hopefully next year he'll get someone younger who can push =D Still in love with the V-Man &lt;3 

I saw Adam today =D I'm always sooo nervous around him &amp; I know there's no need to be, we're going for some dinner on Wednesday evening so I shall keep you all posted. Gahhhh I have butterflies thinking about it already xD

Meh &lt;_&lt; We'll be getting the new assistant manager next week too...

Strictly has got really intense all of a sudden, &amp; people are coming out of the woodwork who I wasn't sure would do so well! I &lt;3 Vincent Simone!

"event","So as you may have noticed, I've added a different layout [I've actually had this one before] I loved my other one, but I figured it's time for a change for a while, cos sometimes, change isn't all bad =D

Life seems to be going my way at the moment. I'm starting to feel that the issue connected to work has faded [I've never spoken about it, but lets just say I'd need several LJ cuts!] &amp; I generally feel happier. I've started my Lighthouse Project course &amp; so far so good. I won't be qualified at the end of it, but I've got something to start over again with, plus I think it'll be yet another confidence boost =)

I'm so glad Strictly Come Dancing is back *grins like a geeky loon* Not quite sure who I'll be backing, but Vincent needs some love this year &amp; Rachel seems [so far] to showing signs of potential. I'm not really sure about the girls this year though, there was so much hype &amp; some amazing dancers last year that I'm not sure they'll match them. In fact, I think a lot of the boys have more potential than the girls this year. &amp; John is soooo much better than people first thought! I think, I'm leaning towards Rachel &amp; Vincent, Cherie &amp; James, Mark &amp; Hayley and Tom &amp; Camilla, so we'll see how they pan out over the next few weeks. &amp; I hope Anton gets some love this year too! He's not had too much luck previously!

Anyone catch Merlin? I had to laugh. I'd read an interview with Eve Myles about two hours before I sat down to watch it &amp; she said 'People won't recognise me, I'm a witch' &amp; I though, of fair enough, &amp; then right at the beginning of the show, this woman started talking in obvious Welsh tones &amp; I was in stitches. Cue odd looks from my dad *rolls eyes* She was amazing though. A complete change from her Torchwood role. &amp; it wasn't too bad at all. Little cheesy, but cheese is always good!

I wish Adam would text me though =(

PS: I'm off to see Mamma Mia again this week, probably a sing-along. Well, you've got to haven't you? *giggles*"

"event","For starters I apologise for the emo-ness of this entry. I'm feeling kinda strange tonight &amp; I have the feeling you get when your sinus' hurt when you have a cold, but it's like making me want to cry, if you understand me. I don't know why I'm upset tbh. I guess there's a lot happening &amp; changing in my life right now &amp; I'm confused about where I'm going &amp; what I'm doing. 

Today I was re-offered the chance to act a manager for the company for three days while the manager &amp; assistant manager had clashing holidays. I didn't want to do it to begin with, I outright said no way based on some information that I didn't have [ie: how to do it] &amp; also that my assistant manager warned me it wasn't such a good idea &amp; my manager shouldn't really have asked me. But they're really desperate &amp; besides, it's kind of a cool challenge really. We'll have another manager from another shop come in &amp; do all the banking of the money. I just have to be in a hour earlier than usual, open &amp; close the shop &amp; sort out change for the tills, I'm sure I'll be ok. But when I told some of the other staff, they weren't too happy about a 20 year old being above them =/ I doubt many of them bar a couple, will be very supportive. There's an awful lot of sneaky game playing at work atm, regarding holidays, days off &amp; hours &amp; a lot of people who I used to really love &amp; look up to are starting to come out of their shells. It saddens me to think that these people were once so lovely. In a strange way, I think this might be why I'm upset. 

I've also come to realise that I miss loads of people. I know we can never go back to the way we were at school, but I can't help but feel that I'll always feel younger than my friends because I am a simple person &amp; small things make me smile, like they do for a child. This was addressed when I met up with a few old friends recently. I really miss my ex-best mate too. Since her boyfriend came into her life, I've seen her like three times? As I typed, she's my ex-best friend now, possibly only just a face I know. It's amazing to think we were once so close.&nbsp; 

Maybe this is me growing up, but it can't be because it's so painful. I haven't even cried once today, I think I welled up a bit just before dinner but I won't let myself cry properly&nbsp;in fear I'll show my emotions [which is also unlike me, I cry all the time] I know it's not that time of the month even. I just wish I knew what was wrong. 

&amp; it doesn't help that one of Belle's blogs had me close to tears too =("

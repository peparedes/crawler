"event","Lately for some reason I have been thinking a lot about the past and some of the times when I was truly at my happiest.  Sometimes I really wish I could go back and experience it again.  The first time I would go back to is my senior year of high school.  That is when I was still at boarding school in CT.  Even though I had my share of downs that year, that is truly the year when I completely pulled myself together.  In the past years before I had been broken down and made to think that I was a complete and worthless piece of trash.  This was done mostly by people who sometimes seemed like that had nothing better to do but bring me down.  Hell some of it was done by people who were suppose to be my friends (I don't talk to any of them today nor to I want to).  When I first got sent to live at Grove it CT, that sure changed.  I was still picked on a little, but nothing even close to what I was use too.  When I became a senior, it seemed like for the first time in years, maybe ever, I was truly happy.  I had lots of great friends at school and at home.  I was doing very well in school and actually doing stuff outside of school, not laying around like a lump.  For once I had confidence in myself.  I would do August of 1999 to August of 2000 over again in a second.  Another time I really miss is right before I was sent off to school.  I really miss spending my time hanging out in Bogota with Chris, Nicole, Vinny, Allison, Pat, Tony (back when he was still Tommy) and even Koenig and Lee Ann.  I really miss doing nothing in The park on Queen Ann Road, hanging out in Nicole's basement or Allison's living room.  When they threw me a going away party on New Years Eve, I knew that these people were some of the best people around.  Even after all we have gone through, I still love all of them for how happy they made me feel.  Even though most night we did not do much to remember, I will remember those days until the end of my time."

"event","Time for the usual scarce update.

This week is the last week at my current CVS.  Next week I go back to the CVS up the block for mine.  My brother got promoted to assistant manager and got transferred to mine.  Since I am still a Shift, I cannot work underneath him so I am going back to his store.  And that is fine with me.  I like my manager but he is getting a little nuts with the amount of work he gives me.  He expected me to finish redoing our entire vitamins plano in one day.  I expect that he never did that plano himself cause with one person doing it, it sure as hell doesn't take one day.  Plus I still would have to take calls and ring up customers.  I actually stayed an hour late on Sunday to finish it.  He better appreiate that cause I have been off for the last two day and could have just said fuck it and leave it for him.  Oh well, four more days.

Tara is sick right now.  I was hoping to see here this week, but since she is sick, that would happen.  Get better sweetheart, I will see you next week.  I love you.

I love Fluff.  It is the great sandwich thing ever made.  Today I had a peanut butter, jelly, and fluff sandwich.  It was awesome.

I am currently watching Trading Spouses n Fox.  Reality shows usual suck in my eyes, but I don't know why this one hooked me.  I think this is the first time I watched it.  At least this episode rocks.

I am bidding on a new web cam on ebay.  I can't find the disk to reinstall this one, so I figured why not try and get a better one.  This one is still only at 10 bucks but there is still 5 days to go.

"event","So yeah time for an actually update.

I found out the other day that one of my poems ""The Light at the End of the Tunnel"" is going to be published.  You can read it if you scroll down some.  I'm pumped.  I just entered a poetry contest for shits and giggles.  I never though that I would be in a poetry book.  Ya for me.

Work still sucks.  The other supervisor at my job is a dick.  I never seem to have enough help or time to get my work done.  How am I suppose to scan 30 trays, most very full of crap, and 20 boxes over overstock onto out overstock wall when I have to be back up cashier and do photo for half the time I am there?  My manager never seems to under stand that though.  I'd like to see him do all of that.

I still love Tara.  I miss her a lot since I didn't get to see her last week.  I should see her on Tuesday.  I love you Tara.

Earlier this week I probably did my most insane working schedule ever.  On Sunday I worked 12-9:30.  Then I got about 4 hours of sleep and worked 7:30-2.  I got home at 2:30, went to sleep at 4, slept for 3 and a half hours and then finally went back to work, this time at my brothers job, at 10:30PM and worked overnight until 7 the next morning.  I got home at like 7:30 and did various crap and took a two hour nap.  Why would I only sleep two hours after all that?  Because I had to be at work at 7:30 the next morning.  I was actually scheduled to work until 4:30 but I went home at 3 cause I got pretty sick.  Man I am never ever doing that again.  33 hours in three days is way to much for me.  Well, if it was only three shifts it would not have been that bad.  But 4 shifts in three days is too much.

I got another tattoo on Tuesday.  I got the letters sXe put on my right shoulder.  For those who don't know that means Strait Edge.  For me it means no drugs, no alcohol, no smoking, and no cutting.  Guess this means I'm in it for life.  Cool.

Every person who likes chocolate should try the new Brownie Batter Blizzard from Dairy Queen.  I had one today and it rocks.

I think I am gonna make a metal/hardcore rock CD of my favorite bands now.  I will most the track listing on here when I finish it."

"event","George W. Bush 
The White House, USA 

Past Work Experience 

I ran for U.S. Congress and lost. 
I produced a Hollywood slasher B movie. 
I bought an oil company, but couldn't find any oil in Texas; the 
company went bankrupt shortly after I sold all my stock. 
I bought the Texas Rangers baseball team in a sweetheart deal that took land using taxpayer money. 
With my father's help and name, I was elected Governor of Texas. 

Accomplishments as Governor

made Texas the most polluted state in the Union. 
I replaced Los Angeles with Houston as the most smog-ridden city in America. 
I cut taxes and bankrupted Texas government to the tune of billions in borrowed money. 
I set the record for the most executions by any Governor in American history. 
I became U.S. President after losing the popular vote by over 
500,000 votes with the help of major Enron money and my father's appointments to the Supreme Court. 

Accomplishments as President 

I attacked and overtook two countries.

My record for environmental issues is the least of my concerns. 
I am the first president in U.S. history to enter office with a criminal record. 
I set the all-time record for most days on vacation in any one year period. 
After taking-off the entire month of August, I then presided over 
the worst security failure in U.S. history. 
I am supporting development of a ""Tactical Bunker Buster"" nuke, a WMD. 
I am getting our troops killed, under the lie of Sadam's procurement 
of Yellow Cake Nuke WMD components, then blaming the lie on our British friends. 
I set the record for most campaign fund-raising trips by a U.S. president. 
In my first year in office over 2-million Americans lost their jobs and that trend continues every month. 
I set the all-time record for most foreclosures in a 12-month period. 
I appointed more convicted criminals to administration than any president in U.S. history.  
I set the record for least amount of press conferences than any president since the advent of television. 
I signed more laws and executive orders effectively amending 
or ignoring the Constitution than any president in history. 
I presided over the biggest energy crisis in U.S. history and refused to intervene when corruption involving the oil industry was revealed. 
I presided over the highest gasoline prices in U.S. history and 
refused to use national reserves as past presidents have done. 
I have cut health care benefits for war veterans and support a cut 
in duty benefits for active duty troops and their families -- in war time. 
I have set the all-time record for most people worldwide to 
simultaneously protest me in public venues (15 million people) 
shattering the record for protest against any person in the history of mankind. 
I've dissolved more international treaties than any president in U.S. history. 
I've made my presidency the most secretive and unaccountable of any in U.S. history. 
I'm proud that the members of my cabinet are the richest of any administration in U.S. history. 
My ""poorest millionaire,"" Condoleeza Rice, has a Chevron oil tanker named after her. 
I am the first president in U.S. history to have almost all 50 
states of the Union simultaneously suffer massive financial crisis. 
I presided over the biggest corporate stock market fraud of any 
market in any country in history. 

I am the first president in U.S. history to order a pre-emptive 
attack and the military occupation of a sovereign nation, and I did so 
against the will of the United Nations and the world community. 
I created the largest government department bureaucracy in the 
history of the United States. 
I set the all-time record for biggest annual budget spending 
increases, more than any president in history.

remove the U.S. from the Human Rights Commission.

remove the U.S. from the Elections Monitoring Board. 
I removed more checks and balances, and have the least amount of 
congressional oversight than any presidential administration in U.S. 
history. 
I rendered the entire United Nations viewpoints irrelevant. 
I withdrew the U.S. from the World Court of Law. 
I refused to allow inspectors access to U.S. ""prisoners of war"" 
(detainees) and thereby have refused to abide by the Geneva Convention.

election inspectors (during the 2002 U.S. election). 
I am the all-time U.S. and world record-holder for receiving the 
most corporate campaign donations. 
My largest lifetime campaign contributor, and one of my best 
friends,Kenneth Lay, former CEO of Enron Corporation presided over the 
largest corporate bankruptcy fraud in U.S. history. 
My political party used the Enron private jets and corporate 
attorneys to assure my success with the U.S. Supreme Court during my election decision. 
I have spent more money on polls and focus groups than any president 
in U.S. history. 
I garnered the most sympathy for the U.S. after the World Trade 
Center attacks and less than a year later made the U.S. the most 
resented country in the world, possibly the largest failure of 
diplomacy in World history. 
I am actively working on a policy of ""disengagement"" creating 
the most hostile of Israel-Palestine relations in at least 30 years. 
I am first president in history to have a majority of Europeans 
(71%) view my presidency as the biggest threat to world peace and 
security. 
I am the first U.S. president in history to have the people of South 
Korea more threatened by the U.S. than by their immediate neighbor, 
North Korea. 
I changed the U.S. policy to allow convicted criminals to be 
awarded government contracts. 

I set an all-time record for the 
number of administration appointees who violated U.S. law by not 
selling their huge personal investments in corporations bidding for 
U.S. contracts. 
I failed to fulfill my pledge to capture Osama Bin Laden, dead or 
alive. 
I failed to capture the anthrax killer who tried to murder the 
leaders of our country at the U.S. Capitol Building. Even after 18 
months I have no leads and no credible suspects. 
In the past 18 months following the World Trade Center attack I have 
successfully prevented any public investigation into the biggest 
security failure in the history of the United States. 
I removed more freedoms and civil liberties for Americans than any 
president in U.S. history. 

In a little over two years, I created the 
most divided country in decades, possibly the most divided since the 
Civil War. 
I entered my office with the strongest economy in U.S. history and 
have turned every single economic category downward -- all in less than two years. 

Records and References: 

I have at least one conviction for drunk driving in Maine. My Texas 
driving record has been erased and is not available. 
I was AWOL from the National Guard. 
I refuse to take a drug test or even answer any questions about drug 
use. 
All records of my tenure as Governor of Texas are now in my father's 
library, sealed, and unavailable for public view. 
All records of SEC investigations into insider trading or bankrupt 
companies are sealed in secrecy and unavailable for public view. 
All records or minutes from meetings that I, or my Vice-President, 
attended regarding public energy policy are sealed in secrecy and 
unavailable for public review. 

I hate George W Bush, In my opinion he is the worst President ever.  At least Nixon for all his faults got us out of a war.  Go see Fahrenheit 911"

"event","Well out of boredom I update.  Matt's wedding was awesome.  Much good times.  The only thing that sucked was that it took 4 hours to get there cause I chose the wrong way for Tara and I to go.  So there was much much traffic.  But the wedding was great.  I'm glad I could be a part of something so special.  Enjoy your many many years together Matt and Helen.
My hair is once again blond.  Tara did it for me the other day.  It looks good.  Just how I like it.  She is in Philly now at an Incubus concert which is awesome.  I really miss her though.  
Work has sucked.  My new manager doesn't know how to make a schedule so most of the days I had basically no one working with me.  Too much stress.  My ankle feels a whole lot better.  I still have to be careful on it though.  Next week is my birthday.  I am gonna be 23.  Sometimes I feel like even though I am getting old, I am not really growing, if that makes any sense.  When I was younger I always thought that at this age I would be out of college with a good job, probably living on my own.  Inside, I work at a crappy job, and still live at home.  I am out of college but I dropped out so that still doesn't count.  Well, time for bed so I can get up and go to my crappy job tomorrow."

I can't think strait
A thousand thoughts at once
too much

too much to think about and handle at once
I don't know what happened
I don't know what to say
I don't know anything anymore
too much in my life
I wish it could all just go away
all the problems I face
all the thoughts I think
Constituently every day
always in my mind
never leaving
always they must stay
Sometimes I sit
and sometimes I wonder
if there will ever truly be a day
when I can say to myself

and it finally went away
will I see a light at the end of a tunnel
will I see the next day..."

"event","Taken from the June 17th 2004 WWE Byte This report with Steven Richards:

They went to another caller and the caller asked Stevie what his favorite time in his career was? Stevie said that's hard to say because they are always striving every week to make their matches better and to have more fun. But he would have to go back to the ECW arena in January with 3PW, that had a lot of closure for him and that was the best reaction from fans as a whole. Besides that, he left ECW on bad terms twice and there was a lot of animosity between he and the fans for a long time and ECW fans do mean a lot to him because without those fans, nobody would have noticed Stevie Richards. Those fans made him something special and made places like WCW and WWE take interest in him and make him shine as a star. That night made him cry because the people had accepted him again and gave him a standing ovation.

And who was that caller?  None other than me.  That's right today I got to talk to the general manager of Stevie Night Heat himself Steven Richards.  It may have only been for a minute or so, but that's good enough for me.  It was a chance to talk to my favorite to my favorite wrestler right now in the world.  Now it is off to pack for Matt's wedding on Sat.  Update when I get back."

"event","Well, as of last Saturday I started my 9 day vacation.  And so far it pretty much sucked.  I started off by going to my cousin Sean's college graduation party which was cool cause I say some cool family.  Unfortunately was the day wore on I started to feel sick.  I was suppose to hang out with Tara after she got out of work too.  Well, I ended up getting sick but I still thought I would be ok to go.  Well it turned out not to be.  After meeting most of Tara's family I got sick again and decided to go home.  That really sucked cause I was really hoping to spend some time with her on the beach and stuff.  Well, I felt much better the next morning so later in the day I decided to play some basketball.  Well, in like the third game I came down really bad on my right ankle.  I thought I could just walk it off, but it was not to be.  Well, it was hurting worse like an hour later went everyone was done so I had Ferraro drop me off at Holy Name Hospital.  My Mom and dad met me there too.  Well despite telling them that my ankle was an 8 in a one to ten pain scale I was still there for two hours.  They told me it wasn't broken, but I could have told them that.  So they wrapped it up and gave me some crutches and instructions and sent me on my way.  So after a night's sleep last night I did nothing today but lay around sleep and watch TV.  Hopefully it will be better in time for Matts wedding"

"event","So I am gonna finally do an actually big update on my journal.  It's been a long time since I updated besides tests and surveys.  Any ways, things have been going ok since I last updated.  I am very settled into the new house.  No complaints at all there.  Work has gotten better.  I think I really needed to get away from that place for a little while.  When I went to Ridgefield Park I considered it a working vacation since I barely had to do any of my usual stuff.  So I came back to my job refreshed and ready to get back into the swing of things.  But now my manager and assistant manager are leaving for another store.  And now we are getting a newly promoted manager and newly promoted assistant manager to replace them.  That is gonna be interesting.  I know the manager and he is a really cool guy.  I don't know the assistant but I heard she never shuts up so I am not looking forward to that.  Things have been going great between Tara and I.  Ever time I see her I fall more and more in love with her.  I can honestly say that there is no one else I would rather be with in this world than her.  Even in Brittney Spears herself came up to me singing ""Hit me baby one more time"" and said take me now, I would say hell no cause I love my Tara Bing.  In the recent purchases department, I got some cool new DVDs.  Unfortunately I haven't really had the time to watch them.  I got Wrestlemania 20, The Return of The King, and two Henry Rollins comedy DVD and I have only been able to watch one of the Rollins DVDs.  Maybe on my vacation I can find time to watch them all.  Well, it's 3AM now and I gotta work in 11 hours so it's time for some sleep.  There I updated Dan, now comment on the damn thing.  I love you Tara."

<b>I Am A:</b> Chaotic Good Human Fighter Ranger
<br><br><u>Alignment:</u><br><b>Chaotic Good</b> characters are independent types with a strong belief in the value of goodness. They have little use for governments and other forces of order, and will generally do their own things, without heed to such groups.
<br><br><u>Race:</u><br><b>Humans</b> are the 'average' race. They have the shortest life spans, and because of this, they tend to avoid the racial prejudices that other races are known for. They are also very curious and tend to live 'for the moment'.
<br><br><u>Primary Class:</u><br><b>Fighters</b> are the warriors. They use weapons to accomplish their goals. This isn't to say that they aren't intelligent, but that they do, in fact, believe that violence is frequently the answer.
<br><br><u>Secondary Class:</u><br><b>Rangers</b> are the defenders of nature and the elements. They are in tune with the Earth, and work to keep it safe and healthy.
<br><br><u>Deity:</u><br><b>Tymora</b> is the Chaotic Good goddess of luck and good fortune. She is also known as Lady Luck, and also Tyche's fair-tressed daughter. Followers of Tymora believe in the tenent that, 'Fortune Favors the Bold,' and will throw caution to the wind and trust to luck to work things out for the best. Tymora's symbol is an unmarked silver disk.

"event","I never really explained why I am Strait Edge.  Hell, a lot of people don't even know what my Strait Edge things are.  Well, lemme name them off and explain why I choose not to do these things.  Alcohol:  I never really was a big drinker.  Sure I have been drunk a couple of times, but you can only count the number of times on your fingers.  Not counting church wine, I never had my first taste of it until I was 17 when I had half a wine cooler.  The first time I ever got drunk never came until I was I think 19 when Kristy and Meghan cheated at card games and got me to have something like 6 shots of vodka in like 20 minutes.  Man was I wasted.  And man did I ever get sick.  That was also the last time I ever had vodka.  After that I never really drank that much.  Even after I turned 21 I barely drank.  Then when one night I brought home a 6 pack and got drunk by myself to try and forget the depression I was in.  Later that week at one of Kim's parties I was still depressed and looking forwardto getting drunk.  After about two beers I realized that I didn't want this to become a regular thing and that this would not help me beat my depression.  I decided right then and there to quit drinking all together.  The fact that I have very strong alcoholic genes in me and also that I hate the taste of pretty much everything helped a lot too.  Since then (November02), I haven't had a drop.  Drugs: I never really got into drugs in my life.  I smoked pot a handful of times and had loads of fun doing it.  I also abused prescribed pain pills once or twice and it got me kinda high.  I liked these feelings.  I also liked that I felt good in the mornings, unlike getting drunk where as I would have a hangover.  The reason I don't smoke pot anymore is...well, I just don't.  I have barely ever really been around it.  Maybe if it was legal I might try it again, but that is a whole other topic.  I also don't feel like spending money on it.  Cigarettes:  I started smoking when I was 15 years old.  Since then I did it pretty much off and on.  I tried quitting 100 times in high school, cause I knew it was bad for you, but damn is it addicting.  I finally quit some time after I graduated high school and was smoke free for two years until I started again.  Since then I have been off and on again, but I am smoke free again.  I hate smoking but I usually use to do it cause of stress.  Now I try and do tons of other things instead like chew gum, squeeze a stress ball, anything.  Cutting:  I first cut myself intentionally when I was a senior in high school.  I sliced up my knuckles on a rocky wall.  I really don't know why I did it.  I just did.  I was depressed.  I haven't cut myself in 9 months.  I don't plan on doing it again.  I was very lucky not to come away with any scars.
Before I end this I wanna clarify that even though I am strait edge, I have any problems with anyone else doing thing that I don't.  (Expect cutting cause that can be very dangerous)  If people wanna have a drink, go for it.  If people wanna smoke a blunt, go ahead.  If you can do these things and it doesn't affect your everyday life, more power to ya.  It's when people go way to nuts like they have to have a 6 pack a day or they have to smoke tons of weed to get through the day to function that I have a problem with it."

Friday we will have the U-Haul so as they say in clearance sales everything must go.  This sucks also all I am doing at work is moving crap around.  Now I have to do it at home to.  Oh well.  Yesterday was great.  Once again got to see the awesome Miss(Not for long haha) Tara Bing.  We chill out and watched The Sopranos and stuff.  All and all another great visit from a great girl.

"event","Finally I am actually home tonight.  While many people would be like what the fuck, why would someone be happy to be home on a Friday night, I have a good reason.  The last four night, I have done overnights in the Ridgefield Park CVS.  Which basically means I go in at somewhere between 8 and 9PM and leave somewhere between 7 and 8 in the morning.  I think I did 45 hours in 4 days which is a lot, my Mike and my other workmate Lisa might have done more, but I will still bitch.  They were pretty fun though.  It was nice not to have to deal with customers and count money and shit like that.  Just go in there and completely redo sections, which ain't to fuckin bad.  I could tell I was extremely beat this morning though.  I got home and when I went to empty my pants pockets I could not find my wallet.  I looked around and still no wallet.  So I figured I left it at the awesome Bagel Shop I was at after work and when I called they had it.  Thank god.  Then my mom was nice enough to pick it up for me on her lunch hour.  I told her I would call them to let them know she was coming but I nodded off and when I woke up they were closed.  I can't wait until Monday.  The wonderful Tara is coming again.  I miss her so much."

"event","Ugh, it's 7:00AM and I have been awake for a half an hour after three crappy hours of sleep.  So I figured this is the perfect time to update.  Yesterday sucked.  My back had been hurting me two days ago but I figured it would go away after a good nights sleep.  Turns out I was very wrong.  I woke up the next morning in terrible pain.  I couldn't sit up in bed so I rolled out and like the trooper I am tried to get ready for work.  But when I could not bend over in the shower, I knew something was wrong.  So I called out of work and my mom drove me to the emergency room.  I guess they though my bad back pain wasn't to much of an emergency cause I was in there for 3 whole fucking hours before they finally called me in.  It probably didn't help my back sitting in those chair either.  Finally they told me I must have gotten muscle spasms at work the day before.  It was weird cause I actually did less lifting the day before than I did usually on our truck days.  So they gave me a shot and some Valium and sent me on my way.  Then after gulping down a huge shake float from Dairy Queen, I passed out from the Valium for three hours and my back felt better. It still hurts a little now, but I can at least bend over and walk around and stuff.  Two days ago was also a pretty good wrestling day.  Me and Tony went to a very small indy show in Bogota.  We ended up watching Balls Mahoney wrestling which is awesoe cause he was one of me and Tony's favorite wrestlers from ECW.  Bam Bam Bigelow was suppose to be there but got dates confused and didn't make it.  The best part was meeting Captain Lou Albano who I didn't even know would be there.  I got his autograph and a picture with him.  I then realized then he gave me two 8 by 10s by mistake and gave one back.  He said since I was such an honest guy I could have that one for free.  What an awesome guy.  Then he limped over and sorta managed a team.  It was pretty awesome cause he got to make fun of the other team and I use to love hearing Captain Lou talk on the mic.  Today I hope will be a good day.  Tara is coming up later so that is so totally awesome.  I can't wait to see her again.  Well time to go lay down."

Why won't that fucking dog across the street stop fucking barking?  Seriously it's been barking for like a half an hour.  What the fucking is so interesting that you would bark for 30 fucking minutes at?  I need Beer's dog Tank.  I bet he would make him stop.  He would probably punch him.  Or maybe pee on him.  God that dog is awesome.

I miss Tara.  I can't wait to see you again babe."

"event","So my Tara countdown is finally over.  Last Sunday she came down to my house to hang out.  And man I am I glad she did.  She is so totally cool.  I love talking to her because she always has such great stories, likes so many cool things, and is random (which in her case is a total plus).  When she was here I felt really comfortable around her which is great.  We watched the Sopranos together and I don't know why I have never watched that show before.  It was awesome.  All and all I can't wait until the next time she comes up.  Guess a new Tara countdown will have to begin.  Well, on Monday I found out some interesting news.  As of May first I will no longer live in Ridgefield Park.  My mom brother and I are moving to Bogota. A couple of weeks ago my current lan lord told my mom that he is moving his son up here.  But it was not going to be until October so he was giving us plenty of notice since we were tenants for him for so long.  So my mom went to a relater on Monday and we visited this great upstairs apartment.  By 5:30 that afternoon we met the lan lord and signed the lease.  It may only be the next town over but it is gonna be weird not living in RP.  I have lived here for 21 years (I lived in Cliffside Park for the first 6 months of my life).  It means also I have to learn a new phone number and crap.  But the new apartment looks really awesome and it's time to move on whatever that means.  So that was defindently a cool couple of days, with Tara Bingey (haha) being the highlight."

"event","Well, my visit with Tara did not happen yesterday,  She had car troubles and could not make it up here. =(  But we will hang out soon, hopefully in a couple of days, depending on my work schedule.  So, I'm happy about that.  So that mean I had some time to kill yesterday.  So me Paul and Beer went to a chinese buffet and gorged ourselves for a while.  Then me and Beer went to best Buy and he bought a small cheap DVD player and I got a massive ammount of tape to record with and a CD from a band I never thought ever own.  That's right I now own the new Brand New CD.  I use to hate them for a strange reason only known to me and the people I told it to, but their new stuff came out and I actually started to enjoy it.  Then after a very relible source told me it was good, I bought it.  Oh well, from what I have listened to so far I liked it.  Any way after that my plans for the night were empty so I sat down to watch From Dusk 'til Dawn until Chris called me.  He asked me if I wanted to go to a strip club and after thinking about it for all of two seconds I said yes.  It was a very enjoyable time cause I got to sit back relax and enjoy the show.  Also a very Hugh Morris quote came from the night:
Me-""I always feal bad saying no to a dance.
(Stripper walks up and I turn her down then she walks into a chair)
Me-See, if I said yes that would not have happened.

So after that I came home had the nightly awesome phone conversation with Tara, watched most of The Substitute 4 and went to bed.  Then today was nothing special.  I layed around most of the day until I dragged my ass out to do laundry.  Then I came home.  And here I am.  Then tomorrow it is back to work at 11AM."

Last night at Beer's I finally played Beer in chess.  I beat him 5 times in a row, but he really made me think.  Well, except for the game I beat him in 7 moves.  But other then that he's got potential.

Greatest thing about St. Patrick's Day dinner at my house:  Leftovers.  Other than that I sleep a bunch of the day cause I am off.  Tomorrow is gonna suck at work cause I have to be there at 5:30 in the morning for truck.  Plus tomorrow is the day before inventory so I will probably be there for a long time.

PROBER
(Dominant Introvert Concrete Feeler )


Brendan
 Like just 3% of the population you are a PROBER (DICF)--curious, passionate, driven, and probing. You're the kind of person who can't leave well enough alone. You have a very strong personality and a sense of adventure. And you'd rather go out and experience things for yourself than take someone else's word for it. Some people probably think you're a maniac. 

People have a hard time believing you're an intelligent person. Perhaps there's a reason for this? Time will tell. 
 
Interesting facts about the PERSONALITY TEST:


9,817,011 people have taken TheSpark's Personality Test. 
41% of them are male, 59% of them are female. 
The most common personality type is the Guru (SEAF).

The rarest is the Businessman (DECT). Only 3% of all test takers fall into that category. 
Women prefer Shakespeare."

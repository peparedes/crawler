"event","Well, I figure I'd update this thing now just to let ya'll know I'm still alive. Now that summer's here I've been busier than ever which is kind of odd but in a refreshing way. I've undertaken a self-designed research project about speech and gender, I work 40 hours a week at my dead-end job as a gas station attendant (it's a means to an end)and I work for a professor of morphology at Pitt. All in all I like what's going on so far but at times it's quite tiring. By the way, I also started taking Tai Ji Chung which is GREAT! I definitely recommend it to anyone, well, almost anyone.

Ok, so I took the quiz that Daniel left a link to and of course I got ""the black guy.""

"event","This survey looked interesting so I thought I'd take it. Well, the semester's almost over and I am quite grateful. I hope everyone did well on their finals. So, I've decided to do a research project of sorts about speech and gender and in particular differences between women and men's speech. Also, I will again attempt to tackle learning Navajo verbs but hopefully I'll have more success than I did last year. Ah! I almost forgot, I've been compiling a book of ""strange"" sayings that I've heard while residing in the hell-mouth commonly referred to as PITTsburgh. I'll start posting some of these expressions and words her for your amusement and bewilderment.

"event","Heh, I thought the title was a bit interesting. Here's a thought, if you put the primary stress on either of the ""saws"" how does it affect the reading of this sentence to you. Note: Ignore the capital /s/ that kinda gives the intended reading away. Unfortunately I saw Saw this past Sunday and it sucked. Y? because the acting was basically non-existent throughout the entire move. I mean, I was pointing at the screen and laughing like a jackoff at some of the scenes because they were that bad. *sigh* I would have had more fun watching the Spongebob Squarepants movie. Anyways yesterday in morphology the five of us that showed up went over last week's homework and I got Pascual to amend one of his answers on the homework; it was fun to see him think. The question,as if you are interested, was asking why the word *abolishal doesn't exist in English (i.e. is commonly used) and his answer originally was because the suffix /-al/ can only attach to stems that have final stress (e.g. arrival and acquittal) but what he forgot to mention was that /-al/ is also a Latinate suffix that only attaches itself to Latinate bases. That's not a big deal but it's kinda important if you're dealing with several affixes that only attach themselves to stems that have final stress. Sorry, there's my rant for the day."

"event","Well, I got bitched at for not writing more about Leslie, not really bitched at, just had a stern suggestion. Leslie Byrd (yeah it's a weird spelling) is a good friend of mine from high school. We weren't good friends then but we're closer now. She's blonde, fun loving and a year younger than me and she's the kind of girl who I thought would NEVER get married, not because she couldn't but because it just doesn't seem to be her ""style."" Her best friend during that time was Candace Dodge, the stereotypical ""good girl"" who, from what I hear is basically the same way now, but in college. Lelsie can sing very well as she was in the highest ranking chorus in our high school and sang at church too. She had this one annoying screeching thing she would do that was quite distrubing due to the shrillness it would produce in her voice. She's pretty outgoing and fun to be around so there's a summary introduction of The Byrd."

"event","So today I was finally doing some reading for my class on sociolinguistics and on one of the intro pages it has a quote by George Eliot which states, ""'Correct English is the slang of pricks who write history and essays.'"" I couldn't agree more. This is also going up as an away message. Yesterday was Jen's birthday, she's 21 so now she can legally drink. Her dad came to visit which was really cool because he's Sean Connery and therefore has to be cool. It's a scientific law. Today is Katie's birthday as well as Jen's mom's so the past two days have been pretty eventful in a the whole birthday sense.

I got a call from my aunt and she's gonna send me something; it should get here by the end of this week so that's exciting. They never call or send anything so I'm naturally expectant. My siblings haven't changed much but Zephaniah will be thirteen this year and, according to my aunt, might not be alive when/if I go down there for Christmas. We shall see. 'Tis all for now."

For example, we learned that the dictionary citation form in Arabic is the third person singular perfect. I have no intent of studying Arabic but I know this now. We also learn about words like the verb to hawk and the hideous infotainment, as well as the etymology of the disgusting word yinz (yunz), and how productive circumfixation is in the Romance languages.

"event","Tonight after playing settlers at the apartment we had a discussion in which we basically discusses Andy Campbell's lack of religious beliefs. We finally concluded that he was an egotistical-non theist. This whole discussion began when he asked us if we could imagine ourselves and our lives without any religious influence whatsoever. He asked several times throughout the course of the discussion because we kept going on tangents trying to classify him by his belief ""system."" Every time he asked I thought, based on how I feel and know now, to take away any religious influence would be like taking a part of me and my culture away for it permeates many things and aspects of life. For some strange reason, thoughts about my past kept coming up and they upset me. I guess the chains of the past forged in the steel of pain and dissappointment aren't easily broken."

She was dancing to Def Leppard, Bon Jovi,and that kind of music but it was hot I mean I actually  wanted to kill her boyfrined for a few minutes. She was pretty hot and I had to make some self control rules. I made all of them too.

"event","Wow,
   It's only the second week of college and I'm already worn out. This weariness I contribute mainly to my Chinese class. It's very intense. We learn about 40 characters a week because by the end of this term we have to know approximately 400 characters and for our final we're going to have to write a four page paper completely in Chinese. I spend the bulk of my time studying Chinese writing, which is a lot to remember. Speaking is even more of a trip because they're some sounds that the Chinese have that we, being native English speakers don't have. The opposite is true also. In other words, I have to learn new sounds as well as unlearn old ones. This week in the practice class we went to our no English rule but today it was broken...by the teacher. One of my fellow classmates wasn't grasping the pronunciation of the word for yesterday which is, without the tones, zuotian. He just couldn't understand what he was trying to say. You see there three levels of speaking and writing classes and he's in the first year spoken class but he's not in the writing class like the majority of us are, so he's at a slight disadvantage. There are several asians in our class. There're two native Chineses, one Korean, and one Vietnamese. The Chinese speak Cantonese but we're learning Mandarin or Pinyin as it is sometimes called in the speaking class. The writing for them I guess is not difficult because the same characters are used in Pinyin and Cantonese; that kind of ticks me off. They're all cool though. Oh yeah, we have our Chinese classes back to back for a total of two hours everyday, making it a ten credit course, technically. It's all year as well, two terms long every year until the third expires. there's no fourth year class. Budo is interesting; we learn all kinds of things like roll falls, pressure points, and other universal components of the other popular and not so popular martial arts. Kendo is cool, it makes your legs hurt but it's a good kind of hurt. Sean would be glad to hear that I'm taking kendo; he's trying to do the same while he's in college. I really enjoy the discipline and respect in budo. You show respect to everyone, no matter what belt rank; I choose to bow to evryone except for my fellow white belts. Yes, I bow to the yellow belts. It's good as a workout and to just have fun and meet other people."

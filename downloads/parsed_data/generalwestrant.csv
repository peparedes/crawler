"event","So I was going through my email inbox, which may explain the rash of new friend requests linking back to this page, and I happened upon an unopened email. Now I should have known better given who sent it and the subject line. You know those people who never produce any original content? Every single post / email is either a link, a forward, or a warning about infected needles in pay phones / vampire carjackers roaming around the city / psychotic women from Russia who aim to steal your vast collection of porn and nail your genitals to the fridge. Oh wait, that last one is a personal fear of mine. Scratch that.

But you know the sort. You get the email and just know it's another freakin chain letter. I fucking hate chain letters. How selfish is that? Aside from wasting my time with reading your retarded drivel, I have to worry that a rapid hyena is going to pick the locks on my front door and rape me tonight. Dude I have enough shit on my mind without having to worry about the state of my ass.

If you're new to the Internet, or you just figured out that your computer can be used for more than porn, well my friends, I'm here to tell you how to identify chain letters! Now there are several forms of these evil entities roaming around. Here are some friendly examples strictly for reference.


Chain Letter Type 1: (scroll down) Make a wish!!! >
>
>
>
>
>
>
>
>
>
>
>
>
>
>Keep Scrolling
>
>
>
>
>
>
>
>
>
>
>
>
>
>
>
>
>
>Come on, make a wish! I swear, this is super duper awesome!
>
>
>
>
>
>
>
>
>
>
>
>
>
>
>
>
>Dude are you high? She thinks you drool too much and smell like rotten cheese. Pick again fuckhead.
>
>
>
>
>
>
>
>
>
>
>
>
>
>
>
>
>
> Dammit wish something else and make it good!
>
>
>
>
>
>

>
>
>STOP!!!!


There you go! Now I swear to Isis that your wish will come true, however you need to forward this letter on to 109543434534 people in the next 2 seconds, otherwise an angry donkey will kick the ever loving shit out of you and send the contents of that ""private"" folder on your desktop to your parents. This is 1000000% true! I swear it! Not like those other 20 emails you've received this week. I swear it!

Case 2: Gloria rottentits received this email 186 years ago, which is pretty fucking amazing because they didn't really have electricity back then, let alone email, but whatever it's true because some guy at a football game told me, right after he showed me the $595 billion check that Bill Gates, Michael Jackson, George Bush, and Dick Cheney sent him because the four of them are buying AOL, Microsoft, and the Hoover vacumn cleaner company and they want to test their newest prototype product, which is (and this is super secret, so if you tell anyone, a black van will pull up in front of your parents house, find you in the basement playing video games, and force you to talk with girls) a super secret vacumn-cleaner computer cyborg.

If you send this to:
1 person, then 1 person will hate you for sending them an idiotic chain letter.
2-10 people, then 2-10 people will be plotting your death for sending them a retarded chain letter.
10-40 people (yes, if you send it to 10 people, you will be doubly punished), then 10-40 people will hijack fruit carts and drive them through your house.
50-200 people (we lost the 41-49 count), then a shitload of angry people will show up at your house with rubber fists, ready to give you the beating you so sorely deserve.


Exhibit 3:

Dear sir, madam, or other,
Thank you for reading my correspondance. See, there's a village of starving, thirsty, donkey-less, Internet-less, armless, legless, parent-less, relativeless boys in yaktuskarmenisktuyiastan. Also the village has no water, power, or escort service. These boys could be saved, if only you would forward on this email. See every time you forward this, Bill Gates will donate 1/100 of an Italian Lira. Oh sure they don't circulate the lira anymore, but fuck off, these kids need your money! So forward this email on to everyone you know or who has written to you in the past 5 years. If you don't send this to at least 20 people in the next 1/1000 second, your head will explode for no apparent reason. Good day.


Exhibit 5:

This letter will bring you good luck if you pass it on to everyone you know. Honest!
Don't send me money - that's my other scam, this one's for free.

In 1978 it was passed to Fran Ferdinan who immediately got a hard-on. Sick
Bitch. She never passed it on; I found out and went round her place and blew
her away with my magnum. Next I passed it on to the three Wayne brothers in
incest, Illinois. They never passed it on either, so I ran them down
outside a movie theatre after ""Staying Alive"" in 1984. How they came to
be watching it 5 years before it's release date has me, I don't understand either, but
I killed them anyway. Billy Bob goatfucker of donkey-sodomizer, Montana was next
to get the letter but he couldn't read. Didn't matter tho, I caved his
head in with a 2x4 one night while he was watching ""American Idol"", which
is reason enough in itself for getting your head bashed in. Next in line
for the letter was Frank LikesToGetDickslapped of lowIQ, Ohio he gave it to his mother,
but she burnt it so I gave them both a cement enema before pushing them off
the Sears Tower. He died happy though, the sick bastard! After
him came Sandra Fruitfucker of DryHump, Texas and Robert limpdick of
Puckered-Anus, Florida and they didn't even read it, but admittedly, I did kill them with an electric stapler 5 minutes after they received it. Sandra
hadn't even opened the envelope either. Talk about laugh! After them was
Alice TVmonitor and Mike Computermouse both of BleedingRectum, Michigan
who met at the bar where I hang out, but the selfish pricks crashed their car into a metro bus before I could get to them. Bastards.

Anyway, next in the line is you {XXXXXX}.

And I've just bought a shiny new chainsaw.

I don't give a shit whether you pass the message on or not any more.






Chain Letter Type 4

You are my FRIEND! A FRIEND is someone who sticks through you thick and thin, even though you drink a lot, smell like a fish left out in the July sun, and have the IQ of a carrot. A friend is someone who thinks you're super cool awesome, even though the only thing you ever say is ""Dude!"" and you look like someone tried to stop an oil rig fire with your face. A friend is someone who listens to you while you cry about what a dumb fuck you are for not leaving his drunk ass. A friend is someone who pretends to like you, when in reality they'd not even bother to piss on you if you were on fire. A friend if someone who cares for your safety, asks you not to speed down the highway, writes you tickets, checks you for drugs.. No shit, wait, that's the police. Nevermind.

Because you are my friend, you have to pass this on. Otherwise it means you hate me and I will kill myself by sticking my pecker in the washer (on spin cycle). Also if you don't pass this on, nobody will ever talk to you again and you will not get laid for the next 30 years. Enjoy retirement fuckhead!


Example 12:

Hell0>> PLZ SEEND^H THIS ON TO 10210312 PEOPLE BECAuse you will have GERAT LICK IF YOU DO1121!!!! tHIS IS TRUE!1!! IT HAPppened to my BESTEDEST friend, Greg ASsream, and now he's doing lines of coke off a strippers tits. NAD THIS WILL HAPEN TO YOU!!111!!!! IF YOU SEND THIS LETTER TO 1000 PEOPLE IN THE NEXT 200 YEARS!!! yOU WILL GET hAWt chicks, riches, drive a OpimPED bently. Oh and DON'T MIDN the spellng. SMart people sux!


And here ends our lesson. Got all that? Good. Chain letters suck ass, please do not send them out. The next person who sends me a chain letter is getting a steel-toed enema."

"event","Today was a fun day of car-repair.  I know I've said this before, but never again will I buy a Ford.  

New brakes (at 50k miles, not so bad) $500.  The bummer was I needed new rear rotors because the auto makers use the cheapest parts they can find.  They also found a transmission leak (not cool on a 50k mile vehicle) and I need new tires in about 10k.  So if the leak gets worse, looks like I'm shoving this car onto whoever wants it.  ;)  Er there's always trade-in deals too.  

So I'm $600 lighter, which would've annoyed me to no end while I was in school.  That would mean most of my monthly pay was gone.  But anymore, it's a minor annoyance.  At least my car doesn't shake when it's on the highways anymore.  That was most annoying.

Anyone want to purchase a fine automobile?  New brakes even.

"event","Eh I was wrong.  I'll be updating this from here out it would seem.  Well until federal agents kick in my door or something like that.  So certainly many new things have been in the works and I do believe I've picked up some new readers (hello to you folks in the cheap seats).  And please remember to tip your wait staff, we don't feed them much these days.  

Quick summary of goings ons:
I've started running.  Yes I know, that explains that rash of earthquakes we've been feeling recently.  I'm down to 9 minutes 10 seconds for a mile.  Not so bad considering as how I started at 14 minutes about a month ago.  My goal was under 10.  The new goal is under 8.  I think under 8 is a decent time.  I'm not about to start doing marathons but I got tired of the 'butterball effect'.  I guess recent times have spawned some good changes.  The sad part is that I'm probably in the best shape I've ever been in.  Hey, round is a shape.

I've paid off all of my credit cards and a large chunk of my student loans.  Thank you government check.  Your tax dollars at work.  So I should have my loans paid off within 5 years now.  Well until I go back to school.

I almost drove to New York City on Saturday.  It was 6PM and I was bored as people were not around that night.  But I exercised restraint and went over to the gym (full pun intended).  I will drive there one of these weekends.  Just to get some nighttime pics of the skyline.  Just me, some good tunes, my tripod, my ancient Canon, and any unwitting souls who don't know better.

Picked up some new threads whilst in Michigan.  I think my life needed a bit of a womans touch.  That's the last time I ever pick out my own clothes, let me tell you.  ;)

You know what?  I'm going to exclude discussing anyone other than myself.  I think that's probably best when dealing in a public forum as this.  Especially considering how this page will probably be linked by google through some odd spidering effect.  Lets keep it quiet, what say?

Music of the moment:
Massive Attack - Small Time Shot Away
Tool - Lateralus album
Dave Brubeck - <stuff off the radio>

Eye Candy:
Gran Turismo 4 is beyond cool.  If you haven't ventured out of the mancave recently, do so and pick up a copy.  It was worth the wait.
Worlds of Warcraft is good for those bad days.  Sometimes hacking and slashing can be fun.
Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas - Eh, still playing occasionally.  I've lost a bit of interest because the races do annoy me.

I'm still waiting for the impact to figure out how to get their audio streaming back up.  I'm definitely missing my old Michigan radio.  Oh mah gawd, it works!  Holy crap they fixed it!  The windows media player version works.  Sweet, I can go on with living.  ;)

"event","Another few weeks down, not much has changed.  It's certainly cooler around here, which is always good.  I do love the fall.  I've been getting along rather well and things are going better than they have in years.  I'm really having fun and truly happy.  To be honest, I can't exactly pick the last time I really felt this optimistic and lifted.  It's been a few, let me tell you.

Work is good, as good as work can get I think.  I've been taking a bunch of online training courses between my ""real"" workstuff.  I'm trying to take advantage of everything I can while I've got the time.  I've also been venturing to the gym 4 or 5 times per week.  It actually feels good to get out.

Unfortunately my wrist is still messed up.  A month later and it still isn't much better.  So I need to go in later this week and make sure I haven't had a break or fracture for the last month.  You'd figure I would notice but who knows these days.  I suppose lifting weights won't exactly help me either.  So I have a spiffy new brace and all.  I can still drive and operate basic household appliances.  My hands do get really tired after just a bit of typing.  Eh just muscles I haven't used in a while I suppose.

Well on that, I'm out.  The goal is to be in by 6:30 or earlier tomorrow, so that means wake by 5:30.  I do love living so close to work that I can get there in 20 minutes.  Now I just have to perfect the 10 minute shower.  I'll work on that.

"event","As a friendly note, I would recommend that nobody install windows XP service pack 2, if you're considering it.  I'm rolling mine back to SP1 right now.  SP2 installs some ""security"" features by default which end up disabling such features as normal web browsing and network connectivity.  The only way to restore normal network behavior is to turn off most every security feature provided by SP2, along with some standard provisions.

So long story short, don't install SP2.  It will break lots of other applications and disable a good bit of basic functionality."

"event","These entries are getting extremely boring.  Another 2 weeks of nothing new and another paycheck, which seems to be needed around here.

I headed out with a few work-people to the air and space museum in downtown.  Someone elected we drive as opposed to take the metro, much to my discust.  I'm normally easy going but I hate parking in DC.  The beltway was stacked up to an insane measure.  It took us 2 hours to get from downtown to home.  So I said next time we are taking the metro.  I don't care who likes to drive and who is scared of trains.  Screw it driving takes too long.  $8 to park too.  

The museum was cool enough though.  By the time we got down there, we had a whole 2 hours.  Go planning!  I was mildly annoyed though.  

I've finished unpacking officially.  I still have heaps of stuff for storage and I still need to get a smaller storage unit (and save $150 per month), but at least I've inventoried all the broken stuff.  Now to file my insurance claim.  

I've been rebuilding my computers a bit.  I have to admit that the TV hasn't been turned on in over a week.  I use cable for the internet only.  I've been playing a lot of guitar too.  I'm having fun here but sometimes I just want to be alone with my music.  I can honestly say it's mine too, nobody else is playing it.  What a cool feeling.

I'm headed home for Labor day.  A full 3 days should do me good.  

On that, I'm going to start with the weekly phone calls.  I swear I'm on the phone a good 20 hours per week.  Probably 4 hours per night to various people.  No complaints, I'm just very glad I got the unlimited long distance / local calling.  Bummer they've got that for the North American continent these days.  I would've liked that a few years back.

"event","Heh, 2 week report.  :P

Well I finally did receive my furniture.  It was the 17th, so almost 10 days ago.  They did a Saturday delivery, much to my delight.  So far, nothing is broken.  My microwave is acting a bit freaky and I may have 2 hard drives which didn't survive, but that's pretty good.

I ended up renting a 10X15 storage unit down here.  The unit is already 1/2 empty.  I've been throwing out stuff like a madman.  I'm not going to need old classnotes from ASU so why pay a lot of money to move and store them?  Makes no sense.  I'm donating a bunch of clothes, electronics, and desk supplies to a church in Baltimore.  I figure they can use the stuff more than I can.  I'm giving up a bunch of my old textbooks too.

Yea, I'm a packrat and I'm giving away everything.  I'm just sick of having so much stuff.  I want to start only keeping exactly what I need.  If I don't use something for a few years, I need to get rid of it.

So yea, things are going over here, I'm just annoyed.  Eh, ok, this is my journal, I can write whatever.  ;)  If you don't know something for sure, don't say that you know it.  Yea, I'm guilty of violating this, many times in fact.  But I make a consious effort these days to not say much of anything unless I'm quite certain about my facts.  When people provide me information, which I assume to be factual, which is based on assumptions, I'll make bad decisions.  I hate having incomplete or false info which has been passed as true and complete.  

Anyhow I do love it out here.  I've made a number of new friends and we have a bit of fun doing stuff outside work.  I'm adjusting to the temperature.  When I first got here, the A/C was always cranked down to 72.  Now I get cold if it's at 75.  I leave the thermostat at 78 to 80 most of the time.  In Michigan, I would've gone crazy.  I've finally got the hang of these roads and I know what places are fun on weekends.  So I guess I'm adjusting to things here.  It generally takes me about a month to feel completely at home.  Maybe I'm just speeding up a bit.

That's about it.

"event","Well my last day of work.  Then off for a week, then back on in a different state.  Eh, that works.

This past week has been a blast though.  Bar nights, hanging with the old classmates and roommates, doing less work than I should, generally having fun.  My goal is to get back to Michigan sometime in the fall.  I do want to see everyone again and getting back to the cold is a good motivator.  I'm not a warm weather fan.  ;)

Aside from that, nearly everything I own is on a moving van.  Just wasting my last workday doing nothing but surfing the web.  Ahh your last day of work / school is always the best.  You know that nothing is getting done.  First days rule too for pretty much the same reason.

Anyhow, I should get back to my emails and slacking.  I'm pretty much the only one here today, in front of the long weekend.  Fun!

I'm going to be in a town called Columbia in Maryland.  It's up by Baltimore, but an easy drive to work.  My move-in day is July 9th.  Got phone service all set up, the movers are coming tomorrow, got a storage unit, everything is about good.  Rent is a bit steep, 1200+ per month, but that's for a 1000+ ft 2 bedroom place.

So if anyone is going to be in the DC / Maryland area, look me up.  Leave a message if you want the new phone numbers.

So now it's time to find an apartment and get the moving company set up.  Oh yea, and give my 2 weeks notice at work.  I do love my current job but no way am I turning this down.

My current email address will still be valid, as will my cell phone number.  Any mail sent to the addresses you may have will get forwarded.

"event","Well I've been in Columbus for the past few days.  It's legitimately been really fun.  We had a good bunch of people this year and the accomodations were top notch.  The hotel is really nice.

Tonight, we had a tour of OSU stadium, which ended in the presidents suite for beers.  An excellent view, some 150+ feet up in the air, right over the 50 yard line.  I'm not exactly a football fan, but that was cool.  We even got to go down on the field.

Pretty much the entire experience has been conference during the day, with food being brought in constantly, then head out to a restaurant for drinks.  Best part is I'm not paying for much of anything.

Eh, I would miss this part of the job.  With all the conferences and trips we take, you do get a lot of time off.  That and the 3+ days off per month of vacation and sick time.  We have meetings until 11:45, then it's a 5 hour drive back to Michigan.  Someone else drove this time so my role is the navigator.  So I should get back right around 5PM.  Then it's back to work as normal for Wednesday.  No update on the gov't work yet.  Still in eval.  I'm going to check in early next week if I don't get a call before then.  Beginning of next week will be about 3 weeks in eval.

Anyhow, I'm probably heading back out with some people to sample the local flavor of OSU.  ;)

"event","What if someone else directed Spider-Man?

.  James Cameron: Green Goblin renamed G-1000, given special morphing powers. Spider-Man keeps saying, ""I'll be back."" And Mary Jane keeps saying, ""I'll never let go.""

.  Tim Burton: Title changed to Edward Spider-Hands. Winona Ryder as a goth Gwen Stacy. Climactic battle: Angry mob wielding pitchforks and torches calls for Spidey's head.

.  Quentin Tarantino: Set in the 70s. Peter Parker bitten by a psychedelic spider loaded with LSD. Samuel Jackson as jive-talking ""J.J."" Jameson, editor in chief at the Daily Brother.

.  Martin Scorsese: ""Flash, are you talking to me? Are you talking to me? You must be talking to me, cuz there's no one else around.""

.  Woody Allen: Peter Parker consults a shrink. Says he dresses up in colorful outfits and likes to go ""swinging."" 
-T."

"event","so everynight i sit here in my living room with the windows wide open, and almost every other night i have the privelage to&nbsp;listen to the many gay men&nbsp;heard into&nbsp;my neighbors house.
then as some time passes, probably over some wine and cheese or something, they laugh and talk loudly about books and movies and actors or whatever.&nbsp;
then some more time passes and it gets really really quiet but they're all still in there, doing whatever.

i wake up at 9 am every morning and all the cars are still there of course.&nbsp;
1030 comes around, right when im about to get into my car and theres always 2 or 3 of them sitting on the porch in their bathrobes drinking coffee.&nbsp;
i smile and wave because i think in a weird way its kind of cute...?
i love gay men.&nbsp;

i just thought id share that. since tonight is one of those nights."

"event","chad came home from&nbsp;tour &nbsp;yesterday, i havent left his side until 10 minutes ago. 
we felt like little kids yesterday, &nbsp;we were so excited to see eachother and&nbsp;we laughed every second of being together. 
pathetic, we had to break into his house just so we'd have a place to stay last night. his parents are on vacation and lock him out of his house but we got in and had&nbsp;the perfect night.&nbsp;2 blunts, 1 joint, a whole lot of hot tub, blankets upon blankets and pillows, him playing guitar anddd a lot of pizza.&nbsp; 
we have slumber parties like little 10 year old girls.&nbsp; 
minus the illegal things. 
i hope. 

anyway, i enjoy us. 
we fight like we're married, where one of us ends up sleeping on the opposite end&nbsp;of the bed.&nbsp; 
but we always wake up next to eachother and everythings okay. 
we stay up all night talking and smoking and trying to make sense of the world.&nbsp; 
we've got it good i guess. 


sooo basically ive got to go to bed alone tonight. 
but after this weekend im pretty satisfied with life, whos in it, whos not, and leaving high school forever in 10 days.

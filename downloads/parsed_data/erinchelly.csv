"event","<em>Wow....<br />So I totally forgot that I haven't posted to this in a looong time. <br />So in the last year and a half or so tons has happened!!! <br /><br />I really enjoyed living with Val again for fall of my senior year. Unfortunately I didn't get much time around her because our schedules were crazpy!!&nbsp; I also pretty much epically failed at SLA stuff. Everything started off super great over the summer doing the planning parts with the RA but when I went for SLA training week I started feeling really insecure about everything. Our dorm was the outside exception for a lot of things too. High point of that was getting to meet the new RD. I loved her from her first e-mail and meeting her didn't disappoint!!&nbsp; The rest of the semester had super highs and lows. Unfortunately I allowed myself to be intimidated by the girls on the hall. That makes being a spiritual life adviser pretty stinkin hard when you're too insecure to dive into their world. Someday I will &quot;grow up&quot;. <br /><br />When the semester started Stephen and I had agreed not to communicate (or rather I had decided we weren't going to..). He was here early for orientation and I was early for SLA training. Every fall Quest has a Leadership retreat which happened to be the weekend before classes started. I wasn't planning on going because I had training but as the time came closer my leaders really felt that I was supposed to go and after wrestling with Jesus on it I agreed to go. I was really happy as I was driving the 30min to the church at 6:30am the morning off and then Jesus asked me a really hard question.&nbsp; &quot;So Erin, what are you going to do if Stephen is there? Are you going to follow Me?&quot; My expression of happiness turned into a look that could kill as I replied, &quot;You' wouldn't!!&quot;&nbsp; He replied, &quot;What's it to you?&nbsp;You follow Me!&quot; (don't you love it when Jesus quotes himself from scripture??)&nbsp; I relaxed and submitted and remembered that Stephen was at orientation so it shouldn't really be a problem. As I walk in to get registered who do my eyes fall on?&nbsp;None other than my beloved Stephen.&nbsp; I panicked. I grabbed the first girl from my lifegroup I saw and took her to the side room and begged her to pray for me. She did, but really had her mind on other things. When we were done the coast was clear for me to get registered. Everyone was assigned to a bus alphabetically and I&nbsp;begged God that we would be on separate buses.&nbsp; Nope not at all. I walked on the bus and locked eyes with him. I gave the head nod and he returned it and then I walked as fast as I could to the back of the bus and threw a temper tantrum to God.&nbsp;&nbsp;(I know right...what happened to &quot;Yeah I'll follow You&quot;) I told Him how I felt cheated, how I didn't want to share, how I wanted this to be my last &quot;safe haven&quot; before I had to be on guard at school, blah blah selfish selfish blah blah. He looked at me and said, &quot;Erin really?&nbsp;Last year you begged me to bring Stephen down for Leadership Retreat and now that I have you are going to throw a fit because it isn't exactly on your terms?&nbsp;No huh, you let me lead Stephen and you Follow Me.&quot; Needless to say I was humbled. All day Stephen was on one side of the room and I was on the other. I'll admit I was really distracted. I was trying wayyy too hard to be open to Jesus and to hear all that He had to say instead of being really authentic and honest and real. I put on my leader mask and was crumbling beneath it. During the last session the curtain between heaven and earth was split open in the room. We sang &quot;Where you Go I Go&quot; and lots of other Jesus Culture and Hillsong worship. After a small break down I went to the back of the room to just soak in all that was around me. I caught sight of Stephen pouring all he had out to God and I couldn't help but be awed. I felt Jesus wrap me in His arms and remind me that it is Stephen that He has for me, but if I would just give Him the semester to do a mighty work in both of us individually I would be amazed come Christmas Break. &nbsp;<br />We started school without talking. It didn't take long before we started seeing each other on campus, but I would turn another direction as soon as I saw him. It killed me. My heart would leap out of my chest and refuse to come back. Once I was in the cafeteria making a salad. I was going down the line and glanced up as the person on the other side turned to go get cookies....it was him. I barely could get my lunch down.&nbsp; This went on for two weeks. Then, my mom and two of our friends came down for the weekend to go with us to the big music party called Questapalooza. They all thought this time of silence was crazy and were convinced they were going to break it for us.&nbsp; The night they came I was on my way to my dorm. It was dark and I saw my friend Kayla standing outside on the corner talking to someone. I walked by and said hello to her, and then realized it was Stephen she was talking to. I couldn't do it...I couldn't just walk by. So we talked about everyone coming and how much longer till they would arrive. Kayla excused herself and I just couldn't walk away....so I invited Stephen on a walk. He agreed. I could see in his eyes that his heart was breaking like mine, but he had done a much better job creating a tough exterior.&nbsp; The whole time my heart was screaming to be his again. To wake up from this torture and let him love me. I was gripped by the fear that maybe we would get too good at living without each other and I would never be with him again. That even though Jesus had said it was him, that He was leading us into unrepairable territory.&nbsp; I panicked. <br />That weekend both of our friends and a few others close to us gave their lives to Jesus. I was amazed!! We had called a truce for the weekend as not to distract our friends from absorbing what God had brought them for. We were reminded how great of a team we were when we worked together. When he hugged me I knew I couldn't ever let him go again. That didn't make the rest of the semester easy though.&nbsp;We still tried to maintain independence and distance but cut out the silent complete avoidance. It was hard to stand in a group of his new friends and have them try to tell me how well they knew him. It was hard to be &quot;just friends&quot;&nbsp;when we had never been &quot;just friends&quot; . We went from &quot;eh yeah I know of her/him&quot; to a bond that is commonly known as &quot;soul mate&quot; the year we went to C.I.T. camp. (Which was over a year before any hint or thought of &quot;hey I kinda might like like them!&quot; happened) <br />By November both of us were frustrated. We felt like our hearts had already firmly declared that we were &quot;The One!!!&quot; but but masks on for the rest of the world and pretended to be something we weren't. We had many conversations with our parents, leaders, and close friends and each other. We got to be really honest about a lot of things and worked through a lot. With much prayer and debate, and to the joyous blessing of some, and major hesitation for others, we decided to get married over Christmas break!!! (before you freak out remember we talked A&nbsp;LOT!&nbsp;) We planned out the date, our new apartment, and everything else for the the spring semester before we went on Thanksgiving Break. But because the ring he had picked out months before this was in PA&nbsp;he wouldn't let me tell anyone until I came back with the rock on my finger. <br /><br />We drove together to Thanksgiving and stayed at my parents house like we had done for years. On Thanksgiving he allowed me to tell our families because I couldn't contain it, and we wanted them to be able to plan! After eating with his side of the family his mom and I spent a few hours pouring over ideas for decorating the rehearsal and reception. Black Friday my mom and I went shopping and found the majoring of what we needed for the January 2nd date!! Stephen spent the day with his parents. When mom and I got home Stephen asked if he could take me on a date to dinner. I was really excited!&nbsp;I got dressed and as he helped me put on my coat I asked if our parents were coming. They all agreed so we all went to the &quot;new&quot; local pizza place. When we walked in we had the place to ourselves and they had decorated for Christmas. We all had a great meal and Stephen and I&nbsp;picked out some songs on the jukebox. I was enjoying the moments and soooo eager for him to officially propose. After the meal we all returned home. Our moms set to work formulating the guest list and addressing invitations for us. Stephen asked what I was gonna do. I couldn't prevent a look of dejection flashing on my face but I allowed myself to be patient and wait for him. I said I could help with the invitations. He chuckled and said that he had a hankering to try my hand at chess and invited me to join him. I glowingly accepted. We went up to my bedroom/apartment and began playing. I&nbsp;have a glass set that was set up on a small round glass topped table. The heater was on and Christmas lights provided a nice glow around us. I&nbsp;played horribly because I was so excited. I was also trying to keep my mind from trying to figure out how he was going to pop the question. Had he hidden the ring inside a piece?&nbsp;Was he going to open the box under the table and see how long it took me to notice? Why were we playing chess anyway??&nbsp; He was drinking in everything he saw in my eyes. A few times he made the &quot;I Love You&quot;&nbsp;sign with his hand under the table and watched me finally focus through the table to see it instead of focusing on the pieces. I thought I would fly away from all the butterflies fluttering.&nbsp; After a while I started to notice that this game was going incredibly long. Surely he could have beaten me by now....ah there it is the kill sho.....my turn??? He sacrificed his queen only to march a pawn to my side gaining him his queen back. I was down to a few (or maybe even two) pieces and I was starting to get frustrated. Why wouldn't this game end already?!?! Then he did it again!&nbsp;Another pawn across. But as I went to give him a piece he said &quot;No...not that one&quot;&nbsp; Still looking down I reached for another piece. I could feel his smile fill the room as he reached across the table holding a ring. He asked, &quot;&nbsp;Erin, Will you be the Queen to my Castle?&quot; &nbsp; I froze and looked up. His smile so wide and his eyes full of hope, love, and anticipation. Instantly my smile broke out! This was it. The moment I had been waiting for!! Of course I said Yes!!!!!<br /><br />To Be Continued......<br /></em>"

At first you hear overtones of anger, frustration, bitterness, maybe even a little of pride coming through. But as you listen for seconds longer, you hear the undertones of sheer terror ringing through. I haven't felt safe or secure. Much less loved and chosen. </em><br /> <em>I'm really starting to see the places that I have depended on other people for that. Especially Stephen in our relationship. Something about the way he loves me, and physically wraps his arms around me, calms my frantic heart. Problem is, right now Jesus is leading me into the desert to betroth me to Himself in love and faithfulness not anyone else. There will be a day when He will provide a husband for me and give me back physical comfort but not until I am firmly secure in Jesus alone. </em><br /> <br /> <em>On Thursday night I was so frustrated because I wanted what I couldn't have. I&nbsp;thought I knew best what I needed and what would make me feel better and I couldn't have it. So I threw a fit and acted out. I gave into the thoughts and stupid ideas I've been struggling with and acted out. But I didn't just act out a little...it's like I skipped all the incremental stages and went to the top of my acting out without involving anyone else...the place where it cuts the deepest. Right back to the heart of my old life. The good news is it didn't remotely satisfy anything. Not even for a second. It was disgusting to me....and I kept going. When I tried to sleep a war raged over who/what could lay claim to me. Voices flooded my head that I was worthless, disgusting, a failure, etc etc. I tried to speak the truth and reach out to Jesus and stand in His Truth but the problem was I was buying into the lies. </em><br /> <br /> <em>In my addiction I've moved from &quot;I can handle this. I'm still in control. Sure I pick it every time but I'm the one picking it.&quot;&nbsp;to experiencing withdrawal from not picking. This is a great revelation!&nbsp;It shows me that I am on the track to healing as well as seeing all this for what it really is....an addiction. Yes friends, I&nbsp;am a sex addict. Turns out sex addiction comes out in many many different ways. Excessive fantasy, unhealthy relationships, pornography, masturbation etc etc. Actually having sex is just one small part. Also what I'm learning is that the absence of symptoms and acting out isn't the same this as recovery.&nbsp; Part of my journey this summer is to realize what I carry and why I do what I do and the best part is that Jesus is healing me of it. Things that have been apart of me since I was sexually abused as a child can be faced, dealt with, and no longer have to have any affect, hold, or influence over me! But like any addiction things have to get really hard before they are okay. Ask anyone going through withdrawal....it's not fun. Thankfully Jesus has the best resources...Himself and He puts himself right in the middle of it with me. </em><br /> <br /> <em>So last night after trying to talk to some of my leaders and them reminding me that Jesus is the one who can bring Peace to my chaos, security to my sense of abondonment, and love to my fear, I&nbsp;started to ask Him where He was while I am that girl screaming louder and louder. It wasn't a question asked in bitterness but of honest seeking. If Truth is really True whether I believe it is or not, and He speaks the Truth over me that I am His, I am forgiven completely, that I&nbsp;am Pure, that I am Loved, Chosen, Cared for, Delighted In, Given the same power that raised Christ from the dead to live in me, given everything I need to conquer these voices that rage&hellip;. How do I get from where I am in this crazy dark place back to being rooted in that? His reply? &ldquo;How about you call for me?&rdquo; So then this little girl standing there alone screaming and so terrified suddenly screamed &ldquo;JEEESUSSSS!!!&rdquo; With just as much intensity, terror, and volume as before. All of a sudden Jesus caught me. He just swooped in and swiftly picked me up. The intensity of it physically &nbsp;brought tears to my eyes and I started taking quick short breaths and shaking. He covered me in His arms and held me so close to His chest and started rubbing His hand on my head and whispering to me &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got you </em></i></span><i><em><st1:place w:st=""on""><span style=""color: rgb(51, 102, 255);"">Erin</span></st1:place><span style=""color: rgb(51, 102, 255);"">. It&rsquo;s okay now, shhh, I&rsquo;ve got you. You&rsquo;re safe. I love you. I found you, you&rsquo;re safe shhh&rdquo; To my surprise His heart was beating fast like mine. I could feel all of His muscles so tense and alert too. He was breathing heavy like I was and His eyes were wide and on alert around us, and yet His whole attention was on me. See for some reason I was convinced that if I called for Him He would come sure, but He would waltz in, calm and like it was no big deal. He might hug me but it would a squeeze and then something like &ldquo;Hey you know I love you. What&rsquo;s up? Stop this craziness&rdquo; HA So not Jesus.&nbsp; He was frantically searching for me too. Finding me and reaching me was all that was on His mind. For me I was a little girl&hellip;for Him I was HIS Little Girl. I wasn&rsquo;t in a safe place at all and He knew it and He was just as focused at getting me out. </span><o:p></o:p></em></i></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""color: rgb(51, 102, 255);""><em><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></em></span><em><o:p></o:p></em></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""color: rgb(51, 102, 255);""><em>Tonight I was still a little off. I felt relief from His rescue, but something wasn&rsquo;t letting me settle there. I went to church tonight but I felt really off. Like I was there but not me. Of course, we were talking about Love tonight. Go figure!! I got there a couple min. late and by the time I got into the auditorium they were singing a song by Jesus Culture about how Jesus is the same, His love is the same and steady, and that even when there is pain Joy comes in the morning and even when there is pain we don&rsquo;t have to fear. Then they went into &ldquo;He Loves Us&rdquo; by Jesus Culture. I just started crying. My mind flooded with June 17 2009 and everything revolving around my baptism. That experience of being absolutely covered and washed in the Truth that He loves ME and those I love. So many amazing miracles happened that night. I cried because I knew I wasn&rsquo;t living this moment in that Truth. As I sat through service I was listening, and taking an inventory within. I was practicing what I was going to say to the people that I was going to seek out after service. Once again, Jesus was like &ldquo;Umm&hellip;how about you talk to me first instead of them?&rdquo; Therefore, I asked Him why I didn&rsquo;t feel like me. Why I felt like I was off stuck in this section of myself that didn&rsquo;t know the Truth of me. I wanted to get back to that deep core place where I can connect to Jesus and experience Him. Jesus answered, &ldquo;</em></span><em><st1:place w:st=""on""><span style=""color: rgb(51, 102, 255);"">Erin</span></st1:place><span style=""color: rgb(51, 102, 255);"">, I don&rsquo;t want to get you out of this part of you that doesn&rsquo;t know me, and leave it not knowing me. I want every part of you to Know me. I don't want you to ever experience this life without me.&rdquo; Me: &ldquo;Wait&hellip;Jesus you want this nasty place?&rdquo; Him: &ldquo;Yes </span><st1:place w:st=""on""><span style=""color: rgb(51, 102, 255);"">Erin</span></st1:place><span style=""color: rgb(51, 102, 255);""> I want it.&rdquo; Me: &ldquo;Okay Jesus I want you to have it too.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then the weirdest thing happened&hellip;. He planted His flag in the middle of the nasty place and claimed the land for His own. Everything changed!! A smile broke across my face as I started being filled with the Truth of His love. </span><o:p></o:p></em></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""color: rgb(51, 102, 255);""><em><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></em></span><em><o:p></o:p></em></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""color: rgb(51, 102, 255);""><em>I still have a long way to go. I&rsquo;m better but I know there are more territories to conquer. I want Him to do it. I do want Him to be in every part of me so I can authentically rest in His love. I&rsquo;m still searching for how to physically relax and rest. I&rsquo;m convinced I need someone else to be with me. To sooth me, to be a guard that I can trust in to protect me while I let my guard down. But if I can&rsquo;t trust Jesus with that too then I&rsquo;m playing god and limiting Him in my life and taking control. We all see where control has led me before. &gt;_&lt;. So I&rsquo;m learning to step out into deeper relationship and Trust Jesus to be my rear guard, my strong tower, my fortress, my hiding place, my protector, and my Lover. The best part is, those are all things He wants to be for me, and has promised for centuries that He is! It isn&rsquo;t something He needs to learn how to do for me, it&rsquo;s already who He is! </em></span><em><o:p></o:p></em></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""color: rgb(51, 102, 255);""><em><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></em></span><em><o:p></o:p></em></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><o:p><span style=""color: rgb(51, 102, 255);"">&nbsp;</span></o:p></p><span style=""color: rgb(51, 102, 255);"">  <em><br /></em><br /></span>"

"event","<em>First off, I wanted to remind you that even if you don't have a livejournal account you can still comment on any entry =) <br /><br />So today I had my car towed because it wouldn't start yesterday. All day i was wondering if I should go and try it again before I called the tow truck because come on, how embarrassing would that be for it to start right up? Then I reasoned that even if it did start i don't trust it, and I knew that the tow truck would take a little bit of time to get there and I didn't want to be forced to entertain the girls waiting in a parking lot, or impose on Luke to let us crash his apartment again. So I called the two truck, tried to give them directions (which they didn't take &gt;_&lt;), and then left the house with the girls to meet the truck where my car was sitting. Sure enough I had to meet the truck elsewhere and lead it into the development because it's so new that GPS systems don't have it programmed in as a housing development. Sure enough my car started right up. I insisted we continue to have it towed because I had a car to borrow, towing was free, and I wanted to make darn sure everything was okay before I put the girls back in it. I also knew I needed to get the oil changed in it as well so the trip wouldn't be a total waste. When the wonderful tow truck driver when to start the car to get it off the truck it sputtered a bit before starting..so we'll see what's up. I also asked them to take a look at my air-conditioning systerm, air fan, and maybe even find out why it doesn't always accelerate without feathering the gas pedal. My car is like me...it has fun quirks =)<br /><br />When the girls and I got home we played outside. Their step-dad brought home a scooter and kids baseball bat/baseballs, and new bubbles this week. I was trying to teach the older one how to swing a bat. She was doing pretty good and even hit the ball a few times. The problem with baseball though is that there are soooo many variables!!! Both the pitcher and the batter need to be good in order for things to happen.&nbsp; I got to thinking how great it would be to have a tee and started looking around for something I could use. I couldn't find anythign outside so I went inside.....then I noticed it. A cereal box that was almost empty!&nbsp;I took out the plastic bag and flattened out the box. I began rolling the cardboard into a tube and then tapped it together. It made more of a rounded triangle instead of a circle but it worked!!&nbsp;The triangle helped the tube to stand on its own while holding the ball. It was just the right size when I set the tube ontop of a rolling cooler. I was so stinkin' proud of myself!! =) <br /><br />Random thoughts:<br />I love the colors that radiate when you make bubbles in the sunlight. Man they are the best!&nbsp;The colors are bright and intense, yet sheer at the same time. Love it! <br /><p>Why why why do people put windows in bathrooms?&nbsp;Is it really nessecary? <br /><br />&nbsp;</p></em><br />"

"event","<em>It's a rainy day in Kentucky and halfway through it my car decided to stop turning on. Thankfully we were able to get home safe via a friend and I have a car that I can use for a day or so until I get things straightened out. <br />I'm&nbsp; very pensive at the moment and my first reaction was to drown my mind in a silly tv show. Then, I decided to try and write and try to untangle some of the thoughts in my head. <br /><br />Last night Stephen and I played a fun little game over the phone that was really fun for me. Basically it was self-discovery and he knows me so well and helped me understand some of my fun quirks. I think it started out kinda like trivia about me and kept getting deeper.&nbsp; One of the questions was why do I like to wear long sleeves or a jacket even when it's summer?&nbsp;The answer is in two parts. I'm pretty sensitive to air-conditioning and get cold easily, and I like the security I feel when my hands are touching something like the cuffs of a jacket. I feel more confident and less awkward when I'm standing talking to someone cause I can put my hands in the pocket of my jacket and it's a relaxed non-threatening pose. Crossing your arms can be misinterpreted and putting your hands in pants pockets can feel weird and can be misread also. &nbsp;<br />I'm huge into security. I've always been a blanket girl. Ever since I was little I had my baby blanket (still do actually!) that went pretty much everywhere with me, and at least was always in my bed at night. I don't always hold it, but it's usually close. Now I've expanded my preferences to pretty much all blankets. I loved it when Stephen trusted me with his blanket to take to KY for a bit. It was gold to me. <br /></em><br /><em>My mind keeps coming back to wanting to be in a hammock. </em><em>I really don't fully understand why either. I've had mixed experiences with hammocks and most of the time they don't support my back well. </em><em>Yet, I&nbsp;keep finding myself desiring them. I asked Stephen in a trivia sort of way why I want one so badly. When I asked I&nbsp;didn't know the answer at all but as we both got to thinking about it I realized some of it. </em><em>Hammocks are iconic of relaxation. You will often see hammocks dominantly displayed in vacation ads and the image of summer relaxation. </em><em>I'm still holding tension even without trying. I'm deeply desiring to relax and so somewhere in my head the connection is being made that a hammock is the answer.&nbsp;&nbsp; It also may be a bit of wanting to be somewhere other than where I am in that moment also. <br /></em><br /><em>My eyes are so full of thoughts but none of them want to be untangled and sorted out. <br /><br />I thought I lost my check card. I've been looking all over for it for days and then decided to go ahead and cancel the card just in case I lost it somewhere public, and to get a new one. Sure enough after I canceled it...I found it. &gt;_&lt; Oh it burns. </em><br /><br /><em>I still want something....like I feel this need within me that I can't identify. </em> <em>I've had great time with Jesus and even with other people but something isn't getting hit.

"event","<em>Tonight is one of those nights that I feel like I have a million thoughts running through my head at once. Of course they are from all different types of categories too.&nbsp; So be prepared for random comments signaled by a number. =) <br /><br />1)&nbsp;Someday on a married relaxed date night (just like a jeans and cute shirt kinda night)&nbsp;I want to engage in a serious kiss for every red light we have to stop for. Not just one or two but for the evening every red light. Just for the fun of it. <br /><br />Jesus has really been opening my heart lately and bringing some very gross places into the light. bleck. It's been difficult to face some of the places where my heart as really been, but at the same time it feels so good to get it exposed to the light and begin healing. <br />Stephen and I have given each other the summer to be apart and really run deeper into God alone. It's been really good, really challenging, and down right difficult at times. We knew God was asking us to, and of course my leaders have been asking this of me for all most a year. God has been doing some great exposing work in being separated. He's shown me where my &quot;want tos&quot; just haven't been enough. It's been really discouraging at times to face the places that once again I really messed things up. He's revealing the places that I got ahead of Stephen and didn't follow his leadership well at all. Some of those places have some pretty hefty consequences. (like over $1,000 I now owe my sister....don't ask!) I know that I love Stephen and it sucks to have revealed to me just how unable to love I still am. The greatest part though is that Jesus doesn't leave me in it. He doesn't reveal it to me to rub my nose in it and banish me to &quot;screw up land&quot; forever. No, He takes my hand and walks me through all of it and then walks me into His plan for freedom from the yuck. He is teaching me how to love better and to follow well. I know He is doing the same thing for Stephen.&nbsp; <br />I know in a few years we are going to look back fondly at this time of growing and discovering ourselfs.... but it's hard in the here and now. I miss my friend. He's always been more than a friend to me. I really miss his eyes and smile and the way he smells and feels safe. <br />....but that's all mushy stuff you probably don't care to read about. <br />Okay...<br /><br />2)&nbsp;I miss cheerleading <br />No like really I do alot. I miss it. I miss the cheers, the moves, the dancing, the jumps, the uniforms... I don't miss the drama for sure!! I really liked it. Maybe because it's something I've wanted to do for so long, or maybe because it gave me the freedom of being loud and preppy and having an excuse for it. Maybe its cause I loved the attention the shock brought. For whatever reason I miss it...a ton. I'm not sure what to do about it either. I haven't forgotten how my school work kinda suffered with the late late nights. Or how i didn't put enough of me into it to actually do it well. I remember the aches and pains from not really working out. I&nbsp;remember the feelings of failure. I&nbsp;remember how I was really excited and then kinda hid through it at the end. But I do miss it. This coming year is my senior year. I would LOVE&nbsp;LOVE LOVE to have a senior night with a team. (and not be encased in plastic and doped up on pain killers like I was for my senior night of marching band just weeks after my second back surgery) But senior year also requires senior level classes, and I'm going to be SLA. Sure overacheivers can do it no sweat, but that hasn't exactly been in my track record. (Although...I think my best year grade wise was the year I cheered...hmmm) Something to keep praying out. <br /><br />3)&nbsp;I hate hate HATE the taste of wood. You know...like those happy little sticks of wood that people put inside frozen treats like icecream and popsicles?&nbsp;Or the wonderful tongue depressor doctors use to check your throat?&nbsp;Yup I hate them. I gag even just thinking about it. Stephen has tormented me before by chewing on one. *shudders*&nbsp;Even watching someone else makes me gag. I'm reminded of this because after a long time I decided to enjoy an M&amp;M&nbsp;ice cream bar. (Vanilla Ice Cream coated in choc. and a candy outer layer)&nbsp;It was sooo good and then I got to the stick and gagged. *sigh* &nbsp;<br /><br />4) I think I've decided to pursue Occupational Therapy as a career. =) <br /><br />5) I'm getting my hair cut soon. Yeah I'm really excited. It's going to be lots of different. I really hope it turns out well. <br /><br />6) I'm getting better, but my brain and my life still aren't quite connected. I have huge dreams and plans and ideas and goals and even a plan to work them out. But when the rubber meets the road I'm the opposite of skidmarks. I want to be better. I want to look better, feel better, study better. I&nbsp;want to have less guilt over things I should be doing and have more time for activites for me. I want to pour myself into something and do my best, and at the end know I did everything I could have done. I want to be connected in a way that I feel alive and vibrant. I want to be secure in myself to be one unified person that's the same in most situations. I want to give my husband something to pursue and cherish. I want to be all that I can be....and be happy. <br /></em><br />"

"event","&nbsp;A few years ago when I worked at Wesley Woods they had a notebook for all of us to write any ideas we had for new camps. I couldn't really think of anything good but it has always stuck in the back of my head to think of one.&nbsp; It's been fun to see how some of those ideas have actually come to fruition while others really just caused a good laugh. This week even Stephen is Deaning a brand new camp. This week I've had some conversations with various people that I knew from Camp, or somehow our conversations made me think of camp. As I was driving home tonight I had an idea. <br />I want to create a camp for youth (probably a focus on girls) who have been sexually abused. A week to get it out, empower them, and begin a course of healing instead of destruction. The problem?&nbsp;How to make it known. &quot;Sexual Abuse Camp&quot; wouldn't get a bunch of hits I'm guessing, and the ones who really need to be there aren't just going to go up to their mom and be like &quot;Oh yeah mom I want to go to this new camp 'cause, oh yeah dad's been molesting me.&quot;&nbsp; So how do you make it known to the people who really need it, while having a good safe cover to protect their confidentiality. It's also not something that you really want to have broadcast every meal either if it had to be located at main camp. (At the meals one of the staff calls out each camp by name for when to come get their food.) <br /><br /><p>It's a scary topic and one that does have lots of consequences. But does it have to keep being something that comes out at camp anyway, only to counselors who often times aren't prepared for it, or even quite know how to handle it the best way possible? Does have to be something that keeps getting halfway dealt with?&nbsp;</p><p>I'm kinda excited to see where this idea might go....</p><br />"

"event","Hi!!<br />Wow I can't believe I've only been back in KY for two weeks! The word I keep coming back to is lavish. I told Val (my roommate at Asbury) last week that I feel like a pauper that just traded places with the prince. (more on that in a min.) <br /> <br />When I left PA I called Val and asked if I could stay the weekend with her (her mom and sisters live in Lexington) until I figured out where I was going to stay permanently. Turns out I'm going to be staying here! I've been given her oldest sister's room (She lives in Louisville now) with a wonderful full bed. There isn't a ton of room for stuff and I'm still trying to work out a plan for clothes but hey it will come. So I don't have to worry about rent or anything! Her youngest sister just graduated from High School the weekend I got here. She will be going to Guatemala for the summer so it was just going to be Val and her mom anyways. Their Dad came (He lives and works in Ukraine) for graduation and he is staying for the week until they go for their annual vacation to the beach in Washington.&nbsp; He took everyone out to eat after graduation and I was invited to come. When everyone else left for the graduation they all had super cute summer dresses on and all looked nice. I was excited for the oppurtunity for a dress up night too! I went a found a dress I liked. As mom knows I kinda got a little skittish and hesitant wondering if I could actually wear it. Almost like I didn't believe that I could wear something cute and summery even though other people do all the time...like I didn't deserve it. After about an hour of debate, and two phone calls I went for it. I'm so glad I did! Various people were commenting all night, as well as Val's family.&nbsp; <br /> Oh yeah, so guess where we went for dinner? A restaurant called &quot;The Melting Pot&quot;, aka Fondue!! Oh man it was sooo good. We went for the full four course meal complete with two kinds of melted cheese, a salad of your choice, an entree loaded with fillet Mignon chunks, marinated/seasoned chicken, shrimp, etc etc, with two choices to cook them in, and dessert was two different kinds of chocolate fondue with cheesecake, marshmallows, brownies, cake, and rice cake pieces to dip. Everything was amazing!! I was nervous at first that the food would be &quot;high class&quot; and seasoned in a way I wasn't used to and wouldn't like, but everything I tried was so good. <br /> All six of us had an amazing time. Sometimes I get a little nervous around Val's family, but last night we all had great conversation. Her dad and I even got to talk a lot. The whole night God was just wrapping His arms around me and reassuring me that I'm loved, that I belong here, and He has such a lavish heart for me. Being on my own I would never have been able to experience such a restaurant, or get to know these people even better. He is teaching me that I can be confident in who I am and the way He made me. I don't have to fit some mold or stay away from something because someone else did it. I can be me...quirky, odd, beautiful me.&nbsp; =)<br /> <br />When I left PA&nbsp; to drive back to KY I had a very bittersweet heart. I didn't want to leave my family, the comforts of resting after surgery, and especially Stephen. At the same time Jesus was speaking reassurance into my heart that it was time to go and there was so much waiting for me in KY. Stephen and I both got into our cars and drove together until our routes split. He called me and we encouraged each other, fought tears together, and prayed together for each other. After we hung up, I was misty eyed and fighting tears until I was well into Ohio. As I was driving South in Ohio and the sun was setting to my right. It was a beautiful sunset with bright colors that stretched across the sky. I did a quick head nod and &quot;Atta Boy God&quot; and kept driving. He so softly told me that He had painted that sunset for me. My cynical response was &quot;oh get real. I know better. It's not for me if it happens like that all the time. it's just the way you put it in motion so long ago. It happens all the time and the colors are just the way the light reflects in the atmosphere at various angles...yadda yadda..&quot; His reply? &quot;Erin I didn't have to make it that beautiful tonight. It could have been a dark dreary clouded day or duller colors. I didn't have to make it like this. But I knew you were coming and I wanted to show you that I love you and I'm honored by your obedience. It's for you&quot;. <br /> <br />On Sunday I went to Quest and was almost immediatly met by Whitney and Becca, two of my best friends here. We were all on the serving team together last year. I don't usually get to sit in service with Becca and it's a great gift when I do. (For those of you who have watched, Becca is a singer with short black hair done in a faux hauk.) She really has been gifted with a beautiful voice and I love getting to worship with her and hear her sing. The service was based on Eph. 3:16-21 titled &quot;Rooted&quot;. (If you haven't seen it yet please go online and watch. It is amazing!! <a href=""http://www.aspireonemedia.com/mediaPlayer/playerHome.asp?cid=114"" target=""_blank"">http://www.aspireonemedia.com/<wbr></wbr>mediaPlayer/playerHome.asp?<wbr></wbr>cid=114</a> ) The point was being rooted in God's love and experiencing for yourself just how lavish that love really is. In the service they performed a song called &quot;Love Lockdown&quot; by Kanye West. (I reccommed the Quest version rather than the popular one. I also attached the lyrics of the song in this e-mail)&nbsp; In essece talking about how when you keep your love locked down you are the one that looses, and aren't able to love like you want to. That sums up why I'm here this summer. In the service I just cried realizing that. All year I have been controlling and restricting the love I give as well as how much love I will receive. I've been limiting God in my life to certain areas. It also speaks to my relationship with Stephen...I love him so very very much but I know something isn't quite right in my heart yet. <br /> Anyway, it was one of those services where it seemed like it was written for me. Jesus was saying &quot;I know what it cost you to get here, and I want to make it abundantly clear that you are doing the right thing and I have so much for you&quot; <br /> <br /><br />On Monday I got to meet Chrissie and Karoline. Karoline is the one who called me asking if I was interested in taking over her job of being a Nanny to two young girls full time. Chrissie is the mother of the girls, Reece and Maddox. We all talked for two hours! It went very well and we arranged for me to meet the girls on Tuesday. They are wonderful girls!! I love that I've gotten to meet this family. On Wednesday I started on my own. I'm learning just how long 10 hours can really be. =)&nbsp; Reece turns 5 soon and Maddox is 3 1/2. They are very intelligent girls which is great. They still have their &quot;child&quot; moments but we are learning with each other what we all expect. We've gotten to do fun things like build realistic looking block animals, play dress up, read books (not excactly their favorite though..sad), color, make jello, color with sidewalk chalk, and run some errands, just to name a few.&nbsp; It is such a responsiblity to be an influence to such a tender age. I'm asking to learn a balance of selflessness on my part and making sure I have what I need to be the best I can be. I have already developed a love for these girls. =) A few weeks ago when I decided I was going to come back to KY I started making a list of my goals for this summer. One of the main ones being to learn to relax in who I am and rediscover my childlike joy in the world around me and learn to have fun again. What better way to do this that to spend 10 hours a day with two young children full of imagination? =)&nbsp; <br /> <br />In summery (Ha!) I am blown away by the lavish way God is providing for all my needs. When I left PA last week I didn't know for sure where I would live, or work, or eat or anything. By being obedient to God and letting Him pick, I've landed in places I could have never gotten to on my own. I'm in a community I couldn't have created if I had tried. I'm really amazed. <br /> A next step that He has asked me to take in obedience is to be baptized. I know this can be a mixed up topic, but for me it's affirming the decision my parents made when I was an infant to be baptized and agreeing and making the choice for myself. It's also going public to share what God has done in my life and participating in the symbolic act representing that I went from death to life because of Jesus. It will be on Wednesday June 17th starting at 6:30pm. Honestly, this wasn't excactly when I wanted to do this. Ever since last April I've been waiting for the &quot;right moment&quot;. I know this is big and I wanted it to be big and perfect. I wanted to have my family with me and for it to be a wide tool of influence.I wanted to be baptized with Stephen. But the more Jesus and I have talked about it He showed me that that is all preference and control. All that is bringing glory to me and not fully to Him. It's making a show and bringing attention to myself. He told me that because it's not how I want it go....it's just the right time. This way the glory really goes to Him and I give Him the control to use my story how He wants, not how I want. Very humbling for sure. Since I've said yes I'm getting more and more excited about it. Just like this summer where when i left I had no clue what to expect and how amazing it's been since, I can't wait to see what happens!!! Please pray that I am fully yielded to God and ready to receive all that He has for me in this. I wish I could promise that it will be broadcast online, but this is an outdoor baptism and they still haven't figured out how to get it to work yet. They are trying like crazy and I'd love for this to be the first. This too is helping me learn to be very okay with just being rooted in Jesus, and not needing Jesus and....._________ to be okay in life. Everything that goes in the blank is a blessing and wonderful gift that God provides along the journey of life, but can not be what sustains me fully."

"event","Spring break went really well. I was able to sit down with my parents and have the much needed conversation. It was a bit humorous actually....we were sitting in a quiet restaurant and I couldn't hold it in any longer. I took a deep breath and told that I had screwed up. My mom (who is sitting beside me) punched my arm and almost yelled &quot;Yeah!&nbsp;You did!!&quot; I was very shocked to say the least!! I&nbsp;hadn't said anything yet!! She promptly pulled me close and hugged me tightly. We were all able to talk freely and openly together for the rest of the week and it was a wonderful blessing. 

Oh man was it a crazy week!! My sister, two of her girls, my mom, and I all needed dresses to wear to my brother's wedding in April. The girls are the flower girls on top of it all. We went all over the place shopping! Mom and Bridget finally found dresses, but in the end Bridget and I are going to make the flower girls dresses and mine by hand. I get to work on mine over Easter Break. I'm really excited. It's a simple pattern but it should look really good. I think I would really enjoy learning to make my own clothes. It's cheaper that way too!! I really enjoyed the time I got to spend with my sister and my mom. I felt like a family again. Even my dad was pretty sweet to be around. (He even did little preparations for me to come home!&nbsp;It warmed my heart so much to learn he had turned my heater on in my room for me!!) 


Today my heart is a bit heavy. For a little bit there has been hope that Stephen and I would be able to be together in one place for an extended period of time very soon. There was even a bit of talk of marrying sooner rather than later. But it just doesn't seem to be in the cards yet. I trust God fully and I've been spending a great deal of time with Him these last two weeks. I've been pouring through scripture and my devotions and have really felt his presence so close. We sought wise counsel and they came back saying that Stephen should go to Warren as soon as possible and establish his end of the business on his own and I can come later. They also think I should stay at Asbury. I really understand and see where they are coming from. I really do. The problem is I feel called to do the opposite. Stephen and I desire to go to Warren together from the start. To work together and settle into Warren as our home from the very beginning. We feel sure that even though money appears to be unstable we are called to Trust God and rely on Him to provide for us. They don't see it that way. So we chose to submit to the wise counsel we sought out and obey them. There is a peace that God sees that and Honors it, but it still aches. I will not just walk away and do my own thing. We set out to seek their wisdom not advice. 
I guess today I feel like Caleb and Joshua. They went into the promised land and got to see it, taste it, hear it, smell it etc first hand. Sure they saw the Giants but knew that the Lord was faithful with His promises and trusted in Him to continue to work out those promises. They didn't down play the size of the giants, or of their God. They came out so excited and ready to go. What happened?&nbsp;They were out voted and exiled to the wilderness with the rest of them. Even though they didn't waiver. I can imagine Caleb's (I'm not quite sure why I keep identifying with Caleb more than Joshua....something I'll look into more I suppose) heart as he had to walk away from the Land he knew was given to him by God. I can see him lingering in the back of the people, slowing walking, and looking over his shoulder with a tear in his eye and an ache in his heart. Granted, there was hope knowing that one day he would be granted permission to return but it seemed so far away at that moment when the fruit was still lingering on his lips. 
Or, do I have it all wrong?&nbsp;Was there an ache in his heart, maybe. But was what he had experienced so good that he knew whatever he had to endure to get back there would be worth it because it was that good? Did those 40 years pass quickly for him because of the anticipation and excitement to get to return?&nbsp; Hmmm

I'm really okay to wait to marry him. It's hard because I saw a real possiblity of it happening and I was excited, but I know those are some of the plans for me so it wasn't no but wait. I can wait. It's worth it. =) 

What I'm not sure about is staying at Asbury. Home was safe and wonderful. I don't feel settled at Asbury anymore. I'm actually struggling alot. Now, I just want to go home. I looked at transfering and looked at Pitt Bradford. They have a Psych program that looks more like what I want to do. But does the grass just look greener on the other side of the fence? Come on, I only have 1 year left at Asbury.&nbsp; What am I doing wrong?&nbsp; 
Argh more on this later."

I went to church last night was met with an amazing teaching on &quot;Blessed are the Pure in heart for they will see God.&quot; (Matt. 5:8) We talked about Pure being both Clean, and Unmixed.&nbsp; Afterwards I got to talk with a semi-leader of mine. (Jesus gives her amazing words for me and insights but she isn't a full time leader over me. We just get to live life together and I love it!) She didn't throw in her input of how she thought the details of this week should go but really challenged me to really look at what was going on and why I could trust my leaders with somethings but not this? I realized that I was resisting my leaders in the same way that Stephen is kinda resisting what I see and hear for Him. I'm asking him to trust me and trust what my eyes see even though his don't. Yet, my leaders are asking me to do the same thing. Funny how Jesus works like that. <br /><br />Today I have been so desperate for Jesus. I've felt so close to Him, and so desperate. I needed to hear His voice and His voice alone. In our sweet time I realized, well okay, He let me see that it's not about picking sides. It's not about my plan against their plan. It's about surrendering to Jesus and staying so close to Him that I&nbsp;wait for HIS go whenever that is, and how ever it looks. It's not just about me and that's what I've been making this....all about me. It's about my parents hearts and everyone elses hearts (including mine) being in the right place for all this. Only Jesus knows when that is. Not me. I can't lead this. I desire to be so close to his Heart that he can whisper so softly in my ear and I respond instantly. It's not about my plan. <br />I re-read my last post and got to the part where I said something along the lines of I&nbsp;still have my plan but I'm ready to listen to him. HA. I have so much to learn still. I&nbsp;see that still having my plan is arrogant.&nbsp;<br /><br />Thankfully Jesus is really jealous for me and won't relent until everything I am is safe in Him. I opened this entry with two songs that I found from Jesus Culture. We sing the second at Quest as well. The idea of Jesus being jealous for me isn't something I fully understood until these songs. Jealousy isn't exactly one of the fruits of the Spirit! I never quite understood how God could be a jealous God. I guess it was one of those things that I just chocked up to Him being God and he could do whatever He wants and someday it will make sense. lol&nbsp; But this idea that He is jealous for Me. Meaning He won't stop at anything to have me as His own. Not for control but out of a deep deep Love for me. A love so powerful and intense that many waters cannot quench it.....that God wouldn't even withhold His only Son for me. Instead God chose to Send His boy as the sacrifice to be the bridge that would runite us. And Jesus went willingly with the Same heart as the Father for that to happen.&nbsp;<br /><br />His love is ridculously amazing! It's life changing to look into the face of God and see His eyes full of delight and overflowing with Love all for you. Not because of anything you have done or haven't done but because you are&nbsp; you and He loves you. To engage in a dymanic real full personal relationship is so much different than striving for God or performing for His approval. <br /><br />Jesus isn't willing to settle when it comes to me. I'm His baby girl, His beloved bride, His lover,&nbsp;His friend, His Sister, just enough isn't enough. He pursued me relentlessly and like a perfect gentleman continues to pursue me relentessly. So this weekend isn't about me or my plans. I'm surrendering more to Him than before and waiting for His green light and permission for these conversations. If it happens great. If it happens in a way that I would have picked, great. And if it doesn't...Great. He knows what I don't, and He sees what I can't. I trust Him. I've gotten to see a few of my friends be relentlessly pursued over the last month or so. I've seen how Jesus orchestrates amazing details that no one else could that are perfectly tailored to that individual. I can't deny Him. I can't help but trust Him with all this. I've seen enough to trust Him with what I can't. <br /><br />So here I go....pressed against His heart waiting for His Go and resting in His Song of Love over me. </span><br /><br />"

"event","<span style=""color: rgb(128, 0, 128);"">Spring Break is only a few days away and I can't wait!! I'm looking forward to going home and being with my family. Here is what I'm getting into though. <br /><br />I need to have some serious conversations with people I really love and care about. It's going to be wicked hard....and so good and cleansing. See, for me my Home in PA still isn't safe. I made lots of choices in highschool that weren't good and created destruction in my family. I separated myself from my parents and other people that were close to me. When I came to KY I just left everything in PA and ran from it. The problem has been that things don't just vanish when you leave them....they stay there waiting for you. There have been many hard times of traveling home and colliding with that old life that it chewed me up and spit me back out. The great news is that Jesus has been doing a great work in me here and getting to face some of that old life and deal with it instead of ignoring it. I've also gotten to do the hard work of coming back to those close to me and getting to confess my sin and restore authenticity again. This next week is another step in doing that. <br />Last time I was home I once again, made some not good choices and now I get to go home and do the work to make right. It's weird, but I'm really really excited about it! I've really been feeling the effects of being inauthentic&nbsp; again and hiding to those I love and It doesn't set like it used to. It's not okay with me to live like this. I&nbsp;need to be known completely. <br /><br />The problems this week have been facing tension with my wise counsel here as to exactly go about that. I have my idea of what I want to do and how I want to go about doing this work confessing and being authentic, and they have what they think should happen. Both of us of course believe we are hearing from Jesus.&nbsp; <br />It all hit a breaking point on monday. It was one of those days where I felt I couldn't win for losing in my day. I was self-protecting and in pain. I was overwhelmed with a mountain of homework (as usual argh!!) and starting to feel really unprotected. I finally got to talk to a good friend and just be in a safe place to talk, cry, laugh, scream and explore what was really going on inside. She talked with me for a little while and then started the car and drove around to a brush dumping site and told me to get out. I&nbsp;had to get out and dump all this with Jesus. I could throw rocks, scream at the top of my lungs, climb, break branches... whatever I&nbsp;needed to do to release everything I was trying to contain in a nice neat package inside. I got out; she drove away. &nbsp; I was laughing but the idea of getting to be slightly destructive appealed to me. I turned and started walking with clenched fists and ran into Jesus with his arms wide open, a huge smile on his face, and a chuckle in his voice. We really got to spend some great time together and I got to cry and fall to my knees with him. He told me that He wants to be my defender and protector.&nbsp; Even in that moment as I was full of frustration and pain and ackwardness His eyes of love were all over me. His smile was so wide and He kept telling me that He was taking such delight in me in that moment. He reminded me that He enjoys, like really really enjoys spending time with me. Even being a mess... me.&nbsp; <br /><br />It was so wonderful to clear the junk between us and be in His Presence. I had been feeling very caged and exhasperated and it was very calming to meet with Him like that. <br /><br />Right after I met with my group and got to share with them the encounter I was glowing from. I set the stage for how I got there, and what He was saying to me, as well as my plan for next week....which they collectively balked at and insisted I was wrong.&nbsp; They want the best for me and my heart and they care so truly and deeply, but honestly in that moment I felt attacked. I started getting really really frustrated again. Through the next day I kept talking through it and even got to have an amazing conversation with my mom that reminded me who I am and she really encouraged me.&nbsp; <br /><br />After talking to mom I realized what Jesus has been trying to do. He's been using this week to break me back down to square one where I have nothing and know nothing but Christ and Him crucified. See what I've been doing is, I have my plan for this next week and I really feel that Jesus is in it. What he's been stripping me back to is realizing that even if/when I am hearing from Him and what I want IS what He wants (and when what He wants is what I want)&nbsp;He still has to be the lead on it. I still need to depend on him for everything. I&nbsp;must allow Him to lead and I must follow like my life depends on it. It doesn't matter right now specifically who is right in the details, what matters is that I am surrendered to Him completely and willing to set aside what I want for His plan. They may be the same but above all else His plan must be what we go with. This may be a &quot;duh&quot; thing, of course Jesus has to lead! But for my life in this very moment that idea is so very profound and life changing. Really freeing actually. Maybe it's another case of using simple things to confound the wise lol. Everything depends on Jesus. Everything. Cool eh? <br /><br />Even though I know this weekend is going to be very painful I seriously can not wait!&nbsp;I'm so excited to do this and to be fully clean again. i want to look different after this and I know I will. I am so eager for the tears to fall and cleanse my face, and at the end of it all to feel the embrace of my mother and father and hear the &quot;Well Done&quot; from Abba. I still have my plan, but I'm also eager to hear His voice in the moment and am ready to change course if He says so. I'm not just bulling through and hoping Jesus is comin too. I'm ready with hands open and a quiet heart, but I still believe this is the way to do it. And, I know that even if I do pick wrong and completely blow this....there is Grace. We will recover. It will be worked through and lessons learned. This doesn't have to be something that I have to perform perfectly. There is room to &quot;fail&quot; and, there is grace for it. That takes so much pressure off. <br /><br />Please pray for me that as I journey home my heart would remain soft and surrendered to Jesus. Also, that this would be a wonderful time of Healing and a taking back- reclaiming- my home as a safe place for me; a place where Jesus lives too. Pray with me that everyone else's hearts would also be open and ready for Jesus and to be open to the work that needs to be done to heal. I also really ask that this would be a time for me to truly enjoy my family. I&nbsp;really want to spend time with my mom and love on her as well as be loved by her. Pray that she has physical strength to do the activities we want to do like shop for our outfits for my brother's wedding =). She is still in the middle of chemotherapy and has her good hours of the day and her not so good hours. She won't have to take meds from tuesday on, but she will have to this weekend. I'm really pleading that this week is a week of rest for all of us and an overflowing of our love banks. <br />Stephen is also really deep in preparation to begin a new page in his life journey and it's really intimidating for sure! I'm really asking for peace, wisdom, and supernatural courage to overwhelm places of fear, insecurity, and doubt.&nbsp; <br /><br />Jesus is really on the brink of doing something large. &nbsp;The anticipation is so thick!!</span>"

"event","<span style=""color: rgb(153, 51, 102);""><font size=""2"" style=""font-family: tahoma,sans-serif;"">Hi friends :-) <br /> Hows my heart? So glad you asked :-) <br /> <br /> I got back this semester and my heart has been harder than when I left. I've been around church on Sundays and Wednesdays since I got back, but I haven't been able to reconnect.&nbsp; </font><font face=""georgia,serif"" size=""2"" style=""font-family: tahoma,sans-serif;"">On Wed. I was in service next to a friend who just buckled physically under the realization that &quot;He Loves Us&quot; (Lines of a song we sang). She was on her knees at Jesus feet and her tears were cleansing her cheeks. Me? I was standing there. I asked Jesus and he showed me that my heart and my voice were silent.&nbsp; I wasn't numb, I wasn't empty or running. Just standing there looking at him Silent. <br /> Tonight though that started to change. Throughout the week Jon Roller and Amy Roll have been wonderful at listening to Jesus and noticing me around Asbury. Tonight Amy invited me to dinner and Jesus opened some great conversations.&nbsp; Here's what He told me that began melting my heart again. <br /> <br /> I realized, I still don't know Him.&nbsp; Yes I gave my life to Christ almost a year ago and it's been wonderful and I know Him in that way, but even after a year I still don't know Him. I don't know His heart for me, I don't know His character towards me. This was really hard for me to realize. How could I not?? How could I not know Him better after all this time? Because I still don't fully know my heart and love for Him. I've been controlling how much Love I've allowed myself to have from Him.<br /> <br /> The last few months I've been putting myself in the role of street kid. The kid wandering around and seeing everyone else in families getting loved on, and occasionally getting loved on too but by someone elses dad not mine. It would be a great moment but then I'd still be off on my own watching from the outside. I've been content to eat the crumbs off the floor that fell from the table. I was happy, hey at least I was in the same room as Jesus and I could see Him. Isn't that enough? No it's not.&nbsp; Jesus isn't like Pete (my pastor in KY). I love Pete and I know that Pete knows me and Loves me dearly. With Pete though, he is one man leading lots (Likes lots of lots like thousands of lots) of people. I'm happy when I get a hug as he walks past, or a chance to give him a quick update. Mostly though, I get to learn and be with him at a distance. Jesus, Jesus on the other hand I don't have to share. He exists for me (lots of other reasons too but His life is dedicated to Me, and you, and everyone else in the entire world. It's rather neat actually). He always has His eyes on me. He will never tell me &quot;not now, I don't feel like it, I'm busy,&nbsp; Erin I'm tired,&quot; or&quot; no&quot; when I ask to spend time with Him. In reality, I'm the one only giving <i>Him</i> brief moments of my time.&nbsp; The truth is, it's not okay for me to be content to be in the same room as him with my eyes on him picking up on what bits I can. He really has a spot for me at the table right next to Him. He doesn't just want me to overhear His heart for others but to hear His heart for Me too. I don't have to follow other people to where they are being called to find Jesus (&nbsp;I'm not talking about leaders, but just other people He is drawing to Him. I don't have to just follow the road they are taking to be in His presence because they are). He is calling Me to Himself.&nbsp; Not only do I have my eyes on Him, but He has His eyes on Me.<br /> I am once again presented with the notion that Jesus himself wants to lead me. That even when I follow a leader it's Him that I'm following. In all these questions, in all aspects of my life, He has something to tell me about it and will lead me through it.&nbsp; <br /> He has been wonderful at continually poking His head into whereever I am. Even when I've put Him aside or don't want to think about Him, He meets me in my Hiding&nbsp; Place and for that I am so grateful. <br /> <br /> Tonight my heart is softening from Silent and Hard to Quiet and Receptive. I do love Jesus. I want to know Him as all that He is- Savior, Father, Friend, Lover, Fortress, Safety, Redeemer, Rescuer, Giver, Healer, Strength, Love, Mercy,&nbsp; ahh the list is endless. <br /> <br /> My heart is in more pain than I realize. I have made choices these last few months that have deeply wounded my heart and refused to look at just how much pain they caused me, Jesus, and everyone else involved. He is softening me and helping me lower my arms that have been providing my own security. Letting Him get closer though, reveals just how much pain my heart is in. He keeps asking if I'll let Him touch it- if I'll trust Him with it. My heart is screaming yes, but my head says that it already hurts won't touching it make it worse?&nbsp; I know he has words for me and I've been dry for not hearing them. I want to hear them. I know what my accusers say about me, I know what I say say about me, but I desire to hear what He, the one who created me, says about me. He is the only one that knows me fully inside and out, backwards and forwards, and still greets me with love, love, and guess what? More love! <br /> <br /> Thanks for not giving up on me and setting the stage by prayer for Jesus to meet me in real ways. <br /> I am His Kid and He is revealing his relentless pursuit of me. </font></span><font face=""georgia,serif"" size=""2"" style=""font-family: tahoma,sans-serif;""><br /> <br /> <span style=""color: rgb(51, 153, 102);"">&quot;You have forsaken your first love.

"event","<em>Some really amazing things have been happening over this brief period of silence. Ya I know...brief like the intertestimonial period. </em><br /><em>Anyways... Some sweet things like mom getting done with cancer treatment in July, me surviving my sophomore year of college, finding a great church and amazing community, giving my life to Christ for real, stepping out of years of sinful patterns, experiencing Grace like never before along with forgiveness, Love, mercy, and acceptance. My niece Kathryn Rose (Kati) was born </em><em>July 5th, I got to come back to Asbury for my Junior year, </em><em>I'm learning to play cello, I got to play french horn for a few of the services at Quest (and it was Awesome!!!), and got to restore a few friendships. <br />Some pretty nasty things have happened as well. I willingly picked old patterns again that caused more pain, mom developed a large tumor very rapidly and had to have surgery and deal with complications, tumor was diagnosed containing stage one ovarian cancer, in removing said tumor found more small bowel cancer from last year (We are still in the middle of all that stay tuned for when chemo starts), got really behind in this semester and am struggling to finish well, and realized I'm struggling with depression.</em> <br /><br /><em>But that's not why I need to write. <br /><br />See I met this guy. <br />Well, the reality is my best friend found me again. </em><em>It has been a wonderful few months. Getting to experience Love in ways I've only dreamed of. Having him come back after all these years and choose me. To worship together, to read together, pray together, laugh together, dream together....&nbsp; My family is so happy. </em><em> It's perfect. We agree and compromise on everything important...even down to agreeing Peanut Butter must be Jiff. </em><em>I seriously think we are about 20 steps ahead of most couples when they are first married. <br /><br />And.....<br /><br />Jesus is asking us to give it to Him in a true sacrifice. </em><em>To walk away from everything &quot;perfect&quot;. To trust Him so deeply that we give back what He's given us. </em><em>To raise the knife above our dearest relationship </em><em>and at the very least begin to drop it. Everything that we have both desired, dreamed for, wished for, prayed for, thought was lost- is right in front of us and Jesus is asking us to Trust Him and walk away. <br />I can't begin to describe for you the pain this is causing my heart. </em><em>I know this is what Jesus is asking.&nbsp; Jesus is calling me into a time with just Him. A time where He can call me into the desert and betroth me unto Himself in righteousness and faithfulness. (Hosea 2) </em><em>I can see God's faithfulness in this and can recount many examples of where He has walked it out and proven himself faithful. </em><em>However sacrifice isn't really sacrifice unless there is pain. This is refining. It is going to change me and change him. I want it and want to run from it at the very same instant. </em><em>I can't control my life. I want to, but I can't. <br />That's why my Quest family is saying anyways. <br /><br />Mostly everyone else is so totally in support of it all it's crazy. My family absolutely loves him and won't take anything different. My nieces and nephews love spending time with him along with my sister and her husband. He is prolly the only guy in the world my brother will take a second glance at because he was friends with my brother long before I was. I'm realizing each day just how much I do love him. He is looking to move to Kentucky as soon as he can find a job so we can be together.&nbsp; <br /><br />I've tried to give this up and I just can't. It's apart of me now. I've tried pretty hard too. I want this life though. I want to be with him and I can see many many many many God fingerprints all over it. I&nbsp;love how happy we are together. I love how we can talk and work things out.

"event","<font color=""#ff3399""><i>There is a huge lump in my chest made up of all my thoughts, feelings, emotions, actions, images...everything. And it's stuck. Something happened today and I can't stop replaying it over and over in my head only this time saying and doing what I wished I would have been quick and brave enough to do the first time. Don't worry no one died. No one got hurt....well. I guess that is up to your definition of hurt. <br /><br />But in order for me to share this burden I have to be a ""psycho"" and fill you in on the ""why"" and care more about that than the ""what."" (FYI ""Psycho"" is the loving joking term my mom says about me when we refer to me being a psych major :-D ) <br /><br />Why does the why matter? well because telling you that they wouldn't let my mom keep her shoes on going through the airport security doesn't share much of my burden does it? <br /><br />See like I've told you before mom is undergoing cancer treatment in Philly and I went with her this week. It was a good thing to. I figured out per pharmacy's instructions she had been taking her chemo pill incorrectly which is what was causing her sever nausea. There was an immediate difference when she started taking the pill half an hour after her meal instead of during it. And I got her through the surgery to insert her chemo port.&nbsp; Anyway..... she spends a week at the center. It's an amazing place. Everyone strives to know your name and everyone and I mean everyone that passes you looks you in the eye, smlies and says hello. The atmosphere is calm and relaxed. Everything is at your own pace. You aren't an inconvince no matter what. There are snacks and water everywhere...even in the shuttle vans and the cars that pick you up from the airport. You are surrounded by people who understand because they are there! The fellow patients know when you need a hug and when you can't stand being touched. They care. It's what they have. I was amazed at these patients. They are all going through treatments but they look out for one another. They encourage, pray with, cry with, smile with you. You are in control there but you are pampered to the gills. It's humbling really.&nbsp; i'll get into my thoughts more later but this is about today.... <br />This is where we spent our week. Finally the white stretch limo pulled up and we packed our stuff to go home. The driver loaded our luggage and opened the doors. When we pulled up to the airport he opened the doors and set our luggage on the curb. And left. <br /><br />We weren't in Kansas anymore. <br /><br />We were surrounded by people. We went up to the touch screen check in kiosk to print off our tickets and it said there was an error...no seats. What!?!?&nbsp; Mom started getting flustered. She talked to the woman behind the desk who was also stressed and a little confused due to all the things she was trying to handle at once God bless her. We finally got our tickets they just weren't together which was the computers problem.&nbsp; So we move on to the security check point.&nbsp; Now for the last week or so mom has finally decided not to take off her shoes and just asks to be searched personally with their wand. It's because of the meds shes on for chemo causes her to have neuropathy in her hands and feet. She takes herbs so there isn't constant pain but she says her appendages feel like they are always going to sleep. Adding on her weakness putting on shoes is a trying task. She puts them on in the morning and doesn't take them off until she goes to bed. Even then some mornings I did it for her or dad does it on weekends. Erie airport has been supportive of this and doesn't mind doing a couple extra steps. Philadelphia on the other hand.... <br />First off they decided to search her little carry on back pack with all her meds in it again. *sigh* Okay. I handled that while mom went over to the side with the attendant. I was getting anxious like I always do going through security and this time I had alot to manange...our coats, my shoes, my backpack, my laptop in a different holder and my carry on suitcase. And now him searching her bag. I was trying to keep my cool.&nbsp; Then the TSA agent walked over to my mom who was sitting in a chair and bent over to be more in her face and told her basically ( i oculdn't hear everything) that next time she flew she must, she MUST take off her shoes. It was the rule and everyone had to follow it. I tried to explain why she couldn't and she kept cutting me off and said that she could she just wouldn't. The way she handled it...it was a power trip. <br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I totally respect security and understand the strictness and severity of their job. As we were waiting for the limo at the center I caught an article in the paper about things like alligators, snacks, and tarantulas people had tried to sneak loose past check point so they could have them on the plane!! I'm thankful for the checkpoint. However there are exceptions to every rule. My mom was a trooper though, she held firm and didn't cry because she knew it was a power trip. I was afraid to go further thinking that she could have me taken my security for ""harassing her"" and then we'd miss the flight. I wanted to ask her to talk to me somewhere quiet so we could talk...or ask for her supervisor but I didn't want to make a scene and make things worse.&nbsp; <br />On top of this mom gets really anxious at airports ever since her first trip back to Erie when she fell asleep in the terminal and missed her flight. Sure they called her name over the loudspeaker, but no one physically came over and asked her if she needed to board.&nbsp; <br />Every friday once dad picks her up and takes her somewhere to eat, at some point she just breaks down crying. Now I understand why. Once you step out of that car and enter the airport it's a whole new world. People don't know about her. Frankly they don't care. She has business men flying by her in suits, kids running around her ankles, Loud noises, fast paced..strict and cold compared to the center. It's traumatic. Now adding the TSA agents on top of it.... it's crushing. Her anxiety rises the min she steps out of the car and doesn't calm down until her body can't handle it anymore at home. <br /><br />Tomorrow I'm going to try to find the airport super in charge of security and try to figure out how to handle mom's situation better. I want to follow the rules I appreciate the rules. I want to handle this through the proper chain of authority I just have to figure out what that is. Up till this point it's been at the check point asking for exception. I guess we need something more.&nbsp; If the airport itself doesn't work I'll call her case manager at the center and ask if she can write up a note for her. This feels so high school on some levels but it's okay. If you had a doc. appointment you were excused but you couldn't just up and walk out, you had to turn in the excuse and sign out. I'm okay with that.... <br />All night I keep going over the situation and thinking over what I would have said. I keep thinking about what I hope to say tomorrow. But it's hard. I can't just say my mom can't take off her shoes. To those who aren't experiencing the side effects and the anxiety she is, it's a stupid suspisious request. It's just taking off your shoes.... you do it all the time. It's quick.... but for mom it's not. I just have to bait the person on the other line long enough to understand that. <br /><br />I hate security check points anyway. My fear of screwing up comes flying at me. I feel like the atmosphere is one of hostility.... hurry up...don't mess up....don't make a scene....hurry up....you look like a fool why can't you get your shoe on..... calm down you might look suspicious.....&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />I know it's weird. But true. My mom and I are alot alike...I can see the same fears reflected in her eyes that are resounding in my head. We have alot in common....<br /><br />People at the center say we have the same smile......<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />I did it though. I got really scared/nervous the night before. I panicked. I was afraid I couldn't do it. I was afraid I would get there and fall apart half way through the week and let her down. But I didn't. The first day or so I felt pretty much useless at the center. She had her routine and I didn't know anything. Except she was still incredibly nauseous.&nbsp; The cool thing was the radiation guys were really kind and took me in and showed me how the machine worked and I got to watch the computer as they did the scan and the treatment. It was awesome!! Monday night mom had another break down..... when we got back to the apartment we both laid down and took a nap since we'd been up since 5am and flying to philly. We slept for two hours which was a little too long. She woke up and her body was hungry and needed food but by that time she was so tired and weak and nauseous to eat even though that's what she needed. I kept calm and handled it and everything was okay. Thankfully on tuesday I figured out her medicine fiasco so she felt much better for her surgery thankfully. I know that would have been a disaster if she had been so nauseous still. I did what needed to be done and it was awesome. I love the adreneline that kicks in when I have something important that needs to be done NOW. I loved thinking about what she needed. Thinking enough to arrange a car to take us home after radiation was complete the day of her surgery so she wouldn't have to wait longer and deal with the bumpy shuttle. I love being close enough to my mom to read her and know what she needs. She calls me her drug pusher :-D&nbsp; I handled thinking through things she couldn't, talking to important people, and just being there when she needed to cry. She needed me this week. And I showed up. That is satisfying. <br /><br />Leading up to this week my aunt, who went with her last week for the short week, kept telling me that my role was comic relief..keeping things light. When when the rubber met the road that was like strapping david into saul's armor. It wasn't my role. That was her role last week for sure but My role was supporter. Burden carrier, understander, compassionate friend. This was the longest week of treatment she'd had and she was scared going into it. She didn't think she could handle it. My job is to remind her to take it one step at a time and to praise her when she took as step. This week actually turned out really well and flew pretty quickly. We have the strongest bond in this because she was there with me when I went through my surgeries and had to face the fear of the unknown, the uncomfortable, and return to know dreaded known. She leans on me to reveal the secrets of how I did it. It was my job to be patient with her. To be her time keeper. To think ahead and relieve potential problems before they got out of hand.&nbsp; And amazingly.... I was successful. To me that is humbling and astounding. <br /><br />Right now she is troubled about her port. She can't handle having it there right now knowing it's going to stay for about six months. I was trying to encourage her by telling her it was cool and hey at least it will come out. In all honesty I was just trying to be positive that it was going to come out eventually but she replied.... yeah, that's true yours don't huh? Ouch. I didn't mean it like that..but it's true. Her implant is for a short time, daunting as it is. My rods are there ..always. I can't escape. There is no countdown to removal. Hmm.&nbsp; It just pangs me to think she prolly thinks this port makes her less human or something. To me it makes her beautiful. I'm so proud of her. This hasn't been easy at all and she is doing so well. Not perfectly of course but doing well. Amazingly well. I'm so proud and honored to call her Mom. *misty eyes*<br /><br />Next week Corey is going with her for the week. This is good but doesn't solve the airport problems due to the way Philly airport is set up they have to go through different check points. I hope this goes okay. I hope he swallows himself and serves her. I hope it's good for them. She protects him, babies him, he's a boy so he isn't expected to do certain things. Especially things not included in the masculine role. It's always been this way. I hope he won't let her this time. I hope he thinks ahead and is her caregiver not her son. I hope he won't let her do things like tie her shoes when she shouldn't or rearrange the furniture or carry her purse..... I hope he'll let her cry like she needs to...I hope she lets her self cry like she needs too.&nbsp; I hope he proves to be the man I know is hiding in him somewhere. ..... I hope she doesn't forget me..... <br /><br /><br /><br />I don't know how to describe myself right now. I'm not anxious in the sense of shaking, higher alertness, or the tapping of my fingers together darting my eyes around like I do.... I'm not stressed like I'm going to explode like there is a pressure building or something... but I can't relax.&nbsp;&nbsp; Why is it that the things I'm so very good at, the things I feel alive about I'm so good at that I doing them for any length of time would kill me? I love taking care of people physically, mentally, emotionally, and even spiritually as weak as that is right now. I am a defender. I am truly a caretaker. At the beginning of the week it was the nametag that I didn't feel comfortable wearing... I couldn't be mom's caretaker..I'm the baby girl... her baby girl. But ask the week went on I'm beginning to understand just how true that title is. It's been one of my downfalls in relationships. I pave the way..I make everything smooth. Basically treat them perfectly and meet their every need, wish, hope, dream that I could possibly do. It set the tone of them being taken care of.... when when that would change and I exhausted myself and it felt like something was missing from the relationship and when I needed them to take care of me they wouldn't know how, and I wouldn't know how to let them....or I smothered them and they ran away.&nbsp; Maybe I'm blowing this up and making it bigger than it is....but I feel like it's happening again and it pains me. <br /><br />I feel like people are my biggest strength and my biggest weakness. <br /><br />Three girls were stabbed to death because their mother thought they were demon possessed. Social work and family services had been called in many times leading up to this. The school started an investigation when it was believed the mother was holding the oldest captive from school. It was closed when they couldn't find the family. Now they are all dead. <br />I want to be a rescuer. I want to meet someone on a dangerous road and help them steer a different direction to safety. The problem? Failure isn't an option and that isn't always in my control.&nbsp; But I can't get away from somethings....like I care more about the why than the what. <br /><br />I leave for school 4am sunday morning. My flight out of pittsburgh leaves at 7am for Louisville. am I ready? not yet. <br /><br />I need a hug. One where they hug you and you let go and stop running and melt. I need a daddy hug but hugs from my dad hurt....his body shape doesn't go with mine and it hurts. My brother's hugs are empty and fleeting. My significant other's are more taking than giving which is what they need right now as they are really sick.&nbsp; I don't trust anyone else that much to let myself stop and let go. I don't want anyone to get attached. I don't want to do something I'll regret in a weak moment.... I don't want to relax and then have to start fighting again. I just want to be put to sleep and have someone stay up standing guard protecting me. Why is that something I feel I must have? <br /><br />As the airplane was taxiing off the runway out of philly I looked out the window and told God i believed in him I just didn't know what to do with that or where to find him right now. <br /><br />This is the whirlwind that is me. <br /><br />But soon I'll be back to my routine...class, work, cheer, sleep, repeat. It worked well last semester look at my GPA for goodness sake!! But do I have the strength to keep going? <br /><br />Fake it till you make it I suppose. Either do or do not there is no try. <br /></i></font>"

"event","<i>Wow here we are....2008....weird. <br /><br />Mom decided to go alone. Time kinda ran out in a way and the last we had talked she said she wanted me to stay. <br />I spent New Year's Eve with Alyssa and some of our friends. Two of them got married during the early evening. I was a little bit...apprehensive you could say about this wedding but it turned out really elegant. We were there for about six hours! I even got to dance. Heck yes!! After the wedding Alyssa and I went back to her house to change and got into a much needed conversation. It's been hard to stay close while&nbsp; I'm away at school and sometimes little things pile up making the road pretty cluttered. We both had things we needed to confess in order to clear the street. But we did and it was a time of confession and understanding not resentment and blame. The night went even better after that even though not much happened. One of our friends came back to her house and we played Tony Hawk on her new PS2 until five min. till midnight, found a TV station and watched the ball drop at midnight. We toasted sparkling white grape juice and popped in a movie. We only made it about half way through when her parents got home and we decided we were half asleep anyway we might as well go to bed. During the night we got a light covering of snow. We spent New Year's Day pretty much not doing much of anything. We slept in, made food, watched TV, read books, took a nap...etc etc. It was really relaxed. During our time of relaxation and rest we failed to realize that the snow that had begun during the night had refused to let up. We got like eight inches!! By the time we realized it, it was after dinner and the sun had already gone down. It was pretty much too late for me to go home. So Unfortunatly I haven't seen my mom yet this year. (tee hee...sounds so much worse than it is. Really it's that I haven't seen her in a day) After we made dinner we went over to our friend's house to finish the movie we started and play more video games...this time on his Xbox 360. We were having so much fun we didn't leave till about 3am!! It was time well spent. He is leaving tomorrow to go to school in Florida so it was the last time we'll see him in a while. We got a couple hours of sleep and then alyssa had to go into work for a couple hours this morning. She actually got some overtime because the other cashier got into a car accident......yeah the snow is that bad..... I got up and cleaned off her car while she got a quick shower. When she left I ate breakfast and finished the book I had started while I was there. Then I took my nap :-) This was at about eight am mind you I deserved it!!&nbsp; <br />Today has pretty much been spent like the last couple before it. Reading, sleeping, video games, TV, food....and just chillin out with my best friend. We came back to my house and watched the first couple episodes of NCIS with my dad. She decided she wanted to know what all my fuss has been about the show for all this time!! It's such a good show. Then we played a video game we picked up tonight and now she is getting some sleep before she has to drive home in the morning for work.&nbsp; <br />You may be wondering why I'm not sleeping yet either....... and that my friend....is what I'm asking myself. It was surprisingly easy to get up even that early this morning and I got a lot accomplished before I took a nap. I only slept for a couple hours before I got up and got my shower and I've been pretty much awake the rest of the day....I guess I did have a short nap but hey. But I'm still awake. I may even try a bit of Spyro before I turn in.&nbsp; Alyssa and I have also started reading a book called ""The Looking Glass Wars"" (I think that's the title.) It's really good so far...I read the first eleven chapters this afternoon. :-D I think the bookworm-ness of my roommate is starting to rub off a little. *smiles*<br />It's pretty much a book saying that Lewis Caroll's version of Alice in Wonderland was all wrong and this is the true story of Alyss Heart Princess of Wonderland and the ranging war with her Aunt Redd. Good fantasy. <br /><br />So even though I got an amazing GPA this semester....I'm still not ready to go back. It's too soon. Even after the past few days of chillin out i still have stress knots that haven't been worked out all over my body. I've loved the last couple days. I would love to stay here and find a nice little job...maybe working at that coffee shop I visited last week. But no. Come monday I leave for Philly then back to KY where my schedule still isn't worked out and I'm still not sure how I'm getting there. I've tried to fix it on line but it's still reading me as an underclassmen and won't let me registar for the upperlevel classes I need and earned. *sigh* It doesn't help that this semester we start bright and early monday morning instead of tuesday like it's been the last three semesters I've been there. That really makes things difficult. The book store isn't open on sundays. And as of right now I have an eight am monday class. Yay Me. It also doesn't thrill me that most of my classes will be with one of the few people on campus at this point I don't want to see or be near. I've been burned again and again and it's my fault for being like a mesquito to a bug zapper and i'd rather not repeat this again but we have the same major thus must take the same classes for the majority of our time spent until we graduate. *sigh* What sucks is I have so many questions that I feel should be answered and I'm drawn to find those answers. But it's too late. Even though it matters to me, in the whole situation they don't matter. It's gone. Their gone. I need to accept it and let the actions be all the answers I need. Maybe someday I'll be able to be around them without wanting to cry, scream, or slam them against the wall. Someday I'll be able to pass them with no overloading of memories...maybe I'll pass them with no recognition to me at all..... just like what happens when they walk by me. <br /><br />.........sorry, I guess I needed to get that out........<br /><br /><br />As for the rest of this week....not sure. I feel like a juggler tossing a few possiblities in the air. I guess as each day comes we'll find out which stay in my hand and which fall to the ground. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;</i>"

"event","<i>The person who we thought could go with mom this week for treatment...can't. Crap.<br />My sister can't go....unless I take care of her kids the whole time. My Aunt can't because school starts back up. Dad can't because of work as well. That leaves me. Good news is it's a short week just wednesday through friday. But if I went it means I leave basically a week and a half early.&nbsp; I don't know what to do. I don't want to be selfish...mom needs someone.... but does it really come down to me or is there someone else perfect for this part and we just need to be humble and ask? But is it anyone elses job? Then again the body of christ...... *sigh* <br /><br />My mom says it's okay I should wait and go my week.....dad says I should really consider it, she really shouldn't go alone. *sigh* <br /><br />Not really important but I have a ticket to see Trans Siberian Orchestra on thursday.....something I would have to give up in order to go to philly..... no question that my mom is higher priority, but still... <br /><br />I don't know.&nbsp; Choices are hard. </i>"

"event","<font color=""#800080""><i>I sit in a coffee shop wonderfully taking a break from the speed of life. I really enjoy this little place close to where I live. It's got dark wood walls, amazing black and white art around, japanese lanterns for lighting...it's just really calming. It's nice to sit with my laptop, my roommate across from me and take time to rest. Just be. Right now I don't have any responsibility over anyone or anything. There is nothing I must have compleated by any certain time. No performing, no pleasing, no need to strike up my brain to keep conversations lively. Just me. If I have something to say to Val, I say it and vice versa. I love that I have this right now. I love that it's okay to sit at the same table and read a book.&nbsp; Silence can be very bonding sometimes. <br /><br />So to fill you in on break....<br /><br />I finished my finals, Alyssa came down and picked me up. We loaded our stuff and left the wonderful world of Asbury behind. Once I got home it started. I had about a day before we went to pick up mom. I was really impresesd that the house was in a really good order when I got home. Things were clean and put away.&nbsp; When dad and I went to the airport to get mom her flight was delayed for about an hour. Dad and I went to the mall and starbucks to kill time. He even tried my ""coffee"" and said ""It's not bad""&nbsp; from my dad...that's amazing. He's a dy hard black truck stop coffee kinda guy. When we went back to the airport her flight had been delayed even further! As we waited this woman came over and asked if we were waiting for someone or waiting to leave. We answered her questions but were cautious until we could figure out if she was from the Airport, or just some overly-friendly stranger! Turns out she was a local reporter for the news station and wondered if we would talk to her on camera!!! It was really cool seeing as how my brother made it on the news in N.C. for skipping class and playing golf on a really warm day! I figured they were doing a story on the delays at the airport but our story ended up being the whole story. :-) It was awesome!! It made time pass a bit better. <br /><br />It was a bit of an adjustment having mom home. Since she had undergone her first full week of treatments she was pretty worn out. The side effects are really hitting her hard. The first morning she was home she came up into my room, sat on my bed and just started crying. It ripped my heart out! I didn't know what to do except hug her...so i did. I was amazed though at the strength I found when i needed it though. It hurt but it also gave me strength and power to be there. I know she leans on me because I've been there. I know she relys on my messages somedays to help get her through. I'm trying to remember to send them to her :-) She's had to watch me go through the unknown of surgery...and then turn around and face it all over again knowing what was going to happen. I think that is why I can handle this to the degree that I can. (not saying that's a tremendously strong degree but it's a degree none the less) because I've been there I know, I understand the fears, the struggles, the feeling like crap and powerless to do anything about it. I am really proud of her. She amazes me. <br />I spent that morning trying to figure out what to do with mom to help her feel better. So we went shopping :-) It was a really amazing time spent with mom. We came up with some really good present Ideas and were able to compleate both of our lists. Shortly after we got home my brother and his girlfriend arrived from the south. <br /><br />On sunday after church and lunch we decided to go ice skating. Even the kids came with us!! That was amazing. My Sister and her family, Mom, dad, Corey, Christy, me and alyssa all went skating. Everyone skated except bridget, herb, sam (the youngest child) and dad.&nbsp; Yup that means even mom went on the ice!! It was a blast teaching the kids how to skate. All three were kinda timid to start but by the end Cammi and Ben had found a support ""chair"" thing that you can hold onto to help keep your balance and were flying around on their own. Afterwards I got to go and hang out with alyssa. <br /><br />Christmas Eve was good..... Church bothered me a bit, just that I would have organized the service differently and would have picked different hymns personally but it was okay. I guess it's hard coming back year after year to the same place and watching it change each year remembering better times, and worse times. Christmas Eve has always been more important to me than Christmas day. It was the day of celebration. It was the height of the waiting of advent. Everything was decorated,&nbsp; happy people were everywhere. Everyone was relaxed with this feeling that they had made it, they had arrived. It was time to celebrate!!&nbsp; This year it didn't feel like that.... it felt like people would there because it was ritual, you could see on their faces the millions of things going through their mind of things that needed to be finished before the dawn of Christmas morning. Maybe it's just cause I'm not a lilttle child anymore.&nbsp; <br />Our open house went well though. I love playing hostess. I even got to play guitar with a man in our church. I hope I get to do that again before I leave. He's great. He's an older man that reminds me alot of John.....whom I really hope to see before I leave as well!!&nbsp; I decided to wear my black dress for the evening service. It made me feel amazing<br /><br />Christmas day.... eh..yeah.&nbsp; the kids (by that I include my sister and her husband as well) all showed up in the morning for breakfast and to open presents. My brother was being a dork as usual. The nice change was my dad stuck up for me and silenced him. :-D Bridget even threw in her charge to quit later. It made me smile.&nbsp; The opening of the presents was a little stressful...my mom paniced a bit about picture taking and commading me to do certain things. But we survived. It was a nice simple Christmas. The really cool thing was my mom got all of us alternative gifts. She had made donations for different causes in honor of us. Each was to something close to our hearts. My dad's was for aid to Vietnamese Children, Mine was for eye care and surgery overseas, Christy's was for medical supplies in Bolivia and Corey's was towards the Raleigh Ringers. Wow...that kinda sounds like Corey doesn't care about helping matters overseas but that really isn't the case! Lol. That was a donation that is personal to him since he rang with them for a year....and that's what my mom chose lol.&nbsp; After lunch time the kids left for their other grandparents and we got cozy and watched Christy's christmas present from corey.....Finding Nemo :-D&nbsp; The rest of the day we just kinda chilled out. It was really good to have mom home though. She told us there were alot of patients that couldn't leave. Their treatments are literally fighting for their lives. Wow. ......just wow. I'm looking forward to spending the week with her there.....and honestly..scared out of my mind. Truly.&nbsp; I'm looking forward to hearing people's stories though. Mom says there are some amazing people there. <br /><br />The day after Christmas Mom and aunt susie flew back to philly for treatment again.&nbsp; Dad and I had to go later in the day for my annual eye appointment. This was going to be the moment of truth. I've been out of my glasses since the beginning of summer and now it was time to test my eyes to see if it was a good choice. I've been able to do pretty well. There are some new obstacles but I've adapted really well.&nbsp; I can't read small print as well as I could with glasses and sometimes i don't see things in my periphial vision unless I cognitavly focus on it but i've been award of this and remember to look around. I was hoping that I could just walk in, tell them my eyes were great and leave....but no they wanted to dialate them anyway and take a look. *sigh*&nbsp; I've been having my eyes dialated since I was like 11 months old. It gets old after a while!! lol&nbsp; it's also hard to have an appointment were you are rendered incapable to drive afterwards!&nbsp; Anyways, It really threw me having my eyes dialated without my glasses. The dialation makes everything really fuzzy and blurry and makes me really sensitive to light. Having my glasses helps things stay a tough more in focus....not a lot though. Not having my glasses threw my brain for a loop and I could feel it starting to stress trying to keep focused. I started getting a headache. I finally put on my sunglasses and everything calmed down. My brain is such a funny child. When they did the exam he determined....drum roll please..... my eyes have gotten even stronger since being out of glasses!!!! Whoooot. That is really a continuation of a miracle. That wasn't ""supposed to happen.""&nbsp; After my appoitment was finished dad wanted to go to the mall and get his hair cut.&nbsp; Once he signed up we had about a 45 min. wait so we walked around and got ice cream. It was soooo good. It's a good thing you don't need to see to taste. :-D&nbsp; While he was getting his hair cut I went next door into Steve and Berry's which carries mostly screen printed shirts and other clothing sporting teams logos.&nbsp; They were having a really good sale (The sign was big enough I could read it :-D) I was just walking around for the fun of it and I saw these amazing dress pants and a really cute sweater. But I couldn't read the sizes!!&nbsp; Once dad was finished I brought him over and he helped me It was a cute bonding moment. I took two sizes of pants in two different colors. The grey ones were too small so I asked dad to get the other size. It was when he brought them to me that I finally realized they had pin stripes. &gt;_&lt; stupid eyes lol&nbsp;&nbsp; I ended up getting grey and black dress pants and the sweater. Because of the sale the total for all three was less than a pair of pants elsewhere. Whoooot. I'm glad dad helped too. He was so cute about it. <br />The other amazing thing that happend on Wednesday....my grades came for this semester....... Drum roll....my semester GPA was.......3.81!!!!!!&nbsp; WHOOOOT&nbsp;&nbsp; *wiggle dances*&nbsp; Oh man that is amazing. I'm so happy I worked hard all semester and finished strong. I was a little worried about that that my finals wouldn't be great. But I guess they were awesome. I had one B+, One A- and the rest were A's.&nbsp; That is so much better than my first semester GPA of 2.31. or something low like that. So now my cumalative is 3.01 (what's with the .o1???) Which should be enough to apply for the internship at WKU over the summer for research. Whoot.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Cherry on the milkshake came with two little words at the bottom of the page.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dean's List.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whoa. Me. Homeschool slacker....surgery girl.....the one with a horrible first semester..... worked hard, learned self discipline..... and Made deans list.&nbsp; It makes me want to cry. I got so excited I called my mom and left her a message.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah I walked on air the rest of the day.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pretty much. <br /><br />Yesterday Alyssa and I drove to Pittsburgh and Picked up Val. :-D She flew up from KY to go to the Wesley Woods Staff Christmas Party. Her flight was also a bit delayed. Alyssa and I tried to just chill out but we both got bored...so we invented a game. Pretty simple really..... We basically just went up one escalater and went down the other as many times as we good.&nbsp; We got to 30!! :-D&nbsp; Mind you both escalaters are side by side. Yeah we were bored. There was a woman ringing the salvation army bell at the top...she got on about the 5th time.&nbsp; We&nbsp; had the goal to get to 25 and then we had to compleate incriments of 5 from that point on. So when val got there on lap 26...she got to ride with us till we reached 30. It was such fun. The woman was amazed we did it that many times.&nbsp; Some other people at the bottom gave us really funny looks.&nbsp; The rest of the day was spent navigating Pittsburgh, almost dying a few times, getting lost a few times, screaming and laughing..... and going two hours late to a party. Yes. Good times.&nbsp; Alyssa stayed the night with us and we got to play ps2 games until we all fell asleep. <br /><br />Val and I got up this morning and went to the gym. She needed to swim and I went to work out. Turns out we were an hour too soon for the pool so we went through her weight lifting routine together. It was a blast!!&nbsp; I even survived 5 min. abs :-)&nbsp; Once the hour was up she swam and I continued doing some other lifting excersises and walked the track. I feel so good!!&nbsp; After our two hours we came back to the house and played more video games with alyssa after we fixed lunch. <br /><br />Now We are sitting in the coffee shop while alyssa is working. She'll be done really soon and we'll go back and prolly play more games and sleep. We take val back tomorrow morning. Yay more Pittsburgh tee hee.<br /><br />I feel like this is the point in the entry where I release the amazing poetry that bounces around in my brain. However any lyrics that may be in there....are still non english and still await translation. Sorry. <br /><br />I still don't quite know how I am. I know I'm stressed. I'm quick to get loud. Things frustrate me. Right now there is a choke in my throat as I try to figure out how I am. I want to cry. But it's deep inside...no where near the surface.&nbsp; I did cry when my relationship with my brother took a step back again though. I hate it. I hate that I only have a brother in practicality. Not in practice. I hate that I can't get away from it either. No matter what I do he is the only person in the world who has my DNA. He's my brother. Why is it so hard for him to act like it?&nbsp; I don't know anything worth knowing about him. And he doesn't know me. I've tried to not care but I do. But I also know that it's up to him.&nbsp; What hurts is that I know that he knows there is something wrong with it. I know he knows alot of it is on his end....he's told me. But words are as far as it has gotten. Actions are stlil lacking. Some people put family at the top of the totem pole... I however am at the bottom of his. Will it ever change? <br />It's also so difficult trying to balance out how to do things in a way to make people has happy as possible. Not that I'm overly trying to please people...but trying to come to a solution that works the best for everyone. Sometimes it works....sometimes not so much. <br />I also can't find a rhythm to all this yet. Every day has been an exception. I can't believe I'm saying this but I miss routine. Val and I had a solid routine at school. Now everything is different and exceptions are everywhere. It makes it hard to plan activities with people. <br /><br />I need to practice my french horn.<br /><br />I'm doing okay with my mom I think.... it's still hard to see her in pain or spaz out about nothing. But I noticed her way of asking for help..... Some people ask polietly... ""Will you please open this for me?""&nbsp; Others cut the formality and get right to the point.."" Open this""&nbsp; Mom however...makes it your honor to help her.&nbsp; ""You can open this"".&nbsp; When we were out on our shopping adventure we stopped at subway to eat. She got a choc. milk and couldn't open the cap. She passed it to me and said that I could open it. I smiled and a memory played through my mind of walking into an elevator and hearing mom say I could push the button. That's what this felt like. And that is what is important to me. I am honored to be there to open her choc. milk when she can't. That's how I have to look at all this. If I don't, someone else will. I want this honor. *smiles* <br /><br />Life is an honor. <br /><br /><br /></i></font>"

"event","&nbsp;<i>Seeing as this is finals week of my fall semester sophomore year, I thought it might be approriate to update this seeing as how my last post was regarding the first week of classes!! <br /><br />It's been a good semester i think. Very challenging. Very different. <br />I did actually join the cheerleading squad!! Check that out!! There are six amazing girls. We aren't your normal squad that's for sure. We've all been through alot already but hopefully next semester we can start stunting. Don't worry I'm not one that gets thrown in the air....I'm one that does the throwing *winks* <br />Let's see.... the people I was having ""communication issues"" at the start of the semester...yeah that's pretty much the same. Lol. I've tried a bit, they've tried a bit and it just keeps blowing up. Someday I'll learn to just walk away and never look back. <br /><br />My classes have been alot easier than I thought they were going to which gives me serious hope for next semester!! I had a perfect grade in Math for a few weeks!! I was even ranked first in the class (!!!!!) Yup little psych major is good at math. Who knew?? (The streak came to an end for reasons which I will disclose later)&nbsp; Latin has been alot of fun. Not your normal language class that's for sure! My prof. is also our sophomore class adviser. I'm really glad I've had a chance to get to know him better. He's a wonderful guy. I did end up doing Gen Psych II and handbells at the same time. I even got credit for both!! YAY I love amazing profs.&nbsp; Handbells has been pretty much perfect. I'm ringing E6, F6, which given the change to have picked...is excactly where I wanted to be. For the first half of the semester my roommate val was on one side of me and my other really good friend Brittany was on the other side. Perfection!!&nbsp; We lost a ringer or so about half way through and had to do some reassigning of bell parts so Val is further down the table...But I still have Brit!...and Mary Ann who has been an endless source of entertainment since she found out I'm Corey's sister.&nbsp; :-)&nbsp; I took my Philosophy and Latin finals today. Tomorrow is Social Psych and Math 120. The rest of my classes either I didn't have a final (Like bells) or I took it already. (Gen Psych Post test) I ended up dropping fitness walking. Having an 8am class followed by a huge chunk from 10-1, then another class at 2, followed by 8:45-10:45pm cheer practice.....was brutal!! I wasn't getting anything done in the evening because by the time dinner rolled around I was exhausted and needed to take a nap just to survive cheering. Making the Squad will give me the one credit PE credit I needed anyway soooo bye bye fitness walking.&nbsp; I had two papers assigned this semester. Both of which were written at at the latest one day before the due date, handed in one time, and one was even at the maximum of length assigned. Booya!! <br /><br />My comments in the last post about being different&nbsp; regarding personality, have proved to be true. I've been alot different this semester. I've gone to classes and cheered. That's pretty much it!! It took me until cheerleading to even really get me out of the room to start with. I just don't want to be around people lately. I'm not the same person I was and I don't know quite how to wear that around other people yet.... espeically people who I don't think would agree with the changes. Some people have sought me out and I've responded warmly so it's not like I'm turning into an old hag!! I'm just not seeking others out.&nbsp; Val and I have been great though. We've had a lot of deep meaningful conversations through out this semester that I hope continue into the future. She really has been the perfect roommate for me right now. She hasn't let me dissapear compleatly into total hiding, but has also encouraged me that I don't have to be around everyone all the time. She has also been amazingly understanding and knowledgable in another serious area of my life......<br /><br />There have been alot of things that happened this semester. My cousin got married and I was able to travel to their wedding in September. It was so beautiful!!&nbsp; My mom was able to go but she was really sick. See, she'd been having problems with her stomach since June or July. Started out annoying and kept getting worse. By the time the wedding rolled around the end of sept. she was in serious pain and on an all liquid diet. They kept trying to test other areas like gall bladder and stupid stuff like that. No luck.&nbsp; She took this medicine so they could do a scan and weeks later some of the meds were still inside!! That's how badly her digestive system had shut down. They finally scheduled a date for surgery to figure out what was wrong. (They thought originally that parts of her small intestine were twisted weird) When they did the surgery they found a tumor compleatly blocking her small intestine which had caused the whole system to shut down and her stomach to swell four times its normal size. :-(&nbsp; I was still here when they did the surgery. It was like on a wednesday. On monday they got the test results from the biopsy that the tumor was cancerous. I took the rest of the week off school and borrowed my friends car and drove home. All of my profs were amazing about letting me go. But when I got back I had to take a math test that I thought I was ready for and wasn't actually. I didn't&nbsp; do too poorly on it...just didn't keep my perfect score. I spent the rest of the week home. When I got home on tuesday mom was still really sick. She could barely function. By the time I left she was walking around, joking, laughing and eating!!! :-) Not long after she was able to return home and continue healing. Even though they were able to compleatly remove the tumor there were still spots of cancer cells they found around the area. They took those off as well but it's hard to tell if there are anymore cells waiting to band together. The doctors recommended further treatment as a precaution to prevent anything else from reoccuring. She did alot of research, went through more testing, and decided to go to a Cancer treatment center in Philly.&nbsp; She will spend 5 weeks in radiation and chemotherapy treatments and then one chemotherapy treatment once every two weeks. She will spend the week in Philly and fly home on the weekends. She started this last week. <br /><br />The good news is she will be home for Christmas. But in some ways it doesn't make it any easier. She has never handled medicine well and she is already starting to feel the effects from treatments. She'll leave again the day after Christmas.&nbsp; I'm planning on going with her the last full week I'm home. <br /><br />You are prolly wondering how I am right? ..... I don't know.&nbsp; On one hand I'm really okay. It's something we need to do and once we are done she'll be better. Her life isn't hanging in the balance and there will be a good end to these treatments. She was so amazing in how she showed she was there for me during my surgeries and now it's my turn. I want to go home and be there and give back what I enjoyed from her. I'm looking forward to going through my old homeschool books and picking out some of the books we read then and reading them to her now.&nbsp; When I go home I will have alot more responsiblities in our traditions for Christmas. It will be fun to bake the cookies, decorate the tree, and play hostess on Christmas Eve and make sure everything is good. This is a huge challenge. Break is shorter to begin with, our spring break and our easter break have been combined into one week next year and spring semester is longer. Ohhh joy!!&nbsp; Now I have the task of making sure mom is as comfortable as possible when she is home for the weekends. <br /><br />On the other hand I hate it. I can't handle it. It's like the universe has flipped....there is a resounding dissonant chord ringing in my ear that will not resolve. I'm 20. I'm in college. I've got enough weight in my own life..I need a break from this semester to get ready for the next.&nbsp; I know that there comes a point when kids have to turn around and care for their parents. I just always invisioned that time being when I was married and had a family of my own and was used to caring for others like that. I expected it to come later when I would at least have the support of my spouse. But no, that time is now.&nbsp; Thankfully my sister and my brother are gathering in to help which is amazing. If things work out like mom was thinking corey may be the one to spend the most time in Philly with her. :-) I'm really touched by that actually. I'm hoping that this might be a further catalyst for further growth in the relationship between my brother and I this Christmas. Holidays can be so difficult because at this point we only see each other maybe three times in a year and to be frank....we don't know each other. We know things about each other but we really don't know each other and it can be really ackward at times.&nbsp; The wedding was a good weekend but it's still so superficial. I'm not sure yet how to fix it because we don't see each other.&nbsp; I'm really hoping that the stress from this break will create a stronger bond causing us to lean on each other and work together and not tear us futher apart. <br />I'm also really worried about my dad. He is staying home to continue working and holding down the fort. I know, whether he admits it or not, he doesn't want to be alone. That is kinda a hard weight to lay down. My parents and I have been having some growing pains before all this dealing with me growing up and what is expected when I come home on breaks. This adds a whole new level. I know there are going to be times when I need to go out and relax with my friends. There are also going to be times when I want to just stay home and spend time with dad. the tricky part is finding a balance everyone is at least okay with...preferably happy with too!! <br /><br />Please don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to be overly selfish about all this. It's just I've spent alot of my life sacrificing my self too much for others and getting into sticky situations because of it. I've lost who I am more than I'd like to admit. This semester I've started on the track to fix that again and to be a little selfish but in a good way. In a way that takes care of myself so that I can be a benefit to others.&nbsp; Not to mention the weight of handling someone so close to you being so sick.&nbsp; Now that balance needs adjusted again and that's good, I just have to be careful to do it right and not too much to one side. There are things this break that I need for myself. There are things my family and friends need from me as well. <br /><br />All in all things are good. My grades are much better again and after this coming semester I should be right on track as a true junior. I'll even get to spend a semester sitting in a true sophomore seat in chapel!! Yes!!&nbsp; <br /><br /></i>"

"event","<p><em>Here I am back at School Today was the last day of our first week of class for this year. It's been quite a ride already!!&nbsp;<br /><br />I was able to pack and load our car in a decent fashion...we left only about 2 hours after we said we would.....not back considering last year it was alot longer than that. I think we were shooting for 8am and we left at 3 or 4...yeah.&nbsp; I actually fit all of my stuff for this year, plus my parents suitcase for the weekend all in our Blazer. Granted, you couldn't see out the back window and there was bearly room for me but hey it fit!! :-)&nbsp; We moved in on Sunday after noon after having lunch with my roomates family. My parents and I got here about an hour before she did to unload my stuff and start getting the furniture arranged. I started an idea and when she got there we put our heads together and came out with a really awesome layout!! It would almost be safe to say we are the only ones on campus with this layout too!! That makes me very happy.&nbsp; We spent the day unpacking and we made a walmart run or two.&nbsp; I finally got settled in and went to the College Post Office to get my new box and combination. In my box was an updated schedule and my chapel seat assignment. To my surprise I was listed in the freshmen section. And when I looked at my schedule it also said freshmen. After further evaluation I found out that in order to be considered a Sophomore you had to have 30 hours and have had taken Expos and Research (which I did) and math 120. AHHH I only have 28 credits and I'm taking Math 120 this semester. Needless to say I was pretty upset. It would have been one thing to have been aware of it.....but this took me by absolute surprise. My advisor was the one who advised my lighter course load. I could have taken Math 120 last semester and had 17 credits would have been just fine but I was nervous about taking the class, and It would have been an 8am. She said it didn't matter and I should probably still to 14 credits. Good YAY me.&nbsp; Now I'm paying for it.&nbsp; So I'm taking 16 this semester (well 17 but I'll get to that in a sec) and next semester to progress forward and make up the missing two credits.&nbsp; Once I realized there was nothing I could do about it, I tried to be optimistic and enjoy having the balcony for another year....except I have one of the worse seats in the balcony!!! Of course.&nbsp;<br /><br />So my classes this semester are:&nbsp;&nbsp; Fitness Walking, Chapel, Social Psych, Handbells, (Gen Psych II), Latin, Philosophy, Math 120.&nbsp;&nbsp; I say I'm really taking 17 credits, and I put Gen Psych in parentesis because They are at the same time. I need to take Psych II for my major, and this is a tour year for handbells and they really need a year commitment. The group only tours once every two years. This was something I wanted in on!! So I talked to both profs and they are both so wonderful and flexible!! So I'm auditing handbells and doing Psych II as an independent study.&nbsp; Psych meets three days a week, bells only two. So I go to bells on those two days and go to psych the last day.&nbsp; On test days in Pysch II that overlap with handbell days I will either take the test the friday before, or 9am the morning off when I don't have class. As long as I keep my Psych II grade up I should be great.&nbsp; The rest of my classes have gone really well this week too. We had a quiz and a lab in Math 120 and I smoked it!! It was awesome. I understood it, did well lon it, and was finished early. I was pumped.&nbsp; In Philosophy we are reading Plato's writings of conversations of Socrates and other people. This week we read the&nbsp;Euthyphro.&nbsp; A-mazing.&nbsp; I have even studied and done all my reading for this week in my classes. I'm super excited. I'm suddenly feeling very intelligent and knowledgable. It's funny though, because I don't have much desire to be social. I just want to come back to my room and bury myself in a psych book! And no, I checked, I don't have a fever! ;-) &nbsp; I just....I dunno,&nbsp; I haven't talked to alot of my classmates all summer and a couple of us are having umm....communication problems right now. So I'm focusing on bulding a solid foundation in my school and the other stuff can come later.&nbsp;<br /><br />I'm not the same person that I was. I'm alot tougher. I'm alot more reserved and internal. I'm really not in the mood to be around alot of people right now. I'm sure it will come.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />However, I do keep kicking around the idea of trying out for cheerleading. Now now don't laugh. I know it's like a boomorang it just keeps coming back!! I want to know why though. Why is this a dream of mine that I can't let go of? Every year I think about it and want to do it. My roommate is on the swim team this semester (I'm so proud of her!!) and I would love to be on a team again. I miss it. And I really do love cheerleading.&nbsp; So I dunno in a few weeks you may see some caps- excited post and a picture with a uniform...I dunno.&nbsp; We'll see how it plays out. LIke I said, academics must come first. But it would be an awesome way to support the basketball teams especially one of my friends.... I'll be at most of the games anyways why not be doing something?&nbsp;<br /><br />All in all my semester is off on a pretty decent start. We have a beautiful new student center and brick sitting walls (Oh man they are beautiful!!) Great classes, and an amazing room and perfect roommate. Who could ask for more....well ok maybe a better chapel seat. ;-) <br /></em></p>"

"event","<em><font color=""#ff00ff"">Ok as if this day hasn't been long enough......<br />After I finished that entry I Shut my computer and walked over to my air conditioner to get some air moving and I saw a small spider about the size of a pin. I looked at it....swallowed hard and killed it with my finger. Then I saw another...same thing. Then I flashbacked to a year ago when I was watching TV in my room and saw a larger spider. Got up and killed it (that one was harder) and saw another one about the same size and two or three tiny ones near it. As I looked at them I could see trails of tiny spiders spaced about an inch apart covering my walls and ceilings.&nbsp; Naturally I screamed and ran downstairs and had a panic attack. In case you didn't notice....I really don't like spiders.&nbsp; Tonight I took a sponge and dampened and and killed all the little spiders I found. This time where was only about 30 or so of them...... *shivers*&nbsp;<br /><br />I really don't want to sleep in my room. Nope nope nope but my alternatives aren't much better..... a very and I mean VERY uncomfortable couch, a bed right beside my brothers bed, or a water logged loveseat. *sigh* I guess it's heat and spiders for me tonight.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *wimpers*&nbsp; I hate the little ones...you can't always tell when they crawl on you....&nbsp; I'm really nervous that when I wake up They will be everywhere again......&nbsp; so much for packing.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Argh, in the time it's taken me to type this my eyes have darted around my sleeping area about 20 times looking for spiders and my skin keeps crawling.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />I don't know why I dislike them so much. Some of it may have to do with the surprise factor.....it's not like a dog that you can hear or smell before you see it. Or you don't reach for something only to find a cat on you when you pull your arm back.&nbsp; But I'm getting better....I actually haven't cried yet tonight..... I'm getting a headache though.....&nbsp;<br /><br />Ok....I'm done now. I'll grow up and sleep in my own bed. But if I don't show up to Asbury Saturday it's because I was eaten alive by billions of pin- sized spiders.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ........wow I'm a loser. *laughs* </font></em>"

I got into a fight with a good friend and then this happened.&nbsp;<br /><br />I went downstairs to heat up some Choc. Chip pancakes my mom had made earlier and just as I started the microwave I heard water dripping in the dining room...I looked up and&nbsp; sure enough it dripped...then streamed. I ran upstairs to find the laundry room flooded and water spraying out of the washer. I screamed for mom. Soon the water pooled around my toes. I ran downstairs and got a bucket. which did practically nothing. Then I ran over to my neighbor's house and asked her for a tarp (in case the dining room ceiling collapesd) or buckets or a mop...something! When I got back the water wasn't spraying as badly out of the washer so I quickly opened it and pushed the clothes back into it. I think an article of clothing got caught between the door and the well preventing a good seal. Where allllll that water came from I'm not sure though. By the time we got it under control the water was near my ankles.&nbsp;When I returned from my neighbors&nbsp; my friend Tom called. I was out of breath and still in reaction mode, he asked what I was doing, I asked him where he was. He said he was near my house and I shouted at him to come up and help us! Poor kid!&nbsp; (He was going to go golfing with a friend but they canceled on him. He was on his way out to walmart and called me to see what I was doing.) He carried up the shop vac and we got the water cleaned up from the laundry room. The material used in the ceiling took the varnish off my mom's wood mouldings in the dining room so they are streaked. She isn't happy! There are bigger water stains too. I'm so nervous that ceiling is going to collapse now.&nbsp;<br /><br />As we were cleaning all that up my Aunt Jeanne called, apparently they are back from wherever they went,&nbsp;(they live in florida and came up for my cousin's bride to be's&nbsp;wedding shower then vanished for a day or so.)&nbsp;and wanted to know if we wanted to play cards. She came over to our house and Tom stayed. We played games for a couple hours with my mom. We played gripe, push, and Express- a domino game. I really like playing express. My aunt and I won :-)&nbsp; So if anyone's up for card or domino games I'm for it!!&nbsp;<br /><br />In other news.....I really need to kick this whole packing thing into high gear.&nbsp; All summer&nbsp; I've been longing to go back to school. And now.....eh. It's been a wild ride of a summer folks.....and I can't say it's all been good....or that youwould agree with me on what I would lable the good parts of my summer. I'm not sure I'm ready to be around&nbsp; large groups of people again. Especially the ""Hey How was your summer?"" ""What did you do""&nbsp;- fakeness- yet- gunine interest -yet -no- way- to -remember -all -the- details- etc- etc conversations. Personally I'd like to forget most of my summer. By no means is that a slam on the people of my summer but if you were there you also understand what I'm talking about. &nbsp;All that to say if I seem to be hiding it's not because I don't like you. :-)&nbsp;<br /><br />Also, I have a pretty serious course load coming at me this semester I'm afraid. I really need to keep my nose inline and work my tail off. I'm excited to have a book worm as a roommate. I miss her.&nbsp;<br /><br />Oh we finally have wireless at my house. YAY.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Ok i'm going to go to bed. </font></em>"

"event","&nbsp;I am trying to remember that I am forgiven and not bound by my past. I do not have to stand inside a glass box looking out at someone else and wish to be like them. I can be. I can learn to fight again, I can count myself pure. I am, I just have to stay that way. I am finding strength to view myself in a higher light- to take pride in who I am. Paul and Jesus were so very right when they said all will suffer for Jesus' name. I used to think of suffereing in a purely physical way. But it's not. We must suffer in this battle of flesh and holiness. We all must be martyrs and die to ourselves for the cause of Christ. There is joy in suffereing and it is foolishness to the world. They don't understand why we deny our flesh satisfaction. But i'm finding the more I do, the happier and stronger i am. <div>&nbsp;I am fighting, and I'm surviving on the word of God, David Crowder, and the prayers of my brothers and sisters.&nbsp;<br /><br />In other news....&nbsp;<br /><br />I no longer have to wear my glasses!!&nbsp;<br />It's a long story but I'll try to hit the highlights....<br /><br />When I was 10 months old my parents discovered I had something called esotrophia- my eyes crossed and convulsed.&nbsp; We went to an opthomologist in Pittsburgh 2 hours away like once every two weeks. I got glasses when I was 2. They could do surgery but not until my eyes stopped convulsing. So every two weeks we drove 2 hours down,&nbsp; waited in the doctors office for a 5 min. exam, drove the 2 hours home and did it again in two weeks. This was very time consuming and expensive.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a story within the story here, but in the end we had a healing service for me and God showed up. When we went back to pittsburgh that week my eyes had stopped convulsing and we set a date for surgery.&nbsp; Even though I was told I would have to have more than just that one surgery and I would never have good depth perception, that wasn't the case.&nbsp; I only had one surgery, I did have depth perception and the perscription in my glasses was gradually getting weaker as my eyes got stronger and stronger.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last week, my glassses got bent and I went four days without them with little to no problems! When I was able to get them fixed, the perscription was too strong!! When I had them check my eyes to weaken the perscription we found out my sight without glasses was 20/20!!!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even though I have fixed glasses....I don't need to wear them any longer!! This is definiatly a continuation of a miracle! :-) Our God is Good Allthe time. </div>"

"event","""Step one you say we need to talk 
He walks you say sit down it's just a talk 
He smiles politely back at you 
You stare politely right on through 
Some sort of window to your right 
As he goes left and you stay right 
Between the lines of fear and blame 
And you begin to wonder why you came 

Where did I go wrong, I lost a friend 
Somewhere along in the bitterness 
And I would have stayed up with you all night 
Had I known how to save a life 

Let him know that you know best 
Cause after all you do know best 
Try to slip past his defense 
Without granting innocence 
Lay down a list of what is wrong 
The things you've told him all along 
And pray to God he hears you 
And pray to God he hears you 

Where did I go wrong, I lost a friend 
Somewhere along in the bitterness 
And I would have stayed up with you all night 
Had I known how to save a life 

As he begins to raise his voice 
You lower yours and grant him one last choice 
Drive until you lose the road 
Or break with the ones you've followed 
He will do one of two things 
He will admit to everything 
Or he'll say he's just not the same 
And you'll begin to wonder why you came 

Where did I go wrong, I lost a friend 
Somewhere along in the bitterness 
And I would have stayed up with you all night 
Had I known how to save a life"""

"event","Lord I'm tired So tired from walking
And Lord I'm so alone And Lord the dark
Is creeping in Creeping up
To swallow meI think I'll stop
Rest here a while

And didn't You see me cry'n?
And didn't You hear me call Your name?
Wasn't it You I gave my heart to?
I wish You'd remember
Where you sat it down

Chorus:
And this is all that I can say right now
And this is all that I can give


I didn't notice You were standing here
I didn't know that
That was You holding me
I didn't notice You were cry'n too
I didn't know that
That was You washing my feet ~David Crowder Band- All I can Say. 


~We sang this in chapel this morning at Asbury and it was so powerful. The honesty of it all. Too many times we (as a culture...as individuals) have gotten the notion that we have to say the right things to God or be clean when we come to him... but it's not true. We should be honest. If we hurt..tell him so! If we are thankful..tell him so!! Our Culture keeps demading to prove that God is real...we are in love with reality...yet we refuse to be honest and real before Him... why should we expect something we aren't willing to give?

I love the lines ""Wasn't it you that I gave my heart to, I wish you'd remember where you set it down."" How many times do we do that? Try and tell God how to be God when things aren't working out as we planned instead of trusting in the knowlegde that he is God...the one True God. He can't...he won't forget about us. Even when we feel as though he has misplaced our heart and dreams, the reality is he is standing right beside us...right beside you, holding you, crying when you cry. He engraved your name into his hands. He washes our feet. He takes us as we are..broken, sinful and dirty, lowers himself to the servant's job, and washes us clean.... time...and time...and time again. How awesome is that? 

Our God is truly and Awesome God. 


~From the mind of Erin Chelly~

(let me know your thoughts....yes even you...especially You.)"

SKILLET LYRICS

""Rebirthing""

I lie here paralytic 
Inside this soul 
Screaming for you till my throat is numb 
I wanna break out I need a way out 
I don't believe that it's gotta be this way 
The worst is the waiting 
In this womb I'm suffocating 

Feel your presence filling up my lungs with oxygen 
I take you in 
I've died 

Rebirthing now 
I wanna live for love wanna live for you and me 
Breathe for the first time now 
I come alive somehow 
Rebirthing now 
I Wanna live my life wanna give you everything 
Breathe for the first time now 
I come alive somehow 

I lie here lifeless 
In this cocoon 
Shedding my skin cause 
I'm ready to 
I wanna break out 
I found a way out 
I don't believe that it's gotta be this way 
The worst is the waiting 
In this womb I'm suffocating 

[Bridge:]
Tell me when I'm gonna live again 
Tell me when I'm gonna breathe you in 
Tell me when I'm gonna feel inside 
Tell me when I'm gonna feel alive 

Tell me when I'm gonna live again 
Tell me when this fear will end 
Tell me when I'm gonna feel inside 
Tell me when I'll feel alive



Please look for this song, the music is amazing!!  

This song, the ATF worship sound track and ""All who are thirsty""  are my theme music right now...it's what's getting me through. 

College is hard..it's not joke! I'm definitly going through that growing period of ""who is me?""  than again, I've been going through that for the last few years...it's just getting worse!!  I got behind on work because I got really sick...and now it's crunch time.  I'm realzing that I've been doing alot of negitive self talk...telling myself it's hard, or that I can't do it... or I'm struggling... making it come true.  I've been focusing on that so much, that my successes (like a 90 on my english midterm!! or a B on the western civ exam!!) don't hold any meaning for me. But I'm getting better...I did alot of positive self talk today so that's helping. 

I have been enjoying life down here though....we've been doing some crazy things!!  Last weekend we went Ice Skating!! (Megan it was amazing!! It's the first time I've been since I went with you! Definitly brought back memories!) And one of my friends who's family lives in wilmore, (he lives in the dorms) built a climbing wall up the side of his house. They have harnesses and belay gear and they attach the belayer to a tree so it's super safe!!  It's about two stories high!!  It was a blast! I can't wait to do it again! :-) 

We've been doing crazy TAG group stuff as well...like a murder mystery night!  I was actually a murder..but I didn't know it and I didn't mean too!! I ment to slip love potion into my crush's drink...but it turned out to be rat poison instead. Whoops! 

Alright well I need to continue working on my paper and outlines.  But I thought i'd let you know how I was doing...."

"event","Jesus (sweetly, romanticlly, tenderly softly): <br /><br /><em><font size=""2""><font color=""#ff00ff"">""I do see you sitting there, holding your black oozy heart in your hands crying to be noticed! I Notice! My Child I Notice! You've listened to the songs of the world for so long. When will you let me sing over youonce again? When will you allow me to be all you need? Give me your heart so I can choose whome to give it to; to give it to the person I designed it for when I made you. Why do you doubt me? I've carried you so far, and that was only the beginning. Don't be afraid. You were not alone. I raised you. I carried you. My grace is enough. My Love is more than enough. Yes, MY Love is enough. I am the one who will never let you down. My plan is enough. <br />Yes My Child, Forever changed. Forever freed. I AM the Son. It is I and only I who can set you free. Everything I have is yours. Without me there is no Love. No Joy, no Peace, no Patience, no Kindness, no gentleness, no Faithfulness, no SelfControl, No Good thing exsists apart from me. I alone satisfy your every need. Every hunger, every thirst, every desire. Yes My Child EVERY desire. When will you turn back? When will you break this covenant with death? When will you let go of the chains of your past? I've unlocked them, they bind you no more, yet you play with them, you hold them in your hands! What's the deal!? What holds you back? Why do you allow your heart be divided by others? Come to me you who are weary and I will give you rest; My rest. My Joy, My Peace, My Grace, My Patience, My Love, My Forgiveness. <br /><br />Let Go. <br /><br />It is meaningless. Why do you trust another? You cannont hide in the darkness. I still see you. I still take notice of you. I still collect each tear in a bottle and record each one in my book. Even when you run out of my arms I still care for you. Still watch My beautiful daughter....You. <br /><br />I will not give up. I will pursue you to the ends of the earth. Erin, I already have!! I've been to Hell and back for you! Can your chains say that? Why do you settle for less than what I have for you? <br />I will guard you. I will surround you always. I will change your heart. I've done it before! You have seen what I can do! Trust me to do it again. How? You ask me How? <br /><br />Child Run to me. Abondon yourself and run to me. Run into my embrace. Allow me to wrap you in my arms, it is what you want. I hear you cry to me each day. What holds you back? Surely not me, it is only you. <br />I Am all you need. It's ok...Accept that!! I will transform you. I will restore you. I have called you by name. Child you are Mine! <br /><br />What have I done to make you run?? <br />Allow your heart to break Child. Remember the height from which you have fallen. You long for my embrace, so Come. I will pour my love out on you like rain. Come, dig your fingers into my robed, hold on for all you have. I will hold you so very tight my Child, in My arms of love, holding you still holding you near. <br /><br />Don't compare what I am trying to do with anything you've known before. I will reveal all things in My time. <br /><br />You are irreplaceable. I have given you dreams for a reason. Walk in them.""</font> <br /></font></em><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />So How is my time at Asbury you wonder? *laughs* I don't have much time right now, because I must eat soon my belly is yelling at me!! People are amazing. God is... wow. Beyond Amazing. He is so much more than a distant deity. He's here. He walks beside us. You can see him reflected in each other's faces. He shows up in powerful ways just about everyday... well everyday if you are willing to see it. <br />It's taken me a little while to click into school work...but I'm getting there. I got really sick a few weeks ago and I got behind a little. I went to class but I couldn't do the outside work. This week and next is midterms...YIKE!! :-) But like my English prof Mrs. Jenkins said: ""One day at a time...keep going!"" <br /><br />I'm really excited...my family is starting to come back together as a unit. Amazing!! I'm loving it. <br /><br /><br />Alright I seriously need to go eat. <br /><br />Love you!!! <br /><br />(OH Megan we voted on class hymn today....I'll let you know!!)"

"event","<p>Hey Everyone!!<br /><br />I wanted to let you all know I am in fact in Kentucky at Asbury College now. Wow has it been awesome!! I only have a 20min. before I head out to my second class today. (Expos and Research)&nbsp; But I wanted to give a brief overview of what's going on.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />When I got here I found out more about our class name... We are the Unashamed Class of 2010.&nbsp; Our Verse is 1 John 2:28 ""And now dear children, continue in him, so that when he appears, we may be confident and unashamed before him at his coming.""&nbsp; Our colors are Black, Hot Pink, and White.&nbsp; (Asbury Colleges color are purple and white FYI). Oh yeah and our Motto is ""Unashamed..Before Him, Before the World""&nbsp; It's a cool theme...we heard the story of how our class sponsers (Two Seniors, Lizzy and Joel) arrived at the theme and motto. Basically it was a meshing of the minds.....Joel's vision was being a class unashamed and open before the Father...like children and a daddy. Loving God and God loving on us!! Lizzy's was being a class unashamed of who we are in Christ before the world...reallyl reaching out. I love it!!&nbsp;<br />For orientation we were split into TAG groups. (Transition and Guidance) My TAG leaders are Kat and Sam....they are so sweet and supper cool!! Sam even came and helped me set up and connect my computer!! Yippie!! Our TAG verse is Habbakuk 1:5 - ""Look at the Nations and watch- and be utterly amazed. For I {The Lord} am going to do something in your days that you would not believe, even if you were told.""<br /><br />College is amazing. I love it!! The girls on my hall are wonderful. One of the girls that lives right across the hall from me has two of my classes (a 9:25am Intro to Communication TR, and 8am at the Luce Theory of physical activity on R)&nbsp;<br /><br />Alright well I really need to grab my bag and head to my next class!! (*giggles* I'm taking classes!! Tee hee!!!*)&nbsp;<br /><br />OH yeah and we are singing some super cool songs in pre-chapel (chapel hasn't actually started yet but we've had some worship services in there during orientation) and Singspiration&nbsp;&nbsp; this is a part of one of the songs that really struck me...<br /><br />:The greastest love of all is mine......... You found me just as I am, empty handed but alive in your hand""&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Think about that!!&nbsp;<br />God is really doing amazing things even in this weekend. Wow.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />~Amazed and UnAshamed.~<br /><br /><br />OHHHH yeah one more thing....if I gave you my address, I found out you don't need to put my room number on there. Just my name and the colleges address.</p>"

"event","Greetings All!!&nbsp;<br /><br />So I'm very excited that more then two people read this!! :-) (sorry if that seems vain.)&nbsp;<br /><br />We've had to postpone my graduation ceremony/party until <font size=""4""><strong>Aug. 6th </strong></font><font size=""2"">I know I'm a pain in the butt!!&nbsp; The ceremony will be at 3pm at the church with the party after. If you need directions let me know.&nbsp;<br /><br /><br />It's been a fun week!!!!&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Friday night a group of us went to see Pirates of the Caribbean Dead Man's Chest.&nbsp; It was so much fun!! Alyssa and I went for coffee before hand and met up with Jon. Charamel Macciato Smoothies are absolutly amazing!!&nbsp; We had so much fun!! The movie was great!! So many great Jack quotes.&nbsp;<br /><br />On Sunday I spent the day with Alyssa and her family to celebrate her grandfather's and her mother's birthdays. We took her dog for a walk down by the river and sat on the bench and watched the water and talked. It was amazing. Althought somehow I got bird poop on my sleeve. It was sooooo gross!!! When we walked back home we sat side by side on the couch and worked on Sudoku puzzles and read ""Nightmare Acadamy"" by Frank Peretti.&nbsp; We got so crazy!! We started comparing our feet, and her mom came in and sat next to me and joined in.... it was great!! I laughed until I cried. Then lyssa and I starting thumb wrestling with our big toes....which led to leg wrestling!! *smiles* Such good times.&nbsp; We we went to the party at her Uncle's house we took three of the cousins down to the pond to fish. I caught a couple fish and I even touched it and took it off the hook!! *Swells with accomplishment!!* It was so funny to watch. Alyssa has been threatening me for months that she was going to take me fishing but I had to bait my own hook and free my own fish.&nbsp; When I caught it I let it hang for a sec, and she was helping her cousin get her fish off her hook and I just looked at my fish and planned my strategy. When I figured out what I was going to do I would reach my hand out, almost grab it and then my hand would jump back. It was hilarious. But I did it. I grabbed the fish took the hook out of it's mouth.........then dropped it!! I didn't mean to it jumped!!! But I caught it again and threw it back into the pond. I even helped the girls release theirs. I was proud!!&nbsp;<br />Alyssa and I have been having amazing conversations lately. I'm just...wow. We've talked alot about life and next year.&nbsp; Her and I have gotten so close so fast, I'll be honest I'm nervous about leaving. I will definitly miss her alot. Parts of me do already.&nbsp; But I'm so happy that we've been able to really enjoy this summer so far. Yes it's been hard, but we are making the best out of what we have. I've always wanted a best friend like this. Someone that I can go to movies and not get home until 2am!!!&nbsp; (That was fun!!)&nbsp; I love that I'm happy.&nbsp;<br /><br />Last night I went to see Pirates again only with Spork this time. Some great stories from then too!! I caught alot more quotes out of the movie the second time around.&nbsp;I got to hang out with some of her friends as well.&nbsp;<br />Life right now is amazing. I am happy. I'm doing my best to enjoy the few short weeks I have left before my world changes compleatly.&nbsp;<br /><br />Ok that's enough for now. I have to go work on college loan stuff. *arghs* <br /><br /></font>"

Our house however is an absolute mess with all the boxes stacked all over. *sigh*&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />My graduation isn't going to be as big as I wanted unfortunatly (not saying that in a whiny ""Sweet sixteen"" kinda way trust me. It's just that we've been throwing around cool ideas for the last few months and they aren't gonna happen now.) .... It's like next week and we still haven't sent the invatations...Life kinda got in the way ya know!!&nbsp; It's still planned for <font size=""3""><strong>July 14th</strong></font> (take note of that I might have told you different before...but it's Friday the 14th.)&nbsp; The Actual Ceremony will be at 6pm at the First United Methodist Church here in town. (If you need directions let me know. ) we are prolly gonna have cake and punch afterward. There will also be an open house before hand at my house from like 2 until the ceremony. Again if you need directions let me know.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />(I'm not sure who I'm addressing that to....I don't know who still reads this besides Matt and Megan...*laughs*)&nbsp;<br /><br /><br />I think I'm starting to liven up a little. My heart is still shredded though. I've noticed I'm alot quieter these last few weeks then I have been in a long time. It's weird, I'll start talking then just quit mid thought and my body won't want to talk anymore and it won't for a good second.... It's messed up.&nbsp;There are times that I just don't want to talk....It's not like me!!&nbsp;<br />I don't want to go to college like this..I'm afraid to. I want to step onto Kentucky soil feeling happy, whole, healthy, confidant...etc. Not arrogant, but assured.... Unashamed.&nbsp; (our class name by the way.... We are the Unashamed Class of 2010. I get to graduate in 2010!!!! *squeals*)&nbsp; College right now is worrying me. I know it shouldn't but it is. Abbi (my 2 1/2 year old neice) is staying with us for a few days while the rest of the family is away at ABC 123 camp. She is so adorable!! And such a Joy!!&nbsp; My mom was the one who is supposed to be watching her but because of everything else going on I've been doing it. It's been fun to have a little shadow.&nbsp; We went to the park last night and played on everything!! I got a really good picture of her on the swings. Once I get my laptop I'll be able to upload the pictures I take and show you. I have some really really good ones!!&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Having her so close though and being able to read her stories and watch the pure joy of a young child really makes me smile. I don't want to leave them. They are going to do so much growing in these next four years and I won't be here..... On one hand it's good that they are older then when Corey went because it'll be easier to stay in touch...I'll be able to call them, and they can send me pictures and letters.... But I feel like I'm going to miss so much. Here I've been this cheerleader for them encouraging their parents to try getting them in different things and I won't be here to support them. Example, the oldest Camryn (6) is showing amazing signs of physical talent. She really loves sports....running, balls, anything. She has so much energy!! She is getting pretty tall and is really thin..all muscle. They are starting her in gymnastics, and she might play soccer in the fall. (like I did!!) Come spring they might try softball as well (My encouragment!!) Ben(5) is going to be a great hands on make it work kinda guy. He loves exploring how things work. He is infatuated with Robots and spends hours playing with legos!! Abbi is the musician she loves listening and making music. And has a real knack for it too!!! And well the baby is still a little bit to young to know his tendancies.&nbsp; Don't get me wrong we aren't sterotyping these kids. Just going with the things that they have gravitated on their own towards and looking for ways to encourage that.&nbsp;<br />I know I can't hang on forever and It will be ok that I'm leaving.... but I'll miss them.&nbsp;<br />I'm so mixed right now. As much as I don't want to leave I can't wait and vice versa.&nbsp; I've literally hugged my mommy and said ""Mommy I'm so excited to go to college!!!!! ....Mommy I don't want to go.""&nbsp; She just laughs at me!&nbsp; The good news is I think I pretty much have all the paper work done. I have to finish the loan stuff, the medical stuff, and I still haven't gotten word on my roommate yet, but that's it. I already have my classes picked.&nbsp;<br /><br />Alright well I'm going to go grab a snack (babysitting takes alot of energy!!) and read for a little bit I think.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />"

"event","Yeah so I'm not ok. I'm trying to be but I'm just not. I don't know how I need to grieve, so I'm not sure if I am.&nbsp; I know I'm beyond stressed, and am absolutly weak.&nbsp; For the last few weeks I've been supporting everyone else and I just can't take it anymore. I need to be supported but I don't know how to do that in a healthy way. Everyone that I normally go to are nose high in life as well...&nbsp;
&nbsp;I've been doing my best to be tolerant of how everyone else needs to grieve but I don't feel as though I'm getting that courtesy back. If I'm not perfect I get unloaded on. I have to take it when someone yells at me because they are hurting but if I make a quick comment, or don't walk around the house all happy I get yelled at for ""making it all about me."" and ""Everyone hurts Erin not just you.""&nbsp; So I find my self bottling it all in.&nbsp;Not allowing myself to feel. I sat stone still at the funeral...I didn't cry.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the funeral dinner I wanted to go away...I wanted to drive so I could sort through everything and let myself feel, and to be there for someone else in my life who needed me. I was going to come back in time to rejoin the family when everyone came back together but&nbsp; ""No you can't go your family needs you."" Yeah. Sure they did. Everyone&nbsp;went off&nbsp;there own seperate ways and I was left alone again.&nbsp; I'm sorry if this sounds bitter and angry.... I just.... I hate feeling this way. But I&nbsp;also hate feeling like I don't matter....that I'm&nbsp;the grunt kid. It's hard to stand in a funeral home looking at my dad's arms around my mother,&nbsp;Herb's arms around Bridget, Corey holding Kristy, and&nbsp;Bill holding my Aunt.....and me standing in the middle of the room alone. I couldn't let my self fall apart because I knew that I would have had to pick myself up and I don't have the strength to do both. 
&nbsp;I'm back to being disconnected and insecure. I went to Pam and John's on thursday because I had to go to the doc. in Jamestown friday morning. I stayed with them until saturday. It was nice to sleep but I didn't get enough by any means. After my appointment We did a little shopping. I walked around wringing and fiddling with my hands close to my chest so quiet. I hated that I was afraid and insecure for no reason.&nbsp;
I don't feel safe.&nbsp;&nbsp; I really want someone to come and put me to sleep. To hold me so close so I feel safe so I can sleep...like real sleep knowing somone is there to guard me and protect me. Someone to trust is going to protect me....but who? I'm trying to let God do it..but it's hard.&nbsp; I desire the physical and it's no where to be found.&nbsp; Aside from that I don't know what I need. Talking isn't helping but then again I&nbsp;don't know who to talk to.&nbsp; I want alone time in the way that I want to get away from having to be perfect and supporting everyone else, yet being physcially alone magnifies the loneliness.&nbsp; But when I go out with other people I get so insecure and panic that it makes things worse.&nbsp;&nbsp;
I don't know how much longer I can do this..... I've told God I want to give up but in all reality that's impossible. Give up from what? This is life...full on. No way but forward.&nbsp;
I guess I'm searching for someone who cares about me. Even just for a moment..... someone that I can talk to without them jumping in and ""I remember when..."" or you just need to do this....&nbsp; I need to feel safe."

"event","Hi.&nbsp;


Umm....My grandmother died.&nbsp; There really isn't an easy way to say that.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Monday June 19th, my mother and brother took her to Walmart and out to eat to celebrate her 83rd birthday. She was great! She was laughing and joking with them...having a great time.&nbsp; That night she had horrible horrible stomach cramps. My parents stayed with her in the emergency room until after 1am. They got up at like 4am to take my brother back to the airport so he could catch his flight. Later that day my grandmother had surgery to repair a bowel obstruction. Thankfully they just had to unkink a part that had twisted. Because of her age they put her in the ICU on a ventilater. They told her as soon as she could breathe well enough on her own they would take it off. Mom said she looked really good. Wed. she took a small downward slope. They tried a couple times to take her off the vent but it wouldn't work. Thursday she slipped a little more. They had a priest (She was catholic) come in and he read her the last rites...no sooner had he said Amen, her blood pressure dropped into the single digits.
&nbsp;I was counseling at Wesley Woods all last week. I got a message about the surgery, and I had talked to my mom like wed. and she said everything was doing ok. Not perfect but not awful.&nbsp; I got a call from her at 6am Friday morning saying the hospital had just called her and things weren't looking good. My plan was to stay at camp until lunch and then come home until dinner. I called my mom's cell phone at 10:15am to check in and tell her that and my daddy answered the phone sobbing. He choked out ""gramma's gone"" and I lost it. See my daddy doesn't weep very often. I've only seen him weep when his father died, and cried at the memorial service for his brother.&nbsp; After she was read the last rites she just slowly drifted off in peace.&nbsp;

Today were the viewings.&nbsp; *sigh* My aunt came from Arizona on sunday, her boyfriend flew in last night, Corey and his girlfriend Kristy drove up from Kentucky on Saturday.&nbsp; It's been a long day. There have been alot of great funny moments though. I'll get into those at a later entry.&nbsp;
Tomorrow is the funeral. Bridget, Corey, and I are playing Amazing Grace on handbells. Pray for us that God would grant us the strength and the grace to get through it well.&nbsp;
Pray that our family can get through this. Right now all of us have big major things going on in our lives right now outside of this. Bridget is hitting huge bumps in trying to close on a house, Corey is on tour with the Raleigh Ringers. (Praise God it's all in this general area this week so he's been able to drive back and forth each night. They even rented him a car and are paying for his gas. It's amazing.) And I have deadlines to meet with scholarships and other college forms...trying to decided about loans, meal plans......things I don't want to think about.&nbsp;

I hate this guys. I really seriously do. I was stressed out before this and now I feel like I'm at my breaking point. I hate the idea that whomever I marry and any children that I may have will never know any of my grandparents.&nbsp; Even if I married Matt, Stephen, Allan or Tom..... yes you all have had experiences with them but you don't know them. I hate it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't think I'm grieving well. i don't know how I need to grieve. I don't know how I want to grieve. It's really hard for me right nwo that everyone else has a significant other and I sit there alone. Everyone here is grieving so people's triggers are alot shorter. I understand that and I respect that...it just fuels the need for perfection, thus more stress. Thursday night I have to stay at Pam and John's so maybe I'll finally get some sleep.&nbsp; Part of me wants to go away, build a fire and have the right person with me that can help me learn to greive. I want to just compleatly weep...to release all these emotions that are being stuffed inside....but I don't know how.&nbsp;&nbsp; Parts of me have been preparing for this day since my other gradmother died three years ago.&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't know what to do.&nbsp; I am an emotional wreck.&nbsp; I think I started which would be great but also adds to the problem.&nbsp; 
I want to sleep but I don't know how.&nbsp;
I know God promises never to give us more then we can handle, and his yoke is easy and his burden is light.....it's getting really close right now.&nbsp;

I need my Jesus."

"event","Here is a thought I would like your brain-blending on.&nbsp; Do you think that everyone on earth could get along if everyone actually tried?&nbsp; If everyone did their best to remember to meet halfway, turn about is fair play (makes you seriously think twice before you do something....but also reminds you to give back what you've been given...well the good things anyways....), and to approach each day as a new start?&nbsp; Or are there personalities that just can't be close and can't help but create turmoil?&nbsp; Is there seriously people set apart to be your best friend and your partner, or are your best friends your best friends because you are both trying?&nbsp; In other words can anyone be your best friend, or is a best friend truly something special and amazing? <br /><br /><br /><br />I sat down last night and wrote this.&nbsp; I am actually really proud of it because I am not usually able to write like this!!

Last night was my final performance with the Erie Jr. Philharmonic. *tear* It was a little frustrating. We were playing three pieces for the Grand Opening of the Tom Ridge Evironmental Center in Erie. We were playing ""Presque Isle Celebration,"" a piece written for the Erie Jr. Phil. by a former member for the 50th Anniversary Celebration a few years ago, ""Hungarian March,"" which was one of the pieces I played my first day at Jr. Phil ( the first piece I had to transpose actually!! The funny thing was I got halfway through it the one week and kept forgetting week to week to finish it. So I'd be playing along and then lean over to see Leanna's music. I finally finished it though!!) and then ""Hoe-down"" (the ""beef it's what's for dinner"" commercial theme song.)  The only problem was, everyone in the ""Audience"" kept talking....most of them didn't make much of an effort to even try and be quiet. We were all arranged into an open area just inside the front doors. I'll admit it was quite a neat trick fitting almost 100 students in concert attire, chairs, stands, and instruments into the space they did. However all their talking made it difficult to hear and we got off in Presque Isle Celebration; it was kind of a let down because it was such a great piece.   Oh well.   After the ""concert"" we had to turn in music and everyone but the seniors had to turn in their folders.  I like that we get to keep our folders....however I didn't have a chance to have my name put on it like everyone else. 

Monday is Memorial day. Unfortunatly this day holds mixed memories for me. I try to keep coming back to what the day means, however memories of past years keep flooding back. It's hard to face it right now. I don't want to remember how things used to be. I don't want to feel that pain again. I don't want to remember staying up all night with my 'best friend'..pushups on the deck....marching in the rain....walking the dog...and having my heart shattered and running away.  I don't want to think about the friends I've lost, or who are lost to me right now...the number seems overwhelming....

...more to come....."

"event","Hmm it's been awhile since I've posted...I'll give you a brief recap...

Sunday night our church started a contemporary worship service for Sunday nights. I'm not going to say much more about it now just cause you can't really judge after one night. I'm staying open for a few weeks to see how it will settle down and grow. I can really see it being a good thing! We did alot of singing though that makes me happy!! Now we just need to teach everyone how to worship!! 

On monday I went to the doc. again and finally found out that I had/have CMV. Basically it's a virus that gives mono-like symptoms. Hence the sore throat, tiredness, loss of appatite..etc. etc. The good news we know what's wrong, the bad news is we still just have to wait it out for the next couple weeks. *sigh* I'm tired of not feeling well!! 

Let's see tuesday night I went to Jr. Phil...only to find out we don't have ensemble rehearsals anymore >_< d'oh. So I was a nice hour early. The good news is though we only have rehearsals until 8:30ish now instead of 9:30ish. Rock on!!! 

Today..hmm today. *sigh*  I took my playing test today in band...definitly blew it. *sigh* I know this music so well but I was tired to begin with and didn't feel well and then adding the nerves on top wore me out so I couldn't stay up on top of it at all. Hopefully I'll be able to redo it before it's offically graded.  I've been so sluggish all day today. I hate it.  Instead of going to Rush I stayed here and helped my sister with her kids. Tonight was Teacher night at KFC (Kids for Christ) so I went to dinner with her so she wasn't alone managing the four kids during a potato bar.  When we got back I decided to see how well Cammi could jog...so we went jogging. She is amazing!! She's like 5 and jogged with me about 5 blocks. I was so happy!! She was doing a really good pace too.  I'm excited about this...hopefully together we will be able to build up stamina so this summer I can run to her house over on the southside and take her out with me... good bonding times for us!! They are such good kids.  We have the three older ones here overnight cause tomorrow is the ""Daughters of the Church Banquet"" so it's less hassle for bridget just to have them here. 
 
Things are really getting down to the wire as far as school goes. *sigh* I have an evaluation date of June 14th. I'm planning on having my graduation ceremony/ party in July that way I have my dipolma.  

Ok I really don't feel good at this point...so I'm going to stop pretending like I do. *sigh*

"event","Tonight was the night of the Titusville High School Prom 2006. Guess where I was??? In Frankling avoiding the whole thing!! *grins Wide* It's actually amusing how many people this week got mad that I wasn't going to my senior Prom. Everyone said they would have invited me yet no one did. Hmmm?? It's all good though, why mess with a good thing? The last two years were good, why risk going out on a lemon? However my small aknowledgment to prom is that I made my userpic one of last years pictures. Enjoy!
 So while everyone else was dancing their hearts out, I was taking my little to the SummerHouse coffee shop to see the same people I saw last week at Brother Bean. Good times man!! Towards the end Grace took my camera went around and just started snapping pictures of everyone. It was great!! I love pictures like that. I'm just not brave enough to do it. I'm back in love with all my pictures. I'm trying to arrange a my photobucket account so you can enjoy them too.  I've actually spent most of my day playing around in pictures. 
 John is actually going to take my Senior pictures next friday. I'm kinda nervous. I really want them to turn out really well...I just don't know how to make sure they do. Like right now when I look in the mirror I really like this new hairstyle I'm trying out...but then when I see it in pictures I'm not so sure... same when it's curly. Hmm.... I'd like to take senior pictures with my hair straight, curly, and Up in a fancy way. But I don't know how to do all three without taking hours. Any suggestions?!?!? Anyone wanna come help me next friday?? *wink wink nudge nugde* Plus I have to figure out outfits. AHHHH!!  I do trust that John is going to do well with the poses..I am his kid after all. He already has some in mind....he wants to make sure I bring my guitar...o_O.  Oh my mommy and I are also getting our picture taken together for Mother's Day/ Her 50th Birthday. 

I've also rediscovered Relient K tonight as well. ""Sadie Hawkins Dance, Mood Ring, Chap Stick Chapped Lips and Things like Chemistry""....great lyrics!! 

(Should I tell you to draw nearer or go away? Do I speak my truth, or keep my mouth shut and Endure?    ""My God I draw Near.."" )

  ""Have mercy on me, O God, according to your unfailing love; according to your great compassion blot out my transgressions. Wash away all my iniquity and cleanse me from my sin. For I know my transgressions, and my sin is always before me. Against you, you only, have I sinned and done what is evil in your sight, so that you are proved right when you speak and justified when you judge. Surely I was sinful at birth, sinful from the time my mother conceived me. Surely you desire truth in the inner parts; you teach me wisdom in the inmost place. Cleanse me with hyssop, and I will be clean; wash me, and I will be whiter than snow. Let me hear joy and gladness; let the bones you have crushed rejoice. Hide your face from my sins and blot out all my iniquity. Create in me a pure heart, O God, and renew a steadfast spirit within me. Do not cast me from your presence or take your Holy Spirit from me. Restore to me the joy of your salvation and grant me a willing spirit, to sustain me. Then I will teach transgressors your ways, and sinners will turn back to you. Save me from bloodguilt, O God, the God who saves me, and my tongue will sing of your righteousness. O Lord, open my lips, and my mouth will declare your praise. You do not delight in sacrifice, or I would bring it; you do not take pleasure in burnt offerings. The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit; a broken and contrite heart, O God, you will not despise. In your good pleasure make Zion prosper; build up the walls of Jerusalem. Then there will be righteous sacrifices, whole burnt offerings to delight you; then bulls will be offered on your altar."" ~Psalm 51~"

"event","Geez Where do I start!!?!? 
Ok so Tuesday was the tour of schools with Jr. Phil. Amazing!! I woke up really late though..we were supposed to leave at 7:30am, I got up at 7:20!! My dad said he tried to wake me up, and my alarm went off..I just slept right through it. I really didn't feel well at all but I threw on my dress tossed up my hair and dashed to the car. I took a little nap on the way. Praise God we still made it before the bus got there!! So we played a concert in Cambridge Springs and then went to the Riverside Inn for lunch. Then we went to Girard. Oh. Boy. By this time we were all tired and giddy. For the last few rehearsals and performances including Cambridge Springs I haven't been able to sit beside Cory (bassoon) but at Girard we all fit where we are supposed to go. While we were sitting there waiting to play Cory started tossing his head...I gave him a funny look and he said 
""oh Sorry I just had a song stuck in my head."" my reply ""Oh yeah? What song?"" Cory: ""Umm *thoughtfully* I don't remember""  Definitly one of the highlights!! 
 At lunch Mr. Dolwick asked if anyone could play at Mercyhurst College wed. night...they would pay. I jumped on it..sure man why not. We got handed the music before we left Girard.  

So that brings me to Last night. They also needed a string quartet so five of us were there from Jr. Phil. Long story short when I finally got there (i got lost on campus and there was major construction) I paniced. I couldn't find the other Jr. Phil members and I was under the impression that it was going to be a full orchastra. Hmm Not So Much!! Finally I more people came inluding the others that I knew. (they had their strings rehearsal that ran late) gradually as I heard the music it got easier.  On our lunch break Carrie and Jonathon and I hopped into Carrie's van and ate pizza!! And then got dressed and enjoyed the show.  It turned out that it was Mercyhurst's Composer Spotlight Series and the Senior Showcase for Richard Rockage.  The string quintet (the had a piano as well) was amazing!!!  We did alright for the second half...it pulled apart a few times but hey. It was fun to just get to know the other Jr. Phil members a little bit more. Rehearsal is hard for that since well...we have to play!! 

Now I have to go get ready for the Jr. Phil Brass Ensemble concert tonight. *sigh* I've never played this much before!!! I mean a three hour rehearsal last saturday, a full concert Sunday, 45 min. in band on monday, two full concerts on tuesday plus practicing that night on my own, last night about four hours total between rehersal and then the concert, band today and now rehearsal and performance for ensembles!! I'm starting to go crazy!!!  But it is Oh so much Fun!!! 

Catch ya later. 

"" 3 Trust in the LORD and do good; 
       dwell in the land and enjoy safe pasture. 

 4 Delight yourself in the LORD 
       and he will give you the desires of your heart. 

 5 Commit your way to the LORD; 
       trust in him and he will do this: 

 6 He will make your righteousness shine like the dawn, 
       the justice of your cause like the noonday sun. 

 7 Be still before the LORD and wait patiently for him; 
       do not fret when men succeed in their ways, 
       when they carry out their wicked schemes."" Psalm 37:3-7"

"event","Wow yesterday was soooo much fun!! My mom drove home sunday morning and went to church with my dad while I got ready for my concert. My hair still looked good from my night out at the coffee shop so I just straightend it and curled the ends again and clipped it back. It was amazing how well and easy it worked. (My hair does NOT cooperate!!) I found some of my old makeup and used that and it added a little bit more of a spark to the whole outfit...It was so much fun!! Mom and I drove together to Edinboro and dad followed. (a friend lent us her car for the weekend so everyone could get where they needed to be for all the different concerts and stuff. Man she's amazing....just handed over the keys. Wow.) Mom and I talked all the way about how the festival went. *Smiles* It was so nice to talk to her and her to share what God was doing. To talk more as friends...equals then ""mother daughter"". She even asked me to help her plan out the devotions for the weekend. God really used them in mighty ways too!! Hmm God is good.  
I got to the auditorium right on time. I was greeted with a Senior Corsage. It was so pretty!! I wasn't expecting it either. I love it when that happens!  Actually, when I walked in I saw one of the other seniors with one and the thought went through my head that I wanted one, but it was prolly just something his mom did and I submitted my insecurities, my selfish desires back to God and humbled myself before him.....10 min. later one of the parents came over and gave me one. *smiles*  
I had asked my mom to get flowers out of our garden for the other girls in my horn section. (I was thinking Daffidils or something...She came out with tiny purple pansies. At first I was disapointed and was afraid that it wouldn't be ""good enough"" But I went with it. Turns out mom picked excactly five, and all the girls liked them! Andrea and Chelsea put theirs over thier right ear...so the rest of us followed suit. It was so pretty!! 
The concert itself went really really well. Everyone looked so classy; the guys in Tuxs, and the girls in black. It was actually kinda funny to look around at the wide spread of girls outifts. From a black t-shirt, black jeans and sandels, to full out concert dresses.  We all played really well too. Personally i got a little jumpy on my entrances as the concert wore on, and Chelsea dropped her mute during Alladin. *rolls her eyes* I can't wait to hear the recording!!  Right before we played Alladin (the last piece) they recognized the seniors. They called each one by name and had them come to the front of the stage after greeting Mr. Dolwick and receiving a plaque. *amazed* It was brilliant!! It's a really pretty plaque too. 
After the concert we all had to sit on stage to take a group picture. Sounds harmless right...?  It took like a half an hour!!! Just sitting there. People were definitly getting restless!! When we were finally done we took Horn pictures. I love my section!! We just sat on the edge of the stage, let our feet dangle and held our horns...then they wanted to take a straight faced one...(HA) then we all crossed our legs in towards Chelsea and posed... then Andrea and Elise sat back to back. Chelsea jumped in front and Leanna and I went back to back behind...it was awesome!! 
 After those pictures were taken mom took me outside to try and take a ""senior"" pic for in my graduation announcments. Two out of the three might work. The other one was really good but right when she took the picture the wind blew some hair in my face. >_<. 
OH yeah I forgot to mention that my sister and her family came too!! I was soooo happy!!! I knew they wanted to come but I didn't think they were going to make it. The kids were sooo good for the concert too. They have shown all along to be kinda musical but this was a big long concert...at least for marching band things they could have something to watch also. But they have been watching this tv show called ""Little Einsteins."" Basically each episode focuses on a famous classical piece and gets the kids used to it. They put cute little words to it sometimes and uses the song to accomplish some mission. Two of the like 6 pieces we played they knew. So they were sooo excited that they knew that song. (Hall of the Mountain King by Greig...from Peer Gynt, and The second movement of Davork's New World Symphony, more commonly known as Going Home. Plus I think they recognized Alladin too.) While they were all waiting to go outside Abbi was walking around the seats singing the melody to Going Home at like the top of her lungs...and she was hitting the notes right on!! She's Two!!!! It was wonderful!!  Mom said she was coloring during the concert and she would just stop and start directing with her crayon. And nodding her head or tapping her hands or feet to the beat. *Smiles* That's my girl!! 

Once we finally left Edinboro mom and I took off again in the borrowed car and headed for Grove City Hoss's and dad went home. We had minor car trouble but got it fixed and went on our way again. We were going to Hoss's to meet up with all the bell ringers for dinner after their concert. I'm really glad we could do that. This way I felt like I was able to do it all. We were pretty crazy at dinner too!!  Everyone had a great weekend and really came together and bonded as a group away from the table. That is very important.   Last night when I came home I just sat outside in our back yard and relaxed in the night air. It was a beautiful night!! 

Today has been a good day as well. In school today we played ""Ode to Joy"" to practice for graduation. I rocked it!! Playing so much this weekend really helped. It felt good to pick it up this year and nail the parts that I've struggled with the last couple years.  After band I went back to the doctors and told him that my throat is still bugging me, I still don't have any desire to eat, and I'm tired. Not like tired in the way that I want to sleep all the time, but It takes so much effort just to do what I need to do in a day. So he ordered a repeat mono spot and strep test, thyroid, and something he said was kinda like mono..but was like CMV? (Is that right Megan??) somethin like that anyways. So I go back next monday to see how I'm doing then. *sigh*  I left from the doctors and went to the hospital and had the blood work done, then met up with Karen for coffee. 
 We met at the coffee shop, and her daughter met up with us too at first. Then karen and I took our coffee and went for a walk down to Shiede Park and sat on a park bench and talked. It was really good. It really helped me realize how much I've changed since this retreat. That I am ok.  I was realizing this week that I know how to be the prodigal. I know how to to be broken and rebellious etc. etc. I even know how to be broken before God and come home. But much like Luke 15 my story seems to end there...during the party. I don't know how to live as this new creation. But I'm gettin there. I don't want to go back...I mean I do..but I won't. I'm finding Joy, I'm finding that the Joy of the Lord truly is my strength.  It's hard though I'm not going to lie. Already I've seen myself this week take little baby steps back toward the middle. But I'm staying on top of it. I'm reading the Word the first thing in my day, and the last thing in my day, even when I don't feel like it.  Jesus told a story of a man who had a demon cast out. The demon roamed around looking for someone else, but couldn't find anything so he went back to his guy and looked around. The man was swept clean...but empty. So the punk demon went and found like seven friends and reinhabited the man even worse then before. Pastor Dave posed a good question during a sermon. Whats the fastest and easiest way to get air out of a glass? A vaccuum would break the glass.....   Just fill it with water.  I'm clean now. I'm forgiven and free...but that's not the end of the story. Now comes the time of activly living out my faith. It's time for the renewing of my mind. It's about walking, not following, but walking hand in hand and filling the emptiness with Christ. If I ""feel"" like it or not. It's truth.  I still have authority issues. I still try to get my way in a situation... I need to work on that. I need to get back to submitting. See I didn't used to have authority issues. Man if there was  rule I followed it!! But I think when I became Drum major I did have a different set of rules to follow. Such I was in a place of leadership for so long, it is hard for me to be under authority. It was really really great though to part with Karen and have her say ""Sounds like you are doing well. Good Job, keep it up"" Instead of ""You'll get it kid... make a choice"" or a threat.  I am doing ok. We talked about college. I seriously can not wait for it. To be able to go and be in a group (hall) and be surrounded with People my age or older and just having fun doing things together...like going to the grill, playing cards...doing goofy stuff. Having a group to pray with and study with... Being able to let go compleatly of the strongholds here. (I can say that because I would have to choose to take them with me...I choose not to.) 
 After karen and I talked for like an hour and a half, I deposited my tax returns (YAY!!!!) and turned in my application to Pizza Hut. So we'll see what happens there. I don't know what to do about this summer. I really don't want to work. I want to be able to just be free to choose what I need to do in a day and be at the whim of everyone elses schedules. But i guess it's a good thing to work...seeing as how most people are going on mission trips during the summer. It will keep my hands and my mind from becoming idle....right?  OH! I got a call today from my old camp dean. He wants me to counsel for him in June. That would rock!! I love that camp. He said he needed my energy!! *giggles* I had so much fun doing that camp two years ago. That was my first time as a real counselor.  So maybe it will work out. But if I do that and ARC (which I haven't heard a thing about yet..) that's two weeks right there that I would have to take off work...:-/. Plus I really do want to go to St. Louis....*arghs* Don't know what to do!! So please pray that God would orchastrate my summer. I took the step to turn in the application..now it's up to him to make something or nothing out of it!! 


""The heavens declare the glory of God; the skies proclaim the work of his hands. Day after day they pour forth speech; night after night they display knowledge. There is no speech or language where their voice is not heard. Their voice goes out into all the earth, their words to the ends of the world. In the heavens he has pitched a tent for the sun, which is like a bridegroom coming forth from his pavillion like a champion rejoicing to run his course. It rises at one end of the heavens and makes its circuit to the other; nothing is hidden from its heat. The law of the lord is perfect, reviving the soul. The statutes of the Lord are trustworthy, making wise the simple. The precepts of the Lord are right, giving joy to the heart. The commands of the Lord are radiant, giving light to the eyes. The fear of the Lord is pure, enduring forever. The ordinances of the Lord are sure and altogether righteous. They are more precious than gold, than much pure gold; they are sweeter than honey, than honey from the comb. By them is your servant warned; in keeping them there is great reward. Who can discern his errors?
   Forgive my hidden faults. Keep your servant also from willful sins; may they not rule over me. Then will I be blameless, innocent of great transgression. May the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be pleasing in your sight, O Lord, my Rock and my Redeemer."" ~Psalm 19~"

Even if you're not a girl, you're very feminine.
You're in touch with your feelings, and your heart rules you.
A bit of a emotional roller coaster, one moment you're up and the next you're down.

You fall in love quickly and easily. And very often.

You give and take equally in relationships.

You tend to get very attached when you're with someone. You want to see your love all the time.

You love your partner unconditionally and don't try to make them change.

You stay in love for a long time, even if you aren't loved back. When you fall, you fall hard.</font></td></tr></table><div align=""center""><a href=""http://www.blogthings.com/howareyouinlovequiz/"">How Are You In Love?</a></div>

"event","Wow today turned out to be a really good day. I had the ""dress rehearsal"" for my Jr. Phil concert today in Edinboro, stopped by my former voice teacher's house and payed the rest of my what I owed for lessons and got to talk to her for a sec...that was nice. I've missed her a bit. Then I was on my own. My dad is working a shift at the firestation, and my mom is with the bell choir so it's just the dog and I. I couldn't figure out what I wanted/needed to do....go be with people or be compleatly alone. I came home from rehearsal, got something to eat and just started watching Tv....It really wasn't cutting it and it was only like 2:30 in the afternoon. I really didn't want to read because of all the music I had played that morning, and I knew that If I took a nap I wouldn't sleep tonight. So I decided to message Brittney and see maybe what she was doing...if by same chance maybe she wanted to hang out or something. As it turns out the ""band"" that lead our worship at the retreat. (Elizabeth Hamm from Galloway..we go ""way"" back, Danette from New Mexico, and Tonga from India)were playing at a coffee house. (not the one that karen kinda owns.) So we decided to meet up and go. (YAY!!) So I cleaned up my 'partment a little and decided to actually make it a ""date"" and like do the hair, the make-up, the outfit...the ""special shower"" (you know girls..the one where we use the ""special"" shampoos, and body wash, and exfoliate....well you get the idea!) I really enjoyed the fact that I was getting ""prettied up"" for no other reason then that I wanted to. It wasn't for a guy, or a concert, or an interview...it was because I wanted too!!  It all worked really well I might add. (If I may say so myself!!) I wore my brown dress pants and my ""baby doll"" (man I'm using a lot of quotation marks and parentheses tonight!!) t-shirt that I got from ATF this year...baby blue with Dut. 4:20 (I think) scrolled on it. It has a couple green and a couple white flowery things on it...I relaly like it.  Hmm ya know details don't relaly matter do they? 
 It was a really nice time out. Grace (one of the girls that used to be in my Jr. High Uplinks) insisted on buying me coffee!! She's so sweet.  Brittney and and and uh-oh I forgot her name...Lori? Played a three person game of war. (with cards) I like beat them both by a lot!!  karen was there, we played chess. Don't ever play chess with a former math teacher. You lose...HARD!!  I tell you what...I don't think there is much that woman hasn't done!! She's crazy! 
I was really excited though to see Danette and Tonga again. I thought they had to fly back when Nathan left. But they are here until May!!! Yippie!! 

So yeah anyways...continuing with the trend of spoiling myself my face is covered in a green masque...and it is definitly dry...I can't move my face!! Oh. My. Goodness. It's definitly 3:19am!!! *laughs*"

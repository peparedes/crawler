"event","i know it's been awhile since i last made an entry and at that time i was really too worried about some unimportant jerks trying to marr my self respect and thus make themselves feel better or something but here i am again in Texas, not being able to find my cell phone. about that whole ""bully"" thing, i never really believed that people push others around to feel better about themselves but thats really true. if you could think back to when you last made fun of someone, and i mean anything from teasing to wooping their ass, you could really put it in one single category. you did it because you wanted to. thats how every action is, you do or do not. enough of that. sometimes i wonder why i dont just chill out and stop making little  comments like my previous one on here, and just sit back and relax. well, when you think about it, who really DOES chill out? not you, reader, and certainly not me on or off adderrol. and what the fuck would i talk about if i didnt make tiny unimportant points at society? my day? my day is first of all, not important and second of all not interesting. not yet at least. i plan for more. i hope my will can match those plans and dreams."

"event","Stop whatever it is that you are thinking. now listen to me, or anybody, for once. it may sound like im making acusations(spelling?) but in reality you probably weren't listening. you have tried, succeeded a couple of times but usually we are so busy with ourselves we dont have time to really listen. so stop right now. just stop. listen to your surroundings, wind, family or friends talking, laughing, yelling, the t.v., that ringy noise you hear when there is nothing else to hear, your own heartbeat. enjoy it. just lose yourself in this sound.

now listen to me in your head as you read this, stop worrying, stop fussing. play these words in your head every day, you will need them maybe 100 times a day what with the way we think these days. ""it's in the past."" thats just it, its in the past and thats where it will stay if you let it. if you want it to.weve all got an asshole, a jerk, a bitch, a ranting lunatic, an annoying younger sibling in us. no ""ifs"" thats just how it is. now listen to yourself for five seconds, five seconds of selfishness, just you. what do you really want to do. keep reading? move on to someone who has something easier to read or doesnt demand for you to change for the better? change for good is so difficult especially if you cant see your evils. most likely you are thinking of something wrong with you, if you are, odds are its the smallest problem you have, if even that. so just shut up for a second. ask someone else to insult you, someone you know. 

i saw these jerks at my school throwing shit at a friend of mine, Freddy, for getting to class faster by walking between a huge square of sidewalk, he got to class on time and didnt get a detention but people pretended to dislike him. they dont even know his name, or if both of his parents are alive or if he has ever seen someone die right in front of him or if he still has a swingset in his backyard from when he was little and still swings on it occasionally. they threw fries at him, fries. havent you done that before? of course you have. been with a group and considered yourself part of it, that is what EVERYONE is like when they are in a group and happen upon an individual. you become shit, you become just like every other jerk in the world. 

i have a few people who hate me on my mind of late. nothing horrible ive done, just life happening to people. see, people like my haters say i dont know them, but really, who DOESNT know them? their sort? havnt you ever been disliked because a lack of a million common interests, or the sort that dislikes being called a single word uttered throughout time and is meant to offend, meant to destroy relationships and can if you let it. of course they have both happened to me. ive been called whitey before by a couple of guys before, both taller, both wearing basketball clothes and sporting goatees. i looked at them and smiled, nothing like a smirk or even a smile like i thought they were sad, i just smiled, passing on some happyiness. they didnt say anything. i walked on.

so stop. always stop before you call a stranger a bitch for wearing the same sweater as you or just for loookig like one. odds are shes a Freddy, someone who is so easily loved, so easily enjoyed, so long as you dont destroy her with your neverending selfishness. i like to say that i have only one friend. i have millions but only one at a time. any more and you become a jerk. please just try to control yourselves. please. for me and for the person you are about to abuse. someone needs to tell guys this, teenage boys that are so afraid that they feel they have to defend themselves with a rough body and a cold heart. girls odds are most of your guy friends are a jerk to someone else. ive been the ""someone else"" and ive been the jerk. its so easy to be a jerk. its so hard to come back out of it. and its even harder just living or NOT killing the jerk when you are the ""someone else"".ladies, odds are you are a jerk too. you know it. stop."

"event","its been awhile viewer. i can still be a jerk, especially when im thinking ive finally stopped being the asshole ive been before. oh well, im learning i guess. im tired, my throat aches, i still feel jittery and nervous when i think of the battle anastasia knows what i mean. i had this huge great idea of an entry to make while i was mowing the lawn...as always, and i just never got back into that mood after finally finishing. its really too bad we have so many powerfull people on the planet that think that they are better than hitler because they want to perfect it, perfectly safe, perfectly attractive, balanced, equal, beautiful. and they may not know it, but i dont want to live in hell just yet. true hell is perfection. boring, nothing spontaneous, perfection in every meaning the word has. oh i could be wrong, maybe by trying to perfect the world more than just myself notices where we are going, and they will protest, they will rage for imperfection in every way possible, maybe even destroy what we have so far. im tired of hearing people say, after complaining about their current situation, ""well, then again, i could be one of those little africans starving."" no offence to the one who brought it to my attention, but you ARENT an african, well not in africa at least. and nobody looks at their life and says this is the worst thing to ever exist and everyone knows it, unless they intend to kill themselves afterwards. they are rarely the ones deserving of suicide. they havent seen real pain. back to the original topic, even the little africans probably say, at least im alive. everyone grows into their environment and situation, its one thing that seperates us from many animals, they cant accomodate themselves to any new surroundings. i may, yet again, be wrong.we need more jerks in this world. were running out of bad guys, and the less bad guys the more good guys and when there are no more bad guys then who is good? you cant have one without the polar opposite. maybe i just justify people and their actions so i tell myself what they did to me was not their fault, they werent thinking. so therefore they would not be a bad guy, they would be a normal person. and the more normal people i think i see the less truely good people i see, i get them confused. aaah my brain. im having a bad a.d.d. week. it feels like the medicine isnt working, the more i try to focus the less i actually can even hear the person. im tired. i want a good nights rest. sometimes i dont realize how much of my life is affected by my add. i see people listening, writing things down in class, and i feel like im helpless, i cant do anything right. i have no control of what my brain shows me, pictures of things that terrified me as a child, like that buffy the vampire slayer episode with the guys that floated around off the ground slightly, wearing suits, looking like dry corpses with smiles on their faces. my dreams are louder lately. a room of nothing but a pool filled with swimmers and sharks amongst them. someone talking to me very close, i can only see the left side of the pool from an angle. he/she is saying something to me, their mouth moves they make noise but i hear nothing but buzzing. i hate the buzzing i hear in my dreams, makes them more like nightmares when i think of it later. and i want to help the people in the pool, but i cant move, the jerk in front of me blocks my way and for some reason i dont want to walk around this person. eventually there are no people left in the pool, just red water and the black and white world that surrounds it. i hear mumbeling and i wake up. im tired of not really resting at night. im terrified of the future i think america is digging itself down to."

AAAHHHHHH i found that so wonderfully cute. cute, i remember being afraid of using that word in front of guys, in front of the guys is where i kept my real mouth shut. im so ashamed of who i was, what ive let happen to me, how weakly willed i can still be. im afraid that if i come off too smart then someone will try to pick on me, and i know i can kick their ass i have a fucking green belt bitch, but its a psycological thing, once someone has taken the power seat, there is only one left, the victim. plus i cant use the techniques ive learned, its as though ive thrown them out of my memory, but i have a natural block reaction faster than you would think, im pretty calm looking until i can see the threat really coming in, not just trying to make me flinch. veronica is the one trying to make me flinch...*flinch of attraction*"

"event","i guess its over now. wow, i have so many emotions about this thing that i dont know what im feeling. anger, sadness, frustration. i think overall, fear. im afraid of the future, im afraid of such a huge change, do i really need someone to be in my life just so i can say ""its love""?  ive told myself before that i would end it, but that was for a different reason, if she ended it then i just follow along. now, i just need to look at things from an outsider's point of view, however impossible that may be, im on the inside, their is almost no other view, sometimes you have that choice, to stand back and not look at everything personal, but this has not been one of those times. i dont know if she will accept me for a friend, she seems to use me for one thing only, everytime its that one thing that pushes her to call me, to see me, its everything to her, and it was everything to me. i hope i can stay in this state of mind for as long as it takes for her to realize that things arent the same anymore. i feel nothing, nothing different at least, maybe feeling nothing IS different for me. since this started ive never had a stable mind about it. maybe now ill find peace between me and myself, i would like that, a more controlled mind, equal and safe. im so used to saying i miss something, so used to thinking that something isnt there that once was, i dont feel it now. nothing is missing, im still myself, what me and her had was nothing at all, something to me now, but in time i will learn that this was necessary for my growth. i guess ill just have to wink at the girls i like now and hope they get inspired to speak to me. im not a shy person, not usually, but that first step is a very difficult step to take, everyone knows it, you know what im talking about, actually going up to the person, saying hello and all that nonsense. what happened to dinner parties where you see the most gorgeous thing youve ever witnessed and you get introduced to them? what happened to midnight strolles and you just so happen to be tackled by your soulmate's dog and meet and fall in love? what happened to me keeping a straight mind knowing that these things will come, but its not my time yet? i know that im too young, i know it, im not even prepared for it yet. i still have a few more girls to bang, a few more hearts to break and a few more heartbreakes of my own until i understand and know what i want. this post has almost no meaning to me, just an echo of thought, like most. maybe sometimes i like the new idea of being smart, and maybe i want to feel it so bad that i strive to be smart, when i know that intelligence does not come from people trying, its natural. i for one do not find myself intelligent at all, i dont catch on to things, i need time to know what i want to say, and what i want to do. im not witty, im sarcastic. sarcasm is easy, wit is natural. i dont miss her, im not confused about how i feel right now. im afraid of tomorrow."

"event","i dont want to lose whatever it is i have, or i want back whatever it is thats missing. i cant remember the last time my mind lost control like this, its like everything is an hallucination. i want to continue with things that i know will end with a whole shitload of me wanting it back again. i always do this, i get this great feeling and fuck it up with my questioning its existence, why i deserve it. maybe i get these feelings just to be punished, whatever it is that gives me these feelings knows i will always fuck it up. ive lost control of my sleeping habits again, i cant sleep most of the time and when i do i have horrible nightmares that seem to have no meaning whatsoever. that doesnt make sense though does it? in order to have a nightmare i have to be afraid of something first, but these feelings are new to me, the ones i get in the nightmares. my doctor said if this progresses i will have to start taking sleeping pills again, i hated that, i get terrifies like something outside my window wants me to fall asleep, or almost doze off just so it can make a little noise that i barely hear and i freeze up and dont allow myself to sleep at all. i cant help it, im afraid of the dark i dont like the idea that someone can see me but i cant see them (my eyes dont adjust to the dark well). whenever i walk through my living room for some water i cant see the couch and im terrified that someone is sitting there, looking at me, watching me stare where the couch should be, like that helps at all. i want this thing i have for heather to end, because odds are it will never work. and every time i try to date someone else, i just dont get that feeling that i get from her. i realized i hate the idea of not knowing how i will die, that why wherever i go i think *i could die right now, someone could shoot me right now* however ridiculous the idea may be. i dont want my death to surprise me. i want to be prepared and expect it, but odds are (since i want to expect it) it WILL be a surprise and catch me off guard. im very superstitious. i dont know why i always tell myself im not sure if i believe in a god when i KNOW its completely impossible for god not to exist, not a doubt in my mind he exists, but i tell myself still that there might not be one. HOW CAN THIS ALL BE HERE?! i do not understand the possibility of my existance if there wasnt something before all of it to make it! and what made that!? i want answers. i want to know the secrets of the universe. is my consciousness the single thing that makes everything else seem real? am i just a brain in a vat with little electrodes connected to it sensoring the parts of the brain telling me what im feelings seeing doing and thinking? why does this game have to be so real? if god does exist, and this is all real, why did he create us? out of boredome? perhaps lonelyness? i dont really even care about the ""why""s i want to know the ""how""s, how did he exist in the first place? i miss those times when i didnt care. those times were childhood. i want to get my ass kicked everyday again just so that i dont have to put up with this consant curiosity. i want to be asking why such ""bad people"" can be so horrible and not care about what they are doing. i dont want this."

Pr0t0man 27: or barin to look at her
Tom2471803: second of all if you are gunna try and sound all badass and try to threaten me, that wont work, as you can see computers dont hit people if you want them to.
Pr0t0man 27: personally im not tryin to sound bad ass if u try go ahead have fun
Tom2471803: why do you care at all?
Pr0t0man 27: like i said cuz i think ur a dumb fuck
Tom2471803: that has nothing to do with my opinion on a very kind girl, nor does it affect me in any way that you try to offend me by calling me a ""dumb fuck"" when you obviously lack intellect and courage for not even telling me who you are
Pr0t0man 27: i lack courage?
Pr0t0man 27: how can u lack courage online
Pr0t0man 27: and itellect...srry to take a crack at u but a.d.d. i would say has to affect  at urs
Pr0t0man 27: just a personal thought but w/e
Tom2471803: it doesnt matter where it is, you come off all offensive-like and avoid getting a beating or whatever it is im supposed to do about you by not telling me your name
Pr0t0man 27: my names chad
Pr0t0man 27: happy?
Tom2471803: a.d.d. has no affect on my intellect whatsoever, it affects my focus, but i have taken my medicin this morning and it is still in effect
Tom2471803: dude i dont care about your name or you at all
Pr0t0man 27: u still seem quite slow...or atleast slow at typin
Tom2471803: people are talking to me
Tom2471803: they get pissed when i ignore them
Pr0t0man 27: well whoever ur talking to...im assuming there ur friend have issuses
Tom2471803: anyway i could care less what you have to say to me and i dont understand your reasoning for trying to offend me or to start some conversation/fight
Pr0t0man 27: all i wanted to know is why would u think shes is hot?
Tom2471803: why does that matter at all? fuck off dude go kill yourself or something
Pr0t0man 27: kill myself...yea...sure........ im on it...
Tom2471803: thanks a bunch
Pr0t0man 27: damn u sure get offensive quickly
Tom2471803: well when someone comes out of nowhere without a name or anything and asks why i think my girlfriend is attractive i get a little annoyed sure
Tom2471803: who the fuck wouldnt
Pr0t0man 27: ur a sad sad sole goin out with her
Pr0t0man 27: i wouldnt
Tom2471803: sole is what is on the bottom of your shoe, and i dont give a fuck what you would do, and i like her for more than just her looks, im not scrambeling to get some head and run off
Pr0t0man 27: w/e dude u got issues but w/e
Tom2471803: yeah ive got the issues, im the one who im'ed someone about their girlfriend because i dont find her attractive. well thought out, do me a favor and start taking the retard classes
Pr0t0man 27: damn dude u get irritated very quickly do u have no patience?
Tom2471803: patience for what?
Tom2471803: am i waiting for something
Tom2471803: ?
Pr0t0man 27: no u just seem to get angry at very small things
Tom2471803: not really, i think its a pretty big thing for you to have im'ed me as though you think you know me OR rachel, its as though you care or something
Pr0t0man 27: well seeing as she said she was uglier then like the ugliest girl i know i felt bad for the person  who said he loved her and i wanted to know why he said it
Tom2471803: i never said i loved her
Tom2471803: not once
Pr0t0man 27: its in her info
Tom2471803: not even almost, its not quite there yet
Tom2471803: i havent seen that, and i never said it
Pr0t0man 27: it said ur screen name but w/e
Tom2471803: anyway, seeing as you are retarded and everytime you think you have something enteresting and smart to say i just care less and less and less, just stop answering back to everything i say and go do something worth-while, like taking the ""special people"" classes from now on
Tom2471803: ever heard of copy and paste? moron
Pr0t0man 27: yes i have
Tom2471803: if you dont want me to completely obliviate you in this conversation anymore than just ""x"" out of the convo.
Pr0t0man 27: obliviate me?
Pr0t0man 27: u sound like uve played way to many games 
Pr0t0man 27: and if thats the case ur probably a zit faced nerd without a life and u took ur first chance at a girl u got
Tom2471803: obliviate is a word, if you dont know what it means look it up, its called a vocabulary, i say ""big words"" (as you would call them) like obliviate and you say ""stupid person"" words (as i call them) like dumbfuck which isnt one word
Pr0t0man 27: i know wut it means im just surprised to see someone use that trying to offend someone
Tom2471803: lol did you just call me a ""zit faced nerd without a life""? how sad, you have to start calling me more names
Pr0t0man 27: i didnt call u that i implied that u most likely ae
Pr0t0man 27: calling u something would be saying...
Pr0t0man 27: stfu shitface
Tom2471803: lol because THATS a real comback
Tom2471803: well done
Pr0t0man 27: .................
Pr0t0man 27: that was surprising 
Tom2471803: dont pretend like im the bad guy here doing all the name calling and hurting everyones feelings, you im'ed me
Tom2471803: why are you surprised
Pr0t0man 27: im surprised ur congratulating me
Pr0t0man 27: thats 1 thing that actually shut me up
Pr0t0man 27: i normally have a smart ass remark to everything
Pr0t0man 27: but that didnt trigger 1
Tom2471803: oh ok, yeah, because of course when im on the computer im incapable of using sarcasm, thats right.
Tom2471803: none of your remarks have been smart, they just came out of your ass
Pr0t0man 27: ur not very intelligent because if they came outta my ass theyd be sitting in a toilet somewhere
Pr0t0man 27: and technically they came out of my fingers
Pr0t0man 27: and there better remarks then ive seen from u in this whole conversation
Tom2471803: wow...just wow. you think that was funny or smart or something dont you?
Pr0t0man 27: the best thing u had was got to the special classes  and u had to resort to it more then once
Pr0t0man 27: no i think its logic or common sense which ever
Pr0t0man 27: neither of which u have
Tom2471803: right, because you know me and all that stuff, and all this time all ive done is just insult your girlfriend and you...thats right, you are a genious
Pr0t0man 27: and all that stuff?? what stuff
Pr0t0man 27: and when did i say i was a genious
Tom2471803: you know me and know how far my intellect can go and you know me personally and all you have ever seen is me having no logic or common sense.
Tom2471803: you didnt say you were a genius, i used sarcasm again, im sorry i forgot you dont know what sarcasm is
Tom2471803: im really glad you didnt say you were a genius, that would just look rediculous
Tom2471803: are you done now?
Tom2471803: has your reign of stupidity ended

motorcycle, long rolling roads, the rider is big, the sun beats down so hard. he smells of the apocolypse. i dont know where i am in here, possibly not at all, the fly watching from afar. he destroy everything in his path, im afraid of him. he rides through hundreds of people, barely any room for him and his bike to get through but he speeds on, not slowing down in fear of hitting one of them. they reach out to him as though he holds the key to their happiness, their hands grasp his jacket for a second and their palms are melted to the bone in the blink of an eye. there is a tunnel, people still surround him but they dont reach for happiness, they seem to have learned their lesson earlier, before they reached the tunnel, their hands all sizzled. the people just trudge along as he rides by them. they hate him as much as i fear him. they believe he does not deserve to...i dont know what they thought of him he just doesnt deserve it whatever it is. they think they are worthy though. they think they are all so beautiful and perfect, trudging along in their filth, with nothing but hate on their lips, bone and melted skin in both hands. i know better, it is they who deserve nothing but what they have, perhaps less. but i do not know what i am in all of this. perhaps the man on the bike, maybe one of the zombie-like creatures who have done nothing but cry to themselves because they dont know how to find happiness. the tunnel ends, it is the dead of night and stars shine far away on the canvas that is the sky, the people are older here, near the water, maybe sea maybe ocean. the people are not any wiser though, only more hateful, they are so close, waiting so long to see the beach, to touch the cool liquid between their rough scarred toes, and ""he"" gets to wizz by without anything there to slow him. i am not the fly, ever watching, but a hawk. rope is tied around my neck and it is connected to the bike. the people stare at me with the strongest hate i have ever seen, i despise them just as much right back. they dont know what its like to be pulled around forever, slave to the skies. im so ignorant, they have been slave to this line and just to be punished for trying to be happy. i hate myself now, as the rider goes directly into the water and i am pulled down with him. i see a familiar face when i try to get free of the rope before i am pulled into the water that may end my existence. the familiar face smiles at me as it begins to walk into the water, finally free to swim out and finally become wise. the dream ends there, the panic still in my lungs and heart seconds before im pulled under."

"event","a lot has been on my mind this morning and i kept wanting to update before i lose it and i cant put it in the words that would satisfy the perfectionist inside of me. ive lost one alrady. i almost tried to describe it but its gone. i still have one though. i felt extremely sexy this morning, not like ""ooh i just gotta touch it!"" thing but just woke up, put my head under the faucet and wet my hair, and after i dried my hair i just looked in the mirror and there was a thing, i dont know what to call it, mostly because ive lost that train of thought, but i just looked in the mirror and was proud for how ive ended up considering my past, not even that really, i was just proud. i could care less about my past now, its just that, he past. it happened and all i can do is avoid the mistakes i made and strive for the achievements (spelling). maybe girls WERE looking at me with that gleam, ""checking me out"". appearance should never be important, but thats all i have time for out here. when i get to thinking about things i, as always, come across thoughts of abandonment, or extreme pain mental and physical, anger and frustration and sadness and grief and embarassment(KILL ME!) and hate!!! oh god do i hate! usually when i come here with long hair my dad has me get it cut, he buys me ""respectable"" clothes and just tries to chisle me into a replica of him. i already look like him i dont want anything else! but this time he didnt, my hair is shaggy (scooby you stupid little fuck!!) and my clothes...well since last summer my wardrobe has changed i no longer wear all black trying to make friends in a certain group. i think he finally realizes that he has missed things and fucked up everything else so much that he cant tell me what to look like. i could have put it in so much better words this morning. argh i was so excited to make a new entry but now this is just shit. i want my thoughts back, i want to be angry with him i want to hate the people who had me scared to go to school every morning. I WANT TO KILL! (momentary pause...ok continue) if the word ""sex"" didnt exist and there were no other words for it like fuck or intercourse and we didnt make a new word for it...would we still do it?"

"event","people are attracted to me but thats before i go after them. i went to astroworld (six flags) today, there were girls everywhere. i looked and tried to catch eyes like everybody does when they go to a theme park full of ""hotties"", well guys at least, and you cant really tell when someone finds you attractive, that may be a good thing. there was a girl with pitch black eyes (as far as i could tell)(im sure they are a little brown but oh were they deep) i found answers in them, i stared into her eyes and she stared right back. she had a few friends around her, mostly guys but she stared outwards, like she wanted to escape, come sit next to me on the ride and get away from them for a moment. and we stared and it was as thought we had a conversation there in that line, we looked at the line and gave each other loathing looks, i knew she meant the line not me. she thought my shirt was funny, i thought her hair was funny (tease my friends tease) she laughed but she still had a look in her eyes as though she wanted to escape. (we may have pulled a lot of this off with hand motions but our eyes were LOCKED) those eyes, if only i knew someone with those eyes. we had something special going on. i looked down and went on the ride keeping my eyes on the track. heather haunts me. there was another girl, this is not the same subject nor does she hold any certain importance to the day, she was in a line with my dad, my dad pointed me out, she said i was cute asked my age so on so forth, and then we came home. the whole day i did that searching for a look that someone gave me that told me i might be remotly attractive, not to people who know me personally but to people who just see me somewhere. i wonder if i am someone who is remembered hours later, remembered not because i did something special, not because i helped them or made contact with them in any way but just because i existed in their life for that split second. it shouldnt matter, it shouldnt make any difference in my life whether i am or not, but i want to be...i dont know what i want to be, acknowledged, looked at like girls looked at my attackers when i was little and defenseless. why is it that the people who make all of the mistakes you can make get to be seen as respectable? badasses? stoners? thugs? why are they seen as a pro, and people like me get seen as a con, a reject in this world that has no use but to be beaten up and then become extremely rich and sad and so depressed and furious because i could never do anything for myself? i want to put a bullet between the eyes of every pandy that wouldnt fuck to save its own species. i cant finish my original thought, perhaps later, i changed subjects and it has morphed into something that i cant climb back up from. i want to destroy something beautiful."

"event","i dont know what to do...""great conversationallist"" is not something you base a relationship on. with rachel things are odd, i took something special and tried to turn it into a relationship as always. and with heather, i know i should not continue because anastasia is correct...she's not the brightest bulb. that could be compared to many things. i always go for the girls i can make friends out of but shouldnt base happiness on. everytime i take a long hot bath here i picture heather with me...not a sexy thing, just a thing. possibly something i want that i could never truely have. i grow tired of having to think about this. not because it confuses me naturally but anastasia puts these brain twisters on me. i always go for the girl i shouldnt. maybe thats something i get from my dad. maybe i learned it. not sure really, i could care less about the ""why's"" and the ""how's"" but the ""when's"" and the ""what's"" are very important to me. i miss having a face to put on the person i imagine falling asleep in my arms at night. i miss having a name to call them by."

"event","logging into conscience...connection broken, call testicles for questions and help. good morning and welcome to me. its a grand morning, ive been talking to rachel most of this morning (party) she is very interesting, a lot of the girls i know dont watch REAL movies, they watch stuff like vin diesel or however the fuck you spel that, i have nothing against the man, he just cant act. anyway i was listing movies SHE needs to see, then all of the sudden she has the guts to tell me about HER movies and how much i should see THEM! thats not a bad thing its a very good thing. i believe im over heather, and no matter how much i could be wrong about the situation between us i would like to think that she didnt like me. i did come off as creepy for awhile there, i know i was crazy about her and whether the feeling was remotly mutual, shes missing out. this is not to offend or provoke her, actually i was supposed to go to the beach with her a few days ago but she pulled out, im not sayin she did it because she was nervous, those weather reports are quite wrong a lot (she said it might rain so she decided to go to the mall) it didnt rain all day. not important, my stepdad got pissed because i kept him at his shop instead of him going to the wendy's house (place we are working at) so he could be close when time came to pick me up. i even had an operation tactic, i would pretend not to like her, just enjoy the beach and stuff, return all of her conversation attempts with one sentence answers, anna would call and i would pretend to flirt with anna on the phone. this is a plan courtesy of anastasia herself, she is always there when i need her, and always ready to debate my love life, i owe a lot of ""props"" to anna for keeping me sane this summer. i did have a bad that-day though, robert came home for lunch very mad, yelled at me ordered me around a bit, when he left...i yelled. i yelled and screamed and got so frustrated at the fact the only father figures i have is robert, who has a horrible temper and im scared of him sometimes, and ""that guy"" in texas, he has fucked up my view of relationships and life and how things work and then left me and my sisters and mom to ourselves in our sadness and agony. i would rather have robert as a father. i wish i was part of his offspring, hes tough on me but it gets me together, my father has made me a reck. i leave on thursday for texas, i dont want to go. ill put a smile on and tell him i love him when he takes me on his arrands. im his favorite. all hes ever wanted was a boy. i see through the new him and what i DO see i dont want to. im having a decent day but im starting to pack. that makes this upcoming day all the more real. i had a great long talk on the phone with rachel last night and i had a wierd dream when i fell asleep but i cant remember it. i want to touch the moon but the sun will get jealous."

"event","you should let life flow a little more, you are better at it than a lot of people (mainly the friends who leave messages on you and christen's entries) they seem too connected, connection isnt such a bad thing, but that's where feelings of absolute loneliness comes from. the sad thing is that your wrong, horribly terribly wrong, oh if only it were true you were alone. that would make the world a beautiful and emotion-free world, that would be your gift to the world, only you would have this terrible feeling as though you are the only one to understand these things, to know what a break up means. i think you should stop worrying about guys, they get over stuff...quick. i realized awhile ago that women and men dont work too differently, after being dumped we rely on our friends, and guys...well their friends are guys, and guys, they are crazy motherfuckers. so we are sidetracked a lot longer than girls are. dont feel sorry for guys you dump unless you mean you feel sorry for the fact they will keep on liking you simply for the reason that you dont like tham back.that was the whole point of ""operation: heather"" to pretend i wasnt so drastically in love with her so she would want me in a lustingly way at least...but everyone wants my body so really the lust is already there. ""check out that ass"" says the buff gay guy. ""thanks"" says i.

Xo lehcar oX: i liked winnie the poo
Xo lehcar oX: but the old ones
Xo lehcar oX: not the gay ones there are now
Tom2471803: if a kangaroo's child was named roo, logic tells us that kanga was probably the mother's name (or father's)
Xo lehcar oX: not necessairily
Xo lehcar oX: they could have just liked the name roo
Tom2471803: most likely
Tom2471803: i said logic tells us not knowlege tells us
Xo lehcar oX: so if logic tells us this..whats the joey of roo's going to be named?

Tom2471803: never
Xo lehcar oX: thats a very sexist thing to say
Tom2471803: i know
Xo lehcar oX: logic could quite possibly be a woman
Tom2471803: most likely actually
Xo lehcar oX: women being more logical than men..
Tom2471803: probably named either anastasia or rachel
Tom2471803: but if logic lies
Xo lehcar oX: well glory be the funks on me
Xo lehcar oX: i crack up whenever i hear that
Tom2471803: then then my outlooks on you and anna would be eternally screwed

"event","my friend rachel (met this one at a party) rocks. this is my current thought...and i move on. break it down? who the fuck thought that up? relax. everything is going to be fine. is death all that bad? so what if we dont find love? my friends still love me, life long partner or not. i hate sounding like this love wrought kid, its not that big of a deal, i think about it because i want it i want to be with her, but does that make it love? most possibly not. hmm. rationality isnt as fun as hypnosis. like me and my father's previous relationship, i am awake, my eyes are ""wide open"". im fine, i see things, i still feel those feelings but dont use the same words. if this heather thing doesnt work out ill live, i know my feelings may even be gone now, im not sure all this realistic thinking is kind of confusing my emotions. but im not to the point of depression. golly this is a good feeling. almost complete, i would hate being complete, there is no more hardships after perfection and hardships is what drives me to live. this has been an alright entry. maybe i can think of something better to write later. suspend."

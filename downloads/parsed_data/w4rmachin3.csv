"event","So, I was complaining to Ang that i didn't like that christmas had turned into such a guilt-ridden season. How? Well, gift-giving and shit.. and not having money to do so, as well as telling my parents not to get me stuff, but knowing they will anyway. I do like getting stuff, just like everyone else, but not when i know the person giving them could better use the money another way, like, oh.. for instance, helping my sister pay for her mouth surgery and braces, paying off bills, buying themselves stuff..

When I was young, getting things was a big deal. now I'd rather see my parents have money for themselves, and them taking it away and fiving me stuff instead made me feel guilty.

I told this to Ang and she replied: ""i'm sure once you have kids you'll wanna buy them shit...don't worry about it...the way i look at it i know my mom doesnt buy me stuff cause she feels obligated to, she wants to.""

I realized that it's selfish of me not to accept gifts, because, just like i want my parents to keep their money, they want to give me things, so they i will then have these things as a token of their appreciation and love.

I don't know if that makes any sense because I'm kinda really tired, but whatever..

I'm not used to getting advice, and not just immediately dismissing it; this is throwing me though a loop. I'm really not sure what to think :P

Ah well, sleep."

Music group aims to charge Internet users 

David Akin, CTV Business and Technology Correspondent

A group representing Canada's songwriters will ask the Supreme Court of Canada to force Internet service providers to pay them royalties for the millions of digital music files downloaded each year by Canadians.

The case has broad ramifications for the Internet industry in Canada, legal experts say.

""This is the big case for the Internet. This will set the position on how we are going to treat Internet service providers, whether they are going to be seen as people who are responsible in some way for content that goes through their services,"" said Mark Perry, a professor of law and a professor of computer science at the University of Western Ontario in London, Ont.

If successful, the legal pleadings of the Society of Composers, Authors, and Music Publishers of Canada (SOCAN) could open the door to other rights holders -- groups as diverse as software publishers or Hollywood movie distributors -- who could use SOCAN's precedent to force Internet service providers (ISPs) to collect royalties for their members.

.......

I repeat, FUCKING SOCAN"

"event","A bus carrying a bunch of ugly people crashes into an oncoming truck, and everyone inside dies. They then get to meet their maker, and because of the grief they have experienced he decides to grant them one wish each before they enter Paradise. They're all lined up, and God asks the first one what the wish is.  

""I want to be gorgeous,"" and so God snaps His fingers, and it is done. The second one in line hears this and says ""I want to be gorgeous too."" Another snap of His fingers and the wish is granted. 

This goes on for a while but when God is halfway down, the last guy in the line starts laughing. When there are only ten people left, this guy is rolling on the floor, laughing his arse off. 

Finally, God reaches this guy and asks him what his wish will be. The guy eventually calms down and says: ""Make 'em all ugly again"".

Tomorrow is going to be soooo long. Wake up at 6:30, turn on dryer, go back to bed(?), work 8am-5pm, then possibly go to the mall with ang (depening on how she's feeling :P), then radio show at 10pm-12am, sleep for a few hours, work at 5am-1pm then sleep for a VERY LONG TIME.

I didn't do my SOCAN stuff for last saturday because I'm a retard, so now I have to get the logs and do them at home and return them monday.

I saw matrix revolutions yesterday. The movie itself left me feeling very indifferent and a bit disppointed, but the fighting as cool. What was really interesting was meeting Dan's coworker, Diana (or Diane, i forget), who also went to see the movie. She's 17, has a tiny build for her height, and is a goth, but give her a couple years and get rid of the spikey neck thing, and she'd be really cute. 

I bought laundry soap after the movie.

I worked today. If i didn't need the money so bad I'd have quit about 3 hours into my shift. Fucking lame people at work... luckly the people I DO like at work make up for it. <3 Emily.

Bleh, I wanted to write more but I can't think of it. I should sleep now. 

P.S. I'm spinning live this week on my radio show. Tune in, even if it is only to laugh at my lameness. :)"

"event","""Do you suffer from long-term memory loss? I don't remember...""

After thinking, things aren't so horrible. I always tell people ""it's never that bad,"" but I don't always think that myself.

I'm back in Fredericton. It's nice to be home, but I also wish that I was back with my friends. I wish I had more (any?) friends in Freddy that just liked to hang out with me, I hate having to travel to do that. ;/

I spent Thursday morning to Tuesday morning at Adam and Rachel's apartment chilling. I had a pretty good time, and could write all sorts about it if i could only remember. There are a few nights I don't remember getting into bed at all, kinda makes me wonder what I did before i got into bed. Damned blacking out. Stupid non-existant memory. Here are some thigns that I DO remember:

- Losing my 'special' tin with its 'special' contents.
- It being found somewhere it shouldn't have been in the first place. ""Oh look, mints!""
- Losing rachel's keys.
- Remembering I attached them to a hanging lamp, only after spending too much time tearing the place apart looking for them
- Death by Chocolate: brownies, Chocolate pudding, Whipped cream, crushed up peanut butter cups. Oh man, that was good.
- Stealing cigarettes :)
- Playing too much X-Box Halo.
- Sleeeeeeeeeeeep.
- Barfing because of Wendy's. Tasted good on the way down..
- So relaxed. Weee.
(I'll add more to this post as I think of them)

I have to email Mandy, CHSR's Program Director, about some stupid SOCAN stuff today, I'd hate to end up screwing her over because I couldn't do my show on Saturday. I'm really not sure how I'm going to work it, the prerecorded show they played for me only had like 5% CANCON :X Ah well...

I had this wacked-out dream last night that I was living in Vanier(?) and Ang was trying to steal my weed(?!?!?!). I also filled some dude's K-Car with water and had the CPs after me because of it. There was other stuff going on, but I don't remember what it was. Unfortunately Rachel woke me up so that I could get ready to go home mid-dream; I really wish I had known what else was going to happen.

Moving.. what to do, what to do. If I move I'm obviously not going back to school this year.. unless I were to attend another school, but I doubt I could transfer with my current achedemic standing. Bleh, anyway, right now I've narrowed the palces I'd like to move down to a three different places. 

First off, Saint John; good money there, friends, more people, moer stuff to do... but it's also such a large city in that it's laid out over such a large area, and bleh. 

Second there's Toronto or Halifax, these are grouped together because they're equally a stupid move; they're both big cities and there's a Hardcore scene in both places, but I don't know anyone there and is music really a reason to move somewhere? Granted t-dot does have several people I know from ONLINE living there, but I don't think they count. 

Finally I have the UK. I have a friend who may let me stay at his place whilst I look for an apartment and job there, then I could try to get on my feet. This move is stupid in that I don't know what to expect, but I'd love to immurse myself in the English culture, I could make so many friends AND enjoy the huge hardcore scene there, but it's so far away from home.

No matter where I move, one thing will be universal, I'll miss what friends i have here in fredericton. Boo, it's all so messy, why can't I just have someone tell me what to do and how to do it like grade school. ;/

For lack of more stuff to write about, here's a survey Ang sent me about her, I'll put my answers here :P
<lj-cut text=""click for survey"">
1. What's on your bedside table? Well, my bedside table is pretty much my desk, so on my desk ate two turntables, a mixer, a monitor, a pc, two bottles of beer, several cups, couple hundred cds , a scanner, a lamp and a screw driver.
2. What do you eat when you raid the fridge at night? Uh, yeah.. I don't keep very much food in my fridge.. if I want something at midnight I walk to Irving or Sobeys.
3. What is your secret guaranteed weeping movie?  Robocop 3
4. If you could have plastic surgery, what would you have done? Your Mom.

8. Do you have too many love interests? your mom. 
9. Do you know anyone famous? Other than myself? Well, I know people who are popular in select groups, but that's it.
10. Describe your bed: Unmade, filled with clothes and other junk, sheets need to be washed. Two pillows. too small, I need my Queen-Sized when I change rooms.
11. Spontaneous or planned? I used to be a very planned stuff kinda person, but plans usually fall apart, so now I'm trying to be spontaneous.

18. How much money would it take to get you to give up the Internet for a year? A year? well as long as you give me time to get everyone's phone number from the people I talk to exclusively online, then I could probably do it, but for no less than it would cost for my long-distance fees. :)

21. Have you ever been in a school play? Yep, sure was. I was Willey the Whale, Chris Farley, and soemthing else in Theatre Arts.

I've had a bit to drink, and still have a ton more left to go. Gill will be here in about an hour, everything worked out for the most part, minus one key bit. :P

I went to the mall today and had taco bell for the first time ever. Tacos are good.

Uhm, I really don't knwo what else to say. More later?"

Dream log. It's kinda geeky:
<blockquote>
I'm moving back into residence. The rooms are huge and everyone's really cool. I'm the first on there so i set up my stuff then I meet my new roommate, a pudgey frosh. He seems cool enough.

Time passes, I find myself at the SUB, in a computer lab or something, I'm not sure. There i meet Brian, one of my friends from residence years ago and someone I still talk to occasionally. 

More time passes. I arrive back at my room in residence and find two girls sitting at my computer. They're both about 5'6"" one's blonde (I later find out her name is Tracy [no relation to the tracy i know in real life]), and the other's a red head (I don't remember her name). We chill, I find out they've played a practical joke and taken admin privledges on my pc. Not a big deal, but this sparks a prank-war. Brian walks in, it turns out he knows these girls. That's cool.

Back at the SUB, in the computer lab, it's dark. The girls are taunting me about having control of my pc and I'm planning my revenge.. 

More time passes, We're all chilling in my place, Tracy is with Brian and the red-headed chick is with me, and we're just lounging, watchin tv and playing video games, chillin, making joked at each others expense and just having some fun. It was so relaxing. I try my hand at the game that the girls have been playing for a while now, I suck. Oh well.
</blockquote>
And that's when I decided it's time to stop dreaming. I have no idea what this means, but I was talking to one of my friends from work about cliques and how Fredericton is very ""cliquey."" These were a great group of people I was with, and I was in the most awesome place (""my"" room in residence rocked). Maybe my subconcious is telling me i need a close-nit group of friends to just chill with, but this I already know.

Either way, I woke up refreshed and I'm still in a good mood, even though it's rainting outside.

I'm going to Saint John today. Rachel wants me to go this morning, like 40 minutes from now, but I have a few reasons why I'm waiting for the late bus. ""COME NOW,"" to quote rachel. She started to sound like victoria, not that it's a bad thing, makes me feel wanted :P

DJing is going well, Radio show is going well too; I just need more money for records!

Anyway, I've got to try to get ahold of Mike, though I think he's in class."

Rachel tells me she and Trish were talking about me. It seems had Trish not found Jordo (because I was always working), she'd have been ""all over me"" because I'm ""such a nice guy."" Har har har, heard that one before. Jord's a cool guy though, so whatever :P

I went over to Vanier House to try to fix Ang's computer... boy ias it busted. I was told it was sitting in garage for a month. then drove back here from Toronto. I expect it's a dead power supply, but i couldn't really poke around because it was one of those HP Pavilions that's all crampt up. I got more of <a href=""http://www.remembersean.com"">Sean's<a/> CDs from Ang, and gave her the <a href=""http://www.giantmicrobes.com/health/commoncold.html"">cold virus</a> I boughts for her.

Radio show #4 tonight.. I should probably get some music to play :P <a href=""http://131.202.131.112:8000/listen.pls"">You can listen here</a> if the stream is up during the show, it always seems to go out.

<a href=""http://www.cdslash.net"">Dan</a> is living here now, in the other room... he has a gamecube, it allows me to waste more time.

I have the day off so i'm going to go do stuff."

Then the end of the show came, and I had no Idea how to sign off... I knew since I was the last show I had to play the CRTC signoff thing, then turn off all the equipment and crap, but I wasn't sure what to do about the dead air issue. After trying Mandy twice, I ended up calling Tristis, our Station Manager, at 11:45 asking what to do. She told me how to turn off the transmitter and such, and said it was ok I called, thought she seemed a bit annoyed.. Hell, I would have been. 

I know at least one person was listening, I had a dude call in asking for some Hard House and Hard Trance.. unfortunately I neither had his records or was playing live, so I really couldn't help him out.. I hope to do a bit of hard house and hard trance stuff next show.

Man, I am *tired* I have to work in 5.5 hours too :/

Ah well, it's all in good fun."

I got up at 10:30am today. Played Halflife.. almost have it beat. Then I went to get my hair cut:<br><img src=""http://www.djwarmachine.com/hahaha.jpg"">

After that I got some Chinese, and went to see American Wedding... funny, but probably would have been hilarious if I'd gone with someone, or there had at least been a crowd.. Stiffler's acting and shit got annoying.. though that may have been the point.

I'll do it all up tomorrow after work. I have one hour covered by justrich's blizzard radio set, and I expect to play a few of my friends' new tracks. I may also play another set of my choosing, then spin a few tracks myself near the end, I dunno. I'm not spinning myself for the first show (and possibly for the first few shows) for obvious reasons. 

I searched for ""boogers"" at chapters today and got <i><a href=""http://www.chapters.indigo.ca/item.asp?N=35&R=920431&act=A03&Item=978043937612&Section=books&Catalog=Books&Lang=en&mscssid=C89E5Q1VEDPL8JLK9XL17A4F95TQ6VH4&WSID=2108A382CB88F34D4C76A6761D8E399943874715"">Captain Underpants and the Big Bad Battle of the Bionic Booger Boy Part 2: The Revenge of Ridiculous Robo-Boogers</a></i> Fucking awesome!

I sent the rest of my day looking though a <a href=""http://2600.com"">2600: Hacker's Quaterly</a> at Chapters, and some other junk. I'm subscribing to 2600 tomorrow night sometime.. it's pretty interesting, and I hate reading stuff off the computer screen, I love hardcopy.. I can take it into the bathroom with me :P

Yeah.. I have to be at work in 6 hours. Wee.

My schedule for tomorrow is Work 5-1, drink ltos of coffee during those hours, be home by 2, sleep until 6 or 7, get ready for the show, drink lots of vanilla coke to keep me awake, leave for chsr at 9:15 via cab, show at 10, be home by 1am, sleep until 6am, work 7-3 on sunday. Fuck!

There was other stuff I wanted to write, but I can't think of it.. Anything else i happen to remember later will be written below:

- I got some more records in the mail today from.. Metrognome I do believe.
- I need to pee
- My hair dresser  was cute, and wanted to put blond highlights in my hair, but I wasn't up for it today. I guess she also use to work at the Superstore for a while.
- I can't wait for school to back in. GIRLS GIRLS GIRLS.
- I found out DreamWeaver rocks all ass.
- Fuck."

"event","So... hmm. Where to begin...

I love my equipment. It's fucking awesome... and I think I'm catching on pretty quickly. Scratching is still a mystery to me, as is how to beatmatch breakbeat tracks, but that'll all come in time.. I hope :P

I guess I mentioned that I went to CHSR in my last long-ass post. Since then I've completed 5-ish hours of training, completed (and rocked all ass) my mock-broadcast with the Production Manager listening in, and submitted a program application for Saturday nights, 10pm-midnight. I guess they're going to market saturday nigths as dance music or something.. I'm not really sure. I dunno if I like that timeslot.. it kind of restricts me if I want to go out that night, but whatever I suppose. 

In case you're wondering, I'll be playing Hard Dance stuff on my show... Hardcore, Garage, Hard Trance, and Hard House.. but mostly hardcore  :)

I'll make these fuckers give Hardcore a chance dammit. Once they realize it's not all cheesy vocals and fast pianos of the early 90s, they might give it a chance :P

Anyway, what else..

I also plan to host a web broadcast once a week, but that's a while down the road.. like when i don't suck. The gold part about chsr is that I can play other people's sets until U'm awesome enough to spin myself.. which shouldn't take long ;)

I still have my 4 technics stickers and STILL have no idea where to put any of them... you have to understand that these are very precious! I only have 4! :P

MY thirst for vinyl is growing strong, the 20 records I have now jsut aren't enough.. but hell, I'll probably be saying that even when my collection is up to three- or four-hundred.. oh well. I also need to start colelcting genres other than Hardcore.. I's like to spin two styles. I was thinking that HardHouse would be a good idea, but I can't fucking stand it. My next choice is a genre I'm just come into contact with a few months ago.. UK Speed Garage. That's some awesome shit.

Sean's mom sent me a bunch of CDs he owned, plus a video that a mutual friend filmed in high school that we both stared in.. it's cool. Sigh.

I can't think of anything else to type... I guess it's time to eat my Mac and Cheese."

"event","One of my friends pointed out that I never update my journal. I guess she's right. Much has happened since my last update. Let's see..

I should also mention that my grammy died last Sunday. I went to the funeral on Wednesday. She had Alzheimer's Disease and she was getting pretty sickly.. she had a massive heart attack. She died in the ambulance on the way to the Fredericton Hospital (a 40 minute drive), but they bought her back to life (if you can call braindead alive, 20 mins without oxygen) and kept her alive until most her kids made it to the hospital. They then decided to let her go, and turned off whatever machines were keeping her alive. What's kinda crazy is that her heart kept beating until about 5 minutes after her final child got there.. a full hour after the machine was turned off.

In happier news, after spending a good $2300CDN on DJ equipment, I should be all set up.. Here's what I got!

1 x <a href=""http://www.vestax.com/products/pcv150.htm"">Vestax PCV-150 5 channel Mixer</a>
2 x <a href=""http://www.prodjstore.com/technicssl1200m3d.asp"">Technics SL-1200 M3D</a>
2 x <a href=""http://www.needlz.com/cartridges/m44-7.asp"">Shure M44-7 Cartridge</a>
1 x <a href=""http://www.digitallyunique.net/digitally-unique/mdrv600.html"">Sony MDR-V600 Headphones</a>
1 x <a href=""http://www.odysseygear.com/cgi-bin/products/display_prod.cgi?query=KLP080YEL"">Odyssey Krom LP Case, Yellow</a>

The M3D is discontinued, but that's only ebcause the MK5 was jsut released, and the Non-G version of the MK5 is the exact same as a M3D, only with a better light bulb, :)

All I have left to get is a CDJ, I was thinking the <a href=""http://www.pioneerprodj.com/"">Pioneer CDJ-100S</a>, but I might save up for one of those badass CDJ-1000s or the Denton one.. (which actually came out first). I dunno. It's pretty pricey shit.

I have the headphones right now, the mixer, decks, carts, and LP case will be in Maine for me to pick up, and haul across the border, heh. Yes, I'm going to pay duty.. I didn't want to get my mom's car impounded, and more importantly, my gear taken away by getting caught :P Tracking this shit has been a total bitch.. I just got both of the tracking #s on my decks to work.. one of them had a O (oh) instead of a 0 (zero) in it, and that made it fuck up, and caused me to become piss me off; I was seriously worried that ebay dude was going to rip me off, even though he gave me no reason to.. I guess I'm just paranoid :P I'm having a bitch of a time with my musiciansfriend.com order, I sent a money order instead of a western union transfer (shit, was that an ordeal.. can't deliver to a PO Box my ass!), since WU wanted to charge me $80 just to send the money, where a Money order and next-day delivery cost me less than $40. Whee.

I also got a bunch of new hardcore vinyl in from IMO the other day...  I got totally raped on shipping and taxes. I paid about 30GBP shipping, THEN had to pay $37CDN taxes when Fedex showed up at my door. Thank god for personal cheques.. how the fuck do those guys not have hand-held debit machines? THEN i find out they didn't send me one of the records I ordered, no BNK011 for me :/

Anyway, I'd list what vinyl I got but I'm working on a database system to do just that... heh :P  .... What else?

I went to <a href=""http://www.unb.ca/chsr"">CHSR</a> the other day to join up, and ended up meeting <lj user=""balthcat""> there. I knew he was part of the whole CHSR deal, but fancy running into him my first time there. Anyway, I couldn't sign up that day because the Program Manager wasn't around.. so I went back the next day.. paid my $8, signed up for training, and now zipity doo.  I want to do a Hard Dance show there, but I don't know if they're going to let me since there's already a bunch of electronic music shows... It'd suck if they didn't :P

I feel that it is also necessary to point out that the production manager is hot.

In other news, I noticed <lj user=""carsieb""> was online on MSN the other day, so I messaged her a couple times, then said ""FINE, I DIDN""T WANT TO TALK TO YOU ANYWAY."" Her mom responded, I guess she logged on, and didn't know Carrie's msn was online. I chatted with her mommy for a while, she seems cool.. but she seemed worried that Carrie was going to be mad that she had talked to one of her daughters friends.. Maybe I shouldn't have mentioned this ;)

I've worked a lot. I'm used to working under 20 hours a week, but the last 3 months I've been pumping out a good 26-40 horus a week. Whew!

I'm hoping after the insane fuckign week, and being an all-around good guy, Superstore will give me a raise. I need a second job too. Well, more like I want a second job. Weeeelllll, more like I want more money,.. :P

Uh.. soooo.. Yeah. I guess that's it for right now."

I could. 

And I did.

I'm so screwed :) But I have another $1500 to cover my ass if need be.

I plan to pay off my card very soon... hopefully by the end of this month I'll have my balance below $300, and that'll make me happy :)

I was late for work today, then had the audacity to ask my boss for a raise. Yeah, I'm awesome. He said talk to him about it next week. If i don't get it, I'm going to transfer to another department. :P

It's very hot today, that makes me unhappy. I'm tired. I'm also very hungry, and want to order pizza, but i don't have any real cash on me, just credit, and i'm not going to start fucking myself over tonight :P Looks like it's chicken breast and rice for me tonight.

I drank much last night, I plan to drink again tomorrow night. What an interesting night it was. went to subway 3 times, got free subs, mmmm.. free. There was also other entertainment. 

I'm down for the Canada Day holiday. I got off work at noon Monday, was drove down Monday (last)night by Victoria's friend, then we went drinking soon afterward.

Vic drove Tim's car a fair bit, which made me a big nervous since she didn't even have her license, but I chilled out soon enough, she's actually a pretty good driver, but I'd never admit it.. unless she reads this, THEN IT'S A LIE!

I was up until like 6am, then I went to bed. I think Tim and Vic stayed up, since she had to go to classes in the morning (heh). 

It's 1pm now, Victoria's home from classes, and is at least trying to sleep, while I'm using her computer. I'm fucking bored. Blah blah. Thank God for internet radio.

I tried tequila for the first time last night. It wasn't as bad as I had expected, but in the tequila's defence, I was already pretty drunk. Apparently it wasn't that good of tequila anyway.

Victoria mixed a drink that tasted exactly like Sour Patch Kids last night. Fuck, it was so good.. I wish I knew just what she put in it.. I was watching, but being a little inebriated kept me from remembering.. oh well.

That's it for now. More updates later as events unfold. Stay tuned!

I'm not too sure what the hell any of that's supposed to mean, I imagine all I did was give my email to a bunch of spammers, but whatever..

Also, the fact that MK <lj user=""michaelallroy""> showed up on my list when I selected females only raises a few questions :P"

I took back <a href=""http://www.dlink.com/products/usb/dsbc110/"">the cam I bought yesterday</a> for $50, and bought a <a href=""http://www.logitech.com/index.cfm?page=products/details&contentid=5042&crid=4&detail=2&countryid=2&languageid=1"">rather nice one</a>.

I had ""Smoke Two Joints"" by Sublime stuck in my head all day, so I obviously had to sing it while at work. Customers gave me strange looks, bastards.

Victoria called me and asked if i wanted to go to Montreal with her tonight. I think my response sent kinda like ""haha, fuck you."" She got Tim to drive her, and I guess she picked up John in fredericton, then went to some other guy's place, then to Quebec... maybe, don't really know.

Tomorrow's Sunday, so I have the day off. Woop.

I took a nap at 5 and got up at like 9 or something, I really needed the sleep... I was up until like 2:30am last night playing with my webcam, then had to work at 8am :P 

Haha, I think my (hot chinese) landlord-chick just walked in on one of my roommates and his girlfriend. Hahaha."

Blah... and that's all i ahve to say about these last few days.

While out jogging tonight, I passed by a party filled with hot chicks, maybe I should take a shower and make another run by :P

Yeah, I've decided the weather is nice enough, I should start jogging like I promised myself... I find a nice, fairly secluded route to take.. some up and some down-hill.. probably a mile long.. and I was able to jog about 2/3 of it without resting.. not bad considering I'm totally out of shape..

Here are the figures:

I currently weigh 295lbs. Judging from my height, I should weigh 195 or less to be in the ""normal"" range.. sooo I'd have to lose 100lbs to be normal. Heh.. I don't think that's going to happen. 

I hope to lose 50lbs by the end of september, I think that'd get me in about the shape I'd be *happy* with, then I could just progress as casually as I wanted. NOw to see if it works out like that :)"

She gave a speech and crap at the ceremony, then at the burial she was talking to my friends, then I wantered over, and we saw each other and just smiled... then I laughed to myself.

Maybe it's only me who finds it funny :P

Oh yeah, I'm in Moncton again. Ugh. :P"

I type.

So tired.

Garnet, Sean's grandpa, said I was his first choice for a pallbearer he had, but 6 guys from the wandlyn had already volunteered. That's ok.

We got a card, and a bunch of us signed it.. probably 8 of us, and i put a thing for the Guitar.com Miscers on there too, Garnet almost started crying when I gave it to him. :) :(

I bought Quake 3 yesterday. woohoo cdkey. I told them I wouldn't be coming in again tomorrow.. i would have had an 8am shift :X

Yeah. sleep now... in my own bed for the first time in 3 days."

"event","Sean, one of my best friends died early this morning. He was drunk and got on the catwalk of the Princess Margret bridge, and ended up falling off.

I got a weird-ass message from his MSN account asking where he was and that the police wanted a phone number.. I didn't know what to do at first... I knew it must have been his roommate, but this was at 8:30am and I was obviously asleep then.. it wasn't until much later that the roommate came back on and told a mutual friend, Patty, what had taken place. 

Patty messaged me and asked me to call the hospital. I did, there was no one there under that name. Fuck.

I tried Sean's grandfather, but couldn't find the right number. Fuck.

Finally I called the police. The receptionist transfered me to a Sgt. Once I got transfered, I knew it wasn't going to be good. I forget how the conversation went, but he ended up saying something like ""are you related to him?"" ""no, i'm just a good friend and we're worried abotu what's happened."" ""well, you're aware he's deceased."" *pause* ""Serious? ..er.. uh.. h-how did it happen?"" etc etc..  Apparently he slipped and fell, managing to hit the bass of a concrete support. He died instantly, no pain... for him.

Patty was the first I told, over MSN... she didn't know what to say and went offline soon after. She called me later and stuff.

Then I told John. Same responce,.. we haven't talked to each other much since I said he was dead, just out respective swearing in disbelief.

I told a few other too, but the hardest was Victoria. I knew she'd be upset, but I wasn't ready for what she had in store. After the usual ""This isn't happening"" ""You're joking"" and ""I'm dreaming"" Her mom finally came home, and Kathy showed up. It's not that I don't want to be there for her, but it's difficult over the phone, and after having her ask me if it's a joke 50 times, i was starting to get more annoyed than anything.

I called my parents too, they asked if I wanted to go home, but I don't.. I have a lot of hours to work this week.

I ordered greco because I didn't feel liek making anything, but I also ended up not being hungry.

I'm going to let the people know on the bulletion boards he frequented what happened.. if I died, I would hope my friend would let my internet people know.

I don't know when the funeral arrangements are. I think Sean's grandfather is coming down tomorrow morning.. but I'm not sure when I have to work.. it's either 8am or noon... either way I'm going to try to get ahold of him and get the funeral dates for all my friends.

How am I doing? Suprisingly well.. I was really shakey for a while, and almost loot it before I got off the phone with the police guy, but I'm handling it well enough.  I kinda wish Wendy and/or Kelly had been online tonight before i posted this.. Oh man :X

I'm going to bed soon to get this day over with."

I'm feeling pretty blah right now. Not depressed, just overwhelmed, and rather than escape into playin video games or whatever it is that I suually do, I'm forcing myself to think things through.

It's the summer. I got my marks back, and they weren't good. I passed everything, but considering last terms marks and being on academic probation, I'm probably fucked. I'm sure I could write a sob-story letter to the dean and shit and get them to let me back in, but I'm not sure I want to,

I'm not interested in studying right now; I don't do class work like I should, and I don't study like I should. I'm not interested in what I'm currently taking.. though I have taken ""3 years"" of, and spent $22000 on, it. I thought I wanted to go back next year, but I realized that the only reason I wanted to go back was to get the student loan money. In fact, everything in my life seems to be centered around money lately.. possibly for a long as I can remember.

So, it's all about money, right? Well then why not just work! Well, I know I won't want to work in a place like Super Store for the rest of my life, and to do that I'll need a higher education, heh, and with me not putting my heart into school right now, I have a problem

I don't know what I should do.. Should I drop out for a year, then hope I'm accepted back next? Will I want to go back next year? I have to make these decisions soon. 

Honestly, I don't like going to classes at all. Once I'm there, I'm fine, but I usually want to take off after my first class to head back home to do whatever it is that I do at home (that's a whole 'nother thing in itself). I'd also love to have someone to kick my in the head and say ""hey moron, do this and it'll be all fixed,"" but I guess this is something I have to figure out myself, It's my life after all.

I don't want to quit university for a few reasons. One I mentioned earlier was the whole better job/higher education thing. Another is not wanting to let my parents down, since neither of them went to college, they were proud of me and all that, but they'd get over it... parents do that. A third is my ego.. I like being a University student, and I don't want to be one of those kids who went but just couldn't hack it; I think I'm better than that (I might not be, but I think I am :).

Note I haven't actually made a decision yet. Bleh.

My options right now are as follows:

1. Write a letter to the dean of admissions or whatever, and bullshit my way back into school for next year. I imagine the counselor I went to see would back me. I probably have a 90% chance of getting back in, even though I've sucked it up oldschool the last two years (universities love money). Get another $9K student loan

2. Do what I mentioned above, but only go part time. This woudl allow me to work at the same time, and keep my ""Univeristy Student"" status. This is a good idea, except that I would have to put effort into my classes, and I'm not sure if I'm prepared to do that yet. less of a student loan.

3. Drop school completely, and:
<blockquote>a) work full-time, then try to go back next year. I'd have to contact Jane McGin, or however it's spelt, to see if they actually would let me back in.
b) work full-time, not go back. No higher education, shitty fucking job. Letting down several people.
</blockquote> Both of these choices will require me to pay into my student loan, starting 6 months after I quit school. Bye-bye money.

4 Drop out of university and go to another school like Compu-college or some shit like that. This will cost an assload, and it not worth my time and money, imo... but I list it because I know my mother would suggest it if I were talking it over with her.

What are my ambitions? Right now, my only ambition is to have fun in life. I'm trying to save up $1500 for dj equipment, and as of right now, that's my only goal.. at all. I told my mom I was responsible all through high school, and now it was time for a little stupidity (I don't need to remind myself of January..), but I don't think that's even the case, I'm jsut lazy. Before I wouldn't want to go to work, I just wanted to paly on my computer. Now I'll take almost any shift thrown at me; an example is taking a 4-hour 8-12am sunday shift when chris offered me his. Now I hate mornings, but there will be no customers and it's more money in my pocket.

If I do quit school, even for just a year, I'll have to find a better job.. or at least a second one. Super Store pays me a fair amount per hour because I've worked there so long, and being ""unskilled"" and new job I start, I'll start at minimum wage.. unless it's a call-centre.

That's all I can think of right now. I'm seriously leaning towards the 1-year off deal.. maybe it'll ermind me how much i hate manual labour.. or maybe I'll end up finiding a good job. I'm not sure.. I just want money.

I don't think I'm going to write any more.. Susan should be getting ahold of me sometime soon so we can go to the mall. I also apologise for any typographical errors and misspellings, I don't feel like reading back through this. Later."

"event","So, sean and I checked out Chris' apartment.. it's pretty badass; see (bad) pictures below.y from ontario gave his ok, so we plan to sign the lease (just he and I) and then get the third guy in on the deal... yes, I know.. this could go horribly wrong. The apartment is $850CDN a month plus utilities (about $200 a month, using equalized billing).. so yeah. That's a lot to cover for two people, but the place is 4 bedrooms and centrally located and fucking huge, so we wouldn't have trouble finding roommates if we needed them :P

Then after we looked at the place and met chris' chick roomamte who had just had a rotten tooth removed (ugh...), we headed down to Kings Place so I could ger my damage deposit back from the rentalsmen. It was pretty difficult.. I went to the wrong Rentalsmen place first, then i had to go fill out some bullshit form, only to find out that they'll mail me the cheque later. Bastards.

So  yeah.. I walk top greco after that, enjoy a donair and 9"" garlic finger, then head home. Then Susan messages me at about 5:15, 45 minutes before I hate to work, asking if I want a ride to work, and of course I do! I hung out with her at Superstore helping her shop for a while, until I had to start work. She's pretty cool, I might invite her to see the Matrix with me this weekend or something, provided she's not studying, heh ;P

A new cutter dude started at work today.. Justin. I noticed he has a minor stutering problem, but everyone has something wrong with them, right? He's an all-round cool guy, I'll probably enjoy working with him, I have more to talk about with him than most others at work :P

Yeah, that's it."

Victoria called me tonight, and said something about coming down to go to Hooks or whatever. I had an exam, so I really couldn't go to hang out, but she shows up here (i have the bruises, bite marks, and scratches to prove it, damnit it :P) with Tim (a cool dude) at 11pm or so, then hangs out until like.. 1am, or so, I think. Takes off, comes back at 2:30, convinces me to ""go somewhere"" with them, though she really just wanted to show off her driving skills in Tim's car. Poor dude. Unknown to him, she doesn't even have her beginners, heh.

I just remebered that Victoria was palying with my cellphone. I closely examined it and found a very interesting ""voice message"" left on it. Now, I heard her recording it, but she said she didn't save it. Yeah, like i believed that :P  It's her moaning and making goat noises, nothing too unusual for her, I guess :P

Man, I still have so much fucking packing to do before I move tomorrow, and her showing up really hampered my progress. Oh well, it's not like she was unwanted. I guess I kinda missed her or whatever.

Anyway, This is probably my last post until i get dsl hooked up at my new palce.. someone said it costs an assload to get it done. That sucks. I think I'll get the do-it-yourself package for $25 and figure it out for myself, can't be too hard :P

I fucking hate moving. Sean said he'd probably get a place with me in september, so I think i'll ditch this place then and move in with him come that time :P

Ok, sleeping time!

It was taken while I was on vacation when I was.. 12, I think. I won a trip to New York for 6 days and 5 nights though my job as a newspaper boy.. get a new customer and you got entered in the draw, I got 3 new customers and won! woo! There were like 12 kids who had won from across the province. The ages ranged from 12 to 16 or 18, and we had 4 chaperone.. that's right, NO PARENTS! 

We did all sorts of cool stuff.. we went to a theme park with some awesome rides, rode horses (we obviously weren't in NYC :P), went swimming, hiking, bought stuff (can't get cherry bombs in canada :P). Yeah, it was a good time. I just wish i had been a little older, I'd probably have enjoyed it more :P

This picture, specifically, was taken at the horse stables by me, holding the camera backwards. I have more photos, but they're at (my parents') home :P

Damn! it looked a lot bigger when i went to see it the first time. The room is 9' x 10' with a small closet in one wall, and an entrance on another, plus a window on a third.. I thought it was like 13'x15' :/

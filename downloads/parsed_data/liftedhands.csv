"event","And so i will be sharing my testimony on &quot;How the Lord has bless me in BC&quot; during the anniversary. I was pretty reluctant to hand it in at first because i thought it was only for Yvonne to read but she say she was going to submit it to Jackie for him to screen through and see if it's suitable for the anniversary. I freaked out and refuse to hand it in to her but eventually i did AND I DIDN'T KNOW.<br /><br />On Monday, my room was a complete disaster, it looks a typhoon just hit it. I was turning everything over trying to look for my testimony and i thought i left it in Coffee Bean. I only knew that it was with Yvonne when she called yesterday and told me that my testimony was chosen and once again i totally freaked out. I was in the cab when she called and i think the cab driver was pretty amused by the very disturbed look i had, haha. Half of me wanted to share hoping that it would be glorifying to the Lord and the another half went, &quot;Don't be crazy, in front of all those people, you'll make a fool out of yourself&quot;.<br /><br />All i could say was &quot;let me think about it first&quot;<br />and so i prayed and think and think and think and this verse came into mind&nbsp;<br /><br />&quot;Always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope you have.&quot;<br />1 Peter 3:15<br /><br />So do keep me in prayer, get rid of the millions of butterflies in my stomach.<br />It's nerve wrecking.<br />but its not about me, its about God<br /><br /><strong>Not because of who I am<br />But because of what You've done<br />Not because of what I've done<br />But because of who You're<br /></strong>- Casting Crowns &quot;Who Am I&quot;<br />"

Yesterday was fun, instead of&nbsp;working, Arjunan, (i can remember his name) and i&nbsp;just sat down on the bench most of the time&nbsp;to admire the scenery. The lights dancing on the river, the occasional breeze, the sky, the tall buildings. God's wonderful creation. 

We even had time for supper at 2.40am. 
Crayfish and&nbsp;abalone noodles. 
Arjunan virgin try of crayfish, and he said it tastes like Stingray.

Everything went well until Uncle Roland started asking Yvonne about the brownie/cake. Shir and i stared at each other for awhile before going &quot;Huh, what cake? where got cake?&quot; Haha.

Meeting the darlings again was great. 
altar call was great, dwelling in the presence of God again was great, the bright lights, the peace, the music that is only between God and i.

Small group was alright, its been a year and 6 months since i last join the Sunday small group. 

For those who have not heard..
I'm taking a break from Gen Acts until the fasting period is over. I'm going to make use of this time to really think over what i want or rather what God have plan for me. It is with this group of darlings or does He have some other plans.&nbsp; 

i love the people in Gen Acts and i am more than willing&nbsp;to continue serving there too but i got to make sure that Gen Acts is indeed what God has planned for me.

I almost break out in tears when i let them know earlier in the day, haha silly me. 
I know i'll still see them on Sunday and we can still go on outings together but.. 
its been&nbsp;a loooooong looooooooong time&nbsp;and i make so many great friends over there.

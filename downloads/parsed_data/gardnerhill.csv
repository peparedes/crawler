<b>***</b>

Rain lashed my body. Thunder boomed. The <i>Baker</i> heaved up and down the ocean swells.

Captain Shear-Lock stood at the wheel, his attention focused only upon steering through the wild mess.

I looked straight up the mainmast to my goal, one hand fisted in a ratline, an ice ball in my gut. The last time I&rsquo;d been up these lines I&rsquo;d been flung off into the sea and nearly drowned (I still owed the bos&rsquo;n Angel for saving my life). <i>Aye, and it was because you let go the rigging like a green-horn, </i>I reminded myself<i>.</i>

It was my turn to stand lookout, one-handed or no. I was a Baker. And I needed to prove to the captain that I&rsquo;d learned my lesson.

I gripped the nearest ratline with my hand and pulled myself up.

The rain-soaked sails and rigging whipped back and forth, dousing as well as shaking me like a rat in a terrier&rsquo;s mouth. I clung with hand and elbow-crook and feet, my saw-hand strapped to my back. At every sail-drop I hoisted myself up another line. Whip, drop, another line. Don&rsquo;t look up, don&rsquo;t look down.

I tumbled into the crow. Safe.

I saw the captain&rsquo;s hands unclench from the wheel.

And only then did I realise that of all Captain Shear-Lock&rsquo;s deeds, this was his bravest."

<b>Summary: </b>We&rsquo;ll take a cup of kindness no matter where we are or who we are.
<b>Author&#39;s Notes: </b>Written for the December 11, 2015 LJ Comm Watson&#39;s Woes Wadvent open prompt &ldquo;Christmas Cheer.&rdquo; The Great Mouse Detective vignette is an independent follow-up to my story <a href=""http://archiveofourown.org/works/489367"">The Cage</a> in my Egg Hunt series.

<lj-cut text=""Fluff below. Enter at your own risk."">
The woodcock Mrs. Hudson had prepared for Holmes&rsquo; dinner sufficed for two hungry men who&rsquo;d prevented a great injustice; our meal was seasoned with the righteous knowledge that an innocent man would dine that night with his family instead of with a gaoler, and that a weak and wicked man had been shown a dram of Christmas charity that reflected better on his benefactor than on his own character.

The crowning glory was the bowl of punch kept simmering on the hob while we had spent the day on a very literal goose chase. The heady, delicious odour of ale, spices, orange peel, and baked crab-apples cheered us even before Holmes ladled the smoking wassail into our cups.

Two such old and dear friends needed no words to make our Christmas toast. We met each other&rsquo;s eyes, smiled, and did full justice to Mrs. Hudson&rsquo;s concoction.

***

&ldquo;Another gift from Timothy Wainwright&rsquo;s parents, Dawson,&rdquo; Basil said with a smile, turning away from the post-mouse at the door bearing a hamper that clinked with the unmistakeable sound of wine bottles.

I buried my face in my paws and groaned. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m beginning to regret saving that child, Basil. I&rsquo;ve had quite enough holiday cheer for a while.&rdquo; I do love the food and drink that flows at this festive time of year &ndash; sadly, often to excess.

&ldquo;If you will insist on being heroic, my dear fellow, you must suffer the bad with the good. Ah, excellent!&rdquo; My friend pulled one vintage out of the hamper and examined the label. &ldquo;Very wise folk, the Wainwrights. Several of these reds are simple table wines that will be capital when they are mulled. A small cup will also settle our stomachs after Mrs. Judson&rsquo;s splendid cheese-onion pie and plum-pudding.&rdquo;

I straightened up a little at that, a thread of cheer at the thought. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure a gill of that concoction will settle both our stomachs. You&rsquo;re not accustomed to eating that much either, my boy.&rdquo;

Basil was already headed to the kitchen to find a saucepan and the appropriate spices. We were both content to let our housekeeper do our cooking, but mulled wine was within our own abilities.

A loud pounding on the door startled both of us.

I sat up, stifling a groan at my full stomach. Basil set down the hamper with a clink. The light in his eyes was familiar to me by now.

I waddled to the door and opened it. A tall grey mouse pushed through with a swirl of cold air, breath smoking and eyes wide with panic. &ldquo;The pearl! The blue pearl!&rdquo; he gasped, and collapsed on our hearth-rug.

After that first shock, Basil and I turned and exchanged a grin. A case, on this most festive of days? We couldn&rsquo;t ask for a better gift. &ldquo;Crack open the bottle, Basil, this poor chap needs it more than we do,&rdquo; I said, and helped the swooning fellow to his feet. &ldquo;Come, sir, tell us everything.&rdquo;

***

&ldquo;&hellip;it was that misplaced bottle of vodka that caught my attention. Why was it on the bottom shelf?&rdquo; Joan gestured and waved her arms, enthusiasm in every move. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not how most bars treat a bottle of Gray Goose, it&rsquo;s kept on the top shelf!&rdquo;

Sherlock poured hot water into the tea pot, back turned to hide his proud grin at his partner&rsquo;s triumph in tracking down the jewelry fencers; he didn&rsquo;t want her to interpret his reaction as patronisation.

&ldquo;&hellip;so Ryder&rsquo;s in custody, they&rsquo;ve set Horner free so she&rsquo;ll celebrate with her kids after all, and Detective Bell&rsquo;s carbuncle is getting better. It&rsquo;s a Christmas miracle.&rdquo; Joan held out her palm.

Sherlock obligingly smacked it with his own free hand as he set down the teapot in front of the cartons of Ethiopian takeaway and the two red-paper crackers at their places. &ldquo;Well done, Watson. This means we can have our own supper in peace.&rdquo;

&ldquo;So how&rsquo;s your own bloodwork coming along?&rdquo;

Sherlock sat down and took up the pot. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve narrowed it down to South American rodents. I&rsquo;ve emailed my contact at the Bronx Zoo for information on capybaras and Dr. Asheer should get me results tomorrow. It IS a treat to work in a city where December 25 is just another day for a good portion of the population, it&rsquo;s much more efficient.&rdquo;

Joan Watson smiled at her partner and took up her teacup. &ldquo;Agreed. I&rsquo;ll be with my family for New Year &ndash; Oren&rsquo;s despaired of teaching me how to make proper dumplings, but he keeps trying; I was always too busy studying to help him and Mom in the kitchen. But we&rsquo;ll share a bowl of noodles before I leave you alone in mid-February. Merry Christmas, Sherlock.&rdquo;

Sherlock tapped her teacup with his own. &ldquo;Feliz Navidad, Watson.&rdquo;

<b>Summary: </b>Poor &lsquo;Killer&rsquo; Evans (aka John Garrideb, aka James Winter). He never could catch a break, ever.
<b>Author&#39;s Notes: </b>For the October 2015 Watson&#39;s Woes prompt: A Halloween tale set in my Vampire!Holmes &ldquo;<a href=""http://archiveofourown.org/series/283167"">Vermilion Problem</a>&rdquo; AU.

<lj-cut text=""Enter freely, of your own will."">
Close &ndash; so damned close, and he just had to run into the only two bulls on the whole damn&rsquo; British Isles who couldn&rsquo;t be bribed into silence. Peachy. Just Jimmy Winter&rsquo;s goddamn luck once again.

Prison for killing that cheating son of a bitch counterfeiter Prescott? Should have gotten a goddamn parade for that one. What made it worse was sweating it out in stir, thinking of Prescott&rsquo;s treasure-generating printing press hidden where no one would find it &ndash; and getting free just to learn that some loco skull-collector was squatting on top of it, a chap who never left his rooms.

All right. He&rsquo;d gotten the damn&rsquo; idea from those detective stories he&rsquo;d read in lock-up, especially the one about the red-head society created to lure some sucker of a pawnbroker out of his shop. The old bird&rsquo;s strange surname provided a basis for cooking up a get-rich-quick scheme that would crowbar Nathan Garrideb out of his rooms long enough for James Winter to lay claim on Prescott&rsquo;s press.

But damn if those two damn&rsquo; Pinkertons from that red-head business weren&rsquo;t real after all &ndash; and gunning for him!

Large as life and twice as natural, and hard to miss after seeing their pictures in the magazines.&nbsp; A tall lean pale chap who held his gun like it was a walking-stick &ndash; didn&rsquo;t act like someone who&rsquo;d fire it if provoked. But the quiet mustachioed man right behind him <u>knew</u> what it was to fire that Webley in hand, the way he held himself shouted <i>soldier</i>. The fancy English detective Sherlock Holmes, and his bodyguard.

Heh heh. They&rsquo;d drawn on him first, he&rsquo;d easily get off on self-defence if he was caught.

Rueful laugh, acknowledgement of their triumph &ndash; and a gun-draw that Wyatt Earp couldn&rsquo;t beat. First shot whipped off to drop the bodyguard with a thud, second straight through the detective&rsquo;s heart. There. Now one more between the bodyguard&rsquo;s eyes to finish him off, and he could &ndash;

An explosion of stars behind his own eyes. The ground rose up and hit him.

Then two icy hands clawed into his shirt and hauled him up, and James Winter looked past the whirling stars and clanging in his head to stare into the glittering eyes of a mad dog and a snarling mouth like an open black pit.

&ldquo;You killed Watson. Your blood is mine for this,&rdquo; Sherlock Holmes hissed like a snake. His breath stank like an opened grave.

He&rsquo;d shot the son of a bitch straight through the heart.

All thought fled his clanging head in the face of pure icy terror. He&rsquo;d seen that bullet go true into the man&rsquo;s upper left chest, he&rsquo;d <i>seen</i> it &ndash; the same shot he&rsquo;d used to drop three other men and that had gained him his nickname. He&rsquo;d heard of men so overcome with rage that they kept moving in the few seconds after being fatally shot, just before they dropped dead. Hell, he&rsquo;d even joked about cusses so goddamn mean that shooting them would only make them mad. And here was the joke in the flesh.

All right, joke&rsquo;s over now drop dead. Dead. Drop dead.

The gaping black pit of an open mouth opened wider, his teeth &ndash; oh God teeth like a rattler&rsquo;s fangs but close together in front like a rabbit&rsquo;s. What the goddamn everloving hell &ndash; ?

&ldquo;Ohhh.&rdquo;

Such a small noise from behind both of them.

The viper&rsquo;s mouth snapped shut. The eyes were a man&rsquo;s eyes again, shining grey. Sherlock Holmes whipped his head around to see the bodyguard &ndash; Watson &ndash; sitting up and groaning in pain. His gripping hands let go without second thought.

Winter fell back, no longer held up, moaning himself as he banged the back of his head on the floor. More stars, pain swirling. Every limb he had felt made of water.

This didn&rsquo;t make sense, this didn&rsquo;t make sense. He knew he hadn&rsquo;t fired a deadly shot at Watson, but &ndash; those mad eyes, those ghastly rattler-teeth &ndash; surely Winter hadn&rsquo;t been coshed so hard that he saw things that weren&rsquo;t there. He&rsquo;d seen anger in the recently-wounded or fury in men whose pals he&rsquo;d just shot. Nothing like that cold mask. Nothing.

By the time Winter could sit up Watson was in a chair, his trousers torn open to reveal a bloody thigh wound where the first shot had nicked him, and Holmes was on his knees on the floor before him, long pale hands running over the red trickle. Watson was saying something in a soothing tone, clapping the other man on the shoulder. Not just his bodyguard, then &ndash; they were pals. What kind of idiot lawman got chummy with his hired muscle?

When both men stood and looked into the cellar, Winter tried one last time &ndash; one thing about cops and Pinkertons was how easily they could be bought off. But not these two, of course &ndash; wouldn&rsquo;t accept a fiver. Why couldn&rsquo;t he have been tailed by some corrupt, log-stupid Peeler eager to supplement his measly salary?

No &ndash; it was out to flag down a cab and off to the police station, between the two men he&rsquo;d tried to kill. Prison again, and his pot of gold smashed. God damn it, he never <i>could</i> catch a break.

Watson was quiet and calm despite sitting next to a man who&rsquo;d just tried to kill him, fingers tapping lightly over his roughly-bandaged thigh; it was clear he&rsquo;d been a soldier and didn&rsquo;t take these things personally. But Holmes trembled like an aspen, very lightly but constantly, as if he&rsquo;d been lost in a blizzard, and spent the ride looking out at the dusk-lit streets. Winter remembered those glittering mad-dog eyes, his shot straight at the man&rsquo;s chest (did he wear some sort of armour beneath? Did he keep a cigarette case or a book there?), and suppressed his own shudder.

&ldquo;Poor Mr. Garrideb,&rdquo; Watson said. &ldquo;Your cruel ruse will be a terrible blow to him, Evans.&rdquo;

Winter snorted, back on solid ground with that comment. &ldquo;Gullible old fool. Suckers deserve to be rooked.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Including the &lsquo;suckers&rsquo; who would have been in dire financial straits by taking your false banknotes?&rdquo; Holmes&rsquo; voice dripped with revulsion at his callousness.

Winter laughed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a cold cruel world, Mr. Holmes, and it&rsquo;s every man for himself. Eat, or get eaten.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Oh. I quite agree.&rdquo;

Winter suppressed another shudder. Holmes&rsquo; tone on those words felt like he&rsquo;d just bitten down on a knife that had been buried in ice.

Watson turned to look at Holmes. And there was a fear in his eyes Winter hadn&rsquo;t seen when he&rsquo;d <i>shot</i> the son of a bitch. &ldquo;Holmes. I am <u style=""text-underline:words;"">all right</u>. I&rsquo;ve taken worse injury sharpening my scalpels.&rdquo;

The hell? What did his dang bullet-scratch have to do with this?

A long pause. Then the ice-knife voice again &ndash; thawed, just a hair, enough to drip frigid humour. &ldquo;That is true, Watson. You have taken far worse bloodlettings in my service, many times.&rdquo;

Watson smiled as if it was a private joke. &ldquo;Many times, old man. This adventure has been worth many wounds.&rdquo;

Holmes kept his face toward the window; but his rigid shoulders relaxed.

Not Watson&rsquo;s words but his affectionate tone made realization dawn in Winter &ndash; and with that realization, revulsion. Oh. These two were <u>friends</u>, not just pals &ndash; friends the way women and pansies had friends. On the Chicago streets where he grew up, real men didn&rsquo;t have friends. Even here in England, they understood that much &ndash; a chap could play cards with the same fellow for 20 years and only say &ldquo;what a pity&rdquo; if the other man was murdered, instead of snarling a vow of vengeance. These two? Hell, they might as well be queer for each other.

Winter couldn&rsquo;t keep his mouth shut &ndash; it wasn&rsquo;t in his nature, and this open display of warmth, on top of his lost plan, fortune and freedom, turned every word into a sneer. &ldquo;Maybe I oughta walk to the police station so you two lovebirds can spoon. Sorry I put a hole in your sweetheart here, Mr. Holmes.&rdquo;

The stillness in the cab, broken only by the clopping hooves, fell like a load of snow on branches, and as warm. Oh, that did it, Jimmy Winter &ndash; if they&rsquo;re real men they&rsquo;ll thrash you proper for that before handing you to the coppers.

Holmes raised his fist. Winter tightened his jaw and clenched his own bound fists. He wouldn&rsquo;t take a beating lying down, cuffs or no goddamn cuffs.

But all the detective did with his clenched hand was to thump the roof of the cab, twice. His voice was level and cool as if ordering a drink at a posh club. &ldquo;Cabbie? Pall Mall.&rdquo;

The cab shifted as the driver changed direction.

Winter blinked and frowned. Pall Mall? The swells district? What were they going to do, give him a flogging with a diamond necklace? Sic some dowager&rsquo;s lap-dog on him? Or maybe some of those rich old coots in those gentlemen&rsquo;s clubs kept boxers on retainer for just such a purpose.

He turned to smirk at Watson. What was a beating or two here? What were the scales of English law to fear by a man who&rsquo;d survived the streets of goddamn Chicago?

Watson glared at him, clearly furious at the innuendo. But there was something else in his expression. <i>Pity</i>?

The cab stopped. The descending summer sun was still in the sky &ndash; it was not 8 o&rsquo;clock &ndash; but the lamps were alight already, their electrical glow testifying to the wealth on this street. Lights shone from curtains and from doorways and through windows. The place <i>felt</i> posh &ndash; safe and comfortable, miles removed from the stark poverty and violence a few streets over. Winter&rsquo;s fists balled up in his lap. All right, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, time for you to &ndash;

A snick, and the cuffs dropped from his wrists. Holmes withdrew the key he held. His eyes glinted like silver. &ldquo;Get out.&rdquo;

Oh. An English gentleman, he wanted everything <u>fair</u> before giving him a drubbing. Well no one had to tell Jimmy Winter twice how to save his own skin. He tumbled out of the cab and whirled around, fists up, ready.

Both men were still in the cab. Holmes had no expression at all, nor did he make a move to get out. Watson&#39;s face was still a mix of pity and anger.

Winter gaped at them both. They were just freeing him? Here?

&hellip;Oh. My. He must have hit the jackpot with his little joke, hadn&rsquo;t he? They <u>were</u> nancy-boys for each other. They threw you in prison over here for that sort of thing, like that Oscar Wilde fairy. Now everything made sense. They didn&rsquo;t dare turn him in or he&rsquo;d blab. He tamped down his grin.

&ldquo;All I ask of you, Mr. Evans,&rdquo; said Sherlock Holmes, &ldquo;is to think about what you have done. I want you to ruminate on exactly how close you came to killing Dr. John Watson &ndash; whose death would devastate Sherlock Holmes beyond any recovery in this life.&rdquo;

Winter&rsquo;s gorge rose at the confession and the maudlin affectation. If this Holmes ponce burst into tears or started reciting romantic poetry Winter would sock him anyway, just on principle.&nbsp; He couldn&rsquo;t say anything that wouldn&rsquo;t get him into more trouble with these benders, so he only nodded. Why, of <i>course</i> he&rsquo;d sit in the corner and think of what a naughty boy he&rsquo;d been.

&ldquo;Good.&rdquo; Holmes disappeared back into the cab. &ldquo;Cabbie?&rdquo;

&ldquo;Wait.&rdquo; It was Watson, still at the window. He looked at Winter long and hard. &ldquo;Evans. I cannot hate you for this wound, for what it has revealed is immeasurable to me. But for what you have surely done to a harmless old man with your lies and your greed, and the terrible damage to an empire&rsquo;s financial trust you would have perpetrated, you must be stopped. It stops here. Tonight.&rdquo; Watson&#39;s head went back into the cab, and off it went.

Winter bit back his grin as he watched the cab recede. Suckers. Looks like there was one benefit to them being queers &ndash; for him, anyway. Well, off to find a drink-house in this fancy neighborhood to &ndash;

Something clattered on the macadam from the hansom and lay on the ground.

As the cab clopped out of sight, Winter approached warily, eyes squinting at the dark object.

It was his gun. They&rsquo;d given him back his gun. And when he picked it up he saw they hadn&rsquo;t even unloaded it &ndash; still 4 shots left. He only just kept himself from throwing his head back in a bark of laughter. Ha! They didn&rsquo;t want any evidence that they&rsquo;d ever had him, so the bobbies wouldn&rsquo;t rag them for not bringing him in.

Winter tucked the pistol into his trousers, eyes darting everywhere, just in case this was an elaborate trap or an ambush. He got a few curious looks &ndash; his clothing really did not fit in here &ndash; but men went about their business on the thoroughfare, going into doorways all along the street that were clearly for private clubs.

Now what? He couldn&rsquo;t go back to the house, his Prescott press was in the hands of the police by now, and they&rsquo;d no doubt have his boarding house surrounded by now too. Of course (Winter grinned) he <i>could</i> do what he&rsquo;d been asked, and think good and hard about what a bad boy he had been and how close he&rsquo;d come to killing Sherlock Holmes&rsquo; bosom companion. He restrained himself from guffawing aloud; that would be out of place here.

He needed a drink. For that he could use some cash. He had his gun. If he lured some rich sucker into the shadows that would &ndash;

<i>Come in.</i>

Had someone spoken?

He looked at the front of the building where he stood. He walked up to take a better look.

A handsome establishment like all the other buildings along Pall Mall, wealth showing in every neat detail from the impeccable cast-iron stair railings to the congenial electric lamp bathing the doorway in friendly illumination and glinting off the brass plate beside the door. In the foreyard stood a marble statue of an old man in a toga holding a lantern &ndash; marble, not plaster. A gentleman&rsquo;s club all right, and dripping with money.

The building seemed almost to exude an air of bonhomie, as if pleased that he was there. Such a warm, inviting glow the light cast.

<i>Come in</i>.

His instincts must be right on the nose for this place &ndash; this club was practically begging him to enter.

Winter looked himself up and down. His clothes were too rough and dirty for him to pass as a gentleman. But they&nbsp; might forgive the clothes if his American accent and rough life found favor with them; a lot of these stodgy old English gents liked Wild West stories, and it wouldn&rsquo;t be the first time a curious Londoner had cheerfully bought him a drink for such yarns. Play up the roughneck and he was set &ndash; and the worst they&rsquo;d do was throw him out. And if not, the one thing he knew about these clubs was there was always a card game going on &ndash; and where there was a card game there was another source of income.

No knocker and no bell-pull. No timidity either. He turned the handle and walked in, as he&rsquo;d seen the previous two men do.

There was no doorman or valet on duty. There was no one in the anteroom. The place was quiet, so quiet; plush velvet carpeting under foot, a grandfather clock that made no ticking sounds. All he could hear was his own breathing. Winter looked at a row of gleaming silk toppers on pegs and grinned, pulling off his own tweed cap to keep them company. By the time the night was through he&rsquo;d have them believing he&rsquo;d shot desperadoes in Dodge City.

He turned and almost gave a start as a stout man walked into the antechamber, his feet having made no sound on the carpet. The stout man held up one hand to stop whatever Winter had been about to say, and put a finger to his lips. Winter nodded; the silence was deafening.

No butler, this fellow; his suit was well-made but plain, not ostensibly costly, the suit of a higher-up in a law firm or in politics. One of the club bigwigs, here either to let him in or throw him out. Winter stood straight and looked the large man in the eyes.

The man looked him up and down, his eyes somber and grey, and nodded without a word. Winter opened his mouth to speak, but the man shook his head once again. With an incline of his head, he indicated that Winter should follow him. Winter walked behind the man, smiling a little. Finally, his luck was changing.

The two walked through a doorway into a vast sitting room full of men dozing in armchairs, fingers laced on their bellies or newspapers draping the somnolent forms. None of the men&rsquo;s chairs faced each other, and none roused to watch the two men walking through the sumptuously-appointed chamber; not so much as a ticking clock disturbed the silence of the room. The windows were covered by heavy velvet curtains. Winter fought the urge to yell or fire his gun in the air to startle the lot of them.

They left the chamber and entered another room; this one was nearly identical to the first room, appointed with sumptuous chairs, dark walnut bookcases and handsome paintings, but was empty of people save for the stout clubman and the American interloper. The single door to the room closed.

&ldquo;You may speak in here,&rdquo; the stout man said, and Winter nearly jumped at hearing a voice after so much silence. The sound seemed to bounce off the walls. &ldquo;This is the Strangers Room, the only place where speech is permitted in this club.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Dang!&rdquo; Winter stared at the closed door and shook his head. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen some crazy things, but if that don&rsquo;t beat all!&rdquo; He took another hard look at the clubman. This mixed his luck once again &ndash; lucky to find an eccentric club that just took odd fellows off the street to join them which would explain why he&rsquo;d felt so welcomed going in, but&hellip; &ldquo;No <u>talking</u> in this little saloon of yours?&rdquo; Then how the hell did these blamed old codgers play cards or billiards, and how could he spin American yarns if his lips were sealed?

&ldquo;Those who break that rule are removed. It is a peculiarity of our particular club, one of many.&rdquo; The man&rsquo;s voice was deep and sonorous, and pleasant to listen to. &ldquo;Have a seat if you wish, sir, and I will tell you about yourself.&rdquo;

Winter bristled at the presumption, even though he was the one who&rsquo;d walked in uninvited. &ldquo;Seems to me I&rsquo;d be the better one to speak of myself, if I was so inclined.&rdquo;

The man&rsquo;s eyes did not leave his face, and his expression of calm regard did not change. &ldquo;You are an American, obviously, but one recently released from an English prison &ndash; Newgate, I would say, from how your accent has changed. You were born in Chicago and spent most of your life there, though you have spent the last six to eight years in London, most of them in the aforesaid prison. You are fond of cards, have a violent temper, and know very well how to use that pistol you currently have hidden in your trousers.&rdquo; The man regarded him with a placid expression, his pleasant tone changing not a jot.

Winter stared at the man, the hair lifting on the back of his head. &ldquo;How in the <i>hell</i> &ndash; &ldquo;

&ldquo;We forbid all speech in my club save in here, and not even in the Strangers Room is profanity permitted.&rdquo; The man&rsquo;s tone was still light and pleasant but a cool thread ran through it. &ldquo;A man&rsquo;s aspect reveals all to those who can perceive. Certain other indications, from other senses, let me know that you have killed men in the past &ndash; most likely the reason you were in prison &ndash; and one particular sign lets me know that you engaged in gunfire tonight and spilled a man&rsquo;s blood, to the great distress of another man. Fortunately you are faster than you are accurate, as that is the sole reason you are alive right now.&rdquo;

Ice crawled up Winter&rsquo;s back. <i>He&rsquo;s a mind-reader he guessed he has a telephone he&rsquo;s a Pinkerton this was a trap show nothing show nothing &ndash; </i>He made himself laugh. &ldquo;Mighty tall storytelling, Mister. But I just came here looking for a drink and chose your place on my own.&rdquo;

&ldquo;I think not.&rdquo; The man&rsquo;s eyes were calm, even benign as they remained on Winter&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;You would not be here unless one particular person wished you to wind up inside. My brother and I share a similarity of thought processes, though his have become clouded with irrelevancies of late. Such as the love he bears for his companion.&rdquo; Revulsion flickered across the man&rsquo;s face; he stressed that word as if forcing it out. &ldquo;His distress alone told me whom you wounded.&rdquo;

Winter looked at the level grey eyes and aquiline nose of this portly man, and everything fell into place like a wall of solid fear as he recognized whom this clubber resembled. His instincts about going in couldn&rsquo;t have been wronger. Oh sweet Jesus Christ, Sherlock Holmes had a <i>brother</i>? But there in the substantial flesh before him was the Pinkerton&rsquo;s sibling, stout where the detective was whippet-lean &ndash; this fellow must have a better cook. He clearly knew his brother was a fairy, that disgusted expression said as much, but family was family.

Was <i>that</i> why they&rsquo;d dropped his gun in front of this place? To lure him into a trap?

His gun.

His gun was out and aimed between the man&rsquo;s eyes. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to plug you.&rdquo; He made his voice as low and dangerous as he could, the voice of Killer Evans. &ldquo;But I will if you don&rsquo;t let me leave here.&rdquo; Kill Sherlock Holmes&rsquo; brother and it was the rope if they caught him again. But if this British chap thought he was desperado enough not to care&hellip;

&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t kill me, that much is true.&rdquo; The man&rsquo;s voice was unchanged by fear or agitation; he might have been chiding a new member instead of facing the muzzle of a gun. &ldquo;If you are a man of reason, you realise that the prison sentence for attempted murder is far less than the fate for deliberate, willful murder. I am only taking you in hand as a favour from one brother to another. You will remain in this room until the police arrive in the morning; they know not to trespass here sunset to sunrise.&rdquo;

&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stay in Hell first,&rdquo; Winter snarled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m leaving, now, with whatever valuables I can coax out of your members. And I&rsquo;ll say whatever the Hell I want in this goddamned establishment of yours.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Enough of this.&rdquo; The man reached for Winter&rsquo;s pistol as if taking a drink off a tray.

Self-defense.

Two perfect shots &ndash; one between the portly man&rsquo;s eyes and the other straight through his heart. The sound of gunfire filled the room and bounced off the walls.

Winter&rsquo;s dash for the door out was blocked. By the man he&rsquo;d just shot. Level grey eyes were now crowned by a black gaping bullet-hole in the forehead like a third eye.

&ldquo;How odd,&rdquo; said the brother of Sherlock Holmes, &ldquo;that you have exactly described our club with that profane statement.&rdquo;

Winter screamed.

&ldquo;Precisely the reason I brought you to the Strangers&rsquo; Room. No sound escapes these walls.&rdquo; The man&rsquo;s voice was as calm and courteous as ever, despite the gaping bullet wound in his forehead and the tattered hole over his left breast that shed no blood. &ldquo;Club members loathe disturbances during daylight hours, and make their unhappiness plain to the one who disturbed them; it was for your own safety I requested silence as you walked through the rooms. Please have a seat.&rdquo;

Winter all but fell into a chair behind him. Every bone and muscle in him had turned to water. He could not stop staring at the creature whose three-eyed face swam before him (the gaping forehead hole seemed to be a little smaller now).

&ldquo;The sun is nearly set. The police will be here precisely at dawn tomorrow, when our regulars will once more seek rest. You will be safe here as long as you do not attempt to leave the room. You did notice that this club produces a certain aura that is very pleasing to certain passers-by. Most so affected walk in and never walk out. Club members will mistake you for such a fly in our web, should you open this door. You have free use of this room; these chairs are comfortable, the electric lights will remain on all night and the library is extensive. I regret that I cannot offer you any nourishment, as our club&rsquo;s fare is not the sort taken by outsiders.&rdquo;

The words flew in and out of Winter&rsquo;s mind without remaining. His eyes were fixed on watching the bullet-hole in the man&rsquo;s forehead dwindle and diminish like a rapidly-healing puncture wound.

The clubman continued to address him as coolly as if discussing his investments. &ldquo;Do not confuse this act with mercy. What I do, I do for my brother&rsquo;s sake. Once again, I remind you that it is because you wounded Dr. Watson instead of killing him that you will walk out of that door and see another sunrise.&rdquo; The grey-eyed man made a moue of disgust again. &ldquo;Sherlock&rsquo;s instincts are fouled with the taint of mortal love, or he would demand retribution for what you had stolen from him. But mortals have their own justice, and it is that you will face.&rdquo;

He was dreaming. The Pinkerton had given him a bigger knock on the head than he&rsquo;d thought, and he was dreaming all this Edgar Allen Poe stuff.

&ldquo;I have other duties that require my attention elsewhere. Again, I remind you that you are safe in this room as long as you do not attempt to leave. You will return to police custody at sunup. Perhaps you will learn a more useful trade in prison than shooting other men over cards.

&ldquo;At the very least, you may learn not to come so pitifully armed against an older and better-equipped opponent.&rdquo;

And the elder Holmes grinned, showing a row of wolf&rsquo;s teeth in a man&rsquo;s mouth, his eyes black and shining as coal-oil.

Winter pissed himself.

With a last look of disgusted contempt (his eyes were grey again, the bullet-hole nearly vanished), the stout besuited fellow walked to the solitary door in or out of the Strangers Room, and was gone. The door closed with a snick.

He had to get out. He had to get out of here. Oh dear God in heaven if he stayed here another minute he&rsquo;d go mad. Winter dragged himself to his wobbly legs, heedless of his damp stinking trousers, and tottered toward the door.

Something scratched at the other side, like a dog begging to come in.

He froze.

More scratching, that grew until it sounded like a whole pack of dogs testing the door.

He took a step back.
No howling, no bays of bloodlust, no human roars. No human speech. Only that scratching &ndash; and what sounded like a large creature sniffing at something. The door creaked a little.

The sun had set.

***

&ldquo;&hellip;and the Killer returned to those shades from which he had just emerged.&rdquo; Watson set the manuscript down on the table next to his teacup, with only one small apprehensive glance at the nearby humming from the bees weaving through the flowerbeds. &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;

Sherlock Holmes smiled as liplessly as a cobra under the broad-brimmed hat that kept the sun off his face. He still carried a faint flush on both cheeks from their activity the night before. &ldquo;Ambiguous ending, Watson. Your readers will simply assume he was re-imprisoned.&rdquo;

&ldquo;I <i>could</i> speak of him babbling about demons to his keepers at Bedlam, but then I&rsquo;d leave the readers with the unexplained mystery of why Killer Evans became a shrieking, gibbering madman during an overnight stay at the Diogenes Club. Ambiguity protects all the guilty parties, Holmes.&rdquo; Watson reached for his tea with the hand that bore a bandaged wrist. &ldquo;Poor fellow.&rdquo;

Holmes snorted inelegantly, and poured his own tea. &ldquo;You are entirely too soft-hearted, my dear.&rdquo;

Watson smiled. &ldquo;I owe him, for more than your declaration &ndash; ah, you smile, dear chap, but human beings do like to hear these things now and then even if they know them to be unspoken truths. Evans was a brute, and he <i>would</i> shoot my already-damaged leg, but he galvanized our plans to retire from the field.&rdquo;

&ldquo;<u>Your</u> plans, my dear boy. Retirement is a foreign concept to my family.&rdquo; The former detective looked around at the rolling downs and the garden, as bemused as if dropped here. &ldquo;But yes. That was when I finally realised that you were indeed getting older, and it was time to stop endangering ourselves. This will give us a safer, longer time together before the only fortunate creatures you feed are flyspawn and mold. And I crumble to dust.&rdquo;

Watson bowed his head under the guise of spreading honey on his bread. &ldquo;You need not end your own life with mine. I keep telling you that.&rdquo; He knew of the morocco case under lock and key in Holmes&rsquo; study; the syringe, vials of holy water and powdered garlic, and the blessed bread that was poison to his kind.

A long-fingered hand, still warm from Watson&#39;s blood, stroked the man&rsquo;s cheek light as a bee landing. &ldquo;Not life, dear one. Existence. You have carried life for both of us these decades together. And when your life ends, it will be my choice to trade immortality for the honour of becoming the soil that covers your grave.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Your brother &ndash;&ldquo;

&ldquo;Mycroft has disowned me thoroughly by now. He remains in London with his club and those who gather there.&rdquo;

Watson shuddered. &ldquo;Poor Evans. I wouldn&rsquo;t have wished that fate on him.&rdquo;

And for just a moment the grey eyes he knew so well went cold as steel ball-bearings, and the cheekbones tightened. &ldquo;He spilled your blood. No one takes what is rightfully mine.&rdquo; Then the eyes were warm grey again, and Sherlock Holmes savoured his tea.

The mortal man drank his own tea, sitting in the garden with his companion while bees wove patterns in the Sussex air overhead, his bandaged hand resting on the walking-stick propped against the table. Two bullet-wounds in that leg now &ndash; and each one leading to the best thing about his life. He was the luckiest man in the world.

"event","<div class=""repost"">That time of the year again - <a href=""http://bannedbooksweek.org"">Banned Books Week</a> - to reflect on the attempts to keep ideas away from people via banning, challenging or removing books.

And it&#39;s time once again for me to post my Banned Books Week theme song. Names in parentheses are the authors of those particular verses; verses by me are un-parenthese&#39;d. Feel free to add your own verses (based on true accounts)

Remember, folks: It&#39;s just as bad to ban books for &quot;noble&quot; reasons. If certain books make you uneasy because of their racist / misogynist / anti-semitic / homophobic content (<i>Huckleberry Finn / Taming of the Shrew / Mein Kampf / It&#39;s Okay to Wait</i>), then talk about them, balance them with other material, discover that there&#39;s other great books out there besides the ones written by dead white straight men and add those to the curricula. The solution to unwanted free speech is MORE free speech, not less.

<i>(Unfortunately, these are all true stories. Other people&#39;s contributions are noted with bylines in parentheses. Feel free to add your own verses -- just make sure they are all true stories of censorship and attempted censorship. I also ask that the last two verses &ndash; the Huck Finn, and the &quot;last week in September&quot; verses &ndash; </i>remain<i> the last two verses.)</i>


Oh, my name is Holden Caulfield, I&#39;m a member of the banned,
An angry adolescent in a city grim and grand.
I use four-letter words that any kid can understand,
So JD&#39;s masterwork&#39;s a master target to be banned.

I&#39;m Charlotte A. Cavatica, a member of the banned.
I saved my pig-friend Wilbur from the sausage-maker&#39;s hand.
But I had 500 spiderlets without a wedding band,
So one school&#39;s PTA made sure that CHARLOTTE&#39;S WEB was banned.

My name is Robin Hood, and I have got a merry band.
The tales of our adventures are acclaimed in every land.
But I rob the rich to feed the poor -- a blatant Commie plan.
So one girl&#39;s mother told her daughter&#39;s school I should be banned.

My name is Anna Frank, and I&#39;m a member of the banned.
I had to hide in secret from the Fuhrer&#39;s harsh command.
But my diary&#39;s a &quot;downer,&quot; and my talk of sex is cand-
Id, so THE DIARY OF ANNA FRANK is often banned.

THE ORIGIN OF SPECIES is a member of the banned,
Though scientists agree that Darwin&#39;s view of life is grand.
&quot;It contradicts the Bible!&quot; and &quot;Biologists are damned!&quot;
So say the fundamentalists who fight to keep it banned. <b>(Janet Sherman)</b>

My name is Judy Blume, and I&#39;m a member of the banned.
My fanmail comes in tons from kids who say I understand.
The books I write for teenagers are never safe and bland,
So frightened angry parents do their best to have me banned. <b>(Roberta Rogow)</b>

My name is Geoffrey Chaucer, I&#39;m condemne&#39;d out of hand,
For 20th-century mores which I fail to understand.
The Miller kissed the lady&#39;s arse -- should he have kissed her hand?
For then perhaps my CANTERBURY TALES would not be banned! <b>(Nigel Parsons)</b>

We are the Brothers Grimm, and we are members of the banned,
We went collecting fairy tales around the Fatherland.
But our ogres are too hideous and our heroines are too bland,
So critics on both right and left insist that we be banned! <b>(Roberta Rogow)</b>

I&#39;m Oz the Great and Terrible, a member of the banned.
A little girl from Kansas travelled through my magic land.
The witches of the North and South are good, and lend a hand,
And that&#39;s against Leviticus, so Baum&#39;s away! It&#39;s banned.

My name is John, Lord Greystoke, I&#39;m a member of the banned.
I wed my Jane in private ceremony in England.
But folks who haven&#39;t read the book believe our love is scand-
Alous, and that&#39;s why they insist that TARZAN OF THE APES be banned! <b>(Tom Hubbard)</b>

My name is Harry Potter, I&#39;m a member of the banned.
They say that I&#39;m Satanic &#39;cos I&#39;ve got a wand in hand.
They&#39;re just a bunch of Muggles, and they do not understand
The only magic that I make is fiction that is grand! <b>(Lee Gold)</b>

My name is Winston Smith, and I&#39;m a member of the banned,
Rewriting history each day by government command.
Too many countries think rebooting people would be grand -
So that&#39;s why <u>1984</u> is added to the banned. <b>(Bill Laubenheimer)</b>

I&#39;m a lawyer name of Atticus, a member of the banned.
My Southern town despised me for defending a black man.
I showed their racist hearts - but my little girl said &quot;Damn,&quot;
That&#39;s why they say our tale TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD gets banned!
<b>(Tom Hubbard, ed. Jane Mailander)</b>

My name is little Tango, I&#39;m a member of the banned.
My picture book is dangerous, they say, in children&#39;s hands!
My daddies hatched my borrowed egg, their family to expand.
And why our love is bad this penguin does not understand!

My name it is Melinda. I&#39;m a member of the banned.
I refused to keep my mouth shut when my boyfriend forced his hand.
But date rape is &quot;pornography,&quot; some preacher folks demand.
Well, I will not stay silent &ndash; I will <u>Speak</u>, let them be damned!

We are the Tolkien Fellowship, and had a mission grand -
To cast the Ring into the Fire by Council&#39;s firm command.
&quot;The story&#39;s anti-Christian!&quot; say those who don&#39;t understand,
And cast our books into the pyre just like a golden band.<b> (hardboiledbaby)&nbsp; - NEW</b>

<u id=""yui_3_16_0_1_1445060216421_14458"">The Grapes of Wrath</u> is yet another member of the banned.
The Joads, they sought a better life by driving &#39;cross this land.
The bleakness of their lives denied, dismissed as propagand-
a, but some truths won&#39;t be silenced just like some books won&#39;t stay banned!<b> (only_po) - NEW</b>

I&#39;m Huckleberry Finn, and I&#39;m the LEADER of the banned!
A target for the censors since the century began.
It&#39;s never the same reason; it&#39;s at different folks&#39; demand.
The river ain&#39;t my problem -- it&#39;s the fear of being banned!

It&#39;s the last week of September, when we honor all the banned--
The books that disappear from shelves and schools like shifting sand.
So fight them in the school boards -- watch your OWN well-meaning hand!
For no books are as dangerous as the folks who get them banned!

<b>Author: </b>gardnerhill
<b>Fandom: </b>Sherlock Holmes (&ldquo;Study in Crimson&rdquo; AU)
<b>Word Count: </b>2561
<b>Rating: PG-13 </b>(gore, violence)
<b>Warning: </b>Piratey violence, blood, nasty crap.
<b>Summary: </b>There is more than one way to talk like a pirate.
<b>Author&#39;s Notes: </b>For September 19, aka International Talk Like a Pirate Day &ndash; the prompt that started it all.

<lj-cut text=""Pipe the lubbers aboard!  (Warning: Thar be dragons ahead.)"">
Captain Charles Milverton ran the <i>Wasp</i> with the same merciless hand he had used on his first ship. Gold flowed onto the deck &ndash; for their patron and the captain only. The officers got a tiny portion, and the crew scuffled with each other over the slops. Milverton was a valuable asset to the <i>Spider&rsquo;s</i> master, with an uncanny ability to gauge how much could be fetched for each of his captives held for ransom.

But if Milverton ran his operations with a pirate&rsquo;s ruthlessness and eye for treasure, he still treated his crew with the brutal authority of a Navy captain. The <i>Wasp</i> was the worst of both worlds &ndash; the crew plundered like pirates and kept none of the goods, were worked to exhaustion like Navy men with none of the freedom enjoyed by their fellow Brethren of the Coast. Petitions to the captain, a right aboard pirate ships, were punished like Naval insubordination; there would be no voting this captain out of his seat as on other privateer vessels.

Above all things Milverton tolerated no loose talk aboard &ndash; keeping a tighter grip than even his days aboard the lost <i>Octavius</i>. Insubordination by so much as a sullen look was a flogging offense; Milverton&rsquo;s men were constantly busy holystoning the blood out of the deck. Sailors had to go ashore for water and provisions but they were not to talk when they came back save to take orders.

So it was that no one whispered the rumours that Milverton had set powder to his own ship, the <i>Octavius</i>, killing good sailing men, to snare one man in a trap. Nor that he had been given the <i>Wasp</i> by Moriarty as a reward for his treachery. Nor that the man he&rsquo;d snared had been recaptured by his own captain in a daring rescue and they now hunted down the crew of that lost ship to exact revenge for that work.

No word aboard the <i>Wasp</i> that was not for ship&rsquo;s business. Not a spoken word.

One fellow came back from duties ashore in Trinidad with supplies, and a lump of chalk for marking depths.

Not long afterward the slow, stupid cabin boy was whipped, howling that he ain&rsquo;t done nuffin, when Milverton saw the scrawled dancing stick figures on the mast in chalk. The crew silently watched the punishment, having seen the dancing men themselves before being ordered to wash them off.

They gestured to each other as they called ship&rsquo;s orders &ndash; each gesture a word, a thought, an understood message.

The captain&rsquo;s grip was inexorable, unbreakable. The rope was stretched taut as a spider-line.

***

&ldquo;Ship, Mr. Atherton?&rdquo; Milverton called up at the lookout.

&ldquo;The <i>Sainte Marie</i>, Cap&rsquo;n.&rdquo;

Milverton looked forward. &ldquo;Ah, excellent.&rdquo; His intelligence from Moriarty had let him know that aboard that merchant ship would be a French <i>comtesse</i> travelling to her plantation in Trinidad; she might as well be covered in jewels for the ransom she would fetch. With any luck her retinue would include a number of valuable names for a few more hundreds in gold. Two-thirds to Moriarty, and a third to him, save a few coins. Aboard also would be sailors for his silent, sullen crew to cut down, and possibly even servant-girls for them to spend their rage; it would make them less dangerous.

The lookout and the first mate held eyes as the lookout tugged his pigtail, touched his ear and then his hand, and clenched his fist. The mate waggled his hand back and forth. &ldquo;Wind&rsquo;s good, Captain,&rdquo; he said at Milverton&rsquo;s glare. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be upon them within the hour.&rdquo;

&ldquo;To the guns,&rdquo; Milverton said. Any ship carrying aristocracy, especially female aristocracy, needed only a shot across the bow to make them surrender. Cowards were such lucrative creatures. &ldquo;Line the deck, armed all, now!&rdquo;

The men got their pistols and swords &ndash; hands tugging at pigtails, touching ear-and-hand, clenching fists, drawing hands across throats, as they took up arms.

&ldquo;Run the flag.&rdquo;

Up went the black banner, featuring crossed red-dripping swords over a bag of gold &ndash; the sign of Milverton the ransom-taker. Another sure way to make them surrender without a fight. Most wealthy people carried Letters of Ransom with them for just such eventualities in travelling the South Seas, and knew they&rsquo;d be kept alive as captives of a ransomer.

&ldquo;Up sails! To the oars!&rdquo;

The <i>Wasp</i> swept upon the <i>Sainte Marie</i>.

&ldquo;Fire!&rdquo;

BOOM! One across the bowsprit. Shouts and a scream aboard the French merchanter.

The Wasps stared at the handful of musket-armed guards in French uniform aboard the merchanter, surrounding the slim black-shrouded figure. Ah yes, the Countess was a recent widow, which explained her move to the colonies. No doubt debt and <i>le Comte&rsquo;s</i> greedy relatives had taken the house and lands in England. And soon the <i>Spider</i> and the <i>Wasp</i> would feed from her as well.


&ldquo;<i>Arr&ecirc;t</i><i>!</i> <i>N</i><i>ous sommes le corsaire</i> Wasp!&rdquo; bellowed the lookout. &ldquo;<i>Reddition sans combat et vous vivrez</i><i>!&rdquo; </i>(Halt! We are the privateer Wasp! Surrender without a fight and you live!)

The <i>Sainte Marie</i> lowered her flag and dropped anchor. The guards dropped their muskets and put up their hands. The <i>Wasp</i> pulled alongside, grappling hooks flying, as its own anchor dropped.

&ldquo;Running boards.&rdquo; Milverton beamed at his treasure chest in black. He knew how to handle valuable merchandise; there was a protocol to this sort of thing and these sort of people. &ldquo;Mr. Atherton, Peaky, with me.&rdquo;

The three men strode across to the <i>Sainte Marie, </i>pistols out; every gun on the <i>Wasp</i> was trained on the merchanter crew and the bodyguards. Hm. Crewmen and bodyguards so far; no doubt her retinue were below, terrified. The guards stood off, apprehension on their faces, as he approached their charge.

&ldquo;<i>Capitaine, un peu </i><i>mis&eacute;ricorde, s&rsquo;il vous plait,</i>&rdquo; the black-veiled woman pleaded, her voice light and pleasant. &ldquo;Captain, if you please, mercy, a little.&rdquo; Her English was good if French-accented.

&ldquo;Now now, <i>mon cher</i>, this is precisely why you travel <i>avec </i><i>un lettre </i><i>de ran&ccedil;on</i>,&rdquo; Milverton said pleasantly, his pistol trained on her as he reminded her of her Letter of Ransom. &ldquo;Do be sensible and come with me of your own accord, <i>Madame Comtesse,</i> and I won&rsquo;t bind you like a vulgar prisoner.&rdquo;

The veiled woman nodded. &ldquo;<i>Oui, Capitaine </i>Milverton.&rdquo; And pulled off her veil.

Not a woman. Slim, black-skinned, eyes like banked coals that burned with hatred. Eyes he knew.

&ldquo;Octavius <i>cochon</i>!&rdquo; Jun the cabin-boy spat, and drove the kitchen knife in his hand into Milverton&rsquo;s belly even as the two other men were overwhelmed by guards and dragged to the deck.

Men boiled out of the hold, all armed with muskets, and the shouting Wasp men faced an equal number of muzzles pointed in their direction.

The Wasp-men froze at their posts, shocked into stillness by the unexpectedness and speed of the attack &ndash; and that momentary hesitation to come to Milverton&rsquo;s aid as would a loyal crew had made all the difference. Milverton &ndash; who now bubbled and bled on the deck of the <i>Sainte Marie</i>.

The &ldquo;Comptesse&rdquo; would have fallen on the dying man, kitchen knife poised to do more damage, if one of the guards had not put a hand on Jun&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;No more, lad. You have struck your one blow. It&rsquo;s over.&rdquo;

The lean whip of a lad nodded, and spat once on the writhing man. &ldquo;<i>C&rsquo;est moi, Jun. Je suis</i> Baker!&rdquo;

Straightening, the guardsman looked at the shocked and still men on the <i>Wasp</i>. Peaky and Atherton were on their knees, disarmed and held by the Bakers who had best fit the uniforms.

Facing the row of men on the other ship, the guard pointed to himself, then tugged at his bound tail of hair.

(I am Captain Shear-Lock.)

One open palmed hand, waggled back then front then back again, then circled in a great O.

(I sought revenge against the <i>Octavius</i>.)

The hand clenched into a fist.

(I set a trap.)

Shear-Lock pointed both forefingers like pistols at the Wasps, then pointed both down.
The <i>Wasp</i> men obeyed, and dropped their weapons.

Smiling a little, Captain Shear-Lock touched his ear then his hand, and turned his head.

One-hand Jack &ndash; his ship&rsquo;s surgeon, quartermaster, and deadliest shot &ndash; was standing at his side, also facing the Wasps. Jack held up his bonesaw he had instead of a left hand, the wooden base gleaming with the gold leaf that had made his name a terror in every port. The Wasps crossed themselves, whispering the name &ndash; or touching ear then hand: &ldquo;Gold-Hand,&rdquo; &ldquo;Gold-Hand!&rdquo;

&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Shear-Lock called, his voice now reaching from one end of the Wasp to the other. &ldquo;No doubt some of you knew that I had been looking for your master. I perceive not only from your appearances and your use of dumb-sign but from my observation of the <i>Baker</i>&rsquo;s newest crewmember that your service under the late Captain Milverton was hellish. Since he was the only member of the <i>Octavius</i> aboard the <i>Wasp</i>, his is the only life I wish taken today.&rdquo; 

Jack spoke up &ndash; and the voice of the avenger Gold-Hand was the pleasant tone of a doctor asking where the pain lies. &ldquo;Who among you is an accomplished commander?&rdquo;

The two men held on the Sainte Marie looked at each other. &ldquo;First Mate Atherton, sir,&rdquo; the one said.

&ldquo;Captain Atherton, you mean,&rdquo; Shear-Lock said as courteously as at any parley. &ldquo;For while Milverton yet lives, his wound is indeed mortal and he is quite unable to command.&rdquo; A loud moan of pain from the man on the deck. &ldquo;Mr. Gregson, if you would be so good as to help up Captain Atherton and this gentleman?&rdquo;

The <i>Wasp</i> officers rose. Not ten minutes had passed since they&rsquo;d boarded the ship with their dying captain.

Shear-Lock took Atherton&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;Captain, I strongly recommend that you employ the easier ways of the Brethren with your crew than the Naval tyranny of your predecessor. Beaten and starved men afraid of the lash will indeed do as you order &ndash; but may leave you to die like a dog at the very moment speed is needed.&rdquo; The pleasant smile dropped from Shear-Lock&rsquo;s face as he gave one contemptuous look at the moaning wretch.

A well-fed, well-treated and well-paid body of men,&rdquo; added One-Hand Jack, with a wry smile at his missing limb, &ldquo;will sail into Hell and drag you out again.&rdquo;

The Wasp crew were still and silent. But when Shear-Lock strode over to the twisting Milverton, bent down and pulled off his small brown wig, hoisting it aloft like a London-Tower axeman presenting the head of a traitor, a cheer rocked the <i>Wasp</i> from bow to stern.

&ldquo;You have a ship to command, Captain.&rdquo; Shear-Lock smiled. &ldquo;And no doubt a hoard in the old captain&rsquo;s cabin to dole out to the labourers with a freer hand.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Captain Shear-Lock,&rdquo; Atherton said.

&ldquo;Cap&rsquo;n.&rdquo; It was Gregson, standing before Shear-Lock. He said no other word.

Shear-Lock looked the bosn&rsquo;s mate top to bottom. He nodded. &ldquo;Go. You are a <i>Wasp</i> now.&rdquo; He turned to the armed men on the Sainte Marie. &ldquo;Are there any other Bakers who wish to take quarters in a ship that will be safer from Moriarty for now?&rdquo;

Two or three Bakers stepped forward; Dix, Black Rat, Matew. Shear-Lock nodded. &ldquo;Gunners and gunner&rsquo;s mate. You will have a livelier time on another ship &ndash; more firing and less hiding. Go.&rdquo;

One-hand Jack shook his head ruefully as the new Wasps followed the new captain back aboard the ship; but he laughed with Shear-Lock when five or six Wasps crossed to board the <i>Sainte Marie </i>and become new Bakers. Atherton was about to shout them back, but held his tongue. A pirate came and went at his liberty, and it was up to the captain to prove himself to the crew, not the other way round.

The ships ungrappled and the Wasp stayed in place as the <i>Sainte Marie</i> weighed anchor. &ldquo;And now back to Tobago so that the <i>Comptesse</i> may have her transport back &ndash; less half its hold,&rdquo; Shear-Lock said; Hopkins took the wheel. &ldquo;I do however fear that Gregson and the others will have a terrible head tomorrow from the men tearing into the grog and rations store. So Milverton is no more, Moriarty has lost his most reliable source of income, and we have recrewed and refinanced the ship. A splendid night&rsquo;s work.&rdquo;

Hopkins laughed. &ldquo;If l&rsquo;Estrade&rsquo;s made off with the <i>Baker</i> while it&rsquo;s moored in Tobago you won&rsquo;t be as happy about it, Cap&rsquo;n.&rdquo;

&ldquo;If l&rsquo;Estrade can get around Angel he&rsquo;ll deserve the <i>Baker</i>,&rdquo; the captain replied serenely to his first mate.

***

Pain. Utter agony that wormed through him like fire in the veins. Murdered by a goddamn slave-boy &ndash; he should have beaten that vicious little black rat to death on the <i>Octavius</i> when he&rsquo;d had a chance.

He opened his eyes, trying to stave off the encroaching darkness even as every inch of his flesh shrieked for death to end this Hell.

Level blue eyes over a bleached-gold moustache and a set mouth. A bonesaw in a hilt of gold for a left hand. The cargo for whom he&rsquo;d touched match to powder keg and destroyed the <i>Octavius</i>, and whom he&rsquo;d handed over to Moriarty.

Brown eyes in a black face. A grin. The brat had filled out aboard the Baker; he was no longer a scrawny skeleton. Shear-Lock wasted good food on a slave&hellip;had fed and tamed him, and given his arm strength enough to strike back. Fool. Not long before that knife was in Shear-Lock&rsquo;s back, the fool. The cat-o-nine, the grog-can. That was how a ship was run. God&rsquo;s eyes, that monster Jun was sitting next to Dr. Jack on the deck, watching him die and enjoying his pain.

Jack. He was a doctor, it was why he&rsquo;d come to the aid of the destroyed <i>Octavius</i>, soft-hearted enough to come and be captured. Milverton knew why he was here.

&ldquo;Kill me,&rdquo; he whispered &ndash; anything louder would turn into a shriek of pain. &ldquo;Dr. Jack. Kill me. It&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;re here. End this.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Funny thing, pain,&rdquo; Jack said, tilting his bonesaw back and forth to make sunlight flicker off the polished blade. &ldquo;So little time and it seems to last forever.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Kill me. Please.&rdquo;

The eyes were the blue of a flame&rsquo;s core. &ldquo;Where does Moriarty transact his business with you?&rdquo;

Nothing. He&rsquo;d say nothing oh GOD THE PAIN. Nothing would come out of his mouth except the blood-trickle getting larger and fouler.

Flicker. Flicker. &ldquo;He has played us all like Punch and Judy. Shear-Lock will end this for all. All will be avenged.&rdquo; Jack met his eyes. &ldquo;If you lie to me I&rsquo;ll go below and leave Jun here to tend you. He has several years of your floggings and starvation to repay.&rdquo;

Jun winked at Milverton and held up his gory galley-blade.

Louder than the pain, fear sheeted through him like an Arctic storm. Not that. Oh God in heaven. Not that.

Jack made as if to stand up. &ldquo;Where does Mor-&ldquo;

&ldquo;La Marche! La Marche Bay near Les Cayes! Haiti! Haiti! Haiti!&rdquo; The last a long ululating scream.

Jack nodded once. &ldquo;Watch closely, Jun. The carotid artery lies just under the left ear, so. One good stroke, and &ndash;&ldquo;

And the reign of Captain Milverton ended in the blur of a gold hand.

<b>Author&rsquo;s Further Notes:</b> Because my poll resulted in a 4-way tie, I went back to the emails and/or Tumblr responses and added everyone&rsquo;s second choices as an option.

<lj-cut text=""Story below the cut."">
Heinz did not look up from the diamond he was setting as the latest customer came into Bram&rsquo;s Jewelers. Since it was old Mr. Abramowicz&rsquo; shop, it was his privilege to greet the customers and direct them to Heinz or one of his own two sons &ndash; he himself only did select jobs these days for the very best customers.

Bent over his work, his back partially turned from the door, Heinz nevertheless did not need to look up to learn much about the woman (for it was a woman from the step). Not used to being in this quarter. Someone new, for he didn&rsquo;t recognise the sound of her shoes on the shop floor. She was by herself &ndash; no one, man nor woman, walked in with her. And her long pause after Mr. Abramowicz&rsquo; greeting let him know that she would ask for him by name.

&ldquo;Welcome, madam. May I help you?&rdquo;

&ldquo;I am &hellip; looking for someone who works here, called Heinz?&rdquo;

A young-to-30s woman. Gentile. Nervous. Her first time selling jewelry out from under her husband.

&ldquo;Mr. Sokolof!&rdquo; Mr. Abramowicz&rsquo; voice carried the pitch of authority he had earned after nearly fifty years in the business, but in a pleasant direct tone that would not startle a craftsman doing delicate work. &ldquo;You have a customer.&rdquo;

Heinz nodded. &ldquo;Excuse me, madam, for two minutes more, and then I am wholly yours.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Thank&nbsp; you, Mr&hellip;Sokolof.&rdquo; She got his name right the first time. A Gentile with respect.

&ldquo;Perhaps the lady would like a nice glass of tea while she waits.&rdquo; Mr. Abramowicz settled the young lady with his usual fatherly charm. Heinz took his usual care with his setting, and not until the gem was in its precise place did he lock away the work to deal with his new client.

The young lady was seated near the alcove where gems could be appraised free of prying eyes. He shook her hand and ushered her into the alcove, drawing the thick curtain to give them privacy for business.

&ldquo;Mr. Heinz Sokolof,&rdquo; the young lady said. She sounded more sure. She was determined to sell the pieces. Perhaps her husband drank or gambled, or she wished money with which to buy a divorce. &ldquo;I was given your name by a previous client. She said to mention that The Jersey Rose sent me.&rdquo;

His first reassuring comment to her stopped in his mouth before it ever left. He closed it, his heart pounding. <i>Irene Adler!</i> The goddess of the opera stage, whose Maddalena had never been equaled (Avram and he had gripped each other&rsquo;s hands during her solo, and that was when he <i>knew</i>) who&rsquo;d broken a million hearts when she retired, and had simply fallen off the face of the earth &ndash; <i>she</i> had sent this lady?

He caught his breath. &ldquo;Excuse me, please. Yes, I do know of that person.&rdquo; And if the Jersey Rose sent this girl, then the gems had just a touch of disrepute. The lady was a friend, and Irene did not want her to be robbed by going to some other <i>momser</i> who&rsquo;d take advantage of her plight by charging <i>ganef&rsquo;s</i> prices for the pieces. &ldquo;It is a great pleasure to do business with the friend of such a friend. How may I help you today?&rdquo;

She smiled. A pretty girl, for those who noticed such things, and there was no guile in her face. &ldquo;I have some jewelry to be appraised, and sold for me, Mr. Sokolof. They are very old pieces, and foreign. My father was stationed in India when I was a girl.&rdquo;

Heinz nodded. So, no ownership history in this country. Possibly the result of robbery overseas, or an English soldier stuffing his pockets while visiting some maharajah&rsquo;s palace. It happened. &ldquo;For this work &ndash; appraising and selling &ndash; the cost is one hundred pounds up front, or one percent of the value of the commission.&rdquo; Most clients took the 1%, and frankly it was cheaper for all concerned, especially when they found that the old bracelet or rings weren&rsquo;t as valuable as they thought.

She nodded. &ldquo;So our mutual friend has said.&rdquo; She pulled up her purse and undid the strings. Smart girl &ndash; wore a nice simple dress that didn&rsquo;t shout &ldquo;money&rdquo; to come to this street with this weight in her pocket, and she wore no jewelry besides her wedding ring &ndash; a small plain band but well-made, her husband was not a wealthy or extravagant man but was not cheap either&hellip; She pulled out and carefully laid ten ten-quid notes on the table. She shook her head and laughed a little. &ldquo;So much money in one place! I felt like a duchess walking through the streets with this in my purse.&rdquo;

The full hundred pounds, up front? This meant the pieces were either very good, or looked very good. But business was business. The nature of these transactions meant that no receipts changed hands and no paper trail could incriminate either end of this deal. If she wanted her lost money back, she&rsquo;d have to admit to this deed. And her words meant she was not from money herself. The jewelry very likely had come as a surprise to her.

He took the notes and stowed them in his own pocketbook. &ldquo;Very well. May I see your items?&rdquo;

She reached into her purse again for a lump tied in a handkerchief. She undid the slightly grubby knots (mud, was it? Silty stuff, not road garbage &ndash; the sort of mud one found by the banks of &hellip;.

And Heinz Sokolof stared as a cascade of gold and brilliance and red poured into his hands.

For a moment he merely looked at an artist&rsquo;s pride, rubies and diamonds in beautifully-worked beaten gold. Then his professionalism came back and he removed his loupe from its case to examine the necklace in detail.

Fine silt in the settings and creases, more of that story there. Rubies lozenge-cut, a few imperfections but nothing to ruin the piece. Diamonds round brilliant, none less than a carat each. Clean out the mud and a princess could wear this as one of her better pieces. The metal was solid gold, again fashioned with an artist&rsquo;s care.

He removed his jeweller&rsquo;s loupe, only then registering the other pieces &ndash; a handsome gold man&rsquo;s ring with a square-cut emerald, a silver bracelet with three pearls, a gold brooch in the shape of an elephant.

A hundred quid? She&rsquo;d gotten a bloody bargain.

He examined the others with the same attention to detail. &ldquo;You will not gain full market value for these pieces, Madam.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Oh yes, I quite expected that.&rdquo;

His fingers paused a split-second over his abacus before they resumed their work. &ldquo;I do not cheat my customers, Madam.&rdquo; He made his words as coldly polite as he could.

Distress from her voice &ndash; and that tone alone let him know it had not been a jibe at his faith. &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m <u>so</u> sorry! I only meant that I know there will be a loss because of how we&rsquo;re doing this. And it does <u>not</u> concern me in the least. Please forgive me, Mr. Sokolof.&rdquo;

&ldquo;I do so.&rdquo; He resumed the clicking of the numbers, tallying everything she had brought. &ldquo;The full market value of everything here is &pound;18,350. I can sell these whole or piecemeal.&rdquo;

She stroked her chin and fingered her lips, eyes lowered in thought. &ldquo;Your own choice, I think. If it would be easier to sell the necklace as separate gems that would be up to you.&rdquo; She gave no indication that she&#39;d just been told of a sum that would suit a peer.

Break that beautiful work of art? &ldquo;Whole, I think &ndash; I know one or two who might wish this one, for the right price.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Then the only other caveat is the bracelet &ndash; I wish to keep the three pearls and sell only the silver.&rdquo;

More calculating &ndash; cleaning, notifying, auction fees &ndash; while he ran through his clients in his mind. &ldquo;I believe I can get you at least &pound;13,000 for the lot.&rdquo; He found himself holding the ring in both hands, admiring the weight and craftsmanship of it.

Her voice was warm. &ldquo;I do not mind if that sum is a little lower, Mr. Sokolof. If you would like to keep that ring.&rdquo;

His head shot up. He&rsquo;d just been thinking of how lovely a ring like this would look on Avram&rsquo;s hand, a fitting gift from his jeweler lover &ndash; the ring he wanted to give him, since no <i>huppah </i>would cover their union nor rabbi bless them. But business was business. &ldquo;Madam, this is a valuable ring. Your generosity is very much appreciated, but&ndash;&rdquo;

She held up a hand to stay his words, and smiled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you a secret, Mr. Heinz Sokolof. This jewelry is actually rightfully mine. And I am scattering it to the four corners of the earth &ndash; which is what I intend to do with the money when you are done with this commission, and any other commissions in the future.&rdquo; She pursed her lips in another repressed laugh. &ldquo;Think of the ring as &hellip; a Christian&rsquo;s apology for clumsy words.&rdquo;

He pressed his own lips to keep back his own laughter, and the thought of Avram&rsquo;s delighted look added joy to his own reply. &ldquo;Then apology accepted, Madam!&rdquo;

***

&ldquo;Our last transaction, I&rsquo;m afraid, Heinz.&rdquo; Madam sat at the alcove table and handed over his hundred pounds.

&ldquo;Ah, the last of the mysterious treasure is it?&rdquo; Heinz felt a pang as he set the samovar on to heat. He would miss this thrilling little chapter in his life. Not to mention the nice little nest egg he&rsquo;d made of Madam&rsquo;s fees for Avram and himself.

&ldquo;Even so. But it&rsquo;s all found good homes, and the money will make a lot of people happier than they were.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Including yourself.&rdquo;

Her eyes sparkled brighter than diamonds. She was really a very pretty woman; he hoped her husband appreciated her. &ldquo;I have had a wonderful time doing this. Like yourself, I find the work its own reward.&rdquo;

He laughed with her. While some of his fellows became tantalized by the vast wealth under their fingers, or felt the gnawing hunger of avarice or envy &ndash; toiling over thousands of pounds&rsquo; worth of wealthy clients&rsquo; gems only to go home to bread and herrings &ndash; for Heinz the jewel he treasured most was his work. A perfectly-cut diamond, a flawless sapphire in its best setting, a row of identical rubies or emeralds in a diadem that made a plain woman beautiful when she wore it &ndash; all these were his pride and joy. And she understood that.

He got out his loupe. &ldquo;Any further word from our mutual friend?&rdquo;

&ldquo;A thank you for those five splendid diamonds you cleaned for us.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Only the best for Miss Irene Adler. She knows they are from me as well? And Avram?&rdquo;

In response Madam held up a pair of perfect red roses. &ldquo;She instructed me to buy these for you and your friend.&rdquo;

He blinked his stinging eyes hard at this gift from his idol. He could die happy now.

This time, a few muddy cabochons, twenty pounds each; an anticlimactic end to the treasures that had come by ones and twos to this alcove for nearly half a year.

He took the gems and pushed back her &pound;100. &ldquo;One pound for this &ndash; a 1% appraisal.&rdquo;

She stared at the money as if only now realizing how much it was. &ldquo;But what do I &ndash;&ldquo;

&ldquo;Keep it.&rdquo; He grinned. &ldquo;Let this be <i>your</i> share of the treasure!&rdquo;

And they ended their business association with a laugh and a glass of tea.

<b>Summary: </b>These are the days of miracle and wonder.
<b>Author&#39;s Notes: </b>For the July 2015 Watson&#39;s Woes Promptfest Amnesty Prompt #10<i>, <b>Memory Lane</b>. Let this entry be about what came before:&nbsp; anything that happened in the past, something from childhood, a prequel, or even about the side characters prior to a case.</i>

<lj-cut text=""Essay below the cut."">
It&rsquo;s weird to think that I&rsquo;ve been a fan of Sherlock Holmes since before Benedict Cumberbatch was <i>born</i>. But it&rsquo;s even weirder to realize that my 92-year-old dad &ndash; a bit teetery these days but still upright &ndash; was reading Sherlock Holmes before Arthur Conan Doyle DIED. He went to the Basil Rathbone films when they were first in the theaters. He&rsquo;s probably the reason there were Sherlock Holmes books represented in the library that was our house.
 
I wasn&rsquo;t born with a deerstalker on, of course. It was a gradual process.
 
Up until 1972 my knowledge consisted of knowing about that guy with the pipe and the magnifying glass and the funny hat, and the idiot sidekick, and recognizing the silhouette.
 
In 1972 one of the stories in my fifth-grade reader included &ldquo;The Red-Headed League&rdquo; and I realized just how well these were written, how smart Holmes was, and what a clever idea for a crime. I may have read one or two other stories after that.
 
But my watershed year was 1977 &ndash; when I read <i>The Seven Percent Solution</i> by Nicholas Meyer (and thought it was one of the original Sherlock Holmes stories) &ndash; and my overall reaction was &ldquo;&hellip; Oh my <u>God</u>. These two men love each other so much.&rdquo; It was <i>Seven Percent Solution</i> that changed me from someone who knew about Sherlock Holmes to a Sherlockian. (Much later, I&rsquo;m embarrassed to say, I finally figured out that it was a new story written by a contemporary &ndash; but how appropriate that fanfiction was what brought me to Baker Street for good and all!) The movie made at that time also had one of the best (and sexiest) Watsons ever put on screen &ndash; Robert Duvall &ndash; a film that made me realize that I liked and admired Holmes, but &ndash; like Holmes &ndash; I adored Watson.
 
(How appropriate that Nicholas Meyer, who came up with an alternative explanation for Holmes&rsquo; &ldquo;death&rdquo; and disappearance in <i>Solution</i>, directed the Star Trek film in which Spock &ldquo;died&rdquo; &ndash; <i>Wrath of Khan</i>. Especially as it&rsquo;s now ST Canon that one of Spock&rsquo;s human ancestors was indeed Sherlock Holmes.)
 
One very indelible signpost in my fandom progress was the summer in 1978 when my family camped in the Olympic Peninsula in Washington State, a dark and damp rain-forest &ndash; which was the time and the place where my 15-year-old self read <i>Hound of the Baskervilles</i> for the first time.
 
Then came 1981, and Granada and Jeremy Brett and David (sigh) Burke and <i>A Scandal in Bohemia</i>, and I was lost. I remember how I devoured those episodes in the days when Vincent Price hosted PBS Mystery, before he voiced the villainous <strike>Moriarty</strike> Ratigan for Disney&rsquo;s <i>Great Mouse Detective</i>. Most especially I remember the agony of waiting, one year to the next, 1982 to 1983 to 1984, for the next 6-episode installment. I was heartbroken when David Burke left after <i>Final Problem</i> and was firmly resolved to dislike his replacement; but Edward Hardwicke won me over with a spectacular faint in <i>Empty House</i>, and I grew to love the magnificent chemistry between Brett and Hardwicke for the rest of the series. (I was in England in 1995 when Jeremy Brett died; I visited Sir Arthur&rsquo;s grave in Minstead two days later, and two days after that I huddled with other mourning tourists outside 221b Baker Street in London like a shiva call.)
 
Other versions cropped up about this time too &ndash; the Russian films, the BBC Radio dramatization of the complete canon, Spielberg&rsquo;s <i>Young Sherlock Holmes</i>, Disney&rsquo;s <i>Great Mouse Detective, </i>the genderswapped modern-punk graphic novel <i>Baker Street.</i> These were also the days before the Internet, however, so there was very little about any of these &ndash; since paper-zine making was expensive and fans really couldn&rsquo;t afford to publish a lot of fanfic from small-fandom sources. (&ldquo;We wrote our stories on stone tablets and had to hand-carry them if others wanted to read them&hellip;&rdquo;)
 
There was a little Holmes fanfiction in the 1990s, based on Granada &ndash; additions to multi-fandom zines, a very few dedicated zines &ndash; but often it was derided because of &ldquo;those two ugly old guys&rdquo; (one fan&rsquo;s response to a request to contribute to a zine).
 
And then I watched two fandom-bombs that hit this latest generation of Sherlock Holmes fans within a year of each other -&nbsp; Guy Ritchie&rsquo;s December 2009 film and <i>Sherlock</i> debuting on BBC in 2010 (and on PBS Mystery in 2011). Ritchie&rsquo;s casting choice of Jude Law for Watson did a lot to re-program the general public&rsquo;s view of Watson away from Nigel Bruce&rsquo;s indelible bumbling elderly comic relief that had so degraded Watson&#39;s image that the venerable British magazine <i>Punch</i> ran a poem lamenting Watson&#39;s buffooning. And BBC&rsquo;s offering not only brought Sherlock Holmes into the world of Starbucks and cellphones (i.e., modern London) but turned Benedict Cumberbatch into this generation&rsquo;s Basil Rathbone (and the prior generation&rsquo;s William Gillette).
 
And now?
 
These days we live amid an embarrassment of riches. The modernization of Holmes has always been a thing &ndash; Basil Rathbone&rsquo;s Sherlock Holmes fought Nazis and drove 1930s roadsters &ndash; and versions like network TV&rsquo;s <i>House </i>and <i>Elementary,</i> the comic book <i>Watson and Holmes, </i>and the web series<i> S(her)lock </i> continue to rewrite how the stories are told and how the characters are portrayed. Cumberbatch&rsquo;s masterful misanthrope goes back to Brett and Rathbone; Jonny Lee Miller&rsquo;s frail addict echoes Hugh Laurie&rsquo;s House and Nicol Williamson&rsquo;s Holmes in <i>Seven Percent Solution</i>. But the biggest changes have been in how Watson has been reclaimed from the source material; Jude Law&rsquo;s and Martin Freeman&rsquo;s stalwart soldier Watsons are like Robert Duvall&rsquo;s before them &ndash; and Lucy Liu&rsquo;s Watson has ascended not only to become a fellow consulting detective, Sherlock&rsquo;s partner rather than his assistant, but to be a Watson who defeats Moriarty when Holmes cannot.
 
Another movie has just opened (Ian McKellen taking Holmes into his twilight years), and new books and stories spring up like dandelions with no signs of slowing. And those are just the official sources &ndash; fanfiction and fanart online blooms like algae.
 
For an old Sherlock Holmes fan (in both senses of the word, thank you), it&rsquo;s a joy for me to see one of the very oldest fandoms &ndash; a fandom just as obsessed and crazy in the days before my dad was born &ndash; become the latest thing, and to continue to gain new enthusiasts every year.
 
And a fandom which continues to inspire me to exhaust myself every July, writing half a novel&rsquo;s worth of words strictly out of my love for two fictional people in a place in London that never existed.
 
As the Holmes actor Reginald Kincaid (Michael Caine) says to his Doylesque Watson (Ben Kingsley) in <i>Without a Clue</i>: &ldquo;I was once a figment of your imagination. But now Sherlock Holmes belongs to the whole world.&rdquo;

<b>Summary: </b>A rickety stepladder, a weakened and stubborn Army doctor, and a clumsy dog. What could go wrong?
<b>Author&#39;s Notes: </b>For the July 2015 Watson&#39;s Woes Promptfest Amnesty Prompt #9, <b><i>Domestic Hazards</i></b><i>. Research shows that an overwhelming percentage of accident-related injuries happen in the home. 221B is far from an exception.</i> This story takes place during the BBC Radio adaptation of &ldquo;A Study in Scarlet.&rdquo;

<lj-cut text=""Story below the cut."">
Stubborn, pig-headed pride. That&rsquo;s the only deduction one could make &ndash; and the only medical diagnosis.
 
I should have listened to Holmes from that first time when he told me to sit down and rest. He&rsquo;d accurately deduced that I shun the pity of others and despised the frail, treacherous transport my flesh had become.&nbsp; When we moved in that very first day, he was kind enough to turn that shameful moment of near-collapse into an excuse to provide a miniature lecture on the history of his violin (while I sat and caught my breath) followed by examples of how beautifully he could play, from Bach to &ldquo;Buttercup.&rdquo;

I should also have taken note of Holmes&rsquo; hesitation and flat response when I first told him about my bull-pup. It was a harbinger of our time together &ndash; Beecher, the most phlegmatic little chap around me, never gave Holmes a moment&rsquo;s peace, leaping up to worry at his ankles at every opportunity and never ceasing despite all my scolding him.
 
And it all culminated a few weeks into our shared-lodgings arrangements, with me on the top-rung of a none-too-steady stepladder (cajoled from Mrs. Hudson&rsquo;s girl) with an armload of heavy medical volumes to stow on a top shelf when Holmes passed my doorway &ndash; and Beecher, who&rsquo;d been peacefully dozing on my carpet, tore out of my room to attack his Nemesis, crashing into the ladder on the way out.
 
By great good fortune I landed mostly on my bed. But my head got a smart knock against the brass railing, I wrenched my weak leg, and I received a long bruise where the heavy books slammed into my side on the way down. In short, I had been so hell-bent on proving I was no invalid that I turned myself into a true invalid for several days after that.
 
Several things came out of that household calamity:
 
<ol>
<li style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;"">I was no longer permitted to borrow Mrs. Hudson&rsquo;s household equipment without her direct input. (I also made good and sure that the tearful Bridget did not get sacked by her wrathful employer for her role in my idiocy.)</li>
</ol> 
<ol>
<li style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;"" value=""2"">Beecher was out the door &ndash; fortunately, into the arms of my friend Stamford who gave the little fellow a good home that suffered no appearance of his enemy&rsquo;s ankles.</li>
</ol> 
<ol>
<li style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;"" value=""3"">For the immediate future I was not to lift another thing heavier than the novel I was currently reading unless Holmes was present to assist me. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what <u>servants</u> are for, daft man,&rdquo; Mrs. Hudson said sharply. &ldquo;One word to me and I&rsquo;d have had the boy up to do that for you &ndash; and he&rsquo;d have been a good deal lighter on that rickety thing.&rdquo;</li>
</ol> 
<ol>
<li style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;"" value=""4"">I finally learned to let my body recuperate at the rate it chose and not at the rate I wished.</li>
</ol> 
That one has been the hardest one to learn. For while I recovered a good deal of my health in the months that followed, I never truly gained back the robust corpus that had been mine before Maiwand. I am more apt to sicken than Holmes and take longer to recover, and my weaker limbs mean that certain tasks are beyond my ability to handle alone.
 
But I am also a fortunate man, blessed with a friend whose discernment of the unsaid is unrivaled in all of England &ndash; one who was great-hearted enough never to utter any variation of &ldquo;I told you so&rdquo; after my completely foreseeable mishap, one whose assistance is so swift and invisible that I would miss it now were he to stop, and one who has made it clear that any aid he gives me honours rather than burdens him.
 
That led to the best thing that came about after my spill (over which both of us now laugh with affection):

<b>Author&#39;s Notes: </b>For the July 2015 Watson&#39;s Woes Promptfest Amnesty Prompt #8, <b>A Haunted Man</b>. Someone&#39;s trying to frighten Watson. Whether it&#39;s someone trying to make him doubt himself and cleverly leaving little evidence, or just jumping out and saying &quot;Boo!&quot; is up to you - as is why.

<lj-cut text=""Story below the cut."">
That man. I&rsquo;ve seen him before, I know it &ndash; seen him peering at me on Parkhurst Street from the stationery shop, or on the nearby kerb hunched over like an old spider.
 
In the past weeks I&rsquo;ve felt eyes, keen and sharp, following me as I go about my business. Sometimes he looks like an old man, and sometimes he&rsquo;s unseen.
 
I&rsquo;d laugh if I wasn&rsquo;t so terrified. I&rsquo;ve only known that penetrating gaze before from one man. That man is dead now, and would be the last person on Earth to put faith in ghost stories.
 
Has his spirit finally condescended to haunt me in truth? He has haunted me these last years in my mind: <i>I died because of you, because you were brainless enough to trust a patently false message and left me alone in the face of the enemy. </i>But always before I knew that that was my conscience berating me. Now, the eyes and the presence are palpable.
 
Perhaps it is some villain from my prior life. But surely a criminal or his confederates would simply confront me, not watch me. Nothing in my life is worth watching these days; I stand with the other gawkers at the murder scene.
 
Still, maybe he is just an old man. And I am sorry for spilling his books.

The one aspect of my Watson to which I cannot accustom myself is his pawky if not puerile sense of humour.

Once, while we walked the gentle green hills near our Sussex cottage, I lost my footing and sprawled on the ground. When I sat up and spat out chalky dirt and grass blades, Watson shook with merriment.

&ldquo;Forgive me, my dear man,&rdquo; he burbled, &ldquo;but it seems you&rsquo;ve gotten a bit <i>Down in the mouth</i>.&rdquo;

I watched him double over with mirth, and silently resolved that Watson would sleep alone that night. Let <i>him </i>feel down in the mouth."

&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s when I realized that the blood splatter was all wrong!&rdquo; Joan gestured with her wineglass. &ldquo;If he&rsquo;d really killed her with an axe, there should have been a spray along the ceiling from her hair. So she&rsquo;d splashed the blood herself to make it look like she&rsquo;d been murdered, so she could disappear!&rdquo; She took a drink. &ldquo;Besides, there was no residue besides the blood &ndash; no skull fragments, no brain matter or hair.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Ewwww!&rdquo; Madison stuck out her tongue.

&ldquo;Cool,&rdquo; Tanisha said.

Dylan made a face.

Quentin frowned. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;d she get the blood?&rdquo;

&ldquo;Oh, it was cow&rsquo;s blood. She probably got it from a butcher shop.&rdquo;

Taylor looked sad. &ldquo;That poor cow.&rdquo;

Madison nodded. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why Mommy and Daddy say eating meat is bad.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Your parents are right, Madison, from a health perspective. It&rsquo;s actually better for you to eat bugs &ndash; most people in the world do.&rdquo; At the disgusted chorus Joan smiled. &ldquo;How many of you like to eat honey?&rdquo;

All the little hands went up.

&ldquo;Well, honey is made when bees throw up.&rdquo;

***

&ldquo;Joanie?&rdquo;

&ldquo;Emily!&rdquo; Joan turned to greet her host.

Emily smiled &ndash; the tight &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to kill you but there are too many witnesses&rdquo; smile Joan had seen before. &ldquo;Joan, the moms are upset about whatever you&rsquo;re telling the kids. Some are crying, and Dakota just threw away her new Winnie-the-Pooh shirt.&rdquo;

Ah yes, the one with Disney&rsquo;s Pooh face deep in a pot of honey. Joan smiled. &ldquo;Sorry, Em &ndash; I guess I&rsquo;m so used to hanging around cops and crime scenes that I forgot myself.&rdquo;

Emily exhaled. &ldquo;Look, Joan, I know you weren&rsquo;t that thrilled about coming to a 4-year-old&rsquo;s birthday party, but it means a lot to me and the others. And we really appreciated you taking the kids off our hands &ndash; until this happened. Look, just please, stick to reading them a story, all right?&rdquo;

Joan nodded.&nbsp; &ldquo;All right. We were reading a book when I got distracted.&rdquo;

&ldquo;<u>Thank</u> you.&rdquo; Emily left.

Dakota and most of the small partygoers came back into the room.

&ldquo;Sorry, kids. We&rsquo;ll have to go back to the book I was reading to you. Okay?&rdquo;

&ldquo;Sure!&rdquo; Tanisha said.

&ldquo;Right.&rdquo; Joan pulled out the book she&rsquo;d been reading to them, and opened it up to the marked page. &ldquo;Okay, when we left off, Carrie was just getting ready to go to the prom.&rdquo;

<lj-cut text=""Story below the cut."">
&ldquo;Watson, be reasonable!&rdquo;

Watson folded his arms and glared at his partner.

&ldquo;You know I&rsquo;ve been working on a compound at my brother&rsquo;s request &ndash; he specifically asked me to search for something that would reduce weight. He has become rather self-conscious about his girth these days.&rdquo;

Watson tapped one foot.

&ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t have startled me, old man &ndash; it&rsquo;s the only reason that miniscule amount splashed on your hand. And you must admit this is an amazing discovery with far-reaching ramifications for exploration and detailed work &ndash; and <u>does</u> reduce one&rsquo;s weight, even if this isn&rsquo;t the exact result my brother wanted.&rdquo;

Glare. Tap tap tap.

&ldquo;Watson. I <i>swear</i> I will find a counteragent that will return you to your proper state. In the meantime, have you considered that your current situation could prove invaluable as an investigative assistance? In the realm of surveillance alone&hellip;&rdquo;

Watson finally broke the silence with an oath &ndash; which did not sound as formidable in the higher register caused by his current size.

Holmes blinked. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll start working on that now, shall I?&rdquo;

Watson gave one sharp nod. He hopped off the lab table onto the chair arm, then to the seat, and shinnied down the chair leg to stand on the floor at last &ndash; where he could stare his friend in the shoelaces. He gave an about-face and headed across the vast expanse of the carpet to the other tenant of these rooms.

A stout mouse in apron and mob-cap opened at his knock and peered through her spectacles &ndash; and Watson had to remind himself that this was not a giant mouse and this was not a normal-sized door. &ldquo;Oh dear, Mr. Holmes has been playing with his chemistry set again has he?&rdquo; Mrs. Judson called over her shoulder. &ldquo;Mr. Basil! Dr. Dawson! Visitor for you!&rdquo;

Pick a story you wrote in a previous year&#39;s JWP (or if this is your first year, any previous Holmesian story you&#39;ve written, or if you have never written any Holmesian fic before one of the stories/movies/episodes from any Holmes-based canon) and show what happened either just before or just after it.</i> For this story I chose my 2012 entry <a href=""http://gardnerhill.livejournal.com/83693.html"">Thunder Lizard</a>.

<lj-cut text=""Story below the cut."">
Adele Hart leaped to her feet at the shouts and breaking glass and piercing police whistles. Heedlessly letting her ruined Brontosaurus picture swing to the ground, she prepared to leave the museum as fast as possible. She wasn&rsquo;t going to hang around a fight that would get her arrested for looking suspicious &ndash; she was shabbily-dressed and she was black, and that meant &ldquo;guilty&rdquo; for coppers and gentlemen alike.

What stopped her was a groan of pain.

She turned back. And she ignored the scuffle and shrieking at the far end of the gallery to go to the gentlemen on his hands and knees, head hanging down.

By the time the tall thin gentleman came running back (the look of fear on his face telling her that these two were friends), Adele had the other man sitting up, and had finished knotting her kerchief around his head to stop the blood from the gash on his scalp.

The tall thin man knelt beside the bandaged fellow, the look of fear changing to one of relief. Adele met his uncanny grey gaze before lowering her eyes before her betters.

&ldquo;We are both in your debt.&rdquo; The tall fellow spoke as if she was a fine lady. &ldquo;And I heartily apologise for our disruption of your half-holiday from your position as laundress.&rdquo;

She jerked her head up to stare at him in surprise. She looked at the hawk-nosed man with the cool grey stare, the warmer gaze of the moustachioed man beside him. She knew who both of them were. All of them ignored the police handcuffing the curator in the background.

The bandaged man smiled at her, and his words only confirmed her supposition. &ldquo;Miss, permit me to introduce you to Mr. Sherlock Holmes.&rdquo;

&ldquo;And if there is anything I can do to repay this favour, please let me know.&rdquo; The tall thin man had a cooler gaze, but it too was kind, and he was grateful.

She nodded. &ldquo;Yes sir, Mr. Sherlock Holmes. The next time you come to my museum, will you please be a little quieter?&rdquo;

The bandaged man burst out laughing.

The thin-faced man was solemn-looking but his eyes twinkled. &ldquo;I shall.&rdquo;

Adele nodded with a smile of her own, and turned to retrieve her dropped sketch.

The beautiful little white star-shaped flowers covered the crags of the mountains along which Sherlock Holmes and I trod. I beamed to look at them, their sprightly appearance that of seemingly throwing open their arms to embrace the sun and the bright blue of the Alpine sky on this glorious day.

They clung to the rocks as I dashed past, heart in my throat, their spiked faces seeming to shriek with my inner being.

And they lined the cortege as I trudged to the Englischer Hof alone in the wake of the police, like hands reaching out to comfort me."

&ldquo;Leave it,&rdquo; the new king said to his brother who was about to dash the small harp on the rocks next to the blade. &ldquo;He can sing for me now. Or will he throttle me with the harpstrings in my sleep?&rdquo; Muirion, Muirios&rsquo; brother and captain, laughed contemptuously with his shield-wall of warriors, and threw the little implement of wood and sheep-gut back at the lamed soldier-turned-scop.
 
&ldquo;Your wretched life is spared, pig. I am your king now.&rdquo;
 
Se&aacute;n bowed his head to the very ground both to make obeisance to his new lord and to hide his bared teeth.
 
***
 
Shanaghan&rsquo;s people now toiled for Muirios in the field or marched to battle for him, their lives much as they had been before in Lundun. By the time their children took up swords and looms the wise and fierce warrior-king would be forgotten in favour of Muirios and his deeds. So was Muirios&rsquo; belief.
 
Se&aacute;n sang the work-songs that made the harvest-labour easier, the holy songs of the old gods to teach the children, the ancient songs of the heroes that came before, the comical songs that set the whole court of Muirios roaring and pelting him with pig-bones.
 
But that year the harvest-song Se&aacute;n sang was one the Lunduners had not heard before.
 
<i>Heavy my heart, hard the telling,</i>
<i>Final this fierce battle foundered;</i>
<i>A serpent has slain Lundun&rsquo;s shield,</i>
<i>Long-limbed lion, lord Shanaghan,</i>
<i>Warrior and wisest ever I wot &ndash; </i>
<i>Stung by a spider. Harp of mine, speak. </i>
<i>Mighty his mind, always his memory:</i>
<i>King Shanaghan, quick-witted and kind &ndash; </i>
<i>Woe to wickedness that wears his torque!</i>
 
The tune was an easy one, often used for long-versed hero ballads, the kind that becomes knit into memory like the links of chain-mail. A tune whose verses changed repeatedly to strop the dullness of work into the sharpness of ease:
 
<i>Splash of blood, a study in scarlet,</i>
<i>Clever the king who caught the slayer!</i>
 
<i>Shanaghan struck the poison snake,</i>
<i>Back to bite the bitter foe!</i>
 
<i>A Roman, red-haired as a son of Regan &ndash;</i>
<i>Shanaghan saw the red-hairs were stopped.</i>
 
So easy, and such a repeatable pattern. So easy to copy and mimic and to add.
 
Soon other Lunduners began trading their own verses with each other across the fields or among the flocks, in and around sacred or heroic songs:


<i>Shanaghan harried the Hound of Hell</i>
<i>Who guarded the gold. No king so good!</i>
 
<i>Men of the Valley he vanquished; victory.</i>
<i>Great is the glory of Shanaghan gone!</i>
 
<i>Goods and gold to the poor he gave;</i>
<i>Widows and waifs Shanaghan well-fed.</i>
 
Bolder still were the fellows who mockingly chanted other verses in and among the Shanaghan couplets:
 
<i>Muirios, mighty in only his mind,</i>
<i>Scuttling spider; dare we step on it?</i>
 
<i>Timid the torque-thief, tremulous Muirios,</i>
<i>Wishing for women that would not laugh.</i>
 
<i>Selfish and small-handed, stingy Muirios,</i>
<i>Gobbles the gold as our bellies gape. </i>
 
<i>Strong Shanaghan by Muirios slain &ndash; </i>
<i>Forever his fame, the spider forgotten!</i>
 
***
 
The inevitable happened; Muirios, home from yet another war, heard a lad toiling in the royal stables and singing one of the verses. During his savage whipping he howled the names of others who sang the tune &ndash; all of Lundun by this time. &nbsp;All of it of course eventually led back to the person who&rsquo;d taught them the song.
 
Muirios made sure the whole of Lundun was present when he executed the bard. Se&aacute;n watched Captain Muirion throw his harp into the same fire that heated the irons they turned on him.
 
&ldquo;Finally, the pig sings a song to my liking,&rdquo; said the king of the screams. The people of Lundun clutched their children and wept.
 
The last song of Se&aacute;n the bard before they took his tongue was a shriek: <i>Woe to wickedness that wears his torque! </i>
 
Afterward Muirios ordered the blinded, tongueless, fingerless man hung from the road-post by his elbows to starve and be eaten by the ravens.
 
But the king&rsquo;s men had neglected Se&aacute;n&rsquo;s ears. So the dying man &ndash; unable to play, to sing &ndash; heard the very men guarding him singing his catch, with even more new verses:
 
<i>Shanaghan, fearless, fought the foeman &ndash; </i>
<i>Brave the bard who fought beside!</i>
 
<i>Loyal that lion, lamed, in his vanguard &ndash; </i>
<i>Se&aacute;n</i> <i>to Shanagahn, brother souls! </i>
 
<i>Strong was Shanaghan, king unsurpassed &ndash; </i>
<i>Woe to wickedness that wears his torque!</i>
 
He heard travelers from Lundun as they passed his gibbet, and his own tune faded into the distance as they carried King Shanaghan and his unsurpassed bard into immortality &ndash; far beyond the grasp of Muirios. And from here, also, he could hear more verses springing up like weeds, faint across the fields. His vengeance for his fallen king was complete.
 
<i>How many new lines will those shepherds compose before I die?</i>
 
The guards shook at the horrific cackle that came from their prisoner &ndash; and even more at the one word he could form without his tongue:
 
&ldquo;Woe&hellip;&rdquo;

&ldquo;You are going to die tonight! You, sir! Yes, and you too, his companion! Brothers not in blood but in bond! Tonight both of you die, each for the other!&rdquo;

Holmes and I were both amused by the ranting fellow in Hyde Park pointing at both of us, even if a few nearby souls looked at us nervously and a nearby policeman even crossed himself. I was as unmoved as was Sherlock Holmes; I might have a little more faith in the spiritual side of existence and the possibility of foresight than does my rational friend, but I also have experience with the symptoms of monomania and madness, of which this seemed far more indicative than of any manifestation of the Sight.

But as it turns out, the strange man was a true foreseer.

That very evening Holmes and I chased a known agent of a European crime syndicate through a warehouse attached to a blueing factory, and emerged from among the vats triumphantly gripping our quarry. Since we&rsquo;d been forced to suppress his murderous impulses by tipping him into one of said vats &ndash; I struck the first blow to deflect his aim at Holmes, and my friend finished the job of sending him into the vat when he turned his gun on me &ndash; M. Lecoq went off to the cells at Scotland Yard resembling a Celtic warrior in hue. Holmes groaned when I jocularly pointed out that each of us had indeed <i>dyed</i> that night to keep the other safe.

Then we two returned to Baker Street and once again fulfilled that prophecy, in the French sense of the word. Twice.

My last thought before joining my lover in sleep was a resolution to return to Hyde Park and ask that chap for the names of a few racehorses.

<lj-cut text=""Story below the cut."">
Basil and I escaped England with our lives, but it was a narrow scratch &ndash; the one-eyed tomcat who just missed us at Dover hissed and hackled from the dock as the boat pulled away, furious. But under his clawed paws were both our bags, as we&rsquo;d let go of them to leap onto the moving vessel.

&ldquo;Oy! Moggie!&rdquo; I shouted at the ginger monster. I whisked my tail forward so that he could see the stump at the end, to scare the mis-littered creature.

But he only grinned at me. &ldquo;E&rsquo;en catkillers be killed!&rdquo; he yowled with the dockside cant of a ship&rsquo;s-cat. &ldquo;Catkillers be killed, Dawson!&rdquo;

A chill ran up my scarred back. Macavity had hired a fellow who didn&rsquo;t give a whisker-twitch for the fact that I&rsquo;d slain the best mouser in London.

&ldquo;Do convey my robust good health to Mr. Macavity, Ginger Tim!&rdquo; Basil called across the water. Only I saw that he was hackled to his very tail-hairs, enraged and afraid.

It was a satisfaction to see those notched ears flatten against Ginger Tim&rsquo;s skull for a moment. He&rsquo;d have to tell his boss that he&rsquo;d failed his commission &ndash; and he&rsquo;d get more than a &ldquo;Bad kitty!&rdquo; for this.

We left the old villain tearing open and scattering our meager luggage in his rage. I mournfully watched my handsome (and costly) paisley waistcoat sail into the greasy dock-water as we pulled further away from England. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t dare tell Mr. Mousekowitz what happened to that &ndash; he&rsquo;ll have a fit at a cat tearing up his best tailoring.&rdquo;

Basil patted my shoulder, his grim gaze never leaving the sight. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be very relieved you weren&rsquo;t in it at the time, my dear fellow.&rdquo;

###

Over the next few days we travelled south and east from France, through Belgium and into Germany. In all that time I could scarcely coax three words from my companion, nor compel him to take more than a few hours&rsquo; sleep at a stretch. &ldquo;I must hear from Gervaise, Dawson,&rdquo; he&rsquo;d say irritably, brushing aside all overtures of affection I attempted with him.

At Geneva we stayed at a charming subterranean hotel near a picturesque human chalet, maintained by a mole named Friedrich. As a good number of his customers were holiday-goers from all over Britain and Europe, his command of languages was splendid if heavily accented both for German and in the snuffly way of mole-language.

Basil had just roused from a short uneasy doze to join me at the dinner table &ndash; Friedrich maintained a splendid array of cheeses for his guests &ndash; when our good host bustled in, beaming and squinting. &ldquo;Herr Basil, your telegram awaited is here.&rdquo;

Basil leapt up, snatched the missive from Friedrich&rsquo;s paw, tore it open, read it, and flung it on the table with a word I will not repeat.

I waved the distressed Friedrich back to the cellar. Taking up the crushed telegram myself, I read the lines &ndash; ALL OTHERS CAUGHT STOP BUT CAT CAME BACK FULL STOP G &ndash; and bit back a foul curse myself.

&ldquo;Macavity has given them all the slip,&rdquo; Basil said bitterly, flinging his arms as if announcing the obvious. &ldquo;Oh, they have all the others in custody, well done them! The most dangerous one is free, and without a thing to lose now that his syndicate has been broken. What has he left, but vengeance?&rdquo; He exhaled hard, and looked at me once.

I folded my arms and glared at him &ndash; swishing my tail to show <i>him</i> the Catkiller&rsquo;s stump. He was not sending me away like some frightened client to be protected.

I did not imagine the relieved slump of his shoulders. &ldquo;We must leave here tomorrow, David,&rdquo; he said, and his voice was weary, just weary. &ldquo;We will be dangerous to <i>unser guter Friedrich</i> if we stay longer.&rdquo;

I rose and went to him. &ldquo;Tomorrow,&rdquo; I said. Then I took his paw and led him back to our room and made love to him until he fell asleep in my embrace.

###

Macavity was a Londoner who liked his creature comforts, and knew Basil was the same. Therefore we left inhabited places and civilised milieus, heading up into the mountains, still deep in snow despite it being early May. We dined like wild mice, on nuts and mushrooms, and bivouacked in unfinished holes or under tufts of dry grass. We meandered more than anything, for Basil was almost blithe in his assumption that Macavity would find us no matter how we tried to disguise our travel from now on.

&ldquo;He will have a few &ndash; a very few &ndash; lieutenants still,&rdquo; Basil warned me one evening. &ldquo;I have the list from Gervaise and his gang is rounded up, save one or two on whom I had not yet been able to put a face.&rdquo; He playfully ran his fingers along one of the bare claw-scars on my back till I giggled in an unbecoming fashion. &ldquo;You have taken the worst of his confederates down, Doctor, so I may need your help with the others.&rdquo;

The next day was lovely at the outset. The sky was a bright, perfect blue, dotted with clouds like newly-washed sheep; the snow underfoot was slushy but easily traversed with the snowshoes we both wore now; the weather as cool and crisp as the best apple. We made good time up Grindlewald.

Afternoon brought fog and icy cold, closing in, and the scattered trees had given way to white snow and grey granite and more white-grey snow and more white-grey granite. I shivered in the bulky coat I had gotten in Geneva. It was time we found a place to stay, to eat the acorns we&rsquo;d brought (I tried not to think longingly of Friedrich&rsquo;s Swiss cheeses) and to sleep.

I put my hand on Basil&rsquo;s elbow to ask him.

And that was when the grey-white granite boulder ahead of us rose up and grinned. A grey-and-white wolf, who&rsquo;d been lying in wait. &ldquo;<i>Guten tag, meine Herren.&rdquo;</i>

<b>Warning</b>: Profanity.
<b>Rating: </b>PG (language)
<b>Summary</b>: Amazingly, there actually is something that Joan Watson is BAD at.
<b>Author&rsquo;s Notes</b>: For the 2015 July Watson&#39;s Woes Promptfest prompt #28, <b><i>Bad, Bad, oh so Bad!</i></b><i> Whether it&#39;s bad art, bad fiction, or just plain awful, let the badness inspire you in some way today. Take a bad song and make it better, or make it so bad it&#39;s good? It&#39;s up to you!</i>

<lj-cut text=""Story below the cut."">
&ldquo;I see our quarry. Keep everyone distracted, Watson,&rdquo; Sherlock hissed in Joan&rsquo;s ear, leaving his seat even as she got up. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be back as soon as possible. But for now, keep everyone&rsquo;s attention on you.&rdquo; He vanished into the shadows even as she stepped into the spotlight.
 
That last order from her partner would have been a hell of a lot more comforting in, say, a strip club or a punk poetry slam. Joan figured she could strip about as well as could anyone who needed to undress, namely everyone &ndash; and if you rattled off enough profanity and bodily-function words to something resembling a rhythm you had modern poetry nailed.
 
But this. Oh, God, this.
 
&ldquo;<i>Feelings. Nothing more than feeeelings&hellip;</i>&rdquo;
 
Joan Watson, who could make her voice carry across an operating room or a crime scene with all the authority anyone could need, couldn&rsquo;t carry a tune in a paper bag. Were you to graph the phenomenon, the song&rsquo;s melody would be seen curving along in a smooth arc, dipping and rising &ndash; while Joan&rsquo;s voice zig-zagged up and down like a bad day on Wall Street in the general vicinity of each note, trying vainly to land.
 
She settled on mainly speaking the words and letting the machine fill in the music &ndash; and the machine was loud enough to blithely drown her out most of the time. Half the bar began yelling &ldquo;Speak up!&rdquo; and the other half began hollering &ldquo;Shut up, you suck!&rdquo;
 
Vowing never to forgive Sherlock for this, Joan slipped a couple of bills to the guy working the karaoke machine. And stayed.
 
<i>&ldquo;Did you ever know that you&rsquo;re my heee-roooooowww&hellip;&rdquo;</i>
 
&ldquo;Get! Off! The Stage!&rdquo; Stomp stomp. &ldquo;Get! Off! The Stage!&rdquo; Stomp stomp.
 
<i>&ldquo;Hey Jude. Don&rsquo;t make it bad&hellip;&rdquo;</i>
 
That third one, at least, was pure genius. She got the whole crowd to join in at the end &ndash; that glorious never-ending ending. &ldquo;<i>Na, na na nanana naaaaa! Nanana naaaa! Hey Juuude!</i>&rdquo; And finally the sound of actual, good singing filled the bar for the 3 solid minutes that ending lasted. (Okay, some of the hecklers were singing &ldquo;<i>Nanana naaaa! Fuck yoooooouuuu</i>!&rdquo;) That ending pacified and mollified the crowd. It would have been the perfect way to bow out.
 
Except that Sherlock wasn&rsquo;t done with whatever he was doing in the back room &ndash; possibly a full interrogation of the suspect, or he was tied up in the back room, or he&rsquo;d decided to pay a visit to the men&rsquo;s room while he was there.
 
So Joan smiled at the glaring, shouting crowd. &ldquo;And now,&rdquo; <i>I go home, change the locks and short-sheet that damn Englishman&rsquo;s bed</i>, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s &lsquo;Wonderwall&rsquo;.&rdquo;
 
&ldquo;Booooooo!&rdquo;

Oh Mary bless me, this lot again.

It&rsquo;s not the bloody rodent (mongoose my ear, that thing looks like a rat what got caught in a taffy-puller), for his little song and dance with that horrid snake did bring in the extra calls for beer &ndash; even if it did scuffle about afterward for the chips spilled by the soldiers while I was trying to serve the drinks.

It&rsquo;s his master &ndash; gave me the willies, he did, all brown and bent over and hunchbacked like that, with that dead look in his red eyes. Ooh, I&rsquo;d hate when he got drunk after the show, moaning some girl&rsquo;s name (Nancy, or Maisie, or whatever poor thing had once been courted by that broken man). Things got a bit better with the old fakir &ndash; his pension came through, or some such &ndash; so he don&rsquo;t do his Hindoo tricks as he done before, only once in a while.

Now when the old &lsquo;un comes in, like as not, that other chap&rsquo;s with him. Straight-backed fellow, sad look on his face, London accent, older than the other lads here, not as old as the hunchback, but by Gaw he&rsquo;s got the regimental swing to his walk and his arms, he&rsquo;s a old soldier too &ndash; fits right in at the Musket and Shot.

But oh! when they&rsquo;re together we&rsquo;re in for it. They set each other off like two lads in the back of a schoolroom, and soon they&rsquo;re laughing at horrible stories, telling jokes (<i>yelling</i> jokes more like it) where the punchline&rsquo;s some Hindoo jibber-jabber, and singing. Singing you expect from a soldier&rsquo;s pub, don&rsquo;t you? But these ain&rsquo;t proper English soldier songs about girls or marching or wars &ndash; it&rsquo;s some kind of heathen wailing from India. (&ldquo;She wishes to marry her sweetheart,&rdquo; the straight-back chap told me once, explaining the song, &ldquo;but he hasn&rsquo;t got enough camels yet.&rdquo;)

The worst was when the new Lieutenant came in. The pair of &lsquo;em was caterwauling up a storm, and when he ordered them to silence they cheeked him one after the other rattling off where they been and what they done in foreign lands while he was still on his mamma&rsquo;s knee, and then the Lieutenant yelled that a rat was in his beer and it was that bloody mongoose swimming in his pint-glass and both men bust out laughing and that&rsquo;s when the fight started. Thank the Lord Henry finally waded in with his shillelagh, for the Lieutenant just stood and yelled orders whiles every man in the place was throwing punches and trying to get hold of the two old &lsquo;uns what started it and then the old fakir let loose the cobra and <i>then</i> the pub got empty damn&rsquo; fast. We ain&rsquo;t seen those two around, nor the mongoose or the snake neither, for two months after that. Lieutenant never went in again (so there was that much good done, for commanders don&rsquo;t belong in a soldier&rsquo;s pub do they?)

But they&rsquo;re back, calling for porter, and the fakir&rsquo;s got more pennies these days than before, and the straight-back one&rsquo;s always free with his purse &ndash; and there&rsquo;s a light in the old &lsquo;un&rsquo;s red eyes that wasn&rsquo;t there before, and the straight-back chap don&rsquo;t look as sad as he used to. They&rsquo;re as bad as each other &ndash; and they&rsquo;re good for each other too. And I do say I ain&rsquo;t seen a rat nor mouse in the place since the mongoose showed up.

So pour the porter, Sallie girl. And maybe that poor girl&rsquo;s lad in the song will finally get those camels.

<i>Hornets, Joanie! Hornets! </i>
 
Joan leaped from the sofa at that cry from the queen bee, files scattering, startling her partner. &ldquo;Sherlock, we have to cover the hives!&rdquo; She tore for the stairway that led to the roof, snatching up a smoker from the shelf. &ldquo;Hornets!&rdquo;
 
Sherlock uttered an oath and followed her, stopping only to smack Clyde&rsquo;s aquarium wall three times with the flat of his hand.
 
Joan sent a message through every pheromone. <i><u>Get to safety, all of you! Hive! Hive! We&rsquo;ve got this!</u></i>
 
<i>Like fuck we&rsquo;re hiding! Those bitches want a rumble we&rsquo;re bringing it to &lsquo;em! </i>
 
<i><u>No, Your Solitude, hornets eat bees! Wait till we &ndash;</u></i>
 
<i>GO GETTEM GIRLS! </i>
 
Joan emerged in an angrily humming cloud of insects, puffing smoke ahead of her. Sherlock was right behind with his smoker &ndash; and behind him, Clyde on his gondola towed by drones, a fine-meshed net hanging from the starboard side.
 
***
 
They defeated the hornets but at a cost of a third of the bees and two badly-stung humans. Clyde had caught a netful of the soldiers but all they said when interrogated by the drones was <i>The Queen, The Queen; </i>Clyde ate them.
 
&ldquo;Watson.&rdquo; Sherlock held out a dead hornet in tweezers in one heavily-bandaged hand. Joan squinted through puffy eyes at the mark on the thorax.

Tenzing Jamling had brought <i>Pali</i> Sigerson the newspapers back with the other supplies from the village. Some were from London, one was from America, all only a few months old.
 
Now the others listened as a loud stream of angry invective came from the tent.
 
(Bad news from home.) Lakhpa drew in his tea in a sage manner. (The English is angry.)
 
(But Father Sigerson says he is from Norway,) young Nawang protested, reaching over to help himself to one of Lakhpa&rsquo;s few precious cigarettes. (That he learned his English in London. Perhaps his stocks are bad.)
 
The other Sherpas laughed. (The white men who try to climb Chomolungma all act the same,) Lakhpa explained. (But you can learn all the places where they are from by observation. Only an Englishman holds his tea-cup that way.)
 
Tenzing rejoined his fellows in the gab session and accepted his own tea. (I think the English will give up and go home.) He laughed and drank. (Perhaps my son will touch the Mother of the World, but not I.)
 
(For now your son will eat and drink from the Englishman&rsquo;s money,) Nawang piped up, and the others laughed and pounded his back.

&ldquo;A visitor, sir,&rdquo; Jennie said at his study&rsquo;s door.
 
Watson straightened up from his task and set the pen back in the stand. &ldquo;A patient? Very well. Send him up.&rdquo; He stood and went to the basin to wash the ink from his fingers.
 
A tram-car filled his doorway. A tram-car leapt off its rails.
 
Watson merely stood in the middle of the room and stared back at Mycroft Holmes.
 
&ldquo;The evidence is still on your hands, Doctor,&rdquo; the elder Holmes rumbled. &ldquo;I must congratulate you. Your scheme worked.&rdquo;
 
Watson had no chance of dissembling before his friend&rsquo;s intellectual superior. &ldquo;I know your brother. Once I had determined that he was alive, the surest way to make him move was to strike at his vanity. I too can employ a pseudonym or two.&rdquo;
 
&ldquo;Both of you will be in great danger from the moment he is back on English soil.&rdquo;
 
The doctor smiled, the smile the front row of enemy soldiers had seen. &ldquo;Then we will be two against that danger, and not one. But afterward, he will learn the cost of making me think he was dead for so long.&rdquo;
 
Mycroft shuddered very delicately. &ldquo;Understood. Until then, Doctor, I suggest you put down your Gladstone as well as your pen, and tend to your Webley.&rdquo;

<lj-cut text=""Story below the cut."">
When that awful actor came striding back through the door and up the stairs &ndash; every bit the masterful Mr. Sherlock Holmes of the Doctor&rsquo;s stories &ndash; and shouted &ldquo;The game is still afoot!&rdquo; to me and Miss Giles, that was the exact moment I knew things had changed.
 
That terrible evening was the lowest point I&rsquo;d ever known &ndash; heartbroken at losing poor Dr. Watson, a good tenant and a good man, in such a tragic manner; afraid of what that wicked Professor might do to the household now that he&rsquo;d killed our protector; utterly horrified to think of that drunken layabout Kincaid being our only hope; sorrowful that poor Miss Giles would never know her father&rsquo;s fate now.  
 
But Kincaid came back from the pub, afire with purpose not whisky, and soon we were all up in the main room of 221b whilst he strode in front of the blackboard, scrawling and erasing ridiculous theories. Yet I couldn&rsquo;t fault him; he&rsquo;d truly cared for the Doctor, you could see that, and it was clear he meant to make right what he could, even though he was an actor and not a detective. But it was him being an actor that solved it &ndash; that, and that street-urchin Wiggins finding the half-printed five-quid note, and soon it sent us all to the Orpheum Theater.
 
Yes, &ldquo;us.&rdquo; Much to my own astonishment I found myself bustling along with an actor and a street-rat heading toward a dangerous murderer, with nought but an umbrella for a weapon &ndash; I, who kept a good respectable Presbyterian household!
 
But I&rsquo;d seen the change in Mr. Kincaid. He was terribly afraid of Mr. Moriarty, but resolute. And in that fiery eye I saw a reflection of my own Scots rage. We couldn&rsquo;t save the dear Doctor&rsquo;s life, but by the Lord we&rsquo;d avenge him. (I never even noticed that I gripped my old brolly as if it was a claymore.)
 
Well, I wouldn&rsquo;t repeat that night if you paid me a thousand pounds. Everything was topsy-turvy and upside-down &ndash; a dead man alive again (to our astonished joy), a mouse become a roaring lion, a middle-aged landlady turned warrior, a damsel in distress who was actually a villain (I did feel better about coshing Miss Giles when I discovered that), a man become a maid.
 
But the greatest change, after all that happened, was to see the difference in how those two men looked at each other.&nbsp; And that was when I knew that this was not Sherlock Holmes&rsquo; last case, but the true beginning of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson&#39;s partnership.
 
I applauded with Wiggins and the reporters and all the people outside 221b for Dr. Watson, and for them both. But soon I was back inside, calling for the girl to sweep the front step and wash the windows, setting the kettle on and starting breakfast after a very long night for all of us. Even if one has behaved heroically the night before, standards must be maintained.

Joan woke up to them atop her bedspread, three of them lined up neat as a row of cigars. No note, no turtlegram. She exhaled in exasperation, then lay back and laughed a little. Yes, it was just a little weird that her male partner was more aware of her cycle than she &ndash; never mind how regular she was, it always seemed to spring upon her without warning &ndash; but having them available on the day she usually started was not a bad thing. She&rsquo;d certainly cured him of the misogynistic habit of using said cycle as an explanation for her moods or emotional state. And it was a thoughtful gesture, and refreshing to know a man who didn&rsquo;t react with automatic revulsion at this aspect of female biology.
 
All three came in handy that day &ndash; two for their avowed purpose, and one when Joan was cornered by a catcaller on her way to talk to a person of interest.
 
Normally Joan blew off the daily gauntlet of whistles, lip-smacks and obscene gestures and suggestions most walking women had to deal with in NYC as she simply didn&rsquo;t have time, and her usual &ldquo;I know 20 ways to kill you from here&rdquo; body language dealt with most of the problem.
 
But there were outliers, like the man who wouldn&rsquo;t stop walking alongside her and talking &ndash; she could smell him from 2 feet away &ndash; getting angrier and angrier that Joan wouldn&rsquo;t look his way. (Funny how the most repulsive, greasiest, stinkiest, unwashed-penis-est man on the block was always the one most offended that a woman didn&rsquo;t pay attention to him.) Not surprisingly, Mr. Wonderful was also mortally offended that Joan didn&rsquo;t comply with his racist fantasies about her sexual submissiveness.
 
Finally she said coldly, &ldquo;Leave me alone.&rdquo;
 
He grabbed her arm (assault and battery) and snarled &ldquo;Whassa matter, China-doll? You on the fuckin&rsquo; rag?&rdquo;
 
Joan let go of the baton in her purse and grabbed the other weapon. &ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; she said cheerily. &ldquo;Catch!&rdquo;
 
And she threw the still-wrapped, unused and pristine tampon into his face.
 
It was like throwing water on the Wicked Witch of the West. He screamed (actually screamed at a soprano octave) and let go of her, staggering back.
 
<i>Then</i> out came the baton and Joan landed one crack on one kneecap that dropped the howling swine. By the time he could get up she was long gone.
 
She never told Sherlock about the incident, except in retrospect a long time afterward (his lowering expression showing that she&rsquo;d made the right call).
 
But that was when she always made sure she had a few of those little cotton bombs stashed in her purse, ready to grab. Just in case.

<lj-cut text=""Story below the cut."">
<i>Watson &ndash; </i>
<i>A new Pharaoh.</i>
<i>DWB. </i>
<i>At station. Come prepared.</i>
<i> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --- Holmes</i>
 
Jon Watson stared at the yellow square in the center of Holmes&rsquo; door &ndash; written in Mrs. Hudson&rsquo;s scrawly handwriting.
 
He&rsquo;d been picking up his friend&rsquo;s methods for a while now, with the same sharp attention to detail that he used to triage patients at Convent Emergency.
 
So. Deduce this Post-It message, Dr. I&rsquo;m-Just-a-Medical-Intern Watson.
 
He hadn&rsquo;t seen any waiting messages or texts from Holmes when he&rsquo;d turned his cell back on, after a full day of surgery. But Holmes knew he&rsquo;d have had the phone off. Called the landlady instead &ndash; which would inform two people, once he&rsquo;d seen the note too. And he&rsquo;d told Holmes he&rsquo;d meet him at Baker Street after his shift.
 
&ldquo;A new Pharaoh&rdquo; &ndash; obvious reference to the line in Exodus about a new ruler who turned his back on the old ways and old associations, who&rsquo;d made slaves of former allies.
 
Allies&hellip;Holmes was allies with the police (and took enough grief for that from brothers who called him snitch or sellout when they were being polite).
 
So Lieutenant Stroud was away, and someone else had been working with Holmes &ndash; or was on the scene when Holmes showed up at a crime. Someone who didn&rsquo;t know Holmes or his methods.
 
Jon Watson dropped his head and rested the crown against the door, right over the Post-It. He exhaled mightily.
 
Now he understood the note. It was Holmes&rsquo; one phone call.
 
&ldquo;DWB&rdquo; normally meant Driving While Black/Brown, an acronym every black or Hispanic driver knew as the real charge when they were pulled over by white police and searched, ticketed, and arrested or shot over trifles while white motorists sped by unbothered (many of them with drugs, guns or even bodies in their trunks).
 
But here it meant Deducing While Black. Holmes had started to tell the po-po what had really happened at the crime scene, and a cop Jon would bet a month&rsquo;s pay was white had decided he wouldn&rsquo;t put up with a black civilian giving him attitude. Holmes was in lockup at the station.
 
&ldquo;Come prepared&rdquo; = &ldquo;Bring bail money.&rdquo;
 
So his night had not yet begun, was what that note said. First he had to get his partner&rsquo;s ass out of jail &ndash; and <i>then</i> they could go over Beryl Cornet&rsquo;s case.
 
Mrs. Hudson met Jon at the foot of the stairs as he headed for the front door. She handed him a paper bag &ndash; which he knew from the smell was a Tupperware of her <i>arroz con pollo</i>. &ldquo;Got locked up again. He&rsquo;ll be hungry.&rdquo; She shook her head. &nbsp;&ldquo;Maybe Mr. H should stop helping the police.&rdquo;
 
Jon laughed a little. &ldquo;Mrs. Hudson, he does this <i>in spite</i> of the police. All he wants is to find out the truth &ndash; and this sure as hell doesn&rsquo;t seem to stop him.&rdquo; Slow him down a bit, maybe, but not stop him. &ldquo;Thanks for the food. I know you made enough for me too.&rdquo;
 
She dimpled. &ldquo;Got a handsome doctor coming to see me regular, of course I&rsquo;ll make enough for him too!&rdquo;
 
With another laugh Jon Watson went out the door. Thank God Jabez at Wilson&rsquo;s Bail Bonds owed Holmes big time, he&rsquo;d get a good rate.

<b>Summary: </b> <i>Some </i>Terrors of the High Seas don&rsquo;t do well in the heat.
<b>Author&#39;s Notes: </b>For the 2015 July Watson&#39;s Woes Promptfest prompt #21, <b><i>Heat Rash</i></b><i>. It&#39;s a muggy, hot summer and someone&#39;s reacting badly. Metaphorical bonus points for including salve/lotion/ointment and needing help applying it.</i>


<lj-cut text=""Pipe the lubbers aboard!"">
The Doldrums. Days of not a breath of wind, sun beating down, sheets and ratlines still as the mast. The light bouncing off the sea is as hot and glaring as the sun &ndash; a bronze shield that burns and blinds in its own right. Men on a ship become the iron held between the anvil of the sea and the hammer of the sun. Mutiny weather, they call it.

Navy captains respond to this by doubling both the crew&rsquo;s workload and the grog ration, reasoning that a pack of gang-pressed, relentlessly abused, overworked and blazing hot men are less likely to slit throats if they&rsquo;re too exhausted and legless to take up arms.

Then again, Navy captains are faced with a shipful of men who can&rsquo;t swim, can only stare gloomily at the hateful sunlight glaring off the billowing sea as they get hotter and hotter &ndash; and angrier and angrier.

SPLASH!

The Bakers whooped and shouted as Gregson resurfaced from his leap off the jib line, shaking back his wet hair. Half the crew was swimming around the barque like motley porpoises. The other half were on deck or sweltering below in their hammocks, resting in lieu of sleep denied because of the heat. The ship&rsquo;s bos&rsquo;n Angel laughed at the men&rsquo;s antics, but his eyes and attentions never left the water from his place at the ship&rsquo;s waist; nor did his harpoon, poised and ready for the first sign of a shark fin.

The captain and I were removed from the men swimming, however &ndash; I, because I&rsquo;d stopped my swim lessons after losing a hand to my captor, and also because Shear-Lock required my assistance in his cabin. Even with the portholes open the room was stifling; no breeze relieved the man on the bed.

&ldquo;Christ on the Cross, Jack!&rdquo;

&ldquo;Language, Cap&rsquo;n,&rdquo; I said in a jesting manner even as I pitied the man. I&rsquo;d never met any man at sea so loth to indulge in profanity, even while I was sewing his arm back together. For Shear-Lock to blaspheme was a sign of great distress.

The Baker&rsquo;s chief, one of the most feared pirates in the seven seas, was in a pitiable state &ndash; his throat, arms, and groin were red-speckled as if with the pox. &ldquo;Heat-pox, or heat rash,&rdquo; I said sternly when Wiggins would have dashed away in horror, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not fatal and it doesn&rsquo;t catch. It&rsquo;s sun&rsquo;s heat trapped in the skin.&rdquo;

Fortunately Wiggins and I had prepared a cask of ointment for the crew&rsquo;s sun-wounds &ndash; invaluable on a ship in the tropics &ndash; with the aid of Angelo the cook (who divided up his precious scraps of fat between me and his Sunday duff for the men).

&ldquo;I smell like a platter of <i>barbacoa</i>,&rdquo; Shear-Lock said peevishly as the surgeon&rsquo;s mate and I slathered him (I&rsquo;d removed my saw-hand to have both limbs free for this task).

Wiggins and I bit our lips to keep from laughing, because it was true &ndash; the herbs we&rsquo;d added to the rendered fat poorly disguised its bovine nature. All the captain needed now was a good wrap in <i>maguey</i> leaves and a steaming in an underground pit (sadly, his piping-hot quarters would serve the purpose admirably).

&ldquo;I&rsquo;d prefer you smelled like Christmas dinner, Captain, but beef tallow is easier gained in these islands than goose-grease.&rdquo;

Wiggins snorted, then set his face straight with a penitent &ldquo;Sorry, Cap&rsquo;n.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Should have both of you flogged for that,&rdquo; Shear-Lock groaned.

And both of us <u>would</u> have been flogged for that insolence, had we been on a Royal Navy vessel. Odd how much more humane a pirate ship was to its crew than was a ship of Their Royal Majesties.

Splashing, shouts and laughter reached our ears from the outside. I sweltered in the hot cabin, and thought that maybe there was something in this swimming nonsense Shear-Lock demanded of all his sailors. Right now I could only douse myself from a bucket lowered overboard &ndash; a risky prospect right now, as the sea closest to a long-foundered ship soon resembles a London sewer (for the same disgusting reason).

Shear-Lock turned his head to look out the portal, longing on his face. &ldquo;The water is so cool. Perhaps if I were to swim&hellip;&rdquo;

&ldquo;That&rsquo;s bad for you, Cap&rsquo;n. This rash is heat buried in your skin, and it takes heat to drive it out again &ndash; all the current medical minds are in agreement.&rdquo; I dipped the tip of my stumped left forearm into the salve pot and stroked a little more ointment onto his scarred arm, the wound he&rsquo;d taken the day I&rsquo;d first saved his life. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the same reason you set fire to a row of houses to stop a city-wide fire by pushing back against the first.&rdquo;

&ldquo;I must conceded to your medical superiority, Doctor.&rdquo; Groaning, the captain sat up and surveyed his nearly-naked and glistening form. &ldquo;At any rate, I now resemble a slaughtered bullock. If I entered the water it would engender an unhealthy excitement among the shark population. Billy!&rdquo; The last was a bellow.

&ldquo;Be sure to wear a hat or at least a head-rag, to keep the worst of the sun off you,&rdquo; I added as the captain&rsquo;s cabin boy came in to help his master dress. The surgeon&rsquo;s mate and I left the cabin for the deck, to employ the ointment among the sunburnt and other rash sufferers in the crew. Doldrums or not, the work on a ship rarely slowed and never ended for any aboard. I&rsquo;d followed my own advice, as had Wiggins, and we wore knotted head-cloths to stave off our own sun.

&ldquo;Christ it&rsquo;s fucking hot,&rdquo; Wiggins groaned, now that we were free of the captain&rsquo;s presence. &ldquo;Suppose we all got together and blew hard on the sails, or fanned our shirts?&rdquo;

I laughed as I cleaned the worst of the greasy ointment from my hand and stump with another rag. &ldquo;The only way we could move now would be if we got out in the boats and rowed, towing the Baker. Or if we harpooned Mocha Dick and let that old monster drag us around the islands.&rdquo;

Wiggins squinted at the relentless sun swimming in the hot moist air. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s taking forever to get to Nuevo Filipino. Wish the wind would come back. What&rsquo;s there anyway we can&rsquo;t find closer?&rdquo;

A former <i>Octavius</i> gunner, whose purse held gold taken from Moriarty. &ldquo;Our next strike,&rdquo; I said grimly, and went to salve Angel&rsquo;s sunburnt back.

<b>Summary: </b>This is what I write when I listen to Aaron Copeland&rsquo;s &ldquo;Rodeo,&rdquo; apparently.
<b>Author&#39;s Notes: </b>For the 2015 July Watson&#39;s Woes Promptfest prompt #20, <b><i>Yankee Doodle Came to London</i></b><i>: Doyle seemed to have a fascination for people and things American (three of his four novel-length Sherlock Holmes tales feature someone from North America), and societies as diverse as Pennsylvanian coal-town gangs, the Latter-Day Saints and the KKK appear in Canon.

Put something or someone American in your entry (or just have Joan Watson show up), or do an American-based pastiche (or just put Joan Watson in the story, did I mention her?).</i>

<lj-cut text=""Story below the cut."">
Fourth of July is a curse on every lawman&rsquo;s lips in every cowtown out here. You take a whole pile of drunk-ass farmers and ranchers and cow-men and con-men and thieves and rustlers and renegades and Kiowa and Comanche &ndash; and their women, <i>and</i> the whores, all armed and dangerous, and you throw in a <i>celebration</i> during the hottest time of the year &ndash; well let&rsquo;s just say things get mighty splendid.

Bakerstown was no different. Until those two splashed in one day in mid-January, up to their horses&rsquo; ankles in rain, and things started changing.

First big change was the one Sheriff Lock put in place right off &ndash; no guns permitted within the town borders. There was a big howl about that one, but Lock told everyone that if they wanted to kill someone they&rsquo;d just have to use a knife or their fists until they were at the outskirts. And they could snarl all they wanted at the rule, but they couldn&rsquo;t call the sheriff a hypocrite because Lock never carried a gun himself. A lot of us scoffed at the idea &ndash; and I&rsquo;ve been mayor here for 4 years, I should know &ndash; but damned if it didn&rsquo;t start working. Farmers started leaving their deer rifles at the sheriff&rsquo;s office, and cattlemen and hired hands their pistols. Within three months a shooting in town was a rarity, and a lot easier to track down the culprit for prison or the noose.

&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the women,&rdquo; Lock explained to me. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve seen it everywhere we go. A town that&rsquo;s safer for the wives to do business does better. The women talk to each other, and they go home and talk to their husbands. There isn&rsquo;t a married man alive who wouldn&rsquo;t rather be laughed at by other men for not carrying a gun than deal with an angry wife at home for carrying it.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Suits me. Knife wounds are a hell of a lot easier to sew up,&rdquo; Doc drawled. He carried his Colt and no one gainsaid him on that, Lock included. No one accused Doc of hypocrisy because everyone knew the story about the loco sumbitch picking up a sidewinder in his bare hand to throw it at someone who&rsquo;d threatened the sheriff &ndash; he was just as dangerous without being a crack shot.

The other thing Lock did was suggest that I announce a new event for the Fourth &ndash; a horse race from the outskirts to Riker&rsquo;s Butte and back, with a $20 gold piece for the winner. This was a considerably more entertaining prospect for most folks than just getting drunk and shooting things (which they could do any other day of the year). Every man who had a nag started putting the animal through its paces; Jacobs the blacksmith and his two boys worked dawn to dusk turning out new horseshoes to meet the demand.

This didn&rsquo;t stop the normal temperament of Bakerstown from coming out, however. Along with the new horseshoes and the stepped-up racing here and there to prepare for the big day, there were fellows trying to cripple the competition. Horse thefts and lamings skyrocketed; Col. Ross was found with his head stove in at his ranch and his fastest mare, Silver Blaze, missing (Lock tracked the beast and only shook his head at Joshua Straker&rsquo;s feeble attempt to hide her facial marks with lampblack; Straker had nothing further to say on the matter, as he&rsquo;d tried to pull a gun on Lock in Doc&#39;s presence).

&ldquo;Unhealthy excitement about the race,&rdquo; I said after we&rsquo;d returned the mare to the colonel&rsquo;s widow and fire-eyed son and sent Straker to join Ross at the undertaker&rsquo;s.

Lock pursed his lips, which tilted his pipe upward a bit. &ldquo;As opposed to the unhealthy excitement engendered by normal Independence Day activity around here, Mayor Strade?&rdquo;

&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t believe him, Les. Admit it, Sheriff.&rdquo; Doc pointed a finger as if taking aim at his friend. &ldquo;You just want to show everyone how well you sit a horse.&rdquo;

&ldquo;I have no idea what Doc is going on about, Mr. Mayor,&rdquo; Lock said.

The actual morning of the Fourth began in the usual manner, with whoops and gunfire &ndash; but outside the town limits this time. It was a lot shorter duration, too, since they&rsquo;d have to surrender the guns to get good and drunk at one of the saloons, and sober men don&rsquo;t spend as much time wasting their bullets.

Other activities filled the day: wrestling matches and fist-fights, footraces, horseshoe tossing, target shooting, and a poetry competition (two or three good mocks of &ldquo;Rose My Rose&rdquo; this year) &ndash; all accompanied by enough food and beer to satisfy the town. As mayor of the town I was obligated to make a flowery speech about progress and our country&rsquo;s glorious history, but instead I read the Declaration of Independence aloud.

At two the racers lined up at the edge of town, with people lining the start of the two-mile distance to the foot of the butte. There was Silver Blaze, with Ross&rsquo; angry young son astride her; Bob Norbertson on his piebald Shoshone Prince; black hired hands and blond farmers and brown rancheros and even a few of the local Comanche on their ponies. (That had been another sore spot for the more civilized townsmen, but Lock said he reckoned if they did business in town as did the farmers and ranchers they got to race.)

From my seat on a wooden platform built for the occasion I watched as Lock paced before the racers on his bay &ndash; and Doc was right, there was something grand in the way he sat. He looked like he should be out hunting a fox on a green estate instead of roaming the brush for chicken-thieving coyotes. Must have learned that dainty way of riding back east, somewhere.

&ldquo;Riker&rsquo;s Butte,&rdquo; the sheriff called. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a wooden fence-post set up there at the base. Circle round the post and head back here. Doc&rsquo;s at the post with a few others to make sure you go all the way there before turning around. When you come back, race past the mayor&rsquo;s stand,&rdquo; and he pointed with a stiff short whip where I sat, &ldquo;and the first to do so is the winner. Now take your mark, and upon my signal &ndash;&rdquo;

Steve Dixie fired his Colt into the air. All the horses took off, with people shouting and waving hats and shooting a few more rounds in the air for good measure.

The look Lock gave the disappearing riders would have made a marble statue bust out laughing, but I manfully held it down to a sympathetic, &ldquo;Pearls before swine, Sheriff.&rdquo;

&ldquo;I can think of a few other old sayings, Mr. Mayor,&rdquo; Lock said peevishly, peering at the shouting spectators. &ldquo; &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t count your chickens before they&rsquo;re hatched,&rsquo; and &lsquo;there&rsquo;s many a slip twixt the cup and the lip&rsquo;.&rdquo;

Before I could ask what Sheriff Lock meant by that, he rode away from my stand toward where a group of <i>vaqueros</i> stood or sat on their own horses with their families. Lock exchanged a few words in Spanish with one of the mounted men, who handed over his coiled <i>lariata</i>. Lock shook out a length of the rope and doubled it, swiftly forming a slip- noose, and moved back into the throng.

Shouting growing louder. The racers were coming back.

Lock flung his lasso and yanked. A rifle flew through the air, caught by the noose, as if Lock had just hooked a salmon out of the river. Lock seized the rifle with his free hand. The horseman who&rsquo;d been holding it broke and galloped off, with Lock in pursuit.

I was so caught up in what Lock was doing that I almost missed noting the winner of the race (Wasapay, one of the Comanche, whose spotted pony tore straight through Bakerstown without stopping at my stand, head and neck ahead of Silver Blaze).

The booing townsmen might have torn down my stand in protest at an Indian winning if Doc hadn&rsquo;t come cantering after the last of the stragglers, looking like a few dead bodies would make his day perfect &ndash; and right on his heels Sheriff Lock loped back, towing a bound man on a horse behind him by the riata in his hand. &ldquo;Seems some objected to an open race more than others, Doc.&rdquo;

Doc tipped his hat mockingly to the captive. &ldquo;Afternoon, Miz Ross.&rdquo;

I gaped and stared again; so did the crowd, distracted from their angry-mob desire for destruction. That wasn&rsquo;t a man at all, as Doc had seen &ndash; it was the Widow Ross dressed as a man.

The novelty of the intrigue was distracting enough that the crowd forgot about trying to change the outcome of the race, and I was able to hand the prize over without fanfare to the winning rider, who never got off his pony and who tore out of town the second the coin was in his hand (along with the other Comanche and Kiowa who&rsquo;d been in town for the festivities, who clearly knew the ways of white men).

All would come out eventually, all the sordid pettiness of a love affair with Straker and a plan to hide the mare to drive up betting, and that Marian Ross had wanted to disqualify any front-runner who threatened the ascendency of her Silver Blaze, permanently &ndash; either by killing the horse or the rider, or both if she was fast enough with the Winchester repeater Lock had yanked from her grasp. (I had to admit, the use of Silver Blaze&rsquo;s old horseshoe nailed to the fence-post with which Straker clubbed Colonel Ross was a nice touch, trying to make it look like a panicked kick from the escaping mare.)

But for now the excitement was over. Ross was locked in the jail; her kicking, biting son offered a choice of joining his mother in lockup or being taken in tow by the schoolteacher (to the boy&rsquo;s credit, he chose family); and I joined the two men in a celebratory glass while firecrackers went off by the thousands out in the street, provided by the Chinese families.

&ldquo;Perhaps next year the riders will wait until I give the signal,&rdquo; Lock said, lighting up his pipe.

&ldquo;Sure to, Lock.&rdquo; Doc tipped his hat down to hide his grin. &ldquo;Sure to.&rdquo;

I thought of the mayhem and murder that had led up to today. I nodded. &ldquo;Good idea of yours, Sheriff. This is the most peaceful Fourth Bakerstown&rsquo;s ever had.&rdquo;

<b>Summary:</b> The Goose Girl is not allowed to tell a soul her troubles, but tells all to the stove.
<b>Author&#39;s Notes: </b>For the 2015 July Watson&#39;s Woes Promptfest prompt #19, <b><i>While You Were Sleeping</i></b><i>. Watson is presumed unconscious/asleep/comatose, but he can hear everything everyone says at his bedside.</i>


<lj-cut text=""Story below the cut."">
Watson sat motionless in a corner of the rooms; it was the regular time in which all of Scotland Yard&rsquo;s compudroids received their regular updates and debugging ware, recharging at the same time. He had at Holmes&rsquo; request switched off the holo-mask some time ago, but the voiceware remained; it was enough unlike Watson&#39;s actual voice that it did not unnerve the man.

Holmes looked at the droid from across the room, seated in his favourite chair (odd that it had survived as long as he had, no doubt in a similar state of storage). He shook his head at his own idiocy. But even in days past, he had used Watson as sounding-board only and had achieved good results. This might be just as useful.

&ldquo;Watson. And I do mean the compudroid Watson, not my original friend Dr. Watson.&rdquo; He shook his head again. &ldquo;I risk making a great fool of myself speaking to an empty room, but as there is no one to witness I am safe. I know you are incapable of responding right now, and that you are in the sleeping mode affected by mechanical devices during this refreshment phase.

&ldquo;I am very well aware that you saved my life yesterday by taking that electrical shock meant for me. Moriarty&rsquo;s new weapon is a deadly thing, a gun that shoots lightning. That would have destroyed every synapse in my brain making me completely irretrievable after this death.&rdquo; He exhaled. &ldquo;I am &hellip; conflicted &hellip; at how grateful I should be for that act.

&ldquo;There are times &ndash; some more than others &ndash; when this new work is not enough, when this age of miracles and amazing discoveries is too much for my Victorian mind. When I am overcome with loss of the few human beings I had loved &ndash; my Watson, my brother, the Inspector Lestrade who is my partner&rsquo;s ancestor &ndash; and all I want is to go back to sleep and this time never arise. I did not ask to become King Arthur, reposing until the world had need of me.

&ldquo;But I also know that your duty is to serve humans &ndash; and you have acquired enough of my old friend Watson&#39;s personality that your behavior is completely compatible with how he would have reacted in such a moment &ndash; taking the fatal bolt meant for me.

&ldquo;He did much the same when Killer Evans pulled out his gun &ndash; jolted me aside enough so that the shot aimed at me struck him instead. I was so furious at him, and frightened, and so cold with rage at Evans, that I would have committed murder without thought nor regret had he killed Watson. That was when I truly knew it was time for me to retire; we were both too old for this rough game that had been our joy as hale young men.

&ldquo;So I turned to my bees; Watson wed a third time and settled into his life as a man of letters. We met as friends on a regular basis, but we each had our own lives now. And we were content with the change; I felt it, and I could see it in him. I was glad to see the change in him. Our memories were good, but our current lives were good too. We were both aware of our age and our mortality, and accepted how our lives were ending. And &hellip; after &hellip; I made it a habit to go to Minstead once a year, and visit his grave, and thank him for the precious gift he had made me of his friendship. A speech he could hear as well as you hear me now, I fear.

&ldquo;And that is one reason I fear you, Watson. You are programmed to serve me without any thought of self-preservation nor self-awareness. You will never leave me for a wife or to write novels. If necessary, you will self-destruct in my defense, as you nearly did yesterday. Will you be honoured or troubled if I tell you that I was as frightened at the thought of losing you as I was of losing him in Nathan Garrideb&rsquo;s rooms?&rdquo;

He laughed a little, half self-deprecating and half in wonder. &ldquo;I am weary of this world at times. But I also know that I have ties to this time now. I see Beth Lestrade becoming the police officer her predecessor only wished he could be, and feel as proud of her as her own father must. I am grateful you are here, not merely to aid but to listen and to speak. Wiggins and his friends are as sharp and eager for an adult&rsquo;s mentoring as were the original street-lads I employed. And this foul clone of my nemesis needs someone who thoroughly understands his mindset pitted against him. I am here, and I am needed.

&ldquo;Watson. I apologize for shouting at you in my panic yesterday. I am glad for your friendship as much as for your service. You are not my old friend. You are my current friend.&rdquo;

He exhaled. He felt lighter. It seems this time&rsquo;s propensity for belief that talking about one&rsquo;s sorrows aided in their healing was rooted in truth. He picked up the violin he had found in a curio shop and began to tune the strings.

While playing his third <i>etude</i> by Chopin, he heard the telltale of the compudroid being powered up to full awareness. He didn&rsquo;t look up even at the hydraulic thumps of the droid walking over to him. But one word made him stop playing.

&ldquo;Honoured,&rdquo; Watson said.

<b>Summary:</b> Watson had thought there was ONE thing at which he was better than Holmes&hellip;
<b>Author&#39;s Notes: </b>For the 2015 July Watson&#39;s Woes Promptfest prompt #18, <b><i>The Games We Play.</i></b><i> Involve a game of some sort in your story, whether it&#39;s a round of whist, an intense night of Cluedo, or a Pac-Man tournament.

###</i>

I&rsquo;ve often wished that I might have <u>one</u> quality of which Sherlock Holmes is not my superior. But what rankled most was the golf.

I&rsquo;d taken him on the links during a lull in a Devon investigation; I&rsquo;d thought to prove the better man as my profession and this sport travel cheek-by-jowl. For the first few holes I scored better. But then Holmes began working out the physics of each trajectory and the club&rsquo;s force upon the ball, and I was lost. If I reached the hole in three strokes, he did it in two; if mine edged into the sand trap his ball skimmed &lsquo;round to emerge unscathed.

The worst part was his first ace. His reaction was only a pleased &ldquo;Hm,&rdquo; as if reaching a chemical reaction he&rsquo;d been expecting, instead of whooping or bragging as a normal golfer would.

I&rsquo;d bitterly resigned myself always to second place with him, when the burglar tore across the green.

Holmes stared at the man running from the clubhouse he&rsquo;d just pilfered. He switched out his iron for a wood and sent his ball in a perfect arc. It landed squarely atop the ruffian&rsquo;s noggin and flattened him, long enough for pursuers to collar him.

That was too magnificent for words, but I did my best &ndash; and succeeded, judging from Holmes&rsquo; blush."

<b>Summary:</b> Reginald Kincaid has an unfortunate tendency.
<b>Author&#39;s Notes: </b>For the 2015 July Watson&#39;s Woes Promptfest prompt #16, <b>Ablaze:</b>

<img alt="""" height=""201"" src=""https://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/p/7/005/068/334/0d3f8c1.jpg"" width=""300"" />

<lj-cut text=""Story below the cut."">
Reginald Kincaid had many good qualities that aided him in his portrayal of Sherlock Holmes.&nbsp; Despite the fact that the actor was a gambler, womaniser and drunkard when left to his own devices (vices that Dr. Watson wrote into his own avatar in the case-stories), he was good enough at his profession that when he was on-stage, so to speak, he was the epitome of the aristocratic, enigmatic sleuth. His proficiency at memorisation and improvisation was invaluable for times when Watson had to hastily re-write a deduction seconds before a press conference, or cover a blunder (&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid we were both misled, Watson old man&rdquo;). His experience in the lowest of music-hall theatres meant he was expert at staying in character despite any obstacle, surprise, or response (&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve done Hamlet&rsquo;s soliloquy while people were throwing beer-bottles and taunting me, Watson &ndash; this is nothing&rdquo;).

However, loth though Watson was to admit it, there was something for which Kincaid had an unfortunate tendency: Inadvertent fire-starting.

If Kincaid came within an arm&rsquo;s-length of Watson&#39;s chemistry table an explosion was sure to follow (Watson always made sure to have buckets of water and sand underneath at all times now, <i>and</i> had written a well-received monograph on burn treatment).

The Orpheum suffered the same unhappy fate of far too many British theaters &ndash; and whether it would have burned without Kincaid&rsquo;s dropping the lantern was debatable.

There was that unfortunate incident at the Dartmoor racetrack (Kincaid had bummed a cigarette from one of the grooms and dropped it whilst lighting it), which became immortalized in more ways than one &ndash; not only for the stupid dog that just stood there and did nothing whilst the empty stalls went up and grooms led the panicked beasts away, but also for the fact that before that fire the winning entry had been known by the name Silver <i>Bolt</i>.

The man who&rsquo;d tipped them to the Blond-Headed League suffered a similar fate; Kincaid had leaned over to ask a question of the tow-headed Jabez Wilson when his pipe caught the poor man&rsquo;s hair alight &ndash; turning the pawnbroker into a blazing, shrieking redhead in an instant. (Fortunately he was right by the chemistry table and Watson was able to douse him with the bucket of water.) The French gold was saved, but both men narrowly avoided a lawsuit by the now bald-headed and red-eyed Wilson.

They weren&rsquo;t all bad. The Orpheum fire did end Moriarty&rsquo;s career. There was also that grass-fire that smoked out the man who&rsquo;d been stalking Violet Smith on her bicycle (sadly, nearly suffocating the poor girl with smoke too, but all&rsquo;s well that ends well).

The worst one though&hellip;

As they fled the room in which they had planned to lie in wait for Colonel Moran (&ldquo;Watson, I thought those two stones were part of a rock fountain! Who leaves a rifle flint and iron ore in a puddle of kerosene?&rdquo; his partner shouted behind him), Watson was already rearranging the facts to fit The Adventure of the Thankfully-Empty House.

That was the worst incident, because of the two notes they received afterward.

One: A cock-a-doodle of victory from Inspector Lestrade. As it turned out that night, the Colonel had seen the house go up in flames, had run the other way and went smack into Lestrade&rsquo;s squad, where he was promptly taken into custody and provided a handsome feather for Scotland Yard&rsquo;s cap.

Two: A note on heavy cream paper, lavishly engraved, that struck Watson cold with terror.

&ldquo;Oooh, lovely!&rdquo; Kincaid said, reading over Watson&#39;s shoulder. &ldquo;Her Majesty has invited us to tea in Buckingham Palace!&rdquo;

<b>Summary: </b>Corporal Henry Wood didn&rsquo;t just have a pet mongoose.
<b>Author&#39;s Notes: </b>For the 2015 July Watson&#39;s Woes Promptfest prompt #14, <b><i>Not So Cute</i></b><i>. It&#39;s easy to be shmoopy when there are adorable baby animals involved. Try to create something shmoopy with a less-than-adorable and/or not-quite-a-baby animal.</i> This story takes place in my <a href=""http://archiveofourown.org/series/50164"">Wounded Warriors</a> series about a friendship that develops between Dr. Watson and Corporal Henry Wood, aka the eponymous &ldquo;Crooked Man&rdquo; of that Sherlock Holmes tale.

<lj-cut text=""Sssstory below the cut."">
During the years in which I believed my friend Mr. Sherlock Holmes dead at Reichenbach (and had truly lost my dear Mary to a virulent &lsquo;flu that had struck her at the very beginning of her pregnancy) I had made a habit of paying regular visits to Aldershot to call upon my friend Corporal Henry Wood (whose unhappy life can be read in the story of &ldquo;The Crooked Man&rdquo;); the man&rsquo;s own understanding of tragedy, losing a beloved, and the terrible cost of fighting for Her Majesty was a balm to my own sorrow. As I had once described our association to Holmes, we were rather like two old wolves licking each other&rsquo;s wounds, for Wood often told me what a comfort it was to talk to a fellow old soldier who knew the meaning of pain and loss, and looked at him as a comrade instead of with pity at a misshapen cripple.
 
Today we took our ease in Wood&rsquo;s lodgings on Hudson Street, a small but clean set of rooms on a quiet throughway. He produced a bottle of stout, which turned the packet of sandwiches I had brought into a feast. Wood was still as grotesquely bent as ever &ndash; his broken body was beyond modern medicine&rsquo;s ability to straighten &ndash; but he did not look as haggard and gaunt as when Holmes and I first laid eyes upon him. The efforts of his former sweetheart and fellow sufferer at the same ruthless hands, the widow Nancy Barclay, had borne good fruit. (I myself wrote a letter or two to the Army board on Corporal Wood&rsquo;s behalf &ndash; who were impressed not by my credentials as a veteran of Afghanistan but by the name of the man with whom I was now irretrievably associated; I knew Holmes would have been pleased at the use of his name to such an end and accepted the doors that it opened.) The end result was that Wood now had a small but steady income in the form of a pension, enough for the man&rsquo;s few needs, and no longer relied solely upon his Indian fakir tricks to bring in the pennies. A clean room, regular meals, freedom from subsistence drudgery and a soul no longer burdened by hatred and grief had worked wonders on the man.
 
Even Teddy had filled out. Wood&rsquo;s pet mongoose had free run of the rooms, as he would have had in any self-respecting bungalow in India, and the little chap was in and out of everything, looking more like a German sausage these days than like a whipcord with red eyes. &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t been performing your death-dance lately, have you Ted?&rdquo; I asked, scratching the beast when it slithered up my leg and stared at me.
 
Wood grinned. &ldquo;Nor has he, Captain Watson. He eats as well as me these days. So does Nog. &lsquo;Course, she can&rsquo;t kill the rats herself, Teddy does that for her.&rdquo;
 
&ldquo;Nog?&rdquo; But then I remembered, even as I realised that he&rsquo;d said &ldquo;Nag&rdquo; with the Indian pronunciation. Teddy&rsquo;s part in Wood&rsquo;s show had been to fight a cobra (with its fangs removed) for the entertainment of the audience. &ldquo;Nag&rdquo; was the Indian word for &ldquo;cobra.&rdquo; &ldquo;Is she here? Do you have a cage for her?&rdquo;
 
For answer Wood thumped the floor hard. &ldquo;Old girl&rsquo;s deaf as a post, but she&rsquo;ll feel the boards.&rdquo;
 
The next thing I knew I was staring into the shining black shoe-button eyes of a hooded cobra, which had slithered down from the rafters and right into Henry Wood&rsquo;s lap.
 
Wood took her firmly behind the head with thumb and finger just where the hood started. &ldquo;Her fangs are gone and she&rsquo;s harmless, so I give Nag the run of the place, same as Teddy. Teddy&rsquo;s so well-fed now he won&rsquo;t even look at Nag, let alone fight her. I&rsquo;m not the only one who&rsquo;s gotten an easy life from my pension, Doctor! And she scares the rats and mice away that Teddy doesn&rsquo;t catch himself, though she can&rsquo;t bite &lsquo;em. I&rsquo;ve got the cleanest rooms on this street.&rdquo;
 
In truth, I hardly heard that last part of Wood&rsquo;s conversation, for I was enthralled with this close-up look at the creature. Perhaps because I knew her to be perfectly safe and under Wood&rsquo;s control, I felt no fear at all at being this close to a famously poisonous serpent, and all my attention was on her appearance.
 
She was an Indian cobra, and not her larger cousin the king-cobra &ndash; she bore two dark spots banded with a pale ring on the front of her hood, rather than the spectacled clown-face that leers from the back of the latter&rsquo;s hood. Her body&rsquo;s scales repeated in a speckled pattern of grey and cream and brown almost like a tweed, clearly useful for hiding in dry grass for prey. Her eyes were shining black beads of solid colour.
 
I did not expect the next words out of my mouth. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s &hellip; beautiful.&rdquo;
 
Wood grinned. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s true, ain&rsquo;t it? Touch her back, Doctor.&rdquo;
 
Heart pounding, yet unable to resist the challenge, I extended a hand. Nag opened her fangless mouth and hissed at me but Wood had her. I rested my fingers on the cobra&rsquo;s back and almost jumped. I knew snakes were not slimy, but I had at least expected the scales to be rough. But the pebbled skin was as sleek and smooth as the softest leather, under which strong muscles moved like a man flexing his forearm.
 
Nag hissed at me again. &ldquo;There, there, old girl,&rdquo; I said as if soothing a frightened dog, keeping my strokes light as if afraid of tearing that leather-soft scaly skin. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t hurt you &ndash; and I&rsquo;ll thank you to return the favour.&rdquo;
 
Wood chuckled. &ldquo;Used to charge the bravest fellows a shilling extra to pet her, but they were too rough &ndash; kept grabbing her like they wanted to wrestle or throttle poor Naggie. She&rsquo;s much happier as a retired rat-catcher, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
 
When I withdrew my hand, Wood let go of Nag after giving the cobra a bit of ham from his sandwich. She poured onto the floor and was gone in seconds.
 
&ldquo;She even saved me from an attack, once,&rdquo; Wood said, watching her go. &ldquo;I was coming home from my performance and some alley-rat stuck a knife under my nose demanding my basket. I gave it to him.&rdquo;
 
Both of us roared. I hardly needed Wood to describe the shriek his would-be assailant made when he opened his prize, nor the way he&rsquo;d looked as he&rsquo;d fled leaving his knife behind.
 
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen a poisonous snake used as a murder weapon,&rdquo; I said, still laughing, &ldquo;and I know they&rsquo;re used as treasure-guards in Indian palaces. But this may be the first time I&rsquo;ve heard of one saving a man.&rdquo;
 
&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s true. She saved me that night.&rdquo; Wood stared thoughtfully into the fire that he kept blazing in every weather, even the hottest part of summer. &ldquo;A lot of people have saved me, Watson. You among them. I&rsquo;m a lot luckier than I ever thought I was, after all.&rdquo; He exhaled. &ldquo;I only wish I could ease your life a little, the way you&rsquo;ve done mine. You&rsquo;re marching through your own ravine right now.&rdquo;
 
I pinched my lips together. He was right; these days I felt as if I walked in perpetual mourning. &ldquo;This does help, Wood. These visits, the talks. I look forward to them. It&rsquo;s the only thing I anticipate with pleasure any more.&rdquo; Teddy snuffled at my waxed paper, looking for remnants of my lunch, and I stroked his rough furry back &ndash; a rougher back than his ophidian flatmate.
 
I&rsquo;d have deduced Wood for a former soldier for nothing else but his next gesture. He leaned over and offered me a cigarette. Smiling my thanks, I put it to my lips.
 
&ldquo;Just say the word, Captain,&rdquo; Corporal Wood said, striking a match for me as well, &ldquo;and we head for the Musket and Shot, get absolutely boiled-owl and start throwing punches at the youngsters. Nothing better for clearing the head.&rdquo;
 
I laughed again for the second time that day &ndash; the second time that month. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll keep that in mind, Corporal.&rdquo;

&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a very &hellip; vivid story, dear.&rdquo; Mummy stared, eyes wide, at the paper handed her by her beaming son.

&ldquo;I drew the pictures too!&rdquo; Johnny said.

&ldquo;Yeeees.&rdquo; Mummy held the page out at arm&rsquo;s length.

&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, Mummy, the paints are dry.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Do you have <u>any</u> red left, Johnny?&rdquo;

&ldquo;Just a little. I had to make the murder look real.&rdquo; The proud child pointed. &ldquo;See the way it drips from the word REVENGE on the wall? He was a very bad man. So the man who killed him is a <i>good </i>man.&rdquo;

Mummy kissed him and picked up the gin."

For this one I&rsquo;m choosing another of Elementary&rsquo;s honorary &quot;dogs&quot;; this story is part of my <a href=""http://archiveofourown.org/series/129777"">Joan&rsquo;s Beez</a> series.

<lj-cut text=""Story below the cut."">
Sherlock muttered an oath, wrestling with the beehive excluder.

&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; Watson asked. It was a lovely day, so she was up on the roof with a folder from their latest case.

&ldquo;Trying to &hellip; reach &hellip; the queen,&rdquo; Sherlock grated. &ldquo;Damn thing&rsquo;s &hellip; stuck.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you say so?&rdquo; Joan set down the papers and bowed her head for a moment.

One big bee wriggled out of the panel in Sherlock&rsquo;s hands and flew over to Joan, landing atop her head.

&ldquo;Here she is.&rdquo; Joan picked up the folder and continued her reading &ndash; biting down hard on the grin she wanted to make at Sherlock&rsquo;s expression.

She saw her partner approach gingerly, as if Joan and the queen bee were a bomb set to go off. Perhaps they were, in a mental sense of the word. She could almost see Sherlock eliminating the impossible. Except that this just about qualified as impossible.

Another conversation took place, couched entirely in scents and sub-rosa speech:

<i><u>Your Solitude, please go with my drone.</u></i>

<i>Zzzz&hellip; Well, I&rsquo;ll do it but I won&rsquo;t like it. I still don&rsquo;t trust him, Joanie. What about that bad queen of his? Ain&rsquo;t right, him buzzin&rsquo; off after another fuckin&rsquo; queen.</i>

<i><u>We have tapped heads about this, One. He let me know about his bad queen. He won&rsquo;t go to her. He likes me as queen better, and that queen wants to kill me. </u></i>

<i>No shit &ndash; it&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;d do if another queen tried takin&rsquo; over <u>my</u> home. Why didn&rsquo;t you sting that bitch when you had a chance?</i>

<i><u>My species doesn&rsquo;t sting, we isolate. A queen without a hive is as good as dead.</u></i>

<i>All right. But just say the word and I go after her myself, with all my girls. </i>

<i><u>I&rsquo;ll remember. Thank you, Your Solitude.</u></i>

She felt Sherlock&rsquo;s bare fingers lightly brushing the top of her head to gather the <i>Euglossia watsonia</i> queen into his hand. He was ungloved. He clearly knew that no ordinary beekeeping protocol was called for in this case.

She kept reading the file, taking notes, while her partner took care of his bee business. Approximately ten minutes later she felt him sit down next to her, harder than usual.

&ldquo;The only theory I have been able to produce,&rdquo; he said in a semblance of his usual voice, &ldquo;is that this new species is unusually intelligent and highly trainable, and that you have spent time up here practicing such a manoeuver.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Very close to the truth,&rdquo; Watson replied. &ldquo;It would be closer to say that this breed is fiercely loyal to me, and is attracted to my scent. They go into swarm or fighting mode when they sense fear in my sweat.&rdquo;

She saw his thoughts at work. &ldquo; &rsquo;Those damn bugs&rsquo;,&rdquo; he quoted. &ldquo;That hired myrmidon who would have shot you dead in that alley if not for&hellip;&rdquo;

&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; No point in covering it now. &ldquo;Those bees you accidentally bred saved my life.&rdquo;

Sherlock exhaled. Joan kept pretending to read her file. Let <i>him</i> deal with the sensation of having fallen down the rabbit hole for once.

He finally broke the silence between them. &ldquo;Watson. I &hellip; must say that I feel a good deal more at ease, knowing that there is more than one living creature in this building for whom your safety is of paramount concern.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Imagine how <u>I</u> feel about it,&rdquo; Joan added wryly. &ldquo;And it doesn&rsquo;t seem as patronizing, having a squad of female workers as bodyguards, than if you were hovering around behind me all the time.&rdquo;

&ldquo;And far less likely to tip off adversaries than would be another human.&rdquo; Sherlock was already assimilating the new information.

Give him a few seconds and he would begin incorporating it into his plans&hellip;

&ldquo;Is there any way they can be induced to carry messages from you to me? Because that would be extremely helpful should our phones be offline for any reason.&rdquo;

And there it was. Unbelievable. Processing. Believed. Incorporated.

&ldquo;No, Sherlock, they can NOT carry messages from me to you,&rdquo; Watson snapped. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be ridiculous. They can&rsquo;t communicate with you.&rdquo; She concentrated on her scent, this time on the one that attracted drones. <i><u>Up here</u>.</i>

&nbsp;&ldquo;Ah, of course,&rdquo; he said too quickly, with just a thread of disappointment.

<i>Coming, Joanie!</i>

Sherlock cocked his head, stared toward the partly-open door that led back downstairs. &ldquo;Watson, do you hear&hellip;?&rdquo;

A steady humming noise became louder and resolved itself as a swarm of large yellow drones emerging from that door &ndash; all of them tethered to a small wooden hull like a gondola. At the gondola&rsquo;s helm was a tortoise in a tiny leather aviator&rsquo;s cap and goggles. The entire bizarre airship sailed over to hover before both humans.

&ldquo;If you want to send <i>messages</i>,&rdquo; Joan added, as if explaining first-grade science, &ldquo;you write a note and have Clyde deliver it.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Damn my leg!&rdquo;

I stopped under a tree that was dangerously laden with snow, but too full of anger and self-loathing at my body&rsquo;s weakness to care at present.

I should not have accepted my friend&rsquo;s invitation to join him in the country for this case when I had still not recovered from my war injuries. I was slowing down the pursuit, as I&rsquo;d feared. The cold was like a knife straight through my thigh in the precise path of the bullet that had struck me whilst I had been unconscious with pain and blood-loss across Murray&rsquo;s horse. I had still not truly acclimated myself to English weather after my sub-Continent service. Now I was up to mid-shins in the snow that blanketed the countryside darkening with early-winter sunset; and now that I had been forced to halt my stride across country, the cold began to sink into my bones. I gripped my treacherous lower limb as if wishing to throttle the contemptible weakling.

&ldquo;Watson?&rdquo; Holmes&rsquo; voice, getting closer. No, he was returning for me, that I could not allow.

&ldquo;Go!&rdquo; I waved a hand in his direction, not looking away from where the other hand vainly kneaded at the knotted, damaged muscle. &ldquo;The station-master must be warned! It&rsquo;s just a twinge, I&rsquo;ll be along presently. Time is precious.&rdquo;

A pause. I kept my teeth locked so that he would not hear them chatter; I dreaded the thought of him staying &ndash; or worse, assisting me, and me slowing him down like an anchor chained to his ankle when he needed speed.

&ldquo;Very well. Then keep this for me.&rdquo;

Warmth billowed around my shoulders and settled close about me like an embrace. The cold retreated at once.

I looked up in time to see Sherlock Holmes finish settling his heavy wool Inverness cape about me. He smiled at my expression. &ldquo;The race to the station should keep me warm enough, should it not?&rdquo;

I beamed. My leg still hurt abominably, but every other part of me was warm. &ldquo;<u>And</u> he&rsquo;ll have tea for you. Go.&rdquo;

He did so with an alacrity that filled me with relief even as he quickly vanished from sight, leaving me alone in a darkening snowy woods. He trusted me to care for myself until he could return, or to make my way back to the inn on my own. And he had not left me unprotected.

***

When my friend Mr. Sherlock Holmes goes out and about London on his daily business, or heads out for a meal and entertainment in the evening, he is a man of impeccable sartorial elegance. However, rather to his annoyance, Mr. Paget repeatedly used my friend&rsquo;s durable, practical country-wear as the model for his illustrations of my stories; this outfit &ndash; deerstalker, Ulster, Inverness &ndash; became irreparably fixed in the public&rsquo;s mind with how my friend appears, giving Holmes the image of a bumpkin from the North country who wears his grouse-hunting outfit to an opera in the West End.

Yet no matter what ludicrous situation in which I see that outfit &ndash; in an illustration by Paget or his successors for a crime story set in London, on the stage(!) or in music-hall lampoons &ndash; I can never look at that Inverness cape without feeling a flood of affection, and a return of the warmth and trust it represented to me from the very first time I saw him wear it.

<lj-cut text=""Story below the cut"">We felt the explosion all the way across the dock just as we saw the pork warehouse ignite.

Sweet Jesus, they were there (<i>he</i> was there). And if they were there they were dead in that inferno.

I ran. The smell &ndash; gas, burnt wood, charred pork &ndash; hit but I never slowed, my stomach in knots at what I was going to find.

We&rsquo;d been given orders: arrest them both on sight. &ldquo;Word&rsquo;s from above,&rdquo; was all the governor would say. I knew that meant Lord Coward, but as I ain&rsquo;t stupid I said nothing. It was my duty to clap the darbies on both men. If they lived.

<i>He</i> lived. It was a sheer bloody miracle. He lay groaning outside that destroyed warehouse. He was alone. Had he been alone? He&rsquo;d been doing more and more work without his bull-pup along (a handsome man, but so cold and unfeeling to him).

He could move, stunned by the blast though he was. I helped him up (my arms around him for a few precious seconds). That dazed look in those dark eyes that shifted to the warehouse, his lips almost forming a &ldquo;W&rdquo;&hellip; Oh Christ, Watson <i>had</i> been in there and that meant Watson was dead (his heart will break).

He sagged in my arms momentarily, straightened again. He hadn&rsquo;t been in the warehouse but the blast had dazed him, likely damaged his hearing as well. I could feel him gathering himself to run into that ruin, to his own ruination (the governor was right behind me, would be here in moments, would put him in irons just as he found Watson&rsquo;s charred corpse).

I&rsquo;m already going to Hell for being a mandrake, why not add disobeying a superior and lying to the charges? I told him about the order for his arrest, told him who&rsquo;d issued it, and lied that Watson was alive. &ldquo;Just get out of here, sir. Go, sir, go!&rdquo; I pushed him away, sent him running.

I turned and almost swallowed my heart. The governor was right there, picking through the spilled bricks, and looking right at me. He&rsquo;d been right bloody there. He&rsquo;d seen my treason to the strength. God dammit, he could still see <i>him</i> running away, disappearing in an alleyway, from where he stood. He looked at me, looking like an old man.

I drew a breath, ready to confess and lose everything (thank God I&rsquo;ve got no wife, imaginary chambermaid or not, nor no kids to starve for my stupidity).

&ldquo;Clark, keep the civilians away while we investigate.&rdquo; And the governor turned his back on me and went into the warehouse.

I stared after his back. He&rsquo;d seen him running away, he had to. He&rsquo;d seen me help him run away. And he was acting like &hellip; like he didn&rsquo;t want to arrest him either.

I turned away, shaking, ready to pace the perimeter of the damage. Two miracles in one night. A pervert and a traitor to the badge didn&rsquo;t have the right to pray for a third &ndash; except that I&rsquo;d seen that lost look in those beautiful dark eyes of his.

I crossed myself fast, bowed my head as if searching the ground. Patron of lost causes. <i>St. Jude, please. Please &ndash; </i>

&ldquo;Oy!&rdquo; Constable Wilkins bellowed from the warehouse. &ldquo;Dr. Watson&#39;s alive!&rdquo;</lj-cut>"

<b>Summary: </b>Sometimes you have to amputate a gangrenous limb<b>.</b>
<b>Author&#39;s Notes: </b>For the 2015 July Watson&#39;s Woes Promptfest prompt #9<i>, <b>Healer&#39;s Choice</b>. One person Watson chose not to save.</i> The basis for this story comes from a vivid dream a friend had last week and told me (minus the part in the dream where I apparently ran into the room screaming that that&rsquo;s not how the story goes).

<lj-cut text=""Story below the cut."">
1348. 1665. 2015. Modern medicine had delayed the return of the horror by nearly a century, but this particular Horseman would not be halted.
 
King Charles and the princes&rsquo; families had been whisked away to parts unknown after the Queen and Prince had succumbed in two days. Heathrow, Gatwick, Stansted and Luton became the wards for the dying, the grounded liners repurposed as mobile hospital wings.&nbsp; The M4 and northern segment of M25 was the unofficial quarantine fence for the Infection (what a very British way of referring to such a devastating epidemic). The only thing that spread faster was the hysteria and panic that engulfed London and a good part of the south of England and Europe (some British holiday-goers and exptatriates had been killed or isolated by French or Spanish fearful of the death returning to their shores). Long-abandoned furnaces and refineries had been restarted to accommodate the sheer numbers of corpses requiring immediate cremation.
 
This current strain of the Great Mortality laughed at antibiotics. It also brought new symptoms in addition to the traditional ones of enlarged lymph nodes under the arms and between the thighs, chills, fever, migraine and abdominal pain &ndash; chief among them the terrifying white eyes as vitreous haemorrhage blinded the sufferer, a precursor to the last hours of the fatal course (agonizing headaches, raving dementia, and then out on the kerb in a goddamn bin for the trucks to take away).
 
People had been repurposed as well, not just the old smelting furnaces and the dustman&rsquo;s trucks. Greg Lestrade and other still-walking Yarders provided security and evacuation control; Lestrade&rsquo;s eyes were not white but they saw only his children, both gone to the Coryton Refinery.
 
In the last three months John Watson regained the shell he had worn throughout his tours in Afghanistan, staring at Hell past the haz-mat suit and face mask he perpetually wore now, the modern oilcloth robe and leather beak of the plague physician. Sherlock was away all the time now too, locked in bouts of shouting with (at) Mycroft, or huddled in his chair buried in his mind-palace, racing to find information on vectors and triggers to uncover the mystery of this serial killer. John went armed every day, and he only came back to Baker Street for fresh ammo and tea; violent mobs and dying infected alike required this last doctor&rsquo;s implement far too often.
 
Then came the morning when Sherlock winced when raising his tea-mug to his lips. John had no memory of dashing away the mug, nor of forcibly tearing open his shouting, struggling flatmate&rsquo;s shirt as he crouched on top of him on the floor; he only remembered seeing the black buboes. <i>Forty-eight hours from first manifestation </i>his mind rattled out on autopilot,<i> two days two days two days&hellip;</i>
 
Sherlock&rsquo;s eyes read his own &ndash; his diagnosis, his sentence, the click of the stopwatch in his mind. &ldquo;John, go-&ldquo;
 
&ldquo;Fuck yourself, I&rsquo;m staying here.&rdquo; John slapped off his radio, cutting off the perpetual emergency chatter. He was already stripping off the rest of Sherlock&rsquo;s clothes, dragging him upright.
 
&ldquo;John this is the kind of thing that gets you tried for war crimes afterward &ndash;&rdquo;
 
&ldquo;Shut UP, Sherlock.&rdquo; John hauled the taller man stumbling toward the shower in a grip he&rsquo;d clearly learned in the Army for moving an unconscious body.
 
&ldquo;John, I can wash myself!&rdquo; As if cleanliness would do anything now beyond delaying the inevitable.
 
&ldquo;Then do so. Head to heels, I want you covered in soap, bottoms of the feet and between the toes too before you&rsquo;re done. I&rsquo;m starting the kettle and you&rsquo;re drinking everything I give you, no questions or I strap you down and goddamn IV you.&rdquo; John started the shower before Sherlock had removed his pyjama trousers and was off to the kitchen to fill the kettle from one of the water-cooler jugs he&rsquo;d salvaged from a warehouse. Both men had finally learned in the last month not to shout a dead woman&rsquo;s name when they needed tea. John appeared with the teapot and large mug in time to see the naked man stumble getting back into bed, displaying the groin buboes as well.
 
Sherlock had beaten odds before, had tricked others into thinking he was dying or dead. This grinning beast would not be tricked. &nbsp;The Army-medic shell John wore ticked off the symptoms as they appeared, almost pleased that Sherlock was considerate enough to acquire them in precise order because it made note-taking on the latest vector so easy.
 
John ate and slept in the haz-mat suit, lying next to Sherlock on the bed for his cat-naps so that the shivers or twists of pain woke him instantly. Sleeping in one long piece of time, eating in social settings, had gone away with the first truckload to the smelting works.
 
Sherlock&rsquo;s eyes stared at the ceiling as he raced through the mind-palace, searching for the cause as if seeking a bomb&rsquo;s trigger before the countdown reached zero. John forced tea, broth, soup down him, washed him down, cleaned up the vomit, emptied the bedpan and his own excretions into a binbag in a plastic tub. He knew he was blowing on a damp lump of wood that bore a single feeble, flickering ember. He did not stop blowing.
 
&ldquo;For god&rsquo;s sake, John,&rdquo; Sherlock whispered once, &ldquo;protect yourself.&rdquo;
 
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll goddamn protect myself when I goddamn need it.&rdquo; John was up to his knees in a flooding cellar, boarding up everything, trying to keep the water out even as it gushed in at every crack and seam, because he was going to need to function afterward and if he let any more in he would not function at all when, when. Everything on him was covered; his eyes were behind goggles, but that door he could never keep shut from the man dying under his hands. Sherlock saw, and because Sherlock was his friend he said nothing.
 
Four a.m. and Sherlock twisted himself into a cry, demanding paper, pencil, his phone, he had it he needed to tell Mycroft before before oh God my head my head John make it stop &ndash;
 
Paper, pencil slapped down. Sherlock turned his head to vomit onto the bedclothes to save the paper he scrawled with chemical symbols that Dr. Watson&#39;s mind translated &ndash; counter-agent, refinement, immunization. His body heaved, and two pain-tears landed on the paper, but then it was done and Sherlock fell back, moaning and arching. &ldquo;Go. Go. Mycroft.&rdquo;
 
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not leaving you till you&rsquo;re &ndash;&rdquo; John&rsquo;s mouth snapped shut behind the face-mask, the plague-doctor&rsquo;s beak. He&rsquo;d almost used the word.
 
&ldquo;John, I am dead and you fucking know it. Get this to Mycroft. Stay here and die, or go and save London. Save. London. Oh G&ndash; !&rdquo;
 
John looked down into white eyes as a scream of pain hit him full in the face.
 
Clang.
 
Dr. Watson snatched the paper from the dying man&rsquo;s clenching hand, stuffed it into the suit&rsquo;s front pouch. One last doctor&rsquo;s implement; one last capsule for the patient, chambered.
 
Muzzle between the vector&rsquo;s white open eyes.
 
Bang.
 
Suited, equipped, pack on his back, the answer in his belly, the plague-doctor left the ward. Slam, silver X on the door in spray paint under the brass street number, the number &ldquo;1&rdquo; beneath, circled, for the bin-men.

And the hero who would save 2 million lives set out for the Diogenes Club at a dead run.

<lj-cut text=""Story below the cut."">&ldquo;What good&rsquo;ll it do keeping an eye on me, Sheriff?&rdquo; Sutton said bitterly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a dead man already, you&rsquo;re just waiting for the hemp-broker to show up.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Man&rsquo;s got a point,&rdquo; Doc said in his soft Georgia drawl. &ldquo;Crazy dance we&rsquo;re calling, Lock.&rdquo;

A puff of smoke belched out from under the broad brim of the black hat tipped over the face of the long-legged man perched in a tipped-back chair, feet on the cold stove. &ldquo;A decent description of the rule of law, Doc. And as I recall, it was the &lsquo;crazy&rsquo; part that made you sign up for this.&rdquo;

Doc pursed his lips, nodded, and turned to spit his cigar-end into the cuspidor between the two men&rsquo;s chairs. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t say as I disagree. If you&rsquo;d turned Cartwright over to us instead of shooting him yourself, Sutton, I&rsquo;d a shaken your hand instead of putting on the cuffs. Never liked that son-of-a-bitch. But you shot him, so we wait for the judge to get here and convict you, and then we hang you good and legal for murder. Waste of time, if you ask me.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Doc&rsquo;s a good deal less finicky than I am about who lives and who dies.&rdquo; The pipe-stem under the black hat-brim tipped a little, probably from Sheriff Lock grinning. &ldquo;I could unlock that cell and let you out, but that&rsquo;d just lead to an even faster trial than the one you&rsquo;re entitled to get.&rdquo;

As if to emphasize the sheriff&rsquo;s words, the door pounded once again. &ldquo;Let &lsquo;im out, Sheriff Lock!&rdquo; a man roared. Four or five others took up a similar cry.

Sutton let go of the bars so abruptly that they clanged once, and huddled back on his cot, eyes wide.

&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll be Cartwright&rsquo;s hired hands.&rdquo; Lock didn&rsquo;t lift his black hat-brim from over his eyes, nor straighten out his chair from its tilted-back position. &ldquo;You really ought to have let Ben pay them for the month before settling your score, Sutton. Doc, go talk to them.&rdquo;

&ldquo;All right, Sheriff.&rdquo; Doc stood and walked to the door.

&ldquo;Talking to a lynch mob?&rdquo; Sutton shook his head. &ldquo;What the hell can you say &ndash;&rdquo;

Doc yanked the shotgun off the wall, flung open the door and fired one round straight into the crowd. He slammed the door on the screaming and panic outside and walked back to put the duck-gun back on the wall. The noise outside had already dispersed into scattered men yelling and cursing.

&ldquo;Doc has a way with words,&rdquo; said the hat.

Doc hunkered down under his desk, fumbling around. &ldquo;Where the hell&rsquo;d I put that blame thing &ndash; there it is.&rdquo; A cry of pain from outside. &ldquo;Hold yer goddamn horses, I&rsquo;m coming!&rdquo; Doc yelled. He straightened, holding a gator-skin doctor&rsquo;s bag, and walked back to the door. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make me shoot y&rsquo;all while I&rsquo;m doing this!&rdquo; Doc bellowed through the door before going outside to treat the wounds he&rsquo;d just caused.

Sutton stared after the sheriff&rsquo;s gunman, once again clinging to the bars of his cell.

&ldquo;Yup,&rdquo; the lanky figure said. Sheriff Lock had not moved from his chair or even tipped his hat back. &ldquo;I reckon that&rsquo;s just about as crazy as us saving your life so you can get hanged later. Go figure medicine <i>or</i> the law.&rdquo;</lj-cut>"

Whether it&#39;s a client gone stalkerish or a secret admirer who won&#39;t take a hint, one of the characters must cope with unwanted advances. How he/she deals with it and what happens is up to you. </i>This story is a POV-change version of <a href=""http://archiveofourown.org/works/2706311"">this story of mine</a> but can be read on its own, and is not explicit.

<lj-cut text=""Story below the cut."">
There are times when it is damnably inconvenient to be an invert. The usual, larger reasons apply, of course &ndash; I am unable to wear a ring that proudly proclaims my status, I cannot be joined to my dear one in a church, nor can we be treated with the deference given a married couple by a country for which he has fought and been wounded and which I defend from the wickedness and injustice of crime. But other, smaller barbs wound as well; I cannot escort my beloved on my arm at a social gathering, nor take him onto a dance floor to show all present who is the master at this craft, nor help him into a carriage not out of necessity but out of possession and affection.
 
And then there are clients like Mrs. St. Clair.
 
The woman was the very soul of respectability and propriety as she greeted me in the sitting room where Billy had led her in, exhibiting all proper courtesy and deference. Yet even as she laid out the particulars of her adventure in London on Monday, her tea untouched, I sensed that something was amiss. This was no woman exhibiting a passionate affection for her husband, nor one distraught by dread. Rather, the signs were there, but they were overshadowed by other portends &ndash; her eyes that lingered on my shoulders and hands the few times they left my face (and displaying a look one does not associate with a worried wife), her accelerated breathing, the softer and breathier tone of her voice as the interview progressed. Her behaviour was a complete puzzlement to me &ndash; until I imagined how I would fill with rage were she to turn such attentions to Watson, and then I understood what she was doing.
 
Ordinarily I would not have considered going out on an extended case without my Boswell, and Watson is invaluable in such matters that involve the fair sex &ndash; his ability to read women&rsquo;s body language and other unspoken cues is far superior to mine, and he could have warned me or even have deflected the lady&rsquo;s attentions to himself with his dashing good looks and chivalrous manner that would have easily eclipsed my own set of geometric angles masquerading as a face. However, my lovely man was away in the country attending to an old friend&rsquo;s summertime ailment and would not be back in London for some days. Further, the woman&rsquo;s case was a legitimate grievance and there were points about it that had caught my attention.
 
The case itself seemed sadly cut-and-dried: discern the reason for respectable city-worker Neville St. Clair&rsquo;s being seen in a vile Limehouse opium den moments before his disappearance, and determine the cause and culprit behind said disappearance (and very likely death). My own discomfort at Mrs. St. Clair&rsquo;s attention was irrelevant. This was not a case which I could solve from my armchair; I would need firstly to see the man&rsquo;s home and find what clues might be hiding there and secondly to infiltrate the Bar of Gold, observe the proprietor and his lackeys, and report on my success (or lack thereof) to the distraught wife. I already suspected that the opium den would be the least unpleasant part of this case.
 
I joined Mrs. St. Clair in the dog-cart she had hired and we set out for Lee within the hour. I was sure that I would only require a few days&rsquo; observation and detection to find the truth of what promised to be an unhappy conclusion. I examined The Cedars, its grounds and the staff; all spoke of a respectable upper-middle class City man. Money was not the source of any problems; had debt been an issue, the stable-lad and other servants would be grumbling about delayed or scanty wages.
 
I had another problem, however. During our drive to Lee, Mrs. St. Clair continued to look at me in a manner that ought to be partially-concealed by a debutante&rsquo;s fan at a cotillion. I was grateful that the cart seat was wide enough to accommodate us both with plenty of room between, and that a forward-facing driver sat between us. But by the time I had edged away from the middle for the third time in order to maintain that space between us, I cursed my curiosity that drove me to take the case. Bitterly I reflected that her eyes might have been turned aside, had I only been able conspicuously to display a wedding ring gleaming on the hands that enthralled her so. She had come to me, and so was aware of my fame and reputation: Sherlock Holmes, eccentric and confirmed bachelor, never seen in the company of any woman. To dissuade her by any protest of misanthropy or shyness, lack of social skills or nerve, would only encourage her to take me as a challenge. But to tell the truth would be fatal, both for myself and for my <i>&eacute;poux de le coeur</i> (even if I swore that I alone bore the mark of Sodom on my brow, suspicion would instantly fall upon my long-time associate as well). If I had not seen the change in her manner toward me after she had met me, I would have entertained the possibility that she had arranged to have her husband murdered solely to secure my services and bring me into her orbit.
 
After my inspection of The Cedars, I feigned the need to retreat to utter privacy where I could begin to apply my disguise as a dissipated opium-eater to search for the woman&rsquo;s lawfully-wed spouse. Mrs. St. Clair reminded me unnecessarily that the room she&rsquo;d given me was a double-bedded one.
 
A sleepless night lends <i>veritas</i> to one&rsquo;s persona as a drug addict. So does fast &ndash; I all but fled to the stable at the gleam in her eyes (and the frilliness of her pink bed-gown) as she told me that breakfast was ready in the private nook normally occupied only by the happy couple. Taking the dog-cart, I dashed from the lovely homes of the bourgeoisie, yearning for the Limehouse alleys and docks.
 
I then spent a week in an opium den, trying to keep my wits about me amid the foul-sweet smoke and surrounded by many who&rsquo;d pay for the privilege of slitting Sherlock Holmes&rsquo; throat, whilst attempting to deduce the Lascar&rsquo;s role in this domestic tragedy and the whereabouts of the man responsible for the disappearance of Neville St. Clair &ndash; and atop everything else, dread building like a mountainside of snow at the thought of Mrs. St. Clair waiting for my report.
 
Four days into my work, I risked my disguise and my life to send a telegram to Baker Street. AT BAR OF GOLD COME AT ONCE SH. Watson would surely be home by now, and my nervous anticipation of Mrs. St. Clair mixed with my dread at what must surely be the ending of this business. I needed his expertise with women, his sure hand with distraught clients, and his moral support.  
 
(I laughed out loud when I read Watson&#39;s account of our case afterward &ndash; especially the whole-cloth fabrication of Isa Whitney which led to an unbelievably coincidental reunion in the Bar of Gold. &ldquo;Because a happily-married man does not leave hearth and wife at bed-time to hare off to an opium den at his bachelor friend&rsquo;s enigmatic behest, Holmes, that&rsquo;s why,&rdquo; he had responded tartly in response to my laughter.)
 
That beloved baritone softly calling for an imaginary friend was the first lightening of my heart in a week. As Watson passed me &ndash; his eye-flicker letting me know that he had recognised me &ndash; I muttered a low &ldquo;Outside, five minutes,&rdquo; without looking away from my brazier as if lost in smoke-dreams. I settled my account for my lodgings with the Lascar and soon was out in the foul-smelling dock air laughing beside the best man in London. He too had hungered for me &ndash; that also I read in his eyes &ndash; but as I filled him in on the case during our journey to Lee I saw the change in his demeanour as the case absorbed his thoughts to the detriment of baser urges (this did not prevent me from mourning the hand that left my knee to retake the reins).
 
How I blessed my instincts for sending for my friend, when both of us saw Mrs. St. Clair silhouetted in the lamp-lit doorway of The Cedars wearing less, and more feminine attire, than I had seen her wear before &ndash; a frilly confection in muslin and chiffon. She stood with her figure outlined against the flood of light, one hand upon the door, one half-raised in her eagerness, her body slightly bent, her head and face protruded, with eager eyes and parted lips, a standing question. Her face was all alight as she looked at me, as one starving regards a banquet.
 
Then Watson moved away from behind me, enough for the door-light to fall upon him, and Mrs. St. Clair&rsquo;s whole body sank in on itself as she gave a groan. &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; she cried, despair in her face. &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
 
I should not have taken as much malicious pleasure in seeing her thwarted as I did. No doubt it was partially engendered by resentment that I would give my right arm for the legitimacy of a union that she, a legally-married woman, was willing to toss aside for the attentions of a stranger with un-beringed hands. However, I am above all other things a professional, and with a major impediment deflected I once again turned my thoughts toward the solution of Neville St. Clair&rsquo;s disappearance. With little ado I whisked myself and Watson into that doubly-damned double-bedded room of hers for the rest of the night. Watson had observed and correctly deduced her behavior towards me, and his presence was a great comfort that long sleepless night.
 
The solution to the case Watson&#39;s readers already know. (Precisely <i>how</i> I solved the problem &ndash; I did truthfully tell Inspector Bradstreet that it had involved five pillows and a bit of shag &ndash; is not fit reading material for mixed company.)

When we left the Cedars &ndash; longing for sleep, eager for breakfast, pleased at our reunion &ndash; I had every hope that Mrs. St. Clair would soon be far too occupied with learning the truth behind the man she married at the same time that they faced the loss of the income that had provided their comfortable lifestyle. Human nature is a highly predictable thing; I knew that before a week had passed my role in this uncovered deception and descent would transform her attraction to me into resentment if not outright loathing. I was far too tired to throw back my head and laugh, but I chuckled, and may have leaned a little closer to my dear man even as I coaxed the mare to go a little faster as she took us home.

<lj-cut text=""Story below the cut."">
&ldquo;Bloody nannies is what we are,&rdquo; Bobbie said disgustedly around her cigar stub, grimy chin on her even dirtier crossed forearms jutting out of her ill-fitting shirt on the windowsill opposite the shanty with a&nbsp; line of equally grubby people out the door. &ldquo;Dunno why Mr. Holmes even lets &lsquo;im come out our way if &lsquo;e&rsquo;s no good fightin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
 
&ldquo;Mr. &lsquo;Olmes give us a shillin each to stay wiv &lsquo;im.&rdquo; Big George wiped his nose on his sleeve for the hundredth time that hour. He could only look out the window by standing on a large box. &ldquo;A &lsquo;ole shillin. Each.&rdquo;
 
Mac tested his knife-blade against his thumb. &ldquo;Doc can fight &ndash; I seen &lsquo;im fight like a tiger, oncet, when three was after &lsquo;is bag. Bam bam bam, and they was down by the time I ran arfway down the block to &lsquo;im. Just like a bloody tiger in the zoo, &lsquo;e was.&rdquo;
 
&ldquo;Then why us?&rdquo; Bobbie squirmed, clearly itching to go back to the pool parlour or pub to spend her gains. &ldquo;Why&rsquo;d Mr. &lsquo;Olmes tell us to follow him?&rdquo;
 
&ldquo;River Street gang got &lsquo;im a while back &ndash; took a &lsquo;ole pack o&rsquo; those dogs to pull that tiger down.&rdquo; Mac stowed his knife and found a cigarette on his person. &ldquo;Give us a light, Bobs.&rdquo;
 
Bobbie squawked an oath not normally emitted from the mouths of well-bred ladies. &ldquo;Jake bloody Willerton&rsquo;s lot? Why the &lsquo;ell&rsquo;s he still alive?&rdquo;
 
Mac lit his cigarette with a match deftly stolen from his fellow Irregular&rsquo;s pocket, and with an insouciance vainly attempted by men old enough to shave. &ldquo;Peelers got Jake that night and let the Doc go. Doc was bad sick after that for a long time. And the second Doc&rsquo;s ribs was better and &lsquo;e wasn&rsquo;t coughing like a &lsquo;ole charity ward, back &lsquo;e comes here. That&rsquo;s when &lsquo;Imself sent for us.&rdquo;
 
A very loud, very wet sniff. &ldquo;Gave us a &lsquo;ole shillin. Each.&rdquo;
 
&ldquo;&rsquo;Cos the Doc&rsquo;s too stupid to stay away?&rdquo; Bobbie clenched her teeth around the cigar as a few people left the shanty, and the line moved a few people forward. &ldquo;Even the fucking peelers stay outta &lsquo;ere. And Doc ain&rsquo;t gettin&rsquo; no money from that lot.&rdquo;
 
Mac exhaled his puff of smoke with a laugh. &ldquo;Axed Mr. &lsquo;Olmes that myself. Told &lsquo;im he&rsquo;s gotta keep Doc from coming here. Says &lsquo;e <i>wishes</i> &lsquo;e could make Doc stop comin&rsquo; here. But Doc&rsquo;s a doc &ndash; &lsquo;e sees someone hurt &lsquo;e just tries to fix it. Even some tosser what beat Mr. &lsquo;Olmes and tried to shoot &lsquo;im &ndash; first thing Doc does when the tosser&rsquo;s hurt is get down and try to fix him.&rdquo;
 
&ldquo;Bloody nutter,&rdquo; Bobbie sneered.
 
&ldquo;&rsquo;E&rsquo;s a <i>brave</i> bloody nutter.&rdquo;
 
Shouts from the shanty. A woman screaming, small children&rsquo;s cries. Over it all, a man&rsquo;s drunken roar.
 
Mac spit out his cigarette end. &ldquo;Fuckin&rsquo; &lsquo;ell, that&rsquo;s Bob Whitstable! George! Go!&rdquo;
 
The tiny boy was out the door in the next moment &ndash; the only thing that ran faster than his nose was his legs.
 
Mac and Bobbie were not far behind the messenger boy, pushing through the clamoring throng; Bobbie and Mac both had their knives out and grim looks on their faces. &ldquo;Move!&rdquo; Mac roared at the line of patients &ndash; mostly women and children &ndash; who moved out of his way, frightened by the sound.
 
The two forced their way into the tiny hovel and nearly tripped over a mountain of a body, poorly lit by the one oil lamp on a table by the open doctor&rsquo;s bag: the aforementioned Bob Whitstable, in the unconscious flesh. His haggard wife and a mob of their brats hovered round, their screaming now a ragged chorus of sobs.
 
&ldquo;Good afternoon, Mac, Miss Knight &ndash; excuse me, Bobbie.&rdquo; Dr. Watson was still standing over the insensate brute, fists unclenching. He was the calmest person in the hovel. &ldquo;Your concern is appreciated but not needed at the present time. This was only one bully threatening a woman, and I cannot abide bullies.&rdquo; He sighed. &ldquo;No doubt Big George is halfway to Baker Street by now with the missive that I&rsquo;m once again in mortal danger.&rdquo;
 
Mac shrugged, grinning. &ldquo;Big George says exactly what we tell &lsquo;im. &lsquo;E&rsquo;ll say &lsquo;It&rsquo;s Bob Whitstable&rsquo; and that&rsquo;s it.&rdquo;
 
The doctor grinned ruefully himself. &ldquo;In that case, I may be safe. Mr. Holmes always does say that that little fellow is more accurate than a telegram. And he knows I can hold my own against one opponent.&rdquo;
 
&ldquo;You hit Da!&rdquo; one small Whitstable cried. &ldquo;I hate you!&rdquo; His mother shushed him.
 
&ldquo;He tried to hit your mother, Master &hellip; er, Bill?&rdquo; A nod from the shaking mother. &ldquo;Bill. I will not allow such things in my waiting room. Your mother and I were finishing our discussion of her upcoming treatment and your father tried to stop me. She wants to keep feeding you as much as you&rsquo;re getting now.&rdquo;
 
Bobbie nodded sagely. &ldquo;Like me sister on the game. She goes to a quack so she won&rsquo;t have no more kids neither.&rdquo;
 
Dr. Watson blinked in comical reaction to a girl Bobbie&rsquo;s age knowing such things. &ldquo;Er. That is rather Mrs. Whitstable&rsquo;s business, Bobbie. If you two are quite finished galloping to my rescue, I am sure there are one or two people outside still waiting for my assistance.&rdquo;
 
More like twelve or thirteen, but Mac didn&rsquo;t say anything. Besides, even if Mr. Holmes didn&rsquo;t come down at Big George&rsquo;s message, the kid would be back soon anyway, with a pocketful of scones from the old lady &ndash; no way in hell was that little titch eating them all himself.
 
Just one thing to do before leaving.
 
Mac went outside and whistled. &ldquo;You! And you!&rdquo; He pointed to two men in the line and jerked his chin.
 
Between the coughing man, the man with the gashed arm, Mac, Bobbie, and two or three Whitstables, they dragged Bob out of the doctor&rsquo;s den.
 
&ldquo;Thank you, Mac,&rdquo; said the courteous tiger. &ldquo;Next?&rdquo;

<b>Summary: </b>Joan Watson has always kept up with the latest memory-prompt technology.
<b>Author&#39;s Notes: </b>For the 2015 July Watson&#39;s Woes Promptfest prompt #5, <b>Note to Self</b>.&nbsp; Anything from a pencil jot on a paper cuff or a string on a finger to a modern sticky note or a cell phone alarm. Doesn&#39;t matter who the writer is, so long as there&#39;s something he/she needs a reminder for.
 
 <lj-cut text=""Story below the cut."">
Joan Watson, not surprisingly, is methodical about making notes to herself to keep abreast of a busy, ordered life &ndash; one of the many skills that makes a valedictorian for one&rsquo;s medical class.
 
From early days as a student she wrote neat lists for all the homework she needed to study, with stars for long-term projects or essays. (This extended into her personal and family obligations: &ldquo;Physics, chs 2-5 / Val-Day card f. Aunt Ellen / Chem, pt 1 / Help Mom &amp; O. w. dumplings / Essay, 18<sup>th</sup>-c. English authors / Calc, ch. 10.&rdquo;)
 
Like most highly-organized people, Joan immediately transitioned to more efficient methods of keeping herself on track in both her professional and personal life. She isn&rsquo;t as big a foaming technophile as is Oren or her dad &ndash; she gave Oren a Look when he told her about waiting all night in line to buy the latest iteration of some phone &ndash; but will upgrade when the previous device no longer holds a charge or simply burns out from keeping her on track. For three years Suri&rsquo;s pleasant voice reminded her about hearings dates, meetings with clients, and dinners with Mom.
 
Joan&rsquo;s current device isn&rsquo;t quite the latest iteration (it&rsquo;s not quite two years old at this point). Nor does it matter what iteration this one is, because another device has supplanted the electronic one &ndash; the same device that supplanted her two alarm clocks.
 
WATSON: FAM MEAL @ LAPIN AGILE. BELL &amp; I HAVE THIS. GO. &ndash; S
 
&ldquo;<i>We</i> are going nowhere. <i>You</i> have a new sponsor to train. They are expecting you in an hour at Hilldale. I&rsquo;ve laid your outfit on the chair.&rdquo;
 
W: @ 5<sup>TH</sup> &amp; 17<sup>TH</sup>. BRNG GREY&rsquo;S ANAT. &amp; UR DR&rsquo;S STOMACH W U. S
 
&ldquo;Good morning! I have yoghurt, curried chickpeas and tea on the tray. We&rsquo;ve had a breakthrough in the case. Detective Bell is waiting for us at the station.&rdquo;
 
W: OREN&rsquo;S BDAY TOM. GET CARD IN MAIL. C U L8R. S.
 
Joan does actually keep her appointments on her current phone &ndash; but at this point it&rsquo;s more of a backup. If her phone tells her about an engagement before Sherlock does, it doubles as a warning that something has happened to her partner. This warning helped her save his life once.
 
The worst part of what happened is that she must accustom herself to the phone&rsquo;s appointment chime all over again.

<lj-cut text=""Story below the cut."">
&ldquo;Tell me about that place, Army dog.&rdquo;

Shock and I lay in our shared alleyway; I licked the wounds along his back. The black cat had gotten worried by a pack of Staffordshire Terriers before I&rsquo;d appeared and fought them off. I had not escaped injury myself, but the feline had been like a ragged scrap of fur afterward. I&rsquo;d wanted to take him to a human hospital for our kind &ndash; refused by Shock, who reminded me what happened to homeless cats as badly injured as he in such places.

&ldquo;That place?&rdquo;

&ldquo;The place where you were an Army dog, Army dog.&rdquo; Shock&rsquo;s ears were flat against his skull and his eyes were closed. His black fur was matted with red. He made hissing sounds when I licked his wounds.

Shock had never evinced the slightest interest in my past, other than his pleasure in telling me what had happened to me by looking at me. That he spoke of such a thing let me know that he was in a lot of pain and wanted distraction; my story was merely a ball of yarn for the moggie. But he was my partner.

&ldquo;The place where I was an Army dog was very hot.&rdquo; I licked my sole foreleg, badly-bitten by one of my opponents; I had a bare place on my shoulder where my foreleg should be. &ldquo;Everything smelled of anger, and sometimes fire and pain, of hot stone and dust. The drinking water was hot. When my human and I ran to help others, it also had the smell of blood and body-insides and shit, and more pain and fear.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Other dogs?&rdquo; Shock&rsquo;s sides shook. His blood tasted of anger and fear.

&ldquo;Not many dogs &ndash; and they were small, and all smelled hungry and mean. My human kept me close, so I never fought them.&rdquo;

&ldquo;The humans?&rdquo;

My tail moved a little on the ground. &ldquo;My human was the best. He&rsquo;ll come and get me when he&rsquo;s out of his own hospital. He smelled of doctor-stink and soap and dust. The people with us smelled angry and afraid. The other people smelled of protection and anger and sadness.

Shock hissed again as I licked his hind-paws and his ragged bloody tail. &ldquo;That place sounds worse than this place.&rdquo;

I secured the wounded cat in my sole foreleg. &ldquo;This place is cold, and there is not enough food, and not as much dust. But I was happy there. I was working hard and helping humans, and obeying my master and doing my duty.&rdquo;

Shock&rsquo;s stillness was not death but disbelief. I resumed my grooming, amused. <i>Cats.</i>

<lj-cut text=""Story below the cut."">
I had been dismissing the occasional grey in Watson&#39;s hair and moustache, the deepening lines at his eyes and jowls, his stiffer walking gait, the thinner yet more complex quality of his blood when I fed from him. I myself never aged and had been willfully ignoring the signs in my companion. He had broached the subject of retirement for both of us, a retreat to the countryside from where he could finish his life in pastoral peace.
 
It was the Garrideb case that finally made up my mind for me. I vividly recall snarling in the face of my white-faced pop-eyed captive that his life was forfeit for killing Watson; my ice-cold rage was sleet in my veins, and I more my former self than I had been for decades, as much a soulless killing fiend as was my brother. All that kept me from tearing open Evans&rsquo; artery and feeding till he died under my grip was a groan of pain from behind me; Watson, wounded, very much alive.
 
I spent a good deal of time in introspection whilst Watson recovered from his superficial bloodletting. That ridiculous nothing of a case would have been such a disgraceful way for both of us to depart. I finally admitted that it was time that we both retire and find a life kinder to an aging body.
 
So we dwell in Sussex, amid the hum of bees and the soft grumble of the ocean waves below our cliff. I have slowed my pace to match his, both in our walks and in our daily routine, and am bemused to find peace envelop me as well. I watch my companion moving through dead brown leaves that herald the winter, and see in Watson&rsquo;s lined face the shape of the skull beneath. But my morocco case remains safely locked in my desk drawer in our cottage; it contains my syringe, vials of holy water and powdered garlic, a fatal dose of consecrated bread &ndash; all ready for my use on the day my mortal beloved leaves me. Watson knows of the case and loathes it; but he has stopped his attempts to change my mind.
 
When his life&rsquo;s autumn takes him away, it will do the same for me. I am with the one I love and I am content. (Mycroft envies me to the bottom of his winter heart for both these things.)

Yellow pollen dusts the legs of honeybees weaving through the flower-strewn Sussex garden. Watson sits in the gazebo for hours, watching these peaceful non-combatants going about their work. Perhaps &ldquo;bees&rdquo; was not on the list of palliatives suggested by Major Watson&#39;s doctor, but all Holmes knows is that his friend has far fewer nights where he wakes up shrieking. Watson is getting better, and he thanks his bees for that.

The Bristol seaside is bathed in sunlight, lovely and serene. But one of the sea-bathers has been found dead in his changing-tent, and an enthralled consulting-detective has rather forgotten that the purpose of a visit to the seaside is <i>rest</i>. Watson sighs, and heads into their shared tent to change out of his bathing-costume &ndash; which is more than Holmes has done, bent over the corpse and deducing possible murder methods whilst the police hide their inappropriate grins at his still-wet yellow-striped outfit.

Yellow ducklings peep and paddle under the tutelage of their adoptive parents; Steve is currently teaching them to dive for tiny fish, a skill at which the penguin exceeds his partner. Duck does not regret hanging up his hat; his pride in his family is greater than any adulation from the idiot humans who begged for his skill even as they refused to stop their cruel jokes about birds."

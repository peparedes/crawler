Hes everything a girl, well me, would want in a guy. And hes even good looking! Thats a combination you would rarely find. 

*sigh* This is not the time for all this to happen. And now he thinks hes done something wrong. Thats just it! He hasnt done ANYTHING! Well why would he, I mean Im just, and I quote,""a really good friend"". ONLY! Thats like a nice way of saying 'In your dreams!'

I dont know...Its not his fault. Our friendship is kind of complicated so It wouldnt have worked anyway...I cant believe that actually crossed my mind! OFCOURSE it would NEVER work.
The worst was when he 'forgot' to mention the fact that he got back with his girlfriend. Well, Its none of my business. They've been together forever before the little break. Im really happy for him but I cant help being jealous....*sigh*


I just hope she appreciates every moment with him cause he is totally worth it!

"event","My Eid holiday is almost over and I havent started on any of my work yet. Why am I not surprised. I hate procrastinating but I do it all the time.

Anyway, on Sat Jessica and I went to that Police Academy show on Muraqqibat(damn I dont know how to spell) Street. It was pretty good actually. Bunch of Italian dudes doing all sorts of stunts on dirk bikes and cars. BMW ofcourse! I was telling Jessica how this is the last thing Dubai-ians needed to see. I mean they already drive like fucking idiots!
And damn was it crowded. Good thing I parked my car at Shitty Center, hmm although it was pretty crowded there too. Anyhoo its alot of fun driving around in Jessica's car.
So back to the show. The dudes were totally Jessica's type and for that whole night I think she totally forgot about that dude....wait what was his name...ah yes, HER BOYFRIEND! So when the show ended and the dudes came out to take pictures with people, 2 of the guys starting pointing at us and asking us to stay till everyone leaves. (hehe we got what we wanted, hehe little sluts we are)
His name was Jader, 23. Not that bad looking I guess, not really my type except for the lip ring, ooo mama. We talked and shit, he wanted us to stay for next show then go out clubbing. I really didnt want to stay on that street cause it was jam packed with yucky people that have some kind of magnet that sticks their hands to our asses. He then asked me to come back before the second show which was in an hour cause by then he would have gotten his cellphone with him from the hotel so he could take my number. I said yeah yeah sure, I seriously couldnt be fucked cause I just wanted to leave that place cause it was so crowded.
We said our goodbyes and left to Jessica's car. Then one of his friends runs up to us and asks us to wait cause Jader wanted to talk to me. The poor guy tries to make his way through the crowd which by now are hugging him and cheering him on his cool stunts and shit. Anyway hes like he really wants my number (wow that doesnt happen to me alot so it was cool). We drop him to his hotel and he takes my number then we head to Shitty.
He called me that night and wanted to go out. I told him Ill take him around Dubai, so We might go out today. Im REALLY not in the mood but I know I'll regret it when its all over.

Hmmm other than that, nothing exciting has happened to me. I should get my ass moving to uni and get some shit done.
Ok seriously, Im going to go now.....well right after I take a little nap..hehe"

Cause classes started I never have time to clean up after myself, so my room is a dump, and seeing it like that totally stresses me out. So now I can clean up and spend some time with my cats. My professors didnt give us much work so thats good too.
Wed was Zaina'a 21st birthday dinner at Venizia. It was really nice and different. We were all dressed up formally and damn did the guys look HOT in suits or what! From the girls it was me, Zaina, Jessica, Mac, Lydia, Mahi, Drina, Haleh, Maryam and from the dudes it was Trad, Ahmed, Trevor, Emad, Fadi and his friend, Abdullah, Dai-lon, and Zaina's older brother. They all went to boudoir after that but I had cramps so I just went home. Jessica left to meet up with her guy and Mahi felt sick cause of the wine we drank at dinner.
Then yesterday I went to global village with Jessica, Aseya, Basil, Fadi, Tala, khateeb, and Mona. It was alright I guess. We just checked out some of the pavilions and the games. hmmmm not as much fun as it used to be. On my way home I stopped by Sara's with Burger King's Hershy's pie. I felt bad cause Ive been giving her attitude recently cause she just pisses me off.
And today Im staying in. Going to help my dad with some of his paperwork then Im going to attack my room.

They asswipes at uni didnt increase the parking space, so it was hell finding a spot. a perfect way to start the day,eh?

Anyway, chilled at Assy's then we decided to check out global village. oh what a shitty idea. Like that wasnt bad enough, we ended up at shitty center. The crowd suck, but there were a few hotties.

Finally bought Coldplay's A Rush of Blood to the Head. I mellowing out again. 
felt kinda girly so i bought some more makeup.

oh we met these marines, no offense to any americans out there but damn what thick heads. one of the dudes like where you from? Im like Im Iranian. Where he asks. IRAN.then he proceeds to ask his friend for some help. So im like fucking hell I-Ran.
thats when he realized what i was saying. Then he starts going on about how he doesnt want war and hes all into peace and how he hopes i wont shot him or some crap like that, i kinda stop listening after he said I-Ran.

"event","...""'Street Spirit' has no resolve... It is the dark tunnel without the light at the end. It represents all tragic emotion that is so hurtful that the sound of that melody is its only definition. We all have a way of dealing with that song... It's called detachment... Especially me.. I detach my emotional radar from that song, or I couldn't play it... I'd crack. I'd break down on stage.. that's why its lyrics are just a bunch of mini-stories or visual images as opposed to a cohesive explanation of its meaning... I used images set to the music that I thought would convey the emotional entirety of the lyric and music working together... That's what's meant by 'all these things are one to swallow whole'.. I meant the emotional entirety, because I didn't have it in me to articulate the emotion... (pause) I'd crack.... Our fans are braver than I to let that song penetrate them, or maybe they don't realize what they're listening to.. They don't realize that 'Street Spirit' is about staring the fucking devil right in the eyes... and knowing, no matter what the hell you do, he'll get the last laugh...and it's real...and true. The devil really will get the last laugh in all cases without exception, and if I let myself think about that to long, I'd crack. I can't believe we have fans that can deal emotionally with that song... That's why I'm convinced that they don't know what it's about. It's why we play it towards the end of our sets. It drains me, and it shakes me, and hurts like hell everytime I play it, looking out at thousands of people cheering and smiling, oblivious to the tragedy of it's meaning, like when you're going to have your dog put down and it's wagging it's tail on the way there. That's what they all look like, and it breaks my heart.""

My mom thinks my bathroom freaked her out cause of the cat litter hahah but i doubt it, I keep my bathroom very clean!=)

Around 1:30ish I picked Reem, <lj user=""sticky_toffee""> up (she is as sweet as her lj name). She lives soo close which is awesome. Im soooo going to harass her heheh. 
Anyhoo Reem is a total sweetheart and sooo adorable!! I wouldnt think I would be comfortable around her cause Im not usually like that with someone Ive never met. I think I was a wee bit too comfortable cause I wouldnt stop yapping. We went into Areej and embarrasses ourselves, well I did, cause we wanted to surprise the girls but they werent there. So we met up with Ahmed, then Giggles showed up. We had lunch and just sat around then Megan and Aseya showed up.
After the girls went back to work we just sat around and talked about pathetic shit which was really fun. I just hope I didnt bore her cause she kept going quiet at times. It would be awesome if we hung out more!

Around 4ish we left Mercato. I dropped Reem off at Al Ghurair. I think I freaked her out with my driving haha, I DO apologize. I went to City Center and met up with my mom after an hour. ohhh I actually bought something this time.
I bought this really bitchin v-neck top! and pants that fit perfectly!!! I couldnt believe it! I have a screwed up body so I cant find decent pants that look good on me. Its like either the waist is really tight but the ass part is huge or vise versa. I also got a nice skin-colored bra, a girl can never have enough underwear!! I even bought 2 beautiful silk neck scarfs for my aunts. Theyre soooo pretty! I love shopping.
Too bad this season's clothes SUCK! I hate them, well most of it.

Anyway I got home and was in one of my natural highs, it was awesome. Watched abit of TV and now here I am. I was suppose to stop at Giggle's to pick up something but she wasnt home. 

She wants us to help her paint her room, that would be fun! I need to paint my room but I seriously cant be arsed! I still need to move my crap into my brother's room cause I cant take Tiger's fur anymore, Its just way too much! Im making my current room, my tv/internet/cat room and making my brother's mine. hes not here and he doesnt have anything in his room anyhow so yay for me!

Im still getting weird cramp like things, but it only lasts for 5 seconds. Thankfully my body has become immune to the pills so no more barf fests!

Well thats that, I better get some sleep. good night! =)"

"event","I feel sooooo much better but Im really scared to sleep cause thats when i start feeling sick the most. And I've been eating none stop today so my stomach wont feel shitty. So much for trying to lose weight. psshh!

Anyway, its official. Im leaving to Iran. We werent sure if we were going cause of the cats. Theres no one to take care of them and I wont be able to take with me. My dad is staying though but thats worse cause hes not really fond of them so he'll probably kick them out. I found some ""cat hotels"" but its fucking expensive, like 36 a day. Thats good if its only for one day but not for a month. Itll be around 1000 something for one of them, but i have 2 so its worse. So my dad decided to feed them atleast. Ill tell the cleaning lady to clean their litter box, she comes 3 times aweek.
I wont stay in Iran for a month though cause I really cant get myself to leave the cats alone for long. Ill leave with my mom, stay for 2 weeks then get my ass back here alone. My mom needs a vacation. I know Iran is no Spain but its way better than here. Well weather speaking that is.

So anyway Im in a good mood for a sick person. The bleeding sorta stopped so thats good. I just hope it doesnt start again and the pills dont fuck me up. IF I do start bleeding again, Im going to stick a cork up my pussy!!!!! yes too much information but no one forced you read my journal.

My brother is leaving in 2 days woohoo. I cant believe Im saying this but yeah im gonna miss his annoying ass. Atleast he fixed the PC, which is hard to believe. My msn doesnt fuck up anymore so thats sorta good i guess.

Giggles and Ahmed are apparently a couple now. Its sorta weird considering the fact that AHmed told me hes not attracted to her. freaks I tell ya! I just hope they both know what theyre doing. Speaking of Giggles, shes working at Areej in Mercato with Aseya and their friend Megan. But Aseya is planning on working for Kaya so I hope that works out for her.
I tried applying for jobs but my dad is being a total male whore about it. I think thats why he wants me to leave in summer haha. 

How annoying. He complains about me spending HIS money and how he works his ass off to be able to put some food on the table but when i want to help and get a job myself so i can spend MY own money, he complains again. Nothing ever satisfies parents. eef!

hmm what else? oh yeah Trevor is gone for the summer. Just incase you were wondering why I havent mentioned him.

I still need to buy Hessa a birthday present and Jessica as well. eeef soo many birthdays. I was thinking about buying her a nice denim jacket cause she was looking for one and a bag or something. I suck at buying presents! Hessa's gone to Australia so I have plenty of time to buy her something.

Oh Nazy sent me this website about how to train your cat to use the toilet. Im thinking of trying it out! how funny would that look. My cat is too spoilt for that kind of shit! hahah I love him! and Tiger too!

I think its time for me to lose the PJS and head out into the real world tomorrow. Im sick and tired of staying at home all lazy and sick. I just hope I get alot better than I have already gotten. I should call Zeinab, Hanin and Dalia up so we can out somewhere.

Oh I spoke to Sam. He apologized for not keeping in touch, its just that hes been busy moving to a new house and some other stuff. I feel bad for making him feel bad. We better chillax soon!

Oh and I was planning on calling <lj user=""sticky_toffee""> a few days go so we could chillax but then my body decided to become a total slut. She lives like almost 5 mins away from me dammit. I need more friends living around my area. Giggles is moving further up towards the Burj. I saw the new place the other day. You can see The Burj and Jumeira Beach Hotel from her window. Its beautiful at night, and her neighbourhood is soo peaceful. 

Well Thats it i guess. Ive been stuck at home so I dont have much to say. Im really bored though so I hope people get on soon! I feel like playing the name game heheh

later..."

"event","I finally decided to update! These cramps DONOT want to leave me alone!

Anyway Clubbing was fun! We met the guys at the hotel room. Trevor decided to get a suite! The room was nice and big but we still ended up fighting for the bed. Obviously Ahmed and Giggles slept in one bed and Trevor, Aseya, and I crashed in the other. 
around 6 Hessa picked me up and we went to chili's for dinner with Jessica cause it was Hessa's birthday. It was great fun! Those 2 chicks are the best! Hessa is leaving to Australia today! I hope she had fun1

She then dropped me off back to the hotel around 9! Everyone was already drunk except for Trevor which was a big shocker. I had to dress Giggles up cause she was totally wasted. It was really hard not cause she was drunk but because Ahmed's tongue was down her throat the whole time! They are 2 horny motherfuckers.

Aseya got sick before we even left the room. But she got over it. We met Big Mike and Aseya's friend Suzanne at the Grand Hyatt then headed to the MIX. Oooo I saw Jamie, the hot bouncer. Hes Big's friend. The place was really nice but it was sooo empty so we decided to go to Planetarium. 

We bumped into The Drama Club(dont ask) on our way to planetarium. 
Everyone was there from college which sorta sucked. 

I seriously cant be fucked to type out what happened cause alot did. It might come up in my other posts. Oh my friend Dalia came with us. Shes here for summer from France. It was great to see her.

Im sorta upset with a few people who stopped keeping in touch...Im sure they know who they are.
We barely hung out which was abig bummer but whatever it was their choice.

Anyway my cramps are getting worse so Im gonna go lie down. Bye"

"event","Today ended up being an alright day as opposed to the past few days.
So lets see...I woke up, took a shower and met up with my bitches(for those of you who STILL dont know who my bitches are Aseya, Giggles) at shitty cause they decided to go there for their  4 hour break. Then later on my other bitch, Trevor, showed up and we chillaxed at starbucks cause of the cozy couches..oh yeah and the coffee too. 

It was fun...we just talked bullshit and laughed alot. Then Assy and Ms.Mcslutson <b>made</b> me drop them off so I <b>made</b> Trevor come with me. I dropped them off at wafi and drove back to shitty cause I was suppose to meet up with Jessica and Trevor was suppose to meet Ahmed there.

Jessica showed up abit late cause some guy sexually harassed her in the parking lot( Thats what she gets for being hot) but the dumbass(thats what she gets for coloring her hair 9837498374 times) didnt say anything cause she didnt want to keep ME waiting. This is what happened:
she parked her car in the basement level of the theater parking(which is usually sorta empty) and walked towards the lift when this european dude appears out of nowhere and starts asking her freaky questions. She obviously ignores and tells him to bugger off but the guy grabs her arm(she bruised like a peach) and shit and starts like sorta screaming at her. The fucking dumbass retardo security dude sees this and thinks that theyre a couple with issues.Jessica sorta screams to the security dude and he ""runs"" over and goes like ""its wo-k, notin happen to your hand,no""(try to say that with an indian accent, it sounds funnier(no offense). Shes like what the fuck??? So the security decides to take action and tells them to follow him to the security office. Shes like fuck it cause I kept calling her to get her ass there. Anyway she just decided to fuck it and leave.

I cant believe she didnt tell me when I called her. I think its cause she knew I was GOING TO KICK THAT MOFO'S ASSSSS!!!!NO ONE MESSES WITH MY FRIENDS!I CAN SOOO KICK ANYONE'S ASS! BRING IT ON....(ehem) anyway when I saw her and she told me that, I wasnt surprised. She has a stunning body. Yes Im jealous! Im only human u know!

Anyway after that we decided to stop at the Sweet Factory (yumm) we stuffed our faces with candy and headed off to Mercato( We had nothing better to do(<b>IF ANYONE CAN LIST 10 FUN THINGS TO DO IN DUBAI....THAT IS LEGAL..WILL WIN A PRIZE</B>))

We looked around and laughed alot. Damn there was this one dude, he looked like he was in his late 30's. He was walking around with his girlfriend/wife/lover who by the way was pretty good looking. We passed them and then suddenly he stops and STARES at Jessica. He actually turned 360 degrees to get a look at her ass and the poor woman he was with was like hanging from him so his eyes wouldnt be up a chicks ass. She did a shitty job at stopping him. Oh well MEN CAN be sleaze balls.

Oh I finally bought another copy of Tool's Lateralus!!!!!Now I have a brand new CD and 2 album covers psshh. oh well, I hope the asshole is enjoying my CDs!!!

Anyway We left around 7 cause she had to be home at 7:30 to help her mom out with something. So i drove back to shitty cause she had her car parked there. We said our goodbyes and left.

I got home around 8 and worked out. hehe yes  you read right! <b>I</b> worked out! I've been working out for the past few days so i feel pretty fit! I want to have a visible collarbone cause i think thats soo frikin sexy on girls! and I want a nice muscular tummy as well!

Anyhoo I have nothing else to say so i think im gonna go drink a gallon of water!


P.S cold sores suck cock!"

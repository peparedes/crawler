"event","Pretty much anyone with a pulse has heard about what happened within the last four hours, with regard to a megastar who had soared so high that a Chuck Norris roundhouse kick couldn't bring him back down to earth.  A figure that was at times the pinnacle of charm and glory, of fanciful, flawless dance moves earning the swoon of many a woman and the envy and aspiration of a man (or vice versa...hell if I know), and at times polarizing, ever-appearing to become the next case of celebrity-gone-psycho, as polarizing as he was popular.

One cannot deny the pull of such a high-flying superstar, witnessing the massive flock of onlookers outside the hospital on Thursday afternoon.  Or perhaps we can hearken back, to the many multitudes who cheered him on into and out of the courtroom when facing trial.  It is not news that Michael Jackson is an idol and a hero to many.  It is also not news that, whether true or not, there have been many who suggested he was some sort of possessive pedophile within his idyllic little world of the Neverland Ranch.

However, being a sports fan for so many years, seeing many pump steroids into their system and being deemed cheaters on every road game, and then to see them hailed as heroes in their home park, I think I've realized something.

This pedestal we continue to place others upon causes people to lose perspective at times...that these people are still human beings, and the only real difference between us and them is their job and their paycheck.  The thing with MJ is that he just kept soaring, going to unprecedented heights above and beyond what most everyday folk could fathom.

Here's to the star who soared for all the world to see."

"event","Yup, I've got a whole new beef today.  This one is with Nintendo.

So I play my DS quite a bit.  It's a DS Lite, great little gaming tool that plays GBA games as well.  Love it.  But I accidentally drop it off my desk, and the right hinge breaks loose.  It still *works*, just that matter of holding the top screen in place.  It's only slightly awkward.  Concerned, I call up Nintendo's customer service line to see what my options are.  That's when I learn of the cost of a small piece of plastic to hold the DS' top screen in place:

$75.  Oh, and $10 shipping/handling.  So, $85.

What.  The.  FUCK.

Does anyone else realize I could get a *used* original DS at GameStop for less than that, and not even have to endure not having their system for like 2 weeks?  Is this piece of plastic made out of platinum!?  (Pokemon platinum jokes are welcome here :) )

Nintendo, you can kindly suck it.  Nothing you guys make is worth $85 anymore except the DS.  Ugh.  See, this is part of the reason why the American economy is shit.  They penny-pinch and penny-grope us, the consumers, as much as possible, while their inane, big-headed executives go on million-dollar junkets to Vegas.  There is absolutely NO EXCUSE for bad customer service.  Ever."

"event","Does anyone else realize it's a complete waste of time to stick a whole group of people under one convenient umbrella?  I sure as hell do, although I still do so on a fairly consistent basis, not that I think it's right.

Case in point: Proposition 8, which was passed last year during the election.

This was the headline-inducer, the gay marriage ban that passed with a majority vote, 54 to 46 percent or something like that, in spite of record voter turnouts among younger voters and the like.  The only reason this became necessary was because a few activist judges in San Francisco decided to abuse their power and override the will of the voting public, playing at politics like they own the place.  Today, several months after this has passed, there are still pamphlets and fliers visible on the campus of Cuyamaca College, which I recently visited for the first time in a few years to see a friend play in a concert.  It read something like this:

""End the hate, no on 8.""

What hate?  Seriously?  I don't hate homosexuals.  What I hate is that these very people who would demand tolerance for their lifestyle and ideas (and by the way, tolerance and acceptance are two entirely different things) can't even give the same respect when someone else wants to speak on behalf of their own beliefs or lifestyles, because God forbid it opposes them or hurts them.  I'm looking at you, Perez Hilton.  Way to set back your cause and bash a young lady on national television.  For the record, Carrie Prejean is the real Miss USA.  Sure, it's an old headline.  But I need to get this off my chest.

There is no 'hate' behind Proposition 8.  And if there is, then there's as much 'hate', if not MORE, being screamed and yelled by the apparent minority in California that believes gay marriage is their right.  The outcries are just getting more and more harsh.

My point here is, well, if you want to push for gay marriage, fine.  I really wouldn't need to do much more than to vote against it.  But if you're going to force it on people every day through television, media, Bravo, or whatever, and you're going to walk up to me and try to give me a kiss, I'm going to stiff-arm you.  Just cool your jets and do it right.  This isn't a civil rights movement.  Hate crimes are committed against gays every day and it sucks, and it's the same for almost every single 'group' of people in existence.  But you're not getting fire-hosed in the streets like it's the 60's, and you're not being blocked at university entrances by police officers.  And one thing I definitely haven't seen is a homosexual figure of the magnitude of a Martin Luther King Jr., who was a shining beacon of moral fortitude.

Spare us the civil rights movement mumbo-jumbo.  We know this is all about money anyway."

I've been getting that feeling lately, and you know who you are.  Thank you, but I have more than enough time to pick apart my flaws.  So just let me deal with it.

I've gone from depressed to angry, because I've recently gotten a job that pays well for a pretty menial task, and I consider myself blessed as well as lucky to have gotten it.  The assignment ended last Friday, and I have another 2 1/2 months' worth of experience under my belt, even if it was an easy job, the gravy train, as it were.

Now, I know I'm not a bad person.  I try hard to go out of my way to be nice to people, and sometimes it's taken the wrong way.  Unfortunately, not every act of compassion is going to be returned in kind, as much difficulty as I have accepting this.  But you know something?  It's occurred to me that I don't have to put up with that crap.

I'm probably an idiot for looking to forge friendships over the internet, but whatever.  I tried.  After all, if people want to shun my kindness and greetings, it's not my problem.  My problem is that I just probably need to be a little less sensitive.

That said, I think I'll go ahead and take a slight breather as my job search continues."

2 weeks ago, I had a chat with my family about trust.  It was a pretty serious talk, and I felt as if we were a bit closer together because of it.  I had only hoped it'd steer us all in the right emotional direction.  But hope can only go so far, now can't it?

If the same mistakes are made over and over again, then there's really no point in apology in the first place.  Apparently I feel my sister is finding it fit to offer shallow, meaningless apologies and continue on with her lifestyle.  And the reason why I'm frustrated is that I have to watch it all happen.  I love my sister, I really do, and some of the things she has gone through lately are some things I think nobody should ever, EVER go through.

But that is NO EXCUSE to lose sight of your own responsibility.  And DEFINITELY no excuse to make life harder on mom.  (Yes, this is getting pretty direct.)

We all have our own personal mess to clean.  And until we ourselves can clean it up, we don't have the right to judge the messes of others.  Seriously, it drives me mad to think people can still justify their stupidities by saying that someone else/everyone else did/does it.  It's idiotic and a waste of time, and nothing gets cleaned up that way.  By doing this people just end up unproductive, pointing out problems instead of solutions.  I try (and, consequently, sometimes fail) to be this way, but if you're at least TRYING to be this way, then I salute you.

Not to mention I have about as much confidence as the keyboard I'm using to type this entry.  I've convinced myself I simply can't get a job, because I don't have the confidence to nail the interview and follow up, or type a good resume, and it kills my motivation to look for a job.  I don't believe in myself, and it's putting me through these motions of depression every time I try to motivate myself to get serious about this job search.  Eventually this is really going to take its toll.

I also ought to confess that I took some of it out on my sister earlier verbally, so if you're reading this, Lauren, I apologize for being a jerk.  I just can't figure out how I can be happy with myself for a change.  I worry often about what others think of me, and it sticks in my head like super glue.  It eventually leads to me convincing myself I'm this awful human being I hoped never to become.  That I'm a bad brother, a lazy slob, an inconsiderate moron, a bum.  And once that perception sets into my head, it's pretty hard for me to change it.  There are a lot of things I'd like to change about myself, but the first and foremost is my self-esteem, and I can't figure out how to change that for the better.

"event","It's high time I give this game a grade.

Graphics: A

The visuals in this game are stunning.  It's as if FFXII will serve as the gateway RPG going forward into the PS3 era, and it gives me high hopes for the genre.  The characters are modeled extremely well, and the environments have served as outstanding precursors for what is to come.  The fantasy world that is Ivalice is so well-presented that it rightfully puts all of those ridiculous cell-shaded graphic games in its rightful place: shame.  (I just wanted to get that off my chest.)

But I digress.  The fact that you can actually SEE the weapons you're wielding, in battle, is a plus.  There is but a single blemish on this aspect of the game that keeps me from giving it an A+, and that is Vaan's character model.  His tan is really, really funky.

Gameplay: B

This B is actually a bit of a favor, for the gambit system, innovative as it may be, means the user can voluntarily give up combat control to a series of automated commands.  However, the fact is that in terms of gameplay, FFXII offers a multitude of possibilities.  Through the license grid one can assume control of all characters' development.  Say what you will about requiring a license to use a new ability or piece of equipment.  You will probably get all your necessary licenses as you're trying to amass the cash to actually BUY the stuff.  I think some of us may be a little tired of this by now.

I was, however, tempted to assign a B+ here because, unlike most FFs, this one is actually somewhat challenging.  Attaining level 55 or so is not necessarily a free pass past the final boss in this game.  And if you want a REAL challenge, try tackling two of the baddest beasties in the series: Yiazmat, and Omega Mark XII!

Sound/Music: A

Every scene, every area (mostly), each new experience seems to come with its own musical score befitting its atmosphere.  Battling the legendary espers treats you to a tune that truly gives the battle an epic feel to it, befitting a battle with one of these downcast deities.

What sets this game apart from others, however, is the quality of the voice acting.  It's the best I've heard yet.  Had more serious work into the plot been done, this game could possibly be to video games what ""The Lord of the Rings"" is to movies.  For once, the translation from Japanese to English was smooth as eastern silk, rather than hammered with a heavy bludgeon into place (coughFFXcough).  The accents of the creatures of different races was uncanny...well, except maybe the viera.

Plot/Storyline: C+

I took a good look at this game and truly hoped it would provide a gaming experience like no other.  A properly-written storyline may not have been one of the prerequisites.  As many unexpected tidbits of information show up during the course of the game, I do not qualify them as twists and turns, for most of the events of importance to the storyline had already happened when the game began.  It didn't leave much to the journey in which you partake of throgh 98% of the game.

Also, there is a serious lack of character development.  Each member of the cast never seems to change one iota over the course of the game, for better or worse, and I think that is a rather dull aspect.  The premise of the game's plot is itself rather simply thrown together, eerily resembling that of FFII.

Overall: A-

This game managed to meet my every lofty expectation...except its plot.  But a plot on an RPG is much like icing on a cake.  You can easily scrape it off (skip the cutscenes) and enjoy the game (the cake, as it were).  There is much to be enjoyed in this rich gaming experience.  Say what you will about the gambit system.  I, for one, think it's great that Square-Enix tends to try out new things with most FF games, from turn-based and job systems, to ATB systems, Materia systems, Junctions, the Sphere Grid...it goes on and on.  Let the naysayers say all they will.  Final Fantasy still lives up to its namesake, setting a new standard for the rest to follow.

At least there's no corny love story."

This is a culture of ignorance, a culture that praises the bold rather than the correct, the vociferous rather than the wise.  A sound mind with good reasoning is always lost in this endless tornado we call the (mis)information age.  There are simply far too many closed minds in this world, and I tire of their kind.  People say Republicans are closed-minded.  People say Christians are closed-minded.  People say people who disagree are closed-minded.  I say that every definition in the dictionary will be bastardized eventually simply to fulfill the want of these ignorant fools.

I know I'm being vague, because I'm not pointing anyone out.  I'm not going to.  But it really p[isses me off when someone's opinion is discredited by someone else in spite of a good heap of facts being included and tied together.  You know who you are.  Just because I disagree with gay marriage doesn't mean I'm closed-minded.  Just because I think some people shouldn't breed doesn't mean I'd be pro-abortion (in that case I'd be anti-sex, and the next person who tells me it's a natural thing and it has to be done gets punched in the face).  Just because a whole bunch of countries are fighting doesn't mean it's World War 3 (it's really more like the war of the third world).  Look, I can understand the want to find a formula for judgement and whatnot, but I would REALLY appreciate it if there were more open minds out there.  And changing one opinion you have does NOT an open-minded person make.

There's only one thing on television that's real.

Sports.

Think about it.  Two teams going at each others' throats every day, trying to seize victory in their clutches.  The unpredictable nature of sports is what makes it interesting, truly 'real'.  Nothing is scripted in a game (don't give me that WWE BS because that isn't a sport).  Nobody is 'chosen' to win the game before it's played.  If you want to win, you fight it out.  That simple.

"event","Alliteration aside, I finally got to thinking.  It's finals week at UCSD and for some other places as well, so I decided to put together this list of methods I use to prepare for exams on a regular basis.  Hopefully it'll help some of you do better yourselves.

1) Study early.  You do NOT want to cram for an exam, ever.  Information simply cannot be stored that fast and be expected to show up whenever you want it to.  By studying early and often, you can process this information repeatedly.  Practice makes perfect, and each time through you may understand something new about the material.  If you do this regularly you will likely have a big edge over the curve.

2) Take breaks.  You're probably not going to be able to do everything at once, so if you feel stuck or can't think straight, take a break.  Exercise, play a game, post in your LJ or something.  Give yourself some time to relax, and keep the material in the back of your head.  Studying early will allow you more of this.

3) Don't study 10-15 minutes before the exam.  If you're in a rush to figure out one last topic before the test, you may become so deeply obsessed in that short search that you lose your grasp on the rest of the material.  COnsider this your last 'break', right before the exam.  Spend some time mentally preparing yourself.  Pray, meditate, whatever suits your fancy.  A calm state of mind will allow you to perform at your best.

4) Don't panic.  If you see a question that you can't answer right away, feel free to skip it.  You may reach a question later that hints at how to do the one you skipped, and even if that doesn't happen, you can feel more comfortable with the questions you know, and maximize the points you get on the test.  Save the toughest ones for last and don't freak out; have faith in your intelligence.

5) Write a cheat sheet.  Oh, the test doesn't allow them?  Write one anyway.  See, the idea behind a cheat sheet is to make the material readily accessible.  But if you work out a cheat sheet for long enough, by the time you've completed it, the information will be where it's needed most: in your head.

6) Practice, practice, practice.  This applies especially to math majors out there.  Do the problems/questions over and over and over again until it becomes second nature to you.  Mastery of the test material will allow you to breeze confidently through any test and wreck the curve.

7) Don't think too much.  This goes hand in hand with panicking.  If you start thinking to yourself, ""Ugh, I can't get this question, so I'm not gonna pass the quiz, and then I'll fail the class and never graduate and never be able to get a job boo hoo,"" you're not going to get anywhere.  Don't think too much about the long term; your task is the exam right in front of you.  Stay focused.

Well those are all I can think of.  Hopefully these tips will help you raise your test scores.  They seem to work for me."

"event","Well, I only have EIGHT SCHOOL DAYS LEFT.  So I thought I'd go over what college was like from the start.

First year (Cuyamaca College) - The freedom of scheduling and the idea of sleeping in on school nights, it was a real breath of fresh air.  Until I hit my 2nd semester and got the hell-on-Monday schedule that kept me in classes from 10 AM to 10 PM on Mondays.  Yeesh.  But my two years spent on Cuyamaca were definitely worthwhile.  I left with some good tips on how to perform at UCSD.  It was also during my first year that 9-11 happened.  Now I wonder how many people remember that we're fighting a war in Afghanistan...

As far as education is concerned the first two years, my first concern was the TAG program.  My other option was to take the SATs late and go to SDSU for 3 1/2 years after 1 semester at Cuyamaca.  More expensive, and UCSD was a better institution.  Hm, I wonder which I should have done...ha.

UCSD - year 1

This was my first experience with programming classes, and it was a rough one.  The B+ in CSE 8A shouldn't fool anyone.  I think it was when I finished program #4 that I realized I could do Java pretty well.  It was also my first taste of upper-division mathematics, yielding another B+.  Partial Differential Equations was a real chore.  But when an Asian asks you for help on math homework, you know you're a pretty smart dude.

Notably, on my first day at UCSD I got into my first traffic accident.  And it was my fault too.  I was really shaken.  It was bad enough that I was so nervous about school that I nearly puked.

CSE 12 is one of the toughest, if not THE toughest, class I've ever taken.  The professor was an ass, and the TAs were only semi-helpful at best.  I think this is when I ditched my procrastination habits for good...I learned the hard way in CSE 12 and got a C+.  But I still contest that the midterm and final were BULLSHIT.  Cryptography may have been the second-most fun class I've taken.
It was around this time I lost my great grandma to old age and intestinal problems...

MCWP 125 was an upper-division writing course for transfer students, a class that I worked extremely hard in for a B.  We did 2 11-12 page essays on The Tempest, Shakespeare's last play.

UCSD - Year 2

The lower division agenda was almost finally finished.  With only 3 more lower division classes to take, I was giddy with excitement over the prospect of taking nothing but upper-division math and CSE classes.  But Math 103A-B proved to be extremely difficult, with low curves to boot.  I set the curve in probability theory class and finally adapted to the quick pace of UCSD.  I also took a break from programming for a quarter (fall) after the madness of CSE 12.  Everything started to click when I got to CSE 30 (assembly language).

The spring quarter saw my first all-upper-division schedule:CSE100, USP107, and Math102.  USP107 was the 'american cultural diversity' requirement I had to fill, and I totally BSed the class and got an A.  Wow.  I redefined procrastination in that class...xD

My overall GPA was pushed above 3.5 after I got my first straight-A report card (A, A-, A in winter).  I think by then I was used to the system and finally kicked some of my old procrastination habits that were more permissible in a quarter system.

UCSD - Year 3

I took a summer class on combinatorial game theory.  The most fun class I ever took.  Easy A.  And afterwards was CSE 101, which rivaled CSE 12 in difficulty, possibly even surpassed.  I was below the average on midterm #1 and was in a panic.  Then I busted my ass studying and got an A- in the class...wtf?

The homework scores were astronomically low.  I've never seen such low average HW scores before.  One mistake costs you almost every point.

Math 170A was an adventure too.  The problems required a lot of complexity and cleverness to solve the proofs.  But after almost 2 years of doing proofs I felt right at home.

Now there are 8 days left in Actuarial mathematics, mathematical programming, and computation theory.  And this could be the quarter I nail down a 4.0.  2 quizzes and 3 finals remain...

If theres anything I can take out of this 5 years, it's the fact that adaptation is one of the most important qualities you can posess.  You have to be able to cope with and go with change.  It'd be nice if things would never change, but we all need to get jobs and crap like that.  Flexibility is a very important quality to have.

My obsession with these three games has finally come to a close, though I may take a few more looks at the FFXII demo.  It shows much promise.

By the way...for those worried about FFXII's plot:

The plot is the icing and the gameplay is the cake.  If you don't like the icing, scrape it off and ignore it, and just enjoy the cake.  That's what I do.  I'm not saying that plots are entirely unimportant; they're not.  Just as the best cakes would also have the best icing, some of the best games also have great plots (Final Fantasy Tactics, etc).  But a bad plot won't necessarily ruin a game if it's a ton of fun.

"event","Here's another scrumptious review morsel to sink your teeth into.  Devil May Cry 3.

Graphics: B+

For the most part the graphics are unremarkable for PS2 games, but it's not like they're completely hideous.  Besides, some of the special effects turned an eyebrow from me.  Mission 18 bumps this grade up to a B+.

Gameplay: A

This game is HARD.  You're gonna have a really hard time with this game on your first go-through.  And after dying enough it unlocks easy mode for you, as if to spit on your face.  Even easy mode is pretty hard.  But the style system and the vast array of weapons, from the guitar-axe Nevan to the twin blades Agni & Rudra, give this game a heavy dose of ass-kickery and awesome flavor.  Just try not to break your controller.

Plot: A-

The plot isn't all that complex but more than makes up for it in presentation.  These are some of the best action scenes I have ever seen in a video game.  Physics?  Blasphemy.  Don't need 'em.  :D  I can live without physics in a video game.  The action is awesmome in this game.  That's all I have to say.

Sound/Music: B+

From the clash of blades to the blasting of music, DMC3's experience is well-enriched by the sound quality and the theme music, however repetitive it may be.  This game's music is awesome, and it intensifies the battles.  The cutscene music isn't bad either.

Overall: A-

This game is freaking awesome, and freaking hard.  Unfortunately you have to be 18 now to buy this game yourself, which is a shame because it kicks a lot of ass.  Get this game ASAP if you haven't gotten it and you like action games."

"event","I'm not giving this one a review, because, well, it's a demo.  But I will say that it gave me a very good first impression, visually and gameplay-wise.  Although I must say, it kinda plays like an MMORPG.  Relax, it's gonna be single-player, and they're working on this game for another seven months.  Yeah, yeah, there are plenty of people who have lost faith in the series, and I've heard more than enough.  And consequently condemning the game to poor reviews over half a year before it's even released.  Relax, people.  I think they're just trying to get it right rather than rush it like they did FFX.

I have high hopes for this game.  Some noteworthy things:

-The summons seem to have new names all of a sudden.
-The female lead uses a sword as well.  This has to be an FF first.  You know what I mean.
-This game says wait mode is for thinking players and active mode is for thrillseekers.  Newsflash: Wait mode doesn't require much thinking.  Come on, it's an FF game.  And thrillseeking is best done outside the realm of RPGs.

Well, did anyone else get the chance to check out this demo?"

"event","Another delicious review for you to sink your teeth into.  Deeeee-lish.

Graphics: C

Honestly, I'm not a big fan of the cartoony graphics ever since I played Wild Arms 3.  I honestly like the old-school flavor of foes, but...come on.  There are better ways to make visual effects in games than this.  I could have done without the enemies who looked like drag queens.

Gameplay: C+

Before this I had only played 1 and 2.  And I see very little differences from 2 and 8, aside from the alchemy and the skill system (which make this game fun).  I'll give this game the benefit of the doubt because I enjoyed it, however.  There's a serious problem though...the game LAGS.  This is the kind of thing that should never, ever happen in a console game.  EVER.

Plot/Storyline: B-

The plot is unremarkable and there aren't many twists and turns.  I bumped this to a B- for one reason: Yangus.  The way he talks and acts is quite...amusing.  And, well, it's a nice addition to such a cartoony game.  Ending's too long for my tastes...that's become a problem with RPGs.

Sound/Music: A-

This was the best part of the game by far.  Sure, it's kinda Disney-esque, but that's what I like about it.  It at least kept me from falling asleep during battles like some games do (FFX).  The sound effects are what keep this game from getting a solid A in this category.

Overall: B-

This really isn't all that bad of a game, but the thing is it's gonna sell millions because it comes with a demo for FFXII.  That kinda ticks me off in that it's a strategy employed by Square-Enix to make this game more successful.  However, I did enjoy DQ8, and you might if you don't mind the laggy gameplay and cartoony graphics.  It's a fun little game that will take quite a bit of time to finish."

"event","Here's my tasty morsel on good old SC3.

Graphics: A-

The graphics are outstanding, on par with the likes of Xenosaga Episode 2.  THX certified, biznatch.  Smooth and flawless.  Sometimes, however, they get kinda choppy, depending on what character you're using in Tales of Souls when Zasalamel transforms.  That's the only thing keeping this game from an A in my mind.  Excellent character designs.

Gameplay: A

Take Soul Calibur 2.  Add an RPG-ish strategy game.  Add a ton of stuff to unlock.  Now add more characters and challenging missions.  Add them all up and you get the ass-kickery that is Soul Calibur 3.  The button-mash-fest that was SC2 is no more.  You can't adjust the difficulty and make it any easier.  This game is the most time-consuming tournament fighter I've ever played, and I've had too much fun with it.  Although those losing streaks make me want to piledrive my controller through the wall, it just goes to show how awesome and enthralling this gameplay experience is.  Hail Soul Calibur 3.

Plot/Storyline: B

For a tourney fighter, they put a decent amount of work into the storyline, namely for Chronicles of the Sword.  It's a passable plot at best, but it also keeps me interested.  The deal with the 'main' characters, however, seems to be sort of linear.  Then again, you shouldn't play this kind of game for the storyline.

Sound/Music: A+

The music just seeps out the feel of an arena.  If you don't feel ready to fight and raise hell after the announcement of round one, you don't have a pulse.  The clash of blades and voice acting are certainly good enough (I don't listen to the Japanese voices, because I don't know Japanese and I just don't care that much, if that bothers you then too bad).  The element of sound blends nigh-flawlessly with the atmosphere of the gameplay.

Overall: A

This is a truly awesome game, and it's what Soul Calibur 2 should have been.  And now that I've finished Dragon Quest 8 I can re-obsess over this game.  Woot!  Best tournament fighter I've played yet.

Get this game now."

And to subsequently blame the media for the sudden faltering of national security?  Way to go, you idiot.  Ever heard of freedom of the press?  If you screw up, we are going to hear about it.  And we deserve to, you moron.

Speaking of the media...is it a wonder that people are constantly fooled by television shows and crappy music videos that we're not going to win the war on terror?  The next idiot who makes a music video about their shallow misunderstandings of war gets punched in the kidneys.  Every time there's a big news story, it's bad news.  How many people knew Mother Teresa existe before she died?  How many anti-war protestors don't know hat the hell they're talking about?  My point is this.  Everyone is a liar in some way or another.  Everyone has a personal agenda to push.  The only real difference between people and politicians is that the politicians are better at it.  Keep your agenda to yourself and spare me the two-paragraph blurb on why Christians are hypocrites.  Sheesh.

This Happy Holidays thing is driving me crazy.  If you say Happy Holidays to cover all the bases, that's fine.  But if it's December 25th and all other religious holidays are pretty much over, and you're still saying Happy Holidays, I have a new word for such an act.  I call it censorship.  You heard me.  Loud and clear.  If you celebrate Hannukah, then it's cool.  Or Kwanza, or whatever other religious holidays exist within the immediate period of time that I may be unaware of.This is not an issue of religion to me.  It's a matter of censorship.  Censoring the work Christmas and replacing it with Holiday, even though the references to common Christmas practices are glaringly obvious.  Quit beating around the bush.  I'm so tired of this.  Christmas is supposed to be a time of joy and fellowship, and there's a vast minority of grinches trying to take Christmas away from America.  The political correctness has gone way too far.  Why don't all the atheists oppose the observation of Hannukah?  Where do you draw the line?  If you don't observe Christmas, that's perfectly fine.  If you're offended by Christmas, then maybe you just don't like the horrible things associated with it, like joy, fellowship, that sort of thing.  I don't see why such a hollow view of Christmas can be so widely accepted in today's society.

Is this political correctness garbage supposed to take over every facet over our life?  It's CHRISTMAS.  If you don't celebrate Christmas, don't observe it.  Stop trying to ruin everyone else's fun.

Easy enough for a Christian to say, right?  The Michael Newdows of the world are united as one against the evils of Christianity (sarcasm, duh).  You know, if the atheists are so hellbent on taking Christmas out of everything, why don't they treat it as if it didn't exist?  Because Christmas is a holiday, and they get the day off, that's why.  As soon as it becomes too inconvenient for them to go through with their beliefs, they back down.  Hypocrites.  While we're at it, why don't we make a fuss about Hannukah?  I'm not Jewish, but I don't have a problem with Hannukah.  I just don't observe it.

Honestly, if you choose to vehemently reject all things Christian, you might as well not bother acknowledging the existence of Christmas.  But I have a serious beef with these killjoys.  If you want to follow your beliefs, fine.  Don't butt into everyone else's business.  It's called Christmas for a reason (and I don't mean the Santa-ized version either).  To simply replace 'Christmas' with 'Holiday' means you think it's a holiday with no real meaning or purpose; just a day off to party and eat pizza with cult buddies.  Honestly, that's an insult.  But hey, I can take it.

Then put up the sword in a glass case and sell it on ebay, and donate the entire sum to a church offering out of spite.

For those who are offended by Christianity, or any belief coinciding with it or lying within it, or any people who practice it:  please, enough.  We're not perfect, least of all me.  And until people can look past other people and read the Bible and learn what Christianity is all about, don't bother slandering me with the token statements ""God hates fags"" or ""Christians are too narrow-minded"" or (insert slanderous comment about religion here).  I'm tired of it.  I won't bore you with a generic theological rant because frankly I'm not worried about theology as much as I'm worried about being a decent person (after all I believe that's what my religion calls for first and foremost).

A simple explanation of what I mean:

(This is in the context of my religion.  If you disagree, that's fine by me.)

Jesus Christ said that the two most important commandments were:

(1) Love God with all your heart and all your soul and all your strength.
(2) Love your neighbor as yourself.

When you see a Christian punching somebody in the face, frankly I don't think it's out of love, so it's safe to say that particular person isn't being very Christian at the moment.  You get my drift?

Because apparently there's a general consensus that religion closes minds and gives people the impression that they know everything they'll ever need to know.  But that's not what my religion says.  By the misinterpretation of the Bible people have done some pretty stupid stuff.  What's sad is that people like me are associated with this past image constantly, and unfairly.

Just making a point here.

On a side note, I think I may have found the most biased liberal newspaper ever.  It's the ""New Frontier"", a piece that seems to come out once per quarter.  Strewn with anti-Republican propaganda and stories that were news many months ago, I have never seen such garbage printed so frequently since......wait, can't think of anything.

Wow, forgot about Newdow.  See, there's this little thing called the 1st Amendment.  You may have heard of it.  This crazy document lets you say pretty much anything you want, but apparently Newdow would like to think the government will have no problem changing ALL of its currency to exclude the words ""In God We Trust"".  Screw the economy, some atheist wants to force his belief on the country.  Bah.  The moral of the story is to put the rights of people before your religious beliefs.  Or something."

"event","Two things have amused me lately.  Both have to do with elections.

First off was the special election in California that happened yesterday.  Propositions 73-80 (of which 4 were pushed hard by the Governator) all failed to pass.  Wonderful.  $50 million in taxpayer dollars used to get absolutely nothing done, in Arnold's push for more power.  He already took us for fools in the recall election, when the mantra of the people was ""Anyone but Davis"".  Now that we've had a couple of years to check out Arnold, people are pretty pissed off.

I, for one, don't think that his master plan to balance the budget by taxing the hell out of Native Americans (yes I'm being politically correct, if you don't like it, then get bent) was the most well-thought-out plan.  But what's this?  The man who said he'd never hear out special interest groups has taken more money from said groups than Davis?  The man who bombards us with crappy movie-related lines and power-grabbing initiatives while squandering millions of taxpayer dollars thinks California is going to put up with his BS?  Sorry, Arnold.  We're simply not that kind of people.  So screw you.

Another thing: The San Diego Mayor election.  It was bad enough when thousands of people were too stupid to fill in the bubble by the write-in space when Frye's name was written in.  Because of that little screw-up, Frye lost the election.  Goes to show what kind of idiots support an aging hippy like Donna Frye.  Somehow she thinks Qualcomm Stadium would be better off if it was just a park.  Apparently she never heard of the ""Super Bowl"" and the kind of economic prosperity that it can bring to a city.  Especially considering the economic shape San Diego is in (in huge pension debts and with empty seats at the city council because of some dirty deals).  So Frye lost last year, and Dick Murphy resigned shortly after winning the election.  Now, a new election: Frye vs. Sanders.  Sanders won, probably because Frye wanted to raise taxes.  Congratulations, Frye.  You deserved to lose.  I'm tired of the activist hippy bullshit.  Get bent already.

I've seen a pattern amongst Republicans and Democrats in Congress, too.  It seems as if Republicans often try to find solutions to issues like social security and such, but let's face it.  There is no instant magical cure.  And even though it helps the situation a little, Democrats insist on waving the magic wand and making things all better.  Here's a few examples, brought up in 2004 before the Bush-versus-Kerry election.

John Kerry wanted to shove hundreds of millions of dollars in medicare.  Bush's proposed spending in that area was nowhere near that.  Kerry, the democrat, trying to find an instant solution.  Bush, trying to make it a little better.  Kerry bashes Bush for not going further, when the fact is that he thinks he can pull that kind of money out of his ass.  Idiots, the both of them.  Kerry moreso.

Balancing the budget.  See, Kerry likes to think Bush was an irresponsible spender, even though we had that little thing called 9-11 which buried our economy in a pretty deep hole.  I don't care who's in office; something like this is gonna screw up your budgeting plans big-time.  Kerry somehow insisted that the budget could be balanced by the pay-as-you-go program.  Then he had the audacity to look at a camera and say he'd never raise taxes on the middle class, and still have the money to spend on these ridiculous programs he proposed.  Gah...moron.  Any semi-educated dipshit can see through that shallow promise.  Ever heard of trade-offs?

The more I look into politics, the more and more I see how much people can be dipshits.  They're a bunch of kids who can't play in the same sandbox, for crying out loud.  And now they're grandstanding on issues they shouldn't be sticking their noses in, like steroids in baseball and the video game industry.  YAWN.  Why don't you politicians start working for the people that elected you already?

Unfortunately they did not completely do away with te romantic crap (WORST LINES EVER).  Every time Anakin says something stupid...hmm, I sense a drinking game.  Or a patented Dragon Kick to Anakin's testicles.

Lightsabers are awesome, and this movie had plenty of them.  Can't go wrong with a fast-paced duel in a volcano.  Hell yeah.  But...this movie could have done without a few things:

1.  Jar Jar Binks.  We had made it through the entire movie without that bastard, and near the end, the camera cuts to Jar Jar Assmunch grieving on camera.  Ugh.  I thought they finally rid themselves of that plague.  I guess we can count of George Lucas to piss us off.

2.  Droids.  All the droids were stupid, weak, and almost worthless.  R2D2 runs around getting shot and kicked in the face, and C3PO runs around as Padme's butler.  General Grievous somehow manages to lose when using 4 lightsabers at once.  Idiots, all of them.

3.  The ending.  We all know Luke's on Tatooine and Leia's on Alderaan, shut the hell up already.

Graphics: B

These graphics aren't all that remarkable for a PS2 game (maybe the system's already been pushed to its limits with Xenosaga Episode 2).  But the character designs...some of them are just stupid.  Why the main character has a fannypack, I'll never know.  Then you have a huge, strong wrestler who wears a butterfly mask, a slew of wrestlers who insist on waving their asses in front of the game camera (and zoom in just as the fight starts).  Now excuse me while I try to think of what character designs were good.  Anastasia's was good and true to her persona (it gets pretty frickin' cold in Russia after all).  And Kurando is awesome, too.  The problem is that there are just too many questionable characters in terms of their sexuality.  It's a shame, too, because a lot of the settings are well done, but overshadowed by the veritable tsunami of innuendo.

This game will frustrate you to hell and back with the Judgement Ring system.  For those who don't know what I'm talking about, it's a ring where you have to stop a spinning hand on the correct area of the ring in order to successfully perform an attack/spell/use an item.  Once you get used to this, however, it will reward you with extra items and exp/cash/fusion souls at the end of battle, so at least it's worthwhile.  Remember those money troubles you usually have in RPGs where you end up having to fight for 10 minutes to buy that shiny new sword?  No more, for you can do a judgement ring to get discounts and mark-ups at shops.  So this isn't necessarily the type of RPG that will consume your life just to prepare for the next leg of the journey, which is a nice change of pace.  The addition of Sanity Points, however, will drive you insane in boss battles if you can't make it quick.

Plot/Storyline: C+

The only reason this game isn't getting a C or lower is because when a character's words/actions piss me off, I think he should get his ass beat, and sometimes, it actually happens.  Amusement in the storyline at least kept me interested in what was otherwise a lackluster, simple plot that I understood in spite of never playing the original.  Yawn.

Sound/Music: B-

This is one of those games where the same music seems to play in just about every dungeon.  The choice of music is pretty good in the boss battles, adding to the intensity of facing a powerful enemy, trying to get that judgement ring just right.  But outside of that, the same bland, uninspired tracks play in most dungeons of the game.  And the sound effects?  Well, they're certainly more passable.  Variety, please.

Overall: C+

You probably averaged out the grades and wondered how I came up with a C+.  Here's why: TMI.  Too much innuendo.  Seriously.  Games are about gameplay, taking up challenges from powerful bosses and kicking serious ass.  Not a bunch of fruitcakes running around shaking their asses and talking about bondage and sweat.  Honestly, I can do without all of it, and this would be a much better game.  Much better.

As for the game itself, it's really quite fun to play once you get down to it.  So long as you can endure the Judgement Ring system and continually rip off awesome 50+ hit combos, you'll salivate at the power you've gained.  I'd give this game a lot more credit if they put more emphasis on this.  I'm surprised Midway made this game.  Very surprised."

"event","A little something for those who are wondering if this game is good.

Graphics: B-

The graphics in this game are passable for a PS2 game, but not at all remarkable. What makes the graphics interesting is the numerous interactive objects in just about every single screen, providing a bloodbath of traps and obstacles.  What more can you ask for than knocking an enemy into a catapult?  The graphics need some work though.

Gameplay: B

There's just something about the intensity of Mortal Kombat games that keeps me hooked on the series, possibly making my review less objective.  However, gameplay is fast-paced enough to keep a gamer interested (unless you'd rather play tranquil, slow-paced games like Gladius or LotR:The Third Age that lull you to sleep in even the most intense of battles).  The arenas play a big part in the overall fun factor.  Inventing ways to devour your prey and feasting on the bloodbath that has become a signature trademark of Mortal Kombat games makes your eyes widen as if to say ""o_o omg"" or ""...cool :D"".  At least they managed to make this game somewhat challenging.

Plot/Storyline: D+

...once you get to the end of the game you'll realize this is a plot you've seen before.  I'm not going to spoil it for you, but the plot has very few twists and turns, and a slew of familiar bosses.  This game is all about the gameplay, so it's forgiveable...but if Midway keeps shoving its seeking hands into the pits of the past, this series may fall into the deep, murky, detestable bowels of fanservice.

Sound/Music: C

The music just doesn't add the intensity to the fights in this game.  A little too tranquil for a Mortal Kombat game.  Of course, the overflow of blood has no shortage of leaky sound effects, which is as much a part of the series as the blood itself now.  For some reason, though, I never get tired of Liu Kang's turkey-like gobbling as he performs his patented Bicycle Kick...

Overall: C+

I can't really say this is an awesome game, but it's a lot of fun if you're a fan of the DMC-style slaughtering of Oni, mercenaries, and trademark MK characters.  And a fan of the MK series itself, which I am.  But this game really isn't all that remarkable, and the only way it really stands out is the extreme blood flow, which it has stood out for ever since the first game hit arcades about 12 years ago.  Otherwise, it's a pretty standard game.  If you want a good MK game, buy Deception."

"event","So the other day I'm at school.  It's the whole summer class routine.  Easy to get a parking space, thank God.  I forget to get some change out of my car for a can of soda, so I enter and get a few quarters out, and lock it shut.  Then my right hand slides in my right pocket to deposit said quarters, but something is wrong.  I look behind me to see my keys on the front passenger seat.  In my locked car.  Damn.

I simply went to class as usual and decided to worry about it later.  Once class was over I tried contacting mom to get her to bring me my spare car keys.  Home phone rings, no answer.  Cell phone rings, it's off.  Wonderful.  I'm stranded at UCSD for the time being, right?  Wrong.

I take a look in my backpack, wondering if there's anything I can use.  The car windows are a bit cracked open, so air gets in there, but not hands.  Taking a look at my old spring quarter 3-subject notebook, I begin taking the metal spiral binding thing and unwinding it, removing it from the notebook.  It took me about 20 minutes to remove it.  Another 10 minutes or so are spent bending, or at least trying to bend, the flimsy metal material into the shape I need to reach the car keys.  Many heavy sighs later, I slip it into my car.

Making a few adjustments on my little makeshift hook, I slowly slide it to and fro until it finally latches onto the key ring.  Tugging on it softly, the keys lift and come closer to the door, but quickly drop.  Once again, I try hooking it around the key ring, and now I slowly pull the car keys upwards, carefully.  Calmly watching the keys slowly rise, the key ring leans over the top of the cracked window as my fingers hook into the key ring.  Success!

I felt awesome.  Corny as this story is, it's a testament to improvising."

Star Wars:  GAWD.  When I got into the original Trilogy at around age 13, I was really into it.  I was a pretty big Star Wars geek.  I collected cards from the CCG and I have a Trivial Pursuit game for it, which I pwnz at.  Until Episode 1.  One of the biggest travesties in theater history.  Jar Jar Binks?  I never thought any character could suck more (until Brother in FFX-2, who I will get to in a minute).

TOO MUCH POLITICAL CRAP.  That sums up about 95% of the movie.  And Anakin Skywalker sitting in the Naboo starfighter going ""OMGLOL I CAN FLY AROUND AND SHOOT STUFF WOW!

Then there was Episode 2.  You know, I could trace the decline of Star Wars in almost the same way as the Final Fantasy series: CORNY ROMANCE.  The hell is up with Padme and Anakin.  Someone shoot them in the face.  Now.  At least Ep 2 had more action in it...but come on.  Sheesh.  I haven't bothered to watch episode 3 yet.

I actually put my fan on medium speed today.  Something I almost NEVER do because I'm not going to live in a refridgerator anytime soon.

Nothing like 2 liters of Sprite to at least keep myself somewhat hydrated.  :P  And as far as video games are concerned, I've been quite occupied with Star Ocean: Till the End of Time.  A good name for this game if you ask me.  If you plan on getting all the Battle Trophies, that's how long you'll be playing this game (Metropolis members, you may have read my thread already...or not).  Some of these are STUPID.

-Fight 50000 Battles (I have fought about 2600 so far over the course of one complete game, meaning beating all the super-bosses).
-500 consecutive lone battles
-Chain of 500 Bonus Battles (Yeah.  I got to 438 and the GAME FROZE.)

Oh, about the super-bosses.  Here are some strategems I have devised.

Gabriel Celestia
HP: 1 million

Lenneth
HP: 7 million

Ethereal Queen
HP: 10 million

Freya (not the FF9 Freya, mind you)
HP: 20 million

This is the point where you have to synthesize ATK/DEF+30% factors to your good weapons.  A lot of them.  If you do this you become an unstoppable fighting force and this guy is cake.  Otherwise...don't try.

Some of the battle trophies require beating these bosses, without taking damage, in a time limit, using only certain attacks...bah.  Insanity.  But at least you can fight them as many times as you want (except Lenneth).  I recommend this game.  Wootness.

Currently I have 174 battle trophies and need 21 more to unlock 4D Mode, the game's highest difficulty.  So glad I got Music Mode.  :D

(1) Army of Darkness

How do I start?  There's almost no plot buildup whatsoever; just a guy with a chainsaw for an arm who kicks a lot of ass.  The main character, Ash.  He runs around stomping people's heads into the ground for about 90 minutes.  Some good one-iners in this movie too, but I won't ruin it for anyone.  All you need to know is that this movie gives you a good serving of ass-kickery with a side of beatdown.

(2) The Big Lebowski

This is apparently an older movie about a bum who lives in L.A. and does nothing but bowl.  His character is the epitome of the ultimate I-don't-give-a-damn style of sarcasm.  One scene for example is near the beginning when two mobsters mistook him for someone else and took his bowling ball off the floor and asked, ""What is this?""  To which he replied, ""Obviously, you're not a golfer.""  This movie is hilarious.

(3) Big Trouble in Little China

Say whatever you want about Asian stereotypes; I for one don't believe any of them.  Banter aside, this movie features about 4 or 5 20-minute blodks of ass-kicking, with slight 2-minute breaks for ""plot"" buildup (which is a term I use loosely here because this movie has no real plot, just plenty of guys kicking ass, which is all good to me).  Lo Pan doesn't take shit from anyone, either.

In an era of civil rights movements and fearless stands in the face of an antebellum southern hostility, this man stood up and played for the Brooklyn Dodgers out od spite and love for the game of baseball.

The significance of his actions still lives on today.  Think about it.  He played in an era where we probably got booed and put up with tons of racial slurs throughout his career.  And yet he did not care.  All he did was play, and play well.

Now look at sports today.  Like when Ron Artest blitzed the stands after a cup of beer was thrown on him.  If Jackie Robinson had done that it would have been a serious deterrent for the status of racial diversity in sports.

It was because a mechanic left his damn screwdriver on the wing of the plane.

So instead of simply clearing the tool off the plane, like they should have done, they escorted all the passengers off of the plane, searched every single seat, and undoubtedly gave a rigorous inspection to every passenger on the plane, everything short of a beast raping.

Since when is a discarded screwdriver synonymous with a terrorist plot?  Security to get on an airplane is anal enough as it is.

Granted, only the bigger sports organizations (NFL, MLB, NHL, NBA) ever hit 7 figures, but the fact remains that the increasing salaries are beginning to catch up with their wallets.

The economics of many smaller organizations have caused monuental collapses.  A women's soccer league was unable to continue to run due to a general lack of funds and ability to sell tickets, in spite of the fact that the WUSA was formed shortly after a memorable run at the 1999 Women's World Cup.  The players' union faced an economic crisis that would soon end the running of the said organization, so what did they do?  Something unprecedented in the history of sports.

They took a 40% pay cut.

Unfortunately, even that failed to curb the WUSA's inevitable deficits.  With the retirement of Mia Hamm, a beloved sports icon, along with Shannon McMillan, among others, the future of women's soccer rests in the hands of younger talent which includes the likes of Andy Wambach and others (no, I don't know a lot about women's soccer).  It certainly doesn't seem that these passionate players will get the national stage they have sought after for so many years, unless they perhaps win another World Cup.  Even then it seems as if the economics of the WUSA cannot sustain a league for a prolonged number of years.  What a shame.

More recent episodes include the NHL lockout.  This sad story came about over a labor dispute with the players' union, and it doesn't seem to be getting any better.  A recent proposition, rejected by the players' union, included a salary cap of $42 million for each team, among other things.  The talks going back and forth seem to get worse.  When the comissioner stated the NHL was actually making more money without the season starting, it certainly seemed like the future of NHL hockey, at least this year, was bleak at best.  Now there is talk of cancelling the season altogether.

And if you want to complain about how ridiculous atheletes' salaries are, that's another discussion for another day.  Drop me a comment if you've got anything to say about the NHL lockout.

I'll leave you with a little quote by Brett Hull on SNL, when asked about the proposition of gay marriage in Canada:

The fact so many fans booed for the right reasons instead of cheering for the wrong ones can only be a plus.

GOOD:

Major League Baseball has stiffened its steroid-use penalties.  Apparently the players' union has finally woken up after some high-profile players have either died from complications caused by steroid use, or openly admitted it to the public.  I never had this much respect for Jason Giambi before.  Barry Bonds, on the other hand, is being an ass about it.  He doesn't want to admit anything.  He just wants to break the career home run record.  What a dipshit.  I hope he never gets into the Hall of Fame, but the boneheads who vote for that stuff will let him in anyways.

With stiffened penalties, major league baseball's home run totals will decline.  It's a small price to pay.  Maybe now we'll see a greater emphasis on pitching instead of big-money bashers.  This is a strong declaration against steroid use, but there is still progress to be made.

BAD:

The hoopla over Randy Moss' gesture to the Packer fans last Sunday.  You know, it's a stupid double-standard.  It's Green Bay tradition every time the visiting bus leaves the stadium for the fans (about 60 or so of them) to go out and moon the visiting team bus.  What Randy Moss did was blown way out of proportion.  A $10000 fine on this guy isn't much considering the money he makes, but I don't think he deserved it at all.  If you're wondering what I'm talking about, this is about a Vikings player who, after scoring a touchdown, got in front of the crowd and pretended to moon the fans.  Apparently everybody thinks this guy's Terrell Owens all of a sudden.  What a bunch of morons.

"event","Recently, on Christmas, I received a copy of Mortal Kombat: Deception.  And it has completely blown me away.  Such a fast-paced, intricate game is worthy of mention, and then some.  So I decided to (try to) make up my own tribute to this awesome series.

T'was the year of '93, as the company Midway began work on a new tournament fighter in hopes of rivaling Street Fighter.  However, there were about four guys working on this game.  Two programmers, one sound guy, and one motion capture person.  Four guys making a SNES game.  That was IT.  And so the game was released, a bloodbath of a fighting game featuring seven characters, the indominable Goro, and the wily Shang Tsung.  Little did they know the game would quickly take the world by storm.

The extreme nature of Mortal Kombat 1 in arcades got many, many people hooked onto the action.  Surely the blood effects are what garnered much attention and notoriety (and probably some lawsuits too), but it would soon change the face of gaming forever (coughratingsystemcough).  Not to mention Sub-Zero was basically MK's answer to Ryu on Street Fighter 2.

The games continues to come, the characters continued to grow.  Each new bloodbath brought a whole new mix of fatalities, and other -alities.  The Babalities and Friendships of MK2, the Animalities of MK3, the Brutalities of UMK3...along with gaudy challenges for the great warriors, including the slick ninja, Noob Saibot, for those good enough to win 50 consecutive matches.

The release of Deadly Alliance pushed the series away from the arcades, alas.  However, the gameplay has become better than ever now.  The intricacy of the various styles of martial arts is peerless in fighting games today, no titles barred (not even Soul Calibur 2).  Mindless button mashing never works in a MK game.  Such a quality makes this series that much better.

The latest title, Deception, marks a huge expansion of the series.  Bringing back all the glorious nostalgia from MK games of old, this game features a selection among 24 characters (well, 25 technically), along with all the good old beat-'em-up style of Mortal Kombat, with the addition of death traps and background weaponry.  The only thing better than seeing this awesome gameplay experience is beating your friend's face into the wall with a 10-hit combo, and watching them fall into the aforementioned death traps.  Need I say more?

GET.  THIS.  GAME."

"event","Anybody heard about the latest fiasco in baseball?  It's a shame that this came up after a sensational season that saw the Red Sox' first title in 86 years.  Recently, Jason Giambi testified before a grand jury that he took steroids to enhance his performance.  The testimony he gave was very detailed; the man he dealt with, Gary Anderson (I think that was his name), happens to be one of Barry Bonds' best business buddies.  And finally, Bonds has stated he took steroids in ignorance.  I guess it no longer matters that he's set to break the all-time career home run mark.  Way to go, Barry.  You've undermined the game of baseball for personal gain.

Barry Bonds is a bitch.  By saying he took these substances in ignorance, he's trying to shift the blame to those who gave him these things; he simply doesn't want us to believe it's his fault, even hough an ESPN interview with Gary Sheffield of the Yankees indicated Bonds offered these substances to him to enhance his performance.  Cut the bullshit, Barry; grow some new balls.  You're a doper, admit it.  If they don't let Pete Rose into the Hall of Fame, they shouldn't let Barry Bonds into the Hall of Fame.  What a nimrod.  An ego-driven persona such as he doesn't deserve to have a recliner in the locker room.

Also, in a recent 20/20 interview, it was said that about 50% of pro atheletes take some sort of steroid (mostly undetectable, of course).  Not only that, but 80% of atheletes take a stimulant before games and competitions.  Hmm, interesting.  They also managed to bust Marion Jones.  What a damn shame.  Can't atheletes just play clean?  Damn, man, is it too much to ask to play a clean game when you're being paid a king's ransom?  Sheesh.

In the meantime I have one more final exam: abstract algebra.  The first 2 finals were this final's peons.  This last final is going to be 15 kinds of difficult.  When the average scores on all the midterms were 60% and below, you know it's gonna be nuts with everyone studying like mad for the final exam.  I'm no exception either.  But it's still a realistic possibility for me to get straight As this quarter and I'm gonna try as hard as I can.  Even if I get a B in the class, that still gives me a probable A, A, and B (maybe B+), sending my GPA skyward, hopefully above the magical 3.5 mark.  Damn, that would be SWEET.

Good luck to all those who are struggling with similar matters.

On a side note, the Chargers will win at least one playoff game this year."

"event","When the AVERAGE score on a midterm is 13/30 (That's about 43%, a solid F without the aid of a curve), you know something is up with the class.  I almost pissed my pants when I heard the average was that low.  I managed 18/30, which ironically is a 60% high B/low A.  What the heck!?

Finals next week...wish me luck.

Anyone who may have read my long, multi-directional rant from October 3rd may have believed I thought the Chargers had zero shots this year at winning the Super Bowl.  Guess what?  They're 8-3 and a game into first place.  WTF!?  I mean, I'm really thrilled and all, but...reading my post again from Oct 3 I'm also getting kinda nervous at the same time.  o_o;

In the meantime I've been relying on Uniracers (SNES) to keep me occupied.  If you haven't gotten this game, GET IT.  See if it's sold used at any GameStop stores or anything.  This game is a great, fast-paced game.  Sooo much fun to play.  It'll definitely keep you awake.  Diablo 2: LoD has also been keeping me busy, raising my Paladin on battle.net to level 41 at this point...

I really wish I had more to talk about.  Sadly, I don't.  Maybe my life is just too simple sometimes."

"event","Seriously, how long is it gonna be until people realize their incessant bitching about censorship is completely backfiring?  Ever since the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show, people have been in an uproar over decency on television.  Let me tell you something.

If you don't like something, TURN IT OFF/DON'T MESS AROUND WITH IT.  The loudest way you can show your disapproval of something is just that.  It's the power of the consumer.  If you don't want to watch something, turn it off.  If you don't like a certain drink, don't buy/drink it.  That simple.

That being said, recently there was an outcry of complaints regarding a plug for ABC's Desperate Housewives.  There was implied nudity in the scene, so naturally, every feminazi turd and cave-dwelling hermit decided to whine.  But do you know what this does?  IT GIVES THE SHOW MORE PUBLICITY.  Apparently the cries stopped when ABC offered an apology, and still did not cancel the show.  The fact that they're buying this apology and letting it slide is testament to how weak some people are.  Seriously, what are these people trying to accomplish?  ABC is not gonna cancel the show, and now the fact that this became a big story is going to boost the show's ratings.

Stick to your guns, America.  Turn it off if you don't like it.  It's not ABC's job to babysit your kids and play Disney movies all day."

"event","Yesterday in Detroit during a Pacers-Pistons game (NBA), everyone went apeshit.  Ron Artest apparently got hit in the back by a cup of ice or something (probably a drink), and the genius decided to blitz the stands and beat the crap out of the guy.  Brilliant.  It resulted in an all-out melee between players and fans, and when all was said and done, several players (STAR players, not like second-string players) were indefinitely suspended, and criminal charges could be filed.

Which begs the question: When are fans going to stop being dumbasses and stop throwing their crap on the field?  Beers are 8 bucks at a stadium and they throw it on somebody else?  Waste of money, waste of time.  What idiots.  And come on people, kids go to these games.  What are you gonna tell your kid after people start getting drunk and beating the hell out of one another?  This is a game, people.  Holy shit.

And now to the atheletes: What the hell are you doing!?  Your opponents are on the court, not in the stands.  Stay on the court and do your damn job.  You're not in prison; you're a damn professional.  Act like one.  This is why I think players shouldn't have contracts.  If you pull this in any other workplace, you'd be fired.  This is bullshit.

Long story short, players and fans need to learn to behave.  This idiocy is killing what little sanctity sports have left."

"event","I'm really, really excited and nervous right now.  My grades in all 3 of my classes could possibly end up being straight A's.  The next two weeks are going to bo nerve-wrecking because I've never pulled it off before.  I have one more midterm (it's on Monday), and I really want to nail it so that I can stay above the curve.  It's not going to be easy either, but today I was looking over the homework, and I really think I can do well on the midterm.  But right now it's cautious optimism paired with excessive studying.  Considering I don't have a job and my interest in video games has dropped a bit lately, school is the main thing on my mind right now...well, that and RPing.  The biggest challenge is getting my priorities straight, and that's what may make or break the grade.

I think I've irritated enough people in my probability class.  I got 99% on the first midterm, the high score.  Set the curve.  Well, since it's a bell curve it doesn't matter (67 was the average, but 64 was still a B-) (No, that is not a smiley).  Ranking's what it's all about in my classes...

It just now hit me.  All 3 of my final exams are comprehensive.  Oh crap.  That means a mad study blitz for a whole fuggin week.  Ugh.  I like classes that don't have comprehensive finals...it's a lot less stressful.  Man, why does it have to be like this...?"

"event","Here's my unofficial review.  I'll be assigning grades A-F for each category.

Graphics: B

Graphics on the PS2 are hardly believed to be capable of going much farther than they are now and the graphics of this game aren't outstanding, but nevertheless very smooth.  Cutscenes were few and far between and the graphics in them was nothing too special, but still very well done.

Gameplay: A

This was the first time I had ever played a Star Ocean game, and the battle system blew me away.  I thought Grandia 2's system was awesome, but this one was even better IMO.  Item Creation adds a big new dimension to the gameplay as well, along with item synthesis.  This grants a wide variety of items and loads of opportunities.  The only thing that keeps me from giving this category an A+ is that damn Bunny Race.

Plot/Character Depth: B-

This game suffers from what I will now call FF8 Syndrome, where the game developers seemed to make shit up as they went along.  The plot itself is great up until about chapter 4 where it stops making sense.  Though the main reason why this gets a B- is because the characters don't change their personalities.  They seem to gel pretty well, and Cliff has to be the most entertaining of the bunch.  But the ending SUCKS.

Sound/Music: A-

Whoever wrote the soundtrack to this game deserves a raise.  But not a promotion.  On some boss fights this hip hop stuff starts playing, and I can't stand it.  But for the most part, the music blends really well with the environments.  It envelops the plot really well.

Overall: A-

I loved this game and almost everything about it.  Though the ending left something to be desired, I thoroughly enjoyed this gaming experience, and I plan to play it a few more times.  Get this game!"

"event","w00t my b-day is thursday. 

Yep...I'll be 17...and james won't seem so much like a dirty old man hehe. Love you sweety.

So the birthday stuff has already started.

Monday(yesterday):Tabitha took me to see Spiderman 2 and pig out at in-n-out for my b-day which was very very very nice. heheh just me her and her cousin melissa and at the in-n-out we started oogling asians hehe. Actually we were oogling asians throughout the whole day because there  were a lot in the background of Spiderman 2.  But then the movie got mushy and i was all pouty and missing my Squishy.

Last night: James and I went to see the Terminal with his siblings. His sister ana is adorable lol. Well anyways the terminal was ok kinda sad though but towards the end the guy from the discovery store wanted to give tom hanks a blue ""squishy"" for good luck hehe I started cracking up and hugged my Squishy.

Today: My dad picked me up from workand gave me a card (which made fun of my messy room) that had a 20 in it and then took me to dinner at red lobster which was really yummy. Then we went to Fry's Electronics where my dad bought me a stuffed piggy (exactly what I need lol) and then after we went though the whole store my dad realized he nly bought the pig so he said he had to get me more for my birthday so we got to the wall o' anime and he said ""just keep it under a 100 bucks""I stood there for a good 5 minutes....thinking...what the hell am i going to get? lol. I finally decided on the last two dvds of chobits ( I now have the complete series) and then I could decided what to get so i called tabitha and she couldn't help much ><* (love you tumor) so then I decided on the first dvd of Magical Shopping  Arcade AbenoBashi I went and handed them to my dad and told him that i was a little over 60 bucks all together and he said ""well then you should prbably go get another one"" lol. I ended up getting the 2nd dvds of Abenobashi.but i seriously did not know what to get sooooo here's my question....

For future reference....

Can anyone suggest a good anime for me to collect?"

"event","You know what I hate? People that pretend they're crazy, Or that they're rebelious, or mentally ill. I'm mean seriously Its not kosher. Where I work believe it or not I see a LOT of different people, and when I see these people that are ""psycho"" or ""rebels"" they have recently just really ...irksome. Course at work I gotta smile and put up with it and I guess I'm use to it. but I've just been thinking about it recently since I talked to this one chick. she's a friend of an online friend and we were talking and she brought up how she cuts herself. And I'm thinking ""where the hell did that come from?"" we weren't even on the subject of S.I. it was completely out of no where. Well when my friend got on I found out that his friend (the chick i was talking to) is a spoiled only child. She has nothing to cut herself about. now I know people are thinking ""well you dont her she might have problems that you dont' know about"" No..she ADMITS to slicing for the hell of it argh ARGH people! *twitch* I'm ok...I'm soo ok.....

Work is spiffy. Jessika and Nicole stopped by to see me the other day which ROCKED heheh love you guys I'm so glad you guys came to see me! heheh. They're the first people (besides james) that have come in to bug me at work hehhe. well anyways I get 30% discount folks so if you come in and get something everyonce in a while I'll give people discounts hehe theres lots of pig stuff. Got my first paycheck the last week which also rocked cause that means i don't have to mooch off of my bf or my mom so much.heh. Not that I mooch off of james really cause well i would feel bad.

Wednesday:...What did I do wednesday? I think I hung out with Squishy but I'm not quite sure...I don't recall just sitting around...oh! now I know! we were random and spontaneous and picked up Tabitha and hung out at James' house and then after a while we went and got ice cream which was spiffy because james' sibling are pretty spiffy and I got to hang out with my tumor and my sweety.

Thursday: Ta Da! My first day of work. I was uber nervous but did pretty well. My manger is really funny lol and the only thing i couldnt really do was tie the balloons because of my nails heheh. But other than that Work was really fun the cash register was fun hehe...

Friday: Spent the day with James again hehe we went to the mall to pick up his check. Sw ashley there heh she was like a kid in a candy store at the bookstore couldn't decide what she wanted. I saw something i wanted. Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles are coming out in a collect now the first 3 are in one book. All I have to Say is *droool* hehe For those who have known me for a long time most people know i've been in love with Lestat since....about 4th grade. Too bad Lestat only loves himself ne? Well anyway IT made me want to finish the Vampire Chronicles So I started re reading those (while still reading harry potter which i'm almost done with) and once again I'm stuck on Tale of the Body Theif. oh Lestat you silly silly Vampire. I can't wait to get to Memnoch the Devil...

Today: My brother and I showed our geekdom lol. We drove all the way to san deigo to see the original Godzilla in Japanese. It was great! IT was uncut so there was an extra 40 minutes or so. Which was *drool* hehe I love Godzilla and Ogata was hot hehe too bad the guy that played him is probably all old and wrinkled now. At the theatre they had the cool Trobalones which are spiffy triangle Chocolate bars. very yummy. And now I'm in my dads room taking over his computer. MY dad really knows how to set up a computer. A wireless keyboard and wireless mouse . The mouse pad is attached to a nice coushiny chair Well ok i guess I'm done Gotta go finish reading harry So I can give all my attention To lestat. Cause anyone that knows lestat knows he doesn't like to be ignored.

"event","Today is my first day of work. I'm kinda sorta nervous.I'm working at the hallmark by my house, hallmark isn't really a store where my friends would come bug me ne? but then again why would they ><.

There something wonderful about exposing someone to a new anime. on tuesday tabitha and James came over and we watched the first half of Cowboy Bebop the Perfect sessions. Since i was getting such a great deal(16 bucks each when they usually cost 200) on them I ordered two and ended up giving the second one to my brother as his fathers day gift...needless to say he was very pleased...silly Faye Fanboys.Well anyways yeah it was fun spending the day with them and drooling over spike hehe. I gotta hang out with my friends more often I feel so blah lately. I feel like time has stopped and i'm just kinda here. Actually I'm kinda happy this way lol. I don't know it doesn't feel like summer is all. heh. Oh well I've still got my happiness high lol. 

Squishy: 6 days.

Mookle: In order to get a job because of the cleavage factor you have to have boobs I however am flat so you see i did not get the job because of them lol but good luck on your job hunt.

"event","It seems to me (from reading Rants by <a href=""http://www.psykobabble.com"" target=""_blank"">Armond</a> & <a href=""http://www.sinnocence.com/"" target=""_blank"">Kitty</a>) that most of these net ""goths"" have some things in common.

<b>*They're the only real goths-</b>
   Honestly, these people <u>swear</u> they're the only goths on the planet. Everyone else is a poser. But if thats true how do they know that they are the real things? I mean if they are the ONLY goth in the entire world then they must have no basis for comparison?  You're Goth...whats goth? Wearing bad make-up and writing poetry about dead flowers? Well according to their stereotypes thats what it is and these ""net goths"" seem to stereotype themselves. 
<b>*They're the sexiest thing on the planet-</b>
   You know what...eww...just eww get over your damn selves wipe off some of the greasy make-up off you're ance covered face and get over it! 
<b>*Black=Goth-</b>
   Stereotypes...nough said.

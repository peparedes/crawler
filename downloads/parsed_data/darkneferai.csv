"event","<p>Due to the experiences last year- being stabbed in the back by those I trusted, and recieveing absolutely no help from anyone, my anxieties are off the Richter.&nbsp;<br /><br />I can't leave my house, afraid I will be killed by stray missles (don't laugh, I'm serious) and other worries keep me a prisoner in my own home. I am currently seeking assistance for this, but it's a long journey back to healhy.<br /><br />I want those who have caused me harm to know they are forgiven. Utterly.<br /><br />But like an addict, I want nothing to do with them, I am afraid should we patch things that their presence will cause me further damage. Good luck in the future.</p>"

You are Bluffing!<br /><br />I cant Believe how blinded.<br />How foolish I was to think you could show me the Moon.<br /><br />You cant even see yourself, who you are.<br /><br />I laugh now, when I look back. what was so painful is now just an amusing anecdote.<br />I pity you.<br /><br />I pray the Goddess blesses you with the strength to be the man you are supposed to be... a beacon, a guide, a shining light.<br /><br />Good luck to you.<br /><br />Neferai the Strong.</p>"

"event","Ok, I set out to help certain folks reach an understanding as to why I was so upset. Now it appears they are pulling the exact same shit as everyone else. Instead of being forthright, they are running. WTF??

I am 5'1"" people. Not 8 ft tall. I'm not an ogre or a monster (well any more than anyone else is) and I'm getting REAL tired of being treated like the pariah because they can't handle me...

If you show me that I am wrong, I accept that and try to amend my ways... but if you fucking run or avoid me, you just validate that YOU were the one who fucked up. Why run if you are justified???

So, wht's the deal? I don't look scary. Do I? Look at the user pic and tell me- am I Maleficent, the Ev il queen???


Why don't they want to at least TALK to me? they just run, It is highly annoying....

Unfortunately it came from the least expected place, and it wasn't just for me.  It came from a girl from my DTS class when I was in YWAM, Youth With a Mission.  Yes I know that all of you reading this are probally asking yourselves, how the hell was Amanda in a missionary school? Ok well maybe one of you are asking that question.  Well nevermind, all of you probally know I was a Bible hugger.  Hey don't get angry, I thought it was kinda funny and not in a bad way.  I have Bible hugger friends.  Note the word friends.  Anyways, this girl decided to try to get together a 5 year reunion for our class.  I'm not sure I want to email her back, but I don't want to be mean.  But how exactly am I supposed to break it to them that I've changed so as not to cause some sort of prayer circle starting up that I don't need and/or some intervention bymail?  Somebody give me some feedback as to what to do.  I know that if I respond they will ask me where my relationship with God is.  I've gotten it everytime I run into one of my class (except Danielle and Heidi who are from here) when I see them online.  I f anyone has any ideas please let me know.

"event","As anyone can tell from my last few posts, I must have had a bad time while doing something.  Well the answer to all of this is that I was drunk and had gotten into a little argument.  I was being dumb.  So I went off by myself and had a little pity party that I really didn't need to have.  I really didn't feel like that, but when you're drunk anything will come out.  I'm surprised I was actually able to write anything at that time because I wasn't seeing straight.  We were looking at other posts that night, and it seems I wasn't the only one feeling that way which is kinda funny.
It was a fun night other that that.  Everybody had a blast.
On another nota, I think I forgot to post this a while ago.  When we all went to Ozzfest I had gotten sunburnt.  It is now 3 weeks later, and I am still peeling and my legs are a little red.  I got sun poisoning.  People it's not good to get fried, believe me.  Especially when for 3 weeks you can't scratch any itches because it hurts to do so.

We all went to Ozzfest on Sunday which was amazing other than the fact it was hot and I got immensely burnt.  By immensely burnt I mean It's Wednesday and I am still in pain.  I can't walk very well.  I went to the hospital 2 days later because of the pain.  They gave me Prednisone and Percocet.  I'm feeling grrrreat.  Well semi-great.  The burning and stiffness still sucks but sucks less.  Well maybe I'll have a good tan when the burning is all over.  I wish I could put pictures on here to show how bad it is.  Shawn and I are going to Kings Dominion on Friday and Saturday.  I hope I'm doing better by then.
The Shippensburg Fair is going on this week. It's the happening place to be.  When you're not burnt.

"event","I have now seen Charlie and the Chocolate Factory twice, one with kids and one with friends.  It was an awesome movie, very odd too.  I can't put down the old ones because it is one of my favorte movies, but I think Johnny Depp played Willy Wonka very very well.  He really made him seem childish.   It followed the book, but added some things too.  I won't divulge too much, but it kinda tells Willy Wonka's back stroy which I don't remember in the book.  All in all it was good.  The kids in the movie were good also.  The oompa loompa songs were hilarious with the different genres of music and the sychronized dance routines.  The nut room was funny.  It made me miss Squirrelly.  If you don't know he was, he was the squirrel I raised that we found while living in Waynesboro.
This past weekend The Spectral Facade had another show.  Not a lot of people showed up except people that they invited which showed who actually promoted the show.  The promotions company didn't even promote it very well.  The guys did great anyhow especially when the storm started rolling in with the lightning in the background.  I had a lot of fun and I was messed up too.  My neck still hurts from going crazy when they were playing.
Next week is my vacation and Ozfest to start it off.  I'm going to have a yard sale to get some money for Ozfest.  Hope it goes well.

Jesse ans Bill's friend Christians brought out the fireworks and all hell broke loose.  He lit this thing called Defcon Alert and it shot sideways so we had rockets going off into the woods and springing back out of the woods another way.  We didn't know where to run so we ran back and forth dodging them.  I'm surprised noone was hurt, but we laughed about it afterwards.  They then started shooting bottle rockets at each other. I think everyone reverted back to being 12 years old again.  We heard about it though.  We probally pissed off the neighbors.  It was a night of drunken fun."

The night before we took Shawn's cousin Leslie out. We got trashed and came home and met our neighbors.  Leslie ditched us though and came back to our house at 3 in the morning.  It was a good night, and I went to work hungover.  Today I'm going to the Mountain House to see Complete Circle play then off to Jesse's for a bonfire and an interesting trip.
I saw my brother last night and his family.  I haven't seen him in a while.  He didn't know about my tattoos or my piercings, hell he still thinks I'm a good little christian girl.  That changed a long time ago.  That was a very good change.  Going to Turkey was a major turning point in my life.  Christianity is not for everybody, and don't let anybody tell you otherwise.  All cultures have their own way and every person has their own way.  That's how life was designed.  Don't change for others.  It won't make you happy.

Shawn and I went out to eat and had a very weird day.  That night we watched Episode 3 at home which I couldn't get through because I was so tired.  Saturday I had to work, but it was busy so it went quick.  We drank some Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.  Good ole drinking weekend.  Then of course Memorial Day sucked because I had to work, very boring.  Today I'm sitting at Comics World again very bored, but it's almost over.

"event","So I have this thing I do.  It's called impulse buying.  I do it everytime I go to Walmart or have extra money.  Everytime I go to Walmart I buy a DVD or possibly 2.  I never spend more than 20 dollars each time though.  I think I just enjoy having a big collection.  If I have extra money I think of things from my childhood that I liked and then I look for them on Amazon.  I have now found 2 from my childhood.  The Night They Saved Christmas and The Chronicles of Narnia.  Now the big question is does anyone else remember these or am I just crazy?  The first was a TV movie that my mom copied for me, but I lost it, so I bought a new one, well not really new.  It had Jacquelyn Smith in it.  The other was also TV movies but made in Britain.  I really must be crazy because evn now I can watch them and enjoy them.  There really are times that I can loook back on my childhood and remember good things.  I remember my mom would always take me to the library so I could get 3 books a week.  I loved reading.  I'm thankful that hasn't changed.  Now I am excited to see if the new movie for The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe will be good.  I will definitely be going to see it.  I'm also excited for Batman Begins, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, and The Fantastic Four.

Oh no, I am becoming the crazy picture lady.  I am having a blast doing it.  I became a member of LA Cameras because of how many rolls I have taken in lately.  Just yesterday I took in 12 rolls.  I took in 8 rolls for Shawn's mom's wedding, and she paid me a little bit too.  I was surprised when she gave me money.  I definitely didn't expect it.  So this was the first time that I charged them.  I pick up the pictures on Tuesday morning.  I think I just might have to get upi early to put that check in the bank.  I'm sure I won't get any more wedding any time soon, but I'm happy I did even one.  It would be awesome if I could do this more often, but it would interfere with my first job.  Oh well.    If I get permission from the bride and groom I'll try to post some pics up here.
I was reading Shawn's journal today, and I realized I have no idea what is going on right now in the outside world.  I honestly don't really care as long as nothing is headed my way.  I'm really not afraid of dying, but I don't welcome it right now either.  I figure everything happens when it supposed to, or it will trigger events to happen later.  Ok I've just now decided to stop thinking and go to bed and yes it was a sudden decision to do that. Bye."

We had a lot of fun, and for once in my life I wasn't a pain to be around.  That means I wasn't slapping people and yelling a lot.  Shawn and I had some good times by ourselves out on the dock.
Sunday was mother's day, and wowo was I ever busy going to see all of my mommies.  We went to see Shawn's mom first and ate lots of chicken.  Then I went to see my dad and connie.  I then visited my own mom at her store.  It can be difficult having so many moms, but then at Christmas it's kinda nice.  You get more presents:)
I had off today, so of course I ran around all day paying bills.  At least I'm up to date now.  Tonight we're going to get Shawn's new to him 2001 Acura Integra.  Fun for all to be had.

Yes that means you can get drunk for less than ten bucks. It's great.  I went out last night with one of the girls I work with and got drunk on 7 dollars.  We came back home to the guys playing Madden and Shawn beating Devin's ass.  We decided to take a chance and have Jen  try a Chimay after she was already drunk.  For those of you who don't know, please take my advice and never give ANYONE Chimay if they are already drunk.  They will puke.  She did puke.  It will not take very long either.

I have good weekends sometimes though which is good, but I only get one day off in that weekend.  
I can actually say that I haven't drank myself into black-out phase for a month which is good, and I am staying away from Chimay.  If you don't know that story, don't ask don't tell is a good policy.
I bought a baby iguana.  We named it BJ short for Bud Jr.  Oh how I miss the days where my iguana was as long as my couch, and he ate cat food secretly.
I live in Shippensburg now with Shawn and 2 other guys which can be very difficult.  I'm like a little sister to them, and it's annoying how much they pick on me.

Well guess what folks?  Do you think I got to have a dentist's appointment today?  Of course not.  All that time took my entire appointment, and they couldn't squeeze me in, so now I have to reschedule.  Guess who's not in the greatest mood today especially since she has a pain in her tooth.  Couldn't be me do you suppose?  
Sorry to bitch and rant and rave.  I'm done now."

"event","Over the weekend I went out on Friday and Saturday with Complete Circle, yes they really are still together, and by the way doing just fine.  I got pretty drunk on Saturday night at Casie's in Greencastle.  I saw a lot of people I didn't expect to see and wasn't sure I really wanted to see them.  I went to the bathroom a lot, and happened to see the same people every time, so we collaborated on the bathroom of the future.  In the bathroom of the future, there will be many stalls.  Many stalls meaning, don't have just two, maybe four to six is a better bet.  There will be a bar for while you're waiting that you can order at and get the drink when you come out.  There will also be a mini spa.  The toilet seats will always be warm, and the bathroom will always have a constant temperature.  These bathrooms will always be close to the dance floor and/or stage for easier access for those who just want to dance constantly.  Ladies you know how it is when you get drunk and have to pee and just don't want to leave.  I think that was all the ideas we had.  If anyone has any other ideas, feel free to comment.

Except I just started a load of laundry because my jeans are nasty, and that's my only pair of jeans.  Well I could go out in a pair of my work pants, couldn't I?  Well there's the other dilemma.  There is road construction right outside of my house, and do you think they told us they were doing it?  No and it doesn't look like they're letting anyone in or out of this parking lot.  I thought I heard a neighbor say something about it being bullshit, but I'm not sure.  It's just annoying to go out there right now.  They told me yesterday I wouldn't be able to park in this parking lot.  I told them the hell I'm not,  I'll get towed if I park in someone else's space.

Christmas wasn't so great.  My mom ditched me in favor of the same thing she always does, a man.  Shawn's grandfather was in the hospital, so we had to go see him, and that was rough on Shawn.  The rest of the day was decent.  I ate too much but it was great.
Shawn's birthday falls on New Year's which is always fun, watch him get drunk and talk a whole hell of a lot.   
New Year's Day is Shawn and I's anniversary.  Five years now.  It doesn't feel like it.  We went to The Inn of the Dove in Harrisburg.  Awesome and very relaxing.  For $200 a night, it better be.

"event","Thank God there are only 2 more days til my season is over.  Friday we do our final film cut before Christmas.  I am so glad my first holiday season is over at the portrait studio.  It was bad, but not as bad as I thought it would turn out to be.  I did figure something out though.  People do not need drugs to kill their brain cells.  They just need Christmas to roll around every year, and they lose half of the ones they have if they haven't already fried them.  I also noticed Christmas really brings out the people you wish would just stay at home, you know the ones.  I won't go into detail.  It's just too hard to bear.  We are actually up this week, so it looks like I will be taking my entire staff to Ryan's for dinner.  Yep there's $100 down the drain.  Just kidding.  They earned it.  It was crazy, but it made me figure out what not to do next year and what to do better.  
In the past 4 days I have put in 37 hours, and I still have 3 days to go.  Fun times.  I can't wait for the week after next when I get to have 4 days off.  
I hope it snows soon.  I'm really looking foward to looking out the window and watching it fall and blanket the ground. 
Shawn and the guys have a show at the Speakeasy Cafe near Philly on Friday.  I wish I could go, but unfortunately I have to work.  I hope they do awesome, and they are able to get more shows.  I keep reading Eddie Manfre's web journal, and I get jealous a little, but I'm really happy for him.  I just hope it happens for the guys too, well that they will get signed and Shawn will have his dream come true.
I really want to support them, I guess it's just difficult for me knowing that if they do I might be by myself for a while while they go on tour.  Nobody but me and the cats at home and who knows where we'll be living then.  I feel like me saying that is making me selfish, but it's true.  Those guys are some of the closest friends I have, well some of them.  Just kidding.  Can't stand Shawn, dated too many of them, and Travis what can you say that's really nice? :)  I just don't make friends very easily, and I'm always there for everything.  I don't want to miss anything, but I guess I'll have to.  I will not stand in the way of their dreams, and I will do whatever I can in my power to help them along the way.

We have appointments every 15 minutes, and if we don't stay on schedule, we get up to an hour and a half behind.  And wow do we ever have crazy angry people.  Definitely not shiny happy people.
Well one of my associates quit, and Mike won't be working much due to his new arrival.  I haven't heard if Rose has had it yet, but I know she went into labor this morning.  
I guess I'm really at that age when everyone is having babies.  It's weird.  I never thought I would be hearing about all these people around me getting pregnant and be thinking about it myself so much.  I won't though not yet anyways.  Another year and some odd months and we'll see.  I don't know though.  Does anyone out there think Shawn and I would look odd with kids of our own?  Hey mom, dad just told me to annoy you for a while.  Yep and they will definitely be screamers.  I can just see it now.  We're never going shopping again.  I might have to pay someone to do the grocery shopping.  Thank god there will be a lot of grandparents to watch them when I need a break.  Just kidding kids if you ever look back on mom's diary or something.  
So well there are still reruns of Buffy and Angel on TV.  Watching them makes me very sad.  Too many reality shows on TV today, not enough out there type shows.  Smallville is looking really good.  I watched the 2 hour episode tonight.
Not much else to discuss, so I'll leave you with thKaylee, what the hell's going on in the engine room? From Firefly the series:
Were there monkeys? Some terrifying space monkeys maybe got loose? 
Ahh yes  Serenity  comes out April 2005.  Support the Joss Whedon Mutant Enemy universe.  Go see this movie.  If it is as good as the show, it will do very well, or else I will end up going to see it a million times myself.

"event","I don't know why, but lately I have been obsessed with Dawn of the Dead.  I bought the new one and the old one on DVD.  It's amazing to see what changes have come about in the past 2o or so years.  The blood and gore in the first one was just so completely fake, but yet in it's own way still disgusting.  Now however with modern technology and the skillful hands of artists (geez am I writing an article or what)  the gore is 2o times as bad.  I don't know why, but there was something about this movie that just mesmorized me.  There were no zombies in the 2nd movie that looked alike.  There were 3 different stages of zombies too.  Yes I did watch the extras, and yes I did find these things out by watching the extras.  Does this really make me weird?  I couldn't get over how real the zombies looked.  I did find out from something other than from the DVD that part of the reason the zombies looked so real is the people making the makeup used real autopsy photos to create some of the looks.  To me this was a good remake.  They changed it up a little bit which was cool.  Another zombie movie that was good was 28 Days Later.  
This past weekend I had off.  I wish I hadn't taken 2days off in a row because now I feel like this week will be very long.  Saturday night I went out and saw Complete Circle play their last show at the annoying Ye Ole Ale House.  Our waitress was a bitch, and she got no tip from me.  She had the nerve to card some of us, but not others after we had already been there for like 2 hours.  The people who weren't drinking were who she carded.  I understand that they have to do that, but why do you card after you've already been there a while?  I drank 3 pitchers of Yuengling.  I was trying for 4, but couldn't afford it.  I spent Sunday watching football and Survivor Series by myself.  I t wasn't so bad.  I got to watch Randy Orton beat Triple H.  That was cool.  
Back to work today.  It wasn't so bad.  I really do enjoy my job, but I'm worried because we are really down in sittings.  I don't understand why.  Oh well.   That's my weekend and it was ok, yet somehow boring too.  Whatever.

Well that stupid time of the year is on us again.  Actually even though I put the above it's not about voting time that I am talking about.  I am actually talking about being sick.  That really sucks especially in my line of work.  It's difficult to work with children and not be able to get close to them.  I think I probally got sick from them anyways.  My DM said I am supposed to try to get a full weekend off, but I like how my days are right now, but I guess it would be a good thing right now to take a weekend off.
Since I did the above I guess I can go without a quote... no I really can't.  It's just not me. So here it is.   Oh before that let me tell you how bad the new Texas Chainsaw Massacre movie was.  I got bored.  Seriously how many times could Jessica Beal get wet in that movie?  That's the best part for men though.  Not a scary movie and not goory enough.  Ok here's my quote:

Last night some of my other new associates changed the film in the camera because it was filmcut day.  They must have had a problem putting the lid on the magazine that holds the film because the lid was not attached and we had to reschedule all of our appointments today.  The lid wouldn't go shut because a part of it was bent.  I don't know how they managed to do that because it's pretty thick metal.  I'm glad I was there because I don't know what the new associate would have done.  She's not very confident.  I know she can do this job.  She knows how to do the photography.  I hope she starts picking it up a little better.  So tech support said they will send us a new magazine asap.  Hopefully it comes by tomorrow morning.
Shawn and I went grocery shopping.  We saved like 20 bucks.  That's sweet.  We got all kinds of frozen food.  Is that bad?  We came home and made spaghetti.  It was delicioso.  Everyone out there don't go with ragu or preggo.  Go with Classico Triple Mushroom, the best stuff ever.  You have to put your own mushrooms in too.  It's better that way.  Ooh and put a little onion and a little garlic powder too.  Shawn may be upset that I let out his secrets.  He sometimes puts a little jack daniels or southern comfort in the burger that he puts in the sauce too which is really good.  Try it and you will love my boyfriend as much as I do.  Well maybe not, but you'll want him to cook for you too.
So has anybody actually gotten completely through one of the presidential debates without falling asleep or changing the channel yet?  I haven't.  Now I'm not as sure about who I want to vote for.  I'm leaning towards Devin Kessler, so if you're not sure out there who to vote for just write in Devin Kessler.  He'll appreciate you.  That's his slogan.  Well actually I just made it up.  If you don't know him, he answers to the name Shrek.  He's not green though.  That kinda stinks.  oh well.  Now I m writing too much stupid shit so I'll just end with my normal quote.

I'm getting bored just doing Buffy quotes, so here's a quote from another favorite of mine, The Goonies.
[The Fratellis are interrogating Chunk] 
Francis Fratelli : Tell us everything! Everything! 
Chunk : Everything. OK! I'll talk! In third grade, I cheated on my history exam. In fourth grade, I stole my uncle Max's toupee and I glued it on my face when I was Moses in my Hebrew School play. In fifth grade, I knocked my sister Edie down the stairs and I blamed it on the dog... When my mom sent me to the summer camp for fat kids and then they served lunch I got nuts and I pigged out and they kicked me out... But the worst thing I ever done - I mixed a pot of fake puke at home and then I went to this movie theater, hid the puke in my jacket, climbed up to the balcony and then, t-t-then, I made a noise like this: hua-hua-hua-huaaaaaaa - and then I dumped it over the side, all over the people in the audience. And then, this was horrible, all the people started getting sick and throwing up all over each other. I never felt so bad in my entire life.

I would have so much fun.  I wish I could take pictures of animals though, especially with their owners.  I could come up with some great pictures.
Shawn wants us to move in with the band.  It doesn't seem like a bad idea.  It has its minuses and its plusses.  I think we should buy the house and have the others living there paying rent that way when they want to move out they can at any time and Shawn and I would have a place of own.  I out of all the girls would mind the less living with guys.  I'd hope though that they would be fine with us having the largest room, because I am a girl.  I need lots of space for clothes.  And shoes and books and statues and figures, ok yeah I'm a former retail girl and comic book nerd.  I also could deal with them practicing all the time, I think.  Ok maybe this isn't such a good idea.  No I think it might work.  Ok very indecisive.  Check back with me in a week, I might feel differently.

"event","I got off work at 4.  Shawn was actually awake today.  We decided to go out to eat.  We haven't been to Perkins in a while, and now I understand why.  Mostly older people go there, and the waitresses are slightly on the dumb side, well not slightly but mostly.  Our waitress took about 10-15 minutes actually coming out and acknowledging us.  Now take into account there were 2 other waitresses on and only about 6 other groups of people all on the other side of the restaurant so they weren't hers.  We ordered our drinks and food at the same time since we had already been there long enough.  It took another 10-20 minutes for us to get our drinks and mind you we were thirsty.  By the time she came out with our appetizer she pretty much brought the other food out at the same time, gives no meaning to appetizer just call it a side meal.  While we were eating she didn't ask if we needed anything else or check on our drinks.  She did come back at the end and ask will that be all?  What are we pigs?  After we're done is when she then asks if we need refills.  By then her tip has dwindled down to only a dollar.  She asks if I need a box, and I tell her yes please, see I was nice.  It takes another 10-15 minutes for her to come back with that.  Geez, where were the boxes, hidden behind the cooks asses I think.  She must have had an infatuation in the back because that's where she seemed to be a lot.  Shawn made me give her at least 2 dollars, but I felt she didn't deserve that.  I know they don't get paid much, and they mainly get money off of tips, but I think they should work for it just as everyone works hard for their money.  In other words I give our experience there a 4 of 10 for her, but a 8 for the food.
I'm getting worried at work that I won't have these girls trained to be able to put them on their own after next week. They need to get more confident.  Yeah I get paid tomorrow, how exciting is that?

Buffy : We have a marching jazz band? 
Oz : Yeah, but, you know, since the best jazz is improvisational, we'd be going off in all directions, banging into floats... scary."

"event","How stupid has that show gotten really?  They live in a bank.  Who other than rich bitchy people live in a bank?  How often do you see a bitchy beautiful blonde, the naive girl, another girl who is different, a gay guy, and one or two good looking southern boys, and a guy you never see living together?  Could they get anymore obvious with who they are going to put on the show?  Oh yeah they could, and they have.  Then there's the fact that I'm actually watching to see how stupid these people can actually get and how bad the acting is.  Seriously why do I watch?  Somebody give a list of other things that are on between 8 and 11 that are better than this and I will watch.  I promise.
I am enjoying my job.  It's fun to play with children and be able to give them back.  I love taking pictures.  It's fun.  Training people is going slowly, but as time goes on I think I will get better at it.  I'm worries about my sales though.  They are really bad.  I have to focus on getting these employees trained before anything else.
So uhh yeah, October 3oth Scotland Community Center, The Spectral Facade and 4 other bands.  7 pm
Be There.
[Spike can't bite Willow] 
Spike : I don't understand. This sort of thing has never happened to me before. 
Willow : Maybe you were nervous. 
Spike : I felt all right when it started. Well let's try it again. 
[Spike tries to bite Willow and he backs off screaming in pain] 
Spike : Damn it. What's wrong with me? 
Willow : Maybe you're trying too hard. Doesn't this happen to every vampire? 
Spike : Not to me it doesn't. 
Willow : It's me isn't it? 
Spike : What are you talking about? 
Willow : Well you came here looking for Buffy, and settled. You didn't want to bite me, I just happened to be around. 
Spike : Piffle. 
Willow : I know I'm not the kind of girl vamps like to sink their teeth into. It's all ways, ""ooo, you're like a sister to me,"" or ""oh, we're such good friends."" 
Spike : Don't be ridiculous. I'd bite you in a heartbeat. 
Willow : This doesn't make you anymore scary. 
Spike : Don't patronize me. I'm only 126 years old. 
Willow : Your being too hard on yourself. Why we don't wait a half an hour and try again?"

"event","I feel I not only have a job at work but at home too.  I want to light a fire under Shawn, Nate, and Trav's asses.  They have finished school now, but aren't quite doing much with it yet.  Shawn is doing sound for Complete Circle, but noone else is really doing much.  Well, they are trying to get together a demo for the band done.  Oh by the way, they have a gig on October 3oth if anyone is interested.  Shawn has a goal plan posted on his journal, and I plan on pushing him, even if it means he'll get pissed at me continuously.  
If anybody has any ideas on how to not enjoy food so much that doesn't cost anything, please let me know.  I think I have a real problem with food.  I love it too much.  Is that really a problem?
Professor Maggie Walsh: So, the Slayer. 
Buffy : Yeah, that's me. 
Professor Maggie Walsh : We thought you were a myth. 
Buffy : Well, you were myth-taken. 
I'm still watching Angel.  It's a good season.  I miss the Joss Whedon series on TV.  Oh well just have to wait for Serenity next year.  And it looks like he may be directing the new X-men.  Very exciting.  
To finish, I would like to say come to Spectral Facade's gig with 4 other bands on October 3oth at the Scotland Community Center.  $5 for a ticket or 6 at the door."

"event","You know, I forgot how good nerds were.  I got a bunch of little boxes from the arcade, and now I think I'm addicted once more.  
I got the new Angel DVD, and I must say it is pretty good so far, well except for a few parts that just aren't necessary.  Like Lilah and Wesley.  Yuck.  It's almost like a soap opera.  And so my quote will come from there.
"" I really hate today.""- Lorne
"" I'm worried about tomorrow myself."" Gunn
So I started 2 new employees.  One a girl who is the daughter of a lady I used to work with.  I was worried about her, but she's learning quickly.  The other is my real estate agent who wants a part time job too.  Hopefully he can do something with our sales.  He is a good salesperson, and he is also learning quick.  So yeah for me and them.  Today was busy at the studio, and it must have been the weather because noone seemed to be in a good mood.  I definitely needed a shower when I came home.  Hey it's getting me ready for Xmas though."

"event","With a name like Ivan it's got to be an interesting storm.  I don't know why I seem to enjoy watching the weather channel when hurricanes happen.  I guess to me it's fun to see destruction.  This has been a crazy and sucky hurricane season.  It sucks to live in Florida right now.  So California is going to become an island, and Florida is going to be under water.  oooohh yeah and Texas is going to fry.  New England will be a glacier.  If anybody can think of anymore let me know.  This is kinda fun.  My thought on these places, you know there is a chance for these things to happen there, so don't live there.  You're chancing things.  But then again there's a chance for something to happen everywhere so my philosophy really doesn't work.  Damn.  I thought I was really coming up with something.  
And now...
""Willow doesn't live here anymore."""

"event","So lately I have been coming up with some funny things to say.  What Amanda funny?  I know I know, I thought the same thing myself.  My football away message seemed to be funny to some while still others enjoyed my cat likes to lick walls story.  Well you know what I am thinking it has to do with the fact that my job has me getting paid to make a big fool out of myself to get good smiles for portraits.  Don't say pictures.  It's not professional ok?  Seriously, I may have to deal with little kids all day, but who else can really say you get paid to goof off?  Huh Huh!  Yep that's right none unless you work for cheap ass Walmart or Picture People which I can't say much for since I haven't seen how they are.
I saw my mommy and lil(well not so lil anymore more like 5'8"") brother for the first time in a while.  I talked her into making me tuna noodle casserole.  Bribery actually.  I gave her 15 dollars.  My mom makes the best tuna noodle casserole.  I'm willing to bet my life on it, well maybe not.

Ahh now for a sing along with Buffy:
""Every single night the same arrangement I go out and fight the fight. Still I always feel this strange estrangement nothing here is real, nothing here is right. I've been making shows of trading blows just hoping no one knows that I've been going through the motions, walking through the part. Nothing seems to penetrate my heart."""

"event","Why are gay boys so immature and annoying?

Society never let us grow up. That is why we are immature.

In high school we were either unaware of our true natures or we had to hide them. Even if you were out in high school, you probably had nobody to be out with. There probably wasn't a real context for interaction. Maybe you knew a few others like you, but probably couldn't date openly, congregate, or celebrate your diversity.

Sure, you had friends - well, maybe you did and maybe they found out about you and they liked you anyway. They supported you and that was nice but there was no way they could have known what you were going through or what you needed. Of course we need to appreciate the support of our straight allies, especially if we were lucky enough to have any when we were 16, but we also must realize they can't interact on even the same platonic level other queer kids could have.
Straights were allowed to mature and develop healthy relationships. Their sexuality was the norm and it was allowed and encouraged. There were football games, dances, prom and double dating. Suzy wore Johnny's ring and everyone knew they were going steady. The hallways buzzed about it for days. This was the norm. This was considered healthy and you sat in the back of the classroom looking out the window and wondered where you belonged.

Sure, Suzy and Johnny didn't last long, but at least they had that experience. They were allowed to go through all the normal stages of development. Looking back on it now, it is annoying and embarrassing, but puppy love, crushes, hand holding and necking in the car are all a part of growing up and they took that from us.

We were denied a natural maturing process because we were gay.

So, high school is over and if you are like me, you're thinking, ""Thank God!"" You are now here on campus and finally you have the environment you always needed - about 6 years too late.

So here we go again. Being gay is just like being straight.

Now we have hand holding, crushes, make-out sessions, puppy love, gossiping, backstabbing and 20-year-old gay men acting like 14-year-old girls. ""Oh my God, he is looking at me."" ""I hate his boyfriend."" ""Does this make me look fat?"" ""Are they dating? That is so gross!""

We are college students so we are not complete morons. Our SAT's were good enough. We spend hours at the library reading journals and periodicals. We take classes on serious subjects such as psychology, organic chemistry, and political science, but when it comes to friendship, relationships, sex, and emotions, we are still back in middle school. Worse yet, it is killing us.

As long as the greater part of society refuses to acknowledge queer youth, as long as we are denied the right any other 16-year-old is given to express our emotions in a valid, healthy fashion, we will always have a late start in life. We will continue to have high suicide rates. We will continue to have issues with drug and alcohol abuse. We will be more likely to enter emotionally unhealthy relationships, romantic or not. We will be uneducated and crawling in the dark. We won't know how to read the signs. We will be more likely to engage in unsafe sex. There will be a higher risk of abuse and we will be more likely to make the wrong decisions to impress others and to prove something to ourselves. We will be less likely to respect others and ourselves. We will continue to hurt one another. We will continue to be grown men with small hearts and small minds.

I urge my gay brothers to look back on your development and honestly spot the areas where you were denied the ability to find your true self. Those days are over and we can't have them back but self-realization is the first step to claiming our maturity and integrity."

Dupaul Univ.
Roosevelt Univ.     Both in chicago

Cleveland State
Univ. of Wisconsin in Madison
Univ. of Texas in Austin.


So... fellas....   one of these cities is going to be my new home and if you live there and like what you see.... I want to meet you!!

I have no expectations and I'm open to anything.    Hit me up!!

College was suppposed to have been this exhilerating reawakening. I was supposed to have fallen in love and got my heart broken. I was supposed to find new meaning in my life. I was supposed to begin to understand what it was like to be sexually desired. I was supposed to have been stalked.

I was suppose to spend endless nights doing absolutly nothing with people whom I had nothing in common with. I was supposed to be promiscuous. I was supposed to be young and vibrant and carefree.

God dammit...   why didn't I have any fun here?!?!   I'm 23 and I've had 3 dates in 5 years. What am I doing wrong?"

So i'm off to grad school and I am picking them very carefully. First and foremost of course I want to go to a school that has cool profs that can mentor me and continue to help my compositional technique grow. Of course that is what life is all about but in additon to that I recognize how bad Muncie, IN has been and I am also considering new criteria. 

My grad school must be in a city. This city needs to have lots of culture. It needs to have an thriving and diverse GLBT community. There needs to be hot gay men there that are my age and of course they must want to date me. MUAH!!!!

I'm applying everywhere. The 2 biggies are:
Cincinnati conservatory of music
Univ. of Texas in Austin

These are by far the hardest schools on my list to get into. I recently made a trip over to cinci to meet the profs and see the campus and while I loved all that I saw... I fucking hate the city. Am I right??   Does Cinci suck? Coult I get a date in Cinci??!!

I'm also considering three in chicago.
Chicago conservatory
DePaul
Roosevelt

I must admit, I think Chicago has my heart. Surely there is a context in Chicago where I could make my niche.

In addition there is also OSU in Columbus, and a couple in pittsburg.

Does anyone know anything about the scene in these cities?  

Let me know kittens.

btw...  I always have stuff on my profile..

"event","I'm sick of cute. 

I really hate it when someone defends another person's existence in the universe on the account that they are cute.

Like I can be somewhere and somebody can do something totally stupid or be acting completly annoying and I or someone else will express our annoyance of them only to be negated by some other idiot's comment that it's ok that they are annoying or stupid.. cause they are cute.

Is cute all that important?
How important is cute?

Does cuteness (as ambigious of a term that is) outway any other personality traits that might be held in high regard in most platonic or romantic relationships?

Ever notice how it is the male perspective that perpetuates the importance of the cute factor?

Makes no difference str8 or gay, males seem to be more forgiving of idiotcy when concealed behind cuteness. In the heterosexual world this can be seen in the adoration and over rating of the typical cheerleader stereotype/blond bimbo. Did it ever occur to str8 men that women may be playing up these stereotypes or perhaps buying into them as a means of satisfying their male audience?

This is no real different then gay men who elitisize twink subculture. Xander's childlike idiotcy is forgivable cause he is just so damn cute. It just seems that the popular opinion is that it doesn't matter how shallow, illiterate, or dim a 'boi' is as long as he is cute, thin, and wears the right clothes.... and besides chances are he is in or wishes he was in 'University Screamers' which just furter proves my point that cute makes dumb marketable.

I personally find myself reaching a point where I am no longer annoyed by dumb cute people but placing blame on those who perpetuate and allow the dumb cute people to be dumb."

Perhaps I was missing out on something.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>I wasn't.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>But I quickly found some alternative use for them...<br /><br /><strong>AND NO, I DID NOT JACK OFF TO THE PICTURES OF THE GUYS ON THE CARDS...&nbsp;&nbsp; JESUS!!!</strong><br /><br />Since I had the cards out and came to the conclusion what a shitty gift it was, I started to put them back in when I decided I might as well organize them by team.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br /></font><strong><span style=""FONT-SIZE: 18pt"">OMG HOW MUCH FUN!!!</span></strong></font><font size=""3""><font face=""Times New Roman"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Something enticing and ultimately emotionally fulfilling welled up inside of me as I spent countless hours organizing and reorganizing those baseball cards, sometimes by team, or year, by position, etc...&nbsp;&nbsp; There was something peaceful and serene about it. Like I was doing something good. Like I was making the world a better place by keeping these shitty cards in a well organized, neat, and properly placed order.&nbsp;<br /><br />Well somewhere along the line I lost the cards or something. I moved a couple of times since then so maybe that was it.<br /><br />So now i have a new hobby. I organize porn. I download it.. and organize it into various folders with sub-headings. I put all the twinks into one folder... all the rimming into another...&nbsp; solo jack off...&nbsp;&nbsp; cum shots...&nbsp; bears...&nbsp;&nbsp; group sex.. etc...&nbsp;&nbsp; videos and pictures.&nbsp;<br /><br />I myself do not like porn. I rarely masturbate and the flickering images of perfect&nbsp; bodies don't do much for me. I'm too much of a cuddler I think. The porn is pretty but it can't hold me. The reason I have chosen porn as a medium to exhaust my need to organize is because it helps others as well. I'm killing two birds with one stone I guess.&nbsp;&nbsp; I get to organize and give myself peace... and all my friends get hours of meat beating entertainment.<br /><br />Most of my friends get regular updated editions of new goods to wack their bishop too. It's a win win situation I guess. Very mutual to say the least. Thank god for porn... it brings peace to so many people's restless minds.<o:p></o:p></font></font></p>"

"event","I was up all last night finishing a band arranging project. As a comp major I have to take commercial, band, choral, and orchestral arranging. The commercial class I took last semester was a complete waist of time...  I learned nothing... and why would I want to write commerical music anyway? Yes... that's right.. I'm a snob like that.

The band project wasn't hard... just tedious. So right now I'm sitting in my room... eating ramen and drinking rum and coke trying to baby myself. I'm also watching THE ENGLISH PATIENT and reliving some much needed passion I had briefly a few weeks ago.

A couple of weekends ago I ended an 8 month dry spell of no sex. Not by choice, mind you.  Ya know, after going 8 months without sex it wasn't the sex itself I missed. It was the kissing. I could go another 8 years and not have sex but if I can help it, I don't want to go a whole month without kissing."

"event","so at the beginning of every month I'm going to post on how the weight lost thing is going for me.... at least try to anyway.

Just now I weighed my self at 280 lbs. Remember I am 5'6"". I started this whole thing back in January where I weighed 329 lbs... and in May I weighed 300 even. So.....   I have lost a total of 50 lb so far.

I still where size 40 or 42"" waist pants. I don't seem to be loosing it around my stomach but more around my face and and upper torso.

My diet is sparatic and is not as good as it was during the school year. It is harder where I have to depend on my wallet and buy what I can afford and not to mention cook myself. All the foods I know how to make for myself are cheap of course cause I grew up poor but they are my mother's food and not good for me. That is probably what made me fat to begin with. However I can stretch a box of macaronni till it shits and don't even ask what I can do with a pound of hamburger, crackers, and a dozen eggs.

When I get my meal card back in the fall and I have the variety and accesibility of the dining hall I will be able to make smarter choices and urge the dietetic part of my weigh loss a little bit more. RIght now I live off stir fry, lean cuisines (which have way to much fucking sodium in them) and the occasional fling.... chinesse take out etc.. which is totally not good for me and I know it.

Well that covers food.. now to excersise.
I figure genetics can either work for me or against me. I will always be big.. so will I be fat or muscular? I combine weight lifting with cardio. I tread mill almost everyday, speed walking which gets my heart rate up to it's target range for about half an hour. I also go to the gym every week day. MWF I do upper body... Tues and Thur I do lower body. Takes me over an hour each time. I work each muscle group with about 4 sets or more and I sweat my ass of... it's so disgusting but feels so good!

My main consern now... is how am I going to be able to keep this excersise routine that I have adopted in the summer, in the fall as well. With a full course load, being in an opera, writting an opera, writting something else in private comp lessons with Mr. Foley, and god knows what else might fall down the tube, without going crazy!

So we will see, but I'm having fun. It's not hard. I always thought it needs to hurt and be hard but it doesn't have to be.

My 1 year aniversary of weight loss is January 20th, is it possible that I could lose another 30 lbs by then. It is early August, ya know. See, if I was to lose another 30 lbs.. then that would make a grand total of 80 lbs in one year which is pretty fucking amazing.   Am I asking too much?"

"event","Yeah it's been like forever,

They only thing of great importance I can say about last semester is that I lost 30 lbs. I did this by just eating more veggies and cutting back on sugar stuff. Not atkins or south beach or any other trendy diets like that. I have consider this  a life style change and I am planning on losing more.

Currently I am living in Stu-west as a Conference Assistant on 2nd whitcraft. It's an ok job, I'm kinda like a summer RA and I get 10 hours a week of pay and a free sing with AC. I'm also taking Music History 331, Anthropology 101, and fitness walking. In addition I am writting another children's opera with Dr. Maltas, out last had 13 performances and this next one will probably have as many. 

So basically I have been just working, excersicing, eating stir fry, and studying. I think that I'm going to use this journal to document my weightless.  So boring right?... too bad


I can't be interesting all the time.

"event","This is a letter that I wrote to a friend. It's just the start of it... the rest if kinda private...  

Dear Micah,

Hi, sweetheart. How are you? It seems we can never find time to meet and seriously talk and hang out... Well... at least not as much as I would like too.

I hope you are doing well and that everything is going according to plan, which I'm sure it is.

I remember very clearly what must have been 8 years ago around this time of year actually, when a thin handsome boy confessed something very dear to him in a H.S. Library. I'm sure you remember it quite well yourself. Do you remember the letter I gave you following the library conversation? I barely remember it myself but I wrote you a letter. Of course in my horrible penmanship, I wouldn't be surprised if you were unable to read it.

I remember in the letter telling you that everything in your life at that time was temporary. That H.S. and Berne, and all that held you back would soon melt away. That Patrick, and Tyler, and all such unpleasantness would pass away. I also remember making a prediction. Something I am very happy to boast about. I remember telling you that one day you were going to leave all of us behind and move to a city, a thriving metropolis with new kinds of people, new opportunities, and over all a new beginning where the past could not catch you. And in this new place you were going to make a great way for yourself. That you would live comfortably in your newfound surroundings and more importantly share your life with a special someone.    And you did! I knew, even then that you were very capable of such things.

It seems out of all my friends; you are the main one that I need have no worry for. The cream always rises to the top, cats always land on all four feet, and Michael Scott Lunn will always come out ahead.

Of course I am not writing you to just kiss your ass!  I have a wee problem and I need your advice.


Rest is confidential"

So tomarrow we have a leadership meeting for the pigs..  (the three little pigs~ a 1 act children's opera I co-wrote with Dr. Carla Maltas) I guess we are going to be planning various things to try and make this production kick ass. It's all cast and everything and next week starts rehersals. So far there are 13 scheduled performances. HOLY SHIT!!!!"

"event","gothiccomposer: but this constant searching through profiles... would make me feel pathetic.. unnatractive... and a complete loser.
gothiccomposer: you dn't feel this way..
gothiccomposer: after viewing an endless series of mugshots that all same the same thing...
gothiccomposer: Like while doing it.. I would feel like such a troll...   I would feel dirty while doing it.
gothiccomposer: I guess it goes againts my principles..  I may be weird and unnattractive to the majority of the gay population. but that is just their opinion and because of it they are missing out which is really sad cause most of them are a dime a dozen where there maybe 2 or 3 other people in this world that are anything like me. There a lots of people out there that are just like (think of several slutty fags we all know). But when it comes to consistant emotional support, integrity, strong character, and intelligent. I and the 2 other people like me will always take the cake. Because of this I will not paine, beg, search, stalk, or initiate anything with some random mugshot with an ASL and penis size.
gothiccomposer: honestly I find it degrating and beneath me.
John Doe: Well, while it may be painstaking, and while there's a lot of rubbish you have to search for, I think there's at least a chance the needle in the haystack can be found.  Afterall, you have personal ads on some sites.  Somebody could potentially find you on such a site and it could be a good match.  
John Doe: If everybody threw up a personal ad and nobody read them, they wouldn't do a damn bit of good.
gothiccomposer: well then they come to me.. I dont go after them.
gothiccomposer: I admit that I have met several people online..   and I enjoyed them.. but they always come to me first.
gothiccomposer: none of them I would date now cause all they did want was sex or a desperate need to have a BF to make themselves feel better. In those cases I defined the title.. the title did not defind me.
gothiccomposer: it's only good when you are dumb and pretty.. when a mugshot can capture the very essense of your worth..  
John Doe: There ya go.  I figure if I'm out there looking through these things, then statistically there's probably many other worth-while guys out there doing the same thing.
gothiccomposer: it's half way usefull for you because while your pretty your not stupid... so it's a hit and miss but when you like me.. smart and ugly.. it does not a damn thing.
gothiccomposer: John Doe, I can honestly say.. that the one huge misunderstanding about our friendship is that you don't understand that the rules that I have to play by are very much different than yours because your pretty and I'm not. Your experience as a gay man is very very different than mine.. It really is a whole other world. I don't want a pity party and I'm not down playing your personal struggle.. but you do have it much much easier than I.
gothiccomposer: even in our media.. I feel left out.. Be in gay movies like a beautiful thing  or magzines like XY or books as in ""like people in history"" or tv shows like will and grace or queer as folk. Even in out own stories.. I have no place. I cannot sympathize with any of these characters or feel a connection to any of there feelings cause they are all beautiful.. and they know it.. and the world knows it.. it's just an understood fact that they dont' struggle with but blindly accept. I can't imagine just living a single day.. where I was pretty and all the world knew it.
gothiccomposer: while I technically don't disagree with you usage of this media to meet knew people... you have to understand my general belief that there are better ways.. if not more holesum ways......  and I just wish you did things more personally productive than sit and flip through personal pages....       in my opinion."

and it was so depressing cause I had to cancel a date with Tim the bear, because I knew the rehersal was going to run late.

Tim the bear is this guy that I met back before Thanksgiving. He is a grad student here and he is real nice. Not sure yet how I feel about him. All I know is that he is a fun person to be around and he is a fucking excellent kisser...   OMG!!!!

gothiccomposer (9:24:30 PM): oh god... you should ask such things... ummm..... well.....
gothiccomposer (9:24:56 PM): Most of the time.. it was a mutal aggreement..  but when it wasn't.. I was the one that dumped him...
RegalPlatypus (9:26:31 PM): I figured as much.
gothiccomposer (9:27:48 PM): why do you say that?????
RegalPlatypus (9:28:21 PM): Well, you said you've never really asked anybody out or made the first moves.  It's always been the other way around.
RegalPlatypus (9:28:34 PM): So I kinnda figured the relationships would tend to end in a similar manner.
gothiccomposer (9:28:52 PM): ok
gothiccomposer (9:29:01 PM): yeah.. I never persue.. but I always end them.
gothiccomposer (9:30:18 PM): any reason on why you asked though?
RegalPlatypus (9:30:53 PM): Just wondered if you'd ever really had your heart broken.
gothiccomposer (9:31:28 PM): well I have never been in love.
RegalPlatypus (9:31:56 PM): Well, of course, and I don't mean to imply that I was.
gothiccomposer (9:31:57 PM): the hardest thing was probably leaving jason... in the last 6 years it was the closest I got to crying.
gothiccomposer (9:32:41 PM): at the time I felt like my heart was breaking...  and he was the closest I have gotten to love?
RegalPlatypus (9:33:24 PM): How long were you with him?
gothiccomposer (9:34:27 PM): well. I started talking to him online.. in June of 2003
gothiccomposer (9:35:14 PM): we talked all summer and fall and..  things got real serious that winter.. I met him in person in feb for my b day... last year....
gothiccomposer (9:35:22 PM): and then it ended over spring break in april..
gothiccomposer (9:35:25 PM): so 2 months
gothiccomposer (9:36:07 PM): he spent a week with me in feb.. a week in march.. and then I spent 2 weeks with him in april.
gothiccomposer (9:36:41 PM): it just sucked cause he was so perfect.. in ALMOST everyway.....
RegalPlatypus (9:37:04 PM): Why did you leave him?
gothiccomposer (9:37:28 PM): well...  to cover the good things.
gothiccomposer (9:39:56 PM): he was very attractive... he was very attracted to me.. I think he was more turned on by me than I was him...     he was very very intelligent.. probably as smart maybe smarter than me.. he was very sensative.. he listen to a wider range of music than I do..  he read constantly...  he had great taste for the finer things in life.. tobacco, foreign food, alcohol, etc...    he was very sensative and very caring.. always concerned with how I felt or what I thought...  he was quiet and shy but not afraid to state his opinions even when they were very very radical.
gothiccomposer (9:41:44 PM): he was very good in bed.. we use to make out for hours.. just get naked and roll around and touch and taste every fucking part of each others bodies... we would laugh and giggle the entire time..  I remember.. getting out of bed and taking a shower.. and going to class and even after 4 hours of being away from him.. i could still smell him and taste him in my mouth.
gothiccomposer (9:43:18 PM): but he suffered from mood swings and depression. He worried alot..  he would have fits of paranoia.. sometimes he would get aggrivated (not at me) in general about the smallest of things.. and he would even cry out of the blue for no reason.
gothiccomposer (9:47:27 PM): I was very protective of him.. and we never argued and I never got on his case about some of his issues... I was very patient with him... and I tried as damn hard as I could to endure his bad points cause the rest of him was so perfect. and I spent a lot of time thinking that I was selfish and inconsiderate for even thinking that I should leave him cause I'm just a fat kid in the middle of no where and he was more than I deserved and that I shouldn't be so fucking picky and be happy with what I got...  I tried as long as I could... but in the end I knew that I could not build a life with him.. and that for his own good he needed to be alone so he could consintrate on his problems so he could get well... 
gothiccomposer (9:48:32 PM): so before I got angry.. before I became abusive or started hating him for being so perfect and so fucked up at the same time... and because he needed to be alone and fix himself..  I ended it.                            It was probably the most painful thing I have ever done concerning another human being.
RegalPlatypus (9:48:32 PM): When was the last time you talked to him?
gothiccomposer (9:48:41 PM): couple of weeks ago...  
RegalPlatypus (9:48:58 PM): Has he gotten any better?
gothiccomposer (9:49:01 PM): he is more stable now..  but he will never be well enough to be in the kind of relationship I want.
gothiccomposer (9:49:30 PM): he has been in and out of stress centers and medicated since he was 15.
gothiccomposer (9:49:50 PM): his mother was so awesome.
gothiccomposer (9:50:32 PM): Deb was a nurse practitioner and midwife.. I remember she use to go to work at 8 am and be home by 2... a hard day of work after delivering 4 babies..  
gothiccomposer (9:51:22 PM): I use to be amazed by the fact that everyday she saw life spring from it's very origin.. that there are hundreds of people in this world that can say she was the very first person to see and touch them...   She was so smart.
gothiccomposer (9:52:52 PM): I still have feelings for him in a small way.. I still feel the need to protect him. If I was to hear that somebody has been cruel to him even today I would probably feel a deep flush of anger and wrath.
gothiccomposer (9:56:44 PM): so yeah..."

"event","The lab is always dead in the mornings. I guess all the freshman are busy in their butt fuck early theory classes (thank Isis those days are over) and all the upper classmen are home asleep. Perhaps between the study of the Magnus Liber Organi and the harmonic analysis of Vivaldi's four seasons, I might be able to take a second to babble a minute. hhhmmmmmmmmmmm...............  
<br />

A wise man recently said to me, ""Humans are at their best when they are in service to others. We are hardwired for it.""
<br />

Depression is something that millions of people battle with everyday. For someone who has never experienced long term depression it's very hard to explain convincingly what real depression is. Certainly there is understandable depression. The kind of emotions that are felt after the death of a loved one, or after a break up, or an unexplained tragic event. Of course through the course of human existence everyone is going to suffer though one or more of these situations and of course a sense of depression and lost is going to be felt. It's only human of course.
<br />

This kind of depression, although important is not what I'm talking about. This kind of depression has no reason. It is something that is felt without a cause. Nobody has died, your friends and loved ones are as supportive and nurturing as they possibly could be, your job is fine, your marriage is fine, and there hasn't been any recent tsunamis or suicide bombings in your area; but still things aren't right.
<br />

Suddenly everything gets hard. Getting work done is suddenly so hard. Things that use to be done everyday are now impossible tasks. Be it taking time to meet friends, getting to school or work on time, cleaning house, taking time to eat. Yet, while is seems you are always running late and out of time, really time is all you got. Cause all day you find yourself sitting and thinking about things that have not yet happened, worrying about bad things that have not yet happened. All of this eating away at you till every step and thought you make is a big production of worries... all of which is about you.
<br />

Thinking, worrying, hating, lamenting, battling, struggling with yourself. Everything is about you. How do I feel? What do I want? Why am I sad? Why can't I be happy? What am I supposed to do? I I I me me me......
<br />

So when you are at the end of your proverbial rope and your just about ready to tie it in a knot around your neck and jump off the nearest baby grand you can find... try understanding that even though your life may mean shit to yourself... it might mean something to someone else. Find your nearest friend and say to them, as long as I can serve you I might have something to live for. 
<br />

Be it just sitting and talking to them, doing their laundry, running their errands, or holding their hand taking care of someone, nurturing someone else, helping someone else with no desire for repayment is the best damn way to get your mind of your problems. You will be surprised how good you are at it. How natural feelings like compassion, sensitivity, and helpfulness just seem to be as natural as walking or sleeping. You will realize how somehow these good capabilities seem to be hardwired into your brain. That affection, tenderness, and genuine concern for others are natural and therapeutic tendencies that we all are quite capable of tapping into. Even if you are a self-serving son of a bitch Slytherin.
<br />

It's amazing how after opening yourself wide enough to push such unwarranted affection out of yourself, you begin to realize just how easy some things are. How easy life can be if you choose it to be. How happy you can be if you choose to happy and that you don't have to be the victim if you don't want to be. That there is nothing to be afraid of, that you suddenly again have all the time in the world, and more importantly how easy it is to forgive yourself for all the times you thought otherwise; even when you took it out on someone else.
<br />




Well that was more than I expected.
I'm going to be stuck here till 3pm. Then I have rehearsal for Merry Wives. This opera stuff has been great but I'm going to be so much happier after this weekend. Not to mention no more hetero making out in a fat suite. Double uncomfortable!!!!
<br />

Better get busy...  Ciao!!"

"event","I am a proud and decently happy Ball State employee. I work in a computer lab.  (hold the applause) it's wonderful I know but at least I get paid to sit on my ass and write this shit. Not to mention that since I am a composition major and I'm poor and do not own my own computer, I would probably still be in here composing and typing papers anyway. 

So today's merry event in the lab is that I have been requested to stay and help Dr. T (my lesbian beer drinking proffoser who has the humor of a salt stone and the profile of a michaelangelo fresco) teach her choral arranging class. I have been so honorable selected due to my profound knowledge and prowess sp? on the compositional program finale. Finale is a widely used program that most composers use. She has a dozen kids in here. I hope they don't drive me crazy. What's with lesbians and flannel anyway??

Oh goody Mr. O is in here. He's a tall bald intellectual guy that teaches my Concerto class. More on that later probably. He always makes things fun. Maybe its the profanity.

more later.. probably.. ciao"

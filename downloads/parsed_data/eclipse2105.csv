"event","School started yesterday.  It was a sad day for all.  I saw Becky, Kathryn, Sharesa and Katie again for the first time in almost three months.  It's so sad that summer is over.  Not that I did alot over the summer.  It's just the sad homework part.  
Yesterday, my first class was biology.  I have the class with Mary and Junius.  My teacher was talking about evolution.  He also said that he has a deaf cat.  You have to poke the cat in order to get his attention.  I haven't gotten any homework so far.  Its just nice to see everyone again.  Later all..."

"event","My summer has been pretty uneventful so far and it doesn't seem to be getting better.  I have done little day trips but nothing big.  On June 6th, I spent the entire day with my best friend, Crystal.  She moved and now I don't get to see her as much.  So she picked me up at my house and she took me out to see her apartment where  she lives with her aunt.  We went to see Shrek 2 (which was a very funny movie, everyone should go to see it).  Then we left and went to the batting cages and went on go-karts.  Then got Burger King for dinner and headed for my house.  We got on 294 and her car started over heating.  So, we got off in Hinsdale.  So we ate in the GM training center's parking lot as we waited for her car to cool off.  Then we took the side streets home.  On June 24th, I went to the White Sox game.  That was fun even though it rained the whole time and it was cold.  They won 7-2 though.  The following Tuesday, I went to the Windy City Thunderbolts game.  That was fun and they won 2-1 also.  Then on July 3rd, I went with a friend from work to the Tweeter Center to see Tim McGraw.  I had such a good time.  It was my first concert.  It was raining so hard that the rain came onto the stage.  Tim was running across the stage and he fell from on his back.  He was so cool about it though.  His wife, Faith Hill, came out and sang one song with him.  It was so cute.  On July 11th, I went to my cousin, Jacob's, birthday party.  He just turned 6.  It was so much fun.  I loved to see all the kids running around.  

And the rest of my days are spent slaving away in a hot dry cleaners for 40 hours a week.  FUN!! FUN!! FUN!!!"

"event","Three finals down and a million more to go!!  Yeah!!  Well, I'm sick of studying for finals.  I am taking a break and listening to Stephen Lynch.  He makes me laugh.  He is so hilarious.  If you want a good comedy CD, buy Stephen Lynch's Superhero.  A public service announcement from ME!!"

"event","Finals week is finally here.  In some ways I am happy and in other ways I am angry!!  Finals just suck, especially the ones that your professors make cumulative.  (D COUTTS AND MORRIS!!!)  I have to do a lot of studying for their classes. So this is the end of my journal entry.  Matt is a great friend.  I hope we stay that way and maybe it will turn into more.  (Who knows.)"

"event","Today was a crappy day.  I had to do Practicum today.  I played Mozart's Horn Concerto No. 1 and totally screwed it up.  In the last 20 measures, I missed counted a 6 bar rest and that screwed me for the rest of the piece. I felt really mad at myself because I've never done that before.  Also, my teacher only fave me the solo a month ago when other people have had theirs since the beginning of the semester.  Then I found out today that if you are a junior and a music education major then you have to do 3 practicums a semester.  That really sucks. Oh well, juries are next week so I still have time to make up for my terrible performance today. Then I went into the computer lab after that and Becky was playing the Stephen Lynch CD that I burned for her and she really cheered my up.  Thanks Bass!!  Tomorrow my sister is making her Confirmation.  So, my brother and I went shopping and got her a Sox pillow and jersey.  It really killed me to buy that Sox merchandise since I am a Cubs fan. It was like yesterday when I went to RENT!, Sharesa went to Burger King and ordered a king sized fry.  It really killed her to do that since she is a manager at McDonalds.  
RENT! was so much fun.  When we were walking back to the train station, there were some cop cars that pulled up and the one officer told us to go another way. We later found out that there was a shooting at Clark and Van Buren.  SCARY!! 
I can't wait for school to end.  Next week is finals and I'm a little nervous about that.  Oh well, I'll study my ass off this weekend and have fun next weekend.  Til next time."

"event","Tonight, I am going to see RENT!  It's a musical.  I am so excited.  Becky has seen it and she loves it.  It is her favorite musical.  We are taking the train down to the Schubert Theater where it is playing.  It looks really good."

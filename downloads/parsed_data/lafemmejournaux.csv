I'm very pleased with it.
Rachel did an excellent job shooting and editing, as usual.

"event","So I'm back. Kind of.
After busting it for 10 months at the Times, winning some (if I may say so) pretty B.A. awards, I took my dignity and split after a conversation with my bosses.
Took some time to job search around, got rejected by a bunch of newspapers because I did not have a paper degree to show them, and felt very disheartened.
Meanwhile, I worked at Ruby Tuesday to pay the bills and did a lot of soul-searching.

WHY am I in media?
WHAT made me want to major in journalism?
WHERE do I see myself going in my career?
and generally, what is it that I want out of life? What do I love, where is my passion?

It definitely wasn't refilling sweet tea at a chain restaurant in Decatur.
And like a sign from God, one day I'm clicking around on Facebook and I see that a girl I went to high school with (Darcelle Hall, bless her heart), posted a status update saying WAAY 31 in Huntsville needed producers.
So I hit her up with a ""O RLY?"" message and sent in a disc of old  ""Update""s and a resume.
Interviewed with the (soon after to become) news director, who was impressed that I could use non-linear editing, and didn't look like a total fool on camera.

He hired me as the 10 o'clock producer in July. I started July 21, but before I was even done training to be a producer, I was out covering apartment fires and such.
Within weeks I was the weekend reporter.
Then a few months after, I went back to full-time producer.
Which I did not enjoy.
Discovered quickly that my passion is truly being out IN the field, getting the news.
And not locked up in the newsroom, dealing with pain-in-the-butt photographers and staring at a computer screen.

In February, my boss approached me about becoming a one-man-band reporter/photog/editor, working out of the Florence bureau.
We're moving the office there from the county tax building to the UNA campus media building, which in theory will give me a plethora of eager college students to help me with stuff. Like, shooting standups or watching my live shots.

Anyhow, we're still waiting for that to happen. 
I'm impatient.
I'm ready to get things moving.
In the mean time, I'm one-man-banding in Huntsville.
The transition from reporter, to producer, to one-man-band has been interesting.
Probably more frustrating than the transition from print to broadcast has been.

If there was one thing I did right in all of my college career, it was taking my elective credit requirements and keeping them in the journalism department. Getting that double concentration in print and broadcast was brilliant, and now I'm pretty sure I can handle just about any job opportunity or challenge that comes my way. I took Dr. C's sermons on ""converged media"" to heart and voila, made the transition with ease.
Sure, I had to get out of my ""print"" way of writing things, accept the fact that in television you can NOT tell the whole story (try cramming all the sides of what would be a 40-inch story into a 30 second VO...not going to happen) but I adjusted quickly.

However, now... I'm using my techie geek skills as the only person in the office on a Mac, only person in the station using non-linear editing.

I'm constantly learning new things, and at the same time, feeling overwhelmed at my lack of knowledge.
This is an interesting profession.
You have to be a jack of all trades, master of whatever you can, literally.
I need to know about the history of a nuclear power plant in Hollywood, as well as FEMA requirements for federal storm damage aid.
Meanwhile, I need to remember to white balance, and check that the auto focus is not locked in on the banner behind my interview's head, instead of his face.

*sigh*

It's 10:47 a.m.
I've been at work since 9.
I came in, hooked my laptop up, and then proceeded on to the budget meeting.
I had planned to do the last interview I need for a hold piece I've had on the back burner for a week. (and my earlier interviews are antsy for the story to run).
I even wore the same jacket I wore last week, so I could match the standup if my boss decided to run the story today.
But instead, in about half an hour, I'm going to cover a luncheon with the Huntsville/Madison Chamber of Commerce, where they are going to announce and present awards for ""Best Workplaces.""
Hopefully while I'm there I can knock out the interviews I need for the hold package (it's a story about new business development in Hville. My earlier interview was with a couple who owns 4 Bojangles restaurants, and just opened a new one. It was pitched by their PR guy, but I went with it.)

And that is how the day should go. I'm not sure what I'll get out of this luncheon, maybe a package, but I'm thinking a VOSOT-GRX. I don't think I'll have time to follow whoever wins the award back to the office, talk to employees and shoot b-roll, and write and edit a pkg for the 6 p-m show.
That's another thing, it's so difficult to get everything, EVERYTHING done by deadline.
Capturing my video, logging, writing, tracking, editing, and then putting on makeup and fixing my hair and setting up my live shot or newsroom shot...it's tough.
Just another challenge of the job.
I'll save my rant for ""newsroom cutbacks and its impact on quality for the viewer"" for another day and entry.
For now, I'm going to touch up my hair, take off my flip flops and replace them with black stilettos, and at least try to look like a professional to talk to these people."

obviously, putting my makeup on in the dim publisher's bathroom is NOT a good idea. It looks like i've got a dark smudge on the side of my face from where I tried to put ""shading"" so I don't look like such a fatty.
That didn't work out, clearly.
I emailed my DJ friend in London and asked him if there was anyway he could make us some intro music. He said he'd work on it for us. I'm so happy! We definitely need what derek keeps calling ""production value.""
Yes.
But that requires money. and called in favors. 
Work today was kinda lame. I didn't do too much, but not because I didn't try. Nothing came through. Which means I'm going to have a ton of work to do tomorrow to catch up on my real estate story for the sunday focus and for the Salute to Industry tab due the 15th.
bleh.
Last night I caused news to be late, or I felt like I did, anyway. The city council meeting got hot when the mayor basically said he felt like the city did enough for the cops and they don't need a pay raise. the cops were at the meeting en masse and got mad. some even stormed out in the middle.
but i had to wait for an hour for the cops to give me a statement and then they wouldn't stop talking. so i was late getting my story finished (though it was 21 inches and I did it in 10 minutes) and that made us late getting news to press. 
boo.
umm...i think that's it on the work front. like i said, it's been relatively boring the last few days, though i feel like things are going to heat up soon.
stay tuned,

"event","Alright, so I checked out Fox 6's website to see who that girl was that I ran into at the courthouse yesterday. I've had this nagging feeling ever since I saw her that I'm a loser, basically. That there's this girl with as much talent as me and the same age as me on primetime top 40 news. and that i just suck as a person.
but no, I found out the old hag has a few years on me. LOL. she graduated from UA in 2002.
Which puts her having 3 or 4 years more experience if she started right after school like I did.
So i'm not a loser, I'm just impatient. That's good to know.
lol.
Why does the term ""local newspaper"" sound so...demeaning? Like, ""oh yeah, she writes for the local newspaper"" versus ""oooooh, she's on the local news!""
Psssh,please.

aaalright, so this was definitely not my best update. it was a weird shoot, i felt really self-conscious and i was busy and didn't have enough time to really get into it. Plus Derek's editing was shotty this time.  Notice where the audio overlaps after the first vosot?
bah.
laaame. I gotta do better from now on, I have a rep to keep up. lol. (meaning I gotta show miss ashley nix fox 6 that not only do i have a way of getting classified info, but i can present it on-air as well as she does. or better.)
man i'm feeling competitive!"

"event","I'm sitting here in an empty newsroom at 7 p.m. Friday. Everyone has either gone home or gone to cover football. Derek is in his office and he's listening to the White Stripes ""Ickythump"" on Pandora and for some reason right now I remember why I chose this profession and I love it.
I'm not going to cop out because I'm ""afraid"" of not making it, not getting enough money to live or whatever. I will not settle for a job that doesn't make me happy but in truth, I KNOW I belong in this career. I was made for it and I will not stop.
With that said, I have a lot of work to do. Figuratively and literally. Right now I've got two more stories to write for tomorrow's paper and one to write for Sunday. 
But I just had to rant while I had the moment.
AAAAAAND now it's gone.

"event","this was the loooongest day. and it wasn't supposed to be. I&nbsp;woke up early and went to work at like, 9 a.m. I know, right?
I still had 10 hours on my timeclock so I needed to get them in.&nbsp;
um...i edited the website some, cause&nbsp;there were errors and then I made calls to people to get info&nbsp;for my real-estate&nbsp;stories (running 10-14). And then I chilled until amanda came in and we realized David didn't go&nbsp;cover special olympics.
We raced over to special olympics and&nbsp;she got in touch with david (education reporter) and he was all ""Oh, I'm not&nbsp;coming in, I threw out my back.""
WTF?! So I ended up taking on&nbsp;his story.&nbsp;
Special olympics was neat though. Its so great to see all the disabled kids play and act like they rule the world. Cause they do. But it's days like today where I really want to step&nbsp;inside the story. I wanted to be playing with the handicap kids instead of watching others give them high fives and pin ribbons on them. Today I felt like my job was very impersonal and cold.
Afterwards we went to Festhalle for Senior Day. And that was weird, because there are hundreds of old people and I'm supposed to just go talk to some of them.
That's so stupid. First off, how do I know which old person is going to wanna talk to me? and second, how do i pick them out? and thiiiird...I didnt wanna sit and talk to an old person.&nbsp;
I took the cheap way out, grabbed the organizers and talked to them. But as we were leaving amanda told me about an old couple who were waltzing on the dance floor. Real Germans, real old, and really sweet.
So as they were walking off the dance floor I grabbed the old man and said ""WOW, where did you learn to dance like that?""
and JUST as he was talking to me I swear to God if damn FOX 6 didn't just rush up and grab the old guy out from under me and position him and his wife in front of their camera.
The old couple just looked at me with these ""WTF?!"" faces.
And the reporter says ""Oh, I'm sorry, are you on deadline?""
and I just walked off. GRR.
Back to the office, grabbed my video camera and the nikon and went to the courthouse where I had planned to stake out the Hanceville people going into the grand jury.
When I got there, WAYY 31 was blocking the security line because the guards wouldn't let them in with their cameras. lol.
So I walked up to the Xray and handed the guy my camera bag and said ""Don't put it through the conveyor, it's a camera"" and the deputy is like, ""Oh, that's OK"" and lets me go on through. I even set off the metal detector and they didnt check me, they just said ""It's your belt"" and let me through.
LOL!
Upstairs outside the courtroom was a bunch of Hanceville residents I had met before, including one Ed Flaig, owner of the flamingly biased ""Trinity News"" paper.
And I had a camera. HA!
Anyhow, I got some good info, saw who came and went (ie: who was subpoenaed) and chatted with the locals before splitting back to the office to write.
oh but before i left, this blonde chick just bops up in there and starts flipping her hair and acting dramatic with everyone. She looked like she was my age or younger, but she was with Fox 6 in Bham.
great, more TV people. And she and Flaig were all fussing about how they couldn't get a copy of the subpoena.
LOL. I walked up to them and said, ""Um, THIS subpoena?"" and showed them the copy of JoAnn Walls' subpoena she gave me last week.
Bham girl was all ""OMG! YOU GOT THIS?!?!""
she got flustered and texted on her iPhone and then left. I followed a few minutes later and she was outside with the rest of the TV guys who were NOT allowed in the courthouse (ha) and she was on her phone and typing on her laptop.
So I stopped by and gave her my card and told her to call if she needed help with anything. she said ""OMG you are just the sweetest! thank you!""
what an idiot.
back at the office i finished my second story and heard a fire call on the scanner. structure fire. I was not enthused. now, i know i said i like fires and stuff, and i do, but today i had on these ferocious heels and my feet were killing me. but whatev, i went out anyway, and this fire was FOREVER out there, like almost to jasper out there.
By the time I got there the house was smoking dust and firefighters were still squirting the ruins and hauling off pieces of it.
I saw my old firefighter friend from Good Hope, trademark cigar hanging out of his mouth. He was funny, he told me how he started smoking cigars at 15 because his mom found out he was smoking cigarettes. she made him smoke a cigar and he ended up loving them and has smoked the same brand his whole life. lol.

after the fire i booked it to hanceville for the 6 p.m. Business Owners and Concerned Citizens Meeting. About halfway through Joann walls comes in and people start asking her about the grand jury and she says she didn't get questioned, that only TWO people got questioned.
uh oh.
I got up in the middle of the meeting, drove waaay to fast to the office and ran in literally yelling ""HOLD THE PRESS!""
I told Amanda and we re-wrote my story about the hanceville hearing in 2 minutes.
and then i updated the web and watched amanda lay out pages and then i came home.
ta-dah!
i still feel like i end up doing more stuff than the other reporters. It's making me kinda bitter. Amanda and I talked about it today and she said she's mentioned how I feel to derek, the ME.
But nothing EVER gets done. No one gets punished for slacking, he supports bad story ideas and I dont want the pressure taken off me, I just want it put on everyone else.
but I guess that's just my young idealism showing up. *cough*
Until tomorrow,

whatever. I don't feel like I did too much today. I spent a lot of time on the phone though.
These two men&nbsp;brought in a bag of brown water they said came out of their drinking tap, so I called around and investigated that. Didn't write a story though, i'm thinking this might turn into something big, or I could just get lost in red-tape like I do most investigative things.

"event","<p>I know Derek, the managing editor, changed the daily staff meeting time to 11 a.m. But 11 a.m. just comes sooo early. Granted, it's better than 2 o'clock meetings, because by 2 I'm usually running around, freaking out over stories that are falling through or waiting on phone calls or doing SOMETHING usually more important than listening to Carolyn explain the latest geriatric fun-day.<br />But the 11 a.m. thing came early today. I mean, I woke up at 9, took Pierre out and got dressed but it just seems to take me forever to get going in the morning. Not to mention the commute. Anyways, suffice it to say that despite my best efforts (and I really did try), I rolled into the Times parking lot at 10 after 11 and snuck in the back door.<br />I was a zombie on the drive to work today too. I just spaced out and listened to Joe Mugg's Coffee House CD 3. I can't even remember what I was thinking about, but I'm pretty sure it wasn't that important.<br />Anyhow, I didn't miss the staff meeting. When I walked in, Derek had this girl hanging around him. First thought, ""Great, I got replaced this early?! REALLY shouldn't have missed the staff meeting...""<br />but alas, no. He started the meeting right after I clocked in and introduced the girl as a ""job shadower"" from Vinemont High. The job shadower I forgot about.<br />He told everyone she had written 2 stories already this morning and I saw this pained look crawl across her face. It made me smile a little on the inside.<br />But thinking about her staying by Derek's side all day made me realize that would be cruel and I should step in to help. So introduced myself to Carieanne and told her she could hang with me for the day.<br />The budget was stocked and Derek said he didn't really need anything from me today. An easy day?! Are you kidding?<br />So Carieanne and I took it easy...kind of. We talked about the job and what she thinks she wants to do with life. She said she either wants to go into media or be a first grade teacher.<br /><em>Well after today I know what she's going to do...<br /></em>Anyhow, news editor Amanda suggested we go check out the Festhalle and see what's going on with Oktoberfest. Yeah, the city has this Oktoberfest celebration every year&nbsp;because apparently it was settled by Germans a couple hundred years ago or something...I don't know. I would know if I wasn't too busy snapping shots of this woman in Victorian clothes with two bichons dressed in traditional German attire and had actually listened to the guest speaker at the opening ceremonies.<br />But I digress.<br />Now, my former boss TIm always used to give me the DUMBEST assignments. He would call them ""watercooler"" stories, the ones that have no real news value but that people would read and talk about. Well, I came up with a stupid story today that would have made Tim proud...<br />I gave it the slug: To brat, or not to brat.&nbsp;<br />While A, CA and I were talking about Oktoberfest, we somehow got on the track of German food and A wanted to know what the difference was in a bratwurst and a polish sausage.<br />So...story of the day.<br />CA and I hit up the restaurants serving German food for the festival and we asked the owners about the differences in bratwursts and polish sausages. It was ridiculous, but honestly I kinda thought it turned into a neat little story. I wrote it about German food and how German food is an integral part of Oktoberfest and the community. So BLAM!<br />My publisher bought CA and I big ol German hotdogs too, ya know, for research of course.&nbsp;<br />I got pics of CA stuffing her face. HA! Afterwards, we sat at the table at the cafe and quizzed each other with trivia pursuit cards that were stuffed into the sugar caddy.<br />We came back to the office, dropped off the camera and I started working on the story when she had to go to band practice. I said goodbye and then realized I needed to go to Hanceville to get the latest on that mess.<br />I called ahead of time, the city clerk told me the mayor was not there (surprise.)<br />I just drove on up to Hanceville anyway. The Mayor was not there so I talked to the clerk, Tania. Asked her how many apps were turned in for the fire chief position.<br />""Um... I really don't know...""<br />(she never knows anything, I don't think anyone ever tells her anything).<br />Great, whatever. I took notes on what she said, thanked her, and then drove over to the fire station to see if anybody was over there.<br />When I got there, I noticed there were a few cars in the parking lot but it wasn't until I pulled RIGHT UP to the door that I saw the mayor sitting in there with a couple of other guys.<br />BINGO! she was hiding out in the fire station.<br />So I walked on in, asked her some questions and was as sugary sweet as I could be. After all, the last run-in the Mayor had with the Times was when Karen barged in her office with a video camera and asked her if she was using her position to get residents into a state-subsidized housing project. LOL.<br />I got what I needed and went back to the office. Was there for 5 minutes before the scanner went off.<br />18-wheeler on fire, southbound on I-65, 10-50, just south of exit 304.<br />Woo. I usually like explosions, wrecks and other things that go ""boom"" but I was ill-suited for traipsing in the medians today. Stilettos and skirt ill-suited.<br />Whatev, I was disappointed the dispatcher didn't call for backup EMS or Air Evac, no injuries. But fire is still cool.<br />The interstate was so blocked up that I put my caution lights on and went down the closed-off exit ramp on the shoulder. I could see the smoke for miles, that got me psyched. I got out and had to walk a while because the hazmat truck and some other cars were blocking the shoulder further up. So I booked it up 65 in heels. People were out of their cars, looking at the accident and stuff and asking each other what happened. When I got closer some man was all ""The troopers said no one can go past this point.""<br />I just looked at him and then looked down at the camera around my neck. And he said ""well, I guess you can, since you're press.""<br />That's right, buddy. Power of the press. I get up close and personal with all things flam-ey and dangerous.<br />I started chatting with some of the deputies I met at Smith Lake park the day they found that car in the lake. I took some shots from in the ditch so I could see the fire that had spread from the truck into the woods beside the road.<br />The truck was all melted and torched, it looked JUST LIKE a dinosaur (or later I settled on dragon) skeleton.<br />Anyhow, while I was shooting I noticed this firefighter on the top of a truck waving at me. I looked around to make sure he was waving at me, and he was, so I walked on up to him. He was one of the Good Hope old guys I had met at a house fire about a month ago. And, for some reason, I was all ditzy and flirty that night, but it paid off. This guy remembered me and let me stand up on his firetruck to get shots of the wreck.<br />Cool, except for I was in heels and a skirt. I'm guessing he didn't care too much. Plus the hose was linking at the connector to the truck so I kept getting squirted in the face and I was worried about the camera. So that was a short trip but I could see traffic was backed up for miiiiles. And there was NO WAY I was getting out of that mess. I looked at my phone, it was 4:45, my deadline was 5:30 and I still had bratwurst, hanceville and now wreck to write. AAHHH!<br />So I ran BACK to my car and on the way people were stopping me asking what happened and how long traffic would be stopped.<br />""Troopers say it'll be about 2 hours guys, sit tight.""<br />but I was a little freaked still about getting out of that mess. And then I heard some EMS guys talking about how they were going to get the ambulances out and back in service.<br />BINGO!<br />I drafted on the tails of the ambulance that went UP the shoulder I came DOWN on. haha. Whatever, I'm convinced anybody can do anything if they have their caution lights on. I mean, who's going to stop you?<br />I went up the down exit. that was fun.<br />Back to the office, wrote my stories and voila! Another finished day.<br />And one that I thought was going to be a boring day behind a computer turned out a little suprising and eventful after all!<br />This entry was long so I'm not going to get into my rant about special sections and drama with coworkers. I'll save that until tomorrow.<br />I spaced out a little bit on the way home, too. The drives are good for collecting myself and just...I dunno, being, without responsibility, without challenge. Just thinking, feeling. Tonight I rolled the windows down and felt fall blast through the night and into the drivers seat and I thought about cowards and cowardice. That thing that makes people hide and lie and deny themselves the potential they should fulfill. I don't want to be like that.<br /><br />Until another day,<br />Britt<br /></p>"

"event","So. Computers. Pretty nifty, eh?

I think I would like to have a career involving computer use. Graphic design is pretty cool. I doubt I'm very good at it, but it would be fun, anyway. But, seriously, let's take a step back and look at computers. COMPUTERS! And more importantly: The INTERNET! It's probably one of the most amazing things ever. That sounded childish, but I am speaking with all trueness. You can contact someone across the globe in milliseconds. It's ridiculous! It's beautiful, really. It can do amazing things, which I rarely stop to appreciate.

Now that I have stated how much respect I have for computers: What the hell, man? It's just a computer. It's not as great as I said it is. Wouldn't it be better to spend time outside, or (God forbid) actually do some studying? I spend at least 3 hours on the computer everyday, I'd say. It's unbelievably wasteful.

These are my two opposing view points. And I make no plans to actually do anything about changing my habits, even if I do decide whether or not I should spend so much time on the computer. And really, this is a much bigger debate than I am making it sound like. This is the entire idea of progress versus simplicity. Does technology help or hurt more? With all the new technology we have achieved huge feats our ancestors would never have dreamed of. On the other hand, how much is it REALLY helping us? Honestly, I miss the simpler days when a man could build everything he used and knew how it worked. (Not that I ever lived in said time period.) I have no clue as to how my computer works, and I doubt I'll ever understand all of it.

But with all the progress we've made in transportation and medical fields, how can one argue against this great technology? It's really a very difficult debate. Is it worth debating or should we just continue to increase the technology we produce and hope the ramifications are good? I'm too young to be worrying about this type of thing. Good day."

"event","Why do my parents always fight? I know supposedly all couples fight, but aren't they supposed to love each other even though they fight?

Tonight it was the broken garage door, last night it was why my sister didn't get into a certain college. Normal people don't fight over these tiny little things. It's ridiculous. It's not as if I don't expect them to fight once in a while, but they obviously don't like each other [let alone love!] They say they aren't getting a divorce for me and my sister because they don't want to uproot our lives. Honestly, constant fighting is so much worse than having divorced parents. Not too mention the huge guilt trip it puts on me when they tell me they're spending time with this person they hate so it doesn't disturb my life.

I can't imagine how they ever thought it would be a good idea to get married. Then they tell me I don't know what I'm doing with my life. I'm tired of their ridiculous stunts. They act like 5 year olds. It's just incredibly annoying."

No really though, I'm really worried about things right now. Things that are worrisome. Worrisome things. So you know what has been happening to me A LOT? People make these assumptions about me and say their assumptions would make me cool. Then they ask me to verify said assumptions. I find it incredibly hard to tell them that they were wrong. I don't like telling people they are wrong to begin with. Then they tell me I'm a better person for what they assumed. So that makes me a liar because I don't tell them they are wrong. And I don't like lying.

I honestly don't. I used to lie a lot when I was younger and now I really regret it. Not that it was ever about anything important as far as I remember. But it feels like people think all these things about me that aren't true. And now I'm all about being myself. Dunno why, but it's true.

Oh, and just as I was about to get into a really good rant, I've got to get off the computer. Drat!

Ok, so whats up? As if I had anything important to say. Only that I think too many people worry about too many things. And that there are too many things for too many people to worry about.

Alive! Alive with love! I wont let them take you!

So today life was pleasantly peaceful and peacefully pleasant. Or it was for me. Im sure it wasnt too great for lots of others.

Should they catch us, and dispatch us to those seperate work camps: Ill dream about you, I will not doubt you with the passing of time. Should they kill me your love will fill me, as warm as the bullets.

Sometimes I wonder if anything I do will ever amount to anything. But I'm sure everyone thinks about that. I suppose its unimportant. I just feel like talking and no one's there. So I came here. I wonder."

Also I think I said ""Nobody is even real anymore."" What did I mean by that? It doesnt make any sense whatsoever. Oh well, on with the mad-laughing-hilarity.

So anyway I came to talk about my failure at life. I plan not to say nearly as much swearwords as I did last time.

I didnt do my math homework. I got it a week ago and have had that much time to complete it. But I didnt because Im lazy. So I woke up this morning and thought it would be a good idea to pretend to be sick so I didnt have to turn it in. So I did that and I got to stay home. But all of today I still didnt work on the assignment. Now its half an hour til my bedtime and Im halfway done, only my parents think I finished my homework and if I tell them I didnt I will be in trouble, and they will probably figure out the whole reason I stayed home.

In conclusion Im a really bad person. 

Suggestions on how to change this? Kthxbai"

"event","Me! And maybe my sister to who knows?

So despite that explanation point I am neither excited nor happy about this. But not really mad either... just upset. So last night Sara (my sister) said she was going to the museum with some friends, and theyre like sophomores and stuff... you know? James, Dennis, Kate... those people. And Ive met them and they are pretty cool, and I dont know if youd say were friends or anything but I think Id like to be friends you know? So at dinner I asked Sara if I could go, and she said it was ok. Im not sure if thats like, the exact words we used but I definitely asked and she definitely said I could go. So I was a little happy about that, I guess...

So then this morning I woke up and I was thinking 'This is stupid I shouldnt go, none of these people even like me Ill just get ignored...' But then both my mom and dad asked me if I was going and I said to both of them 'I dont know, what do you think?' And they both thought I should go so I decided I would because it would be stupid not to go now, anyway. So during breakfast, I made a comment about going to Boston and my sister said in this like really... I dont know annoyed? Disgusted?... voice, 'What?!? You arent going?' And so I was like what? Only I just said 'Oh...' But my dad told her she said I could goand he said unless you invite Karen you cant go. And of course my sister who can be really stubborn said flat out No she wasnt inviting me and wasnt apologizing.

And this is the part I really think was completely 100% her fault because hello? Did she really think I was gonna go after she just told me she really didnt want me to go. She just proved the point that nobody would want me there. So if she said sorry, or invited me I definitely wouldnt have gone. I say 'Thats ok, I didnt really want to go anyways.' but instead she kept on saying how me, my mom, and my dad all misunderstood that she said I couldnt go yesterday. And even I didnt care. I wouldve said, 'Oh sorry I thought you said I could. Nevermind.' But my dad wouldnt let her go. He said she couldnt and he called mom and she agreed. So now Saras pissed at me. Even though if it was my choice she could go.

I know its totally unfair to her friends to not let her go now, because she was giving everyone a ride. I didnt want to ruin things for her and her friends. I didnt even do anything. But shes probably gonna call her friends and tell them how she cant go because her whiney sister wanted to go to and when she said no her parents forced her not to go. And its really unfair because Im not an annoying little sister. Why would I even want to go after my sister told me she didnt want to go. That would just be stupid. But its gonna be my fault you wait. Its my fault for even asking. I shouldve realized no one would ever want me to go with them anywhere."

It pisses me off that Im a fucktard with no friends. I mean seriously what is my problem? But lets not talk about me.

Nobody is even real anymore. Maybe Im sounding like a self obsessed loser, but thats kinda what I am. Is it wierd that I feel this way? How can people feel any differently? Am I even making sense? Probably not, but this isnt for your understanding anyway. Im a fucking gay fag. I mean look at what I just typed I cant express anger in any way other than swearing. What the fuck is wrong with me? And just people in general. Cause let me tell you, Im depressed and emo and shit, but there isnt even a reason. I dont have a bad, life and I know that. I live in a safe area and people are generally nice to me, and my family is annoying but not seriously disfunctional or anything. Yet, I totally suck. Despite my life being like perfect, I still screw things up majorly. Im basically a POSER. How annoying is that? That I know this and I still dont do anything to change. Im a lazy bitch, but I dont care. I really wished I cared more about the important stuff and less about the useless crap, that everyone else seems to care about..."

Pardon my my french. Im not so mad that I have to read it per se. Mostly Im mad cause Harry Potter is coming out soon, and this will take away from my reading time! Oh hey havent I talked about Harry Potter 7 yet? I havenr?!?!?!? Oh my goodness...

Well if you dont know Harry Potter you dont know me. Harry Potter is the greatest series ever written. Everybody loves to watch the movies and refuse to read the books, But, heres what I say to those people: YOU SUCK! The movies arent horrible movies, theyre just horrible interpretations of the book. I have yet to see the fufth movie but as of today it is not very good. All my friends who read the book are saying its really bad. *sigh*

Over-the-Summer Homework...
&nbsp;
Ok so, first of all, they only give it to people who go into Honors course... Didnt I already have to work extra hard to get into this class? Why should I have to do stupid assignments about dumb things they are just gonna review during class? 

Ok off topic for a sec... I just saw two topless old guys running down my street... Eww! What is it with old men and not wearing shirts while running? Its just a little disgusting...

Anyway, back to summer work...

For example for US History I have to be familiar with some 30 random people who did stuff in one war or another. Yes, ok I should know what in general happened in the Revolutionary War and stuff, but do I really need to know the leader of the suppression of 'Whiskey Rebellion'? No I do not... 

And for Spanish? 6 pages of random translations of Carlos Ayala's summer cruise? Are they seriously trying to remind me of all the fun things kids are SUPPOSED to be doing over the summer while I do homework? Thats just cruel...

So anyway Im supposed to be doing doing homewrok right now, but why not tell non-existant readers about the cruelties of Wilmington HighSchool...

Also I have a nice view of a certain boy who happens to be across the street... Ok so maybe its not completely horrible but still? Do you not see the injustices thrust upon me and my fellow classmates? Its incredibly unfair..."

(I was holding my breath that whole time!)

So anyway, no one reads this journal anymore... Not even Shauna. I suppose Ill miss the few comments I got but also its more private now. Its stupid that I would make a private journal online, donchathink? But I figure if I put it online Ill have more of a chance to remember to write in it because Im online a lot. Probably too much. Eh...

So anyway now that this is secret...

Hmm... what shouldI say what should I say...

Well nothing right now anyway... Except:

HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS is coming out in 15 DAYS!!!

You really have no idea how awesome this is...

Ok so yesterday when me and Shauna ewere discussing plans for today we were talking about Harry Potter, and I got kinda pissed off, because she made fun of him. Is that no horrible? I would put the respect of Harry before my friends? Harry is a FICTIONAL CHARACTER!!! But I dont know I was getting all mad and I couldnt even help it, and I was all telling myself, 'Karen calm down its just a book' but I couldnt! You know how when you get really mad you get a little hot inside, and you feel like you are swelling like a balloon? That was happening to me. I even started shaking a bit. It was pathetic.

So what to do, what to do?

Stop reading Harry Potter? No!

Break off my friendship with Shauna? DEFINITELY NO!

Act like nothing happened yesterday? I guess so...

Well thats it I guess... Dogs like the taste of pillows sometimes..."

Hmm...<br /><br /><br />So anyway, the other day I was watching a show <a href=""http://www.thenakedbrothersband.com/"">The Naked Brothers Band</a> (which just so you know I dont watch very often I was being indiscriminate.) And about five minutes into the show I already knew what was going to happen. So the leader of the band has to wrestle his girlfriend and he was talking about he didnt want to wrestle a girl. I could already tell it was going to be about how girls are just as strong as boys and it should be more fair...<br /><br />Oh those feminists! I think that feminism has maybe gone a little too far. Beccause yes I know women use to get paid less, but I mean c,mon, I seriously believe that your boyfriend should be stronger than you. I mean girls with huge muscles? Gross! I mean c'mon the whole guys are strong, and are dominant and women are beautiful and do the important not athletic stuff has been working for years. Why stop a good thing? Whatever if youre a feminist you are cool or whatever, but now Im not so sure...<br /><br />Ok like on every show doesnt always talk about how girls are smarter than boys? I mean I think thats true, but I mean I think its pretty much just as sexist. Boys are strong, girls are smart. I think it should be kept that way. Im not saying that WMBA and stuff like that is wrong. Women can definitely be strong, but I mean... whatever. You know what? Just do what you want. You wanna be a feminist, be a feminist, do what makes you happy but just lay off all the stuff in my TV ok?"

In other news I found out there is a HUGE party going on that I wasnt invited too. It is an outrage!!! Not that I would go if I was invited. Because cool people like me dont go to parties like that. They go to small reclusive parties. You know who else doesnt go to big lame parties like that? ME! I am an island. I am like an island in the Bermuda Triangle, people try to get to me but they cant because Im so cool and mysterious. That didnt really make much sense. A lot of the stuff I say doesnt make sense though.

I wish Kellie would call already so I can call Shauna to tell her whats going on. Because Shaunas mom is driving. Mostly because my parents and sister (who can drive now) are going to a play. Its the one at the High School, by the way, not some fancy one.

My dad just called and I was excited because I thought it was Kellie and then it wasnt so I was upset and I think I mightve been a little rude to my dad. Oh dear. *sighs*

1) When the person disagrees say, ""Aww look at the big baby. The big baby wants his bottle!""

2) Make up stories that prove your point whether they are true or not.

3) Interrupt the person repeatedly saying only, ""You dont know that, (insert persons name here)!""

4) Make your point and when they say theyre opinion just say, ""My friend died.""

5) Just give them a hug and walk away.

"event","&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nothing important happened today I guess. But it really depends on what you think is important. So I got up. Wait, no, my dad woke me up. Then I laid in bed for about 20 more minutes while I pretended to be getting ready. Its actually a little bit surprising he doesnt realize Im not getting up. I know 20 minutes isnt that long for ssome people to take to get ready, but it is for me and I think he should realize that by now. Then again, maybe he does know and just doesnt really care. But, anyways after that I got up and actually started getting ready. Today I chose to wear blue jeans, (which I always wear, or atleast 98% of the time) then this black short sleeved shirt with white trim, white buttons and and a little white flower where there is sometimes a pocket. I also wore a white sweatwhirt. It was a noncolorful outfit I guess you could say. And then for breakfast I had scrambled eggs, toast, and a glass of milk. Its kind of a big breakfast you could say. I dont like how a lot of people dont have breakfast. They say its the most important meal of the day, and they are probably right (whoever they are) because thats where you get your energy for the day.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So I had breakfast and waited a little while to go out to the bus. When it was getting time to leave we went out throught my new garage (oo la la) and I waited for about a minute, with Eric who is at my bus stop and in 6th grade. I never thought about it but I guess Im pretty lucky to have my bus stop right at my driveway. But also my stop is I think the last one so sometimes there isnt a seat for me, or I have to sit next to someone I dont like or usually someone who doesnt like me. Sometimes I feel bad because I am sitting next to someone who doesnt like me and maybe I shouldnt because I dont like it when people I dont like sit next to me. But really its not my fault because theres usually no other seats. I have to admit though, its better than it was at the beginning of the year. Sometimes I had to sit practically on the floor, but now usually I get a seat with only one other person. Atleast I do in the morning. In the afternoon a lot of kids come onto our bus who arent supposed to. But atleast then I have a fair chance at getting a seat. I guess on my bus I really only have 2 friends, Tyler and Cristina. Actually I dont know if youd really call me and Tyler friends. He is nice I guess but I dont think he particularly likes me. But I dont know. It was better, I think, in 6th and seventh grade, because Nicole, who is in 9th grade now, would save a seat for me in the morning because she got on early. but now she goes to the Tech. And then I was at school.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I got to school I waited in the cafeteria as usual. Then Shauna arrived. She is one of my best friends. I think she considers me a good friend too. Atleast I hope so, but Im not that good when it comes to friends. I can never tell whether someone really wants to be my friend or if they just hang around with me because they feel like it. I suppose its not that big of a deal, but it can be confusing sometimes. So basically I talked to Shauna and Brianne and Jessica. They are all pretty cool I think. Oh, and Alexis borrowed a dollar from me. I dont know if she is going to pay me back but I dont really care either way. Alexis is pretty nice. Or atleast she is nice to me. Sometimes. But I dont think were friends. But what do I know right? Shauna and I were talking about her and Briannes trips to AA (alcoholics anonymous) even though she doesnt really go. Its kind of an inside joke you could say, but it is really kind of strange. A long time ago I told her I was german (because I am.) I am about 1/16 german I think. Avery small amount, but german nonetheless. So anyway one time my dad was driving Shauna and I somewhere and we were talking about being german and my dad (who wasnt even in the conversation I might add) said, ""Hey your not from Germany!"" and now Shauna doesnt believe me. Later that evening I talked to my dad and it turns out he thought I meant I was born in Germany (which I wasnt) and he admitted that I was, indeed, part german. But now, Shauna doesnt believe me, and pretends I am an alcoholic who doesnt know my own heritage.

And now I have to stop typing because I have to go to Karate soon. I might add more later but this is all for now."

"event","She's two! I can hardly believe my baby is two already. I was looking at her sleeping last night thinking about watching her sleep the very first night in the hospital. She's really not a baby any more. She's most definitely a little girl at this point. She's communicating more and more every day. At this point she knows over 100 signs and over 80 words and she's adding more every day. She knows all kinds of sounds animals make, knows most parts of her body and has several colors down (most of the time). She tried to count, but it's generally 2, 5, 6. We're working on the other numbers. ;)

She's such a happy little girl. She loves music, animals, swimming and playing. We've been going to music classes once a week. For the first part of the class, she's often quiet and takes everything in. Then about halfway through she will start to dance and participate. At home she tries singing now and then and does the hand motions to ""Itsy Bitsy Spider.""

She and Lillia are great friends. Lillia is extremely tolerant of Emmaline and recently, when Emmaline had to spend the day at the vet to run some tests related to her epilepsy, Emmaline was upset that we left her kitty at the vet. We have to look at the LOLcats every day on the computer and she also enjoys looking at her late grandfather's art, especially elephants, giraffes and lions. She's also really big on cows and ducks (and the sounds they make).  I chose to put a cow, ducks and a pig on her birthday cake since those are some of her favorites.

The girl is definitely my daughter and loves to swim (and if she can't do that, the tub is an acceptable substitute). She can hold her breath underwater for a couple of seconds and kicks her legs around. I can put her front end on a pool noodle and pull her around the pool while she kicks. She also loves jumping off the side of the pool into the water or going to a pool with a little kid water slide.

Playing with her friends (who she is definitely starting to recognize and have preferences for) is also a favorite activity. We go to playgroup at least once a week and often see her friends more than that. On Friday's we've been going to the open gym play at Capital Gymnastics and she loves it. (I like it too, because she completely wears herself out and has a great nap.) She jumps and swings from the bars and walks along the balance beams. It's great.

We go to the park a couple of times a week. Generally we go Tuesdays and go running, then play afterwards on the playground. On Wednesdays or Thursdays I ride my bike and pull her in the trailer. She loves riding in the trailer and asks about the bike repeatedly through the week. For her second birthday, she got her first bike - a balance bike. It's a little big for her, but she'll grow into it soon enough.

I feel like I'm always saying this, but time is just going by so quickly! She's changing so much recently. She's more expressive and her fine motor skills are really coming along. Things like eating with a spoon, building a tower of blocks, etc. are much easier for her and more accurate these days. <br /><br />She's getting more into drawing/coloring which also comes with increased fine motor abilities. One of her most-played-with Christmas presents is a magnadoodle I bought on a whim because it was on sale at Target. We bought her a mini one for use in the car and that was also a hit.<br /><br />She doesn't really say very much, but that's okay She communicates what she needs and wants with a combination of signs and words so it all seems to work out.  She can say kitty, dada, bye bye, uh-oh, want that (which she says ""nuh dat""), here (when she hands you something, which is ""dee""), beep beep (anything with wheels), and hot (her newest word, which seems to refer to just about any food, hot or not). <br /><br />She also can make signs for milk, more, fan, bear, ball, all finished, and change (for a diaper change) as well as basics like waving bye bye and shaking her head no. She doesn't say no, but she's got a good head shake! <br /><br />Overall, she's still a happy little girl. She's still pretty easy-going with things and we haven't had any major meltdowns/tantrums. I'm still holding my breath and knocking on wood and all that. She will sometimes cry a bit if she can't do something she wants to or get her way or she is trying to do something and gets frustrated, but a redirection usually resolves the situation pretty easily.</p>"

She's nearly 16 months old now and really becoming quite a little girl. It's amazing the developmental leaps that have been happening since she turned 1! <br /><br />Obviously she's quite the walker now. She walks everywhere and she's becoming much more adept with things like stairs and curbs and such. She loves to go to the park and play. The slide is THE thing. The swing she can take or leave (and often wants to leave) but she could go down the slide all day long. <br /><br />I've sort of worked out ways to go to the park at least once a week. Luckily there are a couple of good ones in the neighborhood, one I can jog to with the stroller and the other I can bike to with the trailer (or obviously drive if  need be). But I like combining it with a workout. We both get something out of it. <br /><br />She's very busy and into pretty much everything. But really, she's pretty mellow for a toddler. She doesn't have tantrums (yet) or get overly cranky or fussy unless she's overly tired or something understandable. <br /><br />She can follow all sorts of directions and understands a lot of phrases, commands and statements. She still really only has one word we can recognize as such: ""diddy,"" which means ""animal"" to her (but she's trying to say ""kitty"").  She often sounds like she's saying things, but we don't understand. I'm sure we'll begin to. <br /><br />She's also learning to eat with a spoon, which is entertaining and very messy. But she's doing okay with it. The fork isn't quite as easy for her, but then again, the toddler fork we have is sort of spork-like and not so stabby so even I have a hard time stabbing things at times. <br /><br />Here are a few fairly recent videos:<br /><br /><a href=http://www.tmitg.com/summer/lj/videos/eating-yogurt.mov>Eating yogurt</a> (this is a few weeks old - she actually does a better job now)<br /><a href=http://www.tmitg.com/summer/lj/videos/being-silly-with-dru.mov>Playing with Dru</a><br /><a href=""http://www.tmitg.com/summer/lj/videos/fun-at-the-playground.mov"">Fun at the playground</a></p>"

"event","Emmaline is now 13 months old. The big news is that in the last month she has started walking! Crawling is still faster for her, so she only walks a little here and there but she's getting better and faster with it. 

She officially took her first steps on July 24. While I didn't get video of her first steps, I did take some of her walking again about an hour later. <a href=""http://www.tmitg.com/summer/lj/videos/walking.mov"">Click here to watch.</a>

She's also started to pick up on a couple more signs. I think she mostly understands ""more"" and ""all done"" (both in the context of meal time). And in the arena of verbal communication, we've discovered that ""diddy"" doesn't just refer to cats, but to all animals. She has identified dogs, a bunny, and some donkeys all as ""diddy."" While, of course, these are not all cats, I think it's actually rather clever of her to recognize that all of these creatures are somewhat similar. So basically ""diddy"" means ""animal"" to her."

I'm in awe of how many changes occur in the first year of life. It's really astounding to watch the little person she's becoming. A year ago, we were trying to adjust to life with a newborn, which, is quite an adjustment. She ate, slept, cried and pooped. And cried. I cried too, as hormones raged through my body and I tried to recover from the birth (which I was totally unprepared for - I felt like I'd been run over by a truck).

Now I cry again. I feel extremely emotional at this milestone which, in a way, marks the end of her babyhood and the beginning of toddlerhood. But I'm also at peace with this and I look forward to seeing her develop more and more. And I'm so happy I've been able to spend so much time with my baby, soaking up all this precious little baby time: feeding her (we're still breastfeeding), snuggling with her, playing with her and just being with her. 

She's really a sweet and funny little girl and generally very good natured. She isn't walking yet, but she's pretty close. She cruises all over and can walk along with an adult holding on with only one hand. She can stand up without grabbing onto a stationary object or person and can squat down and stand back up without holding on to anything. My dad and step-mom were here over the weekend and they think she can walk alone, but just doesn't know she can yet so she hasn't done it. 

She claps, waves bye bye, points at objects and holds her arms up to be picked up. She also says da da to Roger (instead of just dadadadada randomly) and possibly ma ma. She also says kitty (""diddy!""). She also recently starting putting objects into a receptacle as opposed to just pulling them out.

We had a party on Saturday and a good time was had by all. Emmaline wasn't particularly interested in the cake so there wasn't much joyous, messy cake mashing fun. Then I think it didn't sit well and she threw up a little bit later. (But she filled her tummy with breastmilk and all was well after that.) I made her cake, dress and little crown, which everyone complimented so that was nice. She received many wonderful gifts and had a grant time playing with them and all the other kids/babies that were there. All the pics are on <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/31056658@N08/sets/72157620824119733/"">Flickr here</a>. All in all, her first birthday was a wonderful, but tiring, day!"

"event","Emmaline is 11 months old. My gosh, where is the time going!! Only 25 more days until her first birthday. For some reason that's just so crazy to me.  I feel like I'm already mourning the loss of her babyhood. The last week or so, I've been soaking up all the sweet cuddly baby time I can. 

No, it's not like she's going to turn 1 and she's no longer my baby, but it just seems like such a huge milestone and it sort of makes me sad. I need  pause button. Or even rewind! 

She's so incredibly mobile at this point. Her crawling is super fast and she cruises all over the place. Nothing within her reach is safe now! And she's discovered the baby walker. When that thing is within her site, all she wants to do is walk around behind it. <a href=""http://www.tmitg.com/summer/lj/babywalker.mov"">Here's a video of her with it from a couple of weeks ago.</a> She's actually way faster with it now. She walks right along with it in a cute, dare I say, toddley fashion!

She doesn't really say any words yet. She babbles a lot and says mamamama and dadadada, but it's hard to know if she associates anything. I sign to her somewhat intermittently, but she hasn't picked up on that yet, either. She does wave bye-bye (sort of) and also reaches towards stuff she wants and generally makes other wishes known. Oh, she also claps now sometimes. 

Last weekend we went and visited my grandma (Emmaline's great-grandma) for her 90th birthday. She has met Emmaline once before, but it was nice for them to see each other again. While we were there, I held Emmaline up next to a photo of my grandpa and they look so much alike! It's the eyebrows, we both have my grandpa's eyebrows. I wish he could have met her.

No words or signs yet, but she did finally make an attempt at clapping the other day while video chatting with my mom (""Janma"") and so that was a little milestone we've been waiting on.

Where is it going? Over the last month she's become a crazy fast crawler. You turn around and a second later she's on the other side of the room. Needless to say, we've been trying to keep up with her and get things baby proofed. <br /><br />She also want to pull herself up to standing on just about anything she encounters and she's been trying to practice standing unsupported, but she can't do that for very long before she plops backward onto her fluffy butt. <br /><br />She's becoming much more adept with her hands and it's particularly evident at meal time (solid meal time, that is). She's able to pick up small pieces of food and get them into her mouth more quickly and effectively than a month ago. She doesn't drop food much, unless she wants to. If she doesn't like something, then she will pick it up off the table and drop it onto the floor. <br /><br />She has definite food preferences. Her favorites right now are pear, avocado and banana. She's not real fond of green beans, peaches or carrots at the moment. I keep trying them so we'll see if things change.  She had raspberries for the first time yesterday and thought they were fabulous, too. Usually she's not sure about something the first time she tries them, but those were a hit. <br /><br />I've been signing to her (more, milk, and kitty mostly) but she doesn't do any signs yet and she hasn't said any real words yet either. She also doesn't clap or wave bye bye or really point but she does reach for things when she wants them and puts her arms up for you to pick her up.<br /><br />She's also not super keen about being away from me. She's got big time separation anxiety. Hopefully she'll work through that soon, because I'd like to go back to swim on Wednesday nights at some point.  But other than that, she's generally a very happy and friendly baby.</p>"

I forgot...

that I couldn't roll over in bed without a huge effort
that I couldn't tie my shoes or clip my toenails
that I woke up eleventy-billion times during the night to pee
and more....

I didn't forget...

that I felt nauseated 24 hours a day
that it was simultaneously amazing and amusing having a small creature kick your insides (and sometimes uncomfortable)
the first moment I held her was overwhelming and amazing (and makes me tear up a little just to think about it)

I also can't remember what childbirth feels like, though. I'm pretty sure it was uncomfortable ;) I remember bits and pieces, but it's a fog now.

"event","So many things have been going on lately. Our future triathlete had her first dip in the pool last week. She had somewhat mixed feelings about it. She seemed to like it except when water got on her face. Except, that is, for when she splashed it there. Then it was okay. 

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3614/3373626891_c350a5bd08.jpg"">

On Monday we went for a walk at McKinney falls state park. She had a nice time bopping along on the carrier while we walked around the park. The falls were not falling due to lack of rain, but it was a pretty walk anyway. 

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3582/3382463304_4b8f54055a.jpg"">

This past week has also been huge developmentally for Emmaline. On Monday she crawled six little crawl steps forward. From that point, she had it down and now she's becoming quite the little crawler. 

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3664/3337911599_5bcf40213e.jpg"">

And in another major developmental milestone, on Thursday she learned to pull herself up to standing all by herself. We were at a playgroup at a friend's house and she crawled over to me and pulled herself up onto my legs. Today she pulled herself up onto one of her toys (a little activity table sort of thing) several times.

She can't quite pull herself up completely on her own. She's close. <br /><br />She's also very close to crawling forward. (Backwards is still the thing for her.) She'll take a few crawls forward, then head back again. I'm sure in the next week or so she'll have forward movement down. <br /><br />Another motor development of note is her ability to go from a crawling position on her tummy to a seated position. This means she can go from sitting to crawling, move backwards, then sit up again and play in her new spot. <br /><br />In terms of her language development, her favorite thing to say is ""Bah"" and variations thereof. Bah doesn't mean anything in particular yet. It's pretty much her go-to word for everything. <br /><br />She also recently started putting her arms up to be picked up, which is cute. She also reaches out for help pulling up. Overall, she's definitely finding more ways of communicating her desires. No pointing or clapping, yet.<br /><br />She also continues to eat a wide variety of foods and is really enjoying them more and more. She's a good eater. She still nurses often. In fact, despite eating quite a few solids, her nursing hasn't decreased at all. <br /><br />One thing Emmaline isn't good at is falling asleep. She's never been great at it, but I think lately with all the new developmental stuff going on, she's really had a difficult time. Often it takes 30 minutes to an hour to get her to sleep. Once last week it took her 3 hours to go to bed. Yes, this is exhausting. Today, she's been great with less than 30 minutes for each nap. Yay! Hopefully the trend will continue. <br /><br />Once she's asleep, she usually stays asleep relatively well. That is, if, and only if, she's smooshed up against a human. So this means I spend a lot of time with a sleeping baby, either in bed or with her in a carrier. Hopefully this is something she'll grow out of. Some nights I am able to roll her off me onto the bed. Then we set up my computer with the office computer to video chat. At the signs of squirming, I rush in to make sure she doesn't wake up. <br /><br />Other than the sleeping stuff, she's such a fabulous baby. She hardly ever cries or fusses and is generally very happy. (And cute!)</p>"

I think some folks were wondering how that was going to work out, some applauded and some were skeptical. <br /><br />I'm happy to report that cloth is AWESOME. Seriously. I've had to use ""sposies"" a couple of times (when we went to KC and then again on our trip to San Diego) and I <strong>hate them</strong> with a burning passion. Seriously. I cannot say enough nasty things about disposable diapers. They suck. <br /><br />I'm such a cloth diapering addict that I hang out on the cloth diaper forums The Diaper Pin and have over 1000 posts there. Yes, that's right, I've posted over 1000 times on a cloth diaper forum. Now, to be fair, most of my posts were probably in some of the other sections. They have a range of topics there from pregnancy and childbirth to parenting, baby gear to breastfeeding and even completely unrelated stuff like books, movies, politics, cooking, sewing, and frugal living tips. It's just nice to have a place to chat with like-minded mamas. <br /><br />Okay, back on topic. Cloth diapers. They rock. Why you ask? <br /><br />My top reasons:<br /><br />- They don't leak (well, rarely). I can't even tell you how many times I had poo blowouts with sposies we we were using them during those two trips. Gross! My cloth never has containment issues.<br />- They're soft. Who wants to wear plastic underwear? I wouldn't. I'm sure the cloth is more comfy for her.<br />- Her butt looks cute! Heeh.<br />- We've saved a crapload of money.<br />- They just seem to fit better.<br />- They come in a <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/31056658@N08/3222678984/"">huge</a> <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/31056658@N08/2913053471/"">variety</a> of <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/31056658@N08/3049086512/"">cute</a> <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/31056658@N08/2922240662/"">designs</a>, <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/31056658@N08/2913216185/"">patterns</a>, and <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/31056658@N08/3098206556/"">colors</a>.<br />- I don't have to buy diaper pail liners or wipes (we use a cloth pail liner we wash with the dipes and cloth wipes as well).<br />- I have less trash every week. <br /><br />I'm sure there are even more I'm overlooking since they're such an everyday part of life for us. Any other cloth users want to chime in? I've heard babies potty train faster with cloth, but since I haven't gotten there yet, I can't speak to that. <br /><br />Sure, we have to wash them, but laundry, relative to other chores, is really not that big of a deal. I just throw them in the washer and run it. Then move to the dryer, run it and then fold them when they come out. They are fabulous!</p>"

"event","Emmaline is really starting to take to the solids more and more. I don't know if I've mentioned it, but we're using an approach to solids called Baby Led Weaning (BLW). It's sort of bigger in Europe than here (and the ""weaning"" bit doesn't mean she's weaning off breastmilk, it just means introduction to solids - British terminology difference).

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3342/3298733568_acb64a7408.jpg"">

The idea behind BLW is giving chunks of food and letting baby self-feed as opposed to pureed foods fed by a parent. So instead of mushing up banana and spooning it in, we just give her a hunk of it and let her explore and feed herself as much (or as little) as she wants. It really allows her to be independent and figure things out on her own. She hasn't had any rice cereal or any purees, she's just had pieces of food - generally cut long thin pieces she can grab on to. 

<img src=""http://photos-d.ak.fbcdn.net/photos-ak-snc1/v2344/195/44/713632115/n713632115_1991827_3953.jpg"">

So far she's had banana, avocado, sweet potato, pear, broccoli, watermelon and mango. Generally the first time she has something, she's not too sure about it, but by the second or third time, she eats a little more. Then, once she's had something many times, she's much more enthusiastic. She's getting more interested, in general with food and is figuring out more and more the biting off, chewing (gumming) and swallowing. Banana and broccoli are still her faves, probably because she's eaten them the most. The other day she had watermelon for the first time and even though she's only had it three times, I'd say it's also on the favorites list.

It was quite a busy week and we just arrived home today.  While we were there, Emmaline met a lot of new people. On Thursday she met her great-grandpa for the first time. I also got to meet up with a friend from high school that lives in San Diego. And yesterday I got to see Dru, her boyfriend and also our friend Pete. It was a fun week. <br /><br />While we were there, Emmaline had her first experience with sand at the beach which she found the absolutely facinating. I took a little video with my camera (of course, I forgot the video camera, but I captured a small video with my regular camera). <a href=""http://www.tmitg.com/summer/lj/EmAtBeach.mov"">Click here to see the video.</a></p>"

Right now her big thing is working on crawling. She's really trying hard to figure out forward locomotion.  The discovery I've been watching her go through is so entertaining. I can see that she's trying to figure it out. It's fascinating to watch. I'm so excited for her!<br /><br />She still goes backwards, but she's much more efficient. She used to prop herself up on both hands, push back, move both hands forward, and push again. Now she's doing more of a creeping backwards alternating hands. She also pushes herself up onto her feet while propped up on her hands. Somewhere between a plank pose and downward facing dog pose. And she can get one knee up under her at a time - just not both. <br /><br />She also pulled herself up onto one knee tonight while playing with a toy on the floor (she started in a sitting position). It was the first time I'd seen her do that. <br /><br />Overall, she's really exploring more what her body can do and where she can move and how far she can reach and grab. We better get to work baby-proofing!</p>"

I think perhaps a third of it was on the table, her hands, face, bib, high chair and floor. Messy fun!</p>"

She didn't try to stick the banana in her mouth, of course. So I held it for her and she tentatively opened her mouth, then got a look on her face like it tasted awful and we were certainly trying to poison her. 

I mashed some up a couple days later and fed her a little of that off my finger. I think she was more interested in my finger than the banana on it, but she didn't make as many weird faces. I think it's just going to take her time to get used to the idea. We're in no rush. We'll offer her some avocado next and see if she takes to that.

"event","Emmaline finally cut her first tooth today. This morning she gave me her usual gummy smile, but then woke up only about a third of the way through her morning nap. I couldn't get her back to sleep so I just went with it. While I was eating lunch, she was in her high chair and I was distracting her with a toy. She smiled and I saw a little flash of white on her lower gums. I stuck my finger in there and was met with a sharp hard poke. Her first tooth erupted this morning! She's been a bit cranky and difficult this afternoon. Okay, she's been a lot cranky and difficult. I gave her some teething tablets and she's finally sleeping. Hopefully for longer this time.

In other news, she's increasing her vocalizations and doing a lot more babbling. She babbled ba ba ba mostly. When she's upset she says na na ma ma na na. (She doesn't know what ma ma means, but it's kind of cute to hear.) She also babbles da da da da. Again, cute but she doesn't know she's saying dada. 

She still hasn't had any solid food, but I think she's getting to be about ready. She doesn't quite have her pincher grasp down yet. She's close, but not quite. I think we're going to forgo cereal and start her right on table foods - probably avocado or banana first.  We got her a high chair just after Christmas and she's been sitting in it playing with a sippy cup while we eat. The other day I tried to break up some frozen breastmilk and put it in a mesh feeder, but she was having none of that. She looked at me like I was trying to poison her! She's intensely curious about our food and constantly reaching out for it. When I give her a sippy cup or teether, she isn't satisfied. She wants what we have. Now!

"event","Emmaline is almost 6 months old. I can't believe how quickly the time has passed. She is really an amazing little girl. For the most part, she's pretty happy much of the time. She always seems to have a big smile. Her laugh is totally infectious and fun. 

She doesn't have any teeth yet, but they must be on the way. She's been drooling for a few months now, but I feel like the last week or so the drool production has really increased. She is drooling buckets! Her favorite toy is still <a href=""http://www.kangarooboo.com/product/details/212-Vulli-Sophie-the-Giraffe"">Sophie the Giraffe</a> and she just loves chewing on Sophie.

The big news is that Emmaline is now able to sit unsupported on her own. At first she could sit for a few seconds, then she'd topple over. But we kept working on it and in the last few days, she doesn't topple over any more. She could sit a little bit by falling forward onto her hands (gorilla pose) but she doesn't even do that any more. She does eventually get tired of sitting and topples over, but not for a long time.

She is also finally rolling over. She did it for the first time on her own a couple of weeks ago. She doesn't do it much and I still roll her over when she gets annoyed about being on her tummy. I think she forgets she can roll herself.

So Emmaline made it through her first cold, then less than a week later, moved on to her second cold. She was at daycare for a week and a half before I quit my job and she caught two colds! Unfortunately, the second cold didn't go away quite as easily and she ended up with a mild ear infection. My pediatrician told us to keep an eye on her and if she came down with a fever we might need to investigate antibiotics. Luckily, it didn't come to that. I am happy that my pedi wasn't overly enthusiastic about the antibiotics and waited. 

Emmaline is getting so big. She's nearly 15 lbs now and she's really quite a happy and social baby most of the time. I'm really enjoying being home with her. Quitting my job was definitely the right decision for us. 

Thanksgiving was fairly uneventful. Roger ran the Turkey Trot and Emmaline and I spectated. Then that evening we had a quiet dinner at home - just the three of us. Many people have asked what Emmaline ate for Thanksgiving. She had breastmilk. :) We did take a silly photo of her with a plate of food just for fun though. 

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3179/3071006948_0470d6043f.jpg?v=0"">

I get asked a lot when Emmaline will start solids. When she seems to need them, is the answer. She's doing great on breastmilk right now. I have really weird, ambivalent feelings about starting solids. I don't know why. I will probably feel better about it when I know she's actually ready. 

This past weekend my mom came in town. She arrived Thursday night. Friday night she babysat Emmaline so that Roger and I could go to the movies. We saw the new James Bond movie. It was nice to get out of the house together. 

On Saturday morning, my mom and I took Emmaline to Kansas City to meet her great-grandmother. My grandma is 89 years old and was so excited to meet Emmaline. We stayed in town until Monday and then flew home. Emmaline did so well on the airplane. She was a fabulous traveler.

She was clearly starting to feel bad yesterday mid day. By evening, she had a fever. It isn't bad - 100.6 so we gave her baby Tylenol. Night time was rough. She woke up a lot and cried and couldn't go back to sleep. We kept on top of the fever with the Tylenol and we all slept in until 10 this morning. 

She was pretty much her regular self this morning - smiling and happy. She just had a few sniffles and still has her fever - 100.7 this morning. We'll see how tonight goes. Roger is going to stay home with her tomorrow so I don't miss my first day back at work."

"event","Emmaline is now 4 months old. The time has flown by and it's time for me to go back to work on Monday. This week we've been phasing her in at <a href=""http://hawthornemontessori.com/"">Hawthorne Montessori School</a>. I really feel like we chose the right place. I'm really happy with it. Monday we spent about an hour there together. Yesterday we spent a half hour there together and then I left her for an hour. Today she stayed on her own for two hours. Tomorrow she's going to go for half a day, then Friday most of a day. Monday is her first full day.

I think the phase in process is a really nice way to do things. I cried yesterday and today, not because I'm worried about her (I know she'll be fine), but really because I miss her. We've been together constantly over the past year and I feel like a part of me is missing when we're apart. It's going to be a tough adjustment. 

Everyone continues to comment on what a cutie she is. She's also very strong and loves standing with support. One of the teachers at her school joked that she's going to be moving up to the older classroom in a couple of months (they move up once they can walk). She loves looking around at things and especially being outside. She's very attentive, focused and interactive.  Her new favorite thing to do is blow raspberries. I took some <a href=""http://www.tmitg.com/summer/lj/raspberries.mov"">video of her blowing raspberries yesterday</a>. She's still big with the drool - this is just  a new way to spread it around. 

We had her four month well baby visit with her pediatrician yesterday. She's now 13 lbs, 5 oz and measures 24.5 inches. Bigger and bigger all the time!  Nothing else really of note.  I'll leave you with a silly photo.

"event","Emmaline is becoming more smiley and fun every day. When she laughs it absolutely cracks me up. It's just too cute!! Lately, she's been sleeping really well - only waking up once during the night in the past week. It's been really nice. 

I was finally able to get some really good photos of her smiling. It seemed like every time I got out the camera, she stopped smiling. Or if she did keep smiling, all the photos came out blurry. The secret to the smiling baby photo is evidently <a href=""http://www.kangarooboo.com/product/details/212-Vulli-Sophie-the-Giraffe"">Sophie the Giraffe</a>. Every time I squeak that thing, she smiles. Magic!

"event","Emmaline turns 3 months old this week and she marked this milestone by laughing today for the first time. It was just for a moment, but it was so cute, I bust into giggles myself and she followed by laughing more. I broke out the video camera and tried to get some more laughter on film, but of course, the moment had passed. She did proceed to smile and squeal and almost laugh for the camera, so here you are, <a href=""http://www.tmitg.com/summer/lj/nearlylaughing.mov"">a video of almost laughter</a>.

In other news, Roger went back to work yesterday and it's been a little strange not having him around. I know he misses not being here with us too. I have six more weeks of leave, then it's back to reality for me as well. It breaks my heart to think about going back to work and leaving this little one behind. I really didn't realize I would feel like this before she was born. There's just no way anyone can tell you that you can understand how you will feel. It keeps me up at night and I hate it. I just have to enjoy the time we do have together all the more. 

On the growing front, I'm happy to report that Emmaline has just about doubled her birth weight - at least according to our bathroom scale. She's not quite as tubby and rolly polly as other babies I've seen. She does have some good little fat rolls on her, but she's really tall. She's wearing 6 month footy pj's because she outgrew her 3 month ones in height. The problem with most clothes that we have is that she's too tall for them, but width-wise, they are simply too big. It's an interesting problem to have. 

I broke out the sewing machine and I've been sewing her some clothes. So far I've made three pairs of pants, a dress and a jumper. I also ""made"" a wrap. I use quotes because all I did was measure, cut and serge the edges. We tried to take a picture of some stuff, but they didn't really come out. We'll get some good photos and I'll post them."

"event","Roger spoke of our cute clothing obsession the other day. I have to confess to some other addictions. The first is cloth diapers. Those mamas using disposables don't know what you're missing. There are some SUPER cute cloth diapers out there. Of course, you've seen her <a href=""http://gallery.me.com/sfrace#100078/P1010434&amp;bgcolor=black"">pirate diaper</a> and her <a href=""http://gallery.me.com/sfrace#100078/P1010560&amp;bgcolor=black"">cow diaper</a>. She's got some other cute prints and a whole rainbow of solids as well. It's so fun picking out diapers to match her little outfits and, of course, buying new cloth along the way. It's too much!<br /><br />I'm also developing a problem with baby wearing devices. We started with an <a href=""http://www.ergobabycarrier.com/"">Ergo baby carrier</a>. It's a nice carrier, but it didn't really meet our needs at this time. Next up, we got a padded ring sling (which I <a href=""http://gallery.me.com/sfrace#100078/P1010443&amp;bgcolor=black"">demonstrated</a> by carrying Emmaline while brushing my teeth).&nbsp;Well, that was fine, but having all her weight on one shoulder can get painful after awhile, plus she loves to be carried around facing out. So, we bought a Moby wrap. It takes a bit to get all the wrapping figured out, but it's so&nbsp;versatile&nbsp;once it's all worked out. I love it! And Emmaline can be facing in or out. It's so great! <br /><br />Action shot:<br /><br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/littlebabybat/pic/0000spr1/""><img width=""320"" height=""240"" border=""0"" alt="""" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/littlebabybat/pic/0000spr1/s320x240"" /></a><br /><br />Okay, but there's a problem with the Moby, it's a pain in the ass dealing with all that fabric when out and about. It drags all over the ground when you're putting it on so doing it in, say, a parking lot, doesn't work well. Solution? I&nbsp;bought a <a href=""http://www.becobabycarrier.com/store/proddetail.php?prod=anaya"">Beco Obi </a>online last night. It holds her like a Moby, but without all the wrapping.<br /><br />I also want a <a href=""http://www.babyhawk.com/"">Baby Hawk</a>. I&nbsp;really have no reason to want a Baby Hawk, but it looks like yet another good option for us. Plus it comes in all sorts of cool patterns like <a href=""http://www.babyhawk.com/ProductDetail.aspx?ProductGroup_ID=1517"">skulls</a> and such! :)<br /><br />The good news is that all of these (with the exception of the Ergo) we bought either used or on sale so we're not breaking the bank.&nbsp;And Emmaline really loves being carried so finding the perfect carrier really is worth it (for our backs and her comfort).&nbsp;"

"event","Emmaline has TONS of cute clothes thanks to the generosity of friends and co-workers. However, this does not seem to prevent us from buying even more when we're out at the store, sometimes even buying things that won't fit her for 2-3 years.

<b>Cute temptation #1: polka dots or stripes.</b> The first thing that came home was a little black dress with pink and white polka dots from Marshalls, size 3T. Last night at Kohl's I found a black hoodie with white skull-n-crossbones (with pink hairbow) all over it, size S4 (not sure what that means, actually). Today we showed resistance at Old Navy, though, with a black sweatervest with hot pink contrasting edges, kicker being the little logo over the heart was a skull-n-crossbones (with hairbow), size XS(5). There was also a super cute knit dress with big hot pink and black stripes and white collar/cuffs, also XS(5). There was, however, a storewide baby stuff sale and a kickin' halloween section (or year-'round by our standards).

<b>Cute temptation #2: kitty, skull-n-crossbones or rock-n-roll prints.</b> Not too much more to say here. In the clearance section at Old Navy we found some <a href=""http://www.oldnavy.com/browse/product.do?cid=38586&pid=612347&scid=612347022"">pink onesies with kitties on them</a>, and another with silver-printed ""Rock Star"" on it. Or <a href=""http://www.oldnavy.com/browse/product.do?cid=38584&pid=581664&scid=581664022"">this one</a> with a neat silver print on it.

<b>Cute temptation #3: stuff that's supposed to be for Halloween.</b> We originally went to Old Navy to check out a <a href=""http://www.oldnavy.com/browse/product.do?cid=37425&pid=581594"">bat costume</a> we'd found online. Makes sense since her original nickname was ""Little Baby Bat."" However, we then spotted an even more perfect Halloween costume: <a href=""http://www.oldnavy.com/browse/product.do?cid=37425&pid=581593"">ninja!</a> Of course, we were already in the halloween section, so we also picked up <a href=""http://www.oldnavy.com/browse/product.do?cid=37426&pid=581736&scid=581736012"">this</a>, and <a href=""http://www.oldnavy.com/browse/product.do?cid=37426&pid=581736&scid=581736022"">this</a>, and <a href=""http://www.oldnavy.com/browse/product.do?cid=37426&pid=600616"">this</a> (and the <a href=""http://www.oldnavy.com/browse/product.do?cid=37426&pid=581738&scid=581738052"">matching socks</a>). Year-'round appropriate, for sure. Oh, we already had a purple Frankenstein onesie from Marshalls we found a few weeks ago.

"event","Emmaline turned 2 months old this week. On Wednesday we went to the pediatrician for her well-baby checkup. She weighed 10 lbs. 10.5 oz, which is 48th percentile and she is 23 inches long which is 68th percentile. I'm not sure if those percentiles are using the growth charts for breastfed babies - I'd like to think so. She's definitely caught up in terms of her weight. At her one month visit she was around the 20th percentile.<br /><br />This week my friend Tesa visited from Portland. Tesa and I met in college and we've been great friends ever since. She was the maid of honor at our <a href=""http://tmitg.com/wedding"">wedding</a>. We haven't seen her in years and it was great to catch up and spend the week together.<br /><br />Emmaline continues to be more and more interactive, which is really fun. She's also somewhat easier to soothe when she's upset or fussy. Lately I've been singing to her a lot and she really seems to love it. I mostly sing Mirabilis songs to her because they either are already a capella or work well that way. I need some new songs though because there's only so many times I can sing the same songs before I go a little crazy (and take Roger with me).&nbsp;<br /><br />Otherwise, she's as cute as ever and we adore her. Going back to work is going to be seriously difficult - for both of us. Luckily I&nbsp;don't have to go back until November.&nbsp;Roger's back to work date at the end of September is a little closer. We're trying not to think about it.&nbsp;<br /><br />Here's a new photo of Emmaline and her Daddy taking a nap together. I love the little cow print diaper she's wearing. Oh yah,&nbsp;I should mention cloth diapering is going great. It's actually easier than I thought it would be. We love putting her in cute diapers that match her outfits. :)<br /><br /><img width=""384"" height=""512"" alt="""" src=""http://gallery.mac.com/sfrace/100078/P1010560/web.jpg"" /><br type=""_moz"" />"

I've added some new photos to <a href=""http://gallery.me.com/sfrace/100078"">the gallery</a>. We've been trying some new clothes she received as gifts. Of course, I've been taking pictures of her so I can send the gift-givers photos of her in the items.

"event","Emmaline turned 6 weeks old on Friday and she now weighs over 9 lbs. People still comment on what a tiny baby she is. To us she looks so much bigger than when she was newborn so she doesn't seem that tiny any more! 

In the past week, in addition to her weight growth, she's made huge developmental leaps. She follows us with her eyes and the really big news is that she started smiling. In fact, this morning, she smiled at me three times! It's very exciting (and, of course, cute). She has also begun making some gurgling and cooing type noises. She's also developing physically. She has quite a lot of head control and can push herself up when she's on her belly. She also has really strong legs and can even stand a little bit if held steady. I guess all that ninja training is paying off! 

She's super great at night. She sleeps in 2-4 hour stretches. When she wakes, we change and feed her and she conks right back out again. So we're only up for 15-20 minute stretches of time. She generally does this from around 9-10 at night to around 9-10 in the morning. 

During the day, she's a bit more of a handful. I have dubbed it the ""Short Attention Span Theatre."" I wouldn't necessarily call her a fussy baby, but when she's awake and she's not nursing, it's very hard to keep her from crying. 

We're constantly having to keep her in motion or otherwise occupied. Riding in the car, holding her in the glider, walking around with her in a sling, putting her in her bouncer, etc.  Her favorite activity is being held (in arms or in a sling) while on a yoga ball bouncing. I swear, I've spent more time on that damn yoga ball in the last few weeks than I care to count. Sometimes she'll look at her mobile or just chill out in her sling without movement, but that's literally for 10-15 minutes, then she's crying again. 

Unfortunately sometimes nothing works. She just cries. We've made sure she isn't overstimulated and tried white noise, a dark room, a lullaby. Sometimes it will work, but again, only for 10-15 minutes then she's crying again and we're figuring out something else that will keep her attention. Sometimes she just needs to suck, but she'll refuse the breast (I suspect because milk comes out and she's not hungry) so our pinky fingers go pruny from the sucking (she refuses pacifiers - we've tried 5 different kinds).

So I guess at times during the day, she's a bit difficult, but we manage to keep her entertained for the most part."

We found the name ""Emmaline"" when we were scouring baby name websites looking for the perfect name. We found it and it just seemed perfect. We pronounce it Emma-leen. (Rhymes with Christine.)

Her middle name, Elura, is a family name on my maternal grandfather's side. It was his mother's middle name and his grandmother's first name. I've always liked the name and we considered it for a first name as well. It's pronounced Eh-loo-rah.

"event","Yesterday Emmaline turned 3 weeks old. My mom is here and we've been getting out of the house a bit more lately. I just make sure I feed her and she's asleep before we go anywhere and then she pretty much stays conked out wherever we go. She's really a pretty mellow baby. She has fussy moments now and then, but they don't last too long (no more than and hour or two every couple of days). 

She's gotten a lot bigger. She's over 7 pounds now and fits into a lot more of her clothes, which is great! I think we've mostly worked out the breastfeeding issues. I did end up seeing a lactation consultant this week because my nipples were really sore, but they're feeling much better now. They're still a little sore, but I definitely feel like we've turned a corner. I was worried we had a latch issue, but her latch is great so we didn't have to rework any of that. Whew!

Otherwise, there's not much else to report. She pretty much eats, sleeps, poops, and looks cute (she's really good at looking cute). In the last couple of days, she started to have slightly longer periods between feedings  (three hours as opposed to two) which is nice. Last night we were only up three times in the middle of the night. We went to sleep around midnight and then got up around 3, 4:30 and 6:40 before we got up around 9:30. A great night! Hopefully the trend will continue."

"event","Emmaline is two weeks old today. The last two weeks have definitely gone by more quickly than I anticipated that they would. It really seems like she was just born yesterday. She's definitely continuing to gain weight because she feels heavier when we pick her up. Her 0-3 month shirts are still pretty big, but they're a little better than they were. 

We had to order some smaller cloth diaper covers because the ones she had were too big. So we're happily in cloth now. The only issue now is that we didn't buy many newborn diapers because we weren't sure she'd need them in the first place and if she did, how long she'd need them.

She eats quite well and quite frequently. In fact, I'm sort of ready for her eating to space out a bit more. She's currently waking up to nurse every 1-2 hours. Sometimes she gives us a 3 hour stretch, but that's pretty rare. She doesn't really fuss or anything, but she definitely wants to eat frequently, which can be really draining (har har) for me. We have a little eat/poo log book and it has 10 slots for eating. On Wednesday she ate 18 times! My nipples are a bit sore still and it can take us a couple of tries to get her latched on, but otherwise, things are fine in the breastfeeding department. 

Last night we put her in her stroller and took her for a spin around the block, which was fun. She slept the whole time. Today we figured out how to stuff her in the Ergo baby carrier so we can carry her around. I'm definitely feeling a bit of cabin fever setting in and I'm itching to get out of the house and go somewhere. I'd really love to see the new Batman movie - maybe in a few weeks we can go to a Baby Day showing at the Alamo Drafthouse. In the meantime, I don't really know where I'd go - to the store or something I guess. Maybe in the next week or so we can venture out for a short outing. 

My healing is nearly complete and I'm up and around a lot now. I'm sure Roger feels better having some of the burden of all the cooking and housework taken off him. It was difficult feeling so beat up and having to depend on everybody. Thankfully we had some help from the doula the first week, then Roger's mom and her husband were here for five days and helped out a lot. Now we've pretty much got things figured out and other than being a little tired due to the interrupted sleep schedule (we sleep late and take naps), things are going smoothly."

The breastfeeding is going really well now. We've gotten most of the kinks out. While it isn't effortless, it's getting a lot easier. What a difference a week makes!

My healing is coming along. I went for a short walk today and it was nice. I only walked a little over a half mile (it took a long time) and felt pretty good. It was strange being away from my girl. Really, we've been together for so long, it's strange when I'm not with her.  While pregnancy wasn't easy, some part of me misses having her in there. I feel somehow...empty. I love having her out here better, but there was something about carrying her around with me - so close."

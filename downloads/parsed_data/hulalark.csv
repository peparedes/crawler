"event","Hello friends!!  I'm on spring break!!! It's all just so exciting.  Monday I worked a lot on my English Paper, and some other school stuff.  And yesterday I cleaned my car, inside and out.  It looks very nice now.  It was a much needed clean.  But it took me 2 hours to do it!  But since I was in my swim suit in mid day, I think I got a little tan!  Sweetness!  The rest of the day Sadie and I did scrapbooking!  It was so much fun, and I plan on doing more today.

This thursday night Karen and I are going to go to her aunts house right by the beach and stay till sunday!  I'm really excited!  We plan on surfing friday morning and sat morning.  Which is really the real reason I'm excited, seeing how I haven't even been all years!!  It's a sad world.  

I've been enjoying having most of my nephews around me.  They are all just so cute.  And little Owen is starting to pack on the pounds.  Now he is like a little rollie-pollie!!  So cute!  Sunday my family all came over and we painted some easter eggs.  We did it a little different, we put holes on the bottom and top, then you blow all the yoke out.  Which leaves us a perfect hollow egg!  Then they can last forever!  They turned out pretty cute, but mine broke when I was blowing the yoke out, so really mine was not all the perfect.  But it looked really cool with a hole on the side, and I'm going to put a little chick in there to make it even cuter!"

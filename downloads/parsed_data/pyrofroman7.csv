"event","i can remember the moment as af if it had just happened. i had just gotten home from my math tutor. i was in my parents room trying on my new soccer boots. fresh out the box and lookin good for the new high skool season. then my dad walks in and says. your not on the list. being on the team last year this was surely a joke. he looked at me again with a tear in his eye. i cant joke about this he said. we all stood there in silence, in shock, not beleiving what was just happening. all i could hear was marvelous 3 blaring on my stereo down the hall in my room. i didnt noe what to do. i was in shock. i had to see for myself. i took my new boots off, set them down and slowly trodded down to the computer. i looked. 61, blank, 63, 64, 65. where was 62? i was 62. still in disbelief i walked up the stairs where my dad greeted me. he said i love you son. then we hugged for a minute or two in disbelief. the first thing i did was who did i tell? so i called steven sizemore. he would noe. but noe answer. so i called bryce. i told him i didnt make the squad. he said that that was messed up. i couldnt a gree more. then i broke into tears remembering the fun that i had had on the squad the year before. i sat there crying on the phone. he said hed let me go. then jon(kenny g) called in on the other line. i was still crying like a girl when he called. i didnt noe what he thought but when i stold him what happened he was in utter shock. he said something was wrong and that there was a mistake and wed talk 2 coach and it would be ok. then i called austin. he was as blown away as everyone else. i sat trying to figure out my math homework that i had just mastered. i had forgotten everything. just blank still in denial. i kept thinking what am i to do? steven called. i told him he said that i had to be joking. untill he looked for himself he didnt belive me. he said that he would come with me and jon to talk 2 coach in the morning. morning came. i got to skool early just like jon and steven said they would. but time passed and no show. the bell rang for class. i had 2 do this on my own. this was the hardest thing in my life. i walked down the locker room hall and saw carpenter walking with gassman. my heart had to have skipped a beat. i said coach i didnt make it did i? he said no. i said can we talk he said sure. so we stepped in to his office. his comments were that i was a good kid and a good player. he said that this year was the hardest job of cuts he had ever made. he said that compared to the other sophomores i lacked skill that they had. he said the freshmen were too good and that i would just sit on the bench. i thought how could i got from starter last year to nothing? he said it may hurt now but itll be better than sitting. i said thanks and left in pure sadness. i was going to be sick. i called my dad and he came and checked me out of skool. i dont want to be seen at skool. im a discgrace to myself. id rather not even talk about this horrible moment in my my. collins hill meant the world to me soccer meant the world to me. my dreams were shattered in an instant. and it hurts so bad knowing that i could have done something about it. the people who made the team this year were the same people i play with at club soccer. my skill is just as good as theirs. yes some are better but im not a push over. i have skill. and i had dreams. but they are gone. and i dont noe what it will take to get them back. soccer was life for me. i didnt noe any other way and other choice. i wanted to live it. i wanted to keep the legacy going and feel like a part of something. but now all i have to look foreward to is sitting in the stands cheering my friends on as they play for what i wanted to. i told steven if he took my old #7 i would be honored. you dont noe what that number means to me. i have been number 7 all my life. my dream was to play soccer professionally. but now all of that is going away and it hurts sooooo much you dont even undertand. i am going to miss my passion so much. sometimes dreams dont come true."

His ear lobe fell in the deep
Someone reached in and grabbed it
It was a rock lobster

We were at the beach
Everybody had matching towels
Somebody went under a dock
And there they saw a rock
It wasn't a rock
It was a rock lobster

Motion in the ocean
His air hose broke
Lots of trouble
Lots of bubble
He was in a jam
S'in a giant clam

Down, down

Underneath the waves
Mermaids wavin'
Wavin' to mermen
Wavin' sea fans
Sea horses sailin'
Dolphins wailin'

Red snappers snappin'
Clam shells clappin'
Muscles flexin'
Flippers flippin'

Down, down

Let's rock!

Boy's in bikinis
Girls in surfboards
Everybody's rockin'
Everybody's fruggin'

Twistin' 'round the fire
Havin' fun
Bakin' potatoes
Bakin' in the sun

I watched the smoke, as it grew darker and blew up through the ruff
I watched the fed, saw them panic, as the fire grew
I saw virginia, get rid of langley, and its secrets too
I held your hand, and sat there knowing, that we would make it through

I saw this man dispose of hunger and soap operas too
I saw this field, that grew perfection fall of things you do
I saw this box, get rid of heartache and cure cancer too
when i awoke i sat there hoping, this is what we'll do

If we can, we will leave a letter and this song for you
And we'll write once a day and put it through the sea to you
We'll regret all those things we thought of but didn't ever do

If we can we will leave a letter and this song for you
And we'll write once a day and put it through the sea to you

When the sky seems to clear who will then be left but of you and me and you
 

I am lost in the crowd
I'm standing in line
I'm feeling so down
And I am full of doubt
She's not the one that noticed
Hear me out

And I want her, need her
And you always will pull me through

I'm tired
This games so dumb
She never played, her races won
I'm tired
Can't smile no more
I've sure caved in just like before

And I want her, need her
And you always will pull me through
And I want her, need her
And you always will pull me through

I want her, need her
And you always will pull me through
And I want her, need her
And you always will pull me through
And I want her, need her
And I want her, need her
And I want her, need her
And I, And I, And I

our days are running thin
our hops will start to fall
i can feel the world collapse around me from within
and the letters keep coming by to let us know when time will die
and please god will you forgive us and give us one more try

if you will then we'll go as fast as we go far
maybe well be forgotten when the world is torn apart

i've been up all night long
counting days that all went wrong
i opened my bedroom window
i wish this pain was gone
there are no useful drugs to escape from feeling numb
i remember an amazing birthday
i remember when i was young

if you will then we'll go as fast as we go far
maybe we'll be forgotten when the world is torn apart
'cause the sun won't be so blinding
and the rains will finally come
the axis will slowly pile up just to prove we're finally done

this vacation's useless
these white pills aren't kind
i've given a lot of thought on this 13-hour drive
i missed the grinding concrete where we sat past 8 or 9
and slowly finished laughing in the glow of our headlights
i've given a lot of thought to the nights we use to have
the days have come and gone
our lives when but so fast
i faintly remember breathing on your bedroom floor
where i laid and told you but you sweared you loved me more

do you care if i don't know what to say
will you sleep tonight or will you think of me
will i shake this off pretend its all okay
that there someone out there who feels just like me
there is

those notes you wrote me
i've kept them all
i'll give a lot of thought of how to write you back this fall
with every single letter in every single word there
will be a hidden message about a boy that's
loves a girl
do you care if i don't know what to say
will you sleep tonight or will you think of me
will i shake this off
pretend its all okay

Lies - And you fill their souls
With all oppressions of this world
And all the glory you receive
So, What makes you supreme?
Lies - and your crown is falling
I offer fantasy
And you, Creator, 
Blind with envy

So let the children come to me
Their mother loves me, so shall they
Woman, bleeding, ate my gifts
Man was close behind
Just like a snake I'm slithering
Thru my world divine
And like the cat I'm stalking
I'll take your soul and You'll
Be like me
In emptiness, free

Just bow to me faithfully
Bow to me splendidly

if u dont like it im sorry its the real me and ull have 2 accept it. o ya alyssa cant wait 4 deutschland! b.y.o.c. yessss. hah! love u kiddo! well im gone.....

"event","yo people. havent written in here in like a few days so i figured id sit and put some junk in here. lets see.... this week ive been at soccer camp. its actually kinda fun. or at least today cuz we did shooting drills. matt u missed the good session. i thought the people on the ""A"" team were fags but i was wrong they actually rnt half bad. nice guys. and the people on the u-17 team theyre kool kidz 2. yea lets see me n matt went 2 leslies house yesterday. he met his woman thurr and we hung out and watched the ring. that movie blows. it said at the begining how it was the best horror movie of the year. i was like wow. thats pathetic then. a movie rated pg-13 isnt a good horror movie. or thats my opinion at least. well today i was up late till like 5. i stayed up talkin 2 jessica and brit. kool chicks. well then i was hungry so i ate again. i eat so much im surprised im not 300 pounds man its crazy. well then i watched iron chef. that show is tight cuz like they have a iron chef and a challenger. and this dude that looks like hes in pokemon comes out and hes like ching chang er sumthin. it in japanese and they dub it in english so its even cooler then. so then hes like ull be cooking with _____ (insert some gross animal that u would never want 2 eat) so then they like make wierd stuff in an hour and yes its on at 3 a.m. food network. watch and enjoy! then this weekend i dunno what im gonna do. hopefully go 2 jessicas bday party on saturday and then 2 maxs on sunday. so i can see brit b4 summers over. then next week nothing anyone who want 2 do sumthin calllllll meeeee!!!!! well thats it 4 now. peace!

The rise and fall of my sloppy love, The smatterings, and splatterings, 
They'll get you. 
I'm not the one you were thinking of, 
Maybe you thought I'd call, Instead of crashing down your hall. 
Hold me down, but I'll find out. 
You know you will never get what you need, 
Blue Diamond strike 'em anywhere, 
First we caffeinate, then incinerate, 
We'll get you. 
And sparks will fly in the summer air, 
Did you pull out of your stall, 
Maybe I'll see you after all. 
Say we don't. Know who we are. We say no, 
I live my life like the burning man, 
Like a burning man, 
Like a burning man, 
And I won't get enough 'Till my legs are broken, 
The stars they shine. In an empty void. 
Life is not to fear, life is to enjoy, 
He'll get you. 
Mr. Death catches all someday. 
Baby I thought you'd call. 
Or leave a light on in the hall, 
Hold me down, But I'll find out. We say no, 
I live my life like a burning man, 
And I won't get enough, 
till my legs are broken. 


I wish you would step back from that ledge my friend, 
You could cut ties with all the lies, that you've been living in, 
And if you do not want to see me again, I would understand. 
I would understand, 
The angry boy, a bit too insane, 
Icing over a secret pain, 
You know you don't belong, 
You're the first to fight, You're way too loud, 
You're the flash of light, On a burial shroud, 
I know something's wrong, 
Well everyone I know has got a reason, To say, put the past away, 
I wish you would step back from that ledge my friend, 
You could cut ties with all the lies, That you've been living in, 
And if you do not want to see me again, I would understand, 
I would understand. 
Well he's on the table, And he's gone to code, 
And I do not think anyone knows, 
What they are doing here, 
And your friends have left, You've been dismissed, 
I never thought it would come to this, And I, I want you to know, 
Everyone's got to face down the demons, 
Maybe today, We can put the past away, 
I wish you would step back from that ledge my friend, 
You could cut ties with all the lies, that you've been living in, 
And if you do not want to see me again, I would understand, 
I would understand, 
I would understand... 
Can you put the past away, I wish you would step back from that ledge my friend, 
I would understand... 

             ^^^^^this one is 4 u brit. ^^^^^


I'm only pretty sure that I can't take anymore, 
Before you take a swing, I wonder What are we fighting for, 
When I say out loud, I want to get out of this, I wonder, 
Is there anything I'm going to miss, 
How's it going to be, When you don't know me, 
How's it going to be, When you're sure I'm not there, 
How's it going to be, When there is no one there to talk to about, 
How it's going to be, 'Cause I don't care, 
How's it going to be, 
Where we used to laugh, There's a shouting match, 
Sharp as a thumbnail scratch, 
A silence I can't ignore, 
Like . . The hammocks and the doorways we spent time in, Swing empty, 
don't see lightning like last fall when it was always about to hit me, 
I guess that is how it's going to be 
How's it going to be 
When you don't know me, any more 
How's it going to be 
Want to get myself back in again, 
The soft dive of oblivion. 
Want to taste the salt of your skin 
The soft dive of oblivion 
       
         ~forgive and forget or you will regret~
dude i made that up that fuckin rox!

I'm on a train, but there's no one at the helm, 
And there's a demon in my brain starts to overwhelm, 
And there it goes, my last chance for peace, 
I lay me down, but I get no release, 
I try to keep awake, I try to swim beneath, 
But still I find this narcolepsy slides, 
Into another nightmare. 
And there's a demon in my head who starts to play, 
A nightmare tape loop of what went wrong yesterday, 
And I hold my breath 'till it's more than I can take, 
And I close my eyes and dream that I'm awake, 
I try to keep awake, 
I try to keep awake, 
But still I find this Narcolepsy slides, into another nightmare. 
I read dead Russian authors, Volumes at a time, 
I write everything down except what's on my mind, 
Cause my greatest fear is that sucking sound, 
And then I know that I will neer get back out, 
And there's a bone in my hand that connects to a drink, 
In a crowded room where the glasses clink, 
And I'll buy you a beer and we'll drink it deep, 
Because that keeps me from felling asleep, 
How'd you like to be alone and drowning, 
How'd you like to be alone and drowning, 
How'd you like to be alone and drowning, 
Still I find this narcolepsy slide slide slides, Into another nightmare, 
Keep awake. Keep awake, Keep awake, 
Still I find this narcolepsy slides...

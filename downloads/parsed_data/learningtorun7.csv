"event","Well I have truly came to revelations, i'm evil, i love God, and i love people.  ^___^ Well will all be good.  I am also angry with God in some ways, or should i say confused and upset.  If i was striaight i know where i would be, married, probably living in california and maybe even with kids (don't know about the last one)  But i'm not straight i don't think, maybe i just havn't meet the right person yet to be with me and God.  Esh i'm being confusing ^_^ but anyway, I know and hold to one thing right now.  I love God and i want his love i want his approval,  I want Him in my life and to totally encompass, engulf, and drownd me in him.  I am going to try and focus on him for the rest of the weekend if i can keep from being destracted,  i need him.  I went to bed with a fever last night maybe that is where the evil rant came from but some of it was me and just feelings.   Well i'm going now to work that is I love you all, and i mean that *hugs* to everyone whether you like me or not ^_-

be good"

"event","This is a warning i am ranting to random nothingness k, k  and if you read this don't use it against me or for me or whatever it is pure emotion which i should not be running by right now but i am been taking hydroxycut to help loose some weight, so natually i'm depressed now.  But i'm okay just ranting not that this is gonna be read ^_^ buy hey i don't care, typing it will help me and i can't call anyone that i can bitch too cause i care too much about them.  I am tired of everything.  I havn't heard from God in probably two months now.  And for those of you that havn't seen that part of me i used to be close to him and could actually ocassionally hear his voice i think.  The last thing i heard from him was simply ""because"" And it pissed me of, i'v yelled, cursed, and cried because of it.  I know it is what he wants but do i have to like it no i don't but i do accept it and struggle with the meaning of that every day sometimes everysecond.  I need to get into shape, if i could trade a slice of my soul i think i would but i can't.  cause it doesn't belong to me anymore.  I have actually been trying to spend time and focus on God but it just seems like everythime i do i let myself get destracted, i have an amazing imagination and create conversations and stories in my head and when i try to spend time with him that goes into overdrive ^___^ althoug i have came up with some wierd stuff cause of it.  I feel very seperated from him, i want to cry.  But i'm not gonna yet.  And i want to run away in the wood and if i could have gotten out of work today nobody would see me for a while (gotta get in touch with an old friend to get a tent though i'm gonna see if i can find him tomorrow to get it so i can disappear this weekend for a long time).  I want Gods attention again, i'm like a child throwing a temper tantrum and i know it, mine has just been a very long one.  And a large part of me doesn't care doesn't want to care about it any more But i know i need God or i'm just gonna become a slut. i'm already evil (revelation i reached today, i really am) and i dont' want to be an evil slut, i just don't like that idea.  (humor there i mean it, except about the evil part yeah that was true).  I have gotten rid of all the porn everything bad even my family guy movies (i'm slightly adicted to them lately and i don't need that distraction more time for the gym)  And i don't want to care about people anymore and i don't want them to care about me..... but just cause i want it doens't me it is gonna happen, one thing i do know by now God isn't gonna let me give up on loving and caring for people. Damn him..............................FUCK.   Esh, maybe cancer would be quicker.  okay i'm going to bed now that i have cursed god Damnit i'm sorry i didn't mean it *cries*......................................................"

The thought before i went to bed of losing a friendship sent my heart to racing and actually put me to being very very afraid for a time.  I know everything is in the hand's of God but still i am unknowing and it scares the shit out of me losing this.  I like chanted to myself last night ""all things work for the good of those that love God"" and that is true, but it don't mean life still aint' shit sometimes.  The good doesn't necessaraly come until we get home then there will be tons of good and God which will be awesome.  God is God and his will is good.  I just don't agree with Him a good portion of the time.  And his answer to one of my prayers is still because, and it is starting to annoy me because i don't want it. and he knows i don't (trust me on that) but yet he still leaves these things on/for me.  once again i just guess i will have to trust the lord of the universe, since father does know best (yeah right) damnit i type it then feel guilty for it.  esh.  i'm giving up cause i gots work to do.

Why do i always fall in love with what i can't have?  Esh, i just got back from walking into the kitchen and i feel drunker than i have felt in a long long time, i had trouble walking striaght, maybe it's carbon monoxide poinsoning or something,  see it is even affecting how i'm thinking.  I've been chasing a dream that i don't think i can have and that i don't think cares for me anymore.  It was pointed out to me that i hadn't updated this so i update now ^_^ and of course i'm feeling really really weird when i do,  no more for me.  The trip to asheville in the last mentioned journal was lots of fun but no sex with the hottie i was rooming with T_T oh well, probably a good thing cause i actually like him.  I say that like i want to.  Part of me does cause he is a very cute, very sweet, awesome guy.  But at the same time i don't want to cause i want to save it for something very very special ummmm marriage yeah thats it.  I don't want to have sex again till i'm married no matter how much i might want to.  oh back to ashville, it was uber fun ^_^  we went shopping at the farmers market, the mall and downtown all of which was cool, and we ate at a german resteraunt that was awesome the first time I ate sourcrought (ignore my spelling or i will bite you).  and right now i can't remember all that we did, i just know that i had an awesome time with a person that is a great friend and is special to me.  I have spent a lot of time with him over the past few weeks, we will see where God leads it to go if i let him lead it and not me cause i think i'm trying to lead it i don't know.  Esh, ummmmmm i feel really wierd and should i not make it throught this night cause i don't know why i feel this was cause i really do feel like i've had 5 or 6 shots of taquelia right now. and i havn't O_O i'm having trouble focusing on the screen adn thinking right.  Well who ever reads this and there are only two people who might and i want you botht to know i lvoe you.  and ummm if i do live throught this night lets just sayh the alcohol content on teh smirnoff was way mor that 5% okay cause yeah i am really feeling all drunk. ummm enebriated. thats the word.  I don't kow right now if i can stand up and make it to my bed i might just sleep on the couch taht i'm on right now.  oh back to my update life is cool, i have a boy i like and that likes me that is always good and fun right ^_^ i've just always hurt people that like me and i soooo don't want to hurt him.  Cause if i hurt him i'm gonna be really really upset with me >.<  umm and i went to charlotte pride this past saturday it was awesome, i got soooo nervous the first few steps in teh festival that i almost fell, my knees almost gave out.  You know i hate me, i want to get hit on by lots of guys but i don't i need to get into shape, not that i want lots of guys i'm happy with what i have very very happy.  i just want to be better, i want to be good to be with who i'm with, i'm making no sense, blame it on the crazzy ness of me feeling right now.  But it was fun there lots of hot guys and there was a guy with the HRC taking up money taht he talked to me and nikole and when he talked to me he looked me in the eyes and keept eye contact and omg all i can say there was something about him adn his eyes esh probably the only guy that almost made me melt.  and he wasn't that hot, cute but not hot hot.  esh i don't know i think by his eyes that he was a christain.  esh.  i should just give up but pride was fun lots of fun i went with nikole, and her exgirlfriend mellisssa and they are both crazy bi sexual girls ^_^ with a prference for hot guys and ladies 
so it was all cool and fun and great and good.
and i went on my first officeial date ever yesterday ^_^ with a really hot young guy ^_^ he is sooo cool and i'm such a houch but we will leave it at that and say no sex occured but it was an awesome date, we watched movie (kill bill vol 1) and went out to eat and watched a movie at teh theaters (house of wax) and hung out for a while after that it was awesome.

"event","I went to the mcc in charlotte  Great church, good people and most 90 percent are gay......  And i realize something now,  I am afriad of the gay community.  Gay people scare me.  I think it is because I have always been involded with straights and very little involvement in the gay community up until recently.  It is because i never had to worry about the ""straights""  they were friends but could never be more than that in my life.  These people could be more, they can actually relate to me.  And if they don't like me then i am stuck with the straight people ( i think i have a complex)  there are only two or three gay/bi people that don't bother me or make me uncomfortable.  And it is nothing about the people at all just they are like me O_O sorta and it's weird. I am working through it with the hand of God I hope.  Just randomness of me ^_^.  But the church meeting was awesome ^_^ the prayers were great.  A really good experience last night.  And i do love the people that i have met there and i am becoming much more comfortable in the community as i keep walking.  And I shall become very comfortable with it.  You know though thinking of this I don't have these fears in the bars i've been too.  Maybe because i expect nothing at the bars, but here in the christian/gay community i want love from my brothers and sisters.  I am getting it but it will take time for me to adjust i think.  

It's all good, God is beyond good and extremly adorable ^_^.  YAY,  I'm going to ashville this weekend with a friend, i'm excited,  It will be lots of fun and a break from here.  Which will be good for me.  

AND I AM GOING TO CHARLOTTE PRIDE NEXT MONTH YAY YAY YAY.  I am determined to go so it should be mucho fun, lots of gay people and lots of fun and lots of excitement and creativity and things like that.  Maybe i can even have some friends to come with me ^_^

"event","Being gay is about sex, who we have sex with and who we lust after.  Being a christian is about loveing.  How do we combine the two things.  To love another man the way i want.  I don't need sex or even lust but a love deeper than i have.  I can love a man and never have sex with him and still be gay.  So is the first statement acurate.  I don't think it is.  I know the second one is accurate.  I think being gay is about a love that is deeper and fulling for a specific person that i don't think i could ever feel for a woman, i've tried and hard but it just isn't there for me.  All this comes about from thinking after watching the movie luster it combines love and lust into one thing that i think they are not.  I know they are not the same thing.  I want to love the man that i want to love, I want to spend my life living with him and giving him everything he wants, and i want to glorify God through all of it.  I don't want or need sex. Yes i desire it but i don't want it, it just seems like a burden too deep right now.  Maybe God will change that but i don't know.  I want Love, to love someone completly and without requirement, even if they don't love me back.  I do love.  Someone told me the other day that they didn't believe in love.  I can't even seem to comprehend that.  My whole being is about trying to love (i fail completly at it).  I want to be with my one true love and to attach this as always no matter who i want i want the one that God knows is right for me.  He knows me better than me.  

Part of me right now feels like giving up.  And i would but I love and feel that i have a responsibility to those i love.  So i can't give up yet.  

GOD be with you whoever you are.  I love you to even if i don't know you say hi, i'll give ya a hug ^_^

"event","I have really been thinking about abortion.  I do not approve of it in general especially any time that the fetus is actualy developed.  It will never be right in my eyes, but should people be able to do it if they want.  I guess we are a country that is supposed to be based on freedoms.  And thinking what is the differnce between abortion and using a condom with a woman, both are killing a possible life.  Hmmm maybe i should be catholic :).  Anyway,  back to the freedom issue.  I feel somewhat responsible for some abortions.  If we as christians were doing our jobs instead of trying to make laws to govern everyones life if we were preaching the gospel and loving like christ then maybe we wouldn't have to have ""laws"" like the jews of christ day did.  I feel that we especially me are such failures to Christ and God.  ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh brain freeze, eating frostie, ouch, i shouldn't be eating it but, i slip ocasionally.  Anyway moving on I need to move somewhere else, I know the roads around here way too good and driving them just isn't the same.  

And I was talking with one of my friend the other night and he told me that God would not bless any furture relationship I would want with another guy.  I know in my heart that God will bless me with another guy if he is a christian and loves God.  Ehhh right now I so want to spend the rest of my life with one guy.  We shall see where God goes with me and what He shows me in my future.  Waiting on Him for everything.  In love

"event","Half the week is over and I'm feeling good.  Well I now have a peace about the future, I know and accept that God is going to handle everything and that I will recieve what I need to keep going until I am called home.  So God has given me the strength to stand strong again and to face everything in my life that I need to.  YAY GOD.  I've been bad on my diet today, umm had to sodas, something i havn't had in over two months now I think and my stomach is regretting the carbonation.  Oh well, I still need to find a church, mayhaps God will lead me to one if that is where he wants me other wise I will take the advice of a friend and start listening to very filling sermons on my mp3 player or some such as that.  And by the last two post one would think i was a girl, the romance things, I took them because they said they had good pictures so I do have a defense.  Ignorance, that is it, ignorance.  I get paid next monday YAY, i got paid in the middle of december for this month so with christmas and everything the check has had to be streched really really thin.  But no more, I shall save money from now on no more wasting on frivolous things, that habit has been killed.   God is so good, I don't know why He is so nice to me but He is and I love him dearly.  But what to do now, I guess I shall take things one day at a time and walk where the path seems to be leading,  I just found out today that my sister probably will not move out until at least december, I don't know where she is plaing on staying, the lease runs out on the house in october and I'm gonna have to find a cheap apparment so I can save as much money as I can, I don't care where I live now, God will protect everything that needs protecting.  So I don't know what is going to happen with that, I don't like the idea of moving but I can't really save any money if I am holding up all the utilities and the 550 dollars a month in rent by myself, especially not with my car payment, i can make it but not save anything and I want to have money save if i ever chose to move somewhere else (japan maybe hehehehe) then I will have enough to do it.  Ehh That is just another thing to rely on God for, because I know he will provide.  Well I hope everyone is having a good day today, not like you even read this but if you did and finished it all God bless your loveing heart :),  Have a good one and Love you all.  Eddie"

I am terrified of the furture right now.  More what it will not hold for me than what it will hold.  You know it is weird, I could deal with losing my ability to walk (at least i think i could), my sight, my speach, pretty much anything, but one thing, I SHOULD NOT BE LIKE THIS.  I should be strong, independent, selfmotivated.  DAMNIT I am not I am failing.  I have never been anxious, never, but now i am, why must the future now scare me.  i would rather be called as a missionary to iraq right now than to face this unknowing.  Oh well Now that I know and understand a little better maybe i am going to be a little better equiped to deal with this (i dought it but i can hope).  Lord above forgive me for being such a selfish child.

No ubber happiness for me for a while, until God deams that it is time.  I sound soo depressing, really i'm not, i;m a very happy and energetic person.

I feel lost in so many ways, I am just having to rely on the fact that He is going to lead everything in the way it needs to go.  Because I have no clue anymore.  My life has been turned around recently and I am not sure what I am going to do.  I think my goal (because i need a goal, i'm soo tired of being where i am at and not moving forward with life and with God, not that where i am at is bad, it's just stagnant.) shall become totaly japan, and to learn more of the people and things there off so I can integreate into the culture better should God chose to allow me to go for Him.  But until I start to move I am here and shall remail here until a time as I see fit for a reason to move.  Which hopefully will come sooner than later, i'm growing to really dislike stanly county and the people here.  Way too many guys named buba :), If your name if buba i have nothing against you.  I love you too *big hug and kiss*.  Anyway.  I shall wait on God as hard as that is, I have no choice and I'm not sure what He shall say or do for a few questions I have before him.  Oh and still waiting on the pastor to give me a call so i can get my talking too from him.  Poor guy i sorta feel sorry for him.  Other than that today is being an awesomly boring day other than trading a few emails with friends.  That has been about the hightlight of the day.  and the fact that I lost a phone cable here at work, wher in the hell I put a 50 foot phone cable that we cant find it i'm not sure, but that is my mission right now to find it.  See how hard my job is.  :),  Have a good one and God bless and I hope he gives you a really big kiss.

I am going to try and get out this weekend and take some pictures in the uwharries if the weather will allow, It all depends on how wet it gets with our freezeing rain here that is supposed to come tomorrow.  But if it is that cold i can probably get some good pictures, we shall see.  Umm allen has decided he shall keep me as a friend, Yay, i think, and umm i'm getting alot of attention at church, I think i should wear a gay pride t shirt or something when I go to my young adults saturday night.. really freak them out.  But i will never do that I am way too nice and well i don't have anyone with me to do it with.  After last saturday getting a talking to by Chris which was very good and love filled, and I now know not to have sex with condoms because they are not 100% effective.  :),  I love people,  Dina (the leader of young adults) aimed me this week and asked would i mind if pastor paul talked with me and of course me being the really nice guy that I am told her yes he could talk to me so probably after church or sometime he is going to pull me aside and give me a grand speach about how i'm going to hell or some such as that.  You know very christ like (sarcasm).  I expect to probably get like disfelloshiped or something next because even as nice as i am i can't stand there and agree with everything that i will be told.   And First Assembly does not like decention in any way, they deal with it as quickly as they can, you know normal loveing open christian church way.  Okay i'm being real mean to christians right now, sorry guys and gals that are but so many of us are just people that can hate so vehemently, oh well.  Moving on, my depression that i have been dealing with this week is almost gone.  So as long as nothing bad happen I shall be great and if something bad happens oh well i shall deal and move on as always.  God bless everyone and I love you all."

"event","Well everything is going pretty good, life in general for me recently has been good.  One of the main reasons is that God has put someone in my life that I care deeply about.  I have no idea where God wants it to go although i have a good idea where i want it to go but we shall see.  
I went to young adults at first assembly last night and it was okay.  Found out one of my friends parents are going to be on what not to wear sometime this summer.  Umm I got a talking too at church hehehehehe and i will probably get several more before it is over with they love me and just don't have any idea what to do with a gay christian, it confuses and scares them.  The gentle man that gave me the talking too just wanted really to show that they do love me and one of his big things was how dangerous sex is how many diseases i could get and about aids.  He seemed to be openminded about the fact that God might be able to bless a relation ship between two men but he wasn't sure, he is going to try and research it. So we shall see what he comes up with.  He also asked me if i would be willing to talk to the senior pastor and i told him no. The big reason being I do not agree with our senior pastors motives for things,  he seems to be a really nice caring man but his motivation does not seem to be Christ, God, or even the Kingdom of God first.  His primary objective seems to be making fa (first assembly) the most prestigeous and most well recongnized church possible so ex.  if you thing of first you think of the way a church should be a high standing moral body with no sinners in attendance but growing the kingdom of god in leaps and bound but no sinners allowed and if you do sin make sure that you keep it hidden otherwise you might end up on the gossip chain (prayer list) all in a good effort to help you.  OK i'm done with that back to young adults, the poeple at ya are really sorta nice other than my ex-best friend and well he is still nice just doesn't seem to like to talk to me to much just chit chat is sorta okay but never anything more.  Oh well, I was also told that I might not be able to bring a very close friend of mine (heheh maybe more) to young adults because if it got back to the senior pastor that a gay man (me) brought another gay man (him) to church that he (senior pastor bob) might close down young adult what in the **** **** do they think they are thinking, even if they see it as a sin ummm shouldn't sinner be allowed in church or has christ changed sooo much.  All sin is the same in the eyes of God so ummm all those people that look at something and want it well they can't come, oh don't look at that girl like that you can't come, errrrrrrrrr what in the world the church would be completly empty.  But they don't look at it like that I am by my existence an assault on there morals on there lives as a christian on there holy existence, you know christ would never have turned me or my friend away, right or wrong he would have loved us and hugged us and kissed us and let us wash his feet and let us praise God with him.  Soo differnt then him are his children today, including myself we are all bigots, liers, thiefs, murderers, umm sinners and yet some how he still loves us.  I just keep going don't I.


Enough about church, life is borring, except for the highlights of email and talking with someone very special to me on aim and then the occasional phone call that just melts me.  anyway moving on.  I want to go out and take some pictures, i borrow the digi cam from work so i gotta do something with it.  Well enough of this right now or i will never stop typing,

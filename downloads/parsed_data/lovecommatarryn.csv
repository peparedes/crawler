"event","Thank God for Youtube, since I got to see the episode.

Of course I must speak of the almost hug. Casey wants a hug and Derek shakes her hand instead.

I found this incredibly dasey-esque. I mean, all the times Derek takes every oppurtunity to touch Casey, and when it's out in the open he shirks away. He's so shy. And did anyone else note the hurt look on Casey's face when Derek didn't hug her? Because she WANTED TO HUG HIM!&nbsp;

Definite Dasey!"

"event","Okay, so we've all pined away, poking at any possible sign that Casey and Derek even remotely got along -because then that totally meant that their views of each other were changing..lol- replaying clips, and watching fanvids; reading fanfiction. None of us ever really wanted to let the relentless words of the Non-Dasey shippers get to us. -<em>Omg, Dasey is so never going to happen. Get over it. Like, ew, it's incest. They'd never show it on Disney.- Blah, blah, blah.</em> But deep in our hearts we wondered if it really was impossible, even though we would never stop shipping.<br /><br />But I must say, it's becoming clearer that Dasey is almost positive to happen. I mean, everything that's been going on with the show. Casey and Derek; the commercials, the pictures, the Fanfiction Dasey podcase that is supposed to -hopefully-&nbsp; air in September, based off of <strong><u>Out of the Blue</u></strong> <strong>by degrassichick.</strong> It's gotta happen!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />..<br />..<br />..<br />I just wish it would happen sooooonnnneeerrr!!! *whines*<br /><br />Love, Tarryn"

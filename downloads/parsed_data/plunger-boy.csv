I saw Breaking Benjamin live.(yes they all needed their own sentence.)Oh and there was that one band ohh whats it called.......Oh thats right Evanescence. Seether was still my favorite though they effing covered Nirvana. Evanesence covered Korn. Three Days Grace was just awesome. I do believe I confused people with how I rocked out. Thats right PlungerBoy rocked out. I got 2 sweat wristbands, one of which Melissa has but it's cool.


     Oh and I have band news no not Philo band. My new ""Life Metal"" band is jamming sunday after church. We are still nameless. Oh and I haven't given up on younolongerexist either. I still want Dayne. We need some one who can sing.

     In other news you know all of these things are incrediblly great but you know what being the little pessimist that i am I still find things to be sad about. It's what I do. I won't bore anyone with details.

Me personlly, I am a very enlightened) person in fact I may be most on of the most enlightened people in my grade (not intelligent enlightened). Now my family and other people praise me for this and I don't really want it I am grateful for it but I don't want it. Being the way I am knowing the things I know is not something good I am just going on 15 dammit, and I worry about not finding a perosn to love the rest of my life. THat seems quite like a mid-life crisis. Am I gonna die at like 28? Another very concerning thing. NOw everyone knows I changed my life and everything. I went from breaking into a persons house to Being a very religous person like in two months. I did it for all the wrong reasons. I very much do not regret it, it was the best thing that I have ever done in my life. Noe of it was for me. Now this is something I feel obliged to tell everyone. JUST BECAUSE YOU HAVE FOUND JESUS DOES NOT MEAN LIFE IS EASY. In fact life gets a lot harder but just know that you walk with God makes the bad times all right. Another thing. IF ONE MORE PERSON TELLS ME TO STOP BEING SOMEONES FRIEND  BECAUSE THEY ARE A BAD PERSON I WILL SMACK YOU HARD!!!!! Someone not being a good person is so mch more of a reason to be there friend. Why because you are a good person they are a bad person, help them forgive them Jesus forgave you. You can forgive people. If you quit being a persons friend just because they did something bad you in turn are a worse person. I am done with rant now for how may past few days have been.

Well we got a II at state but its all right at least we won't get yelled at Stallsmith was smiling when we were done. The bus ride home was intersting to say the least. After the bus ride I talke to Jamie(Corey's sister) for like an hour. It was a very interesting chat. Today I went to the library for a while. Talked to Zach one of the coolest kids I know. Then I cam back home talked to Dani and Dayne on MSN for a while. Then called Geogre, who is the lead singer of our church band. I was invited to his house I went and man wasn't that interesting. I couldn't find my parents so i made an agreement with my grandmother who worries about me way to much. I love her though. We went over to George neigherbors house yet another pretty cool guy i know. Whoose name is Jeff but His nick name is Heffa. But any wasy while we were there My grandma called George's house and left an angry message because no one answered the phone. Then me an George played some Open Up of My Heart. Then I came home around 10:36 and now here I am. Wow this journal entry was like Tyler McKean size, but I am done now.

I know to much for my own good."

I have found the best way to do that is sourrond my self as much as my friends as possible. I have also found that I feel home anywhere but my house. Our phone is broke, and I only have comunication though MSN and my Mother is hogging the computer today even I after mowed the inch high grass. Things are beginning to look up. but i have to block out my very pessimistic point of veiw just about every positive thing i find in my life my brain comes back with something 3 times more negitive. I have the things to make Icons agian. I AM SO THE SOUND GUY FOR INTO THE WOODS!!!!!! It is awesome and compicated. I love it. That musical is great, and very complicated and there are some very talented people in Philo and I am very glad to work with them and know them. I am done.

  Well I am much better than last night I think that cry did me some good everyone should try it some time but it was weird; because I really felt so emotionally unstable I couldn't even open my Bible for strength. I just kept crying and crying, I was shaking really bad.

    Well I had a day more eventful than most saturdays. I stayed up to 4pm last night. I keep like taking brisk hours of sleep. But i finaly got up got up at like right before 1am and then I was making me breakfast and Zach Silvus came over we played GameCube for a while then we played some Promisance then went to the Library. After that I went to set building which was quit fun if i do say so my self, it was a lot of work though. After that I came home. I thought Zach was gonna stay at my house but he ending up staying at Jeff's house but mark my words i will get Zach to go to church with us someday.

Well I am done typing now.Except for this and signing it, and a P.S.

NOW IT'S UPDATE TIME
Well Corey expaned my meaning on life. In the Begining of the day I just thought it was simply death now think about this all give you some periods to run this over in your head form a concept......................................................................................................................well my concept was this you are here to test your to see if you go to heaven or hell well we only fill in all this stuff about friendship and other things friendship between two people is a very weak bond because it can besimply broken by a secret told to one person. Now in reality your ownly true friend is God why because you do many many things but will God forgive you yes why because Jesus' blood was shed on the cross and for that God will be our Friend forever. Now will your friend secret you told forgive possibly but ther is also a chance the, but God always will always. Well back to the Meaning of Life being death. Well Corey pointed out to me that this is very not true because you r goal is to follow the path to Heaven then take as many people on the way as possible which completely destroys everthing i just said about weak bonds in human friendship. and this i think is very very true. It is amazing how one idea can change a persons whole train of thought well iam done ranting on this hope that made since and please coment on this i want to hear your ideas
**********************************************************************************

It took me a year to get mediocre on the clarinet. I have a lot of thingd to think over lately but I won't tellany one for a while because that's how I work.


Well I read up on Deism and for people who don't know what it is defined as The belief, based solely on reason, in a God who created the universe and then abandoned it, assuming no control over life, exerting no influence on natural phenomena, and giving no supernatural revelation. They don't believe in the Bible they don't believe in Jesus. It was started by the gay Thomas Paine, another thing that disppoints me is one of the greats people to how I look up to Einstien was a Deist. I don't understand if God created the universe and he loved why would he leave it alone it's like God is an abondoning father. Well I am done talking about that for now.

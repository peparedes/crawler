Dinner before-hand or would you rather order chinese or something?  

Wow, that was pretty much the highest percentage of questions I've ever had in a post anywhere ever.  GO ME!"

It's really not fair you know. I'm enough of a fandom whore on my own, now I'm crushing on about five new animes thanks to the lovely Emily.  Can't say I'm disappointed, they were all AMAZING.  Its like getting a giant bag of all your favorite candies, I don't know where to start... although I think Saiyuki kinda 0wnz me now, so it may not be as hard as I think. (Ahh, Hakkai, how I love thee)

But then, to top it all off, during our anime-thon the lights went out .  Like, all of them.  The building was evacuated, yadda yadda.  Anyways it was fun, it totally reminded me of every horror movie I've ever seen.  Plus we all got to come out of our holes and interact with our dorm mates. Fun fun fun!

BTW, Emily, I looked up Hakkai's Japanese VA, Akira Ishida.  Yeah, he totally plays Gaara in Naruto. Watch me die.  (He's in a whole bunch of other stuff too.  It means less to me than it will to you so here, http://www.tv.com/akira-ishida/person/123222/appearances.html)
Also, Sanzo=Iruka on Naruto.  SO DED! 

Anyways, yeah. Emily I love you.  You can glomp me with anime anytime.  We need to work out a next night for this! Hooray!"

I am such a doofus.  I've been hella busy lately, and i probably will continue to be until after fall break.  I probably shoulda had my ceramics pieces done and gone by now... but it just didn't happen before the one acts started eating my life.  *kicks self*  So what I think I'm gonna do is take my pieces to my room to save them from smashing and death, then bring them back in sometime after next week and finish them up then.  But it WILL happen eventually, as will my promised trade.  I'll drop you a line when I've got everything sorted out and I'm ready for the (totally amazing) red glaze.

Woe upon my procrastinating self!

"event","Well, I'm finally moved out of the doorms.  I've been slowly getting things out for the past few weeks, but now it's all done and gone.  Downside is, I missed Oakland before we even left it (which is absurd since I live 20 min. away).  Upside, I've now got something I ahven't had a strech of for a good while... free time! 

So I'm using it in the best way possible.  Looking at (for me anyways) shiny new anime sites.  In the process I came upon some great news, Otakon is going to be on my birthday this year.  I'll choose to take that as a sign.  Which brings me to my quetsion, have any of you who read this (aka: Emily) been to Otakon or know someone who's been?  What I want to know, mostly, are basics and wether you think this would be an OK con for a newbie. Anthing would be good really, I'm just so damn curious about the whole 'con' thing right now. Who knows, I just might end up going this year.  *crosses fingers and is scared*

Big thanks!"

"event","Well, I'm all moved out of the dorms finally.  AFter moving stuff home little by little for the past few weeks, I'm finally done.  Downside was I missed Oakland before I even got home (impressive, since the drive is only about half an hour), but the plus side is I've now got all this free time.  

So I'm cruising what are, for me, shiny new anime sites only to come across something v. v. interesting.  Otakon is going to be on my birthday this year (Aug 21), and I think it might be a sign.  So, to all of the people reading this journal(aka, Emily) I have a question.  Have you been to Otakon (or something similar)?  Spill if you have.  Shit, I'll take rumor if you've got it, I'm really very curious about the whole 'con' thing right now.  Who knows, I might even try to go this year.  *is scared*

Big thanks!"

In any case, here is a hilarious anime vid set to Mambo #5 by Lou Bega.  It's got a bunch of different and totally random animes in it, chosen specifically for their exceptional male...talent.  Everyone needs to see this vid.  And for all those going through finals, its a great pick me up.

Being born on the 21st day of the month (3 energy) is likely to add a good bit of vitality to your life. 

The energy of 3 allows you bounce back rapidly from setbacks, physical or mental. 

There is a restlessness in your nature, but you seem to be able to portray an easygoing, ""couldn't care less"" attitude.



You have a natural ability to express yourself in public, and you always make a very good impression. 

Good with words, you excel in writing, speaking, and possibly singing. 

You are energetic and always a good conversationalist. 



You have a keen imagination, but you tend to scatter your energies and become involved with too may superficial matters. 

Your mind is practical and rational despite this tendency to jump about. 

You are affectionate and loving, but very sensitive. 

You are subject to rapid ups and downs.</td>

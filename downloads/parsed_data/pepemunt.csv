"event","I'm in the Las Vegas airport listening to the jingle of the slot machines and watching a very wide and very interesting crowd of people walk by me down the terminal halls. I have another hour before I'm on my way to my final destination of San Francisco.

Holy hell am I glad to be leaving New Orleans. I feel like 90% of the time that I spent there was wasted time. I was absolutely unproductive, but it wasn't relaxing either. In the last week my parents rented me a car so that I could travel uptown everyday to take class and work on my rep, and then usually i spent the rest of the day out, just glad to be out of my house. Even my friends that were around were kind of a let down. A lot of flake outs, and for some it was just inconvenient to do anything. But it's okay, because I feel that I have less and less in common with the people from my past. Which isn't a good thing or a bad thing, but just a statement. And while I will always consider people from home my friends, some of my closest and dearest friends at that, it's still hard to ""do"" anything with them. And I'm talking about a lot of different people here. Even with James, whom I would consider as one my best and closest friends we were somewhat at a loss of how to spend our time together. Thank heavens he was there at all though, because if not I would have been depressed.

But yes, it is interesting how things progress and people change. My parents and I decided that from now on I wouldn't be making any extended visits home. If I am to return home to visit, it will be 4 maybe 5 days max. After all, I am graduating from college and I am starting my life as an adult. Sitting around in my parent's house for weeks and weeks doesn't sound healthy. And it's not like I won't see them because i know they are excited to come visit me wherever I end up, most likely SF. Even they grew weary of my presence in the house. But excuse me if I don't wake up at 7am and go to sleep at 9pm and I don't like eating dinner at 5:30. Our schedules were completely off and I was just making a huge ruckus.

But in any case, the next 12 days will be glorious because I am headed to sunny california to be with my favorite person (who always knows the best ways to occupy my time), to take class, to meet with my choreographer, and to audition. Oh, and GO SHOPPING with Christmas money. Hellll yea.

My ass hurts from sitting in these stupid airport seats."

"event","I'm at home in New Orleans and GOODLAWD I'm ready to get the hell out of here. I keep reminding myself that this is probably the last time I will be at home with the fam for an extended period of time. After this visit, I plan on only coming back for a couple of days at a time and only when necessary. 

It's not that I don't enjoy seeing my family, it's just that I feel completely restricted when I'm here -- moreso this time than previous visits because this time I'm without an automobile, as I left it in NY. 

Last night I managed to escape and spend some time down on Frenchmen St. with a couple of friends. We actually left kind of early... I was up for staying out longer or else seeing what else was going on nearby, but James and I decided to take Charles up on the offer of a ride back uptown, so we had to go. In any case it was nice to get out for a while. I hope to do it again several more times in the rest of my stay here, which seems like an eternity (but is actually only until Jan 12th). 

I came back to my place earlier today and I've been laying around all day, as per usual. I should be taking class and working on my project and getting into top shape, etc., but alas I am stranded in my house on the westbank of all places and am resigned to sleeping 16 hours a day and eating until I'm obese. Don't get me wrong, it's great for the first couple of days. After about a week it loses its appeal. I'm ready to apply myself, damnit!

When I leave here on the 12th I am heading to San Fran to spend a little less than 2 weeks there before I head back to school. I'll be busy taking class and working on my rep and networking and whoring myself out to potential employers, and also spending time with the boyf.  This last semester of school is going to be rough, people. Frankly I wish I could just skip the next four months and head straight into post-collegiate life... but I'm going to enjoy the rest of school while I can I guess.  

For now, however, even the thought of returning to a long final semester of school is more titillating than sitting in my dark bedroom eating stale christmas goodies and watching flip that house marathons."

"event","so I have my dancers coming to my rehearsal in about two hours and I have no new material for them to learn. Oops! 

No, but it's fine. Abby, rachel, kyleigh and chanelle all told me the same exact thing today when I asked them how their rehearsals are going. So I don't feel too bad. It's just one of those weekends when you just kind of play around because you have no idea what you are doing. I'm glad I'm not the only one in this situation tho, and my indecisiveness and tentativeness are normal at this point in the process. This coming week I plan on getting down and dirty and having at least a minute or something of material that is a basic skeleton of some point in the piece. 

The next week I'm not having any rehearsal because I'll be in california for 7 days so I need to get it together. 

Instead of thinking about what I'm going to do when I get into the studios, I spent the last hour downloading tv shows from itunes to put in my ipod for whenever I'm on the train again in the near future. Yea, real productive, right? 

Tonight I plan on coming home, taking a long shower, ordering pizza and picking up some beer and watching reefer madness the musical. I think there are some folks that will be joining me."

"event","Today is the first day that the weather is really cool out and I'm really happy. It's been so hot and miserable for the last week, and I'm ready for fall already. Also I can't wait for my allergies to stop being crazy and waking up every morning sneezing and blowing my nose for 20 minutes. I had a really nice sleep last night also because it was cool. I hate sleeping when it's warm -- I like to be all bundled up. 

I called to make a haircut appointment for later in the week this morning when I woke up, but they surprised me and asked if I could come in today, so that's nice. My hair is kind of long and it's weird because I can never decide if I want it up in kind of a mohawk, or just straight down. Both look kind of weird because of the awkward length that it is right now. The woman that I found to cut my hair in San Fran was actually from New Orleans, and just in the next neighborhood over from me. She was super cool and we were from the same place, AND she did a fierce job with my hair, so I miss her. 

I'm going back to California in 3 weeks! I have so much to do before that however, including putting together a piece and putting on a show. Ahh! We have another rehearsal tomorrow so hopefully we can knock out a big part of it. I also have my first senior project rehearsal tomorrow as well. I'm planning on just playing some improv games and filming it to get some material, and then I might teach them a phrase or two at the end. Bah. I need inspiration! Also, I'm still searching for music. I found a few things that I like but nothing that I love. 

Last night Mark Morris dance group performed at the PAC. It was amazing, and he's a genius. I wish I could come up with movement like that. After the show I came back and smoked a little with Mike and had a drink, and then I moved over to Kyleigh's for a while. Nothing fun happened there tho really. Kyleigh and I got fall for dance tickets at city center for next thursday! It's lucky we got them because it's been sold out for weeks. We are going on the best night too! Karol Armitage is performing and Trisha Brown's company. yesss. 

Dee is coming back to the US from Prague tomorrow evening. I'll be happy to talk on the phone again instead of hurried emails."

"event","Have I really only been at school for about 3 weeks? It feels like I've been here for months alreayd and the semester has just begun. 

I actually have more free time lately than I thought I would, but that's not going to last for much longer. Right now is kind of the calm before the storm. I've been doing some thinking about my project, thinking about concepts, thinking about how I'm going to make this piece, thinking about music, etc. I haven't had any rehearsals for my project yet, but my first one is next Sunday. I don't know if I'm going to have much material, but we'll see. 

Sleepy Hollow hasn't called me back yet, but I think i'm going to be there on monday and wednesday nights. 

I miss Dee. He is still in Poland or someplace strange like that. The worst part is the  not talking thing. There is less than a month until I go to California! yaayyyyyy!
I got a press packet and a dvd from my choreographer so Monday I have to work on getting everything approved so I can take a week off of school.

Last night was lame, I just stayed at home. I made myself a good dinner, had some wine, smoked a little, and watched a movie called ""Delicatessen"". It was this weird french film but it was really really good. My apartment-mate Benson who is on exchange from Taipei watched some if it with me, and then me and quincy watched two episodes of the Golden Girls. I considered going to manhattan, but blah. I'm too lazy to even go sit on a train."

"event","A lot has happened over the past two weeks. I made the drive from New Orleans to New York fine. It was a lot better than I had expected. It only took two kind-of full days of driving. The places where my dad and I stopped at hotels for the night were really terrifying. The first night we made a stop in chattanooga. It wasn't exactly a hopping tourist destination. The next night we found ourselves in a small town in Pennsylvania at an american themed holiday inn where ""proud to be an american"" was playing loudly 24/7 over loudspeakers outside of the hotel. 

There were other small happenings that made me wonder about these strange people in these strange little towns in the middle of nowhere, but I'd rather forget about it. I prefer to remain in major cities where I know what to expect from the crazies. 

My life is booked for the next semester. I have my own comp project to start (my show is feb. 16th-17th). I have all 8 of my dancers and I have a concept and some ideas, but I'm still on the hunt for music. I'm going to have my first rehearsal in two weeks. Then I'm dancing in three other projects, which is going to take up a significant amount of time. I got asked to do four, but I think three is really pushing it since I already have so much else to do. I'm doing arabian in the cracker, and that's all this year thank the lord. Then I think we are going to be peforming Duets off campus somewhere in Manhattan for some gala or something, and also maybe at the Kennedy Center. 

On top of all that, I'm traveling back to san francisco from Oct. 21-28th to learn my rep. Amy Seiwert is my choreographer and I'm super pumped to be working with her. I know it will be fun and challenging. During the time that I'm there in SF is also my 21st birthday! Ahhh finally. So I will be also having drunken adventures during that time, not to mention seeing my BOYFRIEND. ; ) we're gonna be needing lots of alone time. 

He's in eastern europe right now on tour. He was in Belarus, and now he's somewhere in Poland or something. He said that the people there don't like Americans, esp him because he is puerto rican and people look at him funny. He's going to be coming back to the US in about two more weeks. 

So yea, I'm basically in for a wild ride this year with my schedule. I don't know how I'm going to make it through but I will somehow. I'm off to a kind of lazy start, but we'll see how long this lasts."

Home is aight. Quite boring, actually. Everyone at my house seems content doing their own little activities; my mom is watching her television shows or else working on her laptop, my dad is usually walking on the treadmill and excercising (he's been on a workout/fitness streak for the last 2 years now) and my brother usually shuts himself up in his room to do his homework or else mopes around the house because he is 16 and miserable, and then goes to bed by 9pm. 

What do I do you may ask? Drink a lot of wine. And for free mind you because we live in the south and my parents liquor cabinet is always stocked full. That's one good thing about home I have to say. 

My mom got a new car yesterday -- well actually it's this huge gigantic SUV. So now there are five vehicles crammed into our driveway. One is my dad's workvan, one is a truck, one is a Jeep, one is my CRV and the other is the big new bulking 8 seat SUV. Ah... I feel so American. 

I went to Brocato's the other night with James when we had the munchies and of course I ran into a group of about 6 people from my high school class. I wasn't really close to any of them, and I didn't remember two of their names. I decided to be nice on the way out and say hi and all that, and it was sufficiently awkward. Ohhh high school memories. I think those should be left in the past. It's always so awkward when I run into somone that I went to school with but never actually was friends with, because it's like should I be friendly? should I pretend like I don't recognize them? It's so lame."

"event","So to make visiting home even more annoying, there is a hurricane in the Gulf that may or may not cause us to have to evacuate the city. As of right now it is projected to it southern Texas... but if anything changes, then I will have to get off of my flight from California and join my family in the evacuation process later that day or the next day. Bah.

I'm bummed about leaving San Fran. I had a fabulous summer. 

The other night dee and I hosted a dinner party here to say goodbye to our friend Jose who is moving to London and getting married to his boyfriend. Bryan was in charge of the cooking and I was the sous-chef. (I've been watching too much top chef.) We had an amazing salad with feta cheese, fresh tomatoes, onion, walnuts and raspberry dressing. Then we had this like honey mustard chicken and scalloped potatoes. I made the cake for dessert. We also had a few bottles of wine and many rounds of the bowl.

I had a shopping spree the other day... I went across town to the haight/ashbury area, and when I was done I had enough shopping bags to make it uncomfortable for me to walk down the street. I then proceeded to get a fierce cute haircut in Hayes Valley... the girl that cuts my hair there is from New Orleans (the westbank at that), but moved away more than 15 years ago. Still, we chatted about stupid things like K&B closing (which she was shocked about), the old canal villere stores, mckenzies and port of call. 

Yesterday dee, jeremiah and myself were on the hunt for knicknacks to decorate the new glass shelves that we put up in the apartment. We found some vases, some nice bottles and candles and shit like that to put on there. It looks nice. 

Today my plans are to do laundry, hit up whole foods, maybe pack a box of shit to mail to myself (bc of couse I can't fit everything back in my suitcases), and then I think dee and I are going to go to dinner someplace -- maybe at this chic french place in the fillmore. I'm just trying to enjoy my last days here of summer and not having anything to do before I have no life. The next couple of months will be busy and flustering... but not in a good way I imagine. Hopefully a hurricane next week won't be a part of that stress."

"event","It's been a pretty low key last few days. 

On friday dee and I ate at this super posh thai place called asha in the financial district. We were in the area because I had to pick up my check and go to the bank. It was some of the best food that I've had since I've been here. It was also good because even though we are both kind of broke at the moment, it was nice to eat something that came from outside the apartment. The best part about it was this drink that we got, the North Pole. It was pinapple juice and some kind of delicious foreign liqour that I've never heard of before (and now I can't remember it) and a big scoop of coconut ice cream. 

After that we went to this studio showing for a company that our friend Jeremiah dances for.  The showing was alright. I was distracted by a guy sitting in front of me that thought it would be cool to take pictures with his phone the entire time. The best part about the showing was that they had some free wine and snacks beforehand, which I took a generous amount of. Well, the wine not the snacks. Anyways, the choreography had some good things, but also some things that I wasn't too fond of. 

Yesterday we didn't leave the apartment once. Bethany came over and visited and we watched an episode of  Buffy season II. ew. And we were going to go to a party in the mission at this place, but then we were too lazy. 

Today we went to the asian art museum. It was pretty fantastic. The Japanese art impressed me the most, especially the more modern stuff. We spent a good while in there... and then we went grocery shopping. Somewhat anticlimactic. Tonight our plans include watching the roast of flava-flav. 

Tomorrow I'm going to get up and take class since I've neglected to do so this entire past week. Then I have to get a big box from ups so that I can start packing some stuff to mail to myself in new york. I've accumulated too much since I've been here to stuff back in my suitcases. 

Yea, I don't know why I wrote this entry so I'm going to end it now."

Well, it's not like I'm going to rush out of here and do anything exciting. Tonight I might to see an open rehearsal type thing that one of my friends is in, and then...? I predict going back to our apartment and drinking. Pretty much the same thing that happens every night. Holler."

I compulsively check my email, read almost every new article of news that happens, take a peek at facebook here and there, and now I'm going to write in my livejournal. Amazing. 

The best part about today is that everyone is in a staff meeting, which I skipped out on (being a temp and all) so now I don't even have to think twice about any tall passers-by who might peer over my cubicle wall at my computer screen littered with internet explorer windows. =)

13 more days until I leave California. I don't WANNA goooo. I have nothing to look forward to when I go back to school, really. One of my roommates, Serge, got a job with American Repertory Ballet; he is just going to be taking comp class in the evenings so that way he can still do his senior project and graduate, but he isn't going to be living with us anymore. So that means there is a random person (perhaps a nasty smelly messy straight boy?) that is going to be living in my apartment with me and Quincy and this other guy Jeremy (who I'm not really friends with, but he's also in the dance conservatory and at least I know him well enough). Thank god I have a single room. 

Additionally, I am bored and unmotivated with the classes there. I have very few friends left because everyone I get close to always leaves school for one reason or another... and Dee is all graduated and ish, so it's going to be a long semester ahead. I plan on keeping myself busy with creating my senior project, teaching at sleepy hollow dance center, and I might also get another job since I won't be taking any night classes this semester and I will also have my car for the first time. When I am not doing any of these things I will probably be found in my room with a large jug of wine. I know, I know complain complain complain, but it feels as if I am about to jump head on into a dark and wintry next few months."

"event","So I'm starting out this new journal... I stopped writing in my last one for so long that I think it would be weird to start positing again suddenly. Too much has happened since my last post (almost a year ago, I think) to just start up again like nothing happened. I also don't know why I feel compelled to start posting again, but I do, so I'm just going with it. 

I'm here in San Francisco with Dee. I have the day off of work today, and I was planning on waking up and taking Viktor's ballet class at sfdc, but I got distracted with playing around online, and so I said fuck it. I'm still on my summer vaction and I'll have more dance then I can handle when I get back to school. I'm also not that worried about class because I found someone to do my rep for me for my senior project. 

For our senior project at Purchase, we have to put on a show that is open to the public that includes a piece of our own choreography set on other dancers in the conservatory, and also a solo performance that is set on us by a professional and well-known choreographer. We're responsible for everything that goes along with the show, including costumes, lighting, music, etc. It sounds easy and like anyone could do it, but it's really really not. I'm already stressing and my show isn't untili the end of Feb. 

Anyway, I saw a show here during the westwave dance festival of Amy Seiwet's company im-ij-re. I liked the whole show and thought it would be great to work with her, so I contacted her and told her the whole deal, blah blah blah and asked her if she was interested in working with me. She came and watched me take class last Saturday (I guess to make sure that I wasn't a mess before she committed to anything) and she said that she does want to work with me and create a new piece on me. I'm really excited because she was the first and only person I asked, and I had expected it to be a lot harder. She's pretty well known around here from her own company, principal with sacramento ballet, Smuin ballet, and she was in Dance Magazine's top 25 to watch last year. I'm going to be traveling back to San Francisco to work with her  probably in October, and sometime in January and/or February.

I have 14 days left in San Francisco before I travel home to New Orleans, spend a couple of days there, and then drive to New York to start school on Sept. 5th. UGH. I'm really really really sad about leaving SF. I don't want to leave Dee mostly. It blows balls that we are going to be apart for a while. We've pretty much lived together in the same tiny room since Janurary when we were still in schoo, and then kind of relocated to california for a while. I know that we are going to be OK though, especially since I am going to be back in SF so much over the school year. It's just going to make me sad in the meantime when we are apart. 

Hm, I guess that's enough to post in my first entry. At least now I'm kind of set up so that I don't have to explain everything so much the next time that I write. Also, I'm hungry and I think we are going to cook some eggs and toast. And then I have to go to the bank and the post office, and then figure out what else we are going to do. I'm hoping that we are motivated to actually go out and do something today instead of continuing the tradition of the last few days when we sit around smoke pot and watch cartoons. Especially because my time here is dwindling down. I'm feeling in the mood for a little shopping spree today...?"

"event","Well i know i dont post mmuch but i figured i would post about everything happeneing now and my thoughts and questions on things.  Well lets start off with Jessica...


I think that your a great person.  Dont get me wrong your heart is in an amazing place and you have your head on straight for the most part.  There are some things that i question though.  One topic is your birthday.  People come to celebrate something that is dear to you.  I dontknow if you were kidding about the whole ""expecting presents because you never really got them from your parents"" but i felt that was not needed.  I sympathize for you for not recieving presents growing up or whatever happened (im not dissing anyone here and i know i dont know that whole story so dont knock me for it im just saying what i do somewhat know) but to go and say you want or expect presents is kinda rude.  We arent supposed to make up for your parents gaps.  Also The people you hang out with on a normal basis...most of them dont have a job.  They barely have money to do the stuff they do.  To ask openly and say you expect them seems kinda weird.  But hey thats just me and i dont know i guess im old fashioned or stupid.  
Also, the costume thing.  I understand you want a theme for your birthday like Lauren did but you cant expect everyone to abide by it.  Your request is a lot different than laurens.  Most people had the stuff to wear to laurens party but a costume is harder to get and they cost money so that then takes away from your presents.  I feel that a costume should be an option.  Be mean or rude or not even talk to people that dont have a costume on at your party but to say that you wont let them in and then be mad at them for not showing up is kinda childish.  Because the truth of the matter is that i will not wear a costume.  Never liked them and never will.  Ill dress nice but thats it.  So if your not going to let me in let me know i wont waste the gas to go out there.

Lauren...
Like Jessica most of the time your heart is in the right place and your head is on straight.  On the dumb question thing i put you are a follower.  I still agree to that.  I think that you let alot of people influence you and that affects the way you live your life.  To me that is a bad thing but to others it might be a plus.  I said that because i told you i would be honest and im sorry you didnt like it.  
About the fact that you said some shit behind my back.  Someone told me (dont ask me who because i wont tell you, but i trust this person with everything i own and my life so i believe them) that you dont know if you would want to date me because of my past.  Well, ya i agree my past isnt something that is the best.  Nor is it something i am proud of.  But you know what, yours isnt too much better.  Hell our number is close to the same...what yours is one off.  So would that make you have a bad past as well?  Maybe i dont know if i would have wanted to date you because of your track record.  I guess what im trying to say is that when i heard you say something like that, i took it offensivly and it hurt.  I also thought that it was kinda a kick in the nuts because your the last person i thought would say something to me like that (besides anibal, dan and jonathan).  But hey i guess like you said, i dont know you that well.
And i just kinda want to make a comment about something you said on this thing.  I know its not my business (i just kinda figured if your going to get pissed at me for the first half might as well go all out) but the whole ""sexcapades"" thing.  Like you and sean didnt have those.  Hell i have seen a video of the start of one so i dont even want to hear it.  But hey maybe your reffering to the ""drunken sexcapades"" wich then i would have to bring up the name chris...you have had yours too so i dont want to hear it like it is one sided.

Sean and Seth...
You guys came into our group not too long ago.  And i will admit before you guys came into the group, we were never this way.  I am not saying this to make you feel like you did anything wrong because you didnt.  And i mean that.  For the most part you 2 are really cool.  I only really have one problem with the both of you.  Why didnt you trust me with your girlfriends?  Sean you stood outside anibal's apartment one night when lauren and i were talking and would not leave til we were done.  Am i that much competition for you or what, its kinda weird.  And Seth, you dont trust me with Keli either.  You get mad about the way Keli and i acted towards eachother.  Sorry but thats just the way it is.  I guess i was considered competition for you too.  Wow thats pretty impressive, i didnt even have to try and i got both of you to freak out.

Well thats about it i reckon.  I did not intend this to piss anyone off but im sure it will.  Have great night fellas and thats that.

"event","The language arts junior high teacher is requiring the students to read four classics a year. 

I am of two minds about classics. I kinda hate sloughing through them. But on the other hand, it is good to be challenged. Plus, some of them are actually good. Of Mice and Men breaks my heart every time. Gone with the Wind was sweeping with engaging characters and is an interesting look at a portion of American culture. I feel so at home in the agriculture-y setting of O Pioneers! I maintain that others, like Catcher in the Rye, are like the emperor in his new clothes. HAAAAAATE. Others I need help with. I could have never enjoyed Pride and Prejudice without having seen the 6 hour BBC movie. When ever I tried reading it before it seemed colossally dumb and a waste of time (but Wishbone made it seem so good!).  

The language arts teacher (whom I admire) really wants the students to be able to get allusions when they happen and see the influence they have on contemporary books. I can get behind that. If I can get the junior high students to shut up long enough to hear me."

"event","Derek and I have entered serious negotiations about procreation. It's weird to think about being pregnant and not wanting to do something similar to chewing off a limb to get out of being trapped. It's actually pretty exciting. But scary, of course. 

We have a house, a comfortable income (although I don't know if I will ever stop worrying about not having enough), good sources of support, and some maturity. And also the desire to have children despite the sacrifices that come with it. 

But my main concern is my meds. All of the doctors/nurse practitioners I've talked to have felt the one I am on is not good for babies. Some have suggested switching to a safer one (none are safe). One mentioned Prozac as a safer one. Another said Prozac increased risks for holes in the heart and both sides of our families have heart problems. Brenda said most babies of Prozac moms have seizures. So, she was going to do some research. I think I would like to try to go without as that would be safest for the baby (but only to the extent that having a depressed mom is also bad for baby). 

So, we'll see. I need to stay focused on teaching right now. Speaking of....off to lesson plans!"

Today, Derek and took a long shopping day. What started out as a big Perkins breakfast in honor of my first grown up pay check (I have money!) and few errands, turned into an all day extravaganza. 

We walked through Har Mar's Barnes and Noble and found out <a href=""http://www.timkehoe.com/"">a local children's author</a> I like was speaking later on today. We figured we'd complete our errands and I'd come back alone. However, after the pet store, the bank, the other bank, a different pet store, spending way too much time considering a used wii (I have money, but I also have a lot of debt!), another bookstore just for fun, and STILL another pet store (who knew finding a replacement end to those cat fishing rods was so difficult), Derek was forced to listen to the children's author too. 

I expected him to be bored, but he enjoyed it too. Probably because the author mentioned Nikola Tesla. This was the first time I've had a book signed. I was as embarrassingly fanish as I feared. Telling him I was one of the booksellers he handed off a self published copy to and that he had once thanked me for displaying it as a staff recommendation and then Derek telling him how much he liked Tesla and wasn't Edison a jerk might have been a bit much. But he also half apologized for his dad complaining that the book was too high on the shelves since we keep books in alphabetical order after all. So maybe it was okay. 

Then my boss showed up and I really wished I had showered.

"event","Derek and I are in the process of buying a house. We just have to wait on some loan paperwork. We close on the 28th of this month. It happened really fast. We thought we were only looking into it. We had decided to stay in the cities, at least for a few years, as there were hardly any jobs for Derek to apply to Up North. We got all pre-approved for a loan based on Derek's income (since I am still looking for a library job - not that that is surprising- and I might opt to stay home when the kids are very little) and we went out once with the realtor. And BAM we found something we really liked right away. 

The thing has seven bedrooms. It's the biggest house we could afford no mater which neighborhood or suburb we looked in. The seller had made it into a duplex only to realize that it was zoned to be a single family home. He got in the market very close to the end of the tax credit. So, really wanting to  get rid of it and there being few buyers in the market, he had dropped the price dramatically. Right into our price range. Also it has no  garage, which makes a lot of buyers (i thought my husband included) uninterested. 

Besides the space (which we probably like because we grew up in big farm houses) we really like the house. Also, if/when Derek's dad can get the heart transplant, his mom can stay with us for free. She can have the whole upstairs to herself (she's an introvert) and we only have to share the kitchen. 

I recently interviewed for a Catholic school librarian position. I'd really love it. As I was getting excited at the prospect in the interview, I was also quite nervous about it. It would be more responsibility than I've been used to.

Last night I had a nightmare about it. I dreamed the students kept leaving the library in the middle of the stories and lessons, and I couldn't manage the time to cover what I needed to cover, and I was using the previous librarians lesson plans, but they made no sense for what I had to cover.  Also, I don't think you should give second graders as much homework as I was giving in the dream. 

I would learn to do the job and I'd really like it. We'll see though. The principal said it would be a tough decision. There may be second interviews."

Planners don't help when you write the wrong things down. :-P 

Or when you glance at a weekend for your work schedule but look at last weekend instead of this weekend. And that's how managers end up thinking you are lying in a ditch somewhere. 'Cause even if you are usually late, you always show up.

Ten things I wish I could say to people:

10. CALM the fuck down. 
9. I'm sorry if it seems like I'm trying to mom you, but I just want you to be happy.
8. Are you sure you shouldn't go back on your meds? It makes life so much easier. 
7. I love you hardcore, but you're judgmental and opinionated. Please stop trying to be the boss of us. <3
6. I'm sure you're a little disappointed, but I'm pretty happy. 
5. I'm sorry I was an immature jerk and didn't invite you to my graduation party, but seriously? Stop suing Grandpa. Thanks for not slipping or spilling hot cider on yourself at the wedding and suing us. I was worried. It wasn't my idea to invite you. Actually, I'm not sorry and I am sorry I'll probably have to deal with you when grandma and grandpa pass away. Please don't contest the will.  
4. I'm sorry if being cold hurts you guys. I didn't mean that and I hope you are both happy in life. I just don't like dealing with people who repeatedly hurt others and that's your folks. 
3. At first it hurt, but I'm better off with out you. I found much better friends.
2. So...if I ignore where I'm scheduled at work and only do stuff in my section until enough people complain, eventually I'll be scheduled for complete project shifts, right? Or if I quit, I'll automatically be promoted a couple weeks later, right? Fucked up. 
1. Back off! 

Nine things about myself:
9. I've become a clean person. I'm SO much less stressed when my house is clean. It's Lauren's fault. 
8. Writing used to be really important to me, but now...I just don't.
7. Praying used to be really important to me, but now...I just don't. 
6. I kinda hate showering. It's important to be clean. I just hate the part in between being wet and being dry. Ugh. 
5. I have a really handsome husband who is really nice. 
4. I'm both ashamed of and love my job. 
3. I wonder if I should have been an elementary teacher. 
2. I miss living with a kitty! 
1. I need new bras. 

Eight ways to win my heart: 
8. Don't make me feel dumb. 
7. Be straightforward.
6. Indulge in the ridiculous! 
5. Don't make me drive. 
4. If you are a co-worker, take care of the communal dishes. Jerk. 
3. Be tolerant. 
2. 
1. 

Seven things that cross my mind a lot:
7. babies babies babies
6. Work 
5. I probably wont be able to find a job. 
4. Where will Derek and I live? 
3. Books Books Books Books 
2. I don't want to get up. Hate morning.  
1. I don't want to do my homework. 

Six things I do before I go to sleep:
6. Check e-mail, social networking sites 
5. When do I work? 
4. Pajamas
3. Brush teeth
2. read 
1. Maybe a shag. 

Five places I want to visit:
5. Las Vegas because that's where my BFF lives, the rest is just decadence. 
4. Alaskan cruise. 
3. Duluth, 'cause I wasn't paying attention the first time. 
2. There's still a lot of Twin Cities things I haven't done. 
1. Maybe Mexico again. 

Four things I'm wearing right now:
4. jeans
3. stupid black socks
2. Vagina Monologues t-shirt 
1. grey underwear with a little pink bow! 

Three bands I listen to often:
3. The Hold Steady <3
2. Gaslight Anthem <3
1. Breaking Benjamin (because of Derek)

Two things I want to do before I die:
2. babies 
1. get a house! (nesting?)

One confession:
1. I feel like a bad Katie, because Derek will always be the bread winner and I want to be Supermom. I'm wasting my education.

"event","<lj-cut text=""And they lived contentedly ever after"">The wedding went well and, although I was prepared to hate it, I kinda enjoyed it. I'm also quite happy it's over with. 

I've been pretty pleased with playing housewife. My house is presentable a majority of the time and my food usually edible. I've scored points with his family with excellent Christmas presents and meals I've cooked. His folks stayed with us when his Dad had some appointments at the U of M hospital before the wedding and they liked the dinners I made.  Afterword, when Derek was deer hunting, Derek complemented his uncle on his chili. His uncle said ""I bet you don't get too many home cooked meal down in the cities."" And his dad said, ""Well actually..."" and told him about the mushroom smothered cube steak I made.

HAH!

(To balance that victory, the other day I served guests a very chunky tomato soup. Either I needed to process the tomatoes longer or get an actual food processor instead of using a vegetable chopper. I don't like tomato soup enough to find out by trying again.) 

Before I sound too much like a fifties house wife, I want to say I still feel embarrassed that with a bachelors and a near masters, I'm still working retail. One of my respected profs came by (I hate it when acquaintances from college come to the store) and all I had to say about what I've been up to was that I had been married. Awesome. I have a St. Kate's degree but at least I got my MRS. Ugh. 

I'll graduate in May, which I'm glad of. But, whether I get a job in my field depends on so many things. There's the economy and that I don't interview well. (Grrr) But, also, depending on where Derek and I want to settle down. Which depends on Derek being able to find a job. He'll always be the bread winner because engineers are paid more (oh why didn't I like the sciences) and because jobs are easier to find that field. We were planning on going to to Fargo to be closer to our family. But the cities are growing on Derek so he's kind of okay with the prospect of living around here and working at the same job. He'd prefer to live in Plymouth though, which worries me because I don't think there's quite as much to do in the suburbs. (Am I wrong on this?? Maybe it's only because I don't have a car that I think this) Derek would probably want to live outside of Fargo anyway, where as I'd like to live in the city.  

Ah well. These a problems for another day.

Now concerning virgins, I have no command of the Lord, but give my opinion as one who by the Lord's mercy is trustworthy. I think that, in view of the impending crisis, it is well for you to remain as you are. Are you bound to a wife? Do not seek to be free. Are you free from a wife? Do not seek a wife.

The unique guest book.
I suspect she decorated the unity candle herself. 
Everyone looked lovely and so happy!
The readings were well chosen and I didn't make any terrible mistakes!
Willy's ring is REALLY, REALLY cool.
Camping is such a unique idea for guests.
The food was great!
The bonfire was toasty and comfy. 

Also, it made me less nervous about my own. At the beginning of the ceremony I had the urge to run. Not from Cari's wedding, but from mine. Not from Derek or marriage, just the huge public ceremony. The funny thing was I thought about grabbing his hand and running. But decided against it as I would go faster without him.

Is this just compensating because I feel like I won't be contributing? 

I am also concerned I will be swallowed by a whale on our honeymoon (possibly an Alaskan cruise)."

"event","So. Derek and I finished our marriage counseling with our hometown priest and didn't have to talk about sex! Sweeeeeet! My brother and his wife didn't have to talk to their pastor about sex either.

Another rite-of-marriage-passage went a little different for us though. It seems to me that learning to drive never goes well, even when the teacher and student are spouses. My mom had a hard time learning from Dad. And Julie was in tears when my brother was teaching her to drive a manual transition. 

I'm a little nervous about Derek's car. He loves it so much. And I get in (non-serious) trouble for scraping the door on the ground when I close it, or forget not to get fingerprints on the window, or forget not to open or close the trunk with the spoiler. He hates that. 

But it's impractical not to be able to drive the only car at (somewhat) my disposal. And after almost two years I felt comfortable enough to try it. And Derek was so NICE about the whole damn thing. POSITIVE REINFORCEMENT is AWESOME! 

Plus, if I knew me trying would have made him that happy, I might have tried earlier. 

Also, turns out I did really well for a beginner."

"event","Registering has given me all these fantasies of housewifery. I want a red and white kitchen like my grandma that will always smell like baking bread. Like that will happen. 

For the record, registering is only fun for the first few minutes. Also, Walmart (unfortunately where a lot of my guest will be shopping due to the fact that we live in the middle) blows dogs for quarters in the street AND is difficult to register at. 

Technically my first wedding present was a set of dishes from my grandmother's sister, Frieda. I'm very excited about these dishes, which will be our company dishes (squee!). And even thought the wedding is still five months away, one of Derek's friends sent a present super early. The friend of Derek's isn't a particularly close friend, making it even more unexpected and sweeter.   

In addition to the company dishes, I am one oven mitt and two towels closer to my delicious, Sena (grandma's name is Dutch) inspired kitchen."

"event","So being Catholic is/was a big part of my identity. And when I thought of my wedding, a mass was always a part of it. Now, I haven't been practicing since I got depression a year and half ago. Catholicism is something I see myself practicing again later (and passing on to my children in a this-is-a-path-open-to-you-but-there-are-other-paths-too kind of way), but not yet. Derek's not so much into the whole organized religion thing (not that he doesn't think about theological things). So it seems like a mass or not mass shouldn't be a big deal. 

Still, when Derek and I were talking about the mass vs. non-mass and he mentioned the possibility of some of his family members not being comfortable during a mass, I felt really sad at not being able to have a mass. Enter some religious confusion. And some irritation at my self for wanting what I wanted as the expense of some very important family members having that now-everyone-is-staring-at-me-because-I'm-the-only-person-in-the-wedding-party-not-lining-up-for-the-bread-and-wine feeling. 

I checked out a book on Catholic weddings from the library and Derek called his brother. Really the set up for Catholic ceremony without the mass is pretty much the same as the ceremony with the mass, only without the Eucharist. And honestly, its the pattern of the readings I wanted. Because that's the whole ever since I was a little girl part for me. I really love me some ritual. 

We still have to talk to Fr. Rick and all that. (I want to get married in the church I grew up in). But I think this is a step toward the wedding we really want. One that's family orientated.

Days off go so fast. I'm getting some laundry and some cleaning done. Not so much the homework.

Also, what do you all think of this dress? 

http://www.davidsbridal.com/bridal_gowns_detail.jsp?stid=3945&prodgroup=10

I'm ahead of myself, I know. We haven't budgeted. (Or even set the date with Fr. Rick. Or actually had the question popped. But yeah. It's happening.) But this one is within our not set buget, I believe.However, it's only available online.

So, I'm thinking I should go to a David's Bridal and see what's the difference between white and ivory (ivory is better for white people, right?) And I can get measured there to make sure I get the best size. Because the return policy is strict.

Also, I'm nervous about the chest. I don't want a ton of cleavage, or any, if possible. Do you think that would be a problem with this dress? Any other thoughts?"

Maybe they recognized that I was shelving their books. Two girls asked if I had seen any bread. Like marble? I felt like shit. Instead of being a responsible adult and telling the truth, possibly with a little Mary Poppins-ish we must keep the store tidy or some such thrown in, I said no.

"event","L and I FINALLY have the internets! We are paying for them like responsible adults! Although that was a huge pain due to our building being super old and scheduling issues. The new apartment is much cheaper than the last one and although there is less space, it's even a little more perfect for us. Plus, we're on a WAY better bus route. 

My little brother and his wife moved into a smaller apartment recently too. Most of us who moved them (family + D) are of the opinion that this one will be a better fit for them. But we're not the ones who have to live in it. They're closer to their jobs, so that's a bonus anyway.

I really think that getting married was a good decision on their part, even though they are very young. They just fit together very well. You can never tell if people will or won't ""work out."" And even if they don't, which I think they will, I think this is a good choice for them right now. 

And I just really like Julie. Once I said that my brother would hate anyone I dated and I would love anyone he dated just on principle. And I did like all his girlfriends, but not as genuinely as I like Julie. 

Recently she and I had a helpful conversation about wedding and marriage stuff. D hasn't popped the question yet, but we are thinking about next November. The conversation helped with the HOLY-SHIT-CAN-I-REALLY-LIVE-WITH-THIS-MAN-FOREVER temporary panic as well as the HOLY-SHIT-THE-FUCKING-PARTY-PART-IS-FUCKING-A-LOT-OF-WORK-AND-FUCKING-EXPENSIVE panic that will prolly resurface again. 

Honestly. I would really like just to finish out the lease with L, go the the justice of the peace, and quietly move into D's apartment. No ring, no dress, no stress. However, we care about our friends and family who would be pissed/sad/disappointed, my inner girly girl, and the keeping up of appearances. Plus. It could be fun."

"event","Ah, the month of June. The month of my wee brother's nuptials. I took three weekends in June off for wedding related events. There's the flower weekend, the bachelorette weekend, and the actual wedding. 

This weekend was the weekend of making flowers. Julie went silk to save $. And making them ourselves saved even more $. That's my frugal future-sister-in-law! I was looking forward to the female bonding and learning more about fake wedding flowers, because someday I too will save wedding $ on fake flowers. 

However, this was one of the worst weeks ever. I lost my check card (or was that last week?...either way, it's gone and I haven't got my new one yet). Work was busy, but we still weren't making sales. Plus for one shift I had over ten projects to do and was scheduled at cash wrap. Can we say lame? I was running my ass off that day and the day after. Plus I was emo because I forgot to take my damn pill for at least one day. Then Derek got sick and something's funky with his contact, so he wouldn't be able to drive me home for a weekend. So I'd have to take a train. So I packed, cleaned my room in case there was a showing of our apartment, and went to work. After work I went to the train station and waited 45 minutes while a visiting Aussie planed a giant trip around the USA. Then found out that Amtrak doesn't take checks. 

So, after bawling a bit in the waiting area, I went to Derek's the hide from the cruel, cruel world. Other people offered to buy tickets for me, but I know when a week has kicked my ass. 

I feel really bad because I don't think I've been very helpful to Julie. Or as supportive as I could be.  Sometimes I just feel so worn out! I really like her though! She's a great person. She makes my brother happy and they fit together really well. And she fits into the family too. 

Also, I really missed out. Julie and Mom said the flowers went great and look really good. I also missed Josh trying to hot glue gun a band aid on Julie. They're such a great couple. 

However, I think taking the time for myself was a good idea. And there's always the bachelorette party, where I will find out if my gift will embarrass or amuse Julie."

"event","I had nightmares about being a bridesmaid. I dreamed I'd look like a hooker in a spaghetti strap dress next to the other bridesmaids' pixie frames.  The other bridesmaids have A cups. They and the bride don't even have to wear bras. Shopping for a strapless bra made me hate everyone that was a C cup or less. Lucky bitches.

I had found two good ones (Very Sexy @ Victorias Secret and Wacoal @ Bloomingdale's) , but wasn't sure which one to go with as neither was ideal.

I'll have cleavage (Lauren: what are you going to do, cut off your boobs?). But it will be church cleavage, thanks to the seamstress.  And I won't look like Marjorie Main either (google her, that's what I'll look like when I'm old.) because of Vitoria secret and the dress being tight at the rib cage and, thus, adding support. 

Buy the way, I spent about as much on bras as I did on the dress."

"event","So, this month's B&N recommends book is Belong to Me. Sandy at work is ALL about that book and it's prequel, Love Walked In. She declared that she would walk to California for the lead male in the prequel. ""I'm a lesbian and I'd walk to California for that man,"" she emphasized. Wow, I thought, I don't even know if I'd drive to California for Derek. 

The fifth was Derek's birthday. The night before he took me out to a nice restaurant, let me drag him to Borders and the Har Mar B&N to compare merchandising/cataloging. And also to see if they had the second volume of a graphic novel I started at my store. AND the next day he warmed up lunch and brought it to me at work. 

Man. I'm going to have to be really nice to him on my birthday.

MAYBE I would walk to California for him."

"event","So. Toady was my first day of the small vacation I took. The first day I have had off that I didn't have to do homework/socialization/laundry/errands/help someone move/ect. 

I had beer and pancakes for dinner. I took a long bath, shaved, lotioned, everything relaxing and pretty-making. Because it's relaxing and I was gonna spend time with my man. 

Then I got nagged AGAIN about getting D measured for a tux, as he will be an usher in my brother's wedding in June. 

I AM NOT HIS MOTHER. Just 'cause I'm dating him does not mean I am the boss of him. AND he and I ALREADY had a tiff about this measuring thing. We were going to get it done tomorrow!

And it was pretty much downhill from there. No more relaxing, got angry at my sister, mom, and bf. No more pleasant night with my man. Having to apologize. Having to hear, ""you sound so stressed, what can we do?"" ""You're so stressed, don't worry. You'll be home soon.""

LIKE HOME FOR THE HOLIDAYS ARE RELAXING!

GOD! I can barely take care of myself. I don't want to be his babysiter too.

The corpse turned into a zombie and started clawing at the back of her head. Because it wanted to eat her brains. 

And Dick Cheney was also there, telling her to suck it up and making fun of her work shoes.

I finally called my sister. That only took three or so months. 

Here's what's making me tired:
<b>work</b>-the usual

<b>school</b>- the usual, plus frustration that I'm not entirely sure what we're supposed to be doing in my internet class. A syllabus would be nice. The prof is fun, with his ""chaotic neutral"" D&D sticker on his water bottle and all. But it'd be cool to have some direction. (This is where I should be claiming my education like the nun's told us via The Reflective Woman, I suppose).

<b>moving</b>-Derek's in his Plymouth apartment. Not quite moved in, really because he has a tendency to never unpack. So I'm helping/meddling. His living room is really funny. One half has all the grown up furniture with a nice throw blanket over the couch (okay that was me). The other half has the weird bean bag dorm-ish chair, beer sign and movie poster. Ah, transition."

"event","<font face=""Arial"" size=""2"">an amazing show.. for once, i actually fully understand the whole plot to the play. I've seen a couple versions of it, and that was by far the best. 
the winery was also amazing, i want to go there again when there is no people, at night, just walk around. But i guess they would not like you doing that very much... but i want to go sometime with you and try.. amazing

I shall have my own theatre company."

"event","<font face=""Arial"" size=""2"">its over. the strike completed, in what I hear is one of the fasted times. Ron was very pleased with how it went down. Except for a load from the shop, my work for viva is done. ah well. 

I still need to be on that beach, and not here with that fucking stupid movie in the background.

This music is... it just is. Exactly what I need right now. Thank you, thank you so much. A light in the darkness. here i go, chasing something that shall never materialise.. oh well. dreams, sometimes become reality."

"event","<font face=""Arial"" size=""2"">the stars are bright. the show is over. I'm glad its over, but sad its gone. I've had enough of some elements of it, and miss others. once again, the crew are hidden in the shadows while the actors get the spotlight, and not just onstage, but also off at the cast party. About every person gets handed something and a speech about them, and the crew, not a word except for a solitaire actor who shook are hands. Its what I expect. Its just sad that it happens, we put in 4X the amount of time, a hell of a lot of hard work.. and what do we get. ""how were you involved with the show"" meh. I don't know what to think right now, my mind is a mess. I need to sit on the beach, all night. just sit, maybe be with someone. I need to do something like Ashland. I need to do it before school starts. I don't think I shall go to calgary, i'll tell him tomorrow. I decided this on the drive home tonight, I don't think its wise, as I don't have the money, and I don't have the patience. We shall be working together a lot at school, we need a break. I just need.. well, a beach. the other night made me realise that. a beach, and this music. I can not add anything to what I have left of my summer, its bad enough as it is. I need me time. badly. i feel like i'm not tom, I'm the TD who is stressed, tired, and angry that i was put, once again, in a position i was not totally comfortable in. I need a comfort zone. I need away from the cast of which is kss (gay), and there director. fuck. i need me back. i need sleep. 
I strike tomorrow, tomorrow night, if all is done, I may just hit the beach."

"event","<font face=""Arial"" size=""2"">turns around within my head. I miss it, I wish for it.. reminders, around me all the time. your there, but I can do nothing except get closer. But unless something happens, nothing else can change. it shall have to remain the way it is, and see where it possibly goes going into this school year. Unlike last year I shall see more of her, and we have some classes together.. this is lasting a long time, getting close to being a year. dam emotions."

"event","<font face=""Arial"" size=""2"">a interesting day.. crazy time spent while working with our fav person, a meeting that got kinda wild for me, i'm still trying to figure out half the stuff that was said. my mind is overloaded, never knew about half the stuff that was said, as i had never been told in the first place. what the hell! like if your going to be getting a new TD in, maybe fill him in on a fewww items at least just so he does not feel like a right idiot when he has no clue what there talking about. fruit boxes, what fucking fruit boxes! grrrrrr. I knew that her being nice in the morning would not last, she was back to her good all bitchy self by the meeting. that was great to. jusssttt great. 
Dinner at Gasthaust, our server was not there... ;(.. still a good meal, and scott asking our server if she graded from pringle last year was funny as hell! she graded from UVIC! haha she was even older than his sister. now that provided some laughs as we ran out of there. 
Late time working on the banner at the shop, then picked up the smoke machine which has to be tested, and some experiments to be had.. hehe. 
I'm tired as hell after this day, I have to get up tomorrow, get my fucking picture taken for the program, and then off to the shop to build flats, finish sign, and show our lighting designer where his lights might be able to go.. 
I am extremely worried about the painting, it was andrews last day today until friday, and that is the day that we are packing it all up into the truck.. soooo I do believe i shall get my own paint crew in to do what they can, there is lots of black that needs to be done i believe. 
i'm stressed.. real stressed.."

take this broken wings and learn to fly
all your life
you were only waiting for this moment to arrive

blackbird singin in the dead of night
take these sunken eyes and learn to see
all your life
you were only waiting for this moment to be free

blackbird, fly, blackbird, fly
into the light of a dark black night


'Cause it's a bittersweet symphony, this life
Try to make ends meet
Your a slave to money then you die
I'll take you down the only road I've ever been down
You know the one that takes you
to the places where all the things meet yeah

Words being typed almost can be heard as song in my head. :)

I'm exhausted, really exhausted. I managed to break my self lose tonight and resist the temptation to stay up chatting. I need more enegry.. way more.. why am i always so tired. I hope its not what i think it may be. meh. poor jen, sick as hell, i feel bad in a way though i'm not sure why. could hardly hear her since her voice is almost totally gone. not cool, not at all. Next wednesday, or possibly even tuesday.. i must plan something for her, i have her thinking about what it might be.. i need to think about what it might be!

"event","<font face=""Arial"" size=""2"">strong within, that is how i feel about it. its always been there, always some sort of guide to me through the last year. ever since that week, i have thought about it every day. Something around me reminds me of you and our walks. a happy moment, the only true untainted happy moment within. A friend that always seems to be there, even if we have not spoken for days, even weeks. You will remain there in my thougths wherever you may go in the world. across the oceans, i shall always be able to remember back to the nights. i do not believe we quite realize at the time what it was going to me to us, the time spent, the hours, the words. i wonder if this is what a soul mate is meant to be like.. seems to me what it should be. friend who is always there, always provides a happy memory in the darkest hours, supports you with an invisible hand. speaks words but not really spoken. back track in the footsteps, be able to remember the smell, they way in which you walked, talked, dressed, smiled.. when presented with those three, smile grew, i knew it was a good thing. kept throughout the rest of the trip, god help any who harm them. for they hold memory, of you, of I, and our times together. untainted happiness. it shall come again, do not worry about that. There shall be more walks, more talks, the support there, but not. friendship like this is something to treasure, something to believe can happen again. Maybe not top it, as that was the top, but to reach that untainted level once again. It has been a while since it was last like that, i know. If i could, i would try to achieve it again, to bring another moment of joy to you face, add another smile. 
swimming in the warm water, feeling your touch, a strengh that recharges me, brings me up from the hells of which i am in. Back to self, there.. there... your there.. i'm there... it is all that counts. 
The joint love of Radiohead, all 23 songs that i have played through my late night. now when i listen to the songs, i seem to think of you in a part of it.  I have missed listening to it, even though they were not the best of days, sitting upon the scaffolding listening to radiohead did me some good i believe.. it was there. even when i was broken down. 
I must keep to it again, it builds up, must be careful. last thing i would need would be to be broken down when time comes... would not be good. 

Now, after my thoughts did not even really come out straight, but good enough, i shall retire to bed and perhaps continue a update for this on my clie. sleep brings the eyes down.. down... dow..."

"event","<font face=""Arial"" size=""2"">It has been a while since i've watched a bond, part of the old there. Time alone watching a hero save the world and seduce the women, a good time. I actually forgot a few things during that time, also brought a few things back ;) 
Walking up onto my deck, about the last person I expected to see today. Its been a while actually, and, we again promised to go do it sometime. It is one thing that has stuck with me throughout all this time, forged into my memory and soul. It will never leave, I would not wish it to ever leave. 

Off to watch my other movie now."

"event","Wut up home slices ... tis the magnificant anna .... just started that .. doubt it will stick but thats what im gonna call myself lol 

Anywho ... im in my color separation class and there is an hour before my Spanish lab so i thought now would be as good a time as any to update about my super boring life and how it is more boring then anyone elses thus makin me the queen of boring shit ... ha, i win. 

yea so lol .... ive just been doin the school thing and man do i hate this shit ... seriosuly school is so mindnumbing ... and for me it goes two ways ... it either makes me feel like the stupidest person in the land (which granted i do have mildly retarded moments lol) or it will make me feel totally unchallenged and bored and ready for a nap -- i would also like to note that when it makes me feel stupid i wish to nap then as well lol
lately ive been feeling dumber and dumber tho ... i thinks its cause i have to deal with ppl who are all excited about what they wanna do with their degrees and actually are motivated to do something with their lives and im so confused as to y i keep feeling like im the only person who feels like i shouldnt have to decide what i wanna do with my life at 20 years old ... im comfortable with the level of responsibility i have now i dont want anything else ... change scares the magnificant anna and she can not deal with it.  I wish i could be like keller ... hes like my idol right now ... seriously lol ... i said keller ... JAMES KELLER lol ... he is so motivated and has such a clear vision for his future (granted all hes doin is sittin on a boat in some random ass contry watchin cars drive around in circles on a tv lol but at least he has that lol)... hes like makin things work for him and im still scheduling classes around watchin days of our lives and takin naps lol ... i no for a fact that i am one of the most mature ppl that i no but yet i still wanna be a 16 year old who could give a shit about what college to go to and just hang out with the midget in the the wagon all day lol ... those were the best freakin years ... these years suck my ass through a straw ... definately gotta agree with benjy on that one (side note i miss that girl so much) ... i dunno a part of me is still done with college and is ready to be a grown up (as kristen and i like to say) but then in come those damn naps again lol ... 
it doesnt help that i hate everyone in my major department cause half of em are mexican and the other half is some fucked up nationality that cant even speak english ... then of course there is the fat lady who steals books but dont get me started on her lol ... i think these ppl are discouraging me from being here which sucks cause i no i can be good at this ... i mean .. i actually understand all this shit about color gametes and offest lithographic prepress and screening techniques ... my major is actually pretty cool cause its so hands on but god these ppl make me want to kill myself or declare a new major (which at this point in my junior year is no longer an option so i guess i must chose death lol) ... if i were to change to a department i think id stick to business management ... im pretty good in that stuff plus i like to be in charge and in control of ppls lives and such lol im sure a quality that is not favored by all of my fans lol ... or id do some type of psychology (but not the boring research crap giacomo is doing ... sorry babe but omg lol) ... i like to listen to ppls stories and then decide why they are fucked up and then judge them lol im SOOO good at that lol -- yet another one of those favorable qualities lol ... i dunno now im thinkin i wanna go come back after graduate school and like do continuing education in those feilds or something ... i wanna do a little bit of everything cause like giacomo said im pretty good at a little bit of everything ... blah 

ok so theres that lol ... ranted for about an hour on how useless my schooling is lol ... now on to more exciting things ... for me anyway cause im the only one who reads this (yes i read my own journal im a vain piece of shit so get over it lol) ... i just got back from visiting giacomo and let me tell u i heart that kid more then i heart all the monkies and tacos in the world ... i heart everything about our relationship ... the way we no so much about each other, the way hes like the girl and im like the boy, the way he listens and i dont lol, the way we do crossword puzzles even tho he wont let me cheat lol, they way we fight is always entertaining lol, the way we annoy the shit out of each other to the point of extreme hatred then 5 seconds later its all good, the way he crushes me in my sleep lol, the way he takes care of me and actually DOES feel sympatheitc to me despite what his stupid ass may think and say and even act sometimes ... i even love the way he dresses even tho i hate the two toned shoes and the jerseys and the damn hate (sorry but its all the time giacomo lol) ... plus we have the bestest sex lol ... not that i have anything to compare it to but i imagine all great sex is like this lol ... hes so pretty and im thinkin thats all for the mushy segment of my life 

my hands are gettin tired and crampy and im five seconds im gonna have carpal tunel lol so ... tis time for me to say goodbye to all my company ... now im gonna have that damn mickey mouse club song stuck in my head ... peace out homies

just got back from playin some late night tennis with keller on a randomly lit basketball court in the boonies of howell ... very very safe ... specially with all the bats lol 
-- ladies if ur wondering ... Keller will not protect u in case of danger lol 

it was such good times ... i heart when that kid comes home ... such good conversations for two hours of the worst tennis playin ever lol 

one key thing to remember from the night tho is:
Anna: i dont no y ppl wanna have sex tho ... cause u make weird faces, theres funny noises involved sometimes ... and its kinda stinky lol ... always remember keep ur windows open 
Anna: dont have drunken sex .. cause thats how u get babies ... babies and AIDS 

im a fountain of wisdom i am ... well apparently only when it comes to sex i guess lol ... hopefully Keller finds it to be useful ...

Well my fat tired ass needs to eat something and sleep for i have yet another long tireous day ahead of me lol ...

OK thats all thanks.



LOL yeah I crack myself up.  Well it's been mad amnts of work, I have a paper due next mon, tues, weds, and thurs, plus a presentation and take home test thats 4-6 pgs long.  Needless to say, I haven't gotten out much.

I did get to the gym yesterday and finally got to run on my ankle, it feels sooo stiff today but I'm glad I pushed it.  Today = the bike, glorious sitting down machine I tell ya.  I have been sucking down these liters of water, my goodness.  AND I am monstrously hungry lol.  I have the strangest urge for singapore mei fun.  Like death I want this my god.

So what else, well there's always drama, but I choose to internalize it or just tell Anna.  So ha.

Speaking of which, I had a most excellent political discussion with that girl, and for future reference, political science will now be known as chicken and subs.  Trust me folks, it makes it a whooole lot interesting, and I'm a political science major.  Speaking of which, debates tonite, should be extremely boring, I'm looking forward to it lol.

Ok time to get back to my buttload of work, maybe I'll convince my roomie to go out and get some dinner w/me off campus, I'm not feelin the on campus food today....

So I've decided that Anna and I have started this journal craze.  I mean seriously, we had one (well maybe we were like 3rd) and now EVERYONE has them....and so many talk about their feelings and love and unicorns and glitter.  Thats weird lol.

But whatever my life's not much more exciting so I choose to talk about MY feelings and dolphins and beams of light that move around the room and u try to figure out if its something on u thats reflecting it and u think ur controlling it only to realize that its some dork next to you...

but i digress lol

So yeah finally back at Drew, had a big dilemma w/my classes and stuff, but thats all taken care of thank god...so now i just gotta hunker down and do some work, LOTS and LOTS of reading but hopefully I can figure it out.

Hung w/that man of mine, hes awesome...the things he does for me....makes me smile....I've come to the realization that relationships have potential to actually get BETTER over time, as opposed to my theory that it just dwindles down and you get bored after a week....so yeah thats a good thing to kno now right?

so me thinx thats about it...im off to do some (u guessed it) reading...god this mumbo jumbo is boring, but im only doing it cuz my roomie (who by the way is the new indian exchange student on the partridge family) told me to

BUT there of course is a plus .... in my organization and management class (dont ask me what it is i have no clue lol) there is this amazing male being ... his name is darren and he is this spectacular mix of Brandon Boyd and Jesus .... it was like i was literally in an 80's brat pack movie such as sixteen candles (and i was molly ringwald only minus all the shitty red hair)... the guy walked in and this brilliant light eluminated all around him like he was glowing .... of course now i realize it is not because he was sent to me from God but because there were no lights on in the class room and the hallway light was pretty much doin that to everyone who came into the class lol ... but whatever ... HIS NAME IS DARREN ... AS IN DARREN BOYD, BRANDONS BROTHER ... i mean COME ON!!!!!!!!!!!! I told giacomo ... i dont think he cared so much cause he was playin football AND he was more intrigued by me using Jesus as a description of this person lol ....

"event","wut up homies, long time no write if i must say so myself.  but my life does not give me enough time to just sit here writtin every little thought every second of every day like some people.  alas though, today im feeling particularly chatty with no one to chat to so here i be at last resort central .... ::thumbs up and cheesy smile:: 

where to begin .... 

seein as how i cant remember past a week ago we shall start with the moment my summer began .... INCUBUS DAY #2!!!!  (which incidentally turned out to be Kellers birthday as well and a happy birthday to u my friend ... even tho u were there with me its always fun to have a Live Journal shout out).  Friday the midget, musto, keller, and i ventured out to the city to the glorious Madison Square Garden to see my future husbad and his band mates play.  anywho, semi long story short, a.) we were late to the train cause keller is slow, b.) pistola will never be anyones favorite song cause musto and kelle ruined it times 10, c.) we got to ""meet"" Co-Nan Obrien lol and keller and musto got to put their ass on his chair and the wet dreams continue from there for those two lol, d.) it monsooned (sp?) but we got to eat candy and chill out and look over the city and Keller and I are livin together in the city one day cause we rock its ass, e.) i bought brandons book and am one step closer to being his wife, f.) incubus rocked sooooo hardcore the show was fn amazing ... and Dave Chappele is their new basist lol, g.) the starbucks by the stairwell in penn station the goes from the LIRR and then to Amtrack SUCKS CAUSE OF MEXICANS ... goddamn mother f-ers almost ruining Incubus Day #2, and h.) apparently complete fucktards listen to incubus cause there were some dumb drunk and high mother fuckers on the train ride home that needed for me to kick there ass ....
that was about it for the first Incubus Day ... well that and i put my tampon in wrong and during the concert it kept fallin out of my vag hole ... but other then that ... INCUBUS ROCKED ASS!!!!!!!

whateve ... saturday was a chill laid back day; keller, court, musto, his cousin Andrea, and i were supposed to go to the beach and hang but court, musto, and andrea didnt go cause her car bitched out .. whateve .. me and keller chilled for awhile then came back cause our asses were tired lol ... blah blah ... end of that day 

sunday, had work early which sucked, went to giacomos house at 5 ... watched Six Feet Under ... had some sex ... went home ... end of that day ... (like how i snuck the sex in there lol funny i am lol)

monday, Incubus Day #2 ... hopped in a car with Musto, his friend Tim, and Court and drove off to Pennsyl-tucky to the Wachovia Arena to see my future husband serenade me and a bunch of other ppl lol ... we stopped by Jersey Mikes first cause musto and Tim wanted free sammiches ... me and court sat in the car and a convertable BMW thingy that was silver pulled up next to our car and some fat ridiculous middle aged man (probably with no penis) got out ... he left his top down and that CLEARLY screams ""throw something into my car"" so ... court gave me a piece of gum and needless to say that went right into his back seat LOL ... most excellent lol ... so then we got to pennsyl-tucky hung out there found a pisser, found a starbucks, Tim got a ticket for underage drinkin (for the love of GOD y do ppl NEED alcohol with every move they make), i decided to go on the Mary Kate Olsen Diet cause of all the twigs in the tucky of pennsly lol ... then incubus came on and all of my doubts and worries were gone and away, they sang My Girl and SPONGEBOB SQUARE PANTS ... i heart Brandon ::dream face::
oo and lastly i bought the 40 dollar tshirt i wanted and if i must say so myself i am super hot in it lol ... fuck yea ... u bitches are all jealous ... word ... LOL what did i just say lol ....

tuesday, hung out with giacomo but felt slightly depressed, watched the second season of The Office with him ... had some more sex ... then went to work to chill with kelly but alas we had to work with the fn specials but whateve fun times with Kel .... end of tuesday ... (again slipped in the sex ... muhahahaha lol)

now today (wednesday), woke up with a severe migraine at 330 in the AM .. was supposed to go to work at 9 but couldnt cause i was vomiting and tryin to be the only one who cared if i lived or died at the moment ... got to work at 1 by the grace of God, but of course the tumor in my head was makin me woosie so i left at 350 with rich (i was supposed to leave at 5 ...) laid in bed more today watched some tv and after a day of one imitrex tablet and two excedrin migraines im finally feelin better altho i still wanna vomit up my life ... so maybe im not so much doin the mary kate diet but still ... there aint no food in me ... lol 

... now that was a run down of my week ... now on to the fun stuff ... whats really inside me .... (besides guts and blood and gas and stuff) 

side note: the episode where brad pitt is on friends is on ... MOST EXCELLENT DAY

anyway ... i am annoyed for two reasons .... 
1.) i realized that today my life has turned into a Dawsons Creek episode or something and ... IM THE DAWSON!!!!!!!!! ... how sad is that ... i always thought that if i ever stumbled upon a dawsons creek show i would be Jen cause shes an independant and intellegent female figure with the coolest gay best friend ever ... but no ... im the fn DAWSON and its all part of some evil joke made by God or ... the WB or something ... lol ... and whos my Joey u ask ... Courtney Stockdale ... and her Pacey is clearly Musto ... i opt to not go into details but anyone who has ever sat down on a wednesday nite to watch the creek for four or five years of their life will no the battle of the relationships betweeen joey, pacey, and THE DAWSON ... (minus the joey and dawson goin out thing cause me and court are ladies ... sick minded freaks lol) ... 
so my goal is to bring this up top court cause i have lived for three years as the dawson apparently and im not about to do this any longer ....

2.) so im sick and dying and would like nothing more then for my wonderful boyfriend to come and hug me and kiss me and just for a minute make me not feel like im alone and dying of a brain tumor ... but no ... i called to ask him to just hug me if he had to pick up dinah cause hes playin cards with dinah and bill ... he said of course sure i love ... then i asked if he would do it even if he didnt hafta pick up dinahs lazy ass and his response was ""o but uh .. ::insert some story about calling bill back and playin cards with his father that has nothing to do with the question that i asked him::"" ... and here i am still waiting at 1130 in the PM thinkin he might give a shit ... but apparently cards are more important ... thats cool ... 
i dont get it ... sometimes they are the sweetest beings on the face of the planet and want nothing more but to see u happy and love u and have u love them and yadda yadda yadda ... insert a beer can (or in giacomos case scotch or some shit thats brown and tastes like gasoline) a deck of cards and money and apparently the sick girlfriend is no longer worth a 15 minute car ride ... 
i guess its sorta the same way cause when i have my period and giacomos in long island i am the biggest bitch in the world ... but still if he was sick id go see him if he asked me ... even if he didnt ... boys are mean to me .... 
one day me and rich are gonna run away to california and live with brandon boyd ... ::dreamy far away look:: 

so me thinks thats it for today cause u no what im feelin nauseous and my legs hurt and i gotta wake up and go to work at 6 tomorrow ... IN THE AM ... so ... peace out kiddies ... its been real

Brittany Spears is the most fucked up person in the world ... for some reason MTV is on the tube and i had to witness her video for yet another song she can not sing ... 

Somehow promoting suicide now is her new thing ... must be part of this lesbianic, man stealing, drunken freak, kabalha worshiping shit she has goin on now ... the fact that she fuckin laughs and shit at the end of it makes me wish she did in fact die ... i dont understand how someone this retarded and fake and phoney can be a freakin idol to young girls ... it makes me nauseous ... i fart on her ...

and yes i did opt to ignore the fact that whilst she ""died"" some random ugly baby was born ... who gives a shit the video SUCKS MY ASS ....

"event","So im sittin here watchin Saved by the bell (cause it came on after Dawsons Creek and CLEARLY im a loser lol) and it is still so great and funny and ZANY lol after all these years ... the acting is horrible but i still wanna bang Zack Morris(in that 12 year old girl whos idea of ""banging"" is holding hands and kissing kinda way lol)... 

i have also decided that if my life were like saved by the bell here is the cast of characters:

Slater - Richard cause hes the ethnic looking muscle guy jock lol
Screech - definately Keller because hes a goober and they make the same faces lol
Kelly - Kelly at work cause shes a goody goody girl who everyone loves lol
Lisa - me cause im the only black girl and i heart shopping lol 
Jesse - Kristen cause they have frizzy hair and well cause clearly Kris is gonna be a stripper slut one day lol
Zack - Giacomo only cause the best episode was when Zack and Lisa wanted to do it LOL ... ;-) (even tho giacomo is the exact opposite of Zack me thinks lol and in reality im sure Dinah would be Zack lol sorry babes) 
Mr. Belding - Elaine (my boss) cause shes a dumb shit lol 

im thinkin thats how it would go ... based on the people i no and their personalities and such ... plus this was more fun the studyin for Human Resource Management lol

"event","today, i feel, is a very inspirational and uplifting day ... so i am writing in this pos journal so all like two ppl who read this can feel inspirational and uplifted as well ;-) 

i have been feelin shitty lately ... feelings that come and go but seem to linger on longer then they go away ... its depressing when i think that my boyfriend is in another state, all i do is work and go to school and have no time for my friends and people in my life that really matter ... im just a generally bored individual i guess ...

today im drivin home from school and its gorgeous out, not too hot cause theres a breeze but sunny and beautiful, even driven through union, roselle, and rahway lol (trust me if uve been to any of these places u'd no that beauty is not the first word u think of lol) ... im stopped at a light on Elmora Ave (a street none of u no im sure but its a shithole) and theres this little old lady hobbling around the sidewalk ... she had to be in her 80s and she was wearin an oversized grey zip up sweatshirt, a knee length pink skirt, and running sneakers with her socks pulled up to the top of the sneakers .... she was so adorable and so sad and i probably could have watched her all day ... but after seein her hobbling, cause apparently shes old and bones suck when ur 80, i was lookin at everything around me differently (as i normally do when im touched by something) ... old couples with crazy outfits walkin down the side walk holding hands, the way that one tree separates as telephone lines pass through it and u wouldnt have noticed it (and hadnt noticed it ever) if the tiny white flowers wherent making the tree stand out on St. George Ave next to a run down gas station ... 

it seems like everything around me was tellin me that my probelms and issues with boredum were just stupid shit excuses and meant nothing in the big picture of things and showed me how selfish and obnoxious i can be ... we all can be ... 

and im not a religious person in the ""normal"" sense of that word religious but i looked around and i wonder how could Keller be agnostic when clearly something big cool and awesome had to create all this shit we see whether it be beautiful in that general ""flowers, sunshine and of course dolphins"" way (for Kris and I lol) or in the way an old woman hobbling in confusion on a street corner can change my entire outlook on life and myself and not even no it ... 

things are just amazing to me today and as much as i think this i really need to concentrate on making myself that beautiful being that can change someones life without knowing it .... i dunno how much sense that makes but thinkin about it is makin me feel better ... 

maybe im just full of shit today lol who knows but even if i am ... its something i like to think about cause it takes my mind off those stupid shit excuses and makes me focus on whats really important for me right now ... 

its cold in here and i want to nap now ... lol --no matter how much i try i cant stop the lazy lol ... 

peace homies

... when we were freshman on that stupid first day and we had all of those homosexual orientation games to play and somehow me and kristen became instant friends lol
... when the midget was originally the little girl with really high heeled shoes 
... when Chris Reily was in all of my classes freshman year, we had the same birthday, i hated him and got him kicked out of Ganey's religion class on the first day
... when Musto used to have gelled hair and all the slutty howell girls called him Andrew, and he went out with all of them 
... when Jamie O'Keefe and I were friends (WTF lol)
... when Christina Kerr and I were friends 
... when we first discovered that Mike Sober looked like a Bob Sagat clone and from freshman year till forever he will be known only as Bob ... or of course Sober
... when Clayton Keith (aka Keith lol) was the dorkiest but most loveable kid on the planet and he did really weird things with his fingers 
... when cathy poss never spoke lol
... when Keller met Brock and all hell had broken loose on the Honors class weirdos 
... when Benjy was one of those Honors class weirdos lol 
... when Ryan Phillips smelled 
... when Steph Morra brought in doggy porn into Mrs. Monaghan's class (aka crazy Monaghan who misses Meagan)
... when we would have ""Pep Rallys"" and be the only class that didnt cheer 
... when one math class (mine lol) had three different math teachers in one year and until finally we got stuck with Semple (and for some of us on backwards days we had him for History AND Math -- again me and chris reily lol)
... Mr. Semple ... period lol 
... when we first discovered that Mr. Kelien wasnt ""gay"" ... but his girlfriend was a model 
... when Heather Tapias boobs fell out of her shirt and John Evans spread it around like wild fire lol 
... when John Evans pole danced for us at Great Adventure (for those of u who missed out ... man was he HOT for a freshman lol)
... when Heather Tapia and I went on the Buckaneer 8 times at GA and have the most good awful picture of us to prove it lol 
... when freshman year was over ... and we were sophomore ;-)

"event","... its nice and quiet in here, cept for the sound of the rain and such, calming atmosphere for me to write me thinks ... 

i have my period ... and ive been told numorous times that i am my bitchiest durin that period ... i dont deny it but what am i supposed to do shit happens specially when ur on the pill ... also when im ""perioding"" it becomes alot easier for me to vent shit ... go figure lol 

i have decided to be annoyed at everyone in my life at the current moment ... not really everyone but the majority ... 

there comes a point in life when u realize u give more then u get and it will always be that way ... i have reached this path with people in the past and never really could figure out a way to deal with it ... instead i continued to build up this wall of hatred (that is now known as ANNA) to protect myself ... im tired of doin that, instead id rather just ignore the issue and step away from it and deal with the fact that some people just cant be the friend u want them to be ... not that they are bad people ... they just arent where u are i guess ... its a shame but shit happens 

then there are the people u step away from for months on end and they were all the friend u ever needed in the world and when u realize how stupid and rediculous u both had been, uve missed out on months of laughter and good times (in grandpa jorge) ... it seems to me tho that those friendships never really die ... they take breaks and pick up the pieces later on and stuff ... its funny how i never fully realized that the only person who understood me more then my parents, relate to me more then our significant others lol, and love me as much as i love them (in the non-flaming way of course lol) was my little one and even with our absence and what have u we both realize how life just doesnt seem to fit without each other ... i heart that little person sometimes more then i heart myself (and even the honch ....) ... i miss her mom :-( ... 

anywho ..

aslo i have grown bored of this constant pesimistic cynical attitude that i have grown into ... i mean its fine sometimes but thats not the person i wanna be and in all honesty thats not the person i am ... its a front i put up to make people feel intimidated or make them think that im tougher then what i really am ... i am a giant pile of fucked up emotions that will NEVER go away unless i deal with them .. and this attitude i have is years of bullshit and lies that i had encountered not only from peers but from my family and that hasta be the worst ... i like myself maybe about 60 percent of the time (hey its more then half) and its cause i like the fact that i can be independent but still need to have one person as a crutch sometimes ... i like that i can be honest and straight forward and not live my life in a hypocritical matter ... i like the fact that i can claim to be a ""non-practicing catholic"" but still have more faith in God than those who were deemed ""God-squaders"" ... im very secure in myself to state the obvious and be the honest girl whos not going to take no for an answer and whos never gonna let people walk all over her ... but im just tired of the way i go about it sometimes ... something to change ... something to work on ... hopefully i can never be bored (being judgemental and critizing characters ... that my friends will never change sorry lol im too good at it lol it would be a sin) ....

besides my constant state of depression lately and spirts of headaches and sudden extreme bouts of stress ... i am failry well ... specially since i just got a brand spanky new car .... of course sayin goodbye to grandpa jorge will be too difficult for me to even consider right now but ... im really tryin to concentrate on that new car smell ... 

Im gonna get my incubus tickets tomorrow ... im only gettin 4 cause i be poor ... and no one but me seems to be excited about this concert ... so even if i go by myself it will be a great experiance .... 

i think im done for today ... im totally tired and cramping and i wanna eat popcorn or cake lol ... or even both ... MMM or pizza ... 

so peace yall and thanks for reading ...

6. Blood On The Ground - (4:34)
I don't wanna talk to you anymore
I'm afraid of what I might say
I bite my tongue every time you come around
Cause blood in my mouth beats blood on the ground

Hand over my heart I swear
I've tried everything I could within all my power
2 weeks and 1 hour
I slaved and now I've got nothing to show
oh if only you've grown taller than a brick wall
from now on, gonna start holding my breath
when you come around and you flex that fake grin
cause something inside me has said more than twice
that breathing this air beats breathing you at all

I don't wanna talk to you anymore
I'm afraid of what I might say
I bite my tongue every time you come around
Cause blood in my mouth beats blood on the ground

Hand over my mouth
I'm earning the right to my silence
in quiet discerning between ego and timing
good judgment is once again proving to me
that it's still worth its weight in gold
from now on I'm gonna be so much more weary
when you start to speak and my warm blood starts to boil
seeing you is like pulling teeth
and hearing your voice is like chewing tin foil

I don't wanna talk to you anymore
I'm afraid of what I might say
I bite my tongue every time you come around
Cause blood in my mouth beats blood on the ground

I'm fast to a better judgment
by saying less today
I will gain more, gain more
no tears to you my, my fickle friend, yeah
you you you you, you brought the art of silent war

I don't wanna talk to you anymore
I'm afraid of what I might say
I bite my tongue every time you come around
Cause blood in my mouth beats blood on the ground 



its good ... u all must get this song now .... 

i am bored and giacomo wont give me kisses .... i get to see the midget tomorrow and im so excited ... i have a knot in my back and i wish it would die .... im tired ....

That title up there pretty much describes my day lol ... periods are so pretty ....

I am not happy today ... i was this morning just like i was in a happy loving decent mood since monday ... but things make me sad ... ppl make me sad ... i dont like ppl or things ....

Kris, of course, might disagree that i was in a bad mood cause i woke her this morning with random rants lol ... but despite my freakin exams that made me hurt and besides all the bad drivers and foreign ppl and fat ugly girls with their loud music i was all loving and happy and now .... i just dont get it .... im sure im just being ""stupid"" but ... im never like this when the period comes ud think that the honch would take advantage of that .... 

i am now sad and hafta work in the morning so im goin to bed ... 

boys make me sad sometimes .... 

::curtsies::


ps. i have the worst back pains in the world ...and i was STILL in a happy mood ... not anymore tho now im just sad and in pain .... 
pps. i am sorry to keller for not updating with exciting news lol ... please forgive me ... 
ppps. trista and ryan will be divorced in 5 minutes cause they did it all for the cameras and they dont even like each other AND that gay sand thing was the most retarded thing ever ... not to mention the fact that their wedding was so boring i wanted to stab my eyes out to have something to do ...."

"event","Whoa I haven't been on here to update in a while...it has become the Anna journal lol...well i guess thats what happens when I lead the most boring life known to mankind.  Meh whatever

Ooo last nite I did stuff.  That is all lol

No really so yeah Holiday Ball funness...good times, I got told I was hot and gorgeous by the one kid I thought hated me lol.  But whatever so we danced together most of the nite.  Also got to dance w/my girlies ... Swetha was my date cuz neither one of us had actual dates cuz we're clearly awesome.  Got Rach out on the dance floor for like the most ever w/Shane...always fun aaaaaaaaand Linda bean is a better dancer than me and thus should teach me how to dance.  So yeah I apparantly said random things like ""I'm gorgeous"" to Chris, and I totally dont remember that...one of those nites I guess.  

So then we got back at like 1 am and I continued my scandalous affair that will remain confidential lol.  Got a little weird tho...some questions just put thoughts in my head that aren't good, and then I get weird and then the whole situation gets weird.  Weird.  But idk, sometimes for once things don't have to be so defined and rigid...whatever thats what scandal is for I guess...stupid ppl"

"event","Wut up homies,

There was snow ... in case no one saw it ... and this was my saturday in it:
1.) got up cause i had a bad dream in which i was pushed off giacomos high bed many times and then some scary ghost thing was trying to kill me and trap me in a house with dead ppl ... weird shit for 8 in the morning ...
2.)walked to my kitchen ... screamed ""hey"" in a half wake zombie like state .... made my mom walk across the kitchen, then get bored of her presence ... walked back to my room and layed down
3.)watched the end of Miss Congeniality ... Benjamin Bratt = Hott ... even courts mom wanted a piece 
4.)got out of bed and watched a documentary on AIDS on VH! in the living room whilst eating popcorn at 11 in the AM .... 
5.)finshed the AIDS doc and popcorn ... ate a bowl of frosted flakes cereal and stared at the tv and computer till i was done with that ....
6.)called denise at work and found out no one was workin with me tonight ... AWESOME!!!!!!!!
7.)unburied my car and my moms car ... and took a shower
8.)went to work an hour and a half early and ate a cinnamon raison bagel with butter ..... 
9.)ate a piece of cake ...
10.) called giacomo ... he hates me i think 
11.) ::hours of not workin go by in which i call giacomo two more times even tho he hates me i think lol::
12.) got super horney, sat on the floor in front of the mirror puttin on lipstick and makin myself look presentable in case Justin Timberlake was makin a stop at the store to make out with me ... (oooo i should also mention at this point i think i might have been goin crazy cause i had eaten a salad, french fries, and an ice cream from mcdonalds ... not to mention i was delusional from the horney)
13.)had micheal drive me around the store in a return cart -- it hurt my sensitive posterior ... 
14.) called dan to tell him i miss him and called john to call him a gooey vagina with a yeast infection ...
15.) ::more hours of not doin shit at work:: 
16.) came home and ate a piece of eggplant parm and two pieces of sausage 
17.) now talkin to giacomo even tho we never have fun and he hates me LOL ... 

so i guess it was a productive day ... or something ... who knows it was fun at points and i wanted to die at others ... a regular day only full of snow ... 

im bored with this so peace out...

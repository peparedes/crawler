"event","havent updated all that recently... o well, im sure no one minds... i mean do ppl even read this, doubt it, who would care to?... anyhoo, for the sake of myself, ill just pretend that someone reads this & actually cares.. so, yea... umm... not too much to say i guess... lets see..
thursday- stayed afterskoo, hung wit amy... we went to watch ray bowl, it was cool.. i understand how it works now(playing in a league, not just bowling, im not that stupid)... & when they was done(we won), we went to the room with the pool table & were in there for a lil.. it was me, amy, ray, pat, & (sadly) dave... he hit amy, so she was pissed at him, i was annoyed, but him hitting someone isnt news to me.. but other than that, it was alrite.. then when they left, me & amy went to friendlys... we ate, then walked bac to the skool for youth group.. it was kinda stupid, cause it had to do with sex.. o well
friday- went home after skool, but then went to amys & chilled... we watched some of resident evil until we left to go to the movies(to see meet the fockers).. it ended up being just us basically, some other ppl were there we knew, but cause of the lack of seats we didnt sit with them & they left rite after pretty much.. still it was pretty fun.. 'cept the ppl next to us.. eh, the one kid kept hitting on amy & then his friend did for him.. then he started tlking to me.. & the one kid kept hooking up with his gf, it was so annoying & i felt bad for amy... afterwards we waited around til we got picked up
saturday- went to the movies to see white noise with amy, max, jess, ray, monica, elissa, lisa, nicole, alyssa, pat, christine.. it was fun, but the movie itself was bad, it wasnt scary, & the actual plot & junk didnt fully make sense, they like left out alot of info.. anyways, after we walked to willowbrook & ate & chilled.. then it was closing so we left.. went to the ice hockey game, it was cool.. at one point me amy & alyssa went in the arcade.. amy & me played DDR, i suck at it tho.. DP won!! (4-1), but it was great cause we played against Wayne Valley & my cuz is on the team.. my aunt had to drive me home too.. it was great, i was so mean, i made fun of them, arent i such a good person? lol..
sunday- ccd meeting, 2 1/2 hours, about sex... basically- sex is bad, dont have sex, if u have sex u'll die... thats what they were teaching, good stuff.. so stupid.. anyways
monday- sucked, alot... it was horrible... i felt like crap all day.. i just wanted to cry or die cause then things stop... it was so bad.. i felt all alone, & no one would let me tlk, i couldnt tlk to anyone... but, i suppose i should be used to that.. no one really ever listens anyways, even when they do listen.. in the back of everyones minds is always their own problems, they never really focus much on anything else.. no matter how petty their problem(s) is(are), it consumes them & they never really conider that thing may very well be worse for u, so yea.. it sucked... 
tuesday(today)- ehh, it was alrite... not as bad as yesterday.. so of course i pretended to be betterer.. like always.. ur really never allowed to be (openly) upset for more than a day or two.. otherwise, ppl get really annoyed at u, & then things get worse, so yea.. & dont say that thats not true, cause i kno first hand that it is.. anyways... found out some REALLY good news today.. but what sux is that i really wanted to stay after skool today for awhile but they made us all go home cause everything was cancelled.. but do they let us out early? noooo, of course not... errrr... anyhoo.. yea... but i guess it was too bad... well, ill go mr notreallythere... tty sometime again... toodles xox ~Jen       <3 if only u could see that we are meant to be <3  lol"

Quote a song lyric that sums up your year 

I walk a lonely road
The only one that I have ever known
Don't know where it goes
But it's home to me and I walk alone

I walk this empty street
On the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
Where the city sleeps
and I'm the only one and I walk alone

I walk alone
I walk alone

I walk alone
I walk a...

My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
'Til then I walk alone

Ah-ah, Ah-ah, Ah-ah, Aaah-ah,
Ah-ah, Ah-ah, Ah-ah

I'm walking down the line
That divides me somewhere in my mind
On the border line
Of the edge and where I walk alone

Read between the lines
What's fucked up and everything's alright
Check my vital signs
To know I'm still alive and I walk alone

I walk alone
I walk alone

I walk alone
I walk a...

My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
'Til then I walk alone"

Do you ever feel like breaking down?
Do you ever feel out of place?
Like somehow you just don't belong
And no one understands you
Do you ever wanna runaway?
Do you lock yourself in your room?
With the radio on turned up so loud 
That no one hears you screaming

No you don't know what it's like
When nothing feels all right
You don't know what it's like
To be like me

To be hurt
To feel lost
To be left out in the dark
To be kicked when you're down
To feel like you've been pushed around
To be on the edge of breaking down
And no one's there to save you 
No you don't know what it's like
Welcome to my life

Do you wanna be somebody else?
Are you sick of feeling so left out?
Are you desperate to find something more?
Before your life is over
Are you stuck inside a world you hate?
Are you sick of everyone around?
With their big fake smiles and stupid lies
While deep inside you're bleeding

No you don't know what it's like
When nothing feels all right
You don't know what it's like
To be like me

To be hurt
To feel lost
To be left out in the dark
To be kicked when you're down
To feel like you've been pushed around
To be on the edge of breaking down
And no one's there to save you 
No you don't know what it's like
Welcome to my life

No one ever lied straight to your face
No one ever stabbed you in the back
You might think I'm happy but I'm not gonna be okay
Everybody always gave you what you wanted
Never had to work it was always there
You don't know what it's like, what it's like

To be hurt
To feel lost
To be left out in the dark
To be kicked when you're down
To feel like you've been pushed around
To be on the edge of breaking down
And no one's there to save you 
No you don't know what it's like (what it's like)

To be hurt
To feel lost
To be left out in the dark
To be kicked when you're down
To feel like you've been pushed around
To be on the edge of breaking down
And no one's there to save you 
No you don't know what it's like
Welcome to my life
Welcome to my life
Welcome to my life"

There's just one thing I need
I don't care about presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true...
All I want for Christmas
Is you...

I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need
I don't care about presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
I don't need to hang my stocking
There upon the fireplace
Santa Claus won't make me happy
With a toy on Christmas day
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you...
You baby

I won't ask for much this Christmas
I won't even wish for snow
I'm just gonna keep on waiting
Underneath the mistletoe
I won't make a list and send it
To the North Pole for Saint Nick
I won't even stay awake to
Hear those magic reindeer click
'Cause I just want you here tonight
Holding on to me so tight
What more can I do
Baby all I want for Christmas is you
You...

All the lights are shining
So brightly everywhere
And the sound of children's
Laughter fills the air
And everyone is singing
I hear those sleigh bells ringing
Santa won't you bring me the one I really need -
won't you please bring my baby to me...

Oh I don't want a lot for Christmas
This is all I'm asking for
I just want to see baby
Standing right outside my door
Oh I just want him for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
Baby all I want for Christmas is
You...

All I want for Christmas is you baby~*

Like you have a secret but,<br>everyone has secrets that they don't want<br>anyone to know. So don't be ashamed if you<br>think you weird but, your not. It's cool being<br>mysterious like you might have cool<br>techniques:)

They possessed<br>the ability to transform into any creature,<br>though they would often retain their fox tail.<br>One could easily determine the age and level of<br>maturity of a kitsune by counting it's tails;<br>An immature, rambunctious kitsune would have<br>very few tails, while a wise and powerful one<br>would have as many as nine.

As a kitsune, you are clever, sensual, beautiful,<br>mysterious and effeminate (even if you are a<br>guy). You are also somewhat sneaky and like to<br>pull pranks on people, but otherwise you are<br>very pleasurable to be around.

No one tends to<br>know quite what to think of you because you<br>camouflage your emotions so incredibly well,<br>almost as well as your thoughts. You are<br>unpredictable in that no one knows exactly what<br>your going to do or what your capable of and<br>you've made sure they never will. You are quite<br>the wallflower but deep down inside is a kind<br>and very intelligent person. You are capable of<br>love but unless you let some light into your<br>shadowed life you'll have a hard time with your<br>relationships. People are a mystery only<br>because they all seem too superficial, you<br>would rather be somewhere else, away from all<br>the noise perhaps putting your feelings into a<br>form of art, maybe writing your feelings into a<br>poem or journal, or perhaps painting a picture.<br>The shadows make you feel comfortable and you<br>don't like to step outside your comfort zone or<br>let anyone else in, the spotlight terrifies<br>you. You are truly a mystery.

this part u can ignore::
well, earlier i was looking forward to this entry, i was gonna be like yea, im kinda better.. but now i dunno.. its like im better & worse all at the same time.. i think i would have been better, 'cept that some things and people prevented that..
like for dinner today, i had to call my mom & ask her to bring something.. some other ppl wanted wendys too, so i was gonna have her bring food for them too.. well, b4 i could even reach my mom, they left for music min., well, it turns out that my mom is extremely pissed at me cause im a selfish person, who is concerned only of myself.. i apparently do not care about the fact that my mom had just gotten home from the hospital & needed to pickup my brother.. first WTF?!?.. & second im sooo sooo soooooooo SRY that i wanted to eat a second meal for the day, u kno cause i really dont wanna die from malnutrition anytime soon... im sry, next time, ill make sure to starve.. so yea, thanx to some ppl, my mom was pissed at me.. 
yea, im so sick of someone.. all i hear from this person is hypocritical bullshit.. its wearing me out, i dont need this.. this person knows ive been practically depressed all week, yet they feel the need to bring me down with their problems including the fact how they hate ppl just like themselves but acting like theyre totally different.. what the hell is wrong with this person, theyre making things soo much worse for me.. & hearing that like everyones depressed doesnt fucking help me get better.. & i kno that alot of ppl think theyre depressed that are nowhere near it.. & i kno that alot of people can get depressed over different things... but who the fuck cares.. i dont fucking need to hear this when im in the middle of a breakdown.. my God!... u are seriously gonna kill me, or something, ur so fucked up.. 
ha, ive prolly been such a bitch lately.. im sry to alot of u guys, tho some of u i may not be sry, im not sure cause i cant rememeber who ive been a bitch too..
im sick of ppl asking me if im ok & how am i.. ok, some of u thank-u very much for it... but i kno a good majority of u really dont care.. y the hell are u sking me when the only answer u want is that im ok or just tired, leave me alone then.. i love the fact that i was just like no, cause i knew they didnt care.. but i do kno that some of u did care & i appreciate it...
i feel like my friends dont really want me around them presently cause im upset, & that makes me sadder.. im sry, its not like i wanna be like this... im sry..
& ive been really tired, & ive had bad headaches... ive been a lil sick from being emotionally & mentally upset, so physically i have been too.. & yes, that is really true, it happens..
lets see let me name some ppl that i really heart lately
i heart, i know this is gonna sounds weird & stuff coming from me, andrew at least a lil ::gasps::, yes, i kno, shocker.. but contrary to popular belief (or at least mine), he is not a self-centered, cold-hearted asshole, & yes, if u for some odd reason are reading this andrew, it is a compliement.. & thanx for the offer, ill take a rain-check tho lol.. & dont worry im not turning all 'emo' on u.. 
i am in love with mike, cause he not only gaveme my lighter back, but he put a new thing in it cause it ran out of butane.. i love u soo much.. u have no idea how happy that made me... yes, i kno i sound disturbed being happy over a lighter, but playing with them calms me down.. so yea..
& i love dan cause he awesome... & dont worry im not at all upset cause of u.. i love u after all.. & ill tell u whats wrong later as opposed to sooner..
yea.. thats kinda it for the personal shouts, & i really dont kno how i feel, so dont ask.. & i wanna say again that i do appreciate alot of u who cared.. thanx.. & ill proly be better soon, so u dont have to worry.. k, im going.. ~jen"

<P><FONT color=#ccccff size=1>wow, that felt nice.. i still feel like crap, but that was nice... yea, i was being pesimistic(sp?) today about something, just to prepare for the worst &amp; now its seems very likely that i was right.. u dont have to, but could u remember&nbsp;my family (not me) in ur prayers.. yea, so, yea...</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ccccff size=1>um... thats not it tho.. everything sux.. like i dont kno what to do anymore... people suck... guys suck.. so does dan, haha, jp, or am i?... yea, thats about all the humor i have im me for the rest of this... o well... ::sigh::... i did hardly any hw,i havent really been doing it, somehow i didnt get in too much trouble cause i thinkn God took some pity on me, our power point kicked ass... its so bad tho, i feel so bad... i dont kno why im slipping up so much</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ccccff size=1>i felt like crying all day, not only was my day bad, but so was alot of other peoples.. i was getting kinda annoyed with some people &amp; im really sorry if i flipped out on anyone... mike, i wish i knew something i could say or do to be of some help, but i dont kno, i just hope u kno im here... </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ccccff size=1>practice sucked... i almost didnt get any food, but i just managed to get it &amp; finish eating.. the it sucked cause we had to keep doing the dance over &amp; over.. i know it, i can do it in my sleep... i dont need to go over it a thousand times... &amp; no, im not mad at u, liz &amp; kaitlin, its everyone else cause they cant learn the fucking dance.. &amp; everyone feels the need to complain about it.... SHUT THE FUCK UP!!!!... God, first its a good dance &amp; its easy, ur just an idiot if u cant do it.. &amp; maybe if everyone shut-up &amp; kept their gayass coments to themsleves we'd actually be able to do it &amp; then i wouldnt have to hear u complain.. i just wanted to be able to crawl up in 'my corner"", &amp; be left alone, but nooo, jenna has to be more miserable.. i wanted to fucking stab matt &amp; travis, &amp; at first brophy.. they were yelling at dan &amp; tellin him to leave since hes not in the play.. they made hime leave, i almost cried.. im sry, but he was one of the few ppl that kept me from crying, so im sry that i didnt feel like crying.. &amp; he wasnt bothering anyone, ms gavin didnt even kno or care.. matts been such an ass lately.. i told kevin that he really sucked... i really dont care if any of them hate me, ive known them since grammer skool, im def not afraid of them... but brophy apologized &amp; said he was only doing what he had to do, i understood &amp; &nbsp;knew he meant it, so i forgave him.. hes cool like that cause our familys is friends, i explained to him that i was having a bad day, so were ok... &amp; then the fucking ppl, dont let me do my lines... no one told me when im supposed to go on &amp; when im about to someone else says my lines... so i was like screw that, &amp; so i only did the dance scenes today.. for the most part, i stayed curled up in a lil ball &amp; kept to myself, &amp; i played with my lighter alot, cause it relieves stress for me.. i mean i must have been a sad sight, cause even andrew was concerned.. so yea..</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ccccff size=1>&amp; i dont kno what to do anymore... i really like u, but i dont kno where that line is drawn.. i mean, its just, u confuse me so much... i cant ever read u, its like one mintue i think its obvious that u like me, &amp; other times, i think its clear we're just friends... do u even kno where u draw the line?.. i wish u could just let me kno how u feel, so i cant figure things ut... i dunno.... ::sigh:: </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ccccff size=1>its just i wanna cry so much &amp; im so sad... &amp; i dont kno whats wrong.. why do i feel like im always pulled into depression.. its like no matter what i do, i can never fully escape it.. theres always traces of it lurking in the depths of my mind and soul, &amp; everytime i think im finally free, it slowly eats at me again, pulling me down.. will i ever escape it?... please, let me be happy... y cant i be?... whats wrong with me???...&nbsp; ::sigh::</FONT></P>

CrAzYCuLt Psycho:  You're not willing to take the risks of testing the products, so you decide to force a poor, defenseless animal test it for you.  That's pretty mean.  Its not like the rabbit's ever going to use the stuff, at least I don't think so.  I mean, have you ever seen a rabbit hopping along the streets with hot pink hair, black eyeliner, and black nail polish? Maybe you have, but I haven't, and if you have, I'm guessing its not a frequent occurrence

~I am not~

Sometimes i am sad
Sometimes i am not
Sometimes i love u
Sometimes i hate u
I am scared
I am alone
I believe tears heal
I believe i cannot cry
I believe time heals all wounds as well
Sometimes there's just not enough time
I am confused
I am lost
Sometimes i think im better
I am not
I believe one a day a light will go on
I believe one day ill no longer be lost
I believe that day really will come
Sometimes things get better
Sometimes they get worse
I believe ill be ok
I am stupid 
I am in love
I am not
I believe someones crazy enough to love me
I believe ill find him someday
I am crazy
Sometimes i scare ppl
Sometimes they scare me
I am psycho
Sometimes i scare myself
Sometimes i laugh for no reason
Sometimes i cry for no reason
Sometimes there are reasons..

Life has been pretty good, aside from not feeling so great and another small shingles outbreak.&nbsp;
Scooby is working very hard and making pretty good money. Its nice to be with someone you can&nbsp;
count on in every way...emotionally, mentally financially.....its good.&nbsp; Forthe first time in my life
dont have my own money, its OUR money. its nice.

We're watching Little Nicky and some devil creature is pulling someone out of his nose. Yes, not my
movie choice...sigh.

We're talking about wedding locations and music. Thats about all we have down so far. hah. I dont
really care about much else...well maybe the cake.



On a completely different note:

Ive been thinking of sending letters to prisoners. Yeah,&nbsp;i&nbsp;feel bad cuz theyre all alone and&nbsp;they&nbsp;""measure their self-worth
by their amount of mail"" or so they say. Im afraid that ill be eaten by some escapee, though. hmph. things to ponder.&nbsp;"

Of course I will"" and then we just kissed and hugged for what seemed like the first time.<br /><br /><br />When I finally opened the box there was a white gold Ring with&nbsp;a Blue Topaz in the middle and 3 diamonds on each side.&nbsp;<br />Its beautiful. The most beautiful ring in the world.<br /><br /><br /><br />Im happy. Im in love.

Thank you for your service to my country

However, in good conscience, I cannot support the continuation

I feel your interests and actions

Mr. Bush
You are fired.

"event","It's the fourth of july in denver
and the men are lined up for their independence meal
it's a lonely single file, it snakes around the block
it's a packed up picnic dinner, prepared for those that liberty forgot.
and the bold bombs come sudden above the treetops
like the flashing lights of small town southern city cops
who don't like my bumperstickers
or the state that i am from
but it's the state of my head that mostly offends them
distinctly diagrammed on the ass of my station wagon
and the works of fire take their shape
big blue stars that crumple and fade
it's a super sparkly air raid
the sky hangs false with the burden of proof
bregudging allegiance to a twilight that burns
red, glare of liberation is blinding
and the line of hungry men is slowly unwinding
for their independence meal,
their independence meal.
and the mayor rolls by with the high school parade
same fourth of july smile, same city, same wave,
sucking governor cock in every same state for prison guard positions
spitting out the agenda,
crime re-construction
so now, the new prison is guarding the secret
that the plantation spirit has been keeping all these years
that you don't fool a system by renaming its face
and as far as i can tell we have still got chain gangs
black stripe prisoners right on track,
white overseers on corporate horseback
the exchange rate converted to wages unpaid
Black assets not passed
and white business sustained
yes, the new sharecrop
is the flesh and bones
behind the cell block
and the Wackenhut corpa-prison sits right on an old plantation
birthed right over the slave graves in that soil
a true African mother, but its step-father is Reaganomics,
a barren corporate heiress delivering a lineage of toxins
like the Rockafeller drug laws
safeguarding first offense and strict parole
you gotta do what you gotta do to ensure prisons stay full
so you inject steel bars in those hard to reach places
where poetry. teachers. and reparations should have fit
and you bust the asses of smoking smiling faces
while the assets of glassy eyed coke-sniffers sit safe
savoring their indendence meal,
their white lined independence meal.
how long can a country trip the wire of its legacy
before the alarm is finally decoded
corporate burglars swindling palms caught frozen,
with all of the lives, all the earth they have stolen,
and we know it, we know it, yes
even the suburban skies know it,
in this scrupulous cul de sac of a Century
just turn the corner, the stars are packing up mercilessly.
and i'm staring up at the bombs bursting in air
and i'm pondering the reverance for the ramparts red glare
and i'm wondering how relevant ramparts are
cause divided we stand and together we're falling
on this fourth of july in denver,
i proudly hail the twilight's last gleaming
as i stand sadly white skinned in the perilous beaming
embarrassed and ashamed at what my people have been doing
a progeny of hostages, chattelry grooming
like cattle, like the trade block, like death row
men lined up for their last independence meal
their last independence meal.
it's the fourth of july in denver
and the sky is bursting
the sky is bursting."

there was a homeless man carrying a bag
standing against the wall.
I gave him a one dollar bill because
i couldnt find anymore money in my
pockets.
When I got inside I found a five
and proceeded to walk outside
hoping the man would still be out there.
I saw him half a block or so away
and when I finally caught up with him
he threw his hands up
and said ""i didnt mean no harm, m'am""
this was both confusing
and depressing as I told him
that i just wanted to give him the five
i thought i had earlier.
He blessed me then asked where my coat
was.

"event","It's been too long since I've posted. Let's see if I still got it.


Well 2007 was quite a year. In January, bills had to be paid. Woo hoo. February brought about Valentines and a special message to a dear friend. March saw the end of another school quarter and the start of my seniority at school. April sucked. May was awesome. ACEN, Pirates 3. A new computer. Oh yeah. That rocked. June saw the end of another quarter and a stressful end at that. Lost a lot of sleep there, but got the job done. July saw absolutely nothing. August saw the continuation of a cosplay costume. September saw AWA 13 and the unveiling of the cosplay costumes that had been so hardly worked on and stressed over. October saw another Halloween as a pirate. November brought about Thanksgiving and such. And lastly, December saw both tragedy and joy.

So basically January up to March pretty much sucked. Started plans for a new cosplay costume in January. A Master Chief (Halo) project that we sought to complete by May for an unveiling at ACEN. Well that didn't go as planned as work took longer then expected. Hand drawing every last part and cutting it out layer by layer from matte board and then gluing the layers together and then making the right shapes and then comes the fiber glass... The worst part of the project.

Well May comes around and of course the suit is no where near being complete, still lacking a chest and torso and the parts for the helmet haven't arrived yet even though they were ordered in mid-April. So it looks like it's to plan B. Go as Capt. Jack Sparrow and his trusty sidekick Will Turner.

Ah, ACEN... A 2 hour plane ride all the way up, even though I hate flying. But I did make a promise in one of my previous posts down below that I would probably fly next year. Little did I know that I was going to live up to that one. But we have an extra tag-along guest this time... InuYasha on crack. A pink coated, messy haired, broken Tetsusaiga'd InuYasha basically. Lol. It was nearly Hell. Never take a little kid to a large animation and manga convention without his/her parents. Rule of thumb basically. At least I got to see my friends and such while I was there. So that made the trip enjoyable.

Pirates of the Caribbean 3: At World's End came out on May 25th. Woo Hoo! I enjoyed it very much. Went to the midnight showing of course and loved every minute of the movie while I was there. Especially the pre-movie events. Such as watching other people dressed as pirates come in and then there was the random Batman that ran about the aisles with two people behind him holding up his cape. That was funny. But the movie was good and everything else was great.

June saw the sleepless nights as I worked away toiling on my projects for college. So much work to be done and yet so little time to really do it in. Planning probably could have been better laid out, but oh well. But yeah, at least I had a new computer to help manage my time and cut down on this and that.

July came about and it was time to restart the Master Chief project. Finish it up. Work went slow as school helped to slow things down as usual. Not enough time really to work on stuff when you spend all day at school. So August passes and then comes September and we're still not through. Basically we pushed the wire and pushed it some more right until the deadline, working all through the night and into the next morning hours before AWA 13 even started, but we managed to get it finished.

It was costly, but AWA 13 rolled in with a large bang. The costumes were done and it was time for the unveiling. Finding a space in the crowded lot, it comes time to slip on the bulky, heavy costumes. Well it breaks apart. Sucks a** completely. One costume survives, of course it's heavily fiber glassed while the other isn't. Didn't have enough time to fiber-glass two. So it's off to home, which is miles away, for quick repairs. In the meantime, of course, one costume is probably getting killer photos and everything while I'm stuck doing repairs and picking up stuff. Talk about Hell at a convention. This is worse then ACEN. So the repairs are complete and it's time to head back. Of course, at the time this is all going on, we're trying to register for this and that at the convention to participate in certain events. It's pretty hectic and all.

Well the remainder of the convention is basically repairs to the costumes and of course going to take breaks as well as pick stuff up. Of course, I'm the one picking stuff up, wasting valuable time that I could be spending at the convention but I'm the one with the car. Whoopie... But still, it was fun and all. At least we got a lot of photos and got to see a lot of stuff. Yay. But at the end of it all, I think we're against heavy, bulky costumes. Might as well stick to the other, non-bulky costumes.

Well October rings in the new school semester and the round-about for the seniority at school. Fall is here and it's pretty much Hell on Earth to try and complete more projects in time for the final unveiling. Of course I've learned from past mistakes and such and I make a better plan. Of course my time management still needs a bit of work, but I'll do something about that later.

November ushers in Thanksgiving and a nice break from the stress of school. Everything is killing me at this point, but I'm hanging in there. Not much really to say about all of that.

December comes and it's time for the finale. Stress levels are high and I get a big passing grade. YES! Time to celebrate. Alas though, one of my teachers dies a tragic death to ovarian cancer. Boss has a heart-attack and nearly dies. It also marks the anniversary of my grandfather's death, so it's almost like a triple tragedy. But at least Christmas goes alright and such and everything else goes good up all the way to 2008. Also, thought of a new cosplay costume for ACEN. Hopefully I'll be able to go.

So what are my resolutions for this year?

1.  Manage my time better for school.
2.  Graduate from college.
3.  Eat healthier.
4.  Defeat my Pokemon rival. (I will triumph!!! ><)
5.  Try not to rush things.
6.  Get a better job.
7.  Pay college.
8.  Role play more.
9.  Spend more time with friends.
10. Write more stories.

Yeah... A lot of resolutions, but I need to do a lot of stuff."

"event","Well my avid readers, it seems I have done it again. I have taken a long leave of absence from my journal. Forgive me but I have had a lot of things going on within the past while so I will have a lot to talk about now.

    Well it seems that school didn't go as well as I had hoped. Idiot teacher wouldn't pass me, even if my work was satisfactory to an extent. I'm not the damned best, but I did try. Some teachers you just can never satisfy no matter how hard you try. So I'm aiming not to get him again as a teacher, besides he was weird and he slightly smelled. So not the best person to talk to either.

     Other than that, school is going fine for me now. More stress as usual since a lot of work is due and I have so little time to do it. And it appears that I have to be better than what I am putting out, so maybe this degree isn't the best for me, but I do know this... Teachers have their opinions... and professionals who want to hire me on have theirs as well. So I might as well take the advice the teachers give me, practice, and then put that to use in the professional world where it actually matters.

     Well school's a bitch but let's go onto life. The crueler mistress. Well ACEN is coming up, 20 days. Got my costume together. I'm heading as Edward Elric. Going to be looking for some Winrys to pair up with. I have done the pre-registration and I am waiting on their confirmation, but I will raise Hell and show them my proof of pre-registration if they make a fuss with me. Hotel room has been booked and I need the money for that and for the transportation up there. I am looking into flying, but the tickets aren't getting any cheaper by the day as I wait for my job to pay me. It's been a month and I still haven't gotten any check from them. I am just going to have to go to the boss and complain because I've been patient for far too long, plus the director will not return my calls and that really pisses me off. I need my money and they won't return my calls or anything? Should I go back and do another production with them if this is how I am going to be treated afterwords?

     But the second I get the check, it's off to the bank I go and then I'm going to buy my ticket and look into what time I'll need to arrive at the airport so that I can get through the long ass inspections and what not. I hope they don't cavity search anyone. hehehe. But other than that. ACEN is going to rock, plus I get to be with my one and only. So I can't wait.

     Ah, yes. I am in love once more. Well this time I can really say it for sure. There's not enough room in this journal to tell you how much she means to me. Plus, it would be such a long entry, I know only one person would want to read it. Don't worry, I'll think about writing it out and sending you a copy. But yeah, that's pretty much what's going on right now. I am happy, for the most part, school is the only real let down, but what school isn't you know? And I'm going to try and write more, whenever I have the time, so please be patient and understanding. Thank you.

Until next time... take care of yourselves...

"event","Well friends I promised to write more often and I am going to do good on that promise. So here is another entry for all of my avid readers. I still ask that you please leave feedback as I would really appreciate that.

Moving on to the main points. I still don't know who I would go as to all of the anime conventions. It's a hard choice and everything based on what I got to work with. My Ed Elric costume for AWA last year worked well, but I'm thinking of other animes to work from besides Fullmetal Alchemist.

Well this issue is going to be surprisingly short. Hehehehe. The conventions are my only real update. I'm going to try and attend Momocon between work and everything. Only a few more weeks until Momocon. I don't think I'll go in costume for this one since I don't really have that much time and since I'm going to be working anyways, wouldn't really work out probably.

Well that's all for this issue. I'll try and keep up this day-to-day writing but I won't give any guarantees. Don't know how each day will go. Later everyone. 

Take care of yourselves... Until next time...

"event","Holy Crap! It's been so long since I've posted anything at all. Wow... December 1st was the last time that I posted anything on this journal. Well fear not my loyal readers for I am back with a vengeance. I have a lot to talk about and I'm going to make sure that I cover all the bases in this issue. I'll try not to make it too long since I know how people love to read the short posts, but that's why I break down these little issues into different little paragraphs so that you can stop and take whatever little breaks that you want to.

     Anyways, moving on now. First to cover from the last issue, I passed all of my classes. Even that hard one. It was tough going on towards the end but I managed to pull through and make a C+. I was so happy that I jumped for joy, especially since I had failed the class the last time I had taken it, but the teacher wasn't as much as a help as this teacher was. It was nice.

     I did register for my new classes and I am currently still taking them, so that is a real pain, but it's only for a few more weeks and then I get to enjoy a small break in between the quarters. The currently hard class seems to be my Advanced Drawing class. It's not because of the subject matter, that comes easily enough and I do a pretty good job in the class but the teacher just doesn't seem to like the way that I draw and I try and it just doesn't seem to please him and I really hate when that happens. It seems I may have to push myself the extra mile, try new techniques since it seems the different techniques that I have already tried haven't seemed to work much... which sucks entirely... I do so hope that I can somehow pull things together and pass the class as well as the other classes as well, but it seems that I won't have as much trouble in the other classes.

     Life... in general life has been extremely good. I have my friends and I have made new ones and still have my writing and my role playing which seem to be going very well. I have a lot of fun doing that as well as drawing of course, I wouldn't be an artist if I didn't like to draw. I guess I'm a creative person all around. Just have the creative juices flowing out the yin yang there. hehehe. Anime conventions are coming up and I hope that I can really go to them. I'm looking to go to Momocon, ACEN, Kunicon, Dragoncon, and of course AWA. Can't miss out on that, especially how it was last year. That was so freaking awesome.

     I did manage to get a little something-something of a job while doing work and everything for college. It seems to pay well but all of that money is going to my car and towards school so what's the point? It gets the freaking bills paid... Oh well. I am an actor now it would seem, and that's really good since I look to become a voice actor in the near future. Hopefully I'll get to do more productions and get even more acting experience. I play as the main villain in a small little dinner theater play. I got to play around with how I would voice the character and everything, so that was cool. And the cast that I get to work is is awesome as well as the director. A real visionary in a sense. I was hoping to get one of the smaller roles, and I wasn't looking forward to playing as the main villain, but I now that I have played him and everything, it's not so bad and I feel as if the character comes naturally to me. It could be that I am just pure, dag-nasty evil... Yeah... It's just a fact. *Evil Laughter* But we already did our opening show and it was a real hit and everyone loved the villain and especially how I played him, so that's a big plus for me. It even got me to sign for a few autographs. But I really look forward to the future shows and productions.

     I do hope that I can get into an internship. I really wanted to get one with Cartoon Network so that I could make some contacts on the inside of the cartoon business so that I could get my animes made. It's so hard to promote myself out there but I am hoping to use the anime conventions for self promotion. Maybe I should wait until I'm about to graduate or so that I wouldn't have to leave school to go to California or wherever they want to send me. I hope it's not too far away but if I get to go to Japan then all the more power to me. I would so love to go to Japan, especially Tokyo. I would see the sites and see if certain rumors that I hear about the Japanese are true. I'm sure that they are but seeing it for myself would be better than hearing or reading about it. We can make up many stories and have people believing whatever we want them to believe and with all of the photo and video editing software there are, it's pretty easy to manipulate the eyes and everything. But as an artist, my eyes are trained to look for these sorts of things when I am watching something or looking at a photograph. So sometimes I can see the editing but not all of the time. Some people are really good at the editing.

     I am in love. Love is such a great emotion to feel, as is happiness and I have them both wrapped up in a package. I love my cutiepie so much. She's so great and I love her so much. I can't wait to see what the future will bring for the both of us.

     I am sorry my friend that I have not posted anything in such a long time, but I have been busy and this journal of mine just happened to slip my mind. I would want to post in it but then stuff would happen and I wouldn't be able to get around to it and everything but from now on I will try and make the time gaps between my posts not as long. They have been growing great distances from each other it would seem. October to December and now this. Damn... I really need to write more or less... So that I won't get these extremely long posts and everything.

     Well that seems to be all for now. This is such a long post, but when you go for months on end without writing a damn thing and so much happens over those two months, you just end up with a lot of stuff to write about, so it turns out pretty cool and everything. Anyways my friends I am off now. Stick around for the next exciting episode of my life brought to you in part by Live Journal.com.

     Until then everyone... Take care of yourselves...

"event","Hey everyone. It's been a long time since we last spoke. I've been a little busy with school and everything and frankly I just forgot about my journal. Well I didn't completely forget but I did get sidetracked too much to write in it. Anyways though, another issue is coming right up.

First off, we'll start as always with school. School has been going pretty good. I'm getting hounded on my papers that I write. I can write a good paper and everything, but I guess some teachers you just can't please. I guess I'll have to be more thorough or something, or make myself a little clearer in what I mean. Oh well. As far as school goes, I think I'm going to pass, I'll have to see my second grade in one class in order to see how well I'm doing. I really need to pass the class this time. I hope my extra credit comes through for me. But other than those worries, school is cool for the most part. Nothing really but homework and projects going on there. So there's nothing more to say except for how happy I am that Christmas break is coming up soon. So I get a little vacation.

But moving onwards, it's time to hit the cycle of life. That hard subject that most people just don't want to talk about... Right... I think life is mostly what everyone wants to talk about. They wish to speak their miseries and their triumphs to people, mostly people they know. Good friends, relatives, so on. But only few have the courage to go to the internet and let the world view their life story or even write a book about their life, but we all know, if you're going to do that, your life have better have been an interesting one because you've got a lot of pages to fill if you're going to write a novel. Moving on though, I think that life can really pass you by if you don't seize it while you have a chance. Most people want to complain about their lives, and I don't find anything wrong with that, but really have you tried to do anything about it? Have you tried to correct your problems? Or do you want someone else to do it? Do you expect miracles to happen to you? I hate to be the bearer of bad news... but these sorts of things don't really happen. Life isn't going to go the exact way that you perceive it or even hope for it to go. You have to get up and do something if you want your life to be good. You are the one who makes the difference in your life for you truly have the power to do so, no matter what anyone else may tell you. They can only say things, and sometimes they can do things to help or hinder you, but you ultimately have the power to break free from the shackles of depression and pick yourself up and do something with your life. Inspiration may come in the form of a friend, a mentor, a teacher, heck... it may even be from a total stranger. You may read it in a newspaper or a live journal like this one.

But look at me... I've gone on in a rant. That seems to happen from time to time, but if any of you do ever find inspiration in my words, then feel free to tell me so. I'll keep writing this journal for as long as I can ya know. But I do want to hear feedback from my readers, if I even have any... I may just be writing this for myself, hoping that someone will come along and read these entries. But who knows... My audience could be small... it could be large. Only way to know is to get reviews... feedback.

But really, moving onto life, before I get into another rant. Life isn't so bad. Still have bills to pay and what not, but have you ever just wondered what the heck God is doing with your life? Sometimes you can look around you and see everyone you know being happy and having a good time and a good life, being successful, doing the things you want to do, and it doesn't seem how hard you try, how much work or effort you put into trying to better your life, trying to become happy... Something is always there preventing it. That is why it makes me wonder what in the world God is doing for my life? No body's perfect and I'm no saint... but I think we all deserve a happy life. To find love, to find happiness... something you can grow old with and die happily knowing that you've fulfilled your destiny, whatever that may be. That you've lived a long, good life without regret. But for some... it seems that day may never come. It's as if the sun has set forever and we are left in the cold dark, having to watch the world around us, not being able to do anything, while others bask in that happiness. But as I said... all we can do is try, to push ourselves forward and hope that the day will come. Have faith that no matter how we have lived our lives so far, that we can always find happiness, even if it takes us most of our lives... Just have to have faith and hope and to try and maybe there is light in the darkness after all...

Until Next Time You Guys... Take care...

"event","Greetings everyone. This is sure to be a mind blowing issue, hopefully not literally, but if mind blowing does ensue please consult your physician or get some psychiatric help immediately. Plus I am not liable for any mind blowing that may occur. You read at your own risk.

Well school went well this week. It was another good week at school, but I hope to have another good week just like it next week. But school just seems to have lost its fun. The classes are easy, except for the one and that long Wednesday, but I made it that way so I'm not going to complain, but the fun factor seems to have been removed for now. I like doing what I do at school, but it's gotten to be kinda bland. I hope it picks up.

But yes, the real topic of this issue is the stupidity of people. This stupidity issue covers driving. Well as I had mentioned, school had went well so on Friday, it was time to head out and hopefully relax a little if not have some fun. So you have your destination in mind and you know where it is, but the only way to get to it is to go through the interstate. Not a bad idea, it'll save time and maybe some gas, depending on the car. Well... the stupidity starts out like a normal one. Traffic in all of the lanes, and there's a lot of them, is stopped, backed up. Well this is normal because it usually gets like this as people try and make their way to their homes and what not. Well, thinking it as usual, I head down the side routes, but I eventually have to get on the interstate of doom so I get on at the closest exit to it, and bump right into traffic. Well as I had figured, traffic on the highway was as bad as traffic on the interstate, but only heading in the direction I needed to go. Well, I get on and make my way over to the speed lane, which really isn't heading that fast at all, but give or take it's a restricted lane that I could travel in. At times, there seemed to be a flicker of hope that the traffic was over when we finally got up to the minimum speed at least, but all for not, as we quickly slowed back down to a grueling crawl. Well we get up to where the interstate merges down into two lanes like the normal interstate and we head down that way for a few miles, and we finally see the accident or at least the cops anyways. Well this is nice because we finally get to see what people are slowing down for and we get up there and we see this one car, but that's not the accident. So I drive down a little futher and the real accident shows itself. It's a small little fender bender with a busted headlight. Something small, and get this. It's on the other side of the highway. So we've been stopped and slown down through all of that traffic for 24 miles give or take a mile just for this which is on the other side of the interstate. Well that pisses me off because it was a huge waste of time, 2 hours almost, and gas too. These drivers were idiots, all of them. But the stupidity doesn't stop there. Finally moving fast once more, oh yeah, we come across this SUV that looks to be going camping. That's cool and all but they're losing some of their stuff on the way as it falls off of the top. Well this isn't good at all and I happen to see this, so me and my passanger buddy drive up along side of them as best as we can through the traffic and try and get their attention. Well the kid sees us and he laughs. So we're sitting there smacking our heads at this, hoping the kid will get his mother. He doesn't. She finally notices us and we try and tell them about the rooftop. They signal that they understand, but do they pull over, nope. They keep going and they increase their speed even. This is totally bewildering us and we're almost beside ourselves at the stupidity.

And so that's all of the stupidity that needs to be noted. The rest of it is usual everyday stupidity. But hey, someone else's stupidity can really brighten another's day. Sure it's wrong to laugh at other people, but in these cases, I would guess it's ok. But we can never hear about these acts of stupidity if no one ever tells them so please feel free to comment on acts of stupidity that you have seen as you write your comments to this issue. Knowledge comes through the power of communication.

Saturday is going well. Just another normal saturday, watching the animes. May Japan continue to put these sweet animes out for the rest of our lives and when we die may we go to Heaven and may Heaven be an Anime Convention where everything is free. Amen to that.

Halloween is coming up, and I was thinking about going as Ed Elric, the FULLMETAL ALCHEMIST. I figure that Ed is so short, that people will mistake me for a kid and give me free candy. I can have Roy accompany me and pretend to be my father or something. But I don't think that's going to work out but there's always those wicked cool parties to go to. So HAH on the little kids and their free candy, we older people get to go to our wicked cool, yes folks I really did say wicked cool, parties! BOO YEAH! I'll drink something to that.

But yeah, that's all for this issue. Be sure to stay tuned for the next exciting episode whenever it decides to be produced or whenever something stupid or amazing happens that's worth mentioning. Until then, take care everyone.

"event","Ah... back in school... wow... what a joyous occasion. The first day went by smoothly though, just had one class so that was good. Went in, got out. No problems at all. The teacher is one I've had before, so I am very familiar with how the class is going to be run, not to mention it's a class I know very much about so I should be able to pass without any problems at all, which is good.

But the second day... started out good. Had a very interesting class in the morning, which made me laugh. I think I'm going to enjoy that class very much. It's another thing that I am good in, so I shouldn't have any problems or worries. The only class that does worry me is the only class I get to draw in. And the teacher that I have is the hardest of the teachers, so you can feel my pain. It's not really something that I excel in right off the bat. This class is going to take hard work and dedication, lots of practice and research and what not in order for me to pass it. I have some, if little, skills from the prior class before that one, so I'm hoping that my previous knowledge can help me out. Luckily for me, the teacher is kinda forgiving in a way, so this class shouldn't be as hard as the one before it, even if there is going to be a lot of stressful work ahead of me.

But I did choose this path and I like to do it, even though I don't like pressure that much but I do normally succeed while under pressure, so that could help it might not. I don't really know. All I can do is try my best and give it my all. Wish me luck everybody. I have a feeling that I may need it. Though in my experiences... there is no such thing as luck, there is still a thing called hope though and I'm going to hang onto that one all Quarter long.

Well that pretty much sums it up for the first two days of back-to-school, still have two more days ahead of me which look to be very promising, especially tomorrow. Thursday should be the good day though, so at least I get to end the week on a good note, hopefully. But be sure to stay tuned for the next issue, since I might just speak out upon these other two days and how they went.

"event","It's my second issue and yes, once more, there's lots of things to talk about. Let's begin.

First, work can be quite tiresome when you're running around all day with the stress of other people on your back. I feel as if I go in looking good but when I come out, I feel like a wreck. Oi... I hate that. But yes... work is work and you have to do whatever you have to do to earn a dollar or two. But I feel as if you should find something that you can do that you find fun. You shouldn't just work for the money itself, then you'll end up hating your job like I do and regret every day that you have to work. But enough about work. Who wants to hear about that?

Life... that's where the real fun is, right? Sometimes this can be true, however, most of the time it's not. It can be a real pain in the """"""... butt... Hehehe. I knew what you were thinking I was going to say... Anyways... Well life can be a cruel mistress. School starts back up Monday, yes I am on what we unfortuantely have to call our Summer Break, even if it is only 3 weeks. Enjoy your 3 months of vacation while you can, because I'll be getting out a year early. hehehe. But that's not all good because then life will come bearing down on me like a ton of books, just like they do to Schiezka, excuse my spelling of her name if I got it wrong FMA fans. But yeah, early classes and one of the hardest teachers in the school. I'm going to have so much fun this quarter. YAY!! But I have my friends, so I'll be fine, even if school doesn't give me much of a life to really celebrate about, and all of my vacations from school are just more work. That's life for you, one big pile of work to be done until you're like 70 years old and then you finally get to rest but by then you're so old that you won't really want to have fun or do anything like the stuff you dreamed about when you're younger. No offense to you old people. I don't know what I'm really thinking about that subject, I guess I'll just wait until I retire to find out. By then, this journal may have its third entry. Lol.

But yeah... that's enough ranting for one day. So you'll have to wait until the third issue to find out what's going on next. Until then... take care of yourselves."

"event","Well... here I am at last, thanks to my good friend Automail_junkie. ^-^

My first entry... what should I write about? I would imagine a good start would be that AWA (Anime Weekend Atlanta) was successful. I had fun all three days that I went and I met a lot of people there. Everyone loved our automail and we got a lot of questions and pictures taken of it, so that was cool. Life was very good those three days, and then the fun came to an end, just like every other good thing.

But with that said, school is fixing to start back, yay... -.- That's going to be real fun. More work. All I ever seem to do is schoolwork. My life cannot consist of much of anything else but schoolwork. They keep you so darn busy, it's enough to drive someone insane, especially with all of the restless nights you get. But I have fun doing it sometimes, depends on the subject and how lazy I am feeling at the time.

I really wish I had joined earlier when I could have more to talk about that didn't already happen, but now that it is has happened, that sort of takes the anticipation out of it, you know what I mean? AWA was the big thing, along with the automail construction process. UGH... was I ever tired of looking at it after all of the hours spent building the thing. And wouldn't you know that it didn't turn out just right so you have to spend more hours fixing it so that it'll be ready. If we possibly had more time to work on it than just a week, we probably would have made it look a little better than it did, but it still turned out great. Artists can truly turn out great works of art, and I think making a costume or automail, or any type of prop is like an art. You really have to be dedicated to it and know where to shop (Thank you Winry ^.~) But I did have fun making it, since it turned out to look so real, even if it wasn't metal, though we wish it was compared to some of the automail that we saw at AWA. But I did hear that if we had made it out of metal, that my arm would probably have fallen off somewhere on the first day due to the weight, and I think aluminum would have probably cut into my skin too easily, slice and dice if you know what I mean. So really, I don't know how exactly you could safely make automail out of metal or any metallic substance, but I'm sure with some time and research, it could be done.

Darn... first entry and look at how long it is. I hope my future entries don't turn out this long otherwise it won't be a journal anymore, it'll be like a newspaper. EXTRA! EXTRA! Come and read all of the long ranting of me! I suppose this is where I'll end it so that I'll have more to talk about in future entries, but I'm sure with school around the corner and the upcoming events, the future entries will be just as good as the first.

So until next time everyone...

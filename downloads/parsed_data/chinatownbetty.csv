"event","hey there cock guzzlers, jack here to relive some of the the past couple of weeks.  now recently i had the distinct pleasure of attending the wedding of my uncle and some whore in the great city of detroit michigan.  it was great.  upon hearing that i intended to object to the wedding my uncle, he had that section of the service taken out allowing us to leave much quicker.  my cousin wore sunglasses into the church so it was a good day.  after the wedding i worked at this awesome italian resturant called comos as a busboy.  its run by this little 5 foot 90 pound italian lady who scares the living shit out of me.  however i made 105 bucks on a ""slow night"" from 4 pm to 4 am.  so i came back to the good old vienna homestead to find that i had not been fired from the movies, but granted another week vacation.  my cousin jay has moved in while hes finding a house, so this crib is inhabited by two pimps.  no competition though.  so thats where im at right now.  me jack b and ari got together for our little band thing and recorded two songs that kick the fucking shit out of whatever you're doing right now.  all in all i rule.  take it easy ya sack muchers"

"event","Hello hello hello everybody.  Man it is a good day.  First of all, for no apparent reason school was cancled.  This proves that virginia is the biggest pussy state ever.  Not that im complaining.  This is gonna suck on presdients day, but on to the good shit.  Jack Brandon got his license today, and we rocked the fuck around this dam state.  Me mothaland and jack.  Good things.  I wanted to go to burger king, so we got on 66 where we figured we'd find it.  Eventually we gave up and went to tower.  Mothaland talked himself out of buying the electric 6 CD and bought dispatch instead.  I went to safeway and got a select grape.  Next we went to go visit jacks old house.  Memories galore.  Jack cried for a bit then we left. We rolled to taco bell and jack and i applied for jobs.  After that we went to radio shack and bought little things for jacks moms car that He'll probaly get it i probaly wont, but if i do you know that all the tacos are gonna get the special sauce.light up her wheels.  They're pretty damn cool but they might not be street legal.  Fuck it.  The employee said we were good looking, and dont we know it.  Next i went to eat with mothaland at taco bell.  He bought me a dipped cone for the fact that i wont tell anyone that he cheated on attkins. Oops. Yeha man then we went to the mall, and saw curtis and some people for a sec and i told the lady at joe cool that her product was a piece of shit, and i got yelled at for not showing respect.  Being a mallrat sucks some ass.  Although i peed for like a half an hour at the mall.  Then i went home and took a mothafucking load off.

"event","goodness gracious last nite was pretty damn fun.  so heres the scenario, we're on our way to the tantric and 3 doors down show.  excitment is ripping through the car.  we go to the mcdonalds drive thru.  my dad makes small talk to the lady about the snow, i comment that shes probaly not used to snow in mexico.  we get on the road and zip down to constitution hall in DC.  grant and i get out of the car with colucch where we make our way to tantrics bus.  at the moment there was only the drum tech and the guitar tech on the bus, but we hung out with them for a while and watched a little bit of bruce allmighty. while we were watching grant and i got a couple of sweet vip passes.  after that we went down to the dressing room,and hung out with the band before they went onstage.  i enjoyed a coca cola, and grant had himself a yoohoo.  hugo the lead singer was drinking tea and singing to warm up his voice.  todd the guitarist was working out on the bowflex.  matt the drummer was walking around aimlessly.  jesse the bassist wasnt in the room.  we left, and went to go see brian, his sister, james, and eric we hung out with them untill the show started.  we went down to our seats and proceeded to get the fuck rocked out of us by tantric.  the only down note was there were these three stupid fat black chicks in front of us.  they were heckling and shit, but hugo got them to shut the fuck up.  my thoughts were hey at the end of the day, they're still fat and black.  so after the show we are all hanging out in the area next to the tshirt stand, when who else but hugo ferreria the lead singer of tantric comes out to shoot the shit with us.  we just hung out and talked with him and watched him drink and sign autographs and talk with his many many fans.  he was so dam cool, i mean how many rock stars just hang out with fans.  we also hung out with kevin the tour guitarist who is a really really great guy.  so we went back down to the dressing room, where it was now only hugo and kevin, but the guys from the opening band shinedown came in and hung out with us.  those are some pretty dam cool guys.  so we said goodbye to everyone after a while and went to see like 2 minutes of 3 doors down's show.  then we went out into the snowy snowy night, and i bought a 3 doors down shirt from a black guy for 10 bucks.  then we cruised all the way home with happy memories in our heads.

On Saturday me mothaland and steve rocked it ready at ballston mall which kicks tysons to shit.  As we were walking in, it started to snow a little bit.  The roads were icy as shit, so when we were driving over we had mothaland sit in the back for traction.  After we arrived, we decided to go watch mothaland eat.  he had the whole left side of the food court, i rocked some arbys, and steve had some chinese that he didnt even eat half of, so i helped him shovel that shit down.  we were on our way to the movie theatre, when i found a make your own tshirt place, so i had some arab make me a ""kill whitey"" tshirt.  it kicks some hardcore ass.  so we went and saw along came polly, which ruled.  i recomend that shit.  perfect date movie.  so after we got some starbucks, and i had the best black and white cookie ever.  we just sat in these comfy chairs and listened to some hippie play guitar.  it was a good night.  sunday, i had a basketball game which we lost, then nicky and co. came over.  my friend txu (pronounced shoe) from nyc was in the neighborhood so she swung by.  we had a grand old time.  early in the evening nicky had a great conversation with his parents about masturbation.  it was rather entertaining.  so today is my gods day.  and im celebrating by kicking the man in the balls and collecting my wefare check.  always remeber my man mlk and dr j

"event","well my peoples, weve made it to friday.  time for a sweet ass three day weekend full of fun adventure and hopefully nude women.  my day thus far has kicked some ass, namely lunch.  a buddy of mine, lets just call him david ford (with aim screen name dj064) started telling us about his many exploits with women.  1) He first told us of his love in sixth grade, kathrine gongaware.  now he loved her.  when asked why, he replied she had, ""nice hair""  he even went so far as to find out what street she lived on, and told his mom that there was a house for sale there, in hopes he would ""accidently"" run into her.  2) Carly Avesian was the subject of his love in 7th grade.  He told us how in the computer lab, he used to change the screen saver to say, ""i love carly."" wow what a pathetic soul  3) Finally he told us of Allison Eck, whom he admired in 8th grade.  When it came down to the wire, and someone was going to alert Allison of Davids love for her, David reacted the way any macho man would: he covered his head with a sweater and hid under a desk.  
After realizing what a huge loser he was, david spoke the truest words that have ever been spoken, ""i suck."" yes you do david, yes you do.  if you would like to voice your disgust with david ford, instant message him at dj064 and tell him

"event","holy shit ladies and gentelmen it is officially fucking freezing.  we had a fire drill during the history test, so i went out in only a t-shirt and had the following conversation with my history teacher, him-how cold is it? me-pretty dam cold. him- This cold (spreads fingers an inch apart to signify that my penis shrank to that size) me-ouch.  Yes nothing makes a day rule like your history teacher saying your penis is small.  I was this close to whipping it out in front of him to wipe that grin off his face, but mere talked me out of it.  After school rocked it at 7-11 with jack b and mothaland, who is either pregnant, or sick, or both judging by his weight.  We sat out in the freezing cold drinking slurpees and making fun of mothaland, good times.  Got home, where my mom was taking down the tree.  I enjoy watching women work so i declined from helping.  went to bass where my teacher had shaved his head, way to go scott.  went to mcdonals and tried the ""philly"" cheesesteak, which is really shaved hamburger meat put inbetween two rolls and covered in bad cheese.  needless to say i enjoyed it.  so lets recap the day thus far; froze ass off, history teacher commented on penis, male friend pregnant, bass teacher fucking weird, cheesesteak good.  pretty good thus far.  by the way its supposed to snow like a bitch tommrow

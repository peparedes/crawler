"event","Well i haven't written in this for a long time. A new girl is in my life, but i'm not in hers. Meaning, i dont think she likes me anymore, if she ever did. Its just so frustrating I meet pretty girl, like her a lot, she kinda gives signs that she likes me, then bam she stops and I fall and get hurt. But what else is new? Its just so frustarting and depressing. School is alright. Mr freakin crazy H gave me a 70 for the quarter verymuch in trouble for that. but oh well. I alos found out i need surgery for 2 sists i have on my lower back so that's going to suck also. My life is jsut great right now. But It could be worse so i'm not gonna complain. I will cya all later I just felt like venting i Guess."

First off school started wich is a drag cuz i have to wake up early, but i get to see all my friends I havnt seen all summer. I like a new girl, but i still like the other girl too, so thats a little bit of a problem. The turkey hill has been giving me good money and good food, well for the most part. By the way I'm gonna try to have another party after the homecoming game on saturday. My sister nor my parents will be there so dont tell your parents about it.

Learned how to sail a sunfish on my own. Quite fun I must say. Worked on monday. Met the coolest guy named Emilio. Makes work not so boring when there's someone to talk to. Had band camp. And CC has to go. He is a very annoying person who just needs to get laid. But you cant do anything about that. I'm playin my solo pretty well I guess. The barry sax is quite heavy though. but hey its fun.Yesterday I hung out with dan after band. We had fun He took me all over to get stuff for my playstation 2 and some cd's We also got stuff for his car. He's a good guy too! Finally i'm feeling like I have friends I love it!

It was tough, but then to top it off I had to run my ass off for another hour at a tennis lesson. Oh well. I have to start this fitness thing too now. Damn I'm gonna be beat. But today I might go play a round of golf with cj, depending on what he says. I'm goin away on Wed. up to the adirondax for the rest of the week. It should be good fun with illegal fireworks and hot polish neighbor girl. Yesterday I shot a groundhog with my big sniper rifle(220 swift) When I picked up what was left of the poor thing I suddenly realized how bad war and guns and all that shit is(when used improperly) damn it was greusome. Well I'm gonna go get somebreakfast. Oh another thing my family might be taking a foreign exchange student from Germany. He sounds pretty cool with a lot of the same interests as me. I hope it works!

"event","Today was pretty boring. Woke up at 10, church at 11. After that I went to visit a family friend who just got out of the hospital. That felt good i guess. Loafed around the house, then mom took me to walmart in q-town. You never realized how many rednecks there are down there until you go to a walmart on sunday. Damn I got stuff for dan's birthday. I also go cj some cool stuff for his car just as a thank you for takin me to school almost everyday. Got home and just worked on hooking up all my game systems, how frustrating. Then I just got all sad and mopy and depressed. I fell asleep and woke up and my dad asks me to practice and i said i cant i'm too tired. then he really pissed me off by sayin maybe ur depressed. so i went into the computer room and i thought. hmmm maybe i am. I don tknow i just get down sometimes nothin big doesnt everyone?? oh well. I still haven't talked to her I MISS YOU !! I hope she's not dead. Oh well I'm excited about dan's party. It sounds fun. I'll see you all later"

"event","Last night was pretty cool. My first time at king koffee. I acted like a total retard though not talking and just standing around. But i did get t oknow some people when we sat down. It was pretty cool. Today I am goin to my friend Christina's dance recital, I dont know if i want to go or not. The woman I am dying to get to know hasnt been online lately so I cant make any plans with her! It's so frustrating sometimes. It seems like I'm the only one without a girlfriend. . When we spent the day together before she seemed to like me and i really liked her. OH well It's a matter of time now."

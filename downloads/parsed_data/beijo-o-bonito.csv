"event","hm... so thanksgiving weekend or... 5 days was fun. Went to Jersey like always. Dinner was good. Then we spent the rest of the weekend shopping and such. My mom bought this mirror that this artist painted and its really cool. Then my dad went back and bought her a table painted by the same artist. it was like, $ 1,500 for a small side table. Like honestly. But she deserves it. So we went to bead shop, my mom bought Mel and I lots of beads and such and she bought me a bunch of Svorski (spelling) crysals to make earrings with. Im excited. And Mel and I just bought jewelery and such. So that was fun. Then we went in to Philly like usual. Spent the day there and ate and shopped some more. Mel and I went into Condom Kingdom. Its like this huge store of like, every different type of condoms imaginable. SO... amusing and inspiring :). I missed Mel. She had been in Miami with Steve all week so I was happy to be able to spend the weekend with her. And yeah. Just shopped some more on Saturday. Ok... so anyways. I love Christmas season. I know what Im getting Adrian. and hes gonna love it ;) haha. just kidding love... well actually... you will love one of the presents A LOT;)soo... i'm almost done with my first ceramics piece. everyone else has done like, 4 or 5 so far. But oh well. And I have to get my portfolio put together soon.. like SOON. so i can send it in to schools by Christmas. And i have to remember to bring in my Holiday Bag sketchbook from Studio for Peace tomorrow. I'll prolly forget. He reminds me every year to bring it in for an example, but I always forget. so yeah. I have tons of drawing and painting shit to do sooo... Agh... SATS Saturday and date with Hoyet;)... then goin to Brooklyn next week :)

"event","aghhh. ok, last night my mom drove Adrian, Chris, Chris M, and me into the city to see Saw, and we thought it started at 745 but we got there and it started at 705, so we had to wait until 940 to see it, so we went out to dinner and went to Borders and such and then we wnt and saw it. omg it was so scary. Adrian even said it was the scariest movie hes ever seen . It was good though, but omg i almost peed my pants. Anyways, so today is Halloween, but its a Sunday so that sucks. So i dunno. My dad is in Las Vegas without us for a meeting and then staying with friends and gambling :)
anyways. 
going to see Incubus with Adrian and Natalie and Andrea in 6 days. cant wait. I saw them 2 years ago and it was awesome so hopefully it'll be the same this year.

i think the psycho from Saw is in my house!

I was so proud. And i got 6 baby ducks and my dad doesnt know and a bunny too.  so and ive been hanging out with Adrian a lot and such. We went to Autumn in the Village. Semi-OK. Anndddd..I went to his game and he got kicked out :) and he looks cute in football pants. And yeah. He had a nice dinner with my family which i know he loves ;) I also hung out with everyone i went to Australia/NZ with on Sunday. That was a good time. I saw Blane where a skirt and he looked nice. And i got to see my favorite hoes in the world. Mkayy.... Senior year bitches. But yeah, so im sick right now, Adrian got me sick. Im pissed. I left school at 9 yesterday morning cuz i felt like shit and so did my brother but i think hes just faking. Ok. Well.

I have also got approximately $325 from mon frere for my video camera. I figure I dont use it anyways so I might as well. My belly button hurts because I took it out and im not supposed to yet because its been like.. hmm. it was the 7th to last day of being in NZ, so.... like. less than a month. and i accidently made a new hole cuz it wasnt going through. Thats ok. i wont get it infected. i have a good immune system :) And most importantly, I have been talking to Adrian a lot lately and Im going over there tomorrow. So its getting better. Then today.. Mel and I went to Steves new house to see his new pitbull puppy, Shes so cute and her name is Nipples. hahaha. Him and Mel drove all the way to Long Island to get her! We spent tons of money on that dog at Petco today so it better like everything! We bought her doggy toothpaste and toothbrush and doggy mints and toys and a bed and treats and bones and such. Ok. My mom is coming home tonight from her annual extravagant multi day shopping trip in another state. And then leaving again. yay. Ok.    12.20

"event","ok.. so it was the CORN festival not the Cornhill festival, cuz i guess the Cornhill one is in July. oops. So I went with Danielle and we met up with Adrian and Nate. And we walked around and Danielle hugged corn (TWICE) and then the guys left and Danielle and I ate pizza and then my flip flop broke so I had to walk with one shoe on and one barefoot in gross streets so we asked people for Duct Tape. Some nice guy said he'd go barefoot too cuz he felt bad. haha. So no one had duct tape so we walked to Nate Carr's (spelling?) house to get duct tape. We weren't positive which one was his. So we just kinda guessed. But he had none. So we proceed to walk back to the festival and we walk past two approximately 50 year old men, and they say .."" God... two goodlooking girls. too bad theyre too young"". haha. so we walked faster, well i wobbled. Anyways. We stayed to watch the band and we met up with Sarah V, and Connie and Maria from Spain. And we had an amusing chat. And we hung out with some funny guys, one whose mom owned a pet cemetary... weeiiirddd. haha. im gonna take my deceased pets there. Anyways... yup. Good day. haha."

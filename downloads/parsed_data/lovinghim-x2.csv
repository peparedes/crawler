I hate it the first day of math every year is freaking mean ,median, and mode! Then I came home had a snack and now I am sitting here on the computer! How fun! That is all I am doing today because there isnt really anything to do so w.e.! Call me if you want and we can talk on the phone if you know my number or it will be on my away message! That's it!

"event","I havent written in here for a while so i will tell you about the last couple days! 

<33 Friday * IT WAS THE FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL! It was kind of fun being the big kids in the school! I have really nice teachers! I wake up so early! After school I had cheerleading practice! How fun!

<33 Saturday * I went to Devan's house for a little PARTY! Oh yeah! I had so much fun! Christopher Columbus, Ferdinand Magellan, Once De Loin, Ethan Allen, John Smith, Americo Vesspuci! LoL! After staying there till like 9:30 I went to sleep over Brianna's! Oh yeah! Really fun!

<33 Sunday * We woke up at 8 because me and Jess had to go cheer at a football game! So we woke up ate got ready and off we went to Manalapan! We cheered! 3rd quarter the score was 0 to 0 so we thought that we were going into over time but that wasnt true! 11 seconds left in the game and one the last play Manalapan runs the ball into the goal for a touchdown. So we lost. Everyone on the football team said that it was Larry Cella's fault and I think it was but w.e.! YOu win some and you lose some! After the game I went home and changed then went to Brianna's with my family for a little BBQ! That was sooo much fun! Then at like 9 Chris Castronuva, Matt Tetro, Tyler Wilton, Matt Tracy, Pat Joseph and some other kids cam to Brianna's so we played man hunt for a little bit, but then they went back to chris's! After that we stayed for a while then left and went home! As soon as I got home I went right to sleep I was sooooooooooooooo tired!

<33 Monday * I didn't really do anything I went to Staples to get school supplies with my dad then came home and Brittany called so I hung out with her and then I came home and ate dinner. After dinner I took a shower did my hair and went to bed for school the next day! 

<33 Today * I had school! It was ok you know.. it is school! Not much more to say! Now tonight at 6 I have cheerleading practice and then I am coming home and taking a shower! That is about it!"

We had loads of laughs! Then the next morning we woke up and we went swimming in my mom's friends pool... BRittany also came with us! We had fun! Then we were all in the pool and it started thundering so we ran out and my caousins jumped over the side of the pool! So then we went back to my house! There we watched Shrek 2 AGAIN! Then off to cheerleading we went! Before practice I had to talk to Jess - A - Kah because I thought something was wrong. Then we were talking about Coach Boot Camp and Ms. I only put one sugar in my coffee today! LoL! Makenzie, Jess, NIkki, and Carley! Once practice started we did sidelines then looked over at the Pee Wee's and they were stealing a dance from another Jackson team! But that is ok because the other Jackson team was better! (They one Nationals!) After that we started paryer! LoL! NOt really! We were just learning a new part of our competition cheer and it looks like we are all praying! Then after 2 hours of thundering and lightening they decided to call off practice which was STUPID.. we were practicng in it for 2 hours and now they wanted to call it off.. SO then we all went home because of those retarts! When I got home Britt called me so then I went over her house to watch the Teen Choice Awards with her, her mom, and her brother! It was like 10:15 when we got home so then I went to bed because I need some sleep!

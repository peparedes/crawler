"event","Cause it was just as much as my fault as it was yours. I need to talk to my parents.because I was with this one guy for over a year. and he was the only guy theyd let me see or date or whatever. And im afraid that they wont aprove of any one else. Its crazy. Im just gonna talk to my mom and see what she thinks about it. I can deal with what my dad says (he can get over it). Im so sad.  I just want everything to be ok, and perfect and all. But DONT BE SORRY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

"event","Im tired. and its late... My easter sucked.. mainly cause i slept most of it. I talked to Roland tho. Hes such a cutie pie! If I ever get to see him-im gonna hold tight and not let go! I had so much to write tonight but theres one thing on my mind that hasnt been on my mind for a year..stephen. Hes the person that never seemed to give a care less about me, even tho he practically owned all of my heart. Its odd how once u heal and think your over someone, they just come back..Can I trust stephen??? I hope he comes to camp with me. I need to get to know the new him. He was my dearest friend in high school other than Reba. He had one thing reba didnt have (my heart) because one.. Im not gay, and two I totally loved him...Now im older, and more mature, and those feelings arent as strong as they used to be.There for a year it was almost as if he didnt exist. when i got a job at berry was when i was reminded he was very much existant. And its also when i realized that the past was real due to huge scar that is burnt within my heart that throbs and aches everytime i think of him. He is the inspirer of all my poetry, hes the creator of me-he is why I am who I am right now. Every poem i own...has something to do with him just a little bit. As that poem we wrote together 'he is my crutch'eventho he wasnt there for me for the past two years. I have a HUGE decision to make. and I dedicate my next few days to a certain group of people.. R.S.P.S I cant sleep right now because my mind is full..and i have heartburn. I wished chocolate and love didnt exist... OoOo thatd be a good poem. *thinks* ahh not gonna happen right now..I kinda wished for once SOMEONE WOULD WRITE ABOUT ME!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

"event","Today was mixed emotions for me.... Patrick was in a crappy mood because he was sick, so they day started off crappy! Me tyler heather hope and he went to the mall and we hung around. Did some crazy crap and a weird journeys guy was kinda hitting on me... Or ""us"" rather. But according to everyone he was hitting on me more. which was kinda eww in a flattering kind of way.. Oh well. But then again he may have just been being nice.. I like the shoelaces he picked out for me.... They rawk ^_^ I accidently rubbed up against tylers booty which was in my face!!!!! and i was like omG! im sorry! and that guy goes uh huh! suuure! I said yep! cause i dont touch ppls booties. I grab them! ^_^ he was kewlies as dump tho!
*inside joke* ENIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!LMAO!!!!! HAHAHA Roland i love u for that because you are the only guy that can make me laugh like that & use the baffroom while ur on the phone. ;] you gots talent! I almost peed my pants- fo' real. (on the enis and stuff) I had fun with tyler over. Tho i cant help but feel sad because i didnt get to spend that much time with her. I was soo wrapped up in other things. I guess ill have to make it up to her. I ate me some taco bell today. I effin heart that store sooo much! i swear if it ever goes out of buisness iono what id do!!! cry-die-eat a chili cheese pie??? :D teehee. I went to wal mart too and got makeup...and errr a brush! oh and those easter eggie candies with the nummie stuff inside that makes me smile xD I swear they know how to do it!!!!and I over ate again by snaking on dang mcdonalds mcflurry. they are my weakness....and i hate it..cause I hate junk food. Im all about the homemade stuffs. If I dont prepare it myself, Im gonna eat it with caution-and in small qaunities. Yep..... Well also today I tried to get patrick with the water hose to cheer him up and the hole plan back fired and as a result i ended up wet, cold, and mad. Hmph.. Hes soo smart it makes me sick...
Apparently alex has magical powers where he can make things underlined..:S and also he just got back from Orlando..I didnt know he went to orlando=so there was a loooong time where i didnt talk to him....and didnt know where he was... Goh im a bad friend. Oh and he also likes the idea of sleeping with mini mouse and having baby alexiemousies.. ^_^ theyd be soo darn cute! well my knee hurts cause i ran into a wall and cutt it, so Im gonna go talk to tyler and alex.....

"event","The weathers warm and beautiful,the sun is over my head- and for once my life if starting to look up. ^_^ tee hee. Well I woke up extremely early this morning. I had to finish cleaning my room from the massive mess I made re-modeling. Im still not done, But Tylah is comming over to stay with me and Hopie, So I kinda dont want it to be trashed... Tho in just a few hours my room will smell of chili cheese pie, Orange crush, and numerous different scents of fabreze and disinfectants, Possible finger nail polish, black markers, and lotion...And then theres the booming music and giggling of dumb childrens laughter [myself tyluh and hope]that will echo the halls to drive my parents up the wall. I honestly dont know what Im going to bother makeing another chili pie. me and hope just ate one at the snack bar. And im extremely full!!! I guess its ok to blow my health kick for a weekend.. Mom was being such a jerk today at the grocery store. We are growing kids that need pop tarts, crush, pop sickles, and numerous amounts of can foods and potatoe chips not to mention packs and packs of blue koolaid... But she just doesnt understand that! Shes was all like "" PUT THAT BACK! U DONT NEED THAT!!!"" So the sisters and I snook all our junk in. Oh yeah I ate some pop tart too. Them things are yummie! 
  Hope drove her first ATV today! ever since a few years back when she saw the death of a young guy about my age because he was ran over by his father on one.. She just has been dealthy afraid of them. It was soo funny! because she was either mashing the gas too much or not enough and she pushed the breaks constantly. it was an automatic, thank goodness!!! But It was still fun all the same. She kept backing up and turing it wrong and everything. I laughed the entire time. Now Im kicked back in my chair listening to Ammee Allen-well now slipknot chillaxin waiting for Tyler so we can have fun!!! 
  Tomorrow we are all going to the mall dressed in our Jammers. So if you go and see a group of freaks with pjs lots of makeup, prolly lots of jewlrey and running around like dummies, thats us!!!! GIVE US A HUG! ^_^ Well i must return to my wonderful room....which will be in ruins by tomorrow. lol ILL TAKE PICS!!!!! 

Queen of Hearts OUT! peace!(%)"

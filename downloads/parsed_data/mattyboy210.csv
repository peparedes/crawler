"event","It is currently saturday night, the last real night of break...and i am NOT looking forward to a sunday full of homework. Its realll late and i should go to bed but i know when i wake up it will be sunday, and i just cant do that. Tonight was kinda eventful...i wanted to have a sleepover but we just hung out at colins parentless house...it being parentless really didnt change anything though. We played this fun game of Apples to apples, it involving nouns and adjectives and having to match them or something. 

---->For example, the adjective would be, Hopeless. Then each player had seven nouns and they would pick one that went with the adjective. The nouns that were used were like Martin Luther King Jr. (provided by Dan), dandruff, hot lava, etc., and then one person who did not give a noun would pick the noun that went with the adjevtive the best. 

Anyway the rest of night went well, a little slow, but i got to play my cello for people and that was interesting. Too bad michigan state lost, not that i really get into that stuff. 

See you monday :(
Matt."

"event","WOWZA! (Thats my new word i like to use alot) It has been so long since I've updated, maybe even 6 months! For some reason i have the urge update and start up this LJ again. Well i think i will get it going with talking about break so far. Its been a lot of fun! I ve been employed as go between in the love affair of...ha just kidding. Thats one of my THREE MUSKETEER lines. ANYWAY, i am working at the BBAC as a art camp counselor for 1st graders...and i have never had so many bruises and sore spots. Little kids are VICIOUS. this has actually changed my thoughts of having kids. i do not know if i really want to go through this again...except if i'm getting paid. 
My break has also involved hanging out with new people, which is always good! Interestingly enough, i have seen eric, not eric stein, just eric, EVERY day of this break, besides friday because i was grounded. Akash, molly dixon,jared hocking and some other people are on this list--its nice to be social and meet new people. 

Okay...now for the highlights of the break...
-being tackled by 17 1st graders, and having them touch places that havent been touched before...ew...
-FINAL DESTINATION, perhaps the worst and funniest movie ever
-going to BAKERS SQUARE three times
-running not walking 
-hanging with my non-christian clan
-the three intense games of scattergories-->the two pointer, Cool Calvin
-having alyssa randomly stop by and use my bathroom
-having three dinners friday night with daniel and eric
-LOST and FOUND! 
-my relationship with I-75 and northwestern
-MILLIONS the movie
-the anticipation for SIN CITY and candyland
-eating at every leos in south east michigan
-just hanging out and enjoying the break!
-the dollar store 

Well i hope the rest of the break can keep up with this!"

"event","NIMROD? What is that supposed to mean? I ll tell you what, its the NAME of the piece we're playing in Orchestra...yea, thats pretty strange.  And then comes the next part...I TOOK PART IN AN ORCHESTRA CARWASH.  INSANE i know. STUPID i know.  WHY WOULD ANYONE WANT THEIR CAR WASHED BY ORCHESTRA NERDS??? And i have an answer to that...only our parents.  The few cars that did show up were our PARENTS.  No one else.  And our parents didnt even tip.  Of course I tried to have fun, but the kids that did show up were these crazy, annoying, LOUD, and 4'11 kids that passed as freshman some how.  All they did was squirt me with the hose.  I know i know, one day i was probably like that too.  But I FEARED my superiors.  I RESPECTED THEM, at least until i got to know them.  I mean i will still shiver in my place whenever an upperclassman walks into my sight.  Well i guess it matters who.  BUT WHATEVER.  I am just a little stressed.

"event","Today was...lets just say, interesting. I sat around and and mowed lawns and it started raining on me.  Thats really it. I was planning to see THE VILLAGE but andrew canceled--he had work. But dithu(give him a break--hes indian) said hed come to Comedia with me and hes been locked in his house for a very long time so thats good. And because of commedia i ll be able to see all my theater friends before they leave which is ALSO good.  So i guess my day was good...but boring.  
Have you ever thought that your day reflects your mood...i mean today was okay yet kinda booring...and my mood is calm but a little bored.  And lets say your day was really good...then youd be in a good mood right?  Or is it that your mood reflects what sorta day youre going to have...?  But i dont think thats right because you could be in a cheerful mood and have the god awfulest day in the world and just have plain bad luck so that would ruin your mood...right?  Well I ll just have to test this theory out tomorrow--which doesnt seem like it will be a good day. I was going to do something with Carissa but i have to visit my grandparents and babysit."

"event","Wow! Its Friday and this is my very first LiveJournal and i am not totally sure what i am doing...--lets just hope it turns out okay. Anyway...today was a productive day.  I went to Mikes and awaited unknown people to come and tee-pee is house for A-finals--thats some sort of swimming meet, i am not really sure--and watched kill bill vol. 1 even though i have seen that movie sooo much--but i still like it. sorry if all the ""--""s and ""...""s confuse me...kydlan always told me i used to many of them and it got confusing.  Gosh i just like to ramble...and you re going to have to get used to that if you want to read these...but who would? Anyway! Tomorrow i m going to see The Village with Andrew, and i m pretty excited.  It looks really good and i liked all of M. Night. Sha********'s (i dont know how to spell it) movies.  The Sixth Sense was really good, and Unbreakable was wierd but still very interesting, and ""Signs was really good until you saw the aliens"" quoting my brother--so this one should be even better. 
     I am kinda sad though.  All my friends are leaving for a Scotland trip on Sunday and I was unable to see Hanna today and say bye before they leave.  Lets hope i get to see them before they leave.  Well its late...i should say bye. And i have another of CD of Frank Sinatra to listen to. Night."
